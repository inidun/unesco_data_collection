SCIENCE PROBES THE SECRET\
OF THE MYSTERIOUS ATOM
A s long as man has been on the earth he has been anexplorer and has expanded his world. For centu-
ries the scenes of adventure were on the earth's
surface, with the science of geography mapping theconquests and making them useable. Now that the entire
surface is familiar, explorers have turned to the depths
of the sea and the heights of the sky. The first plane left
the ground in 1905 and by 1950 rockets had soared
upward 250 miles, as far straight up as London is distant
from Paris. Today boys dream of flying to neighbour-
ing planets. Meanwhile great telescopes have made the
twinkling stars real and beyond the stars the distant
galaxies are now being counted and mapped. Our ima-
gination reaches upward and outward beyond the sky,
as in former days it played on unknown lands beyond
the sea.
All this is well known. But few persons understand
that exploration has also gone far in the opposite direc-
tion : inwards. It is harder to visualize because the mate-
rials around us-wood and stone and metal-seem so
solid. Yet within these and all other materials are mole-
cules and within them are atoms and, in turn, within the
atoms are still smaller particles, the proton, the electron
and many more. There seems no limit to smallness, and
research explores ever inward into the smallest as it does
outward into the ! great universe.
This is the scene of today's adventures and explora-
tion, as thrilling as any geographic or spatial expedition,
and as important to man's future life. It is important
that people everywhere open their minds to it and
become familiar with the facts. For here is a strange
world where solid matter turns out to be almost empty,
where particles move at incredible speeds, where they
even disappear and become energy, where energy itself
is composed of particles, and where time is measured in
millionths of a second. But once these new conceptions
are accepted and a few new words are learned there is
nothing too complicated to understand-unless one has
the curiosity to master the atom completely and, in that
case, thorough mathematical study is essential.
There is one important reason why the world within
the atom must be better known. That is because popular
ignorance of the subject has given the atom a bad name.
To the vast majority atomic energy means horrendous
explosions. and the frightful weapons that : could wipe
out civilization.
It is the tragedy of this new : Science that it happened
to come to fruition in 1939 just when the last great war
began and. it was almost immediately put to work to
increase military power. It was wholly unknown to
most persons when the first atomic bomb was exploded
and so it burst on mankind with an unforgettable shock.
And it should not be forgotten. Yet this military use-or
misuse-of the new knowledge is only one special
aspect, forcibly developed by war.
To ignore the entire science with all its possibilities
for the good of mankind is like closing one's mind to all
aviation and all peaceful uses of the airplane because,
during the war, aviation provided the merciless bomber.
There is little attitude of fear and horror today toward

the airplane. So too there is a world of benefit in the
medical, industrial and agricultural uses of the atomic
rays. There are revelations on the nature of matter and
the structure of the universe. There are the beginnings
of many new sciences and the indications of a good life
in the years to come for our children, if not for us.
It is today fully as important to know about the par-
ticles within the atom as it was to learn about the
mysterious new America centuries ago, or about Pas-
teur's discovery of the germs that cause disease two
generations ago, and about the invention of the airplane
fifty years ago. The frontiers of man's knowledge are
now within the atom.
This series of articles has the purpose of bringing
this new world to the schools, of answering the questions
that children today ask their teachers and their parents.
It is a story to explain why Unesco called together the
experts in atomic science from the European nations to
co-operate in researches on atomic structure and on high-
energy particles, since the costs are almost too high for
any one nation to bear alone. European students and
scholars can soon have facilities equal to the best since
twelve nations have recently joined to create the Euro-
pean Council for Nuclear Research (called CERN from
its initials in French), with a great new laboratory in the
city of peace, Geneva.
And so this is a story of international co-operation
in explorations at the borderland of man's knowledge.
It is a story that should help to make the new words-
like cosmic rays, protons, and mesons-familiar in the
common speech of all nations. Its purpose is to help
incorporate the world within the atom into the com-
mon culture of mankind.
But there is no discussion in these articles of bombs,
of plutonium, or of atomic reactors and piles. Those are
military applications of this new knowledge and they
represent only a small and specialized application of the
new science, largely secret and perhaps only temporary.
In these uses the atoms are destroyed by fission and their
matter is violently converted into explosive energy.
This is a very different subject from the cosmic rays
that reach earth from outer space, from the wondrous
uses of radium in curing disease, and from the inspiring
new conception of the atom as a universe in itself, as
complex as a galaxy of stars, filled with unknown
radiations, alive with action, of particles within particles,
and of puzzles wrapped in mystery. Explosive fission
for military purposes is a misuse, born of man's
incapacity in social and international affairs. It is not
a necessary nor a legitimate part of man's new know-
ledge of nature.
The scientific facts and principles explained on these
pages are not only the property of all mankind and the
result of research in many nations, but are truly an
expansion of man's universe. As the great explorers
mapped the earth, and the astronomers chart the sky, so
the atomic scientist, delving into matter and energy, has
discovered an unknown world that is a revelation for
philosophers and a vast resource for fortune genera-
tions. No educated person can afford to ignore them.

Radioactive lements, such as radium, emit high-speed particles, both electrons and protons, but in small quantities. For the exploration of the structure of the
atomic nucleus a powerful stream of very high-energy electronic or nuclear projectiles is needed. The photograph shows a Van de Graaff generator of such par-
ticles, detached from the large shell in which particles are given high velocity and become projectiles which can be effectively used for the bombardment of atoms.
Low activities consist largely in pulling
apart the objects found in Nature and
putting together again the mater als
thus obtained. Huge forests melt under
the lumberjacks'axes and come to life again
as Sunday papers and rayon stockings ; iron
ore deposits combine with rubber plantations
and oil pools to produce the noon-hour traffic
jam ; stone quarries reappear as houses. Man
learns quickly enough that the process of pull-
ing apart becomes increasingly difficult as the
size of its object decreases.
From the earliest times, it was possible to
distinguish two quite different levels on which
the separating and rebuilding operations could
take place. At the nearer level, the objects,
ranging from pyramids to grains of dust, exhi-
bit dimensions comparable to the human size.
Here the processes are mechanical and the tools
consist of the human hand with its multiple
extensions from the sharpened flint to the
watchmaker's drill. Energies which can be
spent in handling a pound of matter are still on
the scalE'of human stl'ength.
By Dr. Lew Kowarski
Director of the Laboratory Group,
European Council for Nuclear Research
Operations which we today call"chemical",
but which started as early as the invention of
fire and agriculture, occur on a quite different
level. We know today that every chemical pro-
cess consists in separating and re-arranging
material objects which are so small that in the
tiniest visible speck or drop of matter they still
number in billions of billions.
To separate these objects-we call them
atoms and molecules-from one another, we
have to exert a considerably greater energy
than on the previous level, and when we bring
them to rest in a new arrangement, similar
amounts of energy may be recovered. To hew
a kilogram of coal out of a coal seam (a mecha-
nical operation), the necessary exertion amounts
to but a small figure, when expressed in some
usual unit such as the kilogrammeter. But the
act of burning this same kilogram (a chemical
operation) produces 3 million kitogrammeters.
The human mastery of chemical forces, as
instanced in the technology of fuels, alloys or
synthetic materials, became fairly complete
during the last two centuries or so ; but as the
art of separating and recombining the atoms
improved, the first intimation appeared (about
00 years ago) that the atoms contained within
themselves still smaller structural units. This
recognition amounted to a new challenge-how
to take the atom apart-and a new promise,
that of an immense new store of energy which
could be gained on that new level of re-arran-
gement.
The taking apart came first. To concentrate
enough energy in the volume of a single atom,
no human too ! is fine enough ; the only think-
able agency is the impact of very small pro-
jectiles moving at a high speed. When a highly
accelerated atom collides with another, (Cont'd

dent momentum, the anvil can be smashed. The first operation of
this sort was produced in 1919 ; the atomic tools were not yet human-
made-use was made of the fact that some naturally occurring
substances, called radio-active, have the property of ejecting streams
of fast-moving atoms.
In 1932 this natural propulsion was superseded by human machi-
nery in which it became possible to subject atoms of hydrogen,
helium, etc... to very strong electric and magnetic forces. With the
help of machines-cyclotrons, Van de Graff generators etc-research
on subatomic,"nuclear", forces became rapid and effective.
It was quickly recognized that all atoms were built up of two main
types of bricks-protons and neutrons-and that the forces involved
in the combination of these bricks were enormous. In fact, in addi-
tion to the mechanical and the chemical levels of human interference,
a third level was discovered, involving energies millions of times
greater than those found on the chemical level.
These energies are often mentioned in terms of a special unit-the
electron-volt (written eV), which requires a few words of explanation.
A chemist likes to know the amount of energy contributed by a single
atom in chemical processes such as burning. Such amounts. are very
small and a very small unit is convenient when describing them ; in
the combustion of coal, one atom contributes about 4 eV.
Mothballs versus atoms
To be effective in nuclear processes, a single atom has to carry afew million eV (written MeV). Forces which, on the customary
human level, are distributed among millions of atoms, have to
be concentrated on a single one to enable it to deal a (nuclearly) telling
blow on the target. So we need powerful and intricate machinery.
During the first ten years of their studies on this level, the nuclear
physicists could only hurl streams of atomic bullets on their targets
and observe the rather few collisions which took place under these
conditions. This method was somewhat reminiscent of the famous
story according to which mothballs are quite effective against moths
if only you throw them adroitly enough to hit the beasts in full flight.
The disproportion between the huge machinery used in nuclear
research and the negligible combined weight of all the target atoms
affected by the lucky projectiles was enormous, but even the few hits
scored in this manner yielded a great deal of information about the
nuclear forces involved, and the nuclear physicists were kept happy
in their impractical pursuit.
The situation changed during the War, when a way was found to
produce in uranium a new kind of reaction capable of being trans-
mitted to neighbouring atoms of the same element. It was as if a
mothball had been invented capable of infecting a moth with a quickly
catching plague. The way was found to release in a kilogram of
matter energies several million times greater than those obtainable
by chemical processes, and a new chapter was opened, for better and
for worse, in the history of human control of natural forces.
For the nuclear physicist, this tremendous by-product of his inge-
nuity was but a small entry in the log-book of his voyage into the
unknown. A new aim and a new level of minuteness began to glim-
mer before his eyes : protons and neutrons themselves gave signs of
willingness to be taken apart. A swarm of tinier moths began to
'haunt the nuclear researcher's imagination and spurred on his quest
for swifter and surer mothballs.
By 1945 ways were found to speed the atom-sized tools-still the
same gaseous atoms, preferably hydrogen--to hundreds (and, by
1952, to thousands) of MeV, thus reaching. levels far above those
which, a few years earlier, led to the discovery of the peculiar pro-
perty of uranium. Today the fission of uranium, the peaceful piles
and the not-so-peaceful stockpiles are a chapter which offers little
professional interest to the nuclear researcher and which he is inclined
to leave to his chemical, metallurgical and engineering colleagues.
The forefront of nuclear research has moved into still higher concent-
rations of energy into still smaller volumes, and in doing so has
again become happily impractical and remote from immediate appli-
cations, lethal or otherwise.
Superhuman sources of energy
It cannot be said that on this"metatomic" (beyond the atom) levelevery phenomenon was a novelty. For th  past forty years a
mysterious agency, apparently coming from the outer space, was
known to affect the sensitive measuring devices user by the nuclear
physicists. These"cosmic rays", where found to carry concentrated
energy, sometimes comparable to that obtained from either radio-active
or human-made propulsive machinery, and sometimes far more
powerful than anything that human means could conceivably contrive.
For a generation, no phenomenon involving more than a few MeV
could be produced in a laboratory ; observers had to climb mountains
or fly balloons, and gather a scanty harvest of cosmic-ray manifes-
tations. Today thousands of MeV are open to experimentation and
tomorrow-the boundary of the human-made phenomena will be
pushed still further into the realm of cosmic-ray induced effects.
In this ambitious and yet disinterested pursuit, our American
colleagues had, so far, the advantage of having at their disposal all
the biggest and most modern nuclear machines. With the creation
of CERN and its plans of building two powerful sources of very
highly accelerated atoms, European scientists hope to be able soon to
resume their place on the advancing front of knowledge.
There will be new discoveries, some of which later on may lead
to new applications, as different from what we call now"atomic
technology"as this technology is different from chemistry. Know-
ledge brings fruit, but it is in his quest for knowledge itself that the
scientist is learning to hit the atomic nucleus with increasingly
sharper and more effective blows.

UNLOCKING THE BASIC SECRETS OF NATURE
0 ALPHA, BETA, GAMMA-THE ABC OF NUCLEAR PHYSICS
THE greatest surprise experienced by thestudent of the universe is to find that it is
composed entirely of discrete particles. If
one could step quite outside it, the whole great
universe would look somewhat like a wisp of mist
or a puff of smoke, with stars and galaxies in
place of the droplets of water in the mist. The
stars too, like the sun and the earth, are compos-
ed of materials in the solid, liquid or gaseous state,
and these in turn are composed of very small
particles, known as molecules.
Solid rock and metal, the oceans, and the atmo-
sphere around us are not continuous, as they
seem to our eyes, but are made up of individual
molecules. In solids they are held in firm contact
to each other ; in liquids they are loosely held so
that they easily slide over each other, or flow ;
in gases they are quite separate, with empty space
between them. Temperature decreases their
attraction for each other so that heating ice first
melts it to liquid water, then boils it to steam,
with the molecules separating ever farther from
each other. This much has been known for
centuries and is new only to the beginner in the
science of physics.
The molecules are all alike
in each of the many thous-
ands of different substances
that compose the earth :
sugar and salt, sulphur and
iron, cellulose and protein,
limestone and sand. They
are ultimate in the sense
that they cannot be split
into smaller particles me-
chanically. But the chemist
can split them by putting dif-
ferent substances in contact
with each other in which case
reactions take place that
give rise to new materials.
Thus heating oil or cellulose
in air starts combustion, to
form water and carbon
dioxide. This, with other.
experiments, shows that
within the molecules of the
oil and the cellulose there
are both carbon and hydro-
gen, both of which combine
with the oxygen of the air to
give the oxides-for water
is merely the oxide of hydro-
gen.
- Such reactions, and myr-
iads more complicated, have
proved that molecules are
composed of still smaller
particles, the atoms of the
chemical elements. There are
92 different elements, thus
92 different types of atoms,. which in various combina-
tions form the endless variety
'of molecules and therefore
the whole range of different
materials that compose the
earth and the universe-
including the materials that
compose living things and
the bodies of animals and
men. As physics studies mo-
lecules and their motion, so
chemistry studies atoms and
their combinations with each
other to form molecules.
For a century after their
existence was accepted by
scientists, atoms were consi-
dered to be the ultimate
building stones of all matter.
No one suspected that theynaa an interior. That would have been almost
unthinkable in the philo. sophy of the nineteenth
century. But in the final years of that century
came the revelation. In 1896, Henri Becquerel
in Paris noticed, aimost by accident, that uranium
fogs a photographic plate in the dark, even when
the plate is tightly wrapped in black paper. This
led the Curies, Pierre and Marie, to the discovery
of a new element, radium, which did the same
thing but much more powerfully, and which not
only glowed in the dark but kept itself several
degrees warmer than its surroundings, automatic-
ally and constantly. It was the most sensational
discovery of modern times. It was not only the
first revelation of what we now call atomic
energy, but also the first suspicion that the atom
has an interior, waiting to be explored. It pointed
the way to the new world within the atom that
has brought surprise after surprise to twentieth
century science.
Within five years it was understood that the
atoms of radium are unstable. One after another
they explode and in exploding give off three dif-
ferent types of rays called alpha, beta and
gamma, the first three letters of the Greek alpha-
bet. They, in turn, cause the generation of both
light and heat. The radium atoms are all iden-
tical, yet every second a very small proportion of
them suddenly breaks up, sending out particles of
matter, the alpha-rays, that turned out to be
atoms of helium.
Radium also emits electrons as beta-rays and
atom vibrations as gamma-rays that are even
more. penetrating than X-rays.
Whatever the amount of radium in hand, it dis-

Head, Division of Science Teaching, Unesco.
integrates at a steady rate, so steady that it would
form a perfect natural clock, for in every 1600
years half of the atoms disappear and half
remain. The production of rays is thus reduced
to one-half every 1600 years.
Later many other such radio-active elements
were discovered, each with a characteristic half-
life, some of which are measured in thousands
of millions of years, some in millionths of a
second, others in hours, days or a few short years.
No-one knows why some atoms of radium are
destined to explode today while others that are
identical so far as we know, will last for centuries.
It is a matter of chance, like winning a lottery.
It was the study of natural radio-activity that
paved the way to devising artificial radio-activity,
that is, methods of forcing atoms to disintegrate
and yield up their energy. It took almost fifty
years. In the course of those studies much was
learned about the ultimate particles that consti-
But the origin of the X-rays and how they are
formed in the electric discharge tube was not
'understood for many years. To explain them
required a knowledge of the nature of electricity
that did not exist at the beginning of the century.
Electricity had been used for a long time. Bat-
teries, motors, electric lights and even telephones
were in common use. How electricity acts was
well known ; what electricity is was a mystery.
It was Prof. R. A. Millikan at the University of
Chicago in the U. S. A. who gave the final answer
in 1909. Searching for the smallest quantity of
electricity that would still show electrical quali-
ties, he used not the usual electric current but
the static form, the charge on a small particle
of matter that causes it to attract or repel other
charged particles. In his final experiment he
used a microscopic droplet of oil which, by itself,
fell slowly downwards through the air of his
experimental vessel. Then he electrified it to the
least possible degree and held it suspended,
without falling, by an opposing electric force.
He found that there was a minimum charge
and, what is more, all larger charges on the oil-
drop were exact multiples of the minimum. It
The simplest method of accelerating electronic or nuclear particles is to allow them to stream through successive charged electro-
static plates each of which adds many hundreds of volts to the energy and the speed of the particle. The photograph shows the
interior of such a"linear accelerator art the Radiation Laboratory, University of California. The particles pass through tubes on left.
tute matter and the energy that Is associated
with those particles. The story ends today with
the giant cyclotrons that create such particles.
But to tell that story it is necessary here to start
afresh with several other aspects of the problem,
especially the nature of electricity and of light
vibrations, which weave into the story later.
In 1895, just one year before Becquerel in Paris
discovered radio-activity, Professor Roentgen at
Wiirzburg, Germany, discovered, quite by acci-
dent, that when a current of electricity is passed
through a tube that has been pumped out to a
high vacuum, one of the electric terminals gene-
rates invisible rays that go outward in straight
lines. Unlike light, these rays can penetrate not
only through black paper but through almost all
solid objects. Because of their unknown charac-
ter they were called X-rays.
Slowly it was proved that they were indeed
exactly the same type of etherwaves as light but
much shorter in wave-length. The waves of
visible light are about 0. 4 thousandths of a milli-
meter in length. X-rays are about 0. 1 millionths
of a millimeter. Still later it was found that the
gamma rays from radium are of the same type
but still shorter-only about 0. 01 millionths of
a millimeter. It is the shortness of the waves
that enables them to penetoo. te through solid
objects, much as small waves or ripples entering
a harbour pass between rows of stakes or piles
that stop the larger waves. Their use in medi-
cine is now well known and depends on their
going more easily through soft tissues than
through. solid bone, so that they show shadows of
bones and other solid objects in their path.
was a simple proof that electricity is not a"conti-
nuous fluid"but is itself composed of very small
pieces, all alike. They are now called electrons.
Just as matter is composed of atoms, so electricity
is composed of electrons.
That they are truly particles was proved by
measuring the force needed to deflect them from
their straight path when a stream of them passes
at high speed through a vacuum tube. The mass
proved uniform too and is equal to about half of
a thousandth of the mass of the lightest known
atom, that of hydrogen. It was the first particle
to be discovered that is smaller and lighter than
an atom. It is indeed incredibly small, for the
electric current that passes through a 100-watt
electric light bulb in a single second is composed
of 10 million million million electrons-ten
followed by 18 zeros !
Here was another revelation, ten years after
the discovery of radium, which opened another
window on the new world of extremely small
things. But the electron was at once accepted
everywhere as a perfect explanation of all elec-
trical phenomena. These tiny electrons are far
smaller than atoms and can pass readily among
and through them in a wire, for instance, and
thus form a current. A battery of any kind
merely pumps electrons into the battery pole that
is called negative, and a dynamo is a machine
to do the same.
The discovery of the electron also provided the
explanation for the origin of the mysterious,
penetrating X-rays. When a stream
of electrons, an electric current, (Cont'd on

Page 6. DECEMBER 1953 UNESCO ; OUR
FIRST STEPS IN OPENING UP THE ATOM
* ALPHA-RAY : One of the three types of
rays emitted by the radio-active elements. It
is the nucleus of a helium atom, composed of
two protons and two neutrons, with a net
positive charge of two.
* ATOM : The unit of chemical composi-
tion ; the smallest particle of a chemical
element capable of independent existence.
Atoms are chemically combined in various
arrangements to form the molecules of che-
mical compounds.
* BETA-RAY : Penetrating ray, composed
of electrons, ejected from radio-active atoms
at velocities sometimes almost equal to the
velocity of light.'
* CYCLOTRON : A device or machine in
which electrically charged nuclear particles,
such as protons, are forced to move in a
horizontal spiral path between the poles vf
a powerful electromagnet and to receive an
additional electrical impulse at each passage
around so that they gradually acquire high
speed and emerge as energetic nuclear pro-
jectiles.
* DEUTERON : A nuclear particle composed
of one proton and one neutron which forms
the nucleus of the atom of deuterium or
"heavy hydrogen".
. * ELECTRON : The fundamental particle of
electricity.
* ELECTRON-VOLT : The unit of energy in
the motions and transformations of electrons,
photons and nuclear particles. It is the
energy acquired, by an electron when it is
propelled by an applied voltage of one volt.
* GAMMA-HAYS : Extremely penetrating
rays from radio-active atoms, composed
essentially of vibratory waves like X-rays
but with waves less than 1/1000th of the
length of X-rays.
* HALF-LIFE : The period of time required
for any quantity of a radio-active element to
be reduced to half the original quantity by
the gradual disintegration of its atoms.
* ISOTOPES : DIfferent varieties of atoms
of a single chemical element ; they have the
same number of electrons at the surface,
therefore the same chemical properties, but
the composition of their nuclei is different
in the number of neutrons, so that different
isotopes of an element differ in the weight
of their atoms. Hydrogen and deuterium art
examples.
* MESON : A short-lived particle, either
positive or negative, and intermediate in mass
between an electron and a proton which was
discovered in cosmic rays and is now produc-
ed in the proton-synchrotron.
* MOLECULE : The smallest particle of any
substance or chemical compound that is
capable of independent existence. Molecules
are arranged side-by-side in crystals, near
each other at random in liquids, quite
separated from each other in gases.
* NUCLEUS : The dense core at the centre
of all atoms, with less than 1/10, OOOth the
diameter of the atom but containing all its
mass in the form of one or many protons
and neutrons closely packed together.
* NEUTR1NO : A hypothetical particle, not
yet actually observed, but believed to be form-
ed when a neutron disintegrates into a pro-
ton and an electron and also in certain
collisions of cosmic rays, to account for the
observed energy. They have no electric
charge and practically no mass.
* NEUTRON : One of the fundamental
components of all atomic nuclei (except that
of hydrogen). It has practically the same
weight as the proton but carries no electric
charge.
* PHOTON : The unit quantity of the energy
of light and similar wave-vibrations ; it has
some aspects of a particle of energy with
almost zero mass but can on collision with
an atom break up into a positive and a nega-
tive electron.
* POSITRON : Like the electron but is posi-
tively charged instead of negatively.
* PROTON : One of the basic components
of all atomic nuclei ; it carries a single posi-
tive charge. It is also the nucleus of the
hydrogen atom.
* PROTON-SYNCHROTRON : The most
powerful type of accelerator for nuclear pro-
jectiles which operates on the frequency-
modulation principle.
* RADIUM : One of the chemical elements,
discovered in 1898, with the unique property
of giving off alpha, beta and gamma-rays
from the nuclei of its atoms, and thus of
changing into a series of other elements and
eventually into lead.
* SYNCHROTRON : A machine suitable
for the acceleration of electrons to speeds
near that of light and to an energy level
which increases their mass (according to the
Einstein principle) so that the frequency of
the propelling electrical oscillation must be
modulated.
* V-PARTICLE' : The most recent of the
elementary particles discovered in cosmic rays,
produced in the high-energy accelerators.
Its exact nature is still unknown.
* X-RAYS : The rays, essentially wave-
vibrations, produced when electrons in a
vacuum tube are hurled under high voltage
against a metallic cathode. They are the
same type of wave-motion as ordinary light
but their waves are only 1/lCOOth the length
of visible light waves. They are invisible but
can penetrate through several centimeters (or
inches) of matter, depending on the voltage
with which they are produced.

up some of its energy to heat the wire. Electric
lights, heaters and pressing irons depend on this
fact. But when electrons pass through a glass
tube that has been partially evacuated, they col-
lide with the molecules in the remaining air to
make the gas glow. If the vacuum is very high
so that the electrons cross through the tube at
high speed, they collide with the solid wall oppo-
site. And when on that spot there is a metal
plate to form a target for the electrons to hit,
their high-speed collisions set up very rapid ether
vibrations-the X-rays-somewhat as hitting
an anvil with a hammer sets up sound waves. Now
the various new discoveries began to fit together
to give understanding.
Let us return now to the three types of rays
that are automatically generated by the atoms of
radium. The discovery and identification of the
electron at once explained the beta-rays and the
gamma-rays too. For it was soon found that the
beta-rays are nothing but electrons, streaming
naturally in all directions from every bit of
radium, while the gamma-rays, known to be like
X-rays, are produced partly as by-products when
the high-speed electrons in the beta rays bom-
bard the radium itself.
The atom of
heavy hydrogen
0. 02 per cent of
which is found
in all natural
hydrogen and
all natural wat-
er. Heavy hy-
drogen, or deu-
terium as it is
called, has a
neutron as well
as a proton
at its nucleus.
This explained part of the mystery of radium
but it also brought a new surprise. It meant that
there must be a store of electrons deep within
the atom of radium. Thus the atom cannot be a
hard, solid, ultimate particle but must be a com-
plicated structure composed partly of electrons
and with enough energy packed inside to propel
the electrons outwards in the form of beta-rays
almost at the velocity of light.
But it was the investigations of alpha-rays from
radium that finally revealed the structure of the
atom. The alpha-rays are not electrons nor are
they ether vibrations. They are composed of rela-
tively large particles. Measurement of the mass
of the particles by the same method that was
used with electrons-namely by measuring the
force necessary to bend them from their swift
straight path of flight-showed that they are
of atomic size, thousands of times heavier than
an electron.
They turned out to be, in fact, atoms of the gas
called helium. But not normal atoms, for each of
them had two charges of positive electricity. In
other words they lack two electrons-since an
electron is the unit charge of electricity and is
called'''negative''merely by an error of naming
in the early days when no-one knew what an
electric charge was. When the alpha particles
strike matter they quickly pick up two stray
electrons and become true atoms of helium.
Since the atom of radium must therefore
contain both electrons and helium atoms, and
ejects both of them at very high speed, the
radium atom began to appear complicated indeed.
The next step was the series of researches by Sir
Ernest Rutherford and his associates in England,
in which he allowed a very thin beam of alpha
particles from radium to strike a thin sheet of
gold. Some of them passed straight through the
solid metal ; many changed their line of flight
and were deflected from their original direction
by some form of elastic impact. A few of them
were reflected almost straight back to the direc-
tion from which they had come. When Ruther-
ford measured the number of helium atoms that
were reflected in various directions, he was forced
In the photograph on the left, alpha particles are
shown streaming through a cloud chamber. One
has hit a hydrogen nucleus, and since the alpha
particle has a mass four times as great, its path is
hardly affected at all. But the light hydrogen nucleus
is knocked out of the way towards the left. In the
right hand picture, an alpha particle collides with a
helium nucleus. These particles are identical in
mass, and it can be seen how they share the energy
of the impact and the fly off with equal deflections.
to the astonishing conclusion that most of the
helium atoms went through the metal sheet as
easily as if it were not there, but a very small
number hit a solid obstacle that repelled them.
The only explanation is that the sheet of solid
gold is not solid at all from the point of view of
a very small projectile like the alpha particle.
The gold atoms are nearly empty. Through this
emptiness of the gold atoms the alpha particles
penetrate quite easily. But there are some spots
in the gold atoms that are solid and impenetrable.
This conception of the atom of gold was new but
the facts could not be explained at all if the gold
sheet were made of solid atoms all in contact and
side by side. So what was it that the alpha parti-
cles hit ? Rutherford called it the nucleus, a very
small and very hard centre where all the matter
is concentrated and from which the alpha par-
ticles bounce. Unless the nucleus is hit, the alpha
particles easily go through the gold atoms.
The result is a wholly new picture of the atom.
At its centre is a small nucleus. At a considerable

distance from the nucleus are electrons distribut-
ed in orbits much like the planets around the
sun. In fact, the analogy of the solar system is
a good one, with the atom nucleus as the sun at
the centre, and electrons circulating far away.
But what is hard to realize is that the nucleus
is so very small. Its diameter is only 1/10, 000th
of the diameter of the atom. Thus the diameter
of the atom is 10, 000 times that of the nucleus.
If the nucleus were as large as a hazel-nut the
atom would measure 2/3 of a mile across. Yet
in that small central nucleus is all the'''matter''.
It is from the nucleus of the radium atom that
the alpha particles are ejected, and the beta rays
too. It was at once obvious that the nucleus is
not only very concentrated in matter but in
energy also. As so often happens in scientific
research, the exploration of the atom has only
deepened the mystery. Now the problem becomes
one of exploring the nucleus.
In considering the structure of the nucleus it
should be noted first that, electrically speaking,
it is"positively charged". This means, of course,
All the three isotopes of hydrogen have one proton and one electron. They differ only in the number of neutrons
in the nucleus. Protium (ordinary hydrogen) has none, deuterium (heavy hydrogen) has one, and tritium
(extra heavy hydrogen) has two. In these diagrams the orbit of the electron is much too close to the nucleus.
If it were drawn to scale and the nucleus were this big, the electron orbit would be at least 300 feet away.

The use of radium in medical treatments, especially for cancer, is well established, but limited and expensive. The cyclotron has led to the manufacture of
artificially radio-active isotopes of a long list of chemical elements. The photograph shows a patient at the Brookhaven National Laboratory, Upton, N. Y. in the
United States, which has the first hospital ever to be devoted exclusively to the medical effects and uses of atomic rays. A Geiger counter, a ! med at X
marked on patient's throat, is used to measure quantity of radio-active iodine, remaining in thyroid gland after a patient has been given an"atomic cocktail"to drin k.
only that electrons are missing. But the whole
atom is neutral, electrically. Thus the positive
charge on the nucleus is matched by the negative
electrons forming the atom's exterior layers.
It was mentioned above that the alpha particle
is a helium atom with two positive charges. That
can now be better said. The alpha particle is
merely the nucleus of the helium atom, without
the two external electrons that characterize the
atom of helium. Thus the radium nucleus merely
ejects a helium nucleus in its automatic explosion.
It is therefore easy to suspect that the helium
nucleus is one of the inherent components of the
nuclei of other atoms. But this is not quite the
case. The helium nucleus is itself complex. Space
does not permit a detailed description of all the
researches which led to the present conception of
the atomic nucleus. But the conclusion is that
one of the basic components of all atomic nuclei
is the nucleus of hydrogen not of helium.
Hydrogen is the lightest and simplest of atoms,
with only one electron at its surface and one
positive charge on its nucleus. Its weight is also
a unit, for the weights of all larger atoms are
simple multiples of the weight of the hydrogen
atom. It is the hydrogen nucleus, smallest and
simplest of all, that is the chief building stone.
All the larger atomic nuclei are built, at least in
part, from this unit. For this reason it deserves a
special name : it is the proton.
But it is not the only building stone. One more
particle must be introduced before the list of
major nuclear components is complete. That is
the neutron. It was the last to be discovered
because, oddly enough, it is not electrically
charged and therefore is very hard to detect. It
is of the same weight as the proton but it is not
positively charged. It must therefore somehow
contain an electron within it to make it neutral.
That one electron makes the only difference bet-
ween a proton and a neutron.
The word"within"is important here. A posi-
tive proton can be balanced by a negative electron
circulating in an orbit around it, like a planet
around the sun. This is the hydrogen atom. But,
if, somehow, the electron enters into the proton,
as if the sun had swallowed its planet, the result
is a neutron. Conversely, knocking an electron
out of a neutron converts it into a proton. But
such interference with the structure of protons
and neutrons is not easy. They are practically
untouchable except by the powerful cyclotrons
that are described in another article of this series.
The discovery of the neutron by Prof. Chadwick
in England came late-not until 1934. It proved to
be the key to many puzzles. It explained at once
what the alpha particle is as well as heavy water,
and gave a clear understanding of isotopes, as
will be shown in the next paragraph. It also
made possible the transformation of one type of
atom into another and thus paved the way not
only for transmutation but for the actual creation
of new chemical elements.
Heavy water, much in the scientific news in
recent years, is easy to understand. Water is, of
course, the oxide of hydrogen and heavy water is
merely the oxide of heavy hydrogen. The hydro-
gen atom as has been said, is merely a proton
with an electron circulating in an orbit about it.
The weight of this atom is essentially that of one
proton. But Prof. Urey in the United States dis-
covered a form of hydrogen whose atom weighs
twice as much, yet in all other properties is iden-
tical with ordinary hydrogen. In fact, there is a
small proportion of this heavy hydrogen in all
natural hydrogen gas and in all natural water.
The explanation came with the neutron, for the
nucleus of this type of hydrogen is a particle
composed of one proton and one neutron, inti-
mately and firmly joined. It thus weighs twice
the normal weight, but has only one positive
charge own the nucleus and therefore only one
electron at the surface of the atom. It is called
deuterium and its nucleus is a deuteron.
The two different forms of hydrogen, chemi-
cally alike, yet different in their nuclear struc-
ture, are known as isotopes. As nuclear research
advanced in the past ten years it became possible
not only to discover many natural isotopes of the
chemical elements but to create many hundreds
more that do not exist in nature. In some of them
the various unions of protons and neutrons are
not entirely stable so that they gradually break
up with the emission of energy in rays in exactly
the same way that radium disintegrates naturally.
These artificial radio-active isotopes have becomes
extremely useful in medicine, agriculture and
industry and are the topic of a later article in
this series.
The alpha particle that is ejected in the auto-
matic explosion of the radium atom is also
explained by the neutron. The alpha particle has
two positive charges and when it adds two elec-
trons it forms an atom of helium. But the weight
of this atom, and therefore of its nucleus, is four
times the weight of a proton. The explanation is
obviously that the alpha particle is composed of
two protons and two neutrons. This gives it a
weight of four units and two positive charges.
With this explanation of the mysterious alpha
particle the list of well-known fundamental par-
ticles of matter is. complete. Within the atom but
at the surface are the electrons, responsible for
its chemical properties. Deep within the atom is
the nucleus, thousands of times smaller than the
atom itself but containing all its'''matter''. It is
composed of protons and neutrons and must
somehow contain electrons too. In various combi-
nations the protons, neutrons and electrons make
up the nuclei of all atoms. In the radio-active
atoms, such as radium, the nucleus is unstable
and occasionally ejects one or another of its cons-
tituents and thus changes into a different isotope
or, indeed, into a different chemical element. So
the new facts and conceptions begin to fit into a
single picture which was inconceivable fifty years
ago but which now reveals a holly new world
within the atom.
But great underlying problems remain. What
holds the nucleus together ? Is the proton really
the ultimate particle, or does it have an internal
structure too ? How does an electron get into it
to make a neutron ? Whence comes all the energy
that propels the rays at such high speeds ? All
such questions were insoluble with the older tools
of science. They have been successfully attacked
in recent years with the great cyclotrons that are
described in the third article of this series. But
that would not have been possible had not valu-
able hints come literally from the sky. Cosmic
rays brought the clues to these mysteries and
paved the way for the cyclotrons. The following
article therefore takes a look at these very high
speed particles that bombard the earth from outer
space and come from no-one knows where.
These diagrams, in a study of atomic extremes, show the structure of the lightest atom, hydrogen, contrasted
with the heaviest atom, uranium. Hydrogen has only one proton in the nucleus and one electron spinning in
an external orbit. Uranium has 92 protons and 146 neutrons crowded together in the nucleus, and 92 external
electrons vibrating in complex orbits. In both diagrams the nucleus is much magnified. Its diameter sis actually
only 1/10, OOOth of the atom's diameter and thus it would only be an invisible speck at the atomic centre.

o THE HAIL OF COSMIC RAYS
FROM OUTER SPACE
m BALL lying still on a table is
. harmless ; the same ball
flying through the ir can be
dangerous and cause pain.
The difference is the energy of the
ball's motion. Is it the ball that
hurts when it strikes, or is it the
energy ?
What would be the effect of
throwing a package of energy alone,
with no ball ? It cannot ordinarily
be done because energy is normally
carried by pieces or particles of
"matter". In the case of molecules
and atoms if is usually the energy of
motion, even when it is felt as heat.
In the case of protons and electrons
it may be electrical energy.
But in the case of the particles that
are smaller than the atomic nucleus,
whether inside it or free in space,
energy is their outstanding property.
Only in motion or through some
form of energetic action can any of
the particles of nuclear size be detect-
ed and studied. It is thus in the
form of"rays"that these exceed-
ingly small particles come to man's
attention. In nuclear research the
subject of study is always a combi-
nation of matter-and-energy in
which the two are so closely related
that one may even turn into the
other.
The most energetic particle produc-
ed naturally on earth is the alpha
ray from radium, which is a helium
nucleus ejected at perhaps one tenth
of the velocity of light. How it gets
that speed and energy from within
the close quarters of the radium nu-
cleus is still a mystery. But if such
concentration of energy is rarely
found on earth, outer space, the
"empty"space beyond the earth's
atmosphere, bristles with it. The
study of these"cosmic rays"is one
of the most intricate and adventu-
rous of all modern researches and
can merely be sketched in a brief
article.
It began during the opening years
of this century when the British
Professor C. T. R. Wilson first sus-
pected that the gradual leakage of
static electricity from his well insu-
lated laboratory apparatus was due
to some unknown penetrating radia-
tion, like X-rays perhaps, originat-
ing outside the earth.
The Swiss scientist A. Gockel,
testing this idea in a balloon, found
in 1909 that the effect was in fact
stronger at an atti-
tude of 2i miles
(4. 300 metres). In
the next year the
Austrian V. F. Hess
confirmed this dis-
covery by ascend-
ing still higher to
5, 200 metres (3i mi-
les), and gave the
rays their present
name : cosmic. In 1913 the German
Kolhorster reached a height of six
miles (9, 000 metres) and found that
at that height the rays were 30 times
as intense as at sea-level.
Whence do they co. me ? An easy
guess is that their source is the sun.
But they are just as intense at night
as by day, even though at night the
entire great mass of the earth is in
their path-so they do not come
from the sun. From the stars of
our own galaxy, the Milky Way ?
That is possible, perhaps probable.
Or they may be produced by colli-
sions or explosions of individual
elementary particles in the empti-
ness of space itself. At present no-
one knows.
What is known is that the energy
that constantly reaches the earth in
this form is at least as great as the
energy of all the light from all the
stars-except the sun. We live in
a constant hail of cosmic rays.
Each human body is pierced more
than twenty times a second by these
rays-which, fortunately, are
harmless.
From where do they
come-the Milky Way ?
Nobody yet knows
What is astonishing about them is
their enormous energy. They are
certainly particles, most of them
protons, some of them the more
complex nuclei of helium atoms,
with a small proportion of the larger
nuclei of heavy atoms. But they
come to earth at speeds very close
to the velocity of light and with
energies that are measured in many
thousands of millions of electron
volts-or even millions of millions.
The electron-volt is the unit of
energy used for such individual
particles. Technically, it is the
energy acquired by one electron
when it is accelerated by a pro-
pelling voltage of one volt. To
knock an electron from an atom of
oxygen in the air requires about
30 electron-volts. Alpha-rays from
radium carry 4 to
10 million electron-
volts.
But for a cosmic
ray to enter the
earth's atmosphere
near the equator,
in defiance of the
earth's magnetism,
requires an energy
of at least 20 thou-
sand million electron-volts. These
are the feeblest of them. The most
energetic yet found have an energy
of a 100, 000 million times a million
electron-volts. These are energies
far beyond any other earthly expe-
rience.
How this energy is acquired some-
where in the depths of space is
quite unknown. Even if, for ins-
tance, an atom of helium were
completely destroyed, annihilated,
and changed into energy in accord
with the Einstein theory, that energy
would amount to only 4, 000 million
electron-volts. Another assumption,
made by the Italian Professor Fermi,
is that the energy is gradually built
up by the passage of the particle
through magnetic clouds of matter
in outer space which would accele-
rate a particle as a tennis racquet
speeds a flying ball.
But no theory of the source of
their energy is adequate ; the expla-
nation awaits further investigators.
It may well be that the problem
will not be solved until the rays can
be studied in an interplanetary roc-
ket far out in space or in a labora-
tory set up on the air-less surface
01 we moon.
Even more fasci-
nating is the story
of what happens
when these rays
strike the earth's
atmosphere and
drive downward.
Twenty years of
investigation with
the instruments of
modern nuclear physics have pro-
duced photographs of their tracks
in passing through air and through
interposed targets. They have been
measured on the tops of mountains,
in the depths of mines, under deep
water, and high in the stratosphere
by balloons and even in rockets.
They have revealed more of the
nature of matter and of energy than
would possibly have been believed
even ten years ago. Only the con-
clusions-as of now-can be told
here.
Out in space there may be rays of
relatively low energy. But those
that move with less than a thousand
million electron-volts are deflected
by the sun's magnetic field and
never get near the earth. Those that
do reach our vicinity and have less
than 60 thousand million electron-
volts are deflected by the earth's
magnetic field.
The very energetic particles that
drive toward the earth's surface in
spite of the magnetic field collide
with the atoms in the upper regions
of the stratosphere. In such colli-
In the universe of the
infinitely tiny every-
thing is astronomical
sions they lose part of the energy
and create whole showers of elec-
trons which in turn plunge toward
the earth. Such showers covering
many square miles of the earth's
surface were revealed by extended
measurements on high mountains
by the French Professor Pierre
Auger.But the showers also contain pho-
tons, which are uncharged units of
radiation energy, particles of light,
so to speak. These can disintegrate
into a pair of electrons, one positive
and one negative. This already
gives us two new particles, not
mentioned previously, the photon
and the positive electron, which is
quite like the usual negative elec-
tron, except that it is positively
charged. It was first discovered in
cosmic rays Dy tne
American Dr. Carl
D. Anderson in
1942.
But later several
other new particles
were discovered in
these rays. They
are known as me-
sons. They have
the charge of an
electron, some of them positive,
some negative. But they are inter-
mediate in mass between an elec-
tron and a proton. One variety has
a mass of 276 times that of an
electron, another of only 210. Their
existence was suggested theoreti-
cally by the Japanese mathemati-
cian H. Yukawa in 1935 and they
were discovered in cosmic rays in
hums.
But here lis another surprise : the
meson is a phantom particle in that
it exists for only a few millionths of
a second.. ten spite of their short life
they can be detected because, at
their high energy, they travel great
distances. They seem then to be
converted into high speed electrons,
and in the process give rise to still
another elementary particle, the.
neutrino.
By now the variety of particles in
or produced by the cosmic rays has
become too complex for anyone but
an expert to comprehend. Present
knowledge is in that rapid state of
growth when there are more ques-
tions than answers. When the
maze of particles are themselves
understood there will remain the
problem of how they are held toge-
ther in the atomic nucleus, which is
now seen to be a very complicated
particle indeed.
There is at this moment much
discussion as to the role of the
mesons in acting as a force bind-
ing the others together, hence acting
as a sort of glue within the nucleus.
The rays from the sky have
thus revealed unsuspected mysteries
within the nucleus itself. They are
very difficult to study because they
arrive uncontrolled from the outer
universe and are at their best high
in the stratosphere. To study parti-
cles of such high energy on earth
and in the laboratory requires that
the same particles be artificially
created and the cosmic rays thus
duplicated. This in turn requires
endowing them with much more
energy than any earthly particles
normally possess, literally thousands
of millions of electron-volts. To do
this is the function of the'giant
cyclotrons. The story of how it is
done is the subject of the next article
in this series.
One may note in passing that this
one short article has mentioned
pioneer cosmic ray researches in
Great Britain, Switzerland, Austria.
Germany, Italy, France, the USA
and Japan. Research is active in
this subject in many other lands, for
cosmic rays are everywhere. But
cyclotrons are expensive and re-
search with them not so widely
spread among the nations.
 Nuclear events (collisions
between high energy at-
omic particles and nuclei)
are revealed by the thin
white tracks shown in this
strip of photographs, made
at the Nevis Laboratory,
Columbia University, USA
Tracks of particles which
have been given a high
speed in a cyclotron are

ed every ten seconds.

stand more about the par-
ticles and how they are

cleus of the atom. Our

To learn more about the makeup and nature of the atom nuclei scientists bombard them with high energy particles. These are raised to phenomenal speeds in
accelerators such as the Cosmotron (above) at Brookhaven National Laboratory, United States of America, which is at present the largest machine of its kind
in the world. The huge'doughnut'-shaped magnet 75 feet in diameter guides the particles in a circular path while they are given a high speed by a succession
of electric boosts. In this Cosmotron, the particles circle the magnet 3, 000, 000 times and travel a total distance of some 138, 000 miles in less than a second.,

0 GIANT MACHINES AND MAN-MADE RAYS
THE world within the atom, as revealed by thenatural rays from radium and by cosmic
rays and briefly sketched in the two
preceding articles, is almost incredible from the
ordinary human point of view. This is not merely
because it is so complex but also because the basic
particles seem to have no relation to either matter
or energy as we commonly know them. The
appeal to curiosity and the desire to explore
further is almost irresistible.
The nucleus of the atom contains all the
"matter", yet is so small that it occupies only a
thousandth of a millionth of a millionth of the
space within the atom. In that case its density
(that is, its weight per cubic inch) must be a
thousand times a million times a million times
that of ordinary materials. As a matter of fact,
researches with the cyclotron, such as will be
described below, now indicate that the nucleus
itself is not at all a solid mass but has a still
denser core at its centre. Whatever that core is
made of, it is so dense that a lump of it as large
as a drop of water would weigh two million tons.
But that is only half of the astonishing
situation. Energy is similarly concentrated.
Within that exceedingly minute volume of the
atomic nucleus there are forces that hold the mass
together. The earth itself is held together by
gravity but the force within the nucleus must be
so much larger than gravity that there is no word
to express it. The force of gravity would have to
be multiplied by a number that contains the figure
1 followed by 37 zeros :

Gravity holds the planets in their courses and
the stars in the sky-but has no place in the
nucleus.
The whole atom is itself held together by
This star-like picture is the self portrait of an exploding nucleus of an atom, and is one of the most
significant milestones along the road of nuclear research. This nuclear"event"was photographed when a
very high energy particle, accelerated in the giant Cosmotron (top of page) hit the nucleus of an atom of the
film emulsion and exploded it into 17 particles of different types which flew out to form tracks in a star-shaped
pattern. Until this man-made nuclear collision took place the type of nuclear event pictured here had occured
only in the action of cosmic rays which, as they bombard the earth's atmosphere, produce the highest energies
which atoms have been known to release. (Photographs : Brookhaven National Laboratory, NewYork.)
electrical forces, since the positive protons at the
centre attract and hold the negative electrons at
the surface. But within the nucleus are protons
and neutrons which cannot be held together
electrically because the electric force between
them would not attract but repel them from each
other.
So the binding force within the nucleus is of a
new and unknown form. It is complicated and
depends on the velocity of the nuclear particles
and even on their spinning motion or rotation.
On the other hand the force, whatever it is, does
not depend on the electrical charges, for neutrons
and protons seem to attract each other to precisely
the same degree that they attract their own kind
of particle. This is the present mystery of the
nucleus and therefore of the atom and thus of
matter and energy in general.
Certainly this is the basic mystery of the
universe and one with which science cannot be
content. But to solve it requires methods. and
instruments never before conceived. What is
needed is a sort of nuclear microscope which would
permit gazing at the crowded infinitesimal
intimacy of protons and neutrons as the
astronomer gazes through his colossal telescopes
at the infinity of space.
Atom-smashers in action
BUT light waves are millions of times longerthan the size of the nuclear particles. There
is no way to probe into the nucleus that does
not pry it open or take it apart. To do that
requires concentrations of energy just as high as
those in the nucleus, and even higher. The
successful method is one which fires electrons and
protons at the nucleus at velocities very close to
that of light and loaded with energy amounting
to thousands of millions of electrons-volts. n is
for this reason that the devices that serve as
atomic or nuclear microscopes are often called
"atom-smashers".
It is not difficult to give these tiny projectiles,
electrons and protons, energy by giving them
speed because their electric charge propels them
if they are exposed to a high voltage. This was
first done in the tubes for generating very
penetrating X-rays. The higher the voltage
across the terminals of the tube, the higher was
the speed of the electrons and the more
penetrating the X-rays produced.
This led to the design of X-ray tubes operating

under a million volts. But in order to reach such
a voltage, it had to be applied step-wise. As the
electron passed down a long tube, it went through
a series of electrodes each of which added a few
thousand more volts to the pressure and therefore
to the speed of the electron.
But a million volts is not enough for penetrating
deep into the nucleus and it is not practical to
operate such a tube with more than a few million
volts. The next step taken was in effect to wind
the tube in the form of a spiral by means of a
magnetic field. There were, in fact, only two
electrodes, formed from a single hollow circular
box with a slit across the diameter. This gave
two electrodes, each shaped like a capital D, back
to back, with a narrow air space between them.
When the entire box of two D's was put between
the poles of a heavy magnet, then an electron
injected at the centre would normally travel in a
circular path, around and around.
But when voltage is applied to the D-shaped
box, the electron receives a kick each time it passes
through half the circle. When it thus goes faster,
it would travel in a larger circle because the
magnet is less able to turn its path. But it con-
tinues its flight, passing repeatedly through each
D, thus going ever faster and therefore describing
a larger and larger circle. In effect, its path
becomes a spiral. In the end, when it has
attained an energy of several million electron
volts, it reaches the outer edge and passes out
through a slit in the side wall at top energy.
Then it can be used to generate powerful X-rays
or for other experiments.
But the electron is a relatively light projectile.
When the heavier proton is similarly whirled to a
high velocity, its energy content should become
sufficient to counteract the binding forces in any
nucleus that it later hits. This was the principle
of the first cyclotron made by Dr. Ernest O.
Lawrence, of the University of California, who
received the Nobel Prize for Physics in 1940 for
this achievement. Many refinements have since
been added to the cyclotron and in its present
development it i. s called a proton-synchrotron.
The largest proton-synchrotron now in opera-
tion is-at the Brookhaven National Laboratory,
operated by the Associated Universities, Inc., under
contract with the United States Atomic Energy
Commission. From an auxiliary generator it in-
jects protons which carry 3. 6 million electron-
volts. These protons enter the great proton-syn-
chrotron in bursts at intervals of five seconds.
In less than a second they go around inside the
large circular magnet about 3 million times and
by then have reached an energy of 2, 300 million
electron-volts. The magnet has a diameter of
The proton bundle is now revolving around the
entire vacuum tank at a rate of 4 million times per
second (or 175, 000 miles per second, 90 per cent of
the speed of light). After about 3 million turns (in
0, 8 seconds)-the equivalent of four trips around the
earth-these protons have acquired the energy of
two thousand three hundred million electron-volts.
75 feet, so that 3 million circuits of the path
amount to a total distance of 130, 000 miles, which
is about four times the distance around the earth
and half the distance between the earth and the
moon. At that energy, they are ready for use.
A target piece, consisting of an extremely thin
sheet of metal, is interposed in the path. In
the violent collisions of these high energy protons
with the nuclei of the metal the atomic nucleus
is shattered. The resulting fragments emerge
from the cyclotron and can be photographed
in what is called a cloud chamber with results
such as are shown on the cover of this issue.
It looks like a picture of a catastrophe or like a
hurricane among the stars, but each white streak
is the path of one of the many types of rays or
of nuclear fragments. Each can be identified as
one of the constituents of the atomic nucleus. A
careful study of the photograph will show that
there are occasionally sharp breaks in the path
and some points where a path seems to cause
another explosion with two or three, or even four
particles darting out at various angles. This is
indeed another explosion, similar to those that
occur in the cosmic rays. In a sense, this photo-
graph shows a shower of artificial cosmic rays.
A'sixth sense'at work
THE photograph on page 9 shows a singlesuch collision, this time made by placing a
photographic plate directly in the path of
the rays. One of the high-energy particles from
the proton-synchrotron hit the nucleus of an
atom in the photographic emulsion in such a. way
that it exploded into no less than 17 separate
particles, which can be counted.
The careful study of photographs such as these
two gives the chief evidence of the existence of
such short-lived particles as the mesons and the
more recently discovered V-particles. Each track
must be analyzed for its degree of curvature, its
length and intensity, and its effectiveness in
producing branching rays. No human sense can
detect these particles. The combination of the
great proton-synchrotron and the photographic
plate is the"sixth-sense", or the nuclear micro-
scope, that reveals these deepest secrets of nature.
It is important, however, to note that the
shattering of nuclei is not the only effect of these
high-energy particles. In a large number of
cases the high-speed particle, whether it is an
electron, a proton, a deuteron or an alpha
particle, enters the nucleus which it hits and
remains combined with it and thus transforms
that nucleus to a new architecture which, in turn,
makes it an atom of a different element.
At this energy the protons hit a target (F) inserted
in their path. They collide with the target, and
nuclear fragments (such as neutrons) shoot out of
the magnet in a straight lihe. Detecting instruments
(G) such as a cloud chamber or geiger counter are
used by scientists to study result of collision of
these particles with various chemical elements.
In other cases the combination breaks down into
two smaller nuclei. Thus the high energy
particles of the cyclotron and the proton-synchro-
tron have been used to create not only new
isotopes of well known chemical elements but to
create elements that do not exist in nature. The
dream of the medieval alchemists, of making gold
from mercury and other common metals, has long
since come true, has indeed, been far surpassed.
A very common case of this kind is the creation
of isotopes of elements whose nuclei are only
partially stable and that gradually disintegrate
with the emission of rays like those from radium.
A long list of artificial radio-active elements has
thus become available. Some, like radio-active
cobalt, can be used as a source of rays in medical
uses, where radio-active cobalt has, in fact, now
largely replaced radium because it can be made
very cheaply. Indeed the uses of the radio-active
isotopes in medicine, agriculture and industry are
so varied and valuable that a separate article is
devoted to them later in this series.
The proton-synchrotron at Brookhaven has
been operating'only about a year and its results
have not yet been studied sufficiently for general
publication. It is expected, however, that with
further modifications, protons can with this
machine be given energies as high as 3, 000 million
electron-volts.
This energy, high as it is, is only at the very
threshold of the power needed for the study of
mesons, neutrinos, and the new V-particle, all of
whiah are still mysterious. In order to produce
an adequate stream of artificial mesons, a still
higher energy is needed. A proton-synchrotron
that can reach 6, 000 million electron-volts is at
the University of California. It is a colossus in
which the magnet weighs 10, 000 tons and the
power to energize the magnet is nearly 8. 000
horsepower (9, 000 kilowatts). The United States
Atomic Energy Commission has been asked to
build a still larger machine impart 15, 000 million
electron-volts to its proton projectiles.
But the most powerful of all is now being
planned for erection at Geneva for the European
Council for Nuclear Research. It is to provide
30, 000 million electron-volts. A new principle of
keeping the rays in the desired path will greatly
reduce the weight of iron needed in the magnet
so that this major item of cost will be much
reduced. As now planned the Geneva proton-
synchrotron will have a relatively thin or narrow
magnet but the diameter of the circle will be
about 1000 feet. No building would be big enough
to house it ; it will be buried in a large circular
underground trench. Details are discussed in the
next article of this series.

SYMBOL OF EUROPEAN
COLLABORATION FOR
NUCLEAR RESEARCH
WITHIN a single lifetime theatom has changed its aspect
completely. When Roentgen,
Becquerel and the Curies
discovered the X-ray (1895), radio-
activity (1896) and radium (1898)
no-one had considered that the
atom could have an interior. Less
than sixty years later, scientists del-
ve within the atomic nucleus and
discover the maze of fundamental
particles of matter and of energy
that have been reported in the
preceding articles : electrons and
positrons, protons and neutrons,
mesons and neutrinos.
These particles compose the atom
as atoms compose the earth and the
stars. All this new knowledge has
multiplied the majesty and the
mystery of the universe. It has had
terribly destructive uses as well as
enormously beneficial ones. But this
is only the beginning. Far more
will certainly be revealed in the next
fifty years than in the past fifty.
The scale and pace of research
have changed too. Roentgen and
Becquerel made their discoveries
almost accidentally by noticing that
photographic plates wrapped in black
paper, beyond the reach of light, had
been fogged by unsuspected ra-
diations from a vacuum tube in the
one case and from a small package
of uranium salts in the other. It
was, to be sure, no accident that they
investigated the cause of these
mysteries and thus made their great
discoveries.
A job for teamwork
IT was superb skill and vast pa-tience that enabled Pierre and
Marie Curie to track down the
"Becquerel rays"and to discover
their origin in radium. But those
epoch-making researches were done
in small, cold, university laboratories,
at Wurzburg and at the Sorbonne in
Paris, with a supply of plain dishes
and a few simple but accurate
instruments, designed and built by
the investigators themselves-plus
long hours of hard work, often at
night after professorial duties.
Those days are gone. Today the
frontiers of atomic science are so far
from the everyday world that it
takes large, expensive and organized
expeditions to reach them. A cy-
clotron for penetrating the nucleus
costs millions of dollars. To operate
it at thousands of horsepower costs
thousands of dollars per day and
requires the combined work of large
teams of physicists, chemists, ma-
thematicians, engineers, electricians
and also biologists and physicians.
The whole undertaking is so
expensive that no university any-
where can establish a modern
nuclear research laboratory without
the financial aid of its government.
And there are very few governments
in these days of economic strain that
can afford a major programme of
nuclear research. So most students
and scientists the world over have
little chance of participating in this
greatest scientific adventure of the
twentieth century. Yet the pioneer
work had been European.
The European Cultural Conference
meeting at Lausanne in 1949, first
recommended that specialized Euro-
pean institutes be established in
fields where the costs exceed the
resources of individual governments
and specifically urged the setting up
of such an institute in nuclear
physics. At the General Conference
of Unesco at Florence, Italy, in 1950,
Professor Isidor Rabi of Columbia
University in New York, proposed
that Unesco should take the lead in
bringing together European scientists
and governments to establish a
European centre for nuclear research
using their combined intellectual and
financial resources. Three years
later, in July 1953, the Convention
for the European Organization for
Nuclear Research, drawn up under
Unesco auspices, was signed at the
Ministry of Foreign Affairs in Paris.
It will be a reality when formally ra-
tified by seven nations.
The resolution passed by the
Unesco General Conference at Flo-
rence was, in fact, somewhat broader.
It authorized the Director-General
"to assist and encourage the for-
mation and organization of regional
research centres and laboratories in
order to increase and make more
fruitful the international cho 1-
laboration of scientists in the search
for new knowledge in fields where
the effort of any one country in the
region is insufficient for the task".
Thus Unesco has also sponsored
the establishment of an Inter-
national Computation Centre, pro-
bably to be located in Rome, where
modern electronic computers will be
available for the use of the scientists
of member nations. And, on the
other side of the earth, Unesco is
studying the possibility of an inter-
national research centre in oceano-
graphy in the Indo-Pacific region.
Twelve European nations have
taken part in the discussions and
planning and are expected to become
members of the European Organi-
zation for Nuclear Research. They
are : Belgium, Denmark, France, the
German Federal Republic, Greece,
Italy, the Netherlands, Norway,
Sweden, Switzerland, the United
Kingdom and Yugoslavia. Other
states may later be admitted to
membership by unanimous vote of
the member states. The cost is
estimated at 120 million Swiss francs
(28 million dollars, 10 million pounds
sterling) for the first seven years, in-
cluding construction and operation,
which will be provided by the
member states in proportion to their
average national Incomes.
Rivalling cosmic rays
WHILE the new organization willactively footer the co-operation
between separate national re-
search centres especially in nuclear
theory, it will have a central labora-
tory located on a site approximately
2, 000 feet square about three miles
northwest of Geneva, Switzerland,
and adjoining the French border on
land offered by the Geneva Canton.
A staff of about fifty experts, many
of them part-time consultants, has
been at work for a year and a half
on detailed plans for the buildings
and the powerful machines. The
Secretary-General is Professor
Edoardo Amaldi, professor of Ex-
perimental physics at the University
of Rome. The group responsible for
the design of the laboratory itself is
headed by Professor Lew Kowarski,
Scientific Director in the Atomic
Energy Commission, France, while
the Director of the theoretical group
is Professor Niels Bohr, Director of
the Institute of Theoretical physics
in Copenhagen.
There are also two special study
groups for the design of the two
major high-energy accelerators.
That for the 600 million electron-volt
synchro-cyclotron is headed by Dr.
C. J. Bakker, professor of physics at
the University of Amsterdam, and
that for the great 25 thousand
million electron-volt proton-syn-
chrotron is. under Dr. Odd Dahl,
Head of the Section for Applied
physic. s at the Michelsen Institute in
Bergen Norway.
The smaller of the two machines
will have ample power to generate
mesons for detailed study. It will
have an electro-magnet sixteen feet
in diameter, weighing 2, 500 tons and
fitted with two electric magnetizing
coils that together will weigh another
180 tons. It will be surrounded by a
thick concrete wall and covered by a
concrete roof. It will cost about
17 million Swiss francs (4 million
dollars, 1. 4 million pounds sterling)
and will take about four years to
build so that it should be ready for
operation in 1957 or 1958.
The proton-synchrotron, however,
will be far larger and more costly.
It will generate particles with ten
times as much energy as is provided
by any existing machine and will
embody a recently discovered prin-.
ciple for controlling them. It will
be the first machine to produce par-
ticles with as muc. h energy as is
carried by the cosmic rays from outer
space. No one can predict what it
will reveal but the experts have great
expectations of reaching the inner
secrets both of matter and of energy.
Its great magnet will be relatively
small in cross-section but will form
a circle some 650 feet in diameter,
buried in a deep trench in the earth
and covered with thick concrete.
Each time a high-speed particle goes
around the ring it will travel nearly
- 2. 000 feet and in half a million
circuits-which would require only a
little more than a second-it will
travel as far as from the earth to
the moon, at practically the velocity
of light. Emerging then it will be
the most energetic projectile ever
produced by man.
The proton-synchrotron will cost
about 55 million Swiss francs (12. 8
million dollars, 4. 5 million pounds
sterling) and will probably take
seven years to build so that it will
not be ready for use until 1960.
It is important to mention that the
Convention of the European Organi-
zation for Nuclear Research states
that its purpose is"to provide for
collaboration among European States
in nuclear research of a pure scien-
tific and fundamental character".
Also, it.'shall have no concern with
work for military requirements and
the results of its experimental and
theoretical. work shall be published
or... made generally available".
This means that its work will have
no relation to war and none of its
results will be secret but will be the
property of mankind. It will, in
fact, be the beginning of a new era
in science, one of maximum co-
operation among scientists across
national and linguistic borders, and
a common peaceful effort to master
the secrets of nature in order to in-
crease the resources of humanity.
A model of the future European Laboratory for Nuclear Research which will house the world's most powerful instruments to explore matter and energy at
Meyrin, near Geneva. The centre's proton-synchrotron (A) will be the largest of its kind in the world. Its giant magnet (some 600 feet in diameter) is buried in a
concrete filled trench. The building to house another giant machine, a synchro-cyclotron is shown at B. Remaining buildings (C) are laboratories and workshops.

NESCOURIER
ølSOTOPES
RADIO-ACTIVE ATOMS FOR EVERYDAY USE
WHEN America was discovered
in 1492 the first reaction of
the civilized world was
astonishment at the revelation that
so great a continent, so peopled
with strange tribes and so wealthy
in resources, had always been there,
quite unknown to Europeans. The
world suddenly became much larger
than anyone had thought and, far
from being fist, was soon shown to
be a globe when Magellan sailed
completely around it. Then came
the great stories of adventure and
exploration, which lasted for a
century. Then came settlements in
the new land, and colonies and
finally the great nations that now
comprise one-tenth of the human
race.
The history of most discoveries in
pure science is similar. First the
interest is philosophical and lies in
the further revelation of the
complexity and glory of nature.
Then it becomes an absorbing story
of conquest and understanding.
Finally the new knowledge becomes
useful and valuable to human living.
So it is with nuclear science.
The preceding articles in this
series have explained the funda-
mentals of the new knowledge of the
world within the atom. It remains
to discuss its uses which are already
large and diverse. Although they
are still in their infancy, they are
enough to prove that this is one of
the great discoveries of all time,
comparable to the invention of the
microscope and of the steam engine,
in its benefits to science and to
humanity.
But the most impressive, yet
terrible single use, and one which
cannot be ignored, is in military
explosives. This use is dominant in
the minds of men because of its
awful threat to humanity but, from
a broad point of view, it was a
development of only one aspect of
the new knowledge forced by
military necessity. It is an accident
of history that the discovery that
energy can be obtained from one
special type of atom came just at
the moment when the greatest war
of history began. But in the long
run the year 1939 may well be better
remembered for the discovery of
atomic energy than for the inception
of World War II..
The studies of nuclear structure
that have here been described all
involve the use of tremendous
energy concentrated in high-speed
particles in order to form a very
few tiny nuclear fragments. It is a
vast expenditure of energy with no
gain.
But there is one case in which an
atom, thus disintegrated by a colli-
sion with a neutron, gives out more
energy than it receives. That is the
case of the relatively little known
metals, uranium and thorium. It is
their excessive energy that can be
utilized for destruction. Whether or
not it will ever again be so used we
do not know, but it is quite certain
that it will be employed on a large
scale for peaceful purposes. An age
of atomic energy in industry lies
ahead, at least in those countries
that have no resources in coal or
petroleum.
One pound = 1, 500 tons
IT is now well known that onepound of uranium can yield as
much power or heat as 1, 500
tons of coal. But this does not mean
that energy from this source is
cheaper than energy from coal.
Even if the uranium cost nothing
at all, the cost of its energy would
still be high because of the very
large and expensive equipment that
i. s needed to generate it. Wherever
coal or oil are cheap, hence where-
ver they are close at hand, they wilJ
remain the chief source of industrial
power. But where coal is costly be-
cause it must be transported long
distances, atomic fuel is economical,
even now.
While the direct use of atomic
power is still in the future thre are
already literally thousands of
valuable uses for the rays and for
the materials that have been made
commonly available by the progress
of nuclear physics. Industry, agri-
culture, medicine and the biological
sciences are making large use of
them in the form of isotopes-those
WHEN DEALING with radio-active
chemicals on a laboratory scale,
a wall of two-inch-thick lead bricks
offers sufficient protection against
dangerous rays emanating from such
materials. More elaborate precau-
tions are needed in large scale
atomic energy plants. Here, at the
Atomic Energy Research Establish-
ment, Harwell, England, students see
a demonstration of how a chemical
can be put into an isotope container
with tongs. Lead containers are used
for the transportation of isotopes.

MOST ISOTOPES are stored in
liquid solutions. Technicians operate
by overhead mirror, behind two-foot
concrete wall (Radio-active waves shoot
sideways but not vertically). Bottles
are filled, packed and withdrawn by an
ingenious"master-slave"manipulator,
a remotely controlled device which
can duplicate the motion of a hand.

isotope will be shipped, is protected

elements that are not found in
nature but are produced by nuclear
collisions in the cyclotron or by
neutrons emitted by uranium in the
atomic furnaces.
More than 32, 000 shipments of
radio-active isotopes and more than
2, 000 shipments of non-radio-active,
or stable, isotopes have been made by
the U. S. Atomic Energy Commission
to more than a thousand institutions
in the U. S. A. and 1, 600 shipments of
radio-isotopes have been made to
some 350 institutions in 33 other
countries. Many industrial firms
and thousands of physicians the
world over are making daily practical
use of them.
Industrial applications
A typical industrial use of the rays
from these radio-active mate-
rials is in the automatic con-
trol of the production of thin sheets
of paper or plastic, or the metal for
making tin cans. As the sheet leaves
the rollers which squeeze it to the
desired thickness, it passes through
an instrument that holds a small
amount of radio-active material
under the sheet and holds a detect-
ing instrument, such as a Geiger
counter, over the sheet. The rays
penetrate the sheet and are received
and detected on the other side.
But if the sheet for some reason
becomes either thinner or thicker
than is desired the amount of
radiation received by the detecting
instrument instantly increases or
decreases as a result, because it is
partly absorbed in the sheet. Thus
the instrument is a constant and
automatic inspector of the thickness
and it can easily be adjusted to
regulate the rollers and correct the
error so as to produce a sheet of
uniform thickness.
Another example of the direct
industrial use of the radiations from
isotopes is the control of the flow
of oil through long pipe-lines. Such
a line can seldom be used for long
periods to deliver one single grade
or variety of oil. Instead, different
oils are pumped through, one after
another. It is important for the
operators at the receiving end to
know when one grade or one ship-
ment is at an end and another is
to begin in the continuous flow of
oil from the pipe.
This is now done by mixing in a
small quantity of radio-active oil at
the boundary between one batch and
another as they are pumped into the
pipe. When that radio-active oil
reaches the receiving station, per-
haps hundreds of miles away, the
radiation counters immediately
detect its arrival so that valves can
be adjusted to shift the flow from
one tank into another.
Another example from the oil
industry illustrates the use of
isotopes in research. The Shell
Petroleum Company in England now
measures friction and engine wear
by exposing a piston ring to bom-
bardment by neutrons until a small
part of the iron is converted to a
radioactive isotope. The ring is
then fitted in an operating engine..
As it wears by friction the debris
goes into the crank case oil and that
oil is then pumped through a
sensitive detector of radiation. The
very small quantity of weakly radio-
active iron is sufficient to be
measured and therefore to give an
immediate indication of the amount
of wear on the engine. This
method of testing avoids the long
operation of the engine and the
troublesome analysis of the oil for
iron, and can show the effect of
different lubricants within minutes.
The California Research Corpora-
tion reports that in similar resear-
ches a programme of friction studies
that would have taken 60 years and
cost a million dollars was completed
in this way in four years at a cost
of thirty-nave thousand dollars.
Others have employed this method
to show that high speed driving on
the open road causes
only about one-third of (Cont'd on

result of these researches, however,
is the reduction of friction and the
improvement of lubrication.
The rays from radio-active isoto-
pes are also directly effective in
causing the luminescence of cry-
stalline materials used on watch
dials and on out-door signs. These
cheap isotopes have now replaced
expensive radium for this use, Ano-
ther application is in the ordinary
fluorescent tube. When isotopes are
mixed with the luminous material
they increase the conductivity of the
air in the tube so that it requires
less voltage to start the lamp and it
starts much more quickly. A similar
use is made of a tube of such ma-
terials, weakly radio-active, where
there is danger of sparks from static
electricity. The faint rays make
the air a sufficient conductor of
electricity so that static does not
accumulate.
For the future, one of the most
promising uses is likely to take the
form a semi-permanent low-power
electrical generator. One of the iso-
topes of strontium, spread on an
electrode in a vacuum tube, emits
electrons, hence emits negative elec-
tricity and itself becomes positively
charged. A voltage as high a. s
365, 000 volts has thus been obtained.
Experiments are in progress to uti-
lize this generation of electricity to
operate a small direct current mo-
tor which would require no other
source of power.
Bacteria-killing rays
IN other industrial plants, the! penetrating rays from isotopes
are now replacing complicated
X-ray methods for testing the struc-
ture of metal parts. In still another
application they are used to measure
the height of liquids in tanks by
having an isotope in a float on the
surface and reading the position of
this float by the rays that are
emitted through the tank walls.
This method can even be used to
measure the height of molten metal
in a foundry tank.
The radioactive isotopes described
in the above examples are only
faintly radioactive, sufficient to be
detected by the right instrument but
not sufficient to do harm to living
things. But extremely powerful
isotopes are also available. In the
case of the metal cobalt, for instance,
it is possible to obtain an isotope
thousands of times stranger than
radium itself, so that a small
tumbler of the material gives as
powerful a radiation as a whole
kilogram of radium.
In such strength, the rays can be
used to destroy bacteria and even
larger forms of life. One of the most
interesting possibilities therefore is
the sterilization of drugs, medical
supplies, and foods merely by expos-
ing them to the rays from this form
of cobalt for a few seconds or
minutes. Complete sterilization can
be obtained without the use of heat,
a point which is very important in
the case of drugs that are decompos-
ed by heat and for many foods
whose composition and flavaur are
changed by the usual processes of
sterilizing by cooking.
Perhaps the most immediate use
of this process is in the manufacture
of penicillin, the drug that is now
so widely employed for the cure and
prevention of infectious bacterial
diseases. The total annual produce-
tion of penicillin per year is now
worth well over a hundred million
dollars (36, 000, 000 pounds). Since the
drug is used in the human body, it
must be completely free from living
organisms, yet it cannot easily be
sterilized by heat without partial
decomposition. As soon as the cost
of radio-active cobalt becomes
somewhat less than at present, many
kilogrammes bf it could be put to
work for the sterilization of this
drug.
The production of radio-active
cobalt would have to grow still larger
and become still cheaper before the
same process could be used for the
sterilization of foods. In this case,
a source of very penetrating rays
would be used which would com-
pletely sterilize the interior of a cut
of meat or of a large vegetable.

of their flavaur and their lack of

RADIO-ACTIVE ISOTOPES are now being used in mazing ways in industry,
medicine, agriculture and the biological sciences. This photograph shows
an isotope which is being used to strain out the nicotine from cigarettes.

radio-active isotopes without affect-
ing the flavour and would remain
sterile if.. their surface were protect-
ed.
An even larger possible use is the
sterilization of fresh fruits or vege-
tables. These at present remain
fresh for only a very short period.
If they were sterilized cold by radia-
tion they would retain their flavour
and, if properly packaged, would not
spoil for long periods of time. They
could be sterilized immediately after
picking and retained on the market
for months afterwards.
Rejuvenated pastures
ANOTHER utilization of thissame method is the destruc-
tion of organisms on the sur-
face of foods. The skin of the fruit
is the usual source of spoilage
and provides an almost ideal
medium for the growth of bacte-
ria. It would be a relatively simple
matter to sterilize the skin and
outer surface without the use of
heat. This system could be applied
to fresh tomatoes, apples, peaches,
melons, nuts, eggs, cucumbers,
grapes, and oranges. Since only the
surface would be sterilized, they
would not remain fresh for months
but they could be kept for several
weeks before being sold or eaten. It
would also be applicable in the case
of packaged foods, such as bakery
products, which in some countries
are now sold in plastic or paper
wrappers. A surface treatment with
radiation would preserve them.
The production of radio-active
isotopes of this strength is not yet
sufficient for these uses and the cost
is also at present too high, but the
advantage to the food industry in
cold sterilization may make it pos-
sible to produce isotopes for this
purpose in huge volume and at low
cost. When atomic fuels are used
for the generation of large quantities
of power in industry, very great
amounts of these radio-active isoto-
pes will become available as by-pro-
ducts.
There is no direct application of
these powerful rays in agriculture,
biology, or medicine except in cases
where destruction is desired, such as
the eradication of a cancer. But the
use of radio-active isotopes in these
sciences is nevertheless enormous by
quite a different technique. This
consists in using the chemical ele-
ments that occur in animals, plants
and plant foods, with a very small
admixture of the radio-active form
of the same element.
For example, phosphate is a neces-
sary plant food and is a component
of nearly all fertilizers. It is an easy
matter to produce the isotope of
phosphorus that is weakly radio-
active and to mix it with the normal
phosphate in the fertilizer. Since it
constantly gives off a weak and
harmless radiation that can be
detected by proper instruments, it is
a very simple matter to follow or
trace what happens to the phos-
phorus in the soil and in the plant.
Used in this way, phosphorus would
be called a"tracer".
Important agricultural information
has thus been obtained. For ins-
tance, Swedish investigators have
found that phosphate in a fertilizer
is taken up by the plant roots almost
immediately when it is spread on the
soil ; there is no delay. American
investigators have discovered that
pasture grasses can take up phos-
phate that is spread over their leaves
and roots, so that old pastures can be
rejuvenated by phosphate without
the need for ploughing.
Even more interesting is the fact
that maize, sugar beets, tobacco and
cotton take up phosphate from the
fertilizer only during the early stage
of growth. Fertilizer spread on the
soil late in the season is of no value
to these crops. On the other hand,
potatoes take up phosphate from the
fertilizer in large quantities through-
out their entire growing season.
Finally, it has been found that
phosphoric acid added to irrigation
water is just as effective as fertilizer
spread dry on the soil. All of these
results were obtained by. measuring
the amount of radio-active phos-
phorus detected in the growing

GENERAL VIEW from the air of a field at Brookhaven National Laboratory, New York, used for plant experiments with nuclear radiation. Maize and other crops
are planted in circular furrows around a central source of radiation, radio-cobalt. Mutations and other changes in cell structure of plants are induced by exposure
to gamma rays emitted by the radio-active cobalt. Scientists are studying results which may eventually lead to improved strains of maize and also other vegetables.
plant. While its quantity is small,
like the black sheep in a flock, it can
reliably be used for measuring the
fate of all the phosphorus.
Many other tracer elements util-
ized in this manner have given
information of value to the farmer.
Radio-active potassium, painted on a
branch of a dormant plum tree, in
weather below freezing point, was
found to enter the sap and move
several feet both up and down the
branch in spite of the fact that the
sap is supposed to be motionless in
winter. On the other hand, in
summer the phosphorus moves all
the way to the roots within twenty-
four hours.
Another agricultural application
of this tracer technique with radio-
isotopes is in the study of insects
and fungi. Radio-iodine has been
used to study the spread of the oak
wilt fungus, through the roots and
from the roots of one oak to another.
Insecticides also can be tagged with
radio-isotopes. Thus it has been
shown that plant leaves absorb in-
secticides principally on their under
surface and do so only during the
day. Such work has also emphasiz-
ed the difference between broad-
leafed plants and narrow-leafed
grain and grasses in their reponse
to such weed-killers as 2, 4-D. A
broad-leafed plant absorbs a weed-
killer sprayed upon it and within
two hours the entire plant is per-
meated with it. On the other hand,
the grasses absorb very little weed-
killers and what is absorbed stays
on the spot without affecting the
plant as a whole.
Replacement for radium
EVEN mosquitoes can be tracedby radio-isotopes. Mosquito
larvae that swim in a very
weak solution of radio-phosphorus
remain radio-active all through
their lives and their presence can be
detected with Geiger counters. The
habits of mosquitoes are now being
studied by this method to learn how
long they live, how far they fly, and
what they feed on. It is expected
that similar treatment of birds may
give reliable information on bird
habits and especially on their migra-
tions.
The use of the powerful tissue-
destroying rays from radium is
established in the treatment of
cancers. They have the same effect
as equally powerful X-rays but a
cancer can often be reached with a
small pellet or tube of radium that
cannot well be reached by X-ray
tube. The new radio-isotopes can be
used in exactly the same way, but
with the advantage that the amounts
of radiation that can be obtained
from them are far larger than in the
case of radium and they cost less.
The commonest substitute for ra-
dium is radio-cobalt. A small
cylinder of metallic cobalt gives
gamma rays equal to that of radium
costing several hundred thousand
pounds sterling. Such a piece of
cobalt, weighing little more than an
ounce is enclosed in heavy metal but
an intense beam of radiation is di-
rected through a small window at
the cancerous growth.
In other forms, both radio-phos-
phorus and radio-gold are very
conveniently used for this type of
treatment. For skin cancers, an
ordinary blotting paper is soaked
with radio-active phosphate solution
and when dry it is cut to the size
and shape of the tumor, then is
strapped to the tumor with adhesive.
Radio-cobalt can be drawn out into
a fine wire or cut into tiny beads
which can be placed within the
cancerous growth. And radio-gold
can. be formed into tiny grains which
are fired directly into the cancer
from a small"gun". In both cases
they remain in the cancer until it is
destroyed.
In another method of treatment,
the radio-isotope can be given inter-
nally or can even be swallowed to
find its way into the blood stream.
It tis absorbed from the blood by
cancerous tissue. This is one of the
respects in which cancer differs from
ordinary tissue : it does absorb the
radio-isotope. Consequently, one
disease, in which the red blood cells
are formed lin such profusion as to
clog the blood vessels, can be treated
by radio-phosphorus which sharply
reduces the production of red blood
cells in the body for a period of about
a year.
Body-building revealed
THE element iodine is freely ab-) sorbed by the thyroid gland
which uses it to make the hor-
Imone called thyroxine. In patients
whose thyroid gland is too active, so
that it produces too much thyroxine,
part of the thyroid was formerly
removed by surgery. Nowadays, a
glass full of a solution of radio-io-
dine serves the same purpose since
iodine is absorbed in the gland and
there emits its rays which destroy
the excess thyroid tissue and active-
ty. This is, however, not a cancerous
condition and cancer of the thyroid
is in fact not easily treated with
radio-iodine.
In a few such uses, radio-isotopes
have been extremely valuable. How-
ever, their chief use in medicine is
not for treatment but for research,
where the purpose is to trace the
course of chemical and physiological
processes in the body. The isotopes
used are those that give weak and
harmless rays that can easily be
detected by the proper sensitive ins-
truments. In some cases isotopes,
are used that are not radio-active,
heavy water, for example, and must
be detected by more complicated
methods
One of the first results of the
use of"tracer"isotopes was the dis-
. covery that all the tissues in the
body are in a constant process of
, replacement. It is natural to think
of the body as a stable structure
which uses food only to maintain its
heat and for replacement of worn
parts. This is not so. When fats, in
which some of the hydrogen atoms
have been replaced chemically by
"heavy hydrogen"are eaten, the
new fat is deposited in the fatty
layers of the body while the older
fats, already in the body, are burn-
ed for heat.
So, too, eating proteins which
contain"heavy nitrogen"results in
the use of the fresh protein for
building body tissues, muscles and
blood cells, while the proteins al-
ready present are oxidized and
excreted. Every part of the body is
thus constantly being rebuilt by a
steady exchange of new materials
from food to replace the established
materials.
In a relatively short time, a matter
of weeks or months, every human or
animal body is completely rebuilt.
Even the bones are thus rebuilt and
the only exception is the iron, chiefly
in the red blood cells, which is not
rapidly replaced by new iron atoms
in the food. This process is a funda-
mental to life, but would probably
never have been discovered without
the use of tracer isotopes.
Animals and plants can seldom
distinguish between ordinary atoms
and the unnatural isotopes. The
fact that there are now more than
six hundred different isotopes avail-
able, some of them in large quan-
tities, has made possible the in-
vestigation of a very large number
of biological reactions, so that the
tracer technique has provided
almost as much information about
living things and the life process as
did the microscope during the first
few centuries after its invention.
This is partly because an isotopic
atom can be followed through a
lbng succession of changes.
For instance, the actual function
of vitamins and how they do their
work in nutrition has recently
become entirely clear by this
method, though it is too long a
story to tell here. One example is
the addition of radio-cobalt to the
culture medium on which the mould
Streptomyces griseus is grown. The
mould takes up the isotopes and
uses them to manufacture vitamin
B-12 and they can be detected by
their rays both in the mould and
in the vitamin that is

DATING THE PAST WITH NATURE'S CLOCK
(Continued from previous poge)
active vitamin can be used in the
food of human beings and its fate
in the chemistry of the body traced.
The most promising investigation
of this sort is the study of the pro-
cess by which green plant. s build
their substance from the water and
carbon-dioxide of the air. This
reaction is the fundamental one for
all life since all the green plants de-
pend upon it and all other plants
and all animals depend on the green
plants. It is apparently a simple
reaction in which the molecule of
water and that of carbon-dioxide
are combined, lose some oxygen, and
form sugars, starches, cellulose, and
more involved chemical materials.
Nevertheless, no one knows how
the plant does it and man is unable
to duplicate the reaction. But the
availability of a faintly radio-active
isotope of carbon has already given
much information and may withinthe next year or two
explain the reaction
completely. This will
not mean that man
can dispense with
plants for food pro-
duction, but it may
well mean that the
food production by
plants can be greatly
improved ounce this
reaction is understood.
The process involves
the formation of car-
bon-dioxide gas from
carbon which contains
a small proportion of
the radio-active isotope
of carbon. The pro-
duct is"heavy carbon-
dioxide"but is used by
plants in the presence
of sunlight exactly as
they use ordinary car-
bon. The results is
that the radio-active
carbon is built into the
materials of the plant
and its presence and
location in the plant
can be detected im-
mediately. When the
green leaves of certain
plants were thus ex-
posed to radio-active
carbon-dioxide for only
one minute, at least
fifty separate c o m-
pounds were found in
the leaf, tagged with
radio-carbon. When
the time of exposure to
sunlight was reduced
to two seconds, the leaf
had already manu-
factured two or three
compounds from the
carbon-dioxide of the
air.
It turns out that the
first products made by
the'plant are com-
pounds of phospho-
glyceric a c i d which
thus are shown to be
steps in the manu-
facture of fruit, or
grain, or sugar. After
two minutes of ex-
posure, radio-carbon
tests showed that even
proteins and fats
already contained the
new carbon just received from
the atmosphere. The detailed in-
vestigations of these reactions are
now in process and the full mecha-
nism of this basic plant reaction
should be understood very soon.
By studying the process in diffe-
rent plants it is now known that the
early stages of the reaction are iden-
tical in all plants. Only later does
the process diverge into the produc-
tion of compounds that are charac-
teristic of each plant, such as aro-
mas, colours, and drugs. In the case
of the green algae, it has thus been
possible to divert the reaction among
the algae so that either a preponde-
rance of sugar or of malic acid can
be formed early in the process.
On Ithis basis, the experiments
have now been continued to show
that the same algae which normally
contain about 50 % of protein can
be so altered as to produce about
75 % of fat instead of protein. In
fact, the protein content can be
varied all the way from 7 % to 88 %,
while the fat content can be changed
from 1 % to 75'%. At the same time,
the carbon-dioxide can be changed
from 6 % to 38 %.. This obviously
opens enormous possibilities for
changing and increasing the food
supplies available both to animals
and to human beings.
One more chapter must be added
to the achievements of the radio-
isotopes, namely that they have
provided a new measure for histo-
rical time. They have given answers
to questions on the age of trees and
of long-buried animals, of human
skeletons and of human structures of
centuries ago. They have dated the
Ice Age and are capable of fixing
closely the dates of many events
within the last 30 thousand years.
The method is based on the fact
that there is a very small but defi-
nite proportion of the heavy radio-
active isotope of carbon in all the
carbon dioxide of the atmosphere.
Since all plants build their tissues
from that carbon dioxide and all
animals breathe it, the proportion of
radio-active carbon to ordinary car-
'even the organic material of mud.
Using this method, scientists at
the University of Chicago have
found that charcoal left from the
ancient settlement of Shaheinab
near Khartoum (Sudan) is from
trees which were growing 5, 060 years
ago, while shells of bi-valves found
in the same place were taken from
the sea 5, 446 years ago. At Jarmo, in
Irak, is a site of an ancient village
which shows the earliest traces of
granaries and of a food producing
economy. These were shown to be
6, 695 years old. A Mayan lintel was
carved 1, 470 years ago, while the fa-
mous Stonehenge in England is
dated at 3, 800 years ago, thus nearly
2, 000 years B. C. A pair of rope san-
dals in so good a state of preserva-
tion that they look as if they had
been thrust aside only yesterday
were found in a cave in Oregon,
(U. S. A.). A test showed they were
9, 000 years old.
Another recent question was the
A VESSEL containing radio-active cobalt set into a tank of water is here photographed wholly by the
luminescence of the water itself when excited by the powerful gamma rays from the cobalt. It is these
rays that largely replaced those from radium in cancer therapy because cobalt is relatively cheap.

bon in all living things is the same
and is as well-known scientific fact.
As soon as an animal or a plant
dies, the exchange of carbon with its
surroundings ceases and many are
buried and partly preserved.
As soon as this happens, a slow
change in the proportion of the two
isotopes occurs. The radio-active
isotope gives off its rays and becomes
inert so that it can no longer be
detected. But this is a slow process.
Any amount of radio-active carbon
is reduced to half the original quan-
tity in 5, 568 years, then to half of'than, therefore to a fourth of the
original, in another 5, 568 years. In
the course of about 30 thousand
years what remains is too small
to measure.
Within those 30, 000 years, however,
it is possible to measure the radio-
activity of the carbon present, to
compare it with the total carbon and
thus to get an estimate of the date
at which the plant or animal died.
By this method it is now possible to
fix the exact date when there was
life in buried skeletons, the wood
found in old structures, the charred
remains from prehistoric fires, and
age of a manuscript scroll of the Old
Testament book of Isaiah. Was it
written in the days of the Old Tes-
tament or was it a medieval forgery ?
Analysis proved that it was written
some 2, 000 years ago but it could
not be decided if it had been written
before or after the life of Christ.
The oldest date for human life so
far fixed in this way is the Lascaux
cave in southwest France, site of
the famous paintings of the extinct
woolly mammoth. Analyses proved
that this cave was inhabited and
used by man about 15, 500 years ago.
On the other hand, there are remains
of the flesh and hair of the ancient
super-bison in Alaska which are
older than 28, 000 years, yet the flesh
is in sufficient preservation so that
arctic dogs have eaten it.
Perhaps the most surprising dis-
covery relates to the circulation of
the water in the oceans. At the
surface ocean water contains the
normal proportion of radio-carbon
and ordinary carbon but in the arctic
regions the surface water sinks and
is known to move slowly along the
ocean bottom toward the tropics, so
that there is a constant circulation.
glacial period, the sea
level was about 80 feet
lower than now ; 9, 000
years ago, it was 70 feet
lower ; 7, 000 years ago,
50 feet lower, and
3, 000 years ago, 25 feet
lower. Sea level is still
rising, as the arctic and
antarctic ice melts.
This method has
been used also to
measure the rate of
formation of plankton,
the very fine vegetable
and animal matter
that lives in the ocean
and on which the
smallest fish feed. An
exploring vessel deter-
mined that, every
year, every square yard
of oceans produces
three thousandths of
an ounce. This may
seem little enough, but
in all the areas of the
seas it amounts to
40 thousand million
tons of carbohydrates
every year-as much
as is produced by all
the trees and plants
on land. Incidentally,
this investigation show-
ed that organic matter
in the seas off the
western coast of Africa
is four or five times
higher than that in the
Indian Ocean. Further
such studies can be
used to locate future
profitable fishing
grounds.
A related problem
solved some 30 years
ago is the age of the
earth. During the last
century estimates have
varied from a few
thousand years, ac-
cording to biblical do-
cuments, up to many
millions. The most
reliable measurement,
and one now every-
where accepted, is
based on the radio-
activity of uranium and
its slow decay into
lead. The half-life
of uranium i. s 700 mil-
lion years, so long a period that
there is still uranium on the earth
in. spite of its constant decompo-
sition into lead. By measuring the
amount of uranium now present
together with the amount of lead
formed from it, and comparing it
with the known rate of decay of
uranium, the resulting age of the
earth is found to be approximately
3 thousand million years.
Thus the radio-isotopes have open-
ed a new chapter in science by
providing a reliable clock for the
measurement of time which is long
since gone.
Up to now only small quan-
tities of radio-isotopes are available.
If and when atomic power, and
therefore atomic furnaces, are
widely used by industry throughout
the world, the production of radio-
isotopes as a by-product of atomic
furnaces will also greatly increase.
It is therefore safe to say that
both the direct uses of the isotopes
and the scientific discoveries made
with them will greatly increase and
will multiply both man's knowledge
and his power.
Measurements of samples of water
taken deep in the Atlantic opposite
Newfoundland showed that the or-
ganic material in the water was
about 1, 500 years old. It is therefore
a matter of several thousands of
years for the slow ocean currents to
turn over the surface water to the
bottom and bring bottom water up.
Another interesting date is that of
the last ice sheet which covered
northern Europe, Asia, and America.
Its date has now been set by measur-
ing the age of the trees and wooden
debris that lie under the gravel de-
posited by the glacier. The date is
11, 000 years ago. Since then, the
glaciers have been retreating and
still are. This has been confirmed
by a study of the muds on the sea
coast especially in the deltas of
great rivers.
During the Ice Age, there was so
much water frozen in the glaciers
that the ocean level was much lower
than it is now. At the height of the

Teachers all over the world are
forever hunting out new
ways of breaking old rou-
tines. New ways, that is, of
making subjects come alive. New
ways of capturing youthful imagi-
nation and enthusiasm. In Japan,
there is an especially interesting
experiment now underway. Tea-
chers have just joined forces with
the national radio and television
network. And together, they are
trying to determine how television's
magic powers can best be put to
work in Japanese classrooms.
The basic idea of this new Japa-
nese experiment is to find out exact-
ly how the animated images of
television can help young students
take in abstract and complicated
ideas. Often, teachers have used
photographs and film-slides for just
such a purpose. Sometimes films
or radio talks have helped. Now.
Japan's teachers have decided to go
still further. Like teachers in
France, the United States and a few
other countries, they are trying out
the teaching powers of the newest
medium of all-television.
Here is what they are doing.
Every afternoon at one o'clock, the
national network sends out a fifteen
minute programme intended for
young viewers seated in their class-
rooms. The programmes go out
over each of Japan's new transmit-
ters-in Tokyo, Osaka and Nagoya
Special school programmes have now been added to those for general audiences.
Japan's young students find educational television a new and lively medium of
instruction. It aids teachers and supplements text-books in a truly vivid fashion.

- three tran8mitters that have been
functioning only since the begin-
ning of this year when Japan first
began television broadcasting.
At the same time, a few classes
conveniently located near the capi-
tal have been selected for a guinea-
pig role. These try-out classes are
in both primary and secondary
schools. They are probably the
most important aspect of the whole
experiment. For educational tele-
vision is still so new and its tech-
niques so untried, that before at-
tempting to teach the'youngsters,
the programme producers themsel-
ves first have to do some pretty
active research work. It is like
serving an apprenticeship in a new
trade.
And it is not always easy. Take
this example, for instance. One
education television producer a few
months ago managed to create a
special series that he called"Tele-
vision Travels". In this program-
me, two children journeyed all over
Japan-one of them a boy named
Terebi, the other a little girl named
Tereko. Everywhere they went,
they spoke to the local inhabitants
about their cities, their local monu-
ments, and so on. It all seemed an
excellent technique for teaching
school children about their own
country. And to make the idea
even more appealing, the roles of
little Terebi and Tereko were given
not to young actors but to mario-
nettes.
It did not work out well at all.
'When the teachers and the televi-
sion experts checked up at the gui-
nea-pig schools, they found that
they had made a bad mistake. All
the children had been so absorbed
watching the puppets that they had
not taken in any of the information.
And anyway, the puppets had creat-
ed a special atmosphere of un-
reality, and that, too, conflicted
with the factual descriptions of the
geography lessons.Similar presentation problems
have arisen in televising other ex-
perimental programmes."Fables of
the World"set out to tell fairy
tales of many nations, but limited
resources prevented the visual side
of the programme from being
attractive enough to make the story
vivid.
However, other programmes have
succeeded magnificently from the
very start. One such success is a
series called 'Understanding Classi-
cal Art". It is meant for fifteen-
year-olds, and it is produced with
the help of specialists from Japan's
leading museums. Here, the televi-
sion cameras focus on examples of
the great art of the past, draw out
their beauty and show comparisons
- while a commentator explains
and. appropriate classical music
plays in the background.
For the six-year-olds, there is a
television series called"Let's Play
with Rhythms"-a sort of rhythm
and dance course. There are also
scientific programmes for the older
children-anatomy courses, for
example, or chemistry courses.
Here, the television camera takes
the youngsters into magnificently-
equipped laboratories of the sort
that most of the world's schools
don't even dare dream about. Here
they can watch experiments that in-
volve equipment too expensive for
their own schools.
In another successful program-
me,"The State of Nature", chil-
dren were given explanations of
various geographical features.
They were shown how volcanoes
were formed, why tides rise and
fall, and many other natural phe-
nomena. In addition to using pho-
tographs, films, models and expe-
riments, programme planners made
a maximum use of real objects,
and these were sometimes viewed
through microscopes. Though the
scale of experiments was limited
by available studio facilities, good
results were obtained.
In'"Our Bodily Structure", the
functions of various organs such as
the heart, lungs, stomach etc., were
shown in individual programmes.
Here again the results were good as
long as there was plenty of move-
ment in the pictures on the screen.
Emphasis was placed on demon-
strations in the studio.
Each week, the"Saturday Club"
has entertained young audiences
with drama, ballet, instrumental
music, choirs, gymnastics and reci-
tations presented by semi-profes-
sional drama groups of children or
by pupils from the schools.
Television is eminently suited for
such educational work. It is prac-
tical and it is appealing. For Ja-
pan's young students, educational
television is a new lively medium
that hacks up teachers and text-
books in a truly vivid fashion.

A Letter from Great Britain
TECHNICAL CHANGE AND
THE NEED FOR AESTHETICS
TECHNOLOGICAL Change- :-Bane or Boon ? This was the
basic question posed by the Courier in the July
1953 issue which highlighted some of the human
problems involved in attempting to bring about
technological change in under-developed countries. In
a letter to the Editor, Mr. David Hardman, former Mem-
ber of Parliament of Great Britain, has commented on
one aspect of this vast problem-"the aesthetic needs
of a civilized society."} Ir. Hardman's stimulating re-
marks, we feel sure, will interest our readers in all
countries, and we are pleased therefore to publish his
long letter almost in its entirety on this page.
Dear Sir,
MAyan inveterate reader of the Courier sinceits inception in 1948 congratulate the
Editors upon their July issue ? It con-
tained, it will be remembered, a remarkable
article by the distinguished anthropologist
Dr. Alfred Metraux on the dangers associated
with technical change, and a further eight full
pages on the human problems which are bound to
arise with the impact of industrialization from
the West upon the so-called backward peoples.
It is symptomatic of Unesco's vital work in these
fields that the Courier has in the last three years
been paying more and more attention to
technological change and should in 1953 devote
almost an entire number to sagacious thinking on
the subject.
I think it necessary, however, to add a few
thoughts on the aesthetic needs of a civilized
society-a subject hardly touched upon in these
discussions on the fundamental question Dr. Me-
traux and the Editors pose-is technological
change a bane or a boon ? When I speak of"a
civilized society"in this context I am, of course,
referring to the civilizing effects or otherwise of
industrialization. In the West we have learnt
through bitter travail that an industrial
revolution can provide very great benefits to
humanity and at the same time deprive it of the
things of the human spirit. The crying need of
our time is that industrialization should create
its own culture and at the same time zealously
preserve the cultures of the past. The civiliza-
tions of the Middle East, the East and of Africa,
now vigorously applying scientific method and
technology to their own economic conditions,
should be warned of our failures and omissions
in the West.
No one can stop, nor would wish to stop the
changes now taking place. The only way in which
the vast populations of the earth can rid them-
selves of poverty, improve their food supply, im-
prove health, and develop better physical welfare
in all its aspects, is by the methods of scientific
and technological advance, but the fundamental
need of the human spirit is that there should be
a humane industrialization. Robert Bridges, the
English poet, says that the rest of humanity has
"seen the Electric Light i'the West". Let
mankind I>rofit by its gleam and probe into
the shadows that it casts.
For the life of Man is
not only founded on
technology and science
but on art and religion.
Alfred Whitehead, the
great philosopher, ma-
thematician and educa-
tionist, says that"all four
are interconnected and
issue from Man's total
mentality". If human
physical welfare is the
goal of technical assist-
ance we cannot do without
applied science. But there
is equal need for aesthetics
and the humanities if the
profound psychological
and spiritual malaise of
the great industrial cities
of the West is to be
avoided. Science has di-
rected attention to things
as opposed to values.
It may be a proud
distinction that the in-
dustrial civilization of the
West should begin with
the industrial revolution
in England but it has left
a trail of evils from which
the English have been
trying to extricate them-
selves for the last fifty
years. These evils arose
from the aesthetic errors of scientific materialism,
as well as from the natural greed of men which
it intensified. As Whitehead says in his Science
and the Modern World when speaking of the
early industrial system here or in Europe and
America,"The point which I am insisting on is
the stone-blind eye with which even the best men
of that time regarded the importance of aesthetics
in a nation's life. I do not believe that we have
as yet nearly achieved the right estimate."
Speaking on this theme in London in 1946 (since
commented upon by Mr. T. S. Eliot in his Notes
towards the Definition of Culture page 105 : 1948)
I said that the age of industrialism and democracy
had brought to an end most of the great cultural
Man lives not by technology and science alone. He is nourished by the arts and religion as well. In every so-
ciety whatever its level, these four factors cannot be dissociated if happiness is to accompany material welfare.
(U, N. photo.)
There is no doubt that the vast populations of the earth can improve their
conditions of living by applying modern scientific and technological methods,
but"the fundamental need is that there should be a humane industrialization"
traditions of Europe, not least that of the visual
environment, and that fortunes and power had
been obtained by exploiting ignorance and
appetite. As a result the majority of people in
the contemporary world were half-educated, if
that, and there was a vast cultural breakdown
which stretched from America to Europe and from
Europe to the East.
Mr. Eliot comments that'''half-education''is a
modern phenomenon."In earlier ages the
majority could not be said to have been"half-
educated"or less : people had the education
necessary for the functions they were called upon
to perform. It would be incorrect to refer to a
member of a primitive society, or to a skilled
agricultural labourer in any age, as half-educated,
or quarter-educated or educated to any smaller
fraction."The supreme danger of industrializa-
tion without humaneness is that diversification
among human communities will be wiped out,
age-long cultures-invaluable for the Odyssey of
the human spirit-will be wiped out, and there
will be no contemporary culture with its roots in
the past to take their place. The"half-educated",
in Mr. Eliot's sense, will inherit the earth.
Dr. Metraux remarks on the danger arising
from the enthusiastic impatience of the most
highly cultivated representatives of the coloured
races"who protest most vehemently when white
men advise them to maintain their traditional
customs". The warning is timely. Power to
benefit the material welfare of mankind can come
from science and technology, but happiness, as
the many diverse cultures of the world have
proved through thousands of years of trial. and
error, is a tender and more wayward plant,
requiring the inspiration of the arts and religion.
Wherever technology is introduced there must
be corresponding attention given to town and
country planning, architecture, the design of
goods in daily use (especially those mass
produced) if the ugliness and malaise of Western
industrial centres is to be avoided. Community
planning should have cultural objectives as well
as technical. Not only the Temple but the school
and the adult college should be the centre from
which the aesthetic and spiritual life should be
drawn, and when I speak of school and college I
am thinking not only of education through dis-
course, but of activity, first-hand experience and
observation, so closely identified with Technical
Assistance, as the July Courier schows.
Activity, the giving as much chance as possible
of children and adults doing things for themselves,
is vital. This applies equally to aesthetic and in-
tellectual pursuits as well as physical. Those
working in the fields of Technical Assistance
should always be aware not only of the impact of
technology on primitive communities, but of the
frightening influence of the passive amusements
of the West-the cinema, sound broadcasting and
now Television. These can and do serve their
turn in aesthetic and spiritual education of the
right kind, but they can be deadly in their effect
of cultural umformity, in their squashing of in-
dividual and group initiative, and in their drab
tyranny over the realm of aesthetics.
Yours sincerely,
David Hardman.

OR ! ENTEEk) NG...
G I'VE my daughter Marguerite, aged 12, a
t compass and a map. Tell her there is
a a lovety l ke, a few mil s aw y, where
the fairies and"Little Men in the Woods"
used to ptay, where she can have a picnic with
her friends. Or suggest that she go with them
to that farm three miles across country where
there is a new brood of chickens. The girls
will start across country and find the lake or
the farm.
They may not get there the fastest or easiest
way, but with compass and map they will find
a safe track and will not get lost. An expert
would probably find a better
road and take a bit less time.
3ut the point here is that Mar-
; uerite and her friends, town-
bred girls as they are, will take
to the country and the woods like
ducks to water. This is largely
because they have studied"Orien-
teering", which is both a sport
and a school subject in Sweden.
With their"Silva", (the simple
compass with protractor every
child in Sweden seems to possess
and which Marguerite got for her
ninth birthday), map-reading.
the spotting of landmarks and
the art of following a'set course
are familiar to them.
The growth of"Orienteering"
(the name is taken from Swedish
and anglicized by the addition of
an extra"e"), is one of these
remarkable developments which
show how much can be done in
education with a simple idea,
intelligently applied."Orienter-
ing"as the Swedes write it, is
essentially the art of finding your
way with map and compass. It
has now become something more
than that : since it is now a
compulsory subject in the schools
its educational value has been
greatly increased.
Like all things in education
and sport, Orienteering is best
started early and you must catch
the child young. That is why in
Swedish schools, where children
begin at the age of seven, the first
principles are taught in the first
year. This is done by easy
indoor and outdoor games whose
object is simply to give the chil-
dren a sense of direction and
observation.
Diagrams and plans, they are
told, are really maps. They
draw a diagram of the classroom,
a map of the school and school
grounds, then a real map with
simple lines and landmarks.
Elementary pacing and measur-
ing of distances also comes in.
For practice, after-school walks
and Sunday outings soon enlarge
the range of interest.
In the next two or three years,
map symbols are learned. Then
the orienteering lesson turns into
a geography lesson, with incur-
sions into topography, geometry,
mathematics, drawing, the draft-
ing of reports and nature studies.
The experience of teachers in Sweden and
elsewhere provides interesting indications on
the educational use of orienteering.
"The drawing of simple maps", a country
schoolmaster in Central Sweden says,"is in
my opinion the best introduction for children
to the study of geography. The young child
seems to take to drawing maps as he does to
drawing pictures. From the plan of the school
room or school grounds, he will soon be looking
at the country around as he would a map. His
interest and understanding of maps showing
the country and the world is then easily and
rapidly encouraged".
Another teacher has emphasized for me the
interest of the new school subject for social
studies : the child is stimulated by it to learn
much more than he would otherwise about his
own community, his own country and the
different aspects of other countries.
Lessons and practice in'Orientering", as it is called in Sweden, have made this
boy familiar with the symbols of cartography. On the blackboard he is drawing
a map of last Sunday's outing to a nearby ! ake () nsj6n means"the lake"in Swedish).
(U. N. and Unesco photos).
... WITH MAP AND COMPASS OUTDOORS
Still another teacher, in a report sent to the
educational authorities in Stockholm, stresses a
different aspect of the educational value of
orienteering : by inducing children to observe
landmarks, both on the maps and in nature,
their capacity to describe what they see is put
to good use. This particular schoolmaster
found that children were more willing to write
about their outing if they were left to find the
road. They find new interest in the historv
of landmarks, in the nature surrounding them.
Educators both in Sweden and in Canada
have been working out other practical me-
thods for using the compulsory teaching of
orienteering in the schools in other studies. It
is thought better at first not to encumber young
pupils with difficult explanations about the
compass and its geometrical applications while
teaching its use in class. (One teacher found
that instead of 360"degrees"his pupils were
talking about highways by their compass
number : number 90 indicating
East, 180 the road South, etc.).
At later stages, the use of geome-
try for taking bearings and mea-
suring heights and distances
comes in and is learned with
added interest because its useful-
ness has been seen in practice
with map and compass and on
orienteering outings.
The possibilities of combining
orienteering with nature studies,
botany and animal life are also
easily understood by teachers and
children. Notes on things ob-
served on an orienteering cross-
country walk have greatly added
to the value of this new subject
which was first regarded only as
a sport and which is still re-
garded by most of its practi-
tioners as primarily a source of
fun.
Even the original idea of orien-
tiering, conceived some 30 years
ago by Major Ernest KiHander,
constituted an interesting educa-
tional advance. Major KiUan-
der, a Swedish youth and scout
leader, had been worried at the
amount of time the young people
he was looking after were spend-
ing watching sport instead of
participating in it. One Sunday
morning, he gave each of them
an objective they could reach
with the help of a compass and a
topographical map of the coun-
try-side : they could go as they
liked, by the main roads, or
across hill and dale. The idea
was a success and the Swedes
now look upon orienteering as a
national sport-as golf is British,
hockey is Canadian and baseball
American.
In Sweden today over : 150, 00
people (including 135, 000 adults)
take part every year in orienteer-
ing contests. As in Sweden,
orienteering has become a com-
pulsory school subject in Ontario
Province, Canada. Booklets exist
on orienteering sport and the
Swedish orienteering manual
published in H) 43 sold 150, 000 co-
pies. An amusing illustrated
manual has just been published
in German in Switzerland, and the
illustrated leaflets on the"Silva"
compass which provide elemen-
tary instruction on map-reading
are printed in four or five
lane-uae-es.
But the practical usefulness of orienteering
goes far beyond sport, games and exercise. Its
educational value is more and more recognized.
For children of Marguerite's age, it is a way
to start gaining confidence in the country, a
wonderful sport and a fascinating way to dis-
rover the world around.
Yves DU GUERNY
It is a commonplace experience in Sweden to find children, singly or in groups,
finding their way across the countryside with the aid of a compass and a map.
Much more than a game, map-reading and orientation with the aid of a compass
are now an integral part of the Swedish school programme. This instruction
begins in the primary school with simple problems and is developed to include
more advanced mathematics, natural history and botany. (Unesco photos.)

FROM THE UNESCO NEWSROOM
SPORT : L'nesco has just re-
quested its sixty-nine Member States to
offer suggestions on how best to develop
the use of sports for educational pur-
poses. The Member States were also
asked what they are already doing in
this field. Various possible Unesco ac-
tions were suggested for the countries to
consider. One was the question of whe-
ther Unesco ought to organize compara-
tive studies on the place of sport in
different educational systems. Member
States were also asked whether, in their
opinion, such an Unesco action should be
linked with an international occasion in
sport, such as the Olympic Games of

* BRAILLE BOOKS : A near
method of Braille printing, know
as"solid dot"Braitle, which will
print three times as fast as the
present embossing system at one-
third of the cost is being tried
out in England by the National
Institute for the Blind. The sys-
term. makes possible a printing
rate off 5. 000 sheet, ç an hour and
may ultimately cheapen consirler-
ably the printing rates for Braille
boolí : s. These will also be less
bulky, as thinner paper can be
used and printed on both sides.
THEATRE CLASSROOM : A
large open-air theatre is to be built at
Tasquillo, Hidalgo, Mexico, to aid the
fundamental education activities of 1he
mission of the Inter-American Native
Affairs Institute in the Mezquital Vaiiey.
The pageants and plays shown will be
based on the traditions of the Otomi In-
dians, but will be blended with lessons on
better health and living conditions.
* TECHNICAL EDUCATION :
A wood industry school, the first
of its kind in Switzerland, has
been inaugurated in tile Canton
of Bern. It is fully eqlÛpped and
it.  curriculum includes ordinary
training courses and ad hoc short
specialist courses based on cur-
rent needs of the wood industry.
AIRBORNE CLASSES : The
Science Faculty of the Sorbonne Univer-
sity in paris is making airborne-classes
- an idea it first tried out a few years
ago-a. permanent feature of its curri-
culum. Airborne studies of atmospheric
disturbances and cosmic rays were found
particularly valuable. Ex'perience has
shown that sludents can learn more in
one flight than in many hours spent
examin ; ng maps. So far these education-
al flights have only been made over
France, but others are now planned over
Switzerland Sweden, Holland and Bel-
gium.
* HIGHER EDUCATION : Re-
presentatives of over 100 Spanish-
speaking universities in Spain
and America met recently at Ma-
drid and Salamanca. Among the
questions they discussed were
the equivalence o {university dip-
lomas and degrees, the place of
humanism in university training
and the co-ordination of scienti-
fic and unil'ersity research.
NEWSPRINT : Heat from the
depths of the earth will provide the
power for New Zealand's first large-
scale newsprint mills, now being built at
Te Teko (North Island) and which will
start producing paper in October 1955.
These mills will be unique in the history}
of paper-making, in that hot springs will
provide an inexhaustible supply of high-
pressure steam both for heat and to drive
the turbines for electricity. This will
mean a yearly saving of several hun-
dreds of thousands of dollars in coal costs
alone. The plant will produce 75, 000
tons of newsprint, and 36, 000 tons of
pulp yearly-enough to fill New Zealand's
needs and provide a surplus for other
Pacific countries.
* MUTUAL UNDERSTAND-
ING : Some 75 institutions off
higher learning in the United
States have been studyinq hO/l} to
use their facilities more effective-
ly to further intel'national un-
derstanding. They have been ap-
praising their langua (Je, geogra-

cation,-These studies have been
carried out in connection with a
project for the Carnegie Endow-
ment for Internatlollal Peflf : e.
Dr. How'art E. Wilson, director of
the project, estimates that there
are alreud !} over 600 International
Relations'Clubs, and 200 to 300
United Nations Clubs, lcith a
total membership of at least
100, 000 students, connected with
American colleges and univer-
sities.
L ITEBACY : More than 7, 000
collective literacy centres have been estab-
lished in Mexican communities accord-
ing to a report compiled on the fourth
anniversary of : \lexico's law providing
for a compulsory campaign against illite-
racy. Another 3, 000 such centres have
been set up. to supplement the work of
regular schools. It is calculated that
more than 3, 000, 000 adults have been
taught to read and write in the course
of the four-year campaign.
* FREE SCHOOLING : The
Kashmir Government has an-
nounced that from now on all
schooling will be entirely free,
from kindergarten to the doc-
torate degree". There are ten
colleges and thirteen hundred and
forty-nine primary schools in
Kashmir with a total of 110, 000
pupils.

1. 000 United Stutes students will
have a chance to study abroad
under government scholarship
grants during the 1954-1955 aca-
demic year, according to a spoke-
esman of the Institute of Interna-
tional Education. The awards
are made under the Fulbright and
Buenos Aires convention pro-
grammes, which are part of the
international exchange activities
of the U. S. Department of State.
TEACHERS NEEDED : Last
year the, Gold Coast introduced free
compulsory primary education-an im-
portant step for a young, independent
country. To meet the shortage of prim-
ary teachers, it is planned to open six new
teacher training colleges and to double
the enrolment at the six existing ones.
About 6, 000 primary teachers will thus be
trained each year.

SCHOOL EXCHANGES : The
Ministry of Education of Lower Saxony
states that more than 5, 600 boys and
girls in this Land of the German Federal
Republic were corresponding abroad last
year. During the year, there was a
great increase in the number of secon-
dary teachers (664 as compared with
287 in 195t) and secondary pupils (3. 946
as compared with 1, 929 in 1951) who
were able to stay in foreign countries.

VERNACULAR LANGUAGES :
In British African territories atone, the In-
ternaJ. ional African Institute lists 369 lan-
uages or dialects. In South America,
one expert lists 94 linguistic groups and
some 558 languages. In India, some 100
different languages are spoken and 14 are
recognized as official regional tongues.
The existence of these hundreds of lan-
guages has created an enormous and
complex problem for teachers who are
trying to apply the principle that the
education of schoolchildren and adult
illiterates is best carried out through the
mother tongue of the pupil. If was
with these problems in mind that Unesco
recently published a 154-page book."The
L'se of vernacular Languages in Educa-
tion".'Presenting an analysis of various
solutions, along-with considerahle back-
ground information, the Unesco book also
contains a classified bibliography and an
index, as well as a list and tentative
classification of the languages spoken in
the world today.

"THE LAST SUPPER". This picture on a 12th century manuscript now in the British Museum, is taken from a series illustrating the life of Christ. The clumsy-
ness and naivety of the drawing mark it as the strangest of all the Syriac manuscripts which have come down to us. It recalls certain Egyptian friezes, but it
also has a modern quality which finds an echo in some present-day art trends. Especially striing are the faces with their wide-open eyes. (Photo British Museum.)
r the Middle Ages", said Victor Hugo,
"there were no profound, important
thoughts which were not inscribed in
stone."
In this phrase, the author of Notre-Dame ae
Paris not only gives us the reason for the multitude
of figures and scenes decorating the portals of our
cathedrals or enlivening the multi-coloured panes
of their stained-glass windows, but also reveals
the educational significance of the image up to
the time of the invention of printing.
In this sense, the"Middle Ages"covered a much
longer period than is generally understood by the
by Abbé Jules Leroy
term, going back to the first manifestations of the
"civilization"of those prehistoric men who
produced the cave paintings of Altamira or
Lascaux and lasting until the introduction of a
new means of expressing ideas.
Until that time, the art of writing was the
prerogative of the learned. It presupposed such
a standard of learning that those who were able
to write were necessarily the most influential
people in the State, and it is for that reason that
the oldest civilizations may truly be described as
civilizations of scribes and priests, both of whom
held the secret of the art of'writing. The
common people's only means of acquiring know-
ledge was to listen to instruction given by word
of mouth or to read the lessons in history and
ethics, set forth by the recognized custodians of
knowledge, in bas-reliefs and frescoes.

visual form, suited to yet untutored minds, truths
now accessible to all, thanks to the increase in the

"THE CANONS OF EUSEBIUS"or"THE CONCORDANCE OF THE GOS-
PELS" (A. D. 1177). The marginal drawings inspired by mosaic flooring have a
Hellenistic style full of poetry. From this point of wiew, they differ greatly from the
eligious character of those usually found in liturgical books. (Photo L. Jalabert.)
"THE NATIVITY". This is one of the finest pictures from a manuscript on which the painter, in accordance with
Byzantine religious rules, has grouped all the events relating to the birth of Christ : the angel appearing to the shepherds,
the adoration of the Magi, the bathing of the new-born child. It is one of the most noteworthy examples of the meeting
of Byzantine art with pre-Mongol Arab art, traces of which are to be found in the faces. (Photo British Museum.)
"THE RAISING OF LAZARUS" (A. D. 1216 1220) : The theme is borrowed from
Byzantine iconography, but Eastern influence is seen in the faces and costumes.
The Realism contrasts strongly with the traditional style of Constantinople church
paintings with their cold, hieratic Byzantine figures. (Photo British Museum.)

number of printed books. They filled the place
in instruction that films and television are tending
to take at the present time, a process which may
one day end in their ousting the book and re-
placing the civilization of the printed word by
that of the visual image. A curious repetition of
history by which modern man is placed in the
same situation as his distant ancestors and is
better able to understand Victor Hugo's words of
genius than were the poet's contemporaries I
It was hundreds of years before man was able
to free himself to some extent from the
ascendancy of the image. Visual depiction was
found everywhere, and took a particularly brilliant
form in all the civilizations of the Near East or
the Mediterranean. All the successive empires in
Egypt, Mesopotamia, Greece or Rome, like all the
religions, made use of it.
When Christianity made its appearance in the
oikoumene, i. e. the civilized inhabited world as
distinct from the"barbarian"world, it took a
place in the system of instruction everywhere
prevailing and created a world of images drawn
from biblical history which, in its eyes, recounts
the whole story of the bringing of salvation to the
world, first by the Jewish people and later by
Jesus Christ. It covered the walls of its churches
with these images and scattered them through the
pages of its manuscripts, so that, as one of the
Fathers of the Greek Church was to say in the
fifth century,.'the dumb image spoke from the
wall"or from the margin of the book with as
much authority as the written word itself.
"MOSES CONFERS WITH PHARAOH", a Syriac manuscript, now in 1he Bibliotheque Nationale,
Paris, and one of the oldest of its kind, probably dating from the 6th century. This illustration is
taken from a Bible containing both the Old and New Testaments. This small work is classed today
liS one of the last relics of Hellenistic painting adapted by the Christians of Syria and Mesopotamia.(Photo : Bibliothèque Nationale.)
THE FOUR EVANGELISTS". A meeting of civilizations i  reflected in this manuscript fragment. The features recall those of certain
figures in friozos at Turfan. Central Asia, while the draping of the robes and s1yle of furniture are those found in the Arab miniature.
This manuscript probably dates from the 12th or l3th centuries. (Property of Mr. Kevorkian, New York ; photo by John D. Schiff.)
All the images here displayed to the reader are
drawn from this world of sacred representations.
They all come from the Christian societies of
Mesopotamia, where the Christian religion was
introduced at a very early date. The first centre
from which it spread was the little kingdom of
Edessa, the modern Urfa, which officially adopted
Christianity at the end of the second century.
From that ancient
stronghold of Semitic
culture, little affected
by the Hellenic civili-
zation from which it
was cut off by its lan-
guage, Syriac, akin to
Aramaic and Hebrew,
it spread throughout
all the countries water-
ed by the Tigris and
the Euphrates.
In the fifth century,
during the theological
disputes concerning the
nature of Christ, a
schism occurred bet-
ween the various chur-
ches whose only re-
maining sign of their
lost unity thereafter
was the language they
shared. While most of
the churches of Upper
Mesopotamia adopted
Jacobite monophysi-
tism (1), those in Persia
went over to Nesto-
rianism (2) (now re-
presented by about
100, 000 adherents in
North Persia and East
Turkey in the neigh-
bourhood between the
Lakes of Van and
Urumia).
In the Middle Ages,
this Nestorian Church
in Persia played a
brilliant part. Its
missionaries spread
Christian communities
throughout Central
Asia, China and even
Tibet, though these
communities were to
disappear in the Mon-
gol invasion of the
thirteenth century, so
that the European
missionaries who came out in the 17th and 18th
centuries found virgin soil awaiting them.
This spread of the Syriac-speaking Nestorian
Church in the Far East is extremely interesting,
because it shows us a meeting of civilizations
which has left its mark and explains the
existence in Far-Eastern thought of ideas recog-
nizably drawn from Persian Christianity. The
same lesson can be gleaned from the Syriac
manuscripts enriched with miniatures which, in
the absence of wall paintings now vanished, help
us to define, or at least sketch in (for these
manuscripts are rare, most of them having been
destroyed by wars or other calamities) the various
cultural movements which have taken place in
Mesopotamia. The history of these venerable
fragments is an epitome of the history of
Mesopotamia since the introduction of Chris-
tianity : each of the alien civilizations with which
this region has, willy-nilly, come into contact, has
left its mark upon it.
The interest that these miniatures from the
Syriac manuscripts have for us probably lies far
more in this than in their aesthetic quality, which
is governed by the laws of book illumination as
understood in the early Middle Ages and now,
after long neglect, coming back into favour with
some of our contemporary artists. The art of the
book is a two-dimensional art. There is a
disturbance of unity if three-dimensional figures
are incorporated in the text. This accounts for
the fact that the figures overlap instead of
receding in perspective, for slight differences in
their size and the absence of relief and shadow.
These laws, which were observed by all painters
up to the revival of painting, were applied by
these Mesopotamian artists in a highly individual
manner. In the oldest manuscripts, for instance
- those of the sixth century-they give life, by
their expressive gestures, to the cold, hieratic
Byzantine figures, while in the thirteenth century
they give an Arab flavour to the traditional
themes by introducing backgrounds, faces or dress
borrowed from their own people and environment,
or again themselves create images whose"primi-
tivism"is echoed in some of today's art.
For all three reasons, this religious imagery
deserves to be better known. It will thus regain
a part of its original function, which was to teach.
Only the sort of instruction it provides will have
changed. While in the past it was theological or
religious, today it is historical and cultural.
(I) The belief that the humun and divine natures in
Cllrist are united in one single nature, part human and hart
divine.
(2) The doctrine 01 Nestorious, patriarch 01 Constantin-
ople in the 5th century, who held that there were two
persons as well as two natnres in les2ts Christ-the divine
and the human.

WARDHA : CENTRE OF GANDHIAN THOUGHT
by Dr J. D. N. VERSLUYS
Unesco Social Science Representative for South Asia
W ARDHA is a small town, 70 milessouth of Nagpur, the capital
of Madyah Pradesh. This
means Central Province, and Wardha
is indeed the geographical centre of
India. It is also the centre of
. Gandhian thought. Here, too, are
situated the buildings of the All-
India Village Industries Association
- one of the material results of
Mahatma Gandhi's teachings.
When I entered the gate leading
to the Association's buildings the
first thing I saw was a Pzeta, a
sculpture of the Virgin Mary holding
the dead body of Christ in her lap,
carved out of granite-a symbol of
Christianity I hardly expected to find
in the heart of India.
But this was soon explained by
Dr. J. C. Kumarappa, the outstanding
Gandhian economist, as he showed
me round the village industries
centre he has directed for many
years. Gandhian ideas, he pointed
out, are not linked to any particular
religion and therefore followers of
any religion whether they are Hin-
dus, Buddhists, Moslems or Chris-
tians, are all welcome at Wardha.
The central precept of the Gan-
dhian ideology-non-violence-not
only implies the generally accepted
sense of the term, but also the
deeper and wider meaning that
nature should not be roughly curbed
at will. It teaches that man should
adapt himself to nature in order to
establish a real harmony. Thip
attitude signifies reluctance to follow
any artificial ways of life such as are
found in large cities.
The family, preferably the joint
family (where brothers and sisters
with their families are living to-
gether as a single group), and the
village are regarded as the natural
setting for human life. The con-
ditions required to maintain this
structure call for both the family
and the village to be self-sufficient.
Therefore as far as possible every-
thing used in the village should be
manufactured by the villagers them-
selves. To meet the principal need
- textiles-spinning and weaving are
taught. But other handicrafts are
also encouraged, and one of the
main purposes of the Wardha Centre
is to teach social workers and the
teachers of handicrafts.
There is another reason for this in-
terest in handicrafts. It is realized
that the enormous rural problem of
under-employment and complete
unemployment cannot easily be re-
medied. The proportion of culti-
vators to arable land is increasing
unfavourably and each year the
population pressure becomes more
serious.
Industrialization cannot solve the
problem, as only a relatively small
number of workers can be absorbed
in big industries. Such industries
would require heavy capital in-
vestment, and capital is scarce in
India. Moreover, Dr. Kumarappa
feels that big industries are not in
keeping with India's own culture,
which flourished during many cent-
uries in various handicrafts until
these were suppressed by the cheap
machine-made products of Western
industry. Gandhi and his followers,
therefore, had economic, cultural
and national reasons for propagating
the revival of village handicrafts.
As is well-known, hand-spinning
became the symbol of Gandhism in
the'''twenties'', and in the Museum
Gandhian ideology regards the family and the village as the natural setting for
human life. With help and advice from social workers and handicraft teachers
trained at the Wardha Centre (seen here at mealtime), villagers can learn to
become self-supporting and improve their standards of health and of living.
at Wardha various models of spin-
ning-wheels, besides many beautiful
products of hand-weaving and many
other handicrafts are displayed.
Hand-spinning gradually gained an
importance far beyond its probably
doubtful economic usefulness. It
became the symbol of nationalism
and even took on an almost re-
ligious significance. But today the
Wardha Centre tries to develop
simple and more efficient village
tools to enable the villagers to
obtain better results more economic-
ally.
This is nowadays one of the chief
purposes of the Centre which tests
various tools, compares implements
from different parts of the country,
and then sets out to modify or
combine them in order to give
village industries a better chance
against the competition of machine-
made products. I was shown a
bullock-driven oil press whose
efficiency had been improved 60%
by a change in design costing very
little and by the introduction of ball-
bearings.
When I asked Dr. Kumarappa if he
did not resent the use of these ball-
bearings, which after all are ma-
chine-made products, he replied
frankly that big factories were
certainly useful for some specific
purposes, but that their use should
be limited to those products which
could not be made by hand. The
Centre uses scientific methods to
improve village tools, but it always
keeps one condition in mind, namely,
thai to be within the reach of the
village artisan, the improved tools
must be cheap, and require no power
supply for their operation.
Paper-making is also demonstrated
at Wardha. Although an ingenious
system is used to make the bullock-
driven mill as efficient as possible,
the product is about 50% more
expensive than machine-made paper.
Yet paper-making as a handicraft is
taught for it enables the villagers to
make use of various sorts of refuse
(old rags, straw, etc.), which would
otherwise be thrown away, and it
prevents the people from using their
money outside the village economy.
This is just one example of action
based on the principle that con-
sumption must be adapted to village
productive capacity. This in turn
implies that the village must be
ready to accept a lower satisfaction
of its needs from local production
than would be the case if it sought
goods manufactured in the cities.
There is another feature connected
with the campaign for handicrafts
which should be mentioned, namely,
the educational advantages. The
Gandhian system of education, called
basic education, makes wide use of
"learning by doing". It lays down
that the child should first of all
understand those things which form
the background of life in the village
and therefore the teacher should
use the children's immediate sur-
roundings as his starting point.
Spinning, for instance, may lead
the teacher to explain how cotton
grows and to describe all the other
processes connected with the cultl-
vation and use of this crop. From
here he may pass on to the mech-
anical principle of the spinning-
wheel and then to the economic
issues of buying cotton and selling
yarn, etc. This system naturally
requires a great deal of effort on the
part of the teacher, but has cer-
tainly the advantage of being a far
more direct approach to the subject
matter.
The Wardha Centre has not only
done useful work in developing vil-
lage industries, but also by teaching
social workers to approach village
life as a whole and through all its
aspects-agriculture, health, educa-
tion and culture.
In India, hand-spinning became the symbol of Gandhism and took on an almost religious significance. At Wardha, which is
both the centre of Gandhian thought and of the All-India Village Industries Association, the tradition continues. The centre'smain purpose, however, is to develop simple and efficient village tools and to improve craft and agricultural techniques,

THE celebration of Christmas and the New Year
as a season of goodwill is continuously expressed
in old nd newer forms. Among thes  is the
fairly new custom of sending greeting cards.
Youngest of all, is the custom of world-famous artists
to lend their talent to the design of cards for the UN
Children's Fund-cards which will bear warm wishes to
absent friends, and buy protection against disease and
malnutrition for children in 75 countries of the world.
Under the name of Lewitt-Him, two Polish-born London
artists (photo, left) have contributed five illustrations
for this year's UNICEF greeting cards. In rich, warm
colours, they show"Children at Play"in five countries
of the world receiving UNICEF assistance. During
20 years of partnership Jan Le Witt and George Him
have gained an international reputation in the fields of
mural painting, book and magazine illustration. They
are known to thousands of children in France, Britain,
the United States, Sweden, Poland, Israel and Hungary
through their illustrations, and it is now the turn of
millions of the world's less fortunate children to benefit from their talents, for eacn
box of ten cards sold (7/6d ; $1. 00 or 350 French francs) will enable UNICEF to provide
enough BCG vaccine to protect 24 children against TB ; or enough powdered milk to give
9 children a glass every day for a week ; or enough UNICEF penicillin to treat eight
children for yaws ; or enough DDT to safeguard 13 children from malaria ; or enough
vaccine to protect 33 children against diphtheria. The subjects of the cards illustrate the
universality of children's games, and range from hopscotch in Pakistan to kite-flying in
Peru, from hide-and-seek in the Middle East to games in the Philippines and Greece.
But in each of these countries there are many sick and needy children who cannot join
those games. To heal Asia's sores, to rid Peru of typhus, to bring relief to Middle East
children and aid Greece's earthquake victims, besides protecting Pakistan from the
scourge of tuberculosis and malaria, this is but a fraction of the work among 20 million
new children which UNICEF will undertake this coming year, with technical help from the
World Health Organization. Created in 1946 by the UN General Assembly to bring emer-
gency aid to the children of Europe and other war-devastated areas, UNICEF has since de-
velopeq into the world's largest international effort to improve the health and welfare of
children and mothers. The work of UNICEF is not for some remote tomorrow. It is for
today. Through the sale of these cards, today, you can be helping UNICEF to raise
standards of health and welfare for children and thereby play a part in the fulfilment
of the promise implicit in the United Nations of a better future.
Information as to where UNICEF Greeting Cards can be purchased is obtainable from
any of the United Nations Information Centres throughout the world.
