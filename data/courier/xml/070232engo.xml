UNESCO AND EDUCATION F (
Tiny children of different lands and different colour can be put to play together and they have no feeling of colour-bar
or prejudice. It is only later when they grow up that they develop prejudices and get attached to them. (USIS photo.)
by Lionel ELVIN
Director of the Department of Education of Unesco
O"'E of the bad things aboutgrowing up is that ve
develop prejudices and get
attached to them. Very young
children of different colour can
be put to play together in a sand-
pit and they have no sense of
colour-bar. If you tell young
children that little girls in China
dress differently from little girls
in America, or that little boys in
India may have the luck to ride
on an elephant whereas a lucky

boy in France
goes out in his
father's car, that
interests them
but they don't
feel called upon
to pronounce on
the superiority of
their own way
of life. Their
eyes are open
with wonder,
and'without pre-
judice, to-what
the constitution
of Unesco calls
"the fruitful di-
versitv of cultu-
res"iñ the \vorld.
We begin to
acquire these
suspicions of the
stranger quite
early, and biolo-
gically this has
been a useful
protective device.
But more than
one species has disappeared be-
cause it developed a characteris-
tic that'ways at first useful and
then could not be adapted to
changed circumstances. The
same may happen to us, for our
world has suddenly shrunk.
Two wars have made us realize
ho'w small it is. Now we know
that we may at any moment blow
ourselns out of it.
We have had just enough intel-
ligence to see how wore could pro-
teet ourselves. We have founded
the United Nations, because we
see that only through such a
device can we keep the peace.
Sincewars have commonly result-
ed from men's refusal to allow to
others the rights they claim for
themselves we have adopted the
Universal Declaration of Human
Blights. But these things won't
work unless we are trained to live
in this kind of a world. It is no
use seeing what is necessary
THE 32nd ANNUAL WORLD MESSAGE
OF THE YOUTH OF WALES
"GOODWILL DAY"MAY 18, 1953
BOYS and girls of all nations ! We, the boys and girls of'W ales.once again greet you. This is Goodwill Day. Across land
and sea, youth calls to youth in the name of freedam and of friend-
ship.
W P. rejoice, to-dq, y, in all the efforts of men and women of every
race and people, who are doing their best to set the world free
from way.
We want a world in which never again shall countless homes
be destroyed and little children suffel'hunger.
We want a world where no nation shall live in fear of any
other nation.
We want a world where the nations shall work together for the
good of all, trusting each other and sharing together the riches uj"
the earth.
By our confidence and courage, by our thoughts and deeds, u ; e
can help to spread a new spirit throughout the world. And we
will !
Youth of all lands, let us dedicate ourselves to-day to our great
adventure of peace on earth and goodwill among men.
unless we make a real adaptatioil
in our behaviour. And it is be-
cause this is essentially a matter
of education that Unesco ways
founded.
If Unesco were only an office
in Paris, its task'would be
impossible. It is more than that :
it is an association of some sixty-
five countries which have pledged
themselves to do all they can, not
only internationally but'within
their own boundaries, to advance
if its purpose
had been to
make French
boys less French,
Americans less
American, Japa-
nese less Japa-
nese. Being a
good neighbour
does not mean
ceasing to call
your home your
own and having
to re-arrange the
furniture the
way some one
down the street
might like it.
Education for
international
understanding
doesn't even
mean saying
that other peo-
ple's opinions or
ways of life are
as good as your
own. They may
not be. It means only admitting
that they have as much right to
their opinions and their ways of
life as you have to yours. It
means mutual respect and mutu-
al help-as I said, being good
neighbours.
Education is involved in two
ways. If we are to get on with
each other instead of blowing
each other up we need to develop
friendly attitudes of mind for
co-operating with people who
the common aim of educating for
peace. The international side
comes in because we shall ob-
viously do this faster and better
and with more mutual trust if'we
do it together.
This doesn't mean that edu-
cation in your school is to be
turned over to some insidious
foreign influence that Iwants to
aUack your way of life. The
governments that make up Unes-
co would never have founded it

FOR INTERNATIONAL UNDERSTANDING
An explanation for older children at school
may not have the same outlook as
our own. And we need know-
ledge of what these differences are
80 that we can understand each
other and co-operate better. In
forming these attitudes and in
giving this knowledge what hap-
pens in school is important.
Dictators who have waned to
organize their people for war have
always done two things in their
schools : they have used authori-
tarian methods so that children
grow up not as free and respon-
sible persons but as unquestioning
servants of the dictator's will ; and
they have twisted what was taught
about other countries so that hate
was engendered instead of under-
standing. Education among de-
mocratic and peace-loving peoples
will do the opposite of these things.
It will encourage schools them-
selves to be communities, in which
children, though they have to
follow certain rules for the com-
mon good, will follow them hap-
pily, and indeed help to carry them
out, because they are treated as real
persons capable of showing initia-
tive and of thinking for themselves.
Let me give one example of the
way in which Unesco helps forward
such an aim. It is our duty to
spread understanding of Human
Rights. We called an interna-
tional meeting of teachers last year
to discuss how this might be done
in schools, and we are publishing
a practical handbook on the subject
this year. In both you will find
emphasis on the idea that, though
older children might be expected
to know something of the Uni-
versal Declaration itself, the im-
portant things are that the idea of
human rights should be encou-
raged through the teaching of
present school subjects, and that
schools themselves should be com-
munities where human rights are
observed.
The provision of direct informa-
tion about other countries becomes
more important as one goes
through the school. We must
have such information if we are to
make intelligent decisions about
what our own country ought to do
in international affairs. Even
from our own country's point of
view (apart from that of mankind
as a whole) it is important that
information be accurate in fact and
that comment be fair in tone.
Much of our teaching concentrates,
quite rightly, on telling us about
the history and the geography and
the achievements of our own coun-
try. This sometimes leads us,
though it need not, to under-
estimate the achievements and the
ways of life of wheres. There is
now no countrv so distant from us
that we may not be involved,
through something that happens
there, in major difficulties, or in
war itself. How many of you knew
where Korea was, or really under-
stood what the phrase"Collective
Security"meant, until the inva-
sion of South Korea almost three
years ago ?
In all these matters Unesco is
active. We have called meetings
of teachers from many countries to
consider how the teaching of cer-
tain school subjects, like history
and geography, can help to give us
a better understanding of other
peoples. This year we are holding
a similar international meeting to
discuss how the' : grind" of lan-
guage teaching can be speeded up
so that we can really use a foreign
language as a key to open an inter-
esting civilization to our minds.
Unesco has stimulated the estab-
lishment of over twenty commit-
tees of scholars to compare their
national textbooks and see if they
can agree on accounts of controver-
sial matters which seem fair in
all the countries concerned.
Through a series of publications
we are encouraging teaching about
the United Nations and its essential
role in keeping the peace and pro-
moting the common welfare of
mankind. I think you will agree
that these are all important things
to do through Unesco.
Now \shat do you think could be
done in your school to give you a
better understanding of other peo-
ples, and of the United Nations and
its \vork ? And how could that be
done without overcrowding the
time-table so that vou yourself
would protest ? You will be reading
this article either in English or in
French or in Spanish. If you like
to think this problem out in terms
of your school and talk to your
friends and vour teachers about it
and then write to me in whichever
of the three languages you use I
"will be interested to read what you
write. And if I do not have time to
discuss what you say in detail I
will at least thank you from our
Unesco headquarters.

'THE CHILDREN FIGHT FOR LIFE'
IN the aver-j age Amer-
ican home
blessed
with young
children, the
parents have
three constant
problems.
One is to in-
duce the chil-
dren to eat properly-to down the
spinach before the dessert. An-
other is to make them dress pro-
perly-rubbers in the rain, muf-
flers in cold weather. The third
is to get them to the doctor or den-
tist-on schedule.
But, for most American children,
the spinach, the, rubbers and the
doctor are available.
For more than half the children
on earth they are not.
There are about 900 million
children under fifteen on earth
today. More than half-about 500
million-live and die in want.
The youngsters may never have
tasted milk, or worn shoes or visit-
ed a doctor. But they are famil-
iar with hunger and cold and
disease.
The only organization that even
begins to answer their needs is
UNICEF-the United Nations In-
ternational Children's Emergency
Fund.
Its total expenditures have been
less than the cost of a single air-
craft carrier. What in the world,
you may ask, can UNICEF do with
so little money ? That is a long,
exciting, heart-warming story.
It began in 1946. In Europe,
there were 30 million children in
dire need as a result of the war.
First, they needed food. As soon
by E. leanor ROOSE. VE. L T
as the United Nations General As-
sembly had set up the organization
and the United Nations Appeal for
Children had brought in some
money, UNICEF began to supply
food, in the cheapest, most nutri-
tious form : dried skim milk.. That
winter three million children in the
eleven European countries hardest
hit by aggression received enough
milk to keep them alive.
They needed clothing, too. UNI-
CEF got raw materials-cotton,
wool and leather-and these coun-
tries made them into dresses, suits
and shoes.
Tuberculosis was reaching epi-
demic proportions. UNICEF join-
ed the Scandinavians-who start-
ed on their own-and, With a pre-
paration called BCG, launched
campaigns of vaccination against
tuberculosis in children. That
programme has developed into
history's largest mass vaccination
campaign.
Picture a European child, in the
early post-war emergency, being
given a cup of milk, a blanket or
a pair of shoes, a vaccination.
Now picture UNICEF's later
development.
A 13-year-old Filipino boy was
night-blind, could not see at all
after dark. One night he failed to
arrive home before sunset. His
frantic parents sent out searching
parties. While they were beating
the woods, his mother heard
someone approaching the house.
Because of the firm, rapid step,
she knew it could not be her Jose.
But it was !
"Mama,"Jose shouted,"I can
see !"
At school, for the past few
months, José had been getting
shark-liver oil capsules from UNI-
CEF. They contain vitamin A,
lack of'which causes night-blind-
ness. Playing baseball, José had
been late starting home.
The"cup of milk"still is basic
in the UNICEF programme. (An
Italian child, asked what UNICEF
meant, said :"It is the American
word for cow".) But it is impor-
tant to note that the number of
children"sitting around the UNI-
CEF food table"has declined from
an early post-war figure of seven
millions to half that. Of those
still being fed, about 575, 000 are
refugees or are living in drought-
stricken areas. They get skim
milk to keep them alive.
But the rest of the milk supply
goes for different purposes. In
Africa, 340, 000 children get skim
milk to combat a common diet
deficiency condition called kwashi-
orkor. In Central America, the
milk is distributed in UNICEF
assisted demonstrations to show
its value in improving general
child health, so as to encourage
permanent, locally maintained
school-feeding programmes. In
Asia, Latin-America and the east-
ern Mediterranean the milk goes
to maternal and child-welfare
centres.
Along with the milk goes fish-
liver oil-cod-liver oil to be taken
by the spoonful or concentrates in
capsule form. An important med-
ical target is rickets, but the over-
all aim is to set up proper diet as
a means to better general health.
This would be of little lasting

value if under-developed countries
"went on depending on outside food
sources.
So, with the help of another UN
agency called the Food and Agri-
cultural Organization, UNICEF
began to teach people haw to
increase their own milk production
and how best to use what they had,
by pasteurization, refrigeration and
drying.
Out of milk conservation equip-
ment provided by UNICEF, four-
teen countries in Europe, the
Middle East and Latin-America
soon will offer safe, low-cost or
free milk to four million children.
From the beginning, UNICEF
has required that all countries
requesting assistance match UNI-
CEF's aid, on a dollar-for-dollar
basis, with home-supplied effort.
Many have done more-they have
become substantial contributors to
the Children's Fund as a whole.
The"matching"principle goes
far. Of seven million dollars'
worth of textiles ant leather goods
distributed by UNICEF up to the
middle of 1951-two all countries in
Europe, and to Japan and Korea in
Asia-all were processed within,
or at the expense of, the receiving
country, except in Korea. For
Korea, Japan did the processing.
Result of such"matching" : for
the seven million dollars advanced
by UNICEF, at least one garment
or a pair of shoes apiece for five
or six million youngsters.
Dr. Roger P. Stewart has a story
of his UNICEF'work in Greece
that puts the breath of life into
these dull figures :
In a rain-drenched Greek village,
shattered by war, he was giving
out blankets. Outside the tent,
mothers and grandmothers stood
hopefully in the downpour. There
was nothing Dr. Stewart could do
for them. His charges were the
children-shivering, half naked,
shoeless.
Inside the tent, the youngsters
received half-soaked blankets with
incredible delight, tucked them
under their tatters and ran home.
But one tiny five-year-old had
stayed at Dr. Stewart's side all
through the proceedings, though
told his family's quota had been
filled. He kept looking at Dr. Ste-
wart with dark, trusting eyes.
The pile of blankets dwindled to
nothing-and still he remained.
Dr. Stewart remembered some-
thing in his car-an indescribable
garment found in a batch of
gift clothing, halfway between a
night-shirt and an overall ; rainbow
coloured, partly cotton, partly wool
- and frilled.
Dr. Stewart got it out of the car
and offered it.
The five-year-old eyes opened
wide. There was a squeak of
rapture.
And another UNICEF'worker
saw how little it takes to win the
eternal gratitude of children.
Child health is a small phrase-
with big meanings. Current
authorized programmes, assisted
by the UN's World Health
Organization, call for 58, 900, 000
youngsters to be tested for tuber-
culosis. Of these, one-third to
on-half will be vaccinated with
BCG anti-tuberculosis serum. For
yaws, bejel and syphilis, 23
million, are to be examined, and
all cases of infection will be
treated.
Against malaria and other in-
sect-borne diseases, protection is to
be provided for 20 million, chiefly
in the form of DDT sprayings.

AFTER A SPECIAL COURSE AT THE INTERNATIONAL CHILDREN'S CENTRE INPARIS, A FINNISH PHYSICIAN EXAMINES AND THEN TREATS A SICK CHILD ION LAPLAND (UN PHOTO).
Smaller projects, such as immu-
nization against whooping cough
and diphtheria, will reach one and
a quarter million children.
Will all this really be done ?
Sceptics may note that in Asia
alone 9 million youngsters already
have been tested for tuberculosis
and 3, 200, 000 vaccinated ; 2 million
examined for yaws and 3i5, 000
treated ; 1, 500, 000 protected against
malaria.
"Training"is the key word in
much of what UNICEF does.
The first thing is to show people
what is best to do. But the next
and perhaps most important step
is to train native technicians to
handle the procedures scienti-
fically. After that, the technicians
train other technicians in an ever-
widening circle.
All UNICEF can do is to provide
a nucleus of knowledge and initia-
tive, a mobile corps to be sent to
trouble spots and a store of up-to-
date"demonstration"materials.
Ideally, that is all UNICEF ought
to do, since it hopes simply to teach
people how to help themselves.
Nevertheless, UNICEF already
has given direct aid to 42 million
children in 64 different countries.
Current programmes will raise
those figures to 60 million children
in 72 countries.
When UNICEF medical supplies
and food and clothing began to go
out all over the globe, it was
proposed that the name should be
translated into various languages,
or at least that the initials forming
it should be translated into the
various alphabets. But there was
a standard UNICEF symbol stamp-
ed on each packing case. And
before much should be done about
the translation,'"UNICEF"had
become an actual word on the
banks of the Ganges in India, near
the Arctic Circle in Finland and
along the Equator in Brazil and
Ecuador.
The'word is permanent in the
minds of those grateful peoples.
But UNICEF is set up as a tempo-
rary agency, a sort of step-child
whose future is always uncertain.
The"E"still stands for emergency,
though the needs of 500 million
children in want are anything but
temporary. My hope-and the
only practical salvation for those
500 million children-is that UNI-
CEF will be made permanent.
Thirty little orphans in a convent
on a border between Jewish and
Arab territories symbolize one
reason for my hope. UNICEF
has sent food to the convent since
1948, when fighting disrupted the
area and children began to starve.
Not long ago, the five-year-olds
decided to show their gratitude.
With pieces of cardboard, bits of
coloured stone and strips of satin,
they lovingly fashioned and dress-
ed a ten-inch high figure. Gleam-
ing, the figure stands on an altar
in the kindergarten, where all can
see and remember to give thanks
to their benefactress.
Her name ?"Mademoiselle UN-
ICEF."
I want Mademoiselle to go on
helping them-and helping all the
other millions of children in the
world who so desperately need her.

THE ENCHANTMENT
UNESCO,-,
OF THAILAND
by Leonard COTTRELL
Two centuries ago, King Rama I chose the small village of Bangkok as the site for his new capital.
Today it is a city of 800, 000 people, whose skyline is studded with the elaborate roofs and spires
of 400 temples, one of which, the Royal Temple, is shown above. (Unesco photo)
SIAMhat does the name con-jure up ? Pagodas with steep,
many tiered roofs of red and
green tiles, with gilded, pointed
eaves ? Buddhist priests in yellow
robes gliding among the tricycle
taxis and swarming traffic of Bang-
kok ? A group of dancers in scarlet
and green robes spangled with gold,
and high, golden head-dresses, mov-
ing gracefully through the move-
ments of the classical dance to the
clashing music of xylophones and
high, thin, flutes ? Those who have
visited Thailand-the modern name
for old Siam-will certainly recollect
those impressions, as I do whenever
the name is mentioned.
But there is another side to
Thailand. In Bangkok, the capital,
one can buy practically everything
the West can provide ; the latest
motorcars, refrigerators, washing
machines, cameras, radiograms. You
can even buy television sets, although
Thailand as yet has no television
service. Transmitting equipment,
however, has been ordered. There are
luxurious hotels, restaurants with a
European cuisine, and, in the sub-
urbs, beautiful modern villas set in
landscape gardens, and as'well-
appointed as any in London or Paris.
Yet, side by side with huge modern
ferro-concrete cinemas showing Hol-
lywood Sims, cheek by jowl with the
modern banks and office blocks, are
the ancient"klongs"or canals on
which lives an enormous, literally
floating population of Thai families
in covered-in boats. And as one
drives beyond the broad, smoothly-
asphalted Raj-Damnem Avenue one
comes upon dusty lanes between
rows of wooden houses raised on
stilts above the flood-water, and sees
mothers washing their babies in the
same muddy water from which most
of them have to drink.
It is partly this clash between East
and West that has brought about the
need for new educational methods in
Thailand. Not only is there an ur-
gent need for Thai technicians to
operate western machinery ; en-
gineers for the power-houses, build-
ers. garage mechanics, machinists
and so on, but, in the words of a Thai
teacher"it is necessary to make the
children understand the relationship
between nations, to make them
know their own country better and
to understand their
responsibility to
improve it."
Thailand has had
compulsory educa-
tion for more than
thirty years and
big advances have
been made in that
time. All the same
the Government
believes that sub-
stantial improve-
ments could be
made in the teach-
ing methods. In
1949, it invited
Unesco to send out
a survey mission
to study the coun-
try's educational
system, especially
in the primary and
secondary schools.
After. considering
the recommenda-
tions made by this
mission, the Thai
Government decid-
ed on a ten-year
plan to improve
education in all its
aspects-pre-pri-
mary, primary, sec-
ondary vocation-
al, adult, and tea-
cher training. It
then invited Unes-
co and other UN
Specialized Agen-
cies such as the
Food and Agricul-
tural Organization
and the Interna-
tional Labour Offs-
ce, to take part
in an experimental
educational pilot
project in the area"',.. n....'".........-nl1. f.". round Cha-choeng-sao, a small town
some seventy miles from Bangkok.
In this area there are a number of
Thai schools, Primary and Second-
ary, and at Cha-choeng-sao itself
there is a Teacher Training College.
The idea is that in this limited area
an attempt will be made to introduce,
into certain selected schools, the
new methods recommended by the
United Nations commission. If the
Pilot Project is a success, then the
Government of Thailand may intro-
duce similar methods in schools
throughout the entire country.
I travelled by train from Bangkok
to Cha-choeng-sao, through mile
after mile of completely flat country.
Immediately outside Bangkok there
are a few trees, chiefly bamboos, and
here and there small cultivated plots
- long straight rows of vegetables
with irrigation canals between them,
and mew with bare feet and huge
straw hats moving among the plots.
Then come the rice-fields, mile after
mile of pale green-the green of an
English meadow in spring-stretch-
ing to the horizon. Thailand is one of
the greatest rice-producing countries
in the Far East and the country's
prosperity largely depends on the
quality of the rice crop.
Cha-choeng-sao itself is a small
town, built mainly of wood, like
most Thai country towns, and
standing on a broad, brown river, the
Bangpakong. Scattered around it,
on the riverside and beside the
innumerable canals, are smaller
villages, each with its wooden school-
building, usually with a balcony
overlooking the river. It is in these
schools that UN Agencies personnel
and their Thai"counterparts" (for
each adviser works alongside a Thai
teacher or"counterpart") are con-
ducting their experiment. The pro-
ject's headquarters is in a big
wooden building adjoining one of the
schools at Cha-choeng-sao, which is
now being extended to accommodate
members of the mission.
The Europeans and Thais live and
work together ; there are offlc, s, a
conference room, a dining-room and
dormitories, but life at Cha-choeng-
sao is by no means luxurious.
Water has to be carried from the
river in big earthenware jars, from
which one pours water over oneself
when taking a shower, which, during
nine months of the year is pretty
often. At night the staff sleeps
under mosquito nets, and DDT
sprays are used in the constant war.
against the insects which swarm in
after dark.
In spite of these discomforts, the
atmosphere is happy and comradely
at Cha-choeng-sao. One could hard-
ly help feeling happy in Thailand,
for the Thais are a friendly people,
generous almost to a fault. In fact,
I was told by one of my colleagues
to be very careful about accepting
hospitality, because, he said, it is
quite common for a Siamese official
to spend almost his entire month's
salary on entertaining a stranger,
and then have to borrow against his
next pay-day ! The U. N. advisers
and their Thai counterparts dine
together, and the discussions which
take place over the dining-room
table, or in the little riverside cafe,
are both friendly and outspoken.
"They work alongside us"the
head of the mission, Mr. Kendrick
Marshall, told me,"they watch our
methods and discuss them with us.
Sometimes they agree with us ; some-
times they have better ideas of
their own. But it's a joint effort all
along the line."
What are these new methods
which the Unesco consultants are
trying to put into practice, and how
do they differ from the older me-
thods used in Thai Schools ? A Thai
teacher to whom I put this question
replied :"The old system had its
good points but on the whole we
have come to think of it as too
stereotyped and academic. In the
old days education was the responsi-
bility of the Buddhist priests, and
even today you'll find that many of
our schools are still in the grounds
of old monasteries. Nowadays all

Thailand is anxious to accept the best of Western ideas and techniques. But the country is equally determined to maintain its deep-rooted cultural traditions such
as the teaching of the graceful classical dances. Here, United Nations photographer Eric Schwab, focuses his camera on two young classical Thai Dancers.
the teaching is done by secular
teachers, but often the methods are
out-of-date. The teacher just reads
out facts from a book, and maybe
draws a few diagrams on the black-
board, and the children are expected
to learn those facts by heart. There
is nothing to stir the child's imagi-
nation, nothing to encourage him to
use his hands, nothing to arouse his
interest in what is being taught,
whether it be history, geography,
science or any other subject.
I saw an example of the older
methods, which are still in use
throughout most of Thailand, when
I visited a class for five to six-year-
olds at a primary school, near Cha-
choeng-sao. When I arrived the
teacher was taking the class in
geography. The children squatted
on the bare wooden floor, resting
their exercise books on low benches
in front of them. There were no
maps on the walls, no models, no-
thing but a broken blackboard
before which the teacher stood
reading out facts about rivers and
mountains and estuaries, while the
bored children attempted to mem-
orize them. If it had been a
history class the method would have
been exactly the same.
Then, as a contrast, I visited an-
other school in which the new
methods are being introduced by
Thai teachers, guided by Unesco
consultants. An excited group of
children was sitting at desks arrang-
ed in a square around a big tray
containing sand. There were maps
and coloured diagrams on the walls,
and on the table beside the sand-
tray were twigs, leaves, and small
stones.
After asking questions about the
source of a local river, to which the
pupils were quick to respond, the
teacher invited the children to come
forward and make a model in sand
showing the source of the river and
its course from the mountains to the
sea. The children set to work eager-
ly, making first a model of a moun-
tain, then tracing channels in the
sand leading from the mountain to
the coastal plain, and planting twigs
and leaves as trees and rice-fields
beside their model river.
At another school I watched a
most fascinating experiment in
history teaching. The subject was
an episode in the life of King
Ramakamheng the Great, one of the
Thai kings of the Sukhotai period
(13th century). This King is one of
the heroes of Thailand. He de-
veloped his country's administration,
religion, and especially home and
industrial pottery-making.
After the teacher had described
certain events in the life of the King,
several small children came forward
dressed in the costume of the period.
One boy wearing a black jacket with
a gold belt, a long white robe
trimmed at the sleeves with gold, an
enormous black and gold hat and
pink trousers, who represented the
King, seated himself on a school
chair which served him as a throne.
His Prime Minister, played by an-
other small boy, and dressed with
similar magnificence, came forward
on his knees to receive the
commands of the King.
`We have given justice in our gov-
ernment", piped the little King,
"and if there are any abuses people
can address themselves to me. The
provinces are inspected by our own
chosen men, who are our eyes and
our ears... Let us do this work with
all our hearts so that in the future it
may provide a livelihood for our
people."
Then two even smaller boys ap-
peared, dressed in green jackets and
black skull-caps. They represented
Chinese craftsman whom King Ra-
makamheng introduced into Thai-
land to teach his people the art of
ceramics. These boys then handed
out modelling clay, and, to the ac-
companiment of singing, the chil-
dren set about making pots, vases
and dishes under the guidance of
the two"Chinese"potters.
The whole idea, of course, was to
turn what would probably have been
a dull lesson in history into some-
thing alive and interesting, some-
thing in which the children could
take an active part.
Another river-journey brought me
back to Cha-choeng-sao, just in
time to watch a demonstration of
science teaching by a Thai instruc-
tor, Mr. Singto. Under the old sys-
tem science teaching consisted sim-
ply of reading
facts from a
textbook for the
pupils to mem-

orize. There was
no experimenta-
tion or demon-
stration of anykind. The familiar science equip-
ment of a western school-retorts,
flasks, Bunsen burners, etc. were
absent, and it was economically
impossible to buy such equipment
in any quantity. So Dr. Obourn, the
first Unesco adviser on science teach-
ing, soon showed the Thais how to
make simple science equipment out
of local materials. For example,
Mr. Singto showed me glass flasks
made out of discarded electric light
bulbs, a galvanoscope manufactured
from a cheap pocket compass and a
few bits of wire, and a model steam
engine ingeniously constructed from
an old DDT tin (the boiler) and a
small brass pipe to lead the steam to
a tiny wind-vane which revolved un-
der the impact of the jet-a steam en-
gine of the original Greek type invent-.
ed more than 2, 000 years ago.
"This method of science teaching,"
said Singto,.'is quite new for Thai-
land. All we had here before this was
one funnel, one thermometer, and one
conical flask."
Agricultural training plays an im-
portant part under the United Nations
scheme. Mr. Dickinson, the FAO ad-
viser attached to the Cha-choeng-sao
Project told me that Thailand won
first place for rice-production at the
Chicago World Fair for several years
running..'And yet", he added,"at the
same time the yield of rice in Thailand
could be considerably improved."
This puzzled me for a time since I
knew that the Thais had thousands
of years experience in rice-farming.
How therefore, I asked Mr. Dickinson,
did the UN advisers think that they
could help these people to improve
their yield ?
"By selection,"he answered, and
took me to an experimental rice field
which is being looked after by the
students of the new primary exten-
, : ; ion school at Bangkla, a riverside vil-
lage some two hours'journey from
Cha-choeng-sao. Here I saw students,
under Mr. Dickinson's guidance, se-
lecting the best ears of rice and putt-
ing them aside for replanting during
the following season."When you take
tens of thousands of these,"Mr. Dick-
inson said,.'and select the very best,
then you proceed gradually to greater
yields and uniformity."
In this same village of Bangkla I
talked to Mr. Roger Wilson, an Eng-
lishman attached to the Project from
the International Labour Office as
consultant on Vocational Training for
the Cha-choeng-sao Centre. Before
he joined the ILO, he was connected
with a Technical Training College in
England. His last job before joining
ILO had been in Southend, in Essex.

in his shorts and open-necked shirt,

along the riverside, with its tall-\. chimneyed rice-mill, and the inevit-
able Wat or Buddhist temple, whose
glittering eaves reflected the hot
sunshine.
"The idea of the new primary
extension school at Bangkla"he told
me,"was that of Thomas WiLson, my
namesake, the original leader of the
Technical Assistance Mission. He
thought of it as a way of extending
the existing primary school system
which only lasts for four years for
children between the ages of seven
and eleven. This kind of school is to
provide a three-years post-primary
course based on practical work."
Wilson went on :"The idea is that
these children will be working in the
usual occupations in and around
Bangkla, in rice mills and in the rice-
fields, in sawmills and so on.
The training will be a sort of pre-
paration for life, although this does
not mean that the children are going
to be trained as artisans, solely. The
idea is that they should have a general
education as well as plenty of practical
work and the whole of the curriculum
will be based on the rural background
that the children understand."
After a two-hour river journey
I was back at Cha-choeng-sao. It
was my last night at the Centre and
a memorable one, not for any
information I received-I had already
taken in more than I could digest-
but as an experience of Thai
hospitality. The members of the
mission-Siamese, American, English,
Canadian, Czech-gathered in the
little riverside cafe. Healths were
drunk in Mekhong, with the local
ricewhisky, and afterwards, inevitably,
the local orchestra, composed of Thai
teachers from local schools, appeared.
Far into the night they played the old
songs of Siam, some of which had been
considerably influenced by American
"Swing", each member taking a
chorus on. his instrument and im-
provizing on the original theme with
amazing skill and rhythmic zest.
Early the following morning I was
on my way back to Bangkok, travelling
once again through the monotonous
landscape of green paddy-fields laced
by brown canals along which sampans
glided.
My last evening in Bangkok was
spent at the Silpakorn Theatre, the
Thai equivalent of a National Theatre.
Here students of the Institute of
Fine Arts present episodes from the
country's classical drama, based on
the ancient Hindu epic"The Ra-
mayana"which in Thailand is called
"The Ramakien". It was a masked
play, called in Thailand the"Khon".
Almost all the actors wore masks, and
mimed their parts, the voices being
spoken or sung by a chorus off-
stage. The costumes were mag-
nificent, scarlets and greens and
yellows spangled with gold ; towering
gold head-dresses, gold embroidery,
golden ornaments, all scintillating in
the brilliant stage lighting. The play,
which was more of a ballet than a
drama, took a leisurely course,
watched by the attentive Siamese
audience which knew every line of the
verse, every note of the music, every
movement of the dance. For more
than three-and-a-half hours I was
dazzled by the colour, bewitched by
the grace of the dancers, fascinated
by the music. The effect was such
that when eventually I left the theatre
and threaded my way through the
clamorous traffic of Bangkok I felt
confused and bewildered.
When I said to a Thai friend that
night,"as a Buddhist you have as
your ideal the attainment of serenity
of soul, inner peace", he agreed.
"Then,"I asked him,"how do you
expect to attain serenity of soul by
bringing in Western ideas, Western
hustle, Western machinery, auto-
mobiles, refrigerators and so on ?"
"The play which I saw tonight", I
continued,"was a superb work of art,
the product of a culture as old,
probably older than ours, something
supremely civilized and worth-while
Surely you don't want to exchange
that for canned music and Western
films ? It seems to me that you are
on the wrong track. Sometimes I
think that instead of the West
bringing technical assistance to the
East, the East should be bringing
spiritual assistance to the West !"
I said this to test his reactions,
adding that the Thais whom I had
met seemed a very happy people,
generous to strangers, contented,
smiling, serene, even if some of them
were relatively poor. His answer
was interesting, and did much to
strengthen my faith in what the
United Nations are attempting to do
in Thailand.
"It is true"he replied, after some
reflection,"that not all the things
which the West has brought to
Thailand are good things, although
many Thais like them. But you should
remember the good things too. Take
health for example. Those people you
saw in the country, and here in
Bangkok, living on the canals, bathing
in the same water from which they
drink, they are happy, it is true. But
only if they are well."
He paused and then added :"Have
you thought of the thousands who die
each year from malaria, typ. hoid and
Jther preventable diseases ?"
He went on to speak with high
praise of the work of the WHO team
operating in northern Thailand, and
reminded me that a huge area had
been cleared of that dreadful disease,
yaws, by the use of penicillin in-
jections. *'As for your fears that the
culture of Thailand may be destroyed
by Western innovations", he said,"I
don't think there is much fear of that.
You will never turn the Thais into
Westerners. Our religion and culture
are too deeply rooted for that. No ! I
think that in the end we shall take
the best which the West has to offer,
and leave the rest to you."

CHILDREN IN
WONDERLAND
by Andrea SALlE. R'
HAVE you ever heard a child's
excited voice echoing
through the halls of a
stately museum ? If you
haven't yet, you probably will one
of these days. For more school-
children are today visiting mu-
seums than ever before.
Grown-ups stilt seem to think
of museums as awe-inspiring
"shrines", or cold, dull mauso-
leums, with the result that many
adult persons are still frightened
to set foot inside one of them.
Children, however, react to
museums in a quite different
manner. To them the museum is
a land of wonder ; their eyes
wander all over the place, they
pick what they like, they walk
away, turn and come back. Some-
times it is only to touch a statue
that has caught their fancy ; other
times it is to draw an insect or a
piece of jewelry and really get to
know it. Even exhibits which
most adults would judge to be dull,
hold a fascination for young chil-
dren, and have life and a meaning
of their own.
Everywhere, museum curators are
gradually beginning to establish a
working partnership with the
school teacher. And although
only a short time ago such an idea
would have been a startling novelty
in many countries, museum di-
rectors now agree-many in fact
are loudly proclaiming-that
museums are meant for children
as much as for adults.
Today, in the United Kingdom,
in the Netherlands, in Sweden and
France, in Canada, Belgium, Switz-
erland, Poland and the U. S. S. R.,
museums are making a special
effort to get groups of schoolchil-
dren and young people to visit
their exhibits.
In the United States, such links
are already quite firmly estab-
lished, since schoolchildren there
regularly visit over 200 museums
of all types, quite apart from the 53
museums created specially for
children. The International
Council of Museums and Unesco,
incidentally, are encouraging and
co-ordinating many new depart-
ures in this field. Last year, for
example, Unesco organized an in-
ternational seminar at Brooklyn,
New York, whose object was to
speed the development in all coun-
tries of this type of co-operation.
From one discovery
to another
ADMITTEDLY, some schools seemto have an advantage over
others. Many a country
school-teacher must feel envious as
he reads reports of his colleagues
in the big towns, who have at their
very doors inexhaustible resources
for supplementing their classroom
teaching. Who but a teacher
working in a large city could, for
instance, write this account of how
his children improved their know-
ledge and skill as young potters ?
"The children in Grade 6 who
had been doing pottery work since
October had gone on from discos-
ery to discovery until they began
to feet dimly that they needed to
see iWhat others had done in the
same line. Up to that point, they
had learnt to use clay for them-
selves with no model before them.
I therefore suggested that we might
visit the Departments of Greek and
Egyptian ceramics in a museum to
study techniques... They split up
into twos and threes or went off
alone to stand before the show-
cases and start work... On the aver-
age, each child made about
castle. The big
tower isn't so
very old-only
the fourteenth
century. But
(Continued
on next pate)
twenty-five really good drawings
during the afternoon... The intel-
ligent appreciation they expressed
told me that they had grasped the
point straight away ; they could
"feel"the clay of works more than
a thousand years old taking shape
in their hand".
Many a rural school child, too,
must be envious of the city children
who at a science museum can learn
things which are always rather
hard to follow in textbooks. One
French girl of fourteen who studied
gravitation in this way wrote, when
she came back :"What a better
and clearer picture of the earth and
the heavens I got from my visit
to the museum... it has made me
want to learn more about mathe-
matics and science and helped me
see these subjects in a new light."
"Do you see that castle
over there ?"
AND yet there is no reason toponder regretfully over the
inevitable inequality between
town and country, between rich
and poor, or large and small
schools. Countless small schools
would spurn such sympathy. A
friend of mine who teaches in a
primary school in a small country
community certainly does not feel
deprived of resources."A mu-
seum ?" he says,"But I do have
one ! I've always had one. Don't
pity me because I cannot take my
pupils to a fine building full of
valuable collections. Just look
around you at this museum of
mine". And, with a sweep of his
arm he indicates the surrounding
countryside.
The average person would at
first see nothing but fields, a stream
fringed with poplars, a few roads
and two or three villages."Behind
that wood, over there", he says,
"we are digging clay, the
same red clay that potters have
been using for hundreds of years.
I have shards of Gallo-Roman pot-
tery at home that the children
found one day, and since then they
have been modelling the same clay
themselves. For art galleries we
have all the churches in the vici-
nity, a number of Renaissance
houses, not to mention an eight-
eenth-century mansion to which
my class pays a visit every year.
On the historical side, we have
plenty to study too, starting with
that castle over there."
The castle consists of two square
towers and the remains of walls
overlooking the valley. From the
main road you can see what looks
like an almost intact keep, arches
smothered in ivy and a sort of
apse built on the rock.
The conscientious sightseer leaves
his car and sets off up the hill,
through the vineyards, and up the
steep streets of the little town. We
can imagine the scene when he
arrives in the square and, standing
between the town-hall, the school
and the fountain, looks up at the
medieval battlements and turns to
question the first passer-by. Need-
less to say, he gets no useful infor-
mation. No one knows anything
except that"it's old", dating from
the"time of the feudal lords", and
that the children sometimes go and
play there with their teacher.
But when some children appear
on the scene, it is a very different
story. The visitor is immediately
surrounded by a band of eager
guies.-."Tf  know all about the

there was a fort here long be-
fore the castle was built and it may
even date back to prehistoric times
Therest of the castle was built in the
twelfth century, by a baron who
defended the country against pi-
rates. The land used to be part of
the Holy Roman Empire. And you
an see two beautifully carved
columns that are still standing."
They talk on and on proving that
their teacher has done a good job
with his"countryside museum."
My friend also talks of nature-
study rambles, explorations along
the stream, visits to local craftsmen
at work, or even of showing the
children something of modern in-
dustry a few miles away."I have
110 small-scale engine to show my
pupils, so 1 take them to the power
station."He says he uses in his
teaching"everything there is round
about, everything that is going on
in the district".
Sharpened observation
ONCE a teacher decides to appealto his pupils'powers of
observation rather than to
their verbal memory, to their curi-
osity rather than their obedience,
to their powers of thought and
judgment instead of to their
readiness to accept unquestioningly
what they are told, he cannot
be content to stay placidly in
the ciass-room. He feels com-
pelled to open the door and lead
the children out into the world,
where, after all,'the things he
teaches about mean something in
their own right. It is then clear
that it would be hard to keep teach-
ers and their pupils out of mu-
seums, whose real purpose is to
sharpen observation, to teach dis-
crimination and to satisfy curiosity,
without altogether exhausting it.
A young friend of mine who
visits the Metropolitan Museum in
New York regularly told me that
he was learning to open his eyes
and took. What he meant was that
he was becommg accustomed to
distinguishing and comparing. In
the Egyptian or Chinese Rooms he
has drawn up detailed lists, solved
minor archaeological problems,
made sketches and compiled tahu-
lar summaries,"just for the fun
of it", as he said. He was in fact
practising research. lIe was train-
ing himself in the art of seeing
things accurately, which is surely
of help to a man or woman ill
thinking accurately.
A little imagination
THE teacher from the-viHage-with-the-castle certainly
would have understood him.
For to this teacher, taking children
to a museum simply means"putting
them into touch with the true and
the beautiful". He admits, with a
shrug, that, if he lived in a ! arg {*
town he would probably be consi-
dered an extremist, for he would
be tempted to hold all his classes
in museums.
But he also adds that,"with a
little imagination"every school can
be the centre of an enormous,
living museum. In one place
there is a castle, in another a
mosque, in yet another a factory,
but in every place there are always
things that are true and beautiful,
to see, to touch and to understand.
He wilt'quote you Paul Va) ery's
words inscribed above the Palais
de ChaiIlot Museum in Paris :
"Friend, come not within these
walls where wonders are enshrined
unless desire bids you come".
"Children", he says,"are always
bidden by desire, and the world is
full of marvels ; all we have to do
is point to them."
CHILDREN HELP CHILDREN
OF OTHER LANDS
EARLY last February, while the world spas stillreading about the progress of rescue and relief
work in the flooded areas of the Netherlands,
Unesco received a letter from the organizer of a
public affairs lecture course in Cannes, on the French
Riviera. To his query as to how his group might
help to restore educational facilities for the children
of Dutch flood victims, Unesco had a ready answer ;
"Unesco Gift Coupon Project No. 100".
When this spontaneous offer of help came from
Cannes, the emergency gift project No. 100 entitled
"Flooded Schools in the Netherlands", had already
been announced. The project was Unesco's response
to a letter from Mr. Bart Lunenberg, former head of
the Unesco Centrum in Amsterdam, who wrote :
"Though no-one can yet know the extent of the
damage suffered by schools, it is certain that
throughout the area school equipment will have to
be replaced. Laboratory materials will have been
ruined. All books, wall maps, film strips, projectors
etc., will have been destroyed."
Gift Coupon Project No. 100 was soon under way
with, as its first contribution, a cheque for 15, 000
French francs donated by the lecture audience at
Cannes. Fifteen 1, 000 franc Gift Coupons were sent
to these students who have since posted them to the
Netherlands, earmarked as help for the restoration
of the flood-damaged schools. Meanwhile, Unesco
has learned that people in many other countries are
helping the stricken Netherlands schools by sending
Gift Coupons.
When a flood or an earthquake brings devastation
to a country, people elsewhere are quick to
sympathize and to send assistance. The plight of
children in such disasters is particularly poignant
and in helping them, most well wishers generally do
so in terms of food, blankets, shelters and medical
supplies. However, after these first needs have been
met, young people are still without schools, and the
schools, even if standing, are without equipment.
In more fortunate countries it is the children who
have been quick to understand this problem when
they have asked Unesco :"Is there anything WE can
do ?" They have been told :"Send Gift Coupons to
replace schoolbooks and other equipment."
Though less dramatic because they are relatively
widespread and of long standing, the educational
needs of children throughout most of Africa, Asia
and Latin America, are just as acute as those of the
youthful flood victims in the Netherlands. But
where grown-ups are sometimes inclined to take for
granted the serious handicaps to education in these
vast areas, their children, on the contrary, have
shown a keen and sympathetic awareness of the
problems whether they concern the needs of a deaf
child in Ceylon, or a juvenile delinquent in Manila
or a village schoolboy in West Africa.
"Boys'Town"in HanHa
TODAY, more and more people are learning ofthe handicaps suffered by young people in
many underprivileged countries, through the
Gift Project Catalogue of Unesco's Gift Coupon Pro-
gramme. In the two years since this programme
began, youngsters in the United States, France and
the United Kingdom, have befriended less fortunate
children in over a score of countries throughout the
world by sending them Gift Coupons with which to
buy school equipment and supplies. This year, they
are being joined by young people in Canada, Ger-
many, Australia, Denmark, Sweden, Cuba and
Japan-all of which have recently decided to join
the Gift Coupon Programme as donor countries.
Gift Coupons have been used to help give
educational opportunities to delinquent children,
and those handicapped by physical disability, by
economic privation and by the effects of war. And
many of them have been sent by children to help
children. For example, there is the story of Boys'
Town, Manila.
On the outskirts of Manila is a pleasant little
surburban community with its own shopping centre,
school, park, playground, chapel, library and town
hall. The population numbers about 250 youngsters
from 7 to 17 years of age. This is.'Boys'Town", a
model centre for rehabilitating juvenile delinquents.
When the teen-age girls of the Ecole Technique
St. Honoré in Paris heard about Boys'Town, Manila,
(Unesco Gift Project No. 32) they began selling 1, 000
twenty-franc Unesco souvenir stamps. The money
they raised bought twenty 1, 000-franc Gift Coupons
which provided blackboards and textbooks for Boys'
Town. Meanwhile, boys and girls of San Diego High
School, California, U. S. A., were selling 480 twenty-
five cent souvenir stamps to raise money for twelve
S10 Gift Coupons so that the Manila boys could equip
their manual training shop with carpentry tools.
Other French and American groups are also
helping this project. Gift Coupons, however, have
done more than simply provide for some of the needs
of Boys'Town. They have also resulted in the
growth of international friendships between its
young citizens and boys and girls many miles away.
To assist physically handicapped children all over
the world is one of the problems being tackled by the
World Health Organization and the United Nations
International Children's Emergency Fund. But while
medical care is of vital importance to blind, deaf and
crippled children, educational needs must also be
satisfied. Unesco has found that healthy children
are quick to realize that in the life of a paralyzed
child, books, films and toys and handicraft materials
are needed along with medical equipment ; that
blind youngsters need Braille reading and writing
materials, relief maps and musical instruments, as
well as shelter and guidance.
For this reason a school for blind and deaf children
in Ceylon has been a favourite Gift Project among
schoolchildren. Among their unseen friends around
the world, the Ceylon youngsters include pupils of
the Camden Street School, Glasgow, Scotland ; the
little girls of a Brownie Scout troop in Pittsburgh,
U. S. A., and the youthful members of an apprentice
training centre in Metz, France. Moreover, sub-
stantial help through Gift Coupons has come to the
Ceylon School from C. O. R. S. O. (Council of Orga-
nizations for Relief Service Overseas, Inc.), New
Zealand's leading overseas relief organization.
Most Popular of all
M ENT ALLY handicapped boys and girls in theschool for feeble-minded children at Jabuka,
""*'Yugoslavia, have been befriended by children
in scores of schools, including high school pupils of
Kidderminster, England and those at the Lycée des
Jeunes Filles, in Moulins, France, whose Gift Coupons
were used to buy coloured slides for the Jabuka
children.
Probably the single most popular of all Unesco
Gift Projects was the'''Ecole de Richard Toll"in
Senegal, French West Africa. Schoolchildren all
over France eagerly adopted this project, and
completely fulfilled it within a few months. This
means that books, periodicals, notebooks, slates,
crayons, water colours, maps, duplicating machines
and a film projector bought with Gift Coupons paid
for out of the pockets of French schoolchildren, are
now on their way to this remote African village
school.
Another special case is that of the 200, 000 school-
age children in the Arab refugee camps of the Middle
East. These youngsters are literally wards of the
United Nations, and schooling for some 65, 000 of
them is provided by Unesco and the United Nations
Relief and Works Administration.
Perhaps it is this or perhaps it is because, unlike
most children mentioned in Unesco Gift Projects,
these are homeless children, that explains why Gift
Coupon Projects relating to Middle East schools have
met with such a universal response. In 1951, the
first year of the Gift Coupon Plan, they received
nearly a thousand dollars worth of Gift Coupons-
intended for maps, globes, books and other classroom
needs. In 1952, contributions from the United States,
the United Kingdom and from donor groups in
France, increased this help many times over.
Among the latest of Unesco's Gift Coupon Projects
are those designed to bring aid to the young people
of Israel. Since 1948, when the United Nations
recognized Israel as a sovereign State, a tidal wave
of immigration has doubled the country's population.
To shelter these newcomers until housing construc-
tion could catch up with immigration, temporary
camps were hastily erected. There are 100 or more
of these"Ma'abarot" (Immigrant transit camps) in
Israel today, home for fully a quarter of a million
people.
Immigrants find that there is work for all in Israel- though many must learn new skills. While their
elders work, children attend school in the camps.
But after school or work, there is simply nothing for
young people to do ; nowhere for them to go.'''Home''
is a dark or stuffy tent or hut.
Eventful Ma'abarots
TODAY, something is. happening. Already in halfof Israel's hundred Ma'abarot, young people
are organizing community centres, starting
social activity programmes to replace the monotony
of after-school and after-work with group recreation.
Already in fifty communities group leaders are being
chosen to start youth centre activities.
But from the start these young people are faced
with a crippling handicap-the complete lack of
equipment in the Ma'abarot. They cannot learn
handicrafts without tools and materials ; they cannot
read without books ; they cannot make music without
instruments.
So to help them along the road, to a new life in a
new land, Unesco has developed a series of gift
projects for selected Ma'abarot youth centres. One
of these is in the camp at Gilath, not far from
Beersheba, where several times a week some 500
youngsters will come from the scattered camps and
settlements in the Negev desert.
The children themselves will help to construct
their centre, levelling playgrounds and sports fields,
erecting huts, planting their own gardens and farm
plots, building their own handicraft and carpentry
workshops. The skills they will thus learn are
essential to their future careers as pioneers in
the long-range development of this arid, but
potentially fruitful corner of the earth.

A great historic event is taking
place in Israel today. This
is no less than the making of
a new nation out of human
and cultural material the an-
tecedents of which go back
thousands of years, and the
development, of this new na-
tion into a modern democratic
community. Last December, as
scientific adviser on behalf of
Unesco, I had the good fortune to
be able to visit this land, and see
with my own eyes the changes that
are taking place there.
There is one thing in Israel that
immediately strikes the observer
and especially the social scientist.
It is the remarkable process of a
people's renascence and transfor-
mation. This differs in several
respects from what"normally"has
happened in history. In Israel, it
is confined to a very tiny area and
is to an unusual degree a controlled
and planned operation moving
with extraordinary speeed. This
means that events in Israet are
taking place under experimental
laboratory conditions. And it
means, too, that the social scientist
can study here a variety of im-
portant problems, so to speak"in
a test-tube".
This fact alone is enough to
attract the social scientist to Israel
today. In my own case, I will
admit that there is another, less
academic motive as well. It is : \
belief in the idea that man's pro-
gress in a world of hate will be
helped not so much by peace
propaganda as by a determined
effort to understand what actually
goes on between different human
beings, different social and racial
groups, between different national-
ities-in other words, to un-
derstand why people hate each
other and then to discover and
apply the remedies. This approach
may be slow and strenuous, but it
is functional. It is Unesco's
approach today, and I believe it is
one which fits our time and the
future.
More than 700, 000 people, or
about half of the total Jewish
population of the country, are new
Israelis, having arrived within the
last four years. The job of housing
them and getting them settled
presents staggering problems that
have to be solved by the State and
local authorities. The sharp drop
in immigration during 1952 (down
to only about 10 per cent of the
average for 1948-1951) gave the
country a breathing spell during
which it was possible to get all but
a few thousand permanently hous-
ed and settled. About 20 per cent

of the people are today rural
settlers, and theJY are, for many
reasons, the heart of the new
nation. The farmlands provide
desperately needed food, and also
provide the kind of community
life for the settlers which is the best
school for nationhood.
The rurat settlements, and espe-
cially the kibbutzim are the natural
melting pots of Israel. It is there-
fore a matter of urgent national
policy to attract more people to
them, and to train the youth for
rural life and work. In this re-
gard, too, the experiments that are1........' : _--.... __ : .. 1--... 1. =-being carried out III
the Israel laboratory
offer exciting perspec-
tives.
The trend of urbani-
zation is universal and
one of the striking
features of all modern
societies. How can it
be reversed, especially
in a population made
up of newcomers
whose background for
centuries has been
mostly urban ? Israel
has come up with
part of the answer,
in its rural commu-
nities, but there still
is a long way to go.
Looking at Israel, I
found that this coun-
try offers almost un-
equalled opportunities
for the study of the
kinds of problems
we need to under-
stand in order to live
better with each other :
problems of human
relations, of cultural
and social adjustment,
of community integra-
tion, of co-operation in
a society where most
people are strangers
to each other. These
problems are of vital
importance to Israel
right now and will be
for a long time to
come. They are equal-
ly important to many
other countries indi-
vidually, and to our
world at large.
It was in recogni-
tion of this fact that.
Unesco decided to stu-
dy Israel and in parti-
cular the methods
that are used there to
reduce tensions and
conflicts that inevitab-
ly arise within a new
population composed
of so many different
elements. Nations do
learn from each other
sometines. What can
we learn from Israel ?
This study is now
underway. It is being
conducted with grants
from Unesco and
other sources by a
group of leading Is-
raeli social scientists
from the Hebrew Uni-
versity and the Israel
Institute of Applied
Social Research, both
in Jerusalem. I doubt
whether any country
outside the United Sta-
tes could have made
available a group*. t----Tr' r- ibetter qualified for this study.
Apart from the high professional
standards of these men there is the
fact that social research in Israel
has for years been particularly
alert to these problems, and has
devoted much work to them.
The great transformation taking
place in Israel involves, among
other things, a rapid change in the
, working tools and the methods of
production and management. With
one bold morn the clock was set
forward from the age of a pre-
dominantly underdeveloped eco-
nomy and technology to that of our
mid-twentieth century.
Technological revolutions on
this scale raise serious problems
wherever thev occur. In Israel the
problems are aggravated by the
fact that the population is so hetero-
geneous and to a large extent
composed of new arrivals from
countries which must be classified
as"underdeveloped"from the
technological point of view, how-
ever advanced they may be in
other ways. This means that
in addition to the learning and
adjustment process which any
people has to go through in
entering the machine age, a
number of special problems are
people ? These and similar prob-
lems are the subject of a pilot
study now being conducted for
Unesco by Professor A. Bonne of
the Hebrew University who
explains the project in the follow-
ing terms :
"The immigration into the State
of Israel during the last four and
a half years included a very
considerable proportion of Oriental
Jews who came from countries
which are either completely agrar-
ian or on the verge of industriali-
zation. They experience in Israel

brought with them from countries
such as Yemen. Another problem,
which is beyond the scope of the
Unesco study but a topic of much
discussion, centres around the pres-
ervation of the ancient skills in
weaving, silverwork, etc. as an
enduring cultural tradition withm
the new industrial society. There
are many encouraging signs that
the old arts and crafts will not be
lost in Israel.
One of the most frequent re-
marks, heard in Israel today is :
What kind of a nation are we
ultimately going to be when the
posed for the people of Israel.
How does a person fresh from an
Oriental village or a North African
ghetto acquire the working and
and living habits of an industrial
civilization ? How does he become
the operator of complicated ma-
chines and exacting techniques
about whose existence he previous-
ly had no idea ? And how does he
avoid losing his numan dignity and
becoming an unhappy slave of the
machine rather than its master ?
How, finally, can porkers from
so many different social and cultur-
al backgrounds learn to work
together and develop in the indus-
trial milieu the kind of community
which will make all of them one
forms of production, industrial de-
vices and modern labour relations.
The problem of adjustment of la-
bourers coming from a purely
rural environment has been fre-
quently dealt with as a vital issue
in the schemes for the development
of backward regions. So far no
systematic investigation was made
with regard to the experience in
Israel with such workers who have
found employment in workshops
and industrial plants. The Unesco
enquiry is intended to fill this gap."
One of the fascinating aspects of
this study will be concerned with
the adaptation to the industrial
process of ancient handicraft skills

an end ? Or, how will the many
different people who have been
scattered for so long in so many
foreign lands and who have devel-
oped such widely differing cus-
toms be able to blend into one
people ? The answer, of course, IS
hidden in the future, and only a
future generation will know. This
is an accepted fact by the adult
generation of today. Theirs are
the problems of getting settled and
of adjusting themselves to the best

difficult and complicated condi-
tions. Theirs is not yet the Pro-
mised Land. But it will be if they
and especially the youth and the
children make it so.
As a social scientist with a
"Unesco bias"I was struck again
and again by the wonderful spirit
and the practical skill I witnessed
in the youth settlements, in the
children's villages and in the
youth training centres all over the
country.
In this field, too, Unesco takes
a good deal of interest and is
sponsoring another study which
is directed by Dr. S. N. Eisenstedt
vf the Hebrew University, all
immigrant youth. It is a vast
field which may yield important
results on the ways in which
young people are integrated into
a community, the conflicts which
have to he overcome in the pro-
cess, and the acute tensions which
) n such societies arise between the
older and younger generations.
Eighty percent of the popula-
tion today lives in towns and
other urban conglomerations.
What happens here ? These
thousands of people are living
close to each other physically.
But, largely strangers to each
other and lacking the close per-
sonal ties and the common tasks
that exist in the kibbutz commu-
nity, how are they living in terms
of human relations, of community
integration and co-operation ?
These are problems of tremen-
dous importance, I believe, not
only for the future of Israel, but
for national communities gener-
ally in which heterogeneous
urban populations must learn tn
live together peacefully and
successfully. These problems are
today being studied by sociolo-
gists in many countries, Israel
can profit a great deal from
these studies but here, too, Isreal
itself offers almost ideal labora-
tory conditions for study. Recently
Unesco undertook a small'"test
tube"study of these important
social problems in co-operation
with a pioneering enterprise just
being launched.
The new enterprise is the
Community Health Centre at Belh
Mazmil near Jerusalem, organiz-
ed under the auspices of the IIa-
dassah Medical Organization.
The Centre is established in a
brand new suburban settlement
of about 500 famijies. Beth Maz-
mil is, in fact, a miniature mod-
el of urban Israel and a cross-
section of the nation as a whole.
The Centre started its activities iu
the community by a comprehen-
sive survey of the entire copula-
tion, family by family, and indo-
idual by individual. The survey,
which is now nearing its comple-
tion, includes a sociological study
of the tensions between differ-
ent nationality groups, ten-
sions between new immigrants
and old-timers, and political
tensions. It is hoped that a
continuing observation of the
Community Centre by social'
scientists wit ! show how far this
new type of organization is
successful in reducing conflicts
within the settlement.
The Unesco projects in Israel
should be completed by the end
of the year. Of course this is
only a beginning and little more
can be done than scratching the
surface of the problems. It is
hoped, however, that others will
carry on the work and particu-
lady that the social scientists of
Israel will be encouraged to
continue the exploration of these
great human problems.
