27 Outer Space
Armchair Icarus
On day five of an historic eight-day space
mission which began on 3 February 1984,
the dream of Icarus was fulfilled when a
man soared alone in space, 280 kilometres
above the earth, without even a lifeline to
tether him to his mother space-craft. On his
twelve-minute maiden flight, the astronaut
could rely only on his special backpack,
looking for all the world like an armchair
that had lost its two front legs. This
Manned Manoeuvring Unit (MMU), as it is
called, is powered by compressed nitrogen
thruster jets operated by controls situated
on the arms of the "chair". The develop¬
ment of the MMU opens up immense
possibilities for a whole new range of ac¬
tivities in space. Already members of a
subsequent mission, using MMUs, have
succeeded in repairing in space the failing
Solar Maximum scientific satellite, giving it
a new lease of useful life relaying to earth its
observations of the sun.

The
UnescoCourier
A window open on the world
Editorial September 1984
37th year
WITH this special issue of the Unesco Courier we
offer both an invitation and a challenge to our
readers. We invite you all to join us on a voyage of
exploration of our Universe, a voyage that ranges from the
heart of the atom to the outermost limits of space, from the
beginning of time to eternity. We challenge you to give full
rein to your imagination ás we enter the realm of the
unseeable, of the infinitely large and the infinitesimally
small.
Isaac Newton, that giant among scientists, was not the
first man to see an apple fall to the ground. He was,
however, the first to make the daring leap of the imagination
which enabled him to see that a falling apple and the Moon
circling the Earth were governed by the same force gravity.
Yet when questioned, Newton confessed that, although he
knew how gravity behaved, he did not really understand how
it worked.
So those who find this voyage of discovery difficult to
comprehend fully are in good company.
Much of science is concerned with things we cannot see
gravity, sub-atomic particles, light waves, the heart of a star,
the galaxies at the outer limits of space. Yet human curiosity
about the origins and future of our Universe drives us
remorselessly on to probe these mysteries.
In attempting to draw up a balance sheet of where we
stand today in this unending quest, to draw a picture of the
unseeable, we are obliged to use the language of the everyday
"seeable" world. Like the poet, we have to fall back on
metaphor and simile. This is why we invite you to bring your
imagination with you on this voyage of discovery.
As a teenager in Berne, that other giant scientific genius,
Albert Einstein, asked himself "What would the world look
like if I rode on a beam of light?". From this innocent but
imaginative question sprang the whole of modern physics
and the best explanation yet available of the origins of our
universe.
Einstein sought explanations but never ceased to marvel at
the wonder of the music of the spheres.
For him there was no conflict between the findings of
science and the profound cosmological insights of the
religions of the world. "The eternally incomprehensible
thing about the world", he wrote, "is its comprehen-
sibility".
Come along with us, then as we try to signpost the way
towards an understanding of our universe, towards an un¬
ending vista of profound delight.

WHERE do we come from? The most fundamental
question in all of science concerns the ultimate
origin of the Universe in which we live, and it is
arguably the greatest achievement of science to be able to
answer that question, not yet with complete precision but
already sufficiently accurately to satisfy all but the most
probing of questioners. The modern picture of the Universe
is one of expansion. Clusters of galaxies move apart from
one another as the space between them expands, and that can
only mean that long ago the galaxies were closer together.
The implication is that at a certain time in the past, which can
be calculated as roughly 15 thousand million years ago, all
of the matter and energy in the Universe was concentrated in
a mathematical point, a singularity, from which it burst out
to create the Universe as we know it. That outburst has been
dubbed "the Big Bang".
The image of the Big Bang Universe is one of change and
evolution, yet as recently as the early 1920s astronomers
believed the Universe to be constant and unchanging. At that
time, it was thought that the stars which make up the Milky
Way were the Universe, and that although individual stars
might be born, live and die, the Milky Way itself continued
more or less unchanged, just as a forest may remain more or
less unchanged even though individual trees grow, live their
lives and die. But this image of stability was shattered in the
1920s by a combination of new developments in both theory
and observations.
The theory came from Albert Einsteinit was his General
Theory of Relativity, published in 1917. General Relativity
describes the nature of gravity, and the Universe at large is
dominated by gravity. In terms of Einstein's equations,
gravity is thought of as bending space (more accurately,
space-time), and the amount of matter there is in the
Universe determines the extent to which space is curved. In
Einstein's view of the Universe, empty space, or space-time,
is something that has a dynamic life of its own, bending, ex¬
panding or contracting in accordance with well-defined laws.
Einstein, like all his contemporaries, believed that the
Universe was static and unchanging. He, was horrified to
discover that his equations predicted that space-time ought
to be expanding that the Universe should be getting
bigger and he "corrected" the equations by introducing a
new term, a "cosmological constant", to cancel out the ex¬
pansion and restore stability. In later years, he described this
as the biggest scientific mistake he ever made.
In the early 1920s, Einstein's equations describing the
nature of the Universe were refined by the Russian Alex¬
ander Friedmann, who produced the standard set of solu¬
tions to the equations in 1922. The Friedmann Models, as
they are called, provide two basic possibilities which remain
the basis for our understanding of the Universe today. Both
versions start from a singularity a state of infinite
densityand expand away into states of lesser density. But
space is curved according to the amount of matter in the
Universe, which leads to two alternatives. If there is less than
a critical amount of matter, the expansion must continue
forever, with galaxy clusters moving ever further apart. In
that case, the Universe is ' 'open" . But if there is more matter
than the critical amount, then gravity is strong enough to
curve space so much that the expansion is first halted and
then turned into a collapse, so that the Universe falls back
into a superdense state. Such a Universe is called "closed".

The echo of the Big Bang
It has been hailed as the most remarkable scientific observation
of modern times, and like many great discoveries it came about
by accident. In 1964 radio-astronomers Arno Penzias and
Robert Wilson of the Bell Telephone Laboratories in the United
States detected a baffling radio noise through the giant "ear
trumpet", a 7-metre horn antenna (right) with which they were
working on the development of a satellite communication
system. The noise seemed to come evenly from all directions
in the sky. It did not change as the months went by and, with
the rotation of the earth around its own axis and around the
sun, the antenna was pointed to different parts of the sky. It
could not be accounted for by any source on earth, in the solar
system, or in our galaxy. Could it be due to a fault in their equip¬
ment? Could it be caused by the pigeons roosting in the throat
of the antenna? The antenna was dismantled and rebuilt, the
pigeons were removed. But the noise in their microwave
receiver was still, inexplicably, there.
Then Penzias and Wilson heard about the calculations of a
Princeton University physicist, P.J.E. Peebles, who had
calculated that if the universe had originated in a Big Bang, a
massive amount of radiation would have been needed to pre¬
vent all the densely packed particles from fusing together into
heavy elements and to leave enough hydrogen and helium to
form the stars and galaxies of the universe as we know them
today. As the universe expanded, the radiation cooled, continu¬
ing to permeate the universe but in a weaker, more "diluted"
form. Peebles predicted that it should today be detectable as
radiation with a temperature of a few degrees above absolute
zero on the Kelvin scale. This immediately explained the origin
of the radio hiss heard by Penzias and Wilson: this cosmic radia¬
tion filling all of space was a distant echo of the Big Bang. The
excitement of astronomers at the discovery of a phenomenon
which seemed to confirm the Big Bang theory so conclusively
was mingled with the irony that radio telescopes of the 1 950s
would have been capable of detecting this background radia¬
tion, whose existence had been predicted in the mid-1 940s,
but no radio astronomers had looked for it. In 1 978 Penzias and
Wilson were awarded the Nobel Prize for their discovery.
Just at the time these new theoretical ideas were emerging,
astronomers were developing a series of large telescopes
which probed the nature of the Universe and showed how
parochial their earlier ideas had been. Our Milky Way
Galaxy, the mass of all the stars visible in the night sky, was
shown to be just one collection of stars among many in the
Universe. The Milky Way contains thousands of millions of
stars, a collection forming a flattened disc like an island in
space, but the Universe contains many millions of other
galaxies like this, separated from one another by truly empty
stretches of intergalactic space. The crucial discoveries con¬
cerning the nature of these objects came from a succession
of telescopes on mountain tops in California the 60-inch
reflector at Mount Wilson, completed in 1908; the 100-inch
at the same observatory in 1917; the 200-inch at Mount
Palomar in 1948. Edwin Hubble, working at the Mount
Wilson observatory from 1919 onward, first showed that
many faint patches of light in the sky could be resolved into
individual stars, and were island galaxies in their own right,
lying far beyond the Milky Way. He then made an even more
dramatic discovery. He found that distant galaxies show a
systematic red shift in their light, a red shift that is propor¬
tional to the distance of each galaxy from us.
This red shift literally involves a displacement of features
in the visible spectrum from their expected position towards
the red end of the spectrum. It is interpreted as a stretching
of the light waves, because red light is at the long wave end
of the visible spectrum (blue light has shorter wavelengths;
a compression of wavelengths would cause a blue shift).
There is only one plausible explanation for such a
phenomenon. The wavelength of the light is stretched
because the distant galaxy is moving away from us, in exactly
the same way that the note of a police or ambulance siren is
6
deepened if the vehicle rushes away from us. Hubble's
discovery in the 1920s that red shift is proportional to
distance was exactly the effect predicted by the Eins-
tein/Friedmann models, the effect Einstein tried to get rid of
with his cosmological constant. It doesn't mean that our
Galaxy is at a special place at the centre of the Universe, with
everything else moving out from it, because those distant
galaxies will "see" us in retreat from them. The motion is
relative. Imagine an expanding balloon, dotted with paint
spots and being inflated. Every spot "sees" every other spot
receding at a rate proportional to the separation of the two
spots, but none of the spots is actually moving across the
rubber of the balloon's skin (See page 16). Hubble's law
showed that the Universe is made the same way empty
space, Einstein's space-time, expands and pushes the galax¬
ies further apart, even though the galaxies themselves are not
moving through space.
Astronomers were intellectually aware of this in the 1930s,
and for three decades they lived with the implication that the
Universe must have had a definite beginning from which the
universal expansion had begun. But it was only in the 1960s
that this abstract intellectual concept became something
more concrete and immediate. The Big Bang was an abstract
concept, seemingly remote from the world of today. It
couldn't be seen, or felt, or touched, and astronomers seem
to have had no "gut feeling" that the idea was correct. And
then, in 1964 Arno Penzias and Robert Wilson, working at
the Bell Laboratories in the US, found a way to "touch" the
Big Bang.
Penzias and Wilson had been working with a sensitive
radio antenna and amplifier system studying faint radio
signals bounced off the Echo satellites. They also took the

opportunity to use this sensitive equipment to study the faint
radio noise of the Milky Way, and to their surprise they
found a weak, but uniform, signal coming from all direc¬
tions in space. Space the Universe seemed to be full of
very weak radio waves, with an energy equivalent to 3 K
(zero on the Kelvin scale of temperature is - 273 °C). This
is a very weak signal by everyday standards, but if it fills all
of space it adds up to a great deal of energy altogether.
Where had it come from? Princeton theorist P. J.E. Peebles,
working just a few miles away from Penzias and Wilson,
quickly came up with the answer. This weak, 3 K
background radiation must be the echo of the Big Bang
itself, the last trace of the fireball in which the Universe was
born.
The argument is simple. When the Universe was born out
of the Big Bang, it was very hot, full of energy as well as
matter. As space expanded, the radiation expanded as well,
so that space has always been full of this electromagnetic
energy. But as space has got bigger, the energy has been more
and more diluted. The density of the energy has got less, and
so its temperature has fallen. The temperature of the
background radiation today is exactly right for the amount
of expansion that must have occurred since the Big Bang,
and there is no serious alternative explanation for the
discovery made by Penzias and Wilson. Following that
discovery, astronomers had to accept, deep down in their
hearts, that the Big Bang was real, not just some interesting
quirk of the mathematical equations. Penzias and Wilson
received the Nobel Prize for their discovery in 1978, some
measure of the impact it made on science.
The discovery of the cosmic background radiation led to
new interest in the Big Bang. How, astronomers wanted to
know, could a superdense, superhot fireball of energy have
expanded and evolved into the Universe we see about us,
where stars are gathered into galaxies which move quietly
apart from one another in an expanding sea of space-time?
The universal expansion has long since been proved a reality;
we can take the temperature of the Big Bang itself, and we
know that the origin of the Universe lies in a fireball of ere-
"Shorthand"
for mathematicians
Any discussion of the universe and of particle
physics involves talking about both very large and
very small distances and quantities. We therefore
need a form of shorthand to express the very large
numbers involved. Conventionally, for example,
ten times ten times ten i.e. one thousand is ex¬
pressed as 103, one million is written as 106, and
1014 means a hundred million million. A similar
method is used to express very small distances or
quantities; one divided by a million i.e. one-
millionth is expressed as 10~6 The radius of an
atom, for example, is about 10~8 of a centimetre.
ation 15 thousand million years ago. Those were dramatic
discoveries in themselves to previous generations. But in the
past ten years even more dramatic progress has been made,
not by astronomers but by particle physicists whose work
with giant accelerators like those at CERN (the European
Organization for Nuclear Research) in Geneva has given
them an insight into the world of very high energies. We can¬
not, in fact, go back to the instant of creation, when the
Universe was infinitely dense and infinitely energetic, and
occupied a mathematical point with zero volume. But the
theorists can come pretty close to this. They now claim to
have pushed back the understanding of the Big Bang to the
point where they can explain how a minuscule object, a
Universe containing all the mass energy of our present
Universe packed into the volume of a proton, blew up into
something like the Universe we see today.
John Gribbin
Open or closed? The fate of the Universe
If we accept, as do most physicists today
(for alternative view see article page 1 3),
that the universe began with the "Big
Bang" and is expanding, is it possible to
deduce how it will end? There seem to be
two possible scenarios for the future and
the choice between them is finely balanc
ed. Everything hinges on just how much
matter there is in the universe. Just as
our solar system and all the galaxies are
held together by the attractive force of
gravity, so the total mass of the universe
exercises a steady pull on all its com¬
ponents. As the universe expands, im
pelled by the explosive force of the Big
Bang, this gravitational pull decreases.
But if there is enough matter in the
universe, gravity will eventually over¬
come the expansion which will gradually
slow to a halt. Like a film being run
backwards, the whole process will go in¬
to reverse, the universe will contract
faster and faster as the force of gravity
becomes increasingly ascendant until it
collapses back into another dense
fireball, perhaps to die for ever, perhaps
to expand again in another Big Bang. If,
however, the total mass of the universe
is insufficient to enable the gravitational
force to become predominant, the ex¬
pansion of the universe will continue for
ever. Cosmologists have attempted to
work out the total mass of the universe
by measuring the amount of matter in the
volume of space that we can "see".
Curiously, their estimates give an ap¬
proximate total mass for the universe
that lies within the critical zone between
these two possibilities. The fate of the
universe is balanced on a knife edge.

The infinitelybig
by Dimitri V. Nanopoulos
Spiral nebula (M81), In Ursa Major.
UP to a few years ago, particle
physicists were mainly con¬
cerned with the structure of
matter and the fundamental laws of
nature at very small distances of the
order of 0.0000000000001 centimetres
(10"13) or smaller. At the same time,
astronomers and astrophysicists were
trying to understand the large-scale
structure of the Universe which involv¬
ed thinking in terms of distances
measured in light-years (the distance
that light, which travels at 300,000
kilometres per second, traverses in one
year). It is fair to say that the relations
between these two active branches of
physics were rather remote.
During the past few years, however,
the situation has changed dramatically;
the "Big Bang" theory of the origin of
the Universe (see article page 5) has
developed to the point where the first
fractions of a second of the birth of the
Universe have become the meeting
point of the infinitely big and the in¬
finitesimally small*.
In order to appreciate this point we
have to recall two fundamental prin¬
ciples of physics: first, that high
temperatures imply high energies for
the particles around; and second, ac¬
cording to the "Uncertainty Principle"
formulated by the famous German
physicist Werner Karl Heisenberg
(1901-1976) high energies are necessary
to probe very small distances.
* The layman tends to picture the Big Bang in
terms of a very dense lump of matter (which
scientists call a "singularity"), located in an in¬
finite void, suddenly exploding. Einstein,
however, has shown that both space and time
(which he called space-time) and matter were in¬
separable. The Big Bang, therefore, created not
just matter but space-time as well. There was
nothing, not even empty space, "outside"for the
Big Bang to explode into.

cosmology and is a staff member of the

author of Grand Unification With and Without
Supersymmetry and Cosmological Implica¬
tions, to be published this year.

According to the Big Bang theory,
the very early Universe (say 10 35 of a
second after the Big Bang occurred)
was very hot, reaching temperatures
above 1028 degrees on the Kelvin (K)
scale. At these temperatures particles
had enough energy to interact at very
very small distances, say 1029 cen¬
timetres. Thus the very early Universe
acted like an enormous particle ac¬
celerator. Today, the fundamental con¬
stituents of matter are believed to be
quarks and leptons. Atoms, which at
one time were thought to be indivisible,
are made up of protons and neutrons
(known collectively as baryons) and
one member of the lepton family, the
electron; protons and neutrons are
made up of quarks.
These fundamental constituents of
matter interact with each other through
at least four fundamental forces: the
gravitational force, which, for in¬
stance, keeps the Earth going round the
Sun, the strong force, which keeps
quarks inside protons, the electro¬
magnetic force, that keeps the electron
going round the atomic nucleus, and
the weakforce, responsible for neutron
disintegration, otherwise known as
Beta-decay.
During the past few years, the world
of particle physics has enjoyed enor¬
mous progress towards simplification
and deeper understanding. Indeed, it
now seems that all the observed fun¬
damental interactions between these
various forces may well be simply dif
ferent faces of a single basic interaction
explicable by a basic unified theory.
Because we live in a Universe of large
distances (or low energy levels) it is dif¬
ficult for us to recognize this basic sym¬
metry at first glance; things look very
diverse. Yet as we examine shorter and
shorter distances (or higher and higher
energy levels), the diversity diminishes
and the symmetry becomes more ap¬
parent. The analogy of ice, water and
steam may help here. As we increase
the temperature and pass from ice to
water, particles possess more and more
freedom to move around and thus the
system increases its symmetry, which is
further increased when we pass from
water to steam.
The idea of unification is not new.
Einstein himself spent the last thirty
years of his life unsuccessfully at¬
tempting to formulate a simple,
definitive theory that would explain the
existence of all matter, all energy and
all the forces of the Universe. Right up
to his death, in 1955, Einstein con¬
tinued working to establish unity bet¬
ween the forces of gravity and of
electromagnetism.
It was, however, in the small-scale
realm of sub-atomic particles that the
next advance towards unification was
to be made. This is a world ruled by the
weakforce, which causes certain forms
of radioactive decay, and the strong
force, which holds quarks imprisoned
in protons and neutrons.

and the infinitesimally small
A hydrogen atom
The first step, the unification bet¬
ween electromagnetic and weak in¬
teractions, was first envisaged
theoretically in the 1960s and then pro¬
ven experimentally, only last year, in
the giant accelerator at CERN (The
European Organization for Nuclear
Research), in Geneva, with the
discovery of particles, named simply W
and Z particles, that carry the weak
force.
Because of similarities between the
mathematical formulae describing the
strong and the weak forces, physicists
began to suspect that they might both
be breakaways from a single unified
force that existed at the very earliest
phase of the Big Bang.
The next step in the unification pro¬
gramme therefore would be to explain
how the strong force fits into the pic¬
ture, and this is what is being attempted
in current theories known as "Grand
Unified Theories" (GUTs). The final
stage in the unification programme will
be to include gravity, but this need not
concern us here.
According to Grand Unified
Theories, the strong forces should
unite with weak forces at enormously
higher energies, around 1024 electron
volts. But although we now have at our
disposal particle accelerators which
enable us to probe the weak forces, it
would be impossible ever to get ac¬
celerators powerful enough to probe
the strong forces. So we have to be
smarter and look for indirect evidence
for grand unification.
Certain characteristics of GUTs are
very relevant to the early universe. One
of the most dramatic consequences of
GUTs is that they imply the instability
of matter. Whereas, prior to the
development of GUTs, protons, and
thus atoms and thus matter, were con¬
sidered to be absolutely stable, GUT in¬
teractions imply the decay of the pro¬
ton, just as weak interactions cause the
decay of the neutron. Eventually, it
seems, all the matter in the Universe as
we know it will be destroyed.
However, while the free neutron
lifetime is about fifteen minutes, the
proton lifetime is longer than 1030
years which is long enough to avoid im¬
mediate panic if we recall that the pre¬
sent age of the universe is merely 1010
years. For the first time "eternity" has
been given a quantitative measure of
the order of 1030 years. Experiments
are now being made to verify this for¬
midable GUT consequence.
What has all this intricate detail
about the world of sub-atomic particles
to do with cosmology? There is enough
experimental evidence to convince us
that standard Big Bang cosmological
theory may reflect' something close to
reality. Nevertheless, there are fun¬
damental unanswered questions within
Big Bang cosmology- _Why is the
Universe so homogeneous and
isotropic (the same everywhere and ex¬
panding uniformly in all directions)?
à M

Why does the Universe, despite its
rather old age (1010 years), possess
such high mean energy density? Why is
it that there seems to exist much more
matter than anti-matter? How are the
density fluctuations created that even¬
tually act as seeds for the formation of
galaxies and other structures observed
in the Universe? A lot of these ques¬
tions are finding satisfactory answers
in grand unified theories.
In the first fiery instant of the Big
Bang the Universe was superhot and
superdense and a single unified force
prevailed. But, as it was expanding, it
cooled down and became less and less
dense, and, in a process called "sym¬
metry breaking", the single unified
force began to fragment.
It is reasonable to assume that, after
the Big Bang, all kinds of particles were
interacting frenetically with each other
in a state of what is called thermal
equilibrium. Given this "soup" of par¬
ticles, and assuming that grand unified
theories correctly describe their inter¬
actions, can we build up a picture
which corresponds to the observable
Universe? The answer is a cautious yes.
As the Universe expanded and cool¬
ed further it eventually reached what
physicists call the GUT transition
phase where the strong and weak forces
The principal tool used by physicists to
probe the secrets of the world of the In¬
finitesimally small Is the particle ac¬
celerator, or "atom smasher". Atom
smashers are huge machines In which
atomic particles are accelerated to fan¬
tastic speeds and made to collide with
other particles so that physicists can ex¬
amine the resulting sub-atomic debris. It
was In the atom smasher at CERN (the
European Organization for Atomic
Research), in Geneva, until last year the
world's most powerful accelerator in
which beams ofprotons and anti-protons
can be made to collide with a total energy
of 540 thousand million volts, that the W
and Z particles which carry the weak
force (see article) were recently
discovered. Left, aerial view of the

anti-particles, which meets the re¬
quirements of both the theory of relati¬
vity and of quantum physics, has been
fully verified experimentally. High-
energy collisions Induced in particle ac¬
celerators seem always to yield particles
and anti-particles (matter and anti¬
matter) in equal quantities. When we
move away from the laboratory,
however, we never seem to encounter
anti-matter. Our world is made of atoms
consisting of protons, neutrons and elec¬
trons, but never of their anti-particles.
Recent findings in cosmology and parti¬
cle physics, which have given rise to the
new Grand Unified Theories (see article),
offer an explanation of how this asym¬
metry between matter and anti-matter
came about. Above, diagram (1)

split and grand unification was no
longer apparent. This happened when
the Universe was about 1035 of a
second old and had a temperature of
KFK.
This is a period of fundamental
cosmological importance since during
this transition phase a period of
supercooling the Universe experienc¬
ed a brief, hyper-explosive spurt of ex¬
ponential growth, a period in which the
Universe expanded at a very much
faster rate than during any other phase.
The advantage of this "inflationary
scenario" as it is called is that this sud¬
den, brief period of extremely rapid ex¬
pansion of the Universe provides a
solution to the problem of how parts of
the Universe, which would otherwise
have been too far apart to be in causal
contact with each other come to have
similar temperatures. Our large
Universe is very uniform because it has
been inflated from a tiny uniform seed.
The inflationary model solves the
problem of the high average energy
density of the Universe as well as pro¬
viding the correct form, qualitatively
and quantitatively, of the energy densi¬
ty perturbations needed for galaxy
formation.
The inflationary model also provides
the answer to another crucial problem.
How is it that more matter than anti¬
matter was produced from the Big
Bang?
Grand unified theories predict the
existence at the very high temperatures
of the very early phases of the Big Bang
of superheavy "X particles" which
decay into less massive particles and, in
so doing can produce an unequal mix-
10
ture of matter (baryons) and anti¬
matter (anti-baryons). At a time just
lO35 seconds after the Big Bang the
temperature had fallen to a level at
which no further X particles could be
made and a slight asymmetry (one un¬
paired baryon per thousand million
baryon/anti-baryon pairs) was locked
forever into the expanding Universe.
This small excess of matter over anti¬
matter the afterthought of creation
was sufficient to produce all the stars in
all the galaxies and all the atoms in our
own bodies. It is rather interesting that
the same forces that are responsible for
the creation of the world (matter/anti¬
matter asymmetry) are driving it to its
extinction (proton decay and thus mat¬
ter instability). That is the fate of our
Universe self-destruction .
Eventually the Universe left the GUT
transition phase and began to expand
and cool down at a slower, more con¬
ventional rate.
At this stage the particle physicists
step aside, leaving it to the astro¬
physicists to tell the story of how heavy
elements, stars, planets and galaxies
are made. Nevertheless, in journeying
further and further back towards the
Big Bang and probing more deeply into
the world of the infinitesimally small,
particle physicists are offering
astrophysicists a basis for a logical,
coherent explanation of the structure
of the Universe. Never before in the
history of physics has the symbiosis
between the infinitesimally small (the
microcosmos) and the infinitely big
(the macrocosmos) been happier or
more fruitful.

Explanations of varying degrees of com¬

Many of them see the origin of the
universe as a process Involving the bring¬

others refer to the spontaneous hatching
of the "cosmic egg". Above, three Tan-

Was there really
a
BIG BANG?

WHAT do we know about the
origin of the Universe? If
today an opinion poll were
to be conducted on this question, a
great majority of astronomers would
agree with the view that the Universe
came into existence in a gigantic explo¬
sion that took place some 10 to 15 thou¬
sand million years ago.
This conventional view, commonly
known as the "Big Bang" theory, has
it that at the moment of origin the
Universe was infinitely dense and in¬

directions, it cooled and became less
dense. Soon after the Big Bang, there
formed from its debris the basic
building blocks of matter which later
developed into large astronomical units
that we recognize today as stars, galax¬
ies, clusters of galaxies and so on.
Although the Universe is still
expanding as a result of that initial Big
Bang and all the galaxies are moving
away from one another, the ferocity of
the initial explosion is no longer present
now, nor is the universe very hot or
very dense. Its overall temperature is
estimated at about 270 degrees Celsius
(Centigrade) below zero, while an
average cubic volume of a million
kilometre size is believed to contain no
more than about one kilogram of visi¬
ble matter.
Cosmology is the branch of science
concerned with the study of the large
scale structure of the Universe, its
origin and its evolution. Like other
parts of astronomy (and of science in
general) cosmology has its share of
controversies and, if history is any
guide, the majority view has not always
prevailed. For, in the last analysis
speculations, however popular, have to
give way before hard facts.
The Big Bang scenario described
above has grown over the years out of
a series of plausible speculations based
on a comparatively few hard facts. But
do we have the guarantee that in this
scenario we have at last found the
answer to the ultimate question that
man has been attempting to grapple
with since time immemorial? Have we
reached the level of sophistication
needed to understand the origin of the
Universe?
Opinions differ amongst scientists
on this question. There are those who
feel that with the unification of all the
basic forces of nature in sight, the "end
of physics" is not too far away. For
them the cosmological problem is also
near its solution. I share the more
pessimistic (and more realistic?) assess¬
ment of English astronomer Sir Fred
Hoyle who said in 1970:
"I think it is very unlikely that a
creature evolving on this planet, the
human being, is likely to possess a
brain that is fully capable of under¬
standing physics in its totality. I think
this is inherently improbable in the first
place, but, even if it should be so, it is
surely wildly improbable that this
situation should just have been reached
in the year 1970".
With these reservations in mind one
can ask if the presently popular Big
Bang scenario is the only plausible one
for the origin and evolution of the
Universe.
The discovery that the Universe is ex¬
panding was made by the American
astronomer Edwin Hubble (1889-1953)
in 1929. Hubble's original observations
have since been repeated with greater
accuracy and out to greater distances,
and these have confirmed the view that
the space in which the galaxies are
embedded is expanding. The rate of ex¬
pansion of the Universe at any given
epoch is measured by a constant H,
commonly known as Hubble's
constant.
Given the fact that the Universe is
presently expanding we need a dynamic
theory to tell us what it did in the past
and what it will do in the future. Ein¬
stein's General Theory of Relativity is
the simplest and most suitable theory
available today for this purpose.
Models of the Universe based on this
theory lead us to the concept of the Big
Bang origin. According to these models
the density of the Universe and the
Hubble rate of expansion would be
found to be higher and higher as we
probe the history of the Universe fur¬
ther back in time, so much so that at an
epoch a finite time ago both these
quantities were infinite. This is the Big
Bang epoch.

Age of the Big Bang Universe - minimum 6.6
Age of the Big Bang Universe - maximum 13.3
Age of the Earth 4.6
Ages of Galaxies 15
Ages of Globular Clusters 18 Ages expressed in 1,000 millions of years
Because of the present uncertainties in
the value ofHubble 's constant, the age of
the Big Bang universe Is believed to lie
between 6,600 million and 13,300 million
years. This age range can accommodate
the age of the earth but not of the older
galaxies or globular clusters.
Physicists normally become sus¬
picious of the validity of their
theoretical framework if it leads them
to infinities like this. Einstein's theory
makes the situation even worse because
it links the density and the motion of
matter with the geometrical properties
of space and time. At the Big Bang
epoch, therefore, it is impossible to
define these properties. This total
breakdown of physical and mathe¬
matical descriptions has led to the Big
Bang epoch being called a "singular"
epoch.
The appearance of this singularity is
more a reflection on the in¬
completeness of our understanding
than a description of physical reality.
The singular epoch is identified with
the origin of the Universe. The law of
conservation of matter and energy
breaks down at this epoch since all the
matter (and radiation) present in the
Universe would have to be created at
this time.
Cosmologists define the age of the
Universe as the time elapsed since this
epoch and this has been worked out by
using the reciprocal of Hubble's con¬
stant (in other words by "working the
sums out backwards") to calculate how
long it would take for the Universe as it
is now to contract back to the time of
the Big Bang.
Although astronomical observations
today cannot give the value of
Hubble's constant accurately, the
model universe currently most
favoured by cosmologists and particle
physicists working together gives an
upper limit for the time elapsed since
the Big Bang of between twenty thou¬
sand million and ten thousand million
years.
These calculations are based on an
idealized model of an empty universe.
The presence of matter, however, tends
to slow down the expansion of the
model universe and to reduce its age. If
there is enough matter in the real
Universe to slow down its expansion to
a momentary standstill followed by
contraction (as the most widely ac¬
cepted version of the Big Bang theory
predicts), then its present age cannot be
more than two-thirds of the theoretical
calculation of the time elapsed since the
Big Bang. In other words, the age of the
Universe must be somewhere within the
range of 13.3 to 6.6 thousand million
years.
Large though this age is by human
standards, it is not so large in the
astronomical context. The age of the
Earth is 4.6 thousand million years.
The age of our Milky Way Galaxy is
variously estimated at 10 to 15 thou¬
sand million years. The ages of certain
large clusters of stars, called the
globular clusters, are even higher, at 17
to 18 thousand million years. It
therefore seems that if all matter were
created in the Big Bang it is simply im¬
possible to accommodate most of these
astronomical systems within the time
span available.
It is clear that these problems arise
because of the so called "origin" of the
Universe. Are there models of the
Universe without an origin, models in
which the Universe is infinitely old?
For such models one has to go beyond
the more conservative framework of
Einstein's general relativity.
In 1948 Hermann Bondi, Thomas
Gold and Fred Hoyle proposed a new
model of this kind. Known as the
"Steady State" model, it described a
universe which is ever-expanding,
without a beginning and without an
end. As its name implies, the density of
matter in this model is held at a steady
value. How can a system expand and
yet retain the same density? This result
is achieved in the Steady State model by
the injection of new matter continuous-

ly. It is possible to give a mathematical
formulation of the creation process
without violating the law of conserva¬
tion of matter and energy.
Despite its many attractive features
the Steady State model came under a
cloud in 1965 with the discovery of a
radiation background in microwaves,
by Arno Penzias and Robert Wilson.
The challenge to the model posed by
this observation does not appear so for¬
midable today as it did in the late 1 960s,
however. In fact, as I propose to show
below, the interpretation of this radia¬
tion as the relic of the Big Bang has
come up with some unexpected
difficulties.
The Penzias-Wilson discovery of
microwave radiation was hailed as the
strongest proof that the Universe has
come out of a hot Big Bang. The
reasons for this belief were: (i) the
observed radiation is extremely
smoothly distributed and hence does
not show any patchiness which would
be expected had it come from a large
number of isolated sources; (ii) the
radiation appeared to have a spectrum
very similar to that of the idealized
black body. [A black body is an
enclosure containing objects which
emit and absorb radiation continually,
with no radiation escaping from the
enclosure or entering it from outside.
Theory tells us that such a system set¬
tles down to a definite pattern with
prescribed intensity of radiation at
prescribed wavelengths.]
Both these features were expected
from the Big Bang models of the
universe. The radiation therefore came
to be recognized as the relic of the early
hot era in the history of the Universe.
There are, however, some difficulties
with this interpretation.
One difficulty is that the observed
spectrum is not exactly that expected
from a black body. There are small
departures from the black body spec¬
trum which cannot be ignored. This
result was pointed out by D.P. Woody
and P.L. Richards in 1980, and has re¬
mained an awkward point for the Big
Bang model ever since.
The second difficulty lies in the ex¬
traordinary smoothness of the back¬
ground itself, and it shows up in two
ways. The first problem is concerned
with smoothness on a small scale. If, as
is advocated, the radiation is the relic
of an early hot phase, then it should
show some imprint of the changes that
the Universe went through after that
phase. As we mentioned right in the
beginning, an important change that
took place in the composition of the
universe was the formation of galaxies.
Thus the matter distribution developed
dumpiness and some of it should have
been reflected in the background radia¬
tion. That no such dumpiness is seen
after repeated searches is a worrying
matter for Big Bang cosmologists.
The second way in which smoothness
poses a problem is known as the
horizon effect. When we survey the
universe out to large distances we see it
as it was in the past: because light, by
which we see distant objects, travels
with a finite velocity. Thus if the
universe is ten thousand million years
old, we can see objects out to distances
of ten thousand million light years (1
light year is the distance travelled by
light in one year). However, the radia¬
tion background formed when the
universe was hardly 300,000 years old.
At that time regions separated by more
than 300,000 light years would not have
been in contact with one another since
their fastest means of communication,
(the light ray) would not have been able
to bridge the gap between them. The
present large scale smoothness of the
radiation background on the other
hand implies that such remotely
separated regions were very similar in
structure and behaviour. Without
physical contact how was this similarity
achieved?
While the Big Bang cosmologists
engage in theoretical speculations
about the early history of the Universe
to figure out these mysterious proper¬
ties of the microwave background, I
cannot help feeling that the solution
may lie in an entirely different direction
and that the microwave background
may not, after all, be of relic nature.
The Universe is indeed full of radia¬
tion backgrounds at all wavelengths,
ranging from radio waves right up to
X-rays and gamma rays. With the ex¬
ception of the microwave background,
all are known to be of relatively recent
origin, with no possible connexion with
the hot post-Big Bang era. Why single
out the microwaves?
Fred Hoyle, Chandra Wickrama-
singhe, V.C. Reddish, and others (in¬
cluding this author) had argued in the
late 1960s and the early 1970s that the
microwave radiation could be a recycl¬
ed form of other radiation mainly com¬
ing from stars. Dust grains in the in-
tergalactic space, if present in very
modest proportions, would be able to
do the recycling. N.C. Rana has recent¬
ly worked out the details of how such a
process would operate. Indeed, if a
plausible explanation of the microwave
background can be found along these
lines, the case for a Big Bang
cosmology is considerably weakened
and the Steady State theory can be
revived.
This is one of the possible unconven¬
tional alternatives to the Big Bang
scenario, and I mention it here to em¬
phasize the fact that the cosmological
problem is far from being settled yet.
Just as better telescopes early in this
century expanded man's view and con¬
ception of the Universe in an unex¬
pected direction, so I hope, the observ¬
ing techniques of future years will fur¬
ther widen the cosmologist's vista
dramatically.

Red shift and the Doppler effect
Like Monsieur Jourdain, the hero of
Molière's Le Bourgeois Gentilhomme, to
whom it came as a considerable shock to
learn that he had been speaking prose all
his life, anyone who has stood on a
railway station platform as an express
train thunders past with whistle blowing,
may be surprised to learn that he or she
is quite familiar with the "Doppler ef¬
fect", one of the keys to modern
cosmology.
When a train driver blows his whistle
as he approaches a station, he hears a
steady sound at a fixed pitch. To the man
standing on the platform, however, the
sound of the whistle rises in pitch as the
train approaches and drops again as the
train speeds away into the distance. This
is because sound is a succession of
waves in the air. As a source of sound ap¬
proaches, the waves are compressed
and the pitch rises, as it recedes, the
waves are stretched out and the pitch
falls.
The Doppler effect is named after the
19th-century Austrian physicist Chris¬
tian Doppler who pointed out that the ef¬
fect applies also to light waves. When
light from a moving source reaches the
eye, there is a shift in frequencythat is,
colourwhen the source is moving fast
enough. If the source is moving towards
us, the light waves are compressed and
the light perceived shifts towards the
high-frequency, blue end of the spectrum
(blue shift); if the source is moving away,
the light waves are stretched and the
light shifts towards the low-frequency,
red end of the spectrum (red shift).
The importance of red shift became
evident early this century with the ap¬
plication of spectroscopy to astronomy.
Astronomers began studying the spectra
of nebulae. Some, such as the spiral
nebula Andromeda, showed blue shifts
in their spectra, indicating that, in accor¬
dance with the Doppler effect, they must
be moving towards us. Others showed
red shifts and were therefore receding
from us.
The recession of the galaxies can be com¬
pared to the way markings on a balloon
recede from each other as the balloon Is
Inflated. Illustration shows successive
doublings of the size of a "balloon
Universe". The points (galaxies) on the
balloon recede from each otherat a speed
proportional to their distance apart.
Hubble's Law
Edwin Hubble (1889-1953).
16
The application of spectroscopy to
astronomy coincided with the building of
a succession of giant telescopes at
Mount Wilson, in California and the ar¬
rival on the scene of the American
astronomer Edwin Hubble (1889 to
1953). Working at the Mount Wilson
Observatory, he showed that many
nebulae were, in fact, galaxies in their
own right, developed a classification for
galaxies that is still used today (see
diagram opposite page), and set about
measuring the distance to several of the
nearest galaxies.
Hubble soon noticed that galaxies are
distributed more or less evenly across the
sky and that all galaxies except our
nearest neighbours show a red shift in
their spectra. In 1 929 he announced that
his findings showed that the velocity of
recession indicated by the red shift Is pro¬
portional to the distance of a galaxy from
us. This became known as Hubble's
Law the direct proof that the universe is
expanding.
Since 1929, improved measurement
of distances to nearby galaxies has given
a more accurate value to the speed of
recession as related to distance the
Hubble Constant, as it is known. It is
estimated as between 50 and 100
kilometres per second per megaparsec
(3V4 million light-years). In other words,
for every 75 kilometres of measured
recession velocity, a galaxy is about
three and a quarter million light years
away from us. Hubble's Constant tells us
how quickly the universe is expanding,
and this in turn enables us to calculate
how long ago the Big Bang occurred. The
age of the universe, on this basis, is bet¬
ween 15,000 million and 20,000 million
years.

Galaxies and Quasars

ACCORDING to Greek legend,
the pearly band of the Milky
Way stretching across the sky
is milk spilt from the breast of the god¬
dess Juno. Since Galileo first in¬
vestigated the Milky Way by telescope,
we have known it is in fact composed of
stars. It is our own "star island", and
the Sun is just one of the 100,000
million stars making the Milky Way
Galaxyoften known simply as the
Galaxy.
Beyond the Galaxy, thousands of
millions of other galaxies stretch out to
the limits of the observable Universe.
Decades of detailed study have shown
that there is a fundamental simplicity
to galaxies. They fall into three main
types: spirals,, irregulars, and ellip¬
ticals. The recent techniques of radio,
NIGEL HENBEST is a British freelance
science writer and astronomy consultant to
the magazine New Scientist. Before becoming
a full-time science writer he was a radio
astronomer at the Cavendish Laboratory,
Cambridge University. He is the author of a
number of books; the latest, The New
Astronomy, (1983) was written in co-
authorship with Michael Marten.
The Whirlpool Galaxy (M51).
X-ray and infra-red astronomy have
shown that some galaxies are much
more violent than typical specimens
like the Milky Way Galaxy; but it is
worth remembering that although the
violent galaxies may grab the
headlines, they are very much in the
minority.
Our Galaxy is typical of a spiral
galaxy. These are named for the
beautiful two-armed spiral shape
visible on photographs but it is an ap¬
pearance that is misleading. The bright
spiral arms are just one region of the
whole galaxy. For a start, there is good
evidence that most of a galaxy's matter
is not in the form of the stars, gas and
that we can detect, but consists of
some invisible material filling a large
volume of space within and surround¬
ing the galaxy. This dark matter makes
its presence felt only by its gravitational
influence.
The oldest stars of a spiral galaxy fill
a large spherical volume of space
around the galaxy, and become in¬
creasingly concentrated towards its
centre. The outer regions of this halo of
stars are difficult to detect, but the
inner parts show as an orange bulge at
the centre of the spiral.
The spiral arms are the most promi¬
nent regions of a thin disc of stars,
which stretches away from the central
bulge like the broad rim of a hat. As
well as stars, the galaxy's disc contains
gas spread tenuously between the stars,
mixed up with small solid particles of
interstellar dust. The gas and dust
amount to about ten per cent of the
mass of stars in the disc, and much of
it is clumped into dense molecular
clouds where stars are currently being
born.
In many galaxies, the spiral shape is
a gravitational pattern. As a com-
The American astronomer Edwin Hubble
proposed the system ofclassifying galax¬
ies that is now generally In use. He divid¬
ed galaxies Into ellipticals, spirals, barred
spirals and Irregulars. Elliptical galaxies
are oval shaped and can be up to three
times the size of our own galaxy. Spirals,
such as our own galaxy, have arms which
swing out In a semi-circle from a nucleus.
Barred spirals have a bar-shaped nucleus
with two arms curving out from the end of
the bar. Irregular galaxies, which are not
shown In the diagram, are usually
somewhat smaller groupings of stars
with no particular shape.

galaxy passes by, it stirs up a
ripple in the disc of stars, and this
propagates around the disc in a
spiral-shaped "density-wave".
Where the spiral is less well marked,
it may be due to a chain of exploding
stars compressing nearby interstellar
gas. Either way, the spiral marks a
region where matter is more concen¬
trated and where a lot of bright,
energetic stars are now being born.
The Milky Way's companion, the
Andromeda Galaxy, is one of the most
massive spirals known, weighing as
much as 400,000 million Suns (ex¬
cluding the dark matter). The range of
spiral galaxies goes down to about
1,000 million solar masses. Less
massive galaxies are not able to main¬
tain a regular disc and stable spiral
arms. They have roughly the same pro¬
portions of stars, gas and dust, but
their unkempt appearance has led to
the classification "irregular galaxies".
The smallest irregular galaxies are
hardly larger than the clumps of stars
and gas found strung along the arms of
a spiral galaxy.
The third major category of galaxy is
the ellipticals. These are simply balls of
stars, spherical or elliptical in shape.
Although they may be surrounded by
dark matter, they contain only a
negligible amount of gas and dust. As
a result, there are no regions where
stars are forming, and no young stars.
The elliptical galaxy's stars all date
from the time when the galaxy first
formed. Ellipticals range from the big¬
gest and most massive galaxies of all,
with a million million stars, to the
faintest star assemblages which contain
less than a million stars.
Galaxies are rather gregarious
creatures. Most live in groups, where
they are gravitationally bound to
neighbour galaxies, and will stay
together as the expansion of the
Universe carries other groups of galax¬
ies away from them.
The Milky Way lies in a group of
about twenty galaxies, called the Local
Group. Other members include the An¬
dromeda Galaxy, a giant spiral; the
Small Magellanic Cloud, an irregular;
the Large Magellanic Cloud, which is
on the borders between spiral and ir¬
regular galaxies; and many small ir¬
regulars and ellipticals.
The Local Group is typical of many
groups and larger clusters of galaxies,
in containing a diversity of types. But
large clusters with a dense concentra¬
tion of galaxies towards the centre tend
to be different. Their galaxies are
distributed in a more regular swarm,
and X-ray telescopes show that they
often contain a pool of very hot gases
around the cluster's centre. The galax¬
ies in these clusters are almost entirely
ellipticals, or the strange creatures call¬
ed lenticulars. The latter are lens-
shaped galaxies, consisting only of
stars, and they are probably spiral
galaxies that have been stripped of their
interstellar gas and dust as they have
ploughed into the cluster's pool of hot
gas. The dense packing of galaxies in
these rich clusters means that galaxy
collisions must be commonplace, and
indeed the cluster's centre is often
marked by a massive elliptical galaxy
which is probably the accumulated re¬
mains of galaxies that have collided at
the centre of the cluster.
Optical astronomers see a galaxy by
the light from its stars. This gives a
good measure of the galaxy mass (ex¬
cept for the dark matter) because the
matter resides largely in the stars. The-
starlight can blind astronomers to
other kinds of activity in a galaxy,
however, and the development of
radio, X-ray and infra-red astronomy
has led astronomers to galaxies which
are producing immense quantities of
these radiations. Although these galax¬
ies are in a minority, they are providing
new information on galaxies' work¬
ings, just as a study of diseases can tell
us more about the healthy human
body. And they have a fascination of

THE STELLAR
MENAGERIE
Stars come in a bewildering variety. Some are thousands of
times brighter than the Sun, others shining feebly with only
a millionth the Sun's output of light. The largest stars, the
red giants, are several hundred times larger than the Sun. At
the other end of the scale, the smaller stars fall into families
that are increasingly bizarre. White dwarfs are only one-
hundredth the size of the Sun, neutron stars are smaller still,
and black holes are so condensed that the star itself is in¬
visible, and only its gravitational field betrays its presence.
Underlying this diversity, however, there is a very simple
pattern. It is a matter only of a star's mass and of its age.
Heavier stars produce more energy, and so are generally
brighter and hotter than less-massive stars. The differences
in size are due to ageing. The Sun, for example, will swell in¬
to a red giant, and then collapse to become a white dwarf.
As we look around the sky we observe stars of all ages, and
hence representing the whole gamut of possible stellar types.

THE LIFE AND
Starbirth
Stars are born out of interstellar gas, the tenuous
mixture of hydrogen, helium and smaller amounts
of other elements that lies between the existing stars
of a galaxy. In its natural state, this gas is too
rarefied to form into the dense gas globes of stars.
But the interstellar medium is disturbed by various
kinds of shock waves that compress the gas into
denser clouds, and it is here that starbirth occurs.
Astronomers believe that two main kinds of
shocks are responsible. The spiral pattern of a
galaxy like our Milky Way is a gravitational pattern
that rotates at different speed from the galaxy's
gas, so it is constantly piling up gas in new locations
as the spiral pattern rotates. In addition, the fast-
moving gases from an exploding star, a supernova,
can sweep up the tenuous gas and compress it into
dense clouds. Because of the clouds' large comple¬
ment of molecules, such as carbon monoxide and
alcohol, astronomers call them "molecular
clouds".
In the centre of a molecular cloud, the gas is so
dense that its own gravity pulls it inwards. This gas
is turbulent, so it does not all shrink towards the
same central point, but breaks up into dozens of in¬
dividual fragments of the cloud. Each fragment
then shrinks independently, and eventually
becomes a star.
These events are hidden from optical
astronomers, because the clouds are thick with par¬
ticles of interstellar dust that block off light. But
now radio telescopes can pick up radiation from
molecules in the cloud, and infra-red instruments,
like the Infra-red Astronomical Satellite, IRAS,
can detect heat from the protostars. They have
shown that each condensing fragment becomes flat¬
tened as a result of its own rotation, and blows off
gases at high speeds from either side of this flat
disc. These gas flows may trigger the birth of more
stars in the vicinity.
The newly-born cluster of several dozen stars is
generating radiation and gas flows that eventually
disperse the molecular cloud around them. This
takes one or two million years a short time in the
astronomer's reckoning. Sometimes the stars are so
close that they remain gravitationally bound
together as a star cluster, but more often they drift
apart. About one-third of all stars end up single,
like the Sun; the other two-thirds take along a close
companion from the original cluster and end up as
double stars.

(1) A star's life begins
when it condenses
out of dust and gas
scattered in space. (2)
As gravity begins to
act, the embryo star
starts to shrink. (3) As
it shrinks, the
temperature near the
middle rises until It
becomes high enough
for fusion to take
place. (4) The body
has now become a
real star, radiating
huge amounts of
energy.
Main sequence
The compression within a protostar
heats up its interior to some 10 million
degrees, and at this point nuclear re¬
actions begin to convert its hydrogen gas
into helium. The reaction releases
energy, which seeps up through the star
and shines out from the surface. The
energy source also opposes the in-pull of
gravity, so the gas globe stops shrinking
and remains constant.
The balance between energy produc¬
tion and gravity is so stable that the star
remains very much the same for millions
of years, or more. This period of
"hydrogen-burning" is in fact the
longest phase of a star's life. Tradition¬
ally, astronomers call stars in this phase
"main sequence stars", because their
properties follow a well-defined pattern.
All main sequence stars of the same
mass have a very similar luminosity and
surface temperature (the latter dictating
their apparent colours). The more
massive a main sequence star, the
brighter and hotter it is; the less massive
it is, the dimmer and cooler. The Sun and
Sirius are both typical main sequence
stars, for example, but because Sirius is
twice as heavy as the Sun, it is 20 times
brighter and has a surface temperature of
10,000°Centigrade as compared to the
Sun's 5,500°Centigrade surface.
Eventually a main sequence star will
consume all the hydrogen in its central
region where temperatures are high
enough for nuclear reactions to occur. A
star like the Sun reaches this point after
some 10,000 million yearsfortunately
for us, a long way in the future, as the
Sun is currently 5,000 million years old.
The highly-luminous massive stars are
ripping through their central fuel supplies
much more quickly, and reach the end of
their main sequence phase after only a
few million years.
Red giants
Once a star's core is bereft of
hydrogen, and is composed of helium
created by the reactions, it contracts
under its own gravity. Hydrogen im¬
mediately around the core then begins
to "burn" to helium, in a thin shell. To
compensate for the collapse of its core,
the outer layers swell out, to about a
hundred times its previous size. The
radiation from its interior now has to
spread out over more surface gases,
and so cannot heat it as much. The
temperature falls to only about

DEATH OF A STAR
White dwarfs
3,000° Centigrade, and the colour of
the star changes from the white or
yellow of a star like Sirius or the Sun to
a dull red. The swollen, reddish star is
now a red giant.
The outer gases of a red giant are
held so tenuously that they wobble in
and out, causing the star's brightness to
go up and down over a period of about
a year. The more massive stars expand
to become even larger, and are termed
supergiants. In some, the outer layers
oscillate in and out with a very precise
period, whose length is related to the
star's mass and hence to its brightness.
These Cepheid variable stars are im¬
mensely useful to astronomers measur¬
ing distances in the Universe.
After its red giant phase the final fate
of a star depends on its mass. If it is
similar to the Sun, the star sheds the
tenuous outer layers of its red giant
body. This gas spreads into space as a
glowing ring, known to astronomers as
a planetary nebula. (The name has
nothing directly to do with planets, in¬
cidentally; the rings simply look rather
like Uranus or Neptune when seen
through a small telescope.)
The star's core is left as a very com¬
pact little object, a white dwarf star. It
contains almost as much mass as the
Sun, but packed into a sphere only the
size of the Earth. The white dwarf is
made up of matter in an unusual state.
Like other stars, it consists of atomic
nuclei and electrons the components
of atoms broken apart in the heat of a
star's interior. While other stars are
gaseous, with pressure provided by the
fast speed of these constituents, a white
dwarf is effectively solid, because its
matter is so compressed that the elec¬
trons are packed together as tightly as
they will go. This is an example of what
physicists call "degenerate matter".
A white dwarf has no source of
energy, no interior nuclear reactions. It
begins life extremely hot, with the
residual heat from its days as a star's
core. But as time goes by, it radiates its
heat away to space, and eventually ends
up cold, dark and forgotten as a "black
dwarf".

Supernovae, neutron stars, pulsars
A heavy star goes out with a bang. At
the end of its phase as a red giant (or a
Cepheid variable), the nuclear reac¬
tions near its centre become unstable,
and the star blows itself apart, as a
supernova. In this colossal explosion,
the supernova briefly shines as brightly
as a thousand million Suns.
As the outer layers of gas blow
themselves off, the core is powerfully
squeezed, and it collapses until it is only
about 20 kilometres across only the
size of a large city. During the collapse,
its electrons combine with protons to
make neutrons, and the collapse halts
when the neutrons are packed
together another example of
degenerate matter, but this time involv¬
ing neutrons rather than the electrons
found in white dwarfs. A typical
neutron star weighs a little more than
the Sun, and its small size means that
its density is incredible: a pinhead of
neutron star matter would weigh a
million tonnes.
As neutron stars rotate, they give out
radiation that appears to "flash".
Radio astronomers at Cambridge first
picked up these pulses of radiation in
1967, and called their sources
Magnetic

"pulsars". Pulsars, or neutron stars,
often give out flashes of X-rays and
gamma rays, too, and in a few cases,
flashes of light. These pulses show that
the small stars rotate unbelievably
quickly. The pulsar in the Crab
Nebula, the remains of a supernova
that exploded 900 years ago, turns 30
times per second; while a pulsar
discovered in 1982 rotates an incredible
642 times every second!

LIGHTHOUSES IN THE SKY. As neutron
stars rotate, they emit beams of radiation
which we perceive as flashes as the
beams flick past us at regular Intervals,
just as a sailor sees the flashing beam of
a distant lighthouse.
Black holes
The centre of a very massive star cannot
end up as a white dwarf or a neutron star.
There is a natural weight limit for these
shrunken entities, of 1 .4 and 3 times the
Sun's mass, respectively. When an ex¬
tremely heavy star explodes, its collaps¬
ing core may be above these limits. As it
shrinks in size, nothing can stop the col¬
lapse; and as it gets smaller, the strength
of gravity at its surface increases con¬
tinuously. When the core is only a few
kilometres across, its gravity becomes so
strong that nothing not even light can
escape. It has become a black hole.
The black hole is thus a region of ir¬
resistible gravity just a few kilometres
across. It is a hole, because anything
dropped into it can never get out again;
and it is black because no light can
escape from within. The original core has
collapsed to a very small size somewhere
near the centre of the hole, but there is
3
E
22
literally no way of finding out what has
happened to it, because no radiation
from it can get out through the sur¬
rounding black hole.
Although theory tells astronomers that
black holes should exist, finding a black
hole in the darkness of space is rather
worse than locating a black cat in the
coal cellar on a dark nightl The only
giveaway is its gravity. Since two-thirds
of the stars are paired up with a compa¬
nion, there should be many black holes
teamed up with normal stars in orbit
about them. The normal star could be
sufficiently far away that it is not
swallowed up by the black hole, but still
near enough for the black hole to pull off
some of its surface gases. These gases
flow down towards the black hole,
heating up in the processes and emitting
X-rays before they disappear into the
hole.

X-ray astronomers have indeed found
radiation sources in the sky where a visi¬
ble star is orbiting an invisible compa¬
nion. In many cases, the X-rays are com¬
ing in pulses, showing that the small un¬
seen star is in fact a neutron star. But
when they investigated a source called
Cygnus X-1, astronomers found that the
unseen companion star is at least six
times heavier than the Sunfar too
massive to be a neutron star. More
recently, two similar cases have come to
light in our nearest neighbour galaxy, the
Large Magellanic Cloud. Although the
evidence must necessarily be indirect,
the existence of black holes among the
stars of our Galaxy and others is now
proven to the satisfaction of most
astronomers. I

The scale
of space
For the relatively short distances within
the Solar System, astronomers can use
the kilometre as a unit. But even the
distance from the Earth to the Sun. 150
million km, is becoming a little too large
to work with. Solar system astronomers
often take this distance as their unit and
call it "one astronomical unit". In this
way, the distance to Pluto, the outer¬
most planet, becomes a convenient 39
astronomical units.
Another measure of an astronomical
distance is given by the time taken for
light to traverse it. The Earth-Sun
distance is 8 1/3 light-minutes; the
diameter of Pluto's orbit is 1 1 light-
hours. The latter dimension, while
minuscule on the scale of the Galaxy, is
similar to the size of the compact
powerhouse within a quasar.
The nearest star, Próxima Centauri,
lies 7,000 times further off than Pluto, at
4.2 light-years. The brightest stars in the
sky lie at a variety of distances, Sirius at
8.6 light-years, for example, and Arc-
turus at 36; Deneb (in Cygnus) is among
the most distant of the "first magnitude"
stars, at 1 ,500 light-years away. But this
is just on our doorstep in the whole
Galaxy: it is 30,000 light-years from the
Sun to the Galaxy's centre; and the Milky
Way is some 1 00,000 light-years in
diameter.
Irregular galaxies are considerably
smaller than the Milky Way, and most
spirals are slightly smaller. Our
neighbour, the Andromeda Galaxy, is
one of the largest spirals known, with a
diameter of 150,000 light-years. The
largest ellipticals are bigger still, with
diameters of up to a million light-years.
These sizes refer to the extent of a
galaxy's stars. The beams ejected from a
radio galaxy can stretch much further
out, to make these objects the largest
connected structures in the Universe.
The nearest galaxy to the Milky Way is
the Large Magellanic Cloud, at 1 70,000
light-years. Our Local Group of galaxies
is five million light-years across. The
nearest large cluster of galaxies, the
Virgo cluster, is about 50 million light-
years away. Typical large clusters of
galaxies are about 30 million light-years
across. They are often grouped into
superclusters. These assemblies of
clusters are typically 200 million light-
years in extent, and they often form the
denser parts of filamentary structures
that stretch over 500 million light-years
or more. The clusters of galaxies are
gravitationally bound and will remain
roughly the same size; the superclusters
and filaments will grow with the expan¬
sion of the Universe.

their own, for some active galaxies, the
quasars, are the most powerful objects
in the Universe.
Astronomers now recognize two dif¬
ferent kinds of active galaxy. The
"starburst galaxies" are spiral or ir¬
regular galaxies where a large propor¬
tion of their interstellar matter is turn¬
ing into stars all at once. The light from
these new stars is hidden by dense dust
clouds around them, but their energy
eventually escapes from the clouds as
infra-red, "heat" radiation. Astro¬
nomers only vaguely suspected the
existence of starburst galaxies before
1983, when the first orbiting infra-red
telescope was flown on the Infra-red
Astronomical Satellite (IRAS). IRAS
discovered thousands of starburst
galaxies, some emitting a hundred
times as much heat as light, and the
analysis of the results is still under way.
The strongest active galaxies
however fall into the second class,
those with a central "powerhouse".
This is a small region of concentrated
power in a galaxy's centre, probably no
larger than the Solar System, and pro¬
ducing an amount of energy equivalent
to the output of up to a million million
Suns. The powerhouse can also send
energy out into space, in narrow
beams.
The largest of the elliptical galaxies
frequently have a powerhouse that
gives out little radiation itself (and so is
not easily detected by optical, radio or
X-ray telescopes), but puts its power
into two oppositely directed beams.
These probably consist of high-speed
electrons, like the beam from a tele¬
vision tube's electron gun. The beams
speed out into space on either side of
The great spiral galaxy in the Andromeda
constellation.
the galaxy, still giving little hint of the
energy in flow. But eventually they
strike the very tenuous gas that sur¬
rounds the galaxy, and they surrender
the energy. It goes into a random mix¬
ture of magnetic field and chaotic elec¬
trons that generates radio waves, by a
process called synchroton radiation. A
radio telescope thus "sees" not the
galaxy itself, but a pair of bright
clouds, one on either side of the galaxy.
The powerhouses in spiral galaxies
are not so coy. They generally produce
a lot of light, X-rays and radio waves
directly. The most common type, and
the best-studied, are Seyfert galaxies.
Carl Seyfert, working in America in
1943, first investigated spiral galaxies
with a tiny bright point of light at the
centre. As well as this inexplicable light
source, he found that the central
regions of the galaxies contain gases
moving at high speed.
The next step came twenty years
later, when astronomers found that
some radio sources coincided with
small points of light in the sky.
Although these looked like stars, the
red shift of their light showed they were
very distant objects, being carried away
by the expansion of the Universe. Their
conflicting properties led to the name
"quasi-stellar objects", later shortened
to quasars.
More recent research has shown that
quasars are simply more powerful ver¬
sions of the galaxy cores that Seyfert
had studied. With sensitive electronic
detectors, astronomers have found that
the brilliant powerhouses are in many
cases surrounded by a faint "fuzz"
that corresponds to the galaxy we
would expect to find there and the^

fuzz generally shows a spiral shape.
Both quasars and the centres of Seyfert
galaxies are constantly fluctuating in
brightness, so it's quite likely that they
are one and the same phenomenon,
caught at different levels of activity.
The powerhouse in a quasar is a truly
diabolic inferno. Some quasars change
their output of X-rays in only a couple
of hours, implying that the powerhouse
is just a few "light hours" across-
only the size of the Solar System. Yet in
the largest outburst yet seen from a
quasar, this tiny region was emitting
the power of over a thousand normal
galaxies!
Most astronomers believe there is
only one possible source for concen¬
trated power of this magnitude: the
powerful gravitational field around a
black hole. As gas spirals downwards
into a black hole, as much as 40 per
cent of its mass can be converted into
energy. A spiral galaxy would certainly
have enough gas to "feed" the black
hole of a quasar lurking in its centre.
There is more of a problem in ex¬
plaining the powerhouses in elliptical
galaxies that eject the electron beams,
because these galaxies are relatively
gas-free. But even here there is a solu¬
tion: the gravitational pull of the black
hole can rip stars apart as their orbits
bring them too close to the hole, and
the spilt gas from the disrupted star can
then spiral inwards.
Backing up this theory- are sensitive
measurements of two nearby active
galaxies. The elliptical galaxy M87 is a
radio galaxy, and a team of British and
American astronomers have discovered
that the stars near its centre move as if
they are constrained by the gravity of a
compact, invisible object some 5,000
million times heavier than the Sun.
Only a black hole could be this heavy
yet so small. And an international team
studying the motions of gas in the
Seyfert galaxy NGC 4151 have con¬
cluded that it is orbiting a black hole
about 500 million times the Sun's
weight.
An active galaxy's outbursts must
depend not only on the presence of a
central black hole, but also on gas cur¬
rently spiralling inwards. About 10 per
cent of large spiral galaxies are Seyfert
galaxies, and most astronomers believe
they are not continuously active. To
turn the statistics around, then, it is
possible that all spiral galaxies contain
a central black hole, but that they are
fuelled for only ten per cent of the time.
In that case, the distinction between a
normal galaxy and an active galaxy
becomes blurred. Perhaps ordinary
galaxies, like the Andromeda Galaxy
and even our Milky Way, contain a
dormant black hole, have suffered out¬
bursts from a central powerhouse in the
past and may possibly do so again.

THE most important feature of the
physical world around us the
Universe is its structure.
Rather than being scattered haphazard¬
ly, the matter that surrounds us is, to a
large degree, assembled in various for¬
mations or structures. Structures of
one type constitute the building blocks
from which are formed structures of a
second level that are considerably
larger in spatial dimension. These
second-level structures are in turn
assembled into third-level structures
and so on, but, as we shall see later, not
ad infinitum. In other words, there is a
hierarchy of structural levels.
If we confine ourselves to
astronomical scales, any enumeration
of these structures must necessarily
start with the Earth and the other
planets of the solar system whose cen¬
tre is the star we call the Sun. Hundreds
or thousands of millions of stars are
grouped in galaxies like our Galaxy, the
Milky Way, or the nebula in An¬
dromeda. This is the second astro¬
nomical structural level. Galaxies,
however, are unevenly distributed in
space and form huge clusters or
superclusters. It is these structures that
are of interest in cosmology the study
of the Universe itself.
For the non-expert in astronomy the
unit of distance of which he can most
easily form a mental picture is the light-
year the distance travelled by light in
one year. A light-year is approximately
equivalent to ten million million (1013)
kilometres. For comparison let us

recall that it takes light eight minutes to
reach the Earth from the Sun, but ap¬
proximately four years from Próxima
Centauri, the nearest star. Próxima is
therefore four light-years away.
The diameter of a typical galaxy may
be as little as ten thousand or as much
as one hundred thousand light-years,
and the distance from the Earth to the
nearest giant galaxy, Andromeda's
nebula, exceeds two million light-years.
Galaxies are grouped together in
clusters, and the diameters of the big
clusters of galaxies are of the order of
ten million light-years. Clusters
themselves group together in
superclusters that are between one
hundred million and three hundred
million ,;ght-years across.
Big clusters of galaxies, containing
thousands of galaxies and more, have
been known for a long time because
they stand out clearly in the sky. Figure
(1) overleaf, for instance, shows the
great cluster of galaxies in the direction
of (but far beyond) the constellation
Coma. But superclusters have only
been unambiguously identified as a
result of progress achieved in observa¬
tional astronomy in the past decade.
The structure of the superclusters
could not be determined as long as the
photographs studied in stellar atlases
showed only a projection of a galaxy's
position on the celestial sphere. If
galaxies seem to be alongside each
other in photographs, it does not
follow that they are actually near one
another. It is quite possible that such
galaxies are at different distances from
the Earth and that it is only by accident
that they lie almost along the same line
of sight as viewed from the Earth. The
true position of galaxies in space can be
ascertained only by constructing a
three-dimensional picture. To do this a
third co-ordinatethe distance to the
galaxymust be added to the two
angle co-ordinates which give the posi¬
tion of the galaxy on the celestial sphere
(these are analogous to geographical
latitude and longitude).
The distances to the distant galaxies
are found using Hubble's Law, which
tells us that the velocity at which a dis¬
tant galaxy is receding from us is pro¬
portional to its distance from us. The
coefficient of proportionality is called
Hubble's constant (see page 16). The
velocity of a galaxy can be determined
from the Doppler effect on the light
coming from that galaxy, that is to say
by measuring its "red shift" (see page
16).
Red shifts have now been measured
for more than ten thousand galaxies.
Using the distances to the galaxies thus
obtained, three-dimensional pictures
of the distribution of the galaxies in
space have been constructed with the
aid of computers. The results were
unexpected.
Why unexpected, and what distribu¬
tion of galaxies would we have ex¬
pected a priori? If all structural levels
of matter are qualitatively similar to
each other and differ only in spatial
dimensions, then something not unlike
the structure depicted in Figure (2),
where every dot represents a galaxy,
should have been obtained.
In other words, on the basis of our
previous knowledge it was quite
natural to suppose that galaxies are
grouped in clusters in exactly the same
way that stars are grouped in galaxies.
The existence of such clusters, as in
Coma (see Figure 1), would furnish an
additional argument in support of such
an hypothesis.
The reality, however, proved to be
quite different. An overwhelming pro¬
portion (80 to 90 per cent) of the galax¬
ies proved to be concentrated in greatly
extended, thread-like (filamentary)
patterns with a thickness of less than
thirty million light-years and a length
of up to three hundred million light-
years. Adjacent threads intersect each
other forming a combined, three-
dimensional structure like a network of
cells, or a honeycomb. This structure is
usually called a supercluster system, a
boundary being conventionally drawn
between separate superclusters where
the threads become finer and more
distinct. The large clusters of galaxies,
of the type depicted in Figure (1), con¬
tain an extremely small proportion (less
than ten per cent) of all the galaxies,
and as a rule they are situated near the
points of intersection of the filamen¬
tary structures.
A schematic, very simplified picture
of the distribution of the galaxies is
given in Figure (3). Superclusters oc¬
cupy a very small portion (about ten
per cent) of the volume of the Universe
as a whole. The remaining space con¬
tains hardly any galaxies. In a projec¬
tion of the visible celestial sphere these
huge voids disappear completely
because the superclusters lying behind
these voids are seen through the gaps.
The same thing happens with the
filamentary structures. Only the big
clusters, having a very marked concen¬
tration towards the centre, still stand
out (as in Figure 1). This is why it was
necessary to construct a three-
dimensional picture.
The structures as represented in
Figures (2) and (3) are clearly visible to
the eye and it is impossible to confuse
them. But how can they be distinguish¬
ed from each other mathematically and
quantitatively? The problem is rather
like one we encounter in everyday life.
We instantly recognize someone we
know in a photograph or on meeting
him, but how can we describe him in
words so that others can recognize
him? (It is even more difficult to teach
a computer to recognize someone from
his or her external appearance).

Figures (2) and (3) have been drawn
so that the average density of the galaxy
dots and the density contrast (defined
as that portion of the volume of space
in which most of the galaxies are. con¬
tained) are identical. We can easily tell
them apart. At the same time a strict
mathematical criterion is essential in
order to discern the structures because
the human eye is capable of seeing
structures where none exists. The story
of the "canals" on Mars, seen by
observers with poor telescopes only to
vanish from view when more powerful
instruments were used, is a good exam¬
ple (see opposite page).
Our Moscow team recently succeed¬
ed in establishing such a criterion.
Leaving aside the mathematical details,
this criterion can be explained as
follows. Suppose your problem is to
cross from one end of Figure (2) or
Figure (3) to the other, but the Figure
represents the whole of the infinite
Universe. You are entitled to touch on¬
ly upon those places where there are
galaxy dots. Moreover, your physical
possibilities are limited you cannot
make steps or leaps of more than a cer¬
tain length. The question is: what is the
maximum length of step you must be
capable of in order to perform the task
of completing a voyage through the
whole of the Universe?
The answer depends on the ratio of
this maximum length of step to the
average distance between the galaxy
dots, which we may call the critical
parameter.
If we look at Figures (2) and (3), we
see that when crossing the structure
shown in Figure (2), it is necessary to
take big leaps between the clusters (so a
maximum length of step of the order of
the distance between the clusters is
necessary) whereas it is possible to
cross the structure in Figure (3) in small
steps, and the maximum length of step
in this case does not exceed the distance
between the galaxies within the fila¬
ment. Consequently, the critical
parameter in the first case turns out to
be considerably greater than in the
second. For the purposes of com¬
parison we can consider a third case,
where the galaxy dots are disposed
quite haphazardly and independently
of each other. In this case the
parameter acquires an intermediate
value close to three.
So which structure does the real
Universe resemble? When we in¬
vestigate a real three-dimensional
distribution of galaxies we find that the
parameter is significantly less than
three and close to that obtained for the
filamentary structure in Figure (3).
This tells us, in rigorous mathematical
terms, that the honeycomb structure of
the superclusters that we perceive with
our own eyes is real.
Observations also prove that on a
scale of the order of a thousand million
light-years, which is twice as much as
the maximum scale of a supercluster,
the distribution of matter in the
Universe is, to a high degree of preci¬
sion, homogeneous (the same every¬
where), isotropic (it looks the same in
all directions) and unstructured. Devia¬
tions from the average density on this
scale do not exceed ten to twenty per
cent. On still larger scales the degree of
homogeneity and isotropicality is even
greater. Therefore, non-homogeneous
structures of a higher level than
superclusters do not exist. Super-
clusters are the biggest structures in the
universe, at the top of the hierarchy.
On bigger scales, the Universe is
uniform.
How can we explain this observed
structure? The general characteristics
of the Universe, such as its overall
homogeneity, isotropy and its expan¬
sion are vividly described by means of
the "hot Big Bang" model. To explain
the origin of the galaxies, their
assembly into clusters and super-
clusters, we must assume that at the
time of the Big Bang there were very
slight inhomogeneities (unevennesses
or "lumpiness") in the distribution of
matter. In recent years some very at¬
tractive and exciting theories have been
proposed to explain these initial in
homogeneities (see article page 8). But
here we shall consider only how those
inhomogeneities grew as the Universe
got older.
It is easy to investigate the evolution
of inhomogeneities (lumps in the
universe) as long as they are small. The
lumps grow because because gravity
pulls more matter onto them and,
although they start small, ultimately
they become more pronounced. As
they grow, the equations needed to
describe their behaviour become more
complex, but I have succeeded in show¬
ing that the first solid structures to ap¬
pear must have had the form of a flat
thin cake with sharp edges. Because of
this the theory became known as the
"pancake" theory of galaxy form¬
ation. In the course of time the pan¬
cakes grew until they intersected each
other. The density of the matter on the.
lines of intersection increases further as
gravity does its work and it is precisely
these lines that form the cellular net¬
work structure during further evolu¬
tion. Numerical calculations made on
computers in Moscow and by other
teams of experts give a picture of a
large-scale honeycomb structure on the
whole similar to the one observed,
although there is not yet complete
agreement on all the details.
Great advances are being made in
cosmology as a whole and in the theory
of the structure of the Universe.. Fur¬
ther work remains to be done but the
rate of progress is such that we can ex¬
pect real advances towards finding the
answers to these profound questions
within the lifespan of this generation.

The canals of Mars
The difficulties of making accurate
astronomical observations through the
earth's turbulent atmosphere are il¬
lustrated by the strange controversy
about "the canals of Mars". The Italian
astronomer Giovanni V. Schiaparelli
(1835-1910) observed in 1877 that
Mars had strange markings which he call¬
ed canali, a word which was wrongly
translated into English as canals instead
of channels. Schiaparelli 's ideas were
taken further by the American
astronomer Percival Lowell (1855-1916)
who claimed that the waterways were ir¬
rigation canals constructed by intelligent
beings. "A mind of no mean order would
seem to have presided over the system
we see," he wrote, "a mind certainly of
considerably more comprehensiveness
than that which presides over the various
departments of our own public works."
These theories inspired a host of science
fiction stories and were only laid to rest in
the mid-1970s when the US Viking
missions revealed Mars's dusty, crater-
pitted surface but not a sign of "canals".
Right, drawing of Mars and its canali

The origin
of the elements
AS the Universe began to cool after
the Big Bang in which it was
born, clouds of gas were able to
collapse under the pull of their own
gravity and form stars. But those first
stars did not contain the rich diversity of
chemical elements that we find on Earth
today. Only hydrogen and a little
helium about 20 per cent of the total
matterwere created in the Big Bang
itself; all of the other elements, including
the carbon in your body and the oxygen
in the air that you breathe, have been
manufactured inside stars and spread
across space by stellar explosions
supernovae.
A first generation star, containing only
hydrogen and some helium, would have
formed as a ball of gas, contracting under
the pull of gravity and getting hotter in
the middle, as gravitational energy was
converted into heat. Higher tempera¬
tures mean that the particles in the heart
of the young star move faster and collide
with one another more violently. At a few
thousand degrees, electrons are stripped
from their atoms, leaving a sea of pro¬
tons (hydrogen nuclei) constantly col¬
liding with one another. And at a tem¬
perature of about 10 million degrees K
two protons that collide with one another
stick together. Each of these protons
carries a positive charge, but when they
stick together the pair emit a positively
charged counterpart of the electron,
called a positron, and one of the protons
thereby becomes converted into a
neutron. The combination of one proton
and one neutron forms the nucleus of an
atom of heavy hydrogen, deuterium. And
when that deuterium nucleus collides
with another proton, it can stick to form
the nucleus of an atom of helium, a varie¬
ty called helium-3 containing two pro¬
tons and one neutron. Two of these
helium-3 nuclei in turn combine to form
one nucleus of helium-4, containing two
protons and two neutrons, with the
release of two protons hydrogen
nuclei which go back into the stellar
melting pot.
The net effect of this cycle of activity
is to convert four protons into one
helium-4 nucleus, and to release energy.
This is nuclear fusion, the basis of the
hydrogen bomb. A star like the Sun, in¬
deed, is the cosmic equivalent of a
hydrogen bomb, one which explodes
continuously for ten thousand million
years. The energy released keeps a star
hot In the middle and holds it up against
further collapse, for as long as the supply
of hydrogen fuel lasts. Ultimately, how¬
ever, the fuel must run out as all of the
hydrogen in the middle is converted into
helium. At that point, the star will begin
to collapse again, getting hotter still in its
heart, with pressure building up until
conditions are so extreme that the helium
nuclei themselves begin to combine,
with three nuclei of helium-4 getting
together to make one nucleus of carbon,
which contains six protons and six
neutrons. Once again, this process
releases energy (now at a still higher
temperature) and the collapse is
halted until almost all the helium has
been converted into carbon. Then, the
whole cycle repeats again, with suc¬
cessively heavier elements being built up
in the central regions of a massive star as
it gets older. This happens quickly for
massive stars, and any massive first
generation stars formed when the
Universe was young have all long since
burned out.
The heaviest element that can be made
in this way is iron, the most stable ele¬
ment of all. Whereas fusion of lighter
elements to make heavier elements
releases energy all the way up the ladder
toaron, to make the heavier elements it is
necessary to put energy in to force the
nuclei to combine with one another. This

only happens in very massive stars but
when it does happen, it happens in spec¬
tacular fashion.
When a very massive star has used up
all of its nuclear fuel, and has grown a
core of gaseous iron, nuclei pounding
against one another at a temperature of
tens of millions of degrees, there comes
a time when no more energy is being
released and it can no longer hold itself
up against gravity. This happens when
the iron core is about one and a half times
the entire mass of our Sun, for a star
whose total mass is ten or more times the
mass of our Sun. At this point, the iron
core collapses very suddenly to a
superdense state in which all of the pro¬
tons and electrons fuse together to make
neutrons. The equivalent of the entire
mass of our Sun is packed into a ball of
neutron matter no bigger than the island
of Manhattan. And this collapse releases
an enormous amount of gravitational
energy, which goes into the outer 90 per
cent of the star. In the early phase of the
resulting explosion, atomic nuclei are
forced together to create the heavy
elements, such as lead and uranium;
then, split-seconds later, the entire outer
part of the star is ripped away and scat¬
tered across space. Eventually, the
elements created inside the dying star
will become part of new gas clouds in
space, which will collapse to form stars
and planets, like our Solar System. Our
Sun is a later generation star, and that is
why it contains some elements other
than hydrogen and helium, and why it
has a retinue of planets made out of
heavier elements. We owe our life to the
death throes of stars.

This Infra-red ¡mage of the Milky Way as a
glowing iridescent wand Is a product of a
breakthrough which has enabled
astronomers to observe for the first time
a universe that had hitherto been invisi¬
ble and inaccessible to them. It was
transmitted in 1983 from an Infra-red
telescope mounted In the Infra-red
Astronomical Satellite (IRAS), a 12-month
project In which Dutch, US and British
astronomers took part. Infra-red waves,
which resemble light waves but cannot
be seen by the naked eye, pass through
the dense clouds of interstellar dust that
obscure the starlight whereby
astronomers using optical telescopes
observe the universe. Infra-red obser¬
vatories have been built on high moun-
talntops, but such earthbound observa¬
tions are difficult because most Infra-red
radiation is absorbed by water In the
earth's atmosphere. An infra-red obser¬
vatory in space was the answer to the
problem, and IRAS has provided a mass
of data about star formation which will
take years to analyse fully andseems like¬
ly to modify many accepted beliefs.
Below
The Pleiades are a dense cluster of stars
some 60 million years old, still In the pro¬
cess of formation. Six or seven can be
seen by the naked eye and the cluster is
commonly known as the Seven Sisters,
but photographs reveal that there are
several hundred stars in the group.
ALL my life I have wondered
about the possibility of life
elsewhere. What would it be
like? Of what would it be made? All
living things on our planet are
constructed of organic molecules
complex microscopic architectures in
which the carbon atom plays a central
role. There was once a time before life,
when the earth was barren and utterly
desolate. Our world is now overflowing
with life. How did it come about?.
How, in the absence of life, were
. carbon-based organic molecules made?
How did the first living things arise?
How did life evolve to produce beings
as elaborate and complex as we, able to
explore the mystery of our own
origins?
And on the countless other planets
that may circle other suns, is there life
also? Is extraterrestrial life, if it exists,
based on the same organic molecules as
life on Earth? Do the beings of other
worlds look much like life on Earth? Or
are they stunningly different other
adaptations to other environments?
In the great dark between the stars
there are clouds of gas and dust and
organic matter. Dozens of different
kinds of organic molecules have been
found out there by radio telescopes.
The abundance of these molecules sug¬
gests that the stuff of life is everywhere.
CARL SAGAN, of the USA, is director of the
Laboratory for Planetary Studies and David
Duncan Professor of Astronomy and Space
Sciences at Cornell University, Ithaca, New
York. A former chairman of the Division for
Planetary Sciences of the American
Astronomical Society, he played a leading role
in the Mariner, Viking and Voyager expedi¬
tions to the planets. He is the author, co¬
author or editor of more than a dozen books in¬
cluding Intelligent Life in the Universe, The
Cosmic Connection, The Dragons of Eden,
and Broca's Brain, and in 1978 he was award¬
ed the Pulitzer Prize for literature. This article
is extracted from Cosmos, a book based on
Professor Sagan's major television series
which has attracted a worldwide viewing
audience of millions throughout the world.
Perhaps the origin and evolution of life
is, given enough time, a cosmic in¬
evitability. On some of the thousands
of millions of planets in the Milky Way
Galaxy, life may never arise. On others
it may arise and die out, or never evolve
beyond its simplest forms. And on
some small fraction of worlds there
may develop intelligences and civiliza¬
tions more advanced than our own.
Occasionally someone remarks on
what a lucky coincidence it is that the
Earth is perfectly suitable for life
moderate temperatures, liquid, water,
oxygen atmosphere, and so on. But this
is, at least in part, a confusion of cause
and effect. We earthlings are supreme¬
ly well adapted to the environment of
the Earth because we grew up here.
Those earlier forms of life that were not
well adapted died. We are descended
from the organisms that did well.
Organisms that evolve on a quite dif¬
ferent world will doubtless sing its
praises too.
All life on Earth is closely related.
We have a common organic chemistry
and a common evolutionary heritage.
As a result, our biologists are pro¬
foundly limited. They study only a
single kind of biology, one lonely
theme in the music of life. Is this faint
and reedy tune the only voice for
thousands of light-years? Or is there a
kind of cosmic fugue, with themes and
counterpoints, dissonances and har¬
monies, a thousand million different
voices playing the life music of the
Galaxy?
What happened here on Earth may
be more or less typical of the evolution
of life on many worlds; but in such
details as the chemistry of proteins or
the neurology of brains, the story of
life on Earth may be unique in all the
Milky Way Galaxy.

sand million years ago. We know from
the fossil record that the origin of life
happened soon after, perhaps around
four thousand million years ago, in the
ponds and oceans of the primitive
Earth.
The first living things were not
anything so complicated as a one-celled
organism, already a highly
sophisticated form of life. The first
stirrings were much more humble. In
those early days, lightning and ultra¬
violet light from the Sun were breaking
apart the simple hydrogen-rich
molecules of the primitive atmosphere,
the fragments spontaneously recom-
bining into more and more complex
molecules. The products of this early
chemistry were dissolved in the oceans,
forming a kind of organic soup of
gradually increasing complexity, until
one day, quite by accident, a molecule
arose that was able to make crude
copies of itself, using as building blocks
other molecules in the soup.
This was the earliest ancestor of
deoxyribonucleic acid (DNA), the
master molecule of life on Earth. It is
shaped like a ladder twisted into a
helix, the rungs available in four dif¬
ferent molecular parts, which con¬
stitute the four letters of the genetic
code. These rungs, called nucleotides,
spell out the hereditary instructions for
making a given organism.
Every lifeform on Earth has a dif¬
ferent set of instructions, written out in
essentially the same language. The
reason organisms are different is the
differences in their nucleic instructions.
A mutation is a change in a nucleotide,
copied in the next generation, which
breeds true. Since mutations are ran¬
dom nucleotide changes, most of them
are harmful or lethal, coding into ex¬
istence non-functional enzymes. It is a
long wait before a mutation makes an
organism work better. And yet it is that
improbable event, a small beneficial
mutation in a nucleotide a ten-
millionth of a centimetre across, that
makes evolution work.
Four thousand million years ago, the
Earth was a molecular Garden of Eden.
There were as yet no predators. Some
molecules reproduced themselves in¬
efficiently, competing for building
blocks, and left crude copies of
themselves. With reproduction, muta¬
tion and the selective elimination of the
least efficient varieties, evolution was
well under way, even at the molecular
level.
As time went on they got better at
reproducing. Molecules with specializ¬
ed functions eventually joined
together, making a kind of molecular
collectivity the first cell.
By three thousand million years ago,
a number of one-celled plants had join¬
ed together, perhaps because a muta¬
tion prevented a single cell from
separating after splitting in two. The
first multi-cellular organisms had
evolved. Every cell of your body is a
kind of commune, with once free-living
parts all banded together for the com¬
mon good. And you are made of a hun¬
dred million million cells. We are, each
of us, a multitude.
Sex seems to have been invented
around two thousand million years
ago. Before then, new varieties of
organisms could arise only from the ac¬
cumulation of random mutations the
selection of changes, letter by letter, in
the genetic instructions. Evolution
must have been agonizingly slow. With
the invention of sex, two organisms
could exchange whole paragraphs,
pages and books of their DNA code,
producing new varieties ready for the
sieve of selection.
By one thousand million years ago,
plants, working co-operatively, had
made a stunning change in the environ-

ment of the Earth. Green plants
generate molecular oxygen. Since the
oceans were by now filled with simple
green plants, oxygen was becoming a
major constituent of the Earth's at¬
mosphere, altering it irreversibly from
its original hydrogen-rich character
and ending the epoch of Earth history
when the stuff of life was made by non-
biological processes. But oxygen tends
to make organic molecules fall to
pieces. Despite our fondness for it, it is
fundamentally a poison for un¬
protected organic matter.
The transition to an oxidising at¬
mosphere posed a supreme crisis in the
history of life, and a great many
organisms, unable to cope with oxy¬
gen, perished. A few primitive forms,
such as the botulism and tetanus
bacilli, manage to survive even today in
oxygen-free . environments. The
nitrogen in the Earth's atmosphere is
much more chemically inert and
therefore much more benign than oxy¬
gen. But it too is biologically sustained.
Thus ninety-nine per cent of the
Earth's atmosphere is of biological
origin. The sky is made of life.
For most of the four thousand
million years since the origin of life, the
dominant organisms were microscopic
blue-green algae, which covered and
filled the oceans. Then, some six hun¬
dred million years ago, the monopoliz¬
ing grip of the algae was broken and an
enormous proliferation of new
lifeforms emerged, an event called the
Cambrian explosion.
Life had arisen almost immediately
after the origin of the Earth, which sug¬
gests that life may be an inevitable
chemical process on an Earth-like
planet. But life did not evolve much
beyond blue-green algae for three thou¬
sand million years, which suggests that
large lifeforms with specialized organs
are hard to evolve, harder even than the
origin of life. Perhaps there are many
other planets that today have abundant
microbes but no big beasts and
vegetables.
Soon after the Cambrian explosion,
the oceans teemed with many different
forms of life. By five hundred million
years ago there were vast herds of
trilobites, beautifully constructed
animals, a little like large insects. They
stored crystals in their eyes to detect
polarized light. But there are no
trilobites alive today; there have been
none for two hundred million years.
The Earth used to be inhabited by
plants and animals of which there is to¬
day no living trace. And of course every
species now on the planet once did not
exist. There is no hint in the old rock of
animals like us. Species appear, abide
more or less briefly, and then flicker
out.
Before the Cambrian explosion
species seem to have succeeded one
another rather slowly. But after the
Cambrian explosion exquisite new
adaptations followed one another with
comparatively breathtaking speed.
In rapid succession, the first fish and
the first vertebrates appeared; plants,
previously restricted to the oceans,
began the colonization of the land; the
first insect evolved, and its descendants
became the pioneers in the colonization
of the land by animals; winged insects
arose together with the amphibians,
creatures something like the lungfish,
able to survive both on land and in the
water; the first trees and the first rep¬
tiles appeared; the dinosaurs evolved;
the mammals emerged, and then the
first birds; the first flowers appeared;
the dinosaurs became extinct; the
earliest cetaceans, ancestors to the
dolphins and whales arose, and in the
same period the primates the
ancestors of the monkeys, the apes and
the humans. Less than ten million years
of life

Life has existed on earth for four thou¬
sand million years. For about half of that
time organisms reproduced themselves
by cell division which only rarely pro¬
duces new life forms by accidental muta¬
tion. The emergence of two sexes and
sexual reproduction, which made possi¬
ble the exchange of huge amounts of

ago, the first creatures who closely
resembled human beings evolved, ac¬
companied by a spectacular increase in
brain size. And then, only a few million
years ago, the first true humans
emerged.
There are tens of thousands of
millions of known kinds of organic

are used for the essential activities of

tions of genes, the chances of finding
beings who are physically very similar
to us is, I believe, near zero. The
chances of finding another form of in¬
telligence is not.
If there are intelligent beings on the
planets of fairly nearby stars, could
they know about us? One way would be
to listen with large radio telescopes.
Today there is a vast international
radio, television and radar communica¬
tions traffic. At some radio frequencies
the Earth has become by far the
brightest object, the most powerful
radio source, in the solar system
brighter than Jupiter, brighter than the
Sun. An extraterrestrial civilization
monitoring the radio emission from
Earth and receiving such signals could
not fail to conclude that something in¬
teresting had been happening here
lately.
Overall, the most pervasive and
noticeable source of radio transmis¬
sions from the Earth is our television
programming. Because the Earth is
turning some television stations will
appear at one horizon of the Earth
while others will disappear over the
other. There will be a confused jumble
of programmes. Even these might be
sorted out and pieced together by an
advanced civilization on a planet of a
nearby star.
The most frequently repeated
messages will be station call signals and
appeals to purchase detergents,
deodorants, headache tablets and
automobile and petroleum products.
The most noticeable messages will be
those broadcast simultaneously by
many transmitters in many time
zones for example, speeches in times
of international crisis by world leaders.
The mindless contents of commercial
television and the integuments of inter¬
national crisis and internecine warfare
within the human family are the prin¬
cipal messages about life on Earth that
we choose to broadcast to the Cosmos.
What must they think of us?

A telescope in space
by Albert Ducrocq
ALBERT DUCROCQ, French engineer,
writer, broadcaster and journalist with the
French daily newspaper Le Figaro, is a
specialist in cosmology and space matters and
was also one of the pioneers of cybernetics in
France. The mostrecentof his many books. Le
Futur Aujourd'hui, has just been published by
Les presses de la Cité, Paris.
DESTINED to multiply by 350 the
volume of the observable universe,
the Space Telescope will be the
most important scientific instrument ever
sent into space, according to NASA (the US
National Aeronautical and Space Ad¬
ministration) administrator James Beggs. It
is scheduled to be put into orbit 550
kilometres above the earth sometime in
1986 by the space shuttle, to the dimensions
of which it has been tailored (when folded
it will be 13.1 metres long with a diameter
of 4.27 metres).
The key component of the 1 1-ton instru¬
ment will be a telescope only slightly dif
ferent in conception from that devised in
the seventeenth century by the French
physicist N. Cassegrain and the Scottish
mathematician James Gregory: the light
rays strike a hyperboloidal primary mirror
with a diameter of 2.4 metres; they are
reflected to a 30-centimetre secondary mir¬
ror five metres away before being directed
through a 60-centimetre hole in the centre
of the primary mirror and penetrating back
into an instrument section consisting of a
photometer, two spectrographs (a high-
resolution spectrograph to study the
chemical composition of celestial objects,
and a faint-object spectrograph to study
their speed), and two cameras (a wide-fiëld

camera sensitive to wavelengths ranging
from the infra-red to the ultraviolet, and an
ultrasensitive faint-object camera with a
field forty times smaller).
The great telescopes of Mount Palomar
and Zelenchukskaya have 5- and 6-metre
apertures respectively, but the Space
Telescope should produce a far higher per¬
formance, if only because of the extraor¬
dinary care with which its mirror has been
made from fused silica glass with a very low
coefficient of thermal expansion, fixed on a
honeycomb structure. Construction of the
829-kilo mirror began in October 1977 and
it was delivered in December 1978.
Computer-controlled polishing was so
precise that the overall deviation of the
reflecting surfaces from their ideal contour
is no more than 10 nanometres*; the same
precision was observed in the application of
an 80-nanometre-thick coating of
aluminium and a protective layer of
magnesium floride 25 nanometres thick.
Observations of the sky from the earth
are impeded by the earth's atmosphere,
which is always turbulent (even when it is
supposedly calm the stars "twinkle" in a
conventional telescope) and is slightly
1 J nanometre = 1 millionth of a millimetre.
luminous because it diffuses all kinds of
radiation. In space these disadvantages do
not exist.
How will the Space Telescope be con¬
trolled? Its rear section is a "support
module" which will act as a platform and is
equipped with a stellar sensor and a
gyroscope with a fine-guidance precision of
.007 arc-seconds. It will be possible to hold
the optical axis on to a point 30 kilometres
away to within 1 mm for a very long period.
For some programmes the optical axis will
be held steady for up to ten hours which
should make it possible to observe stars of
the 29th magnitude.
The instrument will not take
photographs. A solid-state CCD (charge
coupled device) system has been chosen in¬
stead of film. There will be four microelec¬
tronic silicon chips, each one a square
measuring 1.2 cm, with 800 individual pic¬
ture elements (pixels) on each side, so that
each-chip has a total of 640,000 pixels. The
sensitivity will be 50 times that of film.
A retransmission system in the support
module will relay information to the earth
by means of the NASA Tracking and Data
Relay Satellite System at a rate of a million
bits of information per second. The energy
distribution system will also be housed in
the support module. The current will be
provided by two solar panels, one on each
side of the Telescope. Each measures 2.3
metres by 11.8 metres. The panels are ex¬
pected to produce 2.4 kW.
Astronomers will adjust the instruments
and carry out experiments using scientific
equipment installed in eight boxes mounted
behind the primary mirror. There could be
no question of their being in direct physical
contact with the Space Telescope while it is
in operation. In view of the degree of preci¬
sion that is being sought, human heartbeats
alone would make the apparatus vibrate. In
the normal course of events, operations will
be carried out automatically according to
procedures controlled from earth.
From time to time, perhaps every two
years, the Space Telescope will be visited by
astronauts who will check the equipment
and make any necessary adjustments.
The Space Telescope will be the
spearhead of astronomy until the end of the
century. After five years' service it is plann¬
ed that the Telescope will be returned to
earth in the shuttle to be modernized and
equipped with the new and more compact
CCDs which will have been developed by
that time.

Glossary
BARYONS. A collective name for neutrons and protons.
BIG BANG THEORY. The theory that the Universe has
evolved as the result of the explosion of an agglomeration of
superdense matter. The expansion of the Universe is thought
to be the result of this explosion, with galaxies flying apart
like fragments of an exploding bomb (see article page 5).
BLACK HOLE. A hypothetical region of space having a
gravitational pull so great that no matter or radiation, not
even light, can escape from it. Such regions are believed to
form when a massive star collapses, having used up all its
nuclear fuel (see page 22).
CERN. Abbreviation for Conseil Européen pour la Recher¬
cheNucléaire (European Organization for Nuclear Research),
established in Geneva. Switzerland, in 1952.
ELECTRON. A negatively charged particle that is a consti¬
tuent of all atoms.
GALAXY. A large system of stars, dust and gas. The Milky
Way, of which our solar system is a part, is a spiral galaxy.
KELVIN. (Symbol: K). The Kelvin temperature scale, named
after the British physicist William Thomson (Lord Kelvin)
takes absolute zero as its starting point, as compared with the
Celsius (Centigrade) scale on which absolute zero is minus
273.15 degrees. The units of interval of the Kelvin and Celsius
scales are identical, so a temperature expressed in degrees
Celsius is always equal to a temperature in Kelvins less 273.15
degrees.
LIGHT-YEAR.
= 9.460 xlO15

The distance travelled by light in one year
metres, . roughly ten million million
LOCAL GROUP. A cluster of about twenty known galaxies
including the Milky Way.
MILKY WAY. A spiral galaxy of some thousands of millions
of stars, including our own Sun.
NEBULA. A region of dust and gas in a galaxy. Sometimes
used in the past to indicate a galaxy.
NEUTRON. An elementary particle that is a constituent of all
atomic nuclei except that of normal hydrogen.
NEUTRON STAR. A star at the end of its evolutionary pro¬
cess that has become highly compressed by gravitational
forces.
POSITRON. The positively charged anti-particle correspond¬
ing to the electron.
PROTON. A positively charged elementary particle. The pro¬
ton is a constituent of all atomic nuclei.
PULSAR. A rotating neutron star that emits short regular
pulses of radiation.
QUARK. A hypothetical sub-atomic particle. Baryons are
thought to consist of three quarks bound together.
QUASAR. Quasi stellar radio sources. Extra-galactic sources
of high energy electromagnetic radiation.
RED SHIFT. A displacement towards the red end of the spec¬
trum of the light waves from stars or other celestial objects.
The implication of this displacement is that the objects are
receding. Red shift is the chief evidence for the expansion of
the Universe (see page 16).
STEADY STATE THEORY. The theory that the Universe
has always existed in a steady state and that the expansion of
the Universe is compensated for by the continuous creation of
matter.
SUPERNOVA. An exploding star. At the end of its phase as
a Red Giant, a heavy star explodes as a supernova shining
briefly as brightly as a thousand million Suns.

UNESCO PUBLICATIONS
ON PEACE
Where the Future Begins
by Amadou-Mahtar M'Bow
1982. 118 pp. ISBN 92-3-102046-3.
20 French francs
A penetrating analysis of the world
problems to which Unesco addresses itself,
based on the opinions of the
Organization's Member States concerning
the shaping of its 1984-1989 Medium-Term
Plan. Ranges from the international
economic system, with the asymmetries
and inequalities it perpetuates, through the
relationships between science, technology
and cultural identity. Casts new light on
recent doubts about growth, and on trends
towards the renewal of values, emphasizing
in particular the inadequacy of solutions
conceived in a dominantly economic
framework. Sets Unesco's tasks for
1984-1989 against this background and the
vision embodied in its Constitution.
Consensus and Peace
