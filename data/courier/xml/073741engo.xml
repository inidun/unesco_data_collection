A Panel of nine experts on Fun-damental Education,... with
experience covering many. parts
of the world, has concluded a
week's meeting at Unesco House
in the course of which it discuss-
ed Unesco's Fundamental Educa-
tion programme and the work
being done by other organizations
in this field.
This Panel, set up by Unesco,
constitutes a fworld-wide body of
experts who are kept in touch
with the latest developments of
education through the Organiza-
tion's clearing house for informa-
tion. It responds to requests for
expert advice by correspondence,
by analyzing and commenting on
documents and other educational
material, by encouraging an in-
formed and active interest in Fun-I
damental Education, visiting pro-
jects in their own and other coun-
tries and by attending occasional
meetings in Paris.
The first 1948 meeting of the
Panel of experts has just come
to an end, lasting from April 26 to
May 1.
At the'outset, the experts

Dr. BEEBY ARRIVES
TO TAKE UP POST
Dr. Clarence E. Beeby, a lead-
ing world figure in progressive
education, arrived in Paris on
April 21, following his recent ap-
pointment as Assistant Director-
General of Unesco with special
responsibilities in the field of
education. To take up his post at
Unesco headquarters, Dr. Beeby
has been granted an 18-month
leave of absence by the New Zea-
land Government with which he
is Director of Education.
Dr. Beeby, born in 1902, was
educated in England and New
Zealand, and later became Pro-
fessor of Philosophy and Psycho-
logy at the University of New it
Zealand. In 1934 he became the
first Director of the New Zea-
land Council for Educational Re-
search.
For the past eight years he has
been Director of New Zealand's
sohool system during which time
he wars also in charge of educa-
tion in Western Samoa and the
Cook Islands. Dr. Beeby helped
organize the attack launched in
recent years by the New Zealand
Government on illiteracy in West-
ern Samoa and thus gained first-
hand knowledge of the problems
and difficulties which face fun-
damental educators in their work
with primitive peoples. Dr. Beeby
is the author of several books, of
which"The Intermediate School

Iquitos Meeting
Prepares Hylean
Amazon Institute
Delegates representing eleven
nations and seven. international
organizations have, during the
first days of their Conference in
Iquitos, Peru, made significant
progress towards the establish-
ment of an International Institute
of the Hylean Amazon.
The Conference, called jomtly
by Unesco and the Governments
of Brazil and Peru, convened on
April 30 and is scheduled to con-
tinue for ten dams. Its purpose
is to organize the Hylean Insti-
tute as an important first step
towards opening up the vast equa-
torial region of the Amazon Valley.
Delegates are considering a
draft convention for the Insti-
tute, which has been prepared
buy Unesco, and will draw up fi-
nancing plans and a working pro-
gramme to co-ordinate and fur-
ther research work in the mys-
terious region which has surender-
ed few of its sweets during more
than 400 years by exploration.
Opening addresses at the Con-
ference v ere made by Dr. Luis
Alayza y Paz Soldan, head of the
Peruvian Delegation and Dr. Pe-,
rez Arbelaez, head of ttle Colombi-
an Delegation.
Dr. Luis Alayza was elected
President of the Conference and
Dr. Linncu Albuquerque Mello, of.
Brazil and Dr. Rafael Alvarado
of Ecuador named Vice-Presidents.
A Scientific and Programme Com-
mittee was formed under the
Chairmanship of Professor Paul
Rivet. Director of the Musee dø
1'somme in Paris, with Dona
Heloisa Torres of Brazil as Rap-
porteur.
Following the first sessions, the
President of the Conference cabl-
ed the following message to Unes-
co :"The Conference... expresses
its gratitude for the most valuable
assistance of Unesco which will
ensure the success of the Insti-
tute. We look forward to your
continuing magnificent co-opera-
tion."
Iquitos, site of the Conference,
is the capital of Loreto Depart-
ment and an important center for
the tropical areas of Peru in the
Amazon basin.
Four Italian Libraries
Aided by unesco Grant
Four historical Italian libraries,
closed and emptied during World
War II, are to-day being restored
by assistance from Unesco.
Thousands of volumes of rare
archaeological and h i i tor i c a 1
works are being brought out of
storage, catalogued and prepared
for use once again by students
and research workers. These were
the archives of the Biblioteca
Hertziana, the former German
Archaeological Institute Library
and the Prussian Historical Insti-
tute in Rome, and the former
German Art-Historical Institute
Library in Florence.
The International Union of Ins-
titutes of Archaeology, History
and History of Art ! Rome) is the
responsible authority and the Ita-
lian government has provided pre-
mises and facilities for the work.
Unesco has allocated grants to-
talling eight thousand dollars t<. >
assist this work from its 1947-48
budgets. Arrangements to go
ahead fwere made with the Allied
Control Authorities, as all four
libraries had been German pro-
perty before and during the war.
3, 000 U. S. Delegates
To Meet This Month
AT UHESCO REGIONAL CONFERENCE
Further evidence of the active
interest of the people of the
United States in the work of
Unesco is seen in the announce-
ment of the forthcoming Pacific
Reg : onal Conference on Unesco to
be held in San Francisco from
May 13 to 15.
Approximately 3. 000 representa-
tives from toe states of California,
Arizona, Idaho, Montana, Nevada,
Oregon, Washington and the ter-
ritories of Alaska and Hawaii will
gather this month to attend : hie
regional conference, the first
meeting on the West Coast of the
Unite States of an official
United Nations Agency since the
UN Charter was signed at San
Francisco in 1945.
This was announced by Mrs.
Henry P. Russel of San Francisco,
chairman of the conference con-
vening committee who succeeds
the late Dr. Donald P. Tresidder,
President of Stanford University
(California).
"The idea of the regional con-
ference."Mrs. Russel stated,. ifs
that people in communitis
should develop a consciousness of
the countries which are not ad-
jacent to them
"Unesco believes,"she added,
"that if you understand the
varying cultures of the world, you
won't want to fight them. Our
regional conference hopes to
show people what ttley can do in
their own communities toward
the aims which Unesco hopes to
achieve on an international level."
Both national and international
figures are expected to speak
during the conference. Among
these will be George V. Allen,
Assistant Secretary of State,
George D. Stoddard, President of
the University of Illinois and
Margaret Mead, world-famous an-
thropologist from the American
Museum of Natural History m
New York.
Tf/. H. C. LAYER CALLS
For Greater Eftort
By U. N. and Unesco
A concerted effort by the United
Nations and its Specialized Agen-
cies"to meet the requirements
of the troubled world situation"
was called for by Mr. Walter H. C.
Laves, Acting Director-General of
Uneco during a meeting of the
Programme Committee of Unesco's
Executive Board on April 26.
Mr. Laves referred to the critical
scrutiny to which the United Na-
tions will be submitted during the
coming months due to an in-
creasing personal insecurity
among the peoples of the world.
"It is therefore of the greatest
urgency", he said,"that... every
element in Unesco's programme
be completely justifiable as con-
tributing t3 what will be recognized
as the real needs of the world..."
Dr. J. : ! ian Huxley, who rcently left Paris for a goodwill tour of
the Middle Eastern countries, in conversation with HE. the Pre-
sident of the l, ebanon, Sheik Becharra EI-Khoury, and two former
Prime Ministers, Abdallah Bey Yaffi and Sami Bey Sohl

Youth Camp
Organisers Meet

Organizations responsible for
over 150 international voluntary
work camps in Europe this year
met in Paris, April 22-23. to map
out a programme to cho-ordinate
and expand their camp activities
and to further co-operation wIth
Unesco.
Delegates from more than
twenty world voluntary groups
discussed the technical problems
of work camps, as well as the best
ways of using the camps as a
medium for building interna-
tional co-operation, and a means
whereby Unesco can assist not on-
ly as co-ordination agency, but
also in supply ; ng educational gUI-
dance and materials.
Libraries will be supplied by
Unesco for thirty of the voluntary
work camps this year. The orga-
nization also provides a clearlllg
house for information concerning
such camps, assists m publicizing
their function and usefulness and
will publish a pamphlet contain-
ing complete information on the
technical and cultural problems
01 the camps.

The children of Pestalozzi Village still har the psychological
marks of the last war. War orphans all, they are slowly team-
in3"to smile and laugh again. Their drawings and paintings still
depict the scenes of horror and denotation they have observed.
Technical Meeds Surveys
Proceeding on Three Continents
The F : eid Surveys into the
technical needs of press, radio
and films have continued during
the month of Apr1. All but one
of the field workers recruited by
Unesco to visit the countries
where the enquiries are taking
place this year have already left
Paris. To date these Unesco field
workers have travelled a tonal of
over 50. 000 miles in order to obtain
the information required.
In spite of the preoccupation
with the elections in Italy, M.
Artigue has almost completed his
survey of the Italian press and
rad'o. and will shortly be leavmg
for Budapest. Mr. Paul Anderson
has finished his survey in Austria
and the material is now available
for the Secretariat of Unesco. Dr.
Peter Bachlin, of Switzerland, is
now in Hungary for the survey
on films in that country, and will
leave in the near future for
Vienna.
In the Far East M. Robert Gun-
lain, who had previous been work-
ing for a French newts agency in
that part of the world, has been
in Pakistan and India and is now
en route for Rangoon. Mr. Alexan-
der Shaw, British documentary
film producer, is at work in Bom-
bay and has visited most of the
principal film studies n that
area. The survey of the newly
created Federation of Malaya wi1l
be carried out this month.
The enquiries into press, radio
and films in Venezuela have been
completed and most of the docu-
mentation has already reached
Paris. Political events in Colom-
bia prevented the Unesco field
workers froin entering that coun-
try, and in view of the destruc-
tion of archives and records it is
probable that the survey will be
postponed until 1949. Two Unesco
field workers are at present in
Ecuador, and will shortly be leav-
ing for Peru. M. Philippe Sou-
pault, who has been carrying out
the Unesco survey in Central
America has already terminated
his work in Mex : co and Honduras
and is now in Ciudad Trujillo in
the Dominican Republic./
The study of press, films and
rad'o in Haiti and Cuba win be
made during the following months.
A Netherlands film specialist will
shortly make an enquiry for Unes-
co into films in Mexico. It is
hoped to include research work
into the media of mass commu-
nications in Uruguay during 1948.
reason that their task is the es-
sential one of mobilising suppon
everywhere on behalf of the great
cause of international peace and
security.''
That was m 1946, when 26 As-
sociations signed the Constitution
of the World Federation or United
Nations Associations.
Today such Associations exist
in more than 40 countries. There
are thousands of lawyers, teachers,
students, journalists and others
all over the world devoting some
of their spare time to holding con-
ferences. writing articles, making
radio speeches, with a view to
winning pubic opinion for the
cause of the United Nations.
It took three years to plan D--
day. It will take a little longer. to
build up an effective United Na-
talons, maybe a whole generation.
"It is for your generation, wrote
the late Jan Masaryk, who was
President of W. F. U. N. A., in as
letter to the Student Section o
the American United Nations As-
sociation."to see that the people
of the United Nations, through
the machinery we have establish-
ed, rea]]y achieve the peace, to-
lerance and social progress which
the Charmer proclaims."
Obviously, such achievement
cannot be made by talking alone
What we need is action and the
activities of U. N. Associations,
their Student Sections and Edu-
cation Commissions are manifold
Highlighting these. activities jut
now is their active participation
in organizing the United Nation
Appeal for Children. Among As-
sociations playing an Important
part in the Appeal are the Aus-
trian, Cuban, United States,
French, Hungarian, Italian, Nor-
wegian, British, Swiss, Czecho-
slovak and Turkish Associations.
In addition, many Associations
are co-operating in the reconstruc-
tion work which Unesco is under-
taking. The Canadian Association.
for example. took the initiative
in setting up the Canadian Coun-
cil for Reconstruction through
Unesco ; and during the recent
meeting of the Temporary Inter-
national Council for Educational
Reconstruction W. F. U. N. A. was in-
vited to ask some of her other
national associations to under-
take similar steps in their
coun tries.
The work of Unesco in general
is followed by our Associations
with the greatest attention, not
only in the field of reconstruction,
but also in education and culture.
Another example of thins lively
interest in Unesco is furnished
by the Austrian Association
which has just publisher the. first
number of a 48-page jJ1ustrated
review entitled Unesco.
Thus it may be said tnat the
World Federation of United Na-
tions Associations it a voluntary
organisation which is supporting
in word and in deed, the ideas
laid down in its Charter and
which are primarily to be carried
out by the U. N. and its specialis-
ed agencies-but which are to
find their roots in the minds of
the peoples of the United Na-
tions.
As Mr. Trygve Lie recently de-
clared :"Governments must be in-
fluenced by the peoples. The
peoples must tell their Govern-
ments that they want peace. I
am very glad that we have the
United Nations Associations and
W. F. U. N. A. They can count on
the support of the Secretariat of
the U. N."
National Committees
to Speed
Reconstrution Work
Creation of National Committees
in all countries to speed the res-
toration of cultural institutions in
war-hit regions w...., agreed by ex-
perts of the Temporary Inter-
national Council for Educational
Reconstruction TICER) meeting
at Unesco House in Paris.
Such Committees would make
more effective and extensive the
collection, despatch and distribu-
tion of materials to help restore
the centres of learning in the
recent battle areas of Europe and
Asia.'
Members sressed the importan-
ce of close cooperation between
Unesco and voluntary organiza-
tions in the work of reconstruc-
tion. It was recommended that
a conference be calmed of French
voluntary organizations to pre-
pare a National Book Centre
which would serve as a medium
for the international exchange of
publications.
In connection with the United
Nations. Appeal for Children,
Unesco announced the dispatch
of a leaer to twenty-five inter-
national non-governmental orga-
nizations calling for their support
for the Appeal. Favorable replies
had already been received from
fifteen of the organizations.
It was announced during the
sessions that Norway has decided
to set aside five percent (approxi-
mately $80, 000) of funds collected
under the United Nations Appeal
for Children for cuHural recon-
struction.
The U. N. Appeal for Children
HISTORIANS and statesmen
may disagree about the date
when the second world war start-
ed, but it is all too clear that tlie
world in. which we find ourselves
is still living in the horrors of
war conditions.
Today throughout the world
two hundred to three hundred
million children lack food, cloth-
ing and care.
Today in Europe alone, and
despite the efforts of the govern-
ments concerned, there are still
sixty mullion children under-
nourished and without clothing,
shoes or schools.
In certain famine areas, one out
of every two children dies in its
first year of life, without count-
ing the stillborn.
In Europe and Asia alike, on
our doorsteps and far away, there
are orphaned children wandering
in city streets or in the country-
side, hungry, cold and ill.
It was fitting that the United
Nations should turn its eyes to
this grievous problem. On 11 De-
cember 1946 bye General As-
sembly passed a resolution set-
ting up the U. N. appeal for
children (UNAC).
UNAC's task is to collect money.
It is making a single, global ap-
peal, for which governments will
be responsible, but which is di-

rected to individuals as well as
organizations.
The bulk of the donations,'n
clash or kind, will be distributed
through the International Child-
rens Emergency Fund.
In each country a national com-
mittee wiz be responsible for
launching the appeal, and in its
campaign wUl relY on the big pri-
vate mstitutions and on all men
of goodwill.
The utilization of the funds.
questions of foreign exchange,
etc., will be governed by indium-
dual agreements between the na-
tional committees and the Secre-
tary-General.
To-day fifty nations have ans-
wered the call.
It is Unesco's task to direct as
great measure of the world's
attention to the importance or
the educational needs of chUd-
hood. In most parts of the world
the war played havoc with the
schools. Today in cellars, amid
ruins, sometimes on the bare
ground, always in conditions
which are unhealthy, children in
hundreds cluster round a single
teacher and share a textbook, an
old exercise book, or a stub of
pencil
Unesco has made contact with
all the countries which answered
the appeal and has already induc-
ed several of them to set aside a
portion of the sum subscribed for
the most basic educational needs.
Thus Belgium, Canada, Norway
and the United Kingdom, while
giving the highest priority, as
does Unesco, to physical need,
have allocated to the Organiza-
tion a proportion of the sum sub-
scribed.
For the first time in history a
chance is given to every indivi-
dual to share in solving a prob-
lem which concerns ail 1Um'l. llty
now and in the future.
The United Nations Appeal
will be heard. The slogan"Uive
a day's work"will touch men's
consciences. A large-scale mobi-
lization for peace is under v : y ;
authoritative voices are making
themselves heard. With this help,
the generations of tomorrow I'IVill
be a little stronger and, bEing
better educated, will be able to
share in the building of a worM
where the links of brotherhood
will have been dra. wn c ! oser by
this act of international solei-
darity.

THE value of the International Theatre Institute to theatre people

in this interna'io-
nal organizal. ion,
because it is a
sound contribution
to the new world
civilization that is
now struggLng in-
to existence.
Then, when the Institute IS
firmly established and has linked
together the theatre folk of all
nations, it can proceed to orgamze
festivals and exhibitions, Droduce
a journal in several languages,
create theatrical scholarships and
fellowships, advise the newer
countries on the organization of
good theatres. and do everythinR
possible (without acting s a fi-
nancial manager) to assist distin-
guished theatrical companies to
cross frontiers and, if neces-
sary, tour the wide world itself.
Finally, the annual Congress of
the Institute will enable theatrical
workers in all countries to meet
and exchange ideas and if neces-
sary to plan joint action.
Many people imagine that thea-
tre folk are incapable of mee'mg
together and sensibly discussing
their affairs, finding common
ground, planning joint action.
Such people think of us in terms
0 {"temperamental" stars, like so
many petulant spoilt children.
This is quite wrong. Within the
past year I have been Chairman
of two important theatrical con-
ferences, namely, the Interna-
tional Theatre Conference oral-
nized by Unesco in Pans in the
summer of 1947 (it was this Con-
ference that planned the Insti-
tute). and the British Theatre
Conference held in London. Fe-
bruary 1943. Both these confer-
ences were very successful indeed.
and on. each occasion I ways told
by various outsiders how astonish-
ed they were to find delegates
representing the Theatre so bu-
siness-like, sensible, co-operative.
But there is really nothing sur-
prising in this.. The drama itself
is essentially an intimately co-
operative art. The good produc-
tion of a play demands that a
considerable number of people
must work together to achieve a
common purpose. Dramatists, di-
rectors. players, designers, theatre
technicians, are all thoroughly
familiar with these conditions of
intimate and often very delicate
co-operation. They are also used
to a fairly high decree of ela-
borate organization, for no good
theatre can be run in a sketchy
and haphazard manner. It IS
therefore not surprising that thea-
tre folk should be able to run
successful conferences, and indeed
set an example that other types
of people, always attending con-
ferences, might do well to fellow.
So it believe that the Interna-
tional Theatre Institute will be
more than capable of carrying out
the elaborate programme of good
work already designed for it.
The value then to people of the
theatre twill be enormous. But
what about people outside the
theatre, those who do not create
the productions but enjoy them
(we hope) as audiences ? Will the
Institute be of anv value to them.
or is it simply another profes-
sional organization ? The answer,
in my mind. is that audiences-
ordinary folk everywhere in all the
countries concerned-will greatly
benefit too. Clearly, they will
benefit simply as members of au-
diences. lust because what helps
the Theatre will help them too.
The range of plays and theatrical
techmques will be enlarged for
them. They will have the oppor-
tunity of enjoying the theatrical
art of other nations. But even
more than that is involved. We
live now in a world in which
international understanding 15
absolutely vital, for without it we
may easily begin destroying soon
the very roots of our civilization.
And, in my view. much of the
sharp disagreement, between na-
tions now do not spring, as we
are so often and mischievously
told, from fundamental philoso-
phies that cannot be reconciled,
but come largely from ignorance.
vague prejudice, and the fog of
cross-purposes in which so m3ny
negotiations are attempted. Any-
thing that dispels this fog, that
clears away some of this ignor-
ance and prejudice, will be dqJng
us a magnificent service.
Now I maintain that the Thea-
tre is particularly important here
in this field of mten1aliònal un-
derstanding. It is'the drama : ist
and his actors who give us a
really intimate, truthful picture
of their people. And we receive
that picture in the peculiarly re-
ceptive and emotional atmosphere
of the playhouse, where we are
more open to new ideas and ge-
nerous feelings than we are when
we are reading a newspaper. A
well-written and finely-acted play

by well-meaning politicians. It
shows us people-their hopes and
fears, doubts and dreams-and
does not ! k. eep us fixed among poli-
tical and economic abstractions,
many of them already out of
date. Therefore I say emphatic-
ally that a world in which an
International Theatre Institute IS
securely established. and is doing
all the. work it was mean : to do,
is a. far safer and more civilized
world than one in which the art
of the drama is imonsoned be-

house which theatre'people have
long needed in order to keep

BEGINS PHOTb
SURVEY OF WAR HIT
NATIONS
A photo survey of the needs
and problems of children *tn Po-
land, Greece, Itaiy, Hungary and
Austria has been undertaken by
Mr. D. R. Seymour, European
photo-correspondent for the New
York magazine"This Week"and
the London"Illustrated", who has
left on a three month'mission
for Unesco's Production Unit.
The photo survey will cover the
needs for education, housing,
clothing, food and diet, medical
care (with special reference to the
anti-T. B campaign undertakes
jointly by UNICEF and the
Danish Red Crass), recreation,
and the needs of handicapped de-
liquent and working children.
Special attention will be given
in this survey to the activities. of
Unesco and the other Specialized
Agencies in helping to solve these
problems.
These photos are to be published
in the form of five photographic
stories in the U. S. A.,' the U. K.,
France, Canada and Latin Ame-
rica. The plan is to make a com-
parative study of all needs in the
five countries to be surveyed, a
comparative study of one parti-
cular problem in the five coun-
tries and an individual study of
the most pressing need in each
country.

8irth of
IN the summer of 1947, a smallchateau built about 200 years
ago by Giovanni Battista Lulli,
the court musician of Louis XIV,
in the town of Sevres on the-out-
skirts of Paris, became the home
of the first Unesco Summer Semi-
nar in Education for International
Understanding.
When it ended six weeks later,
it had brought together almost a
hundred educational leaders from
countries on all the continents,
and had provided them with a
unique and profitable experierice
in international learning and
bring.
The Seminar was a pioneer
experience, challenging in concept
but with few precedents to guide
it. As an experiment it was and
is of striking importance to Unes-
co and to those throughout the
world who seek to make educa-
tion a constructive force for inter-
national cooperation and under-
standing.
The first Unesco Seminar fo-
cussed attention on two main
areas of interest : 1) Ways and
means of improving the curricu-
lum, within the educational sys-
tems of the member states, as a
means of developing world-min-
dedness ; and 2) the influence of
differences in cultural environ-
ment on the growth and adjuste-
ment of adolescents of various
countries.
To these principal purposes were
added many others arising from
the particular interests of partici-
pants. One small group, for
example, explored problems of
adult education ; one participant,
seeking to make an international
collection of songs for school use,
arranged for other participants
to send her copies of appropriate
songs from their own countries.
The Unesco Seminar was
neither an international conferen-
ce nor a vacation course. Al-
though many lectures were given
by distinguished personalities and.
were followed by discussion, they
did not constitute the principle-
technique of the Seminar. The
chief method of work was based
on the informal procedure of
"study cirçles"or of the American
"workshop,"the essence of which
is to bring together specialist,
with all their knowledge and
experience, to study clearly defin-
ed subjects, of varying scope. Each
group was made up of three to fif-
. teen people, working on a single
topic under the guidance of a
Unesco staff member.
The members of the Seminar
were leading professional men and
women in education. Twenty held
responsible positions in the educa-
tional ministries of their coun-
tries ; many were college and uni-
versity teachers, and outstanding
secondar-school teachers. Among
the, world-famous leaders who par-
ticipated in the Sevres Seminar
were Leon Blum, Dr. James Yen,
Professor Salvador Madariaga,
Jean Piaget and Margaret Mead.
"A necessary condition for
effective international organiza-
tion,"Leon Blum told the partici-
pants, is the undertaking in which
you are at the very moment co-
operating. Education both for the
child and the adult ; culture both
for the individual and for the
multitude ; the increase of re-
search and scientific knowledge...
the Unesco Seminar,.
that is the essential aim of
Unesco."
Indeed, the Sevres. Seminar set
in motion a chain of activities
extending into many parts of the
globe, on to many levels of educa-
tion. Its members have become
field agents of Unesco, carrying
ideas acquire ajt Sevres to educa-
tional colleagues, through speeches
and writings, consulting with
many educational committees,
working with students, helping
train teachers, prering educa-
tional plans and formulating
poHcies.
A representative in the Seminar
from Brazil, for example, ! Who Is
responsible for radio work in his
Ministry of Education, organized
a series of-radio broadcasts deal-
ing with the work of the Seminar,.
soon after his return to his
country, and at the same time
wlllte a series of educational ar-
tictss for leading Brazilian news-
papers.
Two of the representatives from
Australia, were released from their
academic duties for about six
weeks after their return home to
travel throughout the country,
telling every malor educational
group in-Australia of the work
of the Seminar.
As a direct result of the Semi-
nar's studies on curriculum im-
provement. the Wales participant
has been appointed chairman of
a committed on Social studies
engaged in revising the curricu-
lum of Welsh schools. A partici-
pant from Sweden has brought
her Seminar experience to bear
on the work of a general com-
mittee on curriculum reform in
elementary schools in her coun-
try. The"Radiodiffusion Fran-
c a s e,"co-operating through
French members of the Seminar,
included in its 1947-48 schedule
a weekly hour on"Children of
Other Lands"using scripts pre-
pared and sometimes recorded by
school children in other lands.
Other schemes were organized for
the exchange of broadcasts among
various nations. The publication
of material from or about the
Seminar was made for virtually
every national area represented at
Sevres, while the number of
speaking engagements before emu--
cational and civic associations
was also very large. These resulted
not only in improved'Curricula
and methods of teaching, but in
new insights into the people of
other nations gained at the Semi-
nar. which have been passed on
to many thousands of school
pupils in different countries.
The 1948 Seminars
In the course of their meetings
at last year's Seminar, members
constantly/found themselves con-
fronted with related problems
. which could not be studied in
detail at the time.
This summer Unesco will take
up the studY of four of these
problems at Seminars to be held
in London, Lake Success, Prague
Caracas. They will deal speci-
fically with"The Education and
Training of Teachers,""Teaching
about the United Nations and its
Specialized Agencies,""Childhood
Education"and"Educational
Problems in South America." (See
details in articles on this page.)
In all these Seminars there will
be a"common denominator"
which is education for interna-
tional understanding, or to use
its new title,"Education for a
World Society.'"Unesco hones that
. with the valuable experience gain-
ed last year, all the group discus-
sions and all the lectures will be
directed towards the study of this
common theme, and will serve as
a stimulant in a widening circle
to educational effort in behalf of
Unesco's great objective-peace
and security for all men.
A World Citizen
By Leonard S. KENWORTHY
This is a personal statement by Leonard S. Kenworthy, formerly
head of the social-studies department of Friends. Central Schoot,
Philadelphia. Pa., and now on the staff of Unesco.
A WORLD citizen believes inthe necessity and possibi-
lity of attaining a peaceful
world society in which the
worth of all persons is re-
cognized and an attempt is
made to develop every indivi-
dual to the highest degree of
which he is capable in order
that each may contribute his
best to humanity, share to the
fullest extent possible in the
common achievements of
mankind, and enjoy the satis-
factions of such a society. He
is striving to bring about such
a peaceful society, based on the
ideal of a worldwide broth-
erhood of man, in which there
is an adequate standard of liv-
. ing for everyone, quality of
educational opportunity, the
provision and guarantee of
suitable work for each indivi-
dual, and the. provision and
protection of civil liberties for
all.
A world citizen is loyal to his
community and to his country,
but his primary loyalty is to
humanity.
A world citizen is constantly
attempting to acquire the ne-
cessary knowledge and to de-
velop the essential skills for
effective participation in his
community, in his country, and
in the world.
A world citizen is himself an
integrated individual, free
enough from conflict. insecur-
ity, and frustration tJle C6n
live at peace with himself and-
others, rather than projecting
his own conflicts on the indi-
viduals and groups with which
he lives. He knows that a world
society is built not only on
world organization politically,
socially, and economically, but
that it is built on right rela-
tionships in the home and lo-
cal community, and he endeav-
ors to develop such relation-
ships wherever he may happen
to live.
A world citizen realizes the
importance of common ideals,
common purposes, common
goals, and is constantly seeking
to increase the areas of
agreement among individuals,
groups, and nations. At the
same time he recognizes the
importance of diversify and
consequently strives for unity
rather than uniformity.
A world citizen is as object-
ive as possible in his thinking.
He attempts to develop his
opinions with a global perspec-
tive and to act accordingly.
A world citizen has a philo-
sophy of life or a religion
which enables him to pursue
this objective of a svorld eo-
ciety no matter wha. t, obstacles
there are to its realization.
His faith enables him to per..
severe whether this objective is
achieved in his lifetime arno.

On International
Understanding EduCatlOna
Last month Unesco published
the second in a. series of draft
catalogues of flims and filmstrips
as part of its Production Unit.
The latest catalogue is devoted
to films and filmstrips on Inter-
national Understanding. Titles,
language, producer, running time
and size of each film are listed
along with a short description of
contents. Among the subjects
covered by the catalogue are the
United Nations and the Specializ-
ed Agencies ; International Un-
derstanding ; International. Aid ;
International Economics ; Inter-
national Transport and Commu-
nications ; International Migra-
tion ; and Inter-Group Under-
standing.
The first draft catalogue issued
deals with films and filmstrips on
the crafts and arts. Other film
lists in preparation. will deal with
the Popularization of Science and
Fundamental Education.
been suggested for discussion at
the forthcoming Prague Seminar.
These are not fixed since the Se-
minar members themselves will
be able to share in the selection
of subjects for discussion, which
will by treated in relation to the
entire span of childhood educa-
tion, that is, from the ages of
three to thirteen.
Among the'topics which will
probably be considered are the
following :
What are the educational pro-
blems facing the growing child
today in relation to the various
cultural patterns of a given com-
munity, or of the world ? What IS
being done by teachers to meet
the specifi>z problems that dif-
ferent cultural patterns pose ?
What are the factors involved in
the psychological development of
the child ? What in particular is
being done in different countries
in the field of child guidance ?
for developirg world-mmdedness ?
What have been the psychological
effects of the last war on children ?
It is possible to glean some idea
of the scope and range of the
probable discussions from the re-
commendations given to parti-
cipants as preparatory work for
the various study groups of the
Seminar.
Thus we find that the physical,
mental ; social and spiritual deve-
lopment of children will probably
be discussed along with the ge-
neral psychological development of
the child. Here, too, the applic-
ation of psychiatry includ-
ing pSychoanalysis will p 1 a y
an important role. All of these
technical-questions will be examin-
ed insofar as they affect teach-
ing procedures and curricula con-
tent in schools.
In view of the importance at-
tached. to the development of
world-mindedness in children, the
Seminar will probably treat this
subject either in a special study
group or in general discussions
with the participation of all

her country during the last war

Mrs. Aase G. Skard, now Pro-

of 61 distinguished educators com-
ing from over 40 countries to study
aspects of childhood education
which are of vital importance to
all participants insofoc as they
contribute to education for. a
World Society.
These leaders in the education
of children will meet not to at-
tend lectures or to lecture others,
nor will they meet for a university
summer course. The Seminar will
be rather a plave where experts
can get together informally to
share their experiences and try to
bond solutions to similar problems
arsising in different countries
throughout the world.

will be done in small study groups,

The Seminar will be conducted
chiefly as a production centre or
workshop of materials for instruc-
ting soys and girls up to the age
of 18, about the United Nations
and its Specialized Agencies.
Each participant has been asked
to plan, before leaving for New
York, a particular project to be
developed, Thus, one member
might come prepared to do a
booklet on some phase of the UN
or its Agencies ; another member
might do a series of radio scripts
or a series of lessons for children,
or some other type of material. In
some cases, a group may wish to
work on a common subject. For, the
method of the International Se-
minar is one not only of individual
but'of collective work as well.
There, will be general discussions
and small study groups to exa-
mine the best methods of presen-
ting the United Nations system to
school children at different ages
and through different media. A
survey will be made of existing
methods and materials. These
discussions will be led by members
of the Seminar staff, by Seminar
participants, by officials of the
United Nations and its Agencies,
and by educational authorities.
Ample materials for the parti-
cipants will be provided by the
UN and Unesco. The library at
the United Nations will be at their
disposal in addition to the Semi-
nar reference library. Several trips
will be arranged to visit educa-
tional institutions in and around
New York City.
The reports of Member States
stem directly from Unesco's pro-
gramme in 1947 and in 1948 and
from a resolution adopted last
November by the General Assem-
bly of the United Nations which
recommended"to all Member
Governments that they take
measures... to encourage the
teaching of the United Nations
Charter and the purposes and
principles, the structure, back-
ground and activities of the.
United Nations in the schools...
of their countries, with particular
emphasis on... elementary and
secondary schools."The UN also
requested Unesco"to assist Mem-
bers of the United Nations, at
their request, in the implemen-
tation of this programs11 ?, with
the co-operation as required of the
Secretary-General of the United
Nations, and to report there on to
the Economic and Social Coun-
cil."
In pursuance of a resolution
adopted by the Second Session of
the Unesco General Conference
at Mexico City, the New York
Seminar will therefore be held in
collaboration with the United Na-
tions.

The Education and Training
Of eachers
Leon Bhim, famous French stateman, converses with educators
who participated at the Sevres Seminar, last year.
8'W'/I= DUCATION is the corn-jjt_ erstone of the structure
of nations and it is the
teachers who must be the arch-
itects". This was the feeling re-
cently expressed by Dr. Tchoung
Tao-Tsan, Inspector-General of
the Chinese Ministry of Educa-
tion.
Unesco concurs closely witch
this theme and is devoting much
energy to helping train teachers
who have so important a role in
the building of the peace. This
summer Unesco will cail together
a group of educators from more
than forty countries to a six week
Seminar to compare and discuss
the preparation of teachers for
elementary and secondary schools.
Scheduled to last from July 15
through August 25. the Seminar
will be held in England, probably
at Ashbrldge Park within 30 miles
of London. It is significant that
Unesco has chosen the United
Kingdom as the site for the study
center. Since the adoption of the
Education Act of 1944, important
efforts have been made in Eng-
land to improve and expand the
education and training of ins-
tructors. known as the Emergency
Training Programme.
Special courses, begun since the
end of the war, have already
shown excellent results ; and the
status of primary and secondary
school teachers has been measur-
ably raised.
For the Unesco Seminar in Eng-
land this summer a broad course
of study has been prepared. More
than sixty educators"broadly"
specialized in the education and
training of teachers and represent-
ing educational systems and cul-
tural traditions from many parts
, of the world, will be able to work
together in study groups from 12
to 15 members, and to make com-
parative analyses of methods and
materials. It is expected that
these study groups will work in-
tensively, ordinarily meeting for
several hours each day throughout
the six-weeks Seminar period.
General meetings will be held at
intervals. These will be devoted
to matters of interest to all parti-
cipants, relating bot3l t  the sub-
ject and the condl1'Ct of the Se-
minar. They (will also provide
opportunities for hearing of spe-
cial lectures. A series of film pro-
jections will also be included.
Emphasis in study and discus-
sion willie placed especially on
the following suggested themes :
1) Educating teachers to under-
stand child growth and develop-
ment and the influence of combin-
ed biological, psychological and
social forces on children.
2) Educating teachers for social
understanding, that M, under-
standing the social situation pre-
sented by the classroom, the
school, the community, the nation
and the'world.
"education for social understand-
ing may be regarded as a special
case of education for the develop-
ment of co-operative and sympa-
thetic intergroup relations. For
the \social attitudes developed in
the formative years derive from
the social experience of the infant,
the child and the adolescent. If
the teacher and the school are to
play an adequate role in the
fostering of tolerance and under-
standing between individuals,
groups, communities and cultural
groups, the role of both the
teacher and the school in relation
to the life of the community will
provide an object lesson of. pri-
mary importance.
3) Preparing teachers for their
role as potential contributors to
better understanding. A study
group on this topic might evaluate
the effect which curricula, instruc-
tional methods, textbooks and
other teaching materials have on
this aspect of education and train-
ing of teachers.
In preparation for the Seminar,
participants have been requested
to prepare in advance a succinct
statement on the education and
training of teachers in their res-
pective countries. These are de-
signed to help those from other
lands to obtain a reliable general
uderstanding of the most impor-
tant aspects of the situation in
the various nations represented at
the Seminar.
Unesco has outlined the major
points which are to be included in
each resume, although partici-
pants in the Seminar will be free
to adapt them to the particular
needs of their country. The out-
line will cover information on the
general character of the school
system, on the institutions and re-
quirements for admission of
teachers in different types of
schools, on problems specifically
related to education for better
international understanding and
the factors favourably or un-
favourably affecting prospects of
improving teacher training and. education.
The Director of the London Se-
minar will be Dr. Karl W. Bigelow,
Professor of Education at Teach-
er. s' College, Columbia University :
Dr. Bigelow is the author of sev-
eral volumes on the education of
teachers, and in 1947 completed a
tour of teacher training institu-
tions in Europe. The experience
he gained at last year's Seminar
at Sevres will undoubtedly serve
as an important guide in conduct-

6 UNESCO COURIER Votume 1.-No. 4
The Stor on the. Field
Science CooperationOffices
SCIENCES and technology arenow playing and will mereas-
ingly p'ay so intimate a part in
all human activities that new
means whereby science can effec-
tivily transcend national and 10-.
cal limitations are urgently ne-
cessary.
Science the 17th century, when
the first academes appointed for-
eign secretaries to take charge of
correspondence with observers in
other countries there has grown
up spontaneously, organized by
scientists, multi-nat : onal but spe-
cialized international seientific
un'ons. These are now federated
in the International Council of
Scientific Unions M. CJS. U.) with
Ofhich Unesco has a formal agree-
ment and represent the most
authoritative international group-
ings of the scientists in the ma-
jority of the fields of pure
science.
During the last war. when these
spontaneous international agen-
cies were forced to suspend their
activities, some of the United Na-
tions set up in one another's capi-
tals"Science Co-operation Offi-
ces". The crucial importance of
scientific knowledge to the con-
duct of the war made it necessary
to ensure that the democratic
countries POOit'U
their informa
tion.
In contrast to
thescientific
congresses and
unions, the wartime science co-
operation offices. were not con-
fined to any one particular
sciencs. Much attention was given
to the applied sciences. But they
were bilateral and restricted as to
national scope.
It has often been said that
what was needed was a system
which would combine the desir-
able parts of these two principle
methods of international scienti-
folk co-operation. Unesco, in its
scientific function, was the germ
of such a system By its form : : :. 1
agreement with the I. C. S. U., it ; s
substantially aiding the con-
caresses and unions ; by its chain
of Field Science Co-opsration 01-
fices it is atte, mpt'ng to fulfil the
other function.
In 1946, the Preparatory Com-
mission creating Unesco proposed
the setting up of a system of field
science co-operation offices to
maintain more effective contact
between the scientists and techno-
logists in these parts of the 1W0rld
remote from the main centres of
research and development and
their colleagues at these centres.
This proposal was later endorsed
and authorized by both the First..
and Second Sessions of Unesco's
General Conference.
Field Science Co-operaton Of-
fices were opened in Latin Amer-
ica (Rio de Janeiro), the Middle
East (Cairo) and East Asia
(Nanking) during 1947. A fourth
off'ce in South Asia (India) iwas
officially established on April 15
at Delhi Un : versity.
Why it may be asked, is the
Unesco Field Science Co-opera-
tion Office necessary ?
A number of science co-opera-
tion offices existed during the
last war in Washington, London,
Moscow. Most of these were con-
cerned with exchanges of inform-
ation concerning the military
app'ication of science.
There was. however, one such
office which dealt with both war
science and scientific matters con-
cerning agriculture, industry, ap-
plied science and pure sciences for
reconstruction. This was the Bri-
tish Scientific Office in China-
(Chungking). From the work of
this office and other similar actl
vitie aros the realization of the
intense value of a chain of such
offices in peace-time.
In establishing its Field Science
Co-operation Offices, Unesco
seeks to establish personal con-
tacts with Government science
departements as well as scientific
societies, university faculties, re-
search institutions and individual
scientists and technologists. The
F. S. C. O. also acts as. a clearing
house and information centre for
the supply and distribution of
scientific literature and where
possible essential scientific equip-
ment ;'assists with problems of
scientific documentation (ab-
stracts, microfilms, reprints, etc.) ;
arranges the exchange of scien-
tific manuscripts, articles and re-
views for publication ; and studies
the possibilities of creating new
international scientific laborato-
ries and observatories. Among
these might be institutes of astro-
nomy, nutritional science, meteo-
rology, applied mathematics, tro-
pical life and resources (Amazon
Basin), health (specific diseases
such as TB and cancer), tropi-
cal diseases field research sta-
tions, oceanography and fisheries,
etc., etc.
The aim of Unesco is to locate
the field offices in the most im-
portant intellectual and techno-
logical centre of the largest of the
countries in the chosen region.
The scientists and technologists
coming from headquarters are
men of wide sympathies, able to
take a considerable measure of
initiative under what may be dif-
ficult or isolated conditions and
capable of understanding and
assisting in the engineering, agri-
cultural and medical problems of
non-industrialized areas. They
constitute the nucleus of the
demic, unpublished data from the
U. S. A. on copreant bodies in en-
teric infections (infections from
fecal matter) for Egyptian bacte-
riologists. This aided the great
effort made by the World Health
Organizat : on during the crisis.
The Middle East office has also
provided information on current
work on genetics, on the organiza-
tion of scientific research in dif-
ferent countries, special informa-
_lion on certain lesser-known
scientific publications, arrange-
ments for Egyptian optical tech-
nicians to gain experience in
Swiss firms and the exchange of
information on bilharziasis and
schistosomiasis (diseases caused
by the most dangerous parasHes
in the human blood, especially
common in Egypt and other parts
of Africa) with the Latin Amer-
ican Field Science office and with
WHO.
It is interesting to note how the
Middle East office has been able
to make available information on
other aspects of Unesco's work.
One such example is Unesco's
Book Exchange Center. Scientific
men in the middle eastern coun-
tries are showing live interest in
the Book Coupon. Scheme and are
anxious to participate in it.

Field Team and they are associa. t-
awing with themselves whole or
part-time groups drawn from lo-
cal scientific circles who are fami-
liar. with the cultural traditions
of the region. Local scientists are
thus playing an important part
in the mach nsry of scientific
liaison.
The Latin American Office
From the beg-nning of its act-
mites, the Latin America Office
in Rio was entrusted with the
onerous-task of exploring the
ground for the establishment of
an International Institute of the
Hylean Amazon.

tanist from the United Kingdom,
ways named Principal Fieid Scien-
tific Officer and Dr. B. Ma ! amos.

tific Officer.
Travelling thousands of miles
in Brazil and elsewhere in South
America, the members of the La-
tin American office'were able to
lay the extensive groundwork for
the Hylean Amazon Commission
which met at Beém do Para.
Brazil, in August 1947.
During 1948 the work of the
F. S. C. O. will continue to be close-
ly geared to the Hylean Amazon
project. The Conference which
opened at Iquitos on April 30 to
found the Hylean Amazon Insti-
tute'will have benefited enorm-
ously from the experience and the
inspiration of the Unesco F. S. C. O.
in South America.
Middle East Office
The Middle East Office has de-
veloped vigorously. Ie-began ope-
rations in July 1947 with the
arrival of Dr. L. Thuriaux, agri-
cultural chemist of Belgium, as
head of the office and Mr. K.
Borch, mathematician of Norway.
Perhaps, one the most specta-
cularly successful actions of the
office (though only typical ot
what scientific liaison should do)
was the speed in obtaining, at the
time of the recent cholera epi-
In addition, collections of cata-
logues of scientific books and
instruments are being built up in
the office and have been avail-
able for consultation by the
scientists of the region.
East Asia Office
It had been expected that toe
existing currency inflation and
horsing in China woud make the
opening of the Far East Office
extremely difficult. and the ex-
pectation proved true. Neverthe-
less, Mr. Smid (a Civil Engineer
from Czechoslovakia) was able to
begin operation immediately after
his arrival last November, owing
to the ass'stance given him by
Chinese scientists and Govern-
ment officials.
Since U. N. R. R. A. came to an
end in China, the East Asia F. S.
C. O. has taken over the respon-
sibility of ensuring that engineer-
ing equipment to the value of
about-two million dollars reaches
the various colleges and universi-
ties for which it had been bought
by U. N. R R. A.Requests for literature and
aparatus are beginning to come
in and are being studied in con-
junction with Unesco's Recons-
truction specialists. The task of
the Asia F. S. C. O. was greatly aid-
ed by the work which had been
done during the war by the Sino-
British Science Co-operation Of-
fice.
Conclusion
In general, therefore, it may be
said that the Field Science Co-
operation Offices are developing
vigorously but along somewhat
diverse lines, as would be expecl-
ed from the very different condi-
tions of the parts of the world in
which they are located. The F. S.
C. O. serve as an important link
in providing the information re-
quired by the laboratories and re-
search workers all over the world
and in keeping them appraised of
the latest discoveries of their
colleagues in other countries.

Specialists Urge Co-ordination
of Scientific Abstractin g Services
SCIENTISTS depend to a very
large extent on short summa-
ries of scientific articles, called
abstracts,-to decide what to read
of the ever-increasing flood of
scientific publications. These ab-
stracts are generally printed in
monthly or Quarterly publications.
Some abstracts, called indicat : ve
abstracts, give merely enough in-
formation about the onginal arti-
cle to enable the scientists to
decide whether he should read or
not. Other abstracts, known as
informative abstracts, summarize
the principal arguments and give
the principal data of the original
article.
Unesco called together a com-
mittee of nine experts to advise
it on lines of action to improve
and develop abstracting services
for the natural sciences, botn pure
ant applied. The Committee met
in Unesco House, Paris, on 7, 8
and 9 April 194".
The Unesco Secretariat put bye-
fore the Expert Committee a word-
ing paper which referred to a
survey made at the Science Mu-
seum Library, London, in the
1930's. This survey mdicated that
abou : one third of the scieni : ttic
articles'were abstracted on toe
average of three times, and the
rest not at all. *
While not denying these flu-.
res, seyeral experts strongly dis-
puted the implied conclusion that
two thirds of scientifically useful
information is not abstractea.
They claimed that very li, tle of
value is misused by the abstracting
services. The discrepancy between
this claim and the figures they
explained as due to the fact hat
many scientists publish their find-
ings in several papers to ensure
that they are not overlooked by
any scientist to whom they might
be of value.
Many papers contain no I1"W
information, being merely written
to review recent work or to present
already published results to spe-
cial audiences. Such papers, al-
though they may be useful, should
not be abstracted, the experts con-
tended.
The working paper also noted
that many abs : racting services
cover the same ground and are
merely repeating each other's
work. This was admitted by the
experts, but they contended that
each broad subject field should
be covered by an indicative alb--
stracting service and also by se-I
veral informative abstracting ser-
vices, each covering a small por-
tion of the field from different
points of view.
The Committee made it clear
that there is no adequate survey
of the abstracting situation as it
is today, and it was glad to learnthat the International Federation
for Documentation has commenc-
ed to carry out a survey for
Unesco.
A valuable interchange of Ideas
took place on methods of prepar-
mg abstracts. Most informa : ive
abstracting services prefer to get
working scientists to prepare their
abstracts for therm as a part-time
occupation. By this method, the
abstracting services get the bene-
fit of the expert knowledge of a
scientist in the fied dealt with
in the article, and the scientist
benefits by reading the. latest
scientific papers.
Some services-usually mdicat-
ive services-prefer, on grounds of
speed of production and uni-
formity of style, to employ full-
time abstractors. On the other
hand, some services use abstracts
written by the author of the ore-
ginal paper on the ground that
he knows best what he meant to
say, and his abstract can be in
the hands of the editor of the
abstracting service as soon as his
paper, if not sooner.
It is essential that each ab-
stract should be classified in some
way if the scientist or librarian
is to find the information he Is
looking for without undue search-
ing. There are several widely used
svstems of library classification.
The Committee recommended that
Unesco should initiate a research
project on science classification,
using the methods of operational
research
After the scientist has found a
reference to a paper that interests
him, probably through an ab-
stracting periodical, he is still fac-
ed with the need of getting a copy
of the paper. In this connection,
the Committee recommended that
national information center
should be established in each
country, which would inform the
scientist where he may borrow the
periodical in question, or get a
photocopy or microfilm copy of it.
The Committee decided that It
is very important, for the progress
of science, that an International
Conference on Scientific Abstract-
ing should be held. The principal
subject on which the Committee
hoped the Conference would take
action was the development and
consolidation of cooperation be-
tween abstracting services, to en-
sure that the services cover each
subject field more completely, that
subject fields now inadequatelf
covered should receive proper at-
tention, and that abstracts written
in each of the major languages
should be available for all pure
and applied scientists. The de-
velopment of closer cooperation
may also be expected to lead to
more economical abstracting ser-
vices and more prompt publica-
tion.
Another majcer on which the
proposed Conference may take
action is the standardization of
the terminology and abbrevations
used in abstracts, and the layout
of abstracts. The conference will
provide a valuable opportunity for
abstracting services to exchange
information about the tricks of
their'trade, including their me-
thods of preparing abstracts and
the economic aspects of abstract-
ing. Methods of classifying and
indexing abstracts, and the pro-
blems that arise from the variety
of languages in which scientific
papers are written will also be
discussed.
The Expert Committee left the
question of the time and place of
the International Conference on
Scientific Abstracting to the Unes-
co Secretariat to decide. The Com-
mittee recommended that Unesco
National Commissions should be
asked to ensure a good represent-
ation from the abstracting services
in their countries and from work-
ing scientists who are interested
in the question as consumes.

Volume I.-No. 4 UNESCO COUR ! ER
Use of Mass Media Poses Serious Problem
! n Fundamenta ! Education Areas
ON of the atypical problemsmet in the attempt to adapt
the media of mass communica-
tion for purposes of Fundamental
Education occurred during the
American campaign in Burma.
The Stillwell Road had been com-
pleted in the face of almost in-
credible obstacles, and the only
serious danger that remained was
the prevalence of malarial mos-
quitoes. Tp instruct the Burmese
in the elementary precautions to
be taken against the disease, the
Americans made up some film
slides greatly magnifying the size
of the mosquito so as to illustrate
clearly the means by which the
deadly germ was carried. To their
dismay, at the first showing of
the film, the audience burst into
laughter. One of the American
asked the Burmese lad seated
next to him the cause of the
merriment
"Tn America", he said."mavhe
you have great big moaui : oes
like elephants and they must bf
dangerous. But here we have
teeny bits ones which only give
you a little itch."
Experiences of this sort are only
too well known to all educators
who have ever worked with any
of the mass media among popula-
tions less familiar with the con-
ventions of these media than the
adult urban audiences for whom
they were developed.
It has been suggested, there-
fore, that viewing panels be estab-
lished to sort out the most suit-
able films and filmstrips and that
these should be put to the test
by experts in P : : ot and Associated
Project.
An alternative plan would be to
send one or more visual educa-
tion experts with a number 01
selected audio-visual aids on a
tour of the world's most critical
deficiency areas and to u. P. the
results of the_r study as a basis
for the production of Unesco't
own sample materialll
The expense of some of the
proposed experiments and studies
wold, quite probably, be bevond
Uneseo's scope. It has been
suggested that means of financ-
mg, through national sources, a.
series of research projects on the
practical use of visual aids for
Fundamental Education be. con-
sidered.
The need of finding an econo-
mic and technological solution of
this problem before any discus-
sion of pedagogy can be attempt-
ed has become most dramatically
ohvious during Unesco's first acti
vities in fundamental education
areas.

It may be useful at this po : nt.
to examine some of the topical
problems which have faced a
Unesco Consultant, in a Funda-
mental Education Pilot Project.
Hfre is what Mr. Hubbard, Con-
sultant to the Pilot Project in
China, recently wrote in a létter
to Unesco
"... This brings me to what we in
China feel to be a most important
need. In the absence of electric
current in all rural areas (except
in one or two restricted areas in
the Mass Education Movement
field in Szechwan), there is a cry-
ing need for some means of gene-
rating light.
"I have tried acetylene (appa-
ratus bulky and difficult to a1 : just
to projectors ; pressure gays lamps
(the whole projector has to be re-
built and extra condensers insert-
ed in front of light) ; and hand
generators (expensive, heavy, re-
quire special bulb arrangement in
projector).
"I feel that Unesco could render
a very great service for all back-
ward areas throughout the world
by persuading some commercial
firm to solve this problem in an
efficient and yet economicallway.
"My own solution would be the
use of a first class bicycle head-
light, generated by friction on the
revolving wheel (or by hand),
taking the bulb out of the head-
light when showing filmstrips and
putting it into the projector, the
socket of which is fitted with an
adapter to bring the bulb up to
the right position for the light
centre. The bicycle is then set on
its stand and some one asked to
peddle it at the right speed, thus
lighting the projector. The main

squalid conditions. These condi-
tions, Dr. Welch explained, con-
trasted with those in other re-
gions of Africa, such as the Congo
and the Copper Belt of Northern
Rhodesia, where labour was im-
ported under government super-
vision, and where the authorities
provided for the education and
health of the workers.
After a discussion of Unesco's
Pilot Projects in Haiti, Nyasaland
and China, it was announced that
the Peruvian Government had
confirmed its proposal to establish
a Pilot Project in the Cuzco area
with the technical collaboration
of Unesco. The Project will take
advantage of the successful ex-
perimental work carried out dur-
ing the war by Mr. Truman Bai-
ley, an American artist, with the.
Cuzco population.
Dr. Rex, the U. S. member of
the Panel, revealed how Mr. Bai-
ley had set up a small workshop
as part of an educational develop-
ment scheme. By encouraging the
local inhabitants to come to his
workshop and try their hand at
using clay, wood, fibers and other
inexpensive Peruvian raw mate-
rials, Mr. Bailey was able to de-
velop the local skills and talents
of the people for the production of
useful, artistic objects of sales
value. This combination of artistic,
practical and commercial skill 16
evidence that profitable enter-
prises can be developed without
destroying native talent.
Gandhi
and the"Work Schools"
Dr. Zakir Husain, describing the
work done in India, gave details
of the experiment now being
carried out in the Champaran
area of Behar."Work schools"
have been set up which, by selling
the produce of their looms and
workshops, are able to finance
themselves in part. For many
years, he said. Mahatma Gandhi
had urges the opening of"work
schools"despite opposition from
university circles. and business
groups. The latter felt the schools
to be in competition with them,
while the universities opposed
their departure from the academic
studies.
The System of the"work school"
provides however, as Gandhi saw,
a way of bringing education into
direct touch with everyday life
and at the same time of he1 (Jing
it to support itself financially.
The problem of making Funda-
mental Education self-supporting
was further discussed by members
of the Panel who recognized the
serious difficulties that existed.
M. Colombain, of Belgium, describ-
ed the contribution of the Co-
operative movement to Funda-
mental Education, stressing the
development of cocoa and coffee
growing on a co-operative basis
in West Africa. He pointed out,
however, that this method was
not, of itself, a guarantee of self-
support since success was achiev-
ed only after a highly technical
and gradual development.
How popular prejudices retard
the work of Fundamental Edu-
cators was explained by several
Panel members. M. Deschamps, of
France, cited an example in
French Somaliland where the in-
habitants will not permit girls to
go to school. Dr. Rex stressed the
necessity of careful sociological
surveys prior to Fundamental
Education work in any area. He
showed how in Costa Rica, for
example, a health campaign had
to be undertaken in one region to
teach chiMren that oranges were
good to eat and provided by na-
ture not merely for ball games.
Elsewhere, field workers had been
required to teach the inhabitants
that eggs were good food.
The Panel of experts also dis-
cussed various other problems of
Fundamental Education, including
the use of films and filmstrips
and other mass media see article
on thus subject in adjoining co-
lungs) and the need for text
books and teaching materials.
The meeting at Unesco House,
which ended on May 1. is only
the first of a series which the
Organization plans to hold this
year and in the future.
As Unesco's programme de-
velops the Clearing House for In-
formation on Fundamental Edu-
cation will assume increasing im-
portance not only for the Panel
of experts but for field workers
every/Where. Some of the informa-
tion will come from Unesco's Pilot
Projects ; the rest will come from
organizations working on"Asso-
ciated Projects"-that is, from the
many enterprises throughout the
world contributing to the Funda-
mental Education movement.
It is one of Unesco's important
jobs to keep workers in. one part
of the globe in touch with the
latest developments in other
areas and to furnish them with
the most advanced technical ad-
vice and information. The Clear-
ing House thus serves as a collat-
ing centre'and a"conveyer belt"

mation all around the world.

believe that by its intelligence It
could penetrate all the'mysteries
of the world.
The New Society
from the political revolutions
a new form 01 government emerg-
ed, under which man felt himself
free and in which the State was
the instrument of his happiness ;
the old oppressions were shatter-
ed. The old ideals of humanistic
education were no longer ade-
quate, and it fell to science \. 0
set the new standards.
But progress produced new con-
trasts and new conflicts ; there
arose the problems of the poverty-
stricken masses, neglected by
these who profited from progress ;
and so new aristocracies came
into being which, if more open
than their predecessors, were no
less privileged. The State could no
longer limit itself to the mere
function of guardian of the law,
and it became an octopus-like
monster, invading every sphere.'
Conflicts between modern nations
became a struggle for power, more
violent than ever, and waning
imperialisms led up to the recent
catastrophies, extending over the
whole world and aggravated by
racial doctrines. The sense of
human dignity was foundering ;
man became an insignificant cog,
the tool of monstrous conceptions.
Scientific progress, even when It
was serving to give victory to the
peoples who were fighting for
humaner and more'democratic
ideals, discovered dangerous wea-
pons which, had they been avail-
able to the enemy, would have
brought about the final annihi-
lation.
Civiliza (ion in Danger \
With the immediate danger re-
moved, we find ourselves faced by
new and terrifying enigmas. New
wars must indeed be avoided ; but
peace must also be organized and
a truly universal solidarity and
co-operation created : This means
that the new generations must be
brought up. in a true humanism,'
wider than the former conception
which was often no more than
an aesthetic and classic ideal.
Technology and science, States
and international organizations,
must be placed truly at the ser-
vice of mankind. New paths are
therefore opened up for philo-
sophers and humanists, who must
prepare to formulate new ideals
for the spirit and to institute a
universal education to'enable al1
to share in the benefits of civi-
lization, bring the cultures of the
east and the west into contact.
and raise to their own level back-
ward peoples who still occupy
large areas of the world's surface.
No single type of civilization must
dominate, nor must there be pri-
vileged master races.
The Task of the

To promote ttlis prodigious task,
which may be long and difficult
but which cannot fail to have
lasting effects and. which is in-
spired by a generous spirit, Unesco
was created. Through it we strive
for a reconstruction of the spiri-
tual bases of humanity and a new
balance of its forces ; we seek new
ideals capable of commanding the
support of all men ; we seek to

Unesco Out tines
v  c r c s
Research Needs
IN COMMUNICATION TECHNIQUES
THE ; announcement that the Massachusetts Institute of Technology (MIT)- *-with the aid of a grant from the Carnegie Foundation, is about to undertake
a large scale programme of research into techniques of assembling, organizing
and communicating knowledge has been received with interest by Unesco.
In a memorandum recently forwarded to M. I. T. Unesco has suggested that.
in organizing their research
priorities M. I, T. should re-
late their work to Unesco's pro-
gramme in the hope that the two
programmes may be mutually
supporting.
Unesco recognizes two priority
areas for its work-the war-de-
vastated countries, with their vast
reconstruction problems, and the
countries and areas, in which
educational, scientific and cultu-
ral activity is underdeveloped and
which need active aid and advice
to bring their services and institu-
tions on toe level with those in
more fully developed regions.
The Unesco memorandum to
M. I. T. outlines in detail the
research needs in the special
fields of facsimile reproduction,
newspaper printing, colour re-
production on film, educational
film equipment, microfilm repro-
duction and mechanical selection.
It points out that"the proposed
M. I. T. research programme, while
serving to raise the American
standards still more, can be large
1y'directed so as to serve. the
special needs of the Unesco prior-
ity areas".
Facsimile Reproduction
One of the most fasclnatlng
developments in recent yea : s has
been the work carried out in fac-
simile reproduction. Although
considerable research is still
necessary it has already resulted
in the delivery ohiaily newspapers
directly into the home through
the radio receiver. On February
17 of this year, the New York
Times began the regular publica-
tion of a facsimile edition of its
newspaper. The facsimile paper,
reproduced by frequency modula-
tion is transmitted by radio every
day and consists of four pages.
Including photographs. Radio wa-
ves, passing through special elec-
tro-sensitive paper, produce an
exact copy of the original page.
The facsimile edition can be de-
tached from the home radio re-
ceiver.
Experiments are now being
carried out by newspapers in the
United States, notably the New
York Times, the Miami He-
rald, the Chicago Tribune, the
Chicago Sun and the Clatchy
chain in California. The Phila-
delphia Enquirer has published
most optimistic results in a pam-
phlet"A Facsimile Newspaper".
The system is certainly a success
jn the transmission of news
photos and has become standard-
ized in the U. S. *
Facsimile reproduction is par-
P. cularly advantageous because of
its speed. To reproduce a page
by means of facsimile normally
takes four minutes and there is
no time'lag in distribution. The
disadvantage, which might be
overcome by research, is chiefly
the short distance which frequen-
cy modulation (now used in fac-
simile radio reproduction) can
now attain. With an increased
scope it would be possible for an
owner of a radio receiving set in
Topeka., Kansas, for example, to
receive his copy of Pravda by
tun : ng to Moscow and vice versa,
with considerable advantages to
the free flow of information.
There is an added disadvantage,
in that few persons now own fre-
quency modulation receivers, but
it may be possible t convert fac-
simile to standard broadcasting
by means of a special attach-
ment, which, it is claimed, will
cost only $100 by 1950,
Although primarily a radio
problem, it should be noted that
30 % of the facsimile machines
in the U. S are being bought by
newspaper publishers. It is evi-
dent that facsimile has a future,
and not for the press alone. A
recent announcement in the Unit-
ed States by R. C. A. makes known
a new device, representing a.
great improvement over present
facsimile machines, capable of
reproducing one million words a
minute.
Newspaper Printing
"Of all current research and
experimentation in newspaper
printing,"the Unesco memoran-
dum continues,"... two processes
might most usefully be investigat-
ed by M. I. T. and Unesco in con-
junction, because of their obvious
application to the problems of
communication in reconstruction
and deficiency areas.
1. The new direct photo-electric
engraver.
2, Photo-engraving coupled with
electromatic typewriters.
This lattr system, which Is
already producing a newspaper in
Leesburg, Florida, is of consider-
able interest. Both stereotyping
equipment and type founding ma-
chines are eliminated, with a con-
sequent saving of time, space, and.
it is claimed, 50 % in production
costs. Lower costs might result
in less dependence on advertizing
revenues, with a consequent dis-
posal of a barrier to the fray flow
of information. This system also
does away with plate making
from matrices, the latter being
the chief problem for newspaper
publishers in the war-devasta red
countries.
Microfilm
Few libraries can fill war gaps
or rebuild war losses without the
aid of film. And yet, the Unesco
memorandum states, use of micro-
film is far less extensive than it
might be, largely because most
present day equipment for read-
ing microfilm is inconvenient to
use and possibly because micro-
film is still tied to the Clllema
technique of using film in reels.
Also no entirely satisfactory tech-
niques have yet been developed
for the rapid production of micro-
film or photocopy editions. The
Photos show Facsimile edition of the"New York Times"emerging
from radio receiver (inset and uppsr left). Part of a page, photo-
graphed after transmission is also shown above. The radio set is a
Frequency Modulation receiver which transforms radio waves onto
a piece of electro-sensitive paper, producing an exact copy of the
original page. Four pages, including photos, can be reproduced
in 15 minutes.

use of microfilm is almost entirely
research workeas and with them,
confined to specialists and
for the most part, is unpopular.
Colour Reproduction
The Arts and Letters and
Museums programmes of Unesco
stress the need for research into
methods of improving existing
techniques for the colour repro-
duction of paintings and draw-
ings,"so that faithful colour re-
productions may be made avail-
able to the art'student and gen-
oral public at prices within their
means."At present in spite of
the existence of number of first-
class techniques, comparatively
little high quality work is pro-
duced except in de-luxe editions
at high prices. Attention is also
urged towards improving the
colour fidelity in films of works
of art.
Educational Film Equipment
The key problem on the educa-
tional film today is not a peda-
gogical but an economic one.
Before any of the discussions on
visual education techniques can
be brought down to the : evel of
Unesco's workaday tasks in
deficiency areas, the cost of all
educational film services and
supplies must fist be brought
down to a level where the less
well endowed schools, un'. versities,
missions and other educatiollll
institutions can afford them.
The Unesco memorandum to
M. I. T. therefore suggests the pos-
sibility of investigating the tech-
nology of the educational film
with a view to reducing costs of
raw stocks, laboratory services,
cameras, projectors, screens,
sound recording and reproducing
equipment.
A closely allied problem is the
study of film equipment to be
used in non-electrified or insuf-
ficiently areas. Projectors that
may operate on coal oil or other
easily available fuels, laboratory
machinery to be driven by petrol
or diesel engines, raw stock
manufacturing equipment that
may draw on local machinery to
run with the cheapest and most
easily available power surly,
Mechanical Selection
At present the manually select-
ed punched card (e. g. Key Sort)
is the only selection device that
is economically possible for small
organizations. Automatically se-
lected punched card equipment
(e. g. IBM,-Remington-Rand,
Powers) has considerable advanta-
ges, but is prohibitively expensive
for most organizations. A cheaper
selector even with a considèraby
reduced rate of selection would
have many applications.. Similarly
a cheap, and reliable form of the
Bush Selector would be very
useful.
One problem of particular im-
portance to Unesco is the stan-
dardization of mimeographing
apparatus so that stencils produc-
ed in any country can readily be
reproduced elsewhere in the
world. At present for speed and
economy of operations, Unesco
constantly wishes to prepare do-
cuments in Paris which can be
sent in stencil to other countries.
This cannot usually be done be-
cause there is no standardization
of apparatus. The nearest ap-
proach to an answer to this pro-
blem is the offset machine, which
is expensive, bulky and requires
trained technicians for mainte-
nance and operation. Unesco nas
suggested that research along the
lines of developing a simple
economical standard'of reproduc-
tion which would be universally
used and unaffected by climatic
changes, would be most valuable.
Field Work
In concluding its memorandum
to the Massachusetts Institute of
Technology, Unesco declares its
willingness to help in planning
field experiments in the use and
development of equipment :
"Unesco representatives at-
constantly travelling in recons-
truction and fundamental educa-
tion areas and will gladly keep in
touch with M. I. T. in connection
with the development of the pro-
gramme."
