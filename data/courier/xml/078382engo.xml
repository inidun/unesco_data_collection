HOW TO SAVE

On the occasion of World Health
Day, April 7, 1972, the "Unesco
Courier" devotes this issue to
cardiovascular diseases a major
health problem of the modern world.
The issue was prepared in
collaboration with the World Health
Organization and the editors of
"World Health". In our cover
illustration, the artist has depicted
the process of agglutination in the
blood. Research into the biology of
the blood contributes to an
understanding of cardiovascular
diseases.

WORLD HEALTH DAY
-*h
YOUR heart ¡s your health"
at is the theme for World Health Day, 1972.
Public health measures against infectious diseases
are obvious to everybody. Urgent action is now
needed against diseases of the heart and blood
vessels, which are the main cause of death in so
many countries throughout the world. High blood
pressure, vascular lesions of the central nervous
system and congenital malformations, for example,
are common everywhere. Ischaemic heart disease
(See Mini-dictionary, starting page 10) is associated
with affluence, while rheumatic heart disease and
heart diseases of infectious origin are more common
among less privileged groups. Some causes of heart
Photo © P. Almasy, Paris
diseases, such as Chagas' disease, are concentrated
in certain parts of the world.
Although the increasing burden of cardiovascular
disease of atherosclerotic origin is to some extent
associated with the rising age of the population,
ischaemic heart disease is becoming more and more
frequent in younger subjects.
Enormous progress has been made in science and
technology and important social and economic
achievements have been accomplished. Yet health
indicators warn us that all is not well with our
civilization and that its harmonious continuation
depends, to an extent which might surprise some, on
the solution of major health problems such as the
cardiovascular diseases. The prevention of those
diseases will require some far-reaching changes in
our way of life and in order to make them possible
we must be sure that we call upon all the scientific
and technical means at our disposal.
"Pour la vie" (for a lifetime) say the words
in French carved on the tree.

Much more than we realize, the health of our
hearts is in our own hands. The time has come for
community action to control high blood pressure, to
prevent rheumatic heart disease, to give proper care
to persons with myocardial infarction or cerebral
stroke, to treat respiratory diseases that often lead
to chronic heart failure, and to diagnose and treat
malformations of the circulatory system in children
as early as possible.
We need better nutrition and healthier living habits.
Much more concentrated research is necessary to
clarify the unknowns of atherosclerosis and ischaemic
heart disease. Since some predisposing factors are
already present in young people, prevention needs
to be concentrated on the young adult, and even on
the child and adolescent by promoting their optimum
development.
We need better care for all stricken by heart
disease. In many places there are excellent hospitals
with modern equipment and trained personnel; but
everywhere there is difficulty in rapidly providing the
right care to all those who need it
This calls for increasing international effort, govern¬
ment support, active participation of health workers
and of the public. If all these forces will universally
unite, we may soon be able to live a better, a healthier
and a longer active life.
I hope that World Health Day 1972 the Day of the
Heart will give impetus to world-wide co-operation
in the conquest of cardiovascular diseases.
Remember: "Your heart is your health."

THE HEART
YOURS FOR LIFE
by Zdenek Fejfar
The popular conception of
cardiovascular diseases as a necessary
evil of middle and old age is false on
two counts. Children do have heart
ailments, and, while cardiovascular
disease is an evil, it is not a
"necessary" one.
As with many other problems in
today's world, a number of cardio¬
vascular diseases begin at a young
age. This goes without saying for
congenital malformations of the
circulatory system. Acute heart
disease associated with common child
infections like diphtheria still appears
from time to time, particularly in
connexion with epidemic outbreaks.
Rheumatic heart disease has roots
in streptococcal sore throats of
children. In some tropical and sub¬
tropical areas, particularly with crowd¬
ing and inadequate hygienic conditions,
crippling rheumatic heart disease is
very common among children and
young people in hospital wards.
Various other heart diseases occurring
in tropical and sub-tropical areas, such
as endomyocardial fibrosis (a fibrous
thickening that constricts the cavities
of the heart), or Chagas" heart disease,
begin in childhood and sometimes
lead to irreversible cardiac failure
even before adulthood is reached.
Functional disorders of the heart,
such as cardiac neurosis, are often
recognized in children or adolescents
and are frequently induced by a
chance discovery of an innocent
murmur. If this is incorrectly explained
as a heart disease the stigma may
persist throughout life. Neurosis
usually reflects the hypersensitivity of
the child as well as the neurotic
atmosphere in the family.

THE HEART, YOURS FOR LIFE (Continued)
6
More and more evidence indicates
that "middle age" heart ailments also
have their roots in childhood. For
example, this is true of hypertension
which accompanies some kidney
diseases.
Ischaemic or coronary heart disease,
the scourge of today's technologically
advanced society, may be due to
unhealthy habits which begin in child¬
hood. Several reasons support this
belief. The most severe manifes¬
tations of ischaemic heart disease
acute myocardial infarction causing
damage to the heart muscle, or sudden
unexpected death are now occurring
in younger people with greater
frequency. Coronary atherosclerosis,
impeding the flow of blood through
the arteries which is the commonest
lesion leading to coronary heart
disease, begins in childhood. Blood
cholesterol levels in children from
countries with frequent ischaemic
heart disease are higher than in places
where heart disease in adults is rare.
The habits which are involved in the
development of atherosclerosis and
ischaemic or coronary heart disease
are acquired in childhood and adoles¬
cence. They include overeating, par¬
ticularly rich foods with saturated fat
and purified carbohydrates, lack of
adequate physical activity and smoking.
The social environment of a child or
adolescent may also contribute to the
development of adult heart disease in
a modern society often demanding a
pace of daily life which exacts a heavy
toll. For example, the insecurity of
a child who suffers from lack of
tenderness or inadequate care from his
parents may carry over uncertainties
of life to school and later on to work
and lead to maladjustment throughout
life and eventually to disease.
Some of these factors are difficult
to control, others can be handled with
relative ease, although changing life
habits usually requires far more
effort than treating symptoms of the
disease with a drug. Some preventive
measures were accepted a long time
ago by the medical profession and the
community. These include early
recognition and treatment of congenital
malformations, of streptococcal and
other infections, or prevention of
cardiac rheumatism.
Health examinations in schools and
education of both children and their
parents help a great deal to raise the
awareness in the community. However
much more effort is needed to reduce
the chances of severe atherosclerosis
and ischaemic heart disease in adults.
It means increasing the emphasis on
investigating causes of the diseases,
on the recognition of known pre¬
disposing factors, and on introduction
of appropriate actions in children and
adolescents to assure optimal condi¬
tions for their healthy development.
It also means adoption of healthier
habits as early in life as possible in
order to set a pattern for the future.
The important rôle of the family first
and school later should be more
widely recognized and appreciated, be
it for adoption of adequate dietary
habits, or in sensitive understanding
and advice on how to overcome the
many smaller or bigger problems of
daily life of the young.
Regular physical education, with
emphasis on sports, must be encour¬
aged to counterbalance hours of
sitting at school and in front of the
television screen. Furthermore, the
young sportsman is not only less
inclined to smoke, but he is also less
apt to develop into a sedentary animal
attached to the seat of his motor
vehicle. He carries with him into
adult life a higher physical fitness
which may easily be regained even
after years of low physical activity,
and which should help him to keep fit
longer than the untrained "soft" type.
The disturbed youth of today less
inclined to compromises than their
parents apparently suffer from the
"achievements" of our civilization. In
this sense the burden of cardio¬
vascular disease cannot be lifted until
the ecological balance of society is
restored and a more sensible adap¬
tation of man to his environment is
achieved. The habits of childhood
often linger for a lifetime.

This graph reveals that more persons
(all ages, both sexes) die of cardiovascular
diseases than from any other cause. In 1967,
nearly one person out of two (46.2 per cent)
died of a cardiovascular disease, compared
with 17.7 per cent from cancer and 6.4 from accidents.
Among cardiovascular diseases, heart disease
kills one person out of four (22.3 per cent).

JEAN LENEGRE, who died in February at the
age of 68, was professor of clinical car¬
diology at the Faculty of Medicine in Paris.
A world authority on heart diseases, he was
formerly president of the French Cardio¬
logical Society and president of the Euro¬
pean Cardiological Society (i960 to 1964).
Prof. Lenègre was the author of many studies
on cardiovascular diseases and a member of
several medical associations In other coun¬
tries, Including the Royal College of Physi¬
cians, London.
Ischaemic disease (from
the Greek iskhaimos literally "that
which stops the blood") occurs when
the supply of blood to any part of
the body is considerably reduced or
cut off.
The most common of all the ischae¬
mic diseases is ischaemic disease of
the heart. The term covers those
diseases or disorders which result
from a major reduction in the blood
supply to all or part of the heart.
This may be brought on by various
diseases and by various mechanisms.
For example, a narrowing of the aor¬
tic orifice may interfere, with the flow
of blood to the coronary arteries which
supply the heart walls and muscles.
In almost 90 per cent of cases,
ischaemic heart disease is due to ath
erosclerosis, a general disease of the
walls of the large arteries which shows
a marked tendency to attack the
arteries forming the coronary tree.
The direct causes of atherosclerosis
remain a mystery but an increasing
number of facts about the disease are
known.
Coronary atherosclerosis is far more
common in men than in women, but
while almost all patients under the
age of 40 are men, this ceases to be
true as people grow older; from 60 on,
and more particularly after 70, it strikes
equally at both sexes. Thus women
are in general affected later in life than
men.
It occurs more frequently with age.
Coronary atherosclerosis before the
age of 20 is most unusual and is fairly

uncommon up to the age of 40. Be¬
tween 45 and 50, there is a substantial
increase, most cases occurring be¬
tween 50 and 80.
It runs in certain families whose
members, particularly the males, may
for generation after generation be the
unfortunate victims of the disease.
In industrialized countries such as
the U.S.A. or Great Britain, coronary
atherosclerosis is by far the most fre¬
quent cause of death. It is responsible
for 50 to 60 per cent of all deaths from
cardiovascular disease, which itself
accounts for more than half the total
number of deaths. Coronary athero¬
sclerosis kills three out of every thou¬
sand inhabitants of these two coun¬
tries every year, not to speak of the
one million work-days lost annually in
the United States alone.
The figures for Canada, Australia,
the Federal Republic of Germany and
the Scandinavian countries are propor¬
tionally almost as high. In these coun¬
tries it is the No. 1 health problem a
plague of modern society.
The same applies to France, poss¬
ibly to a lesser degree. However, in
spite of the frequency of cardiovascu¬
lar diseases, the efforts made at pre¬
vention remain far below what is re¬
quired. If the same effort were made
in France to prevent cardiovascular
diseases as is made for tuberculosis
or cancer, mortality would indisput¬
ably decline.
Over the past twenty years, doctors
have been making a tremendous effort
to find out what causes hardening and
narrowing of the arteries (atheroscle¬
rosis), and how heart disease dev¬
elops from atherosclerosis. Although
they still have not found the
whole "scientific truth" about the
direct causes of the disease, they are
getting nearer to it and have brought
to light a certain number of "clues" to
the mystery.
Since some families show a mark¬
ed predisposition to coronary athero¬
sclerosis, hereditary or genetic factors
have been suspected. Heredity most
probably influences the disease in a
variety of ways. Disorders of the meta¬
bolism and enzyme disorders such
as an excess of cholesterol in the
blood or diabetes mellitus and some
endocrine defects, may all play their
part. However, it is unlikely that the
heredity factor is a simple mechanism
of gene mutation.
Statistics show us that high blood
pressure is a predisposing factor: at
least 25 per cent of men and 50 per
cent of women with coronary heart
disease suffer from high blood pres¬
sure. Even a mild degree of hyper¬
tension in an adult may have serious
consequences.
In the same way diabetes can be
said to predispose to atherosclerosis.
Typical diabetes mellitus is actually
present in over 10 per cent of patients
suffering from coronary heart disease.
Certain diabetic conditions, where one
of the parents, usually the mother, has
a history of diabetes and/or the results
given by blood sugar tests are clearly
abnormal, are even more frequent.
Hidden defects in sugar metabolism
are often found in association with
abnormalities of fat metabolism. Thus,
some patients should follow a "dia¬
betic" diet and cut out simple sugars
and fruit so as to lower abnormally
high blood levels of cholesterol, tri¬
glycerides or lipids.
A theory that high cholesterol levels
may be responsible for coronary athe¬
rosclerosis has been gaining ground
over the last fifty years. More and
more frequent reports have appeared
of its coexistence with other diseases
of a completely different nature such as
diabetes. All these diseases, however,
have a common denominator a per¬
manently raised blood cholesterol
level. Even when no other disease is
present, patients suffering from coron¬
ary atherosclerosis are found to have
a higher blood cholesterol level than
normal healthy individuals of the same
age.
The incidence of coronary heart dis-,
ease varies widely from country to
country but studies show that such fac¬
tors as race, climate and geographical
situation are less closely related to its
distribution than diet and the level of
economic development.
Obesity, or excess fat, is almost
invariably due to overeating, although
in some cases another factor may
operate such as an inherited family
tendency to put on weight more easily
when calorie intake is high. In certain
individuals every calorie in excess of
the number required to satisfy the
body's metabolic requirements is
stored in the form of fat and leads
slowly but surely to increasing obesity.
The significance of obesity in coron¬
ary heart disease has been variously
assessed. It may not be the main fac¬
tor but there is no doubt that it plays
some part. This is borne out both by
the statistical tables compiled by life
insurance companies, which show how
life expectancy falls as body weight
increases, and by clinical studies,
some of which have shown that deaths
from cardiovascular disease are twice
as frequent among those who are
overweight as among comparable in¬
dividuals whose weight is normal (60
per cent as against 30 to 35 per cent).
Other factors have been suspected
of causing coronary atherosclerosis,
among them cigarette smoking, espe-

MINI-DICTIONARY
ON CARDIOVASCULAR
DISEASES
Aneurysm
Widening of a portion of an artery.
Aneurysm of the aorta occurs in upper or
lower part of the aorta, due to athero¬
sclerosis or to syphilis. Dissecting aneu¬
rysm of the aorta: an aneurysm in which
blood penetrates through a tear of the
inner layer into the aortic wall, disrupting
its tissues; fatal unless immediately treated.
Angina pectoris
Pain occurring centrally in the front of
the chest, brought on by effort (e.g. exer¬
cise, emotion, ingestion of food, exposure
to cold). It is felt as a tight, heavy,
constricting or crushing pain, but may also
be numbing or burning, and may radiate
to the left arm or both arms, round the
chest, or into the neck or jaw. A few
minutes of rest or a tablet of nitro¬
glycerine give quick relief. It is a symptom
of ischaemic heart disease (coronary heart
disease).
Arrhythmia
Any irregularity of heart rhythm. Some
arrhythmias are entirely harmless, others
may indicate that heart disease is present.
Arrhythmias occurring in acute ischaemic
heart disease call for emergency treatment.
Arteriosclerosis
Thickening, hardening and loss of elas¬
ticity of arterial walls, usually due to
atherosclerotic changes. The arteries may
become narrower and impair blood flow.
A therosclerosis
Lesions on the inside of the arteries
with fibrous and fat deposits that lead to
thickening, hardening, narrowing or even
obliteration of the arteries and thus impede
the flow through the arteries.
Bradycardia
Unusually slow action of the heart.
Cardiac arrest
Cessation of the heart's contractions.
It may take the form of a complete stand¬
still of the heart muscle, or of rapid, chao¬
tic individual twitching of the heart muscle
cells (fibrillation of the ventricles). The
patient must be resuscitated immediately.
Cardiac neurosis
Disturbed functioning of the heart,
though the heart itself is not organically
diseased.
Cardiomyopathies
Diseases of the heart muscle of various,
often obscure, origin. The dominant
10
feature is the great enlargement of the
heart with diminished function (cardio-
megaly). Chagas' heart disease is a car¬
diomyopathy in which the cause is known.
Cerebrovascular diseases
Any brain disease caused by impaired
blood flow. The main forms are cerebral
haemorrhage, cerebral thrombosis and cere¬
bral embolism.
Cerebral embolism
Occlusion of a brain artery by some
circulating particle, usually a small blood
clot detached by blood flow from the heart;
it results in stroke.
Cerebral haemorrhage
Bleeding in the brain because of a nip-,
tured artery. Hypertension is its common¬
est cause; many cases could be prevented
by adequate treatment of hypertension.
Cerebral thrombosis
Clotting within a brain artery. It deprives
part of the brain of blood and oxygen
causing damage to the brain cells. Cere¬
bral thrombosis is the most common con¬
dition underlying stroke.
Chagas' disease
A disease endemic in parts of rural
Mexico and Central and South America,
caused by a parasite that is insect borne.
The insect bites its victim and defaecates.
When the victim scratches himself, the
parasite enters the blood stream. The
disease may lead to serious heart damage.
No cure has been developed. Prevention
entails improved living conditions and sani¬
tation, as well as insect control.
Coarctation of the aorta
Narrowing of the upper portion of aorta,
a relatively frequent congenital heart
disease that can be cured surgically.
Coronary arteries
Arteries that supply blood to the tissues
of the heart.
Coronary heart disease
(See Ischaemic heart disease.)
Embolism
Occlusion (blockage) of a blood vessel
by a detached clot or by some other
particle, including bubbles of air or other
gas and particles of fat.

How to reduce
coronary risk
Stop smoking cigarettes.
Stop eating too much.
Reduce the amount of saturat¬
ed fats in the diet, by cutting
down fat meats and fat meat
products (sausages, salami,
etc.), dairy fat and hardened
margarine.
Avoid egg yolk; chicken is
healthier than eggs.
For preference eat cereals, veg¬
etables, fruit, fish, salad and
use cooking oils and soft
margarines.
Have your blood pressure
checked at least every five
years; if it is too high, stick to
the treatment prescribed.
M. J. Karvonen
Director. Institute of Occupational Health
Helsinki. Finland
It is unquestionable that there is a relationship between
cigarette smoking and mortality from heart disease. Recent studies
have sought to determine whether certain predisposing factors
exist (such as stress) which make the same people liable both
to become cigarette smokers and to be prone to heart disease.
It has been found that cardiovascular mortality is higher
in areas where the drinking water is soft, and specialists are
trying to determine whether some "protective" substance
present in hard water (photo left) is absent In soft water.
Obesity (photo below right) as well as the stresses of modern
society and sedentary life (photo below) have both been implicated
as causes of heart disease although some doubt hae been placed
on these as true risk factors by some medical authorities.

Endocarditis
Disease of the internal layer of the
heart, especially the heart valves, caused
by rheumatic fever, bacteria or other
agents, leading to leakage and narrowing
of the valves (insufficiency and stenosis).
Both conditions may be combined and
either or both the mitral and aortic valves
may be affected.
Endomyocardial fibrosis
A tropical cardiomyopathy characterized
by massive fibrosis (scarring) of the inner
wall of the ventricles leading to the defor¬
mation of the cavities and impaired pump¬
ing of the heart.
Essential hypertension
Hypertension of unknown origin, the
most common form of consistently elevated
blood pressure. In some patients the
disease is progressive, leading to com¬
plications such as heart, kidney or brain
damage, but which may be prevented by
adequate treatment.
Extrasystoles
Premature contractions of the heart that
occur independently from the basic rhythm
of the heart: a variety of arrhythmia,
usually harmless and insignificant.
Haemorrhage
Bleeding from any blood vessel.
Heart block
General term for conditions in which the
bioelectric current that activates the heart
muscle cells is delayed (or interrupted)
somewhere along its path. More specific
terms (e.g. atrio-ventricular, bundle branch
block) refer to the site of impairment.
Some types of block are innocuous, others
may point to serious disease.
Hypertension

cially when the smoke is inhaled.
Almost all the statistics agree that
mortality from various diseases is
much greater among smokers than
among non-smokers. This is true
for lung cancer, chronic bronchitis,
ischaemic diseases of the lower limbs
and, although perhaps to a lesser
degree, coronary thrombosis.
Sedentary habits, the stress and
strain of modern life, and some psycho¬
logical and emotional factors may also
play a part, though this is not yet
fully proved and requires further study.
The very fact that coronary heart
disease strikes more frequently in
nations that are economically rich and
whose populations are predominantly
sedentary and well-fed has led to
atherosclerosis in general, and
coronary atherosclerosis in particular,
being considered as a disease of the
privileged the price we pay for
belonging to what has rightly been
called the "consumer society".
What, then, lies behind this sharp
increase in coronary heart disease?
It has sometimes been alleged that the
increase is more apparent than real
since, with the improved diagnostic
methods at our disposal, it is possible
to diagnose forms of the disease
today which formerly would not have
been recognized.
It has also been said that the
increased incidence of the disease in
the second half of life is due above
all to the fact that we now live longer.
The proportion of men who die from
cardiovascular diseases in relation to
other causes of death varies from
country to country as follows: 21 to
37 per cent die at age 40; 33 to 51 per
cent die at age 50; 39 to 57 per cent
die at age 60; 48 to 62 per cent die at
age 70.
There is thus some truth in these
allegations. But Ostler, who a century
ago in one year met only rare cases
of angina pectoris among his many
patients, was as capable of diagnosing
it as we are today. Moreover, it is
difficult to explain away the increasing
number of cases among people
under 40.
While we have only a sketchy
knowledge of the direct causes of
atherosclerosis we do know quite a
lot about the structure of the lesions
associated with it. They consist of
diffuse and segmentary changes in the
arteries, remarkable in that they show
a predilection for the male sex and
the middle-aged.
The first anatomic changes occur
early in life, from 10 or 20 onwards.
The yellowish fatty streaks which
appear in the internal lining of the
artery are small at first and remain
inactive for many years almost in
definitely in most cases. With the
passing of time, slowly and im¬
perceptibly, thé lésions develop,
showing a preference for certain
regions and particularly for the arteries
forming the coronary tree.
Within these regions, they most
frequently attack the point at which
the main body of an artery divides
or curves. In these areas, the in¬
soluble lipid substances circulating
in the blood (cholesterol and fatty
acids) are precipitated on to the
internal wall of the artery and form
yellowish deposits which in turn are
soon covered by a gradually thicken¬
ing fibrous shell.
Thus an atherosclerotic plaque is
formed which infiltrates deeply into the
arterial wall, eroding or compressing
the middle muscular coat of the artery
and, what is more serious, bulges out
into the blood channel, which becomes
progressively narrower as the athero¬
sclerotic plaque grows larger.
This narrowing of the
arteries progresses very slowly. The
failing blood supply to a certain extent
is compensated for by blood supplied
from other coronary arteries.
The narrowing usually begins to
interfere with the functioning and
nutrition of the heart muscle in
persons aged between 50 and 70.
The normally slow course of the
disease progression as the arteries
narrow, alternating with regression
as the supplementary circulation
comes to the aid of the failing heart
may be accelerated by the formation
of a coronary thrombosis.
A clot of blood suddenly forms
around or near an atherosclerotic
plaque, completely blocking the artery,
and the supplementary circulation is
unable to meet the extra demand for
blood. That part of the heart muscle
which depends on the blocked coron¬
ary artery becomes acutely anaemic
and this condition usually brings on
a heart attack.
This can be defined as complete
ischaemia of a particular area of the
heart wall usually part of the wall
of the left ventricle. The stricken
area ceases to contract, fails to assist
the ventricular pump in its work, de¬
generates and, over a period of
several months, is transformed into
a fibroid scar, incapable of taking
any further part in the working of the
heart.
When the narrowing of the coronary
arteries or in some cases their pro¬
gressive blockage reaches a stage
where the circulation is no longer able
to compensate fully, any occasion

When the heart skips a beat
The electrocardiograph detects and records the electrical
impulses that develop in the heart and spread through its
muscles with each heart-beat. To make a recording, the
impulses are gathered at points on the skin corresponding
to precisely determined areas of the heart. Wires are
usually attached to the wrists, ankles and various parts of
the chest. Diagram above shows one normal sequence
in the electrocardiogram of a healthy heart with its small
bump, inverted "V", small bump. Arrows show flow of
blood through the heart during different stages of contrac¬
tion. Upper row of heart diagrams shows electrical impulse
phases. Electrocardiogram on left shows an irregular heart
beat (arrow).
when the heart is called upon to
increase its output may reveal the
diseased state of the muscle tissues
of the heart.
This usually happens when one
makes a big physical effort, especially
walking. After one has walked a short
distance of a hundred yards or less,
especially in cold weather or at a
brisk pace up a hill, or after a heavy
meal, the coronary insufficiency shows
up as a short-lived pain in the chest.
This pain, known as angina pectoris,
comes on suddenly, varies in intensity,
and is usually felt in the centre of
the chest. There is a tight feeling in
the chest but no loss of breath.
Nevertheless, it is unpleasant enough
to bring one to a halt or make one
slow down sharply. The pain goes
as quickly as it came usually in less
than two minutes.
Its passing is often accompanied
by stomach gurglings or by belching,
which gives the mistaken impression
that one is suffering from indigestion,
especially if one has just had a meal.
The pain often occurs while one is
walking but it may also appear for no
apparent reason while resting.
Some persons may suffer several
attacks in one day, others only two
or three in a month. In between these
painful attacks (always very brief and
never lasting more than five to ten
minutes) there is no feeling of illness
or discomfort and one usually says
"everything is fine".
Between attacks, medical examin¬
ations often show no signs of ab¬
normality, the heart appearing normal
under the stethoscope and X-ray. The
electrocardiogram is the best method
of diagnosis. In a third of cases it
reveals abnormalities; in a further
third, the electrocardiogram is not
absolutely normal but the irregularities
are slight and non-typical; in the
remaining third, the electrocardiogram
taken at rest is quite normal. When
the electrocardiogram is normal,
negative or difficult to interpret, it is
best to give a controlled exercise
tolerance test, after which any
irregularity present should show.
When the arteries become so
narrow that the flow of blood
approaches the minimum required by
the heart muscle, then the heart,
which normally needs a lot of oxygen
to function and is not getting it,
reaches a critical stage.
Pains in the chest become more
or less continuous, coming on after
ever slighter exertion and sometimes
even when the person is at rest. The
aggravation of the disease is apparent
in an increase in the frequency,
intensity and duration of the pains
and sometimes even in definite
changes in the electrocardiogram.

ONE PERSON OUT OF FOUR (Continued)
MINI-DICTIONARY (Continued)
Myocardial infarct or infarction
A manifestation of acute ischaemic heart
disease: the occlusion of an artery of the
heart cuts off the blood supply to a portion
of the heart muscle. The affected tissue
dies off injuring the heart. Symptoms are
prolonged intensive chest pain, fall of
blood pressure, and often shock. Many
surviving patients can be rehabilitated to
lead a fruitful life.
Neurocirculatory asthenia
Disturbance of the functioning of the
heart and circulatory system, although no
organic damage can be detected in the
heart and vessels themselves. Patients
experience a variety of symptoms and their
physical performance may be decreased;
there is no lasting impairment.
Pericarditis
A disease of the heart surface; rheu¬
matic fever, tuberculosis, a great variety
of infections and many other agents are
its possible causes.
Renal hypertension
Elevated blood pressure due to kidney
disease; some forms (if only one kidney
is affected) are amenable to surgical treat¬
ment
Rheumatic fever
A sequel to infection by Group A strep¬
tococci characterized by heart disease
and/or acute pain and inflammation of the
joints. The disease usually begins in
childhood with an acute attack and may
have a long-lasting course, since the
patient is liable to recurrences brought on
by new streptococcal infections: these
aggravate the heart disease, but may be
prevented by penicillin.
Rheumatic heart disease
Damage to the heart valves and heart
muscle resulting from rheumatic fever.
Because of endocarditis the valves may
become crippled (see Endocarditis). The
disease may occur without a history of
acute rheumatic fever.
Stroke
A colloquial term for any cerebrovascular
disease having an abrupt onset. The lead¬
ing symptom is paralysis of one side of the
body.
Tachycardia
Accelerated action of the heart. Paroxys¬
mal tachycardia is a particular form of
rapid heart action, occurring in seizures
which may last from a few seconds to
several days. There are several varieties
of paroxysmal tachycardia, some of them
harmless, others rather dangerous.
Thrombosis
Occlusion (blockage) of a blood vessel
by clotting within the vessel itself at the
site of occlusion.
a heart attack (Myocardial infarction).
In these circumstances, any one of
many "incidents" may cause the blood
supply, and therefore the oxygenation
and nutrition of the heart muscle, to fall
below the minimum vital level and
bring on a heart attack. The immediate
cause may be unaccustomed physical
effort (though this is rare) or a violent
emotion such as anger.
A meal that is too heavy or too
rich in fatty foods may affect the
blood supply in various ways. It may
precipitate an attack by upsetting the
water-salt balance in the blood, by
increasing the work load on the heart,
or by modifying the blood chemistry
and causing a sudden rise in the level
of triglycerides and fatty acids.
Heavy cigarette smoking and inhal¬
ing and various "incidents" such as an
attack of another unconnected illness
flu for instance, accidental injury
or a surgical operation may also
trigger an attack.
In most cases however a major
heart attack occurs suddenly and
without warning. It may surprise the
victim at work, while resting or,
without any apparent reason, in bed
at night. These cases of unexpected
myocardial infarction, particularly
when there are no warning signs such
as recurrence of chest pain, are
usually due to coronary artery
thrombosis.
_ a, .
recrudescence of chest pain (in 40 per
cent of cases) or apparently linked
with an "incident" such as the ones
described above (less than 10 per cent
of cases) or striking suddenly and
without warning, the heart attack is
characterized by a violent bout of
pain which spreads to the whole of
the thorax, often radiates along the
arms, and lasts not minutes but hours.
The immediate risk to a person
suffering such a major attack is even
greater than was once thought. Recent
studies show that the victim often
dies within an hour or two of its onset
If he survives this first critical period,
myocardial infarction usually develops
within the next few days a con¬
sequence of the partial destruction of
a segment of the wall of the left
ventricle.
Once the pain has subsided, the
arterial blood pressure falls and there
is usually a temporary rise in tem¬
perature to about 38 or 39 degrees
Centigrade (100 to 101 degrees
Fahrenheit). Blood tests carried out
in the first few days after an attack
show abnormal amounts of certain
substances (enzymes), indicating that
some degeneration of the cardiac
muscle cells has taken place. Their
presence and the irregularities of
successive electrocardiograms confirm
the diagnosis.
There is nothing to do but to put
the person to bed for three weeks
or so with appropriate treatment and
wait for the damaged heart tissue to
heal.
Although heart disease, and esp¬
ecially coronary heart attacks, are
obviously "Public Health Enemy No. 1 ",
they are not always given the system¬
atic treatment they require. This is
probably because heart disease is
often looked on as part of the in¬
exorable "running-out" of a human
life.
But nothing could be further from
the truth. Heart disease, particularly
ischaemic heart disease, strikes more
and more frequently in all age groups.
Its causes are often accidental, or the
consequence of years of accumulated
neglect. Yet in many cases it can
not only be foreseen and prevented,
but also cured. Proper treatment may
limit or postpone its effects and keep
the disease under control for many
years.
Much of this treatment becomes
critically urgent in the case of a major
heart attack when, as often happens,
the sick person's life is in immediate
danger. Every minute counts and it
is vital that the heart attack should
be diagnosed correctly from the outset.
This calls for education not only
of the public but also of doctors,
whose medical training may not
always have prepared them to under¬
take the modern and sometimes
"revolutionary" treatment called for
in these cases.
The classic treatment of a heart
attack which forbade moving the
patient during the acute stage and
insisted on his being treated on the
spot (often in his own home) is losing
favour. This was perhaps logical in
the days when treatment of myocardial
infarct was largely a matter of "wait
and see".
But today we know that the first
few hours are by far the most
dangerous and during this time "un¬
necessary" deaths may occur, not
because of irreversible damage to the
heart, but following a sudden dis¬
turbance of the heart's rhythm, such
as ventricular fibrillation (chaotic
twitching of the heart muscle cells)
or cardiac arrest (a complete standstill
of the heart muscle).
Such mishaps, against which we
are helpless for lack of suitable
equipment when the patient is treated
at home, are often curable if treated

in centres specializing in the handling
of heart disease, where "re-animation"
and "defibrillation" are standard
procedure.
In view of the immediate risk, the
patient should be transferred right
away to one of these specialized
"coronary units". This calls for a
special ambulance service equipped to
provide immediate intensive care and
able to go into action as rapidly as
a fire engine, and also the setting up
of special units in most hospitals for
the treatment of heart attacks.
These are by no means novel
suggestions such centres have been
in operation in the hospitals of many
cities for years. Any large modern
hospital should find it possible to
meet the cost of such a unit without
overstraining its budget.
,. .. . ., _
patients make a complete recovery
from a first attack of myocardial
infarction, and they may even be
allowed to practise certain sports,
provided that these cause them no
physical discomfort or other difficulty.
But even when "cured", myocardial
infarction should never be taken
lightly.
An infarct, even when healed, or
indeed any anginal pain, however brief,
coming on spontaneously or during
exercise, may signal the presence of
coronary atherosclerosis and indicate
that certain precautionary measures
should be taken.
The patient should be asked to avoid
any physical effort which causes him
discomfort and particularly any move¬
ment which brings on anginal pain.
If pain does occur, a tablet of nitro¬
glycerine should be crushed in the
mouth without delay. This drug is
harmless when taken in the recommen¬
ded dosage and its effect is little short
of miraculous. It may cause a head¬
ache in 5 to 10 per cent of cases
(disagreeable but short-lived).
It is erroneously believed by many
that nitroglycerine loses its powers if
taken frequently; on the contrary, it
continues to be effective indefinitely.
Of all the drugs known today it is the
most reliable, the most rapid and the
most spectacular In its results: in
90 per cent of cases it relieves the
pain of angina pectoris in less than
one minute. No other drug can do
this.
Other drugs, generally thought to
be capable of dilating the coronary
arteries, diminishing the labouring of
the heart, or improving the metabolism
of the myocardium by reducing its oxy-
HIGH BLOOD PRESSURE
Hypertension is a rise in the systolic and diastolic arterial blood pressure
above the normal. Systolic refers to the pressure at the artery wall when
the heart is in contraction and drives blood into the aorta. Diastolic refers to
the pressure when the heart is in relaxation. When the heart pumps rhythm¬
ically, blood pressure oscillates between the systolic and diastolic values. It
changes to meet the needs of muscles and other organs. Systolic blood
pressure is indicated by the first figure and diastolic blood pressure by the
second.
A casual blood pressure of 150/90 is considered normal in a middle-aged
adult, but other factors, including the patient's age, must be taken into
account. A systolic pressure of 160 is a more serious matter at age 40 than
at age 60. Although a person's blood pressure varies considerably during the
day and night, it will vary particularly with emotional upset. Therefore,
comparative measurements should always be taken under the same conditions.
Distribution of blood pressure among 44,000 people in Bergen, Norway,
show the following averages (half the population below and half the popu¬
lation above) :
Age 40-49 yrs. 50-59 yrs. 60-69 yrs.
135/80
130/80
Blood pressure in men :
Blood pressure in women :
These levels, however, may vary in different countries.
145/85
150/85
150/85
160/90
gen (and therefore blood) require¬
ments, may be used with varying
success to complete the treatment.
American surgeons have recently
perfected an effective surgical method
of restoring the blood supply to parts
of the heart muscle that have been
deprived of it, in cases where angina
pectoris proves resistant to medical
treatment.
To supply blood to the affected
parts surgeons use a by-pass graft.
A piece of the saphenous vein is
taken from the patient's leg and one
end is grafted on to the aorta, one
of the major blood vessels, the other
end being grafted on to the coronary
artery beyond the point where it is
blocked.
This operation, logical, simple to
perform and involving little risk, has
proved very effective in controlling
and alleviating anginal pain in the
chest, but it does not cure the
coronary atherosclerosis that has
caused a blockage of the artery.
Any treatment for heart disease
must include advice on principles of
general health and diet. This advice
is of great importance, as much to
persons already suffering from the
effects of the disease as to those
who, though apparently in good health,
have been shown by clinical and
biological tests to be affected by one
or more of the "risk factors".
Among preventive measures, by far
the most important are these three:
stop smoking (in some cases,
smoking is one of the major aggrav¬
ating factors and should be stopped
immediately and for good);
lead a reasonably active life, avoid
sedentary occupations, and exercise
enough to keep the muscles in good
condition;
keep to a diet designed to counter¬
act any metabolic disorder revealed
by biological tests.
The old saying "Prevention is better
than cure" applies to most cases and
underlines the need to set up special
centres for the diagnosis and pre¬
vention of atherosclerotic diseases in
general and coronary heart disease
in particular. With our present know¬
ledge of "risk factors", a relatively
simple examination should enable us
to determine which persons in the
community are "at risk", and to advise
them what precautions to. take.
If this advice is followed, one may
hope that within the next few years
there will be a dramatic fall in the
number of victims of heart disease
and particularly of coronary heart
failure.

GEOGRAPHY
OF HEART DISEASE
by
A.G. Shaper
and
Zdenek Fejfar
The human heart, that vital
busy pump made of muscle interwoven
with blood-vessels, is an organ about
which we know much but need to find
out far more. If it slows down and
fails to supply any part of the body,
that part may literally die; the result
may be paralysis of an arm or a leg,
or part of the brain may cease to func¬
tion; if the heart itself is deprived of
blood, death may occur.
Like any hard-worked machine, the
heart is subject to mechanical failure
from a variety of causes, some known,
others obscure. The distribution of
these ailments in the world's popula¬
tion is not uniform but varies accord¬
ing to sex, diet, area and economic
status. A disease may also lead to
different complications in different
settings; for example, the main
consequences of high blood pressure
are different in developing and highly
developed countries.
In most of the affluent societies of
the world, the level of arterial blood
pressure rises progressively with
increasing age, especially after 40.
Whether this is a normal pattern or
should be regarded as an environmen¬
tally induced disorder remains a source
of heated discussion. Studies of the
aging process in developing countries
may answer this question.

AG. SHAPER was formerly WHO Research
Professor at the Department of Medicine,
Makerere University College, Kampala,
Uganda. At present he Is working at the
Medical Research Council's Social Medicine
Unit, at the London School of Hygiene and
Tropical Medicine, England.
ZDENEK FEJFAR is Head of the World
Health Organization's Cardiovascular Dis¬
eases Unit, Geneva (see page 5).
The Medical Research Unit in Wel¬
lington, New Zealand, has investigated
several groups of Polynesians. The
population of Pukapuka (Cook Island)
does not show the usual rise of blood
pressure with increasing age, but other
groups of genetically similar Poly¬
nesians, now exposed to the modern
affluent way of life, do; their blood
pressure rises with age; arterial hyper¬
tension and complications are not un¬
common.
Among the Maoris of New Zealand,
the prevalence of hypertension is high
and is still rising, while among the
Europeans in New Zealand it has been
falling; hypertension in the Maoris is
frequently associated with a tendency
towards gout. Tantalizing as these
clues are, their true signifiance has
yet to be determined.
The peoples of northern Kenya, the
Samburu and the Rendille, lead a
nomadic existence with their herds of
cattle, camels, sheep and goats; they
also show no increase in blood pres¬
sure levels with increasing age.
Studies carried out by the World
Health Organization Cardiovascular
Research and Training Centre in Kam¬
pala, Uganda, have shown that young
men from these tribes who join the
Kenya army show a significant increase
in blood pressure in their second year
of service.
One of the many changes associated
with their transition from a nomadic life
to the disciplined existence of the army
is a considerable increase in salt
intake, although other dietary changes
and such factors as environmental
stress may also play a part.
In the affluent countries it seems
that people with high blood pressure
are more likely to develop disease
of the arteries and coronary heart
disease. In the tropical countries,
although long-standing and severe
hypertension results in brain damage,
heart enlargement and heart failure, or
in kidney damage and kidney failure,
severe atherosclerosis and coronary
heart disease virtually do not occur.
A similar situation has been observ¬
ed in China, Japan and Mongolia, as
well as in many tropical countries, and
shows that hypertension should be
regarded as an aggravating factor
in the development of coronary
heart disease and not as a basic
cause. There is clearly a tremendous
need to study the natural history of
hypertension in populations not prone
to severe atherosclerosis.
The usual cause of the reduced
blood supply is atherosclerosis of the
coronary arteries, a process which
leads to narrowing and distortion of
the blood vessels. A sudden obstruc¬
tion in one of these arteries will result
in damage to the heart muscle which
it supplies; this is acute myocardial
infarction, often called by the general
term "heart attack". It is the most
common heart disease in adult man
in all affluent societies.
Yet heart attack is rare in develop¬
ing countries, with the apparent excep¬
tion of small groups of people with
a high level of responsibility and socio¬
economic advantage.
In the affluent societies, cigarette
smoking, hypertension, diabetes melli¬
tus, obesity and sedentary occupations
are factors known to be associated
with the development of coronary heart
disease, yet these factors do not pro¬
duce coronary atherosclerosis and
coronary heart disease in the "average
man" in the developing countries.
This is true even for middle-aged
persons with long-standing hyper¬
tension, diabetes mellitus, obesity and
sedentary occupations! The reasons
are as yet not quite clear but there is
a strong suggestion that all these "risk
factors" are only aggravating factors
which accelerate the development of
atherosclerosis and its complications
in communities already prone to this
disease.
D
The relative importance of
dietary factors and of physical activity
patterns, which are perhaps expressed
in the low blood-fat levels of these
tropical communities with virtual free¬
dom from coronary heart disease, is
of considerable interest. Many claim
that the basic causes of coronary
heart disease cannot be adequately
studied in the communities which
suffer most from the disease because
all individuals are exposed. Hence the
usefulness of studying communities
relatively free from it.
Particularly rewarding studies cover
well-defined groups of people with
considerable differences in the preval¬
ence of coronary heart disease. For
example, in Kampala, Uganda, the

PYRAMID CLINIC
Rheumatic fever which can cause crippling
damage to the heart is a disease which
often strikes children. Thirty per cent
of adult cardiac diseases are due to
rheumatic fever contracted in childhood.
In the U.S.A., about one million heart
sufferers owe their ailment to this cause.
In Egypt, the Pyramid Clinic, built almost
in the shadow of the great pyramids near
Cairo (right) treats and rehabilitates children
suffering from disabilities of the heart
and joints caused by rheumatic fever. It
has already cared for some 10,000 children
and provides primary school teaching
and appropriate job training.
Chagas' heart disease is a threat to
35 million persons in Latin America, where
it causes many deaths. It affects an
estimated five million persons in Brazil and

WHO Centre has emphasized the strik¬
ing differences which are found in the
fibrinolytic (clot-dissolving) system of
subjects prone to coronary heart
disease compared with subjects who
are not. The African community in
Kampala have no coronary heart dis¬
ease, and at all ages have an active
system for the breakdown of blood
clots.
The Indian minority in Kampala,
with an incidence of coronary heart
disease similar to any "affluent" group,
have a very poor clot-dissolving sys¬
tem when they reach middle age (40-
60 years), and this inability to break
down blood clots is significantly
associated with body fatness, blood
cholesterol levels and a tendency to
diabetes. This may be a phenomenon
of fundamental importance in the
development of atherosclerosis and
coronary heart disease, and furnishes
another example of how the absence
of a disease in a community may lead
to the better understanding of the
mechanisms of the disease elsewhere.
Food habits may play an important
part in determining whether a com¬
munity does or does not suffer from
coronary heart disease.
In Singapore, where three-quarters
of the population are Chinese and one
quarter Malay and Indian, the Indian
section of the community, whose eating
habits are quite special, is the one
most commonly affected.
In Fiji, coronary heart disease is not
seen in the native Fijians, but is com
monly diagnosed
Indians.
among resident
In Ceylon, where coronary heart
disease is commonly diagnosed in
relatively poor people on low-fat diets,
considerable interest focuses on the
fact that, although the total amount of
fat consumed is low, it consists of
coconut oil, a substance similar in
certain ways to butter, i.e. highly
saturated.
Clearly the nutritional
peculanties of tropical countries are of
considerable concern to those involved
in unravelling the mysteries of athero¬
sclerosis and coronary heart disease.
A small proportion of those who
suffer from certain streptococcal throat
infections experience inflammation of
the heart and swelling of the joints
which may go unrecognized if symp¬
toms are not striking: this is acute
rheumatic fever. However, though the
acute phase soon passes, permanent
injury to the heart in the form of a
thickening of the heart valves may
result; this is chronic rheumatic heart
disease.
There has been a remarkable decline
in the incidence of rheumatic fever in
highly developed communities in recent
years through the treatment of strep¬
tococcal infections with sulphonamides
and penicillin. Moreover, preventive
regimens have considerably prolonged
the life of subjects with chronic rheu¬
matic heart disease, and surgical cor¬
rection of the valvular deformities has
become a well-established treatment.
In many developing countries, par¬
ticularly in the tropical and subtropical
regions, the reverse situation can be
seen. Severe rheumatic heart disease
is being recognized with increasing
frequency and it is the most wide¬
spread and serious chronic heart
disease in children and young adults.
Poor social and economic conditions,
inadequate hygienic and therapeutic
measures as well as increasing urban¬
ization appear to be far more impor¬
tant than climate. The high proportion
of children in the population and the
rapid progression from onset of the
disease to severe permanent damage
of the heart valves and irreversible
heart failure make this a serious
problem.
Tropical physicians "and pathologists
are familiar with the presence of
advanced rheumatic heart disease in
children below the age of ten, and
considerable evidence indicates that
the prevalence of chronic heart dis¬
ease is increasing in many tropical
countries.
Despite the frequency of chronic
rheumatic heart 'disease in the tropics
and sub-tropics, surprisingly little acute
rheumatic fever is diagnosed in these
areas. Surveys carried out by WHO
consultants suggest that the clinical
features of acute rheumatic fever may
be different in the tropical countries

and that the natural history of rheu¬
matic heart disease may be modified
by environmental factors.
It is widely accepted that acute
rheumatic fever is caused by strepto¬
coccal infection, usually manifested as
a sore throat, and that treatment of the
infection can prevent rheumatic fever.
A question which requires study in
the tropical situation is whether strep¬
tococcal skin infections, which are very
common and often precede acute
kidney disease, may also result in
rheumatic fever.
At the WHO seminar on cardio¬
vascular diseases due to infections,
held in Manila in November 1968, the
preventive aspects of rheumatic fever
and rheumatic heart disease were fully
discussed.
In Malaysia, Singapore, Cambodia,
Hong Kong, the Philippines, Australia
and New Guinea, there is a significant
amount of rheumatic fever and partic¬
ularly rheumatic heart disease. The
severity of streptococcal infection and
the degree of the immune response to
streptococci are factors influencing a
high rheumatic disease incidence.
Reports from countries in the west¬
ern Pacific region showed a wide
range in the magnitude of the problem;
according to some reports, the situa¬
tion may be considered under control,
for example among the European
population of Australia and New Zea¬
land; elsewhere a severe problem is
recognized, for example in the Philip¬
pines, Hong Kong and Singapore.
Persons who have recovered from
an attack of rheumatic fever remain
susceptible throughout their lives and
thus require continual medical super¬
vision. However, if their infections are
promptly treated with antibiotics,
serious damage to the heart can be
prevented.
In most of the western Pacific
region, existing health services are
able to dispense long-acting penicillin
to those already suffering from rheum¬
atic fever in order to prevent serious
relapse and heart damage. But the
main obstacles to actually doing it are
lack of a clearly defined programme,
the lack of free medicine, and lack of
public awareness.
Of the many parasites which may
damage the heart, the most serious is
Trypanosoma cruzi which is respon¬
sible for Chagas' heart disease. Car¬
los Chagas, a Brazilian physician, des¬
cribed this condition for the first time
in 1909 as being common in central
Brazil although the disease had been
locally recognized in many regions
well before this time.
Chagas' heart disease can be
regarded as one of the plagues in
several countries of Latin America and
there are areas in which as much as
half of the population is infected. The
parasite is transmitted to man by a
biting bug; the acute phase of the
illness occurs within two weeks of
the entry of the parasite.
Apart from fever and typical signs at
the site of entry of the parasite, there
may be acute myocarditis (inflamma¬
tion of the heart muscle) with enlarge¬
ment of the heart and heart failure.
In most cases, this phase passes un¬
recognized and the first symptoms
appear many years later when the
damage has been done and the disease
has become chronic. Although the
heart is the most frequently damaged
organ, in some endemic areas, partic¬
ularly in Argentina and Brazil, charac¬
teristic disturbances in the digestive
tract are also common.
The basic problem of chronic Cha¬
gas' heart disease is a disturbance in
the conduction system of the electrical
impulses which are responsible for the
harmonious pumping activity of the
heart. Various types of rhythm irreg¬
ularities and even interruption of
impulse conduction and heart block
are common, and may lead to stop¬
page of the heart beat in an apparently
healthy subject. In other subjects,
damage to the heart muscle is gradual
and progressive, sometimes resulting
in decreased pumping ability of the
heart and enormous dilatation, and
ending in heart failure.
There is no specific treatment for
Chagas' heart disease. Prevention,
however, is possible by interrupting
the transmission of the parasite by the
proper use of insecticides and espe¬
cially by the improvement of housing
and living conditions. These are vital
tasks for the public health authorities
in the endemic areas.

a small town several hundred kilo¬

Göteborg as a young man. Sven's
formal education stopped at the age
of 14. Both his parents died young,
and Sven was forced to go to work
before he had completed his second¬
ary school education.
GDSTA TIBBLIN Is Director of the Preven¬

RESULTS
OF AN INQUIRY
IN SWEDEN
Sven is a heavy smoker. His excess¬
ive drinking is the cause of constant
domestic difficulties. It has also been
responsible for trouble at work.
A few months ago, Sven had a heart
attack at the factory and was taken to
the hospital. A thorough physical
examination showed that his heart was
enlarged and that his vital capacity, or
lung function, was lower than it should
be. He was also suffering from
breathlessness and chronic bronchitis.
Certain blood lipids, such as serum
cholesterol and triglycerides, were
higher than normal.
Sven Johnsson is not a real person.
He is a composite drawn from a study
of cardiovascular patients. The investi
gation covered 843 men living in Göte¬
borg, which is a good place to do
such a study as the population is
stable, and accurate records make the
statistician's task easier.
Since we already knew that the risk
of heart attack increases with age, we
chose only middle-aged men born the
same year, 1913. When the study
began in 1963, none of them had any
signs of heart trouble, but by 1971,
some 36 had had heart attacks.
Their backgrounds disclosed several
common denominators, all described in
the portrait of Sven Johnsson. Smok¬
ing and alcohol problems were risk
factors which cropped up most often.

is continuing, is only part of a large-
scale programme for cardiovascular
disease control in Göteborg. The
second part is an attempt to prevent
ischaemic or coronary heart disease.
Some 10,000 men aged between 45 and
55 were chosen at random to receive
preventive treatment. The treatment
is designed to reduce three of the risk
factors high cholesterol, high blood-
pressure and smoking. Another 20,000
men were selected as controls and
given no treatment.
The 10,000 risk factor subjects are
treated at the Section of Preventive
Cardiology at Sahlgren's Hospital,
which serves the whole of Göteborg.
The anti-smoking part of the pro¬
gramme is still in the development
stage, but after three months of
treatment 40 per cent of the par¬
ticipants stopped smoking completely.
Those who have difficulty giving up
the habit come to information sessions
and group meetings. They are some¬
times given individual treatment as
well. Chewing-gum flavoured with
nicotine is sometimes helpful as a
physical aid.
Among the patients receiving treat¬
ment for hypertension, or high blood-
pressure, some drop out after a while.
Here again certain common social and
emotional factors are present. The
patient who drops out has usually dis¬
covered only recently that he has
hypertension. He has less education
than the others, and a lower income.
We have tried to reduce the drop¬
out rate by developing a special pro¬
gramme for these newly detected
cases. It begins with a slide-session
and a tape that describes what hyper¬
tension is and what can be done about
Göteborg, Sweden's second largest city,
has carried out a major study of
cardiovascular disease since 1963. At
the city's Sahlgren Hospital, some 10,000 men
aged between 45 and 55 are given special
treatment aimed to reduce three risk
factors of heart disease high cholesterol,
high blood pressure and smoking (details
in article this page). Left, a physiotherapist
at the hospital studies the reactions of
heart patients to physical exercise.
it. General discussion follows, with
questions encouraged. Later, the
patients are called in at regular inter¬
vals for re-examination and follow-up
visits, to stimulate attendance for
treatment while prevention is . still
possible. A good physician-patient
relationship is important, so we try-
to make sure that these "doubtful"
patients always see the same doctor.
All cases of heart attack and stroke
that occur in Göteborg are reported
and entered in a register, so by compar¬
ing the register with our records we
can tell whether these cases have
received preventive treatment. In
about four or five years, we should
learn how much of an influence our
preventive efforts have had.
Meanwhile, we are trying to improve
after-care for people who already have
myocardial infarction. When the pro¬
gramme began in 1967 we discovered
that care after patients left hospital
was very uneven. Some were receiv¬
ing intensive and specialized physical
training, but others nothing at all. Just
as many patients died in the first year
after an attack as died in hospital at
the time.
Coronary care units using
new techniques have greatly increas¬
ed survival chances for heart attack
patients. By giving regular check-ups
and supervision after their release
from hospital, we hope to improve
these chances still further.
When we first set up the infarction
clinic, we had to limit it to patients
under 55 years of age at the time of
their attack, but now we cover all
those under 67. We leave the actual
treatment in hospital to the doctors
there, and take over when the patient
goes home. Apart from regular phy¬
sical check-ups, psychological and
social factors are of the utmost impor¬
tance in the recovery phase, and we
have to educate the patient's family
as well as the patient.
The staff of the infarction clinic
includes a psychiatrist and two psy¬
chologists. Patients are invited to
bring their wives or husbands to dis¬
cuss their condition. We explain the
treatment of complications and point
out the risks which could lead to
another attack. All these patients
were originally smokers. Half of them
stop smoking completely a year after
they begin treatment.
Nearly 1,000 patients are in follow-
up treatment at the infarction clinic.
Many of them do supervised exercises
which help us to judge the right time
for them to return to work. When a
patient knows his physical capacity
and how he can best make use of it,
he gains in reassurance and con¬
fidence. Then he can gradually return
to an active life, at work and in his
leisure hours. The results so far indi¬
cate that patients who persevere with
physical training lead a healthier life.
Survival rates can be improved if
patients know the warning signs of
infarction. Many people die suddenly
from ischaemic heart disease outside
hospital. Most have signs of previous
infarction or have had chest symptoms
a week before their death. These
symptoms should have been recogniz¬
ed as early warning signals. Patients
who have had one infarction, and their
relatives, must watch out for any
recurrence of symptoms so that action
can be taken in time.
Hypertension is a frequent early
warning sign. Five per cent of the
population over 50 are hypertensive.
Early recognition of high blood-pres¬
sure is the most promising of all
preventive aids at our disposal.
A modern health service is expen¬
sive and must be efficient. The cardio¬
vascular programme in Göteborg
offers a chance to compare costs and
benefits of the various forms of care
we provide, and to find the answers
to many questions. How many inten¬
sive coronary care units and infarction
out-patient clinics do we need? How
many can we afford? What is the
value of primary as compared with
secondary preventive care? Does
health education save lives? When we
know these things we shall be able OQ
to provide an improved service to »CU
heart patients, and give many people
a longer lease of life.

DOES HIGH STANDARD OF
EQUAL HIGH RATE OF
by Dan Behrman
A high standard of living
can mean a high rate of death from
heart disease. Not only that, but
"labour-saving" occupations are not
necessarily life-saving.
These are the conclusions that one
is tempted to draw from the recently-
published results of a study on how
heart attacks strike a county in the
southern United States. They shed a
glimmer of light on the problem of
coronary heart disease that is, myo¬
cardial infarction and angina pectoris
as a companion to highly-developed
societies.
The story of the study goes back
more than ten years when Dr. Curtis
G. Hames, a general practitioner in
Evans County, Georgia, observed that
his black patients appeared to suffer
coronary heart attacks much less fre¬
quently than whites, even though Evans
County lies in the so-called "coronary
belt" of the United States running from
Virginia through Georgia.
He was not the first to make such
an observation. Other physicians had
noted the apparent immunity of blacks
to coronaries and had attributed it to
racial differences. But Hames' cur¬
iosity drove him further.
As he reported in Archives of
Internal Medicine, recently published

Oceans" (Little Brown and Co., Boston,
U.S.A.), also recently published in a paper¬
back edition.
by the American Medical Association,
it led to a community study of Evans
County with support from the Amer¬
ican government and the nearby Uni¬
versity of North Carolina.
Evans County must be a quiet place,
judging from .what the Archives of
Internal Medicine says about it. It
lies sixty miles inland from the Atlan¬
tic Ocean on a coastal plain of red
clay and sandy soil. Pine forests
ramble over much of its area (at its
greatest diameter, the county mea¬
sures 19 miles). Not much industry to
speak of, there's a sewing factory giv¬
ing jobs to 500 and another plant that
makes. . . fruitcake.
In 1960, when the study began, the
population of Evans County was 6,952
and, by 1970, it had gone. up to only
7,290. Obviously a stable community,
and a good one for a long-term health
study. Two-thirds of the population
live in completely rural surroundings.
Two-thirds, too, are white and one-
third black.
During an 18-monlh period between
1960 and 1962, every Evans County
resident over the age of 40 and half
the residents between 15 and 39 were
given complete physical examinations,
3,102 in all.
These examinations bore out what
Dr. Hames had noticed. Coronary
heart disease was a rarity for black
men, it hit them only half as often as
it did whites. But the study brought
out a new factor: whites on the bottom
half of the social ladder were not
being affected any more than blacks.
Summarizing the findings in the
Archives, Dr. John C. Cassel, of the
University of North Carolina, comment¬
ed that they could not be attributed
to other factors such as blood pres¬
sure, blood cholesterol levels, cigarette
smoking, body weight or diet.
But the state of a man's heart
appeared to be linked to what he did
for a living or, in Dr. Cassel's words,
"these occupational differences sug¬
gested that possibly physical activity
exerted a protective effect and that
variations in the level of physical act¬
ivity between the various ethnic and
social class groups accounted, at least
in part, for the difference in their
rates."
This looked promising, but not after
a first glance at the results of a follow-
up study made between 1967 and 1969
covering nearly 99 per. cent of those
who had been originally examined.
This study showed that vulnerability
to coronary heart diseases was now
affecting nearly all whites equally. The
doctors reasoned that the younger
men on the bottom were under greater
pressure in any case, their blood
pressure was greater because they
were climbing up.
Yet the difference between blacks
and whites persisted during the follow-
up study. Was it then a matter of
race after all? Researchers looked
hard at the figures. They saw that, as
Dr. Cassel wrote, "the only circum¬
stance in which white men had as low
rates as blacks was when they were
both sharecroppers." He added that
the only difference between white
sharecroppers and other white men
was that they had to work a lot harder
physically, as hard as black share¬
croppers do.
White or black, a share¬
cropper does a hard day's work. A
visitor to one Evans County farm
reported that the tenant was up before
the sun. He ate a big breakfast bacon
and eggs fried in hot lard (enough to
make some people die just at the mere
thought of so much animal fat), coffee
and bread then he and his wife went
out to work. At seven in the morning,
they were caring for some 30,000 baby
chickens on the farm.
When they stopped for lunch, they
filled up on starches and carbohydra¬
tes a stew of cheap beef, rice and
turnip greens. Then back to work until
after six, more fats and starches for
supper, and an evening around the
television set.
The visitor also reported that this
sharecropper chews tobacco, takes a
drink of whisky from time to time, but
never takes a vacation. Yet his chan¬
ces of developing coronary # heart
disease after the age of 40 are less
than a third as high (31 per 1,000 dur¬
ing the 1960-62 period) as those of a
professional man or a top executive
earning $20,000 a year, enjoying a
three-week vacation, but sitting at a
desk all day long. In that bracket, the
coronary rate was 96 per 1,000.
The mere virtues of rural living do
not explain the difference, for the white
farm owner was almost as vulnerable
to heart attack as the city executive.
Dr.- Cassel, the professor, turned to
Dr. Hames, the family doctor, for an
explanation and this is what he was
told.
The men who had been labelled high

social class, while living in a rural
environment were in fact living a very
"urban" way of life.
In contrast to their fathers, they were
not living by the sun but by the clock;
they were commuting to work in small
industries, their wives were driving in
car pools, and even if they were farm
owners, they were no longer private
entrepreneurs but "employees" of
some larger company.
Further there was some evidence
that an increasing proportion of white
men in Evans County, even those
labelled low social class, were begin¬
ning to participate in this 20th-century
urban "way of life" as the county was
rapidly changing from a rural agrarian
to a more industrialized economy.
However, it would be a mistake to
take the results of the Evans County
study as a plea for poverty (in fact,
it isn't the unemployed, the poorest
of all, got more heart attacks than the
sharecroppers) or a plea for a high-
starch diet.
What it does seem to show is, as
Dr. Cassel says, that physical activity
is a protection against coronary heart
disease, but only above some
"threshold value" which is exceeded
by farmers and particularly sharecrop¬
pers, white and black. Physical activity
increases the diameter of the blood
vessels in the heart and this is a
"plausible biological explanation" for
its role, state the Evans County
researchers.
They are less certain about where
this "threshold value" lies, a subject
of great controversy in the medical
profession. Studies made elsewhere
do not settle it. In one factory in a
large American city, active workers
suffered from coronary heart disease
just as much as their sedentary
colleagues, even though they were
expending over 50 per cent more
calories.
In Evans County, the study also
showed that social instability seemed
to go hand-in-hand with vulnerability
to coronarles. In the lowest social
classes, men were more likely to get
heart attacks if they were moving
upward than if they were stable.
However, In the higher brackets, it
was those up above who seemed to
be less in danger.
It may be that in both cases,
whether stable on the very top or the
very bottom of the social and economic
ladder, a man knows exactly where he
stands and worries less about where
he is going. But that is only a
guess. . .

A daily dozen
a day to keep
cardiologists
away
by Emgeni I. Chazov
A study carried
out on men aged from 50 to
59 by the Myasnikov Institute
of Cardiology, in Moscow,
shows that one man in five
suffers frcm coronary heart
disease and nearly one in
four has high blood pressure
(hypertension).
It also reveals that these
diseases now occur more fre¬
quently in. younger persons.
Deaths from cardiovascular dis¬
eases in men aged from 35 to
44 have risen sharply, and a
serious increase is noted in
even younger, men.
According to the Myasnikov
Institute, which collaborates
with the World Health Organi¬
zation as a cardiovascular
research centre, atherosclerotic
changes In the vessejs of the
heart and aorta are also on
the increase among younger
persons.
This finding Is. borne out by
research at Riga (Latvia) where
doctors investigating the deaths
of persons between the ages
of 30 and 39 who had suffered
from atherosclerosis found that
on the average 22 per cent of
the internal surface of the ab¬
dominal aorta was - affected
by the disease.
This disease, however, be¬
comes far more serious after
the age of 40 and complications
such as heart attacks and
strokes may well occur.
Observations have revealed
two important factors: where
one lives and how one lives.
EVGENI I. CHAZOV is a cor¬
responding Member of the
U.S.S.R. Academy of Medical
Sciences. In 1969, he was
awarded a State Prize for devel¬
oping new methods of treatment
for coronary heart disease. He
is the author of many publica¬
tions and research studies on
the problems of cardiovascular
disease. Prof. Chazov, who is
41 years old, Is now Deputy
Minister of Public Health of the
U.S.S.R.
While 2.2 per cent of workers
over the age of 40 In Moscow
fall victims to heart attacks, the
figure for a comparable group
of workers in Ufa, in the
southern Urals, Is only 0.6 per
cent. This suggests that the
faster pace and different pattern
of life In the capital may
increase vulnerability to heart
attacks.
Current research in the
U.S.S.R. points to the influence
of certain environmental fac¬
tors on the appearance and
development of several dis¬
eases of the heart In many
rural areas, hypertension is
found only half as often as in
the towns. In some parts of
eastern Siberia, for example,
angina pectoris among smokers
over the age of 30 was observ¬
ed in 27 persons out of 1,000,
whereas in non-smokers of the
same age group the proportion
was only 16 per thousand.
In some parts of Uzbekistan,
the frequency of coronary heart
disease among local people
who eat vegetable fats has
been compared with that among
immigrants who eat mainly ani¬
mal fats. Among local men
over the age of 30, only 3.2 per
cent had coronary atheroscle¬
rosis; among the immigrants the
percentage was 8.8 per cent.
Occupation seems also to
play a part In the appearance
of coronary disease and heart
attacks. Among technical en¬
gineering personnel, the rate Is
twice that of workers whose
jobs apparently cause less
mental strain. This situation,
however, is changing, since
nowadays jobs tend to be¬
come more and more complex
and often lead to increased
nervous tension.
The Importance of mental
factors has been confirmed
many times. Among 200,000
workers and employees In Mos¬
cow, high blood pressure was
found most frequently among
workshop engineers, foremen,
dispatchers and technicians, of
whom 7.2 per cent were affect-

ed. The next group consisted
of engineering constructors,
workers in the technical control
sectors and accountants, of
whom 6.2 per cent were
affected.
High blood pressure often
occurs among workers exposed
to excessive noise, vibrations
or other unfavourable con¬
ditions. For example, the per¬
centage of cases of high blood
pressure was 6.9 among
polishers, and 5.7 among elec¬
trical fitters. The disease is
also common among bus and
taxi drivers.
Among women, high blood
pressure is frequent among
telephonists and telegraphists,
who work "under pressure".
It is less frequent among
women in textile factories.
Studies carried out in eastern
Siberia, where very strong
liquor is drunk, and in Georgia,
where dry wines are mainly
consumed, have shown no rela¬
tionship between the occurrence
of coronary atherosclerosis or
ischaemic heart disease and
the consumption of alcohol,
although alcohol undoubtedly
plays a part in the appearance
of cardiac insufficiency.
The tendency to have heart
attacks at an earlier age is
found in many countries. The
explanation may be that athero¬
sclerosis of the coronary
arteries starts to develop now¬
adays much earlier. This, in
turn relates to a number of
factors: reduced physical acti¬
vity, dietary changes and
greater emotional strain brought
about by technological dev¬
elopment and the frantic tempo
of modern life.
The part played by stress in
heart attacks is particularly
obvious. At the Myasnikov Ins¬
titute of Cardiology, we studied
the events that led up to the
heart attack in many of our
patients. The attack was imme¬
diately preceded in 20.5 per
cent of cases by an acute emo¬
tional shock; in 35 per cent by
a state of emotional tension
lasting several days; in 30 per
cent by prolonged overwork;
but in only 4.5 per cent by a
physical effort.
Preventive measures go
beyond the purely medical
framework and are very lar¬
gely social in character. The
U.S.S.R. has a large network
of treatment centres, spas and
rest homes, organizations for
'physical culture and travel
associations. Special attention
is also given to the improve¬
ment of environmental health,
the promotion of balanced diets
and similar measures.
Physical culture organizations
have a membership of some
50 million, including not only
young people, but many of
middle and even advanced age.
Some eight million persons
come to State centres for
rest, preventive examinations
and treatment
Another institution which
plays an Important part is the
preventorium In Industry. For
a month or a month and a
half, manual and office workers
may spend time there after
work under the supervision of
doctors who test their blood
pressure, carry out laboratory
analyses and prescribe treat¬
ment diets or gymnastics.
In this way, preventive
therapy gymnastics, the im¬
provement of sleeping habits
or of diet can be carried out
without the worker having to
interrupt his job. There are
many such preventoriums in
the U.S.S.R.; at present they
have over 100,000 beds.
We are very much against
the sort of life in which the
individual, after an eight-hour
working day, takes refuge in
trashy books, or stretches out
on a sofa in front of the tele¬
vision set, or sits drinking with
friends.
A passive, sedentary life,
totally lacking in any creative
effort, in physical activity or
intellectual stimulation, is at
the origin of disturbances in
the metabolism of fats and
carbohydrates, and leads to fur¬
ther disturbances in the ner¬
vous system. In this way,
conditions are created for the
development of atherosclerosis,
coronary insufficiency and vas¬
cular spasms.
Sleeping long enough Is an¬
other important point Sleep
should be part of a well-
regulated life, and not the
result of taking sleeping pills.
We attach great importance
to human relationships, to
character formation, and to
education in the widest sense
of the term. The spirit of com¬
radeship, tact discretion, self-
control and respect for others
are not merely moral obliga¬
tions, but are fundamental for
the education of a healthy
generation. They are also
important in the prevention of
cardiovascular diseases.
Education in this sense should
start at school. It is important
that children should be taught
to master their emotions.
In the prevention of heart
diseases, an important role can
be played by health education,
and special scientific research
institutes have been created in
the U.S.S.R. for this purpose.
In conclusion, a word about
heart transplantations. It is
obvious that such operations
illustrate the remarkable possi¬
bilities of modern medicine.
Yet there is no doubt that
heart transplants cannot provide
any broad solution to the prob¬
lem of cardiovascular diseases.
Frankly, I believe that the
search for methods to prevent
atherosclerosis, heart attacks
or high blood pressure offer
greater promise than 100 or
even 1,000 brilliantly successful
heart transplants.

'STETHOSCOPE'
By linking an X-Ray machine with a computer, American medical
research workers have devised a new, experimental diagnostic tool
that will enable doctors to "see" a patient's heart-beat.
The X-Rays pick up the traces of a special contrast fluid
previously injected into the heart and the computer re-constitutes

We present below a forecast on heart disease
and vascular diseases in the 1990s their preven¬
tion, diagnosis and treatment. The forecast is
adapted from a broad analysis produced by the
Office of Health Economics in London. The full
study, carried out under the supervision of its
Director, George Teeling-Smith, ranges over many
branches of medicine from allergic disorders and
cancer to mental illness and virus infections. On
page 30, the Soviet cardiologist. Prof. Igor Shkhvat-
sabaya. Director of the Myasnikov Cardiological
Institute, in Moscow, comments on these forecasts.
Coronary
heart disease
preventing coronary heart disease by
most of the currently mooted methods
will at least have been thoroughly
explored.
BLOOD LIPIDS (fats). The effec¬
tiveness of one important cholesterol-
lowering medicine will be known by
1975. A definitive answer concerning
the benefits to be obtained from
dietary changes affecting blood lipids
will not be available before 1980, if
then. There is a very strong and
fairly general expectation that lower
blood lipid levels are more likely to
be achieved by medicines than by
dietary changes. By 1975, we should
have medicines to decrease the body's
absorption or synthesis of lipo¬
proteins. Whatever means of affecting
blood lipids is adopted, a screening
process, probably including young
adults and children, will identify those
with abnormal blood levels.
HIGH BLOOD PRESSURE. The
results of various trials will soon result
in routine screening being offered. By
1980, people will probably be given
a blood pressure screening every year,
possibly even by self-measurement.
Safe and effective medicines for the
control of a high blood pressure will
be available, perhaps given in fixed-
dose regimens.
Some five to ten per cent of the
middle-aged men screened will be
found to need lipid control; some two
per cent of middle-aged and old
people screened will need control of
blood pressure. It is estimated, how¬
ever, that only 50 per cent of those
needing such controls will adopt and
persevere with treatment. In addition,
some 25 per cent of persons who have
had an attack of coronary heart
disease will receive treatment aimed
at reducing blood lipid levels.
DIABETES. The association of
diabetes with coronary heart disease
(and with strokes and disease of the
limb arteries) is already established,
and by 1975, trials will have proved
the value of anti-diabetic treatment in
preventing the occurrence of these
diseases in borderline diabetics. Once
such proof is available, then, as with
high blood lipid levels and a raised
blood pressure, widespread preventive
measures will be undertaken.
OBESITY. The treatment of obesity
is already regarded as a medical task,
and medicines which effectively "burn
off" excess calories without other un
desirable side effects should soon be
available. This approach is more likely
to be effective than educational
measures to improve dietary habits.
CIGARETTE SMOKING. Present
evidence incriminating cigarette smok¬
ing will be stronger by 1975 and, by
1990, cigarette consumption, at least
in high-risk subjects, may be only
50 per cent of present levels.
OTHER RISK FACTORS. Other
known or suggested risk factors
include lack of exercise, an inherited
tendency to the disease, and stress;
these may be less amenable to control.
To combat stress there may be ways
of controlling the heart action, when
necessary, so that emotional over¬
loading does not occur.
EARLY TREATMENT. In order to
combat the very high mortality in the
first hour after coronary thrombosis,
a form of treatment may be developed
that could be used immediately the
patient is seen by his family doctor,
or possibly even by the patient himself
as soon as he had a symptom suggest¬
ing an attack. This would give pro¬
tection for some hours against the
dangerous disturbances of the heart's
rhythm that commonly occur in this
condition. If the patient is to be able
to apply the treatment himself, it would
have to be extremely safe, since it
would often be mistakenly used for
minor conditions.
CONTROL OF SHOCK. Better
blood plasma substitutes and better
pharmaceutical control of shock will
also help in the treatment of the
disease once it has gained a footing,
as will electrical pacing of the heart.
These advances will come mostly from
the experience gained in intensive
coronary care units which will continue
for some years but which may, if
safe efficient therapy can be derived,
be a passing phase.
ANGINA PECTORIS (a condition
allied in various ways to coronary
thrombosis). More effective, long-
acting preparations, which might
improve the blood supply to the heart
muscle, and medicines designed to
prevent anginal attacks while not
depressing the heart muscle will both
be developed by 1975.
NEW MEDICINES FORECAST. By
1975, new medicines should be
available to increase the blood's
ability to dissolve the fibrin of blood
clots. On the other hand, there Is
probably a less promising future for
anti-coagulant medicines. Other new
medicines forecast include some that
will increase the strength of con
traction of the heart muscle while not
affecting the heart's rhythm adversely,
and new diuretics (medicines that
stimulate urination) suitable for cases
resistant to present diuretics or less
liable to cause a loss of potassium
from the body. Myocardial infarction
will probably be treated by direct
injection through the skin into the
heart of tissue culture extracts
containing capillary vessel buds and
growth-stimulating substances making
revascularization surgery unnecessary.
SURGERY. In a small proportion
of the very large number of cases
surgery will still be needed. Artificial
hearts should be perfected by 1990
and may replace human and animal
transplants because of availability.
Some experts believe that pig hearts
will be increasingly used for heart
transplantation, the specially bred pigs
being "immunized" beforehand against
a rejection of their hearts by the
human recipients.
PREDICTION AND PREVENTION.
By 1990, it should be possible to
predict which people are going to have
an attack of coronary thrombosis
within a matter of days and to minimize
their chances of dying from a sudden
disturbance of heart action. Great
advances should be made in cardio¬
logical diagnosis. This should make
it possible to carry out automated
predictive studies, for example at
three-monthly intervals. These could
indicate whether the heart was per¬
forming easily or haltingly. Even if
this particular approach does not
prove successful, it should bring
benefits by re-orienting the medical
profession to a predictive approach
to heart disease. There is dis¬
agreement as to the effect of the
various preventive measures on the
incidence and mortality of coronary
heart disease; the forecasts range
from "an important fall" to no very
marked change in the national
coronary mortality rate despite all
the methods of prevention adopted.
Vascular diseases
The problems of vascular disease
are in many ways similar to those of
heart disease.
HYPERTENSION. Substantial pro¬
gress cannot be expected until there
is a better understanding of the under¬
lying mechanisms of vascular changes
and the causes of hypertension (high
blood pressure). This is likely to m in
come within ten years. It should then JjX
be possible to use naturally occurring *
hypotensive agents to control hyper¬
tension. Immediate advances in vas-

cular diseases will depend on better
peripheral vascular diagnostic proced¬
ures, probably based on ultra-sonic
techniques.
TRACE ELEMENTS. Another possible
form of progress will be the identi¬
fication of trace metals and other
"micro-nutrients" whose absence may
be responsible for vascular damage.
Once these are identified, and tests
have been developed to indicate their
presence, replacement therapy should
be possible for individuals in whom
they are lacking. This may be avail¬
able by 1975 or 1980. A better under¬
standing of the general aging process
and its effect on the blood vessels
should be achieved by 1990.
ENVIRONMENTAL FACTORS. It is
also likely that other environmental
causative agents will be identified and
(as with smoking at present) the
challenge will be to change national
habits to reduce exposure to such
causes.
SURGERY. In the immediate future,
surgical techniques will improve, and
lasers, for instance, will be used to
burn away diseased tissue. The next
step forward will be in the field of
vascular replacement, first with grafts
from humans and then with grafts from
animal banks and finally with grafts
from tissue culture extracts such as
chick-embryo growth extract mixed
with vascular buds which will be devel¬
oped from a small piece of specially
treated patient's tissue.
THROMBOSIS. Early in the 1970s,
"thrombo-prophylaxis" should be pos
sible by separating anti-thrombotic and
anti-coagulant properties. Specific
fibrin-dissolving enzymes should be
available to prevent thrombus (blood
clot) formation.
HIGH-RISK SUBJECTS. There will
remain the problem of identifying
high-risk individuals and pre-sympto-
matic cases and getting social
acceptance for large-scale preventive
medication in these individuals. This
need for early identification of vas¬
cular or blood changes is particularly
important, first because many acute
bouts of vascular disease are rapidly
fatal and second because the changes
which have occurred by the time symp¬
toms appear are often irreversible.
Specifically, the brain damage caused
by a vascular catastrophe will still be
untreatable by 1990.
Conclusion
The pessimistic view is that the
conquest of many diseases of middle-
age (and particularly coronary heart
disease) will leave growing numbers to
suffer in old age from progressively
destructive vascular disorders and de¬
terioration of their nervous system.
The more optimistic view is that des¬
pite the great difficulties the causes of
vascular disorders also will be under¬
stood, and that the medical profes¬
sion and the public will accept the con¬
sequent implications of early diagnosis
and long-term therapy for those at
risk. In this way vascular diseases
could be effectively controlled by the
1990s.
OUNCES OF PREVENTION
BY THE 21st CENTURY

One must obviously agree
with the experts' conclusion that
methods for preventing heart disease
will have been thoroughly explored
before the end of the century, and
that by 1975, or thereabouts, the
pharmaceutical industry will be pro¬
ducing medicines to lower the pro¬
portion of cholesterol in the blood.
Yet to my mind the experts
seem to have picked out isolated
facts from a series of different
discoveries, grouped them some¬
what arbitrarily, it seems to me and
then tried to sketch in, on that basis,
an overall picture of all future trends
in cardiology.
It seems likely, for instance, that
predictions about the use of grafts
from animals (heterografts) in human
heart-transplant operations will prove
to be unrealistic, though this does not
apply to partial transplants.
The experts' forecasts on smoking
also seem to me somewhat question¬
able.
A question worth examining is why
cardiovascular diseases are now the
leading cause of death in the world,
after having ousted cancer from that
unenviable position.
While there can be no simple
answer to this question, one thing
is obvious: the heart occupies a
unique place and function in the body.
It is the focal point of stress from
many forces. It reacts to the slightest
change in the body's environment
and is extremely sensitive to every
occurrence in daily life. Doctors ac¬
cordingly find it hard to master the
problems of heart disease.
In recent years, heart diseases have
"grown younger", as shown by the
increasing number of cases among
young persons. Changes in our way

are not alone a sufficient explanation
of this. Heart diseases are the result
of a whole series of influences acting
on man's organism.
Past experience has convinced
cardiologists that there is a very close
relationship between high blood
pressure (hypertension), deterioration
within the blood vessels (athero¬
sclerosis), and damage to the heart
due to a faulty supply of blood to the
heart muscles (ischaemic disease).
These processes are interconnected
and influence each other.
Hypertension actively provokes
atherosclerosis. Increased blood
pressure can lead to a heart attack.
And atherosclerosis may trigger the
development of hypertension.
This implies that by treating one
ailment we can affect the development
of another. It took cardiologists a
great deal of time and effort to reach
this simple conclusion. Yet this
"systems approach" is a vital factor
in forecasts concerning cardiovascular
diseases.
So before turning to prospects in
the fight against heart disease, I
would like to say a word on hyper¬
tension and its treatment in the future.
I think that by 1975 we shall be able
to stabilize the pathological process
of high blood pressure in many, if
not all cases. We can expect that
two or three years after such stabiliz¬
ation has been achieved, people
suffering from this disease will find that
their capacity to work has greatly
improved. There will be less need
for. hospital treatment, and far fewer
complications and fatal cases.
Forecasts offer even more hope to
people afflicted by the disease in its
early stages. Between five and seven
years from now,, if seems likely that
medicine, through a combination of
treatment and advice, will be able to
help innumerable victims of heart
ailments by bringing about a "reces¬
sion" of the disease and in some
cases curing it completely.
Over the next ten years doctors
will be able to fight "pre-disease"
more effectively; that is, they will
eliminate conditions leading to hyper¬
tension. Fifteen years ago this hardly
seemed possible. During the second
half of the 1950s medicine was only
taking its first steps towards an under¬
standing of the way arterial hyper¬
tension appears, and how it evolves.
New discoveries about the origin
and development of hypertension have
been made during the past ten years,
and fairly effective forms of treatment
have been developed. Doctors now
dispose of a varied arsenal of med¬
icines which have a very important
selective effect on the crucial links
in the progress of the disease.
Medical treatment is six to eight
times more effective nowadays than

it used to be, and the life expectancy
of patients has almost doubled. During
the next ten years we shall be able
to apply more new methods, with
mathematical models and computers
playing an important rôle.
In the more distant future, cyber¬
netic systems will be more widely
applied to safeguard public health.
They will enable health checks to be
made on a massive scale not only
among existing heart patients but also
for those who are prone to heart
disease. This means that by about
1990, "risk factors" will have been
reduced to a minimum. In some cases
they are likely to be completely elimin¬
ated and in others their effects will
be reduced.
One has to admit that atherosclerosis
is still an extremely serious problem
and, in my opinion, the situation will
not change for some time to come.
Indeed, medicine will need to con¬
centrate much of its effort in the
future on the fight against athero¬
sclerosis; the disease becomes more
acute and occurs more frequently
with advancing age, and every year
the number of persons reaching the
55-60 age group is increasing.
As is often the case in science, the
most urgent problem is also the
hardest one to solve. Yet the outlook
today is encouraging as is shown by
the methods of diagnosis now in use
and based on specially designed
instruments and bio-chemical tech¬
niques
Furthermore, medicines are now
available for correcting the faulty
metabolic processes that lead to
atherosclerosis. Doctors are able to
reduce fairly effectively the amount
of cholesterol and other fatty sub¬
stances in the blood. They can also
correct deteriorations in the exchange
processes of substances such as
carbohydrates and albumen, and they
can restore the correct degree of
permeability to the blood vessel walls.
Given the present pace of techn¬
ical progress and recent advances in
pharmacology, we should be winning
the fight against atherosclerosis by
about 1985 or 1990. But this will
require an enormous effort.
We can be even more hopeful and
optimistic as regards the problems
of defective coronary arteries and
heart attacks. A few years after
World War II, these diseases increas¬
ed considerably in the Soviet Union.
It is now clear that great progress
has been made during the past five
to seven years.
Deaths have fallen by almost half
and complications have also de¬
creased. Statistics show that some
80 per cent of all patients can resume
an active life during the first year
after the disease began. This should
surely encourage us to be optimistic
about the future.
By about 1980 the situation will
improve considerably. The most im¬
portant task is to find effective ways
of foreseeing and preventing heart
attacks. Statistics compiled by the
Institute of Cardiology of the U.S.S.R.
Academy of Medical Sciences show a
sharp reduction in cases of recurrent
heart attacks among patients who have
been under medical observation for
three years. The number of working
days lost has been nearly halved and
GEOGRAPHY OF HEART DISEASE (Continued from page 2D
32
At a meeting of the British Cardiac
Society held in Oxford in 1946.
Drs. Bedford and Konstam described a
most unusual form of heart failure in
African troops serving in Asia. The
soldiers were mostly from West Africa,
their average age was 20-30 years.
They were all cases of heart failure
and were found to have greatly
enlarged hearts. Seventeen of forty
patients under observations died and
came to autopsy. The description of
these hearts stimulated widespread
interest in unusual forms of heart
disease in the tropics.
In the more common forms of heart
disease, the heart's function is impair¬
ed by damaged valves, or by an in¬
creased load on the heart due to hyper¬
tension or disease of the coronary
arteries. There are, however, disorders
in which the main feature is a disease
of the heart muscle itself ; these
conditions are now widely known by
the collective term "cardiomyopathies".
Many of the hearts described by
Drs. Bedford and Konstam were of
this kind, and subsequent reports have
contributed greatly to the recognition
of heart-muscle disease in the rest
of the world.
In the more affluent societies, a
diseased heart muscle usually goes
with poor blood supply, and the true
cardiomyopathies have only recently
been sorted out from the coronary
heart diseases. Damage to the heart
muscle may be produced by a wide
variety of agents, some infective, some
toxic, and even by nutritional defi¬
ciencies, hormonal upsets and meta¬
bolic disorders. Frequently, however,
the cause of the damaged heart muscle
is uncertain or unknown.
Apart from alcohol, certain food
additives and preservatives are now
known to damage the heart muscle
cells. Outbreaks of cardiomyopathies
with high mortality have occurred
recently in heavy beer drinkers in
Canada. The beer had been treated with
cobalt and papain; such unforeseen
cardiac accidents are a warning of our
need for a deeper knowledge of the
normal mechanisms of the heart muscle
cells.
In comparison with the incidence of
rheumatic heart disease or arterial
hypertension, the cardiomyopathies
occur with relative infrequency,
although in some areas they are of
considerable importance. In Ibadan,
Nigeria, and among the African popu¬
lation of Johannesburg, South Africa,
about one-third of the patients with
clinical heart disease are considered
to have heart muscle disease, while in
Kampala, Uganda, only about 10 per
cent are included in this category.
At autopsy examination, about 4 per
cent of hearts in Kampala, Jamaica
and Japan have this form of cardio¬
myopathy, while in Cali, Colombia, it
runs as high as 12 per cent. Studies
in many parts of Africa, in South
America and in southeast Asia all indi
cate that unexplained enlarged hearts
are a significant health problem;
reports from Jamaica also point to a
high prevalence of cardiac enlarge¬
ment which is not due to coronary
artery disease.
Endomyocardial fibrosis (EMF), in
which a fibrous thickening constricts
the cavities of the heart, particularly
the ventricles, is a tropical cardiomyo¬
pathy in the true sense of the term;
its occurrence as an endemic problem
is confined to the tropical parts of the
world.
The disease has been intensively
studied in Nigeria, Uganda and other
countries within the tropical belt of the
African continent, and in southern
India, Ceylon, Malaysia, Brazil and
Colombia. The occurrence of EMF in
Europeans who have lived for long
periods in West Africa and the very
occasional report of EMF in subjects
who have never lived in or visited the
tropics are important clues whose
meaning has not yet by any means
been grasped.
The disease apparently begins in
childhood but by the time a diagnosis
is made, heart damage is usually
already serious and the patient is in
a state of heart failure. Predominantly a
disease of children and young adults,
it is found in all age groups. There is
no specific treatment beyond the
general management of heart failure
and, as the cause is unknown, pre¬
vention is not yet possible.

deaths have also considerably de¬
creased. Thus a heart attack with its
related complications is not necessary
fatal.
The most frequent cause of sudden
death is a serious disturbance of the
heart rhythm in the form of a rapid
twitching of the heart muscle cells,
when the contractions of the heart
virtually cease, thus arresting the
pumping action which causes the
blood to circulate.
Though at this point a state of
clinical death occurs, this can be
reversed if the disturbance in the
heart rhythm is eliminated in time
the aid of an electrical de¬
fibrillator. Most ambulances, hospitals,
clinics and health centres are now
equipped with this apparatus. By 1980
(or by 1985 according to more cautious
estimates) deaths from disturbances
of the heart's rhythm during a heart
attack will be exceptional.
Let us hope that in the 21st century,
cardiology will become simply a
branch of preventive medicine.
Igor K. Shkhvatsabaya
In many ways, EMF appears to have
a natural history similar to that of
rheumatic heart disease. Studies in
Kampala have also demonstrated a
very significant concurrence of EMF
and rheumatic heart disease in patients
on whom autopsies have been made.
This has lead to the hypothesis that
EMF may be a disorder similar to
rheumatic heart disease, another
hypersensitivity disorder of the heart.
Streptococcus, filariasis and malaria
may also be factors in the development
of this disease.
There is a scientific philosophy
according to which many problems of
the highly developed world can best
be solved away from the complexity
and confusion of modern industrial
societies; it may be as important to
study communities apparently free
from a disorder as those in which
almost everyone is prone to it.
As the preceding examples have
shown, there may be something in the
African or Asian diet, or way of life,
which has some protective influence
against the major killing heart diseases
of Europe and North America.
If the factor lacking in the one or
present in the other proves to be
decisive, then ways of preventing
some common causes of death will be
found. This type of comparative study
is a way in which mankind can make
use of its diversity for the common
good.

Drug-taking 'epidemic'
Drug abuse in many countries has
reached almost epidemic proportions and
is a danger to health and society, says the
International Narcotics Control Board in its
recent annual report. In a special warning
about cannabis ("a serious and growing
danger in many countries") the report says
that research shows that the effects of
cannabis consumption include "variation in
perception of time and space, disinhibition,
dulling of attention, fragmentation of thought
and an altered sense of identity."
Protecting
our cultural treasures
Proposals for an international convention
to safeguard the world's cultural and natural
heritage will be made to Unesco's General
Conference when it meets in October 1972.
The measures proposed will set inter¬
national standards for the protection of
monuments, groups of buildings and natural
sites and will outline national plans for
safeguarding cultural property.
Computerized museums
Local museums may soon be able to
call up on a screen images of exhibits in
museums all over the world, according to

aimed at setting up central banks of

years, reports WHO. Of the 236 new
schools, Brazil has opened 53, India, 40,
and U.S.A., 21.
The number of young people studying
abroad rose 300 per cent between 1950 l\l\
and 1968, when 430,000 students were JJ
taking full-time courses in other countries,
according to the recent Unesco study,
"Statistics of Students Abroad".

Letters to the Editor
THE FIRST HOSPITALS
Sir,
Your issue devoted to Iran (Oct. 1971)
featured an article entitled "The Scien¬
tific Legacy of Iran", by Desmond
Stewart, a British authority on Asian
cultures.
It says that one of the greatest
legacies left by the Persians in the field
of medicine is their conception of
hospitals. This statement Is not entirely
correct. H.G. Wells, In The Outline of
History, states that Asoka, Indian Bud¬
dhist Emperor, built hospitals both for
man and animals in the 3rd century.
There were courses in medicine in
Buddhist centres of learning and the
personal physician of the 4th century,
patricidal King Ajasatta of Magadha
(North India) sent him for higher studies
in medicine to the Wickremasela Budd¬
hist University in Ghandara (N.W. India).
Hospitals existed in Ceylon in the
3rd century B.C., and Buddhist temple
walls in Ceylon proudly depict a 2nd-
century Singhalese physician-king oper¬
ating on an ulcer of a poisonous snake,
after anaesthetizing it. These facts are
recorded in the Maha-wansa the great
Chronicle of Ceylon.
Therefore the earliest concept of
hospitals may be the product of both
Persian and Indo-Ceylonese influences,
or the latter may have preceded the
former as the incipient concept of
hospitals may te due to Buddhistic
inspiration, for the Buddha (6th century
B.C.), while nursing a sick monk, called
on his followers thus: "He who nurseth
the sick nurseth me". This is said to
have influenced Buddhist kings to build
hospitals in Buddhist Asia from the 3rd
century B.C.

the World Fellowship of Buddhists

Desmond Stewart's reply: "The mod¬
ern hospital is the lineal descendant,"
I wrote, "of the Islamic 'maristan',
seen by Crusaders in the Holy Land
and visitors to Egypt. It derived from
Persia." If I say that the present
Queen of England is the lineal descen¬
dant of Queen Victoria, this does not
mean that other ancestors may not
include Charles I and even William the
Conquerorl Of course the Persians
did not invent medicine, and I nowhere
said that.
Besides the Buddhist heritage there
are two other ancestors of great Impor¬
tance: Pharaonic Egypt, where opera¬
tions on the skull were carried out In
very ancient times, and Pergamum in
what is now Turkey. (I visited the great
Aesculapium there some years back
and was in particular struck by a room
in which mentally sick patients were
put at night and then whispered to down
whispering shafts: an interesting antici¬
pation of Aldous Huxley's hypnopaedia.)
But the Europeans were unable to
contemplate the Aesculapium, the hos¬
pitals of Asoka or the clinics of the
Pharaohs. What they did see were
Islamic "maristans", derived from Persia.
Those "maristans" undoubtedly derived
in part from Buddhist India and Ceylon.
I made the point elsewhere In my essay
that the Persians of the period in
question were in touch with Indian
thought. They knew Sanskrit.
Persia's great contributions were very
much due to her position at the cross¬
roads between the west and the very
creative east.
REALITIES OF APARTHEID
Sir,
In my view, the "Unesco Courier"
should not have published the extracts
from South Africa's apartheid laws
("Inequality before the law in South
Africa") In its Nov. 1971 issue. Why
not give the people of South Africa
time to change things, instead of publish¬
ing in your columns a text so far
removed from reality, for example, as
paragraph 3 of the section on Education:
"A white man who spends a few hours
each week in his own home teaching
his African servants to read is guilty of
a criminal offence." Ronald Jakobitz
Basel, Switzerland
We can assure our correspondent of
the reality of the texts we published,
taken without exception from laws
still in existence in South Africa.
The example quoted is from section 9
of the Bantu Education Act, No 47,
of 1953Editor.
THE FIG-TREE OF THE RUINS
Sir,
Your colour photo "The fig-tree of
the ruins reigns supreme at Angkor"
("SOS Angkor", Dec. 1971) moved me
to write the following:
How often repeated are destruction and
[waste,
While footsteps are echoing so softly in
¡space,
Echoing footsteps in the process of time
Are a message to seekers of archaolo-
[gical finds.
Each echo so silent, yet whispering the
¡way,
Each empty footstep professing its day.
In the absence of present to the future
[of now,
Are recordings of movements and
[moments outgrown.
Sounds mocked by seasons of mutilated
[time,
Evidence smothered by centuries of grime.
How often repeated are destruction and
[waste,
While footsteps are echoing so softly in
[space.

RIDDLES OF MALTA'S
PREHISTORY
Sir,
I was pleased to see the article on
the "Venus figures" of Malta (Feb. 1972
issue). The photographs are magnifi¬
cent, but the text reproduces an account
which is no longer accepted by most
prehistorians and I feel that your readers
are entitled to up-to-date information.
Most of the new information is derived
from the excavations conducted by
Dr. David Trump at the site of Skorba;
it affects our understanding of both
the culture sequence and the absolute
chronology of Maltese prehistory.
The culture sequence. The excavation
at Skorba established stratigraphically
that the Zebbug phase was earlier than
the Mgarr phase and not later, as had
formerly been thought. It also produced
evidence for two previously unknown
phases between Ghar Dalam and
Zebbug, which Dr. Trump has called
Grey Skorba and Red Skorba.
Absolute chronology. There is some
confusion in the article about the abso¬
lute chronology of the Maltese sequen¬
ce. In fact this has been fairly well
established by a series of ten C14
(radiocarbon) dates seven from Skor¬
ba, one from Mgarr and two from Tar-
xien of which eight form a consistent
sequence and two are anomalous.
The C14 chronology suggests that the
first phase (Ghar Dalam) should be
dated c.4200-3800 B.C. (not 2500-2100
B.C., as quoted by Mr. Aimasy) and in
fact the latest phase of the temple
period (Tarxien) has a date c.2400 B.C.
Moreover, even this chronology now
seems too short, since recent work has
shown that the C14 time scale diverges
from the real time scale (calculated by
counting the tree-rings of the enormously
long-lived bristlecone pine, Pinus Aris-
tata) by varying amounts at different
periods. A calibration scale has been
prepared for C14 dates back to c.4500
B.C., so it is possible to calculate
approximately the real date in calendar
years represented by C14 dates within
this range.
The result for the Maltese sequence
is startling: the first settlers seem to
have arrived c.5000 B.C. and the temple
building period was probably over before
C.2500 B.C. In the light of this chron¬
ology, the Maltese temple culture
appears not simply a remarkable devel¬
opment, but also an astonishingly pre¬
cocious one. Ru,h D Whltehouse

RACE AND I.Q.
Sir,
I have just finished reading Prof.
Klineberg's article "Race and I.Q." in
the Unesco Courler (Nov. 1971). It is
a good piece, intelligently written and
soundly based. I like it better than
some of the recent writings on the same
subject in other periodicals. 1 notice
that the article contains examples from
a number of peoples on this troubled
earth of ours, but none about the Chi¬
nese, Koreans, Japanese, Indians, Cey¬
lonese, etc. Has no research been
done by their scientists?

ANYTHING GOES
Sir,
The modern cultural climate seems
not only to accept everything uncriti¬
cally, but to offer sometimes very high
rewards to the mediocre. Music and
singing seem, more than any other of
the art forms, to be accepted without
criticism. Singers with no voice, mouth¬
ing meaningless lyrics receive the adu¬
lation due to the trained singer of real
talent
