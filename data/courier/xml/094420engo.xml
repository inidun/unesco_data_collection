/99/, mixed media on paper (60 x 80 cm)
by Léo Scalpel
This work, which evokes the encounter between America and Europe in 1492, draws its unity
from an original synthesis of techniques and cultural references. On to a sheet ofpaper made
in France using traditional methods the artist has glued a papyrus leaf from Egypt (at bottom
left) and a sheet of gold leaf (top right). The image, which was computer-generated and
printed by ink-jet, represents an Amazonian Indian from Brazil. The moonbeam at top left
was spray-painted, and the splash of blue acrylic on the gold leaf recalls the blues of Yves
Klein, a leading figure in 20th-century Western art.

INTERVIEW
UMBERTO ECO
talks to
François-Bernard Huyghe
The Italian semiotician
Umberto Eco became known
to a worldwide audience
through his best-selling novel
The Name of the Rose
(1980), a murder mystery set
in medieval times which was
later adapted into a popular
film. This success has
tended to overshadow his
thinking on questions of
communication and other
social issues as developed in
such books as The Role of
the Reader and A Theory of
Semiotics. In this Unesco
Courier interview he
discusses the wider
significance of his work.
You are a semiologist. You study systems
of signs. What relevance does semiology
have for ordinary people? Can any prac¬
tical conclusions be drawnfrom work such
as yours?
I regard myself as a philosopher rather
than a semiologist, but general semiotics
could be said to have become the most
important branch of philosophy. Semiolo-
gists are perhaps more needed today than
ever before. We are living at the end of a
period of bipolarization; things seemed
simpler before, inasmuch as semiologists
from either of the two ideological camps
appeared intent on analysing and criticizing
the other's system, whereas now so many
cultures, so many languages and types of
discourse are clamouring for attention,
sometimes peacefully but sometimes by
force of arms, that it seems to me more
than ever necessary to compare and contrast
the various communication systems or
world-views. This is where semiology
comes in. I am not so credulous as to think
that semiology can bring peace to the
world, or that the Republic of Philoso¬
phers could ever be established. But semi¬
otics can play a role in education and civics;
it can, for instance, inculcate a certain sense
of relativity, of diversity and tolerance.
Work needs to be done among the
young, from a very early age, three or four
onwards, if only to teach them that there are
different languages, so that they grasp the
idea of diversity, to show them, for example,
that in different languages there are many
different names for a rabbit, and that those
who call a rabbit by some other name are
not necessarily barbarians. Since semiology
is concerned with all cultural systems and
not only languages, it could help to teach
children that there are other ways of
dressing, other eating habits, in other words
different forms of ritual behaviour in dif¬
ferent societies, each of which is mean¬
ingful within a given society.
That would be one way of teaching tol¬
erance and understanding. If future gener¬
ations of children could look upon dif¬
ferent systems with the same tolerance as
semiologists, we would have made extra¬
ordinary progress!
Having said that, enabling people to
understand each other better is not neces¬
sarily a panacea for the ills of the world.
Aspirin does not cure all ailments, but there
is no harm in sending some to places where
there is an epidemic of malaria.
I do not believe, either, that a shared lan¬
guage or culture necessarily means a broth¬
erhood of man: some of the worst con¬
flicts of the last 200 years have been civil
wars between people speaking the same
language.
Nevertheless, the mere idea ofa certain
cultural relativism unfailingly stirs up con¬
troversy. Where do you stand in the debate
that, rightly or wrongly, sets "cultural rel¬
ativism " against "universalism "?
Cultural relativism argues that our
understanding of the world takes various

forms, from language to religion, and that
they lack a common basis of comparison.
Taking this argument to extremes, one
would have to conclude, for example, that
there was no possible way of translating a
concept expressed in the language of Hopi
Indians into English, or vice versa. That
would be absolute cultural relativism. As
Thomas Kuhn said about scientific para¬
digms, they may be incompatible but that
does not mean they cannot be compared
one with another. The Ptolemaic and
Copernican systems are indeed incompat¬
ible, but it is possible to compare them, to
show their complete independence of one
another, but also to understand how the
transition from one to the other came
about. The concepts of Moon or Earth are
not totally different in the two systems,
even though the two systems had different
ideas about their movements. The semio-
logical approach, that of cultural anthro
pology or any other approach that pays
heed to the diversity of cultures proceeds by
comparison. It looks for points where com¬
parisons can be made; it does not shut sys¬
tems off in totally different compartments,
but seeks out common ground between
them, and if it does not find any it respects
their differences. In my view there is no
unresolvable contradiction between cul¬
tural relativism and universalism.
To take another example, different lan¬
guages employ different categories to sig¬
nify even such simple things as wood. Eng¬
lish may use the word "timber" to
distinguish the construction material from
"wood" in the sense of woodland, but
French uses the same word "bois" in both
senses. Translation is possible all the same;
it bases itself on the possibility that two
different languages have a meeting-point; it

country, but if I am told to go and

in a predicament.
is an operation whereby the target lan¬
guage tries to keep as much of the source
language as possible and transpose it into its
own terms. To translate from German into
French, I need to know German and to
grasp precisely where the two languages
differ. In that sense, there is nothing more
universal than translation.
Holism absolute cultural relativism
would have us conclude that translation is
impossible, and that there is no way of
enunciating atomic physics in a jungle lan¬
guage or of expressing the problems of
jungle-dwellers in Western languages.
A totally different mistake, but one of
equal gravity, would be to think that in
language there are such things as discover¬
able universals, and that the diversity of
languages could thereby be reduced to a
single language. If there are any universal
categories, they are such distinctions or
opposites as "up" and "down" or ideas
connected with our bodies like those of
being hungry or being full. There is no
need to look much further to find how
many things, including the concepts of
good and evil, differ even between peoples
that are relatively close to each other, but it
is still possible to compare two concepts of
good and evil and see what they have in
common.
We could take for our guidance the
metaphor of translation as an image
standing for a tolerant world outlook. In
purely theoretical terms, translation should
not be possible, and yet people do talk to
one another and translate or interpret one
another's words. In the abstract, by
sophistry, the impossibility of movement or
anything else can be proved, but in real life
people live and move about.
To my way of thinking, an organization
such as UNESCO should neither promote
cultural diversity to the point where the
cultures concerned can no longer compre¬
hend one another, nor claim to assert uni¬
versal values equally valid the world over.
The essential thing is to bring cultures into
contact. Any given culture is, generally
speaking, capable of "translating" another
into its own terms. Even if there are bound
to be inaccuracies, mistakes and distor¬
tions, it is better than total ignorance.
The same goes even for closely related
languages like Italian and Spanish. All Ital¬
ians think they can more or less under
stand Spanish and vice versa, but there are
misleading cognates in the two languages,
expressions that look alike but mean the
opposite of each other. Although this means
one has to be on the lookout for possible
mistakes and misunderstandings, it does
not, in practice, stop an Italian and a
Spaniard understanding one another rea¬
sonably well.
Understanding each other or under¬
standing the diversity of cultures is one
thing, hut making value judgements is
something else. Isn't there some point at
which, even if one has grasped the idea
that concepts ofgood and evil vary from
system to system, one has to exercise one's
own judgement as to good and evil?
This is one of the most serious prob¬
lems. Somebody once asked me if I looked
at such problems through the eyes of a
sociologist or of a moralist. My normal
answer is that if I have to study a culture
where cannibalism is practised, I do so with
a sociologist's eye, trying to understand
how it is that this culture views cannibalism
with approval, but as regards my own con¬
duct, the moralist in me tells me that eating
people is wrong. The problem arises when
cultures come into contact. Suppose that
some lost jungle tribe of cannibals emi¬
grated to this country. Should we, out of
respect for their culture, allow them to
practise cannibalism here or should we
forbid it because it is against the law here?
Situations like these have to be solved on
]]>

a case-by-case basis, by deciding where to set
the limits of toleration. If a certain culture
requires girls to wear the chador, I see no
reason to forbid it, since it does not violate
my own ethical principles. If a culture, as
happens with certain religious sects, bans
blood transfusions for sick children, there
starts to be a problem because the law in this
country says one must help a person in
danger. Cannibalism should be banned
because it violates our value system; we
have to tell the cannibal, "If you come here
you have to comply with certain rules."
Limits to what is tolerable have to be set, but
there are things that are truly "intolerable"
racism, cannibalism, murder and so on.
I obviously cannot tolerate human sac¬
rifice being practised in my own country,
but if I am told to go and invade or colonize
a country to stop it being practised there I
find myself in a predicament. The justifi¬
cation given for colonialism was this idea
that we should go to other people's coun¬
tries and "teach them right from wrong".
Problems like these have to be solved
case by case, and are often harrowing. In
Italy, for instance, one such question has
arisen over population groups that practise
. ritual infibulation. When they come to our
country, a difficulty arises because we con¬
sider infibulation an intolerable practice.
Some people have suggested there could
be special clinics where the infibulation
required by their customs could be carried
out. For myself, I consider infibulation to
border on the intolerable. But where is the
borderline between tolerable and intoler¬
able? That is the really difficult question.
There can be no hard-and-fast answer,
otherwise we would end up invading the
whole world from pole to pole just because
such and such a group might have customs
that are unacceptable by our standards.
These are questions that have to be dealt
with, sometimes painfully, case by case.
We have seen that "cultural relativism"
is a controversial subject, but there is
another controversy, almost its mirror
image, over a certain form of "global cul¬
ture" or "mass culture" disseminated by
the media and the so-called "cultural indus¬
tries". It has long been criticized by various
intellectuals, but your views are, are they
not, more optimistic than the opinions of
those you have dubbed "apocalyptic"?
As long ago as the 1960s I criticized intel¬
lectuals who reject mass culture from the
outside without taking the trouble to look
into it, and I stressed that we could make
positive use of these mass media. I am rather
more pessimistic now than I was then,
because anyone can see, for example, how
the ratings war has brought television pro¬
grammes down to their lowest common
denominator in terms of quality; but this is
like acknowledging that translation is pos¬
sible and then ignoring the reality that 80 per
cent of translations are appalling because
they have been done in a hurry, because
translators are badly paid and so on.
Let's not forget that mass culture can
also mean the use of new technologies for
distance education at university level. We
tend to equate mass culture with its most
obvious, most commercial outlets such as

some forms of television; but mass culture
also represents an opportunity for easier
access to culture and education, through
diskettes, CD-ROM and suchlike, so why
not imagine UNESCO helping to set up a
vast mass communication system using radio
and television for educational purposes?
The main burden of my criticism in the
1950s and 1960s remains valid to the extent
that the intellectual community still in many
cases protests about the negative aspects of
mass culture without really involving itself
in an effort to correct them. You still find
people who say that we live in a civilization
of the image and that the printed word is on
its way out. That is wrong: mass culture
has resulted in an increase in the output of
printed matter and has given a boost to the
reading habit.
Some "apocalyptic" views are uncalled
for, but that does not prevent our observing
that television and the press are caught in a
downward commercial spiral of sensation¬
alism, making up bogus news items and
engineering sensational happenings. Mass
culture has, however, also taught children to
show greater respect for trees and has helped
to create greater environmental awareness.
There are positive sides to what the
media are doing, the growing awareness of
the nuclear threat for instance. I remember
that when we were trying to carry out anti-
nuclear propaganda in the 1960s with
demonstrations, books and so on, people
turned a deaf ear. They didn't even know
what radioactivity was and didn't want to
know. Thirty years on, thanks to films, tele¬
vision and the press, they all have a better
understanding of the nuclear menace. It is
through the mass media that people in some
countries have gained a better idea of the
dangers of pollution.
Both aspects have to be looked at: tele¬
vision can be conducive to extremes of vul¬
garity, abuse, inanity and so forth, but at the
same time it can raise public awareness of
atmospheric pollution, soften up resistance
to traffic control measures, for instance,
or persuade people to be careful how they
dispose of rubbish. These are realities that
must be faced, in the knowledge that some
new technology may be invented
tomorrow that may change the nature of
communications.
That said, some innovations that started
out positive may have become negative.
Mass car ownership seemed a good thing at
first but now road traffic needs to be kept
in check. What is needed is to avoid any
preconceptions while remaining vigilant.
Why are intellectuals more and more
often called on to show the way?
In a sense, this has been the case for thou¬
sands of years, since societies have always
needed to assign to certain of their mem¬
bers, priests or philosophers for example,
the role of discussing values.
It is possible, in the abstract, to imagine
a world in which each individual is by turns
a hunter, a fisherman, a thinker and so on,
but for the time being, as long as society is
made up of people most of whom cannot
devote themselves to this question of values,
there have to be "Indian reservations"
where society continues to support people
whom it requires to fulfil this role. The
problem is that they need to be regarded
not as oracles but as channels through
which the discussion about values gets to
the others. This is the function of poets,
thinkers and philosophers, to be attentive
to what is going on and bring it to other
people's attention so that they in turn can
think about it. This role we assign to intel¬
lectuals is, I think, almost a physiological
function that the body politic cannot do
without. Regarding intellectuals as oracles,
on the other hand, is more like a social dis¬
ease. Here again it is a question of moder¬
ation. As far as I am concerned, I do not
regard it as any part of my mission to be
consulted as an oracle, which is why I avoid
giving interviews. O

Editorial by Federico Mayor
WHATis a minority? Does a group become a minority simply by virtue of regarding itself
as one? Can any and every minority invoke the right to self-determination? Is it con¬
ceivable that the map of the world could ever be redrawn to conform with ethnic cri¬
teria? Are there any general principles for ensuring peaceful coexistence between majorities and
minorities? These are some of the questions raised in the following pages, in an issue of the
UNESCO Courier which does not claim to be an exhaustive treatment of the problem but an
attempt to investigate its complexity. For myself, I should particularly like to emphasize the
worldwide dimension of this question, because it throws light both on its most topical aspects and
on conditions for a long-term solution.
The context in which the issue of minorities arises today is indeed very closely related to the gen¬
eral characteristics of the age. It is no longer a context of sealed frontiers and isolated regions but
one of an integrated global system in which the links of interdependence in finance, technology and
communications are growing closer each day. Political, industrial or military decisions made at one
end of the world very rapidly have an impact at the other. Because of the scale of production units
and the pressures of international competition, regional economic groupings are imposing increasing
constraints upon individual countries, to the detriment of their national preferences. Certain role
models, symbols and tastes in clothing and food are being propagated worldwide by the mass media.
As a reaction against this trend towards globalizationwhich is accompanied by growing inequal¬
ities between the different world regions people everywhere are seeking to defend themselves against
encroaching uniformity and dehumanization. Individuals and communities alike are thereby
voicing their desire to exist, to use their powers of creation, to play an active part in national and
international life. Where there is no peaceful and democratic context in which these aspirations can
find an effective outlet, extremist, demagogic, xenophobic and even racist ideas begin to spread, trans¬
forming the legitimate desire to affirm identity into an aggressive attitude, tending towards isola¬
tionism and exclusion and accompanied by a rejection of universal values, disregard for the rights
and liberties of the person, and a refusal to seek common ground or to teach the values of tolerance.
The problem of minorities today is a specific instance of this general phenomenon: the global¬
ization not only of economic networks but also of humanist values means that no feasible solution
can be based on the establishment of ethnic, national or religious frontiers. Minorities whether
they be cultural communities within a nation or entire regions confronting a centre of industrially
developed power are destined to achieve fulfilment as part of a general democratization of public
life, both within each state and worldwide.
The lives of peoples, large and small, today come within the scope of a balance that needs to be
established between rights and duties in relation to humankind as a whole, but this balance will only
be accepted by all if it commands the allegiance of all, and this in turn presupposes absolute
respect for the freedom and dignity of minorities failure to respect them has so often been the jus¬
tification for breakaway movements.
Culture is clearly a crucial area of self-fulfilment, the realm in which the particular genius of a
people or an individual finds freest expression provided, however, that it is something other than
a memory of the past, looking back towards a mythical identity, provided that it becomes a
memory looking towards the future, receptive to others, deriving continual, never-ending enrich¬
ment from inner and outer sources.
Minorities and majorities alike, we are all called upon to choose between competing pasts and
a common future, between withdrawal into old totalitarian modes that stifle the individual and tear
the world apart, and the challenge of freedom for each and every one of us, the challenge of a human
race finally reconciled with itself. B 9

WHAT IS
A
MINORITY?
by Deirdre Meintel
Applied to society,
the concept of a
minority is not
necessarily
numerical. Social
and historical
factors shape a
group's
consciousness of
minority status
10
IN the West, the issue of minorities goes back
to the late eighteenth and early nineteenth
century, when the new or changing political
boundaries of European nation-states subjected
certain ethnic groups to the domination of other
ethnic or national groups. Probably the most
influential definition of the concept of "minority"
is that first proposed in 1945 by the sociologist
Louis Wirth, who wrote: "We may define a
minority as a group of people who, because of
their physical or cultural characteristics, are sin¬
gled out from the others in the society in which
they live for differential and unequal treatment
and who therefore regard themselves as objects of
collective discrimination."
By Wirth's definition, the existence of a
minority implies that a corresponding majority
group enjoys higher status and greater privileges;
those holding minority status are excluded from
full participation and are treated as, and consider
themselves to be, "a people apart". To summarize,
members of a minority group are "identifiably
different", that is, characterized by observable
traits that distinguish them from others in the
same society; subject to differential treatment
from others; and conscious of the discrimina¬
tion they experience as members of the group.
The anthropologists Charles Wagley and
Marvin Harris have proposed several modifica¬
tions to Wirth's definition. Minority status, in
their view, is inherited according to the descent
rules of a society, in such a way that an indi¬
vidual is assigned to the minority group even
when he or she does not manifest the minority's
visible traits. For example, in the American racial
system, having any known African-American
ancestry has usually been sufficient to place an
individual in the "Black" or "Negro" category.
Minority status is thus something one is "born
into", rather than something acquired later in
life. Wagley and Harris also consider that minori¬
ties are generally endogamous, since they are
normally prohibited from marrying into the
dominant group. Such prohibitions have the
effect of maintaining the boundaries between
majority and minority, and by extension perpet¬
uating the privileges of the majority. Note that
what is at issue is not sexual contact between the
two groups but rather descent and inheritance.
Endogamy (marrying within one's own group)
ensures that majority status is passed only to the
legitimate children of majority members and so
remains inaccessible to anyone not of that group.
While Wagley and Harris' formulation would
apply well to many situations of majority-
minority relations, it is far from universal in
application. For one thing, their criterion of
"endogamy" requires some qualification in the
light of later research. While it is true that
endogamy of the elite, privileged group serves to
maintain its boundaries, minorities often marry
into other minorities. In fact "intermarriage"
between ethnic groups in the contemporary
United States often concerns partners of dif¬
ferent minority groups. More importantly, recent
years have seen the emergence of many groups
that see themselves as minorities and organize
themselves as such but do not meet the criterion
of inherited status or endogamy. We shall return
later to the issue of whether, for example, women
or homosexuals can properly be considered
minorities.

More recent writers have given greater
emphasis than did Wirth to the political domi¬
nation exercised by the majority group. It is the
greater access to and control of resources access
to health care, jobs, food, education, wealth that
allows one group to control the life chances of
another. Put another way, it is the greater polit¬
ical power of the majority that allows it to dis¬
criminate against the minority, to treat its mem¬
bers in detrimental ways that may range from
stereotyping to extermination.

some clarification. It is all too easy for the dom-

inant group to attribute a minority's inferior
status to its unique characteristics rather than to
its structural position. This is the process known
as "blaming the victim". This may be done, not
only in regard to what are conventionally seen as
racial groupings, but also in regard to religious
minorities, homosexuals and others. Other
writers have drawn attention to modern forms of
racism whereby "culture" is invoked in so essen-
tialist a fashion (see below) as to constitute a
"second nature". Immigrants, for example, may
be discriminated against on the grounds of their
culture. In such instances, the norms, values,
beliefs and practices attributed to them are seen
as the basis of their essential difference from and
inferiority to majority members. II

DEIRDRE MEINTEL
is a Canadian anthropologist
who teaches at the University
of Montreal. She has carried
out research in the Cape
Verde islands, among Cape-
Verdean Americans in New
England and among immigrant
groups in Montreal. In recent
years her research has focused
on social Identity and on family
relationships in migrant
groups.
The quality of "identifiability" is an espe¬
cially pertinent issue at present, given that in
North America, at least, one hears much of "vis¬
ible minorities" in public discourse. The differ¬
ences thought to be "visible" are in reality those
considered socially significant. Thus a North
African may be highly visible in Paris, yet less so
in Montreal or New York.
In other words, identifiably "different" char¬
acteristics do not so much explain power differ¬
entials as legitimize them and facilitate their exer¬
cise. Furthermore, identifiability is not always
supplied by the minority itself. Jews, for example,
were required to wear a yellow star in Nazi Ger¬
many precisely because their supposed "differ¬
ence" from the rest of the population might oth¬
erwise have remained invisible, giving the lie,
one might add, to the grotesque representations
ofJews to be found in the Nazi-controlled press
and cinema. In other cases, as we shall see, making
oneself identifiable as a minority group member
is part of developing minority consciousness.
"NEW" MINORITIES
This brings us to the question of what might be
called "new" minorities. Recent years have seen
increased political consciousness among, and in
some cases mobilization of, other types of groups
who see themselves as minorities that have been
subject to discrimination. Women, for example,
would seem to fit Wirth's definition of a minority
quite well: they are visibly different, subject to dis¬
crimination of various sorts and in recent decades
have been conscious of being discriminated
against because of being women. Yet it was only
in the 1970s that sociologists began to see
women's status as separate from that of the men
to whom they were attached and the position of
women as an issue for the study of social hier¬
archy and stratification. Indeed, women's dif
ferential access to wealth, prestige, health care
and in some societies even food, all go to show
that, as Rosalind Dworkin put it in the title of an
article on women as a minority group, "Numbers
do not a minority make".
Homosexuals are another such "new
minority", insofar as they have developed a group
awareness of suffering differential treatment
because of their sexual orientation. In this case,
identifiability is of special concern. Many gays and
lesbians associate raised consciousness of social
injustice toward homosexuals with "coming out",
that is, making their sexual orientation public. In
the United States, "outing", or making public
the homosexuality of individuals in public life, is
a strategy favoured by some gays, though it has
been more often threatened than actually put
into practice.
Another social category that might be seen as
a minority, at least in some cases, is the elderly.
Age-based discrimination in hiring, forced retire¬
ment and other issues of common concern have
mobilized group consciousness in North America
and Western Europe, where modern capitalism
has been associated with devalued status for older
persons. Examples of political mobilization
include the "Grey Panther" organization in the
United States; in Italy, old-age pensioners have
been known to organize political demonstra¬
tions in recent years. The deaf offer yet another

example of a social category that is currently in the
process of mobilizing as a minority.
There are many contemporary instances of
highly diverse categories of disadvantaged people
being treated as homogeneous groupings char¬
acterized by inferior moral characteristics. Etienne
Balibar, for instance, holds that the category
"immigration" (or "immigrants") now functions
as a substitute for the notion of race. In Canada
one often hears generalizations whereby refugees
are presented as particularly undesirable immi
grants, as "queue jumpers", perpetrators of "wel¬
fare frauds" and so on. Several years ago, a nation¬
wide television broadcast in the United States
showed through brief interviews with passers-by
that "the homeless" are often perceived as a
homogeneous grouping, one composed of moral
undesirables who are themselves to blame for
their circumstances. If such stereotyping were
to go on for many years, it is quite possible that
these social categories too might develop minority
group consciousness.
MINORITY CONSCIOUSNESS
The above examples make it clear that minority
formation is a social and historical process. One
of the key elements in it is the development of
consciousness among those concerned that they
are subject to a common discrimination as mem¬
bers of a given category. Thus what might appear
as simple social aggregates in one historical period
become politically conscious minorities in
another.
As mentioned earlier, the stereotypes applied
to minorities are generally "essentialist" in char¬
acter; that is, they refer to differences supposed to
be either biological or cultural, but in any case pri¬
mordial, fundamental and little amenable to
change. At the same time, minority group mem¬
bers may themselves adopt an "essentialist" dis¬
course whereby their characteristics are seen as
intrinsically different from those of the majority;
certain manifestations of négritude, on the one
hand, and feminism, on the other, might be viewed
in this light. In a context of persecution or dis¬
crimination, it is likely that minority members
themselves will be led to experience whatever
defines them as "different" as the key element, per¬
haps the only pertinent one, in their social identity.
However, it is our belief that minority con¬
sciousness does not necessarily lead to a narrow
concern with one set of issues, and with one
aspect of social identity, but rather can become the
basis of wider solidarities with other groupings
who have experienced similar treatment. In the
case of ethnic minorities, such solidarities may
take the form of transethnic affiliations between
groups on the basis of cultural similarities, shared
minority status and/or common experiences of
discrimination. In the words of Albert Memmi,
"The oppressed all resemble each other; the Col¬
onized, the Jew, the Poor, the Woman. . . . The
same suffering often calls forth the same reac¬
tions." It is not popular in our times to assert such
solidarities, yet in a historical period marked by
ever-increasing minority consciousness, expressed
on ever more narrow bases of affiliation, to the
point of becoming a kind of collective individu¬
alism, such solidarities may be our best hope for
creating human community. 13

IMNTITY-
A CARD WITH
TWO FACES
by Mauro Peressini
A hard look
at the concept of
group identity
and its impact,
for better or
worse, on today's
world
T|TB^HERE are, to my mind, two ways of
looking at the current upsurge in demands
for the recognition of cultural, religious,
ethnic, racial or national identities.
On the positive side, the efforts by certain
population groups to assert their identity can be
regarded as "liberation movements", as strategies
for challenging oppression and injustice. What
these groups are doing proclaiming that they are
different, rediscovering the roots of their cul¬
ture, strengthening group solidarity or aspiring to
political self-determination may accordingly
be seen as necessary and legitimate attempts to
escape from their state of subjugation and enjoy
a certain measure of dignity.
On the down side, however, involvement in
militant action for recognition tends to make
such groups more deeply entrenched in their
attitudes and to make the cultural compartments
into which they are divided even more watertight.
The assertion of identity then starts to turn into
self-absorption and isolation, and is liable at any
time to slide into intolerance of others and
towards ideas of ethnic "cleansing" and xeno¬
phobia, racism and violence.
14
CHANGE AS A CONSTANT
OF CULTURE
The main feature of human societies and their
cultures has always been not that they have stood
still but that they have been responsive to change.
Instances of isolated societies that have remained
unaffected by historical events are exceptions, if
not indeed myths, and such societies have seldom
prospered.
Almost all societies have, in one way or
another, been caught up in history, whether
through natural phenomena (disasters or climatic
or environmental changes), migratory move¬
ments (emigration, immigration, the meeting and
intermingling of peoples, or the dissemination of
knowledge, beliefs and values), political events
(wars and annexations) or economic factors (trade
and the spread of technology), and have con¬
stantly needed to redefine and change them¬
selves, invent, generate ideas, borrow and acquire,
and devise new ways of acting and thinking.
Far from representing an unchanging set of
ways of acting and thinking or a finite body of
knowledge, beliefs, values, traditions or rules,
standards or principles, culture is a living thing, a
process involving communication and cross-fer¬
tilization. It is therefore an exaggeration to talk
about the danger of "losing" a culture and about
the need to "retrieve", "protect", "safeguard" or
"cleanse" it. Since culture is a continuing process
of change, acculturation is its mode of existence.
It is because of this constant reshaping of cul¬
ture by history that a cultural, ethnic, racial or
national group is never a uniform entity but
breaks down instead into different cultural sub-
units that are themselves continually undergoing
change, such as families and kinship groups; vil¬
lages, towns and regional groupings; social classes,
occupational groups, blue-collar and white-collar
workers, managers and bosses; generations,
young people and old; men and women; or the
mentally or physically handicapped.
Thus, although the fact of being different is at
the heart of every group's identity, on the other
hand every group contains individuals who share
many points of resemblance with people in other
groups. According to the cultural aspect on which
emphasis is placed (religion, culinary habits,
dress, language etc.), groups shift frontiers and
overlap, the limits become more blurred, and
distinctions between one's own and others' iden¬
tity become a matter of degree or of place in the
same continuum.
Governed by their own hybrid logics,1 the cul¬
tures of all groups are much more like a mobile
and open-ended assemblage of many differing

parts than a uniform, stable, self-contained and
easily defined entity, especially at the present
time, as upheavals of all kinds follow fast on one
another, cultures communicate as never before,
and populations move about in millions.
A SIMPLIFYING FICTION
At a time of continual changes in ways of acting
and thinking, collective identities provide indi¬
viduals with a means of simplifying reality.
This simplification works firstly by trans¬
forming the whole set of individuals composing
the group (cultural minority, ethnic group, race or
nation) into a uniform and distinct entity, so that
the group can be represented as an obvious empir¬
ical reality. The uniformity of the group is ensured
by the selection of a limited number of features
both as being typical of the individuals forming the
group and as being more important than other fea¬
tures in terms of the definition of their identity.
Whereas an objective observer analysing a
given population would find an infinite number of
possible criteria for describing, grouping together
or distinguishing between the individuals being
observed, those militating for recognition of their
group's identity arbitrarily choose a limited
number of criteria, such as language, skin colour
or religion, so that group members recognize
themselvesprimarily in terms of the labels attached
to the group whose existence is being asserted,
"black", "white", "Arab", "Muslim", "Jewish",
"Christian", "Hindu", "French", "Italian" or
whatever.
The distinction between the group in question
and other groups is established by simplifying
the features selected. Whereas the same objective
observer could see only continuous variations
for each criterion, and would thus be prevented
from drawing clear dividing-lines between the
groups, those militating for recognition of their
identity simplify each criterion by eliminating the
variations they regard as secondary and are thus
able to speak, for example, of a national lan¬
guage, of "whites" and "blacks", or of the Islamic
or Jewish faith.
Simplification also works by transforming
groups into essences, abstractions endowed with
the capacity to remain unchanged through time.
The cultural minority, ethnic group, race or nation
concerned is thus seen as being outside of time,
while change and the effects of history are denied
or underestimated. In some cases, people actu¬
ally act as though the group had remained
unchanged and talk, for example, about the history
of the "French", the "blacks" or the "Jewish
people", as if those entities had survived for cen¬
turies without changing, as if the "French", the
"blacks" or the "Jews" of two or five or ten cen¬
turies ago were the same people as today, using the
same tools and techniques and with the same ways
of acting and flunking, the same desires, aspirations,
anxieties and pleasures.
In other instances, although the changes
wrought by history are acknowledged, the deep-
rooted identity of the group is still not questioned.
The group is seen metaphorically as an edifice
that has been collectively shaped and built up
over the centuries, or else as a living individualwho
is born and develops. It is when the concepts
enshrined in the words "patrimony" or "her¬
itage" are looked at in the context of the metaphor
of "work under construction" that they really
become meaningful: objects, knowledge, beliefs,
values and traditions all represent building-blocks
for the collective edifice which have to be carefully
stockpiled and must not be lost or destroyed. It is
likewise in the context of the metaphor of the
"individual" that the concept of the "collective
memory" can be understood: cultures, ethnic
groups or nations are credited with the faculty of
memory and are spoken of as though they were
human beings (who can be "humiliated" or
"betrayed" or "avenged"). When people are forced
to acknowledge the far-reaching changes that his¬
tory has wrought and when they admit that the
identity of the group may no longer be what it was,
the present state of the group often comes to be
seen as one of "sickness". People then start looking
back on some period in the past as having been the
time when the group possessed a now tarnished
"purity" or a now lost "authenticity". The past
although it was the present for the people living at
the time is regarded as an unchanging state, a
baseline to be turned to as one turns to a
remedy in order to rediscover and re-establish
the truth about the group, or its essence.
Cultural, ethnic, racial or national identities
are fictions that simplify social realities, and they
have practical effects, two negative aspects of
which I wish particularly to stress. WÍ9

Firstly, they gloss over and disparage thepre-
sent and contemporary history. Changes in ways
of acting and thinking, contacts between peo¬
ples, the patterns of exchanges and intermin-
glings of which both present and past are
formed all these are often discussed in such
negative terms as the "contamination" of cul¬
tures, the "expansion" of modern Western cul¬
ture, world-wide "uniformity" and the "disap¬
pearance" of human diversity. Some aspects of
recent history show there to be an element of
truth in these judgements, but to leave things at
that would be to run the risk of failing to see
what is being created afresh in the crucible of
the present. It could be argued, moreover, that a
disparaging attitude to the present day and con¬
temporary history is tantamount to contempt
,, for the lives, efforts, aspirations and desires of mil¬
lions of men and women who are, after all, coping
as best they can with the unstable, ill-assorted raw
materials that history has handed down to them.
Who is to say that they are on the wrong track
and that their cultures are not authentic? What
right or authority has anyone to say so?
Secondly, the way in which groups are indi¬
vidualized or personalized in the name of iden¬
tity has negative effects similar to those of the
individualism that is creating havoc in the indus¬
trialized societies of the West. It is individualism
raised to the group level. As a result, the only
legitimate principle of behaviour that such groups
recognize is the satisfaction of their own self-
interest, which lies in maximizing their economic
and political profits and in selfishly devising
schemes for development and expansion without
regard for other people.
Such group individualism ends up with all
groups fighting and competing against one
another, and leads on to the logical consequence
of all individualism, i.e. there can only be "win¬
ners" if there are also "losers" cultural minori¬
ties, ethnic groups or nations that cannot fend for
themselves, cannot have their own territories or
form their own states.
IDENTITY AS A COGNITIVE
NECESSITY
Paradoxically, however, it is precisely because
identity represents a simplifying fiction, creating
uniform groups out of disparates, drawing border
lines across a continuum and turning groups into
unchanging essences, that it is necessary and
indeed essential to the agents of social change.
Although it is a factor of division, it is also a
factor oí vision2. Like the concepts we use to put
names to things and designate ideas, identity cat¬
egories make it possible for us to understand and
grasp reality. In a constantly changing world,
they enable us to put names to ourselves and to
others, form some idea of who we are and who
other people are, and ascertain the place we

occupy along with other people in the world
and in society. Lastly, as a means of recognizing
the members of a particular group (x is an X
because he or she acts or thinks in such-and-
such a way), identity provides the framework
for interpreting, predicting or managing our
behaviour or that of other people (x is bound to
do this because he or she is an X).
The current upsurge in efforts to assert the
identity of various groups can, in fact, be partly
explained by the cognitivefunction performed by
identity. Naturally, many of these movements can
be explained in terms of a tangle of economic and
political factors combining the faceless logic of the
international system and the special interests of
small groups and individuals who look upon cul¬
tures, ethnic groups, races or nations only as means
to achieve other ends and to manipulate people.
That being said, people would not go along as
they do, often in large numbers, with the propo¬
sitions put to them, in spite of the sacrifices they
entail, if there were not a very strong feeling of
need for identity, a need to "take stock of things"
and know "who we are", "where we come from"
and "where we are going", that is accounted for in
turn by the increased pace of change in today's
world.

constraints imposed by financial markets, the
glaring intrusions of communications, the media
and the products of the cultural industries all
these disrupt not only the everyday material and
economic lives of people all over the world but
also their symbolic frames of reference. Knowl¬
edge, skills, beliefs, values, traditions, rules and
standards of behaviour, moral and religious prin¬
ciples are all constantly being called into question.
Withdrawal into a world of one's own and a
search for cultural or ethnic "roots" come to be
seen as attempts to put down markers and to
stem the fast-moving tide of time and history.
Individuals need their identity because it makes
things less complicated and unsettled, so that they
can then put some order not only into their own
lives but into the world around them. In this
sense, identity also generates reality and con¬
tributes to the role performed by imagination or
religion in a world that is itself only chaos. Like
imagination or religion, identity creates order out
of chaos and shapes the world by conferring
meaning on it, which is why it can be regarded as
a source of liberation in some circumstances.
LINES OF APPROACH
Identity is thus a necessity, but its negative side-
effects must be avoided at all costs. How can
these two contradictory aspects of identity be
reconciled? I propose to confine myself to a few
lines of approach.
The first of these relates to what I would call
the mobility ofidentity. If any identity, whether
it be cultural, ethnic or national, is to function
properly in other words, if its suggested con¬
figuration is to be acknowledged as real and legit¬
imate it has to overlook or disregard the fact that
all such configurations are arbitrary and could be
drawn in many other possible ways.
This means we must bear the arbitrary nature
of identity constructs constantly in mind, not
with a view to eliminating all forms of identifi¬
cation and affiliation which would be unreal¬
istic, since identity is a cognitive necessity for
human beings but simply so as to remind our¬
selves that we each have several identities at the
same time.
The realization that we all have several iden¬
tities whereby to define ourselves has its uses.
During the recent constitutional discussions in
Canada, for instance, women from the country's
indigenous groups who wanted to hold on to
the protection they are afforded under the Cana¬
dian Charter of Rights and Freedoms opposed
attempts by the (male) community leaders to set
up an autonomous indigenous government run
on traditional lines and thus not subject to the
provisions of the Charter.
On this specific issue, the women adopted a
shifting identity strategy: first defined as "indige¬
nous", they became "women" when they stressed
the danger that the "principles of indigenous
government" represented for the autonomy and
equality of women in relation to men, then
became "Canadian citizens" when they militated
in favour of maintaining the Canadian Charter in
the event of there being an indigenous govern¬
ment.
When people realize that all identities are
arbitrary and that they can switch from one to
another to suit the circumstances, they can often
respond in a more effective and imaginative way
to pressures exerted on them from outside or
inside the group. This realization also prevents
people from becoming self-absorbed and with¬
drawing into a single identity, and hence makes it
possible for them to engage in dialogue and estab¬
lish cross-group bonds of solidarity (e.g. with
other "citizens" in one of the examples cited
above and with other "women" in another)
regardless of their cultural, racial, ethnic or
national origins.
The second line of approach would consist in
reinstating the present and contemporary his¬
tory. At a time when the "end of history" is
being predicted and tears of nostalgia are being
wept over the past, it is tempting to recall, as the
French philosopher Gilles Deleuze has done,
that "there are futures that operate in silence and
are almost imperceptible",3 and that culture is
being constantly and unexpectedly created by the 17

cobbling together of new ways of acting and
thinking, fresh and original combinations of ele¬
ments, and counter-cultures.
In this respect, the Third World sets an
example. There are, for example, a large number
of syncretic cults, such as "Kimbanguism" in
Congo and voodoo in Benin, Haiti, Cuba and
Brazil, in which Christian rites and modern ele¬
ments are blended with traditional values or
Christian saints are identified with pagan divini¬
ties. Similarly, the galloping urban growth that a
number of countries are undergoing gives rise, in
the Third World, not only to the kind of dehu-
manization that is seen in the main cities of the
industrialized countries but also to an upwelling
of cultural and social creativity. In the pobla¬
ciones of Santiago, thefavelas of Rio de Janeiro or
the shantytowns of Mexico City and elsewhere,
what is happening in many cases is the regener¬
ation of the social fabric through new principles
of solidarity and new forms of social participation,
such as self-managed micro-organizations, grass¬
roots economic organizations, religious com¬
munities, neighbourhood associations, young
18
people's and women's movements, environmental
groups and so on. As regards the economy too,
informal-sector activities are springing up all
over the place through a mixture of resourceful¬
ness and ingenuity, based on ideas of produc¬
tion and consumption very different from those
of the capitalist economy.4
All these examples, which have their coun¬
terparts in the most marginalized sectors of the
industrialized countries (prisons, teenage gangs
and also grassroots organizations), rather than
representing the replacement of "traditional"
cultures by a "Western-style culture", actually tes¬
tify to the emergence of a new, third way that, ill-
defined as it may be and arising under appalling
conditions, nevertheless holds out hope for the
future, indeed perhaps for the only possible
future.
Identities formulated in these terms deserve
our attention. Far from being based on
unchanging and exclusive membership rules, like
those of blood ties, parentage or mythical origin,
many of these identities are open-ended, in that
there is a continual inflow and outflow of mem¬
bers, which prevents them from taking on a self-
perpetuating existence of their own. This is true,
for example, of identities based on places of res¬
idence, like neighbourhood associations, or those
based on membership rules that are not handed
down from one generation to the next but are
defined by individuals themselves through the
institutions they create. "Citizenship" is another
form of identity which can be defined in the
course of struggles directly related to current
issues. A number of these identities also have
the advantage of being tied to the present and
being short-lived, of lasting for no longer than a
particular plan or militant action may last, which
prevents them from turning into hard and fast
identities.
Such identities, with their changing mem¬
berships and limited life-spans, give rise to com¬
munities which, vulnerable and unstable though
they may be, possess, thanks to this precious
"lightness of being", the strength to maintain an
enquiring and tolerant relationship with others
and at the same time to counter the unhealthy self-
absorption that is still so prevalent.

must be a priority
for modern
democracy
COMMUNITIES AT THE
CROSSROADS by Elizabeth Picard
Above, Basque separatists

Guernica (1992).
I
N the half-century following the Second
World War, the nation-state came to be
regarded with approval by every political
system and every ideology. In the name of mod¬
ernization in the West, of socialism in the countries
of the Eastern bloc and of development in the
Third World, it was expected to guarantee the
happiness of individuals as citizens, and of peoples
as societies. At a time of globalization and cultural
secularization, it seemed inconceivable that vio¬
lence could again rear its head on the basis of
community divisions, as it had in the past.
Today the state appears to have broken down
in many parts of the world. It has failed to guar¬
antee either security or social justice, and it has
been unable to prevent either international wars
or, to an even greater extent, civil wars like those
now ravaging Northern Ireland, Sri Lanka and
Somalia. In the past two decades, many states
have, through short-sightedness or self-interest,
been slow to respond to the new demands of
underprivileged peripheral groups.
In such situations people often respond by
replacing their loyalty to the state with loyalty
to a community. The community concerned
may take one of many forms. It may be a family
community of people who trace their genealogy
back to a common ancestor, real or mythical; a
local community people living in the same
valley, perhaps; a cultural community of peoples
sharing the same customs, values and above all
language; a racial community a group con¬
vinced that it is physically different from those
around it, despite the prevalence of ethnic inter¬
mingling; a religious community of members of
the same sect or faith.
At this point the community's objective to
be prosperous, to be free, and to defend itself
enters into competition with that of the nation-
state. If the state is stable and its institutions are
legitimate, it will be in a position to negotiate
with dissatisfied communities and to convert their
demands into political interests. If it is authori¬
tarian, it will repress what it sees as insubordina¬
tion or a threat of secession. If it is weak, itwill col-
lapse in the turmoil of rivalries between
communities. It may also be taken over by one of
its constituent communities at the expense of the
others. In that case, economic paralysis and for¬
eign intervention often intensify the internal crisis
and hasten the transition to armed hostilities.
As one observes the awakening of commu¬
nities in different parts of the world and sees
how armed force is being used to decisive effect
by small groups, one is bound to ask a number of
questions. Do these new community loyalties 19

directed against the state not themselves reflect an
aspiration to construct a state? Can such a state
be viable, based as it must be on the principle of
protective exclusion? What excesses may the
logic of group uniformity lead to? Is there not a
danger that the reaction, today so common,
against the excessive uniformity of the nation-
state may lead to a rejection of politics, under¬
stood as community management, in favour of
widespread tribal warfare?
THE OUEST FOR SECURITY
All over the world, retreat into the community-
group is closely linked to the quest for security.
"There can be no intensely felt sense of identity
without some perception of danger," writes the
French philosopher Pierre-André Taguieff in La
force du préjugé (1987). Since in the eyes of the
community-group the state has lost what Max
Weber called its monopoly of legitimate vio¬
lence, the only recognized form of security
becomes that of the "armed tribe". Arms flow in,
sent by sympathetic groups, procured by external
powers eager to acquire influence, or bought on
a world market awash with weaponry.
Amid the enthusiasm and emotion of collec¬
tive mobilization, volunteers form local militias
which soon, because of the economic crisis, take
on paid recruits for whom war is the only source
of income, the only means of feeding their fam¬
ilies. On the fringe of the militias, local gangs
take advantage of civil disorder to terrorize the
population and hold it to ransom. The militias
enforce their law on political parties and on civil
society. Within each community warlords take the
lead in mobilizing the group and are the main
architects of the "invention" of its identity.
Under their leadership, organizing the defence
of the community becomes the cement that binds
the community together. "We need a war to bring
us together and give us a common identity," said
the leader of a proscribed Northern Ireland para¬
military group in 1992. The militia sets out to
dominate a piece of territory and control access
to it, then to make it homogeneous by forcing
people to move out and by perpetrating mas¬
sacres. For if the horror of "ethnic cleansing"
has reared its head again fifty years after the col-
20
lapse of Nazism, obsession with the security of
the community causes forced and massive exo¬
duses of groups whose rights within a given piece
of territory are just as firmly based in history
(or myth) as those of their persecutors. Attempts
to preserve the security of the community by
expulsions create a sense of injustice in another
community nearby.
The militia builds walls and barricades, trans¬
forming zones of contact with other communi¬
ties into an impassable no-man's-land. Direct
contact and mixing between the different popu¬
lations come to an end and are replaced by ideo¬
logical relationships as communities are caught in
the toils of mutually hostile propaganda.
This process whereby militias, without any
precise military or political objectives, turn their
communities into fortresses has come to be
known as Lebanonization, after the pointless
and destructive conflicts that tore Lebanese
society apart for more than fifteen years (1975-
1990). Once the break with the other communi¬
ties has been made, the violence of the militias is
soon turned on their own people. The prevailing
view is that internal treason or defection is even
more dangerous than the external threat. The
militia will use all kinds of intimidation and coer¬
cion, from shows of force to taxation and con¬
scription, from admonition to kidnapping and
murder, to repress any sign of deviation and any
move towards co-operation between communi¬
ties or any questioning of the single-minded atti¬
tude its power is based on. By stirring up fear and
encouraging the community to retreat into itself,
coercion replaces consensus as society's motive
force and takes the place of the law at the heart of
the collective conscience.
INVENTING A COMMON IDENTITY
Use of force is the hallmark of the process of
community consolidation, but it is by no means its
only characteristic. The group's new leaders also
go in for social engineering, creating public services
and social support funds exclusively reserved for
members of the community. The arms trade, often
linked to drug trafficking, provides the militias
with illicit funds to keep their supporters on their
side. But it is principally by robbing the state
(controlling customs receipts) or by taking its
place (taxing business and trade and distributing
necessities) that the militias acquire usurped legit¬
imacy in the eyes of the people.
The warlords use terror and the redistribution
of society's wealth to begin a more ambitious
and in the long term more revolutionary process,
the definition of a specific identity for the group.
They base this definition on some form of dif¬
ference, objective or subjective, which has hith¬
erto been no more important within the state
than regional, professional or class distinctions.
From now on, however, all these factors will

fade into insignificance beside one fundamental
distinction: that between Protestants and
Catholics in Northern Ireland, that between
Muslims and Christians in Lebanon, that between
Basques and Spaniards, or between Kurds and
Turks, or that which divides the different clans of
Somalia, even though they are all Sunni Mus¬
lims speaking the Somali language.
Led by its new chiefs, the community sets
out to explore its new identity, which it enriches
and transforms by drawing on a stock of shared
symbols, myths and images that command loy
alty. Communities that are fighting for the con¬
trol of territory appeal to history, in other words
to their conflicting collective memories in which
each sees itself as the victim of a hated adver¬
sary. They invoke religion, but take from religion
only dogmatic certainties conducive to intoler¬
ance. They manipulate dubious notions of col¬
lective psychology that all tend to "prove" their
own moral and cultural superiority over the
groups around them.
Intellectuals, universities and clerical bodies are
called on to help; sophisticated communications

countries of the Middle East, is
engaged in research at the
Centre for International

kurde (Brussels, 1991).
and crowd-manipulation techniques are set in
motion. Young people are a particular target for
the business of identity-construction. Several
studies in Lebanon and Northern Ireland have
shown how receptive they can be to the language
used to construct a sectarian frame of mind and
how they become increasingly indifferent to
democratic values. If the frustrations of the com¬
munity generated the initial tensions, inter-com¬
munity warfare in its turn helps to sharpen the
sense of difference, to increase the gap between
groups and to make it impossible for them to
coexist within a single state.
But as the anthropologist Benedict Anderson
has pointed out, a community that is "invented"
in this way (in a dual sense of being both discov¬
ered and created) can never be other than an
"imaginary community" that is essentially no
more legitimate than the "national" community
it rejects, from which it wants to secede or whose
place it wishes to take. For the logic of commu¬
nity identity and security is ultimately national¬
istic; it seeks to establish a state for the commu¬
nity. It is obvious that this logic, if it goes
unchecked, must lead to a proliferation of ever-
smaller states, since each sub-group in turn can
invoke its own "distinctness", in a process that
ultimately ends up at the level of the individual
human being.
A NEW RULE OF LAW
Disturbed by the claims of the communities
within it, the modern state oscillates between
two temptations. The first is to forcibly repress
the demands of the communities and to pro¬
claim itself the only guarantor of the security of
all. In the name of national unity, territorial
integrity, the equality of its citizens and a non-par¬
tisan secularism, the state can use its powerful
resources to reject the demands of communi¬
ties it may even go as far as genocide to ensure
that order prevails. Contrariwise, there is now a
big temptation to respond to community
demands by questioning the very nature of those
states that were constructed more or less artifi¬
cially after the two World Wars. Czechoslovakia,
for example, has sadly but calmly decided to split
into two. Yugoslavia, on the other hand, is giving
a new and dramatic meaning to the word "Balka¬
nization": not only are the republics separating
from one another, but within each one the so-
called "confederated" regions, held together by
loose ties, are also splitting apart. Thousands of
kilometres away in Somalia, eight "clan regions"
aspire to separate from one another.
Even if they have the merit of guaranteeing the
security of the communities involved (and this is
by no means certain), can such divisions make
sense in a world of ultra-rapid communications
and industrial gigantism? Will these regions not
lack the redistributive resources necessary to
promote economic growth and social mobility in
such limited areas?
Without returning to the age of Empires,
whether Ottoman, Russian or Austro-Hun-
garian, the modern state must respond to the
new militancy of its constituent communities,
and to their legitimate quest for security. It must
do so by inventing what the French philosopher
and sociologist Raymond Aron called a "peace
through law" that would guarantee justice both
for the state as a whole and for its parts, and
respect the claims of both reason and the emo¬
tions. The problem is one of reconciling nation¬
alist demands with the exercise of democracy.
Before it can be solved, progress will have to be
made in international law (particularly with
regard to the formulation of community and
minority rights) and in constitutional law (with
regard to definitions of decentralization, associ¬
ation and devolution).
At a time when international organizations
and communities of states are becoming more
important, the nation, and therefore the state,
no longer holds a monopoly on democracy. For
this reason alone it should find a way of accom¬
modating local aspirations.

THE UNESCO COURIER - JUNE 1993
BY FRANCE BEQUETTE
The Courier's "Greenwatch"
section is now a year old. In
the course of looking into
programmes in progress
around the world and listing
available environmental edu¬
cation documents, we have come
across many initiatives that we
wanted to share with our readers.
The time has now come to take
stock of the most significant exper¬
iments carried out in the South and
the North alike, of the obstacles they
have encountered and the solutions
that have been proposed.
Unesco and the United Nations
Environment Programme (UNEP)
define environmental education as
"a permanent process in which indi¬
viduals gain awareness of their
environment and acquire the knowl¬
edge, values, skills, experiences, and
also the determination which will
enable them to actindividually and
collectivelyto solve present and
future environmental problems".
Experience shows that there is an
enormous gap between theory and
practice. The object is not just to
increase knowledge, but also to
change ways of thinking and the
behaviour patterns arising from
them. It is relatively easy to com¬
municate information, to explain,
for instance, why glass bottles
should be sent back for recycling

to alter the mindsets that underlie
certain types ofbehaviourthe atti¬
tude of some African women, for
instance, who paradoxically prefer
murky riverwater to the clean water
from a standpipe because "it has
some taste", the attitude of people
who pour used motor oil into the
sewage system, or that ofpeople who
have always burned down forests to
make clearings for grazing land.
UNEP and Unesco have put great
efforts into the establishment ofan
International Environmental Edu¬
cation Programme (IEEP). Some
excellent documents have been
produced, but they need to be made
more widely available, in more lan¬
guage versions and at lower cost,
and in any case a document, no
matter how good it is or how well
translated, is all but useless unless it
is adapted to the specific needs of its
intended readers. It is essential,
especially in the developing coun¬
tries, for local concerns and realities
to be understood, then explained
by respected community members.

There may also be serious con¬
flicts of interest between govern¬
ment departments. While one sells
large, sometimes excessive, quanti¬
ties ofwood in order to meet foreign
debt repayments, another builds
roads, and a third is looking for new
energy sources, the department
with responsibility for the environ¬
ment may not have an easy time
putting across its point ofview.
Effective environmental educa¬
tion may, however, trigger vast
movements of public opinion that
can sway government policy. When,
for example, it was planned to con¬
struct a hydroelectric dam at Nam
Choan in the Thung Yai Naresuan
Wildlife Sanctuary, the largest forest
in Thailand, a nationwide campaign
was immediately undertaken to
mentin the form of demonstra¬
tions, media campaigns or civil dis¬
obedience has subversive
overtones, as in the case of certain
confrontations staged by anti-
nuclear activists inWestern Europe,
or Greenpeace actions against
French underground nuclear tests
in the Pacific, while the seringueiro
(Brazilian rubber tapper) Chico
Mendes was murdered for wanting
to protect his forest.
To be credible, environmental
information must be objective and
must include and explain contra¬
dictoryviews. The nature ofthe polit¬
ical context is also of considerable
importance: those involved in envi¬
ronmental education must enjoy
civil rights and be legally protected.
Despite Unesco's efforts to
encourage press freedom, journalists
in many countries are all too often
Despite all the statements of
intent produced by international
conferences, development and the
protection of the environment still
do not live in harmony together.
"Powerful economic interests,"
explains an expert, "tend to threaten
both the livelihood of the local pop¬
ulation and the natural environ¬
ment." Environmental education
must adapt to this situation and
invent new strategies.

operation and Development (OECD),

WORLD
FORESTS-ADVANCE
AND RETREAT
The Forests Committee of the
United Nations Food and Agricul¬
ture Organization (FAO), meeting
in March 1993 in Rome, noted that
during the 1980s 154 million
hectares of tropical forest disap¬
peared, whereas forest resources in
the industrial countries grew.
According to an FAO study, forests
cover 56 per cent of the land sur¬
face area in Latin America and the
Caribbean, 24 per cent in Africa,
and 35 per cent in Asia where,
though this is the region where
deforestation has been most
intense, 26 million hectares were
reforested in the same period of
time. Forest cover in developed
countries is constantly increasing,
but the forest is under threat from
air pollution, fires, and certain wild
animals.

A SOLAR SUMMIT
The potential of solar power will be
discussed at a "World Solar Summit"
to be held at Unesco Headquarters
in Paris from 5 to 9 July 1993. The
meeting will take place exactly 20
years after a similar international
congress, "The Sun in the Service of
Mankind", helped to arouse interest
in solar energy. According to the
organizers, this year's event should
provide "an opportunity to take a
substantial step forward in formu¬
lating a World Plan of Action to
develop and use renewable energy
resources effectively". The term
"solar" is being used symbolically to
designate all renewable energy
resources and technologies, from
solar electricity to biomass, wind
and ocean power. But until oil
becomes more expensive or scarcer,
who will be prepared to invest
in projects that remain on the
drawing board forwant of real polit¬
ical support?
FUELLING A
CONTROVERSY
The Proalcool programme launched
in Brazil in 1975 appears to have
some drawbacks. Methanol, used
as a petrol substitute, is made from
sugar cane. In order to produce
more cane, the Atlantic forest in the
Nordeste province continues to be
cleared and has dwindled from one
million to 135,000 square kilome¬
tres. The Secretaries of the Envi¬
ronment of the states in this part of
the country are aware of the threat
and have joined in a forest conser¬
vation programme run by the orga¬
nization Mata Atlántica which is
alreadybeing put into effect in eight
southern and southeastern
Brazilian states. The $200-million
programme is supported by the
United Nations through Unesco.
Which is preferable: green fuel or a
green forest?
BLEACH VERSUS
BACTERIA
Research conducted in 1989 by Pro¬
fessor Dodin of the Institut Pasteur
in Paris confirmed that Javel water,
a common bleach containing
sodium hypochlorite, salt and
water, is one of the most powerful
and cheapest disinfectants avail¬
able. Two or three drops of 12°
bleach are enough to kill the bac¬
teria in a litre ofwater in thirty sec¬
onds, or to disinfect raw vegetables.
The advantage of this for the coun¬
tries of the South is that it obviates
the need to boil water, thereby
saving wood, while providing effec¬
tive protection against cholera.
What is more, this humble sub¬
stance is environment-friendly: it
self-destructs in the course of its
action, releasing oxygen and leaving
just a little salt behind.

RETURN OF THE GRAY WOLF
American environmentalists and the National Wildlife
Federation are campaigning to reintroduce the gray
wolf into Yellowstone National Park in the northwestern
United States. More than 80,000 wolves were killed in the
state of Montana between 1883 and 1918, and the
species completely disappeared from the area in the
1930s. Local farmers are not happy about a project
likely to expose their livestock to this ill-famed predator.
They argue that there are still plenty of gray wolves in
Alaska and Canada and that there is no real threat to the
survival of the species. The reintroduction of the lynx in
the French Vosges and Jura mountains poses a similar
problem: even though the move is theoretically
favourable to the balance of the ecosystem, it creates
hostility on the part of local people. Is it better to over¬
ride such objections or to accept a "simplification" of
nature? : ¿ù.. 3Ci
GULF MARINE LIFE IN JEOPARDY
A research vessel chartered by the U.S. National Oceanic
and Atmospheric Administration (NOAA) returned
from a six-month mission in the Gulfwith dismal news.
Marine life on the Saudi Arabian coasts has virtually dis¬
appeared and 90 per cent of the coral reefs off the coast
of Kuwait have been destroyed. The destruction of
Kuwaiti oil wells by the retreating Iraqi army sent some
1.3 billion litres of oil into the waters of the Gulf, 25
times as much as the wrecked tanker Exxon Valdez
spilled onto the coast ofAlaska in 1989. Whoever said

WHAT TO DO WITH WASTE?
According to the American nongovernmental organi¬
zation INFORM, the 180 million tonnes of waste gen¬
erated in the United States each year would form a
tower 42 kilometres high if packed tightly onto a foot¬
ball field. This evocative image is all the more dis¬
turbing because per capita garbage output is increasing,
while existing disposal sites are saturated and com¬
munities are opposed to new ones being established in
their neighbourhood. INFORM, which is backed by
foundation and government subsidies and by indi¬
vidual and corporate donations, aims to mobilize all the
interested parties. Among other activities, it publishes
simple waste-prevention advice for schools and a series
of intelligent, practical manuals. The contact address is:

1993, YEAR OF INDIGENOUS
PEOPLES
"We are just one more acting element in the biosphere,
no more and no less important than the others, and we
haven't the right to submit the other elements to our
excessive needs and our domination," writes Rémy
Kurtness, chiefof the Montagnais Council ofLac-Saint-
Jean in Quebec, Canada. The Montagnais people live on
a vast area located in Quebec and Labrador. "Our fore¬
fathers always rotated their hunting grounds, just like
farmers who periodically leave their lands fallow to let
the soil rest. Land can be productive as long as it is
respected. It cannot overproduce, and it certainly
cannot be bled to death." The United Nations has pro¬
claimed 1993 the Year of Indigenous Peoples, providing
an opportunity for everyone to share the wisdom of
those who love their land and are devoted to harmo¬
nizing development with nature and wildlife. 27

About 400 kilometres northwest
of Yaounde, the capital of
Cameroon, a small kingdom of
some 7,500 square kilometres,
perched 1,000 metres up on a
plateau, enjoys the good life.
From his residence in Foumban,
Sultan Ibrahim Mbombo Njoya
reigns over 350,000 Bamoun.
When he succeeded his father in
July 1992, he became the nine¬
teenth ruler of a dynasty founded,
so he claims, in the fourteenth
century. His grandfather built a
splendid three-storeyed ochre and
pink palace in 1920, its 60-metre-
long façade decorated with carved
wooden balconies. Unesco took
part in its renovation eight years
ago.
Blessed with very fertile land
and generous rainfall, the popula¬
tion is self-sufficient in food. Not
only are the trees all heavily laden
with fruit, but Foumban is also a
model of environmental manage¬
ment. Waste ground is weeded to
prevent poisonous snakes from
breeding there, and every available
square metre is cultivated. Beans,
corn and cassava grow in plots
alongside the footpaths, rows of
banana trees line the roadsides,
and the huge spear-like leaves of
the macabo sprout up above the
ditches. Foumban is a fine
example of the kind of urban gar¬
dens whose establishment is
encouraged by the United Nations
Food and Agriculture Organization
(FAO).

THE SIREN SONG OF
SlM-l)ETERNIi\ATIOi\
When empires
disintegrate, the logic
of self-determination
can be exploited by
extreme nationalist
ideologies, with
terrible consequences
¡X
'ATIONALISM ... is nothing without the
creation of nation-states, and a world of
such states, fitting the present ethnic-
linguistic criteria of nationality, is not a feasible
prospect today. . . . Only a handful of fanatics
would, it is safe to say, regard this achievement of
national/communal self-determination as more
than marginally better than an acutely unsatis¬
factory status quo."
So wrote the British historian Eric Hobs-
bawm in 1990, in his book Nations and Nation¬
alism since 1780. His prognosis is not untypical
of the views held by most observers on the eve of
the implosion of the Soviet empire. Almost invari¬
ably, speculation about the impending transfor¬
mations of Soviet communism stopped short of
"Balkanization" as a plausible scenario. Rational
choice arguments pointed to the senselessness
of trading "an unsatisfactory status quo" for the
uncertainties of ethno-regional self-determina¬
tion. On the left, much the same conclusion was
reached by advocates of the "proletarians have no
fatherland" thesis. But perhaps the most preva¬
lent assumption was that the collapse of com¬
munism necessarily implied the advent of "free-
market democracy", thus creating the very
inducements needed for the maintenance of
multinational state systems.
by René Lemarchand
Almost totally left out of the accounting was
the alternative scenario of crisis and anarchy now
unfolding in much of East and Central Europe.
In one state after another, from Georgia to Azer¬
baijan and from Tajikistan to Moldova, the ten¬
sions between human rights and newly acquired
national sovereignties have reached alarming pro¬
portions, with formerly oppressed minorities

asserting themselves as the principal vectors of
oppression and violence. Conversely, in most of
these states, the once dominant Russian majority
has been fragmented into embattled ethnic
minorities, up against chronic violence (as in
Moldova, Georgia and Tajikistan) and systematic
political discrimination (as in the Baltic
Republics).
The parallel with the massive re-ordering of
political loyalties that followed in the wake of
European decolonization can hardly go unno¬
ticed. Just as the impending withdrawal of colo¬
nial controls from much of Africa and Asia stim¬
ulated the rise of a host of nationalist and
ethno-regional movements, the advent of pere-
stroika has had a similarly catalytic effect on the
crystallization of ethnic claims and counter¬
claims. In Eastern Europe as in much of Africa
and Asia the logic of self-determination carries
within itself the seeds of seemingly endless con¬
flicts. As more and more ethnic groups seek to
reclassify themselves as potential nations, others
strenuously resist incorporation in the name of
their own claims to self-determination.
ETHNIC MANIPULATION
The violence that has accompanied the redrawing
of state boundaries bears ample testimony to the
threat posed to human rights and democracy by
the excesses of self-determination. Where group
rights defined in terms of assumed blood ties
and ethnicity are held up as a normative standard
against individual rights, there can be no basis for
democracy. The same is true of situations where
the claims of the majority are exercised to sup¬
press the rights of minorities. Implicit in such slo¬
gans as "Georgia for the Georgians", "Sri Lanka
for the Sinhalese" or "India for the Hindus" is the
denial of the hallowed notion that the test of a
democracy lies in its treatment of minorities.

Korem, Ethiopia (1985).

SO
Nowhere in the world does territorial sover¬
eignty coincide with ethnic identity. The bound¬
aries of the successor states of the Austro-Hun-
garian, Ottoman and Soviet empires are no less
artificial than the lines drawn by European col¬
onizers around their imperial domains in the last
century. Even in the case of so-called "ethnic
cleansing", new patterns of fragmentation are
bound to emerge behind the façade of shared
cultural commonalities.
"Ethnic cleansing": what the horribly anti¬
septic metaphor conveys is a definition of the
"other" as a vector of social contamination. The
intent, in short, is to give moral justification to the
physical suppression of culturally distinct com¬
munities. Whether defined in terms of religion,
language or other cultural traits, real or assumed,
ethnic minorities often end up being the prime

targets of ethnic cleansing. The most important
point, however, is that in almost every instance the
"other" is being redefined, recontextualized, and
in the process almost dehumanized. The Holo¬
caust is an extreme example of how the dehu-
manization of an entire group of people helps jus¬
tify its physical annihilation. A strikingly similar
phenomenon lies behind the genocidal killings in
Bosnia, where Muslims are now being reduced to
a sub-human category by certain ideologues, and
treated as such.
Politicized ethnicity does not invariably trans¬
late into genocidal violence; yet it always involves
a measure of political manipulation. Contrary
to what is often assumed, ethnic nationalism does
not just emerge full-blown from the mists of his¬
tory. It is the product of complex social and eco¬
nomic forces often set in motion under the aegis
of the colonial state. The critical factor, however,
is the part played by ethnic entrepreneurs in
stimulating the awakening of a collective self-
awareness.
If ethno-nationalism is first and foremost
manipulated nationalism, in this process histor¬
ical memory plays a crucial role. It mixes facts
with fiction, it squeezes reality into symbolic
frames and invests the past with new meanings.
"Imagined communities" thus take on a reality of
their own. The ties that bind are not blood ties or
kinship ties but what Paul Veyne calls "l'imagi¬
nation constituante". It is sadly ironic that some
of the worst examples of ethnic killings should
have happened among communities that are cul¬
turally almost indistinguishable, and which for
centuries had lived in peace with each other.

a form of political manipulation are nowhere
more evident than in the exalted brand of ethnic
chauvinism exhibited by the extremists who set
themselves the task of "cleansing" Bosnia of
Muslim and Croat elements. While the first are
seen as a living reminder of Turkish domination,
and are collectively referred to as Turks even
though none are able to speak a word of Turkish,
the second are collectively identified with the
horrors of the Nazi-installed Croatian fascist
state during the Second World War. Totally oblit¬
erated from the collective consciousness is the fact
that Serbs, Croats and Muslims lived at peace
with each other for centuries prior to the Second
World War. This is where the resistance of the
people of Sarajevo carries a powerful demon¬
stration effect: it demonstrates that communi¬
ties of mixed origins can indeed live in harmony.

violence in south Ossetia

ESCALATING VIOLENCE
Again, to see in the savage bloodletting in Ayo-
dhya and elsewhere in India nothing more than
an age-old antagonism between Hindus and Mus¬
lims misses the point. Rather than a religious
confrontation between mosque and temple, what
is at issue here is a conflict of nationalist ideolo¬
gies activated through the symbolic manipulation
of Ram and Babur, the first identified with the
most potent of all gods in the Hindu pantheon,
the second with an alien, Turkic-Mongol con¬
queror. In the contemporary discourse of Hindu
fundamentalists the myth of Ram encapsulated
in the ubiquitous slogan of "Jai Sri Ram!" ("Hail
to the Lord Ram!") emerges as a powerful
symbol of cultural identity and a rallying-cry
against the Moghul conquerors. Behind the threat
posed to the survival of Muslim communities
also lies a major challenge to the spirit of tolerance
and mutual respect embedded in what was once
known as the "Hindustani culture" the fragile
fusion of Hindu and Muslim influences which
also formed a major ingredient of the Nehru
brand of liberal Indian nationalism.
The claims embodied in the principle of self-
determination are made all the more explosive by
the external dimensions of ethnic strife. Where
cultural affinities transcend the domestic arena
and serve as poles of attraction for the interven¬
tion of outside forces, or as a pretext for retalia¬
tion against minorities in neighbouring states,
successful conflict resolution becomes very dif¬
ficult indeed. Domestic conflict inevitably triggers
inter-state ethnic conflict; each feeds on the other,
thus generating a nightmarish sequence of inter¬
locking violence.
To recognize the primacy of ethnic particu¬
larity is to acknowledge the rights of minorities.
In looking for ways of protecting these rights
we need to rethink the responsibilities of the
international community. As has now become
dramatically clear, the threats posed to minorities
through the "excesses of self-determination"
carry implications that go far beyond the bound¬
aries of existing state systems. The massive exodus
of refugee populations into neighbouring areas
imperils their political stability, generates fresh

insuperable burdens on their economies.
Although the tasks ahead are daunting, the time
has come to invest the United Nations security
system with a new mandate, one that would not
simply reaffirm the rights of minorities but stip¬
ulate the rules and criteria under which the use of
force can be internationally sanctioned and
brought into effect. ^

How far is
the integration
of Europe's
immigrant workers
really possible?
GUESTS, IMMIGRANTS,
MINORITIES
by Riva Kastoryano
Turkish immigrants play
chess in Rome (1990). I
I ^1 HE modern nation-state, which is based on
a universalist ideology, invented the con¬
cept of citizenship so as to include all
people, irrespective of the communities to which
they belong, as individuals with equal rights. But
the cultural, linguistic and religious diversity of
modern societies has persisted, to the point where
the notion of minorities has re-emerged.
The term minority refers to a community
which organizes itself around an identity that
is different from that of society as a whole,
which expresses that difference publicly and
demands to be recognized for what it is. Such
minorities may be religious, national or ethnic.
National minorities demand recognition of a
territory of their own within the nation-state.
Regional minorities put forward certain spe
cific claims arising out of their geographical
location.
Ethnic minorities are more difficult to define
precisely, since they encompass the twin con¬
cepts of cultural community and social class. In
the United States, for example, in spite of the
cultural diversity on which the nation is based,
people disadvantaged not only by their ethnic,
racial, national or religious origin, but also by
social class, are designated as minorities. .
In Europe, the large-scale immigration that
has taken place since the 1960s has created sim¬
ilar situations. Yet in contrast to the practice in the
United States, immigrant populations in Europe
are not defined as minorities, but as immigrés
("immigrants") in France and as Gastarbeiter
("guest workers") in Germany and Switzerland. 33

RIVA KASTORYANO,
of France, is currently carrying
out research at the Centre for
International Studies and
Research, Paris, on the
expression of identities and
community action among
migrants in Europe. Among
her publications are Etre turc
en France: Réflexions sur familles
et communauté (L'Harmattan
publishers, Paris, 1986) and
"Integration and expression of
collective identities of migrants
in France and Germany", a
study which appeared in the
Journal of Ethnic Studies
(1992).
Behind these differences in terminology, which
reflect the influence of national thinking on the
subject, a convergence between European immi¬
gration and integration policies can be seen.
Immigration in Europe grew out of efforts to
promote economic reconstruction after years of
war and stagnation. Some states, such as Ger¬
many, signed bilateral agreements with coun¬
tries of the Mediterranean basin. Others, such as
France, the United Kingdom and the Nether¬
lands, opened their doors to the peoples of their
former colonies. Some, such as Germany, laid
down a specific policy on immigration. Others,
such as France and the United Kingdom, implic¬
itly acknowledged that foreign workers were
there to stay for some time. The immigrant
workers themselves saw their situation as an
opportunity to move up the social ladder back in
their home countries. This economically-driven
immigration movement was thus seen by both
sides as a temporary expedient.
Today the fact that the immigrants and their
families have settled permanently is paralleled
by forms of integration that vary from group to
group and from country to country. The ways in
which immigrant communities set about orga
nizing themselves are strongly influenced by the
historical, economic, cultural and political links
between their countries of origin and the host
countries. Even so, a common pattern of activity
can be discerned. In every country, immigrants
mobilize in a bid to achieve equal rights to jobs
and housing; they fight discrimination; they react
against racism; and they seek to obtain some
form of political representation that will bring
them respect and recognition.
SHAKE» LOYALTIES
Demands for a say in political matters are voiced
through a variety of associations. Since the 1 980s,
almost every European nation has seen the rapid
spread of associations of this type catering specif¬
ically for the children of immigrants. The net¬
works they form, which are based on shared
national and religious loyalties, become chan¬
nels for a mutual aid system providing, among
other things, basic legal information on such
matters as entry and residence rights and for¬
malities, employment and housing.

status, the associations promote his or her inte¬
gration into society through language and lit¬
eracy courses for adults and education and
training programmes for the young. They also
organize debates, concerts and other types of
performance to increase public awareness of the
group's indigenous culture and to make people
more responsive to their particular situation.
These associations depend for their survival
largely on government grants to the main sectors
involved in the integration process, such as
employment, housing and community life. In
its support for socio-cultural activities, the gov¬
ernment encourages community events such as
the celebration of national holidays. Govern¬
ments regard the right granted to foreigners, as a
legally recognized category, to form associations
as being primarily aimed at encouraging civic
equality. However, some researchers see this sup¬
port as a deliberate policy to perpetuate the
minority status of immigrants, since in their view
the authorities are intent on controlling the types
of organization created, on steering the immigrant
population in a given direction, and, if neces¬
sary, mobilizing it for that purpose.
Through the associations, the immigrants'

sense of identity is strengthened and they are all the
more eager to win recognition for their distinctive
features. They also establish new ties in which
economic, social and political interests go hand in
hand with the desire to assert their identity, a
desire that prompts them to negotiate with the
authorities and the machinery of the state. Even in
a political context in which citizenship is seen as
the only path to integration, this approach is two-
edged, insofar as it establishes a defacto minority
status.
In the debate on immigration in France, the
term "minority" is never used, since the French
state has traditionally regarded itself as universalist
and secular. In Germany the word has a very
different connotation. The idea of the German
nation, founded on a community of culture, lan¬
guage and even blood, rules out all cultural dif¬
ferences. Since, by their very nature, they cannot
belong to a nation defined in these terms, the
Gastarbeiter also referred to as Ausländer ("for¬
eigners") or as ausländische Mitbürger ("foreign
fellow-citizens") claim minority status and
demand a policy on minorities that will secure
their political recognition.
The Netherlands is the only European country
that expressly refers to "minorities", although
they are still not defined as a legal category. Minori¬
ties have been officially described as "caravan-
dwellers and legal residents such as Indians, Suri¬
namese, Gypsies, refugees and migrants". In order
to create conditions conducive to their emanci¬
pation, the formation of groups on a national or
religious basis is encouraged. These are assured of
playing an active part in social and political life as
pressure groups.
In the United Kingdom, according to John
Rex, the immigrant communities are not simply
ethnic groups seeking to preserve their cultural
identity and negotiate their status as minorities
with society as a whole. They are more ambitious
in that they seek to work in conjunction with the
nation's institutions in order to win the support
of majority opinion.
The prospect of a united Europe reopens the
whole issue of the integration strategies of the var¬
ious countries. Fresh scope for negotiation,
extending further than the framework of the
nation-state, is emerging for all national and reli¬
gious communities. In years to come, minority
status will have to be based on a multicultural
conception of citizenship. In a society that has
raised the banner of multiculturalism on the insti¬
tutional, national, regional and even religious
levels, the assertion of minority identity will
come to seem the only real course of action. 35

A SENSE OF
DIFFERENCE

the world's
minorities
Young aborigines

(Australia).
WAT HAT are the usual criteria by which a
minority group can be identified? In
the case of ethnic or cultural minori¬
ties, the first criterion is that of language. A group
using a language different from that of the majority
in the midst of which its members live, like the
Armenian community in exile or the Jews in nine¬
teenth-century Russia, is clearly a minority. The
same applies to peoples such as the Kurds in Iran
or the Welsh in the United Kingdom, who live in
a specific region of a state and speak a different lan¬
guage from that of the state.
The linguistic criterion is far from conclu¬
sive, however. A variety of identity "tags", such
as religion, or cultural factors such as tradition,
can also help to give people a sense of identity as
members of a minority.
We shall therefore adopt a definition that is
more subjective than objective and say that a
group constitutes a minority when it feels from
experience that it is in a minority in relation to the
environment in which it lives. Account must
therefore be taken of its culture, language, tradi¬
tions or religion.

RELIGIOUS, CULTURAL AN»
ETHNIC MINORITIES
The first and probably most obvious category of
minority is that based on religious affiliation.
This is more than just a statistical phenomenon.
The fact that there may be more Protestants than
Catholics in, say, Germany or the United States
does not mean that the Catholics can be said to be
a minority. For a religious group to be in a
minority situation, this situation must be con¬
spicuous enough for it to give rise to a sense of
vulnerability or even inferiority. By this crite¬
rion, the Bahais of Iran, the Copts of Egypt and
the Mennonites of Russia are minorities. The
same criterion has applied for some years now to
the Muslims in India and the Hindus in Pakistan
and Bangladesh.
So-called "cultural" minorities constitute

another important category, although one that is
mentioned less often and is sometimes ques¬
tioned. Their "difference" is not, strictly speaking,
one of language or religion. One such case is that
of the Jews who in some countries speak dif¬
ferent languages from most of the population,
even though some of these languages, such as
Ladino or Yiddish, could be described as "ethnic
languages". Here, religious affiliation often only
represents a symbolic form of loyalty to an iden¬
tity that has a number of other defining features,
such as dietary practices, humour and a long tra¬
dition of persecution. A similar situation is found
among the Gypsies, who show an awareness of
their identity that goes beyond differences of
language and religion.
When we come to the third category the
ethnic or national minorities which account for by
far the largest number of minority situations we
enter a problem area in which a distinction has to
be made between several sub-categories.
The first of these sub-categories is that of abo¬
riginal or tribal populations who live outside the
mainstream of present-day society and continue
to practise their ancestral customs. These groups,
which are often almost on the verge of extinction
because their way of life is out of step with the
modern world, include ethnic groups as different
as the Pygmies of Cameroon, the Aborigines of
Australia, the Miao of central Vietnam or the
Indians of the Mato Grosso in Brazil. Their situ¬
ation is in many respects different from that of the
other groups. They are specifically considered as
"indigenous peoples" by the United Nations.
Another sub-category consists of those peo¬
ples who are widely scattered and who, although
speaking a common language, do not have a
country of origin or attachment. This is the case

of the Assyro-Chaldeans, or Assyrians, in the
Middle East and of the Vlachs in Europe. These
peoples, which tend not to be numerous, are par¬
ticularly vulnerable.
There are also the relatively rare cases of what
might be termed "majority" minorities, peoples
which comprise the majority of the population in
terms of numbers but are relegated to de facto
"minority" status in the country in which they live.
Among these peoples are the Quechua Indians of
Ecuador and the Blacks of South Africa.
Another category is that of the "territorial"
minorities, which have traditionally occupied a
specific area which they regard as their "ethnic"
or "national" territory. Members of this cate¬
gory include the Berbers, the Kurds, the Cata¬
lans, the German-speakers of the South Tyrol,
and the Maris (people of Finno-Ugric stock
living in the Urals), all of whom have long
occupied regions which they regard as their
"homeland", to which they are bound by col¬
lective memories that form the bedrock of their
"systems of symbols".
In many cases, they owe their situation as
minorities to border changes, particularly as a
result of the creation of new states. These changes
suddenly put them on the other side of a border,
along with other minority peoples from different
ethnic groups. The partition of Czechoslovakia
in 1993, which has left some Slovaks in "Czechia"
and some Czechs in Slovakia, is one such problem
area. These "contingent minorities", as they are
sometimes called, can be contrasted with other
minorities whose status might be said to be their
"essence". The latter traditionally regard them¬
selves as minorities and belong to two types,
"colonies" deliberately settled by a ruling power
for military or economic purposes, and "landless
nations" like the Gypsies.
The sense of identity varies significantly
between different groups, regardless of their size.
The factors that determine the extent of a people's
resistance to assimilation are still not fully under¬
stood. Our own time, when "progress" and "con-
sumerist" standardization are undermining iden¬
tities and differences almost everywhere, also
happens to coincide with a juncture when those
identities and differences are being strongly
asserted. When peoples are sucked into processes
of levelling down and standardization, they seem
to generate "differentiating antibodies" that inten¬
sify their sense of identity and prompt them to
seek greater autonomy.
Whatever the cause and significance of this
paradox may be, it is certain that people cannot
be robbed with impunity of the stabilizing and
comforting ethos of an identity fully accepted and
expressed. To uproot people and. repress their
identity is to breed anxiety among them and
destroy their sense of community. The choice
today may lie between urban riots and Sarajevo-
type situations on the one hand and on the other
the harmonious and unfettered development of
identities from which all features incompatible
with the dignity of the human person have been
banished.

(Paris, 1992).
I ^| HERE are no minorities in multinational
states such as the Switzerland and Belgium
of today, the Soviet Union of yesterday, and
the Austria-Hungary, the Ottoman Empire and
the Kingdom of Piedmont-Sardinia of earlier
times. In such cases state and nation do not nec¬
essarily coincide. The existence of several nations
within the state is taken for granted. No distinc¬
tion is made between majority and minorities.
Nor do minorities exist in the state-based
nation-state, in which the state is formed before
the emergence of the nation, which takes shape
within that pre-established mould. The two enti¬
ties thus automatically coincide. This is true of the
oldest states of Western Europe, such as France,
Great Britain, the Netherlands, Spain and Por¬
tugal, and also of the United States. The various
ethnic minorities which live in states of this
kind Bretons or Scots for example feel that
they belong not only to the state but also to the
nation French or British as the case may be.
A national minority can only exist in a nation-
based nation-state, in which the state is formed
after the nation becomes conscious of its existence
and with the avowed aim of modelling itself apos-
teriori on an already existing nation. Since the
frontiers of the two entities never entirely coin¬
cide, there are bound to be national minorities.
This is the situation throughout central Europe,
from Italy to Estonia, from Germany to Greece.
The creation of states of this type was one of
the great ambitions of the victors of the First
World War, and this is why the peace treaties of
1919 and the League of Nations drew up a body
of legislation on national minorities. The mem¬
bers of these minorities were to have the same
individual rights as other citizens and thus be
protected against any discriminatory measures.
They could also demand the recognition of col¬
lective rights concerning the use of their lan¬
guage, education and the protection of their cul¬
ture. But the instruments adopted between the
wars did not provide for them to be granted a
third possible type of freedom: that of territorial
autonomy.
These rights were poorly implemented in the
1920s and were later systematically flouted by fas¬
cist regimes. They were ignored altogether under
communism. Today they are back on the agenda.
THE IAN» OF THE
SOUTHERN SLAVS
In this respect the example of the Yugoslav or
southern Slav territory has been unique in this
century. What were the key stages in the forma¬
tion of this area?
Before 1914, the kingdom of Serbia was the
quintessence of the nation-based nation-state. It
was homogeneous until 1912 because the non-
Serbian (Turkish and Albanian) elements had
been expelled during the previous century. It
took in Albanian, Macedonian, Turkish and other
minorities during the Balkan Wars (1912-1913)
but without recognizing that they had any rights.
Between 1914 and 1941, having in the mean¬
time become Yugoslavia, the kingdom doubled in
area. Its subjects now included Croats, Slovenes, 39

Muslim Bosnians, Germans and Hungarians,
among others. And yet officially it remained a
nation-state thanks to the fiction of the "Yugoslav
nation" subdivided into three "tribes" (pleme):
Serbs, Croats and Slovenes (the other Yugoslav
nations did not count). Thus the state, in which
the Serbs were numerically preponderant (com¬
prising some 40 per cent of the population), was
supposed to consist of a "Yugoslav" majority
(some 85 per cent) and non-Slav minorities.
Between 1945 and 1991, Tito's Yugoslavia
abandoned the fiction of the "Yugoslav nation",
which the horrors of the Second World War had
brought to a bloody end, and officially became a
multinational state, recognizing six southern Slav
peoples as distinct nations: the Serbs, the Croats,
the Slovenes, the Macedonians, the Montene¬
grins and somewhat later the "Muslims"
(Bosnians). The unitary kingdom became a fed¬
eral republic. The Yugoslav communists thus
followed the example set a quarter of a century
earlier by the Soviets, who had transformed the
Russian empire, dominated by a single nation,
into a multinational federation, the USSR.
But Stalin had drawn the logical or at least
terminological conclusions from this change.
The Russian communists had championed the
rights of the various non-Russian peoples of the
empire, designated by the term "national
minority" (natsmen). In the USSR, majority and
minorities officially ceased to exist; there were
only large or small nations, all theoretically equal.
In Yugoslavia on the other hand, in spite of the
transition to a multinational state, the hierarchy
between "nation" (narod) and "minority" (man-
jina) was maintained. The former term was used
to designate the six southern Slav nations, while
the latter referred to the other non-southern-
Slav peoples, such as the Albanians, the Hun¬
garians, the Gypsies and the Turks. In 1963 the
term "minority", which was felt to be pejorative,
was replaced by that of "nationality" (narod-
nost), but the same ranking order continued to
exist. Official language referred to "nations and
nationalities", but a term encompassing the two
was never invented. The logic of the multina¬
tional state was not fully applied: some peoples
were more equal than others.
This hierarchy of peoples was paralleled by
a hierarchy of territories. The federation com¬
prised six republics; in other words there were
as many republics as there were "nations". Each
nation was thus "constitutive" of at least one
republic. Attached to the republic of Serbia,
however, there were also "autonomous
provinces", corresponding to the existence of
"minorities". These were Kosovo, where there
was an Albanian "minority" (sic) which
accounted for 68 per cent of the population in
1948 (90 per cent today), and Vojvodina, where
non-Serbs totalled 49 per cent of the population
in 1948 (43 per cent today).
The history of the federation was marked
from start to finish by hesitations over the status
of the autonomous provinces, especially Kosovo.
The provinces enjoyed very limited autonomy at
the outset, but this grew until in the last consti¬
tution adopted under Tito, that of 1974, it almost
PASSOVER IN
SARAJEVO
by Léon Davico
Sarajevo: 7 April this year.
The place: the old synagogue, miracu¬
lously still standing, although its windows
are shattered.
The time: 12:30 p.m.
The weather is fine. There is relatively
little shooting. The little street, usually
empty, is full of onlookers, policemen and
armed soldiers. Everyone is waiting for
President Izetbegovic.
Inside the synagogue there is an unusual
bustle of activity. PesachPassoveris
being celebrated for the 500th time since the
first Sephardic Jews arrived here in search
of a quiet spot where they could take refuge
from the Inquisition.
Quieter spots than this could be imag-
40 ined.
At the same moment, a few blocks
away, at the Academy of Sciences, a sym¬
posium on the damage suffered by the city
during a year's shelling is about to open.
For some reason, there is no shelling
today. There is the usual machine-gun and
automatic rifle fire, but people hardly notice
it any more.
A hundred-odd townspeople, Jews and
non-Jews, are packed into the little room on
the left of the main entrance. The table has
been carefully laid by the women and girls.
In front of each guest is an egg, dark brown
from being boiled for hours with onion
peelings. Where have they managed to find
the onions? And the eggs?
"Eggs were cheaper at the market yes¬
terday. Two dollars each," the secretary
tells me. "We shall read the Haggadah, the
Passover service there is a famous copy
printed in Sarajevo, but it is well protected
and we shan't touch it."
The President arrives, sombre and
thoughtful. He has just refused to send
General Halilovic to a meeting with the
Serb and Croat generals chaired by Gen¬
erals Wahlgren and Morillon at Sarajevo
airport. Fighting continues at Srebenica,
and until there is a cease-fire around this
town in eastern Bosnia, he does not wish to
negotiate.
Surrounded by bodyguards, he enters
the synagogue, followed by members of the
government. Two minutes later the Rei ul
Ulema, the religious leader of all the Muslims
of former Yugoslavia, arrives, at almost the
same moment as the Catholic archbishop,
Monsignor Puljic, and the former leader of
the Orthodox community, whose replace¬
ment has not yet reached Sarajevo because of
the war. They take their places around the
table and listen to Ivica Ceresnjes, presi¬
dent of the city's Jewish community. They
know each other well; their communities
have lived together for five centuries.

equalled that of the republics, before being bru¬
tally suppressed in 1989-1990.
In 1991 the federation broke up into five
states, one remaining multinational (Bosnia) and
the other four being nation-states (Slovenia,
Croatia, Serbia-Montenegro, Macedonia). With
the exception of Slovenia (which is virtually
homogeneous), these states contain minorities.
The largest of these (each comprising over 300,000
persons) are the Serb minority in Croatia, the
Albanian and Hungarian minority in Serbia-
Montenegro, and the Albanian minority in Mace
donia. Bosnia, by virtue of its constitution, is the
common territory of three peoples: Muslims (44
per cent), Serbs (31 per cent) and Croats (17 per
cent).
THE STEAMROLLER
OF HIERARCHY
But the consequences of the hierarchy estab¬
lished in Tito's time between "nations" and
"minorities" can still be felt. Everything sug¬
gests that the Serbs regarded the status of "nation"
Bosnian Muslims executed
at the entry to their
village.
Fifty years ago, between 1941 and 1945,
the harmony was interrupted. Tens of thou¬
sands of Bosnians were killed during a ter¬
rible war. Nine-tenths of the Jewish popu¬
lation were annihilated, and the rest hid in
the homes of their Muslim, Serb and Croat
friends. Then, with the return of peace, the
survivors came back to Sarajevo to take up
again the life of their community, shattered
by foreign aggression.
Aware of their unique situation, the
Jews of Sarajevo have always been
extremely cosmopolitan. One marriage in
three was a mixed marriage. When misfor¬
tune again struck the people of this
Olympic city on 7 April last year, the
Jewish community numbered 5,000 1,000
Jews and 4,000 Muslims, Serbs and Croats,
wives and husbands, cousins, uncles and
aunts, or simply friends affiliated to the
community. About a thousand children
and old people have left the city to escape
death, but the other 4,000 have remained
and form one of the world's most tightly-
knit groups. They are now virtually insep¬
arable. Each day they come to the syna¬
gogue for a meal, one after the other.
Opposite, in the pharmacy which belongs
to the community, medicines from abroad
are dispensed to the people of Sarajevo free
of charge. All they have to do is show a
medical prescription.
His prayer shawl over his shoulders,
Ceresnjes speaks of tolerance, friendship
and peace. People listen gravely, making
no attempt to hide their tears. Outside,
close by, death lies in wait, ethnic cleansing
is going on, a sermon of hate, not love, is
being preached. The guests eat their eggs
two dollars is a small investment for a
friendly meal and unleavened bread, as
the matzo wafers have somehow got lost
between New York and the little street in
Sarajevo. Speaker follows speaker; each
one talks of peace, but seemingly without
great conviction. They want peace but don't
quite know how to achieve it or whether it
can be achieved. They want the madness to
stop and multi-ethnic families to be able to
continue their lives without fear. No one
talks of happiness. That will have to wait.
Meanwhile, a candle is lit. The flame is
small but it has vast significance. It is the
flame of tolerance, the flame of survival.
The ceremony is over. People shake
hands, embrace. They go back to the cellars.
Take care at the intersections even if there
is no shelling, there are always the snipers.
Where there are trees there is danger, so
move quickly. If they were not dangerous
places, people would have chopped the
trees down long ago for firewood. But now
spring is here and perhaps there will be no
need for wood and fire.
The little flame burns on, a last flame of
hope that soon this nightmare will be over
and these Jews and Muslims, Serbs and
Croats of Sarajevo will be able to live a
new life together.
Will they be given this last chance?

for themselves and that of "minority" for others
as a privilege to be enjoyed in perpetuity.
Their refusal to be a "minority" in Croatia led
to the outbreak of war against that country in the
summer of 1 99 1 and to the setting-up of a seat of
Serb power ("the Serb Republic of Krajina") on
at least one-quarter of Croat territory, as well as
to the expulsion of non-Serbs, representing about
half the population (200,000 to 300,000 persons).
In Bosnia, where there is no majority nation
and where their status as a "constitutive people"
is not disputed, the Serbs are afraid of being in the
minority (in the Parliamentary meaning of the
term) in face of a possible coalition of the other
two peoples, and also reject the independent
Bosnian state. This led to the war which they
unleashed in April 1992 in a bid to hive off and
create an ethnically pure "Serb Republic" in
Bosnia, covering two-thirds of the land area. The
outcome so far has been to create two million
refugees.
In Serbia on the other hand, the authorities
proclaim the rights of the "majority" vis-à-vis the
"minorities", and consequently the territorial
autonomy of Kosovo and Vojvodina, provinces
peopled by "minorities", has been suppressed.
Outside Serbia the rights of Serb minorities are
being defended to the point of secession, while
within Serbia itself the rights of non-Serb minori¬
ties are being whittled away to zero, if necessary
by forcible expulsion; in other words, the object
is to change the frontiers of Serbia wherever the
latter leave Serbs outside, but to preserve them
intact in cases where they include non-Serbs.
What aim can the international community set
itself in view of this strategy? The preservation of
existing frontiers is an absolute principle for want
of which the whole of Europe would again be
plunged into the nightmare of wars of conquest.
It must be saved from such a fate On the other
hand, the nation-based nation-state is a very
potent aspiration in this part of the world, and one
that it would be vain to oppose. In other words
there are bound to be minorities and they will
have to be protected.
The only valid aim would be to adopt an
international law on minorities that would guar¬
antee individual and collective rights to each and
every one of them, but not necessarily the right
to territorial autonomy, which only shifts the
problem by creating a minority within a minority.
There should be a long-term commitment on
the part of the United Nations to make sure that
this law is respected on the ground: This regime
should be applied wherever the problem arises,
not only where conflicts have already erupted.
Bosnia is the only existing multinational state in
central Europe, and should be protected as such.
Here too, the United Nations should make a
long-term commitment through some form of
mandate arrangement.
Some might say that this is a Utopian view. It
is true that the forces opposing such a solution
currently have the upper hand. But if action is
undertaken, there is no other aim it can pursue.
The only alternatives are expulsions, "ethnic
cleansing" and wars everywhere.

ranee of what is going on in Bosnia
today or of what is at stake there.
No longer can anyone maintain that there
is nothing to choose between the lawful
representatives of the sovereign state of
Bosnia-Herzegovina and the massed forces
of "ethnic cleansing" that are near to having
destroyed it.
The international media have seen to
that: the press and, more especially, radio
and television show us day in and day out
how the tide of horror is inexorably rising,
detailing the plight of the refugees, the con¬
centration camps, the murders of children
and the mass rapes; writers and artists of all
political persuasions are becoming per¬
sonally involved; and the resolutions of
the United Nations Security Council are
becoming increasingly urgent.
Everyone has now begun to realize that
what is happening in Bosnia-Herzegovina
is much more than a local conflict between
rival communities; it is the clash of two
outlooks that exist in all societies the world
over: one that is humanist and open, and
that opts for pluralist democracy, and, on
the other hand, one that yields to the temp¬
tation to create a supposedly "pure" ethnic
entity by force. Everyone knows politi¬
cians in particular that there is nothing
more contagious, in the long run, than that
temptation, and that there is no greater
threat to world peace, as the Holocaust of
fifty years ago reminds us.
How is it, then, that the irreparable has
been allowed to happen? How has it come
about that victory seems to have been con¬
ceded defacto to the ethnic cleansing cam¬
paign?
Why, despite the total involvement of
the mass media, whose awesome power
has recently been brought to bear to alter
decisively the course of world events, has
nothing been done to prevent a disaster
that everyone foresaw and everyone has
denounced?
Why?

The long struggle
to provide
international
protection for
minorities
A PROTECTIVE FKAMI!WORK
by Janusz Symonides
44
JANUSZ SYMONIDES,
an internationally known
Polish lawyer, has been
Director of UNESCO's Division
of Human Rights and Peace
since 1989. He is the author of
more than 350 publications
(including 17 books), on
human rights, international
control, the law of the sea, the
protection of the environment,
international security, and the
theory of international
relations.
INTERNATIONAL regulations concerning the
protection of minorities go back to 1555
when, for the first time, the Peace of Augs¬
burg provided for the protection of religious
minorities. Later the Treaty of Westphalia in 1 648
and the Polish-Russian Conventions of 1767 and
1775 guaranteed rights of dissidents in Poland,
while the Vienna Treaty of 1815 gave religious
minorities not only freedom of faith but also cer¬
tain civil rights. Again, relatively far-reaching
obligations concerning the protection and equality
of all subjects were imposed on Turkey and the
Balkan States in 1 878 by the Treaty of Berlin.
The struggle of various national and religious
minorities to establish their independence in
Central and Eastern Europe was a prominent
factor in the First World War. Post-war treaties
provided for the protection of racial, religious or
linguistic minorities in these newly independent
states. The League of Nations was to supervise
imposed obligations, and violations were subject
to action by the League.
The United Nations Secretariat in 1947 took
the view that the League of Nations minority
system had ceased to exist, and favoured a new,
universal and individualistic conception of human
rights. United Nations action and standard-set¬
ting instruments were at that time dominated by
the individualistic concept of non-discrimina¬
tion and equality. The Universal Declaration of
Human Rights did not mention the "protection
of minorities", though during the debate pro¬
posals in this respect were presented. They were
rejected because of a fear that they might create
incentives for separatist tendencies and move
ments. In consequence, the Universal Declaration
contains only general clauses prohibiting dis¬
crimination.
The concept of protection of persons
belonging to minorities but not that of minori¬
ties themselves was accepted in the Interna¬
tional Covenant on Civil and Political Rights,
which declares: "In those States in which ethnic,
religious or linguistic minorities exist, persons
belonging to such minorities should not be denied
the right, in community with the other mem¬
bers of their group, to enjoy their own culture, to
profess and practise their own religion, or to use
their own language".
Similarly, the UNESCO Convention Against
Discrimination in Education (1960) takes into
account the right of persons belonging to minori¬
ties: ". . . It is essential to recognize the right of
members of national minorities to carry on their
own educational activities, including the main¬
tenance of schools and, depending on the educa¬
tional policy of each state, the use or the teaching
of their own language".
Among UNESCO Declarations, two are of
special importance for the recognition of the col-'
lective rights of minorities: the Declaration on
Race and Racial Prejudice (1978) which provides
that "All individuals and groups have the right to
be different, to consider themselves as different
and to be regarded as such", and the Declaration
of the Principles of International Cultural Co¬
operation stipulating that: "1. Each culture has a
dignity and value which must be respected and
preserved. 2. Every people has the right and the
duty to develop its culture".

The protection of minority rights has been
particularly advanced in the European region
within the Conference on Security and Cooper¬
ation in Europe (CSCE) process. The Helsinki
Final Act adopted in 1975 proclaimed that: "The
participating States on whose territory national
minorities exist will respect the right of persons
belonging to such minorities to equality before
the law, will afford the full opportunity for the
actual enjoyment of human rights and funda¬
mental freedoms and will, in this manner, protect
their legitimate interests in this sphere". This
formulation was in line with the concept still
prevailing in the 1970s that the elimination of
any discrimination, guarantees of equality before
the law, and the full enjoyment of human rights
and fundamental freedoms satisfy all claims that
persons belonging to minorities may present.
The Concluding Document of the Madrid
follow-up meeting, adopted in 1983, stressed the
importance of constant progress in ensuring the
respect for an actual enjoyment of the rights of
persons belonging to national minorities. A step
forward was made during the Vienna follow-up
meeting. In a new international atmosphere, at the
time of perestroïka and the elimination of ideo¬
logical controversies between East and West, the
Vienna Concluding Document, adopted in 1989,
imposed on participating states the duty of cre¬
ating conditions for the promotion of the ethnic,
cultural, linguistic and religious identity of
national minorities on their territory.
The 1990 Copenhagen meeting of the Con¬
ference on the Human Dimension of the CSCE
assumed that questions concerning national
minorities can only be solved within the frame¬
work of democratic policies based on the exis¬
tence of a state of law, effective judicial control of
government, pluralism and tolerance.
The Charter of Paris adopted by the CSCE
Summit Meeting on 21 November 1990 con
firmed that the ethnic, cultural, linguistic and
religious identity of national minorities should be
protected and conditions for the promotion of
that identity should be created.
In 1992, during the CSCE follow-up meeting
in Helsinki, a decision was taken to nominate a
High Commissioner for National Minorities.
The High Commissioner has no competence to
ajudicate but only to provide "early warning"
and, as appropriate, "early actions" at the earliest
possible stage in regard to tensions involving
national minority issues which have, in his
opinion, the potential to develop into a conflict
within the CSCE area, affecting peace, stability or
relations between participating states.
On 18 December 1992, the General Assembly
of the United Nations adopted the Declaration on
the Rights of Persons Belonging to National or
Ethnic, Religious and Linguistic Minorities. The
Declaration formulates the obligation of states to
protect the existence and identity of minorities
within their respective territories. Among the
rights of persons belonging to minorities, it lists:
the right to enjoy their own culture; to profess and
practise their own religion; to use their own lan¬
guage; to participate effectively in cultural, reli¬
gious, social, economic and public life, as well as
in the decision-making process concerning the
minority to which they belong; to establish and
monitor their own associations; to establish and
maintain without any discrimination free and
peaceful contacts with other members of their
group or other citizens of other states to whom
they are related by national or ethnic, religious or
linguistic ties.
The importance of this Declaration can hardly
be overestimated. It is the first comprehensive,
universal standard-setting instrument dealing
with the rights of persons belonging to minori¬
ties, and as such it will influence state practice and
national legislation. g

UNESCO INACTION
WORLD HERITAGE
The High Atlas mountain chain once
divided Morocco into two distinct parts.
The area of ample rainfall, bountiful agri¬
culture and placid village life to the north
was called bled al-makhzan, the land of
imperial governance. To the south, a
rocky, sandy and sun-baked expanse
stretched into the Sahara. This was bled
al-siba, the land of disorder.
This geographical dichotomy did not
always hold, however, as the great four¬
teenth-century Arab thinker Ibn Khaldun
noted. Often called the father of modern
sociology, Ibn Khaldun saw fundamental
differences in the organizing principles
and cultural bases of city life and desert
life, but he also found ample evidence of
parallels, and indeed of a symbiotic rela¬
tionship of such intensity that the
unfolding of history itself depended on it.
As he saw it, the seeds of urban culture's
1

46
highest artistic and political achieve¬
ments, reached only through co-opera¬
tive enterprise, were buried somewhere
deep in the soul of the lone desert
horseman. Whenever nomads rode
together in bands of even five or ten
men, they incorporated a collective spirit
and a joint purpose pushing inexorably
towards a larger design.
The Moroccan desert is rich in exam¬
ples writ small of what were to be the
seeds of dynastic urban grandeur. The
southern oases along the lush green river
valleys are cultivated with the same
intensity and ingenuity as the north's fer¬
tile plains. Clan loyalties once radiated
from the southern strongholds of the
local saint in much the same way that
dynastic loyalties later spread from the
imperial cities of Meknes, Fez and Rabat.
Perhaps nowhere are these parallels
between desert and urban Moroccan cul¬
ture more striking than in a comparison
of Ait Ben Haddou, a hauntingly quiet
fortified farming village south of the High
Atlas, with the teeming, labyrinthine,
cacophonous kasbah of old Fez. Both are
on Unesco's World Heritage List, and one
can visit neither without recalling the
lessons taught by Ibn Khaldun.
ROOFTOP NOMADS
While Fez has a recorded history, a host
of founding dynasts known by name, and
precise construction dates for its earliest
architecture, we know little of Ait Ben
Haddou's Berber past. Its age as a human
settlement, we can safely assume, is less
than the geological age of the rock upon
which it is built, but its proximity to
known prehistoric sites in the Sahara
indicates quite plausibly that it is cen¬
turies, if not millennia, older than Fez.
But we do know that it, like Fez, rep¬
resents the acme of its own particular
school of high-density, multi-use, envi¬
ronmentally-adapted architecture and
town planning. Ait Ben Haddou's desert-
born model for urban design, applied
by Louis Werner
with such stunning success to the Fez
kasbah, dramatically illustrates Ibn
Khaldun's unified theory of civilization.
For in Ait Ben Haddou city and desert
living habits meet in unusual concord.
Densely-packed, multi-storey dwellings
create an utterly urban atmosphere, yet
their inhabitants still live something of a
nomadic existence. In response to
changing temperatures, they "migrate"
from room to room, from rooftops where
they sleep at night to ground-level cham¬
bers where they escape the midday heat, .
just as pastoralists move about in
response to climate-induced changes in
grazing and watering conditions.
Ait Ben Haddou is by no means
southern Morocco's only fortified village
constructed of stone, rammed earth,
adobe brick and mud plaster. The valleys
of the Dra, Dades, Gheria and Ziz rivers
and their tributaries are studded with
such settlements in all shapes and sizes.
One stretch of the Dades is in fact known
in the tourist guides as the "Route of the

Kasbahs". But the term "kasbah" leads to
a certain amount of confusion when
applied to the High Atlas and to pre-
Saharan oases. The word can lead the
unwary to imagine mistakenly the maze¬
like alleyways and dead-ends of the
imperial cities' enclosed palace
precincts, now converted to mixed com¬
mercial and domestic use.
More precisely, however, desert kas¬
bahs are the ex-residences of southern
Morocco's once-great ruling families
the Glaoui, the Goundafa and the
M'touggausually built to stand alone
on some imposing mountain spur. The
only true kasbah of this type that remains
largely intact is the Glaoui family's home
at Telouet.
CASTLES AND KASBAHS
To describe the full range of southern
Moroccan architecture, one needs to be
familiar with two Berber words, agadir
and tighremt, which refer respectively to
fortified granaries and the multi-towered
castles occupied by village headmen, as
well as with the Arabic words kelaa and
kasr, which refer to mountain citadel vil¬
lages and to walled oasis settlements.
The so-called "kasbah" of rural
Morocco is often in fact a tighremt, con¬
structed usually in the midst of the vil¬
lage. But since village housing is built
contiguously and shares party walls, it
becomes impossible over time to tell
where the tighremt ends and the kasr
begins. Separate construction thus takes
on the look of an organic whole.
Ait Ben Haddou has at least four
tighremt-lïke structures. Because the vil¬
lage is built for defensive purposes up the
flank of a steep hill, the fairly rectilinear
grid pattern of the typical kasr has here
been abandoned in favour of a more
fluid layout following the contour lines.
As a result it exhibits even more than the
usual amount of spatial disorientation.
The view looking down upon the
multi-level flat roofs from the ruined
hilltop agadir that overlooks Ait Ben
Haddou takes in the overall plan of the
village and the flow of its passageways.
From this perspective the settlement
calls to mind a géode, a geological forma¬
tion with which the region is rife, but a
convex rather than a concave geode, with
the massed, crystal-like cubic forms of its
architecture jutting up from the dull reg¬
ularity of the surrounding landscape.
Village housing displays a perfect
marriage of form, function, material and
climate. In view of the latitude and the
heat of the Sun, the ratio of habitable
volume to exposed exterior surface is
maximized by the networks of irregularly
oriented walls shadowing courtyards and
second-storey family quarters. Flat open
roofs provide ample work space and an
area where grain and dates can be spread
out to dry. Fresh animal fodder is con¬
served in the cooler, damper ground-
level store-rooms.
Sun-dried mud is an ideal building
material in zones of low humidity where
there are wide temperature fluctuations
between day and night. Exterior walls
heat slowly during the day, but radiate
interior warmth during chilly nights. By
morning, the high-ceilinged rooms have
fully cooled and are comfortable again
despite the mounting midday heat.
Ait Ben Haddou is constructed
mainly of monolithic walls of rammed
earth mud, straw, dung and gravel
tamped into rectangular wooden shut¬
tering and unbaked, handmade adobe
bricks. The thick monolithic units are
generally used for the lower levels and
outer walls, the bricks for upper walls,
stairways, partitions and the ever-pre¬
sent surface ornamentation.
Foundation walls for some of the
tighremfs twenty-metre towers are two
metres thick, tapering to just one brick's
width at the top. In a land where plumb
lines were unknown until recently, right
angles were considered not worth
striving for. Instead, the sloping look
gives the entire kasr a feeling of vertical
tension and momentum. Against the
backdrop of the High Atlas, this upward
have been abandoned by families who
prefer the new town's piped water and
electricity. Only six families remain today.

sweep makes the village appear to levi¬
tate from its hillside setting.
Because it lies in the Ounila river's
flood plain, not far from its confluence
with the Mellah, the village is bifurcated
by running water. To the east is old Ait
Ben Haddou, the village of mud brick
and high walls; on the Ounila's western
bank is the new town, built of cinder
block and concrete slab cubical too in
its own modern way, but so much the
poorer for it.
The new town looks as if it has been
hastily erected to serve the needs of the
busloads of tourists arriving on two-hour
visits. As such, it serves a necessary pur¬
pose. One hesitates to think how the old
village's increasingly delicate sociological
and physical condition could withstand
the tourist shock not to mention that
caused by the many Hollywood film
crews which have worked here if drink
stands and postcard shops had not been
set at a distance from the village proper.
Ait Ben Haddou's ancient half still
rests on shaky ground. Many of its homes
FACING THE FUTURE
In order to attract the old village's occu¬
pants back from the other side, a new
organization, the Centre for the Conserva¬
tion and Rehabilitation of the Architec¬
tural Heritage in the Atlas and Sub-Atlas
Zones [Centre de Conservation et de Réha¬
bilitation du Patrimoine Architectural des
Zones Atlasiques et Subatlasiques) has
undertaken a project to rebuild Ait Ben
Haddou's mosque and involve the com¬
munity in long-range planning.
The village needs to offer a balanced,
low-impact array of tourist services, but
also to maintain its traditional agricul¬
tural base. The problem is whether, as
the village leader puts it, the sheep
stabled in his kasbah's lower enclosure
are compatible with paying overnight
guests upstairs. As for the already aban¬
doned housing, how can mixed-use
stables, granaries and domestic quarters
be "retro-fitted" with the physical facili¬
ties electricity, plumbing, larger
rooms expected by both foreign
tourists and Moroccan home-owners
accustomed to more modern accommo¬
dation? This is the question that the
Centre's architects and sociologists are
now trying to answer.
When the Centre asked the new
town's residents what improvements
would be most likely to draw them back
to their original homes, the mosque's
repair was near the top of their list. And
since the project is now near completion,
time will tell if it will in itself be sufficient
to spark a revitalization. But since the
mosque is without question the village's
architectural and spiritual centrepiece, it
is fitting that it should be restored first.
Over the past few centuries Ait Ben
Haddou has survived flooding, siege and
drought. In the future it faces perhaps
even more daunting challenges heavy
tourist traffic, agricultural obsolescence
and physical abandonment. But there is
still hope. Its designation by Unesco as a
World Heritage site has brought it to the
attention of the wider world. And its
townspeople have taken a stand to pro¬
tect it from reckless change.

ANTWERP 93
CULTURAL CAPITAL OF EUROPE
48
In 1993 it is the turn ofAntwerpfollowing Athens,
Florence, Amsterdam, Berlin, Glasgow, Dublin and
Madridto play the part ofcultural capital ofEurope.
Belgium's second city, which is also Europe's second
largest port, is planning a series ofexhibitions and other
events, not merely as a celebration but also as a reflection
on the role and responsibility of art at the end of the
second millennium.
Antwerp will be playing host on this occasion to
nearly 2,000 artists from all over the world, repre¬
senting a wide range of art forms, including music,
drama, opera, visual arts, ballet, street theatre and the
arts of the media. The ancient city has undergone a
thorough rejuvenation treatment: its historic buildings
have been restored, its old quarters spruced up, its
squares remodelled.and its streets pedestrianized, and
a programme of architecture and urban renewal is
preparing the way for the Antwerp of the twenty-first
century.
Among the hundreds of cultural events on offer
will be: an exhibition of the paintings of Jacob Jor-
daens, the great Baroque artist, the 400th anniversary
ofwhose birth the town will be commemorating; a dis¬
play of antique diamond jewellery (Antwerp being the
world's greatest diamond centre); and an exhibition
showing some of the 6,000 terra-cotta soldiers found
in the tomb of the third-century-B.C. Chinese emperor
Qin Shihuangdi. Visitors will also be able to attend
performances at the Bourla Theatre or see the modern
collections of the Middelheim open-air sculpture
museum.
Activities will be in full swing this summer, when
attractions will include the Eurosail tall ships parade
and exhibitions on animals and the environment to
mark the 150th anniversary ofAntwerp Zoo. g

which he recorded three years
ago with Paquito D'Rivera, and
performs the Panamanian lyrical

ETTERS TO THE EDITOR
SO
YES TO DEMOCRATIC
CULTURE
I read Federico Mayor's Commentary in your
November 1992 issue with great interest. To
quote the opening: "A viable democracy is
inconceivable in the absence of an authentic
democratic culture. This culture of democracy
seems to me to be a space that permits the
synthesis of four fundamental concepts: citi¬
zenship, tolerance, education, and the free
exchange of ideas and peoples." The rest of the
article is in the same spirit. This is encouraging.
Without such ideas, the world, and Africa in
particular, will have great difficulty in coping

HOW DEMOCRATIC
ARE we:
Your November 1992 issue entitled "The Chal¬
lenge of Democracy" charts pertinently enough
the vicissitudes of the definition of democracy.
However, I was sorry to see that nothing was
said about one important challenge harboured
within our own so-called modern democra¬
cies. Should you not have extended your inves¬
tigations to explore the inadequacies ofWestern
democracies? What is the value of democracy
when political power is in thrall to the power of
money or when only 40 per cent of the popu¬
lation vote in a presidential election? What lib¬
erty and what democracy exists for the poor and
the unemployed? Meanwhile, great advocates
ofdemocracy that we are, we are asphyxiating
Africa and various developing countries else¬
where. These few examples are enough to indi¬
cate what is wrong with equating Western
society with democracy.

NO NEED FOR PANIC
I was very interested by the ideas expressed by
the astrophysicist Herbert Reeves in the inter¬
view published in your January 1 993 issue. But
I strongly disagree with him about the danger
posed by carbon dioxide to our climate. Volca¬
noes were emitting carbon dioxide long before
we had oil, but nobody has ever claimed that
variations in the level ofvolcanic activity could
explain the ice ages, or the global warming
experienced when the Roman Empire was at its
peak, or the many occasions when wine was
sold by weight in Paris because it was frozen.
What is more, in twenty years' time we shall
no longer be burning oil because everything will
be powered by nuclear-generated electricity. I
share Hubert Reeves' concern for the future of
humanity. But there is no need to panic.
Régis Tardy
Auriol (France)
MYTHS OF THE FLOOD
I write to strongly protest the clearly subjective
implications of the wording of the introduc¬
tory remarks to "The Great Flood" in your June
1992 issue. You twice refer to the event in ques¬
tion as a "myth", implying that it is a fictitious,
fanciful matter one imaginary and unreal, to
quote the Oxford Dictionary. However, there
is certainly sufficient archaeological and
palaeontological evidence to call into ques¬
tion even the most incredulous of agnostic
views. Marine fossils at the top of Mt. Everest
surely provide proof of an historical phenom¬
enon that cannot simply be explained by "con¬
tinental drift".
M. T. Balke,

The concept ofmyth is a complex one. Sacred
narrativesfound in diverseforms in everysociety,
myths belongprimarily to the world ofthe imag¬
ination. Ifthey preserve the memory ofhistorical
events, they transpose these events into a per¬
spective that transcends them. These questions
have been extensively discussed in modern
studies ofmythology by such scholars as Claude
Lévi-Strauss, Georges Dumézil and Mircea
Eliade. Editor
DECADENCE
Although not without interest, the themes
treated by the new-look Courier reflect a civi¬
lization that must be described as decadent,
since it is composed of people cut off from
their ontological roots. Our society is a prison
in which individuals are chained to one another
and can only break their chains at the expense
of their companions in squalor. The Courier, as
I see it, only serves to illustrate the facilities of
this prison. So less, please, about television,
cars and sport and more about traditions
our only links, however tenuous, with our divine
origin.

SOME CORRECTIONS
I was very interested as I am sure all students
ofAfrica must have beenby Caroline Haardt's
excellent piece on the island of Gorée in the
October 1992 issue. But I should like to correct
two small details. The phrase "Slave Coast" is
correctly applied only to the Bight ofBenin and
cannot be extended to far-distant Angola, even
though the slave trade was practised there. Sec¬
ondly, the capital ofFrench WestAfrica in the late
nineteenth centurywas Saint-Louis, not Dakar
as the article states. Dakar was only made the
federal capital in 1902, and became the capital
of Senegal in 1957.
