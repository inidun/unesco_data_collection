Angkor is in danger. The shadow of war threatens this great architectural
complex, steeped in history and breathtaking in its beauty. Angkor, along
with a large number of other Khmer sites of ancient Cambodia, makes up
an irreplaceable cultural heritage which Unesco, dedicated to the protec¬
tion of the world's great cultural monuments, is seeking to safeguard. The
Unesco Courier dedicates this issue to the Khmer artists who, from the
ninth to the thirteenth century and later, succeeded in creating one of the
most extraordinary examples of the marriage between architecture and space.

I N the classic civilizations
of ancient Greece and Rome creative
thought and work were recognized
and appreciated. Outstanding monu¬
ments and works of art were visited
then just as tourists today include
famous sites and monuments in their
itinerary.
Of the hundreds which existed,
seven were considered to be outstand¬
ing and called the "Seven Wonders
of the World". Of these a few traces
have survived to the present, but the
fame of those which have disappeared
still lingers.
Today, more than seven would be
recognized throughout the world, and
surely within that limited group would
be found Angkor Wat. The news that
it had been damaged made headlines
in the world press and aroused de¬
mands that it should be protected from
further Injury.
Angkor Wat Is but one of many sites
and monuments surrounding the Tonlé
Sap, the great natural flood reservoir
of the lower Mekong and its tributa¬
ries, in the Khmer Republic. Annual
monsoon rains result in a great expan¬
sion of the lake, and as it recedes in
the dry season fertile silt is deposited
and the land becomes ready for the
cultivation of rice and other crops.
Fish abound and contribute protein to
the diet. Even today 2,000 square miles
of farm land are flooded annually.
This easily exploited wealth was
the foundation for the growth of an
urban civilization, and major empires
rose and fell, to be succeeded by
others. Each left traces of its exist¬
ence. Ancient cities, temples and
palaces (some still buried under dense
tropical vegetation), bear mute witness
to former glories of the Khmer people.
Bas-reliefs carved on walls of stone
depict a triumphant procession, cap¬
tives taken in war, the pomp and cere¬
mony of royal courts. Statues of Siva,
Vishnu and other deities of the Hindu
pantheon, and of Bodhisattvas, or
future Buddhas, record the images of
long dead kings, queens, princes and
dignitaries apotheosized as gods.
Frequently the sculptors succeeded

"in merging man with god", in giving
their creations a transcendent quality
which contemporary visitors respond
to though they may be ignorant of
Khmer history and of the religious and
cultural traditions from which these
monuments were created. Of all the
complex of monuments known collect¬
ively as Angkor, the masterwork is
Angkor Wat. It was built in the 12th
century A.D. during the lifetime of
King Suryavarman II and eventually
became his mortuary temple.
French archaeologists, historians
and architects have worked for years
in Cambodia (today the Khmer Repu¬
blic). Part of the legacy of the Ecole
Française d'Extrême-Orient rests in
the monuments which have been exca¬
vated, studied and restored. Khmers
have also been trained and now staff
the national and provincial, museums
and services responsible for the pro¬
tection of sites and monuments.
Several thousand sites have been
identified and thousands have still
to be discovered.
lUCH remains to be done;
before the recent outbreak of con¬
flict, Unesco sent an architect-restorer
to begin work on a group of sites
150 kilometres east of Angkor, which
ranged in time from the seventh cen¬
tury to about the end of the thirteenth.
Other experts were sent to assess
the expenditure required for the deve¬
lopment of such sites.
Cultural tourism was already an
important factor in the economy of the
country. Siem Reap now has a modern
airport which can receive jets, and new
hotels have been built or were under
construction in 1970. The develop¬
ment of sites away from Angkor would
have encouraged visitors to stay
longer in the country and the resultant
increase in income would have helped
to justify the budget required for
research and restoration. The outbreak
of armed conflict has, of course, put
all of these plans in abeyance.
This is not the first time that Angkor
has been menaced by armed conflict.
A period of unrest followed the death
of Suryavarman II, the weakened king¬
dom fell to the Chams and Angkor
was pillaged in 1177. Successive
kings restored Khmer rule. New
by Hiroshi Daifuku
construction and changes to the old
took place, enriching the monumental
heritage of the Khmer people.
Once again the threat of armed
conflict menaces not only the people
but their past heritage. Nowhere else
is there greater anxiety about the pre¬
servation of Angkor. Whatever the
cause of recent damage, the Govern¬
ment, recognizing the need for effect¬
ive measures to ensure Angkor's pre¬
servation, has suggested that a neutral
zone be established surrounding the
monuments so that further damage
will not occur as a result of military
operations.
This move to protect Angkor is but
one attempt in the long and turbulent
history of man to preserve links with
the past so that people may share a
common history and tradition. The
loss of such identification and conti¬
nuity could lead to the eventual disap¬
pearance of an entire people.
This factor was recognized from
very early times. Conquerors or
would-be conquerors, in order to
assure their posterity and the pride of
future generations, have built monu¬
ments or destroyed those of their
enemies. Rome, for example, adopted
Cato's slogan "Delenda est Carthago"
(Carthage must be destroyed) after the
second Punic War.
The third Punic War, provoked by
the Romans, resulted in the sack of the
city. The site was dedicated to the
infernal gods, no stone left standing,
and all habitation in the ruined area
forbidden. Carthage, as a city, even¬
tually rose again, but it was no longer
Punic. The survivors had been absorb¬
ed and their identity had gone forever.
(See "Unesco Courier", December
1970).
During World War II, for example,
after an uprising by the inhabitants of
Warsaw had been repressed, Hitler
ordered the complete evacuation of
the city. The ancient royal castle, the
old medieval section (the central
market place known as the "Stare
Miasto"), palaces and churches were
destroyed, and much of the rest of the
city was dynamited and gutted by fire.
The decision taken by the people of
Poland to restore most of the monu¬
ments of Warsaw, including the "Stare
Miasto", expressed their desire to re¬
create the fabric of the city and main¬
tain the continuity of Polish history.

The lessons learned from World
War II eventually led to the preparation
by Unesco of an "International Con¬
vention on the Protection of Cultural
Property in the Event of Armed Con¬
flict" which was adopted at The
Hague in 1954. As in all examples of
legislation it represents a compromise
between the ideal and the adoption of
rules which the majority of States who
took part in its preparation believe that
forces engaged in armed combat could
be expected to observe.
The Hague Convention (1954) is now
in force and over fifty States have
ratified it, including the Khmer Repu¬
blic. One of the provisions (Article 23)
states that Unesco can be called upon
for technical assistance in organizing
the protection of cultural property.
At the request of the Khmer Govern¬
ment, Unesco sent an expert to help
negotiate a cease fire to protect Ang¬
kor and permit the transfer of movable
bronzes and sculptures to Phnom Penh
for shelter. Later, additional experts
were sent to aid and advise in the
packing, transport and storage of
these works of art, and the most
valuable items are now' adequately
protected in the National Museum in
Phnom Penh.
But whereas the Khmer Government
has ratified the Convention the other
belligerents have not. One solution
would be the negotiation of special
agreements so that the provisions of
the Hague Convention can be applied.
Should this be done, centres contain¬
ing monuments of great importance
could be placed under special protec¬
tion (Article II). It would represent a
triumph demonstrating the goodwill of
all concerned.
The threat of destruction by armed
conflict is immediate and dramatic.
But in heavily populated centres, the
pressures of population growth and
short-sighted projects for economic
development have resulted in far great¬
er destruction to man's cultural heri¬
tage than that caused by either of the
two World Wars and the many smaller
conflicts of the past 50 years.
This too is a challenge to be met
by the present generation in order that
future generations shall not be depriv¬
ed of cultural links with the past nor
live in an environment polluted through
man's excesses, whether against the
atmosphere, rivers, lakes and seas or
the cultural heritage of our planet.

This general view shows the site of Angkor
(meaning "city") in its present forest setting.
Capital of the Khmer empire from the 9th
to the 13th century, the city covered an
area of 600 square kilometres and boasted
600 temples. Some 100 of these temples
have been cleared of vegetation and
the most important ones are identified on
the plan above. The prosperity of Angkor
was dependent upon the construction
by the Khmers of a fantastic irrigation
system to support the production of rice.
During the rainy season, water was stored
in artificial lakes, or "barays", and a network
of canals provided irrigation for an area
of 1,000 square kilometres, thus providing
the food supply for a population which,
at Its height, numbered one million.
The greyish-white areas surrounding the
temples or seen as rectangles are
canal-works, basins and lakes forming
part of the extensive Khmer irrigation system.

recalling that this extraordinary artis¬

man's resourceful adaptation to his

12th century Khmer society to create
an artificial environment entirely

ment" so clearly illustrated as at
Angkor. This site in Cambodia, the
capital of the Khmer kingdom from
the 9th to the 14th century, provides a
perfect example of the way in which
a civilization equipped itself with the
means of producing an ample food
supply without which a vigorous
culture could never have flourished in
the hostile setting of virgin forest and
the Indo-Chinese jungle.
This article briefly describes the
main influences which shaped the
Angkorian civilization and its match¬
less architecture, recently thrown into
high relief by the tragic events in
South-East Asia.
The Angkor site forms a vast net¬
work of dozens of temples and satel¬
lite cities, equipped with the water
supplies required for agriculture and
for the day-to-day needs of the Khmer
population. Thus Angkor strikes a
miraculous balance between land and
water, men and gods; from the fusion
of these four elements emerged one
of the greatest civilizations in medieval
Asia.
Even before the beginning of the
Christian era, the fruits of India's
advanced civilization, especially in the
spheres of religion and art, had begun
to spread beyond its frontiers. Ceylon
was the first of its neighbours to be
subjected to the Buddhist influence,
as early as the 3rd century B.C.
Burma, Indo-China, Java and Bali
were not impregnated by the creative
genius of India until the early cent¬
uries of the Christian era. The trade in
exotic products between the Far East
and the Roman Empire was the chief
vehicle for the dissemination of the
Buddhist and Hindu creeds throughout
south-east Asia. The links then forged
between India and the Far East
endured in some instances centuries
after the trading relations had ceased.
There was some sort of division into
spheres of influence between India

MASTERPIECE OF TOWN-PLANNING (Continued)
Delicate balance between ecology and aesthetics
and China in this part of the world;
hence the name of Indo-China acquir¬
ed by the peninsula watered by
three great rivers: the Menam and
the Mekong, where Indian-influenced
cultures flourished; and the Red River,
which watered the provinces gravi¬
tating in China's orbit.
The first architecture in durable
materials clearly shows the Indian
influence; but a capital named Oc-Eo
is known to have existed even earlier
on the Bassac Delta in the lower
Mekong valley. In the 3rd century
A.D., it was enclosed in a rectangle
3,000 metres long by 1,500 metres
wide, formed by a series of five earth¬
works separated by moats. The
shrines in this region, known to the
Chinese of that time as "Fu-nan",
seem to have been built of light mat¬
erial (wood and thatch), and no trace
of them remains.
Among the earliest monuments of
which we have certain knowledge are
the sanctuaries of Sambor Prei Kuk
in Cambodia, a town which seems to
have covered an area 2 kilometres
square. Construction in this capi¬
tal of the early 7th century, which
dominated the unified Tchen-la empire,
was on an impressive scale: the brick
sanctuaries, standing in vast square
enclosures, had high roofs with jutting
arches; their soaring silhouettes were
obtained by superposed storeys of
diminishing size, forming a sequence
of small temples, on a principle which
recurs in all Khmer architecture.
During the 8th century, when Tchen-
la had split into two kingdoms whose
history remains obscure, there seems
to have been little artistic develop¬
ment. Javanese raiders invaded Malay¬
sia and Indo-China; and the Javanese
influence was to play its part in
shaping the course of Angkorian civi¬
lization.
The full flowering of Khmer archi¬
tecture was preceded by an "incu¬
bation period" in the Kulens, 50 kilo¬
metres north-east of the Great Lake
of Cambodia, where the capital of the
kingdom was then transferred. It was
as if the royal house foresaw that the
destiny of the Khmers was to be
played out in the heart of the country,
and no longer in the southern delta,
as at Oc-Eo, or to the east of the
Great Lake, as at Sambor.
In this period, between 800 and
850 A.D., were laid the foundations of
the art form which first emerged at
Roluos in the Angkor region. At Rong
Chen, in the Kulens, the first temple-
mountain was built; its conception is
typical of all Khmer architecture. It
marries the two main architectural
features inherited from India through
the Javanese incursions; the stupa (an
artificial mound around which Bud¬
dhists walk in ritual procession, and
of which Borobudur is the most perfect
example) and the Hindu shrine of
superposed storeys, derived from
Indian models at Mahaballipuram, for
example, through the Javanese temples
of Dieng or Prambanam.
Thus, the temple-mountain is a stupa
crowned by a square shrine, with a
roof formed of vertically superposed
storeys, symbolizing the City of the
Gods built on the Mount Meru of
Hindu legend.
The Ak Yum temple erected north¬
west of Angkor just before the 9th
century was a second attempt at the
same effect. It seems to have been
built by the Khmer King Jayavarman II,
who lived for many years at the Court
of the Sailendras of Java, and was
responsible for establishing the royal
city once and for all in the Angkor
area.
The specific Khmer technique really
came into its own, however, with the
foundation of Roluos by King Indra-
varman (877-889) in the south-east
quarter of Angkor. For the first time,
the Indo-Chinese did more than merely
dig channels to make the fullest use
of the monsoon rains; they undertook
a vast development scheme to improve
the yield of rice, which formed the
staple food throughout the whole of

south-east Asia. This was the source
of wealth to which the vast Angkorian
complexes owed their construction.
Indravarman realized that to break
the immutable monsoon cycle, with
torrential rain for four months in the
year, and not a drop falling for the
following eight months, there was only
one solution: to store the surplus
water for redistribution in time of
shortage.
It was thus possible to use the
Angkorian plain to the best advantage;
with abundant irrigation all the year
round, it could bear as many as three
rice crops a year. To this end,
Indravarman initiated vast hydraulic
engineering works, and created huge
artificial lakes or barays. These
formed reservoirs for the accumulation
of the water needed to irrigate the
rice fields.
The Lolei baray at Roluos in south
east Angkor, the earliest known exam¬
ple, formed a rectangular sheet of
water 3,000 metres long and 800 me¬
tres wide. Dykes were used to
construct this artificial lake, thus
ensuring a permanent head of water
the water level was higher than the
plain.
It was merely necessary to open
trenches in the dykes for the water
to run out at the required rate for
regular irrigation of the rice fields.
The baray, filled by a feeder canal and
by the monsoon rains, with a storage
capacity of 6 million cubic metres,
was to be the source and basis of the
wealth of the Khmer Kingdom.
The succeeding kings followed up
this hydrological development by
creating the great Eastern Baray, meas¬
uring 7,000 by 1,800 metres, built by
Yasovarman about 900 A.D., then the
Western Baray measuring 8,000 by
2,200 metres, which was constructed
about 1050 A.D., with a storage capa¬
city of more than 40 million cubic
metres.
This vigorous technological improve¬
ment of the Angkorian plain inevi¬
tably entailed a profound modification
of the landscape. The hydraulic sys¬
tem moulded the countryside, which
was furrowed by countless irrigation
channels and sub-divided by the
checkerboard of the rice fields.
The Khmers had thus worked out
their specific system of area develop¬
ment, and the plain of Angkor was to
produce 150,000 metric tons of rice a
year from a stretch of nearly 1 ,000 sq.
km. This was enough to feed a popu¬
lation which, in the 12th century, can
be estimated at 700,000 or 800,000 in
the Angkor region alone, with a pro¬
duction surplus of about 40 per cent
for export to less prosperous regions

Water conservation: key to the Khmer equation

which had no similar "rice factory" to
draw upon.
This artificial environment, comple¬
tely dominated and largely moulded by
man, was reflected in the ground plan
of the towns, with their strictly right-
angled lines framing the temple placed
at the very heart of the city. Every
part of the Khmer world was inter¬
connected, from the embankment
bordering the Cambodian peasant's
rice field to the three-walled temple
whose moats were linked to the
irrigation system.
This is illustrated by the city of
Roluos, the first great dynamic capital
in the Angkor region. Indravarman was
not content with constructing the Lolei
baray; in 881 he built the temple-
mountain of Bakong, which stood in
the centre of the city then called
Hariharalaya.
The temple is formed of five super¬
posed sandstone terraces or plat¬
forms, almost square, measuring 67
by 65 metres at the base, and form¬
ing a monumental pedestal 15 metres
high for the principal shrine.
The fourth storey of the temple was
ringed by twelve "chapels", and eight
massive brick towers (prasats) stood
watch around the pyramid, within
a precinct measuring 160 by 120
metres, surrounded by a moat
60 metres wide and about 1 ,500 metres
round.
The dwelling-houses, made of thatch
or matting, and raised on piles to
protect them from the monsoon rains,
bordered this first moat, and were in
turn encompassed by a second moat
22 metres wide. The city formed a
quadrilateral 800 metres long, with a
population of some 7,000 to 8,000.
Four axial avenues crossed the moats
on earthen causeways to converge on
the central temple, thus dividing the
city into four equal parts.
The Khmer complex was thus com¬
plete: a baray supplied water to the
moats in the town, with the temple-
mountain or royal sanctuary at its
heart. The whole constituted an inter¬
acting technological and religio-
magical mechanism which ensured the
prosperity of an agrarian society based
on intensive rice cultivation.
That is the key to the Khmer equa¬
tion; and even when the proportions
of the Roluos enterprise were magni¬
fied 4 or 5 times, in Angkor, in the
walled cities of Yasodharapura and
later at Angkor Thorn, the system
remained the same. The architecture
was only an embellishment of the func¬
tional hydraulic works installed for
irrigation.
The temple protected and sanctified
the technological achievement through
the image of the deity inhabiting the
inner shrine. The Khmer temple,
whether dedicated to the Hindu divi¬
nities of Siva, Vishnu or Brahma, or
(when the world of Angkor had nearly
run its course) to the Buddha-King,
represented the centre of creation, the
Mount Meru which was the home of
the gods (as Olympus was the haunt
of the divinities in the Greek Pan¬
theon).
The square plan of the temple, with
its geometrical divisions, constituted
an immense mándala (a mystic sym¬
bolic diagram of Indian origin), includ¬
ing the temple (which was thus
brought into harmony with the laws of
the Cosmos), the royal capital inhab¬
ited by humans (which was thus iden¬
tified with the centre of the universe),
and the vast expanse of the plain
(which was thus dedicated to the
gods). The whole panorama was quar¬
tered by the four axial avenues running
from the sanctuary in each direction to
be lost to sight in the perspective of
the Khmer landscape.
This all-round symmetry of construc¬
tion along the axial roads is a fun¬
damental law of temple composition
in the architecture of Indian-influenced
countries; but only the Khmers suc¬
ceeded in impressing that symmetry
on the sacred edifice, on the human
city and on the surrounding country¬
side.
This total vision of mystic symbol¬
ism and its religio-magical power,
associated with the practical function
of the barays and the irrigation sys¬
tem, is the hallmark of the Khmer
genius. From this astonishing talent
for synthesis, embracing all aspects
of human creation, emerged the admi¬
rable apotheosis of Angkor Wat.
One of the factors responsible for
the individual character of Khmer art,
which differentiates it from its Indian
sources, derives from the popular
architecture typical of ancient Cam¬
bodia, especially the wooden dwellings
built on piles and topped by gabled
roofs covered with thatch. This domes¬
tic style probably dates back to pre¬
historic times, and is hardly distin¬
guishable from pre-lndian neolithic
building.
The popular art represented on
Khmer bas-reliefs (at Angkor Wat and
Bayon, in particular) inspired some
typical forms of Angkorian architecture.
Its influence can be detected in many
instances of translation into stone of
features borrowed from what were
originally wooden structures.
One example is the moulded window
balustrades, reproducing in sandstone
the rounded lattice gratings of hut
dwellings; others are the cross-gabled
roofs, imitating the carpenter's tech¬
nique in stone; the colonnettes border¬
ing some raised walks, reminiscent of
the traditional gangways leading to pri¬
mitive dwellings beside the Great
Lake: the mortise effect at the apex
of doors and windows, and so on.
All these traits are characteristic of

Khmer art, and in no way derived
from Indian models. Thus, Khmer
architecture drew its inspiration both
from native and from Indian sources.
A rich symbolism already infused
Indravarman's achievement at Roluos
(the temple-mountain of Bakong); but
there followed a steady development
in architectural science which became
more complex while also gaining in
uniformity and quality. Thus, the long
structures bordering the Bakong sanc¬
tuary on either side of the axial ave¬
nues began to proliferate, and even
invaded the steps of the temple-moun¬
tain.
These narrow halls were soon occu¬
pying the steps of the pyramid on
every side. Here we can see the
inspired process of simplification

This photograph is quite extraordinary in more than one sense. What appears to be a simple wall with several figures
on it is in reality a tele-photo picture in foreshortened perspective of a 30 metre stretch of several planes of
the great gallery of Angkor Wat. This gallery forms the vestibule of the temple, the biggest and best preserved
of the temples of Angkor, which was built by King Suryavarman II in preparation for his eventual apotheosis. The figures
with diadems and long skirts, bare-breasted in the ancient Khmer tradition, are minor divinities, known as "apsara"
or "devata", destined, according to Buddhist mythology, to gladden the hearts of the Gods and the blessed ones.
which led (in the temples of Phimeana-
kas and Takeo) to the emergence of
the encircling gallery, that essential
element of classical Khmer architec¬
ture.
The long buildings were run toge¬
ther, the outer wall of the gallery thus
formed was finally placed at the edge
of each storey, the axial entrances
(the Hindu gopura) and corner towers
were integrated in the composition.
The various concentric platforms sym¬
bolize the mountain ranges surround¬
ing the human universe, encompass¬
ed in turn by the primordial ocean,
here represented by the wide moat
skirting the city.
Meanwhile, there was appreciable
technological progress: as a result of
the general adoption of masonry for
temple architecture, the sanctuaries
built of brick and hewn stone, to pro¬
vide the eternal gods with imperishable
materials, were soon topped by roofs
where wooden timbers and tiles were
replaced by corbelled vaulting built
of sandstone.
Lastly, the classical period paid spe¬
cial attention to the perfection of orna¬
mental detail. The use of hewn stone
contributed to the quality of the sculp¬
ture. One of the first really classical
buildings in this sense is the small
temple of Banteay Srei, some twenty
kilometres north of Angkor.
The layout of this jewel in stone is
highly original, as it is not a temple-
mountain, but a horizontal temple,
where the successive closes represent
a horizontal version of the superposed
galleries typical of the pyramid form.
But the fame of this miniature sanc¬
tuary is founded on its extraordinarily
rich and elaborate decoration. Des¬
pite a certain leaning toward "pretti-
ness" it reveals such authority in its
excellence, such a marked feeling for
grace and elegance, such a sure hand
and such perfect mastery that it un¬
deniably represents one of the highest
peaks of Khmer artistry.
The little temple, built in 967 A.D., is
completely covered with divinities,
nymphs and guardians, beautifully car¬
ved in the pink sandstone. The sur¬
face shows not an inch of stone which
is not decorated with matchless craft,
reminiscent in its luxuriance of the
primeval forest around it.

MASTERPIECE OF TOWN-PLANNING (Continued)

constructed during the reign of Surya¬
varman II (1113-1150), the most re¬
nowned and glorious of the Angkorian
kings, Khmer architecture reached its
culmination, both in perfection of form
and spacing and in quality of crafts¬
manship.
The temple proper is a veritable
cathedral of the jungle. Paradoxically
enough, it is a contemporary of the
great gothic structures of Chartres,
Sens or Notre-Dame de Paris. Ang¬
kor Wat is not only the largest, but
also the finest of all the temples
erected in the Indo-Chinese penin¬
sula.
The moat, nearly 200 metres wide,
lines a rectangle measuring 1,500 by
1,300 metres, and encloses an area of
2 sq. km. larger than such a town as
Timgad under the Roman empire. The
temple forms the pivot of an urban
system of which only the buildings
constructed with durable materials
have survived, but which must have
housed a population of some 17,000 to
20,000 people.
The moat, measuring 5¿ km. round,
is bridged on the west by a dyke
supporting a causeway leading to an
immense portico 235 metres long, pier¬
ced by three gateways. This spacious
structure forming the main entrance
prefigures the temple façade, which
comes into sight on the far side of
these majestic propylaea.
Another axial avenue 350 metres long
leads to the foot of the temple pro¬
per, its façade rising from a high,
elaborately moulded sub-structure,
dominated by the five towers crowned
by a tiara-shaped stone roof. The
colonnaded wings of the immense
surrounding gallery, measuring 187 by
215 metres, form a perfectly balanced
composition.
Along the inner walls of this gallery
runs a fantastic sequence of bas-
reliefs girdling the whole temple,
which represents a distance of over
500 metres. They constitute a sort of
chronicle of the rulers of Angkor,
combined with a pictorial mythology.
Passing through the gateway, the
visitor enters the cruciform courtyard
found at the centre of all classical
Angkorian architecture. It consists of
four small courts connected by cover¬
ed corridors and linking the friezed
gallery to the gallery encircling the
second precinct.
The cruciform courtyard provides the
first example of sandstone vaulting
supported by four rows of pillars to
form a central nave flanked by two
aisles. It is a graceful, airy composi¬
tion, decorated in high relief by a
dancing procession of Devata and
Apsara (Indian goddesses).
To proceed to the upper storey, the
three parallel galleries in the court¬
yard follow the rise of the covered
stairways by an arrangement of super¬
posed overlapping arches. The gallery
running round the second storey
opens inwards only, through balustrad-
ed windows. This second precinct,
measuring 100x115 metres, encloses
the enormous base of the temple
13 metres high, topped by the five
towers of the sanctuary.
The third tier of the temple-moun¬
tain is also formed by an encircling
gallery, but its balustraded windows
open outwards, while pillared porticos
look on to the inner patios. The central
shrine, on a level with the four corner
towers, is connected with the gallery
by covered cloisters, as in the cruci¬
form courtyard. Resting on four pro¬
jecting porches, it soars a sheer
42 metres upwards to its summit
65 metres above the level of the plain.

ture can be clearly perceived, plann¬
ed in the image of the celestial palace
which is the home of the gods.
Upon the death of Suryavarman II,
about 1150, the Khmers' neighbours,
the Chams, took advantage of the
general disorganization of the empire,
then plunged in palace revolutions and
struggles for the throne, to carry out
a daring raid against Angkor, which
they destroyed by fire in 1177. The
merit of restoring the Khmer power
belongs to King Jayavarman VII; he
succeeded in expelling the invaders,
and was crowned King of Angkor in
1181, when he at once undertook the
total reconstruction of the city.
Jayavarman forsook the Hindu reli¬
gion of his predecessors and was con¬
verted to Buddhism. An entirely new
style of building suddenly sprang up,
redolent of an oddly fascinating baro¬
que, which superseded the classic for¬
malism of Angkor Wat by a new con¬
ception of space and volume: a new
art flowered where no line was drawn
between sculpture and architecture.
The towers of the temples were car¬
ved with colossal faces in relief,
representing both the image of Buddha
Sakyamuni (Gautama the Sage), and
the effigy of Jayavarman VII. There
was thus a complete upheaval in both
religion and its outward forms.
The King first erected the temple-
city of Ta Prohm, which covered an
area of 1,000 by 600 metres. , The
temple proper was built on a plan
which was to serve as a model for
most of the Buddhist monasteries
constructed in Jayavarman's reign.
The fundamental conception was that
of the horizontal temple already applied
at Banteay Srei, but the precincts were
enclosed with concentric peripheral
galleries as well as walls.
Thus, the progressive encroach¬
ment of the surrounding galleries on
the steps of the temple-pyramid
was completed, while the symbolism
remained the same in the horizontal
temple as in the temple-mountain.
The layout of the Preah Khan tem¬
ple, encompassed by a moat 40 metres
wide and covering an area of about
1,000 by 750 metres, closely resembled
that of Ta Prohm; but both these
structures were hurriedly and perfunc¬
torily built, the construction often being
of mediocre standard, the adornment
crude and lifeless. All the buildings
put up in Jayavarman Vll's reign show
signs of haste.
The capital named Angkor Thorn (or
"Great Royal City"), built about
1200 A.D., initiated a new trend in
Angkorian architecture. It marked
the formation of the specific language
of the baroque-type art which preceded
the decadence of the Khmer empire.
The precinct of the new capital at
once introduced a new style; the five
dykes crossing the moat supported a
fascinating innovation: the Giant's
Causeway. This is an approach
bordered on either hand by high
balustrades formed by 54 giants
bearing in their mighty arms the body
of an enormous Naga (a mythical
Indian snake).
This vast allegorical composition
symbolizes a theme dear to Indian
mythology: the Churning of the Sea
of Milk, which represents the creation
of the world. Overlooking this
mythical scene, at the gateway to the
city, stand towers carved with a four¬
fold effigy, representing the imposing
image of the Buddha-King, the ruler
of the world, whose regard embraces
the four points of the compass.
All this symbolic art culminates in
the extraordinary structure of the
Bayon, Jayavarman Vll's major

THE KHMER SMILE
OF THE BAYON
by Philippe Stern
W,HAT a strange yet wonder¬
ful monument we have in the Bayon
at Angkor.
The Bayon is the last of the great
Khmer monuments in stone. Khmer
art' began in the 6th century A.D.
on territory very roughly correspond¬
ing to the Cambodia of today; but dur¬
ing about the first half of its evolution,
its monuments, which frequently
contained very beautiful statues and
were remarkable for their decoration
(especially on the lintels), were only
small buildings made up of separate
elements.
It was not till later, after the found¬
ation of Angkor in the late 9th or
early 10th century A.D., that large
temples began to appear, with con¬
centric enclosures, and constructed
in stone instead of brick.
At Angkor, some thirty monuments
were still standing until very recently
and, apart from a brief period in the
10th century, Angkor remained a
capital until the decline of the splen¬
dour of the Khmers with Jayavar¬
man VII and even for some time
thereafter.
At the Bayon two outstanding points
of interest compel our attention. One
is the outer gallery which, though in
ruins, still has intact walls covered
with bas-reliefs. From one point in their
PHILIPPE STERN, of France, Is one of the
great names connected with the study of
Khmer art. He is the originator of a now
widely adopted research method which
enabled him to explain the evolution and
establish the chronology of Khmer art. His
book "Les Monuments Khmers du Style du
Bayon et layavarman VII" Is an internation¬
ally accepted source book for scholars.
At present he is working on a book on aes¬
thetics the central theme of which, 'the
smile", is discussed in the article published
here. Another of Philippe Stem's works is
currently in press: "Colonnes Indiennes
d'Ajanta et d'É/lora: Evolution et Repercus¬
sions" (Publications du Musée Guimet,
Presses Universitaires de France). Honorary
curator-in-chlef of the Musées de France
(Arts Asiatiques), he contributed greatly to
the development and renovation of the
Musée Guimet of Paris, which Is famous for
Its Oriental collections. Philippe Stern was
also one of the first scholars to take a
serious interest In the music of Asia and
Africa. For his various books on Angkor see
bibliography page 42.
development, the great Khmer temples
were generally made up of concentric
galleries encircling a central sanctuary,
and from the 12th century A.D.
onwards, the outer galleries were
covered with bas-reliefs, such as those
seen at Angkor Wat, Banteay Chmar
and the Bayon.
At the Bayon we find an interesting
innovation on the bas-reliefs. Along
the base of one of them a series of
little scenes of daily life unfolds before
our eyes. (Photos pages 30-38.)
These bas-reliefs give us a remark¬
able insight into the crafts and occup¬
ations and the homely details of the
life of the people of the time. Khmer
art is a religious art, and these scenes
are remarkable, not only in themselves,
but because nowhere else in Khmer
architecture are similar works of a
non-religious nature to be found.
But far more striking is the upper
part of the monument. The Bayon is
a "temple-mountain" of the type
usually constructed by each of the
great Khmer kings in the form ' of a
tiered pyramid. The temple-mountain
was considered to be the centre of
the world of men just as the divine
mountain was the centre of the world
of the gods.
The tower-sanctuaries of the Bayon
are striking in that on each of their
four sides there is a gigantic face
representing the divinity and the deifi¬
ed king merged into one, with all the
faces irradiating royal benevolence to
the four points of the compass, "look¬
ing everywhere", as the texts say.
This was an innovation of the great
Buddhist king . Jayavarman VII (who
reigned from approximately 1181 to
1219 A.D.), which corresponded to his
major religious reform undertaken,
according to my findings (1), some ten
years after his reign began. Since
there are more than fifty of these
towers, the Bayon constitutes a most
extraordinary architectural and sculp¬
tural complex.
During the construction of the upper
part of the Bayon it was decided to
enlarge the building as originally plan¬
ned. As a result earlier sculptures
(1) See my book 'Les Monuments khmers
du style du Bayon et Jayavarman VII",
published by Presses Universitaires de
France, which contains translations and quo¬
tations from philological studies by G. Coe-
dès and other writers on the great historical
figure Jayavarman VII.
were hidden and the general effect
was one of near chaos. Yet on reach¬
ing the upper section the visitor is
stupefied by the astounding sight it
offers from every viewpoint. He is
greeted on all sides and from every
height and angle by faces which echo
and reflect each other. And many of
these faces are smiling.
Later Buddhism, or mahayana (Bud¬
dhism of the Great Vehicle), differed
markedly from early Buddhism. And
the Buddhist smile, found on the later
statues such as those at the Bayon,
is the height of perfection and beauty.
(Photos, cover and page 17.) Here
the face is shown carved with closed
eyes.
What does this smile really mean?
For me it is a concrete example of the
notion basic to our aesthetic concep¬
tions which, when expressed in
words, could be translated as a union
of opposites, but which, in reality, are
opposites that have not yet emerged
as distinct entities. In other words a
notion which transcends language and
concepts.
The closed eyes thus express an
inwardness, set apart from everyday
things, the search in one's innermost
depths for a transcendental detach¬
ment and a supra-human peace, the
way to nirvana; whereas the smile, ris¬
ing also from the innermost depths,
represents the almost tender Buddhist
charity of communication and com¬
munion with all creatures, imparted by
the smiling expression to the face as
a whole.
The style at the Bayon thus has a
unity of expression which is that of
the masculine bodhisattvas (heads sur¬
mounted by a cylinder with a small
statuette) or the corresponding femi¬
nine prajnaparamita (where the stat¬
uette is placed on a cone above the
head. (Photo page 16.)
The bodhisattvas of the Great Vehi¬
cle are the miraculous, almost divine
beings who, after countless lives of
detachment and charity (perhaps also
of cognition) have succeeded in trans¬
migrating to the very threshold of
nirvana, where they could be freed
from all suffering by losing their indi¬
viduality and merging into the Ineffa¬
ble, which no words can adequately a r
describe. But they refuse to be set I rl
free, in order to devote themselves
compassionately to the salvation of
others, and until such time as all

THE KHMER SMILE (Continued)
THE SMILE
OF DEEP
CONTEMPLATION
Few Eastern forms of artistic expression
surpass in beauty the deep smile of the
statues of Angkor (right, a deified queen or
princess; centre. King Jayavarman VII).
Compare this smile with the ghost of a
smile on the lips of the pharaoh and reli¬
gious reformer, Amenophis IV or Akhenaton
(extreme right) who reigned In Egypt
during the 14th century B.C. It reveals a
world of humanity and sweet serenity
which was expressed to perfection in
Khmer art. The smile shines out from the
vast countenances of the "towers with
faces" at the Bayon, signifying the bene¬
volent contemplation of the Buddha encom¬
passing the whole universe. (Below, aerial
view of the Bayon.)
men shall be saved along with them.
Jayavarman VII was so strongly
imbued with this Buddhist charity that
the stele inscriptions near the hospitals
(see below) bear the words "He suffer¬
ed from the ills of his subjects more
than from his own: for it is the grief of
the people that causes the grief of
kings, and not their own grief".
In the Khmer heads of this period
(Photos opposite) the closed eyes and
the lips drawn out in a deep smile
draw us irresistibly into an inner world
of surpassing peace and tender com¬
passion for all creatures.
I have in my possession a cast of
one of the finest of the heads with
this expression. Even though I see it
every day, it is an unceasing and
inexhaustible source of inspiration to
me, as are all forms of beauty which
have attained their greatest depth.
I referred earlier to deified kings.
But except in the case of Jayavar¬
man VII, at the end of the period of
Khmer splendour, what the statue
represents is the divinity portrayed
according to the contemporary canons
of beauty, completely idealized and
devoid of any individual resemblance
(this Is perhaps where its value lies).
This is true whether the statues are
Hindu (the supreme gods Siva or Vish¬
nu) or Buddhist. Only the inscription
indicates that particular human beings
(to begin with, only kings, then grad¬
ually members of the royal family and
even high dignitaries) were consider¬
ed after death to have been merged
into the divine, the deity represented
by the statue. It is with Jayavar¬
man VII, presumably identified with
Buddha himself (the "Enlightened")
that we first see the expression of
spirituality combined with the portrait
of the individual. (Photos cover and
page 17).
This brings to our attention a curious
and moving fact. The representations
of the "deep smile" are very rare in
the history of art (to my belief there
are only four periods). The reigns of
two great kings who were also reli¬
gious reformers, Amenophis IV-Akhe-
naton of ancient Egypt (14th century
B.C.) and the Khmer king Jayavar¬
man VII (late 12th and early 13th cen¬
turies A.D.), both coincide with such
a period (Photos page 17). It is cer¬
tainly not by chance, for the smile
is linked with communication, under¬
standing communion, compassion and
even tenderness.
A still more astonishing coincidence
Is the fact that in both cases, heads
of statues representing spiritualized
portraits have come down to us. The
colossal head of Amenophis IV, at
Karnak, reveals one of the most extra¬
ordinary faces found on a work of
sculpture, with its elongated profile,
high cheekbones and long chin.
The head of Jayavarman VII, on
the other hand, though also extremely
individualized so that one can immed¬
iately recognize it in other portraits
of the king, is broad-featured and
slightly puffed up. Nevertheless it
retains all its spirituality (G. Coedès
has proved that the portrait is indeed
that of Jayavarman VII).
In Egypt, Amenophis IV, who took
the name of Akhenaton at El Amarna,
was perhaps the first monotheist ruler,
and his hymn to the sun is compared
in Daniel Rops' "Le Roi ivre de Dieu"
with the biblical psalm 104, with which
it is identical, verse for verse. In view
of the approximate date of the Exodus
and the possibly legendary history of
Moses, this in all likelihood indicates
the influence of Akhenaton on the
Bible.
Jayavarman VII showed throughout
his life the intense charity of Buddhism
("the grief of the people causes the
grief of kings" is only one of many
apposite quotations), and was, as we
shall see in a moment, a great religious
reformer. At El Amarna there is also
the feeling for family life, emphasized
by Boisselier, in the same way as in
the bas-reliefs of the Bayon to which
we have already referred (Photos
pages 30-38).
Thus a comparison may be drawn
between Amenophis IV and Jayavar¬
man VII for their leaning towards the
same kind of humanism; but there is
no possibility of the one having
influenced the other, separated as they

were by geography and above all by
25 centuries of history.
Another striking particularity of Jaya¬
varman VII is that he appears to have
built up a highly complex and statistic¬
ally-minded civil service. With aston¬
ishing accuracy, he indicates almost
to a man the number of temple staff
and the objects attributed to the tem¬
ples. Thus there is a record of how
many tower-sanctuaries there are to
each monument, how many dwellings
(probably sections of galleries), the
length of the enclosing walls and of
the moats that flanked them.
The Bayon was not only the royal
temple of Jayavarman VII, perhaps
intended as his tomb (the two were
frequently combined), but also a pan¬
theon containing statues of many of
the gods of the kingdom; though not
all apparently, since we know from
inscriptions that there were 24,400 of
them. There were 8,176 villages
dedicated to the temples and 208,532
men and women, including 1,622 danc¬
ing girls.
One example of Jayavarman Vll's
attention to minute detail is the hos¬
pitals. His Buddhist charity had its
practical aspect, and at intervals along
the roads he had resting-places ("hou¬
ses with hearths") erected, 121 of
which were in existence 10 years after
he acceded to the throne; also hos¬
pitals, 102 of which were already in
operation five years after his acces¬
sion.
The specifications for each hospital
were meticulously precise. "All four
castes may be treated here. There are
two doctors, each having one male and
two female assistants entitled to free
accommodation, two storekeepers res¬
ponsible for the distribution of medica¬
ments. . . two cooks entitled to free
fuel and water, responsible for remov¬
ing dead flowers and cleaning the
temple (a chapel annexed to the hos¬
pitals). . . fourteen hospital attendants
responsible for administering the medi¬
caments. . . two women to pound
rice. . . a total staff of 32, 98 if one
includes those who pay for their own
accommodation." The various lists are
never-ending.
It is not possible to list all the
numerous symbolic elements linked to
Jayavarman Vll's major religious
reform, such as the corner decora¬
tions, apparently of cosmic signifi¬
cance, in which the lion is placed
above the elephant and the garuda, a
fabulous bird, above the lion.
To take only the specific example of
the Bayon, there is the multiplication
of the tower-sanctuaries with faces,
as we have seen. Another of Jaya¬
varman Vll's innovations were the
stone town walls, several miles long,
which like those at Bayon have gates
at the four points of the compass,
together with a fifth leading to the
royal palace. The gates are surmount¬
ed by similar faces, and in front of
them, flanking the causeway, are the
minor gods (deva) and their enemies

are called "apsara" or "devata", but the distinction between
them is not clear. It has become customary to call dancing
nymphs "apsara" and those in an immobile pose "devata."

"The flg-tree of the ruins reigna su¬
preme at Angkor," wrote Pierre Loti
70 years ago in "Un Pèlerin d' Angkor."
The botanical name of this tree is
"ficus religiosa or indica." "At first
no more than a tiny seed," said Pierre
Loti, "carried by the wind to a frieze
or the top of a tower, its fine, tentacular
roots snaked down between the stones...
reaching the soil, the roots swelled,
dislocating stones and splitting thick
walls from top to bottom. The building
was then irretrievably lost." Left, one

"fig-tree of the ruins" (see also the "Unesco Courier,"
January, 1965, "Monuments in Peril"). Right, the temple
of Ta Prohm, in its "natural," untouched state, bears
witness to the destructive power of the jungle.

Member of a Chinese embassy sent to Cam¬
bodia in 1296 on a mission lasting almost a
year. Chou Ta-kuan wrote the only eye¬
witness account known to exist of the
Khmer kingdom at the height of its splend¬
our. His invaluable "Notes on the Customs
of Cambodia " became famous In China. It
was an excellent piece of reporting, full of
life and acutely-observed detail, as may be
judged from the extracts below. It was not
until 1902 that Chou Ta-kuan's Notes were
translated in full by the eminent French
Oriental scholar Paul Pelliot. These extracts
are taken from J. Gilman d'Arcy Paul's
translation of Pelliot's version in French,
published by the Social Science Association
Press, Bangkok in 1967.
Notes
of a 13th century
Chinese diplomat
in Cambodia
by Chou Ta-kuan
I O the Chinese the country called Cambo¬
dia is known as Ch'en-la or Ch'an-la and to its inhabitants
as Kan-po-chih (Kam boja). The present dynasty, drawing
on Tibetan religious lore, calls the country Kan-p'u-chih, a
name phonetically allied to Kan-po-chih.
The Royal Palace, as well as official buildings and homes
of the nobles, all face to the east. The Royal Palace stands
to the .north of the Golden Tower and the Bridge of Gold.
In the chamber where the Sovereign attends to affairs of
state, there is a golden window, with mirrors disposed on
square columns to the right and left of the window, forty or
so in number. Below the window is a frieze of elephants.
Every man or woman, from the Sovereign down, knots the
hair and leaves the shoulders bare. Round the waist they
wear a small strip of cloth, over which a larger piece is
drawn when they leave their houses. Many rules, based on
rank, govern the choice of materials.
Only the ruler may wear fabrics woven in an all-over
pattern. On his head he carries a diadem much like those
worn by the vajradhara; at times he lays aside the diadem
and weaves into his hair a garland of fragrant blossoms re¬
minding one of jasmine.
Only the womenfolk of the commoners are permitted to
stain the soles of their feet and the palms of their hands.
This is forbidden to men. The wearing of fabrics patterned
with recurring groups of flowers is permitted to high officers
and princes. Ordinary mandarins are allowed to wear only
material with two groups of flowers, and women of the peo¬
ple may do likewise. Should a Chinese, newly arrived, wear
cloth with two groups of flowers, it cannot be charged
against him, for he is "An-ting pa-sha", "a man who does
not know the rules."
When functionaries go out in public, their insignia and the
number of their attendants are regulated according to rank.
The highest dignitaries use palanquins with golden shafts
and four parasols with handles of gold; those next in rank
have a palanquin with golden shafts and two gold-handled
parasols; then come those entitled to one palanquin with
gold shafts and one gold-handled parasol; and finally those
with only a gold-handled parasol. Further down the line
come those permitted only a silver-handled parasol.
For ordinary correspondence, as well as official docu¬
ments, deer-skin or similar parchment is used, which is
dyed black. The parchment is cut by the scribe in sizes to
suit his needs. A sort of powder resembling Chinese chalk
is moulded into small sticks called so, which are used to
inscribe the parchment with lasting characters. When
finished with writing, they place the so behind the ear. The
nature of the characters makes it possible to recognize the
writer. Rubbed with something moist, they disappear. All
documents are read from left to right, and not from above
to below.
In Cambodia the New Year begins with the tenth Chinese
moon, and is called chia-te. In front of the royal palace a
great platform is erected, sufficient to hold more than a
thousand persons, and decorated from end to end with
lanterns and flowers. Opposite this, some hundred and
twenty feet distant, rises a lofty scaffold, put together of
light pieces of wood, shaped like the scaffolds used in
building stupas, and towering to a height of one hundred and
twenty feet. Every night from three to six of these structures
arise. Rockets and fire-crackers are placed on top of these
all this at great expense to the provinces and the noble
families. As night comes on, the King is besought to take
part in the spectacle. The rockets are fired, and the crack¬
ers touched off. The rockets can be seen at a distance of
thirteen kilometres: the fire-crackers, large as swivel-guns,
shake the whole city with their explosions.
Every month a festival is held. The fourth month they
have ball games. With the ninth month comes the ya-lieh
or census, when the entire population of the kingdom is
summoned to the capital and passed in review before the
royal palace. With the fifth month comes the ceremony of
"bringing water to the Buddhas." Then Buddhas are car¬
ried from all over the kingdom, water is procured, and the
ruler lends a hand in cleansing them. The festival of floats
marks the sixth month, with the King enthroned on a
belvedere to enjoy the spectacle.
"The burning of the rice" marks the seventh month. This
is the season for harvesting the new rice, which is brought
to the South Gate and burned as a sacrifice to the Buddha.
Countless women arrive in carts or on elephants to watch
this ceremony, but the ruler is not to be seen. The eighth
is the month of ai-lan, or dancing. Every day actors and
musicians are summoned to the royal palace to perform the
ai-lan. In addition battles are staged between boars and
elephants. Foreign ambassadors are invited as guests of the
King to these festivities, which last ten days.
Every day the King holds two audiences for consideration
of affairs of state. No list of agenda is provided. Function¬
aries and ordinary people who wish to see the Sovereign
seat themselves on the ground to await his arrival. In the
course of time distant music is heard in the palace, while
from outside blasts on conch-shells sound forth as though
to welcome the ruler. I have been told that at this point the
Sovereign, coming from nearby, contents himself with only
one golden palanquin. Two girls of the palace lift up the
curtain with their slender fingers and the King, sword in
hand, appears standing in the golden window. All present
ministers and commoners join their hands and touch
the earth with their foreheads, lifting up their heads only
when the sound of conchs has ceased. The Sovereign
seats himself at once on a lion's skin, which is an heredi¬
tary royal treasure. When the affairs of state have been
dealt with the King turns back to the palace, the two girls
let fall the curtain, and everyone rises.

#^CCEDING to the throne
of Angkor after having overthrown a
Thai prince imposed by the Siamese
sovereign, Ponhea Yat, the king of
the Khmers, decided to abandon his
prestigious capital, prefering to estab¬
lish himself on the banks of the
Mekong, first at Srei Santhor, then
at Phnom Penh.
According to generally accepted
chronology, Ponhea Yat is supposed
to have abandoned Angkor around
1432. But in a recent study O.W. Wol¬
ters fixes his accession to the throne
at an earlier date and, consequently,
holds that Angkor was abandoned
around the year 1400. Wolters believes
that Ponhea Yat may well have merely
confirmed a change in residence which
his predecessors had already carried
out provisionally.
Whatever the date, its causes
remain the same. Situated close to
the frontier and renowned for its
splendour, Angkor was a much coveted
and easily accessible prize and King
Ponhea Yat understood this well.
Abandoned by the monarchy, fre¬
quently occupied and pillaged, its
sanctuaries mutilated and the cream
of its population departed, the city
was soon invaded by forest.
Although Henri Mouhot is generally
accorded the title of "discoverer of
Angkor", he is far from being the
first to have found the city which
was in fact never really lost. It was
a sixteenth-century Khmer king who
first "discovered" it. In the course of
a hunting expedition, he came across
this extraordinary city in the middle
of the forest, which his predecessors
had abandoned less than a century
earlier.
The Portuguese, Diego do Couto,
relates the circumstances of this
discovery: "Around the year 1550 or
1551, the King of Cambodia was
hunting elephants in the most dense
forest areas of the kingdom, as was
his habit. His people, cutting through
the brush, came upon some imposing
constructions invaded by luxuriant
undergrowth which they were unable
to penetrate.
"And this being told to the king, he
went to the site and, seeing the extent
and height of the exterior walls, wanted
to see the interior as well. Immedia¬
tely he gave orders that all the under¬
growth be cut and burnt. . . And, after
everything had been carefully cleaned,
the king entered within. After exam¬
ining the whole site, the king was
struck with admiration by the extent
of the constructions. For this reason,
MADELEINE GITEAU is a French Oriental
scholar and member of the Ecole Française
d'Extrême-Orient on whose behalf she has
undertaken a number of missions to South-
East Asia. Former curator of the National
Museum of Phnom Penh, she was commission¬
ed by Unesco to study and catalogue the
collections of the Wat Phra Keo Museum of
Vientiane, Laos. She Is the author of several
works on Khmer civilization and Asian art
(see bibliography page 42).
100 YEARS OF EFFORT
by Madeleine Giteau
he straightway decided to move his
court there" (1).
It was thus that, in the 16th century,
the monarchy returned to Angkor.
All the same, the date suggested by
Diego do Couto seems a little late;
inscriptions on the later bas-reliefs
at Angkor Wat tell us that these
sculptures were begun, on the king's
orders, in 1546. It is probable that
the sculpting of the later bas-reliefs
at Angkor Wat is related to the return
of the monarchy to the region. This
return, then, probably took place
around the beginning of the second
quarter of the 16th century, at the
latest.
The king of Cambodia at that time
was Ang Chan, a brilliant sovereign
who, for a few years, restored the
lustre of the Khmer monarchy. After
his death, the kings of Cambodia con¬
tinued, for a while, to reside at Angkor.
Portuguese and Spanish mission¬
aries then arriving in Cambodia were
able to see Angkor and their marvelling
accounts are to be found in contem¬
porary works.
The capital, however, remained at
Lovek, to the south-east of the Great
Lake. In 1593, the Thais captured
Lovek, Satha fled to Laos and the
monarchy, which fell back on Srei
Santhor, was beset by war and usur¬
pation.
Although their residence was at Srei
Santhor, or at Oudong, the Cambodian
kings continued to visit Angkor.
Throughout the 17th century, sove¬
reigns made pilgrimages to this shrine,
which had witnessed the great days
of their dynasty. The chronicles
mention these journeys, and the events
which marked them.
At the end of the 17th century, the
monarchy abandoned Angkor for good.
In the 18th century, the Thais and
Vietnamese exercised increasing pres¬
sure on Cambodia, so there was no
question of the kings either going to
Angkor or ensuring its upkeep. Little
by little the undergrowth crept back
into Angkor Thorn, though Angkor Wat
remained a cult shrine.
From the 16th century to our own
times successive new religious foun¬
dations were made and the site
attracted Khmer pilgrims and foreign
visitors. Evidence of this lies in the
accumulated statues in the galleries
and in the Cruciform Courtyard and
in the inscriptions translated by
(J) Quoted from 'Angkor et le Cambodge
au 76" siècle d'après les sources portugaises
et espagnoles", by Bernard Groslier and
CR. Boxer, Paris 1958.
Etienne Aymonier. In wood or in
stone, in princely or monastic attire,
the buddhist ¡mages of Angkor Wat
illustrate every school of sculpture
that has flourished in the post-Angko-
rian period.
Texts published throughout the 17th
and 18th centuries prove that the
ruins of Angkor remained famous. In
1676, a Spanish historian, the Domi¬
nican Navarrete, reported that, in
Cambodia, "There are magnificent
monuments and decoration more per¬
fect than one can say"; he recounts a
frequently formulated theory according
to which Alexander the Great "built
this most sumptuous of monuments,
enclosed within its courtyards and
cloisters". At the beginning of the
17th century, a Japanese pilgrim, who
had come to Cambodia, drew up a plan
of Angkor Wat, of which a copy was
made in 1715.
OLLOWING the Portu¬
guese and the Spanish, the French
came to hear of Angkor. In 1668, in
the course of a stay in Cambodia,
Father Chevreul mentions Angkor, and
emphasizes the fame of this holy place
throughout south-east Asia.
At the end of the 18th century,
Father Langenois, who had been sent
as a missionary to Battambang, visited
Angkor of which he gave a short
description in latin, a description which
was later made use of by Father Bouil-
levaux. Father Langenois recounts,
in a letter, the visit of the Portuguese
missionary, Father Carpo de Orta, and
describes a typical sculpture which
must have been a representation of
the ascetic Sumedha, an incarnation
of the Buddha in a former life.
Thus, at the end of the 18th century,
thanks to travellers both from the West
and from the Far East, the existence
of Angkor, the fine layout of its
buildings, the richness of its decora¬
tions and even certain of its sculptures
were known. These accounts however,
were only known to a restricted public,
since they often remained stored in the
archives of monastic orders.
If we cannot accord to 19th century
travellers the glory of having dis¬
covered Angkor, at least they have the
merit of having revealed the celebrated
dead city to the public at large. In
1858, Father Bouillevaux published a
description of Angkor, which he had
visited in 1850. Bouillevaux was
subsequently to contest the title of
"discoverer of Angkor" with Henri
Mouhot. But Bouillevaux had not
really discovered Angkor, and the

forgotten city
cleared from the jungle
profound beauties of Khmer art quite
clearly utterly escaped him.
This was not the case with the natu¬
ralist Mouhot, who visited Angkor in
1860. He died shortly after, but his
notes were published after his death.
If not the "discoverer of Angkor", at
least he appreciated the extraordinary
artistic value of these ruins. He
imparted his enthusiasm to the readers
of a variety of publications, including
the mass-circulation "Tour du Monde",
and from then on visitors to Angkor
began to increase in numbers.
A permanent Mission to Indochina,
later to become the Ecole Française
de, l'Extrême Orient, was founded on
December 15th, 1898, under the
patronage of the Académie des In¬
scriptions et Belles lettres. Its aim was
to study not only the monuments, but
also the history, the languages and
the civilizations of south-east Asia
and neighbouring countries. When
the treaty of 1907, concluded with
Siam, returned the province of Siem
Reap to Cambodia, the Conservation
d'Angkor was set up to clear and
restore the monuments.
From its foundation, the Conserva¬
tion was entrusted to J. Commaille.
When, in 1916, Commaille was mur¬
dered by pirates while delivering the
workmen's pay, his place was taken
by H. Marchai who remained there
till 1932. H. Marchai was subsequently
to return to the Conservation twice:
in 1935, and, in 1947, in order to
restore the South Gallery at Angkor
Wat. Since 1960 the Conservation
has been directed by B. Groslier.
Commaille's first task was to open
up the monuments, to clear away the
forest which had engulfed them, keep
the ever threatening undergrowth at
bay, remove the accumulated earth
and the piled up debris, and prevent
their further degradation. Only very
simple equipment was available to the
first curators. Nonetheless this was
sufficient to deal with the most urgent
problems.
The most important innovation in the
restoration of the temples was the
adoption of anastylosis, a process
which consists in restoring a monu¬
ment with its own materials and
according to the original construction
methods.
In 1930, H. Marchai was sent to
Java, where archaeologists had already
used this method. On his return,
Marchai applied the method to the
restoration of the temple of Banteay
Srei. Anastylosis was subsequently
used in the restoration of the greatest
monuments, and it has remained the
basic process for work carried out
since that time.
The piety of the Cambodians, and
the establishment of two monasteries
within the enclosure had saved Angkor
Wat from invasion by the undergrowth;
but ground subsidence and the poor
state of the stonework had led to
widespread decay. Long years of
effort have gone into the restoration
of Angkor Wat; the tireless work of
restoring collapsed elements, of con¬
solidating and reconstructing the gal¬
leries has begun; finally research has
produced good results in dealing with
stone decay.
The Bayon temple was cleared
between 1911 and 1913, and anasty¬
losis of the towers with faces was
carried out between 1939 and 1946.
After 1960, research was undertaken
aimed at removing the lichen which
covers the stone reliefs, giving the
monuments a leprous appearance.
w<ORK was begun on the
Great Palace of Angkor Thorn and its
approaches in 1911. Bas-reliefs in
the interior of the Elephants' Terrace
and the Terrace of the Leprous King
were discovered at that time.
Just before the events of 1970,
excavations had revealed a prolonga¬
tion of the Terraces to the north of the
Terrace of the Leprous King. Close
to the Great Palace of Angkor Thorn,
the Temple of Baphuon, built on an
artificial hill of light soil, had been
dislocated in ancient times by sub¬
sidences. The many attempts to con¬
solidate the monument had brought
only temporary relief and so, in 1958,
it was decided to reconstruct the
temple completely. This considerable
undertaking the base of Baphuon
measures 120 m. x 100 metres was
partially carried out in 1970.
Restoration work has been carried
out both within the enclosure and m
the surroundings of Angkor Thorn.
Three of the roads, lined by stone
giants, which give access to the city,
have been restored, each road leading
to a monumental gate surmounted by
a tower with four faces. The temples
of Ta Keo, Ta Prohm, Preah Khan,
Banteay Kdei, Ta Nei and many others
have been excavated and partially
restored. Following the restoration of
Banteay Srei, Banteay Samre, Neak
Pean and the central sanctuary of
Bakong were restored by anastylosis.
While the excavation and the resto¬
ration of the temples was going on,
researchers were studying the con¬
siderable documentation afforded by
these monuments.
Those who were beginning to take
an interest in Khmer art could linger
lovingly over the romantically exotic
drawings that illustrated Louis Dela-
porte's "Voyage to Cambodia" and
examine the first photographic docu¬
mentation in John Thomson's book.
Publication of the works of H. Dufour
and G. Carpeaux has meant that full
details of the bas-reliefs of the Bayon
are available to researchers. Car¬
peaux, the son of the famous French
sculptor, was to die at this task.
At the same time Commandant
Lunet de la Jonquière produced a
"Descriptive Inventory of the Monu¬
ments of Cambodia", a basic work
still of great value 60 years later.
The abstracts and architectural studies
of the monuments were primarily the
work of Henri Parmentier, head of
the Archaeological Department of the
Ecole Française d'Extrême Orient.
To pinpoint the vestiges of monu¬
ments, of successive town walls and
the traces of roads and hydraulic
works, Victor Goloubev directed an
aerial survey lasting from 1931 to
1934. This survey was resumed by
Bernard Groslier in 1951.
The sites of Angkor have yielded
a large number of inscriptions. Fol¬
lowing the work of the German epi¬
graphist Adolf Bastian, the Dutch
scholar Hendrik Kern became inte¬
rested in Khmer epigraphy. He in
turn was followed by the German
August Barth and the Frenchman
Abel Bergaigne who translated the
first collection of inscriptions. Finally
Georges Coedès published eight
volumes of these inscriptions and suc¬
ceeded in re-constituting the history
of Angkorian Cambodia and in bring¬
ing to life again great kings who had
long been forgotten.
Thus we learnt which kings and
dignitaries had constructed temples
and the nature of their religious foun¬
dations was revealed. Like Bernard
Groslier, Laurence Briggs, who publish¬
ed a history of Angkor, followed the
fortunes of the city after the removal
of the capital to the east. Finally,
Jean Filliozat, Director of the Ecole
Française d'Extrême Orient, began a
study of the temples as seen in
Indian texts.
An important step forward in our
knowledge of Khmer art was due to
Philippe Stern who established the
chronological order of the monuments
on the basis of the evolution of their
decorative motifs. ftft
Now, after a century of research /H
and effort, Angkor is as well known to
the general public as to the scholar
and the art-lover.

On the following pages we
present a remarkable series
ofphoto-studies of the bas-
reliefs of the temple of
Bayon made by a French
photographer, Luc Ionesco.
Ionesco spent five years
examining and photograph¬
ing the monuments at
Angkor, often waiting many
hours in order to obtain the
right shot. The result is an
extraordinary testimonial
revealing details with a
depth and precision rarely
attained before. A young
Khmer ethnologist, Soubert
Son, has written the com¬
mentaries on these photos
specialty for the "Unesco
Courier". Mr. Son was
born in Phnom Penh and
is a former Unesco scho¬
larship-holder for the study
of the conservation and
restoration of monuments.

he walls of the Bayon temple
of Angkor bear striking testimony to the exceptional care and
interest that King Jayavarman VII took in the joys and suffer¬
ings of his people. Towards the end of the 12th century,
Jayavarman ordered his sculptors to carve on the outer walls
of the Bayon the minutest details of the daily life of his
subjects, providing a veritable saga of the humble men and
women who had contributed to his empire's greatness.
A profusion of carvings of people, plants and animals unfolds
before our eyes like a gigantic strip cartoon, completely
covering the 1,300 square metres (approx 14,000 sq. ft.) of the
Bayon gallery walls (above, the outer gallery to the south of
the temple). The carvings present scenes from the everyday
life of the common people, their work, their food, their
amusements, etc. The daily life of the Khmers was linked to
the rhythm of the two main seasons of the year: the dry
season, the time of festivals and leisure activities, and the
rainy season, the time of work in the paddy-fields. Here the
close link between the temple and the rice crop is clearly
evident (see article page 6).
From sunrise to dusk, craftsman, merchant and housewife
went about their business. From 6 a.m. to noon the markets
were particularly animated with their stalls laden with
vegetables, rice, herbs and spices, fish and meat, silks from
China, pewter-ware from Chen-chou, porcelain from Ch'uan-
chou, fishing tackle, medicines, combs and trinkets and hard¬
ware of every kind. (Photo left, detail of a teapot measuring
only a few centimetres on the Bayon wall.)

12TH CENTURY DIARY IN STONE (Continued)
The Khmer sculptor had a keen eye for the human foibles and
idiosyncrasies of his fellow men whom he carved with
spontaneous realism and an occasional touch of humour. We
can pick out merchants and craftsmen, masons shaping their
stone (above right), pedlars selling grilled fish on skewers
(above left), cooks busy at their ovens preparing cakes,
cooking rice or serving drinks (below). Elsewhere the artist
regales us with scenes from the life of the nobility, from
military life, of craftsmen sitting down to a communal meal.
He shows us landscapes, farmyard scenes, cattle (right, a bull
tethered to a tree), as well as amusing incidents such as the
youngster pilfering goods from a stall while its owner is
taking a short siesta.

12TH CENTURY DIARY IN STONE (continued from page 32)
On the following four pages we present a photo-panorama
of one of the complete outer walls of the Bayon temple.
The bas-reliefs on the inner walls are devoted to religious and
court scenes. The outer walls portray scenes from daily life
and historical events in Angkor's past. Here the sculptors
gave free rein to their narrative talents.
Many of the scenes they depicted were doubtless inspired
by the festivities connected with the celebration of the New
Year and the Rice and Dance Festivals. Below, an acrobat,
lying on his back, manipulates a wheel with his feet, while
another actually seems to be performing a juggling act,
balancing children on his head and hands. A tightrope-walker
sways above the crowds, who watch with open-mouthed
admiration. Hunting scenes are frequent, with the hunters
attacking game of all kinds with bow and arrow, crossbow
and blowpipe. (Photo right, detail of bird perched on a branch).

FIND THE CROCODILE !
Amidst the wealth ofplants and animal and human figures in
the Bayon bas-relief (above), can you spot the crocodile and
fish, captured and magnified by the camera's lens (right) ?
If not, turn the page and you will see this same detail in its
broader fishing scene setting. The three photographs togeth¬
er illustrate the extraordinary carving ability of the Khmer
artists and their skill in portraying fine detail as well as the
revelatorypowers ofmodern photographic art. The panorama
shown on these two pages and the two previous pages
represents 26 metres, that is 85 ft. or one tenth of the length
of the wall with its bas-reliefs five metres (16y2 ft.) high
which surrounds the Bayon temple.

12TH CENTURY DIARY IN STONE (continued from page 34)
The temples of Angkor Wat were veritable cities within a city
and their towers looked out over a huge urban area with its
artificial lakes, its palaces, its residential quarter for ambass¬
adors and high dignitaries its jewellers' and weavers' stalls,
its painters' and sculptors' studios, its masons' and carpen¬
ters' workshops. Beyond lay the rural suburbs where lived
the peasants, market-gardeners and fishermen. Thanks
to the genius of the Khmer sculptors, many details of their
working methods have come down to us across the gulf of
eight centuries. For example, a whole sequence of the
Bayon bas-reliefs is devoted to fishing which, though practi¬
ced all the year round, really came into its own during the dry
season, when the amateur angler, freed from his work in
the paddy-fields, could devote himself to the sport.

12TH CENTURY DIARY IN STONE (continued from page 36)
In this scene (top of photo) a fishing-boat makes headway
through waters abounding with turtles, crocodiles and fish
of all kinds. In the stern is the oarsman, while, in the bows,
the fisherman has just cast his net. Between them, a third
member of the crew displays his catch. Fishing with nets
probably took place on rivers and on the great artificial lakes
which the Khmers built. The fishermen's flimsy craft are
dwarfed by the big pleasure boats, like the one in the centre
of the scene, on which the passengers amuse themselves
with all manner of games and dances. The bottom of the
frieze depicts a series of common scenes, including (right)
a group laying bets on the outcome of a cockfight. These are
just a few pages from this history book in stone, vibrant
with life, bequeathed to us by Khmer sculptors and artists.

THE KHMER SMILE OF THE BAYON (continued from page 18)
(the asura) holding out the mythical
serpent above the waters of the moats.
According to Paul Mus and to
G. Coedès, this is all intended to
symbolize the rainbow, linking the
world of men to that of the gods, and
also the Churning of the Sea of Milk,
a cosmic myth related to the grandeur
of the kings frequently found in Khmer
bas-reliefs, in this case sculptured in
the round and on a gigantic scale.
The story goes that in one of his
incarnations, or avatars (the Hindu
belief in avatars was retained by the
Buddhist Jayavarman VII by syncretism
between the two religions) the Hindu
god Vishnu, in the form of a tortoise,
upholds the Sacred Mount while
deva on one side and asura on the
other, grasping the mythical serpent,
with the Sacred Mount serving as a
churn, make many wondrous things
gush forth from the Sea of Milk,
culminating with the ambrosia of im¬
mortality (amrita).
Paul Mus suggests that the deva
at each gate probably have their corres¬
ponding asura at the gate on the oppo¬
site side of the town; and that since
the Bayon was situated at the centre
of these walls and gates, it was preci¬
sely a symbol of the Sacred Mount,
used for the Churning of the Sea of
Milk on a gigantic scale.
I HE fact that the Bayon was
considered to be the centre of the
town both gave rise to, and later dissi¬
pated, a serious error in research. An
inscription which is of a late period, but
lengthy and detailed, indicates that the
king who founded Angkor (Yasovar-
man) had the royal hnga or "God-
King", the phallic emblem of Siva,
erected on the central hill, and since
the temple-mountain of the Bayon was
at the centre of these stone walls, it
was assumed that the Bayon was the
first great Khmer monument. . . when
in fact it was the last.
When I began to study the Khmers,
this was the key used in dating all the
other temples, with the result that the
chronological sequence of the monu¬
ments of Angkor was the wrong way
round.
My whole career as an archaeologist
has been based on a method which
lays no claim to replace other methods,
but merely to complement them. It
consists in attempting to establish the
chronological order of monuments and
of the evolution of types of art, motifs
or styles, by making comparisons with
the development of a certain number
of motifs chosen on the basis of
experiments devised for this purpose.
When applied to Khmer art, this me¬
thod proved that the date attributed
to the Bayon was impossible and must
be considerably later.
I thus had the honour and the good
fortune, together possibly with some
insight, of proposing a complete
change which put research on the right
lines. I did not however go far enough
in either direction, and it was
G. Coedès, on examining the inscrip¬
tions after I had published the results
of my work, who situated the exact
date of the Bayon during the reign of
Jayavarman VII. At the same time, the
centre of the original town was iden¬
tified from the air by V. Goloubev as
being even more different than I had
thought.
The original error, as indicated in
my first book, derived from the fact
that the Bayon is the centre of an
enclosure whose gates are of the
same style as the Bayon and accord¬
ingly of the same period. Previously,
the successive centres of Angkor had
been located elsewhere.
Thus the establishment of the entire
chronology of the Khmer monuments
hinged on the Bayon.
At the close of my career, it was
again the Bayon, with the constructions
added by Jayavarman VII to monu¬
ments built during his own reign to
house new gods (this was a time of
great enthusiasm for deifying human
beings), which enabled me to cross¬
check the method employed.
To take a single example, the female
figures on the walls (devata or apsara)
differed considerably according to
whether they belonged to the first, or
the third and last period of the style.
Where these two different types, indic¬
ating the beginning and the end of the
style, are to be found side by side on
the same gallery in the same monu¬
ment, there is always between them a
vestige on the wall of the architectural
addition separating the new part from
the older one, providing objective proof
of the accuracy with which the
development of the motifs has been
studied.
This is demonstrated in my book
"Les monuments khmers du style du
Bayon et Jayavarman VII" which
includes the essential parts of the
texts concerning Jayavarman VII written
by G. Coedès, with whom I collaborat¬
ed throughout, constantly exchanging
archaeological and philological observ¬
ations. It also contains texts by
Paul Mus. To both these scholars, who
died recently, I wish to pay particular
tribute for their outstanding work.
While the Bayon of Angkor was the
temple-mountain of Jayavarman VII, it
is only one of a great number of build¬
ings in the same style. Examples are
the two great groups of buildings
dating from the beginning of his reign
(the date was estimated using the
method indicated above, and sub¬
sequently confirmed by an inscription):
the first, Ta Prohm, dedicated by the
king to his mother and his guru, and
the second, still larger, Preah Khan at
Angkor, to his father (the head of Ta
Som colour photo page 24 comes
from the enclosure added by Jaya¬
varman VII to one of his own, smaller,
monuments). But monuments in the
Bayon style are very numerous at
Angkor and even outside the Angkor
complex.
B Y far the most remarkable
site of all, Angkor itself contains
more than 30 temples; but scattered
throughout the country there are an
enormous number of Khmer monu¬
ments, many of which are remarkable
and some unique in style. Representa¬
tive examples of pre-Angkorian Khmer
art are the astonishing 7th century
group of Sambor Prei Kuk and, perhaps
the most perfect Khmer temple of all,
the small, delicately detailed, 10th cen¬
tury temple of Banteay Srei. It is a
constant source of anxiety to us to
think of the dangers to which they
are daily exposed, particularly the
temples at Angkor and the Phnom Penh
museum, with its unique collection of
Khmer sculptures, other Khmer temples
and the Cham monuments in what is
today Viet-Nam. Many difficulties have
been surmounted and much patient
effort devoted to the reconstruction of
seriously dilapidated monuments, some
of which have even been restored to
their original state, yet a monument,
and the work done on it, could be redu¬
ced in an instant to a heap of rubble.
These buildings which we have
studied for so long have become for
us almost like living friends.
We implore those involved in the
present hostilities, whatever their
convictions, to spare these monuments.
Most of them were the work of their
ancestors, a valuable treasure house
of beauty enriching mankind as a
whole, which is entrusted to their care.
They are also a tourist attraction from
which everyone stands to gain. It is
our fervent hope that once peace is
restored (which we all hope for, and
which must come one day), all these
beautiful monuments, all these totally
irreplaceable groups of buildings OQ
which we love so intensely, will emerge ^*»
unscathed.

Letters to the Editor
NEW
WMO EMBLEM
Sir,
I have noticed in the August-Septem¬
ber 1971 issue of the "Unesco Courier-
that you are still using the World Meteo¬
rological Organization emblem which
was amended by WMO's Fifth Congress
In 1967.

PERILS OF PESTICIDES
Sir,
The article by Gene Gregory in the
June 1971 issue of your excellent maga¬
zine tells us that:
"... some gifted polemicists, with an
emotional, romantic and mystical bent,
have effectively managed to persuade
many people, including some public
officials, that pesticides especially
DDT are dangerous and should be
banned. Contrary to many reports, no
one has yet been harmed in any way
by residues of crop protection pro¬
ducts..."
If this had been written at the end
of the last war shortly after the dis¬
covery of DDT it would have surprised
no one. But, published in 1971 in a
magazine concerned with modern world
affairs, it is, to say the least, a cause
for some astonishment.
If the idea of a complete ban on
pesticides is absurd, it is no less
absurd to maintain that pesticide resi
dues have never harmed anyone in
any way. Over the years, numerous
examples have shown that the use of
pesticides has harmful, often unfore¬
seeable, side effects which sometimes
deeply disturb nature's equilibrium.
One of the most striking examples is
the progressive disappearance of cer¬
tain species of birds due to a rise
in sterility and a drop in the hatching
rate a direct result of the use of
pesticides.
Unfortunately, such tangible harmful
effects are not confined to animals, but
are now being noted in human beings.
Certain vegetation defoliants, such as
2-4-5-T, result in genetic malformations
and defects, and some organo-mercury
fungicides can cause damage to the
kidneys and serious disorders of the
nervous system.
Many similar examples could be
given. Should we then ban the use
of these toxic agents? No, since we
can use them to control a wide range
of destructive pests, disease-carrying
insects and parasites of all kinds. To
ban them would result in unprecedented
disasters to crops and orchards and
the re-appearance of illnesses that
today have virtually disappeared.
So it is difficult to draw up an
accurate balance sheet on the use of
pesticides, particularly one that takes
into account long-term effects, many of
which are still unknown.
Another article published in the
August-September 1970 issue of the
"Unesco Courier" stated: "Minute
amounts of pesticides such as DDT
have been found to inhibit photosyn¬
thesis in marine algae by 75 per cent.
Yet we have dumped an estimated
1,000 million lbs of DDT into our envi¬
ronment and are adding some 100
million lbs per year."
This long-term effect upon photosyn¬
thesis is easily the most disquieting
factor of all.
What remedies can we adopt? Re¬
search is opening up new possibilities
of combatting parasites. These solu¬
tions include: the development of a
rational system of "pest management"
in place of the systematic (and often
excessive) use of pesticides; the repla¬
cement of a purely chemical onslaught
by an integrated attack which would
include crop rotation and a carefully
phased use of pesticides; research into
a biological control of pests by the
introduction of their natural enemies,
the use of hormones to attract or repel
pests and sterilization of the males.
Indeed, how much easier it would be
if only pesticides were not dangerous!

STANDING ROOM ONLY
Sir,
In his article "The Magic of Modern
Chemistry" (June 1971) Gene Gregory
assures us that chemistry is now
supplying and will continue to supply
mankind with the food, clothing and
other requirements for its continuing
life and comfort. Mr. Gregory seems
to forget that the population of the
world is growing and that the earth's
surface is limited; this means that one
day there will just be room for all of
us if we remain standing packed
together side by side. Can Mr. Gregory
tell us what chemical processes will
make life possible under these con¬
ditions? There wouldn't even be room
for crops, however well fertilized.
Your author also appears to forget
that food, medicine, housing, etc. are
not enough, and he slides very rapidly
over the problem of pollution and the
destruction of the world's beauty spots.

ELECTRONIC HANDS
Sir,
In its April 1971 issue, the "Unesco
Courier" published a photo of a "Soviet-

achievement. The Bayon represented
an entirely new departure which was
rich in significance, as it heralded the
irradiation of the Khmer country by
the Buddhist faith.
Such is the moving and impressive
legacy left by the last of the great
Khmer Kings. In his time, architecture
broke through its confines, effaced the
distinction between building and
sculpture, and adopted the rôle of
mystic diagram, way of initiation,
giving man the key to the universe
and the divine world.
During the 14th century, despite
the repeated incursions of the war-like
Thais from across the border, a few
weak kings succeeded each other on
the throne of Angkor; but the city
was abandoned in the mid-1 5th
century. The vicissitudes of war and
the widespread destruction altered the
rate of flow in the vast hydraulic
installations of the plain of Angkor.
The water, which was previously
clouded with silt, became limpid, and
fostered malaria.
The whole Angkorian mechanism,
which had brought wealth, prosperity
and power to the Khmers, seemed to
fall under an evil spell, and ground
to a halt. Fever and malaria compelled
the decimated population to desert
the immense city, now a useless seat
of pestilence. Pollution had brought
low a powerful empire.
Any attempt to assess the achieve¬
ments of the Khmers during their four
centuries of flourishing civilization at
Angkor should recall that the rice-field
and the temple were the two extreme
links in the same sequence of events
governing the development of the
area. Ecology illuminates the forms
assumed by art.

to illustrate an article entitled "A Soviet
Scientist looks at Futurology."
In fact, this photograph was originally
taken to illustrate the use of electronic
hands and myoelectric devices develop¬
ed specifically at the Rehabilitation
Institute of Montreal, Canada, and
particularly to show the various develop¬
ments that have taken place to improve
the original Russian hand prosthesis
purchased by the Rehabilitation Institute
in 1964.
The original Soviet equipment was
modified in several respects. On the
basis of clinical experience, all wiring
was incorporated in the structure of the
forearm socket. The reliability and
convenience of the device were improv¬
ed and the patient's comfort increased.
A versatile new battery package utilizing
a flexible plastic enclosure was develop¬
ed.
The Department of Research of the
Institute decided to design a new
control unit. The principal character¬
istics of this unit are a very good
stability and performance, small dimen¬
sion and negligible weight and it is
easily accommodated between the walls
of a laminated plastic arm socket. The
unit has been used on approximately
60 patients for the past four years and
has proved to be reliable.
The primary purpose of this com¬
munication is to indicate that the
prosthesis illustrated in your article is
not the sole result of the U.S.S.R.
efforts. It is the result of improvements
and research.

UNESCO'S NATIONAL
COMMISSIONS
Sir,
I read with great interest the article
by Mr. Wayne McEwing on Unesco in
the August/September 1971 issue of the
"Unesco Courier" devoted to Unesco's
25th anniversary.
I was much impressed by the survey
carried out by this young Canadian and
especially by his fresh and lively
approach and the sincerity of his
remarks.
Nevertheless, I regret that Mr. Mc¬
Ewing said nothing about the role of
the National Commissions in Unesco's
activities and that consequently the
uninformed reader might _ have the
impression that Unesco consists only
of a headquarters and Secretariat in
Paris, and be unaware of the national
branches of Unescothe National
Commissions which give Unesco a
strength and originality in the United
Nations family.
One further point, it is generally
accepted that it was Copernicus and
not Galileo who showed that the earth
circled the sun.

THE 2000 A. D. PROBLEM
Sir,
By the year 2000, 7,000 million people
will inhabit the globe, yet Gene Gregory
(June 1971) is calmly counting on
modern chemistry to solve the problems
that this will pose. But if mankind
concentrated its efforts on controlling
the number of births, none of these
problems would arise. If the population
could be maintained at a reasonable
level, the quality of life would be much
higher than it will be with the help of
the chemicals with which we are
flooded, and which pollute the atmo¬
sphere, water and food. Man, after all,
is supposed to be an intelligent being?
Yet thanks to these "miracle" chemical
products, we are slowly but surely
destroying the balance of nature, and
this may one day threaten the very
existence of life on our planet.

We were immensely gratified to find

THE PUBLIC AND MODERN ART
Sir,
The Inquiry by the International
Council of Museums into public attitudes
towards modern art ("Unesco Courier",
March 1971) was extremely interesting,
but the results are rather disappointing.
Putting to a limited, obviously con¬
servative section of the public the blunt
question, "do you like or dislike
modern painting?", was bound to lead
to one conclusion, namely that the public
is hostile to modern art because it goes
against traditional concepts of art. But
the artist should not merely produce
works which please and can be under¬
stood by people of average intelligence.
And surely the inquiry was Invalidated
from the start by a method of presenta¬
tion that could only baffle the public a
mixture of unidentified works, old and
recent, figurative and abstract, famous
and little-known, sometimes belonging
to several different periods of the same
artist.
Dr. Theodore Heinrich, commenting
on the results, pointed out that some¬
times a particular style of painting may
have been familiar to the persons
polled but not the particular painting
they were shown. These persons would
give their preference to famous paint¬
ings even if they were not in fact to
their taste. We know that if the ordi¬
nary man in the street still rejects
Mondrian's works, he nevertheless
accepts in architecture, painting, fashion
and theatre, etc., trends which have
been strongly influenced by the works
of Mondrian and other often criticized
artists such as Malevitch, Kandinsky,
Delaunay, Picasso, etc., which goes to
prove that the much talked of gap of
two generations between the artist and
the public does not in fact exist.
On the other hand, we may well ask
whether traditional easel and canvas
painting is not on the way out, to be
replaced in the future by mural art and
a synthesis of the arts. If this
happens, won't our present conception
of museums and art galleries be out of
date? If the public no longer goes
to see works of art because our
museums and art galleries do not attract
them, why don't we take these works
out into the streets, the factories, the
schools and public transport?
D.J. Corre
Chantilly, France
Dr. Theodore Heinrich (member of
the Toronto inquiry Committee on public
attitudes to modern art) replies:
Our fasfc was to develop and test
a practical working method that could
be applied in many parts of the world.
When that larger study has been done,
we shall be justified in starting to draw
conclusions.
The "blunt" question, "Do you like
or dislike modern painting?", was never
asked. The testing materials, which
had for fairly obvious reasons to be
anonymous, continue to serve their
specific purposes quite adequately.
The study was undertaken to provide
the museum profession with data upon
which to re-evaluate current methods
of presentation, interpretation and
education in modern art.
Our method allows for proper pro¬
portional representation of those already
interested, but for the first time begins
to represent that large tax-paying public
which mostly avoids museums of all
kinds, let alone those dedicated to
modern art.
The museum-going public is not
diminishing and public appetite for art
of all periods that it can enjoy and
understand constantly increases. But
the evidence collected does show a
sympathy among this public that de¬
creases in direct ratio with the new¬
ness and difficulty of art. We have
never suggested that artists or mu¬
seums should tailor their activities to
meet the approval of the broad public
(let alone the least common denomi¬
nator), only that museums question
their own methods in order to reduce
the clearly existing gap of comprehen¬
sion.
The sad, cold fact is that Mon¬
drian's own pure and beautiful paint¬
ings, for instance, are still 'caviar to
the general" and the reasons for that
are exactly what we are trying to
decipher.

Unesco's
25th anniversary ceremony
Ceremonies to mark Unesco's 25th
anniversary are to be held in Paris on
November 4 and 5, 1971. This issue of
the "Unesco Courier" goes to press
before the inaugural ceremony which will
be ODened by M. Attilio Dell'Oro Maini,
president of the 16th session of Unesco's
General Conference. The President of the
French Republic, M. Georges Pompidou,
and the Lord High Chancellor of the United

1948), Jaime Torres Bodet (1948-1952),
Luther Evans (1953-1958) and Vittorino
Veronese (1958-1961). Ministers and high-
ranking officials from many countries are
to attend as well as several former officials
of the Organization.
Nag Hammadi bibliography
Since the first publication, in 1948, of
information concerning the discovery of
Coptic gnostic codices in the vicinity of
Nag Hammadi (see the "Unesco Courier",
May, 1971), more than 2,400 items have
been written about the Nag Hammadi library.
Details of the literature published between
1948 and 1969 have now been brought
together in a single classified bibliography
compiled by David M. Scholer. In addition
to works dealing with the Nag Hammadi
codices themselves, the bibliography in¬
cludes materials on gnosticism in general
and on certain special topics which provide
a context for situating the Coptic gnostic
library.

EVERYDAY LIFE
IN 12TH CENTURY
ANGKOR
Photo ' Luc Ionesco, Paris
The temples of Angkor (Khmer Rep.) are considered one of the greatest
architectural complexes in all Asia. And among the wonders of Angkor,
the Bayon temple, with its multi-faced towers and sculpted walls
literally covered with thousands of scenes from everyday life, stands
out as the acme of Khmer architectural and artistic achievement. Depict¬
ed here are traders, surrounded by their wares, taking a hasty nap as
they wait for their customers to arrive. (See pages 30-38 for a series of
exceptional photo-studies of this "diary in stone").
