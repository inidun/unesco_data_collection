Unesco: 40 years of action
by Amadou-Mahtar M'Bow
FORTY years ago, just a few weeks after the end of the
Second World War, the Conference of the Allied
Ministers of Education, which was to adopt the Con¬
stitution of Unesco, met in London.
To the terrible toll of six years of desolation and death that
the world had just experienced was now added the threat
foreshadowed by the explosion of the two atomic bombs at
Hiroshima and Nagasaki. Over the ruins of the annihilated
cities, in the grief present everywhere, and confronted by the
prospect of new forms of mass destruction, the international
community became aware of the collective responsibilities
which it would have to shoulder in order to preserve the
future of the species.
Within the framework of the United Nations system that
had just been set up, Unesco was given the task of advancing
international peace and the common welfare of mankind
through "the educational and scientific and cultural relations
of the peoples of the world" in other words, international
intellectual co-operation.
In order to help to bring about "a condition in which the
incentives to war are neutralized by social, spiritual and
economic advances...", Unesco engaged in vigorous action
in many different fields the development of great standard-
setting concepts; the circulation of knowledge, ideas and
information; and operational activities to help the poorest
countries. This activity aimed among other things to foster
mutual knowledge and understanding among nations; to
facilitate by means of appropriate methods of co-operation
the access of all peoples to what each of them had already
produced and to what each was producing in all fields of
thought, artistic creativity and scientific and technical dis¬
covery and experiment; to bring about conditions under
which everyone should have equal opportunities of access to
education; and to allow the free exchange of ideas and
information.
Over the years, Unesco has constantly broadened the
basis of its representativity. Its action in this area has been
constantly gaining in scope and complexity especially with
the admission of nearly 100 countries which, during the late
1950s and the 1960s, acceded to national sovereignty.
These countries brought their historical and cultural ex¬
perience into the Organization; they expressed their particu¬
lar sensitivities; they evoked their own concerns. The de¬
veloping countries, in particular, raised questions related to
the difficult, sometimes even alarming, circumstances that
they were facing, to the manifold challenges confronting
them and to the various paths that they were exploring in
order to ensure a development that was authentic.
Unesco thus began to think about the reality of an in¬
creasingly interdependent world in which societies are in
contact with each other to a greater or lesser degree and are
part of a world system of reciprocal exchanges and relations.
On account of this development, Unesco, which had at
first focused its activities on certain parts of the world, was
gradually led to extend them worldwide.
During the past forty years, Unesco has thus made possi¬
ble the development of a host of communication, exchange,
co-operation and action networks, reaching into the most
diverse fields, leading to immense progress in knowledge
and know-how, and leading the peoples and the cultures of
the whole world to draw closer together.
Throughout these decades, Unesco has striven to draw on
three sources of energy the political reality of the govern¬
ments of Member States; the creative urge of spiritual,
intellectual and artistic communities; and the competence
and devotion of an international Secretariat that is called on
to encourage and co-ordinate the ideas, initiatives and pro¬
jects of all.
This is why Unesco is duty-bound to increase still further
the integration of the intellectual communities of the world
in the living tissue of its activities, so that constantly renewed
blood can flow through this tissue and so that the factors of
amalgamation and catalytic forces that give full strength to
the alchemy of intellectual co-operation can be brought into
every one of its great debates.
1 cannot conclude without adding that the world is today
encountering a number of grave difficulties that are reflected
in the functioning of the United Nations system and, conse¬
quently, in Unesco.
These difficulties no doubt provide a fresh opportunity for
re-examining some of the workings of the system with a view
to their democratization; they have, however, made some
people question the aims and purposes of the system and
even the very reason for its existence.
This is not the first time that the United Nations has faced
such challenges. It is therefore important that the heads of
the agencies of the system should shoulder their responsibili¬
ties in full measure.
It is no longer for them a case of merely expediting current
matters as best they can. Guided by their conscience, in
observance of the principles of the United Nations Charter
and of the Constitutions of their respective organizations, it
is also and perhaps especially for them to rise above the
contingent and the incidental in order to keep all chances for
the future intact.
In this year which marks the fortieth anniversary of Un¬
esco, it is with this conviction that once more I call on
intellectuals throughout the world to strengthen, through
our Organization, the ties of solidarity based on the forces of
freedom, creativity and progress themselves the very
forces of the spirit that Unesco exists to bring together.
This text is a slightly shortened version of an address given by the Director-General of
Unesco at the Organization's Paris Headquarters during a ceremony held on 12
December 1985 to commemorate Unesco's fortieth anniversary.

TheCourier
A window open on the world
Editorial
THE end of the Second World War sounded the knell
for colonial empires and opened the way to decoloni¬
zation, a new chapter in the history of international
relations. In the next forty years, around a hundred coun¬
tries were to attain national sovereignty.
The 1970s marked a turning point in this march towards
liberty. It was a decade which saw the appearance on the
world scene of nations which, "small" though they may be in
terms of area and population, nevertheless possess the same
sovereign rights as the largest nations. But how can they fully
exercise such rights and, by adding their voices to the concert
of nations, win a real hearing for themselves? This is not
always an easy task, and Unesco, like other international
organizations, has realized the need to help the small nations
which constitute a growing number of its members to be¬
come more fully integrated into the international order.
This issue of the Unesco Courier is devoted to the situation
of these countries, to their problems and their aspirations.
Because of space limitations we have been obliged to restrict
our coverage to nations which have joined Unesco since
1980, but we feel that the picture that emerges is valid for all
the rest.
While most of them are islands, some are land-locked;
they are thus all subjected, by definition, to a degree of
isolation. Yet they have an intense cultural life which makes
an invaluable contribution to the heritage of mankind. It is
thus quite natural that their presence in Unesco, whose fields
of activity are education, science, culture and communica¬
tion, is increasingly important.
In 1986 Unesco is celebrating its first forty years of ex¬
istence, and on the occasion of this anniversary, the Organi¬
zation's Director-General, Mr. Amadou-Mahtar M'Bow,
recalls the spirit and the ideals which prevailed when it was
founded , as well as its constantly widening field of action and
some of its achievements. Surely one of the most convincing
signs of the continuing validity of Unesco's action can be
seen precisely in the active involvement of the countries
presented here in the work of international co-operation and
understanding which the Organizaton is mandated to carry
out.

Small countries
and the international community
IMAGINE, for a moment, the captain of
a ship on a voyage of discovery. He
sweeps the horizon with his spyglass
but he is holding it the wrong way round . He
does not see small islands at all, and even
larger ones seem puny. Now suppose that
an inhabitant of one of those islands comes
aboard the vessel and takes a turn at look¬
ing through the spyglass, but from the end
which is turned towards him. The repre¬
sentative of the outside world and all his
trappings will look very imposing. The
islander realizes that it will certainly be
worth his while to come to an understand¬
ing with this impressive personage.
And this, indeed, is how small States and
large States perceive each other. Seen from
the vantage-point of a large State, a "micro-
State" seems even smaller than it really is,
and too often it is written off as negligible.
After all, did not the League of Nations
decide, round about 1920, that States which
it dubbed "Lilliputian" could not join it as
full members? From the opposite point of
view, small States see large ones as
looming, not to say threatening, presences,
but laden with wealth from which they must
find a way of benefiting.
Nowadays, the international community
sees small States more and more clearly. In
the 1960s, a State was regarded as small
when it had fewer than five million, or even
ten or fifteen million, inhabitants.
However, towards the end of the decade,
the less populated States were poised on the
threshold of independence. The United Na¬
tions turned its attention to the status that
they should be given. Specialists busied
themselves with finding ways in which these
new States might be associated with the
international agencies without disrupting
their modes of operation. The United Na¬
tions Institute for Training and Research
(UNITAR) worked to devise criteria for
defining small States, and its prime choice
was the criterion of population. With the
disclaimer that this was arbitrary and not a
hard and fast rule, it set the limit at one
million inhabitants.
During the 1970s, several States whose
population was well below the one million
mark joined either the United Nations
founded on the principle of the sovereign
equality of all its members or its Special¬
ized Agencies. Unfortunately, it is not
enough to be a member: it is also necessary
to be present and to make one's views
known, particularly at major international
conferences; and this calls for human and
financial resources.
Other international organizations have
since grasped the importance of facilitating
small States' participation in the concert of
nations. In 1983, the Heads of State and
Government of the Commonwealth raised
the question of the vulnerability of small

They are peopled by Cuna Indians, who
live in spacious thatched dwellings.
States, which were numerous among them,
and asked for a study to be made of their
specific needs. This task was entrusted to an
advisory group which submitted its report in
1985: The criterion selected by this group
was the same as that ofUNITAR, namely, a
population of fewer than one million in¬
habitants.
Also in 1983, a group of experts from the
non-aligned countries chose as the criterion
for small developing island countries a
population in most cases lower than 400,000
inhabitants and seldom higher than one mil¬
lion, combined with a territory of less than
700 km2 and not usually more than 4,000
km2.
The United Nations Demographic Year¬
book (1980 and 1981 editions) lists forty-
nine territories of varying political status
whose population is lower than 200,000 in¬
habitants, and sixty-four territories whose
area is less than 5,000 km2. In this last

category, all except nine are island States.
No mainland developing country meets
both the criteria of the non-aligned; on the
one hand, five developed mainland coun¬
tries do satisfy this requirement: Andorra,
the Holy See, Liechtenstein, Monaco and
San Marino (the Holy See, with an area of
forty-four hectares and 1 ,000 inhabitants, is
the smallest State in the world). The smal¬
lest developing countries with inland fron¬
tiers are, in population, Belize (158,000
inhabitants, 22,965 km2) and, in size,
Brunei (5,765 km2 and 220,000 inhabi¬
tants). Ultimately, if the twofold criterion
of population and area is used, the smallest
developing countries are all islands.
Small States are fully aware of the fact
that the interest taken in them by large
States is only spasmodic. The latter could, if
they wished, ignore them altogether. But is
this really what they want? The workings of
island societies are the outcome of perma-

nent tension between the assertion of their
own individuality and the need to fit into a
network of foreign relations. This is equally
apparent in the cultural, political and eco¬
nomic spheres.
Islands may be remote, but they show a
surprising receptiveness to the rest of the
world. The economic production of small
island States is usually highly specialized
and essentially geared to exporting. Where¬
as local products are exported, local con¬
sumption is mainly supplied by imports.
The exports themselves incorporate im¬
ports at every stage of production: plant,
intermediate products and bank credit. In
many cases, machinery must even be sent
abroad for repair.
It is no exaggeration that, for many small
States, the external sector represents the
entire economy. There is, indeed, an inter¬
nal sector, but it is confined to a quarter¬
master's role: it provides the consumer
goods and services necessary to the popula¬
tion or useful to export activities. It could
not continue to exist if it were not supported
by the income from exports or the revenue
of workers in the external sector. Such ex¬
ports may be agricultural produce (the
coconut palms which look so pretty on tour¬
ist brochures also yield oil and copra),
manufactured products (Mauritius, a sugar-
producing island, has become one of the
major world centres of the knitwear indus¬
try) or services (banks in the Bahamas or
insurance in Bermuda). Some countries
even export postage stamps: in Tuvalu,
their sale is sufficient to offset public expen¬
diture.
Several island countries also export
labour. It is quite usual to hear people say,
on small islands, that more of the islanders
are abroad than at home. For example, at
the time of the 1981 census in Niue, it
emerged that 5,091 islanders were living in
New Zealand, as compared with 3,278 in
Niue itself. Goods sent home by emigrants
can also play an important role in the eco¬
nomy. These invisible imports, in Cape
Verde, for example, represent more than
ten times the value of exports.
Small island countries are particularly
vulnerable to fluctuations in the world eco¬
nomy fluctuations over which they have
no control but to which they are compelled
to adjust. For instance, a very small change
in agricultural policy, or a protectionist
drive in a particular sector of a developed
country, or an international agreement
negotiated between large States, can bring
the economy of a small island State to its
knees. Such a State will then have no choice
but to seek favour with the large States, and
above all to become "visible".
For example, in 1980, the Republic of
Maldives, a small country with 176,000 in¬
habitants, classed in the category of the
least-developed countries, succeeded, not
without difficulty, in acquiring a small fac¬
tory for knitting woollen garments. In 1982,

^ it exported 40,000 dozen knitted garments
to a large country. The following year, the
latter imposed a quota of 25,000 dozen,
although the factory had already received
orders for three or four times that number.
The Republic of Maldives accordingly
turned to GATT (General Agreement on
Tariffs and Trade), which it had recently
joined to suit the circumstances. The costs
of participating in negotiations in Geneva
and in Washington were likely to exceed the
expected profits, but by what other means
could this tiny country make itself heard by
the international community?
The UN and its Specialized Agencies are
of vital importance to the small States. It is
only right to emphasize this at a time when
they are the butt of criticism. Such forums,
where the small can engage in dialogue on
an equal footing with the great, afford
advantages to both sides. The founding role
of Malta and the active part taken by Fiji in
the United Nations Conference on the Law
of the Sea are a good illustration of the
contribution that small countries can make
to the international community.
One should be wary of the over-optimis¬
tic belief that international organizations
can provide small countries with absolute
safeguards. The only stretch of land to have
been literally pulverized by a nuclear
weapon is an islet of the Bikini atoll, which
belongs to a Pacific Trust Territory of the
United Nations. It was blasted out of exist¬
ence in 1950 by a nuclear test carried out by
the trustee authority. Moreover, the
maintenance since 1964 of a United Nations
force in Cyprus did not prevent the partition
of the island in 1975.
In fact, the problem of the effective parti-
. cipation of small States in international in¬
stitutions still remains to be solved. The
financial cost involved is high. Goodwill can
help to lighten the burden: since 1983 Aus¬
tralia has subventioned an office which is
shared between the missions to the UN of
the Maldives, the Solomon Islands,
Vanuatu and Western Samoa. The perma¬
nent missions of Dominica and Saint Lucia
also share their offices. However, human
constraints are equally important. A coun¬
try with a small population, which by defini¬
tion has a very small number of officials,
finds it difficult to send them to represent it
abroad when they are required to give
priority to managing affairs of state at
home. For a time, the small island countries
were represented, when necessary, by the
diplomats of countries which were friendly
towards them. But nowadays they seem less
inclined to have recourse to this solution.
The States joining Unesco are also be
coming smaller and smaller. The average
population of the first 16 Member States in
1946 was in those days 59 million inhabi¬
tants (11.5 million if one discounts China
and India). The average population of the
16 most recent Member States and Associ¬
ate Members which are the subject of this
issue is 769,000 inhabitants. This is a wel¬
come trend. Joint action and multilateral
negotiations are particularly rewarding for
small States in their efforts to gain a foot¬
hold in the international order. Similarly,
international organizations are a useful
means whereby large States can hear what
the small and vulnerable have to say, so that
they may all work together to build a more
reliable, stable and just international order.
EDOUARD DOMMEN, ofSwitzerland, isamem-
ber of the secretariat of the United Nations Con¬
ference on Trade and Development (UNCTAD)
in Geneva. He was formerly a lecturer in econo¬
mics at the University of Mauritius and United
Nations Regional Adviser in the South Pacific.
PHILIPPE HEIN, ofMauritius, is in charge of the
UNCTAD programme for developing island
countries. With Edouard Dommen, he was
general editor ol a study on States, Microstates
and Islands, published by Croom Helm, London,
in 1985. The opinions expressed in this article

The quest for identity
by Raymond Chasle
THE emergence of the countries of the
Third World on the international
scene has enabled islands to assert
themselves as economically, socially and
geo-climatically distinct. The legitimacy of
their claims is now acknowledged, but they
have by no means won full practical recog¬
nition. Furthermore, the specific cultural
characteristics of islands have not yet been
given sufficient consideration.
Most islands have been affected by
changing fortunes and the upheavals of
history. They have been the targets of his¬
torical rivalry and of maritime greed on the
part of nations which have sought to exploit
their strategic value or have attempted to
impose trade monopolies.
As regards the people who live on
islands, we are talking in some cases about
human settlements so ancient that they can
be traced back to pre-history or to the ear¬
liest historical times. Alternatively, we can
say that settlements are relatively recent in
the case of islands which had no indige¬
nous population. Between these two ex¬
tremes, there has been an unending flow of
emigrants through the ages. The broad
miscegenation of island peoples, both
biological and cultural, may be traced to
chance encounters at ports of call or to the
deliberate settlement of groups brought in
as slaves.
As stopping-places for expeditions which
were often hostile and bent on plunder, and
as ports of destination for ships whose
holds and steerage had been converted
into "Negro pens", islands took in the
slaves who had survived disease and ill-
treatment, and with them their skills, know¬
ledge, beliefs and dreams.
After the abolition of the maritime slave
trade and the consequent emancipation of
slaves, the need to find substitute labour in
the form of hired workers soon brought
about a return to slavery. Thereafter, con¬
flicts began to break out, sparked by re¬
ligious, ethnic, linguistic and legal conten¬
tions in the various societies.
The replacement of traditional systems
by new systems of values introduced by
missionaries in the name of Christian
morality caused cultural confrontations and
turmoil. So-called "racist colonial" forms of
prejudice laid the foundations of laws, de¬
crees and new institutions which showed
scant respect for local beliefs and value
systems. Initially, all this brought about a
cultural breakdown. Then, by degrees,
islands achieved a vigorous and original
synthesis of their own cultural resources
and those imported from outside.
Traces of original cultures have survived
not only in the sphere of tangible assets
which are, moreover, threatened by
changes, not to say in danger of vanishing
altogether (architecture is a typical exam¬
ple), but also in the domain of intangible
values, which neither imported new reli¬
gions nor imported models of rational
thought have ever been able to obliterate.
The institutions transplanted by the col¬
onizers have been remodelled and restruc¬
tured. The languages of ruling powers have
become imbued with Creole imagery. After
whole decades of attempts to write imitative
poetry with crude emotional appeal, the
island poets, whose work has brought the
dream of the islands to fruition, have risen
to the top of their calling and now rank with
the greatest: Aimé Césaire, Nicolás Guil¬
len, Jean-Joseph Rabearivelo, Malcolm de
Chazal, Saint-John Perse (Nobel Prize for
Literature, 1960), Edward Kamau Braith-
waite, Derek Walcott. Many island poets
have also done much to generate and nur¬
ture the growth of social awareness in the
context of the struggle for liberation.
Modern communications and newly-ac¬
quired independence have enabled the
Creole-speakers of the islands of the Indian
Ocean and the Caribbean to discover and
recognize linguistic and cultural affinities, to
restore the dignity of the Creole language,
long neglected and dismissed as inferior,
and to emphasize the similarities in the
Creole spoken by populations far distant
from one another and the discrepancies
between the Creole spoken on neighbour¬
ing islands.
Encouraging signs indicate that the
populations of islands are becoming more
and more strongly attached to the basic
features on which they pride themselves
and which distinguish them from others;
they have already paid too heavy a tribute
to history to put their identity at risk; they are
not merely preservers but truly creative
crucibles of culture; and they must over¬
come the opposition between those willing
to be totally engulfed by the new and those
who cling rigidly to the old for a third way
is possible. It is possible to cultivate a criti¬
cal and lucid receptiveness to external in¬
fluences. They are coming to realize that
the dynamic forces of society must stem
from their own cultures and develop out of
their own intrinsic values, so that they can
guide their destiny towards a future that is
not shaped by external pressures. Plur¬
alism, ultimately, is the best antidote and
the most effective weapon against the soul-
destroying forces of standardization. H

Worlds apart
by François Doumenge
Tropical Islands, in spite of their beautiful
scenery and idyllic climate, are a prey to
serious economic and biological con¬
straints and natural disasters. Above, a
small island near Suva, Fiji.
I
"SLANDS are "worlds apart", so dis¬
tinctive are their physical and biologic¬
al characteristics, as well as their eco¬
nomic and demographic situation. Sur¬
rounded by the sea, they are by definition
relatively isolated, a condition which has
effects on their plant and animal popula¬
tions as well as on their social and economic
equilibrium.
Degrees of insularity are difficult to
measure. Islands with more than a certain
surface area are continental islands. Small
island countries usually have a surface area
of less than 20,000 km and a population of
less than a million persons.
Excluding islands in Arctic and extreme
southern latitudes and in the Med¬
iterranean, most small island countries are
found in the intertropical zone. In terms of
climate they enjoy definite assets, and con¬
sequently they conjure up images of lush
vegetation, agreeable weather conditions
and varied landscapes that are idyllic to
many a mainlander. Oceanic influences en¬
sure that there is a high degree of continuity
in the life cycle of plants, a high level of
insolation encourages natural productivity,
and the trade winds exert a beneficial influ¬
ence on the environment. Nevertheless,
there are constraints: a central belt of heavy
rainfall corresponding to the intertropical
front is bordered by two dry belts, with the
result that within a single archipelago
groups of very humid islands are sometimes
found next to quite arid ones. Moreover,
the alternation of wet and dry seasons is
marked by violent disturbances such as cy¬
clones, typhoons and serious droughts.

Among the native fauna of the Galápagos
archipelago in the Pacific Ocean, 1,300 km
from the coast of Ecuador, are the giant
tortoises which take their name from the
archipelago, iguanas, sea-lions (left),
birds and many small animals which owe
their survival to their isolation. The Galá¬
pagos islands feature on Unesco's World
Heritage List, and belong to the interna¬
tional biosphere reserve network which
has been created as part of Unesco's ma¬
jor programme on Man and the Biosphere
(MAB). The network, which today extends
to 226 sites in 62 countries, consists of
protected, representative areas for con¬
serving biological diversity within each
major ecological zone of the world. In 1985
MAB launched a project aimed at includ¬
ing in the biosphere network a number of
sites in the Lesser Antilles Region.
The kea (Nestor notabilis), a large parrot
and one of the most robust of its species,
Is found only in the south of New Zealand.
The bread-fruit tree (Artocarpus altilis), a
species orginating in the South Pacificand
introduced successfully Into the Carib¬
bean, produces large fruit (left) which
when cooked tastes like bread. Its seeds,
the size of chestnuts, are also edible.
^ Finally, as a result of their geological forma¬
tion and geographical situation, these is¬
lands are subject to earthquakes and vol¬
canic eruptions.
More serious than the susceptibility of
islands to natural disasters are the biological
constraints of endemism.(1) These are parti¬
cularly onerous since fewer plant and anim¬
al species are found on islands, because of
their physical isolation, than on continents.
These natural populations are fragile, since
their regenerative capacity and their power
of resistance are weak when faced with
overexploitation or harsh competition from
outside species introduced accidentally or
for economic reasons. The proliferation of
such species and their retinue of parasites
and pathogenic organisms may cause real
ecological catastrophes. On the other hand,
by virtue of their isolation, islands may
constitute veritable biological sanctuaries
for the preservation of species which might
have been eliminated in evolutionary com¬
petition among continental communities.
1. Defined by the Dictionnaire encyclopédique Quillet as
"the quality of being endemic or having a limited and
clearly demarcated distribution", the French term "en-
demisme" possesses not only biological or ecological but
also cultural connotations.
The application of plant health measures
and the judicious introduction of species
which could occupy an ecological niche left
empty because of an island's isolation may
yield excellent results, as is shown by the
successful transplantation of citrus trees
from Mediterranean countries to certain
South Pacific and Caribbean islands, or the
transplantation of the bread-fruit tree (Ar¬
tocarpus altilis) from the South Pacific to
the Mascarene Islands and the Antilles.
Demographically speaking, there is no
minimum viability threshold as such for
island communities. In practice, most
islands were originally occupied by small
groups of individuals. As a general rule,
when there are less than 20 inhabitants per
km2, land development is difficult, and
densities of more than 300 inhabitants per
km2 result in overpopulation.
Small island societies are particularly
vulnerable to outside interference, which
may reach spectacular proportions. In hu¬
man biological terms, islands act as a sound
box, amplifying effects which quickly die
out on continents. Island populations are
vulnerable because of their isolation, and
may be decimated by contagious diseases
introduced by immigrants or visitors. In the
nineteenth and the early twentieth centur
ies this happened on a number of Pacific
islands ravaged by epidemics of influenza,
measles, smallpox or cholera, which took a
heavy death-toll.
At present, regardless of natural or eco¬
nomic conditions, the demographic balance
of islands is still positive. Demographic
growth leads to emigration, which acts as a
safety valve when population pressure be¬
comes incompatible with the maintenance
of the living standards made possible by the
local economic situation. On some islands
in Polynesia and the Caribbean, the number
of emigrants now exceeds the number of
resident islanders. Beyond what level of
emigration, it may be asked, will it be im¬
possible to maintain demographic equilib¬
rium?
In education, population levels impose a
limit on the range of fields of training.
While a satisfactory level of general educa¬
tion may be achieved with a population
generating only a few thousand pupils, tech¬
nical education calls for larger numbers of
pupils in order to make adequate use of
costly facilities. To warrant the provision of
higher education, it seems that recruitment
must be made from a population "pool" of
not less than 600,000, provided that the
existing secondary education structure

reaches at least one quarter of the school-
age population.
Below these thresholds, it is difficult for
small islands to offer independently the full
range of educational possibilities and to
provide the necessary supervisory capacity,
particularly in very specialized fields. Stu¬
dents must therefore turn to overseas uni¬
versities. This vital contact with the outside
world can be made through membership of
a wider cultural sphere of influence, or by
the creation of regional higher education
institutions such as the University of the
West Indies in Jamaica and in Trinidad and
Tobago, which serves the whole of the
Caribbean, and the University of the South
Pacific at Suva (Fiji), which is financed by
the islands of the South Pacific.
The economies of small islands cannot
make an impact on international markets.
Their output is too limited to influence
prices. Their greatest weakness is that they
are subject to market fluctuations, except
where a former protective power or a neigh¬
bouring economic centre will guarantee
prices and a preferential market for their
products. This explains why small island
plantations declined in importance after the
eighteenth and nineteenth centuries. Their
agricultural commodities sugar, copra,
bananas or, to a lesser extent, coffee and
cocoa can scarcely compete international¬
ly. Without a superabundant supply of
natural resources, which is extremely rare,
it is hard for them to go beyond the stage of
precarious subsistence. Nor do their limited
internal markets, their lack of specialized
manpower and capital, favour the develop¬
ment of processing industries, which are
very few in number.
Ultimately, it is the range of possible uses
of the sites and situations afforded by is¬
lands for the establishment of service activi-
Islands, especially those of the Caribbean,
are regularly ravaged by cyclones, atmos¬
pheric disturbances characterized by vio¬
lent wind and torrential rain, accompanied
by tidal waves and even minor earth tre¬
mors. Although they only last for a few
hours, they can destroy an entire harvest
and ruin a country's economy. Photo be¬

ties which makes it possible to offset the
weakness of production and processing in¬
dustries.
Islands may, for example, be used for
technical bases within international trans¬
port and communication networks.
Although the bunkering stations of the
nineteenth and twentieth centuries and the
fuelling bases of the inter-war years are
outmoded, submarine cables and telecom¬
munications stations now face competition
from satellites, and today's long-haul airlin¬
ers do not need intermediate landing fields,
new needs have emerged. Port dispersal
facilities have been developed with the ex¬
pansion of containerization and the need to
divide up the cargoes of large carriers.
Other possibilities may arise such as the use
of certain islands as strategic bases, or as
observation stations for satellite launching
and tracking. The main advantage of the
integration of small islands into a vast
worldwide network is in making available
to them infrastructures which would
never have been justified for local use.
But for small islands tourism is the main
key to entry into worldwide economic cir¬
cuits. Since the Second World War, particu¬
larly with the expansion of air travel, tour¬
ism has come to play a dominant role in the
economy of these countries. The number of
visitors to even very remote islands has
sometimes equalled, or even exceeded, that
of the indigenous population. This has
brought an injection of economic resources
through investments, jobs and business.
Yet the excessive concentration of activities
into a single sector is dangerous since, as
well as any pernicious social effects it may
have, it creates a danger of destabilization,
the effects of which cannot be controlled in
the event of a political or economic crisis in
the system of national or international
relations.
Financial services are another field in
which the special nature of islands may

viding port facilities is one economic

situation.
prove useful. Under the colonial powers,
islands enjoyed tax and tariff advantages
which offset some of the disadvantages of
isolation. With the expansion of interna¬
tional trade and banking links, islands be¬
came desirable locations because their
isolation guaranteed security and because
their tax laws were extremely liberal.
However, this branch of economic activity
is also dangerously dependent on the inter¬
national economic situation.
The economic vulnerability of small is¬
land countries is not always an obstacle to
their development. Their viability depends
on their ability to predict the evolution of
the world economy and to adapt to it by
moving from one specialization to another,
rather than by seeking a diversification
which would be risky for their small-scale
economies. This means that they need a
novel economic structure and management
system, not necessarily that which suits con¬
tinental States.

The new frontiers
of the sea
SINCE the adoption of the Law of the Sea
Convention in 1 982, small island States
have been in charge of marine space
which is rich in potential resources and repre¬
sents several thousand times their land area.
The Convention, in addition to endorsing the
sovereignty of "archipelagic States" over
archipelagic waters, an endorsement which can
only strengthen the cohesion of these States,
establishes the jurisdiction of island States over
a vast Exclusive Economic Zone. Thus, the 33
coral islands of Kiribati, with a total land area of
approximately 728 km2 scattered over some 5
million km2 in the central Pacific, have an Exclu¬
sive Economic Zone of tens of millions of km2
over which to exercise their rights.
For small States lacking financial and technic¬
al resources, exploiting these new riches and
ensuring that their rights are respected over such
expanses is no easy matter. In addition, it now
seems unlikely that the much-discussed ex¬
ploitation of the mineral resources of the oceans,
such as manganese nodules, will be profitable
before the next century. As far as fishing re¬
sources are concerned, it is difficult for small
States to prevent the incursions of foreign fishing
fleets far better equipped than their own; nor can
they compete commercially with big fishing con¬
cerns which are already firmly entrenched in
international markets.
They can, of course, grant fishing and pros¬
pecting concessions to foreign companies, and
this may bring in substantial revenues. Never¬
theless, there is a risk that they will negotiate
from a position of weakness, notably through a
lack of technical and scientific resources, and
that they will not always have the means to
guarantee the exclusivity of the concessions
they will be offering.
But one of the great merits of the Convention is
that it creates favourable conditions for the ex¬
ploitation of marine resources, which may help to
reduce the dependence of small countries in the
fields of energy and food. Mariculture, for in¬
stance, opens up interesting possibilities for cul¬
tivating profitable species such as pearl oysters
and abalone, edible fish, and algae for the manu¬
facture of fertilizer, fuel and food for human and
animal consumption.
But it is above all through regional co-opera¬
tion (as in the creation of joint fishing concerns)
and through international co-operation, which
may help them to partially overcome their scien¬
tific and technological handicaps, that small is¬
land States will have the best opportunities to
profit from their Exclusive Economic Zones in the
near future.
Unesco's Intergovernmental Océanographie
Commission is among the leading international
organizations with responsibilities in this field. Its
programme on marine sciences and on non¬
living marine resources seeks, notably, to lay the
scientific foundations for the rational prospection
and management of mineral resources in coastal
zones. The Commission is also making efforts to
strengthen the capacities of its Member States in
the fields of marine science and technology.

Maldives
THE Republic of Maldives (formerly
the Maldive Islands) is an archipela¬
go in the Indian Ocean. The islands
are grouped into twenty-six natural clusters
or atolls (the English word atoll is derived
from the Maldivian atolhu), but are divided
for administrative purposes into nineteen
atolls with the capital, Male', forming a
twentieth division. Stretching 750 km from
north to south, the islands are the coral
crowns of a vast submerged mountain
range. Out of some 1,200 islands, only 200
are inhabited. The northernmost atoll is
some 550 km from the Indian sub-con¬
tinent.
The ring-shaped atolls of coral reef are
pierced by openings which are in some cases
deep enough for shipping. All the islands
are low-lying, usually not more than 1-2
metres above sea level. They have white
sandy beaches and crystal clear lagoons
with tall coconut palms.
Most of the population inhabit tiny vil¬
lages on remote islands, and live from
fishing, which forms the basis of the eco¬
nomy, and from collecting coconuts. Male'
is the collection centre for the entire export
trade and the distribution centre for the
entire import economy.
Arable land is minimal and, while small
amounts of coconuts, millet, sorghum,
maize and yams are grown, virtually all the
main food staples have to be imported.
Apart from fishing, the other most impor¬
tant sources of income are tourism and
shipping. Maldivians speak a common lan¬
guage, Dhivehi (referring to themselves as
Dhivehin "islanders" and to their coun¬
try as Dhivehi Raaje "the island realm")
and practise a common religion, Islam. In
Male' itself there are no less than thirty-one
mosques.
The early history of the Maldives is
shrouded in mystery, although according to
one authority the islands may have been
originally colonized, probably by people
from Sri Lanka or India, several centuries
before the Christian era. Until the twelfth
century AD, Buddhism seems to have been
the prevalent religion, and a number of
ruins of Buddhist temples and other sacred
places have been excavated in modern
times. Then, through gradual contact with
Arab traders, for whom the Maldives lay on
the direct route to Malacca and China, the
country was gradually prepared to receive
Islam, which was officially accepted by Sul-

tan Mohammed ibn Abdullah, who in 1153
proclaimed this religion throughout his
realm.
Two important features stand out in the
history of the Maldives. First, the orderly
fashion in which this small but scattered
kingdom was ruled; second, the valour with
which the Maldivians have defended their
country's independence against all odds and
superior powers.
Orderly rule sprang from the administra¬
tive machinery. The Sultan was acknow¬
ledged as the source of all power and law so
long as he ruled for the benefit of the peo¬
ple, which could, by custom and usage,
dethrone him or correct him if he went
astray.
As for the second feature, the Maldives
can be said to have remained independent
virtually throughout their history. The only
periods marred by foreign domination were
the fifteen years of Portuguese rule in the
mid-sixteenth century and two months of
rule by the Moplas of south India in the
mid-eighteenth.
The Portuguese, based at Goa in India,
began their period of colonial rule in 1558.

The period of British "protection" which
began with the forcible signing of an "ag¬
reement" on 16 December 1887 by Sultan
Mohammed Mueenudhdeen XI was not a
particularly significant episode. Britain did
not interfere with the internal affairs of the
Maldives to any marked degree. There was
no British governor or representative sta¬
tioned in the Maldives to advance their
country's interests. This was, in fact, an
agreement whereby the Maldivian Sultan
managed to keep a super-power which was
all-powerful in the Indian Ocean outside his
domain. For the Maldivians, foreign affairs
and defence were not so important so long
as they had unobstructed relations with Sri
Lanka, where they sold the dried smoked
fish for which they were renowned, and
obtained all the provisions they required.
The ingenuity of the Maldivians had again
managed to find a way to keep their own
world to themselves. The Protectorate
came to an end in 1965, and later that year
the Maldives joined the United Nations. In
March 1968, following a referendum, the
country became a republic.

The cradle of
Polynesian culture
by 'Ana Maui Taufe'ulungaki
Late 18th-century engraving of a Tongan
double-hulled vessel made of two dugout
canoes, surmounted bya centralplatform.
In such robust craft, capable of carrying a
considerable number of passengers and
provisions and of covering very great dis¬
tances, the early inhabitants of Oceania
set out to conquer the Pacific, a tre¬
mendous adventure which began around
3,000years ago. These vessels werestillin
use in Polynesia when Europeans under¬
took their own exploration of the Pacific
Ocean in the 16th and 17th centuries.
THE indigenous cultures of Fiji,
Samoa and Tonga were
homogeneous and shared a common
origin. The Fijians are usually classified,
using racial, linguistic and cultural criteria,
as Melanesians, a term which literally
means "the black islands". There is,
however, a considerable Polynesian influ¬
ence on the physical characteristics of Fi¬
jians and on their language and culture; this
came about through historical and geo¬
graphical associations. Archaeological evi¬
dence from carbon dating of Lapita pottery
and linguistic reconstruction of the proto-
Polynesian language point to Fiji as the
original home of the Polynesians where
they arrived 3,000 years ago. Shortly after
this period they settled Tonga and then, at
the beginning of our era, Samoa.
The triangle thus formed by Fiji, Samoa
and Tonga is the cradle from which the
Polynesian language and culture sprang.
The contacts between the three groups were
maintained throughout the pre-European
period and thus although they differ in the
finer details, their cultures are essentially
Polynesian. Fiji, however, received later
waves of migrations from Melanesia, which
did have some influence on Tonga and to a
lesser extent on Samoa.
All these societies demonstrated to
varying degrees an elegant and advanced
political and social organization based on a
pyramidal kinship system, which defined
rank, political and social roles in terms of
blood ties. Genealogical ranking is its dis¬
tinctive feature. The head of the secular
system also claimed divine origin and a
complementary religious system acted as a
validating and support system to the politi¬
cal structure. The "kava" ceremony, prac¬
tised in all three groups, with its elaborate
rituals expressive of rank, and the chiefly
language ofTonga and Samoa, illustrate the
Polynesians' preoccupation with rank and
chieftainship.
They were essentially a seafaring people.
Their great ocean-going canoes, skilfully
fashioned using only crude stone axes,
shells and bones, were capable of carrying
up to 250 men and testified to their skills as
craftsmen and navigators. But they also
practised agriculture, and cultivated the
same crops of yams, taro, bread-fruit, bana¬
nas and coconuts with similar techniques, as
well as keeping pigs and chickens. They
cooked their food in earth ovens and in¬
dulged in gargantuan feasts. Their women
wove fine mats and baskets and made tapa-
cloths decorated with intricate designs.

to the cultures of these peoples were the
missionaries. Their aim was not only to
bring Christianity but Western civilization.
The religious practices of these societies
were not the only cultural features con¬

everything that did not conform with their
notion of Western civilized habits was con¬
demned from political and social systems
to arts and dances, from games and recrea¬

kADIO broadcasting performs an essential role in communication
between the far-flung islands and atolls that sequin the Pacific
Ocean. Because resources are limited the job is demanding and
versatility is at a premium: in some island States a large broadcasting
service may have 10 or 15 producers, while in others two or three people
may handle all radio broadcasts and a small newsletter. In response to the
continuing need to train broadcasters in the region, Unesco in co-operation
with the Friedrich Ebert Stiftung (FES) of the Federal Republic of Germany,
the South Pacific Commission and the broadcasters of the Pacific, has
organized a project called Pacific Broadcasting Training and Development
(PACBROAD). The project was officially launched in 1985. It is currently
serving broadcasters on 1 1 island States stretching some 1 5,000 km from
Papua New Guinea to the tiny islands and atolls of Tonga. Some 50
courses were scheduled for the first year and a half, some in-country, some
at regional training facilities in Papua New Guinea, Western Samoa and
Fiji. PACBROAD is now working even more closely with island broadcas¬
ters and seeking to develop additional projects to foster broadcasting
facilities in Tuvalu (former Ellis Islands), Niue, Tonga and the Cook Islands.

The potter's traditional craft provides the
main chronological and cultural evidence
of Oceanic prehistory. These fragments of
ancient pottery unearthed on Watom
Island, New Britain, in 1909, belong to a
type of ware known as "Lapita" from the
site in New Caledonia where it was first
found. Similar fragments from a nearby
site on Watom Island have recently been
scientifically dated to around 550 BC.

values and manners.
In less than a hundred years these coun¬
tries had adopted Christianity and Western-
style educational, political and economic
systems, and with these many manifesta¬
tions of the superior technology of the
West, from satellite telecommunication
links to breweries and canning factories,
and from institutions of higher education to
disco dance halls.
Samoa and Tonga have become literate
bilingual societies, with English sharing
with Samoan and Tongan the role of official
languages. Samoa was a German colony
from 1900, a New Zealand colony from
1914 and a United Nations trustee adminis¬
tered by New Zealand until full independ¬
ence in 1962. Tonga was a British Protec¬
torate from 1900 to 1970.
Fiji, already with a legacy of multiling-
ualism, became even more multilingual as
well as multiracial and multicultural as a
result of her colonial experience. She was
ceded to Britain in 1874, and in 1879 the
British introduced the indentured labour
system under which labourers from India
were brought over to work in the coconut
and sugar plantations. When the scheme
ended in 1916, 40,000 of the Indians elected
to remain in Fiji and by 1956 had outnum¬
bered the indigenous Fijians. Fiji also has a
substantial population of Europeans,
Chinese and Polynesians. English is the
official language. The Bau dialect is the
most widely used of the Fijian dialects and
Hindustani is spoken by the majority of the
Indians.
But despite the changes, each cultural
group has evolved a distinct culture unique
to its members. The process of cultural
amalgamation has been a shared experience
common to all members of the group, and
throughout the changes the basic unit of the
social structure that of the "matai" (head¬
man) system in Samoa, the "mataqali"
(land-holding unit) in Fiji, and the "kainga"
(extended kinship unit) in Tonga remained
intact. Most of the populations remained in
villages, fully sharing the obligations and
rewards of community life led by a chief.

The ritual preparation of kava, a drink
made from the green root of the pepper
plant, is one of many traditional cere¬
monies which give meaning to the lives of
Tongans, Samoans andFijians. The root is
pounded to a powder which is then mixed
with water in a large hand-carved wooden
bowl. When the kava reaches the right
consistency, it is drunk from half a coco¬
nut shell by the officiants, who are decked
out in garlands of leaves and flowers.

them as subjects at the higher levels. And
despite the missionaries and advanced tech¬
nology most aspects of their Polynesian
heritages have survived and are flourishing.
But greatly improved transport and com¬
munication links with metropolitan centres
are bringing unprecedented numbers of
tourists to these countries and not even the
remotest areas have escaped penetration.
The improved education systems and in¬
creasingly complex economic systems have
created their own demands and expecta¬
tions which in turn are affecting the very
fabric of the social structures at the most
basic levels. The repercussions on rural life
have led to mass exodus to the urban areas
and to metropolitan countries in search of
educational and economic opportunities.
The question that arises today is how long
the vernacular languages and social struc¬
tures can survive the tremendous social and
economic changes taking place within these
societies. The Fijian situation is perhaps the
most difficult. With its now multiracial,
multilingual and multicultural heritages, it
has to decide on whether or not to pursue an
integrated cultural policy aiming ultimately
at creating an amalgamation of the dispar¬
ate cultural elements within its society or to
continue to pursue an informal policy of
segregated cultural development with all its
implications.
The problem for Tonga and Samoa re¬
lates more to the development and main
tenance of their vernacular languages as the
vehicles of cultural preservation. Both
countries are very much aware of the dan¬
ger and are now implementing through
their education systems language and cul¬
tural programmes at all levels aimed at both
development and maintenance.
Tourism, although it is often severely
censured for introducing undesirable cul¬
tural traits, has in fact helped to revive
interest in many cultural features, particu¬
larly in the creative and expressive arts, that
were in danger of being lost. Similarly,
overseas migration has made the islanders
more conscious of their national identities
and their communities have become strong¬
ly nationalistic and highly aware of their
cultural heritages.
In recent years, efforts at cultural main¬
tenance have become formalized and in¬
corporated into national development
plans, which is perhaps an indication of the
importance these countries attach to the
role of their cultural heritage in creating
positive national identities for all their
members. Such moves augur well for the
continuing survival of these cultures.

Until relatively recently timber was the

THE quest for economic integration in
the English-speaking Caribbean
started in the 1960s after the collapse
of the ill-fated Federation of the British
West Indies in 1962. After a vain attempt to
revive the federalist idea of political unity,
leaders turned increasingly to the concept
of economic integration as a means of pre¬
serving ties between the islands and the
mainland territories of British Honduras
(Belize) and British Guiana (Guyana). The
federalist venture, which was singularly en¬
couraged by the colonial power, foundered
on the rock of personality clashes, conflict¬
ing notions of weak federalism versus
strong central federalism, freedom of
movement between territories and insular
notions of nationalism.
According to Dr. Eric Williams, noted
historian and late Prime Minister of Trini¬
dad and Tobago, writing in 1970, "the
Federal experience as well as the post-inde¬
pendence situation in the Commonwealth
Caribbean showed that the quest for identi¬
ty and solidarity among the ex-British pos¬
sessions in the Caribbean had to be pursued
by other means namely, the method of
regional economic collaboration and the
working out of complementary rather than
competitive strategies of economic
development. "(,)
1. Eric Williams, From Columbus to Castro, the History
of the Caribbean, 1492-1969, London, André Deutsch,
1970.
It was self-evident in the early 1960s that
Caribbean countries were linked economi¬
cally more closely to the metropolitan coun¬
tries (in particular the former colonial
power) than to each other. This factor in
itself produced and perpetuated vertical,
bi-lateral trading relations between each
country on the one hand and countries out¬
side the region on the other hand. As a
result, intra-regional, horizontal economic
relations, the development of multilateral
commerce and the rationalization of fiscal
and excise policies were non-existent,
thereby contributing to the continued eco¬
nomic isolation of individual countries.
In 1965, then, the leaders of Antigua,
Barbados and British Guiana concluded an
agreement to establish a Free Trade Area.
By 1967, other territories had accepted the
principle of such an association and at the
Heads of Government Conference in Bar¬
bados in October 1967 adopted a number of
resolutions aimed at establishing a Carib¬
bean Free Trade Association (CARIFTA);
creating a Caribbean regional development
bank; and furthering the integration pro¬
cess. The CARIFTA Agreement, ratified
by the three founding members at St.
John's, Antigua, entered into force on 1
May 1968. At the same time, other territor¬
ies signed a Protocol of Interest and pledged
to become members.
It may be useful at this point to place this
initial integration effort in perspective. One
cannot underestimate the economic legacy
of three centuries of colonialism which

assigned to the Caribbean territories the
role of producers of primary commodities
and suppliers of cheap labour for metropo¬
litan consumption. The pattern of single-
crop industries led to the neglect of diversi¬
fication and accentuated dependence on
favoured treatment by the colonial power.
Agricultural production for the domestic
market and the gradual expansion of the
industrial base received scant attention, re¬
sulting in the increased vulnerability of
national economies of the Caribbean.
Nor can one underestimate the consider¬
able prestige and influence of Sir Arthur
Lewis on West Indian economic thinking in
the 1950s and 1960s. In the 1950s the future
Nobel Prize-winner in Economics, a citizen
of Saint Lucia, produced two seminal works
which left their impact on economic policy
in the region for some time. In an article
published in 1950, Sir Arthur argued that:
"A poor people spends a very high propor¬
tion of its income on food and shelter, and
only a small proportion on manufactures.
At their present low standard of living, the
number of persons for whom West Indians
can provide employment in manufacturing
by their own purchases is extremely
small."(2)
The apparent anti-industrialization slant
was later to be echoed in a classic article in
which Lewis shows that in a dualistic eco¬
nomy the sector offering higher wages will
attract labour without necessarily depress¬
ing those of the rival sector when the labour
supply is precisely "unlimited". (3) Lewis'
theory therefore seemed to lay the justifica¬
tion for attracting foreign capital and tech¬
nology which would avail themselves of in¬
expensive labour on the local market.
The relatively cheap and abundant
labour supply in Caribbean countries
prompted political leaders to open their
economies to the North American multi¬
nationals which installed light manufactur¬
ing plants and benefited from highly attrac¬
tive fiscal incentives. However, their pre¬
sence resulted in investment in capital in¬
tensive activities which hardly addressed
the root cause of high unemployment: the
absence of a wide spectrum of agricultural
and industrial activity supplying both the
domestic and export markets. Secondly, a
significant percentage of multinational pro-

Lost islands
There are so many islands lost in the Caribbean.
I do not lose count of their seeds.
I recognize them in the tattoos that infamy
has left on their weary American backs.
They have all lived centuries on the cross.
These isles disposed in the shape of a bow
have fine arrows
for the pleasure of tourists:
spicy dishes, ever golden rum,
pineapples, oranges, mangoes, guava,
meringué, laghia, calypso, bel-air,
flamboyant trees and bougainvillea
cock-fighting, carnival,
voodoo and folklore at every turn
and women who are the sailing ships
of the last gardens of delight.
Our isles have no Yoruba or Bantu names
they are paths without identity papers:
isle where the racial volcano erupts
isle where the alphabet never goes ashore
isle which shaves with a shard of broken bottle
isle which exports both its blood and its secrets
isle with its head astray on the shoulder of others.
Once, many years
before the death of my body
I was dead in my spirit
I was prostrate, stone dead
in my drifting dreams
one of these isles suddenly
restored to me my state of poetry.

fits was repatriated to the North and could
not be re-invested locally so as to contribute
to the growth of national investment . Third¬
ly, the increasingly high cost of the required
technology proved frequently beyond the
means of such small countries. It must also
be noted that the severely limited tax base
did not generate the funds necessary for
major public capital investment in infra¬
structure.
The foregoing elements demonstrate that
as these territories moved towards inde¬
pendence in the 1960s and 1970s, they were
characterized by very small, mono-crop,
technically and financially weak economies
producing for limited markets. The prob¬
lem, then, was how best to unite more than
a dozen territories into a credible economic
zone in the face of ever rising international
competition and inflationary pressures,
compounded by falling prices of non-pet¬
roleum primary commodities. The absence
of economies of scale and a critical level of
economic activity underscored the need for
an institution affording stronger integration
links than those offered by a Free Trade
Association. Thus in July 1973 was signed
the Treaty of Chaguaramas, instituting the
Caribbean Community and Common Mar¬
ket (CARICOM) providing for increased
co-operation under three headings: Com¬
mon Market, Functional Co-operation and
the Co-ordination of Foreign Policy.
The Treaty of Chaguaramas provides
for two classifications of Member States.
Firstly, the More Developed Countries
(MDCs), comprising Barbados, Guyana,
Jamaica, and Trinidad and Tobago.
Secondly, there are the Less Developed
Countries (LDCs), including Antigua and
Barbuda, Belize, Dominica, Grenada,
Montserrat, Saint Christopher and Nevis,
Saint Lucia, Saint Vincent and the Grena¬
dines. The latter were able, during negotia¬
tions leading up to the Treaty, to persuade
the MDCs that given their more fragile
economies they were entitled to special con¬
sideration. The integration movement had
to take into account the reality of the highly
uneven economic development of Member
States and devise mechanisms tending to
protect the economies of the LDCs. One
may note, for example, that with a popula¬
tion of 260,000, Barbados has a Gross
Domestic Product double that of all the
LDCs combined, which have a population
of approximately 600,000.
However intense and sincere might have
been the underlying intentions and efforts,
the integration movement clearly could not
exist in a Caribbean vacuum. Caribbean
solidarity inevitably had to cope with reali¬
ties external to the region and adapt to the
shifting tempo of the international econo¬
mic and financial context which dramatical¬
ly changed in 1973, the year of the Cha¬
guaramas Treaty, with the first oil shock.
Whereas Trinidad and Tobago, with its oil
resources, was able to profit from the price
spiral, the other countries, in particular the
LDCs, were hard pressed by a constantly
rising energy bill which compromised in¬
vestment capabilities.
The subsequent conservative political
reaction, with its inevitable monetarist eco¬
nomic policies and austerity measures, ^

^ further undermined the thrust towards eco¬
nomic integration. The world recessions of
1974-1975 and 1981-1983 were to leave their
mark on struggling Caribbean economies.
Jamaica and Guyana, both heavily depen¬
dent on their bauxite industry, were the
hardest hit in the 1970s by the downturn of
the world economy. In turn, intra-regional
trade suffered from the slowdown of these
two important markets, along with that of
Barbados, which witnessed the tapering off
of the tourist trade. In 1984 alone, intra-
regional trade fell by approximately 13 per
cent. The drop in trade was largely re¬
sponsible for the difficulties of the CARI-
COM Multilateral Clearing Facility
(CMCF), which was established in 1977 to
create an efficient payments system and
provide short-term credits while ameliorat¬
ing the foreign exchange situation. The
CMCF encountered difficulties and lapsed
into virtual neglect as early as 1982, when
Guyana defaulted on its payment.
Any decline in intra-regional trade neces¬
sarily has adverse consequences for all re¬
gional economies and in particular those of
the LDCs with a weaker base. Certain pro¬
tectionist measures adopted by the MDCs
could almost be interpreted as punitive ac¬
tions against the free flow of exports from
the LDCs, for there is little doubt that the
wider CARICOM market has assumed
major significance for LDC countries. Be¬
tween 1973 and 1981 , exports from LDCs to
CARICOM increased by over 600 per cent,
more especially in the area of light manufac¬
tures. However, the problem of market size
arises whenever a MDC decides to apply
import restrictions, as decided by Trinidad
and Tobago, where imports from CARI¬
COM fell by 30 per cent in 1985.
A further development tending to re¬
inforce the capability of the smaller Eastern
Caribbean States was the establishment in
July 1981 of the Organization of Eastern
Caribbean States (OECS) regrouping Anti¬
gua and Barbuda, Dominica, Grenada,
Montserrat, Saint Christopher and Nevis,
Saint Lucia, and Saint Vincent and the Gre¬
nadines. In addition to co-operation at the
political, judicial and cultural levels, the
OECS Treaty provides for the promotion of
economic integration. The creation of an
Economic Affairs Committee and the East
Caribbean Common Market attests to the
importance attached by Member States to
the problem of economic development.
Yet it must be recognized that the econo¬
mic situation of the early 1980s has acted as
a severe constraint on these efforts. Despite
the overall rise in protectionist attitudes,
the general thrust towards economic in¬
tegration seems to be firmly established in
the political consciousness of the region.
New perspectives will need to be explored
and fully exploited. Among these one may
cite the possibilities offered under the Lomé
III Agreement. In the final analysis, it is
perhaps useful to reflect on whether in¬
tegration does not constitute a function of
economic growth and therefore suffers
when growth decreases. If the corollary
holds true, i.e., that integration promotes
growth, then Caribbean countries have
established the necessary institutional fab¬
ric to propel such growth inspired by integ¬
ration. But only time will determine which
of these two possibilities bears the greater
historical validity.

FOR the handsome equatorial island
of Sao Tomé, with its smaller neigh¬
bour Principe, independence, in
1975, signalled a fortunate end to a sad and
violent history. Sparsely settled by Portu¬
guese in the second half of the fifteenth
century, these tropical islands some 300
kilometres west of Gabon and Equatorial
Guinea became, almost at once, a centre of
the Atlantic slave trade and the scene of a
slave economy based on crops for export, of
which cocoa was to be the most valuable.
Populated initially as a fief of the Portu¬
guese Crown, and later by traders and plan¬
ters from Portugal, the islands gave birth to
a people of mixed origins filhos da terra,
"sons of the country" whose formal loyal¬
ty was to Portugal but whose inner identity
remained local to the islands.
As in the larger Cape Verde archipelago
to the north, where history took much the
same course, the "sons of the country" were
rapidly outnumbered by African captives
brought in as slave labour from the neigh¬
bouring mainland, but chiefly from the
lands which became Angola. When slavery
fell gradually away in the nineteenth cen¬
tury, the same continuous import of main¬
land Africans and Cape Verdeans was en¬
sured to the cocoa plantations by new if
concealed forms of enslavement or, as it
was called, "contract labour". This import
went on for decades.
One consequence of this strange history
was that the people of Sao Tomé and Prin¬
cipe became, and have since remained, an
authentically African people, even though
the mythologies of Portuguese imperialism
have preferred to present them as actually
or potentially "Portuguese". Another con¬
sequence was that they shared in the aspira¬
tions and the struggle for independence,
t
Cocoa galore. The principal cash crop of
Sao Tomé and Principe, cocoa provides
80%-90% of the country's exportearnings.
The cocoa and coffee plantations intro¬
duced in the late 19th centuryby the Portu¬
guese colonists are today being rehabili¬
tated by the government. Agricultural co¬
operatives are also being created and
crops diversified in an attempt to reduce
dependence on the fluctuating world
cocoa market and on Imported foodstuffs.

from Portugal and its empire, of all the
African peoples subjected by the soldiers
and administrators of Lisbon. In 1975 the
Portuguese administration withdrew with¬
out warfare, and most of the white popula¬
tion left the islands, leaving fewer than 100
whites in that notable year of anti-colonial
change. The newly-formed Republic at
once joined the loosely-organized grouping
of "ex-Portuguese" African countries.
The instrument of independence was a
nationalist movement, Movimento de
Libertaçâo de Sao Tomé e Príncipe, whose
leading members had spent the final years
of Portuguese rule in exile, chiefly in
Gabon. Some 10,000 Angolan "contract
workers" went home to their own country
and its new freedoms, while most of the
Cape Verdean workers made the same
choice. Left without any form of modern
development, the economy of the islands
has thus required urgent reconstruction,
while, at the same time, the nationalists
have had to cope with the problems of
nation-building in circumstances of often
acute difficulty. After a number of troubles
and disputes, the early 1980s brought stabil¬
ity under a government which has ensured
good relations with Angola, within the
framework of the Organization of African
Unity, and an effort to use foreign aid from
diverse sources, whether in East or West.

BOTSWANA is the ancient country of
the BaTswana or Tswana people, a
modern State and member of the
community of nations which has developed
from a long but markedly successful strug¬
gle for mastery of a most difficult environ¬
ment. Far back in time, at least fifteen
centuries ago, early ancestors of the major¬
ity of the BaTswana came into this arid
plateau from plains and highlands to the
east, explored its potential for raising cattle,
and began to settle here. They were not the
first people to live in this wide Kalahari
region, for Stone Age hunters of Khoi ori¬
gins ("Bushmen" in white parlance) had
long preceded them. But they were the first
people, supported by their iron-making and
food-producing skills, to form long-term
settlements and villages.
Their achievement was to discover and
develop a mode of life which could meet the
challenge of an always low rainfall, limited
pasture, and natural obstacles to survival
that were inherent in the conditions they
encountered. Given such obstacles, the
BaTswana have repeatedly succeeded by
means of great persistence, ingenuity and
courage. In modern times their total num¬
bers, consisting chiefly of eight large ethnic
groups (all of the Bantu-language family)
and of several smaller ones, have steadily
grown in size. Although varying among

themselves, their underlying cultures are
closely related to each other, and their
sense of identity is powerfully expressed in
their Botswana nationhood. While their
economy has remained largely pastoral,
they also depend to a small extent on crop
cultivation. Important mineral discoveries
have lately begun to provide new sources of
national wealth.
One of the world's richest diamond
"pipes" more or less "vertical" rock seams
"sewn" with industrial diamonds and gem
stones was found at Orapa in 1967 and
began to yield four years later. Another
such "pipe" was then discovered nearby at
Letlhakane, and a third, possibly richer
still, not long after at Jwaneng, where pro¬
duction opened in 1982. By late in the
1980s, it was thought, these three diamond
mines would yield as much as 20 per cent of
world-wide production. Diamonds bring a
valuable and unexpected source of revenue
to an otherwise poorly-endowed economy.
Other mineral sources of revenue, no¬
tably copper and nickel, have yet to meet
initial expectations of profit, but Bots¬
wana's large deposits of coal are thought to
total some 400 million tonnes. While coal
mining remains at a relatively early stage,
most of what is now produced is already an
indispensable source of thermally-pro¬
duced electric power. Recent mineral sur¬
veys have indicated the probable or certain
presence of manganese and other useful
ores, including uranium. Generally,
however, this "mineral revolution" has yet
to get into its stride, while its "spread" of
resultant benefits so far reaches only a part
of the population. The government's prog¬
rammes of development intend to alter this
situation. The years immediately ahead
should see progress in this direction.
Independence brought gains but also
problems after colonial Bechuanaland be¬
came independent Botswana in 1966. But in
facing this challenge the country's political
parties and their constituent institutions
have borne witness to a quiet confidence in
this people's ability to translate problems
into solutions. Whatever new difficulties
have come or may now come from their
neighbour to the south, the South African
apartheid State in its endemic instability,
the BaTswana have had the advantage of a
very instructive history during the imperial¬
ist period. The birth of their State has not
been easy, and they have had to learn the
lessons of a stern realism. Their present
leaders, moreover, can look back to several
notable predecessors, notably the Chief
Khama Khama the Great, as he is not
unreasonably called during the late
nineteenth century, and, more recently, his
descendant Chief Tskedi Khama.
These men proved able to meet and
somewhat mitigate the brusque onset of the
"modern world" in the abrasive form of
British and South African imperialism. For
much of the early colonial period the coun¬
try then known as Bechuanaland was seen
by leading British imperialists, above all
Cecil John Rhodes, as little more than a
"Suez Canal towards the North". Khama
and his successors were able to use this
perception as a means of avoiding complete
colonial enclosure, and to keep most of
their country as a "protectorate" which
allowed a wide margin for their own politic¬
al control. Modern Botswana leaders have
shown the same political skill in affirming
and in buttressing their country's national
independence. Here is an African country
and people that have repeatedly shown how
to develop weakness into strength.

Aerial view of modern Harare (formerly
Salisbury), capital of Zimbabwe. The city
(pop. 656,000 at the 1982 census) derives
its name from that ofChiefNeharawe, who,
with his people, occupied the site when it
was seized in 1890 by the British South
Africa Company's Pioneer Column.
NAMED after its famous stone ruins,
medieval in date and wholly African
in conception and construction, the
splendid country of Zimbabwe may be said
to stand at the heart of southern African
history. Every important stage in that his¬
tory, over many centuries, has left its strong
and often dramatic mark upon this people
and their land; and this remains as likely to
be true in the future as it has been in the
past. Zimbabwe, in a large historical sense,
epitomizes all the challenges and ventures
of the African south, whether for worse or
for better, in despair or in vivid hope.
Compared with Botswana, Zimbabwe
has been blessed by nature, being a land of
wide pastures, pleasant hills and flowing
rivers, adequate though seldom abundant
rainfall except in times of cyclical drought,
and fruitful human settlement. Since inde¬
pendence came in 1980, democratic policies
have begun to overcome the gross inequali¬
ties of ownership of land and wealth, as
between a small minority of white settlers
and a large majority of indigenous Africans,
that were imposed, often manu militari,
during colonial occupation.
The ancient history of Zimbabwe was
largely the epic struggle of its Shona people
to tame this land for human settlement and
to shape and evolve effective means of self-
government. Iron Age settlement began
here some eighteen centuries ago. But it
was in the tenth century, or soon after, that
the origins of Shona society began to pro¬
duce the cultures and traditions which have
governed the Shona down to modern times.
Shortly after AD 1000, the earliest stone-
built centres of self-government were raised
on sites which, later on, became famous for
the grandeur of their conception and the
strength with which they were built. By
1300 or somewhat earlier, using the plenti¬
ful granite of the southeastern plateau,
powerful rulers had their courts and centres
of government at various places. The best
known of these, and certainly the most im¬
pressive, was at Great Zimbabwe, as later
generations have understandably named it.
This cluster of Zimbabwe kingdoms, so
named after a Shona term for a stone build¬
ing, stretched across the central plateau
down towards the coastland of Mozam¬
bique, and, like other large structures of
African authority in medieval times, de¬
rived from the dynamics of an internal de¬
velopment as well as from the stimulus of
long-distance trade. Very competent metal¬
workers and miners, these people were able
to locate and extract gold from many sur¬
face or near-surface seams across their
plateau and its eastern hills. At least from
the tenth century AD, they were trading
this gold to the city-States of the East Afri¬
can coast, notably those of the Swahili who,
in turn, exchanged the gold for Indian cot¬
tons and other useful imports from the
countries of the East. These old kingdoms
were thus an integral and even an essential
part of the whole network of Eastern trade
before the onset of European discovery in
1498.
Although a few Europeans, chiefly Por¬
tuguese, were able to penetrate these inland
kingdoms during the sixteenth century, and
later to make small settlements along the

middle and lower Zambezi river, no lasting
impact from the outside world struck the
body of the plateau until the 1830s.
Announcing a time of upheaval, warrior
groups of the Ndebele (Matabele) people
then came north over the Limpopo river
from their troubled homeland in the Zulu
empire. Searching for a new homeland of
their own, the Ndebele invaded the wester¬
ly Shona kingdoms and settled in the Mato-
po hills, with their capital at Bulawayo. To
begin with they proved dangerous neigh¬
bours, but settlement gradually rubbed off
the edges of their aggressiveness.
But new arrivals in the 1880s again
announced a time of trouble; and now the
time would be long and the trouble would
be great. As part of Britain's imperial
"drive to the north", white soldiers and
settlers from South Africa were able to take
possession of all the country of the Shona
and the Ndebele. They were stubbornly
resisted, but the automatic firearms of the
invaders ensured an eventual success. The
country was enclosed in the British empire
under the name of Southern Rhodesia,
although ruled until the 1920s by the British
South Africa Company which Cecil Rhodes
had formed for the purpose.
Lasting until 1980, this colonial period
produced a white dictatorship, severely
racist, on lines that were essentially the
same as those already formed in South Afri¬
ca. Only a daring and often painful counter-
violence could overthrow that dictatorship:
begun in the 1960s, this was the war of
liberation which was crowned by independ¬
ence six years ago. Since then this united
people has begun to make its own history
once more, fortified by its long traditions of
independent development before the com¬
ing of the Europeans, and determined to
regenerate and modernize the old ancestral
cultures which rose in the remote past.

Land-locked islands
ISLAND States and land-locked States, in
spite of their different geographical situations,
possess one common feature their relative
isolation.
The world's land-locked countries are: in
Europe, the principality of Andorra, Austria, the
Grand Duchy of Luxembourg, Hungary, Liech¬
tenstein, Switzerland and Czechoslovakia; in
Africa, Burkina Faso, Burundi, Botswana,
Lesotho, Mali, Malawi, Niger, Uganda, the Cen¬
tral African Republic, Rwanda, Swaziland, Chad,
Zambia and Zimbabwe; in Asia, Afghanistan,
Bhutan, Nepal, the Lao People's Democratic
Republic and the Mongolian People's Republic;
in South America, Bolivia and Paraguay.
Some of these States owe their existence to
the preservation of a strong ethnic and cultural
originality and of forms of social and economic
organization which have enabled them to survive
in spite of outside pressures. A number of them
are set within a barrier of mountains: the Hima¬
layas in the case of Nepal and Bhutan, the
Drakensbergs in the case of Lesotho, and the
Alps in the case of Switzerland. Others were
deprived of access to the sea as a result of the
dislocation of the Austro-Hungarian, Spanish,
French, Belgian and British empires.
These countries form an extremely disparate
group. They differ in terms of history, their en¬
dowment of natural resources and their political
systems. Nevertheless they do share, especially
if they are developing countries, a number of
broad general features.
Land-locked States are, for example, general¬
ly speaking less wealthy, less populous and
smaller than coastal States. In addition, the prop
ortion of the working population engaged in agri¬
culture is much higher than that engaged in
industry and the services sector correspondingly
lower. Finally, perhaps because of the absence
of ports as centres of natural growth, the percen¬
tage of the population living in urban areas is far
lower than in coastal States.
The land-locked problem affects all aspects of
development, but its consequences are most
severe in the field of external trade. Most land¬
locked countries are remote from world markets;
imports and exports must be shipped through
another State, in some cases several States.
This gives rise to additional costs which reduce
the competitivity of their products on overseas
markets and have a negative effect on their
balance of payments as a result of higher import
bills and currency outflows.
Lack of access to the sea also causes legal,
administrative and political problems. Land-lock¬
ed countries have to negotiate to meet their
transit requirements, and the facilities provided
may not in every case be satisfactory because
the transit countries have their own development
priorities and problems, which are often acute.
They may, for example, impose cumbersome
documentary procedures and formalities in order
to safeguard their interests which could be
jeopardized by the diversion of transit cargoes to
their domestic markets. Transit countries may
also wish to limit the use of certain routes within
the context of an overall economic policy. Land¬
locked countries, furthermore, have to incur
additional storage expenses in order to maintain
inventories in ports or to anticipate possible inter¬
ruptions in transit-transport services. The fact
that they are at the mercy of technical incidents,
natural disasters, industrial disputes, political
troubles and even international conflicts, pro¬
vides some indication of their dependence and
the precariousness of their situation.
Fifteen of the land-locked developing coun¬
tries belong to the category of least developed
countries. Their remoteness from world markets
has compounded their problem of extreme
underdevelopment and made their economies
particularly vulnerable. They have been hard hit
by the overall deterioration of the world economy
in recent years, and by the natural disasters
which have stricken the greater part of Africa,
where most of them are located.
The international community has come to rec¬
ognize that land-locked developing countries
cannot overcome on their own the formidable
obstacles that face them. Several regional and
international organizations, including the United
Nations Conference on Trade and Development
(UNCTAD), have over the last decade been
actively seeking solutions to the special prob¬
lems faced by these countries.

Bhutan
The land
of the dragon
by Rigzin Dorji
DRUKYUL, "The Land of the Dra¬
gon", known to the outside world as
Bhutan, is a land-locked Himalayan
kingdom. The southern frontier with India
follows the line of the tropical foothills
overlooking the Indian plains, and is almost
at sea level. The northern frontier with the
Tibet region of China is formed by great
snowclad ranges in which numerous peaks
soar to above 6,000 metres.
Agricultural Bhutanese are valley-
dwellers and live beside the rapidly flowing
rivers that rise in the snowy heights. These
perennial rivers, once looked upon only as a
source of irrigation, are now being harnes¬
sed for hydro-electric power. They are fed
by hundreds of tributaries that keep the
fields green and productive.
Although closely linked to Tibet and In¬
dia culturally, Bhutan maintained its inde¬
pendence and individuality over the centu¬
ries by deliberately following a systematic
policy of isolationism which earned for the
country the reputation of being the world's
last "Forbidden Kingdom". This policy was
pursued until 1952, when the third heredi¬
tary monarch, the late King Jigme Dorji
Wangchuck, ascended the throne. He re¬
alized that the old policy of isolation was
causing Bhutan to remain socially, econo¬
mically and politically backward. Gradua¬
lly, so as not to upset old traditions, but
firmly in accordance with modern needs, he
introduced administrative reforms, and in
1961 launched the first of a series of Five
Year Plans.
In a country where there had been no
wheel other than the continuously-turning
prayer wheel, no electricity, no post offices,
no modern schools or hospitals, and little
other sign of the twentieth century, traditio¬
nal barriers suddenly began to collapse.
Roads began to be built, and up them came
the carefully sifted benefits of the modern
outside world. Today, under the leadership
of the young king Jigme Singye Wang-
chuck, crowned in 1974, the country is all
set to achieve a happy co-existence of tra¬
dition and progress in the best interests of
its particular genius.
There are three distinct ethnic elements
in the population. The first comprises the
descendants of the original inhabitants,
who live in the eastern part of the country.
The second ethnic element consists of the
descendants of immigrants from Tibet, who
occupy the western region. The third com¬
prises the Nepalese settlers who began to
immigrate to Bhutan at the turn of the
twentieth century. They are found exclu¬
sively in the hot and humid southern dis¬
tricts of the country adjoining India.
The State religion is Buddhism, which
was introduced into Bhutan towards the
second half of the eighth century AD. The
first monastic body was established in the
seventeenth century with thirty monks
only. There are now about 6,000 State-sup¬
ported monks. No account of the religious
life of the country would be complete with¬
out mentioning the mask dances. At various
festivals, both monks and laity expert in the
art of dramatic dance and music, don rich
robes of China silk and brocade and fantas¬
tic masks representing deities, legendary
personages and demons. As the day of the
festival draws near, large crowds of people
flock in from the countryside to see the
sacred mask dance which represents the
Buddha in various manifestations. It is be¬
lieved that the very act of watching the
dance helps people to acquire spiritual
merit and to achieve liberation from world¬
ly suffering.
Bhutan is a friendly and hospitable coun¬
try. Meetings are generally acknowledged
with an exchange of silk or cotton scarves.
Butter, tea and saffron-coloured rice are
served as a gesture of hospitality. When
Bhutanese pass each other at a distance on
their travels they call and yodel to each
other. Dzongkha is the country's national
language. In official correspondence both
English and Dzongkha are used.
The Bhutanese build imposingly large
houses of hand-tamped earth, generally two
or three storeys high, with shingled roofs.
The ground floor is used for stabling cows,
pigs and poultry; the first floor for living
apartments, the best room always being a

^. private shrine; and the loft for storing grain
and odds and ends. The houses are cons¬
tructed in a distinctive architectural style;
the windows, doors and roof beams are
painted in glowing earth colours. All
government buildings, both official and re¬
sidential, are required to adhere to traditio¬
nal Bhutanese style on the exterior, though
every modern convenience may be em¬
ployed within.
The Bhutanese are experts in arts and
crafts. Artists excel in mural and scroll
painting, and craftsmen create master¬
pieces in silver, gold, copper and brass.
Bronze-casting, used largely in image-ma¬
king, is an ancient art form, as is wood-
carving, to be seen at its best in the gilded
chapels of monasteries and castles. Bhuta¬
nese craftsmen also make temple-bells,
swords and daggers.
Handloom weaving of woollen, silk and
cotton textiles is practised in almost every
home. Women wear small fortunes in hand-
woven cloths and take pride in outfitting
their men. Basket- and bamboo-weaving is
commonplace and is used for making food
baskets, water containers, hats, quivers and
other attractive items of everyday use.
Archery is the national sport of Bhutan
and a favourite pastime ofyoung and old.
Competitions between villages are impor¬
tant events during which the local divini¬
ties confront one another through the
medium of opposing teams. Each team is
advised by an astrologer, and backed by
supporters and dancers who try hard to
encourage their own side and dishearten
their opponents.
Archery is the national sport in a country
whose people are extremely sports-minded.
Other major sports-are soccer, basketball,
volleyball, badminton, tennis and table
tennis.
The great bulk of Bhutan's trade is with
India and with other neighbouring coun¬
tries. The main exports are timber, min¬
erals and agricultural products. Other ex¬
port commodities include liquor and can¬
ned fruit products. Cardamom and Bhuta¬
nese handicrafts are also exported to the
Middle East and Western Europe.
The population is increasing rapidly
every year as a result of effective health
measures taken by the government. Most of
the diseases which used to take a heavy toll
of human lives have been controlled. As a
result of this demographic growth more and
more fallow land is being brought under
cultivation and forests are being cleared for
new settlements. There is no unemploy¬
ment, and in fact, there is an acute shortage
of both skilled and unskilled labour. Due to
the heavy demand for such labour, wages
are increasing every year. To meet the la¬
bour shortage, manpower is being imported
from neighbouring countries.

In harmony with nature by Corneille Jest
THE traveller coming from the south who
ascends the Wong Chu valley in Bhutan is
captivated by a grandiose, rocky land¬
scape with many tumbling waterfalls. He cannot
fail to see, carved in huge letters on a bare
rockface, this maxim of the late King Jigme Dorji
Wangchuck: "Work with Nature". This exhorta¬
tion by the father of the present sovereign, King
Jigme Slngye Wangchuck, also holds good for
the engineers and planners of today, and reflects
the major concern of a man who, like his sub¬
jects, himself lived in harmony with nature, which
is here beautiful, generous and treated with re¬
spect.
The landscape, shaped by man, reveals a
sequence of surfaces which are often depicted in
Bhutanese religious painting and hold deep sig¬
nificance. At the lowest level flows the river, with
its corbelled bridges, and its water mills; on its
cultivated banks are fields dotted with farm¬
houses and their outbuildings; higher up stands
the temple or monastery, to which lead tracks
punctuated by chörten (religious constructions at
which offerings are made); higher still, the dzong
or fortress dominates these scattered set¬
tlements; finally, the mountain ridge with its
dense and sombre covering of larch and pine
stands out against the sky.
The dwelling house is unquestionably the
most remarkable element in this whole picture: a
massive construction in rammed earth on two or
three levels, it is so proportioned and decorated
that it fits harmoniously into the landscape; the
façade is adorned with wooden panels, often
carved and painted; the roof widely overhangs
the walls on each side, as if simply set down on
top of the building.
The feeling of harmony inspired by the sight of
these structures deepens as one comes to
understand their symbolism, in which a part is
played by the choice of site (which must not
offend the divinity which owns the ground) and by
the final consecration ceremony, which takes
place when the roof is put in place. The house in
its entirety is conceived as a microcosm of a
world which also has three storeys.
In terms of size, the dzong is the most impor¬
tant building in Bhutan. It combines defensive,
administrative and religious functions, and Is
occupied by monks and regional administration
officials. Its plan may vary depending on the
nature of the site, but the same features are
always found: high surrounding walls gradually
tapering Inwards, pierced by several loopholes;
large paved courtyards; a central tower; temples
and meeting halls for the monks.
Increasingly aware of the value of its
architectural heritage, the royal government of
Bhutan has laid down standards for new build-'
ings which attach particular importance to the
façades, which must be in the traditional style.
Restoration work is carried out along the same
lines, using local materials. New buildings such
as the hospital devoted to traditional medicine,
and the national library, are built in the purest
Bhutanesf style.
Closed to foreigners until a short time ago,
Bhutan is classed among the least developed
countries according to the criteria of a world in
which scientific and industrial development is
considered the most effective, if not the only,
motive force; but this is a world to which Bhutan
does not belong.
Bhutan's own values provide grounds for re¬
flection and much can be learned from them. The
wealth of Its traditions cannot be measured, still
less "exploited"; it is to be hoped that material
progress, desirable though it be, will leave these
traditions intact.
CORNEILLE JEST, of France, is Director of a
research programme on the Himalayas at the
Centre National de la Recherche Scientifique,
Paris. He has recently been involved in an United
Nations Development Programme (UNDP) mis¬
sion responsible for preparing a master plan for
the development of tourism in Bhutan.

1986: Year of Peace/ 10
m)
Among the events marking the Internation¬
al Year of Peace, a Congress of Intellectuals
for the Peaceful Future of the World was held
in Warsaw (Poland) in January 1 986. The 250
participants included scientists, writers and
artists from 54 countries representing all the
world regions. The discussions, devoted to
the main dangers threatening international
peace and security, ended with the proclama¬
tion of a Message, salient passages of which
are published below.
WE, intellectuals, have assembled in
the heroic city of Warsaw, city of
peace, to defend the peaceful future
of the world. Anxiety about the destiny of the
world has brought us here. Anxiety about our
homes and cities, anxiety about our science
and culture. The threat of total annihilation
hangs over us. Differences of outlook notwith¬
standing, we express in our diverse lan¬
guages our common conviction that our prime
task is to defend the universal values of cul¬
ture. At this decisive moment in history we
declare ourselves in favour of life. We declare
ourselves in favour of peace and co-oper¬
ation, against war and the arms race which
leads to war.
Weapons will not preserve our future. We
are convinced that the production and accu¬
mulation of weapons of mass extermination
cannot be justified by the needs of national or
International security. Weapons are an unim¬
aginable waste of the world's material and
intellectual resources. They lead to greater
inequalities in the level and quality of life. We
declare our support for disarmament in all its
aspects. The threat of the extension of
weapons into space fills us with anxiety and
terror.
A durable peace depends on the renuncia¬
tion of force in international relations and on
the peaceful settlement of all conflicts, the
establishment of confidence and détente, and
disarmament. With this in view we must stop
the race leading to the destruction of our
civilization, to the annihilation of the spiritual
and material heritage of humanity.
In the nuclear era, an armed conflict would
solve no problem. There would be neither
victors nor vanquished. Peace is our fun¬
damental common value. The right to life, to
live in peace, is the right which underlies all
human rights, the first condition for the
realization of political, social, economic and
cultural rights.
Peace is also threatened by the aggrava¬
tion of injustices in economic relationships. In
spite of enormous advances made within our
civilization, the numbers of the hungry, the
homeless, the unemployed, and the sick are
growing.
The survival of humanity thus depends on
finding urgent solutions to crises with
worldwide ramifications: the food and energy
crises, crises of ecology and massive debt.
Common global problems will only be solved
through global co-operation.
Wars are born in the hearts and minds of
men. The construction of peace begins with
education in the spirit of peace, with the pre¬
paration of peoples to live in peace.
Science and technology create a better
world as long as they contribute to the creative
development of man and not to his destruc¬
tion. We declare ourselves in favour of free¬
dom of scientific research and of the general
availability of the achievements of world
science.
We express the hope that literature, the arts
and education will play a greater role in the
formation of human attitudes.
We consider that nothing divides us in our
aspiration to provide present and future gen¬
erations with the opportunity to live in peaceful
conditions, to live a life worthy of man.
We hope that the International Year of
Peace will bring, in conformity with the spirit of
Geneva, a decisive improvement in the rela¬
tions between East and West and an end to
wars on all the continents.
We support the efforts of the United Nations
in favour of international security and peaceful
co-operation between States. These efforts
spring from the ideals of the Charter of the
United Nations and conform to the expecta¬
tions of peoples.
Gathered at the Congress of Intellectuals in
Warsaw, we appeal:
for renunciation of force in international
relations, for an end to the arms race, for
renunciation of space weapons programmes,
for the liquidation of atomic weapons during
this century;
for the International Year of Peace to mark
the start of an era of Peace on our Earth.
