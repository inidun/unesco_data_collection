Mulla
the Onion Eater
WÊBmmt
One of Pakistan's popular folk heroes is a man said to have lived some four centuries ago. He is Mulla
the Onion Eater, a court jester who earned this name by his fondness for a vegetable more often
associated with tears than laughter. The fact that Mulla Do Piaza, ("do piaza" : two onions) may not
even have existed matters little to Pakistanis, who still chuckle over stories of his japes and quips.
To them he is a very real person, one who symbolizes the very essence of folk humour, and whose witty
stories are frequently spiced with shrewd reflections and sharp comments. Mulla is traditionally
associated with the 16th century Mogul court where his sallies and shafts of wit delighted the great
emperor Akbar himself. Mulla's humour was not dissimilar to that of Nasredin, the famous
Turkish-Iranian storyteller-jokester (see "Unesco Courier", March 1969). Here, the jovial jester is
depicted in an 18th century portrait, an exceptional work of Mogul art, which seldom attempted
caricature. A delicately executed miniature, (8 in. by 5), it is now in the Lahore Museum.

In summer, 1968, the first Greek
frescoes known to have survived
to the present day were uncovered
in a burial ground near the famed
temples of Paestum in the Italian
province of Lucania. They were
painted in about 480 B.C. In 1969,
further tombs were discovered, also
ornamented with many frescoes.
These were the work of Lucanian
artists, but were in the same Greek
style or showed evidence of a strong
Greek influence (see article page 4).
The fresco reproduced in the upper
half of our cover depicts a warrior
being welcomed home by a woman
who is, perhaps, his wife since she
wears the draped headdress reserved
for married women. The standard
indicates that this is a Lucanian work
as the ancient Greeks never carried
standards. For details of the lower
fresco see caption on page 8.

in the mid-5th century B.C. Modelled on the Parthenon at Athens, ¡i is one of the few
surviving buildings of Poseidonia (the Greek name for Paestum). The city was founded at the end
of the 7th century B.C. by Greek colonists, and was captured by the Lucanians towards the end of the
5th century B.C. A vast buriaf ground has now been discovered near the Temple of Neptune,
and thousands of graves have been unearthed (bottom photo). Some 50 of these tombs

few fragments of terra

pieces of plaster rubble, occasional
references to Polygnotus, Zeuxis and
Euphranor are all that has come down
to us of the great flowering of Hellenic
painting, in the 5th and 4th centuries
B. C, described by Pliny the Elder.
The great painted frescoes of the
classical era were doomed to destruc¬

of war and Roman plundering, coupled
with the fragility of the surfaces used
by painters of classical times, combined
to deprive us of the paintings that
once adorned the walls of Propylaea

One of the most surprising paintings found at Paestum Is the diver (below) decorating -
the roof slab of the oldest of the painted tombs. The scene below Is a detail of the full painting
which shows the diver silhouetted against a vast sweep of sky in a coastal setting.
The walls of the same tomb are covered with a series of beautiful paintings of a Greek funeral banquet,
showing ten young men chatting, drinking and listening to music (above). Painted about 480 B.C.,
this type of banquet painting was known to the world only through the painted vases of Athens.

PAESTUM (Continued)
Without direct knowledge of the
paintings themselves, we can only have
a small idea of what they were really
like from ancient Greek vase paintings
or even more regretfully, from certain
weak copies by ancient Roman artists.
This at least was the position until
one day in the summer of 1968 the
sun of Paestum filtered into tomb No. 4
of a burial ground situated one mile
to the south of the time-worn walls of
this ancient Greek city in southern
Italy. Uncovered by a systematic
examination of the area carried out
that summer, the tomb revealed wall
paintings of extraordinary freshness,
depicting scenes of funeral banquets
and typically Greek rituals, that had
lain there untouched for two and a half
thousand years.
It was immediately evident that the
paintings were totally different from
the few Lucanian painted tombs
previously brought to light in the
vicinity. They closely resembled the
themes depicted on Greek pottery of
the classical period. On the two
longer walls of the tomb the eye saw
a double funeral banquet scene in red,
black, yellow and blue. Ten bearded
funeral guests, crowned with laurels,
were reclining on a couch evoked by
a single blue brush stroke. The
painting shows the men listening to
music and playing a game called
Kottabos (which consisted of passing
wine from one wine cup to another in
a manner that called for great
dexterity). The scene has erotic
overtones. On the shorter walls a
flutist leads the funeral cortege and a
cup bearer offers wine.
The harmony of design and the
delicate use of colour with little modu¬
lation of tone confirm the advanced
development of painting techniques of
the Greek artists of Paestum. The
frescoes are especially significant in
their portrayal of ancient Greek rites
for the living and the dead.
A most unusual scene is portrayed
on the inner face of the slab that forms
the covering of the tomb. Here,
poised between sky and sea, a young
RESURRECTED CHARIOTS
IN THE GREEK STYLE
The Lucanlans of the 4th century B.C.
decorated the walls of the tombs in the
Paestum burial ground with paintings
in the Greek style. Themes of battle and
victory are numerous: the proud warrior
on his charger (left); a four-in-hand chariot
race (below right); a winged victory In a
chariot (above right). In this work,
branches 'loaded with pomegranates
(left of painting) symbolize re-birth
and the promise of a future life.
Lucanian artists drew inspiration from the
Greek vases of Taranto in southern Italy,
but unlike their Greek counterparts,
they sought for more striking effects
by a greater use of contrasting colours.
Below, these stone coffins discovered
at Paestum are about 1.80 metres
long and 1 metre wide (about 6X3 ft.).
The 150 painted tomb walls of Paestum
are regarded as one of the most remarkable
archaeological discoveries of recent years.

ephebe is shown executing a high dive
from a narrow platform between two
trees. Hence the name immediately
given to the find: tomba del tuffatore
("The Tomb of the Diver").
Certain precise stylistic charac¬
teristics, particularly the representa¬
tion of the athlete's eye and his
musculature, as well as the shape of
a vase found in the tomb, have enabled
Professor Mario Napoli, Superintendent
of Antiquities for the Salerno-Paestum
district, in charge of the excavations,
to date it to about 480 B. C.
At that time Paestum was still called
Poseidonia. Situated about 80 kilo¬
metres (50 miles) south of present day
Naples on the Gulf of Salerno, it was
one of the most important cities of
Magna Graecia. Its institutions, lan¬
guage, religion, art were all Greek.
The Lucanian mountain folk had not
yet come down from the surrounding
heights to drive out the Greek
colonists. The paintings from the
"Tomb of the Diver" are, therefore,
stylistically, culturally and even politi-

cally speaking Greek. There can be
no doubt that they were painted by a
Greek hand.
This was an unprecedented find. In
the words of Superintendent Mario
Napoli, it represents "the first and only
Greek painting of the archaic or
classical period found anywhere thus
far." The same enthusiasm is shared
by the world's leading experts on
Greek art and archaeology.
In his contribution to the volume "La
Grèce Classique" which has just
appeared in the famous collection
entitled "Univers des Formes", the
French specialist of Greek art, François
Villard, writes: "Until the most recent
discovery at Paestum ... of a painted
tomb of astounding expressive power,
dated around 480 B. C, the existence
of no original Greek painting, even by
a minor artist . . . had come to our
knowledge."
There is another surprising aspect
to this discovery: no tradition of tomb
painting was formerly known to exist
in ancient Greece. Painted tombs are
found only from the 4th century B. C.
onwards, and these only on the fringes
of Magna Graecia, at Pont-Euxin, near
Taranto and in Apulia where a much
more geometric style was dominant.
Etruscan funeral paintings had a more
esoteric, ritual inspiration, quite dif¬
ferent from the lively themes of the
"Tomb of the Diver". However, tomb
decoration seems to have been an
established tradition in Lucania.
Faced with this puzzle, Super¬
intendent Napoli and his colleagues
have yet to reach agreement on
two opposing interpretations. The
first of these is that, while Paestum
was still completely under Greek rule,
a non-Greek inhabitant of the city, no
doubt a notable, was accorded the
honour of being buried in accordance
with his native traditions. The second
interpretation explains the existence of
the tomb painting as an illustration
of the Pythagorean notion of "ritual
immersion". According to this view,
the dead man would then have been
a Greek member of a Pythagorean
school in Paestum.
But there were further surprises in
store for the Italian archaeologists.
On July 12, 1969, the Superintendent
learned that a farmer named Luigi
Franco, while ploughing his artichoke
field with an especially long blade, had
struck the stone cover of another tomb,
this time 300 metres (330 yards) north
of the city walls.
This tomb was unpainted and empty.
But, in the course of the three months'
excavations that followed, 83 under¬
ground tombs were found within the
same area. Of these, 50 were de¬
corated with frescoes, more than thirty
of which were well preserved. All but
four or five of these tombs contained
vases which were found to date from
the 4th century B. Cabout 340 B. C.
Since each tomb had four painted
walls (the roof slab in each case being
unpainted) a total of 120 to 140 wall
paintings of great antiquity were now
available to the world in addition to the
"Tomb of the Diver". Taken together
they show evidence of a particular
style which, if not strictly Greek, is at

least strongly marked by Hellenic
influences, spiced with a lovely touch
of local colour.
The walls of these new tombs, like
those of the "Tomb of the Diver", have
been transferred to the nearby
museum, where they are being allowed
to dry out slowly. On some of them
can still be seen the marks made in the
wet plaster by the ropes with which
they were lowered into place. And
when we are studying antique relics,
traces of handling and techniques
used, such as these, take us magically
back in time until we can almost see
the events unfolding before our eyes.
Apart from a few bones, little else
was found in these 4th century B. C.
tombs, except for some rare jewellery
and a few vases. The walls of the
tombs were pre-cut to the required
dimensions from one or two metres in
length and 90 cms in height (3 to
6 à ft. x 3 ft.). They were given a coat
of fresh plaster and decorated probably
at the last moment.
On all of them the principal figure
is surrounded by a frame motif perhaps
the work of the artist's assistant and
applied with almost slap-dash haste.
These motifs abound with streamers,
floral designs, eggs and pomegranates,
the latter a symbol of resurrection.
Sometimes this rather mechanical
ornamentation constitutes the entire
decoration one tomb has as its only
decoration an intertwined central
design of the famous roses of
Paestum.
It was in one of these latter tombs
that the only signed vase was found.
It bears the name of Python, who,
along with Asteas, was the most
famous painter of the jars with twisted
twin handles for which Paestum was
famous. It seems unlikely that one
or both of these artists worked on the
paintings themselves, but as yet there
is no proof either way.
The actual figures have often been
sketched several times as we can see
if we examine the paintings under an
oblique light. They depict a whole
range of horsemen, combats between
boxers or between Greek foot-soldiers
known as hoplites, stag-hunting scenes,
bulls, griffons and mythical birds.
Others show women combing their
hair under a canopy; even a set of
armour and two leg plates have been
considered of sufficient interest to
constitute the only theme.
Scenes from Greek mythology,
however, are the dominating theme:
Charon ferrying the dead shades
across the Styx for a fee; Hermes
harnessed to a child's cart, etc.
Archaeologists have thus far found
three successive stages in this magni¬
ficent collection of paintings. On the
one hand, the typical ancient Greek
style, on the other Greek archetypes
interpreted more or less freely in the
Greek archaic style, and thirdly, a style
obviously inspired by strong local
influences.
Many archaeologists have been
happy to devote years of their lives
to reconstructing the walls of an
ancient city, yard by yard, or in the
painstaking study of potsherds which
are important clues to the past. It is
not given to every archaeologist to
discover the undisturbed mummy of a
Pharaoh or the treasures of Troy or
Mycenae. The archaeologists of
Paestum have been most fortunate
indeed.
It will take years to complete the
scientific study of their sensational
find. They are certainly right when
they say that the 140 wall paintings of
Paestum, together with the five
paintings of the 5th century sarco¬
phagus, constitute "a great moment- in
the history of Greek painting."

Since the Pharaoh Menés conquered
the Nile Delta 5, 000 years ago, thus
re-uniting north and south, Egypt has
remained Egypt. And Cairo is the heart
of Egypt. In Arabic, the word for Egypt
is Misr, and for many centuries Misr has
remained the popular name used for the
Egyptian capital. Thus country and
capital rightly share a common name,
for in this great city one can see a
synthesis of all of Egypt's past.

stands so pre-eminent as Cairo.
As the capital of Egypt it is as old
as Islam itself, and down to the pre¬
sent day it has consistently remained,
not merely a bastion of Islam but a
treasure house enclosing innumerable
masterpieces of Islamic art that cover
more than a thousand years.
Its history began when Amr ibn
al-As conquered Egypt for Omar, the
second of the Mohammedan caliphs,
in the year 641 A. D. Amr captured the
Roman fortress of Egyptian Babylon
which stood at the settlement said to
have been founded by emigrants from
the ancient town of the same name.
Just to the north of this fortress, whose

remains still dignify Old Cairo, Amr
set up his camp and here he founded
the town named Al-Fustat (signifying
"the tent").
Later rulers were to add other
administrative centres to Fustat and
always to the north but this was
essentially the beginning of Cairo, the
capital standing on the east bank of
the Nile and replacing ancient Mem¬
phis to the west. In the 9th century,
for example, Ahmed ibn Tulun, whose
great mosque still stands, built Al-
Qatai as his capital, north-east of
Fustat.
The name Cairo, however, and the
beginning of its great splendour date
from the Fafimids, a Shiite dynasty
claiming descent from Fatima, the
daughter of the prophet Muhammad.
The first caliph of the Fatimid dynasty
in North Africa was Ubaydallah the
Mahdi whose reign began in Kairouan,
Tunisia, in 910.
Egypt was conquered half a century
later, in 969, by Jawhar, vizier and
commander in chief of the reigning
Fatimid caliph, al-Muizz. The capital
of the Fatimid empire was at once
established in the new centre that
Jawhar had founded and named Al-
Qahira (The Victorious), a name which
has passed into English as Cairo.
Jawhar had left Kairouan in Feb
ruary 969 with 100,000 men and am¬
ple supplies and equipment. By
July 9, Fustat had surrendered and the
Fatimid army was encamped on the
sandy plain to the north of it. That
same night a new palace-fortress city
was marked out over a square roughly
1,200 yards each way. The south
faced Fustat, the west ran beside the
ancient canal known as Al-Khalij, the
east fronted on the Muqattam Hills,
while to the north lay open country
and the highway to Asia.
The original wall and the seven
gates were of mudbrick. The three 1 1

section of the wall that survive today
were part of a grand rebuilding in

stone on a slightly different alignment
a century later by the great vizier
Badr al-Jamali.
The walled Al-Qahira was a royal
city, entry to which was forbidden
except to those on official business.
It was designed to enclose two pala¬
ces for the caliph and his family,
government offices, quarters for the
garrison, the treasury, arsenal, stables
and other buildings.
Once the walls were begun, Jawhar's
next task was the foundation of a
great assembly mosque. On Sunday,
April 3, 970, was founded Al-Azhar (the
Resplendent), the mosque that is still
the glory of Islam. It was finished on
June 24, 972, and in 988 it began to be
used by scholars and students. It
then became what it has ever since
remained, one of the chief universities
of Islam.
Then, as now, students from every
part of the Muslim world gathered
within its walls to receive instruction
from the lips of great scholars in the
Koran, in theology, the Traditions of
the Prophet, law, grammar, logic and
rhetoric. After the time of Saladin.
Al-Azhar became the most eminent
centre of orthodox teaching in Islam,
a university of unequalled distinction
and world-wide reputation.
Within only a few years of its foun¬
dation, Cairo had grown to such
splendour that in 985, the Arab
traveller Maqdisi, could write: "Bagh¬
dad was in former times an illustrious
city, but it is now crumbling to decay,
and its glory has departed. I found
neither pleasure nor aught worthy of
admiration there. Cairo today is
what Baghdad was in its prime, and I
know of no more illustrious city in
Islam."
For Cairo was no longer a provincial
city, the seat of a mere governor
appointed ry the Abbasid caliphate.
It was the capital of a vigorous empire
SULTAN PUBLICISTS
OF THE 13th CENTURY
Under its Mameluke rulers, Egypt in the
13th century rapidly developed its contacts and
trade with other countries. Benefiting from the
fruitful transit trade between the Mediterranean
ports and the East, Cairo became one of the
world's richest cities.
Chronicles of the time tell us that Sultan
Kalaun (1278-1290) instructed the governors at
his ports to treat foreign travellers and merchants
with the utmost consideration, and by cordiality
and friendship to encourage them to extend their
stay. Such visitors, he decreed, should be taxed
with justice and impartiality and required to pay
only the officially prescribed amount. "They,"
(the travellers and merchants) declared the order,
"are gifts to us from the sea to invigorate the
life of our ports. Whatever they say of us will
be remembered by others. Our good actions
towards them (falling like seed on fertile soil)
will bear fruit which will be borne far and wide
as their ships, with sails spread like the wings
of a bird, carry them to other lands."
Sultan Kalaun did much to promote Egyptian
trade, and for this purpose he issued passports
enabling merchants to travel safely through Egypt
and Syria as far as India.
Other Egyptian sultans actually launched
publicity campaigns, despatching messages to
traders in East and West to encourage them
to visit Egypt. The cordial terms and subtle
phrasing of these messages clearly shows the
importance accorded by Egypt to its contacts
with other countries. One text runs: "Let he who
has chosen to visit our kingdoms look on his
decision as that of a man to whom God wills
nothing but good. Let him come to a country
where no man need possess worldly goods, for
the visitor will find here a veritable Garden of
Eden, filled with distractions for he who is far
from his native land. Let the merchants of the
Yemen, of India, of China, of Sind and other
kingdoms who have taken note of our decree,
make ready to journey to our country. They will
see for themselves that our words have not done
justice to reality and that the good fortune
awaiting them greatly exceeds our promises."

which more than rivalled that of the
Abbasids. It had become a Med¬
iterranean power, the equal of all its
rivals to east and west.
The naval power and wide con¬
nexions of the Fatimids made Egypt a
new factor in the power politics of the
area. These and the wisdom of Fatimid
policies led to Cairo's rise as a centre
of trade that flourished on a scale pre¬
viously unknown.
Writers and travellers have devoted
many pages to describing its splen¬
dours, climaxed by its two great
palaces. Between them lay a square,
Bayn al-Qasrayn (Between the Two
Palaces), a name which still survives
as that of a street flanked by several
fine mosques of later date.
The square was used for parades
and great ceremonies. To the east
lay Al-Muizz's palace, to the west that
built by his son Al-Aziz to overlook
the Garden of Kafur (an earlier ruler)
that now lay between it and the Khalij
canal.
The Egyptian topographer Maqrizi
(d. 1441) devotes nearly two hundred
pages to a description of the palaces
with their four thousand chambers,
including the Golden Hall, a gorgeous
pavilion in which sat the Caliph on his
golden throne surrounded by richly
attired attendants, the Emerald Hall
with its pillars of marble and the Great
Diwan where he sat in state on Mon¬
days and Thursdays at a window
beneath a cupola.
Al-Qahira of the Fatimids was
indeed a new city. The Fatimids could
have echoed the words of the Emperor
Augustus, when he spoke of Rome,
and boasted that they found their city
mudbrick and left it stone. Construc¬
tion in stone was an innovation at that
time, its use having been abandoned
since the classical era.

Golden age of Muslim architecture

As mentioned previously, Badr al-
Jamali rebuilt part of the walls and
gateways (1087-1091). They are monu¬
ments of magnificent stonework. His
own tomb-mosque on the Muqattam is
of stone, as was the mosque of Al-
Akmar (1125). The minaret of Badr's
mosque was also an innovation for
Islamic architecture in Egypt.
The next major change in the plan of
Cairo came with Salah-ad-Din al-
Ayyubi (Saladin), who took over from
the Fatimids in 1169 and ruled till
1193. He planned a new wall to join
Al-Qahira and Fustat into one great
city, thus enclosing an area ten times
as great as the Fatimid capital.
Saladin also built what is still the
dominant architectural feature of Cairo,
the Citadel. It stands on the foothills
of the Muqattam, and it was to the
Citadel that the centre of government
was now transferred. The centre of
gravity had moved from the Fatimid
city. The old palaces fell into ruin
and new buildings arose on their sites.
Only a few fragments of their carved
woodwork have survived.
Saladin and his successors, who
ruled until 1250, brought further
changes to Islamic architecture in
Egypt. The college-mosque (madrasa)
made its appearance, and with it a
cruciform plan in both mosque and
madrasa. The pepper-pot minaret and
the use of stalactite ornament came
into use, as did the lavish use of
squinch arches and the external
ornamentation of the dome.
Under Mameluke rule, which was
uninterrupted up to the Ottoman
conquest in 1517, commercial pros¬
perity led to further expansion of Cairo,
south, west and north. Beyond the
northern gates of Al-Qahira there grew
up a new suburb. Much survives
from Mameluke times tomb-mosques,
college-mosques, schools, inns, public
fountains.
Indeed much of the unique beauty of
Cairo's architecture is due to the
Mamelukes. But of their luxurious
palaces we have nothing except some
huge walls from Bishtak's palace, a
fine gateway from the Yeshbek's
mansion next to Sultan Hasan's impos¬
ing mosque and the better preserved
mansion of the Emir (known as Beyt-
el-Cadi). Their sumptuous beauty is
something that we can but dimly ima¬
gine from the descriptions of travellers
and the rare and delicate objects that
adorn our museums.
We can still see traces of the
exquisite mushrabiyah latticework
that embellished the Mameluke pala¬
ces. Even today, some markets are
shaded by matting or wooden roofs
much as they were in those far off
times. But the luxurious palaces and
mansions, the public baths and gar-

Saladin did not live to see Its

dens, the pleasure .kiosks and bel¬
vederes, the streets and inns that were
the meeting-places of the world, live
on only in the pages of the historian
Maqrizi.
Under the Mamelukes, Cairo was
for two and a half centuries the richest,
the fairest and the most populous city
of Islam. Its mosques and other
buildings testify to the taste and public
spirit of its rulers. The variety and
subtlety of the architecture is
extraordinary.
The 13th, 14th and 15th centuries
all have their characteristic master¬
pieces. From Kalaun, whose period
saw the end of the Crusaders, to
Qait-Bay and Al-Ghuri, who saw the
Ottoman menace about to overwhelm
Egypt at the same time that the
Portuguese were cutting the vital trade-
routes to India and the Far East, one
lovely building succeeded another.
The façades, the minarets and the
interiors grew in delicacy and imagina¬
tive enterprise.
One particular masterpiece is out¬
standing because it is quite unlike any
other the college-mosque of Sultan
Hasan which was built 1356-1359. Its
stones were taken from the Pyramids,
and it is perhaps not too fanciful to
suppose that something of its uniquely
massive and monumental character is
due to that inspiration. Its walls rise
to a great height and are crowned by
a magnificent cornice as splendid in
conception as Michelangelo's on the
Palazzo Farnese in Rome.
Everywhere the impression is made
by size if not by detail. The soaring
portal rises the whole height of
the building. The interior court is
surrounded by four noble arches. The
whole was once adorned with the
finest of craftsmanship in bronze and
enamelled glass, some of which can
be seen in the Museum of Islamic Art,
while its bronze-plated door now
beautifies the Muayyad mosque beside
the Bab Zuwayla gate.
Arab travellers and writers vied with
each other in their accounts of this
gracious city. Ibn Battuta, the Marco
Polo of Islam, described it in the most
glowing terms in 1326. In 1383, Ibn
Khaldun the historian, who ended his
days in Cairo, called it "the metropolis
of the universe, garden of the world,
throne of royalty, a city adorned with
palaces and mansions, convents, mo¬
nasteries and colleges, and illuminated
by the stars of erudition in a paradise
so bounteously watered by the Nile
that the earth seems here to offer its
fruits to men as gifts and salutations."
During this whole period Cairo was
the heart of Islam and of Islamic
civilization. Baghdad was captured
and sacked by the Mongols in 1258 and
never recovered its former splendour.
Cairo welcomed its refugees. Only

CAIRO (Continued)
Mameluke Egypt in the whole Middle
East was able to resist the onslaught
of the Mongols. Three times they
were driven back and defeated.
Egypt's prosperity, indeed, was only
the greater because of them. It was
the greater, too, because much of its
trade passed on to the steadily grow¬
ing markets of Europe.
The craftsmen of Cairo reached new
levels of perfection during this period,
and much of their metal, wood and
glass work has survived in the mos¬
ques themselves and in Cairo's mu¬
seums. Moreover, the skyline of the
city is a symphony of domes and
minarets in which architects and
craftsmen joined in creating one of the
most beautiful cities man has made.
Joseph Gobineau, the 19th century
French traveller, wrote: "In Cairo the
memory of the Mamelukes dominates
everything, so much did they do, so
many solid and beautiful monuments
did they create. Only they could
carve in stone the world of arabesques
which adorns with such splendour the
buildings of all Asia. Though slaves
only yesterday, the Mamelukes, once
they laid their sabres down and
possessed the authority to rule,
seemed no longer capable of anything
trivial. Everything that they built is
without equal among Muslim archi¬
tecture in the rest of the world."
With the Ottoman conquest in 1517
a gradual decay set in. Trade with the
East steadily diminished. Neverthe¬
less, these centuries are not entirely
without importance in the adornment
of Cairo. Neither taste nor skill were
what they had once been. Yet, in the
years up to the beginning of the 19th
century, many buildings were added
to Cairo that are still a delight to
behold.
In 1798, with the appearance of
Napoleon, the power politics and new
techniques of Europe exploded upon
Egypt. Willy-nilly Egypt was dragged
into the modern world. The changes
have been as tremendous as they have
been rapid.
Walking along the Nile or through
the streets of the modern city with its
skyscrapers and broad avenues, the
visitor may not always be aware how
old a city Cairo really is until, looking
to the west, he sees the ancient
pyramids, or to the east the proud
citadel of Saladin.
But in the streets of the older city
the past is never absent. Cairo, like
so many other places in the Nile
Valley, is like a book whose pages are
of stone inscribed with clear records
of man's endless endeavour. Each of
them invites the passerby to wonder
and to seek to learn the nature of his
fellow men in other times and places.
In few cities will such an effort be
more rewarding than it is in Cairo.

AL-AZHAR THE RESPLENDENT
Less than one year after the birth of the city of Cairo in
969 A.D., the new Fatimid rulers of Egypt laid the foundations
of the great mosque of Al-Azhar (The Resplendent) the first
of many architectural masterpieces to be erected by this
dynasty.
At the outset, the mosque was intended to be a centre for
the teaching of the Fatimids' religious ideas. But within a vew
years, In 988, the Caliph Al-Aziz gave orders that tuition should
be provided for 35 students for whom accomodation was also
made available at his expense. The Fatimid caliphs spared
no effort in the spreading of knowledge and the encouragement
of learning. Successive rulers, ministers and wealthy citizens
contributed funds with the result that the mosque became an
Islamic university the oldest in the world whose splendour
and influence grew rapidly. As Egypt became the leading
country of the Muslim world, Cairo became a Mecca for
scholars from far and wide.
Since that time, Al-Azhar has been a centre of Islamic
culture to which theologians, scholars and teachers have come
to lecture In theology, Arabic linguistics, logic, literature, mathe¬
matics, medicine, astronomy, law and other fields of learning.
Al-Azhar's renown as a centre for scientific studies spread
throughout the world during the reign of the Mameluke dynasty
(13th- 16th century A.D.). Even when this period ended and
invasion and occupation dimmed the brillance of cultural life
in Cairo, Al-Azhar remained a refuge of religious doctrines
and teaching and a bastion of the Arabic language.
At the start of the 20th century, Sheikh Muhammad Abdou,
one of the founders of the modern intellectual movement in
Egypt, introduced changes in the programmes and teaching
at Al-Azhar which, while respecting the university's age-old
traditions, also met the new demands of science and modern
education.
More recent transformations have consolidated the vigour
and increased the influence of Al-Azhar. In addition vo its
institutes for traditional Islamic and Arabic studies, it now has
faculties in every discipline of the natural and social sciences,
in agriculture, medicine, commerce, engineering and languages,
as well as a teacher training institute.
Al-Azhar also has a women's college, founded in 1962, and
today attended by 2,000 students from many parts of the world.
The college is the nucleus of a future women's university, in
which the existing college departments of medicine, the basic
sciences, Islamic and Arabic studies, the social sciences,
languages and commerce, including accounting, business
administration and statistics, will become faculties.
In recent years, enrolment at Al-Azhar has grown rapidly . _
and today tops 20,000. To meet this rapid influx, a vast | 7
university complex has been built on the outskirts of Cairo, '
comprising new faculty buildings and a university city to house
students and staff. But the three oldest colleges those for
Islamic studies are to remain near the 1,000 year old mosque
which gave them birth.

THE FABULOUS TREASURES
OF CAIRO'S MUSEUMS
The accumulated riches of thousands of years of history are
stored within the walls of Cairo's remarkable museums. No less
than 150,000 Items are displayed in the Museum of Egyptian Anti¬
quities which contains the world's finest collection of pieces from
the time of the pharaohs. Hundreds of thousands of other Items
are stored in Its repositories. Items taken from the tomb of
Tutankhamen alone total 1,700 rare pieces, Including the famous
gold funeral mask, above. The rooms devoted to the Early
Empire (2900 to 2300 B.C.), the high water mark of Egyptian
civilization, contain countless statues including one of Mykerinos
who built the Gizeh pyramid. The Middle Empire (2100 to 1750
B.C.) saw a new flowering of sculpture of which this bearer of
votive offerings (right) Is a fine example. The religious revolu¬
tion during the reign of king Akhenaton (1370 to 1352 B.C.) had
a strong Influence on sculpture. The Museum possesses 71 limes¬
tone statues from this period as well as a quartzlte head of Queen
Nefertrtl which is one of the masterpieces of ancient art. The
Egyptian Museum is no doubt the world's richest repository for
the study of the evolution of human civilization in Egypt from
6000 B.C. to the Roman conquest in 332 B.C. The Coptic Museum
contains statues, architectural fragments, drawings and tapestries
dating from the 5th and 6th centuries A.D. as well as a number
of 16th and 17th century icons. The striking painting executed
on wood (opposite page) was discovered in the Fayum region
where, from the 1st to the 4th century A.D., Greek artists developed
a style which foreshadowed the rise of Byzantine art. Some
70,000 examples of Islamic art such is the impressive number
of works in the collection of Cairo's Museum of Islamic Art. It
contains ancient Arabic, Omayyad, Fatimid, Mameluke, Iranian
and Turkish works; pottery, including some pieces 8 centuries
old, glassware, gem-studded weapons, carpets and earthenware.
The most complete collection of works of art from the Ottoman
era Is assembled In the Kasr-al-Nil Museum, while works of great
European artists Goya, Delacroix, Rubens, Van Gogh, etc. and
of Egyptian painters such as Mahmoud Said and Mohammad
Negui, are displayed In the Moukhtar Museum.

A
vast complex of megalithic
monuments, stone sarcophagi and
nearly 400 statues, some over 4 metres
high, mark the birthplace in Colombia
of a prehistoric culture which remained
virtually unknown until the beginning
of this century.
The "San Agustín culture", as it is
called, takes its name from a nearby
village that nestles on the eastern
flanks of the central Andean Cordillera,
1,700 metres (5,600 ft.) above sea level,
in a countryside of rolling hills inter¬
spersed with higher peaks and forest
ranges. . It is here that the great Mag¬
dalena river rises, the region being
watered also by the Muíales, Quin-
chana, Bordones and other rivers.
In the immediate neighbourhood
of San Agustín and farther "afield,
scattered over hills and valleys, are
temples, mounds, tombs, statues and
other remains, the remarkable heritage
in stone of a civilization older than
that of the Peruvian Inca civilization
which lasted from 1200 A.D. until the
Spanish conquest in 1532.
Even today, after years of research,
many questions concerning the origins,
chronology and relationships of the
San Agustín culture with other civiliza¬
tions are largely a matter of conjecture.
Extending over several hundred square
kilometres, the San Agustín area is
today a national "Archaeological Park"
in which many ancient ruins are
probably still buried or overgrown with
forest vegetation.
Although the Spanish Conquistadores
explored and occupied the region in
the mid-1 6th century, no mention of
the remains is made in the chronicles
of historians of the time such as Fray
Pedro Simón, Pedro Cieza de León, or
Don Juan de Castellanos.

Like some strange creatures sheltering from the elements under
a canopy of stone and branches, the statues, left and above, are two of
a whole group that has recently been found in the thick Jungles and
mountains of the Andean Cordillera In southern Colombia. This "San Agustín
culture", as it is now called, took shape 2,500 years ago and
flourished for 15 centuries. The stylized form and gigantic size of the statues
bear a certain resemblance to those of the Aztecs and Zapotees In ancient Mexico.

SAN AGUSTÍN (Continued)
The manuscript
on the Island of
treasures of the area appeared in the
chronicles of the Spanish friar Juan de
Santa Gertrudis, who visited the region
in 1757. He recounts his meeting with
a Catholic priest from the city of
Popayán who was eagerly excavating
the tombs and mounds in search of
hidden treasure. It was probably due
to this man and other treasure hunters
that most of the monuments now known
were unearthed. Unfortunately, Fray
Juan de Santa Gertrudis' manuscript
lay neglected" in the friary of Palma de
Mallorca for 200 years and was not
published until 1956.
Some forty years after Friar Juan,
in 1797, the Colombian scholar Fran¬
cisco José de Caldas visited the site
and published a short description of it
in a treatise on the geography of this
region.
Colombian, French, English, Italian
and German travellers who visited San
Agustín during the 19th century
mention its mysterious and spectacular
stone monuments in their reports.
However, the full importance and
richness of its culture was not
revealed to the world until the German
archaeologist Konrad Theodor Preuss,
who worked in the area from 1913 to
1914, published an account of his
discoveries in his book "Prehistoric
Monumental Art".
In 1935, the Colombian Ministry of
Education acquired a large tract of
land and established the "Archaeolo¬
gical Park", thus bringing the principal
ruins under government protection.
In 1936-1937, the Colombian archae¬
ologist, José Pérez de Barradas,
carried out the first official excavations
for his country and, in 1943, produced
the most detailed study of the site
published thus far. Another Colom¬
bian expert, Luis Duque Gómez, has
since conducted further excavations
and research.
Some thirty major archaeological
sites have been discovered in the
general area of San Agustín. Some
have rather extraordinary names: Alto
de Lavapatas (footbath mountain),
Alto' de Lavaderas (washerwoman
mountain), Las Mesitas (the small
plateaux), Alto de Los ídolos (mountain
of the idols).
The San Agustín civilization probably
extended over a period of more than
1,500 years and is described by Pérez
de Barradas as a "northern Andean
megallthic culture".

forgotten
Majorca
On the evidence of excavations and
the results of radiocarbon dating tests,
Luis Duque Gómez has suggested a
sequence of three periods: the first,
lasting roughly from 555 B.C. to
425 A.D., is characterized by shaft
graves with side chambers, wooden
coffins, wooden sculpture, early gold-
work, pottery bowls and vessels with
painted and incised decoration, bark
cloth, maize and root agriculture.
According to Duque, the middle
period lasted from 425 to 1180 A.D.
and is characterized by burial urns and
mounds, monolithic sarcophagi, crema¬
tion and statuary. Metallurgical tech¬
niques such as hollow casting in the
cire perdue technique and wire-work
are' added.
The third and last period, lasting
from the 12th century to an unknown
later date, is distinguished by its
realistic stone sculpture, circular
houses and loom weaving.
Some authorities believe that the
San Agustín civilization in the northern
Andes is related to the Chavin
civilization in Peru and even to that
of Tiahuanaco further south in Bolivia.
It is possible, and some authorities
believe, even probable, that Central
America, including Mexico, played a
role in the development of the civiliza¬
tions of the Andes. In recent years
evidence has been accumulating that
the roots of the Chavin culture of Peru
are derived from a Mesoamerican
source located in the Olmec country
(the area now covered by the Mexican
states of Veracruz, Tabasco and
Oaxaca).
Ancient navigators from Central
America coasting along the northern
shores of South America apparently
introduced into Peru the jaguar cult
and many elements of the associated
art style, along with maize farming.
These contacts probably date from the
9th century B.C., and it seems likely
that the idea of the jaguar cult also
spread into what is now Colombia,
thus reaching San Agustín about
500 B.C. But this cultural influx was
not a one-way process from Central
America southwards, it was also a
northward movement from Peruvian
cultures into Colombia.
The basic characteristics of the San
Agustín culture can be classified into
three categories. According to the
archeologist Konrad Preuss they are:
(1) its massive stone monuments,

A.D. The diadem

innumerable statues, and stone coffins
weighing tons, sometimes found in
huge stone-built tombs; (2) the
recurring forms of stone carving such
as large mouths with long pointed
fangs and statues with a second figure
crouching on the head or back;
(3) stone streamers emerging from the
mouths of statues, the tip of each
streamer terminating in a tiny head.
San Agustin's architectural monu¬
ments are its temples and tombs built
of massive slabs of stone. Embedded
vertically ¡n the ground, the stone walls
of the temples strangely recall the
dolmens, or prehistoric standing
stones, of Europe and elsewhere.
The outstanding art form of San
Agustín culture is its monumental
sculpture, principally its statues which
display an extraordinary variety and
wealth of detail. They range in height
from 40 cm. to over 4 metres (15 in.
to 13 ft.) and their forms and styles
suggest that their development was
spread over a long period of time.
According to Pérez de Barradas,
religion and magic directly inspired the
sculpture of San Agustín, although the
treatment of certain images is
extremely realistic. Like the Zapote-
cas figures ¡n Mexico, "some of the
San Agustín statues, for all their
stylization and contorted forms, reflect
a rare knowledge of anatomy."
But as in the case of the Aztec art
of Mexico, the San Agustín artists
worked according to a set of strict
rules so that the disproportion of head
and body and the often grotesque
forms and attitudes of their statues are
no accident. The effect is impressive,
]]>

particularly in the case of monumental
statuary such as the famous triangular
head nearly two and a half metres
(8 ft.) high.
As a rule, the heads are dispro¬
portionately large, the body squat and
thick-set, the limbs short and rigid.
The most elaborately worked part is
the face, which often shows a very
large mouth with long pointed fangs.
Half man, half feline, the statues are
adorned with necklaces and bracelets;
some hold maces or sceptres, others
bear trophies or clubs.
Many have protruding tongues, a
detail also found on statues in many
Pacific island cultures, in China and
south-east Asia and on Indian sculp¬
tures in north-eastern Canada.
The meaning of the religious sym¬
bolism of the San Agustín figures is
still obscure since many important
details are missing in the general
picture of San Agustín culture. Awe¬
some representations of anthropo¬
morphic gods abound as well as lesser
deities in the shapes of snakes, lizards,
monkeys and eagles.
"The man of San Agustín," writes
Pérez de Barradas, "was content to
spend his life in a straw hut, but for
his gods he built temples of massive
stones which by titantic effort he cut
and carried from his quarry. For his
own use he made rudimentary imple¬
ments of stone, which he never
improved; but inspired by his adora¬
tion for the gods, he used these rough
tools to carve, with infinite patience
and devotion, the statues of his deities
which today astound us by their
immense size and consummate art."

^B^r NE of the intriguing Euro¬
pean archaeological discoveries of
recent times, which has raised more
questions than it has answered, is that
of an 8,000 year old settlement at
Lepenski Vir ("the whirlpool of Lepe-
na") on the Yugoslav bank of the Dan¬
ube which forms the frontier with
Romania about 175 miles east of Bel¬
grade.
It came to light in the course of
salvage archaeology in an area due
to be flooded by a new dam. In spring
representatives of the govern¬
ments of Romania and Yugoslavia
together laid the foundation stone of
the Djerdap dam which the two coun¬
tries were to build jointly in the scenic
splendours of the Iron Gates, a moun¬
tain passage of the Danube where,
until 1896, massive boulders had
impeded the course of navigation. The
banks of the Danube would, at this
point, be engulfed by the waters of
a vast reservoir lake.
Dragoslav Srejovic, a young lecturer
at the Belgrade University Faculty of
Philosophy, believed that this area
might be the site of an ancient culture
that could provide the link between
mesolithic times and the later neolithic
culture of Starcevo. Starcevo Is the
oldest neolithic culture of the Balkans
dating back to 5000 B.C.
Immediate action was called for; it
would be a race against the rising
flood waters like that undertaken by
archaeological teams during Unesco's
campaign to save the Nubian monu¬
ments from the Nile, though of course
on a much more limited scale.
A special committee, headed by
Professor Lazar Trifunovic of the Bel¬
grade National Museum, gave Dra¬
goslav Srejovic the task of attempting
to uncover the secrets hidden under
the banks of the Danube.
In July 1965, after making a num¬
ber of preliminary probes, Srejovic
pitched his tent on the banks of the
river by the turbulent rapids of Lep¬
enski Vir. He knew that, throughout
the ages, men had been dependent
upon the Danube. Century after cent¬
ury they had cast their nets there

LEPENSKI VIR
Europe's oldest settlement
on the banks of the Danube
achieving magnificent catches of fish
trapped by the turbulence of the
waters.
It was the turbulence of the river
at this point that had first caught
Srejovic's attention seven years earlier
in 1958. Would not other men, even
before the inhabitants of the Starcevo
era, have throught of establishing
themselves on this favoured site?
With a small team he began an
investigation in depth below the Star¬
cevo era layers which were spread
over the district. One day their picks
hit a solid reddish-coloured object and
the archaeologist proceeded to clear
the ground around it. The reddish
colour persisted, marking out a trape¬
zoidal shape. Could this be the
foundations laid by men who had lived
there long before their descendants
of the Starcevo era?
Eleven trapeziums were soon unco¬
vered and carbon 14 testing confirmed
Srejovic's speculations. The culture
of Lepenski Vir was found to go back
to nearly 60 centuries before the
Christian era earlier than any other
settlement unearthed thus far in
Europe.
Lepenski Vir is situated in eastern
Serbia on the Yugoslav-Romanian
border in a tiny area, itself in the
shape of a trapezium, 170 metres long
by 50 metres wide (560 ft by 165 ft).
Its total area, therefore, is no greater
than that of a small hamlet. But, as
we shall see, the importance of a
discovery cannot always be judged
from the size of the site on which
it is made.
Protected by thick forests and rocky
escarpments, the cluster of structures
was built on a small, clear stretch of
beach and, for a long time, the river
remained the sole means of access.
Considered in the context of its sur¬
roundings, Lepenski Vir .is but an
insignificant detail on the vast canvas
of the Iron Gates, the extraordinary
ravine that forms a little world on its
own.
Facing the settlement, on the Roma¬
nian bank of the river, theTreskavac
mountain rises sheer and barren to
a height of 679 metres (2,230 ft). The
entire mountain has a curious trape¬
zoid shape and its outline stands out
sharply against the sky.
It is curious to observe that both
the shape of the tiny valley and the
foundations of the dwellings unearthed
all have this same trapezoidal form.
This has led to the conjecture that the
natural trapezoid shapes directly inspir¬
ed the men of Lepenski Vir in their
architecture and that its geometric
shape became a symbol and pattern of
special significance.
Four layers, totalling about ten feet
in depth, have been unearthed thus
far. This super-imposition of layers
makes it possible to establish that
Lepenski Vir was in constant devel¬
opment for a period of over 1,000
years, from 5800 to 4700 B.C. The
topmost layer, which is also the most
recent (dating from 4850 to 4700 B.C.)

MAN
FISH
OR DOODLE?
The sculptors of Lepenski Vir respected the basic shape of their raw material stones
rounded and polished by the swirling waters of the Danube. The examples above and
below right have been variously Interpreted as representing fish, human heads
or as being simply geometric doodles like those executed on bone by the hunters
of post-glacial Europe a few millenia earlier.
The Lepenski Vir people have been referred to as a-ceramlc
or pre-ceramlc and the few sherds of pottery found on
the site (above) have been ascribed to the Starcevo era,
previously the oldest known neolithic culture of the Balkans.
However the oldest piece of pottery found at
Lepenski Vir has been put at 5600 B.C., thus ante-dating
the Starcevo culture. The incised decorations on a grey
sandstone plaque (below) may represent hunting scenes.

LEPENSKI VIR (Continued)
consists of a light soil of black ash
and has two levels of dwellings, A
and B, in which vestiges of the Star¬
cevo culture are mingled with those
of lower levels. In the humus of
level B are to be found tombs of
historic and prehistoric eras which
suggest that the more recent genera¬
tions continued to use them as their
traditional burial places.
By their colour, structure and their
remains, the deeper layers (dated
4950, 5600 to 5000, and 5800 B.C.
respectively) are clearly distinguish¬
able from the most recent layer. Lep¬
enski Vir, therefore, offers evidence
of two types of prehistoric cultures
the most recent overlapping with that
of Starcevo and the older one being
a new phenomenon, the unexpected
revelation of European pre-history.
Like the traditional village, Lepenski
Vir had its central square as a meeting
place and streets whose pattern chang¬
ed from era to era. The houses,
about a hundred of which have been
uncovered, were often built one on
top. of another in succeeding centuries,
since the tiny site of the settlement
severely restricted its habitable area.
The houses had a solid floor made
of a chalk-based mortar of a reddish
colour covered with a pink or white
facing. The walls and roof consisted
of skins stretched over supporting
poles and an overhead beam. The
dwellings were in the shape of a
trapezium with the roof sloping shar¬
ply towards the shortest side and
the entrance on the opposite and
largest side. At the entrance to each
house two threshold stones were
placed in such a way as to direct the
dwellers towards the side walls so
that they would not, in the dark,
stumble against the centrally sited
hearth built of chalk blocks or clay.
Around the hearth was placed a
sacrificial altar with sculptures and a
large rounded stone half buried in
the ground. This may have been a
symbol of the sun for it was often
embellished with a design reminiscent
of the sun's rays.
Several hearths were surrounded
by thin flagstones in the shape of
isosceles triangles, the meaning of
which is unknown. It has been sug¬
gested that they may symbolize the
link between man and his dead ances¬
tors. In several buildings were found
tools, weapons, including clubs mea¬
suring 25 to 50 cm. (10 to 18 in.) in
length, and ornaments (all these
objects were made of bone or stone),
as well as a few sherds of pottery
dating back to 5000 to 5600 B.C.
The pottery has been assumed to
be that of the Starcevo period, since
the excavators have referred to the
Lepenski Vir people as a-ceramic and
pre-ceramic. The oldest dating of
5600 B.C., however, which antedates
the Starcevo era, has posed a new
puzzle for the archaeologist.
Another surprise was furnished by
the curved support stones that held

The people of
Lepenski Vir buried their
dead inside their houses.
Skeletons (right) were
found lying beside the
hearth looking, in the
words of the excavators,
"as if they had fallen
asleep with their hands
resting under their heads."
Excavators found only
skeletons without skulls
or else human skulls
without skeletons.
The skulls show
that Lepenski Vir
man had big brow ridges.
Stag antlers were placed
in the graves with
the human remains.
The rectangular
hearths (right) found
inside each house
measure about 1 metre
by 50 cms (3 ft by
18 ins) and are surrounded
by curious "A"-shaped
settings. According to
certain archaeologists
these may have had a
symbolic meaning, but
others think they served a
utilitarian purpose as
sockets for struts
supporting cooking
utensils.

the poles forming the frames of the
walls and fulfilled a function similar
to the metal sleeve joints that modern
campers use in frame tents.
All but four of the houses faced
towards the west with the largest side
turned towards Mount Treskavac in
such a way that the prevailing east
wind did not blow through the entran¬
ces but was deflected along the sides
of the houses. With its carefully
planned and thought out construction,
its standardized workmanship, its use
of applied geometry and the ease of
movement allowed for in the interiors
of the houses, Lepenski Vir Is almost
a "modern community" of pre-history.
The Lepenski Vir people were wild
fruit gatherers, hunters and fishermen.
But it is possible that before their
culture came to an end, they cleared
some tracts for a rudimentary form of
agriculture and cattle-rearing.
It has not been possible to reconsti¬
tute the rites practised in the home
sanctuaries. Fish, stags and dogs
were sacrificed. These are the only
animals depicted in the sculptures and
remains of all three have been found
near the altars.
The Lepenski Vir people were buri¬
ed in their houses. They lay in graves
beside the fire, in Srejovic's words,
"as though they had fallen asleep
with their hands resting under their
heads."
In the oldest clusters of dwellings
excavators found no skeletons but
only parts of skulls. If we accept
that the layers in which these remains
were buried had never previously
been disturbed, it seems probable that
only the heads of the dead were
preserved. Subsequent generations
followed the same custom, but in later
periods the inhabitants sometimes
buried the whole skeleton and some¬
times preserved "the myth of the
head" by burying skeletons without
skulls, or skulls without skeletons.
The antlers of a stag were invariably
placed in the tomb beside the human
remains and sometimes the animal's
complete skull as well.
The sculptures uncovered at Lep¬
enski Vir are of great interest. Most
of the human and animal heads are
life size, a remarkable fact consider¬
ing that all previous prehistoric sculp¬
tures have been miniature in size.
The sculptor of Lepenski Vir took
for his raw material large stones that
had been rounded and polished by
the action of the river. He infused
life into them without altering their
fundamental structure. Dragoslav
Srejovic believes that the artist was
obliged to respect the original form of
the stone, which was an object of cult
worship.
Thanks to the help afforded by the
government of Yugoslavia, Lepenski
Vir will be saved from the flood
waters. Soon the settlement is to be
transferred to a nearby site out of
reach of the new water line of the
Danube.

THE MOURNFUL FACES
OF LEPENSKI VIR
Eight thousand years ago,
the men of Lepenski Vir
produced these carved images,
using as their raw material
the rounded, yellow sandstones
they took from the river bed.
Some thirty of these strange
sculptures have been discovered
ranged around the hearths
of the dwellings. The heads
vary in size from 57 cm.
(almost 2 ft.), shown on left,
to fist sized or smaller figures.
Most are life size. Bizarre figure,

Non-scientists
dissect science
A
32
LT a time when space research has been hotly
criticized as an excessive, even wasteful expenditure of
vast sums of public money, it is of special interest to note
that in the latest issue of "Impact of Science on Society",
Unesco's science quarterly (1), many people from developing
countries feel that space research including moon shots
is highly worthwhile. This point of view, admittedly based
on a small sampling, gives an additional dimension to last
month's issue of the "Unesco Courier" on "Spin-off, the
fruit of space research" (March 1970).
The views favouring space research and moon travel are
among the numerous comments on science and technology
in all their aspects published by "Impact" in a significant
issue entirely devoted to the theme "Non-scientists dissect
science".
The "Impact" survey presents the opinions of "the
average citizen" and of notable "non-scientists", including
novelist-poet Robert Graves, painter Joan Miró, Kenyan
leader, the late Tom M'boya, and philosopher-statesman
Charles Habib Malik of the Lebanon.
On the question of space research, Mochtar Lubis,
publisher of the Djakarta daily, "Indonesia Raya", declares:
"I cannot agree with the criticisms that have been levelled
against the great sums now being spent on space and
nuclear research 	For the first time in his long history,
man is within reach of the stars . . . This newly-gained
freedom, this vast extension of our horizons, is bound to
have great effects on our old habits of thinking, on our old
attitudes and on the familiar relations between nations."
Mrs. Gerónima T. Pecson, Philippine civic leader, agrees
with him. "Much has already been accomplished in the
exploration of space," she says. "The recent fantastic
flights to the moon prove the range of the power of science
and its promise of wonderful new things in the future. Let
the exploration of outer space go on."
The survey suggests that feelings against the moon
landings are strongest in industrially-developed countries.
For example, Robert Graves sharply disagrees about the
value of the moon flights and lumps them into a category
he calls "show-off science".
He says: "It reminds me of a man who leaves his wife
and family to starve while he goes out and fights battles
against strange foes. Until we have got this world in
some sort of order, we should abstain from such expensive
and dangerous nonsense."
The famous novelist hits out strongly at science and
technology. Science, he says, is now dominated by base
motives, such as making money. It "has gradually fallen
into the hands of the traders" ... "Men of broad vision,
the true creators and innovators, have long ceased to
control the evolution or uses made of science."
Robert Graves decries the destruction by technology of
human dignity and individuality and of the warmth of the
home, with people now condemned to live in unnatural
"little life-boxes". Technology, he maintains, is responsible
for the enormous flood of populations into cities: "Science
and technology have themselves created the problem that
science and technology have been vainly trying to solve."
Tom Mboya, in what was perhaps the last article he wrote
before his assassination in July 1969, comments that little
has been done and has often been wrongly done in
bringing the benefits of science and technology to African
peoples. He pleads for technology designed to meet the
needs of African peoples, not just , merely exported to
them. "Importation of technology without appropriate local
research and development," he says, "can lead to a painful
lopsided society, where there is concentration of modernity
in a few cities while the rural areas remain practically as
they have always been."
Humanists have an important say in this issue of
"Impact."
Miguel Angel Asturias, 1967 winner of the Nobel Prize
for literature, calls for a closing of the gap between the
sciences and the humanities, through a re-encounter
between scientists and non-scientists, intellectuals and
technicians which, he says, would offer a brighter prospect
for the settlement of the problems of the Third World.
Charles Habib Malik, former president of the U.N. Gene¬
ral Assembly and now professor of philosophy at the Ame¬
rican University of Beirut, considers that "the great danger
today is that the enormous and absolutely merited prestige
of science and technology might delude scientists into
believing. . . that they are the absolute masters of the uni¬
verse."
Professor Malik sees three areas of danger in the pro¬
gress of science: "the possibility of scientific development
abolishing privacy altogether, so that not only where I am
and what I am doing, but even what I am thinking and feel¬
ing can be penetrated and known at any time; the possibility
of interfering with the genetic development of man; and the
possibility of upsetting whole equilibria of nature, with great
damage to our environment."
ANY of our readers in particular, our scientific
readers" says the editorial in this issue of "Impact", "may
feel that some of the criticisms of science and technology
expressed by the non-scientists are unjust, illogical or
manifest a lack of understanding of how science works,
what it seeks to do and what it is capable of doing."
However, "the significant point," says the editorial, "is that
these stances exist, for whatever reasons, however justly
and with whatever rational validity and that the majority
of them have a definite validity cannot be doubted."
The "non-scientists'" issue of "Impact" is the second of
a trilogy of numbers devoted to exploring the alienation of
science from society. "Impact's" previous number, "The
Science of Humour, The Humour of Science" (No. 3, 1969)
emphasized the humanizing role of humour in science its
role in helping to re-establish science in the mainstream
of cultural life.
Scientists will reply to criticisms of non-scientists in the
third number of the trilogy which will appear shortly (N° 2,
1970). In this issue, nine eminent scientists, among them
the Nobel Prizewinner. Alfred Kastler, rebut and some¬
times endorse the opinions expressed by non-scientists,
and also state their own views on the impact of technology
on human life. This trilogy of "Impact" studies should help
to clarify and give perspective to the troubled relationship
between science and society one of the critical questions
of our time.

Letters to the Editor
MAN AGAINST NATURE
Sir,
Congratulations on the issue devoted
to the defence of Nature (January 1969).
My compliments are all the more sin¬
cere coming from someone whose
country's plants and animals have
suffered and still suffer from the depre¬
dations of man. Descriptions of Chile
written at the time of the Spanish
conquest, in colonial times and at the
start of the 19th century all describe
the unique beauty and rare specimens
of plant and animal life in Chilean
forests, including a number of animals
today all but extinct.
Most of the trees in Chile's central
mountainous region have been felled.
Erosion is widespread and deserts are
expanding, especially towards the south.
Unique plants on the Juan Fernández
islands (on one of which the mariner
Alexander Selkirk, prototype of "Robin¬
son Crusoe", was marooned) have
vanished.
The National Committee for the
Defence of Chilean Flora and Fauna
endeavoured to impose eleventh-
hour protective measures, but these
are still not generally observed. The
world indeed needs a well-organized
International Committee for the Defence
of Nature, as the authors of articles on
man's ravages point out in your issue.

'FISHY' INSCRIPTION
FROM EASTER ISLAND
Sir,
May I be allowed some observations
concerning the article on Easter Island
(Special Anthology number, August-
September 1969). The author, Alfred
Métraux, and I worked together on the
island in 1934 as joint members of a
Franco-Belgian research expedition orga¬
nized by Prof. Paul Rivet of the Musée
de l'Homme in Paris.
My admiration for the accomplish¬
ments of the "Unesco Courier" is such
that I feel obliged to point out a number
of mistakes which mar the presentation
of the subject. The article by Alfred
Métraux, of course, is above reproach,
but not so the accompanying illustra¬
tions and captions.
The photo of the wooden fish engrav¬
ed with symbols was used when the
article first appeared in the "Unesco
Courier" in 1956. I should have object¬
ed to its use at that time, but the
matter slipped my mind, and I regret
this all the more now that the error
has been repeated. The fish is a
crude forgery and the so-called Easter
Island characters it bears are either
clumsy copies or mere inventions.
As for the water colour by Pierre
Loti (facing page), it was done to
please the actress Sarah Bernhardt
and has nothing in common with the
fine sketches executed on the island
by the same artist under his real
name, Julian Viaud, as a midshipman
on the French frigate "Flore"».
Loti's poetic account of Easter Island,
in his book, "Reflets sur la sombre
route", makes no mention of statues
standing on the shore. These, as Loti
relates, "have all been toppled over
and broken". Nor does he refer to
the group of islanders surrounded by
human skulls depicted in the water
colour. Finally, the statues towering
over the islanders in no way resemble
the real monuments.
Loti painted a pretty picture
scientifically absurd notwithstanding
to please a beautiful and famous lady,
and for that he may well be excused.
But the "Unesco Courier" with its
reputation for factual accuracy should
not have been caught napping.
Henri Lavachery
Hon. Professor of Ethnology
and Primitive Arts
University of Brussels, Belgium
Further research has confirmed Prof.
Lavachery's assertions. We regret that
we were misled Into believing In the
authenticity of the fish-shaped wooden
tablet. In the view of Prof. Kenneth
P. Emory, Chairman of the Dept. of
Anthropology at the Bernice P. Bishop
Museum, Honolulu, the fish "was made
simply to sell to visitors, bearing cru¬
dely executed copies of characters of
the Easter Island script with which the
present-day inhabitants are familiar
through photographs of the old Inscrib¬
ed tablets..." Prof. Thomas Barthel,
Director of the Institute of Ethnology
at the University of Tübingen, Fed. Rep.
of Germany, author of an exhaustive
study on the writing inscribed on the
Easter Island tablets, agrees that the
fish tablet is not an authentic work
and was probably forged between 1900
and 1930. Editor.

GANDHI'S INVOLVEMENT
IN POLITICAL ISSUES
Sir,
Some of the articles in your special
issue on Gandhi (October 1969), par¬
ticularly those by non-Indian scholars,
are fascinating. I belong to a family
that has a long tradition of adherence
to Gandhian outlook and principles.
To a sage whose mission it was to
give to others the message of peace
and brotherhood, of love and service,
any political change, a united or divided
India, should not have mattered at
all. It does occur to me at times that
Gandhi's involvement in political issues
has left sad traces.
Some of my friends and associates,
who are opposed to our political think¬
ing, often put questions to me for which
I do not find any satisfactory answer.
For instance, I am asked how I am
to explain the incompatibility of some
of Gandhi's utterances with his creed
of "non-violence". During communal
riots in 1945, Gandhiji observed: "If
Hindus had the right to be killed, they
had the right to kill." In 1947. on the
outbreak of hostilities in Kashmir, he
stated: "Let Sheikh Abdullah and his
associates fight for their homeland."
I am asked why, when India took
over the State of Junagarh in defiance
of the decision of the Muslim ruler
to accede to Pakistan, on the grounds
that the ruler had acted against the
wishes of his Hindu subjects, Gan¬
dhiji did not condemn this as an act
of violence. I am further asked why
Gandhiji went to Kashmir to persuade
its Hindu ruler to accede to India in
disregard of the wishes of his Muslim
subjects.
Belief often obscures reality. Do
these utterances of Gandhiji and his
involvement in politics point to his
deeper political and cultural motiva¬
tions? And what were those motiva¬
tions? None would dispute the fact
that all great personalities have had
weaker facets, a natural consequence
of devotion to a cause and of sin¬
cerity. I believe, and I hope many of
your readers will agree with me, that
in the rational assessment of the facts
of his life, of the strong and weak
sides of his personality, lies the real
greatness of a personage.

'COURIER' IN SWAHILI
Sir,
What I enjoy most about the "Unesco
Courier" is its global outlook and cov¬
erage, and the fact that it keeps me in
touch with modern ideas and attitudes.
Your presentation of major world
problems is particularly worthwhile, as
in the case of Unesco's efforts to
protect and preserve the cultural and
artistic treasures and traditions of diff¬
erent countries; what Unesco ¡s doing
to combat racial prejudice and other
forms of discrimination; world efforts
to solve the crisis of food and people;
the promotion of human rights, of which
your November 1968 number was a
striking example.
To ensure that the "Unesco Courier"
is known and read throughout the
world, would you please add more lan¬
guage editions. I suggest one should
be published in Swahili. People all
over the world are anxious to get to
know one another better, to understand
the ways and customs of others and
why they have adopted their own
special modes of life.

'Turning Point'
for world education
With a population of almost 1,500 million
below the age of 15, the world manages
to give barely a quarter any primary
education at all and less than one In 12
any secondary schooling. This is one of
the disquieting facts revealed in "Turning
Point," a 30-minute television film produced
by Unesco for International Education Year
1970 (1). The film reminds the world how
much remains to be tackled on the educa¬
tion front: shortage of teachers and equip¬
ment, Inadequate planning, resistance to
change, outdated teaching methods and
programmes. It also shows more hopeful
aspects: the increasing use of audio-visual
aids and the new interest and expansion
In lifelong education, for example.

rise and fall like the oceans every day.
Columbia University scientists studying the
continental United States have found that
the land rises and falls an average of
12 inches twice daily. Using instruments
with the sensitivity and long-term stability
to measure over long periods, they carried
out the most detailed measurements ever
made of these solid-earth tides. The earth
tides are greatly influenced by ocean tides,
even at points far inland, and also indi¬
rectly by atmospheric pressure and tem¬
perature variations.
Science and the future
Scientific events of the past year and
scientists' predictions for the future are
presented In non-technical _terms in the
recently published "1970 Britannica Year¬
book of Science and the Future" (Encyclo¬
paedia Britannica, Inc., Chicago, U.S.A.;
448 pages, $12.50.) The Yearbook's 18 arti¬
cles, whose authors include two Nobel
prize winners, cover many subjects of
current significance such as space explo¬
ration, the brain, oceanography, sleep and
dreams, archaeology, game theory and
molecular biology. A 172-page "Science
Year Review" analyzes major scientific
achievements and activities between July
1968 and June 1969.
Fish farming on
'the roof of the world'
Chinese carp, introduced into the water¬
logged rice paddy fields of Nepal, are
helping to increase the protein content of
Nepalese diets and to provide a double
crop from the same land. At Pipley, 75 mi¬
les from Katmandu, an FAO team, has
established _ Nepal's first commercial fish
farm, comprising nine man-made fish ponds
which are expected to produce some
40 tons of fish annually.
Flashes...
The world fish catch for 1968 attained
a record 64 million metric tons 3,300,000
tons more than in 1967 says a recent
FAO report.
An Institute of educational research is
being set up in Abidjan, Ivory Coast, with
aid from the U.N. Development Programme
and Unesco.
Soil erosion often the result of man's
misuse affects 15 per cent of the world's
agricultural land, causing an annual loss of
over $4,000 million, reports FAO.
Six Unesco specialists are to help
launch a technical education project in
Kuwait which needs to train 1,000 techni¬
cians within the next five years.
The sea floor between Japan and Taiwan
may contain one of the world's richest
oil reservoirs, according to a recent geo¬
physical survey of the East China Sea and
the Yellow Sea.
