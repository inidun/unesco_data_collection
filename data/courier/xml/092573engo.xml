EQ-WAH-001
1990, acrylic on wood (200 by 140 cm)
by Poh Siew Wah
In this diptych, the Singaporean
painter Poh Siew Wah has sought to
depict the human endeavour to
achieve what he calls "equilibrium",
an ideal of harmony uniting humankind
and nature as well as linking human
beings themselves. Poh has written
that his work is "much inspired by
Italian Renaissance architecture, the
idea of orderliness of Piet Mondrian,
and Kandinsky's call for spirituality in
art."

talks to Bahgat Elnadi and Adel Rifaat Hervé Bourges began his career in
journalism as editor-in-chief of the
French weekly Témoignage
chrétien. An early supporter of
Algerian independence, he was from
1962 to 1965 technical adviser to
the President of the Algerian
Republic and director of
Algeria's Ministry of Youth and
Popular Education. After serving as
director of several schools of
journalism and research institutes,
he became director of Unesco's
Office of Public Information and
spokesman for the Director-General
(1980-1981). He then became head
of Radio France Internationale and
in 1983 was appointed chairman-
director-general of the French
public television channel TF1, a post
which he held until the channel was
privatized in 1987. In December
1990 he became chairman of the
public-sector channels A2 and FR3.
He has written a number of books
including Décoloniser l'information
(1978), Les cinquante Afriques
(with C. Wauthier, 1979),
Une chaîne sur les bras (1987)
and Un amour de télévision (1989).

<![CDATA[
You are a champion ofpublic-service televi¬
sion. Could you tell us what you think about
the comparative meritsand demeritsof
public and private systems in this field,
always bearing in mind that the whole issue
is more complicated in the countries of the
South where, in many cases, state control of
the audiovisual media, especially television,
is synonymous neither with freedom nor
quality.
-Before answering perhaps I should say a
word or two about myself. I am in charge of
the two public channels of French television
and before that I was between 1983 and 1987
head of another channel, TF1, which was also
then public. I am a professional, not a theo¬
rist, and I will answer your questions in the
light of my experience of communication in
general and of French television in particular.
In the countries of Western Europe,
which developed their television networks in
the 1950s and 1960s, the basic principle of
public service in the audiovisual media is to
enable the small screen to serve the interests
of the community. One characteristic of
democracies is that they encourage respect
for impartiality, so that communications are
not governed by economic interests or poli¬
tical pressures. Here, obviously, I am talking
in ideal terms.
In practice, the public service always has
to cope with all kinds of contingencies.
There is a budget, authorities to which it is
answerable, red tape, a governing body, civil
servants, unions	 But private-sector tele¬
vision doesn't have a completely free hand,
either. The product is appealing in the case of
a pay-TV channel like Canal+ in France
which sells itself on its quality. Elsewhere
advertising the be-all and end-all for share¬
holders king, and no amount of rules
and regulations can transform a supermarket
into a cultural centre. The French system is a
mixed system which could in many respects
be improved. Some people think it's neither
one thing nor another. There is no longer a
monopoly, and the public-sector channels
are partly financed by advertising. Those
who look back nostalgically to the old days
think that the programmes are not as good as
they were a case that is not proven.
One also hears it said that perhaps adver¬
tising should be banned from the public-
sector channels in France, or that one of the
public-sector channels should be privatized.
It is hard to say what the right formula
should be. It's a political matter. My own firm
belief is that public service television limited
to a single channel would soon become a has-
been, a travesty of public service.
I am also convinced that this is a futile
debate. Viewers do not choose to watch pro¬
grammes because of what they feel about the
shareholders of the channels that broadcast
them.
On the other hand two things are cer¬
tain. Firstly, since the establishment of an
independent regulatory body ten years ago,
news and current affairs broadcasting has
been carried out in a context of freedom and
pluralism. Secondly, since programme
supply has increased to six channels, the
Viewers express their choice
through the handiest form of
voting instrument that exists,
the remote control. No theory
can escape the zapping test.
French watch television on average half an
hour more per day than they did ten years
ago. You may think that this isn't much of
an achievement, but the objectivity of the
figures is a factor in its favour.
Audience movements are signs of vita¬
lity. After fifty years of television, viewers
express their choices through the handiest
form of voting instrument that exists, the
remote control. No theory can escape the
zapping test.
So public attitudes must constantly be
observed and studied; audience expectations
must be deciphered.
There are no ready-made solutions in the
world of the audiovisual media. The French
model insofar as such a model exists
could certainly not be exported as it stands,
either to the countries of the East or to the
countries of the South. Some soap operas and
game-shows may have an audience in many
countries. But not programming concepts.
Pluralism and professionalism, on the
other hand, are universally valid ground-
rules. Pluralism, by which I mean of course
constitutional pluralism, is the basic condition
of the exercise of freedom of information. But
there must also be economic and professional
pluralism. When there is only one source, a
single newspaper, a single broadcaster, the
temptation is too strong to . . . let us say . . .
stage-manage the debate. Such a system is
rarely efficient in the medium or long term.
And it will be even less so now that the new
information1 technologies are abolishing
frontiers.
As for professionalism, I would say that
it is winning its spurs with the arrival of a
third generation of television people who did
not experience the enthusiasm of the pio¬
neers or the disenchantment of the children
of 1968.
With the increasing globalization of the
audiovisual media, people everywhere are
becoming more receptive in outlook, and
peoples and cultures are being brought closer
together. On the other hand, images of vio¬
lence andpornography are spreading and so,
perhaps more insidiously, are nationalist,
xenophobic and even racist ideas. How can
we reconcile the demands of openness and
freedom of expression with the need to pro¬
hibit excesses, without seeming to advocate
censorship?

<![CDATA[
Today the public calls the tune. This is
increasingly evident in America and Europe.
But we must understand the freedom-related
phenomena which are taking place in the
countries of the South, where satellites have
brought the audiovisual frontiers tumbling
down, not only in big cities like Algiers and
Dakar but in regions where TV had never
reached before. There are more and more
broadcasters. The supply of programmes is
diversifying, from the big nation-wide net¬
works, such as the BBC, Canal France Inter¬
national, the Servicio Iberoamericano de
Noticias, to pay TV, religious broadcasting,
educational and cultural television, and lan¬
guage programmes	
Something important is happening.
Whereas national television networks
enjoyed an undisputed monopoly until
If swift action is not taken,
some countries will be
deprived of their own
means of audiovisual
expression, except when it
comes to home news.
recently, outside voices are beginning to be
heard. Television without frontiers establishes
defacto cultural and political pluralism. More
than ever the national broadcasters will have
to harmonize their strategies and make lasting
partnerships with other stations and with
international organizations. If swift action is
not taken, some countries will be deprived of
their means of audiovisual expression, except
when it comes to home news.
Some satellites also beam violent or por¬
nographic programmes different countries
and cultures have different views about these
mattersbut I think that this is a marginal
phenomenon.
As far as we are concerned, it is to the
credit of public-service television in France
that any programme is rejected for domestic
or external broadcasting if it is likely to
encourage social, cultural, political, religious
or sexual exclusion. But it is not our role
and here I can perhaps speak on behalf of all
the other broadcastersto try to ban pro¬
grammes on other channels than those
which are under our authority.
We are committed to the fundamental
principle of the editorial responsibility of the
broadcaster, which is a corollary of freedom
of communication, and experience has
taught us to be wary of all forms of external
control as a matter of principle, however
well intentioned. Censorship is always per¬
nicious. The person in charge must be ans¬
werable for his or her programmes before
the competent legal authorities.
Interestingly enough, an international
law of audiovisual communication is emerg¬
ing. There have been many examples of
this, recently, in the fields of copyright and
performing rights. It is now clear that an
international broadcaster is answerable to
the law. There will soon be no more room
for pirates, except on the high seas!
Expressions of nationalism or even xeno¬
phobia are not, unfortunately, confined to
any particular broadcasting system. They are
everywhere. People must combat them at
their own level of responsibility. Personally,
I am constantly preoccupied with this.
Does the influence of viewing figures on
television programming necessarily mean
that programmes will become more
mediocre? Driven by competition from the
private sector and by the need for adver¬
tising revenue, the public sector seems to be
heading inexorably in this direction. Does
catering to a mass audience necessarily mean
pandering to the lowest common denomi¬
nator?
you are alluding to an internal
French debate. Believe me, the accusation is
quite groundless. Go to Britain, Italy or
Spain. Listen and compare. There have never
been so many programmes about discov¬
eries, culture, creationon French television
at any rate. Our public service fully per¬
forms its role of providing information,
entertainment and culture by offering to the
widest public the broadest range of pro¬
grammes what we call television for all.
News broadcasting is free, comprehen¬
sive in its scope, pluralistic. Live broadcast¬
ing makes it possible to experience great
events from the inside.
In the early 1960s, Jean Prat's adaptation
of Aeschylus's Persae was watched by a mil¬
lion viewers and people still talk about it as a
miracle thirty years later. At that time,
however, viewers had no choice, there was
only one channel, it was Aeschylus or
nothing.
Last July, Puccini's masterpiece, Tosca,
with Domingo, Raimondi and Malfitano was
watched by viewers all over the world, in¬
cluding two million in France. Thousands of
viewers had a choice between at least three
programmes. The audience meter does that
too; it measures real success.
So why should there be there such a
misunderstanding?
I think that television is a kind of hostage
in a wider social and cultural debate about
the role of the school, about leisure, about
training. Television isn't the real culprit, but
a scapegoat is needed. In the past, French
governments believed that it was indispen¬
sable to hold the keys of information. Until
the day when politicians realized that the
media did not form opinion not by swim¬
ming against the tide at any rate.
Is itpossible to imagine, in the North, televi¬
sion that would also be valid for viewers in
the South?
Here we are still making empirical obser¬
vations rather than scientific measurements.

We are discovering the effects of the interna¬
tionalization of the media and the transmis¬
sion speed of images and ideas. There are
three major poles. The United States, Japan
and Europe share a market in which the eco¬
nomic and cultural stakes are immense. But
viewers, who participate to varying degrees
in the globalization of cultural attitudes and
consumer practices, live in a specific context.
So, with the globalization of news and pro¬
gramming, there seems to be an increasing
need for programmes that are less remote.
How can we define this need? How can we
satisfy it? I think that these questions should
provide food for thought when it comes to
organizing efficient co-operation.
Television is already fifty years old. How far
has it fulfilled thepromise of its early years?
It made no promises, except to open a
window on the world. And it has done this.
So what expectations has television
betrayed? Perhaps those of visionaries such
as André Malraux, who imagined that its
transforming powers would be equal to
those of the printing-press. The extraordi
nary opening up that has occurred has not
changed the world, only ways of life.
Today, in a country like France, the av¬
erage viewer watches television for three
hours a day. Watching television has taken
the place of individual or group leisure acti¬
vities such as playing cards, family life, meet¬
ing the neighbours. Old traditions kept alive
by story-tellers are becoming museum
pieces. The oral tradition is disappearing. As
McLuhan said, we live in a global village.
But doubtless people have not changed.
When something close to home happens,
local ties soon take precedence over uni¬
versal affairs.
How do you see the future of television and
cinema?
The cinemas have emptied and the viewer
has become more of a stay-at-home because
of the development of television. There was
a time when people went to the cinema
almost every week. It was the family pas¬
time. Today cinema-going is largely confined
to the under-twenty-fives. If there is still so
much vitality in the film industry, it is
because it has learned to adapt to new
forms of image-consumption television
and video. TV provides most of the finan¬
cing for films. This is true in France where it
has always been government policy to sup¬
port French cinema, but also in the United
States, under the influence of market forces.
Nowadays showing films in cinemas is in a
sense the Formula 1 of the audiovisual
media. It acts as a test-bench and a source of
prestige. This is an important change, but
from an artistic point of view it is perhaps no
more fundamental than the change from
silent to talking films.
Will the new audiovisual techniques, espe¬
cially high-definition TV, pave the way for
higher quality and greater creativity or only
an increasing preoccupation with mass
entertainment?
To my mind, neither one thing nor the
other. High-definition television uses the
same basic techniques as mass television
Hertzian wave diffusion and the cathode ray
tube. All it changes is sound and image qua¬
lity at the moment of reception by satellite

Already people can do
their own TV programming;
they can zap.
or by cable. There is no fundamental tech¬
nical improvement from the point of view of
the producer. The best image for high defini¬
tion is still 35 mm or 70 mm film, and digital
technology can be applied to all kinds of
supports. As for the wide screens manufac¬
turers envisage for the future, let me tell you
that they will exist in ordinary standard ver¬
sions. What is really happening, behind all
the technological innovations, is a big fight
between the major European, American and
Japanese companies. Considering the speed
with which the economies of the three
industrial blocs are hooking up, this is per¬
haps the last great challenge for the electro¬
nics industry in the twentieth century.
The effects of technological change are
often unpredictable. Think of FM radio
which has become popular in France with
the development of small independent sta¬
tions. The compact disc, which brought
improvements to audio that are perhaps
comparable to those that high definition
television will bring to video, has first and
foremost led record publishers to give prio¬
rity to their classical music lists and compila¬
tions of show-business hits.
Today, contrary to what many people
believe, the trend towards catering to a mass
audience has stopped; progress has not
continued along the lines that might have
been imagined at the end of the 1960s. The
globalization which audiovisual communica¬
tion makes possible has been accompanied
by many innovations of a more or less inter¬
active nature. The diversification of the
supply of mass programmes, over the air¬
waves or by satellite, is only a stage. Already
people can do their own TV programming;
they can zap. In France VCRs and light cam¬
corders constitute what amounts to an
eighth channel, on which the French now
spend 25 per cent of their culture and leisure
budget. We are far from the electronic high
mass that celebrated man's first steps on the
Moon. Events like the Olympic Games that
generate intense emotion all over the planet
are still broadcast. But what's wrong with
that? Television has grown up, reached the
age when one has a few less illusions.

<![CDATA[
A mysterious medium
By Jean-Claude Guillebaud
THE cultural hegemony of television, this reign of
the image that extends over the entire planet, is
disturbing because it is largely incomprehensible.
Television's empire obeys laws that have not yet been
fully grasped, and brings into play emotional mecha¬
nisms that nobody entirely masters. Rarely has any
creation become so independent of its creator. Televi¬
sion is an explosive, hazardous instrument, an ambiva¬
lent and proliferating spirit peddling a symbolism
whose meaning is uncertain. It is both all-powerful and
much less mature than people imagine. The empire of
television extends around the planet; but it is an empire
ruled by a child.
There is something mysterious about what appears
on the television screen and the "message" it sends
across the world. No-one can predict precisely what
signal will be transmitted to the viewer neither the
journalist, the technician, the politician sitting under the
studio lights, nor the producer. The reason for this
unpredictability is that the message vehicled by televi¬
sion does not consist exclusively of words, or reflection,
or pictures, or a duplication of the real world, but of a
complex mixture of all of these things so complex, in
fact, that no-one can totally control it.
A tiny gesture caught by the camera can rob an argu¬
ment of its content. The unexpected impact of a single
image can erase the meaning from a thousand words of
commentary. The accidental drama of a live report last¬
ing a few seconds can ignite flames of emotion in mil¬
lions of homes. A moment of silence can say more than
a speech. What the pitiless eye of the camera looks for is
authenticity, a mysterious capacity to move or to
convince, the elusive heart of the matter. This random,
unpredictable quality of television is grounds for humi¬
lity. Perhaps this is why it receives so little attention.
People usually tend to criticize the manipulative
power of the image. The subversive genius of television,
which now crosses frontiers with the aid of dish
antennae, eluding all kinds of censorship, played no
small part in the collapse of communism. The telefrenzy
that accompanied the Gulf War further demonstrated
that even in democracies public opinion could be para¬
lyzed by a (calculated) surfeit of images.
This manipulative power explains why television is
politically so important in every nation of the world. A
survey has shown that in 102 countries television is
directly controlled by the state. Even in the most demo¬
cratic countries, the political authorities have never
entirely relinquished influence over the small screen,
and the "televisual landscape" is the subject of constant,
though often misguided, debate.
That is not all. Television has radically affected the
functioning of democracy itself. It undermines the
influence of intermediary bodies and representative ins¬
titutions such as parliaments. It replaces, at least partly,
the elective principle with the ephemeral and uncertain
reign of the public opinion poll. It highlights declara¬
tions of political intent rather than political action, and
encourages politicians to stage "media coups". By turn¬
ing its spotlight on criminal investigation procedures, it
unsettles the judicial system. The list is endless.
In all of these cases the result is the same. Represen¬
tative democracy has been transformed by television. It
has moved away from the principles on which it was
once based and the precise mechanisms invented by its
theorists, from Rousseau to de Tocqueville, from Mon¬
tesquieu to Adam Smith. A new, ambiguous and only
imperfectly conceptualized political model is now at
work, literally before our eyes. The model is that of
"media democracy", and neither constitutions nor laws
have been adapted to it. Hence the widespread anxiety
about television, a malaise that seems likely to be with
us for some time.
It is not hard to see what is at stake. Confronted by
this mysterious box that so suddenly appeared a few
decades ago, we are all learning our way on both sides
of the screen. On one side techniques of manipulation
are being developed and refined. On the other the view¬
ing public is gradually learning to detect lies, to decipher
the sometimes false evidence of the image and to resist
the television barrage that it has for the most part
passively accepted until now. A race is on between the
two, and what hangs in the balance is democracy.
By a strange paradox, television, which is both futu¬
ristic and archaic, takes us back into a world of magic.
We must find the right way out. O

EIRUT 1985. A TWA airliner has been

headlines. It is the coverage organized
from the airport by the American television
channel Cable News Network (CNN), which
launches seventeen days of on-the-spot report¬
ing, broadcast live around the clock. Relayed
by five satellites, the information is picked up
across the globe. The impact is worldwide. The

news, even though both these fields are tar¬
geted, and even over-exploited, by America's
three major television networks, ABC, CBS
and NBC. After winning awards for its report¬
ing of the San Francisco earthquake and the
stock market crash of October 1987, CNN
smashed audience records with its coverage of
the rescue of a child who had fallen down a
well, the Smith-Kennedy rape trial and the hear¬
ings involving Judge Thomas, the candidate for
the U.S. Supreme Court who was accused of
sexual harassment by a former colleague.
The CNN network actually consists of two
channels: CNN1, which goes out to 55 million
American subscribers, and CNN Headline
News, received by 35 million cabled homes.
While the former puts out a bulletin every two
hours, the latter has continuous transmission
with two-hourly updating. Both limit their
coverage to news stories, approached in a very
flexible manner.
About half the organization's 2,000 journal¬
ists and technicians work at its headquarters in
Atlanta. There is satellite linkage to ten regional
offices and fifteen bureaux outside the United
States. CNN images, transmitted by more than
200 independent stations in the United States as
well as by twenty more in Asia, Europe and
Latin America, feature in many news bulletins.
Nobody could deny that CNN is currently
the world's largest news outfit, but the univer¬
sality of its audience raises some ethical prob¬
lems for subscribers and professionals alike.
Its achievements in the field of the democrati¬
zation of information are unquestionable. It has
opened up to a large audience aspects of poli¬
tical and social life that were hitherto reserved
for élites or specialists, and has made it possible
for viewers in countries where the flow of
information is controlled to hear commentary
and analysis by independent journalists. The
network's coverage also benefits from the edi¬
torial freedom that direct and continuous
coverage of an event can provide. All these
attainments, made possible by a combination of
democracy and technology, help guarantee the
press its status as the "fourth estate".
One-way
communication
But the problems raised are on a par with
CNN's global impact. The network operates in
one direction only, North-South. Its broadcast¬
ers not only have the technology and the finan¬
cial resources but also the last word on every
subject they cover. In the developing countries,
on the other hand, there is often no-one with
responsibility for news-gathering. Worse still,
information may be manipulated. Even when it
is not taboo, press freedom is frequently no
more than an abstract notion. In this context,
the question of the content and objectivity of
news broadcasts received from the North is
overshadowed by another, more fundamental
one, that of the availability of information.
Matters become more complicated if the
broadcaster, caught up in the power game,
decides to pass over certain facts in silence.
That raises a fresh problem, for the retention of
information is ultimately a form of censorship.
Viewers who feel uneasy about it may react in
different ways, either identifying with or reject¬
ing the broadcaster's message.
The results are particularly upsetting since
television, because of the power of the image,
has established itself as the most credible of the
news media, while at the same time providing
ample evidence to show that it is also the most
easily manipulated. It has introduced an
approach to news that emphasizes speed over
accuracy, and makes appearances more impor¬
tant than the truth. Newspaper journalists and
photographers have been dragged along in tele¬
vision's wake, trapped by the fact that viewers,
seeing the world through the lens of the small
screen, forget that the field of reality shown is
only a camera-frame wide even when the
CNN images (from top):
a correspondent in Moscow,

scene has not in fact been set up, because of the

Television has passed on its obsession with
speed to the press. To meet the challenge,
newspaper stories are less and less likely to be
held back for want of checking. Editors are
increasingly inclined to run them, accompanied
by the now-classic disclaimer "According to
unconfirmed reports. . . ." Television also sets a
particular reporting style, favouring emotion
and on-the-spot coverage over analysis and
reflection. This puts pressure on the press to
modify its own way of presenting the news.
Nowadays many articles read like screenplays,
employing verbal effects, suspense, subplots,
dying falls. As a result, news reports that once
had the authority of public records have
become, with a few honourable exceptions, as
transient as television images. Journalists are no
longer dispassionate observers. Now they are
witnesses, like the television camera itself.
The press has also borrowed the idea of star
quality from television. More and more news¬
papers publish photographs of their reporters,
who thereby become media figures themselves.
Techniques learned from advertising have
taken the place of editorial policies: the reader
is subjected to a non-stop barrage of media-
speak. Obliged to follow television's lead as to
what the big stories are, the press increasingly
tends to pass over important events whose
significance is not immediately apparent, and
the headlines end up by neglecting matters of
considerable moment. All these linked factors
lead to outrageous simplifications and the pre¬
sentation of facts without any context.
The five pillars
of the contemporary
WORLD
The results of this process can be surprising.
The world emerges portrayed in five categories,
with news, politics (itself often handled in
terms of human interest), the weather, business
and sport featuring in varying orders of pri¬
ority. Radio, the press and television all bear
daily witness to this new order of things.
Paradoxically, seeing the same television
images again and again can actually reduce the
impact of some subjects alarmingly. Regular
coverage of the developing world as menaced
by overpopulation, underdevelopment, disease
and intolerance ends up by creating a cliché that
then becomes accepted as the truth. It is not a
question of conscious and deliberate distortion
on anyone's part; this image of the South simply
flows naturally from a system that favours
shock-value because it attracts big audiences.
If the South is shown as under threat, the
North too is reflected in a distorting mirror.
One only has to live in a peaceful suburb of
Washington, D.C., to know just how partial
and deceptive the city's image as the "capital of
crime" can be despite the fact that crimes do
occur. But the misdeeds of a drug dealer or
Madonna's latest publicity stunt make juicier
leads for news programmes than the altruism
shown by voluntary fire-fighters or the middle-
class virtues of the silent majority.
But the danger is not so great for the North,
which is in a position to defend itself. Contrary
to the commonly-held view, American broad¬
casting is not a monolithic bloc, despite the
dominating role of the major networks. There
are masses of independent newspapers and tele¬
vision stations: from seventy in 1972 their
numbers have now swelled to more than 300.
They have a 25-per-cent audience share, and
are protected by strict legislation, as well as by
regulatory mechanisms befitting American
society's view of the defence of liberties.
In the countries of the Third World,
however, the problems inherent in the globali¬
zation of information are acute. The developing
nations are unable to challenge the process
either with their own media or with their per¬
ception of world affairs. It is not so much the
Third World's failings as its crying needs that
have been highlighted by the functioning of the
world information system over the past few
years. The South has responded to the domi¬
nance of CNN, whose founder sensed at the
right moment that the provision of information
would be the growth area of the twenty-first
century, with old-fashioned debates about the
role of the public and private sectors, freedom
of the press and state control, freedom of
expression and archaic taboos, a policy of
openness or one of closed doors.
The debate on the dangers of one-way com¬
munication is still taken more seriously in the
North. Here too CNN is in the front line. O

Current affairs
IN August 1990, American video enthusiasts
who had been discontented with the media's
position at the time of the armed interven¬
tions on the island of Grenada and in Panama
got together to find a way of putting their point
of view across in case war broke out in the
Gulf. As the months went by, and conflict
became inevitable, they managed to find the
necessary resources to produce and broadcast a
series of four half-hour programmes. The Gulf
Crisis TV project was born.
As their means were limited to about
$25,000, they appealed to anyone who had
visual material relating to the circumstances sur¬
rounding the crisis to help them. By mid-
December, they had collected some 200 videos
from which they took the material for four edu¬
cational programmes. Reflecting diverse points
of view, the programmes sketched the historical
background of the United States engagement in
the Middle East and analysed the links between
the oil and arms industries. They also covered
the activities of pacifist groups.
The individuals in charge of the project then
set their imaginations to work to find ways of
getting the programmes shown. They staged
mobile screenings from the back of a truck in
city squares and supermarket parking lots, and
copied the material onto thousands of videos
that were shown in art galleries, museums and
colleges, and were also passed on from hand to
hand.
Finally, thanks to the backing of anti-war
groups, Gulf Crisis TV's programmes were
shown on the Public Broadcasting System (PBS)
network, which beamed them by satellite to the
nation's major cities. In the first two weeks of
January they attracted an audience the pro¬
gramme-makers could hardly have expected on
such a cheap budget, coming second in the Los
Angeles audience ratings. Later they were broad¬
cast by Channel Four in the United Kingdom,
and then in some fifteen other countries.
"Hand-made" television
Gulf Crisis TV did not start from scratch. It
built on the ten-year experience of Paper Tiger
TV, which puts out a weekly analysis of a
media event such as an exhibition, a television
series or an item from the written press. Start¬
ing in 1981 with an in-depth analysis of The
New York Times, Paper Tiger has since put
together more than 400 broadcasts on subjects
as diverse as the passionate reactions to the TV
series Dynasty, and media treatment of the
Baby M case, in which a surrogate mother
refused to hand over her child to the prospective
parents.
Paper Tiger is one of 200 weekly series
transmitted by New York's public cable televi¬
sion, which is reserved for local productions
and whose only selection criterion is "First

come, first served". As a result, Paper Tiger is
transmitted along with programmes on astrol¬
ogy and broadcasts for teenagers, ethnic minor¬
ities, women's organizations and the Boy
Scouts of America.
On schedule each week, the attention of
channel-hoppers is caught by the programme's
unusual set, painted in comic-strip style. The
broadcast goes out live, since the "Tigers"
artists, film editors, critics, teachers and stu¬
dents of television, all of them unpaid have
neither the time, energy or money to put it out
later in a taped version. It is "hand-made" tele¬
vision, incorporating long shots of the studio
so as to demystify the process of production.
The low cost of the programme is indicated in
the credits; it rarely comes to more than $300.
Financial backing comes mainly from public
subsidies, but as the backlist of programmes
grows, video rental is gradually becoming more
important.
High tech and cheap video
The Gulf Crisis TV Project also drew on the
experience of Deep Dish, a group that for the
past five years has been distributing the work
of independent directors in the United States
and Canada. A central computer selects repre¬
sentative segments from their videos and
assembles them into a series of short, thirty-
minute films on such subjects as ecology, Aids,
censorship or civil rights. The titles of the
videos are listed in the closing credits alongside
the names and addresses of their distributors,
and a complete catalogue is available on
request. Beamed up to a satellite, the pro¬
grammes are then picked up by public broad¬
casting channels and universities. So high tech¬
nology links up with low-budget video to
make more voices heard and to nourish the
multicultural trend that emerged in the United
States in the 1980s.
By their methods of production and distri¬
bution, these experiments in alternative televi¬
sion hold out the prospect of a more accessible
media horizon, opening not on some Orwellian
vision of a global village but instead on a kind
of democracy of the image in which people can
decide for themselves how they are represented
in the media. O 13

Human interest
This is

'Reality shows'
attract big
audiences by
putting ordinary
people in the
spotlight ON the set of L'Amour en danger, a pro¬
gramme broadcast by France's TF1
channel, Danielle and Alain unasham¬
edly reveal their sexual and marital problems. A
psychoanalyst helps them understand why
their relationship is not working.
On the same channel, a reunion takes place
on Perdu de vue, a programme in which view¬
ers phone in to help someone in the studio
trace a missing person. After thirty-six years of
separation, Josiane is reunited with her father.
Tearfully she declares that the programme has
given her the best day of her life.
La nuit des héros, on the A2 channel, tells
stories with happy endings. Everyman becomes
a hero in the shape of Michel, a young man
who saved his young brother from the flames.
On television screens all over the world,
similar programmes, somewhere between
documentary and fiction, feature human
dramas, anguished couples, families torn apart.
They use some of the techniques of documen¬
tary investigations, with interviews playing an
important role. The facts are recounted by a
journalist, relived by the protagonists or staged
by actors. Emotion on camera is the one ingre¬
dient all the shows have in common.
The "reality show" was born in the United
States as the brainchild of local TV stations
eager to compete with the national networks
which, noting their success, proceeded to take
over the genre. NBC was the first off the mark,
with Missing Persons, which set out to trace
people who had disappeared. CBS followed up
with Rescue 911, the big brother of La nuit des
héros. In America's Most Wanted, no longer on
the air, viewers were invited to help find a cri¬
minal on the run. Today's star programme is
Studs, in which men are confronted with girls
they have seduced, who have to answer indis¬
creet questions put to them by the host,
inventor of the reality smut show.
In Europe, the Italian show Chi I'ha visto,
on the RAI3 channel, seeks to trace runaway
wives, husbands or children or lost loves. In
Britain, BBC2's Crimewatch UK asks viewers
to help track criminals or witnesses.
What all these programmes have in
common is low costs and big audiences a
winning formula that attracts 100 million
regular viewers in the United States alone, pro¬
viding seven of the top ten prime-time shows.
Reality shows have also hit the jackpot in
France, where six of them were launched
within six months. Perdu de vue reaches almost
30 per cent of the prime-time audience.
Voyeurism triumphant
More than just audience-pullers, reality shows
have become a social phenomenon. People dis¬
cuss them everywhere, and also question their
role, for they arouse strong feelings. Intellec¬
tuals, journalists and critics can hardly find
terms strong enough to express their distaste.
"Garbage", "voyeurism", "pick-up shows" and
"smear television" are among the phrases that
have been used.
In France the viewers' association known as

Eyeball to Eyeball (1992), a
drawing by Villoría.
JUSTINE BOISSARD is a
French freelance journalist
who writes for the film
quarterly Panoramiques.
"Les pieds dans le PAF"1. is a particularly
severe critic of reality shows. What worries us,"
says Stéphane Pocrain, the association's vice-
president, "is the way in which emotion and
distress are used for purely commercial ends."
The shows cover real social problems such as
Aids, unemployment, insecurity and marital
problems. "But they only skim over the prob¬
lems," he adds. "All that matters is the emo¬
tion, which guarantees good viewing figures.
The shows are staged so that the dramatic
intensity steadily increases to the point at
which the individual in front of the cameras,
whether he or she is an Aids victim or someone
looking for a close relative, bursts into tears.
There's invariably an advertising break imme¬
diately afterwards."
In the association's view the overwhelming
importance attached to emotion leads to all
sorts of chicanery. "With the reality shows,
voyeurism is in control. Viewers see a produc¬
tion full of drama and sentiment. But they are
duped. The emotion is faked, because when the
programmes are recorded in advance only the
high spots are kept for transmission."
Another danger is the threat of smears,
unsubstantiated accusations and the settling of
scores perpetrated under the pretext of the
search for lost loved ones.
The producers of these programmes band
together in face of their detractors. Bernard
Bouthier of TF1 insists, "We haven't gone too
far. Thanks to careful checking, there have been
no false witnesses on Perdu de vue. There is a
high-minded élite that criticizes our shows in
principle, but can't find anything concrete to
attack us with."
When they are accused of profiting from
emotional turmoil and tear-jerking, the produc¬
ers protest. "Viewers recognize themselves in
our programmes," Bouthier explains. "When
we present couples' problems or trace a loved
one, the viewers feel involved. They're not
voyeurs, because they are sharing the emotion
of the participants. Nobody complained of
tear-jerking when Serge Gainsbourg talked
about his sexual conquests or when Michael
Jackson's sister revealed that her father had
raped her. But when ordinary people are
involved, suddenly it's a scandal."
'Don't forget meV
The reality shows are television-as-neighbour,
prying into the most intimate corners of
people's lives. This confessional branch of
broadcasting has emerged at a time when "the
stars make people dream less and less," explains
sociologist Gilles Lipovetski. "Big shows with
glitter and fake jewellery have become so com¬
monplace that they have lost much of their old
fascination. As for fiction series, they are too
academic or just too repetitive." The reality
shows, on the other hand, "touch the heart¬
strings of the millions." Lipovetski claims that
they are more unpredictable and so generate
stronger emotion. "Reality outdoes fiction." 4 _

air, and that is doubtless the secret of their suc¬
cess. "There's a process of identification and
involvement," notes Philippe Plaisance of La
nuit des héros. "In an individualistic society like
ours, it's a way for everyone to say 'Don't
forget me'."
In Gilles Lipovetski's view, "This type of
programme would not have been possible a few
years ago. In 1968 people wouldn't have been
interested in reality shows because they
thought politics could solve all social problems.
Today, with the crisis of ideologies, there is a
return to the values of listening and helping one
another, to a certain morality." Television
seems to be playing a new role as a kind of fairy
godmother.
The producers of Perdu de vue receive more
than 2,000 letters a month. "People write to us
because they don't know who else to turn to,"
says Bernard Bouthier. "And most of the
couples that appear on L'amour en danger have
never dared to consult a psychotherapist. They
are more scared of specialists than of television."
"It may not be Lourdes, but it has helped
me to discover how much my husband needs
me," says Florence, one participant in the
show. "TF1 surrounded me like a family."
People who take part feel they are really being
listened to. In exchange, they make their story
public property.
But television is interested in people and
prides itself on doing a good job. Before and
after the show, there are frequent discussions
between the programme-makers and those
taking part. Perdu de vue solves about thirty
cases a week, including some that never get on
the air. "People think we are more Machiavel¬
lian than we are," Bernard Bouthier claims.
"Actually we are providers of social hygiene."
On Perdu de vue on France's
TF1 channel, a young woman
is reunited with her father
after 20 years' separation.

As mediator and healer, television is cur¬
rently trying to get closer to people, as is
shown by the success of the televised charity
appeals known as telethons. Viewers express a
desire for co-operation, solidarity and compas¬
sion merely by switching on their sets. Viewing
becomes a noble deed and ordinary people
become stars. In La nuit des héros, a volunteer,
filmed on location, undergoes various sporting
trials with the audience's encouragement so as
to win 100,000 francs for charity.
Television is already omnipresent. Is it
likely to become omnipotent? How far can the
cameras go in exalting civic virtue and viewers'
generosity without doing harm?
And what about Mea culpa, one of the
newest French reality shows, which has taken
on the noble but perilous task of enabling vic¬
tims to confront their repentant persecutors so
that each side ceases to feel hatred? In one pro¬
gramme, the parents of a little boy called Yann
who had died of Aids met other people from
their village, Grez Neuville, who had rejected
the sick child, thereby causing great suffering to
the family. Now the neighbours came to
confess their error. They went away disap¬
pointed after the programme. "We felt we had
been tricked," the mayoress claimed. "We came
across almost as savages, as scum. Now we're
getting hate mail." The production team of Ber¬
nard Bouthier and Pascal Breugnot has since
made its own mea culpa, recognizing that the
programme had not been adequately prepared.
As for Perdu de vue, they insist that "We're
no substitute for the police or the judiciary. We
do everything with the consent of the people
involved, we don't run the risk of disappoint¬
ing people. If the person we are looking for
does not want to contact his or her relatives, we
give up. And we double-check the information
we receive."
Are reality shows introducing a new kind of
humanitarian activism? The role played by the
emergency relief organization Médecins du
monde in one sequence of Perdu de vue, in
which representatives of the organization act as
a link between viewers and people who are look¬
ing for a job or a place to live, is noteworthy in
this respect. But for every case that is settled,
how many appeals for help go unanswered?
Reality shows have introduced a new type
of television, in which everyday life becomes a
piece of real-life fiction. By voluntarily reveal¬
ing their secrets over the airwaves, anyone can
become a star for as long as the programme is
on the air. Everyman and Everywoman get a
chance to have their day. Viewers listen to what
they have to say sympathetically, because it
often echoes their own experience. Tomorrow
it could be their turn to be in the limelight. D

The cartoon
Animation by Béatrice Cormier-Rodier and
Béatrice Fleury-Vi latte
Japanese
animated
cartoons have
won a
worldwide
market. What is
the secret of
their success?
Above, the intergalactic
robot Grandizer.
THE Japanese animation industry has vast
financial resources. The foundations of its
wealth were laid in the 1950s with the set¬
ting up of production companies whose goal
was to make "the most screen hours for the
least money". Ever since those early days, com¬
panies such as Toei Animation and Tokyo
Movie have had a meticulous and inexpensive
workforce that has enabled them to produce
material at competitive prices.
At the same time a skilful marketing strat¬
egy, working to a model similar to that of the
American market, was established, linking ani¬
mation, advertising and the sale of spin-off pro¬
ducts such as toys, articles of clothing, badges
and books. Specialized boutiques opened up in
Japan's big cities to sell products inspired by
stories and characters from popular cartoons.
Since 1987, the sale of videos of the most suc¬
cessful television series has further boosted the
market.
Television made a big contribution to the
development of mass-market animated cartoon
films. Astro Boy (Tetsuwar Atomu) was the
first series to be broadcast on Japanese televi¬
sion. Inspired by Shonen, a children's maga¬
zine, it told the story of a robot child and his
family who defend peace by fighting the forces
of evil. Produced by Osamu Tezuka and his
firm Mushi Production, it introduced a
"limited-animation" technique that saved
considerable time and money at the price of
slowing down the flow of images a feature of
Japanese cartoons that has since attracted much
criticism. Nonetheless, the success of Astro
Boy, which from the start attracted a 30 per 17

the author of a number of
books including Le choc La
presse des camps de

as articles on the cinema and

BÉATRICE FLEURY-VIIATTE,
of France, is a lecturer in
Information and
Communications at the
University of Nancy-ll. She
contributed to Révoltes-
Révolutions-Cinéma (a
collective work prepared under
the editorship of the historian
Marc Ferro, 1989) and herself
edited a book on the media
and the Gulf War, Médias et
guerre du Golfe (1992).
In the first rush of enthusiasm, Ace, Space
Boy, Man of Steel No. 28, Ken, the Wolf Boy
and Emperor of the Jungle went into produc¬
tion. In February 1963 there were forty-two
weekly cartoon series on Japanese television; in
1965 there were sixty-one. Currently Japanese
television programmes forty-five hours and
forty minutes of animated cartoons per week.
The conquest of Europe in the mid-1970s
was an easy matter. Efficient and profitable, the
Japanese companies met little opposition.
Grandizer (Goldorak) was enormously suc¬
cessful with children. Its hero, an ingenious
adventurer from another world who leaped
onto fantastic machines to help the helpless,
enjoyed a symbiotic relationship with a robot
that could change shape at his command. In
combat, the two became indistinguishable,
forming a single war machine.
Internationalizing form
and content
In addition to science fiction and adventure
series, two new genres were established. There
were sentimental series such as Heidi and
Candy, and series on sporting themes, such as
Olive and Tom, A New Life, and Attack No. 1.
By now Japanese animated cartoons had, to
improve their sales prospects, increasingly to
appeal to viewers of different ethnic and cul¬
tural backgrounds. To universalize the attrac¬
tions of their heroes, the physical characteris¬
tics and lifestyles of the characters were
therefore defined with less precision. In the
1970s, Osamu Tezuka introduced a graphic
style that removed all specifically Oriental cha¬
racteristics from the appearance of the charac¬
ters. Ever since, Japanese animated cartoons
have featured huge-eyed heroes with flowing
manes of blonde or brown hair.
A similar taste for Western characters is also
perceptible in advertising and the cinema, and
has even led some actors to undergo cosmetic
surgery. Some animated cartoons such as Gu
Gu Ganmo carry the attitude to excess by
giving stupid or unpleasant characters Oriental
features. Financial considerations encourage the
process, since the same characters are often
used in more than one film, with little more
than a moustache added or removed, or a
change of hairstyle or clothing.
Heroines may be blonde (as in Candy), red¬
headed like Tony in Reporter's Blues or Julie in
Daddy Longlegs, brunettes as in Julie, I Love
You, or even given flowing blue tresses, as in
Creamy and Sally the Witch. Their eyes are
deep blue or green, and their lifestyle is indis¬
tinguishable from that of young European or
American women. Their behaviour is thereby

neatly adapted to Western standards and so
to the international market without transgres¬
sing Japanese social norms. The Westernization
of cartoon characters thus provides a kind of
cultural alibi, even within Japan itself.
The heroines of these series are often in¬
spired by Western literature. Candy calls Heidi
to mind, Princess Sarah draws on the French
fairy-tale Peau d'âne, Nadia could be Captain
Nemo's daughter and spiritual heir. Some of
the stories even take place abroad: Candy is set
in the United States, Reporter's Blues and
Daddy Longlegs in France. In The Little Chef
characters try out foreign dishes, and the
heroes of Olive and Tom travel to Europe to
meet the local football teams.
Children's favourites
The films' subject-matter is very diverse, draw¬
ing on the world of children everywhere. For
example, the animal citizens of Maple Town in
Maple Town Story, with a family to represent
each species, call to mind children's relation¬
ships with their parents and with each other. In
each episode young viewers are constantly
encouraged to identify with the characters.
These programmes have affinities with such
European productions as Petit Ours brun.
Candy was launched in France in 1979,
opening the way for a succession of altruistic
heroines given to sacrificing themselves for
others. Gorgie, Princesse Saphir, Hello Sandy-
bell and Nadia all draw on familiar and well-
loved children's storylines. Like Candy, the
eponymous heroines of the latter two series are
orphans. The other characters in the cartoons
may be protective or threatening, but they do
not exist outside their relationship with the
heroine.
Each episode follows a set pattern: the
social order is first threatened or disturbed, and
then re-established. The main character always
has a mission helping someone or other, pre¬
venting a wrong or finding the person who
committed it. The other characters are good or
bad insofar as they help or hinder her in the
performance of her duty. Devoted to helping
the weak and promoting the good of society as
a whole, she eventually overcomes all obstacles,
and adventure and suspense, laughter and tears
pave the way to the obligatory happy ending.
Japanese producers have not merely drawn
on the plotlines of children's literature: they
have also adapted many of its greatest suc¬
cesses, including Pinocchio, Les Misérables,
Tom Sawyer, Huckleberry Finn, Alice in Won¬
derland and the French classic Sans famille.
The series are very long and not always faithful
to the original texts, though the decor and his¬
torical reconstruction are normally carefully
researched. These adaptations offer children
not just storylines of the type described above,

but also a chance to rediscover on screen what¬
ever peoples their imagination and increases
their pleasure in life fairies and witches, hand¬
some princes and talking animals.
A SHIFT FROM VIOLENCE
TO HUMOUR
Yet Japanese animated cartoons' can be contro¬
versial, too. From Grandizer to St. Seiya by
way of Masters of the Universe, Dragon Ball 2,
Ken the Great Bear Fist, Captain Harlock and
Bioman, they have been criticized for excessive
violence and limited educational value. It is cer¬
tainly true that they are often violent, not just in
their plots but in their casts of grim-faced
heroes, horned monsters and robots. The effect
is heightened by a style of production involving
fast-changing images, loud sound effects and
aggressive colours and lighting. The violence
was initially all the more shocking for its real¬
ism, which contrasted with the comic aggressi-
vity of Micky Mouse and Tom and Jerry car¬
toons, and it was so gratuitous that it sometimes
even got in the way of plot development.
But although this kind of violence had
considerable viewer appeal until the mid-1980s,
it no longer plays much of a part. Ever since
Grandizer, energy, technology and adventure
20
have taken its place. To different degrees, the
newer cartoons promote the use of technology
to enable humankind to defend the planet
against evil forces. Remorselessly optimistic in
spirit, they invite children to identify with
heroes who are indestructible.
Yet there are also signs of a growing taste
for gentler plotlines. Today's children prefer
comical heroes to the supermen beloved of
their elders. The series shown in France as Un
collège fou, fou, fou was enormously successful
in Japan, perhaps because it gave children the
opportunity to relieve through laughter some
of the anxieties caused by a particularly demand¬
ing educational system. In Nicky Larsen, the
humour is of a different kind, a mixture of
sensuality and clowning. The main character, a
private detective in search of clients, is an anti-
hero whose constant struggles with his own
libido often make him ridiculous.
The vogue for sports series was launched by
Attack No. 1 and Jeanne and Serge. These pro¬
grammes depict sport as more than just a pas¬
time. They glorify assertive individuals, and
also extol group membership in the shape of
team sport.
Sport is depicted as symbolizing confronta¬
tion and combat, testing an individual's tena¬
city and will-power and his capacity to push
himself to the limit. In sport nothing can ever
be taken for granted, and the winner must
always be ready to defend his or her position.
In a sense these series could be said to have
some educational value in preparing children
for life. The lesson they teach is that it is no
longer enough simply to be kind and decent, as
Walt Disney cartoons might suggest. To win a
place in the adult world youngsters must do
more than just pass the tests that arise in child¬
hood. They must be winners, they must know
how to manage their lives, take risks and create
opportunities. They must be fighters and learn
to think like winners. By depicting competition
and glorifying the hero who rises above the
crowd, these series present an image of indivi¬
duals creating themselves in a context of equa¬
lity and justice.
There is nothing wrong with wanting to
encourage children to be winners, but to imply
that this is the only way to find one's bearings
in life and to define one's social identity is more
questionable. In most of these stories the mes¬
sage comes over particularly sharply because
parents tend to be absent, and the children are
responsible for their own lives. The stress on
competition and team spirit blurs the difference
between happiness and social success.
But this view of happiness is not presented
in series like Candy, Nadia and Hello Sandy-
bell, and in the many adaptations of stories that
highlight more altruistic ideals. Japan's output
of animated cartoons is nothing if not diverse,
and this diversity may be its greatest strength. D

A long-term threat
by France Bequette
Thegreenhouse effecthas some points in itsfavour, accord¬
ing to a recent report on the subject from the French
AcademyofSciences. As the reportpoints out, it is thanks
to the greenhouse effect that water exists in liquidform
on the surface of the Earth, a phenomenon which has
helped to make the planet inhabitable. But as Mostafa
Tolba, Executive Director ofthe United Nations Environment
Programme (UNEP), has noted: "During the 300 years of the
industrial and agricultural revolutions, man began to replace
nature as the motor ofclimatic change. " During that period,
concentrations in the atmosphere of some of the so-called
greenhouse gases constantly increased: there was, for example,
a 25 per cent increase in carbon dioxide (0.5 per cent peryear),
and over 50 per cent in methane (0.9 per cent peryear). These
figures may seem insignificant, but while methane remains in
the atmospherefor ten years, it is estimated that carbon dioxide
stays therefor 50 to 200years. We have now inherited a situa¬
tion "which presents a serious enough long-term threat (within
one century) to warrantprevention and adjustment measures
which callforextreme vigilance."Experts on the Earth's atmos¬
phere are warning the insatiable energy-consumers that we are
that we must save energy and press for the development of
renewable energies such as wind and solarpower.

In 1970, 0.64 hectares of arable
land were theoretically available per
inhabitant in the developed coun¬
tries, as opposed to 0.28 in the deve¬
loping world. In 1990, the figure
declined to 0.56 hectares, for the rich
but plunged to 0.20 for the poor. The
reason is that urban areas in the
developing countries will more than
double in size between 1980 and the
end of the century, rising from 8 mil¬
lion to 17 million hectares. Rural
depopulation is also leaving land
fallow.At least 0.60 hectares ofarable
land is necessary to feed one person
using traditional farming methods,
so that these methods are no longer
meeting current needs. One piece
of good news, however, is that bet¬
ween 1970 and 1990, cereal produc¬
tion increased by 15 per cent in deve¬
loping countries and by 32 per cent
in industrialized countries. (Source:
EarthAudit, a document published
in five languages by UNEP in
January, 1992).

TheYanomami Indians ofBrazil havejustbeen granted
94,000 square kilometres ofreserve land an area three
times the size of Belgium following an order signed
last year on 14 November. This brings the total area of
land that has been turned over to the country's 200,000
Indians up to 800,000 square kilometres.
Autumn rains, bird migration, commercial and leisure
fishing, wine and olive cultivation, and forest fires are
among the themes explored by Mediterrania, aweekly

Committee ofUnesco's Man and the Biosphere (MAB)

airs 100 hours a week in Catalan.
Since 1985, Swiss shop-keepers have been required to
take backused batteries, which maynot be thrown away
in garbage dumps. But so far much of the 3,500 tonnes
of batteries the country discards each year has been
dumped in neighbouring countries. A few months ago,
a plant, the first of its kind in Europe, was established to
incinerate 2,000 tonnes of batteries per year, thereby
reducing their mercury, zinc and ferromanganese
content to less than 10 tonnes of vitrifiable slag.
Shareholders in the company that commissioned the
plant include the Swiss Post Office and railways, the city
ofZürich, Migros (a supermarket chain which is closely
involved in environmental protection) and a number
ofprivate businesses.

Although some whaling is autho¬
rized for "scientific research", com¬
mercial whaling is still subject
to a moratorium. Meanwhile, mass
strandings of whales on beaches
continue to occur. One explanation
which is currently being advanced
for this phenomenon is that sonar
equipment used during military
manuuvres may be scrambling
the cetaceans' sonar orientation
capabilities.
The best way to avoid the traffic jams that clog the
world's megacities is to promote the use ofnon-moto¬
rized vehicles. Michael Replogle, a consultant to the
World Bank and the Institute for Transportation and
Development Policy, hopes that governments will take
prompt action on this issue. Asia has more than 400 mil¬
lion bicycle owners, and in India, for instance, 30 to 50
per cent of the vehicles on the main city thoroughfares
are bicycles.
In northern Europe and in the United States, the
number of species of edible and non-edible mush¬
rooms, the total numbers ofmushrooms and the ave¬
rage weight of individual mushrooms are all declining.
Mushrooms are closely linked to trees, with which they
exchange water and mineral salts for glucides (carbo¬
hydrate compounds), and their diminishing numbers
represent a serious threat to forests. The likely culprit
is air pollution, particularly that linked to nitrogen-
based fertilizers.
The adoption in 1977 of Protocol I as an addition to
the 1949 Geneva Conventions resulted from a deter¬
mination to protect the environment in wartime. Article
35 of the Protocol reads that in case of armed conflict,
"It is prohibited, to employ methods or means ofwar¬
fare which are intended, or may be expected to cause
widespread, long-term and severe damage to the
natural environment." Article 55 states that "Care shall
be taken in warfare to protect the natural environment
against widespread, long-term and severe damage

The very word "nuclear" tends
to give people the shivers. It
brings up memories of the
atomic bomb and the tragedy of
Hiroshima. Since 1986, it has
also been associated with the
Chernobyl disaster. Because nuclear
powerwas first used for military pur¬
poses, it was long surrounded by an
atmosphere of secrecy which ham¬
pered communication about its civi¬
lian applications. To counter the
negative image of nuclear energy,
authorities promoted it as "clean",
and were later at a loss when atten¬
tion was drawn to the growing prob¬
lem of nuclear waste. Environ¬
mentalists became extremely
alarmed and stagedviolent demon¬
strations whenever the construction
of a nuclear plant was announced.
Despite their protests, 530 plants
have been built worldwide, 112 in
the United States, 57 in France and
46 in the former Soviet Union (the
planet's three most "nuclear" coun¬
tries). In addition, 84 more plants
are under construction or at the
planning stage and 17 have been
ordered. It is therefore important to
know whether this type ofenergy is
compatible with the quality of life
we expect from the future.
Energy generation and consump¬
tion have become indicators of de¬
velopment and symbols ofprosperity.
In order to run factories and cars,
and to light and heat houses, we have
coal, gas and oil, the so-called non¬
renewable fossil fuels. Dams are used
to produce hydro-electricity. The
use of firewood to produce energy
has practically disappeared, except
in the poorest countries.
According to figures provided
by the French Atomic Energy
Commission, humankind is thought
to have used 350 billion tonnes of
coal equivalent between 1850 and
1970. Taking into account the
constant increase in consumption,
projections indicate that coal reserves
are sufficient for another 300 years.
The projections for natural gas and oil
are shorter a mere 50 years. To get
an idea ofour appetite for energy, it
is instructive to consider that, if
energy consumed by humankind
during the Roman empire is repre
sented by a factor of 1 , the equivalent
figure for the early 1 800s would be 3;
today it would be 500. And demand
is constantly increasing. In France,
for instance, about 1 1 million fami¬
lies own one car, and more than 4.5
million have two or more.
After the two "oil shocks" of 1973
and 1979, there was a noticeable
but short-lived reduction in energy
demand. According to a recent report
on the greenhouse effect and its cli¬
matic consequences produced by
the French Academy of Sciences,
"Since the turn of the century, world
economic activity has increased
twentyfold. Industrial production
has increased 50 times and the
consumption of fossil fuels by30	
The expected doubling of world
population in the next 50 years
should have a much higher multi¬
plier effect on economic activity.
World production will have to
increase between five and ten times
to meet the legitimate needs and
aspirations of the Earth's 10 billion
inhabitants. This might seem to be
economic expansion on a colossal
scale and indeed it is. Yet it is
nothing more than the expression of
a continuing annual economic
growth rate of 3.2 to 4.7 per cent,
which is barely enough to reduce the
level ofpoverty in the ThirdWorld."
Energy production often involves
a breakdown of matter, emitting
potentially toxic gases or producing
solid wastes. Ever since the scien¬
tific community began to study the
greenhouse effect, combustion pro¬
ducing carbon dioxide (CO2) has
been under attack. The CO2 emitted
into the atmosphere absorbs solar
radiation and traps it, like the win¬
dows of a greenhouse, increasing
the surface temperature ofthe Earth.
CO2 is not the only greenhouse gas.
Methane, low altitude ozone,
nitrogen oxides (NOx), sulphur
dioxide (SO2) and chlorofluorocar-
bons (CFCs) all contribute to the
greenhouse effect. The consequence
of the greenhouse effect, according
to the United Nations Environment
Programme (UNEP), could be a 1.5°
to 4°C rise in the temperature of the
planet, leading to climatic changes
and higher ocean levels.

plant in California
(U.S.A.).
One way ofcombatting the green¬
house effect is to reduce fossil fuel
combustion. This is an important
point in the case made by defenders
ofnuclear energy. They claim that, at
least from a strictly environmental
point ofview, a nuclear plant is clean,
in the sense that it emits no green¬
house gases. The French electric uti¬
lity, Électricité de France, points out
that "Since 1980, whereas electricity
consumption increased by 50 per
cent, the substitution of nuclear
energy for coal and fuel has made it
possible to reduce CO2 emissions by
40 per cent, NOx emissions by 75 per
cent and SO2 emissions by 70 per
cent". The French Academy of
Sciences quotes a May 1990 report
published by the Intergovernmental
Panel on Climate Change establi¬
shed by the World Meteorological
Organization (WMO) and UNEP,
which states that greenhouse-gas
emissions would have to be reduced
by at least 50 per cent to stabilize
atmospheric concentrations at their
1985 levels. In principle, this is pos¬
sible: "Ifall the industrialized coun¬
tries (OECD and East-European
countries) had the same energy effi¬
ciency rate (Gross Domestic
Product/ final energy consumption)
and the same proportion of nuclear
power in their energy production
mix as France, global CO2 emissions
would be less than 40 per cent of
what they are today." In tonnes of
carbon consumed per inhabitant per
year, comparative emissions for the
following countries or regions are:

Kingdom, 2.8; Germany, 3.2; Eastern

Europe, close to 4; United States,

Does this mean that the "all
nuclear" energy option should be
promoted? Although this is some¬
times recommended, as a solution
"it would run up against obstacles
both financial (because of the capital
intensive nature of electricity pro¬
duced bynuclear power), and socio¬
political: reservations about nuclear
energy have not disappeared, and
the considerable impact of the
Chernobyl accident invites caution."
The Swedish example is signifi¬
cant here. Sweden's 12 nuclear
plants provided 45.9 per cent of the
country's electricity in 1990, and 51.6
per cent in 1991. In 1980, after a
referendum, the Swedish parliament
declared a moratorium, underwhich
all plants would be phased out
within 30 years, that is, by 2010.
When the first two groups of plants
are closed, the country will have an
energy shortfall of three billion KwH,
and energy conservation will not be
to make up the difference. By the
time all the plants are closed, the
figure will be 66 billion KwH. Noted
for their respect for the environment,
the Swedes only accept natural gas
and hydro-electric power, and even
here problems arise because public
opinion opposes the construction
of dams on the last important uns¬
poiled sites. Natural gas combustion
emits CO2 and methane.
Switzerland provides another illus¬
tration of the dilemma. Engineers
proposing to dig out a second
conduit for the Grande Dixence dam
in the Valais canton are being
opposed by representatives of the
Worldwide Fund for Nature (WWF),
who are worried about what will
happen to the mass of rocks ex¬
tracted from the hole.
The problem of waste
So, is nuclear power the answer?
It's not that simple. For one thing,
various public and private organi¬
zations have found that radioacti¬
vity around nuclear plants has
increased, officially by 1 per cent.
Furthermore, environmentalists
claim that there has been a radioac¬
tive build-up in the food chain from
plankton to big fish due to the liquid
emissions from nuclear plants.
Furthermore, the transportation of
uranium ore and its transformation
into fuel are risky.
The most serious question raised,
however, has to do with nuclear
wastes. These are of three kinds.
TypeA, ofconsiderable volume but
only mildly radioactive, includes the
gloves and the lab-coats of plant,

hospital and laboratory employees,
filters, mud and tools. It is "short¬
lived", which means it must be
monitored for 300 years. Type B is
material contaminated through
contact with nuclear fuel. It will be
radioactive for some 10,000 to 20,000
years. Type C is the most dangerous;
it includes material such as nep¬
tunium, which remains radioactive
for a million years.
What should be done with nuclear
waste? According to geologist Claude
Guillemin, a correponding member
of the French Academy of Sciences,
type A waste does not present any
problem: "We geologists work in the
very long term and feel we must take
responsibility for the distant future.
Soulaines (in the Aube department
in France) is an ideal spot. A land¬
locked island, it is isolated, observed
and protected, and sits on a sub¬
stratum we know well." Waste is
sealed in containers made of metal
or concrete that are carefully inven¬
toried. According to Armand
Foussat, executive director of the
Agence nationale française pour la
gestion des déchets radioactifs,
France's agency for radioactive waste
management, the United States,
Mexico, Japan, Korea, Taiwan and
Spain have all adopted this model.
Type B wastes can be treated in the
same way as those of type A, once the
most dangerous elements have been
removed.
The real problem lies with the
third category. "The radioactivity of
wastes of type C is Dantesque,"
continues Claude Guillemin.
"Should we stock them in the ocean
sediments? If we did, there would
be a risk that they would re-emerge,
still very radioactive, through under¬
water fissures or volcanoes. Should
we send them into orbit around the
Sun? If we did there would be the
risk of an accident. Why not store
them temporarilyon the Earth's sur¬
face in "super Soulaines" for at least
a hundred years. Thatwould leave us
time to increase our knowledge of
the respective qualities of granite,
clay, salt or schist before thinking of
burying them deep underground."
Promoting one kind of energy
rather than another involves making
choices about the kind ofsocietywe
want to live in. In the meantime we
can make a start by conserving as
much energy as we can.

rXTER will be one of the most
divisive environmental
and political issues of the
next fifteen ortwentyyears.
The conflicts of the past
over land and oil will seem
minor in comparison to those over
water. Conflict-resolution abilities
will be as important as hydrology
and engineering for ensuring future
water supplies.
The Middle East is one place
where problems could appear, along
with northern Africa from Morocco
to Egypt. Though water consump¬
tion generally is lower than available
supply, the scales could tip the other
way. Over the past ten years, drought
has diminished the supply of the
Nile, for instance, while consump¬
tion rates in Egypt have risen. And
the Nile is not exclusively the pro¬
vince of Egypt; other countries too
will be seeking a share of its water.
Turkey and Iraq are arguing over
rights to the waters ofthe Euphrates;
Mexico and the United States have
litigated over the waters of the
Colorado; Bangladesh is at the
mouth of the Ganges, but has no
control over activities upriver in
other countries.
The humid tropics are another
area where water is a problem; the
word "humid" should not be mis¬
construed as implying limitless sup¬
plies ofwater. In some areas there is
not enough rainfall to provide good
vegetation cover for the prevention
of erosion. Soil erosion can claim
over 100 tonnes of soil per hectare,
and this is soil which is produced at
a rate of only about one tonne per
hectare per year. Land is being lost
also to salinization, waterlogging and
compaction, which are reducing
productivity just as population
increases require the opposite.
Population growth is a very serious
problem. Most ofitwill occur in the
developing world: Africa, Latin
America, South Asia and East Asia.
Urbanization problems are a conse¬
quence: the urban population in
these regions has already tripled
from 507 million in 1965 to 1.5 billion
in 1990, and it is expected to rise to
2.2 billion by the year 2000. It is
hardly surprising that land, air and
water resources in the burgeoning
metropolitan areas are stretched to
their limits.
Cities without safe water
Urbanization and population
growth are having serious repercus¬
sions on health. Notwithstanding
major investments in water supply
and sanitation systems, an estimated
40,000 children die daily (almost 15
million peryear) as a result ofwater-
related diseases. Over a third of those
are deaths of children under five.
Ten years ago three-quarters of
the urban communities in develop¬
ing countries lacked adequate,
healthywater supplies. Today, with
population growth and the increased
concentration ofpeople in cities, the
situation has not improved. Water
supplies in many rural areas are also
unhealthy.
The single most water-consuming
human activity is agriculture. With a
few exceptions, as in Israel, where
new technologies are used, irriga¬
tion, essential to the great advances
in agricultural productivity, is
wasteful. Much of the water evapo¬
rates, especially in the warm, dry cli¬
mates where irrigation is most
needed. Some estimates suggest that
70 per cent of total water use, and 90
per cent ofirretrievable consumptive
use of water, is due to irrigation.
Worldwide, the amount of irrigated
land has grown fivefold in the course
of the present century, from 47.3
million hectares in 1900 to 272 mil¬
lion in 1990. Not infrequently,
would-be agricultural users ofwater
and city-dwellers in need of drink¬
ing water and sanitation systems
find themselves in direct conflict
over available supplies.

T
becoming understood is ground¬
water, usually quite sweet water
stored in underground aquifers. In
recent years there has been increas¬
ing alarm at the extent to which
these invisible reservoirs, traditio¬
nally deemed "safe" from pollution,
have been invaded byheavy metals
and toxins, and by agricultural
chemicals seeping down from the
Earth's surface. In Europe, the first
aquifer layer, lying under many of
the continent's countries, is almost
entirely polluted, most of it by pol¬
lutants in general agricultural che¬
micals. A major aquifer in North
America, the Ogalala, is also being
contaminated.
Water, weather and
climate
Despite considerable progress in
understandingwater and hydrology,
clearlymuch more needs to be done.
Unesco's International Hydrological
Programme has been dealing with
these problems for twenty-five years.
The present preoccupation is how
to establish intelligentwater-resource
strategies for sustainable develop¬
ment, as water is clearly the limiting
factor. No longer will it be sufficient
for engineers and hydrologists merely
to identify, and then build systems to
tap water supplies for human use.
At this point we lack some very
important data specifically on water
and hydrological cycles.
While in many countries there is
good hydrological monitoring, in
others there is less. In Africa today,
where population growth and water-
resource needs seem to be on a col¬
lision course, there is no effective
continent-wide, co-ordinated and
reliably working hydrological net¬
work. Beyond local or regional
hydrology, we now know that cli¬
mate andweather are intricately tied
to water- and land-use patterns and
to human activity. Yet there is no
global network to consider the inter¬
relationships between the hydrolo
gical cycle, oceans, weather and
climate.
Like other environmental issues,
water is onlyone strand in a complex
web, neither understandable nor
manageable in isolation from the
other strands. More hydrologists,
engineers and pollution-control spe¬
cialists are called for. More under¬
standing of the inter-environmental
issues is required, but just as impor¬
tant will be an understanding of the
human dimension culture, history,
settlement patterns, economics.
Dealing with water will also require
rare political co-operation among a
wide range of groups, nations,
regions and continents. This will take
great skill and great sensitivity. And
above all there must be a strong
awareness of the unity of the planet
and the interrrelationship of the
destinies of those who live on it.

m
The Pygmies, hunter-gatherers dispersed through the
African equatorial forest from the Atlantic Ocean to
the great lakes, are notable not only for their small
stature but also for the extraordinary way in which
they have adapted to forest life. The forest is a prodigal
and benevolent tutelary deity which, in return for the
performance of a small number of magic rituals,
guarantees their day-to-day survival in conditions of
relative abundance.
In their study on the religions of black Africa,* L.V.
Thomas and R. Luneau write that "Whenever he sees a
rainbow, which is a symbol of the divinity, any
Pygmy or the chief speaking for the whole group if
they are gathered together must stop whatever he is
doing and stand facing it. He draws his bow to resemble
the rainbow, but in such a way as almost to hide it from
view. He then sings, or rather chants in a monotone
and, except at the end, almost on a single note, the
celebrated Rainbow Song. "
* Les religions d'Afrique noire (Fayard-Denoël publishers, Paris, 1969)
The Pygmies' Rainbow Song appears in an anthology entitled Compagnons du
Soleil ("Companions of the Sun") which is to be co-published (in French) by Unesco
Editions de la Découverte (Paris) and the Fondation pour le progrès de l'Homme. The
anthology has been prepared under the general editorship ofthe African historian
Joseph Ki-Zerbo, in collaboration with Marie-Josephe Beaud.
Khwa, yé, oh! Khwa! Rainbow, oh Rainbow!
Shining up there, so high,
Above theforest so wide,
In the midst ofblack clouds,
Splitting the dark sky,
You have cast down beneath you,
Victorious in the struggle,
The rumbling thunder
That rumbled so loud,
Angry, was it with us?
In the midst ofblack clouds
Splitting the dark sky,
Like a knife rotten fruit,
Rainbow, oh Rainbow.
Now he hasfledfrom you,
The Thunder, the Man-killer,
Like the deerfrom the panther,
Now he has taken flight.
Rainbow, oh Rainbow,
Strong bow of the hunter on high,
Who chases the cloud-herds,
Like herds ofscared elephants,
Rainbow, thank himfor us,
Tell him, Do not be angry.
Tell him, Do not be wroth.
Tell him not to kill us.
For we are very scared.
Rainbow, tell him that.

Fiction
Fiction notably in series or
serial formis the world's most
popular type of television. The
international market for TV
fiction was long dominated by
productions from North
America, but today other
countries are making their own
programmes, often taking the
form of family sagas or social
dramas which are winning a
wide following.
THE outbreak of the Second "World War
set back the emergence of television in
the United States as it did elsewhere. The
new medium did not really take off until 1946.
It then developed so fast that it was soon seen
as a threat by film production companies,
already unsettled by the 1949 antitrust law that
prohibited the Hollywood studios from com¬
bining the production, distribution and exploi¬
tation functions.
In 1953, some studios launched a counter-
offensive based on technological developments
such as CinemaScope, 3-D, Cinerama and ste¬
reophonic sound, as well as on superproduc¬
tions with huge sets, spectacular special effects
and casts of thousands. This was a clever strat¬
egy, for television with its tiny black and white
screen hardly seemed capable of competing
with wide-screen epics like Ben Hur, El Cid,
Spartacus or The Alamo. It was also short¬
lived, however, for such productions were by
their nature exceptional. Besides, the studios'
position was ambivalent: while setting them¬
selves up as rivals of television, they were also
signing agreements with intermediary organi-

zations and with the TV channels themselves to
produce programmes, sell film rights and hire
out equipment.
Radio days
Television started with one great advantage: the
three national channels (ABC, CBS and NBC)
were already established across North America.
They had run radio stations since the 1920s,
and each had a privileged relationship with its
financial backers. A fourth channel, DuMont,
stopped broadcasting in 1956 because it failed
to ensure equivalent technical, financial and
commercial support.

presents the game-show You
Bet Your Life on America's

show, which began in 1947
as a radio programme,

ran until 1961.

Building on their broadcasting experience,
the three national channels immediately carved
out a sizeable audience for themselves. The
1930s had been the decade of radio. Received in
every home, the comedies, dramas, serials,
game and variety shows that made up the bulk
of its repertoire had an enthusiastic following.
Naturally enough, most television programmes
started life as adaptations of popular radio

sion was like in the 1940s and 1950s, because
virtually all programmes went out live and few
were recorded. Most of the recordings have
subsequently been lost or else have deterio¬
rated. Nonetheless, the vitality and creativity of
the young medium were never in doubt. Nor
was there much argument about the quality of
the programmes, in particular the prestigious
drama series featuring material written by
authors such as Gore Vidal and Rod Sterling
and directed by the likes of John Franken-
heimer and George Roy Hill who once
recreated the sinking of the Titanic live with
700 actors and thirty-five sets.
The film industry soon began to hire televi¬
sion directors both to make original films and
to adapt small-screen successes for the cinema.
Some of these films became classics. They
included Robert Mulligan's Baby the Rain
Must Fall, John Cassavetes' A Child is Waiting,
Martin Ritt's Edge of the City, Arthur Penn's
The Left-handed Gun and The Miracle
Worker, Delbert Mann's Marty, Ralph
Nelson's Requiem for a Heavyweight and
Sidney Lumet's Twelve Angry Men.
Noted film directors such as Tom Gries,
Arthur Hiller, Sam Peckinpah, Sydney Pollack
and Steven Spielberg started their careers in
television. Other directors with established
reputations in the cinema followed the example
set by many film actors and went to work in
television. Veterans like John Ford, Robert
Siodmak and Alfred Hitchcock (who even had
his own programme), as well as younger film¬
makers like Blake Edwards, Samuel Fuller,
Robert Parrish and Don Siegel, all worked for
the new medium.
This movement between television and the
cinema was encouraged by the dropping of live
shows in favour of taped ones and by the
development of recording on film. Television
drama, a hybrid between radio drama and stage
plays that was the high spot of what is now
often called American television's golden age,
gave way gradually to a new genre, the series,
which in many ways recalled the old B-movies,
employing low budgets, limited shooting times
and formula plotting.

ments. Most episodes last for thirty or sixty
minutes, but some may stretch to ninety
minutes, including advertising breaks. Some
series have featured the same characters week in
week out. Others, including such celebrated
examples as Alfred Hitchcock Presents, Police
Story and The Twilight Zone, have an entirely
new cast each time, while conserving a consis¬
tent tone and narrative style, generally set by
the personality of the presenter.
For years TV, like the cinema, went in for a
wide range of genres. There were spy series,
detective stories, comedy, adventure, war,
science fiction, the supernatural, westerns. In
the past decade, however, the range has nar¬
rowed, and the dominant genres today are
police and crime shows and comedy usually
domestic situation comedies featuring typical
American families.
One reason why the series formula became
so popular is that it could be easily scheduled
into strategic time-slots. A weekly series, with
the same characters reappearing at the same time
in similarly structured adventures, could attract

a faithful audience and keep advertisers happy.
But the limitations of the format nonetheless
soon became apparent, and the networks, which
were no longer able to make do with the back-
lists of the old Hollywood studios, began to
finance "telefeatures" with the encouragement
of the film companies themselves. In 1964 Uni¬
versal became the first studio to produce tele¬
films with David Lowell Rich's See How They
Run and two films by Don Siegel, The Hanged
Man and The Killers (the latter of which was
finally adjudged too violent for television and
was released in cinemas instead).
Some telefilms are self-contained stories;
others are "pilots", intended to be the first, fea¬
ture-length episodes of series that only go into
production if audience response is favourable.
Like the series, they work B-movie territory.
At first they too used a broad range of material,
but soon confined themselves to a limited
number of subjects.
At present there are basically three types of
telefilm: police or crime stories, drama, and
remakes of classic films. The large number of
crime films can partly be explained by the suc¬
cess of "cop movies" in the cinema, where they
are virtually the only kind of film to have sur¬
vived the disappearance of the Hollywood
giants. Moreover, the dimensions and technical
characteristics of the television screen, as well
as TV's association with news and reporting,
give such a sheen of realism to crime stories
that many telefilms opt for a documentary
format, which they often accentuate by recons¬
tructing authentic cases in detail. In this res¬
pect, the productions are very different from
their equivalent in the cinema, which for the
past decade have tended to be overreliant on
spectacular action sequences.
The would-be-documentary style is also
used in the most interesting and original kind
of television films, those which tackle social
themes and are often referred to as "docu-
dramas" or drama documentaries. These films
highlight social problems such as unemploy¬
ment, pollution, homosexuality, sexism, racism, 31

suicide, drug addiction, prostitution, incurable
disease, divorce, loneliness, delinquency, justice
and education. Some of them are based on real-
life events, whose implications are skilfully
explored with the aid of fictional techniques.
The fictional element creates an emotional
interest, prevents the films from becoming disa¬
greeably didactic and helps increase awareness
of issues the public may have been genuinely
unconscious of or pretended to ignore. In a
modest way, television today acts as a provider
of information and civic education and has
adopted a similar role to that played by the
cinema during the Great Depression of the
1930s, in the 1940s and 1950s in the wake of the
Second World War, and in the 1960s and 1970s
at the time of the protest movements a role
which it now seems to have abandoned in
favour of spectacular entertainment.
The third type of telefilm is less original
than the other two. Just as cinema, for want of
good scripts, has for the past ten years or more
gone in for remakes, so television has been
content to recycle big-screen classics without
being able to equal them in quality, as the new
versions of The Best Years of Our Lives, The
Letter, Operation Petticoat, The Red Badge of
Courage and Winchester '73 testify. Freed from
the time constraints of the cinema, television
has also adapted works of literature that have
already been filmed, such as From Here to
Eternity and East of Eden, and has produced
screen versions of best-sellers by writers
including James Clavell, Arthur Hailey, James
Michener, Harold Robbins, Irwin Shaw,
Sydney Sheldon and Herman Wouk. Because
of their length, these dramatizations are shown
in a number of episodes as mini-series, which
run from four to twenty-six hours. The plot¬
ting is often weak and confused.
Mini-series constitute a further link with
American television's roots in radio, which is
also the original source of the "soap operas",
melodramatic serials that owe their name to the
fact that they were initially sponsored by the
major soap and detergent manufacturers. Most
are shot from day to day with. three video
cameras in a few fixed sets, as they were in
Sydney Pollack's parody Tootsie. They are
intended primarily for internal consumption
and few of them are exported.
On the other hand, more expensive and ela¬
borate productions such Dallas, Santa Barbara
and West Coast have attracted a vast audience
worldwide. Week after week, the same stereo¬
typed characters, moved by simple emotions,
become involved in situations full of conflict and
drama. The formula is always the same: at the
end of each episode the cast is enmeshed in ten¬
sions that are resolved the following week. In this
respect, soap operas have some affinities with the
serialized novels that were popular in nineteenth-
century Europe, whose contemporary equiva¬
lents they in many ways seem to be. O

Egypt: a national ession
by Samir Gharib
Above, watching a television
serial in an Aswan butcher's
shop.
HERE in Egypt television has a powerful
hold over people's minds. It is an ins¬
trument of leisure, of information
and to a very limited extent of culture. It
does not stop people reading newspapers or
books, going to the cinema or theatre or watch¬
ing videos. But these activities are occasional,
irregular and ultimately of secondary impor¬
tance, while television is a permanent and ubi¬
quitous fixture.
There must be a number of interrelated rea
sons for such an ascendancy, with economic,
political and cultural factors all coming into
play. But no-one has tried to analyse these rea¬
sons rigorously, using statistical data and
making comparisons with other societies similar
to our own. Maybe people prefer not to know.
What is certain, however, is that television is one
of the main subjects of conversation, at school,
in offices, at home and in the street, as well as
being written about in all the newspapers.
No serious study has been made of the 33

influence this strange despot exercises in
Egypt or, to be more precise, of the whole
bundle of contradictory effects it has on people
of different age groups, social classes and cul¬
tural backgrounds. An opportunity to appre¬
ciate the diversity of attitudes television ins¬
pires arose recently when a girl was raped in
public in one of Cairo's most crowded squares.
This unprecedented event provoked a spate of
comments on the role of television, ranging
from the widely-held view that the media are
responsible for such acts of licence to passio¬
nate vindications of the media on the grounds
that they perform an essential role in revealing
the undercurrents of society.
Television is doubtless at one and the same
time cause and effect, both a reflection and an
accelerator of the erratic behaviour patterns of
a fragmented and rapidly changing society
which, like so many in the Third World today,
is in need of fixed landmarks. If in this context
television sometimes seems like a rudderless
ship, it is because society itself has no driving
force capable of steering it in a definite direc¬
tion or of giving it a coherent orientation.
Serials that bring a nation
to a standstill
It might be said that the fundamental objective
of television is to persuade the maximum
number of people to watch it for the maximum
amount of time. And how effectively serials and
series do that! I do not think that I have ever
seen any other country so totally dominated by
these shows, some, it is true, Egyptian-made
but the majority American. Each episode, each
programme, is a talking-point for everyone,
young and old alike.
34
Do American soap operas arouse the same
enthusiasm when they are shown in Europe? I
think not, and for a reason that seems obvious
to me. In Europe it is possible to meet people
like those who appear on the screen. Their life¬
styles and the social roles they play are easily
imaginable in the West. In Egypt, however,
they are inconceivable, and that explains their
immense success. They take us out of ourselves.
There is a paradox here. American series
and soap operas are full of images and attitudes
that no Egyptian production would dare to
present for it would be immediately censored
if it did. Why should something be permissible
in an American production that is illicit in an
Egyptian one? It is not for nothing that I spoke
earlier of a rudderless ship.
Many Egyptian women take American small-
screen heroines as their models, imitating their
style of dressing, talking and even thinking. As a
result, relatively little-known actresses can
become veritable idols here. A lady named Dona
Miles received a welcome at the Cairo film
festival in December 1991 that was substantially
warmer than that accorded to much better-
known film stars.
This is not surprising in Egypt, where an
extraordinary ritual takes place when it is time
for a serial to begin. All the members of the
family stop whatever they have been doing and
sit glued to the screen. This ritual is not confined
to those with time on their hands. If you want to
leave the free-trade zone in Port Said while a
serial is on, then forget it. You won't be able to
get through customs until the end of the episode.
Last year the studio of a well-known
painter, Mustapha Al-Razaz, burned to the
ground, and all his paintings and his library
were reduced to ashes. No-one thought of
going to his aid. The fire had started one eve¬
ning in Ramadan, just at the moment when a
popular serial was beginning.
The nights of Ramadan
I should explain that Ramadan, the month of
fasting, is the one above all others in which
television reigns supreme. This is partly
because people have more time on their hands
than during the rest of the year, but also
because cinemas and theatres close down and
other public cultural activities come to a halt.
During Ramadan people go on a kind of televi¬
sion binge. Besides the normal shows, special
serials running from the first to the last day of
the month are produced each year and are
eagerly awaited by millions of viewers. The

stories may be modern or adaptations from
The Thousand and One Nights.
Above all, there are the immensely popular
game-shows (fawazir), featuring singing and
dancing, which are forbidden in nightclubs and
theatres during Ramadan. The game-shows are
sponsored by firms that offer substantial prizes
to winning contestants, but their main purpose
is to provide a small-screen platform for the
stars of show business. Many still remember
the appearances of Nelly and Sherihan, who
during Ramadan staged on television the shows
they were not allowed to produce in the
theatre.
At other times of the year serials are the
main dish in the daily television diet. The two
principal channels each show two serials, one
Egyptian, the other foreign. They have become
part of the Egyptian way of life, familiar fea¬
tures of every Egyptian's landscape. If you are
arranging to meet someone, for example, you
might decide to do so "after the Arabic serial."
Your interlocutor will understand.
In the course of the year about twenty
serials are broadcast, each running for an ave¬
rage of ten forty-five-minute episodes. That
means that the leading actors are on screen for
almost eight hours. Some, of course, continue
for much longer than that. Layali al-Helmiya
has already notched up more than 100 episodes
and is not yet finished. The heroes of this serial
have so far appeared for more than seventy-five
hours on screen in a show whose unprece¬
dented success can no doubt be explained by
the fact that it is a historical chronicle covering
the last four decades in Egypt and features
characters and situations with which everyone
can identify (see page 36).
Ra'afat El Haggan, based on a novel by
Saleh Morsi, has also been exceptionally durable.
Its hero is an Egyptian secret agent, and its
success draws both on American espionage
films and on Egyptian patriotic sentiment.
Most of the serials, however, deal with
social problems. In fact all the arts, including
cinema and theatre as well as television, have
for some years past tended to focus on social
and political matters. This widespread pheno¬
menon reflects a new state of mind. What is
involved is not, strictly speaking, social criti¬
cism in the sense of an analysis of past or pre¬
sent failings suggesting future solutions. Rather
the programmes fix viewers' attention on situa¬
tions with which they can easily identify but
whose interest is purely anecdotal. As such,
they are deliberately kept from being anything
more than entertainment without instructional
value. What a pity! EJ 35

Layali al-Helmiya
or Dallas-on-the-Nile
M AYAU al-Helmiya ("Al-Helmiya Nights")
J is Egypt's most popular serial. Set in a
UM working-class district of Cairo, it takes
place against a backdrop of the events that have
marked the nation's history over the past half-
century. The main character is a "pasha" or aris¬
tocrat called Selim El-Badry, who is married to
a greedy and overbearing society belle named
Nazek Hanem. Tired of her caprices, he falls in
love with a local girl, whom he decides to take as
his second wife. Enraged, Nazek Hanem
demands a divorce and sets out to get her own
back.
Her revenge is to marry Soliman Ghanem, a
self-made omda (village mayor) who is the
pasha's rival. Although she despises Ghanem,
she bears him a daughter, Zohra. Meanwhile
the pasha's young wife dies while giving birth
to a son, Ali. Nazek Hanem at once leaves the
omda and goes back to Selim. She packs her
daughter, an unpleasant reminder of her second
marriage, off to an orphanage.
All this takes place at the time of the anti-
colonial struggle, and among the various other
characters involved is a revolutionary patriot,
Taha Samahi, who in spite of his convictions is
obliged to marry a girl of his own social class.
The couple have a son, Nagui. Soon after, Taha
is killed in a demonstration. Nagui is brought
up by his mother and becomes a magistrate of
integrity and a man of principle like his father.
The pace of events quickens with the
coming to power of Nasser, who imposes
socialism on the country and nationalizes
industries and the fortunes of the rich. Nazek
Hanem divorces Selim once more, and he then
marries a princess from the entourage of ex-
King Farouk. Fleeing the country, he sets up
house in Paris with his new wife, leaving his
son Ali, now grown up, to finish his studies at
the Polytechnic in Cairo. Unlike his father, Ali
is a fervent revolutionary and is imprisoned
several times for his views. Meanwhile Zohra
has been reunited with her father, the omda
Soliman Ghanem, and is now a journalist. She
shares a romantic idyll with Ali, but then settles
for security by secretly marrying the editor-in-
chief of her newspaper.
The military defeat of 1967 rocks Egyptian
society and leaves a mood of bitterness that
endures until the moral victory of 1973 restores
the nation's optimism. These events are
reflected in the lives of the people of al-Hel¬
miya. Zohra gets a divorce. Selim, the former
pasha, comes back to Egypt, encouraged by
Sadat's "open-door" policy. He builds an
industrial and financial empire, but his marriage
to Nourhan is on the rocks. His son Ali, faced
with the ruin of his political and romantic
hopes, also devotes himself to the pursuit of
money and power.
Meanwhile the omda has been investing in
new markets and, at the age of sixty, has
secretly married a young servant. She turns out
to be only interested in his money and he soon
repudiates her. Nazek Hanem is as scheming as
ever and continues to get what she wants,
taking to corruption quite as enthusiastically as
her new husband, Mazen, the unscrupulous
owner of a large hospital complex. Zohra,
returning from Paris where she had gone to
forget the failure of her marriage, becomes an
accomplished business woman and attempts to
win back Ali.
The assassination of Sadat brings an end to
an era marked by the growth of the black
market, currency speculation and the malversa¬
tion of public funds. The Mubarak years that
follow witness the triumph of industrialization
and construction.
Layali al-Helmiya has an eventful future
ahead of it.

India: TV at the crossroads
Fiction
by Aruna Vasudev and
L.K. Malhatra
Above, a family watches
television in the Punjab.
WHEN the decision to introduce televi¬
sion to India was taken in 1958, there
were many who questioned it. Can
we afford it? asked some. Why have television
when we don't have enough food, clothing and
shelter? Television will degenerate into enter¬
tainment and we can do without that, said the
puritans. Who will watch television? others
asked. If, as intended, it is going to be purely
educational, then those who can afford a set
won't watch and those for whom it is designed
will not have access to it.
Despite the controversy, television broad¬
casting began in 1959. It was a modest begin¬
ning there was one little studio, from which
an hour of programmes was transmitted twice a
week. There were farm programmes for rural
audiences, folk dancing and music, pro¬
grammes of practical interest to women, the
occasional short play telecast live. It was all
very basic and simple and so it remained for
several years. Gradually the hours of transmis¬
sion were increased, but technical improve¬
ments were very slow in coming. The problem
was that television was treated by the govern¬
ment as an extension of radio, which had been
well established for decades. For a long time it
was conceived of as sound accompanied by ele¬
mentary black and white pictures. One deci¬
sion stood unchanged through all the years:
there would be no imported programmes, we
would consume our own images. 37

The transformation came in 1982, when the
Asian Games were held in Delhi. The then
Minister for Information and Broadcasting,
Vasant Sathe, was determined that the coverage
of the games should be of international quality.
A crash training programme was launched for
technicians, and the major decision was made
to shift to colour. Controversy erupted again.
Why should we spend so much on colour? It
was pandering to pressure from urban televi¬
sion owners who wanted entertainment. What
about education? the purists asked. Sport is
educational, came the reply. The same ques¬
tions that had been heard twenty years before
were asked again. But the situation had
changed, economically and technically. Values
too had changed.
The arguments for and against colour con¬
tinued for many months. Educational transmis¬
sions had been started in the afternoons, mainly
of science programmes for children. These, said
the authorities, would be much more effective
in colour, easier to understand and a more
attractive proposition for young viewers.
Audiences were accustomed to colour because
of the cinema. Technocrats and many media
commentators also felt that it was time we
caught up with advancing technology. Black
and white was being phased out all over the
world. Agreements were made with Japan,
Korea and Germany for thousands of TV sets
to be supplied in time for the Asian Games, and
import restrictions were lifted for a specific
period to enable people to bring colour televi¬
sion sets into the country. Colour television
sets poured in.
Family entertainment
Another development was taking place simul¬
taneously. The Minister had been struck by the
use Mexico had made of soap operas to spread
developmental messages, and a team of experts
was sent there to find out why this operation
had been so successful. Following the Mexican
trip, the idea for a soap opera called Hum Log
("People like Us") was developed in collabora¬
tion with a well-known writer named Manohar
Sham Joshi and a little-known feature film
director, P. Kumar Vasudev. Starting from the
romantic yearnings of a modest young man
from a poor family for the beautiful and spoilt
daughter of a wealthy widower, it turned into
the epic story of two families, with sub-plots
involving brothers and sisters, aunts, uncles and
grandparents. The young man ends up working
for the girl's father who, it turns out later, is a
big-time smuggler. The daughter marries a
prince of doubtful antecedents who is later
involved in getting her father murdered. The
prince is finally unmasked and killed. Through¬
out the story, the young man's devotion does
not waver.
Floods of letters poured in, those asking
when the two would marry outnumbering
those expressing disapproval of such a union.
The serial ended two years and 159 episodes
after it had begun. Whether or not the two
would come together remained an open ques¬
tion, perhaps in a gesture to conservative opin¬
ion that might have been disturbed by such a
"happy ending". This was family entertainment
of a kind that had not been seen before in India,
but any development message it might have
contained was well hidden.
Even the producers of the serial and the
authorities responsible for its birth were taken
aback by the extent of its popularity. No stars
had been cast in it. The young people who
played the two leading roles were just out of
school and had no acting experience, and the
other actors mostly came from amateur theatre
in Delhi. Then, overnight, India's first televi¬
sion stars were born. The actors were mobbed
in the streets, overwhelmed with awards and
accolades. It was as if people were yearning for
situations and characters they could identify
with.
The tremendous response to Hum Log
opened the floodgates. Televiewers who had
been hooked on it and advertisers who had
suddenly discovered the phenomenal reach of
television called for more serials of the same
kind. Hopeful young film-makers offered to
make them. The authorities, finding that adver¬
tising could painlessly provide the immense
amount of capital required for large-scale
expansion, threw open television to advertising,
going against the principles and policies they
had laid down earlier.
With money easily available, production
standards improved rapidly. The commercials
acquired a slick Western look and made a
clever sales pitch. Many felt with dismay that
this was an open invitation to the disasters of
consumerism. Advertisements are often aimed
at children, who sing the commercials and
demand the products television dangles before
their eyes. Advertisers compete for prime
advertising spots that go with the serials, which
are shown seven days a week at 9 p.m., between
the twenty-minute national news telecast in
Hindi at 8.40 and in English at 9.30 p.m.
A kind of "serial madness" has taken over.
Everybody from film producers and film stars
to retired government officials and clerks with
contacts in high places wants to produce serials.
Many succeed. After the amazing run of Hum
Log, hundreds of other serials have been
shown, some with over a hundred episodes.
They have featured an extraordinary variety of
subjects, but only a few have captured the
hearts and minds of the television public.
Shortly after Hum Log came Buniyaad
("Foundation Stone"). Another family epic, it
took as its starting point the partition of India
in 1947 and followed the fortunes of a single
family over three generations. The family's
plight arriving in Delhi as refugees from Lahore
struck a chord with many people in northern
India who still retained traumatic memories of

partition. Buniyaad, which was broadcast twice
a week for a year and ran to 104 episodes,
became a cult, and its characters became house¬
hold names. It ended in March 1987, but
cassettes of it are available in all video rental
libraries in India. It appears to have been
equally popular in Pakistan.
Nothing, however, could equal the aston¬
ishing impact of the serialization of the great
Indian epics that came soon after the
Ramayana and, two years later, the Mahabha-
rata. The popularity of the Ramayana particu¬
larly surpassed all expectations. When it was
shown on Sunday mornings, people would
bathe and dress before sitting down reverently
in front of their television sets. Popular myth
combined with religious sentiment to evoke
total audience identification. It was proof, if
any proof were needed, that for Indians the
roots of cultural expression still lie firmly
embedded in these two great epics.
However, many people were alarmed by
what they saw as elements of kitsch in a pro
duction that reduced great poetry and high cul¬
ture into a kind of bazaar art. Apprehensions
about a worrying Hindu revivalism were also
expressed because the Ramayana serial, more
than the Mahabharata, emphasized the Hindu
religious rather than the Indian cultural nature
of the stories. Perhaps to counter this criticism,
the Indian television authority, Doordarshan, is
now ready to start serializing stories from the
Bible.
Sport and
late-night movies
Sports programmes are almost as popular as
serials. Cricket has always been popular with
Indian audiences, but television has turned it
into a national passion. Life virtually comes to
a standstill during one-day international
matches. In shops and offices transistors are
turned on full blast, while those who can, stay
at home to watch television. The rate of absen¬
teeism from offices, schools and colleges rises
dramatically during those days. Two cricketing

idols, Ravi Shastri and the legendary Sunil
Gavaskar, have produced and presented cricket
serials that attracted a wide following on
Sunday mornings. Live coverage of tennis, par¬
ticularly the Wimbledon semi-finals and finals,
football and hockey matches and athletics, has
proved to be a great incentive to sports partici¬
pation among students.
For many years, Sunday evening was
reserved for a popular Hindi film of the kind,
produced in Bombay, which has served as the
model for commercial films made in all the lan¬
guages of India. Today this film is shown on
Saturday evenings, and on Sundays the regional
networks show popular films in local languages.
Twice a week half-hour programmes of
song sequences compiled from popular films
reinforce the passion for cinema. To offset this
to some extent, an attempt was made to intro¬
duce audiences to the "alternative" cinema,
showing a "serious" film in different Indian lan¬
guages (with English subtitles) on Sunday after¬
noons. But sandwiched between a morning of
serials and the popular film in the evening, this
remains a gesture rather than a genuine attempt
to create a deeper understanding.
The latest controversy focuses on Doordar-
shan's decision to show outstanding films twice
a week at 11.30 p.m., an Indian film on
Tuesday nights, a film from another country on
Friday nights. These films are meant for adult
viewing, but there has been a vigorous protest
that children stay up to watch them and that
even adults arrive at work bleary-eyed the next
morning. No matter that it is for parents to
prevent children from watching and for the
adults to take adult decisions about their sleep¬
ing hours. The blame is placed squarely on
Doordarshan for providing the temptation.
Meanwhile, the late-night movies continue.
Accused of selling out to commercialism
and the serials, sponsored by big business,
Doordarshan has taken another significant step
in dealing directly with directors and producers
to buy documentary serials on such topical
issues as the environmental crisis and drug
addiction. But these are usually shown late at
night, defeating their very purpose.
Programming has to take account of the
audience's lack of homogeneity and the
number of languages spoken in India. From 6
p.m., when the evening transmission starts,
each station broadcasts locally produced pro¬
grammes in regional languages. At 8.40 p.m.,
the National Programme beamed from Delhi
takes over, with the news in Hindi. Nine p.m.
is serial time, followed by the news in English.
Discussions on current affairs, a documentary
of "national" interest, classical dance or music
bring the evening to a close at 11 p.m., except
for the Tuesday and Friday late-night film.
The last two years have brought dramatic
changes in the Indian media environment. In
answer to persistent criticism of the low stan¬
dard of programmes and the stultifying system
that did not allow a more lively spirit to
emerge, the government took the daring step of
introducing a Bill to create autonomous bodies
both for sound radio (AIR) and TV (Doordar¬
shan) This project has had a chequered history.
A Bill was passed by Parliament and became an
Act towards the end of 1990, but before it
could be implemented there was a change of
government. And so after thirty-four years of
existence Indian TV continues to be at the
crossroads, a prisoner of indecision.

Fiction Brazil:
by Dinapiera
di Donato
A scene from Valetudo
("Anything Goes"), a
Brazilian telenovela
produced in 1989.
1 . Tclcnovclas literally
"telenovcls" are serials, mostly
made in Brazil or Mexico, that arc
extremely popular in Latin
America and elsewhere. Editor.
IT is midday. Millions of Brazilians eating
lunch in front of their television sets are
open-mouthed. On the screen is a man they
have seen before but never in his shirtsleeves.
Looking worried, he calls them "my friends",
asks them "not to condemn too hastily" and
concludes his plea with a solemn "May God
help us!" The media unanimously agree that
this is a serious moment. The President of the
Republic has just appeared on every television
channel to defend himself before the nation
against accusations of wrong-doing made by
his own brother. Passers-by interviewed in the
street say the brother has gone haywire and
that the whole thing is like a TV serial.
Another disturbing piece of news. The
bishop of the Universal Church of the
Kingdom of God, which happens to be the
owner of the TV Record channel, has been
arrested. Can it really be true that he has been
involved in a ring supplying fake university
degrees? Viewers barely have time to recover
from this particular shock before they learn
that the thirteen-year-old claimant to the
throne of Brazil, the last descendant of the
Emperor Pedro II and Princess Isabella of Por¬
tugal, has been abducted in front of the Impe¬
rial Museum in Petropolis, a city whose name
could itself come from a science-fiction novel.
No, these are not episodes in a television
soap opera. On this typical day in May 1992, the
public wants above all to know if the motorway
linking Rio de Janeiro's airport to the confer¬
ence centre where the "Earth Summit" will
open in a few days will be finished in time a
motorway that will also make it possible to
avoid having to travel through the city's shanty-
towns. Meanwhile Silvio Abreu, the author of
the successful tclenovela' Guerra dos sexos
("The Battle of the Sexes"), is preparing the
screenplay for another serial, Deus nos acuda
("God Help Us"), in which God sends an envoy
to the Brazilian inferno to try to find someone
who can save the country. The protagonists are
named Scandalous Mary, Celestina, Minister
Gabriel. As the celebrated dramatist and televi¬
sion screenwriter Dias Gomes puts it, "Realism
here is indissociable from the fantastic".
Brazil is a country where, according to a
1984 survey, television serials are more impor¬
tant to the national economy than the motor
industry, and where the two leading TV net¬
works, Rede Globo and Mánchete, arguably
have more impact on illiterates than the mil¬
lions of reading manuals distributed by the
national literacy campaign. The first university
in Brazil was founded in 1922 so that King
Leopold of Belgium could be welcomed with
the correct protocol during a state visit, for at
the time the Brazilian élite was educated at
Coimbra or Paris. Now there are many univer¬
sities and education has been democratized, but
it is through television that most Brazilians
complete their studies of sociology, geography
and all kinds of other subjects.
This is the only explanation for the extraor¬
dinary success of Pantanal ("The Marsh"), a
serial that brought to the small screen the for¬
gotten landscapes of the Mato Grosso, the
world of the jaguar-woman Yuma Marruá and
of river spirits who speak to humans, of all the
peasants, landowners and farmers who had
long disappeared from the Brazilian city-dwel¬
lers' worldview. Pantanal piled on the special 41

effects, which are very popular in Brazilian
productions, depicting in amazing images the
metamorphoses of Yuma Marruá or the
majestic flight of wild birds. Viewers seeing
Brazil's hidden face rising up before their eyes
felt that they were returning to their roots and
learning about the environment.
Recipes
for success
The Brazilian telenovela is the product of a
favourable set of circumstances that, without
forcing it to eschew such conventions of the
serial form as fragmented plotlines, suspense,
love interest and emotional drama, prevents it
from becoming too far-fetched or from por¬
traying a world divided simplistically into
goodies and baddies, and instead encourages
humour and an interest in the ups and downs
of everyday life. It is also the fruit of team¬
work, benefiting from the combined efforts of
the country's best dramatists, authors, actors,
composer-musicians, directors and documen¬
tary film-makers. This is rarely the case in
North America, where the television serial is
regarded as a minor genre left to be semi-
improvised by B-movie directors. The limita¬
tions of the serial format are the same in Brazil
as elsewhere, but Brazilian programme-makers
have long since learned how to overcome them
and give free rein to their creativity.
When it began in the 1950s, Brazilian televi¬
sion established itself as an instrument of
national unification through its Tupi, Río,
Excelsior and Rede Globo channels. In the fol¬
lowing decade the telenovela made a break¬
through into a world of bland programmes and
pretentious drama. Telenovelas were soon
taking Brazil by storm, particularly after Excel¬
sior broadcast the serial 25-499 Isn't Answering.
After a coup d'état in 1964 established a
military dictatorship, telenovelas, unlike other
types of programme, to a large extent
although not entirely escaped censorship, and
large numbers of them were made. In a crisis-
torn society in search of an identity, the ques
tion of what it meant to be Brazilian was much
debated. While the state alternately encouraged
and banned the production of telenovelas, the
latter became influenced by Cinema Novo and
the Tropicalist movement.
Telenovelas ceased to be based on the once-
popular historical romances and tearjerking
stories of ruined aristocrats, and became closer
to the facts of contemporary life. They drew on
the talents of writers such as Guimaräes Rosa,
Jorge Amado, Aguinaldo Silva, Benedito Ruy
Barbosa, Dias Gomes, Guarnieri and Suassune,
of celebrated musician-composers including
Toquinho, Vinicius de Moraes, Gal Costa and
Roberto and Erasmo Carlos, and of leading
actors and technicians. They used the everyday
form of speech and regional dialects, and drew
inspiration from real events. Under the
influence of avant-garde theatre, new characters
appeared mendacious, corrupt and arriviste
anti-heroes, and unusual women. Endings
became more subtle and both tragedy and
comedy were staged more professionally.
Telenovelas showed what no-one dared say
out loud: that it was possible to be Brazilian
without sheltering behind a narrow form of
nationalism. The point is well illustrated by a
serial that, because of censorship problems,
took ten years to reach the screen. This was
Roque Santeiro, directed by Dias Gomes,
Aguinaldo Silva and others and set in Asa
Branca. The story, which features a microcosm
of Brazilian society, is rich in mythology,
which in the words of one of the characters,
blind Jeremy, is "more powerful than reality".
Thanks to myth, the outcasts survive and the
bold prosper like the hero, a sculptor special¬
izing in saints who ends up canonized even
though he is at best a likeable rogue. In the end,
the "baddies" (who really aren't all that bad)
triumph, while the "goodies" come to realize
that no-one really wants to know the truth, for
fear that life in this marvellous country would
become intolerable as a result.

Big screen, small screen
by François Garçon
Is television a
rival or an ally
of the cinema?
Robert Mitchum and Marilyn
Monroe starred in Otto
Preminger's River of No
Return (1954), above.
IT is fashionable to criticize television.
Many people hold it responsible for all the
problems facing the cinema today. They
blame it for plunging attendance figures and
for the closure of movie houses and their
transformation into car-parks or supermar¬
kets. To listen to television's detractors, its
power to keep paying customers away from
all forms of live entertainment, including
sport, is virtually boundless. People connected
with the performing arts complain bitterly
about the increasing encroachments of the
small screen.
There is nothing new about complaints
against television. Stories of the bitter combat
between the large and the small screen are
legion, and in some cases barely credible. In
1960, for instance, cinema-owners in Paris's
Latin Quarter protested about the appearance
of television receivers in the bistros of the rue
de la Huchette and the boulevard Saint-Michel.
They claimed that the black-and-white sets
perched above the bars were providing free
film shows for a clientele of penniless students.
Countless misdeeds have been laid at televi¬
sion's door. It is high time that someone took
on the thankless task of stating the case for tele¬
vision and answering its critics. 43

"Making films is a very
costly business. . . ." Above,
shooting The Name of the
Rose, filmed by Jean-Jacques
Annaud in 1986.
Below, Neil Jordan's Mona
Lisa (1986) was financed by
Britain's Channel Four
television network.
A GARGANTUAN
APPETITE FOR FILMS
Making films is a very costly business. In 1991,
the average budget for a Hollywood feature
stretched to $28 million, and a French film
typically cost more than FF25 million to make.
Sums like that are not easy to come by, and
television has now become an indispensable
source of supplementary finance for film¬
makers. Backing from public and subscription
channels in Europe and North America cur¬
rently makes up about 30 per cent of film
financing. No producer today outside the big
Hollywood studios or such well-capitalized
groups as Gaumont in France can start shoot-
44 a
ing without having pre-sold his film to televi¬
sion especially since crucial public subsidies
often depend on a contract guaranteeing televi¬
sion screening.
What is more, most films cannot pay their
way on theatre showings alone. Statistics from
the United States, which may also be valid for
the industry worldwide, show that only one
film in ten makes a profit on the big screen,
while at least seven lose money. Losses would
be even greater were it not for the second lease
of life films get on television, and in recent
years through video. The development of new,
movie-oriented television channels like Canal+
in France, Premiere in Germany and Sky
Movie in the United Kingdom has brought
considerable extra financial support for film
companies.
So television provides the film industry
with substantial additional funds and regular
receipts of the sort that makes backers happy.
Financially speaking, when the broadcasters
catch a cold as is the case today for RTVE in
Spain or Britain's ITV network the whole
production business sneezes.
The additional market television represents
for the film industry also helps film studios to
operate more efficiently. The film industry has
always had to cope with the problem of slack
periods between. productions, when overheads
such as studio maintenance costs and the sala¬
ries of full-time employees still have to be paid.
Making films for television, because of its pre¬
dictable, quasi-industrial nature, can be fitted in
between shooting films for the cinema. Tele¬
film production helps studios to pay their over¬
heads and to manage their operations more
rationally.
Furthermore, television is a natural outlet
for low-budget films that often have difficulty
in finding distributors for cinema release. In
the United States in 1986, independent produc¬
ers made some 470 films, only sixty-nine of
which were shown in theatres. More than
three-quarters of this output would thus never
have had an audience if they had been rejected
by television. Because of TV's gargantuan
appetite, however, that was fortunately not
the case.
A NEW SHOWING
FOR MOVIE CLASSICS
But television offers more than just financial
support. It has helped promote the film as an
art form, especially among young people.
Arthouse films that were once relegated to off-

peak hours are now the staple diet of cinema-
heritage channels such as France's Ciné Cinéma
and Ciné Cinéphil. In the United States, where
cable has existed since the 1950s, the American
Movie Classics channel, which only shows
films made between 1930 and 1970, had
twenty-eight million subscribers in 1991. The
Nostalgia Channel, which also shows old films,
has ten million. A new public is thereby becom¬
ing acquainted with films it would otherwise
never have the chance to see unless it fre¬
quented the British Film Institute, Belgium's
Cinémathèque Royale, the cinémathèques at
the Palais de Chaillot and the Pompidou
Centre in Paris, or the Cinémathèque Suisse in
Lausanne. Such institutions are few and far
between, and announce their programmes only
shortly before they are shown.
Television has also been in at the birth of
several recent movements in film-making. Pres¬
sure from television has brought new life to
British cinema. Britain's leading contemporary
directors have all worked in television, and
such well-known films as Mona Lisa, My
Beautiful Laundrette, A Room with a View and
The Draughtsman's Contract were all commis¬
sioned by Channel 4. The role of the French
subscription channel Canal+ has been even
more influential, permitting, as no other insti¬
tution could, thirty or so directors each year to
make their debut behind a camera.
It would be wrong to assume that televi¬
sion today only produces bland films with
unadventurous story lines. Its commitment to
film can be judged from the growing number
of film subsidiaries attached to the BBC,
Canal-i- and Italy's RAI even though, if
the head of Thames Television International
is to be believed, the profitability of these
companies is far from assured. Finally, tele¬
vision has forced the film industry to differen¬
tiate its products from those of the TV stu¬
dios. The films that prove the biggest
international money-spinners, such as The
Bear, The Big Blue, Who Killed Roger Rabbit?
and Terminator 2, have generally been made
for theatre showing.
The very limitations of television can help
cinema in a way by drawing attention to the
size of the cinema screen and thus justifying the
ever-rising cost of seats in movie-houses. The
best-frequented cinemas tend to be the most
impressive ones: Kinepolis in Brussels, Kinopa¬
norama or the Max Linder in Paris. In Stock¬
holm cinema complexes with modern sound-
systems pull in the crowds, as they do in Aus¬
tralia, whose modern cinemas have the highest
attendance rates in the world after Norway's.
In the United Kingdom, figures for cinema-
going have just risen back above the 100-mil-
lion mark, and that at a time when the quantity
and quality of televised material on offer have
never been so high.
So if television has been detrimental to
cinema in the past, today things seem to be
moving in the opposite direction. On the one
hand television needs more and more films; on
the other, the public fed up with the small
and distorted image it sees on the television
screen is starting to go back to the cinema.
Curiously enough, the expensive and anar¬
chic competition that came from TV in the 1960s
and 1970s may have helped to modernize the art
of cinema and so enabled it to survive. Thanks to
television, people still love the cinema. The film
industry has been forced to look to its laurels
and is today emerging from its lethargy at last.
We may be witnessing the start of a long and
necessary period of co-operation. G

spinners . . . have generally

TRIBUTE TO
MOTHER TERESA
This year's Unesco Prize for Peace
' Education has been awarded to
Mother Teresa of Calcutta, winner
of the Nobel Peace Prize in 1979.
According to the jury, the honour
rewards "the achievements of a
life entirely dedicated to serving
the poor, promoting peace and
fighting injustice". Born into an
Albanian peasant family in Skopje
(Yugoslavia) on 27 August 1910,
Agnes Gonxha Bojaxhui entered,
at 18, the Irish order of the
Sisters of Loretto. She left the
order 20 years later to found the
Society of the Missionaries of
Charities in Calcutta in order to
serve the "poorest of the poor". In
1950, she became an Indian
citizen. She started an open-air
school for street children, and
then, with the help of donations,
opened other schools,
orphanages, clinics, and, in 1957,
a centre for lepers. The Director-
General of Unesco, Mr. Federico
Mayor, will award the 1992 Peace
Education Prize to Mother Teresa
at Unesco headquarters on 22
October.

SAVING
THE NIGHT SKY
"An essential element of our
civilization and culture is rapidly
being lost," according to
astronomers who met at Unesco
headquarters in July. The
astronomers urged Unesco to do
everything within its power to
preserve the finest astronomical
observatory locations, if possible
by designating them World
Heritage Sites. Excessive
nocturnal lighting, aerosols and
dust suspended in the
atmosphere, sulphur from fossil-
fuel consumption and particles
thrown up by volcanic eruptions all
contribute to making the stars
less visible. Radio pollution and
space debris can also cause
problems for astronomers.
"Astronomy has always been
retreating; going further and
further away from civilization,
seeking out remote locations. But
now there is no place left to go,"
one of the astronomers claimed.
He went on to demand "better
protection for the best
astronomical sites", where the sky
is dark and there is no risk of
picking up telephone messages or
activity from microwave ovens
while looking for signals from
distant galaxies.
THE BEST OF YOUTH
TELEVISION
Children of Waterland, a fictional
story made by Dutch television for
children up to 7 years of age, was
among the winners of this year's
Prix Jeunesse International. The
prize is awarded by the Prix
Jeunesse Foundation, which was
established in 1964 under the
joint auspices of the city of
Munich, Bavarian television and
the second German television
channel, ZDF, in order to "promote
television for children and youth,
to develop international
exchanges of programmes and to
improve understanding between
peoples." The Tower of Babel, a
game-show for children made by
Polish television, received the
special prize of the German
National Commission for Unesco,
while Beat That, from Britain's
Channel 4, which demonstrates
how handicapped children can be
helped to develop their
potential and play a useful social
role, won a special UNICEF prize.
Lelée ou l'aînée de la famille,
made by the broadcasting
company of Niger, received a prize
sponsored by the German
television network Transtel for
what the jury described as "its
authenticity, its sensitivity and its
reflection of two cultures in one
country".
EDUCATING STREET
CHILDREN
In 1992, according to United
Nations estimates, 145 million
homeless children around the
world live in the street, do not
attend school, survive by finding
odd jobs, suffer maltreatment and
even violence from adults and are
sometimes physically eliminated
by the police. The children, who
are largely ignored by official
statistics and rarely taken into
account in national education
budgets, have been of particular
concern to Unesco since the 155
nations participating in the World
Conference on Education for All,
held In Jomtien (Thailand) in
1990, called for immediate action
to help such children, minorities
and remote rural populations. In
co-operation with the United
Nations Children's Fund (UNICEF)
and a number of non¬
governmental organizations,
Unesco is seeking to identify and
support projects designed to help
street children, and is also trying
with the aid of the media to make
the public and potential aid-donors
aware of the gravity of the
problem.
EXAMINING THE ROOTS
OF VIOLENCE
Torture, assaults on women,
children and the old, abuse of
human rights, drugs, and even the
death penalty were among the
forms of violence discussed by
more than 1,500 experts who
attended the Second World
Congress on Violence
and Human Coexistence, held in
Montreal (Canada) last July. The
Congress, held under Unesco
auspices, devoted much of its
time to considering the Seville
Declaration on Violence, issued in
1986 by 15 scientists on the
initiative of the Spanish National
Commission for Unesco. The
Declaration said, in substance,
that war is not humanity's
biological destiny and put forward
proposals for the construction of
peace. O

WORLD HERITAGE
Gorée, island ofslaves
by Caroline Haardt
48
LYING off the Senegalese coast less than
four kilometres from Dakar, whose
roadstead it closes, the island of Gorée
was for more than three centuries the object of
bitter disputes between rival European nations.
Its charming little port, protected by a small
bay, provided an ideal anchorage for the ships
that took African slaves to the colonies across
the Atlantic.
In the Middle Ages, all that Europe knew
of black Africa was the Moroccan coast as far
as Cape Bojador. But in the fifteenth century
the discoveries of the Renaissance revolutio¬
nized navigational techniques: the compass and
the astrolabe made their appearance, as did the
caravel, which took the place of galleys and the
fragile cogs of the Crusades. Cosmographers
affirmed that the world was round and that it
should be possible to circle it. Spain and Por¬
tugal, then at the summit of their power, were
ready to take on any challenge. The rulers of
Aragon and Castile sent Christopher
Columbus to discover the New World, while
Portugal's Prince Henry, known as the Navi¬
gator, sent off to Africa the caravels that would
discover the maritime spice route.
In 1444, Portuguese explorers under the
command of Dinis Diaz passed the mouth of
the Senegal river and reached, off Cape Verde, a
small uninhabited island about 900 metres long
by 300 wide, which they called Palma. Gorée's
turbulent history had begun: the island would
subsequently change hands seventeen times!
Portuguese and Dutch
Gorée became a port of call much used by Por¬
tuguese vessels, and Fernando Po, Vasco da
Gama, Francis Xavier, Camöes and many other
explorers and missionaries landed there on
their way to the Orient. But the island is tiny
and infertile, and it long remained uninhabited.
The Portuguese who had appropriated it pre¬
ferred to build their bases on the mainland.
They nonetheless allowed English, French and
Dutch merchants to repair their boats there
and to assemble a fleet of small wooden vessels,
as a result of which the island became known
as "the isle of longboats".
In 1558, when the Portuguese no longer
ruled the seas, the Dutch took control of Palma,
which they renamed Gorée (Goede Reede
means "good anchorage" in Dutch). They built
two forts, Nassau and Orange, giving the island
a military purpose which it continued to serve
until the Second World War. The fortifications
were strengthened and kept under repair by
successive occupiers of the island.
The Dutch, Portuguese and French long
disputed control of this strategically located
base, where trading companies made fortunes
dealing in gold, gum, wax, hides and ivory.
Gorée became a fortified trading-post, over¬
flowing with African products and European
merchandise. But its most lucrative business
lay elsewhere, in the tragic slave trade.
This traffic had a long history in Africa.
For centuries slaves were transported north¬
wards to the countries of the Maghreb. Then,
with the coming of the Europeans, the slave
trade expanded to America and the West
Indies. After the arrival of the Portuguese in
the fifteenth century, Africans began to be
shipped in boatloads to Portugal, where they
were employed as domestic servants or agricul¬
tural labourers. The discovery of the Atlantic
islands, where sugar-cane cultivation was soon
established, increased the demand for slave
labour. The kidnapping of slaves became too
haphazard a means of supply, and was replaced
by regular trafficking carried out with the
complicity of certain African princes.
The House of Slaves (before restoration).
The appetite of the traders was boundless.
It has been estimated that in half a century the
Portuguese carried off some 150,000 African
slaves. Soon Senegal and the Gambia could no
longer satisfy their needs, and they went far
inland in search of communities willing to pro¬
vide them with slaves. Later, in the seventeenth
and eighteenth centuries, it would be the turn
of the so-called Slave Coast (today's Gabon and
Angola) to furnish human cargoes to be dis¬
patched to Brazil and the West Indies. But
Gorée, where the slaves were assembled and
branded before being sent off to America, long
remained one of the pivots of this odious traffic.
Even before reaching Gorée, the slaves
were sorted into ethnic groups and put in
irons. On the island they were made to work
in spite of their chains. They were used to
break rocks, "shift earth, roll water barrels and
unload small boats." The women and children,
who were not fettered, prepared meals and
worked as servants. At night the slaves were
crammed into fetid, unlit lockups. Those who
rebelled were put in barred cells until the time
came for their embarkation, when the com¬
pany mark was branded onto them with a red-
hot iron.
The stay on Gorée was particularly distres¬
sing, and the inhuman and degrading treatment
meted out to the slaves sometimes drove them
to revolt. These risings were usually violent,
and although they were repressed with great
cruelty, they continued to occur. In Africa as in
the Americas, the blacks never resigned them¬
selves to their pitiful condition. Their determi¬
nation to break the yoke actively contributed
to the abolition of the slave trade, and of the
institution of slavery itself, at the start of the
nineteenth century.
Historians have estimated that the total
number of slaves transported out of black
Africa was between fifteen and thirty million.
It is impossible to know how many passed
through Gorée, but it is certain that the very
name of the island must have long inspired bit¬
terness and terror.
Happier times
But the history of Gorée does not end with the
slave trade. The contacts between Africans and
Europeans created a unique, mixed-blood
society there. In the wake of the first Portu¬
guese mariners to put into Gorée came an

influx of adventurers known as laucados who
mingled with the indigenous population, adopt¬
ing their clothing, language and customs.
They grew rich by trading slaves and other
merchandise, until the French East India Com¬
pany declared a monopoly of commerce from
1677 and brought about their decline. But the
departure of the Portuguese did not mean the
end of the Creole cultural melting pot, which
continued under the Dutch, English and
French.
In the eighteenth century the population of
the island was made up of agents of the East
India Company, a garrison of soldiers and a
free black community who themselves owned
slaves. The tropical climate did not suit Euro¬
peans, who were always the first to suffer from
diseases for which treatment was then un¬
known. The menfolk therefore took wives and
concubines from among the islanders, contract¬
ing what were known as "local marriages". The
mulatto offspring of these unions became
natural intermediaries between the European
trading companies and the mainland African
chiefs.
The mulatto women were known as
signares (from the Portuguese senhora). Rich,
powerful, covered in jewels and surrounded by
servants and slaves whose hair was tressed with
golden coins, they reigned over the balls and
social life of the island, splendidly combining
business and pleasure. In 1767, Cathy Louet, the
signare of Captain Aussenac, was the wealth¬
iest landowner on the island. On her estate, an
acre in extent, she built a vast mansion and
employed sixty-eight house slaves. A plan of
the island drawn in 1779 by Evrard Duporel
shows eleven villas out of eighteen belonging
to beautiful mixed-race women such as Anne
Pépin, Victoria Albis and Hélène Aussenac.
Gorée's high society led a leisured and
sophisticated life, modeling its manners on
those currently fashionable in France. There
was a vogue for building with the yellow
marble extracted from the Castel hill some¬
times to the cost of the island's fortifications.
When the marble ran out, it was replaced with
basalt or Dakar clay. The bricks were cemented
with a mortar of conchiferous limestone mixed
with sand. The landscape of the island took on
its present form: in the south-west, the bar¬
racks; in the south the village of Gourmettes
with its population of Christians and educated
and baptised blacks; in the east the dwellings of
the Bambara. The main public buildings were
the hospital and the church. Slave quarters
occupied all the lower part of the island, until
Nicolas Pépin, a brother of the celebrated
signare, built the "House of Slaves".
In 1848 Gorée joyfully celebrated the abo¬
lition of slavery. Fifteen years earlier, its popu¬
lation had peaked at 5,000 inhabitants. Hence¬
forth it would be the home of only free men
and women. 49

UNESCO IN ACTION
WORLD HERITAGE

After a period of adaptation the island was
given new uses. Schools and religious congre¬
gations inaugurated a new round of construc¬
tion. Gorée became a free port, and businesses,
shops and bazaars proliferated. From this
period of prosperity have survived some cool
and elegant houses with balconies and veran¬
dahs, wooden galleries and tiled roofs.
The years of decline
By the end of the nineteenth century, the island
was overpopulated and could no longer satisfy
the ambitions of its inhabitants. It gradually
lost its commercial privileges to the new
capital, Dakar. In commercial matters too it got
left behind, not being able to meet the financial
demands of ground-nut cultivation. The
railway which now linked Saint-Louis to
Dakar on the mainland did not help. With the
opening of the Suez Canal, Gorée lost its final
asset. Boats sailing for Asia no longer broke
their journey there.
By 1910 the island's population had been
reduced by half, and by 1931 there were only
300 inhabitants left. (There are 900 today).
Terrible epidemics of yellow fever had struck
in 1859, 1878 and 1927, and contaminated
houses were razed to the ground. Gorée sank
into a sleep from which it has never entirely
awakened.
Now the drowsy little island lives on
memories of the carefree luxury and suffering
of its past, to the rhythm of the daily coming
and going of the boat that links it to the main¬
land. But new dangers are threatening. Humi¬
dity and salt are taking their toll of the build¬
ings, and there are no longer enough
inhabitants to maintain them as in former days.
Unable to meet the challenge from Dakar,
Gorée has become a dormitory suburb. With
CAROLINE HAARDT, French journalist, was a
staff member of Unesco's Division of Cultural
Heritage from 1983 to 1987.
ANTONELLA VERDIANI is an Italian architect
who from 1987 to 1990 lived on the island of
Gorée, where she took part in the safeguard
campaign. She has been commissioned by the
EEC to carry out a study on the rehabilitation of
Gorée as a living community.
no local economic activity to keep them, the
islanders look for work in the capital. Mean¬
while, the island has been invaded by part-time
residents who are turning the old slave-
quarters into second homes.
In 1980, Mr. Amadou-Mahtar M'Bow,
then Director-General of UNESCO, launched
an international campaign to preserve the
island. He did so to prevent it from falling into
oblivion, and to enable it to become instead "a
place for meditation . . . where those who are
most aware of the tragedies of their history
will gain a more real sense of justice and
brotherhood."
Gorée today
by Antonella Verdiani
Gorée's architecture has so many distinctive
features that it is possible to talk of a spe¬
cific Gorean style. Some of these features,
such as large, airy rooms opening onto porches, bal¬
conies and galleries, are typically colonial. Others
are dictated by naturethe use of black volcanic
basalt; walls limewashed in pink, ochre and yellow;
straw thatched roofs, the flat roofs and red tiles that
came later. The effect is so charming and the build¬
ings are so well integrated into their environment,
that it is almost possible to forget the island's tragic
past.
It has been said that Gorée "has preserved an
architectural coherence that combines widely differ¬
ent cultural elementsChristian and Islamic, nor¬
thern and Mediteranean a unity imposed by limita¬
tions of space, exposure to the ocean winds, the
homogeneity of the building materials and, perhaps
most of all, the forces of a tumultuous history that
turned every dwelling into a slave warehouse and a
defensive redoubt."
In 1974, at the request of the Senegalese author¬
ities, several consultants made preliminary studies
with a view to establishing a detailed plan of action for
the protection, preservation and development of this
architectural heritage. The plan proposed that ten
sites of historic interest should be restored, including
the Hortala, Sudan, Diouga Dieng and Victoria Albis
houses, the William Ponty School, the Nuns' Pavilion,
the remains of the open-air theatre and the harbour¬
master's building. It also recommended the establish¬
ment of a cultural programme aimed at developing a
sense of national identity.
On 22 December 1980, the Director-General of
Unesco appealed to the international community to
help safeguard Gorée, which had been placed on the
World Heritage List in September 1978.
More than 10 years have now passed since the
Plan of Action was adopted. On the positive side,
three buildings have been restored and are now serv¬
ing various cultural functions. The Sudan House has
become a research centre; the Harbourmaster's
Building is temporarily being used as an annexe to
the Université des Mutants; the Victoria Albis house
¡s used for exhibitions, as well as providing a home
for the Office of the Architecture of Historical Monu¬
ments and for Unesco's expert on the island. The
structure of a fourth building, the Diouga Deng
House, is currently being strengthened, and plans to
rehabilitate the William Ponty School for residential
and cultural use with the aid of the EEC are about to
be approved.
But \he Plan of Action gives priority to the
island's cultural role, and now needs to be reviewed
so that more attention is given to the development
of the economy and tourism. The risk is that the
stress on cultural activities might otherwise turn
Gorée into an island museum deserted by its own
inhabitants.
The restoration of the House of Slaves is very
important in this respect. Even though it was not
one of the priorities indicated by the Plan of Action,
the building, which has great historical significance,
was repaired in 1990/91 with the aid of a French
association, the Comité France Liberté. It is a typical
eighteenth-century slave building, with the trading
areas on the ground floor and the masters' apart¬
ments upstairs. A small door in the central courtyard
opening towards the sea was the threshold through
which the slaves passed to the ships that took them
to America.
This house, which has become one of the great
symbols of slavery, receives more than 20,000 visi¬
tors a year from all around the world. Prominent
among them are black Americans who come as pil¬
grims, repeating in a reverse direction the journey
their ancestors made from the shores of Africa two
centuries ago.
The museum, which has been open for years,
has recently been provided with a faithfully recons¬
tructed dwelling-room, furnished for the most part
with the original furniture and objects. There is also
an exhibition of documents relating to daily life on
Gorée in the eighteenth century. l~J
