A Conference for the creation of an International Institute of the Hylean Amazon, called
jointly by the governments of Peru and Bràzil and by Unesco, has successfully concluded
its deliberations at Iquitos, Peru. Lasting for eleven days from April 30 to May 10, the
Conference agreed upon a convention establishing the Institute which will come into force
. upon final acceptance by the founding nations. Pending the initiation of the operation of the
Institute, an Interim Commission was established with headquarters in Manaus, Brazil.
The following nations signed the final act of the Conference : Bolivia, Brazil, Colombia,
Ecuador, France, Holland, Italy, Peru and Venezuela.

FOR GERMANY
PREPARED
BY SECRETARIAT
DETAILS of the Usco pro-. gramme to be extended
shortly to Germany Itli, e been
made known in Paris. The work-
plan. which is to be carried out
in co-operation with the appro-
pi iate allied authorities, was pre-
pared after the Executive Board's
approval for such action at a
special meeting at Unesco on
April 5.
The programme, as approved
by the Sub-Committee of the
Executive Board, covers five main
fields of activity which Unesco
will develop in Germany.
These deal with : methods to
acquaint the German people with
the aims and activities of Unesco,
the) development of publication
exchanges between Germany and
other countries, studies of tex-
bock revision and improvement,
studies of the problems and op-
pox'unites for the exchange of
persons between Germany and
the outside world and invitations
to German experts to attend cer-
tain technical meetings called by
Unesco.
Agreement on the programme
has been secured from the Bri-
tish. French and United States
Military Governors in Germany.
and the projects will be initiated
as soon as necessary administra-
tive details have been completed
The programme as formulated by
the Sub-Committee was summit
ted to the Military Governors of
the four zones of occupation. To
date no answer has been received
from the Soviet Military Gover
nor.

resolutions and recommenda-
tions adopted by the delegates
stressed the importance of in-
formed exchange between indivi-
duals as well as îations. The con-
ference agreed that student
groups should be encouraged to
participate in community and
Unesco affairs by setting up
Unesco Community Councils.
In addition it was urged that
groups and individuals stimulate
newspaper, radio stations and mo-

Unesco and other U. N. Agencies.
The Conference held three ply-
nary sessions dealing with"The
Nature of the Present World Cri-

Unesco Sets Programme
for Ct assies Transition
WHAT are the great books of"each of the different coun-
tries of the world ? What are
the world's 100 best books ?
Unesco is attempting to obtain
an answer to these and other
questions from the Member Sta-
tes of the Organization with ! \
view to making great books avai-
lable on a universal scale in
translation.
The plan for the translation
of the grea. t books of the world
stems from a request by the
U. N. General Assembly made to
Unesco through the Econo : nic
and Social Council and aims at
making available the moht outs-
tanding written works of each
culture in all languages.
From May 18-21. at unesco
House in Paris, experts represent-
ing leading editors, publishers,
librarians and educators from
eleven different countries, met
to discuss methods of prepar-
ing national lists of great books
for translation, the actual work
of translation and the distribu-
tion and exchange of the finished
product on an international basis.
The meetings were held under the

World Educational Leaders.-
To Meet at Geneva
EDUCATIONAL leaders fromall parts of thé world will
meet in Geneva June 28-JuIy 3
at, he Eleventh International
Conference on Public Education.
Seventy-one nations have been
invited to send delegates to the
meetings which are jointly spon-
sored by Unesco and the Inter-
national Bureau of Education
(I. B. E.).
Progress reports on the deve-
lopment of educational standards
and facilities in each country will
be submitted by the delegations.
The Conference will study three
main questions, the role of school
psychologists, the teaching of
writing, and teaching about the,
United Nations and its Specializ-
ed Agencies.
At the forthcoming Eleventh
Conference, the materials submit-
ted and the text of the discussions
will be published jointly by
Unesco and the I. B. E. in French
and English editions. Hitherto,
these have been published by the
I. B. E. in French only.
Unesco is co-operating in plans
for the Conference and has bee, 1
responsible for some of the ma-
terials to be used. Unesco has
also prepared a wall exhibit and
a booklet of recommendations
and suggestions for Teaching
about the United Nations and its
Specialized Agencies (See middle
page), j
chairmanship of M. Julien Cain,
Director of French National
Library.
Unesco's project for transla-
tions, which was originally limi-
ted to"classics", has been broa-
dened to include great books in
an domains. The panel of experts
agreed that the initial lists
should be drawn up in three ca-
tegories : recognized classics writ-
ten before 1901, modern classics
up to 1939 and contemporary
great books. It was proposed that
all countries should establish Nar-
tional Committees to centralize
and co-ordinate the work. Such
committees should prepare lists
of the works of their own authors
whose writings they felt, should
be widely translated, and of fo-
reign authors whose works should
be rendered into the local lan-
guages.
Already replies have been re-
ceived from several Member Sta-
tes with their lists of great books.
Unesco's role in the programme
will consist, at the outset, in cir-
culating to Member States copies
of each official list as it is recei-
ved.
On the basis Of these lists, and
with the advice of experts in
different countries, the Bureau of
Unesco's plan for translations will
draw l1p a provisional list of
some 75 works (from the llrst
category of works written before
1901) which can be considered
universal classics. After a second
consultation with the National
Commissions, or other appro-
priate agencies, indicated by the
governments of Member States,
it will be possible ultimately to
issue a representative list of the
hundred best works.
Unesco could be of vita ! assis-
tance in the translation project,
the experts agreed, by suppryrng
information on the best and latest
methods of translation, by pro..

bring this Institute, which was originally proposed by the Brazilian-.-.----

2 UNESCO COURIER Volume I.-No S
Tensions Affecting
. .  6. <- I :
International Understanding
A S one reads the headlines thesedays, it is sometimes hard to
imagine that there may eventually
come a time when news-in what-
ever novel technical form it may
be carried-will not be primarily
concerned with stories about the
difficulties representatives of the
human species have living toge-
ther in amicable fashion. But it
must have been even harder for
many a Neanderthal philosopher
to have imagined a social unit
Jarge and efficient enough to
make it unnecessary for him to
use brute force in his daily strug-
gle for existence.
It is in the light of man's long
social development that I hke to
view Unesco's project on"Ten-
sions affecting international un-
derstanding". In his book"Evolu-
tion and Ethics", Dr.
Julian Huxley notes that
"Bìologicd or organic 
evolution has at its upper
end been merged into
and largely succeeded by
conscious or social evo--
Jution."As I see the
"Tensions Project"its essential job
is to try to speed up this social
evolution by gathering together
and focusing what knowledge IS
now available from the work Of
the human scientists.
It is only with such perspec-
tive that one can work on this
project without feeling a hope-
less frustration. For neither our
project, nor any project, can dis-
cover a magic formula for solv-
ing immediately problems such as
those of Palestine. and India. or
of East versus West. But our.
project can, irrespective of what
we hope will be its concrete re-
sults, serve as a symbol that men
who live in many parts of the
World and under very different
conditions, have at last decided
that they should have themselves
examined by some of their own
kind who pretend to be experts
in this thing called"Human Na-
ture". It is high time this hap-
pened and is itself a sign of social
evolution.
At the particular stage of man's
social evolution when the human
scientists have, for the first time,
been called in for a diagnosis by
a world-wide instrument of man's
own creation, we find men sepa-
rated essentially because of their
loyalties to a number of different
abstractions, such as"Nation",
"Religion"and"Race". Because
people believe in these abstrac-
tions, it is difficult for them to
see each other as fellow human
beings. All too frequently, on the
other hand, they see each other
as potential threats to some par-
ticular interest.
One of the most crippling of
these abstractions at the moment
is that of"Nation". The idea of
national sovereignty gives us very
foggy vision indeed of our fellow

Meeting to Study
Agressive NatiQnalism
A meeting at which specialists
in the fields of sociology, history,
psychology, psychiatry and eco-
nomics, designed to enquire into
the nature of tensions leading to
agressive nationalism will open
at Unesco in Paris on June 28 ; It
is expected to last about three
weeks.
This gathering is deigned to
form part of the Unesco project
for the study of tensions af-
fecting international. understand-
ing. In addition to a general
examination of the problem, it is
intended that recommendations
should be made so as to promote
a world-wide co-ordinated pro-
gramme of research by social
scientists into the factors which
create friction between peoples
and the factors which lead to
agrcssive nationalism.
Among the experts who have
accepted invitations to attend the
meetings are Prof. G. W. Allport
: (Harvard), Prof. Arne Naess(Oslo), Dr. John Rickman
(London), Dr. Henry Stack Sul-
livan (Washington), Dr. Alexand-
er Szalai (Budapest), Prof. Gil-
berto Freyre (Pernambuco, Bra-
zil) and Dr. Max Horkheimer
(New York).
stand in the way of this mutual
recognition of the common pur-
poses people everywhere have as
human beings.
Our program is now under way.
The words of the 1948 resolutions
are being transformed into con-
crete projects. Here are some of
our current undertaking :
For one thing, we are asking
social scientists in some twenty
countries to report for us on re-
search now under way that is rele-
vant to our problems. They will
let us know what people, organi-
zations and facilities are available
for potential cooperation. An-
other project will under way is
the preparation of a series of mo-
nographs through the Internatio-
nal Studies Conference with M.
Vernant in active charge. These
monographs are on the"Way of
Life"of many of the principal
peoples of the World. Four pilot
studies are now being prepared
and will be followed by similar
monographs in another dozen
coumries. At present the follow-
ing distinguished scholars are pre-
paring the first four books : Pro-
fessor Ludwik Gelberg (Poland).
Professor Frede Castberg (Nor-
way), M. Gabriel Ls Bras (Fran-
ce), M. Denis de Rougemont
(Switzerland).
In an attempt to discover what
conceptions people in one nation
have of themselves and of people-
in other nations we are planning
special studies on children and
adolescents, and surveys on stra-
tified samples of the adult popu-
lations in eight different coun-
tries. We are also engaging the
assistance of experts such as Dr.
H. E. O. James of the Institute of
Education, University of London,
who will help us gain a more ac-
curate picture of just how, and
under what conditions. the vari-
ous conceptions people have of
themselves and others develop
during the course of life.
We are maintaln1ng a clOse
working relationship with those
planning the International Con-
gress for Mental Health, which
will be held in London this sum-
mer. Members of the"Tensions
Project"secretariat will take an
active part in the conference. We
are also calling together a two
weeks meeting this year of 8-10
distinguished social scientists
from various countries to see if
they can state for us in general
terms what is now known about
human nature, and the conditions
that must obtain if national
aggressions are to be decreased,
and the principles that must be
followed to avoid serious tensions.
Those,. who have already indicated
that they will be able to accept
our invitations for this meeting
are : Professor Gordon W. Allport,
U. S. A. ; Dr. Gilbefto Freyre, Bra-
zil ; Professor Arne Naess, Nor-
way ; Dr. John Rickman, Great
Britain ; Dr. Henry Stack Sulli-
van, U. S. A
It is our hope that the results
of this meeting, as well as the
data and interpretations of some
of our other projects can be pub-
lished in book form.
Another area, of our activities
concerns tensions arising from
out suggestions or appeals
for help has been trea-
I L ted cynically oc cava-li rly.
Whatever our co7crete
- results may be t the
end of 1948 or 1949.
I repeat that perhaps the chief
value our project can have is that
of symbolising the emergence of
man's desire for co-operative self-
examination. So our very exist-
ence as a project seems to me an
encouraging sign, and a challenge
which no one in the human
sciences can refuse to take se-
riousty. whatever doctrinaire
approach he may currently fellow. I
Dr. Kuo Leaves
For Far East Tour
Dr. Kuo Yu-Shou, recently ap-
pointed Special Adviser on Asia
and the Far East, left Paris on
June 5 on a three-month mission
to ten Far Eastern countries.
Dr. Kuo will visit India, Pa-
kistan. Ceylon, Afghanistan, Bur-
ma, Siam, Indonesia, Philippines,
China and Japan.
His visit is aimed at strengthen-
ing relations between countries of
Asia and the Far East and ensur-
ing a wider knowledge of the
aims and programme of Unesco.
Dr. Kuo will represent Unesco at
the Third Session of the Econo-
mic Commission for Asia and the
Far East which began at Ootaca-
mund, Madras, early this month.

The third meeting of experts
on th* philosophical basis of the
Rights of Man will meet at
Unesco House from July 6 to 9.
Their work will consist in a study
of replies received to Unesco's
request for the views of leading
thinkers of th world on the sub-
ject. Selections will be mad ?
from these replies for publication
in a symposium.
graver, M. Georges Lay, the me-
dal was selected by Dr. Julian
Huxley, Director-General, from
among several designs presented.
The face displays Peace on
Earth, symbolized by a feminine
figure in relief holding a laurel
branch against the glob which
is encircled by the initials of
Unesco. The reverse of the me-
dal depicts a trilogy of allegorical
figures symbolizing the aims uf
Unesco in the fields of Educa-
tion, Science and Culture. This
side also displays the date of the
Constitutive Conference of Unes-
co, held in London in November,
1945.
The medal may be purchased
through the"Editions Françaises

in bronze is 360 francs, and jn
silver 2, 390 franca.
The appropriate allied autho-
rities will be invited by Unesco
to submit a review of their expe-
rience in the field of revision and
production of teaching materials
in Germany. These wilt be ana-
lyzed by Unesco experts on a
ccmparative basis, and the allied
authorities in turn will receive
in, formation on Unesco's work In
this field. Secretariat officials
will be available for consultation
on all problems concerning the
in : provement of textboks and
teaching materials
Unesco will also study pro-
blms involved in and the oppor-
tunities existing for the excnange
of persons between Germany and
o'her countries. A questIOnnaire
will be sent to the appropriate
allied authorities in Germany
and all States throughout the
world requesting that thev sup-
ply available information on the
question. A full report. based on
thy replies to the questionnaire,
will be published in a register of
international fellowships early in

German experts will be invi-
ted to attend certain technical
meetings called by Unesco, with
the exception of seminars.

was outlined and a budget of
approximately $300. 000 was set
for the first year of the Institu-
te's operation. A financial proto-
co ! was also signed by Bolivia.,
Brazil, Colombia, Ecuador, France,
Holland. Peru and Venezuela,
which determined the scale of
national contributions toward fi-
nancing the Institute.
Observers from the United Sta-
tes and the United Kingdom
expressed great interest in the
Institute, and will study ways of
bringing about active partlcJ : pa-
tien by their countries.
At the opening session on April
30, Dr. Linneu Albuquerque de
MeIIo'Brazil) and Dr. Rafael
Alvarado (Ecuador) were elected
'Vice-Presidents.
The Conference recommended
that Manaus be es : ablished as
the seat of the IIHA because of
its geograpJ : 1ical situation and
teat centres of study should be
developed in Belém (Brazil) to
cover the Lower Amazon, in Iqui-
tos (Peru) for the Upper Amazon,
in San Fernando de Atabapo (Ve-
nezuela) for the northern region,
in Riberalta (Bolivia) for the
southern region, and in Archi-
dona (Ecuador) and Sibundoy
(Colombia). It was clearly un-
derstood that although the seat
of the IIHA would be in Manaus,
the actual work of the Institute
would be conducted in various
part.  of the Hylean Amazon. Re-
commendations were made for an
initial survey to be undertaken
in the Rio Huallaga valley in
Peru
O the $300. 000 budget propo-
sed for the first year of the Ins-
titute, Brazil has been assessed
150. 000 dollars, Colombia and Peru
$40000 each, Venezuela $25. 000,
France $15. 000, Bolivia $9. 000 and
Ecuador and Holland $5. 000 each ;
At the close of the Iquitos Con-
ference the Brazilian Government
provided air transport from Iqui-
tos to Manal1S for the first meet-
ing of the Interim Commission
of the IIHA which lasted for five
days from May 13 to May 17.
The work of the Commission
was mainly. technical. It concen-
trated its attention on the deli-
mitation of the area of the Hy-
lean Amazon, the setting up of
a secretariat for the Commission,
its finance and duties. The com-
mission confirmed Manaus as the
seat of the IIHA and arranged
that, while the Director-General
of Unesco should be asked to fi-
nance the secretariat in 1948. the
member nations of the Interim
Commission would undertake the
responsibility of continuing the
secretariat in 1949 at their own
expense. It recommended the
appointment of E. J. H. Corner,
Principal Field Science Coopera-
tion Officer in charge of Unesco's
Latin-American F. S. C. O., as Exe-
cutive Secretary.

CONFLICTING NATIONAL LAWS
[On June 6 a twenty-day Conference for the Revisian af the Berne

Gavernment and the International Berne Bureau. M, Jean Thomas,
Assistant Director-General and M. François Hepp, copyright spec'ali[1i.

we publish bellow an article by M. Hepp on the prablems af inter-
national capyright and Unesro's aims in seeking an answer 10'these
Foblems. ]
of all forms of proprietarvrights, the rights of lit r ry
and artistic property were the
slowest in achieving legal reco-
gnition. It is less than two cen-
turies since such rights were first
admitted by law givers. Even today.
on the international level at least,
these rights are the most. difficult
to exercise and their protection
most uncertain.
In point of fact it is less the
lack of any copyright law than
the multiplicity of discordant sys-
tems which lies at the root of
many difficulties still found in
the application of the principle of
copyrigh t.
But here we come up against
two difficulties, the first being
the non-recognition of foreign
copyright by certain countries.

try, but gener-

been made to remedy the diffi-
culty through international con-
ventions. and partial success has
been obtained ; but these conv2n-
tions are not in agreement on all
points and there are frequent va-
riations between them, both'as
regards their provisions, and as
regards the individuals for whom
they provide.
Thus, when a, work is exported
from one country to another, we
find that the legal protection af-
forded in one is either lost in the
other, or, at the least, varies pro-
foundly from country to country.
The real obstacles to overcome
our, rather, the source of these
obstacles, are gaps in the law,
complexity, or in short, copyright
anarchy. How are we to surmount
this ? It is no answer to ride
rough-shod over copyright, as
some think.
An 18th century writer has said
that if you destroy the springs
you must not grumble at having
nothing to drink.
What we really have to do is
to adapt copyright to the requi-
rements of the new means of dis-
seminating thought. To resolve
the harmful anarchy of present
international legislation we must
standardize, if we do not unify,
that legislation on modern bases
of universal application.
This is what Unesco seeks to do
in the near future, with a vivid
sense of thet-urgency of the task.
But there is still a third cause
of disagreement which is the lo-
gical result of the first two : igno-
rance
In too many cases authors.
do not know the precise scope of I
their rights or obligations, nor
what steps they should take to
protect the one and comply with
the other.
A few short examples will de-
monstrate this :
In many countries it is essential
to carry out copyright formalities
which in some cases are simple
enough, but in others highly
complex, while in many cases
their cost is prohibitive. Unless
these formalities are complied
with. and within a time limit.
the law authorizes the appropria-
tion of an idea. This is the case,
for example, in U. S. copyright ; it
is the same regarding the filing
with the Argentine national re-
gister of contracts for translation.
Again, the applied arts have
no artistic protection under Amer-
ican law. but are so protected in
many other countries. The law
varies even within the Berne
Union. The rules for press copy-
right, photographic copyright, ci-
nema copyright and radio copy-
right vary from country to coun-
try. Certain countries afford pro-
tection to performing artists, in
By
some cases on the same footing as
the creative artist, in others by
affording their work special pro-
tection as an adaptation, and in
others again under the terms of
a different but parallel law.
The same is true of the legal
enactments protecting transla-
tions.
Thus it may happen that an
American, acting in good faith
but lacking exaèt information.
may find that certain of his
rights are not protected in Eu-
rope, unless he takes certain con-
tractual precautions, while, on
the other hand, without his know-
ing it, other rights, unrecognised
by his own national law, are pro-
tected.
Similarly the European in
America may believe himself
fully protected, but have no such
protection un-

-..--------.- For this rea-
son radio trans-
mitting stations have to maintain
an extremely costly legal branch
and in many cases have to
withhold transmissions of works
where they are not entirely clear
as to the legal position, or
withhold authority for relays and
re-transmissions by foreign sta-
tions.
There are other examples : the
proprietor of a French newspaper
owns the copyright of articles
published in his paper, while the
author of the article owns the
rights for other means of publi-
cation (e. g. collected volumes) and
no further formalities. are ne-
cessary.
But if a work is published
without the explicit retention of
rights in some countries, or in
others without legal deposit-e. g.. 
in Turkey deposit at the end of
the year-anyone can reproduce
or translate it without seeking
authority. All the countries of the
Middle and Far East can repro-
duce such works without restric-
tion ; the same is true in the
U. S. S. R. ; the same is true in the
Argentine Republic if the legal
deposit has not been effected, or
in the United States if the copy-
right has not been filed at
Washington.
Similarly an European painter
who sells his pictures to galleries
throughout the world, finds that
there are wide variations in the
rules concerning the rights of re-
production. If he sells his works
in France he retains the right of
reproduction and the gallery must
seek his authority for this. If he
sells his works in America, the
mere fact of selling them deprives
him of the right of reproduction.
If he sells them in England he
loses or retains the rights of re-
production as provided in the bill
of sale. But if no provision has
been made in this respect he may
be found, in fact. to have lost.
or have retained such right ac-
cording to the decision of the
courts on the particular cir-
cumstances.
These few examples show that
for most authors, technicians, or
business men, even the most ex-
perienced, this is a labyrinth
with no Ariadne to provide the
thread.
Unesco wants to be the Ariadne
in this strange and perilous
scene. Without seeking to require,
the various sovereign states to
modify their own laws, the Or-
ganization invites them to con-
sider realistically, practically and
in good faith, the possibility of
reaching agreement on certain
major principles of sense, justice.
honesty and practical utility, and
to consider their universal adop-
tion so as to secure their strict
observance thereafter on a world
scale.
LOW-PRICED BOOKS
A Neglected MediufJJ
.. ; ; ;. :'r-" l
of Mass Communication
PRESS, film and radio are gen-orally first thought of as the
chief media of mass com-
munication, and these three have
certainly shown their importance
in influencing-for good or bad-
the minds of men during the last
decades.
But the book is often forgotten
in this connection, due to the con-
servatism of the book publishing
trade. Book publishing has on the
whole adapted itself less well to
contemporary needs than the
modern forms of mass media.
The low-priced book is ideaily
suited to meet the steadily in-
creasing mass demand for access
to factual information, vie. ws and
opinions. The results obtained by
pioneer publishers in this field
are proof enough. It is also cer-
tain that the potentiality of the
cheap book as a means for a
wider exchange of views and opi-
nions inside and across national
frontiers and for the raising of
educational standards generally
has not often been fully realised.

publishers in Poland, Great Britain, Franc". Mexico, Argentina and
the United States.

Director-General's tour was aimed
at encouraging fuU participation
in the Third Session of Unesco's
General Conference which is
schduled to be held in But
this October, and at stimulatine
interests in the work and aims of
Unesco.
During his five-weeks'tour,
Dr. Huxley visited Istanbul, An-

Baghdad, Teheran, Cairo and Tu-
nis.
In all the oountries visited, the
Director-General was received by
top educational, scientific and
cultural leaders who expressed
their desire to cho-ordinate their
work along the lines of Unesco's
aims.
As a result of Dr. Huxley's visit
it is hoped that Turkey and Le-
banon will set up Unesco Na'io-
nal Commissions and that Iraq
will shortly ratify the Constitu-
tion.
In Tunis, Dr. Huxley was met
by Professor Jean Thomas, Assis-

Dr. Charles Malik, chairman of
the United Nations Economic and
Social Council, and long an advo-
cate of the measures which the
committee set up, emphasized the
permanent and profound signifi-
cance of the project of transla-
tions in a message which he sent
to the Director-General for the
opening of the Expert Committee
meetings."Certain nations and
cultural groups", he wrote."are
dangerously deficient in know-

ture of other peoples. This cultu-
ral inequality In respect to the
ultimate Questions of truth, beau-
ty and the value of social ideals
is a profound cause of'misun-

He stressed the cardinal service
which Unesco could perform by
means of this programme, which.
he feels."will render greater ser-
vice to peace and understanding
than most of the political activity
going on at present".

outstanding results have been
achieved in cheap book publish-
ing in many countries. The Pen-
guin, Home University Library
and Everyman series in Britain.
Pocket books, the Modern Library
series and Bantam books in the
United States, Russian mass-
produced books, only to mention
a few examples, show what can
be done. The experiences already
made by the leading publishers
in this field serve as a starting
point for further exploration and
study.
The implication of the techno-
logical revolution of our time, the
current political and social issr. es.
the place of arts and letters in
society, our cultural hentage, the
contribution of different coun-
tries and cultures to, world civili-
sation, all these are examples of
tnemes that actively interest a.
large number of citizens in many
countries. Their demand for gui-
dance in these matters must be
met In an intelligent and intelligi-
ble way, their interest acknowledg-'"
ed and further stimulated.
What subjects need to be
treated in a way suitable for
inclusion in. cheap book series ?
What subjects can be treated in
this way ? To what extent can
authors consciously address the
masses ?
Scores of questions of this type
emerge as soon as one starts to
think over the cheap book prob-
lem, and some of the answers
will probably be given by an
analysis of the assembled ex-
periences and opinions of experts.
Unesco does not wish to enter
into the publishing field : it
wishes to co-operate in the many
excellent efforts now being made
and through the factual infor-
mation and expert opinions as-
sembled in Unesco to help with
advice to get more cheap books
of cultural value out on the, world
market.
The subject, as mentioned
above, is the first point to con-
sider. But style is as important
as subject matter. The standard
book on the principle of
internat. ional arbitration is more
likely than not to be tho-
roughly unsuited to mass circula-
tion because of its academic lan-
guage. But if the subjects is of
general interest there is no reason
why the same theme should not
be treated in a popular way and
be read and discussed by thous-
ands of people. It is up to the
publisher to find the right man
for the job, to assist him by giv-
ing him general directives based
on the very special experience
of cheap book publishing.
The ordinary type or cheap
paper-bound book, for instance,
is not really cheap for the pUbEc
library, as it. cannot in most &I3ë'S
be rebound because of its narrow
margin. Consequently it goes out
of service very quickly and has
to-be replaced. It might be po. -
sible to encourage publishers to
produce cheap books in two edi-
tions-one for sale to the public ;
another for library use.
The popular demand for good
books has in most countries far
outgrown the supply-not only
because of technical shortages
and deficiencies, but mainlv be-
cause of lack Of imagination on
the part of responsible author-
ities, authors and publishers.
Trevelyan's"Social history of
England"sells almost as well as
"Gone. with the Wind."In Nor-
way the Phaidon edition of Van
Gogh's reproductions sold more
than 50, 000 copies and in Sweden
Mumford's"Condition of Man"
is now a good seller. Books
written and produced for the
mass of the people form part
. 0 f the increasingly-accepted
human right of equal access to
educational opportunities, and it
is among Unesco's tasks to ad-
vocates and emphasise this point.
Unesco's main task in the cheap
book field, well therefore be to
enlist the active support of pro-
gressive publishers, writers, edu-
cators, and librarians to spotlight
the need for the full utilisation of
the book as a medium of mass
communication.

TEACHING ABOUT THE U
11= VERY boy and girl shouldlearn about the United Na-
tions system as an essential
part of his or her education-this
is the main recommendations in a
pamphlet entitled''Teaching
about the U. N.-Some Suggestions
and Recommendations", which
has just been published by the
Education Section of Unesco.
This 10-page booklet will be
presented for discussion at the
Eleventh Internat : onal Confe-
rence on Public Education, called
by the International Bureau of
Education and by Unesco, and to
be held in Geneva at the end of
June. Later it will be considered
by the various Unesco Seminars
meeting this summer.
The report covers a. wide field.
It begins by defining briefly why
teaching about the United Nations
system is important.
It tries to answer some of the
questions which teachers in many
parts of the world find puzzling.
At what age, many of them ask,
can instruction on the United
Nations usefully begin ? It suggests
that with young children it is
most important to develop"atti-
tudes of co-operation, friendliness
and fair play and the development
of skill in learning to live together
and to assume responsibility". Pro-
grammes of instruction must, it
points out, be varied according to
age levels. Accounts follow,
showing how education can be
adapted from simple lessons of
co-operation for very young chil-
dren up to more direct teaching
for adolescents.
In many parts of the world
teachers are asking what special
means have proved most successful
in presenting the United Nations
outside the classroom. The booklet
describes briefly the use that can
be made of bulletin boards, of
school assemblies, of clubs and
study groups, of model assemblies
of the United Nations, of school
publications, of special contests, 0
celebrations and of activities such
s1s : onal voluntary work j
camps.
Another problem is how to train'
teachers who will know how to
present the work of the United
Nations in relation to other efforts
to achieve a better world society.
Since the school is not the only
agent concerned with the educa-
tion of children and young people,
proposals are made for enlisting
the help of the local community.
It is recommended that local orga-
nizations. public libraries, mu-
seums, the local press, radio sta-
tions and theatres should be used
as far as possible to assist in
presenting the United Nations and
its Specialized Agencies to school
children.
The final sections of the pam-
phlet cover the need for suitable
materials and for encouragement
and assistance from Ministries of
Education and educational autho-
rities.
In a much fuller form, this do-
cument will be presented to the
next Unesco General Conference.
Then if approved, it may become
an official Unesco statement on
the subject.
Students Learn of UN
in Unesco Member States
N the summer of 1947, enve-lopes of varying bulk were
delivered to Unesco in Paris
from many different corners of
the world-from the tiny Domini-
can Republic to the vast terri-
tories of India and China. Their
contents had a common purpose-
to report on what was being done
in schools to teach about the
United Nations and its Agencies.
The reports came in response to
a questionnaire which had been
sent out to Member States in
April, 1947. By the end of the year,
twenty-one countries had replied.
The following extracts from this
round the world survey give some
idea of the extent of the teaching :
Australia : Teaching is generally
confined to secondary schools and
universities, but in Victoria chil-
dren as young as ten years have
some lessons on the United Na-
tions. Outside the classroom, clubs
for the discussion of international
affairs are encouraged, and speak-
ers have been invited to talk in
the schools on the United Nations.
The work of the U. N. has been
included in the Australian Broad-
casting Company's programme
"The World in Which We Live".
Austria : A study of the U. N. is
included within the framework of
regular school sub. iects. At the
time of the report, educational
groups were planning to in-
crease the teaching, working in
close connection with the Austrian
League for the United Nations. On
June 26th. every school celebrated
United Nations Day.
Belgium : Some studv of the
U. N. is included in the regular
school courses, and in the courses
taken in the teacher training col-
leges. Groups for discussion of cur-
rent events have been formed in
the secondary schools, and the
school broadcasting system has in-
cluded the United Nations in its
programmes.
United Nations Day was cele-
brated in the schools, and pam-
phlets are being prepared specially
for school children and students.
Canada : In the different pro-
vinces of Canada a varying
amount of instruction is given in
the higher grades of the school.
"Bulletins for Teachers"include
references to the U. N.. and the
importance of the study was stres-
sed at the Teachers'Annual Con-
vention in 1947. School broadcasts
and"United Nations Programmes"
in the schools. have been arranged
to stimulate international under-
standing.
China : Special recommendations
have been made to teachers by the
Ministry of Education to use the
courses in languages, history and
civics as a means of spreading in-
formation about the U. N. Plans
for increasing the study have al-
ready been made, in which the
Ministry of Education is co-ope-
rating with the Unesco National
Commission.
Czechoslovakia : At the time of
the report, no special texts on U. N.
had been produced for schools, but.
every child and young person from
the age of twelve to eighteen has
some instruction within the fra-
mework of other lessons.
Denmark : The winning papers
of a competition arranged by the
Danish Teachers'Organization
and the Danish United Nations
Association have been published
for use as background material
for the study of U. N. in primary
and secondary schools.
France : Plans have been made
by the Ministry of Education to
include the United Nations in its
programme of lectures, and to en-
courage the forming of interna-
tional clubs and societies. A weekly
column on international problems,
with special reference to the
United Nations and its Agencies,
is to be published in the magazine,
"Education nationale".
India : November 29th was cele-
brated widely in India as Unesco
Day. Special school broadcasts
were arranged On Unesco for that
day, and exhibitions and film
shows were arranged in several
provinces.
New Zealand : Every pupil in
the post-primary schools takes a
course in social studies, which in-
cludes ome work on the League
of Nations and the United Na-
tions. Most of the schools have a
weekly current events session,
which covers news of the U. N.
Norway : Some mention of the
United Nations is included in the
new textbooks used by Norwegian
children from seven to fourteen
years, and considerable material
is included in the books for pupiL-
from fourteen to nineteen vears.
A pamphlet on the U. N. has been
issued specially for use in schools.
United Kingdom : Much of the
teaching on the United Nations is
included in current events classes.
and in individual schools and
youth organizations group projects
have been carried out with great
interest. The Council of Education
for World Citizenship-a national
voluntary organization-has been
very active in stimulating the in-
terest of both students and
teachers in international affairs
and U. N. in particular. The Coun-
cil has published study guides
and pamphlets such as the booklet
"Unesco-What it Is and What it
Does", and arranged conferences
and lectures which have been at-
tended by thousands of school
children. School broadcasts are
widely used andencourage interest
in current events.
United States : A study of the
United Nations is finding a
regular place in the curricula of
many secondary schools, especially
in courses in world history and
current history. Study courses
have been drafted and model as-
semblies held, and the radio is
used to advantage in discuss : ons.
Libraries and museums in some
districts have cho-operated in plan-
ning exhibitions on U. N.. and a
large number of books and pam-
phlets have been published for
students and teachers. Films and
filmstrips on the subject of United
Nations are used in many of the
school systems, as well as charts
and photospreads.
Bibliographie on UN
and its Agencies
An extensive bibliography of
books and pamphlets in English
on"Education for International
Understanding and on the United
Nations"has just been issued by
the Exchange of Information and
Education Sections of Unesco. It
is now available for distribution
free of charge and should be use-
ful to teachers, librarians, students
of international affairs, and others
interested in the United Nations.
It may be obtained by writing to
Unesco, 19 Avenue Kleber, Paris
16e.
A similar bibliography in lan-
guages other than English is being
prepared and will be issued
shortly.
The publication just issued not
only lists important books and
pamphlets in several fields, but
also includes brief factual anno-
tations.
Part I of the bibliography is
devoted to the United Nations and
its Specialized Agencies. Small
sections are devoted to the Eco-
nomic and Social Council, the
International Court of Justice, the
Security Council, the Trusteeship
Council, the Atomic Energy Com-
mission, while other parts are
given over to bibliographies and
general publications on the United
Nations. Each of the Specialized
Agencies is then treated sepa-
rately.
Part II treats the topic of Edu-
cation for International Under-
standing, and is followed in Part
II by # :'le more specific subject of
Education for International Un-
derstanding in the Schools.
The final Part is a bibliography
on Teaching about the United Na-
tions in the schools. This list in-
cludes materials for teachers and
references to the few materials
which exist for pupils.
Most of the titles are of fairly
recent publications and should be
available for purchase. A few
books are of older date but are
included because of their parti-
cular interest. and value. The
source is listed for publications
which may not be obtained easily.

From the U. S. A. comes a num-
ber of publications printed spe-
cially for schools. The University
of Nebraska, has produced Unesco
and Nebraska Secondary School
Youth, a handbook of recommen-
dations for teachers on how to
present Unesco in and outside the
classroom. In addition to the ac-
count of tithe structure and pur-
poses of Unesco there is a detailed
list of study outlines, suggestions
for correlating the work y.'ith other
subjects, and original ideas for
enlivening the study.
One World in the Making by
William G. Carr, is a textbook for
school children, emphasizing the
United Nations Charter. Difficult
phrases are explained in marginal
notes, and it is illustrated with
charts and maps, and a reproduc-
lion of the signatures to the
Charter.
"Senior Scholastic", a magazine
for secondary schools pupils, has
devoted one entire issue to the
United Nations, entitled United
Nations in Action-A Student's
Handbook of the World Organi-
cation.
Another United Nations hand-
book for school students is pu-
blished by the American Education
Press.-Bssides articles, photo-
graphs and explanatory notes, it
gives lists of questions at the end
of each section, and pinpoints im-
portant facts. There are also sug-
gestions for forum discussions.

petition on Unesco's Work". The
first. will be open to those between
15 and 18 years of age, and the
second to those from 12 to 15.
Entries may be submitted in either
of two forms : an essay of between
1. 000 and 2, 000 words, or a poster
not exceeding 48x66 cms.
To allow plenty of time for the
competitions to be made known all
over the world, and to take into
account the differences in the aca-
demic year of the northern and
southern hemispheres, Unesco has
suggested that Member States an-
nounce the competitions in Sep--
tembe : o'October, 1948, and ask
for entries to be submitted to
them by May 1st, 1949.
The first preliminary selection
of winning essays and posterns will
be made nationally. Then each
Member State is asked to send to
Unesco by airmail not later than
July 1st, 1949. the ten best entries
in each competition.
The'final awards will be made
for Unesco by a panel of interna-
tionally-known men and women
selected by the Director-General.
The results will be announced
before the Unesco General Confe-
rence meets in 1949.
The prizes will be awarded in
the form of grants to enable the
, winners either to travel abroad. to
attend a conference on word af-
fairs, to acquire further education
(if possible in another country),
or to purchase books and other
educational material. ;
In the first competition, the
- first prize for an essay will be
$250, and the same for the win-
ning poster ;, he second ror'_ze will
be $200 for the essay and $200 for
the poster. There will be 8 addi-
tional prizes of $50 each. In the
second competition, the first prize
for the essay will be $150 and the
same for the poster ; the second
prize will be $100 for the essay
and $100 for the poster. Again
there wíl1 be 8 additional prizes
of $50 each.
It is hoped that other prizes. will
be offered by the government, or
by interested organizations or in-
dividuals in the Member States.
Unesco suggest that where this
can be done it may be, worthwhile
to propose a third form that the
competition might take. It is
thought that in some schools a
welcome alternative to the pro-
duction of essays or posters might
be a group project consisting, for
example, in writing a play on
Unesco's work, in making a scrap
book of articles, or in constructing
a model illustrating one of Unes-
co's activities. Because of the diffi-
culty of making an international
award for projects of this kind,
Unesco is not suggesting this as
the third form in its own scheme.
Special materials to give young
people the necessary information
about Unesco are obviously essen-
tial and pamphlets are being pre-
pared in the Education Section of
Unesco to meet this need.
It is expected that a selection
of the essays and posters. will be
reproduced in connection with
Unesco publicity, and it is hoped
that an exhibition of them can be
shown at the Fourth Session of
the General Conference in 1949.

..., IL ET'S VISIT UNESCO
HOUSE"is the title
of a pamphlet which
Unesco will publish soon for boys
and girls between 12 and 15 years
of age. It has been prepared by
Mr Leonard Kenworthy, of the
Education Section, to provide in-
formation for school pupi ; s en-
tering for an Essav and Poster
Competition on Unesco. It has an
attractive red and white cover,
and its 30 pages are illustrated
with nearly 60 photographs, charts
and maps.
It describes how an imaginary
party of children from many na-
tions meet at Unesco House in
Paris. Some of them have arrived
on bicycles, by bus, or by train ;
others by boat, and a few by air.
They have come to visit one of
the few international houses in
the world.
As soon as they arrive, they are
welcomed by a guide who takes
them around the building, and
explains what the people working
there are trying to do. The party
attends a meeting of the Executive
Board, is welcomed by Dr. Huxley
in his office, and visits the heads
of different departments to ask
them questions about Unesco's
programme..
For older boys and girls another
pamphlet haS"been written by Miss
Monica Luffman of the Education
Section, entitled"You and Unes-
co". As being of particular inte-
rest to young people, Unesco's re-
construction work, its educational
activities, its scientific programme,
and its efforts to help people all
over the world to exchange ideas,
have been stressed. Each chapter
of this 40 page pamphlet is fol-
lowed by five or six questions to
encourage the readers to think for
themselves. It is being printed in
black and white, with a cover in
two colours, and illustrated with
some 40 photographs, diagrams,
and maps.
Specimen copies of both pam-
phlets will be sent to Member
States of Unesco at the beginjþng
of July. It is hoped that they will
then be translated where necessary
and re-published for wide distri-
bution.

. UNESCO COURIER Volume I.-No S
Experts who attended recent meeting on Art in General Education : From left to right : A. H. Cor-
rea de Azevedo and Dr. Kuo Yu-Shu of Unesco ; M. ZoItan Kodaly (Hungary) ; Herbert Read (UK !,
Chairman ; Dr. Thomas Munro (US) ; M. Georges Fare (France) ; Mr. E. M. Dicky (UK) of th*
Ministry of Education.
SOME BLUNT WORLDS
FROM-CRITIC READ
[The following interview expresses certain opinions with which
the editors of the"Unesco Courier"caIUlot agree. We feel, however,
that Mr Read's observations rpresent an attitude which is fairly
frequent among the world's intellectual, particularly among belte-
lettrists. As such, we present them in the hope that they will stimulate
diseussion. ]
MAR. HERBERT READ, noted British philosopher of art, and authorsof several books on art and aesthetics, granted a special inters ; sew
on May 15 to the"Unesco Courier", during which he criticized Unesco
and its Constitution, though affirming his belief in the importance of
its role in the world today. Dr. Read came to Paris last month to
preside over the meeting of ex-_.,,,...... _...,
perts on Art in General Educa-
tion which met at Unesco House
from May 11 to 15.
"Any criticisms I make of
Unesco", Mr Read began,"are
based own a desire to co-operate.
They are not inspired by any
fundamental animosity 10 the
aims of Unesco."
"At the same time", Mr Read
continued,"I do feel that a cer-
tain presupposition about the
nature of culture and the means
of promoting it have been made
which are fallacious. The false
assumption to which I refer, and
which seems to be present in the
Constitution of Unesco, is that
culture is something ready-made,
already formulated and develop-
ed, and has merely got to be
shared by the largest part of the
people in order to bring about a
peaceful state of the world."
"Root Simulation"
"But culture and civilization
are a growth, a creative process,
an activity. Our aim should be to
stimulate that activity at the
roots. This'root stimulation',
ho. wever, involves an activity not
contelllplated in the Constitution
of Unesco. The energies of
Unesco are being dissipate in
intellectual and organizational
activities which are seldom con-
crete in their results."
"The most effective way of
changing the minds of men IS
through education. Yet educe ; join
must be understood in a sense
not evident in the Constitution
of Unesco since it interprets edu-
cation in a spirit of intellec-
tualism and scientific humanism.
I feel that education, to be ef-
fective, must be much more'ac-
tivist', relying more on practical
and creative activities and ess
on book knowledge and literacy."
Anasthesia
"Unesco ignores this problem",
he went on."But in my opinion,
more serious than illiteracy 15
the problem of anesthesia'-that
is lack of taste ant sensitivity
which affects not 10 to 15% but
90% of the population of the
world."
"Unesco's work", Mr Read con-
tinued,"should be aimed more at I
people than at ideas. It should'
establish practical institutions
rather than communities of good-
will and this should be done on
a I>ig scale."
"I suggest for example", he
said.''the creation of an Institute
of Experimental Education, where
new methods of education would
be demonstrated and where
teachers could come to leam of
progressive methods of educa-
tion."
Criticizing the distinction made
in the title of Unesco between
Education, Science and Culture,
Mr Read cited T. S. Eliot's phrase
'Science and education are in
themselves a part of culture.'
"If you separate science and
education from. culture", Mr
Read declared,"why not dis-
tinguish art and religion ? The
very fact that science and edu-
cation were picked out by Unesco
reveals a bias-perhaps an un-
conscious bias-in the minds of
those who established it. That
science is distinct from culture is
a modern development which to
the Greek philosopher would
have seemed quite monstrous. It
represents a materialistic point of
view of civilization which is sus-
picious of the world culture and
seeks to correct it or counter-
balance it with the term scten-
tific."
Turning to three of the cultural
projects in which is
playing an important rove, Mr
Read cited the International
Theatre Institute, the programme
for the translation of the classics
and copyright.
"I believe", he said,"that the
circulation of theatrical produc-
tions on an international scale
may gradually stimulate The
dramatic activity. But even here.
I think the effective form of
stimulation is due not to the cir-
culation of mastenpieces by them-
selves, but rather to the encou-
ragement of creative effort on
the amateur levels."
In conclusion, Mr Read re-
affirmed his belief in the work of
Unesco.
"I believe an organizat : on on
the lines of Unesco to be es-
sential", he said."If we do not
agree with the Constitution and
Unesco's procedure, we must not
stand aside and merely condemn,
but at any rate make an effort
to transform it. If one has any
belief in peace and the future of
world culture, an organization of
this kind is essential and must
be criticized until it does its job
more and more effectively."
Chinese Edllcator Named
Unesco Representative ?
Professor Chen Yuan, promi.
nent Chinese educator and since
1940 a member of the People's
Political Council, has been ap-
pointed Chinese Representative to
Unesco.
Professor Ohen has been for the
past two years a member of the
Unesco Executive Board and in
this capacity has been closely
associated with the activities of
the Organization. His appoint-
ment as Chinese Representative
at Unesco House in Paris was an-
nounced by the Chinese Ministry
of Education.
Born in 1896, Professor Ohen
was educated in China and in
Great Britain. He was successive-
ly Professor at the National
Peking University in Peiping, and
at Wuhan University i « Wuchang.
Before the war be was Dean of
the College of Arts at Wuhan. He
has public. shed several volumes of
essays and translations into
Chinese.
Call for Better
Art Education
THE development of the placeof the arts in general edu-
cation programmes throughout
the world and the better utiliza-
tion of art for strengthening in-
ternational and inter-cultural un-
derstanding was urged during a
meeting of experts at Unesco
House in Paris last month.
Called by Unesco for a five-day
conference (May 11-15) to study
the role of art in general educa-
tion, the expocts recommended
the creation of National Commit-
tees in each Member State. Such
committees would stimulate the
, improvement and expansion of
art instruction in school and
adult education.
The recommendations of the
expert panel are at present under
study by Unesco and will be con-
sidered when the Organization
submits a draft programme in
this. 3 field to its forty-one Member
States. Proposals included the
establishment by Unesco of an
International Council for the
Arts in General Education to he
supported by the National Com-
mittees in each country.
Such an International Council,
the experts declared, would serve
as a focal clearing-house lor ten.
fermation regarding improved
methods for teaching the arts
the circulation of exhibitions.
translation and publication of
important books and articles in
th ? field. It would also promote
international federations of tea-
chers and students on a scho-
larship basis.
Dr. Herbert Read (United King-
dom) presided over the meetings
and Dr. Thomas Munro (United
States) was Rapporteur. Other
experts present included M. Geor
ge3 Favre (France) and M. Zol-
tan Kodaly (Hungary). Mr. E. M.
Dicky, representing the British
Mini : fry of Education, was also
present.
The Role of France
In the I. T. 1..-
T AST summer, twenty-four- *-'theatre experts from fourteen
different countries came together
at Unesco's suggestion to plan an
International Theatre Institute.
The decisions they took and the
objectives they set themselves last
year have been carried out. In a
few weeks'time their. goal will
have been reached.
The experts had recommended
the establishment of an Interna-
tional Theatre Institute, indepen-
dent of Unesco and supported by
National Centres which reflected
as faithfully as possible the
theatre life of each nation.
By
Armand SALACROU
Noted French Playwright,
Member of the Executive
Committee of the ITI and
President of French Na-
tional Theatre Centre.
A truly international institute
representing the world's theatre-
that was the idea on which the
ITI was based. To make it so, all
members of Unesco as well as the
United Nations were invited to
attend the Constituent Congress
of 1948. The setting up of truly
representative National Theatre
Centres was also recommended.
Eight such National Centres are
now functioning.
It may be of interest to indi-
cate how we, in France, proceed-
ed.
First of all we set up a Theatre
Committee made up of 30 mem-
bers, on the model of the French
National Commission for Unesco.
The Theatre Committee consists
of four high officials and seven-
teen distinguished personalities
elected by the French theatre as-
sociations (the National Theatre
Federation, the Society of Authors
and the various trade unions re-
presenting writers, directors, act-
ors, producers and so on). In turn,
these twenty-one members of the'
Theatre Committee named nine
prominent theatre men to form
part of the Committee.
In this way, it was felt, the
French Theatre Committee would
truly represent all of the Theatri-
cal activities of France and thus
be able to study all theatre ques-
tions arising in France. At the
same time such a Committee
would be able to offer practical
solutions to the international pro-
blems which twill be discussed at
the Prague Congress.
Naturally there are many pro-
blems and some, at the moment,
cannot be solved. The first pro-
blem, that of the legal constitu-*
tion of the International Theatre
Institute, wille be eliminated once
the draft Charter, drawn up by
the experts in 1947, has been
examined and finally adopted.
But then a host of other pro-
blems win come up.
Painters and musicians are
more fortunate than we of the
theatre : their language is inter-
national. We, however, must con-
tend, not only with translation
problems but with customs diffi-
culties, passport complications,
and the financial risks in sending
theatrical troupes abroad. Making
theatre news available on an in-
ternational scale also poses a
serious, highly complicated pro-
blem.
French Role
at Prague Congress
At Prague, the French Delega-
tion will pursue a policy of
obstinate moderation. It is con-
vinced that the more modest but
effective the work of the Congress
the greater the chances will be for
a living Institute. The French
Delegation will try, therefore, to
keep to concrete facts and will
urge the adoption of only those
projects that can actually be
carried out under present world
conditions.
At the end of May, the following
countries had made known their in-
tention to be represented at the
First Congress of the. t. T t, to be
held in Prague from June 28 to
July 3 :
Austria. Australia, Brazi !, Bet-
gium, Chits, China, Egrypt, Finland,
France, Haiti. Hungary, Italy.
Luxembourg. Switzerland, United
Kingdom. United States, Union of
South Africa.
This is not to say that we do
not doubt that the International
Institute has a great future. We
think, indeed, that the birth of
the Institute, of itself, is concrete
proof of a great enterprise : In
Prague, the centre of poor, ruined
Europe, men of the theatre from
all countries, from Finland, and"
South America, from the Soviet-
Russia and the United States will
meet to study common problems,
exchange information, form
friendships and embark upon a
constructive task in the interests
of human culture. Is not this, in
the year 19<18, a great achieve-
ment ?
And the congresses which will
permit theatre representatives
from all over the word to meet
in a different capital each year
- do not these of themselves jus-
tify the Institute IWhich is to be
created in Prague in the next few
weeks ?
Unesco Friendship Train
(Continued from Page 1.)
Among the noted speakers who
addressed the plenary sessions
were George V. Allen, U. S. Assis-
tant Secretary of State for Pub-
lic Affairs, William G. Carr of
the U. S. National Education As-
sociation, George V. Stoddard,
President of the University of
Illinois, Vera Micheles Dean if
the Foreign Policy Association
and Margaret Mead, anthropolo-
gist of the American Museums-'f
Natural History.
"What Unesco needs, if it is to
accomplish anything, is co-opera-
tion of organizations and colleges
and schools and local groups and
individuals all over the world,"
Mr Allen said at the opening. ses-
sion of the Conference."We have
charted a course of international
co-operation,"he continued."The
pursuit of that course is fraught
with difficulties... The faith
in which Unesco was created is
the faith which animates us to-
day. The Governement of the
United States reaffirms that this
country will continue to work
with all other countries which
share this faith to achieve the
objectiVe5 set forth in the consti-
tution of Unesco."
"William Carr told the 3, 000 dele-
gates that the task before them was
to overcome the sense of futility.
the sense of benumbed resignation
with which all too many of our
people look upon the current in-
ternational scene... The task
is to call the American people to
wage the peace. We must get
down to such practical questions
as educational reconstruction, stu-
dent and teacher exchange, revi-
sion of textbooks, co-operative
scientific investigations, interna-
tional systems of library refer-
ences, international use of ra-
dio..."
Addressing the final plenary
session on May 15 ; Dr. Stoddard
declared that"the unique, per-I
manent and exciting business of
Unesco is to contribute to a just
peace-to a world-wide, self-im-
posed security resting on cultural
Understanding and exchange."
"It seems to m2,"he said,
"that Unesco must choose and
choose fast whether to stay in
quiet waters far from danger or
significance or to consider itself i
a militant organized force for
peace."
Unesco Exhibit on UNI
A five-panel pictorial exhibit on
teaching about the United Na-
tions is to be presented at the
IBE-Unesco Conference in Ge-
neva and at the Economic and
Social Council meeting in Geneva
next month.
Brazilian Educator
Calls for Increased
Interest in Unesco
Dr. Fernando Tude de Souza,
of the Brazilian Ministry of Edu-
cation, in an important address
delivered at the Casa Roosevelt
in Sao Paulo on May 25, describ-
ed Unesco as"a new and perhaps
unique opportunity for liberty
and democracy loving peoples to
live in peace".
Speaking on"Unesco and the
Struggle for Peace", Dr. de Souza
calted for an untiring campaign
to wipe out illiteracy in Brazil
and stressed the need for greater
participation of his countrymen
in the. work of Unesco."Unesco
and its ideas", he said,"should
be explained in sohools, in the
public squares, in parliamentary
bodies, so that... in serving Brazil
we can at the same time serve
the cause of all humanity and
contribute to the diffusion of
knowledge,.. Education, according
to Unesco, aims at giving the
masses of the people a true idea
of its verita. ble mission".
"Brazilians should take a great-
er interest in the work of Unes-
co", Dr. de Souza stated,"We
speak of peace, though our hopes
may wane. But time has not yet
run out. It is vital that we con-
vince both governments and
those governed of the need to
strengthen the bulwarks of peace
through Unesco".

Volume 1.-No 5 UNESCO COURtER
Two Vital Studies on Unesco Policy
(NE of the most difficultproblems facing the United
Nations and the Specialized
Agencies tike Unesco is how to co-
ordinate their separate efforts
towards the achievement of peace
and security.
The United Nations system for
international co-operation was
created on the basis of having a
central United Nations Organiza-
tion and a series of Specialized
United Nations Agencies. As a
result the United Nations and the
several Specialized Agencies have
individual charters, different
memberships, different bases of
financial contribution and dif-
ferent methods of operation.
Their common objective, to find
world solutions for world prob-
lems, requires however that the
Agencies work in the closest pos-
sible co-operation. Only thus can
they hope to contribute to the
peace and security of the'world.
The co-operation require
touches two principal fields : pro-
gramme and administration. It
can be achieved by three prin-
cipal means ; The Economic and
Social Council, the administrative
officers, and by Member Govern-
ments.
Under the United Nations
Charter, Articles 63 and 64, the
principal responsibility for co-
ordinating policies and program-
mes of the Specialized Agencies
rests with the Economic and
Social Council. Of necessity, such
co-ordination, based upon discus-
sions, reports and recommenda-
tions, must be on a general high
policy level. The Council, a deli-
berative body, meeting a few
times each year, cannot deal ef-
fectively with the details of or-
ganizational relationships and
procedures for the execution of
individual Agency programmes.
The Economic and Social
Council must, however, keep
under continual review the range
of activities of the various Agen-.
cies, for the purpose both of
watching for possible overlapping
and of recommending concerted
policies for the attaining of com-
mon ends. It may also recom-
mend particular programmes and
activities to the various Agencies
or to the United Nations Secre-
tari at.
The heaviest responsibility for
co-ordination in the execution of
programmes equally rests upon
the chief administrative officers
of the United Nations and Spe-
cialized Agencies. They are en-
gaged in the day-to-day execution
of programmes. They know in
greatest detail the principal prob-
lems and issues that arise in
carrying out the diverse program-
mes of the various Agencies. In
addition, however, the chief ad-ministrative officers must provide
leadership for the legislative bo-
dies of their Agencies in the for-
mulation and development of
both programme and administra-
tion.
The Third nd Fourth Meetings
of the Co-ordination Committee,
held last February 24 and 25 and
May 27 and 28, provide evidence
of determination on the part of
the administrative officers to
meet their responsibilities in this
regard. Those meetings have es-
tablished beyond doubt that ex-
tremely little, if any, overlapping
exists in the work of the Agen-
In addition a high degree of
agreement has now been reached
about the desirability and posse.
bility of co-ordination in budget
presentation (to assist govern-
ments in evaluating and voting
upon budgets) and in personnel
policies (with a view to esta-
blishing a United Nations Civil
Service). Significant steps have
been taken towards the more ef-
fective use of common adminis-
trative services, such as travel,
transport and documentation
services.
The most recent of these
meetings, held at Lake Success,
led to the clarification of the
functions of the Committee and
the establishment of simple con-
sultative procedures whereby the
various Agencies can take up
systematically, as they arise,
problems of administrative co-
ordination as well as of program-
me execution, and such technical
and politically complicated prob-
lems as income-tax reimburse-

cipal administrative officers. Fur-
thermore, problems of co-ordina-
tion will tend to disappear as
Member States recognize more
clearly the importance of de-
veloping and pursuing consistent
policies on their part in their
dealings with the various Spe-
cialized Agencies to which they
belong.
The lack of such consistency
has been a serious problem in
the past. If, in addition, those
States represented in the Eco-
nomic and Social Council will. in
the Council, follow policies con-
sistent with those which their
representatives follow in the Spe-
cialized Agencies. few real prob-
lems should remain.
Unesco has recognized from the
start the importance of deve-
loping its programme in full re-
cognition of the responsibilities
of the other members of the
United Nations family. The New
York Office exists largely to
maintain continual liaison with
the United Nations at Lake Suc-
cess. On this basis it keeps Paris
headquarters posted and advised
on Unesco's role in United Na-
tions and other Specialized Agen-
cy matters. It frequently repre-
sents Unesco in important
meetings of United Nations.
The task of the New York Of-
fice has not been an easy one,
because it is so far from Paris.
The Office, however, has made
important, contributions towards
the clarification of Unesco's pro-
gramme in the minds of partici-
pants in meetings at Lake Suc-
cess. At the same time the New
York Office has kept head-
quarters in Paris informed re-
garding developments which
must be taken into account in the
growth of Unesco's own pro-
gramme.
In the development of Unesco's
programme in medical science
there has been close co-operation
with the Interim Committee of
the \world Health Organization.
Similary the agricultural science
programme is being developed in
consultation with the Food and
Agricultural Organization. Plans
for the Fundamental Education
Pilot Project of the Government
of Haiti have been developed clo-
sely with the World Health Or-
ganization and the Food and
Agricultural Organization, us
certain phases of the Hylean
Amazon Project.
At the request of the Human
Rights Commission of the Eco-
nomic and Social Council, Unesco
has brought together a sym-
posium of papers deallllg with
the philosophical and intellectual
basis of Human Rights. In the
development of plans for statis-
tical services. Unesco has con-
sulted regularìy with corres-
ponding bodies of the United Na-
tions and other Specialized Agen-
cies. Unesco co-operated with the
United Nations in the work of
the Freedom of Information Con-
ference, held at Geneva early this
year. In Unesco's fellowship pro-
gramme, the requirements of
other United Nations Specialized
Agencies have been taken into
account and the beginnings of a
system of regular consultation
have been established.
Special efforts are being made
to ensure the application of
Unesco's broad programme in the
fields of education, science and
culture to non-self-governing ter-
ritories in close collaboration
with the United Nations Secreta-
riat.
In respect to its salary and
allawance system, personnel poli-
cies and manv administrative
procedures. Unesco has followed
closely the practices of United
Nations and the recommendations
of the Consultat : ve Committee on
Administrative and Personnel
Practices, which includes. repre-
sentatives of all the Specialized
Agencies and the United Nations.
In recent months, important
steps have been taken in Paris to
provide, through Unesco, central
administrative services and assis-
tance to Specialized Agencies re-
quiring such services as travel
and transport in the Paris area.
So long as there was available
space, Unesco provided rooms for
UNRRA, ECITO and UNICEF.
Perhaps the biggest step re-
maining to be taken towards
achieving co-ordination is that
of advance programme co-ordi-
nation. Thus far, of necessity,
each agency has developed its
programme in the light of resolu-
tions voted by its own legislative
body. There has been little op-
portunity to consider in advance
what kinds of programme should
be undertaken by the Specialized
Agencies jointly or in collabora-
tion with United Nations. The
need for such advance co-ordi-
nation has been regularly recogn-
ized by the Co-ordination Com-
mittee which has recently been
taking positive steps towards this
end.
This is admittedly the most
difficutl task because the mem-
bership of the various Agencies is
not identical and because the an-
nual legislative meetings of the
Agencies reflect the immediate
interests of their Member States.
However, the increasing strains
in thy international scene, com-
bind with requirements of eco-
nomy, and a real desire on the
part of the Principal administra-
tive officers for greater effec-
tivenes in furthering the com-
mon ohjective of United Nations
and the Specialized Agencies, will
compel more continuous and
more positive steps in this direc-
tion in the immediate future. In
this respect. Unesco will not only
show its willingness to co-operate
but may be expected to continue
to provide leadership.

Maheu has not shrunk from rais-
ing the fundamental question of
Uneseo's role in a world torn by
ideological strife and political con-
flick. His articie. we beiieve. should
totlch off an interesting discussion
on this role.)
HE part played by Unesco inthe United Nations Confe-
rence on Freedom of Infor-
mation, held at Geneva from
23 March to 21 April has already
been described'n previous issues
of the Ur. esco Courier, It might
be well however to consider cer-
tain aspects of the situation in
which the Organization's repre-
sentatives found themselves pla-
ced. Important questions are in-
volved regarding Unesco's pur-
pose and its relations with other
international bodies.
In the first place. the Confe-
rence consisted of official govern-
mental delegations : Unesco was
represented by members of the
Secretariat. There was a funda-
mental difference between the
status of the national delegates
and the international officials.
Only the former had the right
to vote and the decisions there-
fore rested entirely with them.
In such circumstances, should
the Unesco representatives have
taken no part in the debates ?
Should thev merely have helped
their colleagues of the United
Nations Secretariat with prep-
rations for the Conference and
its technical organization ?
Should they have been content
to act as interested, but passive.
spectators ? There could be no
Question of that. Our Constitu-
tion itself lays down that one of
the primary purposes of the Or-
ganization is the promotion of
"the free flow of ideas bv word
and image".. It is a subject on
which we cannot remain neu-
tral.
The distinguishing feature of
the Specialized 1-'-gencies is that
they were set up within the Uni-
ted Nations to carry out spe-
cific tasks. It follows, therefore,
An Opinion onUnesco sRo ! e
In Political Meetings
that when one of those funda-
mental tasks is concerned-and,
for Unesco, freedom of informa-
tion is undoubtedly one of them-
the Secretariats of the Specia-
lized Agencies are obliged to take
an active part in the discussion
of the problems themselves,
unlike the Secretariat of the Uni-
ted Nations which is merely res-
possible for arranging for con-
tact and negotiations between
governments.
The members of the Secrets-
riat who represented Unesco at
Geneva were therefore entitled,
and indeed obliged, to take part
in the discussions of the govern-
ment delegates, in order to state
the Organization's point of view.
They were likewise committed to
this course by the governments
of their Member States in the

adopted by the General Confe-

Unesco's point of view must, bv
definition, be international. What
Unesco had to do-and did-at
Geneva was to bring to the dis-
cussions between the national de-
legation', a truly international
and objective outlook. That was
the essence and originality of
the part played by the Organiza-
tion.
The fact Unesco's representati-
ves could exercise an influence
only by persuasion, certainly res-
tricted considerably what they
were able to do ; but it did not
lessen their obligations. Rather
the reverse. Similarly, the fact
that not aU the States attending
the Conference were members of
the Organization (1) undoubtedly
lessened our influence but made

it all the more incumbent upon
us to promote the ideas which
Unesco exists.
We therefore had to speak on
the subjects under discussion.
The nature and conditions of the
debate must also be borne ill
mind.
This debate was essentially po-
litical. It could not be otherwise,
as the subject concerns not only
the practices of governments but
the very structure of States.
Unesco, however, like all the
Specialized Agencies. is concer-
ned with purely technical ques-
tions, and the Organization's
constructive intervention at the
Conference was limited to the
technical s'due of the discussions.
As a result, not only was the
influence of Unesco's representa-
tives restricted in scope but there
was a fundamental difference in
outlook between them and the
government delegations.
Each delegation proceeded ac-
cording to its own particular his-
torial tradition, political ideo-
logy, social needs, economic strut-
ture and technical equipment ;
and the idea of freedom of in-
formation which it supported was
founded on those individual fac-
tors. In short, each delegation
came to the Conference with an
opinion determined in advance.
The only problem was to discover
how that opinion could be recon-
ciled with those of others.
Unesco, as a non-political, inter-
governmental organization, was
not in a position to form such
a decided opinion-an opinion
challenging the constitution and
administration of States. The
Organization was obliged to admit
all the factors, not only as
obvious facts but also as indis-
putable principles.
Faced with the alternative of
national prejudice (in the ori-
ginal meaning of the term) which
the Organization has to rise
above, and the impossibility of
giving a supra-national judg-
ment, from which it is prohi-
bited. Unesco. as an instrument
of international co-operation,
could only try to discover a basis
for mutual understanding and
practical co-operation, since a
solution combining the various
factors was impossible.
That was the aim of the
speech in which the Director-
General described Unesco's posi-
tion. By emphasizing the idea of
need as the basis of the idea of
cal definition of freedom of in-
formation, Dr. Julian Huxley was
trying to define an area of
common agreement, leading the
discussion away from conflicts of
interest and political tenets to
keep it concentrated on the two
subjects-broadly speaking, com-
plementary and interdependent-'
of the technical requirements of
the profession and the intellec-
tual aspirations of the public.
It was not for lack of c1arity
or energy that Unesco's
appeal was not better under-
stood by the government delega-
tes and did not meet with a
better response. The speech, at
least explains-and, we think,
justifies-the line followed by
the Organization's representati-
ves at the Conference,'who re-
frained entirely from taking part
in the political discussions and
concentrated on the technical
facts and intellectual principles
on which, in practice, freedom of
information depends..
The turn taken by the political
debate is now well known. There
were two rival camps. Both sides,
rejected compromises. Decisions
were taken by the vote of the
majority.
These unbending tactics and
this rigid division constituted an
additional complication for the
reprensentatives of Unesco. Were
they to take sides and support,

8 UNESCO COURIER Volume I.-No 5
International
W orkCa ; ; ps
 I....-.
THE Conference of Organizers of International- Work Camps, held on 22 and 23 April, marked
the end of the first stage of Unesco's work in this
field, and the progress so far made can be surveyed
with some satisfaction.
The first post-war international Work Camps
were organized in 1946. Unesco began to take an
interest in this question in the spring of 1947 and
decided to sponsor four camps-at Boussu-Bois
(Belgium), Cauterets (France), Lidice (Czechoslo-
vakia) and Lucimia (Poland), Observers from the
Secretariat paid visits to the camps.
It was clear from the outset that international
work Camps had a double value. Firstly, the
volunteers were making a considerable voluntary
contribution to the restoration of the educational
life of war-devastated countries (by the rebuilding
or equiping of schools, playing fields, youth hostels,
etc) ; and secondly, the camps had the great advan-
tage of bringing together young people of good
will of different nationalities to work at a com-
mon task. Valuable opportuni-
ties were thus provided for
truly international education (de-
velopment of mutual understand-
ing through team-work, establish-
ment of useful contacts between
the volunteers and the local popu-
lation, organization of talks, lec-
tures and discussions on interna-
tional problems).
A report was therefore sub-
mitted to the Mexico Conference,
which resolved that Unesco should
give increased assistance to Work
Camps. The Temporary Interna-
tional Council for Educational Re-
construction (TICER) subsequent-
ly appointed a Committee of Ex-
perts on International Work
Camps. At the Committee's first
meeting, at the beginning of 1948,
the principle of cD-oròingirg the
activities of the associations re-
presented on it was agreed upon,
and the members of the Com-
mittee were very soon able to
embark on joint undertakings,
particularly as regards the ne-
cessary propaganda for Work
Camps. The Committee also advis-
ed the Unesco Secretariat on the
preparation of the agenda for the
Conference of Organizers of In-
ternational Work Camps and on
other matters included in itS'pro-
gramme.
The Conference has been held.
Eighteen international organiza-
tions sent expert delegates ; and
it provided an instance-seldom
seen-of a Conference at which
the average age of the delegates
was under thirty, the atmosphere.
from the beginning, cordial and
non-academic.
And now, what has come out of
those two days'work ?
Firstly, the Conference un-
animously agreed on the need for
co-ordinating the work of the
various associations to promote
Work Camps and elected a stand-
ing Committee to establ1sh the
necessary working contacts and to
be responsible for co-operation
with Unesco.
Secondly, at the meetmgs, the
delegates pooled their experience
of the countless technical pro-
blems involved in the setting up
of Work Camps and the despatch
of volunteers. A most interesting
document has thus been prepar-
ed-the preliminary outline of a
thorough treatment of the ques-
tion : this document will be par-
ticularly valuable to organizations
which are trying to interest their
members in Work Camps for the
first tine. :
Lastly, the delegates submitted
to Unesco and TICER specific re-
Quests for assistance in solving
the difficult problems facing their
associations (how to obtain mate-
rials, equipment, visas, travel
vouchers, support from public
authorities, etc.).
Unesco's activities in connexion
with Work Camps are primarily
intended to stimulate the work
of the associations. For example,
the Secretariat has supplied arti-
cles to various publications, has

organized broadcasts and is at
present arranging for the publica-
tion of a popular leaflet. This
publicizing of Work Camps is in-
tended to make their existence
known to all young people IWho
may be prepared to work as
volunteers and to official bodies
which may be able to help.
Unesco also aims at co-ordinat-
ing as far as possible the activi-
ties of the various associations
which organize work Camps or
send volunteers. This was one of
Thanks to this action, the vari-
ous associations which had pre-
viously been working in isolation
have now embarked on more
fruitful combined operations.
Lastly, Unesco is trying to
make the Work Camps as effi-
cient as possible by supporting
organizers in their approaches to
governments to discover which
camps should have priority and to
obtain materials, equipment, visas,
etc.
These efforts have produced re-
sults. Work Camps have been
opened in countries, such as Po-
land or Greece, which had never
had them before.
As regards co-ordination, there
have been interesting results this
year in connexion with the camp
organized by the Women's World
Fellowship at Burdignin (Haute-
Savoie) for the purpose of setting
up a children's village. In March
19<18, the Fellowship, which had
never before organized interna-
tional Work Camps and had very
little informat : on on the matter,
had neither volunteers nor equip-
ment, nor a camp leader. There
was a risk that the materials
collected would have to remain
unused owing to the lack of work-
ers.

Unesco, teaching about the UN
and its Specialized Agencies,
items of the 1948 Unesco pro-
gramme and details regarding the
Unesco conference for universe
ties, scheduled to be held in
Utrecht (Netherlands) this Au-
gust. Dr. Kruyt, Dr. Bender and
Dr. Sassen were appointed Na-
tional Commission delegates to
this conference.
First World Congress
Of Art Critics
Leading art critics, coming
from 24 countries, will meet this
month at Unesco House in Paris
for the First World Congress of
Art Critics. The Congress, meet-
ing for one week from June 21 to
28, will discuss the establishment
of an International Association
of Art Critics and will be devot-
ed to a discussion of some of the
major artistic and aesthetic pro-
blems of our time.
The distinguished Belgian cri-
tic and historian M. Paul Fierens
. will preside over the Congress,
. which will include such famous
world figures as Jean Cassou of
France, Lionello Venturi of Italy,
James Johnson Sweeney of the
United States, Herbert Read of
England and M. Van Eck of
Czechoslovakia.
Universities
Conference to Meet
in Utrecht
On August 2-13, Unesco will
convene at Utrecht, Holland, the
first general conference of uni-
versities held since the war. In-
vitations to the Preparatory Con-
ference of Representatives of
Universities have been extended
to all the nations of the. world to
send a specified number of par-
ticipants and observers. A num-
ber of international organiza-
tions interested in higher educa-
tion, including student groups,
have also been invited to send a
representative.
Five public meetings will be
held with addresses on such
issues as :"New Horizons in Uni-
verity Development" ;"Relations
of Higher Education and the
State" ;"The University as a
Force in World Co-operation" ;
and"Unesco and Higher Educa-
tion"..--.. 
During the regular sessions of
the Conference and in sectional
meetings, current university pro-
blems will be discussed. Special
attention will be paid to ways in
which higher education can con-
tribute to world understanding
and permanent peace.
Addresses of welcome will be
given by representatives of the
Netherlands Government. The
speakers will include Dr. Julian
Huxley, Director-General ot
Unesco and other. world leaders
in higher education. Representa-
tives from various countries will
describe the growth and problems
of higher education in different
parts of the world. Problems to
be considerered by the partici-
pants will include : the changing
functions of the university ; impro-
vement of academic standards ;
financing and facilitating higher
education ; university education
in international understanding ;
and the development of ways to
continue international co-opera-
tion among universities.
An opinion on Unesco's Role
in Political Meetings
(Continued from Page 7)
with the weight of the organiza-
tion, one camp against the other :' ?
Apart from the fact that the cue-
vision into camps was based on
reasons which Unesco is not
competent to judge, there were
Member States of the Organ, za-
tion in both camps, and it is not
a Secretariat's role to decide
which of its Members are right,
which wrong.
The role of a Secretariat is to
translate into action, so far as
it can, agreement (when they
exist) reached by the Member
States which it represents. In
this case there was no previous
agreement of principle that th
Secretariat could call upon Mem-
bocs to observe. It is true that
resolution 2. 2, 2. 1. 1 of the Mexico
Conference instructed the Direc-
tor-General to"promote at the
Conference on F'reedom of Infor-
mation the... policies adopted flY
the General Conference". But n
fact the question of these policies
was never settled in Mexico, and,
insofar as it was discussed, the
exchanges of views both in the
plenary meetings and in the Mass
Communication Working Party.
brought out obvious and profound
differences of opinion (1),
In these conditions the Secre-
tariat did not consider it should
take sides in the"political"de-
bate at Geneva. I do not doubt
that some people have criticized
this intentional discretion, which
they wrongly attribute to excessi-
ve timidity or to culpable legit-
gence. I believe that on reflexion
it will be clear to them. not only
that the representatives of the
Secretariat could not do other-
wise. but also that in the interests
of the Organization theirs was
the only course compatible with
th universal nature of a techni-
cal organization which cannot
make political pronouncements of
its own without hopelessly com-
promising itself.
I came back from Geneva
convinced of the immense poten-
tial moral authority possessed by
Unesco ; in order to become an
active force, this authority has
only to prove its effectiveness by
practical achievements.
In order to achieve its aims.
Unesco must use this potential
influence to further a construe-
tive policy. There must be a
"Unesco point of view"which, by
its originality, will gradually win
the sympathy of peoples and the
respect of governments. In other
words, Unesco must adopt a reso-
lutely militant attitude.
But this militant attitude and
this constructive policy cannot
spring from the arbitrary inven-
tion of a Secretariat of officials
nor from passive conformity,
however well-intentioned, to the
will of a political group. Unesco
must, above all. voice the agreed
opinion of its different Members
met together to carry out specific
technical tasks. And the more
its univC ('salitv and its ir depen-
dence are recognized, the more
weight will be attached to its
words.
