The Tablets
of the Law
1977, oil on canvas
(81 x 65 cm)
by Gervais Bataillé
The nebula-like
compositions of French
artist Gervais Bataillé take
the spectator into what
one critic has called "a
mathematical dreamland".
By creating a counterpoint
of forms and colours he
attempts to build up "a
kind of common ground
where the different
languages of a civilization
merge into one".

Today there are no more
unexplored continents,
unknown seas or mysterious
islands. But while we can
overcome the physical
barriers to exploration, the
barriers of mutual ignorance
between different peoples
and cultures have in many
cases still not been
dismantled.
A modern Ulysses can
voyage to the ends of the
earth. But a different kind
of Odyssey now beckonsan
exploration of the world's
many cultural landscapes, the
ways of life of its different
peoples and their outlook on
the world in which they live.
It is such an Odyssey that
the Unesco Courier proposes
to you, its readers. Each
month contributors of
different nationalities provide
from different cultural and
professional standpoints an
authoritative treatment of a
theme of universal interest.
The compass guiding this
journey through the world's
cultural landscapes is respect
for the dignity of man
everywhere.

VACLAV HAVEL
President of the Republic of Czechoslovakia, is
a playwright and a fighter for freedom. It was as a
dissident writer that he won the reputation that led to
his election as President on 29 December 1989, becoming
thereby the symbol of the peaceful revolution that had taken
place in his country. | | In 1968, after the brutal termination of
the "Prague Spring" in which Vaclav Havel had played a leading
role, production of his plays was banned in Czechoslovakia, although
his trilogy Interview, A Private View and Protest (1975-1976), was
staged in many other countries. Because of his human-rights advocacy and
resistance to oppression he was arrested several times and spent a total of five

its entirety, was conducted on 30 June 1989 in semi-clandestine conditions at Vaclav
Havel's home near Prague. We publish it as an exceptional document of its
time the weeks before the banned playwright moved into the centre of the stage.
This conversation is taking place in rather a strange
atmosphere. You're under observation, and yet you still
speak without taking any special precautions.... Are you,
or are you not, free to come and go as you please?
I've been very isolated until the last few years, but not
any longer. The isolation was effective during the 1970s, at
a time of widespread social inertia. People seemed to have
lost heart, seemed not to believe that social change was
possible any more. They had stopped taking an interest in
public lite, which anyway was systematically stifled. People
had withdrawn into themselves, with very little
communication between individuals.
It was a period when society became fragmented, when
everyone was isolated from everyone else. I was particularly
isolated because I belonged to the category of people who,
in the wake of the Soviet invasion of 1968, were to some

extent singled out as enemies of the state. It was dangerous
to have anything to do with us. I was a banned writer. I
couldn't get work anywhere-
Then, little by little, things started to change. Today,
the situation is radically different. Not that the party or
government leadership has changed its policy. They're still
the same. But society, society's changed. People are perhaps
just tired of being tired. They're emerging from their shells
again, from their isolation. Something akin to public life
is taking shape once more.
New generations are growing up, who have not been
stigmatized by the trauma of the Soviet invasion. It's been
a gradual, a progressive developmentthough a significant
one all the same. But in my case, I've been able to follow
this development quite closely, owing to the fact that I've
been arrested and imprisoned a number of times. When you
go to prison, you somehow take along with you your aware¬
ness of the situation as it is when you're arrested. Afterwards,
for a while, you remain outside the development of events
and this frozen memory remains in your mind. Then, all
of a sudden, you come out of prison. At such times, you're
particularly alive to all the changes which may have taken
place in the intervening period. At the end of each of my
prison terms, I've been surprised by new developments. Each
time, society was more alive, the apathy had retreated still
further, more and more people had woken up...

Have you at any time had to stop writing?
My plays have been banned in Czechoslovakia for twenty
years, but I haven't stopped writing. You can't really prevent
a writer from writing. His mission is to continue writing,
speaking, even under the most difficult circumstances. So
I went on publishing things. Where? Abroad, but above all
in samizdat, clandestine form.
In the early 1970s, two mutually hostile cultures
appeared in this country. One of them official, authorized,
the other clandestine, independent. After a modest start,
samizdat publishing mushroomed. Today, dozens of
samizdat magazines and newspapers are published, as well
as hundreds of books and even a current affairs video. In
recent years, cracks have started to appear in the barriers
between these two cultures. A no-man's-land has developed
between them, which has sometimes been called the "grey
zone". There has been cross-fertilizationthe official and
the independent cultures have moved closer together, each
of them having realized that it has no monopoly over
culture. It is this inner pressure, this growing awareness,
which has caused the rapprochement, and not some sort of
liberalization of the cultural policy of the authorities.
What in your view is the political and social role of
intellectuals?
Intellectuals are right to think about the future. They
mustn't be afraid to deal with the future, to imagine how
it might be. But their primary task, their chief priority is,
in my view, to understand the present, to understand its
crises and put a name to them. That is how true awareness
of perspectives is born.
The politicians' role is to build the best of all possible
worlds. The intellectuals must watch, warn, put people on
their guard. They must to some extent monitor the politi¬
cians, remind them how they become divorced from reality
when they follow the shams of ideology. When I say this,
I'm speaking as someone disillusioned with ideology. A
disillusionment which has been experienced by all this part
of Europe. We live in conditions which force people to
reflect upon the bankruptcy of ideologies.
What we want, here and now, are simple, elementary
things. Without reference to any ideological framework,
Works by Vaclav Havel translated

Columbia Press, 1987; Largo Desolato, Faber & Faber,

beyond all ideology. We aspire to a share in the basic values
of life, those which simple common sense and elementary
human dignity demand we should be entitled to. Yet what
have we actually experienced? An attempt to subjugate the
world to ideology. And what a failure! Perhaps it will make
the intellectuals realize that it is not enough to construct
a theory and then twist reality to fit in with it. Alive and

mysterious, reality transcends all imaginable theories, plans,
concepts. To order and organize it calls for humility and
respect for the richness, the diversity, all the colourful variety
of life. It is impossible to stretch it out on the Procrustean
bed of a utopia created by the cold mind of an ideologist.
But in our part of the world, this is what has been done.
It's a total failure. Hence the mistrust of plans and theories
on the part of the intellectuals in Eastern Europe. Hence
our desire to stick to analysing the present, which is the best
way of planning the future.
Do you see any difference between the respective roles of
intellectuals in the East and in the West?
The first difference is that, in most of the communist bloc
countries, even recently, politics, the political debate, seemed
to have vanished. Totalitarianism banishes politics. Deprived
of all political culture, society cannot build its natural
defences, public opinion cannot be born. Politics does not
even have any professional ground where it can be practised.
But a strange thing happened. Politics, chased out of the
door, came back in through the window. It suddenly

invaded the whole spectrum of social life. Secretly, every¬
thing took on political significance: a concert, a mass, a
fair.... In such circumstances, the writer's word acquires
an extraordinary aura. Especially if he strives to tell the
truth, without fear of the problems he is bringing down
on his own head, if he ceases to be the docile interpreter
of authority. Why is the writer so important? Because
the tool with which he works is language, which calls a
spade a spade, which asks questions. It is the quintessential
tool of culture. In our country, the writer's cultural audience
is on a par with the level of political expectationimmense.
Many people from the West are struck by this. People
are desperately eager to hear what is going to be said, ex¬
pressed. It is their own hopes, their freedom, which thus
seem to take shape. It is as though society, through the
medium of this cultural ferment, becomes varied, structured.
Writers, upon whose shoulders there weighs a growing
political responsibility, have to be correspondingly more
demanding.
Does this desire for change in Eastern Europe and in other
parts of the world mark the advent of a new era?
I'm not a futurologist, nor am I a seer. I do not know
where the world community is heading. Everywhere, I
observe the economic, political, ecological signs of a deep-
seated crisis. In my view, this crisis is an existential crisis,
a crisis of identity: man has lost the sense of responsibility
he had previously felt towards something higher than him,
something which transcended him. There are many men and
women in the world who have felt it, understood it and who
are seeking a way out.
Perhaps the end of the millennium will see new perspec¬
tives opening up. There are already some encouraging signs:
a slowing down of the arms race, attempts at peaceful
co-existence, the Helsinki agreements. Signs which are still
modest. The most brutal and obvious aspects have already
been tackled. But the most dangerous aspects are precisely
those which aren't visible.
Will the gulf between West and East disappear?
I honestly don't know. The differences between the two
worlds are so enormous.... For decades, these two systems
have had a different history. Today, the communist-type
totalitarian system, which, following the example of the
communists themselves, I would call "Stalinist socialism",
has reached stalemate. People are starting to realize this in
the East. Whence the related efforts to introduce an element
of democratization, of perestroika. This fact is vitally
important. The East is taking a step towards the West. Is
the western world for its part capable of taking a step
towards its neighbour? I don't know. The West is defending
values which are good for humanity as a whole. It has no
desire to abandon them and in this it is absolutely right.
I suffer whenever it relinquishes some of them: we subscribe
to these values too. As for the upheavals which the West
is experiencing, most of these strike me as variants of this
profound crisis of civilization which I have already referred
to. The West can only solve these problems by itself.
But there is one serious problem which is common to
both systems, and that is excessive centralization. Here,
political power, the economic levers, energy resources, every¬
thing lies in the same hands. So in fact the state is the sole
employer, the sole organizer of social life. This is monstrous.
In the West, though in different formsincreasingly vast
undertakings, gigantic conglomeratesyou find the same
trend towards total centralization. The result, on both sides,
is the same "anonymization" of life in general, though of
course in our case it looks more directly shocking. Human
links, relations between one person and another, are disap¬
pearing from the workplace, but also from social life, from
towns, from homes. The individual is becoming just a cog
in an immense machine. He is losing all sense of his work
and of his existence. Both systems ought to be capable of
overcoming this dehumanizing phenomenon, each in its
own way. When they have done so, perhaps they will find
a way of moving closer together...
At this decisive turningpoint for thefuture, can intellectuals
do anything to change the course of events?
By their very nature, intellectuals are powerless in certain
fields. They cannot change the world as politicians do. Their
presence in the world is marked by what they say, they act
through words. I have written an essay entitled "The power
of the impotent", in which I have tried to explain how a
true word, even when spoken by a single person, is more
powerful in certain circumstances than entire divisions of
soldiers. The word illuminates, awakens, liberates. The word
also has its power. The intellectuals must hang on to or
acquire this power of theirs, in order to turn it to advantage.
They must not desire any other power than this. Let them
leave the power of immediate transformation or social
organization to the politicians.

What cause do you think intellectuals should use their
power to serve?
On the eve of a new millennium, the most precious
possession we ought to defend, and which should find unani¬
mous support among people everywhere, regardless of their
country or the system under which they live, is a certain
number of human qualities, of fundamental values. And
first of all, humility. Many cruel events which we have
experienced at the end of this millennium, such as Hitlerism,
Stalinism or the excesses of Pol Pot, show the vanity, the
arrogance of groups or individuals, of fanatics or non-
fanatics, of ideologues, doctrinaires, Utopians. The arrogance
of those who think they know how everything ought to
be, who think they can decide the order of things. When
reality doesn't fit in with their theories, they impose their
theories and these lead straight to the camps, to massacres,
to horrendous wars. This lack of humility can also be
observed elsewhere than in the strict political domain. Pride
is also at the root of the global ecological crisis: man imposes
his will upon nature, without respecting her laws, her secrets.
There is plenty I could say on this subject.... Let us not forget
the meaning of freedom, of dignity, of justice. And let us
be more humble.

THE
WRITING
ON THE
WALL
BY ROBERT DARNTON

'N the morning of 10 November 1989, when
both Berlins woke up wondering whether the
first flood through the wall had been a dream,
the West Berlin tabloid Volksblatt ran two head¬
lines, shoulder to shoulder, on its front page:
"The Wall is Gone" and "Bonn Demands the
Destruction of the Wall".
Both were right. The wall is there and it is
not there. On 9 November, it cut through the
heart of Berlin, a jagged wound in the middle of
a great city, the Great Divide of the Cold War.
On 10 November, it had become a dance floor,
a picture gallery, a bulletin board, a movie screen,
a video cassette, a museum, and, as the cleaning
lady of my office put it, "nothing but a heap of
stone". The taking of the wall, like the taking
of the Bastille, transformed the world. No
wonder that a day later, in Alexander Platz, East
Berlin, one conqueror of the wall marched in a
demonstration with a sign saying simply
"1789-1989". He had helped dismantle the cen¬
tral symbol around which the post-war world had
taken shape in the minds of millions.
To witness symbolic transformations on such
a scale is a rare opportunity, and it raises many
questions. To begin with the most concrete: what
happened between 9 and 12 November, and what
joes it mean.-'
'Goodbye to all that'
The destruction of the wall began in the early
evening of Thursday 9 November, soon after the
first wave of East Berliners, or "Ostlers" as they
are called by the West Berliners here, burst upon

the West. One Ostler, a young man with a knap¬
sack on his back, somehow hoisted himself up
on the wall directly across from the Brandenburg
Gate. He sauntered along the top of it, swinging
his arms casually at his sides, a perfect target for
the bullets that had felled many other wall jum¬
pers, like Peter Fechter, a young construction
worker, who was shot and left to bleed to death
a few feet in front of Checkpoint Charlie on 17
August 1962. Now, twenty-seven years later, a
new generation of border guards took aim and
firedbut only with power hoses and without
much conviction. The conqueror of the wall con¬
tinued his promenade, soaked to the skin, until
at last the guards gave up. Then he opened his
knapsack and poured the water towards the East,
in a gesture that seemed to say, "Goodbye to all
that".
A few minutes later, hundreds of people, Os¬
tlers and Westlers alike, were on the wall, em¬
bracing, dancing, exchanging flowers, drinking
wine, helping up new "conquerors"and chip¬
ping away at the wall itself. By midnight, under
a full moon and the glare of the spotlights from

the watchtowers in no-man's-land, a thousand
figures swarmed over the wall, hammering, chisel¬
ling, wearing its surface away like a colony of
army ants. At the bottom, "conquerors" threw
stones at its base or went at it with pickaxes. Long
slits appeared, and the light showed through from
the East, as if through the eyes of a jack-o'-lantern.
On the top, at the centre of the tumult, with the
Brandenburg Gate looming in the background,
an Ostler conducted the destruction, a sickle in
one hand, a hammer in the other.
By Saturday, chunks of the wall were circulat¬
ing through both Berlins. People exchanged them
as souvenirs of what had already taken shape in
the collective consciousness as a historical event:
the end of the Cold War. A sidewalk entre¬
preneur sold bits of wall from a table on the
Ku'damm: 20 marks for a piece of the past. At
one point, an East Berliner walked by and ob¬
jected, with a smile on his face: "You can't sell
that. It's our wall. It belongs- to us."
Like any powerful symbol, the wall has ac¬
quired many meanings, and they differ signifi¬
cantly from West to East. The wall even looks
different, if you study it from one side and then
the other. Seen from the West, it is a prison wall,
which encloses the East Berliners in totalitarian¬
ism. Tourists climb on observation towers and
shudder deliciously at the spectacle: the mons¬
trous, concrete structure, the no-man's-land be¬
yond itwhich, until 1985, was mined and rigged
with rifles that fired automatically at anyone who
dashed acrossthe barbed wire, the dog patrols,
the turrets with armed guards staring back
through binoculars, and the second wall or the
windowless buildings on the far side of the dead¬
ly, desolate, open space.
East Berliners see a different wall. Theirs is
painted in patterns of light and dark blue, clean,
bright, and free of all graffiti. It shuts off the view
of the repressive apparatus beyond it. If you lose
your way or stray into outlying areas in East Ber¬
lin, you can drive along the wall for miles without
noticing that it is something more than an ordi¬
nary part of the urban landscape.
'We are the people! We're staying here'
Just after the metaphorical fall of this wall, I visit¬
ed an East Berlin friend on his side of the city.
A non-party intellectual who has supported the
demonstrations and opposed the regime through¬
out the current crisis, he had one word of advice:
"Don't tear down the wall. We need it as a pro¬
tective barrier. It should be permeable but it
should stay up. One of the great mistakes in Ber¬
lin history was to tear down the customs wall in
which the Brandenburg Gate was embedded in
1867. After that the tragedies of the modern age
began."
A young professor from Leipzig had made
a similar remark two months earlier. She
described the wall as a dike against dangerous
influences from the capitalist world. I had thought
she was repeating a party line, but the same idea
can be heard on East German television, in pubs,
and in the streets now that the East Germans are
debating their future openly and the wall has
changed its nature.
Westerners commonly imagine that East Ger¬
mans are hungering and thirsting for the chance
to earn large salaries and to spend 'them on the
consumer goods that are available in the West.
Yet a more significant refrain was chanted by the
hundreds of thousands who remained home,
demonstrating in the streets of Leipzig, Dresden,
and a dozen other cities for weeks before the
storming of the wall: "We are the people! We're
staying here!" Between 500,000 and a million peo¬
ple chanted that theme in the climactic demon¬
stration of 4 November in East Berlin; not a nose
was bloodied, not a window broken.
The demonstrations have operated as an Es¬
tates General in the streets, sapping legitimacy
from the Party and transferring it to the people.
In conquering the wall, the people brought that
process to a climax. But then they faced a
problem: what are they to do if nothing stands
between them and the West?

On the Western side, the wall carries its own
commentary, because it has been covered with
layers of graffiti for years. "Tear along dotted
line"; "Make love not wall". Here the wall has
been taken over by tourists, who often treat it
as a neutral surface for spray paint: "Lisa ti amo";
or whose high-mindedness says little about the
divisions of Berlin: "Essex University condemns
all forms of political oppression".
In places the palimpsest reads like a dialogue,
in which the present answers the past with a com¬
forting reflection: the wall has fallen, even though
it is standing before your eyes as a surface on
which the writer sprays his assertion of its non¬
existence. "A pity that concrete doesn't burn."
"It falls, though."... "This wall will fall." "We
saw it fall, Nov. '89." The graffiti sound trium¬
phant, even when they joke, as in this message
sprayed near Checkpoint Charlie: "Charlie's
retired. 10 Nov. 1989."
The messages are essentially the same: they
distinguish between totalitarianism and liberty.
The theme is reinforced by the Checkpoint
Charlie Museum, which displays devices used to
escape under, over, or through the wall, and by
crosses set up opposite places where persons were
gunned down while attempting to escape.
This sense of heroism and suffering is under¬
cut by souvenir shops which sell wall postcards
and wall trinkets in a kind of fairground that has
grown up between the old Reichstag, which is
now a museum, and the breach in the wall
opened opposite Potsdamer Platz, which was
once the busiest traffic centre in Europe and is
now an enormous field covered with mud and
weeds. The postcards were snapped up by the
Ostlers who swarmed through the area after 9
November and who were fascinated by views of
the wall that they had never seen. But the ven¬
dors had displayed the postcards on stands out¬
side their shops, and the East Berliners, who had
never seen goods exposed so openly, assumed
they were handouts and walked off with them
without paying.
To the Ku'damm and back
One of the radical groups in West Berlin tried
to march against the flood carrying a banner
which proclaimed "Your liberty is that of the
West German banks". But the marchers were lost
in the waves of Ostlers, who swept through the
wall echoing the chant of the first wave, which

arrived on Thursday: Zum Ku'damm, zum
Ku'damm und dann wieder zurück (To the Kur¬
fürstendamm, West Berlin's elegant shopping
avenue, and then back again.) The zurück was the
crucial term in the refrain, because the East Ber¬
liners did not come simply to buy up or sell out
but rather to see the forbidden city with their
own eyes and to return home.
The Federal Republic offered 100 marks
(about $50) in "greeting money" to every visitor
from East Germany, and many banks stayed
open on Saturday and Sunday to provide cash.
Individuals also stepped in to help. One West Ber¬
liner stood outside a break in the wall and hand¬
ed out 50 mark notes, for as long as his supply
held out, to every Easterner who came through.
Another came across a teenage girl crying in front
of the McDonald's on the Ku'damm. She said that
all her life she had wanted to eat a McDonald's
hamburger, and now she had no money. He
pressed a 50 mark note into her hand and she dis¬
appeared, into paradise.
The incoming Ostlers collided with waves of
well-wishers from the West, who thrust drinks
into their hands, loaded them down with pizzas
and sausages, took them for rides through residen¬
tial neighbourhoods, and put them up overnight.
Ostlers were given free rides on all buses and sub¬
ways, reduced prices in restaurants and movie
theatres, free admission to discotheques. They
pressed their noses against store windows display¬
ing fine clothing and Mercedes. And when they
had some marks, they spent them for the most
part on tropical fruits unavailable in East Berlin;
on toys, relatively shabby on the other side of
the wall; on books, many of which had been for¬
bidden; on Coca Cola; and on a wide variety of
cosmetics, trinkets, and flowers.
Above all, the two populations of Berlin
sought to make contact with one another. In ex¬
changing hugs, drinks and flowers, they were per¬
forming a collective ritual. As the Volksblatt put
it, "In the night when the gates opened, it seemed
as though there were no more East Berliners and
West Berliners. Everyone felt as though they be¬
longed to a huge family, and everyone celebrated
the festival accordingly".
Living in the shadow
of the wall
To someone unfamiliar with Berlin, it may be
hard to imagine how successfully the wall had
divided the city. Soon after 1961, when the wall
went up, the million or so inhabitants on the
Western side and the two million or so in the East
began to lose contact. By 1989, a whole genera¬
tion had come of age within the shadow of the
wall. Most of them never crossed it, even from
West to East when that was allowed. They ac¬
cepted the wall as a fact of life, as something in¬
exorable, built into the landscape, which was
there when they were born and would be there
when they died. They left it to the tourists, took
it for granted, forgot about it, or simply stopped
seeing it.
Before the fall, an old woman was inter¬
viewed on her balcony, which overlooked the
wall from the West. She spent hours every after¬
noon staring into no-man's-land. Why did she
look so hard at the wall, day after day? the report¬
er asked, hoping to find some expression of Ber¬
lin's divided personality. "Oh, I'm not looking
at the wall at all," she replied. "I watch the rab¬
bits playing in no-man's-land." Many West Ber¬
liners did not see the wall until it ceased to exist.
Little by little West Berliners had come to
regard the wall as a source of support. Thanks
to its presence, the government in Bonn poured
billions into Berlin, subsidizing everything from
the Philharmonic orchestra to teenage jazz
groups. A whole population of under-employed
intellectuals grew up around the Free Universi¬
ty, which now has about 60,000 students. As resi¬
dents of West Berlin, they are exempt from the
draft, and they also are able to drink beer and

talk politics in pubs throughout the night; for
West Berlin is the only place in the Federal
Republic of Germany where the pubs can stay
open past midnight, the only place where you
can order breakfast in the afternoon. Many of
these free-floating intellectuals became free¬
loaders. They lived off the wall; and they may
face greater economic difficulties than the Ber¬
liners in the East.
To Berliners, therefore, the wall means some¬
thing very different from what it means outside
the city. Most of them realize that their local bar¬
rier is bound up with larger divisions, the Oder-
Neisse line in particular and the general dividing
line between Warsaw Pact and NATO countries.
Having gone to bed one day in a world with clear¬
ly defined boundaries, they woke up the next in
a world without firm national borders, without
balanced power blocs, and even without obvious
demarcations of time, because it suddenly seemed
possible to bring the curtain down on the Second
World War. They are living a truism of anthro¬
pology: the collapse of boundaries can be deeply
disturbing, a source of renewal but also a threat
to a' whole world-view.
The mood remains euphoric, nonetheless. In
East Berlin especially, the idea has spread that in
conquering the wall the people seized power. The
demonstrations in the streets sapped the legitima¬
cy of the regime. Combined with the subsequent
haemorrhaging of the population across the bord¬
ers, they brought the government down, without
a shot fired.
We may never know the details of what hap¬
pened inside the crumbling power structure of
the German Democratic Republic. But whatever
produced the occasion, the force that broke
through the wall was there for all to see on the
night of 9 November. It was the people of East
Berlin, with nothing but their convictions, their
discipline, and the power of their numbers. They
took possession of the wall physically, by pour¬
ing through it, climbing on it, and chipping it
apart. They did the same thing in West Berlin it¬
self. They occupied space, swarming through the
Ku'damm, filling the buses and pubs, parking
their tiny Trabants on the noblest sidewalks, and
returning triumphantly to the East with a flow¬
er for a girlfriend or a toy for an infant.
It was a magical moment, the possession of
a city by its people. On Thursday 9 November,
under a full moon, between the shadow of the
Reichstag and the menacing bulk of the Branden¬
burg Gate, the people of Berlin danced on their
wall, transforming the cruellest urban landscape
into a scene of hilarity and hope.
A fiery eruption of joy.

THE LONG
ROAD
TO
DEMOCRACY

X HE twentieth century has not been kind to
democracy. For seventy-five yearsfrom the be¬
ginning of the First World War in 1914, to the
opening up of the Berlin wall in 1989 it seemed
set to be a century of revolution, liberation and
development. However, these objectives, on
which so many hopes were pinned and which
were the rallying points of so many powerful
popular movements, are in their very essence anti¬
democratic, since they demand unity against a
common enemy or a specific obstacle, whereas
democracy is by nature pluralist.
This paradox is very hard for us to accept,
especially if we live in what has been called the
Third World. It is equally difficult, especially if
we come from the Western world, to abandon
the dream we nurtured for the twentieth
centurythat of seeing the spirit of democracy,
born first in Britain, in the United States of
America and in France, extending first to such
neighbouring countries as Germany, Italy and
Spain, then to the countries of Central and
Eastern Europe, to Latin America and, finally,
to the rest of the world.
In the twentieth century, ideologists from the
richer countries have declared that economic
growth, political democracy and personal happi¬
ness go hand in hand, but this saccharine opti¬
mism has been brutally dispelled by historical
reality. Weimar Germany, the country which
perhaps more than any other was the standard-
bearer of modernity, foundered and sank into
nazism. At the same time, voices of protest in the
colonized countries were a forceful reminder to
the great Western nations that the methods with
which they held sway over a large part of the
globe were far from democratic.
On the other hand, the revolutionary anti-
capitalist, anti-imperialist movements, created in
the name of oppressed peoples and classes, were
soon seen to have been imposed on half the coun¬
tries of Europe by a foreign army and scarcely
merited their self-assumed titles of "people's
democracies". For their part, many of the regimes
that emerged after decolonization also became
dictatorships, often dependent upon foreign pro¬
tectors. The poor countries followed not the road
to liberty but that which led to authoritarian,
totalitarian regimes. Again, some of the most
developed countries swung over to the various
forms of fascism which engulfed the world in the
Second World War; they also imposed colonial
regimes and encouraged social inequalities over
large areas of the planet.
Today, this picture of the situation during the
first half of the century certainly appears to be
too bleak. Democracy has survived, it has taken
root and spread in the West and has even regained
much lost ground, particularly in Eastern Europe
and Latin America. But serious reflection on the
state of democracy must go further than such
blandly euphoric observations. Democracy and
development do not always go hand in hand;
they may even advance in diametrically opposed 19

directions. This must be the starting point for a
proper examination of the dramatic history of the
twentieth century.
Defining democracy
Democracy is in no way associated with wealth
or poverty; if we seek the elements that favour
its advancement, we discover that it is very closely
related to a country's capacity for endogenous
development, that is to say, to the formation of
active members of society who are motivated by
the modern values of rationalism and individua¬
lism and who discuss among themselves questions
about the allocation and use of the community's
resources.
Democracy cannot be defined solely in terms
of institutions, or, in a more limited way, of safe¬
guards. There can certainly be no democracy
without the free election of those who govern or
without the right of the majority to remove from
power those whom it has not invested with
power or those from whom it has withdrawn its
confidence. This is purely a matter of definition
and there is no point in discussing democracy if
by that word is meant anything other than the
free choice of leaders by the people. What can
be done is to identify and explain the reasons for
the presence of this kind of political system. Here
a distinction must be made between endogenous
(democratic) and exogenous (voluntarist, anti¬
democratic) development.
When a society comes up against insurmount-

able internal obstacles to its modernization, it has
to mobilize, in both the literal and figurative
senses of the word, behind leaders who plead the
higher interest of the state or the nation and who
seek to justify their actions in the name of science,
history, a god, or the people. Development can¬
not be democratic in such a society if the old
resists the new, for in this situation a vanguard
or élite has to escape the pressure of the old order
and lead it forcibly towards the future. Usually
this involves the energetic mobilization of the
community against enemies who are always por¬
trayed as external enemies, whether they be a
colonial power, great land-owners, traditional be¬
liefs or forms of family organization. Defined in
this way, voluntarist, exogenous development
calls for national unity, whereas democracy re¬
quires plurality of opinion combined with a dual
check on social conflict through appeals to ration¬
ality and freedom.
In what circumstances do development and
democracy overlap? When can endogenous de¬
velopment be said to exist? As many authors have
said since the eighteenth century and particular¬
ly since the time of the German economist and
sociologist Max Weber, endogenous moderniza¬
tion presupposes a secular approach which
detaches social life from a naturalistic or religious
view of the universe, is based on practical reason,
and makes respect for the individual the keystone
of its ethic. It also presupposes the autonomy of
civil society vis-à-vis the state; and this in turn-
as many analysts, starting with Jean-Jacques Rous¬
seau, have pointed outimplies a certain equali¬
ty of conditions and thus the existence of an
egalitarian principle, which may be religious or
republican. Finally, it presupposes a structured
civil society, whose members can be represented
and therefore organized in such a way that polit¬
ical forces can be "representative"; this is the
most visible and concrete expression of
democracy.
Such a condensed analysis may seem too ab¬
stract, but, being confined to essentials, it clear¬
ly situates the problem of democracy and gives
a precise meaning to the seemingly surprising
proposition with which I beganthat demo¬
cracy and development may find themselves in
mutual opposition.
Two worlds
The history of recent centuries has been that of
a gradually widening division between a world
capable of endogenous development, and there¬
fore of democracy, and another world (dominat¬
ed, moreover, by the first), engaged in exogenous
development, along a traditionalist, populist or
even national-revolutionary line traced out in
authoritarian fashion by a ruling national or
foreign élite.
In the first of these two worlds are to be
found not only the central core of modern,
democratic countries, but also a number of'
peripheral countries where development, and
democracy, are fragile. Many countries general¬
ly considered to be in an intermediate position,
such as India and some Latin American countries,
in fact belong to this category.
The second of the two worlds consists of two
distinct groups. On the one hand there are the
modernizing, authoritarian states which proclaim
the concepts of rationalization and secularization
borrowed from the first world (for example, the
communist countries). On the other hand there
are states in which the ruling élite calls for unity
and talks of the destiny of a people, a communi¬
ty, a nation (for example, the Third World coun¬
tries). Thus we have four categories of countries
grouped in two pairs: a central core of countries
of endogenous development (group 1); moderniz¬
ing, voluntarist, authoritarian countries (group
2); peripheral countries with limited endogenous
development (group 3); the "new-community"
countries (group 4).
This century has seen, first, an accelerating
shift of initiative from the countries of group 1
to those of group 2 (beginning with the Soviet
Revolution), then to the group 3 countries (with
the accelerated modernization of the intermedi¬
ate countries) and, finally, to the countries of
group 4 (the real Third World countries, aroused
by nationalistic, community, and even sometimes
theocratic movements). Then, in a second phase, 21

came the almost simultaneous collapse of all the
models of voluntarist, exogenous development,
the triumph of the democracies, and the increas¬
ing attraction of the democratic model for the
countries of groups 2 and 3 and even, in some
cases, of group 4.
Once the opposition between democratic, en¬
dogenous development and authoritarian, ex¬
ogenous development is recognized, it is easy to
see that the most difficult task is to transform an
exogenous impulse into an endogenous develop¬
ment mechanism. These terms may seem far from
the historical realities as we perceive them; but
they are not. Bismarck's Germany, the Italy built
by Cavour, the Japan of the Meiji era and even,
for a time, the Turkey of Kemal Ataturk, suc¬
ceeded, following action initiated by the state, in
creating a class of independent actors on the so¬
cial scenebusinessmen, trade unionists, adminis¬
trators and scientiststhus combining the
dynamism of modernization with an autonomous
civil society and setting in motion what
economists term "self-sustaining growth".
However, this process has only succeeded in
societies in which major factors conducive to en¬
dogenous development already existed, as well as
the preliminaries of modernizationa develop¬
ing education system, freedom of thought, free¬
dom of trade, and concentration of capital. The
longer the path to be followed the greater the risk
that the authoritarian mobilization of a society
will become an end in itself and will be diverted
into despotism with the creation of new inflexible
structures and new privileges. In place of ration¬
alism, planning and education comes the instal¬
lation of a powerful nomenklatura, a rigid
bureaucracy and the rejection of innovative ideas.
The turnaround is even more marked where
affirmation of nationhood becomes virtually the
sole objective. Where an abundance of natural
resources enables a country to survive severe eco¬
nomic disarray such nationalistic tendencies can
take extreme forms.
The last third of this century, and in partic¬
ular the period which began with the 1980s, has
been dominated by these powerful regressive
processes, which are finally leading on the one
hand to the destruction of communist regimes
and on the other to the deterioration of national
liberation movements into corrupt, authorita¬
rian regimes serving the interests of privileged
clienteles.
Meanwhile, temporarily thrown off balance
by the oil crises and by the rapid rise of real in¬
comes and social benefits to the detriment of in¬
vestment, the central core of democratic countries
are again calling on their capacity for endogenous
development. A wave of new technologies is
appearing; education, research and, it must be
admitted, armaments programmes are being
strengthened.
Ways out of crisis
This turnaround is giving rise to a rebirth of the
democratic theme and to the decline of the idea
of revolution. In 1989 France celebrated the bi¬
centenary of a Revolution which it saw as the
forerunner of democracy, not as the harbinger
of the Soviet Revolution.
In Latin America, the further south one looks
the more the revolutionary ideal is giving way
to aspirations for democracy. In Chile, the gener¬
al desire to avoid a total rupture has led to the
triumph of the more moderate elements of the
opposition.

It is in the East European countries, however,
that the most spectacular turnaround is taking
place. In the German Democratic Republic,
Czechoslovakia, Hungary and Poland, the
democratic "repertoire"to use Charles Tilly's
apt expressionis supplanting the revolutionary
menu. Violence in the streets, the storming of
official buildings, the use of arms, is giving way
to appeals for free elections and an absence of
killing and vengeance. A society is rebuilding
itself, while inflammatory appeals to the people,
to the earthy forces of the proletariat, are heard
no more. In the autumn of 1989, mankind lived
through some of its finest hours and the destruc¬
tion of the Berlin wall put an end to the era
of revolutions which had begun two centuries
earlier with the taking of the Bastille.
These were moving, inspiring sights for all
those who believe that man creates his own his¬
tory rather than being subject to the laws of fate,
whether they be the laws of tradition or of what
we call "progress". We must not, however, naively
interpret this as a "happy ending" which will see
all the nations which had lost their way return
to the strait and narrow path of democratic
modernization. It is true that these nations are
emerging from a dictatorship which was supposed
to be the dictatorship of the proletariat but which
became that of a party and of an ideological
machine and a police state. Yet this does not give
them automatic entry into a democratic system.
Other ways out are possible, and the deeper the
political and economic crisis the more open
they are.
The first way, other than that leading to
democracy, will lead to chaos, if the decomposi¬
tion of the old order prevents the formation of
a new system. There would be a certain terrible
logic in such an outcome for regimes that have
prevented the formation of active members of
society and thus leave behind them a social
vacuum often destined to be filled with political
infighting.
After the fall of its dictator, Romania, where
a diversified, autonomous society has never ex¬
isted and where power has been held by a suc¬
cession of dictatorships and hereditary rulers,
appeared to be on the brink of chaos.
The second way leads to an extreme form of
economic liberalism. If there are no social actors,
if the old regime has stifled the forces of libera¬
tion, if those responsible for running the econo¬
my are incapable of adapting to the demands of
the market, many voices will be raised in favour
of market forces as society's sole guide and for
a massive injection of foreign capital, goods
and methods. In 1990, when Poland adopted
a policy of raw liberalization, prices soared
and the standard of living of ordinary people
collapsed yet the government became more
popular than ever. It seemed as if the entire
country was aware that the old conception of
man must disappear so that a new kind of
man could be born of the constraints and oppor¬
tunities of the market.
In Latin America, this appears to be the most
tempting policy. There is a call for a return to
outward-looking development, for increasing the
gap between a modern sector which can become
integrated into the world market and an infor¬
mal, marginal, poor sector. The most extreme
example of this exaggerated duality is the trade
in drugs, which is Latin America's biggest trans¬
national undertaking and which, even if the
farmers who earn more for growing coca are
included, concentrates resources in the hands of a
few, while the rest of the population is entrapped
in crisis, violence and corruption resulting from
the outflow of capital.
At the same time, the economies of the cen¬
tral core of democratic countries are experienc¬
ing a growing imbalance between capital
movements and trade in goods and services, the
former having become between twenty and fifty
times more important than the latter.
A third way is that taken by societies whose 23

active members are defined not by their produc¬
tive role but by their defence of a collective iden¬
tity. Nationalist movements are arising on the
ruins of voluntarist, modernizing, authoritarian
policies. In the Soviet Union, Armenians and
Azerbaijanis have become embroiled in a civil
war which could be duplicated in other Soviet
republics as well as outside the Soviet Union.
Those who thought that nationalism was a spent
force that would be replaced by class struggles
within a modern economy were sadly mistaken.
The Austrian Marxists of the late nineteenth
century and the Leninists themselves failed in
their attempts to associate social with national
struggles. Leninism-Maoism was the most power¬
ful political movement of the mid-twentieth cen¬
tury, but the union of the anti-capitalist and
anti-imperialist struggles that it hoped to create
under the leadership of a communist party was
soon seen to be an artificial one. Revolutionary
groups became bogged down in terrorist activi¬
ties which were a feature of the break-up of
Leninism in Uruguay and Argentina, as they
were in Turkey and Iran.
In addition to these non-democratic paths
there is also the possibility of a militaristic reac¬
tion on the part of threatened regimes which,
maintain themselves in power solely by repres¬
sive measures, thus ensuring their own eventual
self-asphyxiation.
None of these possible solutions can be con¬
sidered democratic, since, in each case, political
choice disappears and the absolute power of the
dictator is replaced by another form of absolute
power, that of the centres of decision that govern
the market, that of extreme nationalist groups or
that of violence.
Enemies of democracy
While it may be true that democracy is not a
form of society but a political regime, a govern¬
ment cannot be called democratic simply because
it raises the standard of living, increases the level
of school enrolment or the life expectancy of the
population. There is no democracy if there is no
choice between the representative groups within
a local or national community. What are the rules
of the game if there are neither players nor play¬
ing field?
Most of the world today is firmly attached
to the democratic ideal, as is shown by the fall
of military regimes in Brazil, Argentina, Uru¬
guay, Paraguay and Chile, the end of the monop¬
oly of communist parties in Poland, Hungary,
Czechoslovakia, Bulgaria and, to some extent
also, in the Soviet Union and Romania, as well
as the disappearance of leftist tendencies opposed
to the principle of parliamentary elections in the
Western countries.
All these developments are in conformity
with the general principles on the basis of which
I have attempted to define democracy the recog¬
nized existence of a society not subject to absolute

<![CDATA[
state power and as little segmented and hierar¬
chically arranged as possible; the recognition of
rationalization as a key factor in social conflicts
which should combine opposition of interests or
ideas with the notion of the general interest; and
acceptance of the ethical principle of the abso¬
lute right of individuals to the widest possible
freedom of belief and action.
Political philosophers have long sought a
sufficient basis for democracy in institutional
arrangementsfree elections, the separation of
powers, the absence of personal privilegebut
these are descriptions of democratic institutions
rather than an analysis of the fundamentals of
democracy. What I am showing here is that the
existence of democracy depends first of all upon a
double limitation of political and social power by
acknowledgement of rationality and its constraints
and by reference to some form of natural law.
Democracy also requires the greatest possible
social integration and, at the same time, the exis¬
tence of groups of ideas and interests which can
be represented.
In other words, social and cultural segmenta¬
tion are just as much enemies of democracy as are
an overriding appeal to a unifying principle or the
subordination of society to a voluntarist state
which itself takes the place of the active members
of that society.
The need for active participation
in public life
All the prerequisites for the existence of democra¬
cy that have just been mentioned are of a similar
nature. Democracy is possible in so far as the
population of a country constitutes a politically
active whole. It is weakened or disappears where
political choices are determined by a non-social
logicloyalty to a national spirit, the integration
of a community, the will of a ruler, even moder¬
nization itself. Those who equate democracy with
a market economy are just as mistaken as those
who qualify as democratic a regime that emerges
from a revolution or a national liberation move¬
ment supported by the majority of the popula¬
tion. Where there is much abstention from
political life, where national unity is undermined
by strongly marked ethnic, regional, language, re¬
ligious or life-style differences, or where there is
great social inequality, it is difficult to form a po¬
litically active system, a forum for debate and free
political institutions.
Of course, we must not confuse countries that
are less than perfect democracies with those that
are dragged down into chaos and disarray or with
those that overtly sanction forms of discrimina¬
tion or segregation. The fall of a dictatorship does
not automatically entail the installation of a
democracy; this depends primarily on the
democratic spirit, on the ability and the desire to
participate, through free and representative insti¬
tutions, in the creation and application of the law
by citizens and under their control.
How far we are from those anti-social theories
of democracy which explain democracy in the
wealth of a nation, in its beliefs or even in its size.
How urgent it is to seek every possible means to
increase political activity and the ability to debate
and make choices and to combine diversity of in¬
terests with social integration.
We have learned in the last few years, and even
more clearly in the last few months, that democra¬
cy is more opposed to than associated with revo¬
lution, that it requires a great capacity for
endogenous modernization and that, if it is to
be strong, it must reduce social and cultural gaps,
but we are still not sufficiently convinced that
it requires above all a strong participation in
public life.
Some are even tempted to support the notion
that political passion is a threat to democracy and
that a degree of apathy contributes to the smooth
running of institutions. This idea is as unacceptable
as the opposing viewpoint which confuses
democracy with mass demonstrations, for it has
the effect of reducing democracy to freedom for
those who play an active role in economic life.
There is, in fact, no democracy where political
life is subject to any logic other than its own.
Democracy is based on the most active possible
participation by the greatest possible number of
people in the making and application of political
decisions.

COMPASSION
The celebrated Mexican
writer urges vigilance in the
face of growing
bureaucratization and
despotic and intolerant
doctrines of all kinds
%E are living at a particularly difficult time,
a time when there is an intellectual vacuum in
the world of political philosophy. The collapse
of the great systems constructed in the last cen¬
tury is coinciding with the appearance through¬
out the world of political and economic
institutions which constitute a new social group,
a class which, for want of a more accurate term,
we call a "bureaucracy".
In some countries, this bureaucracy is iden¬
tified with an ideology or a state. Elsewhere, if
the political and technocratic bureaucracy plays
a decisive role, as it does in Mexico for example,
its power is far from being absolute. This new
class is universal: it has invested and invaded the
great capitalist enterprises of the West and Japan,
and the political regimes of Eastern Europe, not
to mention powerful institutions such as the CIA,
and the governments of some developing
countries.
The vacuum in political and social ideas is a
result of twentieth-century history. It is an aspect
of the great crisis of modern post-industrial civili¬
zation. Until the 1930s many people, including
myself, thought that only the socialist revolution
could resolve the contradictions in our societies.
But since then we have seen the failure of the ex¬
periment which began with the Bolshevik Revo¬
lution of 1917. It has been a social failure, because
it has been unable to provide freedom and equal¬
ity; it has been an economic failure because the
wealth that was supposed to be created did not
materialize. The only triumph was political or,
rather, military.
The end of ideology
The idea of revolution, however, has received a
serious blow and has lost almost all its appeal,
notably in the developed countries. Even in
Mexico, where the intellectualsthe heirs of the
clerics and courtiers of the seventeenth and eight¬
eenth centuriesare singularly impervious to
criticism, the left has begun a process of ideolog¬
ical detoxification. But the disappearance of Uto¬
pian ideology which is noticeable even in the

artist Gilberto Frometa Fernandez. 27

OCTAVIO PAZ,
Mexican poet and essayist, is one
of the most outstanding writers in
the Spanish language today. He
served as his country's ambassador
to India during the 1960s, and
now lives in Mexico City where he
is director of the monthly review
Vuelta. Many of his volumes of
poetry have been published in En¬
glish translation, including a bilin¬
gual edition of The Collected
Poems, 1957-1987 (New Directions
Publishing Corporation, USA,
1987). English translations of his
essays include The Labyrinth of
Solitude (Grove Press, New York,
1985) and One Earth, Four or Five
Worlds: Reflections on Contem¬
porary History (Harcourt Brace
Jovanovich, New York, 1985). A
longer version of this article has
appeared in the Japanese magazine

USSR, through the constructive reforms of
Mikhail Gorbachev, does not mean the birth of
a new political philosophy. As far as social ideals
and collective morality are concerned, there is a
gaping void. Peoples and states are drifting.
The moral criticism of capitalism by Marx
and the anarchists is still largely valid. Similarly,
the liberal critique of despotism and state social¬
ism, what Engels called "cartel socialism", is as
relevant as ever. The same could be said of the
critique of the iniquities of the modern world
made by Christianity and other religions. But the
foundations of the political ideologies which have
motivated twentieth-century mansocialism,
liberalism and othershave been relegated to the
sidelines since the Second World War.
Today we are confronted with the perils of
nuclear holocaust and environmental degrada¬
tion, which threaten world peace and the very
survival of the human race. Neither of these two
scourges can be imputed to the injustices of
capitalism or the evils of socialism: they both
result from the very nature of modern societies.
The bomb and the pollution of the planet are the
result of technological progress and not of a par¬
ticular ideology. Reality has reduced ideology to
rubble.
Without wishing to make prophecies, we can
say that in this great historical vacuum democra¬
cy is the only regime which is still showing signs
of life. But democracy is not a panacea. It is a
]]>

<![CDATA[
form of conviviality, a system for preventing
people from killing each other, for ensuring that
the reins of government change hands peacefully,
and for enabling heads of state to come to power
via the ballot-box. Democracy teaches us to live
together and nothing else. I hope that one day,
a day that I shall perhaps never see since I am
seventy-five years old, a new form of political
thought will emerge and reconcile the liberal and
the socialist traditions.
In the Mexican intellectual microcosm, all
that can be done at present is blow away the dust
and the cobwebs, open the windows and let in
some light, maintain a critical approach and a
healthy scepticism of easy solutions. Irony is one
ingredient in criticism, but it is also born of dis¬
enchantment. We belong to a disenchanted gener¬
ation. And we also lack something of imagination
and compassion.
I have used the word irony in the sense in
which it was used by the French artist Marcel
Duchampan irony which goes beyond irony
and cancels itself out by mocking itself. Irony is
subjective, the reaction of the self to the stupid
or criminal seriousness of the objective world.
The ironical man laughs at others but also at him¬
self: "meta-irony" consists in going further than
the dialogue with the self, in mocking the self
which mocks the world. If irony is cruel, meta-
irony dissolves the cruelty.
Transposing these aesthetic ideas to morality
and politics, I believe that the political writer
should show a little irony in his dealings with
himself and othershe should be less sure of him¬
self, know that he does not possess infallible
recipes, and recognize that there are no absolute
truths. And through the practice of meta-irony,
keep a hold on compassion and pity.
The vile dictatorships which we have endured
in the twentieth century have been rooted in mer¬
ciless ideologies. I can accept that many of them,
as in the case of Stalin, were perversions of altruis¬
tic doctrines, but it must also be admitted that
these doctrines contained the seeds of despotism
and intolerance.
In their profound wisdom, the theologians
of old considered pride to be the sin of Satan.
Among mankind, this sin is born of the claim to
possess absolute truth. It is an evil which has poi¬
soned the twentieth century in the guise of
science and philosophy.
Criticism is the only antidote to this moral
poison. When people understand that they do not
possess the absolute truth and that all truths, es¬
pecially political truths, are relative, then there
is room for irony and pitytowards others and
towards themselves. This is what our century
lacksa resurrection of pity. One of the most
beautiful features of Buddhism is that Buddhist
sages are always smiling. And their smile express¬
es irony and pity.... The smile of the Buddhist
sages should be introduced into politics.

V^onversation about the weather only really
becomes interesting, the Polish humorist
Stanislaw J. Lee once said, when the first signs
of the end of the world start to appear. The same
might well be said of the futurethere is little
point in talking about it except when important
chronological events are looming, for chronology
is the daughter of eschatology.
Both chronology and eschatology are born
of the inability of homo sapiens to master intellec¬
tually the phenomenon of time. Man does his best
to domesticate this phenomenon and make it
comply with his rational faculties, which are
themselves its offspring. Hence all our devices for
measuring timeour speedometers, calendars,
months, years, decades, centuries and millennia.
Hence too our linear concept of time and its
division into past, present and future.
The paradox of such a division, especially in
relation to the future, is that it is based on the
alternation of day and night, which results from
the rotation of the planet around its own axis and
around the sun in a never-ending cycle. An earth-
dweller might be compared with a child on a
merry-go-round who is absolutely certain that he
and his horse are not trotting where he mounted
it but in some vast beyond. The only difference
is that our merry-go-round is in perpetual motion
and never stops.
It is to movement, cyclical though it may be,
that the earth-dweller tends to relate all kinds of
change change of place, of flora and fauna, of
circumstances, of state of mind. This is because
man operates on a very small scale, travelling not
from one star to another, but from doorway to

doorway. It is the different appearance of the
doors, the diversity of the occupants of a building
or of the passers-by, that create a feeling of
progression and lead him to see movement itself
as the source of a new quality.
That, in reality, is what the future isthe
notion of something qualitatively new. And chro¬
nology is like the numbers of the houses in a long
street leading towards this qualitatively new
something. The vanishing point of this street, this
avenue, this perspective, is lost in the mists of
grammar, since in most languages, at least in most
Indo-European languages, the relationship be¬
tween future time and the verbal expression of
it has always been somewhat strained. This
reflects the contradiction between man's aware¬
ness of his biologically imposed limitations and
the relatively boundless nature of his speculative
capacities.
Man's way of thinking, in short, has a
marked tendency towards the undefined, or the
Utopian, as it is more usually termed. This quality
finds full expression both in the workings of the
memory and in those of the imagination. Specu¬
lation about the future provides an opportunity
for the expression and satisfaction of imaginative
thought. The future is always, at the very least,
the utopia of a specific person. When attempts
to give it a reality come up against the grammat¬
ical difficulties mentioned above, chronology
comes to the rescue.
Like any transposition of ordinary speech
into the language of figures, chronology tends to
simplify the problem. In this context the future
takes on the aspect of the infinite in mathemat¬
ics; the figures merely get larger, forming a link
between a biologically limited body and a vanish¬
ing point that is physically inaccessible but which
the mind can envisage. Whenever we come to a
round figure (a date), whether it be the end of
a decade, a century or a millennium, society, 31

JOSEPH BRODSKY,

without really knowing why, enters a period of
effervescence and, myopic though it is by nature,
indulges in an orgy of peering into the distance
and speculation about world change. This
phenomenon is known as millenarianism.
Since chronology itself is non-semantic, a
chronological event is, in fact, a non- or an anti-
event. The future, that is to say the qualitatively
new, bursts upon the life of an individual or
nation without warning, although it seems to
have a predilection for odd numbers (1939, for
example). In most cases it comes in the guise of
a scientific discovery, a technological innovation,
war, or an impoverishment of the language. Only
very rarely does it take the form of social change,
perhaps because the possibilities in that field are
extremely limited; after all, the only choice is
between various shades of autocracy or
democracy.
The most common guise in which the future
makes its appearance is that of accelerationin
the speed of locomotion, in musical rhythms or
in new weapons systems. The latter presuppose
a larger number of objects to be destroyed, while
the former usually herald a way of looking at the
world which is compatible with the act of pull¬
ing a trigger or, rather, of pressing a button. In
this century, the future may be said to have begun
with the first rhythms of boogie-woogie, which
abolished forever the notion of quiet little solos,
thus paralleling the fate of the notion of personal
tragedy in the perspective of a nuclear catas¬
trophe. The twenty-first century can be said to
have burst upon our time with the appearance
of remote-control devices for changing from one
television channel to another. Flickering scenes
of angry crowds alternating on the screen with
advertisements for orange juice or new cars seem
like a prophetic reflection of our psychological
landscape. The rapidity with which new objects
are brought to our attention prepares the mind
for the demographic reality of the chronological
perspective we call the future.
In fact, it is the chronological perspective
itself that intrudes on the contemporary outlook.
Born of our thought faculties, the future makes
every effort to arrive at the earliest possible mo¬
ment so as to make a better match between our
powers of imagination and reality, and to recon¬
cile the infinite with the finite and utopias with
their creators. As a general rule, the irruption of
the future into the present is felt as being a source
of discomfort, if not of downright discourage¬
ment. It might be said that the voice of the fu¬
ture can be heard in almost everything that we
regard as aggressive or unpleasant, since it is try¬
ing to carve a place for itself in the present. All
the betrayals of which we are the victims, or
which we ourselves commit, are also the voice
of the future in the present. This is not only be¬
cause betrayals are always committed in the name
of the future, never of the past or the present,
but also because they bring into our lives some¬
thing newa word which is, after all, synony¬
mous with the future.
Talking about the future, therefore, is psy¬
chologically unbearable and philosophically both
intolerable and inconceivable. If the future means
anything, it means our own absence. The first
thing we shall discover when we look closely at
]]>

the future is our non-existence there. The notion
of non-existence impels us either to adopt a reli¬
gious attitude or turns us back to our own reali¬
ties, making us retreat from the language of
figures into that of semantics and from the
chronological vanishing point to our own door¬
step. With those who dwell in this house we can
at least speak of the future in purely political
terms and without looking too far ahead. What
follows, therefore, are a few words on the decade
ahead from a man who still lives in this house
the monologue of an inhabitant of the present.
A world in the throes
of change
The ten years that remain before the beginning
of the third millennium will undoubtedly give
rise to a millenarian view of the world which,
encouraged by its inevitable promotion by the
media, will quickly become epidemic. It will
probably take the form of ecological radicalism
with a strong tinge of common-or-garden escha¬
tology. The feeling that the endof the century,
of the millennium, of the established order of
thingsis nigh, coupled with increasingly fre¬
quent ecological catastrophes, may well take
lethal or suicidal forms. The horror of our own
mortality is never more effectively stifled than
when the clamour of lamentations about univer¬
sal destruction rings in our ears.

To this must be added the problems associated
with a gigantic demographic explosion, as a result
of which a high proportion of those now ex¬
periencing a period of relative well-being will find
themselves among the world's excluded. The
overriding need for a common denominator, the
absence of any even slightly convincing or acces¬
sible ideology and, above all, the anti-individualist
sentiment of an overpopulated world may well
bring together under the banner of ecology the
most diverse groups and types of discontent. The
end of a century, and even more the end of a
millennium, is always marked by the notion of
a forthcoming change in the world order. The
more unintelligible the notion, the more attrac¬
tive it is. We can always take consolation from
the thought that a new Thomas Miintzer* will
speak but one language, probably European, and
that this, coupled with geographical constraints,
will somewhat limit the scope of national or
international psychosis and prevent it from
becoming universal.
Leaving aside this desire to reorganize the
world, the catastrophism inherent in millenarian
thought could find expression in religious or
ethnic wars. By about the year 2000, what is
referred to as the white race will account for only
11 per cent of the world's population. It is not
unimaginable that the radical wing of the Muslim
world will come into confrontation with what
remains of Christian civilization. Conflicts of this
kind seem inevitable if only because the more
complex the picture presented by reality, the
greater the temptation to simplify it.
Such conflicts will inevitably be bloody, but
temporary. However, the equivalent of a third
world war looms in the prospect of an economic
war probably situated in western Eurasia and,
perhaps, the United States of America. The
absence of international anti-trust regulations,
particularly in banking, makes it possible to
foresee a level of competition that nothing,
absolutely nothing, will be able to curb, a situa¬
tion in which no holds will be barred and the goal
will be dominance. The battles in such a war will
be supra-national in character, but the victory
will always be nationalit will go to the nation
to which the victor belongs.
Germany and Japan will doubtless be in¬
volved. The reunification of Germany, if it comes
abouton the same principle of simplifying
complexitieswill establish in the heart of Europe
a financial and industrial monster without equal.
Financial power usually takes various forms of
expansioneconomic, political and cultural.
Unlike its predecessors, the new Reich will, for
purely hedonistic reasons, embark upon a Drang

per cent of the inhabitants of the island of Ischia

killing. As the descendants of Wotan have at last
come to understand, indebtedness is a much surer
method of occupation than an army garrison.
The only means whereby Europe can defend
itself against this kind of expansion could be to
form alliances or financial and political blocs. No
country alone will be able to stand up to the com¬
petition of the German giant. The most reason¬
able thing to do would be to establish such blocs
on cultural or historical bases. There might, for
example, be a financial and political alliance be¬
tween Italy, Spain and France, or between the
present Comecon countries. One might also
envisage groupings such as that of the Scandina¬
vian countries and the United Kingdom with the
Benelux countries. The project for a united
Europe is not just a variation of such alliances.
On the contrary, it is the autobahn, the highway
that will enable Germany, whether reunited or
not, to pursue the objective, whether consciously
or not, towards which its rising financial power
is impelling it.
There is little hope that such alliances will
materialize. If they are to be made, it will have
to be before 1995, since, if the forecasters are to
be believed, Germany, whether reunited or not,
will by then have achieved so great an economic
superiority over its European partners that the
expansion mentioned above will have become
both inevitable and irreversible.
A similar situation is likely to develop in the
East for Japan. However, the formation of op¬
posing blocs is even more hypothetical than in
Europe, especially since the Japanese expansionist
drive is directed towards the east and west rather
the south. It is even conceivable that a Berlin-
Tokyo financial and political axis might be es¬
tablished. Today, the Land of the Rising Sun is
acting in a manner increasingly reminiscent of
that adopted by another island empire on which,
fifty years ago, the sun never set.
The outlook for 1995
As far as one can judge, around 1995, the world,
with or without blocs, will be in much the same
situation as it was in 1905. Geography, or at least
the geography of Europe, offers history only a
limited number of possible variants, and this
number is inversely proportional to the rate of
population growth. It is very likely that, once
liberated from the encumbrance of communism,
the countries of Eastern Europe (territorially
equivalent to the former Austro-Hungarian
Empire) will find themselves as debtor nations.
France, Italy, Spain and Portugal will, of course,
retain their administrative and territorial integrity,
but in political terms they may well be subject
to a certain "Finlandization" in relation to Ger¬
many. The same will be true in northern Europe,
although for ethnic reasons the situation will be
less evident. The United Kingdom and the Balkan
countries, involved as they are in ethnic conflicts
and contradictions, will doubtless be less affected
by these changes. The United States will doubt¬
less experience a similar situation which, coupled
with economic problems, might well lead it back
to a policy of relative isolationism.
In Russia too the year 1995, like the year
1990, will be reminiscent of the year 1905. It will
be a period devoted to the elaboration of new
constitutional norms and the struggle to main¬
tain the country intact. It will not matter much
who is head of state. It will probably be the same
man as today, unless he loses his grip or succumbs
to the task in some other manner. He is more
likely to end up in this fashion than to be the
victim of a power struggle, since it is difficult to
imagine that anyone would lay claim to power
over the chaos and contradictions to which the
country will be subject during the coming decade.
This chaos and these contradictions are, in
fact, a guarantee of the stability of a power that
is attempting to create order out of chaos and
to find solutions to problems. The range of
problems facing the Soviet head of state is enor¬
mous, since it is directly proportionate to the
seventy-year period which gave birth to them.
Today they have become organic and any
attempt to find a radical solution to them can
only be tautological, plunging the country back
into the seventy-year period that engendered the
problems in the first place. Their solution re¬
quires a qualitatively different approach, the
elaboration of which will be enough to keep the
country occupied over the years to come.
It is very likely that problems created over
several decades will in turn take several decades
to resolve. This is the case, however much we
would like things to be otherwise. Despite all

imaginable democratic reforms, the Russia of 1995
is likely to be in a state of chronic crisis, the sole
argument in its defence being its organic nature.
Paradoxical though it may seem, what is happen¬
ing in the Soviet Union today fascinates us by
the extraordinary impression it gives of existen¬
tial truthnobody knows how to live. Any po¬
litical system, including democracy, provides a
means of escape from this truth. It is to the credit
of the present Soviet government that it is not
attempting or is not in a position to simplify,
either for itself or for its citizens, the complex
existential pattern with which it is faced.
However this may be, the role of Russia in
international relations, especially within Europe,
will bear much the same weight as it did in 1905.
Whoever comes to power in the Soviet Union
in the near future will inherit problems rather
than solutions. The fact that the present head of
state may not be universally approved of by the
people is to his credit. This disaffection is that
felt by a patient towards his doctor and is evi¬
dence that the country is convalescing, at least
morally. Only a demagogue could hope to retain
the affection of a people consisting of almost 300
million individuals.
A tropical fever
As far as one can judge, this state of chronic crisis
is likely to become the norm of political and eco¬
nomic life more or less everywhere. The days of
clear, radical solutions to national and interna¬
tional problems, including the use of armed force,
and the era of consensus and unanimity on all
political and economic questions, are over. And
with current population growth, democratic
processes themselves are being modified. The
weight of the masses involved in politics is
modifying the very concept of a minority, since
a minority can consist of a few dozen or, in the
case of a democratized China, hundreds of mil¬
lions of individuals.
This is why no revolution, even in a relatively
small country, will be decisive and, more impor¬
tant still, no ideology will be dominant. Revolu¬
tions, should there be any, will not be linked to
this or that philosophical doctrine, since none of
them will enjoy absolute authority, but will erupt
in a spontaneous, almost hysterical fashion. Those
who take over the reins of power will not be able
to hold them for long, despite the new means that
will be at their disposal to control peoples. What
will be called revolutions or revolutionary
changes will be no more than stages in the
chronic crisis already mentioned.
The countries of Latin America and Africa
will be the first to be affected. In the coming
decade it is likely that, in the eyes of the so-called
civilized West, these geographical areas will not
have the same political importance. In a sense,
these countries will be the victims of the changes
that have occurred in Eastern Europe, which
promise to offer the West a source of cheap,
qualified labour. The industrially advanced coun¬
tries of the West will concentrate their political
and financial attention on Eastern Europe to the
detriment of Third World countries. Having
ceased to be the arena for superpower rivalries,
Africa in particular will, more than today, be
exposed to hunger and epidemics, as well,
perhaps, as to more deliberate attempts to adapt
political forms copied from abroad to its own
traditions. Monstrous as such transformations
may turn out to be, they seem to signal the end
of the period of decolonization. At the same time,
the West will be able to justify its actions by
pointing out that it has transferred its interest
from Third World countries to other parts of
Eurasia.
This change of direction will not, of course,
be definitive. Poverty and more especially over¬
population in the Third World will continue to
offer a tempting source of cheap labour and com¬
mercial opportunities. During the coming decade,
however, the industrially developed countries,
subject to waves of immigration and a consider¬
able increase in their own populations, will find
themselves in their turn facing conditions similar
to those faced by their former proteges. In a sense,
this phenomenon of chronic crisis with its alter¬
nations between severity and remission resembles
a tropical fever which the northern hemisphere
has caught and which it must suffer in retribu¬
tion for what it has done in the southern
hemisphere.
If only half the propositions expounded here
prove to be true, the coming decade will be that
of a new egalitarianism. Traditional ideas about
the unique nature of national, ethnic and cultural 35

characteristics will give way to recognition of a
common denominatorthe state of crisis facing
most national economies. This new egalitarianism
will find expression first in the erosion of purely
cultural specificities. Already, the education
system of more than one developed country is
being modified considerably towards acceptance
of a new ecumenicism. Already, voices can be
heard expounding metaphysical relativism and
the notion that all religions are of equal validity,
which amounts to giving intolerance and toler¬
ance the same standing. Already, the concept of
an "international style" exists, especially in the
plastic arts.
There seems little prospect that society will
become more just in the coming decade. The best
we can hope for is that it will be no more unjust
than the one we know today. The sole guaran¬
tee of a relatively just society is the moral sense
of its members, but it is difficult to see how eco¬
nomic necessity could become a driving force for
moral education. At best the society of the future
will be an egoistic, indifferent society devoid of
any moral standard at all. The only hope for such
a society lies in the demographic extension of this
egoism and indifference which will force it to
organize itself on a technological rather than an
ideological basis and incite man to put his trust
in a computer rather than in his neighbours. In
this way, at least for a time, we will be able to
avoid bloodshed, since no one is going to throw
himself, knife in hand, onto a machine.
This is why the best thing we can do is to
leave the future in peace and make an effort to
organize the present as intelligently as possible,
paying more attention to those who are close to
or distant from us in space rather than in time.
Those who come after us, who will live in our
towns and our apartments and sleep in our
bedrooms, will neither thank us nor curse us for
the state in which we have left the world to them,
just as we neither thank nor curse our predeces¬
sors, occupied as we are with more current
problems and feelings.
What we see as the future will be the present
of those who come after us. This is why the best
thing to do is to build houses and hospitals for
those who need them now, making them solid
and not too ugly. It is better to act with justice
now than to count on the future triumph of
justice and common sense. Our actions today will
affect the flora and fauna, the natural surround¬
ings of our successors just as the environment of
those who are now twenty or thirty years old
is the result of the combined efforts of Le Cor¬
busier and the Luftwaffe. If only for this reason,
we should not credit the future with an enviable
superiority or with special qualities. It would be
equally dangerous to envy our successors and to
weave all kinds of dreams around the society of
the future. It is quite possible that we are in an
enviable position since, when we do good, or
harm too for that matter, at least we know who
is affected.

'NO ONE WILL STOP US...'
BY DESMOND TUTU
Freedom and human rights are major issues in
Eastern Europe today. Isn't that also the case in
South Africa?
Yes, and the movement towards freedom and
respect for human rights in Eastern Europe is as
exciting as the potential for the same movement
in South Africa.
However, there are clear differences between
the two situations. The oppression of the
majority of people in South Africa has been on
the basis of race. The iniquity of racism is that
it leads people who feel superior to others to treat
them as less than human. So racists facing mass
protests are, for example, less hesitant in ordering
police or troops to kill demonstrators than
rulers who feel they would be killing their com¬
patriots. In most East European countriesthe
exception being Romania the rulers appear to
have been more restrained than in South Africa.
In addition, many people in Eastern Europe
have had more opportunities to control their lives
and to participate in economic development than
our people have had in South Africa. There has
been a tradition of democratic experience in
previous eras in many East European countries.
In South Africa our people have suffered racial 37

ART AGAINST APARTHEID
"Apartheid: a harsh, mean word that resounds in one's ears like
a trapdoor opening beneath a gallows" (Michel Lerris).
Artists of the World Against Apartheid, an association founded
with support from the United Nations in 1982, has built up an
important collection of works of art donated by their creators in
response to an appeal to the world's artists and intellectuals to
demonstrate publicly their belief in freedom and human dignity
and to protest against racial discrimination in South Africa.
The collection, comprising some 200 works by artists of inter¬
national reputation, has been exhibited in many parts of the world.
A specially produced catalogue includes texts by noted contem¬
porary writers such as Jorge Amado, André Brink, Julio Cortázar
and Michel Leiris.
The collection will form the basis of a future museum against
apartheid and will be presented to the first free and democratic
government of South Africa to be elected by universal suffrage.
oppression for three hundred years. They have
constantly struggled to be able to participate in
a democratic system but they have never achieved
it. Economically, for the whole of the industri¬
alized era our people have been denied opportu¬
nities for learning and for jobs because of the
colour of their skins. As a result, as we begin to
see a democracy emerge in South Africa, we are
going to need massive international assistance to
give the opportunities for industrial development
which our people have never had throughout
their history.
Is there, in your opinion, a link between
democracy and development?
Development depends on democracy. People
are decision-making creatures. God has given
them free will and they must be able to exercise
control over development through a democratic
political system if they are to feel fully involved
in it. Development which is imposed on people
in a paternalistic way, on the basis of big brother
knowing what is good for people, will fail.
In South Africa in particular, is there truly a
movement towards democracy? To what extent
is the system of apartheid coming to an end?
In many ways, we are now where we were in
1960. Our political organizations are again un¬
banned and able to operate more freely than in
the past thirty years. But black people still have
no vote and the core of apartheid is the denial
of political power. Also, the laws which form
what we call the "pillars of apartheid" are still
firmly in place. The difference between now and
1960 is that the white-controlled government says
it is prepared to negotiate the sharing of power
and to reconsider those laws. But we have yet to
see what it is going to offer. So from the point
of view of what the government is offering, we
are standing on the threshold of interesting pos¬
sibilities. But from the point of view of what our
people want, then, yes, there is truly a movement
towards democracy. We are determined to
achieve it, and we shall achieve it ultimately. No
one, least of all the South African government,
will stop us. '
Are there specific forms, specific conditions, for
a democratic evolution in the South African con¬
text? Will theprinciple of "one person, one vote"
be viable between communities that have been
hostile for so long?
Democracy depends on universal franchise.
Without the vote, there is no democracy and no
prospect of co-operation among communities.
Protection for every individual, irrespective of
community, is provided by a bill of rights, en¬
forced by independent courts of law. Only once
the human dignity of all South Africans is guaran¬
teed by equal rights can we expect to see true
co-operation between South Africans begin to
develop, from whatever community they come.

CULTURE AND FREEDOM IN THE THIRD WORLD

JLxS we witness the awakening of identities on
the world stage today it is as if we were in a
theatre watching a play. A tragic drama is
unfolding in which the only way for some to
achieve self-expression is to deny self-expression
to others; in which the long struggle through
which man has sought throughout history to
draw closer to his fellows is suddenly being
transformed into a battle waged by man on man;
in which the fears we had for freedom are giving
way to fear of freedom itself.
By a strange paradox, perhaps the remedy is

world has tended to harness human efforts to
the satisfaction of material needs. In the mirror
of this culture, man seems bereft of aspirations
to freedom, love, and poetry, and his needs seem
reduced to those of subsistence.
The media, and certain cultural activities,
seem dominated by the urge to achieve the
highest possible level of prosperity. Even educa¬
tion tends increasingly to elevate the satisfaction
of material needs to the status of a moral value,
a symbol of civilization. It sometimes even sug¬
gests ways of satisfying these needs and holds up
for approval an image of man as a creature who
actually savours his "enslavement", accepts him¬
self as a piece of merchandise, and allows him¬
self to be transformed into a mere cog in a
machine.
The Third World today is a vast laboratory
in which these trends are being tested, gaining
widespread acceptance and taking root to such
an extent that man as a free and creative being
scarcely seems to exist.
These trends are accompanied by a
pervasivealbeit sometimes concealedsense of
the supremacy of the West. It is true that the
West is engaged in a continuing struggle to
monopolize the central role and is determined
neither to abolish that role nor to harmonize its
relations with the non-Western world. This mere¬
ly increases the hostility of the latter, which is
transformed into a dependency, a captive mar¬
ket. In accordance with the logic of the balance
of power, this trend is becoming more marked
since it is linked to an arms race. Let us not dwell
on the contempt it implies for other cultures, for
those who possess nothing but their culture and
who, if they were to lose it, would lose every¬
thing, including themselves.
Culturethe product
of free creation
We can measure the value attached to freedom
in a given society by taking as a yardstick the
value attached to its culture and that culture's
openness to the future. Action and efficiency are
implied in the etymology of the word "culture",
]]>
</page>
<page number="41">
<![CDATA[
which has connotations of skill, talent and tech¬
nical accomplishment. (Is there not a close etymo¬
logical link between the Arabic word 'atqana and
the Greek word tekhnef) In the sense that it is
efficient, culture is the product of free creation.
As such, it is not just one factor among many
others in human development; it is its very foun¬
dation, its dynamic principle.
However, culture in this sense is today very
often absent from many Third World societies.
Perhaps this may help to clarify some of the rea¬
sons for the lack of freedom in these societies,
the most profound of which are perhaps related
to the jurisprudential interpretation of religious
texts. This dominant interpretation connects the
religious-jurisprudential to the socio-political, and
explains why freedom is not thought of as a "po¬
litical" or "civil" concept, but simply as a reli¬
gious concept.
In this context freedom has gradually be¬
come, paradoxically, an exercise in obedience, in
allegiance to the custodian of authority to whom
all power is delegated. And this is the origin of
the unity between truth and power, and also, in-
cestuously, of the unity between freedom and
power, and between thought and power.
The existence of the individual is thus root¬
ed in obedience. He thinks and speaks like the
group of which he is an organic part. Is not mar-
ginalization from the group or tribe a form of
unbelief, usually leading to exclusion and some¬
times to death? Intellectual marginalization thus
assumes the guise of political and jurisdictional
marginalization, since it is an expression of dis¬
obedience of the power established in the name
of the group. What can the individual do?
Stripped of property rights and the right to work,
man can continue to struggle. But when he is
stripped of his very language, that is, of his right to
speak, he is in a sense stripped of his right to live.
History has shown that all those who have
exercised their natural right to speak out against
the power-group have paid for it dearly, usually
with their lives. Many others have imagined that
the possession of objects could liberate them from
the power of thought! They abdicated to the
powers-that-be their right to speak, and restricted
themselves to material goods and trade. Perhaps
this explains the mutation of culture in these so¬
cieties. Essentially, culture is the achievement of
an awareness of the world, an act of creation. In
our societies it has become a form of embellish¬
ment, an instrument, and the intellectual has
become a functionary in the service of the
power-group.
Paralysis of thought
In certain types of society, earthly progress is
measured in terms of its conformity to injunc¬
tions from heaven, and the happiness of the in¬
dividual is measured in terms of his dependence
on the powers-that-be. This dependence is em¬
bodied in the concepts of harmony, conciliation 41

and unity. Harmony to deny social conflict, con¬
ciliation to deny intellectual conflict and unity
to deny division and fragmentation.
This being so, progress is no more than a
higher form of return to the original precepts.
Unity is simply that of the group-nation, which
is based on the uniqueness of the original texts,
which is in turn based on the uniqueness of the
truth, which is itself based on the uniqueness of
power. Such oneness means the simultaneous
stifling of man and of knowledge. The individual
is a stranger unto himself. For heaven, he exists
through religion; on earth, he exists by virtue of
the power-group.
Today, the dominant mode of thinking in
many Third World societies has theologico-
ideological roots. This world is assailed by two
types of knowledge. The first type is a vehicle
of the past. It is concerned with the hereafter and
with means of gaining eternity. The second type
is a vehicle for Western modernity. It is above
all concerned with the processing of material
things and with technologies of production and
consumption. On the one hand there is the litur¬
gy of the celestial paradise; on the other, the litur¬
gy of the earthly paradise. It is a world which
paralyses the mind because it produces neither
thought nor technology. The dominant cultural
trend confirms this paralysis: it represents total
conformity with the authority of a text which,
in practice, is that of the powers-that-be.
The prospects
for freedom
To explain the nature of freedom in the Third
World, I would add that the West (that "Other",
modern world) governs this world with ration¬
ality and technical skills oriented towards con¬
sumption, which assimilates it and makes it
dependent. The market, energy and strategy are
more apparent than man, his freedom and his
great cosmic problems. It is a functional vision
which masks man and reveals the machine.
Today, just as in the traditional theological
vision, Western-style production is geared more
closely to the renewal of means than to the
renewal of man. The means of enslaving man, not
of liberating him. What is produced becomes, in
practice, more important than man himself. It is
as if man exists as part of a machine. And some¬
one who is part of a machine loses possession of
his self (Al Farabi), since the self then belongs to
someone else. It matters little whether the
machine is textual-linguistic or material-
technological.
What then are the prospects for freedom in
the Third World? First of all I must stress that in
this world there is a current of democratic think¬
ing, writing and action. In social terms, this
current is marginal, but in cultural terms it is
most significant and holds the greatest promise
for a future worthy of man. It looks for inspira¬
tion to a world to which it does not belong.
What may seem a paradox is in reality the
very principle of the creative movement, which
produces and reproduces the pastbut in a differ¬
ent, renewed form, within the context of differ¬
ent knowledge. The relationships which this
movement establishes with the past (the heritage)
are no longer horizontal but vertical. They are
relationships which represent the continuing
growth of the past, through the present, towards
the future.
It is a movement rooted in language and not
in vocabulary, in man and not in an institution
or a regime, in life and not in ideology and in¬
struction. It is bound up with symbols, legends,
and the dynamics of imagination and creation.
Chronological time ceases to exist, and is replaced
by another kind of time, vertical time. There is no
more room for a single, definitive, total meaning.
Meaning is open, indefinite, shifting, and it is in
this changeability that freedom, democracy, mul¬
tiplicity and the right to be different are rooted.
This being so, what are the prospects for free¬
dom on a world scale?
I think that, essentially, these prospects hinge
on the West's future conception of the Third
World and on the nature of the West's relations
with the Third World. Misunderstanding about
freedom in the world will begin to be dispelled
when the West undertakes a complete and radi¬
cal reappraisal of itself, of its culture and of its
relationship with the "Other", non-Western
world. A new awareness of this other world must
emerge in the West and become another facet,
an extension of itself.
In the light of this new awareness, man's iden¬
tity would no longer be predetermined, it would
become the fruit of a creative process which is
renewed with each new project. The past (reli¬
gious or national), would then be simply the most
primitive, the least rich, the least profound com¬
ponent of that identity, which can only be the
result of a continuing process of creation. Alone
among all living creatures man makes his own
identity through his creative work and thought.
Human identity is not a fixed quantity: it does
not derive from any kind of past; it is a perma¬
nent quest for the future within a continuing
creative destiny.
To achieve this level of awareness of the du¬
ality of identity and otherness, politics must
become an integral part of a whole, that of cul¬
ture. The former must be subject to the latter;
political action must be primarily a means of
reinforcing the exchange between oneself and
others, it must satisfy a cultural desire for dia¬
logue, exchanges, complementarities.
Politics must then, above all in the West,
achieve wonders. It must do so in order, at long
last, to give the lie to Saint-Just's remark that "All
the arts have achieved wonders; only the art of
governing has produced nothing but monsters."

A BEHIND-THE-SCENES STRUGGLE
FOR HUMAN RIGHTS
BY GEORGES-HENRI DUMONT
Unesco often intervenes when human rights
are violated. For the first time,
we publish an account of this little-known
aspect of Unesco's work.
M
«* **
LANY people know that Unesco's action
in favour of human rights serves the fun¬
damental purpose, set forth in its Constitu¬
tion, of furthering "universal respect for
justice, for the rule of law and for the human
rights and fundamental freedoms which are
affirmed for the peoples of the world, without
distinction of race, sex, language or religion,
by the Charter of the United Nations".
It is also widely known that since its foun¬
dation Unesco has been concerned with the
teaching of human rights. Through numerous
publications and in consultation with many
specialists, it has done much valuable work in
this field over the years.
Equally well-known is Unesco's standard-
setting action relating to human rights, en¬
shrined in nine conventions, twenty-one
recommendations and two declarations
concerning rights to education, culture and
information.
However, few people know that Unesco
takes action on specific human rights problems
through an organ of its Executive Board, the
Committee on Conventions and Recommen¬
dations. If the existence of the Committee is
virtually unknown to the general public, this
is perhaps because much of its work is done
in private session.
The Committee was originally set up to
examine "communications from individuals
or associations invoking the violation of cer¬
tain human rights, particularly educational and
cultural rights, by states which are or are not
members of Unesco".
In its early years, from 1965 to 1977, the
Committee dealt only with questions relating
to discrimination in education, but in 1978 its
responsibilities were broadened, along with
those of Unesco's Executive Board. Since then,
all Unesco's fields of competence have been
covered by the Committee, and general ques¬
tions relating to human rights violations have
been examined as well as individual cases.
The Committee had to find a way of
reconciling two contradictory demandshow
to operate with maximum effectiveness while
at the same time Unesco is prohibited as an
institution from intervening in matters which
are essentially within the domestic jurisdiction
of its member states.
]]>

<page number="44">
<![CDATA[
The Executive Board resolved this dilem¬
ma by deciding that Unesco should "act in a
spirit of international co-operation, concilia¬
tion and mutual understanding"; and that it
should not "play the role of an international
judicial body". Thus any idea of sanctions was
implicitly rejected.
How the Committee works
The Committee on Conventions and Recom¬
mendations meets in private session twice a
year. One disadvantage of working in this way
is that the Committee's decisions may be
deprived of support they might otherwise
receive from public opinion. Another is that
the public may get the impression that Unesco
simply makes solemn and noble declarations
whereas in reality it is engaged in practical,
continuous and effective action.
Yet some of the benefits of working in
private session outweigh the disadvantages.
Discussion focuses on the humanitarian rather
than the political aspects of the problem. Since
governments are not publicly accused, they do
not feel that they are losing face when they
yield to a decision by the Committee.
To understand how the Committee
works, let us take the example of a person
perhaps a writer, a teacher, an artist or a
journalistwho is in prison. A dossier com¬
piled by Unesco's Office of International Stan¬
dards and Legal Affairs is given to each
member of the Committee. It contains infor¬
mation on behalf of the alleged victim and,
if possible, the initial reactions of the govern¬
ment concerned, together with a summary
provided by the representative of the Director-
General of Unesco. A representative of the
government concerned is invited to attend the
meeting of the Committee in order to provide
additional information or to justify his govern¬
ment's acts. He or she may be asked a variety
of questions after making a statement. Some
of the most common questions include:
If the alleged victim has been imprisoned
without having been convicted, why is this so?
When will the trial take place?
If the prisoner has been tried, on what
grounds has he or she been convicted?
Has the prisoner's family been authorized
to visit him or her? If so, how often?
What is the prisoner's state of health? Is he
or she receiving the necessary treatment?
In the case of an elderly person, is there a
chance of a speedy release?
It is rare that all these questions are an¬
swered immediately, but the representative of
the government concerned may undertake to
deal with them as quickly as possible, thus
setting in motion a process beneficial to the
prisoner. Even if the case is not settled, sub¬
sequent to this session of the Committee many
prisoners receive a medical or family visit for
the first time.
Many cases are settled during this initial
period of dialogue with government represen¬
tatives. If a communication is declared to be
admissible, and dialogue with the government
concerned breaks down or the government in
question remains silent, then the Committee's
task becomes much more difficult. The
government will tend to dig in its heels. In
such cases it may be necessary to await a po¬
litical change before dialogue can be resumed.

Some 200 cases have been submitted to the
Committee since 1978. The results of its ef¬
forts may be considered to be encouraging,
especially in recent years: 30 cases were set-
tied between 1978 and 1981; 85 between 1982
and 1985; 86 between 1986 and 1989.
Unesco has played a decisive role in the
case of three well-known figures: the Argen¬
tine pianist Miguel Angel Estrella, who was
freed from prison in 1980; Professor Andrey
Sakharov, Nobel Peace Prize winner (1975);
and Vaclav Havel, now President of the
Republic of Czechoslovakia.
In ten years, around a hundred persons,
often imprisoned in very unpleasant condi¬
tions, have been freed or acquitted.
Many communications submitted to the
Committee concern intellectuals forbidden to
return to their countries, students refused per¬
mission to go abroad or denied the award of
a degree or study grant, persons arbitrarily
deprived of their employment, or publications
banned by the authorities. The list of viola¬
tions of human rights is too long to list here.
In all cases, the Committee has learned to act
with obstinacy and perseverance.
This action in favour of human rights is
carried out in the name of the Executive Board
and the Director-General of Unesco. In order
to help reach a solution in certain cases, the
Director-General may intervene personally,
either confidentially or publically, if for ex¬
ample he learns that an international civil ser¬
vant working for Unesco has been detained
or arrested in the country of which he or she
is a national. This is what happened to Sorin
Dumitrescu, as he describes in the following
article.
GEORGES-HENRI DUMONT,
Belgian historian and member of the Royal
Academy of Belgium, is the author of numerous
historical works including Marie de Bourgogne
(Fayard, Paris, 1982) and La vie quotidienne en
Belgique au temps de Leopold II (Marabout
Université, Brussels, 1986). He is chairman of
Unesco's International Commission which is
responsible for the preparation of a new edition
of the History of the Scientific and Cultural
Development of Mankind. A member of Unesco's
Executive Board from 1981 to 1989, he was
chairman of its Committee on Conventions and
Recommendations from 1987 to 1989.

IN THE HANDS
OF THE SECURITATE
BY SORIN DUMITRESCU
XJLt the end of 1969, 1 was appointed to the

in the Science Sector of Unesco.
Shortly after taking up my appointment,
like everyone else who becomes an interna¬

functions and generally to conduct myself
"with the interests of the Organization only
in view, and not to seek or accept instruc¬
tions.. .from any government..."
Aware as I was of the full meaning of these
words, I never suspected that, a few years later,
they were destined to play such an important
part in my life.
An uncompleted mission
On 6 June 1976, I left Paris to represent
the Director-General of Unesco at two meet¬
ings first in Romania (8-13 June), the
second in Bulgaria (15-18 June). I made the trip
in my own car, accompanied by my wife and
my daughter.
At the end of my stay in Romania, just
as I was preparing to cross the frontier into
Bulgaria, I was stopped by the Romanian
police. I was told that I had to return immedi¬
ately to Bucharest to see the deputy minister
for foreign affairs, Mr. Vasile Gliga. I tele¬
phoned Mr. Gliga and explained to him that
I had urgent business to attend to in Varna,

Bulgaria, but to no avail. I had to return to
Bucharest for an appointment with Mr. Gliga
who told me that I could not leave the country
until "certain important matters" had been
settled.
I told him that in the circumstances I
would have to inform the Director-General
of Unesco that I had been prevented from ful¬
filling my mission in accordance with my
instructions. The deputy minister advised me
to do nothing, so as to avoid an incident.
According to him the problem would shortly
be solved. Anxious not to worsen the situa¬
tion, I agreed to wait until the morning of
18 June.
On that day I was again summoned to the
office of the deputy minister, who told me that
the Romanian government had decided to
"withdraw my status as an international civil
servant". I was to return to the ministry on
the following day to draw up a letter to the 45

Director-General announcing my resignation
from my post at Unesco. I was forbidden, on
pain of instant arrest, to contact Unesco in any
way whatever. When I asked the reasons for
this decision, the deputy minister said that he
was not authorized to divulge them to me. I
told him that I considered this to be an abuse
of power since the government of Romania
had no right to revoke my status as an inter¬
national civil servant. But I did not leave his
office until I had agreed to draw up, by the
following day, a letter of resignation.
Once outside the confines of the deputy
minister's office, I thought for a moment
of contacting Mr. Thomas Keller, head of
Unesco's European Centre for Higher Edu¬
cation (CEPES), whose headquarters is in
Bucharest. Mr. Keller, however, was on holi¬
day and it would be risky to try to telephone
Paris or to contact an embassy, since I was
clearly being followed. In the end, taking enor¬
mous risks and adopting methods worthy of
a detective novel, my daughter succeeded in
transmitting to the French embassy a message
which I requested the French authorities to
pass on to the Director-General of Unesco.
The same day, 18 June,' an official from
the "Post Office" came to our house to change
our telephone which, he told us, was certainly
not working properly.
The fourth paragraph
During the night I attempted to draw up a
letter of resignation that would be as "clear"
as possible:
"Dear Director-General,
"I have the honour to inform you that the
government of Romania has decided that I
should resume my duties at the National
Hydrological Service.
"I therefore ask you to accept my resig¬
nation from Unesco to take effect im¬
mediately.
"Since, under present circumstances, I am
unable to return to Paris, I would be grateful
if you would ask the Bureau of Personnel to
let me know the steps I should take to meet
my obligations to Unesco and the terms under
which I can benefit from rights relating to ter¬
mination of service.
"At this time when I am leaving Unesco,
I would like to thank you for the confidence
you have shown in me and to assure you that
I remain faithful to the ideals of the Organi¬
zation."
On reading the letter, my wife and daugh¬
ter both had the same reaction: "Do you really
think they will be so stupid as to let you send
such a letter?". I wrote my answer on a piece
of paper which we burnt after they had read
it: "I am trying to negotiate."
On 19 June, I presented myself at the
ministry of foreign affairs with this draft letter.
The person responsible for Unesco affairs read
it and asked me: "Couldn't you give some
other reason for your resignation? Why not
say that you are unwell, for example?" I re¬
plied that under the circumstances no one
would believe this and that it was better to tell
the truth. The deputy minister, to whom my
interlocutor referred the problem, accepted
the explanation given, but wanted to strike out
the fourth paragraphthe one in which I
expressed my fidelity to the ideals of Unesco.
For me the two essential paragraphs were
the first and the third. The fourth paragraph
did indeed reflect my feelings, but it was much
less important for the "transparency" I wished
to convey in my letter. I could have given it
up, but I made a show of wanting to keep it
in, stressing the fact that it helped to soften
the excessively brusque tone of the letter over¬
all. After further discussion with the deputy
minister my interlocutor returned with, to my
great surprise, his consent to the contents of
the letter. I left the ministry feeling greatly
relievedthe Director-General would have no
difficulty in understanding my message. I felt
that I had scored a point.
'You are and you remain
a member
of the Unesco Secretariat'
Two weeks passed and nothing happened. I
began to have doubtshad the Romanian
authorities sent my original letter? Had they
perhaps concocted another letter and forged
my signature? At the ministry they had told
me that I would receive a reply from Unesco
within a week at the latest. The utter uncer¬
tainty about the possible outcome of the send¬
ing of my letter of resignation was one of the
hardest things to bear.
Around 5 July, unable to restrain myself
any longer, I decided to risk everything and
telephoned Unesco headquarters in Paris. The
Director-General was not in Paris and so I
asked to speak to the Deputy Director-
General, Mr. John Fobes. When I heard his
voice, I asked him if he was aware of my
problem. He said that he was. I then explained
that owing to the conditions under which I
was telephoning I could only speak to him
briefly and that I had one single question to
put to him: "Was I still a member of the
Secretariat?". In calm, serious tones which I
shall never forget, he replied: "You are and
you remain a member of the Secretariat." The
Director-General considered my letter of resig¬
nation as inadmissible and he had written a
letter to this effect to the Romanian Perma¬
nent Delegate to Unesco.
I hung up and then gave a brief account
of the situation to my family. There was a
feeling of euphoriawe were saved. Our
problems would now be rapidly resolved and
we should soon return to Paris. We did not,
alas, know enough about the nature of the
Romanian regime.
I learned later that the original version of
my letter of "resignation" had been delivered
to the Director-General's office on 21 June.
In a covering letter which accompanied my
letter, the Romanian Ambassador indicated
that he was forwarding it "on the instructions
of his government". Mr. Amadou Mahtar

artist Horia Bernea. (Art Against Apartheid
Collection, see page 38.)
ately summoned the Ambassador and in¬
formed him that the form in which my resig¬
nation had been presented did not comply
with the correct legal procedures. To avoid
causing the Romanian authorities any embar¬
rassment, he preferred not to reply to the
letter for a period of ten days. Once this delay
had elapsed, if I had still not returned to Paris,
he would be obliged to react officially.
Since nothing happened during the follow¬
ing ten days, on 1 July the Director-General
sent an official letter to the Ambassador declar¬
ing my letter of resignation to be inadmissible
and adding: "the conditions under which Mr.
Dumitrescu's request was formulated and
presented place in serious jeopardy the very
basis of the international civil service."
On 14 July, I met Mr. Thomas Keller,
head of Unesco's Bucharest Centre. He had
been instructed by Mr. M'Bow to contact me
and find out from me personally exactly what
my position was. Being uncertain whether I
would be able to reach the Centre, I asked Mr.

Keller to meet me at the corner of the street.
He reached the meeting place before I did. We
walked together in a nearby park followed by
several members of the infamous Securitate.
Although I had never met him beforethe
person who awaited me could have been an
impostorI spoke to him frankly and asked
him to tell the Director-General that I con¬
sidered my resignation to be null and void.
At that time, I still believed that the whole
affair was due to a handful of over-zealous civil
servants and that once it came to the
knowledge of the highest ranks of the Party
and the state we should be allowed to leave.
I wrote a number of explanatory notes for
their attention, explaining that I had nothing
to reproach myself for and requesting an ex¬
planation of why I had been retained against
my will. I never received a single reply. Then,
one day, through an official's indiscretion, I
learned that the Romanian head of state,
Nicolae Ceausescu, was fully aware of my case
and that he had personally given the order not
to give way to pressure from Unesco. There
was no room for further compromise. I real¬
ized that I had to put everything at stake.
On 6 August, Mr. M'Bow wrote a letter
to Ceausescu which began with these words:
"Convinced that I have exhausted all
other possible paths of action I am taking the
liberty of informing you personally about a
matter to which I attach the utmost impor¬
tance. It concerns Mr. Sorin Dumitrescu,
Director of the Office of Hydrology at the
Unesco Secretariat and a Romanian national
who, having been detained on Romanian ter¬
ritory through which he was merely passing
before carrying out a mission I had entrusted
to him, has been unable to return to his post
in Paris. To my knowledge this is the first time
in the history of the United Nations system
that a high-ranking international civil servant
has found himself in such a situation."
The state of Unesco
This letter went unanswered. The Director-
General then decided to bring the matter to
the attention of Unesco's Executive Board.
The matter was discussed for the first time
during a private session of the Board on 9 Oct¬
ober. After presenting the facts of the case,
Mr. M'Bow stressed that if he accepted the sit¬
uation created by the Romanian authorities
he would be failing to observe the oath he had
sworn when he had assumed his functions as
Director-General in 1974 and that, if he did
not receive the support of member states in
this matter he would feel obliged to submit
his resignation to the Executive Board. He
received very widespread and very strong sup¬
port from the Board.
Impressed by this turn of events, the
Romanian government, through its represen¬
tative on the Executive Board, declared that
it was ready to discuss the matter further.
Some ten days later, Mr. Luis Marques, Direc¬
tor of Personnel at Unesco, went to Bucharest
as representative of the Director-General.
Meanwhile, in Bucharest, I was quite un¬
aware of what had taken place at the meeting
of the Executive Board. The people with
whom I was dealing the gentlemen of the
Securitatetried to demoralize me: what they
said to me in substance was that "in no coun¬
try can an ordinary citizen oppose the head
of state; the Director-General cannot refuse
to accept your resignation..."
A few days before the Director-General's
representative arrived in Bucharest, I was sum¬
moned to appear before the Central Commit¬
tee of the Party. The deputy head of the
foreign affairs section told me that they held
nothing against me and that I had been re¬
tained in Romania simply because I had been
too long abroad. I should immediately agree
to return to employment in the national ad¬
ministration. "You must understand that
Romania, which has resisted the pressures of
its great neighbour to the east, is not going to
yield to the pressure of the state of Unesco."
To which I replied: "That is where you are
wrong. Unesco is not a state, but a commu¬
nity of 150 member states with which it is not
in the interest of Romania to quarrel."
I was able to meet Luis Marques when he
arrived on 20 October. The Romanian auth¬
orities requested me to inform him clearly that
I no longer intended to return to Paris.
However, when he told me what had taken
place at the meeting of the Unesco Executive
Board, I confirmed to him that I was, on the
contrary, ready to return to my post at
Unesco as soon as possible and that I refused
any compromise on this matter. The next day,
at the Central Committee, I informed my
usual interlocutor that he could no longer
count on my co-operation. He replied that my
behaviour put me in a very serious position
and that my case was no longer in his hands.
A week later, I was taken to court by the
minister of finance. I owed the Romanian state
a sum of about 70,000 francsevery Romani¬
an citizen working abroad must, by law, turn
over to the state the greater part of his earn¬
ings. In my case, it was a question of arrears,
since I had already paid over more than
120,000 francs. The case was judged in Decem¬
ber and was a pure formality. I declared that
I was ready to pay what I owed as soon as I
was in a position to do so. The money was
deposited at the Unesco Centre in Bucharest
in January 1977, thus settling the only formal
legal difference I had had with the Romanian
authorities.
At the beginning of February 1977, Mr.
M'Bow paid an official visit to Romania. Ini¬
tially arranged for September 1976, the visit
had been postponed several times at the re¬
quest of the Romanian government. Mr.
M'Bow hoped to obtain the government's
agreement to my leaving the country, but no
such agreement was forthcoming. During an
interview he had with Ceausescu, the latter
stated that Unesco's request was inadmissible
since a matter of national sovereignty was in¬
volved. The Director-General explained that,
on the contrary, it was a question of interna¬
tional law and that the Romanian government
was acting in violation of international agree¬
ments to which it was a signatory. The inter¬
view came to an abrupt end.
As arranged, I was waiting at the head¬
quarters of the Unesco Centre for Mr. M'Bow
to return, when I received a telephone call,
supposedly on his behalf, telling me to go
straight to his hotel and meet him there. I un¬
derstood at once that this was a stratagem to
prevent me from meeting him and I continued
to wait at the Centre until he arrived. He as¬
sured me that he would redouble his efforts
to obtain my liberation and that he would
soon make the whole affair public.
The repression begins
On 4 March, a violent earthquake struck
southern Romania. On 30 March, an officer
appeared at my house with a summons for me
to report for five months military service, be¬
ginning the following day, in a military unit
whose task was to rebuild a town about a
hundred kilometres from Bucharest that had
been almost entirely destroyed in the earth¬
quake. This decision, I later learned, was 47

enshrined in a decree, signed by Ceausescu
himself, on which mine was the only name
to appear.
Unesco protested against this new viola¬
tion of my status as an international civil ser¬
vant and requested the Romanian authorities
to suspend this measure, but once again
received not a whisper of a reply.
At that time I was not at all well. At the
military hospital in Bucharest to which I was
taken, a risk of hepatitis was diagnosed. Af¬
ter having decided to have me hospitalized, the
commander of my unit told me, with regret,
that he had been ordered to release me right
away. Flanked by two soldiers, I was taken
by car to my home to collect my belongings.
My family watched as I was driven away, not
knowing how or when they would see me
again.
I was ill for several days, without medical
attention, without food and scarcely able to
sleep. One of my relations succeeded in find¬
ing me and told my wife and daughter where
he had seen me. Our telephone had been cut
off. Two members of the Securitate had been
to the house and had ordered my wife and
daughter to refrain from all contact with
Unesco representatives. Otherwise I ran the
risk of being taken before a military tribunal
and they themselves could be arrested.
The purpose of the military service was
to cut me off from all my contacts and it did,
indeed, increase my isolation. Nevertheless, at
Unesco the affair was following its course and
in April the Executive Board reaffirmed its
wholehearted support for the action taken by
the Director-General.
Bargaining
Despite their blustering, the Romanian auth¬
orities were on the spot. They had to find a way
out. In May, I was summoned to Bucharest
to meet the deputy minister of the interior and
head of the Securitate, N. Plechitza. For the
first time I received an explanation for my
retention in the country since June 1976. 1 was
suspected of not wanting to return to Romania
at the end of my contract with Unesco.
Plechitza recognized that a mistake had doubt¬
less been made but said that it was too late to
reverse matters. It was now important to find
some way of saving the face of the head of state,
who had refused to authorize my return to
Paris. I replied that, in my opinion, the pres¬
tige of a head of state could only be increased if,
having discovered that an injustice had been
committed, he took steps to put that injustice
right.
I saw the deputy minister and his col¬
leagues several times. They made acceptance
ofs.my resignation by Unesco a prior condi¬
tion to any settlement of my problem. Once it
had been accepted they would offer me a post
as a deputy minister and, if I so wished, I could
go and work abroad. To which I invariably
answered that the plan was flawed, that
Unesco would never accept my resignation
until I returned to Paris and that my sole am-
4o bition was to continue with my work there.
In August the Romanian authorities came
up with another plan. As my contract with
Unesco was due to end on 31 October, all I
had to do was to ask the Director-General not
to renew my contract. In this way the
problem of resignation would be avoided. My
interlocutors asked me to send a letter to the
Director-General containing this proposal and
suggesting that he should send a representa¬
tive to Bucharest so that I could confirm my
decision in person. I decided to accept in the
hope that my daughter at least would regain
her liberty and be able to continue her studies
in Paris. I told myself that in this way I would
have a chance of speaking to the Director-
General's representative and of revealing my
real intentions to him.
The meaning of a gesture
Towards the end of August, I was told that,
following my request, Mr. M'Bow had decided
to send an Assistant Director-General, Mr.
Jacques Rigaud, accompanied by the deputy
director of the Bureau of Personnel, to
Bucharest and that they would arrive on 6 Sep¬
tember. I took advantage of this to bring my
military service to an endit had, apparently,
been decided that this should be extended
beyond the original five-month periodby
maintaining that, if I remained a member of
the armed forces, I would refuse to talk to the
Unesco representatives. This the authorities
accepted.
However, they had still not authorized
my daughter to return to Paris. On the very
day that Mr. Rigaud arrived, a Securitate agent
told me that he had tried to obtain the autho¬
rization from Ceausescu at the airport as he
was preparing to leave on an official visit to
Bulgaria, but that he had replied with a gesture
of the hand the meaning of which was not
sufficiently clear. In the circumstances, it
would be necessary to await the President's
return in order to discover what exactly the
gesture had meant. I was assured this would
only be a matter of days. It was made very
clear that it was essential for me to respect the
arrangements made and to ensure that the
Assistant Director-General left fully convinced
that I did not want my contract renewed. If
this was not the case I should be subject to
severe repression and all hope of a com¬
promise would be lost. I was also incidental¬
ly reminded that I should beware of road
accidents since the traffic in Bucharest had
become very dangerous.
I met Mr. Rigaud in the afternoon of 6
September. I explained to him why I had writ¬
ten my letter to the Director-General and, of
course, confirmed my desire to continue to
serve Unesco. I told him, "I feel in no way
bound by this kind of 'gentlemen's agree¬
ment', those with whom it was made are no
gentlemen." Mr. Rigaud assured me that he
understood my position perfectly. I then made
a tape-recording in which I stated, among
other things: "I declare that I have not in any
way acted in a manner contrary to Romanian
law or the interests of the state of Romania.

Romanian artist Christian Paraschiv.
All I have done is to remain faithful to the
oath I took when I joined Unesco. I see no
incompatibility between this oath and a
citizen's duty to his country. There is no ques¬
tion of my changing my position. The
Director-General should not hesitate to act in
accordance with what he believes to be right,
even if that might put my safety at risk. The
life we have been subjected to since June 1976
is no life at all. My wife and I are ready to
face death, but to face it standing up."
Following Mr. Rigaud's report, my con¬
tract with Unesco was renewed for two years.
The Executive Board examined my case again
at its 103rd session in September/October
1977. On 6 October, for the first time, the Ex¬
ecutive Board held a public session on the
problem. The chairman traced the unfolding
of the affair. Referring to the United Nations
Charter and Unesco's Constitution, he
recalled that international civil servants had to
carry out their functions in a totally indepen¬
dent manner subject only to the authority of
the Director-General of the Organization.
"The Executive Board," he concluded, "is
]]>

very concerned by what appears to be the
breaking, by a member state, of international
agreements freely entered into. It unreservedly
supports the position adopted by the Director-
General and accepts as its own the decisions
he has taken."
Taking the floor in the name of his
government, the Romanian representative,
Marcel Ghibernea, rejected the declaration by
the chairman of the Board and bitterly at¬
tacked the position taken by the Director-
General. He also made a number of calumni¬
ous statements about me, going so far as to
say that I had "spent large sums to acquire as¬
sets whose value largely exceeded my legal
income".
The Director-General replied in these
terms: "All the measures I have taken in this
affair have been brought fully to the attention
of the Executive Board and fully approved by
it. I can therefore affirm to Mr. Ghibernea that
I here enjoy the trust of all the members of
the Boardwith the exception, perhaps, of
Mr. Ghibernea himselfbecause I refuse to
betray the oath I swore on the day I was
elected Director-General of the Organi¬
zation."
Meanwhile, in many countries, the media
had begun to talk about my case. My name
was becoming known.
A foreign organization
The Romanian authorities then decided to pull
out all the stops. On 13 October, criminal
proceedings were opened against me and I was
accused of "treason by the transmission of
secret information". According to article 157
of the Romanian penal code, this crime is
punishable by a five- to fifteen-year term of
imprisonment and the confiscation of assets.
I was accused of having "passed on to agents
of a 'foreign organization' (Unesco) informa¬
tion the use of which by that organization
threatened the security of the state".
The inquisitors gave me two hours to
reply, in writing, to this accusation. I was pre¬
pared for this eventuality, which I had been
expecting since I had been threatened with it
before. In less than twenty minutes I developed
the following defence:
"I consider this accusation to be without
any foundation whatsoever. None of my ac¬
tions can be held to constitute an infringement
of article 157 of the penal code. According to
the report of the commission of inquiry, the
accusation is based on contacts I had, between
June 1976 and October 1977, with represen¬
tatives of Unesco, of which Organization I am
a staff member. With regard to these contacts
I give the following details:
(1) I have never transmitted to anyone in¬
formation likely to endanger the security of
the state.
(2) I consider the idea that an organization
like Unesco could use information passed on
by an individual to threaten the security of
one of its member states, in this case Roma¬
nia, to be absurd.
(3) My contacts with the representatives
of Unesco during the period designated were
exclusively concerned with the obligations to
the Organization implied by my functions as
a member of the Secretariat and by the oath
I took when I became a servant of the Organi¬
zation. These contacts were made in my ca¬
pacity as a Unesco staff member and therefore
do not fall within the terms of article 157 of
the penal code. They are, however, in confor¬
mity with the provisions of the Convention
on the privileges and immunities of special¬
ized agencies, article VI, section M, paragraph
(a). This Convention has been ratified by
Romania.
(4) In view of the foregoing, I shall hence¬
forth refuse to answer any further questions
relating to the above-mentioned accusation."
I thought that I was going to be arrested.
However, I was told that I was to remain at
liberty, but that I must report to the head¬
quarters of the penal inquiries section of the
Securitate every day from eight in the morn¬
ing until ten at night. This was how I came
to experience things I had previously only seen
in filmslong corridors with many doors,
each topped by a red light which lit up
whenever there was someone inside, interro¬
gation rooms with barred windows, listening
equipment...
The inquisitors began by asking me such
questions as: "Do you admit that you passed
letters to the Director-General of Unesco via
agents of Unesco?", and "When did you first
meet the Director of CEPES?" Sticking to the
line I had adopted in court, I invariably re¬
plied: "I refuse to answer that question."
The inquisitors were very disappointed
and said that I was only smoothing the path
for my imminent condemnation. To which
I replied: "So much the better; I shall return
to Paris all the sooner."
After a time the officials in charge of the
investigation began to lose heart. The sessions
ended earlier and we even got round to talk¬
ing about subjects other than my case.
The stick and the carrot
On 25 October, seven Securitate agents en¬
tered our house in the early morning to make
a search and to place our possessions under
notice of sequestration. I believe, however,
that the real purpose of the operation was
to convince us that my condemnation was
imminent.
This was not so. On the contrary, on 12
November I was sent for by deputy minister
Plechitza. He was all sweetness and light and
told me that the judicial pursuits against me
were being abandoned for lack of valid
grounds. Furthermore, "to demonstrate the 49

generosity of the authorities", he announced
that he had decided to allow my daughter to
return to Paris to continue her interrupted
university studies. We all found it difficult to
believe that this was not some new form of
trickery, but three days later my daughter
received her passport. Until her arrival in
Paris, however, we remained anxious. After
all, she could have been taken somewhere else.
But a few hours after she had left we received
a telephone call from her which included the
agreed password to indicate that she had ar¬
rived safely.
The following morning the deputy
minister called me to say in substance: "We
have been generous to you; now it is your turn
to show your gratitude by helping us to put
an end to the dispute with Unesco. In a few
months you will be able to leave the country
and rejoin your daughter if you so wish." I
replied that the right granted to my daughter
to resume her studies seemed no more than
normal to me, so why should I change the po¬
sition I had held since the beginning of the
affair? The conversation went on for hours
and was resumed on subsequent days. The
deputy minister assured me of his esteem and
appealed to my "patriotic feelings". At times
I found these "conversations" even more pain¬
ful than those in which my Securitate inqui¬
sitors had made all kinds of threats.
After about a fortnight, the tone changed
once again. If I continued to refuse to co¬
operate with them, said Plechitza, my daughter
would be killed on the streets of Paris or
brought back by force to Romania. "We have
already done this in other cases," he told me.
I took this new threat seriously and informed
the Director-General of it and he immediately
asked the French authorities for protection for
my daughter.
After a brief lull, the repressive measures
began again early in February 1978. I had
several interviews with a secretary of the Cen¬
tral Committee of the Party and former
minister of the Securitate, Ion Stanescu. He
in his turn threatened to have me thrown in
prison and, when I invoked the law, he re¬
plied: "There is no law for people like you."
I was told that my trial was entering its
final stage.
The end of the affair
On 28 February, the press published extracts
from a statement I had sent to Paris and which
my daughter had made public:
"The tragedy that I have lived through
since June 1976 is chiefly that I find myself
a prisoner in my own country.... My loyalty
to my country is no reason for me to accept
the injustice that has been done to me, for me
to be the victim of calumny, of abuse of power
and of disregard for the law.... On several oc¬
casions, those representing the authorities have
put forward to me as their major argument
that: 'You are a Romanian citizen and the state
can do with you what it will.' Since I dislike
the feudal undertones of this argument and
since any dialogue with the authorities is

impossible, I have asked to give up Romanian
nationality."
On 8 March 1978 one of the most impor¬
tant purges of the Ceausescu regime took
place. All the officials with whom I had had
dealings were victims of it and I immediately
made it known that I would refuse to respond
to any judicial summons until I had an oppor¬
tunity to talk to their replacements.
Meanwhile, international pressures were
growing stronger and stronger. Governmental
and parliamentary delegations visiting Romania
all raised my case, which was also raised on
the occasion of Ceausescu's visits abroad.
The United Nations Organization, which
until then had remained out of the affair,
adopted a position in my favour at a meeting
of the Administrative Committee on Co¬
ordination held in April 1978 and chaired by
the Secretary-General of the United Nations.
The Secretary-General gave his support to Mr.
M'Bow and took a number of steps: my case
would be raised in the United Nations and at
the next Unesco General Conference. At a
meeting in May, Unesco's Executive Board
was informed of a proposal to have the dispute
brought before the International Court of
Justice at The Hague. Unesco's Staff Associa¬
tion and the Federation of International Civil
Servants Associations (FICSA) condemned
this attack on the independence of the inter¬
national civil service and adopted a number
of plans of action.
Finally, Ceausescu yielded. On 6 May, I
was summoned by the authorities who told
me th,at I was authorized to return to Paris.
On 12 May 1978, my wife and I left
Bucharest on a tourist visa, and arrived in Paris
two days later after an absence of twenty-three
months. On 16 May I resumed my normal
duties at Unesco.
I had won, but I shall remain marked for
life by this ordeal.
