1982, tapestry of wool,
synthetic fibres and pearl
buttons, 85 x 178 cm
by Marie and Pierre Dionne
The head of a man wearing
a tricorn hat is depicted in the
Cubist manner in this tapestry
executed on a traditional
Quebec loom by two Quebec
artists. The use of pearl
buttons was inspired by the
lavishly decorated costumes
traditionally worn by the
"pearly kings" and "pearly
queens" of the East End of
London.

Today there are no more
unexplored continents,
unknown seas or mysterious
islands. But while we can
overcome the physical
barriers to exploration, the
barriers of mutual ignorance
between different peoples
and cultures have in many
cases still not been
dismantled.
A modern Ulysses can
voyage to the ends of the
earth. But a different kind
of Odyssey now beckonsan
exploration of the world's
many cultural landscapes, the
ways of life of Its different
peoples and their outlook on
the world in which they live.
It is such an Odyssey that
the Unesco Courier proposes
to you, its readers. Each
month contributors of
different nationalities provide
from different cultural and
professional standpoints an
authoritative treatment of a
theme of universal interest.
The compass guiding this
j'ourney through the world's
cultural landscapes is respect
for the dignity of man
everywhere.

The noted French film-maker
Frédéric Rossif is best known for
his films about animals such as
La fête sauvage (1973),
but he has also been attracted to
historical themes
(To Die in Madrid, 1962, and the
recent De Nuremberg à Nuremberg)
and to the arts (Picasso, 1982)
and has directed a number of
features including
Aussi loin que l'amour (1971).
Whether they are about people or
the world of animals or plants,
Rossif's films all celebrate the
splendours of life and are notable
for their striking imagery.
brain which, when they merge, have a strange effect....
During those few seconds I saw my whole life unfold
before me with extraordinary slowness and precision.
My perception of time was different.
Death, not to mention multi-coloured butterflies, was
the subject of one ofyour best-known films, To Die
in Madrid.
To Die in Madrid was a long time ago. The film
was strongly criticized when it came out. By the
extreme right, of course, but also by the extreme left.
By all those who see life in black and white terms and
are blind to the fact that in the worst of scoundrels
there may be a glimmer of poetry if only you know
how to grasp it at the right moment. Fortunately, the
truth of life is multi-coloured. The subtlety and
contrasts of historical situations are such that history
never resembles an ideology.
Things aren't only black and white, it's true, but in
some of your films there is certainly a great deal of
black.
We must try to find an explanation for the
blackest of situations. When depicting the rise of
nazism, for example, you have to show the terrifying
rate of inflationa loaf of bread that cost thousands
of millions of marks. The humiliation too.
Dostoyevsky said, "Those who suffer terribly do
terrible things." If you take no notice of accumulated
humiliation, it is impossible to understand the emer¬
gence of nazism or, in our time, the problem of
terrorism. Humiliation is one reason why people
stop caring about their lives. Not only do they agree
to risk their lives, they no longer care. Humiliation
is the impalpable structure that for centuries has
prevented the peoples of East and West from meeting.

This historic photo of Sitting Bull and Buffalo Bill was used in Frédéric Rossif's documentary Pourquoi ¡Amérique? (1970).
A greatfilm could be made about the history ofthat
humiliation. But how would it be received, on either
side of the impalpable frontier?
One never knows what time it is on the invisible
clock of history, one never knows what time it is in
the matter of public taste. On his deathbed at the age
of a hundred, the French scientist and man of letters
Bertrand le Bovier de Fontenelle put it differently. To
someone who asked him if he felt any pain, he replied:
"None, except the pain of being alive. I feel a great
difficulty in existing." It was Fontenelle who observed
that in a theatre 999 persons of average intelligence
are cumulatively more intelligent than a single genius
because they all "pull together" in order to under¬
stand. He had felt the vast increase in the capacity for
feeling and understanding of a group of people assem¬
bled together. He had perceived the mystery of col¬
lective intelligence by virtue of which each individual
has a better grasp of the nuances of a play because one
person's love merges into that of another, because one
person's emotion releases a tumult in another person's
breast. This sense of a collective identity may find
expression in more questionable gatherings. At the
time of the Crusades in France, there was a great
orator by the name of Bernard, Saint Bernard. He
spoke in Latin; people didn't understand what he said.
They set off all the same, for an empty tomb.
In the 1950s, when President Gamel Abdel Nasser
of Egypt spoke for hours before a microphone, people
didn't understand all he said. Yet his metallic voice
gave out a strange vibration, a music which was wafted
by the desert wind, contained all the sonorities of the
Arabic language, and spurred the Arabs to go off and
liberate another empty tomb. This form of collective
understanding may assume mythological and dramatic
proportions.
Coming back to your main field of interest, what
developments are we likely to see in the audiovisual
media in the next few years?
In the coming decade cinema and television will
be concerned with feeling and memory, they will be
looking at civilizations, at stories of people. They will
present inspired actors who will speak of us simply,
from the heart. They will draw on the sensibility of
trees and animals, on a life-oriented culture which, for
centuries, for millennia, has been all around us.
Programmes centred on feeling and memory will in¬
creasingly get higher audience ratings than those based
on an "American model" which is on its way out.
What is this "American model"?
In television, the American model is the kind of
programme that's a mixture of the variety show and
the game show, where the crassest kind of mass appeal
is linked with the prospect of winning prizes, the kind
of show that tries to appeal to a public that is assumed
to be greedy and mindless. Another example is Dallas.
Needy people, in some cases dying of hunger, are
shown the unimaginable adventures of unimaginable
millionaires. But in my opinion this kind of stuff has
no future, even in the United States. The depravities
of the heroes of Dallas no longer interest anyone.
Underlying this model is the idea that "this is
what the public wants, let's give it to them". Since
people aren't interested in dreams, let's keep dreams
]]>

out of it, anything to keep them glued to their sets.
But now people have learnt to dream again. And this
famous American model is slowly collapsing. It was
the Americans themselves who were the first to realize
this, for the people who run the media in the United
States are smart. They understood before anyone else
that this model had had its day and that they would
have to come up with something different from the
standard cops and robbers story with a car chase, a
naked woman and a few spectacular stunts. That's all
over now. These images and situations are so familiar
that they no longer hold people's attention.
What are the Americans doing to sort out this
problem?
They are going back to the intellect, to another
kind of consensus. They want to go back to Alexandre
Dumas, Walter Scott, Shakespeare. They are suddenly
realizing that the world has grown older and is
rediscovering its poetry. The heart of the world is
beginning to age, it's like a ripe fruit, it's sweeter and
more poetic...
Did Spielberg and Lucas blaze the trail towards this
new consensus?
Yes, they were the trailblazers. Star Wars is a
film of great beauty containing images worthy of a
surrealist painting. Spielberg and Lucas were the first
film-makers to understand the power of legend and
myth. There must once have been a time when human
beings and animals knew how to communicate with
each other. In all religions, pagan as well as monotheis¬
tic or Buddhist, the ultimate dream, the only myth
they have in common, is that of the earthly paradise,
a place where humans, animals and the elements speak
to each other, the idea of a world of communication
and peace.
7s that what you were lookingfor in yourfilms about
animals?
In my films about animals I was looking for the
meaning of something once said by the French
philosopher of science Gaston Bachelard which made
a profound impression on me and which I have been
repeating since I started making films: "Animals are
our oldest dream companions." Before man stood
upright, before he started thinking, he lived in the
permanent and direct company of animals. Animals
were the earliest models for his cave paintings, his
earliest totemic emblems. They were the source of his
fears, his joys, his dreams; for tens of thousands of
years his only music was the singing of birds.
For you communication seems to be synonymous with
poetry...
It is becoming increasingly necessary to commu¬
nicate dreams, to communicate a sense of immanence.
But it must be said at once that this can only be
achieved in a democracy. Democracy, as Winston
Churchill said, is the worst system there is, with the
exception of all the others. Communication in a
democracy is the worst form of communication, but
there is really no other way. Simply because of the
necessary dialectic of yes and no, of provocation and
response, which allows us to find the golden mean,
the right proportion of light and shade.
Democracy, fortunately, has recently been making
great strides. At the expense of ideology. Communi¬
cation, in the broad sense, will be strengthened. What
about culture?
One might even say that the age of ideologies is
drawing to a close and the age of cultures is begin¬
ning.. .in the sense that through freedom, which is
emerging from its ideological shackles, the deeply
rooted cultures of every country will at last be able
to find expression. Look at what's happening with
democratization in the Soviet Union, for instance. At
last all the buried cultural energies of that huge
country are being released: novels, poetry, music,
religion too. Culture needs this concert of instruments
to create the extraordinary sounds of human memory
and human intelligence.

<![CDATA[
Aren't you afraid ofcontradictions, tensions, even of
outbursts of aggression?
Creative people always swim against the tide.
They never knuckle under. Why not? Because they
foresee what is going to happen and the people around
them see nothing. A great creator is also a prophet.
A prophet is someone who remembers, who has
total recall of the future because he knows the past.
But once again, for the renaissance of universal
memory there is only one place, only one agora-
democracy.
You mean worldwide?
Of course. In the northern hemisphere it's already
happening. In the South, it is bound to happen before
too long. Everywhere democracy will put an end to
fear, smash inhibitions, give free rein to all kinds of
provocation, all kinds of poetry. It will at last allow
people to dream, and to die, freely.
How do you answer those who think that your head
is in the clouds ofpoetry and dreams, and your feet
are not on the ground, in a world of suffering,
upheaval and drama?
No one is more realistic than the poet. In 1936
Paul Eluard wrote: "The Earth is blue like an orange."
Everyone laughed. When the first American spaceship,
Pioneer, photographed the Earth, people saw that it
did indeed look like a blue orange. Eluard had antici¬
pated Pioneer. Poets are the only realists. They go
straight to the heart of the matter.
That reminds me of an interview I had with Mao
Zedong. The last question I asked him was: "Mr.
Chairman, do you think that communism has a
future in China?" His reply was no. The scene was
the great hall in the Palace of the Emperors, in the
Forbidden City, full of huge armchairs covered with
white drapes. Behind Mao Zedong were Lin Biao and
Zhou Enlai. When Mao gave his answer Lin Biao
looked startled, but Zhou Enlai didn't turn a haira
sign of the difference between the two men.
Then Mao went on: "What are 250 or 300 years
to us here in China? Barely a third of the T'ang
period.... The T'ang ruled China for a thousand
years." Mao's reply was subtle and beautiful. I think
that what he meant was this: for you, a Westerner,
what is the political horizon? The next election? For
us, the political horizon is three centuries...
And I said to myself, what an extraordinary con¬
tribution to world history and culture and to a real
understanding of people and things liberated China
will be able to offer us, finding inspiration simulta¬
neously in the sayings of Confucius, the Tao, the
ancient Chinese poets, Sun Yat Sen and Mao
Zedong.... This major branch of world history, largely
isolated from the rest of humanity for 5,000 years, will
extend its influence in our direction, offering us its
memory like a priceless lost treasure, at last regained...
Perhaps in conclusion you would like to say some¬
thing about the cultural magazine that you are
preparing for television with the Unesco Courier.
Yes. We've been thinking about doing this
programme for years, but so far we haven't been able
to do it, because life's like thatmade up of successful
partnerships, illusory loves and lost opportunities, or
opportunities that we think are lost but which, in
reality, were simply not there because the time was
not ripe. Now the time is ripe.
The programme, whose French version we have
decided to call Le Divan de Scheherazade, after
Shahrazad, the girl in Thousand and One Nights who
miraculously holds the sultan spellbound by telling
him stories, should meet an urgent need. With mul¬
ticultural themes, reports from all over the world,
interviews with creators and scientists, treasures from
the world's libraries and museums all forming part of
a single heritage, all the wonders of the world brought
together and woven into a single tapestry, I hope our
programme will respond to a desire for a combina¬
tion of imagination and information, for an exciting
voyage across the continents of culture and the oceans
of knowledge. This is just the kind of television
programme for tomorrow that should be available
today.
Basically, we're producing this magazine
programme because we feel the time is ripe for it, that
public opinionsomething that no one has ever been
able to define and yet something that defines us all

is ready. We don't know why, but we are convinced
that there is a need for this kind of television. The
signs are everywhere, primarily in the rise of
democratic hopes which are increasingly calling for
a creativity freed from contempt for others and based
on respect for all.
Today bridges are waiting to be built between East
and West, but also between North and South,
between societies ofEuropean culture and all other
societies...
Those are the bridges for which there is the
greatest need. Our programme must help to add to
their number, providing a platform for poets every¬
where, an amplifier for the drums that will beat out
the rhythms of African and Asian music to which
Westerners will respond.... The secret is not to present
the creative act in isolation but to show it in a context,
to link it to what sheds light on it. If for example we
want to present Indonesian culture to a European
audience, we'll start by showing the faces of Indone¬
sians amidst colours they are particularly fond of; then
an aerial view of the Indonesian countryside, divided
into tiny plotsan abstract pattern. Next we'll go into
the temple of Borobudur, an unprecedented example
of a Buddhist sanctuary rescued and restored at great
expense by a Muslim people. Finally, we'll play
Indonesian gamelan music. By this time Europeans
will have no difficulty in following the subtle rhythms
of this music, which is among the most beautiful in
the world. If it is played to a European audience unpre¬
pared, they will be taken aback. Our aim is thus to
restore to cultural phenomena their natural poetic aura
and thereby make them immediately accessible to
everyone.
To take another example: the whirling dervishes,
who live in the mountains between Iran and Iraq. If
you show the dervishes without any form of introduc¬
tion, dancing until they reach a state of trance, the
average viewer will be shocked. But if you start by
showing them as they are, if you go into their tents,
if you show slow motion shots of storks flying in the
sky, if you then take to the mountains and follow a
wolf which finds the path to the sanctuary where the
dervishes have begun to sing, if you explain that the
word dervish means poor, and if finally the viewer
sees, in a succession of static shots, the dervishes
reproduce the movement of the storks, then they'll
be perceived and accepted in another way. We are
presenters, go-betweens. Each culture needs mediation
vis-à-vis others. We must offer the cultures of the
South this mediation vis-à-vis the cultures of the
North. And vice versa.
The miracle of Shahrazad reminds us that language
is made for communicating to the children of human
beings the dreams of others. That's the important
thing and that's what we shall be trying to do
togetherfor viewers all over the world. For them
we shall become the shapers of dreams that will usher
in the third millennium.

"Allegory of History
writing under the direction
of Minerva". Detail of a
painting by Charles Joseph
Natoire (1700-1777).
ALL societies have a past, but not all of them have evaluated their past
in the same way, nor used the same procedures to recall it. The kind of
questions people ask about former times have been-and still are-stimulated
by happenings in their own society. Attitudes towards memory itself have
varied widely in different civilizations, depending on social structures and
power systems, on whether or not writing was used, on the nature of the
dominant religion, on relationships with time and death, and on many other
factors.
The conventions of modern historiography are so widely accepted today that
we take them for granted and find it hard to appreciate that there are many
other possible approaches to the past. Not all societies have, for example,
organized their recollections chronologically.
Modern historiography seems to be experiencing something of a boom. Not
only are the stories of kings and princes, peoples and nations still being told
and retold, but virtually every group and institution seems to want its history
to be written. Another widespread modern trend is the fashion for "instant
history". Once upon a time the historian did not begin to piece together the
historical record until events had fallen into some kind of perspective. Today
however television and the other mass media present their audience with
history as it is being made, lessening the distance between the headlines and
the history books and blurring boundaries between the newsworthy and the
historical.
At the same time there is a growing and sometimes obsessive concern with
earlier modes of perceiving history, with reconstructing the past from
memories that are fading or have been suppressed-memories preserved in
speech or writing, memories of Auschwitz or the Gulag, above all memories
of the victims of history. Memory itself is becoming a subject for historical
. ..
Investigation.
When they began to explore the ramifications of man's relations with the
past, the Editors of the Unesco Courier soon realized that it would be impossible
to do justice to such a vast subject in a single issue. Here, then, is the first
of two successive numbers on aspects of world historiography past and present.
Its theme is "History and Memory", the process whereby historians have
tried to conquer time and save the past from oblivion.

<![CDATA[
and time A,
BY FRANÇOIS HARTOG
Construction of the Tower of
Babel. (16th-century Flemish
painting).
Lccording to the French anthropologist
Louis Dumont, "when we talk about history we
do not think only of an absolute or relative
chronology but also of a chain of causality, or
rather a series of significant changes. We live in
history in the sense that we perceive how people,
societies and civilizations develop in time. We
almost go so far as to believe, contrary to most
societies, that only change has a meaning, and not
permanence."1
This conception of time as a vector and factor
of progress dates back to the age of the European
Enlightenment. It is a transposition into secular
terms of a Christian concept in which the key
events are the Creation, the Incarnation and the
End of Time. Its fullest expression may be found
in Hegel's philosophy of history and in Marx's
historical materialism. It maintains that truth is
not enshrined in a holy book but in history, the
true story of what the eighteenth-century'
German philosopher Johann Gottfried von
Herder called "the human soul through the'
ages and among the nations". In history the (at
least potential) immortality of humanity is
revealed.
In the practice of history, time is an instru¬
ment and chronology is the supreme principle of
classification. Anachronism is the worst of sins.
There are however other forms of relation¬
ship with time, other versions of time, governed
not by the law of chronological succession but
by principles of accumulation, superimposition,
imitation, coexistence and reabsorption.
Memorizing the Vedas
In Brahmanic India, for example, memory is not
concerned with a chain of recollections organized
chronologically, and, as the French Sanskrit
scholar Charles Malamoud has pointed out, the
idea of a "world of memory" does not exist. "Far
from giving shape to a biography," Malamoud
has written, "memories cause the outline of a
person to become blurred and open-ended," to
the point that he or she may say, "if I master the
right techniques, and especially if I gain the neces¬
sary merits, I shall be able to recall my former
lives".
Alongside this "ordinary" memory, given
over to recollection, there is another kind of
memory, consciously trained, tightly controlled
and wholly dedicated to memorization. This kind
of memory is used to learn by heart the sacred
text of the Vedas, which, even though they were
committed to writing by the third century BC
at the latest, are primarily transmitted orally. Em¬
ploying a series of sophisticated techniques which
result in the "disarticulation" of the text, the
Brahmans gradually "incorporate" it into the
person of the pupil. The text must be recited
faultlessly. It is both sinful and ritually disastrous
to make a mistake. By the end of this rigorous
preparation, the text has become separated from
its context and has acquired a timeless quality. 13

FRANÇOIS HARTOG,
French historian, is director
of studies at the Ecole des
hautes études en sciences
sociales in Paris. Among his
published works on ancient
and modern historiography
are Le miroir d'Hérodote
(Gallimard, Paris, 1980; "The
Mirror of Herodotus") and Le
19e siècle et l'histoire: le cas
Fustel de Coulanges (PUF,
Paris, 1988; "The 19th
Century and History: the
Case of Fustel de
Coulanges").
This way of cultivating memory is poles apart
from the Western approach to history; it reflects
a different conception of time, memory and
historicity.
The keys
to immortality
Herodotus, the father of Western history, opens
his Histories with an assertion of his desire to
preserve the traces of human activity from obli¬
vion. Faced with the immutability of nature and
the immortality of the gods, the historian
describes these highly ephemeral traces orally
and preserves them in writing. The successor
of the epic poet, he claims to hold the keys to
immortality.
Although history and memory are indissoci¬
able, the relations between them have been
complex, changing and marked by conflict.
Thucydides was convinced that only the history
of the present can be "scientific" and believed
that the historical record is established largely in
spite of memory, which is always unreliable. His
nineteenth-century counterparts were also anx¬
ious to separate history and memory, but on the
grounds that ideally history is the past and only
the past: history ends where memory begins.

Recently, however, memory has invaded the
realm of history, and both concepts must now
be reconsidered. How, in the case of the exter¬

with the demands of historiography? Formerly
considered to be impure, memory is becoming
part of the stuff of history: there is now a history
of memory.
The memory
of a people
The injunction to "remember"in Hebrew
Zakhoroften occurs in the Bible and in Judaism.
Israel is continually ordered not to forget, not to
submit to oblivion. Zakhor is also the title of a
book by Yosef Yerushalmi, which takes this im¬
perative of remembrance as the starting-point of
a study of the Jews' relationship with their past.
It is true that the Bible is a sacred, written text,
but it is first and foremost a revealed text, like
the Vedas. And like the Vedas, the Torah2 must
be studied, learnt, memorized.
But the relationship of the Jews to their holy
Book is quite different from that of the Brahmans
to the Vedas. There is no attempt to disarticu¬
late the written text and remove it from its con¬
text. For the Jews the important thing is what
happened and how it happened, starting with di¬
vine revelation. Revelation is history and, since
the banishment from Paradise, primeval time has
become transformed into historical time. The
Bible story, which is historical in its basic struc¬
ture, is bound to be the record of the march of
time and of humanity: the memory of history and
the memory of human beings.
But in this case the obligation to remember
does not give rise to any curiosity about the past
as such, nor to the idea expressed by Herodotus
that it is important to save from oblivion the erga,
the noteworthy traces of human activity. The
only past that matters consists of God's interven¬
tions in history and the human reactions they
provoked.
Although the Jews never ceased to heed the
injunction to remember, there came a time when
they stopped writing history. Perhaps it was then
that the need to remember became even more im¬
portant than before. Memory and history, which
until then had been joined together, seemed to
part company. Rabbinic literature, after the Bible,
has no historiographie dimension.
It has been said that the watershed was the
synod at Jamnia (c. 100 AD), which fixed the
Jewish canon of the Bible. The figure of the con¬
temporary Jewish priest and historian Flavius
Josephus may appear as the exception that proves
the rule for it was not until centuries later that
another Jew declared himself to be a historian.
And yet, Yerushalmi believes, it would be wrong
to think that the rabbis were uninterested in his¬
tory. On the contrary, he believes that it is easier
to understand their attitude if we accept that they
were totally immersed in history. Besides relating
history as it had come to pass, the Bible also
presents the fabric of all present and future
history. Its meaning is clear; everything else is of
no more than incidental interest, not really worth
bothering about.
Only this purpose of history, or at least of
the writing of history, is important here. It raises
a number of difficult questions, including the fol¬
lowing. What is the link between history and
place, in this case the Temple in Jerusalem? Once
the Second Temple had been destroyed, was it
(still) possible for the Jews to write history?
Flavius Josephus, for example, stressed the link
between the writing of history and the Temple,
which alone gave countenance and authority to
the historian.
The rabbinic academy founded by Yochanan
ben Zakkai at Jamnia after the destruction of the
Temple was "a place of memory" but not a
workshop for historians. The point was admira¬
bly made by Freud in 1938 when he wrote, "The
political woes of the Jewish people taught them
to appreciate the value of the only property left
to them, their Scriptures. Immediately after the
destruction of the Jerusalem Temple by Titus,
Rabbi Yochanan ben Zakkai sought permission
to open the first school for the teaching of the
Torah, at Jamnia. From that time onwards, Holy
Scripture and spiritual interest kept the Diaspora
together."

Lerodotus of Halicarnassus, his Researches
are here set down to preserve the memory of the
past by putting on record the astonishing achieve¬
ments both of our own and of other peoples...
that the great deeds of men may not be forgotten...
whether Greeks or foreigners: and especially, the
causes of the war between them."*
In this introduction to his Histories, Herodo¬
tus (c. 490-425 BC) provides us with perhaps the
earliest definition of the historian's aims and con¬
cerns. Some sixty years earlier, his precursor
Hecataeus of Miletus, who had sought to inquire
rationally into the mythical legends of the
Greeks, explained his intentions in the follow¬
ing terms: "Thus speaks Hecataeus of Miletus:
I write these things inasmuch as I consider them
to be truthful; in fact, the legends of the Greeks
are numerous and, to my mind, ridiculous." In
this tetchy assertion of the author's role we can
already see the two requirements of historiogra¬
phy in the Hellenic world: it must be written and
it must be truthful.
With Herodotus the tone changes. He does
not seek to give his own personal interpretation
of what he relates, and usually he compares the
different versions of stories he has collected. He

wants to talk about his researches, tell of his
inquiries. History as he understands it is at once
the gathering of information and the recounting
of a story. He thus inaugurated the two main
trends in Greek historiography for centuries
to come. Sometimes one would be given
prominence, sometimes the other, but the prime
imperative was always truthfulness, even in the
case of historians who attached very great impor¬
tance to narrative.
The art of storytelling
When Herodotus describes his work as an "ex¬
position of his researches, the narration of an in¬
quiry", these ambivalent terms must be taken to
mean both the oral transmission of a story and
its written formulation. The blending of oral and
written styles in the Histories can be explained
by the fact that Herodotus would give public
readings of the various stories (logoi) making up
his work. This is confirmed by the allusions in
the text to audience reaction, and by the circular
structure of the writing.

This practice had a marked effect on the com¬
position of the work, which may seem to be
something of a patchwork, with its countless
digressions that sometimes fit into one another
like Chinese boxes or Russian dolls. More a
painter than a sculptor, Herodotus excels in the
art of storytelling and possesses the gift of en¬
thralling his audience, whether listener or reader,
by his descriptions of a detail, an episode or an
individual.
He often tells a story which he has heard at
second or third hand. For example, after describ¬
ing the victory of the Athenians over the Persi¬
ans at Marathon, he tells what happened to the
Athenian soldier Epizelos, who lost his sight
while fighting in the battle, though nothing had
hit him: "I am told that in speaking about what
happened to him he used to say that he fancied
he was opposed by a man of great stature in heavy
armour, whose beard overshadowed his shield;
but the phantom passed him by, and killed the
man at his side." It would be a mistake to see this
as Herodotus directly reporting what he has
heard, but rather as an example of the mirror play
that is a common feature of the Histories: Epizelos
tells his story, others repeat it, Herodotus hears
it and tells it in his turn.
This is not simply a taste for the fantastic or
the marvellous, for which Herodotus is so often
criticized, but a delight in intriguing and surpris¬
ing his audience. He is able to arouse people's
curiosity because his own is so great. He is in¬
terested in all kinds of out-of-the-way details, the
customs of each people and all the wonders of
the world, whether events, inventions or monu¬
ments like the pyramids of Egypt, the labyrinth
above Lake Moeris and the walls of Babylon. In
his quest for knowledge, Herodotus would travel
and make inquiries of those who might have in¬
formation about the countries visitedscholars,
priests or people whose names are not recorded:
"I learn by inquiry."
The reason for this passion for research
emerges clearly in the introduction to the Histo¬
ries: it is the historian's task to combat time, to
preserve what he considers to be memorable. In
the Greek cities and sanctuaries there were al¬
ready "memorizers" (mnemones) responsible for 17

recollecting and recording divine and human oc¬
currences. But the historian's concerns are much
loftier than the purely administrative, legal and
religious functions of the mnemones. All the
illustrious deeds and labours (ergo) that he relates
must retain their kleos, their aura of glory, their
renown. In some ways Herodotus seems to carry
on where the epic poets left off. They recounted
the deeds of heroes, the historian recounts the
deeds of men.
The insatiable curiosity shown by Herodotus
in his investigations and travels considerably
broadened the scope of written history, which
ceased to consist solely of myths, genealogical lists
and ethno-historical material relating to particular
peoples or communities. Although he wanted to
preserve as much as possible, he had to select
which of the facts to save. For the historian who
takes as his subject "great and marvellous
actions", not everything is memorable.
Herodotus was aware of the amount of space
given in his Histories to the long parentheses of
the storyteller. On one occasion he even confess¬
es: "I need not apologize for the digressionit
has been my plan throughout this work." To un¬
derstand this attitude, we should not use modern
criteria nor even refer to later Greek authors
whose works, which were designed exclusively
to be read, seem to be better constructed. In a
work addressed primarily to listeners and only
subsequently to readers, not only the form but
the choice of material were determined by the
exigencies of spoken communication. It is not
enough for details to be historically revealing or
admirable; they must also be entertaining and,
whether glorious or despicable, arouse the curi¬
osity of the narrator and strike a chord in the
minds of his audience.
An investigator at work
What was Herodotus' raw material? Much of the
Histories records the history and customs of peo¬
ples incorporated in the Persian empire (or those
of peoples like the Scythians which were unsuc¬
cessfully fought by the empire) as well as facts
about the Greek cities in the sixth and fifth cen¬
turies BC. The culmination is confrontation be¬
tween the Greeks and the Persians, which
accounts for less than half the work.
Herodotus does not speak of a single people,
nor even of a single Greek city, nor of Greece
in its entirety. He erects no barriers, shows no
scorn. He does not really differentiate between
the Greeks and other peoples, the "Barbarians".
Born at a time which, under the influence of the
Sophists, saw the development of cultural relati¬
vism, and originating from a region at the
meeting-point of East and West, he showed curi¬
osity, consideration and even respect for other
cultures.
He nevertheless viewed them through Greek
eyes. In keeping with a typically Hellenic way
of seeing the foreigner as a reversed image of

oneself, he depicted the behaviour of other peoples
as the antithesis of that of the Greeks. Among
the "strange practices" of the Egyptians, for ex¬
ample, he mentions that "women attend market
and are employed in trade, while men stay at
home and do the weaving.... Men in Egypt carry
loads on their heads, women on their shoul¬
ders...." His enumeration of their differences ends
as follows: "In writing or calculating, instead of
going, like the Greeks, from left to right, the
Egyptians go from right to leftand obstinately
maintain that theirs is the dexterous method, ours
being left-handed and awkward."
This comparative method can be seen as a
way of classifying and hence of understanding.
But Herodotus also observes similarities, which
he scrupulously notes, as in the case of the
Spartans. Customs on the death of a king, he
reports, "are the same in Sparta as in Asia", and
"the Spartans resemble the Egyptians in that they
make certain callings hereditary: town-criers (her¬
alds), flute-players and cooks are all, respectively,
sons of fathers who followed the same
profession."
Although he does not go as far as Thucydides
in saying that the Greeks lived formerly in the
same way as the Barbarians today, and although
he maintains a distance between the two worlds,
he does not regard them as two monolithic
blocks, one of which is in certain respects inferior
to the other or culturally backward. Different
though they may be, he acknowledges the many
qualities of the Barbarians, considering, for ex¬
ample, that the Greek gods have Egyptian ori¬
gins, that Egyptian civilization is older than that
of the Greeks, and that the Persians have numer¬
ous virtues.
The Histories end with a revealing anecdote.
To convince his people not to attempt to settle
in more fertile lands, the Persian King Cyrus the
Great declares to his troops that "soft countries
breed soft men", pointing out that the Greeks
have preferred to keep their freedom on a harsh
land rather than to be slaves cultivating fertile
plains for others. It is thus a Persian sovereign
who enunciates a truth applying chiefly to the
Greeks. Herodotus also sets among the Persians
a discussion on the best form of government-
democracy, oligarchy or monarchy. They are
foreigners, enemies, but not completely different.
They could even, in theory at least, be like the
Greeks, in the same way that the Greeks in some
respects resemble them.
Herodotus does not try to describe a series
of mythical or historical events since their ori¬
gins or even from one of the traditional mile¬
stones in Greek history, as other historians were
to do after him. His field of studythe Median
wars and the events that led up to themcovers
a fairly recent period. That which is remote in
time is left to poets and genealogists. He displays
the same attitude towards Egypt, distinguishing
what he has witnessed personally from the infor¬
mation he has collected from the Egyptians. If
he consults Persian, Phoenician or Egyptian scho¬
lars about mythical episodes, such as the abduc¬
tion of Helen and the Trojan War, it is mainly
in order to retrace and understand the causes of
the Median wars.
In choosing as his area of investigation recent
history of which he could have direct knowledge,
Herodotus had a decisive influence on the
development of historiography. Thucydides, half
a generation younger, would go even further
than his great predecessor, directing his gaze to
current events.

Thucydides
A dramatic vision of stirring events
%E know next to nothing about Thucydides apart
from the little he chose to say about -himself in the one
work he wrote but did not complete, the History of
the Peloponnesian War. He was born around 455 BC
into a rich, aristocratic Athenian family with valuable
foreign connections. The anti-Persian Aegean empire
of Athens was at the height of its power, based on a
warfleet of 170-oared triremes, and its democratic
system of government was newly radicalized by the
reforms associated with Pericles. Empire, democracy,
Pericles: these were the three axes around which
Thucydides rotated his charged account of the war
between Athens and Sparta (431-404 BC, although his
narrative breaks off in mid-sentence in the summer
of 411).
He was himself a participant in this conflict of
ideologies and military armaments, but no ordinary
one. In 424 BC he was elected general (strategos) by the
democratic assembly of Athenian citizens, only to be
forced into exile that same year for a failure that was
not his sole responsibility. He remained in exile for the
remainder of the war, profiting, he claimed, from his
ability to see things more from the other, Spartan side.
But for all his vaunted objectivity, it is difficult not
to read his exalted praise of the statesmanlike Pericles
and his correspondingly bitter condemnation of the
folly of the Athenian masses and their "demagogue"
leaders as a commentary on his own political fate as
well as that of Athens.
Thucydides wanted his History to be and to be seen
as "a possession for all time". There are two reasons
why that wish has so far been granted. First, as the
title of his work subtly implies, Thucydides' vision of
the conflict has achieved a unique authority. For from
the Spartan point of view it was of course the "Athe¬
nian" war, the war against Athens and her imperial
allies and subjects. By no means everyone shared
Thucydides' emphatic opinions that it was the Spartans
who started it and that there was a single, twenty-seven-

year war as opposed to two ten-year bouts of fighting
interrupted by seven years of admittedly troubled
peace. Yet such is the power of his rhetoric that it is
difficult now to see not only the Spartan-Athenian mili¬
tary conflict but the entire second half of the fifth
century BC, the so-called golden age of Periclean
Athens, in any but Thucydidean terms.
Secondly, there are the speeches and debates in the
History, based no doubt in most cases on reliable
information as to what was actually said or at least what
were the main lines of argument, but invariably written
up by Thucydides with all the force of his remarkable
intellect and inimitable style. Massive controversy still
prevails over the precise relationship between these
Thucydidean creations and their supposed originals,
and over their intended functions within the structure
of the work. None has generated more heat than the
"Melian Dialogue", Thucydides' version of the negoti¬
ations conducted in camera between the Athenian high
command and the oligarchic government of the Aegean
island-state of Melos in 416-415 BC. Since he could not
possibly have known exactly how the negotiations
went, and since the issue was not in itself of the greatest
historical significance, I suggest that it is here that the
"scientific historian" in Thucydides most clearly gives
way to the moralist, political theorist and tragic
prose-poet.
What was the lesson of permanent utility that
Thucydides hoped to teach by this (to us) utterly
alien dramatic expository device? In my judgement it is
that human beings, when organized within states, do not
act towards other states in accordance with the moral
standards they normally recognize within their own
communities, but in accordance with their collective
self-interest as perceived chiefly in terms of security,
prestige and economic advantage. In which of the
world's potential flashpoints today does that iron law
not hold good? Thucydides will be with us for some
time yet.

Sima Qian
father of Chinese history
Jima QIAN (145-86 BC), the founder of Chinese
historiography, succeeded his father in the post of
Grand Historian at the court of the emperor Wudi
of the Western Han dynasty (206 BC-9 AD). His
masterwork, the Shiji ("Historical Records"), was
written over a period of some twenty years. Its 1 30
chapters, comprising almost 528,000 Chinese
characters, cover 24 centuries of history from the
reign of the first emperor to the beginning of the
first century BC.
It is organized according to a five-part plan, with
separate sections for dynastic annals (Benji); annals
of noble families (Shijia); genealogical tables (Biao);
monographs (Shu) on various aspects of government
such as ritual, astronomy, the calendar, the economy,
geography, or hydraulic projects; and biographies
(Liezhuan) of a variety of famous individuals including
politicians, scholars, strategists, writers, officials,
knights, doctors, astrologers and merchants.
Sima Qian's biographies, which take up 70
chapters, marked a new departure in historiography.
To a general history of the reigns of successive Sons
of Heaven (dynastic emperors) and an account of
actual events, he added the histories of individuals
as representatives of different social and professional
groups.
In an age when the Grand Historian of the court
was still an astrologer responsible for the calendar,
Sima Qian's approach was that of a modern historian.
Following in the footsteps of Confucius, the compiler
of "Spring and Autumn Annals", he built his work
on painstaking research and the selection and
criticism of documents.
In order to be worthy of the task ahead, he
began to study classical texts from the age of ten.
When he was twenty he left his study and set out
on a long journey through the provinces where he
struck up friendships with notable personalities,
investigated famous sites and made contact with
great scholars.
In this way he prepared the ground for the
writing of his monumental work. The remarkable
style and acute perception of the Shift soon made it
the model against which all subsequent dynastic his¬
tories would be judged. Later historians would adopt
the ¡deal method as defined by Sima Qian: "to ana¬
lyse in depth the relationship between the universe
and the human, and to grasp the meaning of historical
change in order to form one's own doctrine."

everything that the sovereign and his ministers did,
and presided over investiture ceremonies and the
worship of the ancestral heaven and earth spirits.
Every time an audience was given at the palace,
two historians, one on each side of the sovereign,
noted down his words and deeds. From these daily
records emerged two great historical works: a trea¬
tise, the Shahgsu, or "Speeches of the Preceding
Monarchs", and a chronicle, the Chunqiu, or
"Spring and Autumn Annals".
History was also closely linked with philosophy.
As a historian, Laozi (sixth-fifth century BC), the
father of Taoism, was responsible for maintaining
the archives of the Chou dynasty. The philosopher
and thinker Confucius (551-479 BC) is traditionally
believed to have compiled the annals of the kingdom
of Lu. The commentary on this work, the Zuozhuan,
or "Tradition of Zuo" by the blind historian Zuo
Qiuming, has become a classic of Chinese literature.
The man generally considered to be the father
of Chinese history, however, was Sima Qian
(145-86 BC), Grand Historian at the court of the
famous Han emperor Wudi (141-87 BC). His
Shiji, or "Historical Records", about half of which
consists of biographies, brought a new look to the
traditional vision of history by giving pride of place
to individual, human activity (see box this page).
This model was followed by all subsequent dynastic
histories, including the renowned Hanshu, or "His¬
tory of the Han", written by Ban Gu (32-92 AD)
and members of his family.
The Shitong, or "Treatise on History", written

empress Zetian, was the first treatise on historical

method. The author demanded three qualities of the
budding historianliterary talent, knowledge and
a critical mind. He identified six schools of historical
thought and classified all historical works under two
main headingschronicles and biographies.
Another work of synthesis was the Zizhe
tongjian, or "Comprehensive Mirror for Aid in
Government", by Sima Guang (1019-1086). This
vast selection from source chronicles consists of 295
chapters and spans over 1,300 years of history, going
up to the middle of the tenth century AD. It is
actually a collective work. Sima Guang's three main
collaborators, themselves celebrated historians,
gathered the greatest number of documents possible
from official and private libraries and then classi¬
fied them under theme headings and in chronolog¬
ical order. Sima Guang made the final selection,
taking as his criterion of choice from the enormous
range of material available those items that he con¬
sidered would provide the information most useful
to a sovereign.
During the troubled political times of the
Northern and Southern dynasties (222-598 AD), the
function of the Grand Historian of the court was
limited to astrology and the calendar. These were
secretary/historians who simply recorded the deeds
of the emperors.
The Historiography Office
In the seventh century, the early T'ang emperors
were keenly interested in the idea that history could
be an "instructive mirror", and the reign of emperor

Shiguan, or Historiography Office, whose prime
task was the compilation of dynastic histories. This
task was entrusted to specially appointed civil
servants and no longer to hereditary historians. The
emperor almost always maintained firm control
over the Office, for which the heads of the great
ministries acted as principal editors.
This process of bureaucratization was to have
decisive consequences. The historians became less
independent with regard to anything concerning
politics and public opinion. The director of this vast
collective enterprise, in addition to being a good
historian, had also to be a first class administrator,
qualities rarely to be found in combination in a
single individual. The work was divided up in such
a way that the historians tended to get lost in a sea
of documents. Finally, they were recruited from the
ranks of the literati regardless of whether or not they
had any aptitude as historians and this tended to put
the stamp of official approval on the traditional
blurring of the boundaries between literature and
history.
In view of the mediocrity of the output from
the imperial Historiography Office, parallel dynastic
histories began to appear. From the time of the
T'ang to that of the Yuan dynasty (1277-1367), the
centre of historiographical interest shifted. Works
of a new kind appeared, such as the Tongdian, the
first general history of institutions, by Du You, the
Tongzhi, or "General Monographs", by Zheng Qiao
(1104-1162), and the Wenxian tongkao, or "General
Critique of Documents", by Ma Duanlin (1254?-?).
These were veritable "encyclopaedias" containing
sections on a variety of subjects such as economics,
politics, teaching, religions, customs and even
language.
During the transition between the Ming and the
Qing dynasties (1644-1911), Huang Zongxi (1609-
1695) published his Mingru Xue'an, or "Treatise on
the Doctrines of the Ming Confucian Schools", the

of the great thinkers. The Dushi fangyu jiyao, by Gu
Zuyu (1624-1680), analysed the interconnection
between history and its geographical setting.
Under the Manchu Qing dynasty (1644-
1911), the Wenshi tongyi, or "General Significance
of History and Literature", by Zhang Xuecheng
(1738-1801), extended the concept of history to
every field and drew a distinction between works
that were doctrinally inspired and those that were
purely informative.
The Manchu emperors, especially Kangxi
(1662-1722) and Qianlong (1736-1795), attached great
importance to the compilation of histories. A
historiographie bureau traced the history of the
recently overthrown Ming dynasty, producing 336
volumes over a period of 81 years. Other bureaux
drafted the history of the reigning dynasty, the his¬
tory of the nation or that of the emperor's daily life.
The latter type of document is a mine of infor¬
mation for the modern historian. From the moment
the emperor leaves his apartment to hold his first
audience, a complete record is made of everything
he does, what clothes he is wearing and even what
food he eats. The observations noted down would
have been condensed and completed by the staff of
the administrative archives and published under the
following emperor under the title Shilu, or
"Authentic Documents".
Large compilations were also made of both
ancient and modern texts, such as the Gujin tushu
jicheng and the Siku quanshu, in which over 3,000
works were reproduced. Another vast labour initiated
by the emperors was the compilation throughout all
China of monographs on local geography, ethnog¬
raphy and archaeology.
The role of the official historian reached its
pinnacle during the reign of Qianlong. With the
decline of the Manchu dynasty, most Chinese
historiographical traditions disappeared. The Qing-
shigao, "Draft Official History of the Qing Dy¬
nasty", is their swan song. H

'Remember...' The Jews
and their past
¡UfcfetiCi

BY LIONEL KOCHAN
SHORTLY before his death Moses besought his
people not to neglect their past: "Remember the
days of old, consider the years of many generations:
ask thy father, and he will show thee, thy elders,
and they will tell thee" (Deuteronomy, 32:7).
Despite this exhortation, the study of the past
and the practice of historiography did not flourish
among the Jews. In the late 70s of the Common Era
(AD), the Jewish priest and historian Flavius
Josephus published his narrative of the Jewish war
against Rome and, twenty years later, his general
history The Antiquities of the Jews. But it was not
until a millennium and a half later, towards the end
of the sixteenth century, that genuine historiography
emerged among the Jews with the "History of the
Kings of France and the Kings of the Ottoman
Empire" by Rabbi Joseph Ha-Cohen (1496-1578),
who hailed his new departure in these terms: "Within
the whole gate of my people there has not yet arisen
an historian in Israel like Josephus.. .they ceased, the

unto Life..." is depicted in this detail of a Hebrew
illuminated manuscript from northern Italy
(c. 1450-1470).
writers of memorials, they ceased, until I arose, even
I, Joseph."
How can the fifteen-century interval between
the time of Josephus and Joseph Ha-Cohen be
explained? The question is all the more pertinent
because the Jews, after all, are popularly regarded as
the people of history par excellence. Their foundation
document, the Hebrew Bible, takes the form of a
national history; and their conception of God is that
of a being whose prime concern is on two levels,
the personal and the historical.
The presence of the past
But this is precisely where the difficulty lies. We
are dealing here with a conception of the past not
as a movement away from a fixed point but as some¬
thing enduring, an ever-present reality which is
nourished by the rhythmic lunar calendar of the
Jews and the regular cycle of their festivals, most 25

of which commemorate the events of the past and
maintain them in the present. The Haggadah text,
for example, read each year at the Passover festival
to commemorate the Exodus from Egypt, contains
the injunction "in each and every generation let each
person regard himself as though he had come forth
out of Egypt".
The importance attached to the past and the
continued presence ofthat past explain Jews' relative
lack of interest in their post-biblical history. All
possible historical interest is already exhausted by
the Scriptures, which explain where the Jews origi¬
nated, where they stand in the present and where
they are going. The historical framework of the Jews
' is predetermined by the fact that, in a certain sense,
their history is already writtenthe divine revela¬
tion to Moses on Mount Sinai has promised them
a part of central importance in the future of the
world in that, through Israel, "shall all families of
the earth be blessed" (Genesis, 12:3). Israel already
knows its end. No matter what suffering and trials
may be experienced, it is part of the very order of
the world that Israel will enjoy its messianic reward.
Furthermore, if these historical models are as
dominant as Scripture and the Talmud (the Jewish
compendium of law, lore and commentary) sought
to make them, then it is difficult to see how subse¬
quent history could seem meaningful and worthy
of record. It could add nothing of substance to what
has already been made manifest. Origins, future and
finality have already been disposed of.
Broadly speaking, except for chronicles and
martyrologies, this outlook was dominant until the

the Judeo-Hellenistic writings of Philo of Alexandria
(which had been consistently neglected by the rab¬
bis), the source of the Septuagint,1 the relatively
late origin of the Hebrew calendar, the historical
value of folklore and allegory. Rossi also stood
out from his Jewish contemporaries by virtue of
his much greater degree of familiarity with non-
Jewish sourcesclassical, medieval and
Renaissance.
As far as a "modern" approach to history is
concerned, ibn Verga's "Sceptre of Judah" is
notable for its naturalistic interpretation. The
principal theme is the suffering and persecution
undergone by the Jews, which ibn Verga had
himself experienced as one of those expelled from
Spain. Characteristic of his work is the effort to
understand this and similar sufferings not solely
in terms of divine providence and punishment
but in terms of the interaction of historical forces
and the conduct of the Jews themselves. "The
exile persists for natural reasons," he wrote,
"because of religious hatred and the desire of the
[Spanish] ruler to subject everyone to his faith
and belief." But he felt that the Jews had also to
some extent brought their suffering on themselves
through their arrogance, their segregation, and
their false oaths.

had no immediate successors. The atmosphere of

is a British historian
specializing in Jewish and
European history. Now
retired, he was formerly

History at the University of
Warwick (UK) and before

history at the Universities
of Edinburgh and East
Anglia. He is the author of
many books and articles on
Jewish and European
history.
the Enlightenment, with its quest for universal
values and development, was in any case averse to
concentration on the particular. In the late eight¬
eenth century the German-Jewish philosopher
Moses Mendelssohn, the foremost representative of
the Jewish Enlightenment (Haskala) confessed that
"I always yawn when I must read something histor¬
ical". On the other hand, it was precisely at this
period that a knowledge of Jewish history and of
the Jewish past came to be regarded as indispens¬
able to the "new Jew" that the Haskala sought to
produce. At this time the only suitable work avail¬
able was the French Huguenot Jacques Basnage's
five-volume L'histoire et la religion des Juifs ("History
and Religion of the Jews", 1706-1711). But a
proposal to translate it into German came to
nothing.
The science
of Judaism
The whole context of Jewish intellectual life in
western Europe was transformed at the beginning
of the nineteenth century. The study of the
Jewish past for its own sake now came to the fore.
A precursor of the new movement was Isaac
Markus Jost, whose "History of the Jews" was based
on the need "to mediate between synagogue and
world culture", that is to bring Jewish culture and
general history into harmony with one another. But
Jost's work, important though it was, fell into
eclipse compared with the achievement of the move¬
ment known as Wissenschaft des Judentums (the
Science of Judaism), founded by a group of young
German-Jewish intellectuals centred on Berlin and
its university. Their manifesto, set forth in 1822,
proclaimed the need for the "scientific" treatment
of Judaism aimed at "the systematic unfolding and
re-presentation of its object in its whole sweep, for
its own sake and not for any ulterior purpose...
unfolding Judaism in accordance with its essence...
without any preconceived opinion and not con¬
cerned in the final result".
The work of the German-Jewish historian
Leopold Zunz (1794-1886) perhaps best embodies
this ideal. A graduate of the universities of Berlin
and Halle, he saw the Jewish past in terms of a liter¬
ature that best expressed the spirit of Judaism.
Thus he devoted his researches mainly to the history
of the sermons and liturgies of Judaism, synagogal
poetry, and to important biographical studies,
notably of Azariah dei Rossi.
Although Zunz had no immediate disciples, his
work had a great deal to do with the expansion of
Jewish historical learning that marked the
nineteenth and twentieth centuries. Different view¬
points certainly emerged from this research but the
ideal of the objective scholar, as determined by the
Science of Judaism, remained paramount.
This development did not take place without
much adverse criticism, however. The Italian-Jewish
scholar Samuel David Luzzatto (1800-1865) argued
that, in pursuit of objectivity, the practitioners of
the science had forsaken their Jewish commitment
that they investigated Israel's past as others inves¬
tigated the past of Assyria, Egypt, Babylon or Per¬
sia and that the Jewish ideal of the unity of idea and
act would thereby be undermined.
This argument was further articulated in the
work of Nachman Krochmal of Galicia (1785-1840).
He saw in historicism the most serious challenge
to Judaism. How could the unchanging and eternal
word of God be reconciled with the evidence
provided by history of human intervention in the
transmission of the divine teaching? But to deny this
reality, Krochmal also argued, would be to reveal
the backwardness of Jewish scholarship in the eyes
of the younger generation and thus disillusion them
with Judaism altogether.
These controversies notwithstanding, Jewish

historiography seems to have contributed greatly to
the assertion of Jewish self-confidence and awareness.
Once the historical revolution had been fully
assimilated, works of outstanding importance were
produced in Germany by Heinrich Graetz (1817-
1891), in Russia by Simon Dubnow (1860-1941), and
in the United States by Salo Baron (1895-1989). Each
of them attempted a "universal" history of the Jewish
people, which each conceived within a different
framework of understanding.
Graetz, a graduate of the universities of Breslau
and Jena, saw Judaism as having both a spiritual and
a political dimension. He divided Jewish history into
a political era which ended with the destruction of
the Temple in Jerusalem in 587 BC; a second period,
mainly religious in character, which lasted until the
destruction of the Second Temple in 70 AD; and the
third epoch of dispersion which was one of deepening
self-consciousness leading to a "religious state-
constitution". The multi-volumed "History of the
Jews from Oldest Times to the Present"2 that
Graetz published between 1853 and 1876 did not
entirely match this pattern but it remains a
magisterial accomplishment for its period.
Dubnow's major work, a ten-volume "World
History of the Jewish People" (first published in
German, 1925-1929, and since translated into
several languages3), rejected what he saw as the
spiritual interpretation of Jewish history of Zunz
or Graetz in favour of a sociological emphasis that
concentrated on the structure ofJewish autonomy
in the various centres of the Diaspora. He saw the
dynamic centres of Jewish life moving from Pales¬
tine to Babylon and then to Spain, medieval
France and Germany, Poland and Lithuania.
These were all "substitutes for state forms",
Dubnow argued, which had however enabled the
Jews to preserve their uniqueness and their
nationhood without succumbing to the demands
of land and territory.
Baron's monumental Social and Religious
History oftheJews (3 volumes, 1937; 2nd edition, 18
volumes, 1952-1983) lacks the overall pattern that'
Graetz and Dubnow sought to give to their work
but is far better documented and has benefited
from the flowering of a century's research. Baron
dismisses what he terms "the lachrymose concep¬
tion of Jewish history" with its emphasis on perse¬
cution and suffering in favour of a view that asserts
Jewish national self-definition, both in the disper¬
sion and in the Land of Israel. Baron's forte was
his analytic gift and ability to marshal a quantity
of secondary material.
Apart from these comprehensive works,
knowledge of the Jewish past has been enriched
and transformed by a multiplicity of more special¬
ized works. Many of these have been written in
Hebrew by historians from the universities of
Israel; others, written in a variety of languages, have
emanated from the United States and Europe.

BY FRIEDRICH WILHELM GRAF
Christianity
and
history
30
Ahe relationship between the Christian faith
and history is the central problem of modern the¬
ology. Ever since the Enlightenment theologians
have tried to reconcile Christianity's long¬
standing claim to be the truth with modern
knowledge about the historical relativity of all
human experience and thought.
This enterprise has proved increasingly
difficult. In the eighteenth century, Gotthold
Lessing, a leading figure of the German Auf¬
klärung (Enlightenment), spoke of the "wide and
horrendous gulf" that lies between modern man
and Christianity in its original form. In the fol¬
lowing century this gulf became even wider.
Philosophers, theologians and historians under¬
stood that all historical reality is specific and rela¬
tive and that in history there are no absolute
norms valid for all individuals and for all periods.
But does not Christianity say that Jesus Christ
occupies an absolute position in history? Should
it not claim to be absolutely true and necessary
for everyone, irrespective of place and time? The
more thinking that has been done about the
essence of the Christian faith and the specific
nature of historical reality, the wider the gap
between faith and history has become.
Central to the Christian faith, as to all
religions, is the worship of God. In the traditional

language of Western philosophy and theology,
strongly marked by the world view of the ancient
Greeks and particularly by Aristotelian
metaphysics, God is also referred to as "the
Absolute". He is thought of as a boundless crea¬
tive power, conditioned by nothing and eternal,
the Creator of the cosmos and then of man, who
is a creature of a higher order. God the Creator
is seen as the possessor of unlimited sovereignty;
He is infinitely superior to His creatures. In
Western metaphysics the opposition between
God and the world, between transcendence and
immanence, between eternity and time, is fun¬
damental. The Absolute is absolute precisely
because the finite, the world and humanity do
not impinge upon it. Conversely, this created
world, the historical world of the finite and the
relative, is envisioned as permanently dependent
on the Absolute and as deriving its consistency
from God alone.
The more God is portrayed as transcendent,
as superior to the world, the more faith is regard¬
ed as a withdrawal from the relative, as a draw¬
ing away from history. For mankind, faith thus
consists in placing one's trust in the Absolute. But
as the Absolute is timeless, eternal, turning to
God is tantamount to turning away from the
world and setting oneself at a distance from the
finite realm.
The Christian mystics in particular believed
that when people pray they are immersed in eter¬
nity and withdraw from history, thereby becom¬
ing aware of their true, eternal purpose. Viewed
in this light, Christian piety always implies a
devaluation of history, of the world of relative
values.
The concept of history
in the early Church
It was from this standpoint that the theologians
of the early Church considered the history of hu¬
manity and Church history. They reformulated
various conceptions of God's sovereignty over
world history as found in the Jewish tradition
(the Old Testament of the Christians) and in the
Gospels and Epistles of the New Testament.
The apostle Paul thus gave a theological in¬
terpretation to history according to which there
is a close link between the creation of the world
and the redemption of humanity. In this scheme
of things Jesus Christ has a central position: He
is the absolute centre of the history of the world,
giving meaning and purpose to all human action.
Universal history began with the creative act of
God. But sin upset the divine order and the world
slid into chaos, as demonstrated in particular by
the historical disasters visited upon the people of
Israel and described in the Old Testament. In

Jesus Christ, a new age of salvation began. Paul
describes this salvation in historical images: it
means the abolition of natural conflict between
man and woman, the end of enmity between peo¬
ples, the liberation of slaves from servitude to
their masters and the rebirth of all human beings,
truly freed at last.
Paul's interpretation can thus be defined as
a history of salvation: all human history is
directed towards the return of Jesus Christ or the
attainment of salvation in Him. Paul has a teleo-
logical view of history: its goal is the attainment
by all human beings of the salvation already
offered by God to humanity through Christ.
For this reason, the Church in his view is at
the centre of history. It is the institution that
brings us the news of salvation in Christ.
Through its action we draw nearer to the end-
purpose of history according to God, the return
of Christ and the establishment of His universal
kingdom of peace. Seen from this standpoint, the
history of the world and the political history of
states are without importance. Only the action
of the Church is decisive for true progress
towards the kingdom of God.
The early Christians lived in the faith that
Christ would soon return and accomplish the
final salvation of history. Accordingly, the
theologians of the early Church did not at first
pay much attention to the details of Church his¬
tory. It was only through the persecution of the
Christians by the Roman empire and the subse¬
quent triumph of Christianity over the empire,
expressed symbolically by the baptism of Con-
stantine in 337 AD, that the history of the
Church became an important subject of theolog¬
ical reflection.
A first synthesis of the history of the expan¬
sion of Christianity is provided by the early
fourth-century historian and theologian Eusebius
of Caesarea, whose Ecclesiastical History is still a
document of capital importance. The way in
which Eusebius links specific events in Church
history to an all-embracing theological interpre¬
tation of universal history served for centuries as
an example for the Catholic historians of the
Church.
His interpretation was particularly decisive
in two respects. First, the history of the Church
begins with the birth and works of Jesus of
Nazareth. The whole of Jewish and non-
Christian history until then were but God's
preparation for this event essential to the salva¬
tion of humankind. The pre-Christian religions
are seen as preparing the way for the reception
of Christ's message. In fact, Christianity was not
a new religion but eternal religion, which, before
Christ, had not been wholly revealed. Judaism
and Greek religion are not considered as "foreign
religions" but as forms of an unrealized Chris¬
tianity. History before the coming of Christ is
also in this account integrated into the history
of the Church.
Secondly, Eusebius sees the history of the
world and the Church as a constant struggle be¬
tween Good and Evil, God and the Devil. The
function of history is to record the continual
struggle between the good, who remain faithful
to God and His Church, and the bad, who follow
Satan and oppose the Church. He is profoundly
convinced that God will come to the assistance
of His Church in all its struggles against external
enemies, but also and especially against heretics,
and that divine truth will prevail. The history of
the Church is seen by Eusebius as that of an ever¬
growing power, which he attributes to the greater
proximity of the kingdom of God. Church his¬
tory thus becomes the axis of universal history.
The sixteenth-century leaders of the Refor¬
mation, especially Martin Luther and John Calvin,
radically challenged the Catholic vision of the
Church as an increasingly powerful, triumphant
institution. The Reformation grew out of a move¬
ment of protest against the established Church.
Against the authority of the Pope and the priests'
dominion over souls, it invoked "a Christian's
freedom" (Luther). Human salvation lay not in
the Church but in the word of God alone, which
was accessible to everyone through the Holy
Scriptures. For the reformers, "a Christian's
freedom" meant that less value was attached to
the Church. The institution of the Church took
second place to the pious individual.
This theological restriction placed on the
Church meant at the same time that greater recog¬
nition was accorded to the intrinsic value of the
world. True Christian faith was exemplified not
in a separate pious existence, sealed off from
worldly concerns, but in the actual circumstances
of life, where human beings had been set by God.
In the eyes of the reformers, living according to
one's faith meant above all saying "yes" to the

world; it meant being actively and enthusiastically
involved in the world.
The reformers also profoundly changed
prevailing attitudes to the history of the Church.
The institution was criticized. Its history, as writ¬
ten in the sixteenth and seventeenth centuries by
Protestant historians, was intended to legitimize
and bolster the rights of Protestantism against the
authoritarian nature of the Church of Rome.
Eusebius' history of triumph was replaced by an
account of the internal decomposition of the
Church. The more powerful it had grown, the
more it had become detached from the true faith.
The distinction made by Eusebius between bear¬
ers of authority and heretics, between good Chris¬
tians and enemies of God, was overturned: in
many cases it was the ecclesiastical authorities that
were the enemies of Christ. In the history of the
Church a central role was now assigned to the
pious who had transmitted the fundamental
truths of Christianity.
Under the influence of the Reformation, the
history of the Church became a medium for a
scientific and critical appraisal of the received tra¬
dition of the Church. Not only were historians
critical of its attempted domination, but they
were also increasingly sceptical about the sources
invoked by the Church in an effort to legitimize
its power and to base the supremacy of the Pope's
authority upon that of the emperor. This criti¬
cism had an ideological colouring. The concern
was to release the ordinary Christian from a state
of false servitude vis-à-vis the Church. Through
such criticism and through intensive exegesis of
the Holy Gospels, the Protestant history of the
Church paved the way for modern historical and
critical investigation, which took root during the
Enlightenment and continued to develop in the
nineteenth century.
between Christianity and other religions. From
then on they had to interpret the history of
Christianity with reference to the universal his¬
tory of religions. What consequences does this
attitude have for Christianity's long-established
claim to possess the truth? Should not a modern
historian refute the idea that the Christian mes¬
sage is valid for all human beings?
This question was a particular source of con¬
flict in German Protestantism, starting in the
eighteenth century. Philosophers and theologians
associated with what was known as German
idealismSchleiermacher, Schelling and Hegel for

The Enlightenment marked a radical break in the
interpretation of Christianity and of its history.
During the period of European expansion, when
the pull of other countries and cultures was be¬
ing felt, Western intellectuals discovered a mul¬
tiplicity of religions and religious traditions of
which they had previously been unaware. They
had to recognize that, from the point of view of
history, Christianity was but one religion among
others. At first they continued to claim, dogmat¬
ically, that Christianity alone was the true
religion, all the others being false forms of reli¬
gious consciousness or at least incomplete
representations of the truth as compared to that
of Christianity.
However as European intellectuals became
more interested in the history of the non-
Christian religions, the more clearly they per¬
ceived numerous affinities and mutual influences

new critical approach to history by interpreting
Christianity as "the absolute religion". Chris¬
tianity was thus reincorporated into a universal
history of religions without the abandonment of
its traditional claim to hold the truth. On the one
hand, Christianity was but one religion among
others and had to be understood as a specific
historical instance of a universal phenomenon-
religion. On the other, it stood out from all the
others insofar as it was only in Christianity that the
universal goal of all religionthe reconciliation of
God and mankindhad been fully achieved.
Once a universal concept of religion had been
established, supposedly embracing all the forms
of religion that had so far emerged in the history
of humanity, these were shown to be linked to
one another in accordance with a historical
process based on the principles of evolution. The
history of religions, ranging back from primitive
religions, through natural religions all- the way
to culture-religions, was thus seen as a process
whose ultimate aim was the effective realization
of the universal essence of religion.
This evolutionist way of thinking was
widespread throughout nineteenth-century
Europe, where Christianity was regarded as the
highest form of culture-religion, like the religion
of freedom or of the personality. It was identi¬
fied, more or less directly, with the universal con¬
cept of religion. The success öf this interpretation
was due to the fact that it enabled historical and
critical account to be taken of the multiplicity
of religions without in any way renouncing
Christianity's claim to superiority. This model
could thus serve to justify Western imperialism.
Since the nineteenth century, however, the
rapid advance of knowledge in the history of
religions has put paid to the idealistic presuppo¬
sition that the course of history is determined by
an unchanging transcendental reason. The more
that historians have recognized the specificity of
individual religions, the more they have aban¬
doned attempts to understand the history of
religions as a single evolutionary process and to
encompass all religions in the same concept. The
idealistic belief in the basic oneness of the many
religions gave way to a pluralistic vision of
history in which the main focus of attention was
no longer their alleged sameness but their
individuality.
A truly critical approach to the science of his¬
tory meant then that the concept of "absolute
religion" had to be discarded as a dogmatic or,
in other words, ahistorical notion. The implica¬
tions for the Christian religion were keenly de¬
bated in the early years of this century, in Europe
and the United States.
The German theologian Ernst Troeltsch, a
liberal Protestant, played an important role in this
debate. In a famous lecture published in 1902, en¬
titled The Absoluteness of Christianity, Troeltsch
abandoned the concept of "absolute religion". He
assigned a "relative supreme value" to Christian¬
ity while recognizing that this could not be
demonstrated by a strictly historical method. He
did not dispute that Christianity claimed to
represent the truth, but for him there was only
one truth, which found expression in countless
forms of religion.

The master-chronologers
of IslamBY ABDESSELAM CHEDDADI

A he most striking feature of Islamic historical
writing or tarikh is its sheer volume. Only a small
part of it has so far been published and new texts
are continually being discovered. From the
second half of the first century of the Hegira
(late seventh ' century AD) to the thirteenth
century (nineteenth century AD) the writing of
Islamic history continued almost without a break
wherever the Islamic faith was professed. The
language used was primarily Arabic, but there
were also writings in Persian, Turkish and
Malay. Although essentially written by Muslims,
it also attracted Christian authors, especially in
Egypt and Syria.
A second important feature of Islamic histori¬
ography is its very great diversity. It comprises
forms and genres ranging from vast universal or
general histories and monographs to annals, dy¬
nastic and genealogical tables or lists divided into
tabaqat (classes), as well as biographical diction¬
aries and local histories. It also covers many fields:
religious, political, administrative and social life;
scientific, literary and artistic activities; schools
of thought and ideological trends; travel, the
topography of cities, monuments; natural dis¬
asters, famines, epidemics....
The historians who worked in this tradition
were also curious about non-Islamic civilizations,
western and northern Europe, India, China, the
Far East and Africa. They were interested in any
information relating to man, his relations with
his social and cultural environment and his rela¬
tions with God. Ibn Khaldun (see page 39) noted
that they wrote just as much for the "crowds"
and for "simple folk" as for "kings" and "the
great". This view of history as universal in scope
and the attempt to reach a wide audience
prefigured modern approaches to the subject.
A grasp
of time
A further point of similarity with modern histori¬
ography lay in the importance attached very early
on to time and to chronology. From the first to
the fourth century of the Hegira (seventh-tenth
century AD) a vast amount of knowledge about
time was amassed in Islamic culture. Drawing on
earlier Arab tradition, it incorporated Persian,
Indian, Greek and Egyptian material and also
leaned on the work of astronomers and geo¬
graphers. The masterly conspectus achieved by
al-Biruni in the first half of the fifth/eleventh cen¬
tury is impressive for its tone of objectivity. It
represents the most extensive and most rigorous
survey of knowledge about time that we possess
up to the modern era.
Muslim historians benefited greatly from this
knowledge. From the second/eighth century on¬
wards it gradually became common practice to
give dates, to follow a chronological order and
to provide tables. For most of the facts reported
by historians it became a virtually absolute rule
to note the year, month and day when they
occurred. This contrasts with medieval histori¬
ography in the West where it was not until
the eleventh century AD that a unified chrono¬
logical system began to be widely accepted and
where, as late as the fourteenth century, the
chronology of the main historical events was still
uncertain.
Originality
and limitations
The originality, but also the limitations of Islamic
historiography lie in its conception of historical
information (khabar). Khobar means the fact, the
event, as incorporated into discourse, related in
a "story". The historian does not deal in raw
facts. He starts from a given which is the story

is a Moroccan historian who
teaches at the faculty of
education sciences at Rabat.
An authority on Ibn
Khaldun, he has translated

historian's autobiography

history (Sindbad, Paris,
1987).
as reported by written or oral tradition, or by
a living witness (who may be the historian him¬
self). His most important task is therefore to
authenticate or validate stories by subjecting ac¬
counts and channels of transmission to critical
scrutiny. The historian does not seek to discover
or establish facts but to gather, classify and or¬
ganize information while making sure of its va¬
lidity. The intrinsic truth of stories was a
relatively minor concern until Ibn Khaldun, who
based historical criticism on knowledge of the
laws of 'umran (the human order, society).
Bound to accept traditional sources, often
down to the finest detail, the historian could in¬
corporate them into a wide variety of genres or
organize them at will within more or less
voluminous compilations, but he could not for¬
mulate them in his own way, reconstruct them
or recast them according to his own perspective.
In Islamic historiography then, the past is not
reconstructed as it was by some Greek histori¬
ans, nor is there any theological history as there
was in the Christian Middle Ages. This accounts
for its widely acknowledged impartiality and also
for its stationary conception of time, which con¬
tains in itself no potential for change or progress
but simply gives external order to a sequence
of events. It was Ibn Khaldun again who, in
considering the emergence, evolution and decline
of vast human groups such as the Arabs,
Berbers, Persians and the Rum (Greeks, Romans
and Byzantines) added a new dimension to this
vision.
Three major periods
The first major period of Islamic historiography,
which extends up to the third century of the
Hegiria, is crowned by at-Tabari's chronicle
Tarikh ar-Rusul wa al-Muluk (History ofProphets
and Kings) (see page 38). A calendar based on the
Hegira soon came to be adopted generally. The
isnad method, whereby the names of those who
transmitted information from generation to
generation are cited, was first developed for the
purposes of the religious sciences and then applied
to the biography of the Prophet, to stories of the
Muslim conquests and gradually to all kinds of
stories.
The earliest historical writing appeared and
sometimes crystallized in a number of genres,
including maghazi and sira (the biography and
deeds of the Prophet),^^ (Muslim conquests),
ahdath (major political events), akhbar al-awa 'il
(stories of pre-Islamic kings and nations), ayyam
al- '<zr¡2¿>_ (stories of the Arab past), ansah, ma'athir
and mathalib (genealogies, exploits and failures);
biographies of scholars, lists of teachers, politi¬
cal and administrative chronicles, history of the
Umayyad and 'Abassid dynasties, and collections
of secretaries' letters. It gradually became the
usual practice to date facts and events precisely
and to follow a chronological order.
Numerous compendiums were published,

At-Tabari
Mt TABARl (839-923) did not invent Islamic histori¬
ography but he is its most illustrious figure. His Tarikh
ar-Rusul wa al-Muluk (History of Prophets and Kings)
long served as a model. This chronicle, which relates
the history of the Islamic world year by year in the
first three centuries of the Hegira, was continued by
later authors, and many abridged versions and
adaptations were made of its account of the pre-
Islamic period. It was incorporated in other general
surveys such as Ibn al-Athir's al-Kamil (The Complete
History) in the thirteenth century AD and Ibn Kathir's
al Bidayah wa an-nihayah (The Beginning and the
End) in the following century.
At-Tabari was trained as a jurist, traditionalist and
historian. For close on thirty years he journeyed
through the cities and countries of the Middle East
in a quest for knowledge which took him to the
greatest scholars of his time. He was interested not
only in history, Qur'anic exegesis and the traditions of
the Prophet, but also in grammar, ethics, mathematics
and medicine. His fame also rests on his monumen¬
tal Tafsir, or commentary on the Qur'an.
His History, which is the culmination of a process
which can be traced back to the first century of the
Hegira, is guided by a constant concern to show how
each item of information has been passed down
through an unbroken line, which is subjected to crit¬
ical scrutiny. He applied a strict chronological order
to the raw material of history, and gave a more am¬
ple and finished form to the universal history
sketched out by ad-Dinawari in his Akhbar at-Tiwal
(The Long Stories) and by al-Ya 'qubi in his Tarikh.
At-Tabari's Tarikh ar-Rusul wa al-Muluk is
described as a history of the world from the Creation
up to the author's own time. In fact, as he explains
in his preface, it is first and foremost a history of the
relations between God and His creatures, whether
of obedience and gratitude or of rebelliousness and
revolt. Its main protagonists, after Iblis/Satan and
Adam and his sons, are the prophets and kings.
Biblical history is included, and neither Graeco-Roman
and Byzantine history nor Persian history is neglected.
It is an irreplaceable mine of information. The
author cites his sources for each fact reported and
in many cases reproduces the accounts in which they
are mentioned, thereby giving us access to early
materials that are now lost. In the words of the
historian Franz Rosenthal, at-Tabari in his History
demonstrates "the scrupulousness and untiring in¬
spiration of the theologian, the precision and love
of order of the jurist and the perspicacity of the poli¬
tician versed in law".

such as al-Waqidi's Maghazi, Ibn Ishaq's Sira, Ibn
Sa 'd's Tabaqat, ad-Dinawari's Akhbar at-tiwal, al-
Baladhuri's Ansah al-ashrai and al-Ya 'qubi's
Tarikh. Together this constituted a vast histori¬
cal literature, relatively little of which has sur¬
vived but whose existence is attested by the titles
listed in subsequent bibliographies, like Ibn an-
Nadim's Fihrist, completed in 377 of the Hegira
(998 AD).
The second period, known as the classical
period, is marked both by the accentuation of
these various tendencies with, however, some
slackening of the isnad method, and by the emer
gence of new genres. After at-Tabari, but less in¬
fluential than he, al-Masudi composed the Gold¬
en Meadows, another universalist history.
From the fourth century of the Hegira on¬
wards the writing of history became a more or
less official activity involving greater use of na¬
tional or provincial archives. This period was
notable for the work of a line of historians start¬
ing with Hassan Ibn Thabit Ibn Sinan as-Sabi and,
later, Miskawayh's Tajarib al-umam (History ofthe
Buyid Dynasty), continued in the following cen¬
tury by Abu Shuja'.

Above, page from a vellum
manuscript dated 1733 of
Ibn Khaldun's Introduction
to History.
Left, illustration from the
autobiography of Babur
(1483-1530), the founder of
the Mughal empire of
northern India.
Ibn khaldun was one of the greatest historians and
thinkers of all time. He wrote a long autobiography
thanks to which we are familiar with the details of his
life. Born in Tunis in 1 332, he came from a line of senior
government officials and scholars of Andalusian origin,
descended from ancient Yemeni Arab stock. He received
a thorough religious, literary and scientific education at
the hands of the most eminent scholars in the Maghrib.
During his adolescence Ifriqiya was conquered by the
Marinid king Abu al-Hasan, who entered Tunis in 1 348.
The following year his father and mother were carried
away by the Black Death. In 1352 he went to Fez where
he stayed for some ten years and served as private secre¬
tary to the sultan Abu Salim. But neither there nor in
Granada, to which he travelled in 1 362, nor later in Be-
jaia or Tlemcen, did he manage to lead a stable life or
to achieve his political ideal. He did however acquire
detailed knowledge of court life and the workings of the
state and observed the world of the Arab and Berber
tribes.
In 1 375, at the age of forty-three, he withdrew from
public life in order to devote himself to science. In the
castle of Ibn Salamah, near Frenda in Algeria, he wrote
the first version of the Muqaddimah (Introduction to His¬
tory). The need for more extensive documentation forced
him to leave his refuge. He returned to Tunis where he
taught and completed the first version of the Kitab al-
'Ibar, his monumental history of the world. But,
fearing the intrigues of his enemies, he left the Maghrib
for good in 1384 and settled in Egypt. In Cairo he was
given an introduction to the Mamluk ruler as-Zahir Bar-
quq and took on teaching and judicial duties, while con¬
tinuing to work on his voluminous opus. Five years before
his death in 1406, during the siege of Damascus, he met
the Mongol Timur, of whom he left a striking portrait.
Ibn Khaldun's concerns were primarily those of a
historian. Wishing to give a comprehensive account of
his age which might serve as a model for future histori¬
ans, dissatisfied with traditional methods of authenticat¬
ing and verifying facts, he formulated a theory of society
on which all his historiography was to be based. In the
Muqaddimah he laid the foundations of what would to¬
day be called anthropology. Here we can give no more
than a glimpse of the rich fund of concepts he brought
into play.
Central to his theory of society is the concept of 'um¬
ran. For lack of a more adequate term, this can be trans¬
lated as "civilization", but only if this word is stripped
of any connotation of an opposition between "ad¬
vanced" societies and "primitive" societies. A more
radical concept, based on the religious idea of the Cre¬
ation, 'umran designates the fact of human life, the hu¬
man order in general. Fundamentally equal and free,
human beings are God's creatures, and as such are the
rulers of the Earth, but they differ from one another by
virtue of their living conditions, which are themselves de¬
termined by geographic and climatic conditions. The term
also denotes the forms of social life or, in a more res¬
trictive sense, urban life with its dense concentration of
humanity, contrasting with life in mountain or desert
regions.
In 'umran Ibn Khaldun distinguishes two states,
which are at the same time the two main stages in hu¬
man evolution. Badawah, the original agro-pastoral
phase, close to nature, satisfying only the barest needs,
yields to hadarah, the complex urban stage which gives
rise to surpluses, in which society fulfils itself and achieves
its purpose. It is the fate of 'umran to oscillate in accor¬
dance with an implacable law between these two poles.
For Ibn Khaldun, mulk (power) was the basic factor
responsible for social and historical dynamics. As a source
of the highest prestige, it is the goal of all human aspi¬
ration and desire, spurring-men to action. Precarious by
nature, it passes from one group to another, from one
nation to another. As a means of distributing economic
surpluses and structuring society, it has a pivotal role in
the transition from badawah to hadarah. Around this
central principle of social life Ibn Khaldun structured his
history. In studying the Arabs and Berbers he concerned
himself with those nations that successively held pow¬
er. His narrative traces the rise of political groups from
their Bedouin status to the heights of power, and their
subsequent downfall.
These concepts tie in with many others, which in¬
clude, in the social sphere, cohesion ('asabiyah), kinship
(nasab), protection (walah, istinah), honour (nu 'ra); in
the political sphere, constraint (ikrah), coercion (Qahr),
domination (ghalab or taghallub), prestige (¡ah); and in
the economic sphere, means of subsistence (ma 'ash),
gain or profit (kasb), value (qimah) and work (a 'mal).
The concepts he employs, the laws governing the
functioning of Arab-Berber society which he identifies,
and the bird's-eye view that he provides of many aspects
of Islamic history, are still indispensable tools of anthropo¬
logical and historical research into Islamic society. Far
from being superseded, this rigorous, coherent set of
theories continues to be a mine of scientific knowledge
for modern researchers.

genre. Many works were produced, the best
known of which is al-Khatib al-Baghdadi's His¬
tory ofBaghdad. Biographical dictionaries relat¬
ing to religious and intellectual life became more
sophisticated and more numerous. They includ¬
ed lists of poets and other specialists, directories
of scholars belonging to different juridico-
religious schools, catalogues of writers and lives
of saints. In the various regions of the Islamic em¬
pire a thriving historiographical tradition thus
took root.
In the mid-fifth century of the Hegira politi¬
cal upheavals in the Islamic world were not
without an effect on historiography. A third peri¬
od began, marked by an ebb in production until
the mid-sixth century. Syria then came to the fore
for a while with historians like Ibn at-Tayyi, Ibn
Abi ad-Dam and Ibn an-Nazif, who wrote univer¬
sal histories, followed soon after by Ibn al-Athir,
the author of al-Kamil (The Complete History).
Then it was the turn of Egypt to produce major
historians such as Ibn Hajar, al-Maqrizi, al- 'Ayni,
Ibn Tighribirdi, as-Sakhawi and as-Suyuti. The
same period saw the birth in the Maghrib of Ibn
Khaldun whose pioneering work was admired in
his time but who had no successors. 39

African history finds its voice

AJVEN relatively recently, the history of black
Africa existed for non-Africans only in the form
of writings by the European conquerors. Today
it has become a discipline in its own right. No
one would now dare claim, as scholars were still
doing at the middle of this century, that although
Africa may have a past, it does not have a history
because written evidence is lacking. These scho¬
lars believed that the societies of black Africa had
no grasp of time, a "technical" incapacity which
was bound to marginalize even further a conti¬
nent which, according to Hegel, was not a histor¬
ical part of the world.
This exclusion from Judeo-Christian historic¬
ity, which, like monotheism, set itself up as the
universal norm of reason, profoundly influenced
the thinking of Western-educated African intellec¬
tuals in the 1950s and 1960s who struggled in the
name of African dignity for what they had been
expressly denied: the right to universality, and
hence the recognition of the African contribu¬
tion to humanity. A growing awareness of Afri¬
can achievements in the arts was accompanied by
a realization that the continent had a history
which implied a factual reconstruction of the
African past.
African intellectuals drew much of their in¬
spiration from the blacks of the diaspora who,
in their fight for the recognition of their own hu¬
manity, had devoted themselves to a search for
antiquities relating to blacks in the West. They
were essentially trying to establish the legitimacy
of black humanity within the concept of culture
formulated by the thinkers of the Enlightenment
on the basis of Greco-Roman and Judeo-Christian
ideas. This combat was bound to expose the fal¬
sity of the Hegelian philosophy of history.
Collecting and comparing a mass
of oral and written data
The Senegalese thinker Cheikh Anta Diop issued
a Hegelian riposte when he put forward the
theory that the origins of the West can be traced
to pharaonic Egypt, which was essentially a black
civilization. Like several other leading African in¬
tellectuals of that period, Diop was astonishingly
faithful to Hegel. The pioneers of the academic
history of black Africa, Ade Ajayi and Joseph
Ki-Zerbo, have depicted colonialism as a
"parenthesis" in African history, a kind of des¬
cent into hell which is fit only for oblivion. They
see the future of Africa as rooted in a glorious
past, traced back to pharaonic Egypt by Cheikh
Anta Diop, and to a less distant pre-colonial
period, by Ki-Zerbo and Ajayi.
The concept of négritude formulated by Aimé
Césaire and Leopold Senghor led the West and
the world at large to a recognition of black Afri¬
can cultures, in the wake of which historians set
out to demonstrate the historicity of African so¬
cieties. Tensions arose between academic histori¬
ans of Africa and those such as Cheikh Anta Diop
who had a philosophical perception of the past,
but they all believed that writing on the past
should be dovetailed into a political philosophy
for the present. Academic historians saw this
philosophy in terms of nation-states. Diop and
the historians of the diaspora dreamt of a unitary
state.
In the three decades between 1950 and 1980,
African history became established as an academic
discipline and gave privileged treatment to the
state as a historical subject. Today there are two
basic works in the field, Unesco's General Histo¬
ry ofAfrica and the Cambridge History ofAfrica.
In a single generation, academic knowledge of
Africa has become part of the story of humanity.
There has been a far-reaching effort to collect and
translate oral testimony relating to the past of
hundreds of African societies and to compare this
information with written data from Western and
Islamic cultures. As a result and thanks to the
development of archaeology, linguistics and new
technical facilities, and to the imagination and
rigour of researchers faced with the chronological
fluctuations of the oral tradition, we now pos¬
sess an immense amount of factual information
about the African past.
Good popular works have also been
produced, notably those written in French by I.
Kake and E. M'Bokolo, while Unesco is planning
to publish an abridged version of the General His¬
tory ofAfrica and to have it translated into Afri¬
can languages. However, as a general rule the
results of academic research have still not been

incorporated into the teaching of history in
Africa, a situation aggravated by the crisis of book
publishing and distribution there.
Close collaboration
between historians,
anthropologists and linguists
The use of oral traditions, while not exclusive to
African historiography, has given this form of
evidence academic legitimacy and contributed to
the development of a methodology in which the
historian Jan Vansina was and still is a pioneer.
Analysis of these traditions, right from the start,
required historians, anthropologists and linguists
to work closely together. It tended to reduce com-
partmentalization between these disciplines and
led a number of researchers to accept the an¬
thropological concept of the "ethnographic
present". The result was the creation of an ar¬
tificial division of the African past, with coloni¬
zation as the watershed. Precolonial history was
presented as the crucible of authentic African ex¬
perience and colonial history was neglected or
treated as an interlude of acculturation and domi¬
nation. From the concept of the "ethnographic
present" there also grew the idea, today no longer
current, that black Africa was a living museum
of human evolution.
The notion that oral traditions are not
worthy of attention, or even that they only ex¬
isted in the colonial period, is false and possibly
dangerous. It is akin to the equally erroneous idea
that African societies completely lost control over
their destiny during the colonial period. Such
thinking has given rise to the myth that the
urbanized African is a cultural misfit and only
the "traditional" rural African is a true African.
This and other myths have had a profound effect
on the scientific study of African history. Aca¬
demic institutions and individual scholars have
written accounts of the traditions of African states

the oldest tradition because, as the saying goes,
"Whenever an old man dies, a library dis¬
appears".
There was thus a tendency to give promi¬
nence to the documentary aspect of orally trans¬
mitted history. But efforts to legitimize oral
traditions as archival documents have obscured
the fact that they are also pieces of historical dis¬
course in their own right. West African griots or
"traditionalists" at the courts of precolonial Afri¬
can kingdoms were, above all, historians.
The 1960s saw a transformation in African
historical studies as classical methods of critical
examination of sources were adapted to the anal¬
ysis of oral data. The need to prove to a largely
sceptical world that the concept of African his¬
tory was valid won credence for the idea that the
oral mode of preserving information, provided
that the continuity of political structures guaran¬
tees its transmission, can be as faithful to the facts
as the written word.
Historians of Africa today take a strong in¬
terest in social and a recent development
intellectual history. They are paying closer atten¬
tion to "micro-history". Through their efforts
we are learning to respect and value the continu¬
ous record of the past which African societies
have always kept. Actually, Africans have been
writing their history for centuries, ever since
Islamic culture gave them the Arabic alphabet,
an instrument adopted by scholars who became
integrated into the life and culture of Sahelian
Africa.
There, as elsewhere in the continent, Africans
speak, sing, dramatize (through dance, poetry,
puppet theatre), sculpt and paint their history.
Like other peoples, they have always had a grasp
of their past. Their historical narratives which
respect the facts are set in an explanatory and
aesthetic framework which makes sense of the
past and links it to the present and the future.
In this way a useful, authentic and credible dis¬
course has come into being and found its place
in world history.
Let us accept the contribution of black "hu¬
manity" to the making of our common history.
Egypt was not only an African civilization, it was
a black civilization, as early humanity seems also
to have been. St. Augustine, like many later
scholars, belonged to the culture of a racially mixed
population. It is now possible to bring a more
balanced viewpoint to bear on African history
and the historiography of African societies.
We now know that academic history, which
until recently glorified the written word on
which it was based, is not the only valid method.
Oral history also has its own time-honoured
criteria and forms of logic for interpreting the
past. Why then should we feel obliged to value
it merely as archive material awaiting the scruti¬
ny of the modern historian?

USSR: filling in the blank spaces
iN the USSR, whole periods of Soviet and
world history alike have been entirely ignored.
The events that took place during them have not
even been falsified; they have simply been left out
of the history books. Old Bolsheviks such as
Bukharin, Zinoviev, Trotsky and many others
who were executed have been erased from the
historical record. This is why floods of biogra¬
phies are being published today. The Stalinist ver¬
sion of industrialization and the collectivization
of agriculture has been thrown into the
wastepaper basket. As a result, we have had to
do away with history examinations for want of
new textbooks. Instead of the history of the Com¬
munist Party, scientific communism and the po¬
litical economy of socialism, we are teaching the
social and political history of the twentieth
century.
New textbooks are being written. One team
is preparing a textbook entitled "Essays on the
History of the Party", while another is working
on a history of the Soviet Union. I am myself
contributing material on France, Italy, Spain,
Switzerland and Belgium to a new universal
history.
The world of historians is changing rapidly.
At one end of the spectrum you have long-
established teachers who are resisting, at least at
the intellectual level. At the other you have
young researchers, university teachers and leftists
who tend to be outside the mainstream. Then
there are those of us in the forty-five to fifty age-
group. We are trying to get things moving.
Take the French Revolution, for example.
Until five years ago, the period of the Terror was
the main focus of study. Revolution without
terror was not revolutionthat was how ter¬
rorism was justified. With the exception of
Robespierre, the leaders of the Revolution were
not studied. Last year, on the occasion of the bi-

centenary, we managed to improve matters. Some
of the gaps were filled in with the publication of
books which examine objectively all aspects of
the Revolution, and of the English and American
Revolutions. I wrote several articles in which I
made comparisons between these three revolu¬
tions and the October Revolution.
In the past many words and names, such
as "convergence", "gulag", "Academician
Sakharov" and so on, were regarded as taboo for
political rather than historical reasons. We now
talk of them freely and differing views are
expressed. The façade of uniformity has disap¬
peared and given way to diversity of opinion and
democracy. Everything has changed in the last
five years.
Naturally, there are still conservative forces
that are trying to slow down the momentum of
change but in the universityI am a university

teacherthings are changing at a tremendous
pace. We are engaged in the twofold task of
teaching and research, and university students
are pushing for change. This is a widespread
movement.
'You are historians.
It is up to you to decide.'
We are now free to publish, but this has only
been the case for the last two years, which ex¬
plains why there are no new textbooks yet. On
the other hand, floods of articles are appearing
in the daily newspapers and weeklies and in
somebut not allof the historical journals.
Some of these journals are still waiting for orders
or instructions from the Central Committee.
But the Central Committee is silent. President
Mikhail Gorbachev has said: "No orders. You
are historians. It is up to you to decide."
In order to fill the gaps in the archives, books
that were once banned must be used. In our
country, these are what are known as "special
archives", "special libraries" or "special
documentation". We are now publishing every¬
thing, absolutely everything. For instance, I have
published a major document on Trotsky and
Trotskyism in the weekly paper Smen ("Change"),
and, in a daily newspaper for secondary-school
teachers, a long illustrated article on Stolypin, the
leading reformer in the early years of the century,
who wanted to reform agriculture and was assas¬
sinated by the conservative faction. Thanks to the
photos illustrating the article, people "saw"
Stolypin for the first time.
If we are to give a true and comprehensive
historical picture, we must use all the archival and
other sources. The problem is how to overcome
the resistance of old-fashioned archivists and
hardened bureaucrats who are trying to slow the
movement down. But contrary to what is often
thought, the archives are not closed and you can
go and ask for what you need. Officially, every-

thing is accessible, even the Party archives. In fact,
our archives are now full of Americans and
Japanese. There is a major film archive near
Moscow and I can view films there all day long
without any hindrance. I have travelled abroad
freely. I have worked in archives in Italy, France
and Belgium, and this year I shall be going to the
United States.
I am not in favour of immediately writing
history that would be valid for everybody. We
need time and we have to proceed a step at a time.
To return to the French Revolution, on the
occasion of the bicentenary we published a book
in which one-third of the authors were French.
We followed the principle already adopted in the
recently published "Dictionary of Glasnost",* in
which there were two authors one Soviet and
one Frenchfor each chapter. Scientific criteria
are being applied and ideology is taking a back
seat. But how should a scientific history be writ¬
ten? Some issues have ideological implications or
political consequences.
I certainly do not regard the historian's task
as that of providing explanations but rather of
revealing everything that really happened. For the
moment it cannot be said that we have a really
scientific history. But we are moving in that direc¬
tion. When I was a student in Moscow, I did not
boast that I was in the Faculty of Arts. I even
claimed to be a future engineer or physicist. But
now the time for historians has come. We are
interviewed by Soviet and foreign television,
newspapers and radio. I must have given at least
a hundred interviews to newspapers all over the
world.
For a long time the communists elsewhere
in the world, and especially in the Third World,
were satisfied with the official version of Soviet
history. That is why they are bewildered by the
current changes. We were a model for them, the
image of the earthly paradise. That image is
false. In fact, it began to be questioned over
thirty years ago at the time of the Twentieth
Congress of the Communist Party of the Soviet
Union and Nikita S. Khrushchev's report on
Stalin. We are now open-minded, we can discuss
and we are endeavouring to present the facts.
These comrades are not used to it.
People in the communist movement are not
familiar with the plurality of ideas which in my
opinion prevailed in Lenin's time. The habit of
discussion was lost from Stalin's time onwards.
As a result, whole sectors of the population in
the Soviet Union are extremely bewildered by
the present situation. On a trip to the Soviet Far
East I found that people did not understand what
was going on in Moscow or Leningrad. Make no
mistake. It will take a long time for these things
to be understood.

Astronomical
achievements
Scientists will be busy for
many years analysing the
data sent back to Earth by
the American Voyager 2
spacecraft when it flew
close to Neptune in August
1989 after a 12-year, 4.5
billion km journey.
Voyager revealed 6 new
moons and 3 previously
unknown rings around
Neptune, the last known
outpost of the solar system
and the spacecraft's
final planetary objective
before heading out into the
galaxy. Another achievement
by American astronomers in
1989 was the discovery of
the oldest and most distant
cosmic body ever found,
a quasar about 14 billion
years old.
Climatic change and
disease
Climatic warming, which
many scientists believe is
occurring as a result of the
greenhouse effect, may
encourage the spread of
certain diseases while at the
same time affecting the
human body's ability to fight
them, according to
participants in a Conference
on Global Atmospheric
Change and Public Health
held in Washington, D.C.,
last December. One specialist
predicted that a warmer
climate may allow
disease-carrying parasites to
extend their range. Another
pointed out that ultraviolet
radiation, which increases
when the ozone layer in the
upper atmosphere is
depleted, may modify the
immune system as well as
being a cause of some forms
of cancer.
"Compassion fatigue"
Doctors, social workers and
therapists in the USA have a
new name for a condition
they say is draining their
ranks: "compassion fatigue".
"As many as 20 per cent of
caregiving professionals
suffer such burnout,"
claimed Dr. Lyle Miller, head
of the Boston Biobehavioral
Institute, at a recent
conference of US National
Associations of Social
Workers. Victims are those
who take on too heavy a
load of other people's
burdens, leaving little time or
energy for themselves. They
become disillusioned and
depressed and may develop
headaches, backaches,
irritability and other
symptoms of fatigue.
Cockroach's soft spot
Chemists at Washington
University, St. Louis, USA,
have made a discovery which
may eventually lead to the
development of new
methods of exterminating
cockroaches. Using a
technique known as nuclear
magnetic resonance imaging,
they located the point where
the chemicals which make
the insect's shell are
produced. Researchers hope
to build on the discovery by
developing an inhibiting
agent to prevent the shell
from being formed.
Karnak on computer
Using extremely powerful
computers and a programme
developed by the French
electricity board to regulate
nuclear power plants,
researchers at the Franco-
Egyptian Centre, Karnak,
have reconstituted on screen
one of the most complex
sites of ancient Egypt. The
Karnak Centre, founded in
1967, links the French
National Centre for Scientific
Research (CNRS) and the
Ministry of Foreign Affairs
with the Egyptian Antiquities
Service.
Pioneer of abstract art
A retrospective of the work
of the Czech-born artist
Frank Kupka (1871-1957),
recently held in the Museum
of Modern Art, Paris, was
made possible by loans from
the Národní Galerie in
Prague. Kupka, whose work
blends vibrant use of colour
with geometric composition,
studied in Prague, Vienna
and Paris, where he settled.
A pioneer of abstract
painting, he was one of the
first completely non-
representational artists,
producing hallucinatory
canvases like Printemps
cosmique ("Cosmic Spring").
He also illustrated The Earth
and Its Inhabitants (19 vol.,
1878-1894) by the French
geographer Elisée Reclus.
African environment
threatened
The African Development
Bank, the continent's main
lending agency, has warned
that in tropical Africa
deforestation caused by
clearing land for agriculture
is destroying some 225,000
hectares of dense and
productive forest each year.
Another 635,000 hectares of
forest are also being felled
each year for the production
of hardwood or veneers,
exposing the topsoil and
causing a shortage of
firewood. The Bank also
drew attention to the
problems of water scarcity
and polluted groundwater
from overuse of fertilizers
and pesticides, as well as to
water and air pollution in
urban areas where almost 32
per cent of Africa's
population now live.
Africa's ancient
metallurgists
Research recently carried out
by the British Museum and
the University of Toronto has
shed new light on the
bronzes from Benin which
constitute one of the finest
ancient art forms of Africa. It
has been established that
the bronzes were
manufactured locally using
copper, lead and tin.
Meanwhile, in Rwanda
(Central Africa)
archaeologists have
unearthed metal furnaces
dating back to the 8th
century, two centuries after
iron-smelting techniques are
known to have been used in
West Africa.
The frontiers of biology
Japan will initially supply 90
per cent of the funding for
the Strasbourg-based
International Human Frontier
Scientific Programme (HFSP)
which has been launched to
promote basic research into
complex mechanisms of
living organisms, in particular
brain and gene function, and
to make the results generally

OFF THE RECORD
AN ARCHIVIST'S NIGHTMARE
BY MICHEL MELOT
Intent on wresting a secret from
the real world, the hero of the film
Blow-Up repeatedly enlarges a detail
in a photograph. The title of the film
is a play on words: when the man
blows up the ¡mage, he explodes it.
Finally all that can be seen ¡s a myriad
of silver nitrate particles. In a similar
vein, the writer Jorge Luis Borges
went even further when he imagined /
a group of geographers doing their
best to produce the most accurate
possible map of their country. Ulti¬
mately this meant reproducing it
exactly as it was, on a scale of one
to one.
Although it is clear that what the
geographers project is crazy, and the
situation is so implausible that no
reader could believe for a second that
the story is true, hardly anybody
seems surprised that historians should
harbour the same Utopian ambitions.
46 According to one definition, the
purpose of modern archives is the col¬
lection, conservation and classifica¬
tion of "all the documents produced
in the functioning of an institution",
and the provision of access to them.
Imagine! The kilometre of shelf space
becomes the true yardstick of History.
Every day 5,000 different period¬
icals arrive at the French national
library, the Bibliothèque Nationale in
Paris. Nobody has ever calculated the
probability of a copy of one of these
periodicals some day being
consultedthe figures would prob¬
ably be too cruel. "Sacrilege!" cry the
librarians, thereby revealing that they
are engaged in a sacred enterprise.
And the absurd stock reply to critics
is, "Even if, there is only a chance in
a billion that a future historian might
want to consult a single one of these
documents, that document should be
preserved".
The "future historian" is the
hypocritical pretext for all our fanta¬
sies about historicity, the scapegoat
for our present anxieties. Is it really
because of this hypothetical figure
that we shoulder this impossible task,
this remorseless unending business of
collection and classification? In doing
so we enter the nightmare world of
total conservation, of History as a
kind of protected species, of the
reconstitution of Time past.
The issue is not that the quantity
of documents is growing exponential¬
ly, but what criterion should be used
to decide which ones to preserve.
After swallowing our amazement at
the legal definition of archives, so
comprehensive as to be self-
defeating, let's look at the astonish¬
ing system of legal deposit, whereby
national libraries receive, by legal
right, one free copy of each book,
periodical and other printed matter
produced in the country. . Forget
about books. They take up little space
and if, as everyone wants, a few
thousand more curators are recruited,
the problem will soon be solved.
But take posters. Every advertis¬
ing poster displayed in France is sub¬
ject to legal deposit. Consider just
those that are featured nationwide.
Since they are produced in large for¬
mat, they generally arrive at the Bib¬
liothèque Nationale in sixteen pieces,
each one folded in four. Vast quan¬
tities of them are delivered and no¬
body even bothers to unfold them
any more, which is just as well since
they would be sure to get damaged
owing to the poor quality of the
paper. But even if these posters were
catalogued, it would be impossible to
give the public access to them (what
kind of table or shelving would be
needed to lay out flat a poster meant
to be seen on the side of a building?)
and, in any case, the paper on which
]]>

they are printed is perishable. As a
result, they are condemned to remain
in their folded state until they
decompose.
And yet the posters pile up at the
Bibliothèque Nationale. I know. I have
piled them myself, meticulously and
with a heavy heart, often wondering
why I was doing it. I have been
haunted by another nightmare
that the man was openly infringing
copyright law, I wondered whether
his customers should not be com¬
pelled to go and deposit copies of
their shirts at the national library,
which happened to be just round the
corner.
I don't intend to ignore the
problem of the preservation of soft¬
ware. You may think that nothing is
keeping records for historians is only
an excuse to justify our mania for
conservation, what possible use can
be found for these heaps of objects?
Here again the answer is simpler
than it might appear. There are only
two reasons why most people visit
the public record office. They go
there either to consult the register of
births, marriages and deaths in order
image: why not collect advertise¬
ments painted directly on walls,
moulded in polystyrene or printed on
sheet metal? Why only posters? The
answer is simple. You can fold
posters in four and pile them up, but
you can't do that with sheet metal.
Admittedly, that's all you can do with
posters, but at least you've done your
best.
Please don't think I'm exagger¬
ating, or making fun of French
officialdom. I have visited the Lenin
Library, the Library of Congress and
the National Diet Library in Tokyo and
everywhere I have asked: "What do
you do with your posters?" And
everywhere I have been given the
same answer: "We pile them up."
When we have solved the
problem of posters and photographs,
what about photocopies and desktop
publishing? The other day I came
across a street trader who was selling
phials of a liquid that could transfer
any printed ¡mage (especially scenes
from comic strips) onto any surface
(especially T-shirts). Besides noting
simpler to file than magnetic tape or
floppy disks. Quite true. However, as
well as the floppy disks you really
should preserve the computer on
which they can be used. There ¡s an
unfortunate tendency for computer
hardware to be superseded very
quickly. Why not change the law on
legal deposit so as to make it com¬
pulsory for computer manufacturers
to deposit all their models and keep
them in working order forever?
And what about the new tech¬
nologies? What about digital photo¬
graphs that are transmitted
electronically, and fourth-generation
printers whose typographical skills are
part of the program that directs the
laser beam?
Why this madness? There must
be a patch of firm ground some¬
where in this morass. Let us, for ex¬
ample, ask what we actually do
preserve, since clearly we do not
preserve everything. The answer is
that we preserve only objects. Any
object is liable to be preserved and
only objects can be preserved. Since
to determine kinship, or to consult
the land register in order to deter¬
mine ownership. Only archives of this
kind seem to have much importance
in the life of the community. This is
proved by the fact that, when revo¬
lutions break out, one of the first
things revolutionaries do is go to the
record office to burn property deeds.
Between revolutions, the archives
that remain interest few but
historians.
How did the "utilitarian" func¬
tion of conservation, which explains
the revolutionaries' love of bonfires,
yield to a sacred or "cultural" func¬
tion in the service of historiography?
The origin of the idea of preserv¬
ing objects can be traced back to the
worship of relics, to the regalia which
attested to the legitimacy of royal
power, and to property deeds in
general. Have objects become the
"regalia" of a society that produces
objects, a new form of relic adapted
to democratic market economies
which find an overall legitimation in
these symbolic tokens? Believing that
our survival hinges on the production
of objects, which we have made the
basis of our community life, we pre¬
tend to believe that our knowledge
also hinges on them. This accounts
for the religious fear inspired by the
idea that they might be allowed to
disappear, suggesting a kind of an¬
cestor worship in which catalogues
and inventories serve as the litany.
I have become aware that the
passion for conservation is growing.
Far from declining into insignificance
as it has become more and more
ridiculous and frenzied, the conser¬
vation principle has on the contrary
gained in strength, as can be seen in
the burgeoning of ecomuseums and
nature parks, the use made of private
archives, the protection of sites and
entire cities and the growth of mu¬
seums of every kind. The amount of
satisfaction that this has generated
is proportional to the regret ex¬
pressed at the wholesale destruction
of other objects, due not so much to
wars as to rampant urbanization, the
industrialization of rural areas, the re¬
allocation of land, the building of
motorways, the harnessing of energy
sources, and so on.
In other words we seem to be
gaining on the roundabouts what we
are losing on the swings. We worship
and wish to preserve some objects,
just as we destroy for economic rea¬
sons other objects which themselves
tend to destroy landscapes, ways of
life and beliefs. The life cycle of ob¬
jects is becoming shorter with the in¬
creasingly rapid rotation of stocks,
which is designed to encourage con¬
sumption. Some believe that the life¬
span of a hundred-storey skyscraper
should not exceed ten years. How
can we accept this built-in obsoles¬
cence when we take such extrava¬
gant measures to preserve an old
mantelpiece for posterity?

T
IN THE FOOTSTEPS OF TAHA HUSSEIN
BY CHARBEL DAGHER
On
48
FNE day, not long ago, I stood
with Moenis outside a Left Bank Paris
hotel just off the Boulevard Saint-
Michel. It was the centenary year of
the birth of Moenis' father, Taha
Hussein, one of the pioneers of
modern Arabic literature. We were
retracing the footsteps of the great
Egyptian writer, who had lived in
Paris in the early years of the century.
First stop was the Hôtel Beauvoir,
where Taha Hussein had stayed dur¬
ing his student days.
I asked Moenis to pose so that
I could photograph him in front of
each of the two windows which flank
the door of the hotel. How, I won¬
dered, could we capture an ¡mage of
the man who had lived there in those
far-off days? Imagine my surprise
later, when the photos had been de¬
veloped and I saw that someone had
written the three letters TAH on the
wall of the hotel, while elsewhere in
the photo the elongated shadow of
the bespectacled face of his son
seemed to be another hint that the
memory of the young student had
not entirely faded.
But before beginning our stroll
through Paris in search of Taha
Hussein let us first make a detour via
Montpellier, where he arrived with a
bursary from the Egyptian govern¬
ment shortly before the First World
War. Why Montpellier? I wondered.
"Perhaps because it was a
provincial city," Moenis suggested,
"and the students might have had
less to distract them from their work
there than in Paris. Perhaps someone
thought that Egyptian students
would feel more at home in Mont¬
pellier than in Paris because it was
nearer to the Mediterranean. I never
asked him. My father was trying to
improve his French. He had already
learned the rudiments of the lan¬
guage at the University of Cairo,
where there was some kind of a
course in French studies."
It was in Montpellier during the
First World War that Taha Hussein
met Suzanne Brisseau, whose family
had moved there from Paris to escape
the bombing. Suzanne had been
preparing to take the entrance exam
for the prestigious École Normale
Supérieure de Jeunes Filles, then
located in the Paris suburb of
Sèvres, but had had to interrupt her
studies when the family moved to
Montpellier.
"Since my father was blind,"
Moenis went on as we stood outside
the Hôtel Beauvoir, "he needed
someone to help him with his French
and to read to him. So he put an
advertisement in a local paper.
Suzanne applied for the job.
However, she did more than read to
him. She accompanied him to his
lectures at the Montpellier Arts
Faculty, and later, when they were
both in Paris, she would walk hand
in hand with him from his lodgings
to the Sorbonne."
Moenis and I set off along the
route the young couple had taken all
those years ago. A few metres off the
Boulevard Saint-Michel, they often
stopped in front of a statue honour¬
ing two nineteenth-century chemists,
, Pierre-Joseph Pelletier and Joseph
Bienaimé Caventou, who had done
pioneering work in the struggle
against tropical diseases. Today the
bronze statue has disappeared but a
stone monument is still there,
adorned with medallions honouring
the two scientists. The route they
took passes by what is now the
Egyptian Cultural Centre.
Taha Hussein and Suzanne
Brisseau wished to marry. As we con¬
tinued our stroll, Moenis described
the obstacles to the match and the
surprising way in which they were
overcome.
"My mother's family was horri¬
fied," he said, "at the thought that
their daughter should marry an Egyp¬
tian student who was not only poor
and Muslim but blind as well. My
mother refused to yield. It was one
of her uncles, a priest who was
extremely intelligent and highly cul¬
tivated, who took the decisive step.
At my grandmother's request he
asked for an hour alone with my
father. They went for a walk, my
great-uncle holding my father's arm,
and talked of this and that. When
they returned, the priest said to his
sister: 'Don't worry! Instead of oppos¬
ing this marriage I think you should
be delighted. This young man is a
genius.' Suzanne already knew this.
They were married on 2 August
1917."
Within five years, the student
with dark glasses had won a
bachelor's degree and a higher
diploma (on Tacitus), passed the
highly competitive agrégation exami¬
nation for university teachers and
been awarded a doctorate for his
work on the fourteenth-century
Arab historian Ibn Khaldun. He
had mastered Greek and Latin.
Taha Hussein professed a boundless
admiration for his two teachers,
the distinguished Hellenist Gustave
Bloch and the historian Charles
Selgnobos. He also attended lectures
by Henri Bergson at the Collège de
France, by the sociologist Lucien
Lévy-Bruhl and the Orientalist Louis
Massignon, for whom he had great
respect.
He met Louis Aragon, Jules
Romains and above all André Gide.
His first encounter with Gide took
place in Cairo just after the war and
initiated a correspondence between
the two writers. Their admiration was
mutual: Hussein translated Gide's
Prométhée mal enchaîné (1 899) and
Thésée (1 946) into Arabic, while Gide
wrote a preface for the French trans¬
lation of Taha Hussein's great auto¬
biographical novel al-Ayyam ("The
Days").
But of all the French writers he
knew, it was Etiemble with whom he
had the longest and deepest relation¬
ship. When he was Rector of the
University of Alexandria in the early
]]>

<![CDATA[
1940s, Taha Hussein asked Etiemble,
then in the United States, to head the
university's department of French
studies. Etiemble arrived in Egypt in
1944 and stayed four years. They
remained close friends until Taha
Hussein's death in 1973.
After returning to Egypt to
become a university teacher, a
famous writer, and a government
minister, Taha Hussein often visited
France Paris, or for holidays in the
Alps, the Massif Central or the
Pyrenees.
"He loved France dearly. He
loved the French mind, not the
earthy, gaulish side. The verve of the
chansonniers and their political allu¬
sions amused him. I often went with
him to a bistrot for a drink and he
delighted in listening to the talk going
on around him. He had a marvellous
sense of fun and was easily moved
to laughter. He had a typically Egyp¬
tian laugh! At home we always spoke
French. My mother never really
learned Arabic. She spoke it suffi¬
ciently well to go shopping and to
handle the situations of everyday life.
I think my father was happy to speak
French at home. He wrote articles
and lectures in French, but less from
personal inclination than in response
to requests. Arabic was the language
in which he thought and felt. It was
only later that he transferred his ideas
and feelings into other languages."
Like Hussein Fawzi (1905-1988),
whose wife, also French, kept an
antique shop in Paris, like Kamel
Hussein and Tawfiq al-Hakim, and
like many other less illustrious Egyp¬
tian intellectuals, Taha Hussein fol¬
lowed the path opened by Tahtawi
(1 80 1 -1 873), the writer who came to
France to study in 1 830, one of the
first Egyptians to do so.
In Egypt, then under British
domination, the cultural ¡deal was
French. Taha Hussein took inspiration
from this ideal, notably by developing
Sainte-Beuve's critical method and
the art of the short novel as practised
by Maupassant. This profoundly non¬
conformist man turned his blindness
and humble social origins to good
account. For him, writing was a form
of self-fulfilment.
But this special link with a
country and its culture almost came
to an end in 1956. Taha Hussein
never forgave the French for their
military intervention at Suez. Not that
his political opinions were naive or
simplistic. He had always been an
uncompromising critic of French
colonialism. But invading Egypt was
for him unpardonable.
"Let's stop there, if you don't
mind," Moenis said suddenly.
"There's always a certain complicity
between a father and his daughter,
between a mother and her son. We
were no exception. My father loved
me very much, I know. There was
never any conflict between us. There
might have been one had I aspired
to play a role in Arab literature. But
I have never claimed to be able to
write in Arabic, especially since my
father was a man named Taha
Hussein."
The last rays of the setting sun
bathed the city. The fading colours
spread out like an artist's palette, in
contrasts of light and shade.
Our walk was over.
The three volumes that comprise Taha
Hussein's autobiography have been
translated into English as:

Paxton. Heinemann Educational, London/

U
HOW YOUNG PEOPLE SEE UNESCO TODAY
Thirty young people
from twenty-three
countries took part in a
seminar on Unesco and
its work held at
Unesco's Paris HQ from
2 to 13 October 1989
(see box page 50).
We publish here
extracts from a letter
which they wrote
to the Director-General
of Unesco,
Mr. Federico Mayor. TV^
These two weeks have given us
the chance to learn much about
Unesco. There is no doubt that our
work in the different youth organi¬
zations to which we belong will
benefit greatly. At the end of this
seminar we should like to draw in
broad outline our picture of Unesco
as it is today.
An intergovernmental organiza¬
tion. By definition, Unesco brings
together a large number of states
and provides a forum for dialogue
and the exchange of ideas and infor¬
mation with a view to carrying
out the objectives defined in its
Constitution. But inherent in the very
diversity of Unesco's objectives and
constituency there is a risk that a
bureaucracy may emerge and come
between the different parties
involved. We feel that there is the
danger of a breakdown in commu¬
nication between the populations of
the member states and the Unesco
secretariat. We therefore think it
essential that the Organization should
maintain close contact with its grass
roots.
Neutrality. Unesco cannot intervene
directly in the affairs of member
states in order to achieve its aims. But
we feel that this neutrality should not
prevent the Organization from pro¬
testing when it is evident that the
¡deals which it defends are not being
respected by a member state. To
maintain its credibility, particularly in
the eyes of oppressed populations,
Unesco must continue to point the
way towards a just and humane
society, independent of the vicissi¬
tudes of world politics.
The commitment of member
states. The resolutions taken within
Unesco do not always seem to be ap¬
plied by member states. We should
like to see the member states as
enthusiastic and involved as the 49
]]>

Unesco secretariat, and especially
that they should be active in the
promotion and teaching of human
rights. We should like a more effec¬
tive follow-up and a more stringent
evaluation of the action taken by
member states in connection with
programmes drawn up by Unesco
experts.
A very ambitious programme. An
extremely wide range of tasks is as¬
signed to Unesco by its Constitution
and the Organization's programmes
are very comprehensive. There is a
danger that resources will be spread
too thinly. Some of us would prefer
Unesco to concentrate its efforts
more, while others think that all
Unesco's tasks are important and that
none should be abandoned. In any
case greater efficiency should be
sought, for example by strengthening
co-operation with non-governmental
organizations, a potential source of
energy which is far from negligible.
Youth. Unesco is an international
organization which gives a hearing to
young people. But most young
people are unaware of the existence
of an international secretariat which
is interested in their activities. We
should like young people of all
countries to have access to more
information about those Unesco
activities which concern them. We
should also like to see regular con¬
tact between Unesco and young
people. Finally, we should like to
see the development of structures
within which young people can take
part ¡n regional, national and inter¬
national activities. Unesco should
encourage the development of a
social conscience among young
people of all countries, so that they
will consider themselves to be citizens
of the world.
Information. Unesco has a very
important role to play in the dissemi¬
nation of information. We should like
to see a greater media coverage of
Unesco's many activities so as to
familiarize the public with the ideals
of the Organization. This public infor¬
mation effort should be carried out
both in the developing countries and
in the industrialized countries, as the
latter seem to us to be relatively
unaware of Unesco and its work. We
also feel that the wealth of documen¬
tation produced by Unesco experts
could be more widely distributed.
People in all parts of the world should
have access to it.
Finally, we realize that carrying
out such a complex task is bound
to be difficult. However, we believe
that the task is worthwhile and
full of promise. We all believe in
it and undertake to further it through
our work with the young people
whom we represent. We wish to
assure you that we sincerely appreci¬
ate the opportunity to take part
in this seminar, and should like to
thank all the Unesco staff who have
given us a warm and friendly
welcome.

The way ahead together
The young people who attended the seminar are youth leaders, members of Unesco Clubs,
or participants in Unesco's Associated Schools Project, or in youth activities within the National
Commissions for Unesco. They came from 23 countries: (Europe) Belgium,
Bulgaria, Denmark, France, Fed. Rep. of Germany, Greece, Italy, Poland, Portugal, Spain,
Switzerland, USSR, Yugoslavia; (Africa) Benin, Burkina Faso, Senegal, Togo, Uganda, Zaire;
(Latin America) Colombia, Haiti, Uruguay; (Arab states) Tunisia.
Unesco Clubs
are groups of people of all
ages and from a variety of
professional backgrounds who
share Unesco's ¡deals,
endeavour to make them
known, and associate
themselves with Unesco by
taking part in activities inspired
by the Organization's work.
The movement to which they
belong has gradually spread
throughout the world. In 1989
there were more than 3,500
Unesco Clubs in over 100
countries.

Unesco's Associated
Schools Project
aims to promote international
co-operation and peace, human
rights and fundamental freedoms
through in-school education. It is
a unique and valuable
mechanism for experiment and
innovation in educating
tomorrow's citizens. The result
of a joint effort by Unesco,
National Commissions for Unesco
and ministries of education, the
Project involves teachers,
students and others who work
together to help young people
understand that, in an
interdependent world, countries
and peoples must learn to
understand each other and work
together for a better future for
humanity. In 1989, some 2,300
educational institutions in 98
countries were involved in the
Project.
National Commissions
for Unesco,
created by member states in
order to co-operate with
Unesco, are organizations of
government representatives
and various groups with an
interest in the problems of
education, science, culture and
communication. Advisory,
liaison, information and
executive bodies, they make an
important contribution to the
planning and execution of
Unesco's work. During the last
decade. National Commissions
have carried out and publicized
the results of a wide range of
studies and surveys, and have
organized many symposia and
meetings related to Unesco
programmes.
