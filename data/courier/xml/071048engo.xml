25, 000 MILES THROUGH
SOUTH-EAST AS) A
A N inspiring saga is unfolding in
South-East Asia-the story
of man's struggle against
poverty, disease and ignorance, a
hard but slowly advancing struggle
in which the United Nations and its
specialized agencies are joining
with governments and the people.
In September of last year, a mis-
sion sponsored by the U. N. left
Geneva on a 100-day expedition
through Borneo, Indonesia, Thai-
land, Malaya, the sub-continent of
India, and Afghanistan to record, in
words and pictures, something of
this collective effort in the most
densely populated area of the world.
Led by Ritchie Calder, Science
Editor of the London New Chron-
icle, the team included a radio
expert, Herbert Steinhouse, of the
Canadian Broadcasting Corporation,
who made sound recordings, and
Eric Schwab, a U. N. photographer,
together with several film camera-
men.
The expedition was originally
conceived by the World Health
Organization as an enquiry into the
fight against disease in South-East
Asia. But early in the planning
stage, it was recognized that in
regions of mass-misery"disease"
could not be merely treated as an
independent problem, since it is the
direct result of poverty, lack of food,
ignorance and social conditions
generally. These were problems
concerning the Food and Agricul-
ture Organization, Unesco, the In-
ternational Labour Organization.
and, in fact, all the other U. N.
agencies.
Ritchie Calder covered 25, 000
miles in his three-month mission,
and has written a series of articles,
as a result of his trip, to bring alive
the problems of the peoples he
visited and the United Nations'
efforts to help them.
In this issue (see page 7 and map
on centre page>, we begin publica-
tion of a selection of these articles,
with Ritchie Calder at the beginning
of his journey in the island of
Borneo (the third largest in the
world) and in Java, where he
penetrated into the jungles and
rugged mountains near Surakarta.
In the following months we shall
follow him across South-East Asia
into Thailand, the land of the
coloured pagodas, where he saw
DDT being sprayed on the walls of
the Temple of the Reclining Buddha
as an example to Buddhist house-
holders ; then to Burma, where he
visited the"milk shed"at Mandalay
-"not as flippant a pretext as it
might seem"-and found UNICEF,
ILO, FAO and government techni-
cians all at work together.
At Haldwani, India, not far from
where Jim Corbett (author of Man-
Eating Tiger of Kumaon) lived, he
heard"the throb of the tractor and
the rending crash of the bulldozer
scare the tigers and send them
deeper into the jungle"and found
WHO doctors and nurses carrying
guns on their medical rounds. Far
out in the desert of West Pakistan,
he gazed at the Lower Sind Barrage
and the blueprints for a city of
100, 000 people."I suggest it ought
to be called'Unobad', because from
the outset it will be planned and
developed with the help of U. N.
technical assistance experts,"he
wrote.
Finally, crossing the Khyber Pass,
he entered Afghanistan where he
discovered that"this country, for so
long inaccessible and jealous of
foreign intervention of any kind, is
transforming itself with internation-
al help."
Men Against Want, Men Against
Hunger, Men Against Disease, Men
Against Ignorance-all of these
Ritchie Calder witnessed in South-
East Asia in the joint efforts of
peoples, governments and the
United Nations. He has given a
clear picture of the fundamental
meaning and purpose of his mission
in a little pamphlet entitled West
Meets East, published recently by
the News Chronicle. Here is how
he saw the fundamental problems
facing the countries of South Asia :
"In order to save time, three separ-
ate research groups once prepared
three separate maps for a B. B. C.
television programme. They were
to show the zones of interest of the
World Health Organization in terms
of disease, of the Food and Agricul-
ture Organization in terms of
hunger, and Unesco in terms of
ignorance and illiteracy. The tri-
plication was unnecessary. The geo-
graphical contours of mass-disease,
of mass-hunger and of mass-ignor-
ance are identical. In South-East
Asia, containing a third of the
world population, it is no exaggera-
tion to say that four out of five
people have never known real phy-
sical well-being, have never had a
diet adequate for health, and are
illiterate. You cannot tackle one
without tackling all three. Health
is impossible without good food ;
good food is impossible without
health, and both cannot be improv-
ed without knowledge. There is,
in fact, a positive danger if the
three get out of step. If modern
medicine saves lives from disease
people may survive only to face
starvation and famine, if food pro-
duction does not keep pace.
"Every time the clock ticks there
is another mouth to be fed, mainly

jungles of Sarawak. He emerged from

and covered with sweat but foil of

in the area we are discussing. When
infants, a third of who now die,
survive to marry, the population
figure multiplies at compound inter-
est. To cope with this needs
knowledge, not only of the experts,
but of an enlightened population.
"Ridding a community of disease
is not only a medical achievement.
It is, within its scope, a social revo-
lution. In the mountains of Central
Java we went through villages where
naked toddlers cheered the UN
pennant as we passed, and shouted
merdeka (freedom). The women
smiled from their well-kept huts.
The peasants waved from the paddy
field. Even the cattle and the
animals looked sleek and well tend-
ed. We could contrast such villages
with others where ailing children,
blistered with sores, harassed the
lives of mothers whose homes
were slums, and where the peasants
laboured in pain. Here in the region
of Kulumprogo, a UN lesson has
been well taught and well learned.
In the first villages the great yaws
campaign had achieved its purpose :
in the other villages it has still to
come. But they, too, will be trans-
formed by the deliverance from
yaws, that horrid disease in which
a spirochaete, similar to that of
syphilis, is introduced through cuts
or sores.
"It is a crippling disease which
means slow death and continual
misery. In some districts three out
of five of the people, old and young,
are afflicted. It is estimated that
in Indonesia about 12, 000, 000 people
have yaws. Yet it can be cured
almost instantaneously by penicillin.
Victims who come hobbling for
treatment on the characteristic
"claw"feet of yaws (due to the
infection of the soles of barefoot
peasants) come literally hopping
and skipping a week later. Before
the Japanese occupation, Javanese
doctors were wrestling ineffectively
with the disease, using arsenicals.
After the war they had penicillin.
WHO sent in experts to help them
- first a British yaws specialist
from the West Indies, and then a
German professor, with a Chinese
woman serum expert, trained in
America. Behind them were the
resources, supplies and equipment
of Unicef, the Children's Aid Fund,
and the able help of the Indonesian
doctors and mantris (male and
female nurses). It began as a
"demonstration,"but became a mass
campaign. The teams go out into
the hills of Java and systematically
test and inoculate every case of
yaws they can and. The cam-
paign began in June 1950, and by
the end of 1951 in Java alone, over
1, 000, 000 people had been examined,
and 250, 000 yaws victims delivered
from the disease.
"It has meant 1, 500, 000 c. c. of
Unicef penicillin, which alone has
cost $225, 000. The price of victory
has so far been about $ 2 a head-
half found by Unicef and the rest
by the Indonesian Government.
Compare this figure for saving life
with the cost of killing a man in
modern battle ! Like malaria, the
control of yaws has important eco-
nomic consequences. The sick and
the cripples cannot work-and Ja-
vanese rice cultivation, on these
manmade terraces, depends entirely
on availability of hands. But the
social consequences are perhaps
even more dramatic. Instead of
grim lethargic misery, you have
lively, bright and intelligent people,
ready to fight illiteracy and im-
prove their own lot. The yaws
campaign is being extended all
over Indonesia, even into the
tribal hinterlands of Borneo, where
WHO UNICEF are using an idea
borrowed from the British Colonial
medical services in Sarawak-noat-
ing dispensaries. These are native
boats hooded over and equipped
With outboard motors, which can
penetrate the swamps and ride the
rapids of the r jungle rivers, in a
country where roads and even paths
are virtually non-existent.
"Any improvements of this kind
are valuable only when they are
acceptable. That is where Unesco
has to play its part through educa-
tion in its widest sense-not just
the ABC of literacy, but knowledge
for its own sake. In Thailand, for
example, there is a big Unesco pro-
gramme of training which will not
only reform the Thai system of edu-
cation, but will introduce into the
countryside Fundamental Education,
which means making people, even
if they are illiterate, interested in
knowledge-a pre-requisite of liter-
acy. The way of imparting this
knowledge is by interesting the
people in improving their condi-
tions of life. Through such institu-
tions as the Janita College near
Delhi, and in Ceylon, Indonesia,
Pakistan, Burma and Afghanistan,
Fundamental Education is being
encouraged. This gets right down
amongst the grass roots. It propa-
gates the kind of thing which WHO,
FAO, ILO and the other instruments
of UN want to promote-hygiene, a
willingness to change methods (like
adopting new varieties of rice in
preference to traditional ones), local
industries, including a revival of
time-honoured crafts, a new role for
women and, of course, literacy. UN
Technical Assistance in this sense
is the raft of social and economic
change."

CARICATURES SATIRIZE A CENTURY
OF TEACHING
ALTHOUGH the 19th cen-tury was certainly one
of progress in the field
of education, many men in
public office, as well as
teachers, too often forgot or
ignored the wise words of
the Swiss educator Pestalozzi
who, in the early 1800's, de-
clared :"Learning is not
worth a penny when courage
and joy are lost along the
way."
Few indeed were the chil-
dren who, in the first half of
the century at least, found
courage or joy in the class-
room, for all too often
goading and flogging was the
rule, and teaching came al-
L rarely from the heart-ways from the head, rarely fro  the heart.
For the past two months, a retrospective view
of education as it developed in France in the
century between 1805 and 1905 has been provided
by an exhibition organized in Paris by the Musée
Pedagogique. Entitled"A Century of Teaching
seen through Caricatures and Pictures,"you get
an impression at each exhibit of turning the pages
of a family album filled with relics of a strange
yet hardly distant era.
This was the century when education won its
rights. But so slowly and painfully were they
gained, and amid so much hate and hypocrisy,
that at each picture of a forbidding-faced minis-
ter or schoolmaster, visitors could hardly help
reflecting with pity on the fate of their parents
and grandparents, shown in smocks or embroi-
dered coats and wearing boots or wooden clogs,
who were once the youngsters of that era-and
also the guinea pigs of conflicting doctrines and
politics.
1805-1905. This was the century of Roman-
ticism, of growing industry, of great discoveries,
of bourgeois virtues, of the first stirrings of demo-
cracy. It was above all, in the terms of the
exhibition at the Musée Pedagogique, the century
of forgotten children who were gradually redis-
covered.
First we see various official documents, laws,
decrees, pictures of solemn, bearded faces and
by Georges Fradier
frightening or humorous drawings. But we see
nothing of the children. The children ? They
were not important then. What counted was
teaching and the clashes over political and reli-
gious questions in teaching. What counted were
the school buildings and the teaching hierarchy ;
the schoolchildren not at all.
The children were only statistics, registration
numbers or budget items. For in that century
of noble ideals it was the budget that mattered
and, perhaps more important, the administration,
the school and State reports submitted by the
schoolmasters and the government. These were
things that raised heated discussions, became
elements in the political scheming of localg vernment officials and even
shook the Chamber of De-
puties. But children had
hardly any place in this
world of grandiloquent
grown-ups.
A century of progress.
Many an educator must have
been grateful to the Musée
Pédagogique for recalling a
phase of history which, on
the whole, turned out well,
for it ended quietly in a sort
of victory for justice and
freedom. But only after a
long struggle.
The enlightened people
who, around the 1830's
preached the doctrine of
universal education, already
proclaimed by the FrenchtT.... _^...", 11.."_.... _n_rfnA nro C" ; 11'9 : 7Revolution, were generally regarded as silly
cranks. Schooling for all-what a crazy idea !
Everyone knew that small boys were needed in
the mines, young girls in the factories. Besides,
they were not taken on until they were eight or
nine years old, and were only made to work 12
hours a day. And what if they were whipped ?-
it was only for their own good !
Some years earlier, King Charles X had already
agreed to a"draft decree"which envisaged
primary instruction in France.'to inculcate in
everyone the habits of order and all the religious
and moral virtues."A dangerous road, said
many people. It'tit were followed there was no
telling where these starry-eyed Utopians and
revolutionaries might lead the country.
It was with narrow-minded thinking and
brutal frankness that the clashes first. began.
Respected, thinking people asked one another in
all seriousness :"Is it wise to educate children ?"
(they meant, of course, the children of the mass
of the people>. This was the tenor of the discus-
sions that continued for some twenty years.
In 1850, Adolphe Thiers, a cabinet minister and
a noteworthy champion off, the established order
of things, exclaimed in a moment of righteous
indignation :"I have already said, and I main-
tain, that primary education should not necessar-
ily be within the reach of all. I will even say
that education is the starting point of an easierexistence, and such an existence is not meant
for all."
Similar remarks were heard in almost every
tongue. Today, it is easier to be shocked by them
because the"Utopians"and the"'revolutionaries"
have apparently carried the day. But, in point
of fact, these professions of faith sprang from
a conception of teaching even held by many an
advocate of compulsory schooling. This concep-
tion, innocent in appearance, is perhaps not as
completely discarded even today as many believe.
It holds that the true function of public education
and the real reason for its existence is to provide
moral support for the power
in which the State incorpo-
rates and justifies itself. In
other words, the school at
the service of society ; the
child at the service of the
adult.
Whether or not they did so
consciously, the majority of
our parents cherished this
idea, and against it the
efforts of the most ardent
defenders of freedom were
often of no avail. When
Michelet was expelled from
the College de France, Dau-
mier sprang to his defence

Map showing the state of illiteracy in France in 1825. The darker tints indicate areas with highest
illiteracy rates. A census among young people at that time showed the tremendous difference
between the Meuse, a département in the north-east (26 per cent illiteracy) and Corrèze in central
France (88 per cent). The Paris area took sixth place, with 29 per cent unable to read or write.
"Wretched boy ; now look where your anarchist ideas have got
you. You shouted'down with grammar and those who teach
it !'. I regret the day you were born."Many schoolboys at
that time-1849-also had cause to regret they had been born.
"So, you knave, you don't know the names of the three sons ot King Dagobert...
tt's obvious that you know nothing about anything... Do you want to be a useless
member of society all yourlife ?" (Lithograph by Daumier in his series"Teachers
and Whipper-Snappers,"originally published in"Le Charivari"on March 3 1846.)
"Just you wait a minute. I'all give you a taste of what a schoolmaster really
does,"When Daumier produced this cartoon in 1846, the symbols of teaching
were the birch and the cane. These gradually disappeared, and discipline based
on fear and authority gave way to affection and an understanding of young minds.
When schooling for every child was considered
i
a da ngerous cranes idea...
" (Continued from previous page.)
with a biting caricature. Thanking the artist,
Michelet wrote :"I see with joy a time coming
when the goverment being the people itself and
thus becoming an educator, will surely call on your
genius."As if any government ever pretended to
be anything else but the embodiment of the
people !
At any rate, the day came when children were
accepted in schools (or ordered to go) by the
million. Then differences arose over another and
much more serious question. The new problem
was :"How should children be taught ?"and
"What should children be taught ?"
Once, a delightfully simple solution seemed
possible. Society being divided into rich and
poor, the former could be taught to shoulder
their responsibilities with dignity and the latter
shown how to earn their living usefully. The
well-to-do would become good magistrates,
officers and employers, and the poor, skilful
artizans, obedient soldiers and contented workers.
The first group, shut up in school"barracks"
whose grim atmosphere Balzac, Daudet and so
many other writers have evoked, would be fed on
a diet of Greek and Latin, grammar and rhetoric.
The rest would be taught the rudiments of
reading, writing and arithmetic together with a
few lessons on morality. All would grow up with
a developed respect for authority and imbued
with the cult of national glory.
Towards the end of the century, however, pro-
gress was made, not by combatting this cult or
feeling of respect, but by removing the most
striking inequalities, by broadening school pro-
grammes, changing teaching methods and
rewarding intelligence rather than riches, enthu-
siasm rather than docility.
Progress also opened the windows on the world
and let in the sun and the air. The expression
"the wind of freedom"was then on everyone's
lips. Gradually, the austere professor-that
dreaded civil servant-and the village teacher, so
often dominated by the mayor and other autho-
rities, disappeared and gave place to a new figure,
the educator.
Little by little, too, the true face of the child
was revealed. No more bad instincts to be
broken, no more cramming of knowledge into
young heads, no more"little beasts"to be forcibly
transformed into respectable citizens. Instead
the child came to be regarded with respect as a
human being, endowed with a personality and
character worthy of study and tender care.
Developing the child came to mean helping
rather than forcing him ; virtues were to be
guided and not imposed by severe training. In
short, the child was to be treated as an individual ;
and with this fresh psychological approach, a
new form of teaching was born.
This then was the misty dawn when the first
clumsy steps, so vividly recalled by the yellowing
papers and touching photographs of the Paris
exhibition, were taken. Experience showed to
adults that a mechanical memory is not the be-all
and end-all of intelligence. They realized too
that a little experience is worth a lot of theory.
The exhibition traces this long path : the first
geography maps, the first"object lessons,"the
first illustrated textbooks. It shows playgrounds
that no longer resembled prison courtyards,
teachers who looked less like ogres, women
teachers who braved ridicule and scandal to join
in gym classes. It also shows happy school-
children gardening or setting off on rural explo-
rations. For these, at least, the century ended
on a more idyllic note.
One after the other came laws and regulations
to define in detail the working of primary and
secondary schools, technical and professional
instruction, teachers'colleges and adult classes.
But the real and vital change was not found in
written laws. It was in mental attitude. Hence-
forth the school existed for the child ; no longer
the child for the school, elr for a social class, a
political party or a single religion.
It may be said that this revolution was still
incomplete in'1905, not only in Europe but
everywhere else. Yet the progress accomplished
in a few decades was enormous. No one would
suggest, however, that it has since been followed
up with the same faith or at the same speed.
In 1850, Victor Hugo, in a famous speech at the
Chamber of Deputies, called for"a vast plan of ;
public education provided and regulated by the
State ; for the doors of science to be thrown wide
open to all minds.""Wherever there is a mind,
wherever there is a field,"said the noted author,
"there should also be a book. There should be
no community without a school, no town without
a college, and no city without a university."
Since then many more schools have been
opened and many more books distributed. But
not"wherever there is a field"-even today.
For millions of minds"the doors of science"are
still hardly ajar. We are told that in 1952 more
than half of mankind is still illiterate. The
battle for universal education then has still to
be won. (illustrations photographed by Lei ! Larsen)

Photograph taken at the Women Teachers'Training College in Coutances in
1905, when, to join in gym classes, women teachers had to brave ridicule. In
the preceeding century pictures illustrating the education of girls were rare.
This reflected the attitude of an era when education for women was almost
completely neg ! ected. A privileged few attended private classes to learn French
grammar, water-colour painting, deportment, music and tapestry-making.
For the poorer girls there were only the charity schools or classes where nuns
taught practical needlework and the rudiments of mathematics and reading.

THE RIDDLE OF OUR ATMOSPHERE
MEN
AGAINST
DISEASE
THE atmophere enveloping
the earth is a beneficent
cloak that not only
sustains the breath of life in
man and other animals, but
provides an effective shield
against the lethal agents raining
in on our planet from outer
space. Miraculously, our atmo-
sphere abounds in the life-
giving oxygen needed for breath-
ing. Other planets, insofar as
they have an atmosphere at all,
are wrapped in choking blankets
of strange gases such as
methane or ammonia. If
breathing animals exist in such
worlds, they must have a kind
of body chemistry quite un-
known to us.
The numerous meteors that
flash brilliantly in the night
skies would be devastating and
deadly missiles were it not for
the air. These fragments of
cold stone, hurling themselves
at our planet with a hundred
times the speed of a rifle bullet,
are heated so intensely by
friction with the air that they
usually burn or vaporize com-
pletely before reaching the
earth. Of the millions that
impinge each day, only an occa-
sional one will be large enough
to survive complete disintegra-
tion. It may then
crash to earth
with spectacular
and sometimes
destructive effect.
Even more im-. ...-a... 4 al41,portant than the mechanical
protection it affords is the
optical defence that the atmo-
sphere provides. This it is able
to do because of the formation
of a gas called ozone, generated
under the action of the searing
ultra-violet rays present in sun-
light. Ordinary oxygen gas
consists of molecules, each
made up of two atoms of this
element.
Ozone molecules, on the other
hand, are transient structures,
each constituted of three oxygen
atoms. They originate in the
region from about nine to 25
miles above the earth, but would
occupy a layer hardly more than
a twelfth of an inch thick if
confined at the pressure obtain-
ing at ground level. Yet this
mere film of gas is all that
stands between us and scorching
death from the sun's rays. On
such slender threads does
terrestrial life hang.
How far upward does the
atmosphere extend, and what
is its structure and condition at
various levels ? It may be said
that except for the part directly
accessible to earthbound man,
we had very little detailed
knowledge on these questions
before the beginning of the
present century, With the
coming of the aeroplane, heights
of up to about 60, 000 feet were
finally attained. Sounding bal-
loons carrying instruments can
be sent up to more than twice
this height.
In 1898, the French meteoro-
logist de Bort described and
named two fairly well-defined
atmospheric layers or shells-
the troposphere, extending from
the surface to an altitude of
about 45, 000 feet, and then the
stratosphere upward from this
point. Nearly a quarter of a
century later, by studying the
way in which radio waves are
reflected back to earth, Kennelly
in America and Heaviside in
England recognized the exist-
ence of a still loftier region call-
ed the ionosphere, beginning
at about 50 miles and extending
perceptibly to heights as great
as perhaps 2, 000 miles.
The troposphere, the locale in
which we live out our existence,
is the tumultuous region of wind
and weather, of clouds and
storms. Nearly four-fifths of
the air near sea level is nitrogen,
and about one-fifth is oxygen.
The chemically inert gas argon
and carbon dioxide together
account for less than one per
By
Ira M. freeman
cent, while the very last
hundredth of a per cent is made
up of the other rare and inert
gases and of mere traces of
hydrogen and ozone. In addition
to these permanent members,
there are varying amounts of
water vapour, dust and bacteria.
One of the most striking
facts about the atmophere is
the rapid diminution of pressure
from height-a direct result of
the compressibility of gases
under the weight of the layers
lying above. It was the English
astronomer Halley, early in the
eighteenth century, who des-
cribed this pressure variation.
If one ascends about 17, 000 feet,
the pressure will be half its
value at sea level ; rising an
additional 17, 000 feet will bring
the pressure down to a quarter
of the initial amount, and so on.
But this smooth and simple
variation was later found to
hold only in the lower regions
of the air.
Compared with the tropo-
sphere, the stratosphere, lying
just above it is calm and
untroubled. Man himself has
been able to explore only its
very lowest layers, but quite
recently he has succeeded in
sending high altitude rockets up
through it and
even into the
ionosphere. An
occasional cloud.
the trails of me-
teors and atomic
'\u tno", nC ! 1"'r'\ ;"""'Q'Udebris left by the cosmic rays
are its only habitual visitors.
Studies of the manner in
which sounds are reflected back
to earth from the stratosphere
have given science much in-
formation about this region.
The ionosphere has been well
investigated up to heights of
about 500 miles, but there is
evidence that this outermost
region of the atmosphere
reaches perceptibly to over four
times this attitude before
abandoning its thrust into
interplanetary space. At such
heights the air must be far
more tenuous than the best
vacuum we can produce in the
laboratory.
Measurement of the manner
in which radio waves are sent
back to earth shows that there
are several layers of ionized, or
partially disrupted, atoms in the
ionosphere-hence its name.
Both the structure and the
composition of this region are
continually changing in res-
ponse to the influx of the fierce
radiation from the sun, of
cosmic rays and of electrified
atoms from outer space. In
addition, there is evidence for
the existence of violent and
tempestuous winds h a v i n g
many times the speed of the
most devastating gales ever
encountered at the earth's sur-
face.
More remarkable still is the
indication that temperatures
in the ionosphere range up to
2, 700 degrees Fahrenheit. This
does not mean, however, that
an object rising to these heights
would be burnt to a crisp.
Rather, it must be remembered
that temperature is merely a
measure of the speed of motion
of the atoms or molecules of a
substance.
Rockets now send automati-
cally to earthbound observers
radio messages of, for instance,
temperature, pressure, cosmic
ray intensity and solar radia-
tion. They can even collect
actual samples of the air at
various heights. Such data will
be valuable in answering ques-
tions concerning the origin,
structure and composition of
the atmosphere, and may
ultimately make possible the
long-range prediction of
weather conditions on earth.

IT was pitch dark and a sinister hourof night to be nosing through a
mangrove swamp. Every mangrove
root, arching high out of the water, looked
like a gargantuan spider or a petrified
octopus.
The throb of the engine startled the
wild life of the swamp. A slither and a
splash. A scurry through the branches.
The flapping of unseen wings. A cry. A
screech...
This was neither the time nor the
place to go pleasure cruising. But the
floating dispensary had an appointment to
keep. It had to be at its moorings at the
next village, in time to catch the fishermen
before they left at dawn for their fish-
traps in the delta.
No better example could be found of
the practical difficulties and resource-
fulnesss of Men Against Disease in the
heart of the equatorial jungles than these
floating dispensaries"doing their rounds."
In Sarawak and,
indeed, in the whole
of Borneo, the third
largest island in the
world, a major pro-...'"....'1.'1blem for the health authorities is com-
munications. Before medical science can
help people, it must reach them-a pro-
digious task in this island of swamp and
jungle and remote, often unexplored
uplands. There are few roads or even
paths or trails. In the whole 47, 000
square miles of the British Crown Colony
of Sarawak there are only 460 miles of
roads-and for 400 of these,"road"is
a courtesy title.
So the only practical way is by water.
And water means treacherous coastal
currents, swamp channels and jungle
rapids. This hazardous mode of travel
has made the Dyaks into redoubtable
watermen. The name Sea Dyaks (as
distinguished from the Land Dyaks) is
applied to people who live remote from
the sea, and is a reminder that the
first contact which the outside world had
with the Borneans was as head-hunting
pirates, whose skill in manoeuvring their
frail land boats far out at sea and their
addiction to chopping off heads made
them the terror of the Eastern trade
routes.
Civilization, then, must follow the
routes of barbarism and penetrate the
remote parts by water. The British
Colonial Development and Welfare Fund

river dispensaries are native perahu
(pronounced"pra-ow") powered by out-
board motors.
These 16 river dispensaries are now in
operation. They patrol fixed stretches of
the rivers at regular intervals-days,
weeks, or months-so that their
"consulting hours"and moorings become
familiar.
With a crew of three-hospital
assistant, attendant and boatman, all
Borneans-they chug their way through
the jungle swamps and up the rivers.
They have to be at their points on the
appointed days, because people come long
distances, often carrying the sick. The
sound of the outboard motor is a modern
tom-tom summoning the people from afar.
Treatments are simple : cough mixtures,
cod liver oil, stomach medicines, salves
and ointments and arsenical injections
(for yaws).
The hospital assistant does the diagnosis
and administers the
drugs, but if he
finds a condition
which requires doc-
tor's attention or

hospital treatment, the dispensary be-
comes a river ambulance to get the
patient to the nearest hospital.
The life of these Men Against Disease
is a trying and dangerous one. The
boats are cramped, and drugs and
equipment have priority over comfort.
The heat and humidity, the equatorial
sun and the steam-bath of the jungle is
my idea of hell.
And I suppose one gets used to the
sickly stenches of the tropical fishing
villages, redolent of drying and rotting
fish, and the reeking slime of the river
banks.
The dispenser does most of his
treatment on the river's edge, but often
he is summoned to the huts of the
bedridden-huts perched on stilts above
the swamp.
The dispensaries have been an unques-
tioned success. The number of people
treated the first year-36, 000-rose to
165, 000 the second. The river boat
method will be used in the B. C. G.

paign, which the Colonial Medical
Service is about to start with the help

Government with U. N. help, is the Mother
and Child Health programme. The
supplies come-from UNICEF and the
experts from WHO.
Plymouth-born Olive Warren had had
many tough assignments in her time-
with UNRRA in Italy and with IRO in
the refugee camps-but probably none
as difficult as wrestling with religious
resistances and superstition and the
primitive child-bearing practices in equa-
torial Borneo.
She and a Swiss expert in children's
diseases, Miss Hulda Wenger, started out
to train Bornean girls as hospital nurses.
UNICEF helped by providing modern
equipment for the maternity and chil-
dren's wards and dried milk.
But Miss Warren's assignment also
included arranging for trained midwives
to go into the mothers'own homes. This
was difficult, particularly among the
coastal Mohammedan Malays. They are
supposed to be nursed only by their own
"wise women,"who are paid the
traditional fee-a chicken, two sarongs
and some needles. Their practices are
crude and unhygienic.
Slowly. : lips is changing. Malay women
a ;  : coming in increasing numbers to the
ante-natal clinics and often will agree to
go into hospital to have their baby, or
accept the modern trained bedans or
midwives. But usually at the last moment
they jib, through the nagging of their
elders.
The Chinese women have no such
misgivings and Dyak women are often
prepared to make long journeys by jungle
trail and canoe to hospital. Usually this
is when they themselves realize that
things are going wrong, and whatever is
wrong is worsened by the hazards of the
journey.
The only effective answer will be the
native-born midwives.
With one of the new bedans and Miss
Warren, I went on a midwifery call. The
bedan set off on her bicycle with her
black bag, a comprehensive rncksack of
equipment designed and supplied by
UNICEF. She pedalled her tortuous way
to the stilt-house. Miss Warren and I
followed in a jeep, which we had to
abandon at somme distance and pick our
way on foot.
The house was spotless-a tribute to the
ante-natal instruction the mother had
received. The baby was born on the
bamboo floor, covered with washed gunny
bags and Chinese paper. Faces peered
through the wicker walls.
When the baby had lustily introduced
himself, he was put to bed on seven
vividly-coloured folded sarongs on the
floor. These are ritualistic. Each day
one sarong is removed until on the eighth
the infant is lying on the cane mat beside
the mother.
Its daytime cradle is a sarong folded in
a triangle, knotted at the apex and
swinging from the rafter by a rope.
Cradled in this, the baby is safe from
marauding pests.
These bedans are hardy and courageous
young girls, who with flash lamps and
hurricane lamps bring babies into the
world to the sound of bullfrogs in the
swamp, the clucking of lizards and the
screech of night prowlers. All that WHO
or UNICEF or a government can do is to
start them off. The rest is with them
- the breaking down of superstition, the
emancipation of mothers from primitive
methods which amount to a death cult,
and the persuasion and training of other
Bornean girths.
Example is the great teacher. When
the"good spirits"of modern science can
overcome the dread of"bad spirits"which
dominate the Borneans, medicine will
prevail.
It has done so in the case of leprosy
here in Sarawak. The leper in Borneo
- as everywhere-is the tragic outcast. At
the first sign of the sinister red patch, the
longhouses and villages expel the victim.
Only a few years ago, he would go never
to return. Today, lepers are going back
cured to their families.
Between Kuching, the capital of Sara-
wak, and the jungle, there is a big sign
"Rajah Sir Charles Brooke Leper
Settlement."That is about all you can
see from the road. There is no fencing,
but among the trees, alongside a pleasant
river, is a series of"villages"which,
with an administrative building, a hos-
pital block (not very big, because few
are bed cases) and two wooden dormitory
bnts, comprise the settlement.
From its beginnings in 1929, when
leprosy was still a permanent disease, this
enlightened community set out to make
the leper. feel"normal."They follow
their own trades, have their own clubs
and lead their own lives. They can marry
and have children, but the baby will be
removed from the mother at birth, before
she can infect it.
Here what even we in the West call
"miracle drugs"have worked miracles.
By using basic sulphone injections once
a week, leprosy can now be cleared up.
It cannot repair crippled limbs but it
checks the disease, heals the scars and
removes infection. As a precaution,
patients must be medically supervised for
three years and continue their treatment.
Men Against Disease are only a hand-
ful in Sarawak-just nine doctors for an
area as big as England and Wales. Local
students are coming on, and some have
been sent abroad to be trained ; but the
shortage of personnel is appalling. Yet
this little group, confronting the jungle
and its primitive superstitions, are beating
out a trail along which the people
themselves will find their own way.

MEN AGAINST IGNORANCE
RITCHIE CALDER-CONT'D.
BY THE LIGHT OF
HURRICANE LAMPS
SIGOTA GOES OFF TO
THE BAMBOO SCHOOL
If THE JUNGLE, BORNEO.
ccoT is a jungle schoolgirl, aged
twelve. She is the eldest of four
children, three girls and a baby boy,
who share house with their father, mother,
both sets of grandparents and 200 other
people.
They are Dyaks, or headhunters, except
that they do not hunt heads any more,
and are much more peaceable than the
nations who regard them as uncivilized,
and much more moral than some of those
who deplore the fact that they are pagans.
Sigota lives in the tree-tops. Her home
is a"longhouse,"built on stilts which
support a platform of bamboo slats big-
ger than a football field,, with a hut
stretching all the length-just one
long room with plaited screens of banana
leaves partly separating each family.
Maybe a longhouse may seem curious
to people outside Borneo, but a city
tenement or an American skyscraper
would seem just as curious to Sigota. It
depends upon whether you think of a
longhouse as horizontal or vertical.
Last night, I shared the same room as
Sigota and her family. I slept on a straw
mat, on the uneven floor of bamboo
stems, and after a day in the jungle I
slept soundly-once I could ignore the
stirrings in the jungle around us and the
slitherings and scratchings of miscellan-
eous reptiles and night-prowlers.
This morning Sigota and I and the rest
of the occupants of the longhouse were
wakened at dawn by a chorus of roosters
under the bed-because the village
chickens roost, and the village pigs root,
in the space between the floor and the
ground. They are the scavengers who
deal with the refuse and sewage which is
disposed of quite simply and crudely
through the slats of bamboo. One has to
forget the refinements of modern plumb-
ing in a Dyak longhouse.
But the longhouse is nevertheless kept
clean. This itself is quite a fact, for all
the water has to be carried from the river
which tumbles through a gorge some dis-
tance away through the jungle.
And that was the jungle schoolgirl's
first job-to collect the water from the
river. She had no pitcher or pail, only
a dozen bamboo bottles-just sections of
bamboo, with the knot as the bottom.
When she went down to the river her
first concern was her morning bath. This
meant plunging into the rapids in her
sarong which she kept around her and
washed at the same time as she bathed.
(Laundering is simple in equatorial Borneo
- the sarong was dry on her before she
reached home.) Then she cleaned her
teeth by rubbing them with the useful
bristles of a sliver of coconut shell.
Her own morning ablutions over, she
filled her bamboo bottles with clear run-
ning water. One bottle was leaking.
She called to a boatman who left his
canoe, ducked into the jungle, took his
heavy curved knife whetted to razor-
sharpness, and with a few deft slashes
cut another section, then stripped and
cleaned it. It did not take a minute.
Sigota filled her new bottle and strapped
it, with the others, on a rack which she
slung on her back, and with that straight
back and perfect posture that gymnastic
teachers spend laborious hours giving to
schoolgirls, she climbed back to the
longhouse.
Her mother was squatting on the floor,
fanning a charcoal brazier on which the
rice was cooking. Rice and a mess of
vegetables, spiced with chili pepper, and
a banana from a bunch just cut in the
jungle, was Sigota's breakfast, washed
down with a draught of cool, clean-tasting
juice (not yet"milk") from a young
coconut, freshly broached.
The head of her group-the longhouse
is divided into working parties-called
Sigota, who picked up her basket of rice
seed, like a small fishing creel, and joined
the party. And so did I.
We filed off, down the notched tree-
trunk which is the staircase from the
longhouse platform to the ground, and
along the jungle trail.
An old crone led the way, chewing a
ball of lime, betel-nut, and red tobacco,
which'had already blackened her teeth
and turned her mouth to an oozing, scarlet
gash. She was muttering all the way-
on gossiping terms with the spirits, who,
because she was so old, could not harm
her.
Her job was to watch the omens.
Perhaps Sigota and her lively girl-friend,
Sengos, who were walking along so de-
murely (one must not be sprightly with
sprites) were hoping that they would hear

the bukang-bird, because if they did
they would all have to turn back and
abandon the rice-planting for the day.
But no ill-omen crossed our path on
the long trek through the steaming jungle
to the rice field.
This was a patch of hill-jungle, a few
acres in area, which the villagers had
laboriously cleared by cutting down the
bigger trees and setting fire to the under-
growth and the bamboo trees. The ash
lay heavy on the untilled ground.
In the middle of the patch was an
erection of bamboo canes supporting a
thatched roof and a platform on which
was laid a variety of trinkets, a banana
leaf of food and a bottle of rice-beer.
The spirit whose shrine it was likes a
square meal and strong drink, washed
down with water from bamboo bottles.
It is one of the duties of Sigota and
Sengos to replenish these bottles, through-
out the heat of the day, with cool water.
This water is brought from a stream high
up the hill on a frail aqueduct of split
bamboo cane, supported above the ground
on crutches of branches-a simple and
satisfactory pipeline.
But the aged Mistress of Omens, ignor-
ing this permanent shrine, went to a
corner of the patch, on the edge of the
jungle, rigged up another shrine of thin
canes about three feet high and thatched
it with-green leaves. She squatted on her
haunches and laid a leaf like a green
salver on which she put some food and a
sprinkle of rice from the baskets of each
of the sowers, adding some of her own
chewed betel-nut. Then for about half
an hour she alternately scolded and ca-
joled the Rice Spirit until finally she got
some sort of assurance and signalled for
the planting to go on.

This is a daily ritual which is very
important because, if the Spirit sends the
wrong omens, if he lets the wrong kind
of snake (not neoessarily a deadly one)
stray on to the ricefield, the villagers will
abandon the patch and all the labours it
has meant.
The planting was very simple. The
men of the party went around stabbing
the ground with pointed staves and the
women and girls followed, dropping a
pinch of rice seed unerringly into each
hole. The holes were left uncovered, an
invitation to the birds (another good reason
for appeasing the Rice Spirit, under whose
jurisdiction bird-thieves come).
Sigota and Sengos, as schoolgirls will,
were giggling over some private joke (pro-
bably me !) and sprinkling rice seed.
All morning they worked in the heat of
the clearing, occasionally douching their
faces and having a drink at the spout
of the aqueduct.
When the sun was vertical in the
heavens and seemed to be focussing on
that jungle clearing with the intensity of
a watch glass, the group-leader called a
halt and we all retreated into the shadows
of the Jungle. Shadow, yes, but with
the marrow-melting humidity of a Turkish
bath.
On the way back we met Bait (Ba-eet),
a twelve-year-old schoolboy friend of
Sigota. He was also on his way home,
alone, from the rubber-tapping. Since
early morning he had been out with his
curved parang (heavy knife), carving
spiral cuts in the barks of the rubber
trees. Skilfully he had shaped each cut
into a runlet, which drained the oozing
white sap into a cup. He was carrying
back his morning's collection to pour into
shallow tins like toffee-trays in which the
sap congeals to a dough-like consistency.
Bait's afternoon work would be to roll
and knead the dough into slabs, and place
them in a press, each separated by a sheet
of cheese-cloth. The remaining moisture
is squee2Jed out, the sheets passed through
a mangle and hung on a spar to dry until
the Chinese merchants come and buy it.
The chromium-plated wrist watch on
Bait's arm and the fountain-pen in his
Dyak working dress are his share in the
rubber-boom, which has reached deep
into the jungle. For some longhouses it
has meant wealth which runs to outboard
motors for their canoes, wireless sets and
even generators for electric light. In this
longhouse I have seen a bicycl'e, although
there is not a jungle trail along which
anyone could ride it.
After her midday meal, not very differ-
ent from her breakfast, except for a slice
of pineapple which her mother had gone
out and collected gratis in the jungle,
Sigota had other duties. She looked after
her baby brother, taking him for a stroll
along the platform, with him sitting
astride her thighbone-not pickaback
but pickaside.
They relieved her younger sister who
had been sitting waving a long bamboo
cane over the rice spread out on mats to
dry. This was to keep off marauding
poultry. While Sigota swung this, the
one-year-old beside her waved a cane
three times his size, joyously shooing off
the persistent hens.
When her mother wakened from her
siesta, Sigota turned to more serious
work. She had to thresh some of last
harvest's rice, beating it until the chaff,
winnowed by the wind, dropped through
the slats (with quite a lot of rice) to feed
the poultry below. As a reward she was
given a chunk of sugar cane to chew.
When darkness fell, without even the
dimming curtain of a twilight, she was
still at work, milling the rice by rubbing
it between two heavy chunks of wood.
Schoolgirl ? Yes, Sigota is a schoolgirl.
She was working since seven this morn-
ing but at seven in the evening, with the
crescent moon just making the darkness
visible, she, together with Sengos (both
of them in bright sarongs and ornaments
in their hair), and Bait and a dozen
other"schoolchildren,"some of whom
were over 20 years old, joined a procession
of hurricane lamps and flashlamps.
They went downstairs to school which
i a thatched open hut in a clearing beyond
the longhouse.
The blackboard was lit by a hurricane
lamp which periodically dimmed out
behind a screen of moths. Each pupil
had a tiny wick lamp in front of him by
which he had to read his books and tote
his sums.
And they began to read in unison"Ay
man saw a tiger"..."I cennut towch the
top of the coconut tree"..."My father
went to mercut today."
Sigota is a star pupil. Solo she recited
"My mother is tired. I am sorry."
Proudly the teacher in white pyjamas
showed to me his certificate accrediting
Ibrahim bin Mantali, aged 45, as a tem-
porary teacher. It stated that he had
passed standard four in Malay and stan-
dard three in English.
He may not have had much schooling
himself, but he has brought literacy to
these jungle Dyaks. And Sigota and Bait
and their friends want to learn, even if it
means going to school in jungle darkness,
alive with strange sounds-including the
echoes of the A. B. C.

on his United Nations expedition
to study conditions in the coun-
tries of South-East Asia. Stars
and white lines on map mark his
route from the dense jungles of
Sarawak to the bleak mountains
and plains of Afghanistan. Here
live some 800, 000, 000 people, most
of them citizens of new nations
which have won independence
since the last war., The great
majority of the inhabitants are
poor. Most merely exist, with
no margin of food or wealth above
mere subsistence level. Not only
are they poor in respect of worldly
goods, but illiteracy is the rule
and they are often bound by tradi-
tion, custom, religion or fear to
continue living in the manner of
their ancestors. Diseases are
endemic and frequently cause
wide-spread epidemics. At each
point of his journey, however,
Ritchie Calder found the people
of this huge area awakened to
new possibilities and discovered
new evidence of the co-operation
between the Orient and the Occi-
dent which is helping to raise the
standards of living of about one-
third of the population of the world.

HUNGER
RITCHIE CALDER-CONT'D,
THE SINGING SUPRAPTOR
AND THE SONG OF PLENTY
SURAKARTA, CENTRAL JAVA.
THIS is the story of Singing Supraptor.I have to call him that, to distil.
guish him from Social Supraptor
and all the other Supraptors who have not
got first names either. Nor surnames,
because Supraptor is not a family name
but a nom de plume.
Anyway,"Singing Supraptor"suits him
very well, because his method of teaching
farmers how to improve their methods
and their crops is to sing his instructions,
and to send them away chanting choruses
about the virtues of green manure.
This is Fundamental Education in its
simplest and most colourful form, as
simple as nursery rhymes, as practical as
a farming manual (which they could not
read) and as quaint as the troubadour.
Singing Supraptor is a graduate in agri-
cultural science, but he is a man of the
people who can shed his expertise as he
can shed his jacket and puddle in the wet
paddy fields with the peasants he is trying
to help.
"You must see and hear Supraptor,"
Dr. Van der Ploeg, the FAO adviser to the
Indonesian Government insisted in the
capital, Djakarta."He is the regional offs.
cer of the Agricultural Extension Service,
but his methods are remarkable."
"Unorthodox ?" I queried.
"On the contrary-traditional,"said
Dr. Van der Ploeg.
What Supraptor has done is to return
to the elementals, as anyone concerned
with the soil should do. He uses five
tunes which (I am told) are the basis of
all Javanese music, age-old and known to
every Javanese. To these he sets words.
Some of the verses are just music hall,
getting the laughs from the audience,
like :
"The farmer of Indonesia
Is a simple-hearted chap
Who always does what the govern-
[ment tells him to do..."
(Loud guffaws and catcalls.)
Others are instructions :
"If we want the best from our soil
And a proper reward for our toil
Our rice must be planted in rows
With manure to make sure that it
[grows
We must pick the best seeds
And hoe out the weeds
- But that every good farmer
[knows."
And so he goes on, through tune after
tune, improvising and word-nirting with
his particular local audience, but always
coming back to the lesson and explaining
in recurring verses how they should
select the seed not from the barn but
from the ripening ears, and what sort
of leguminous plant they should use as
green manure.
On another occasion it may be on irri-
gation, and when and how it is best to
prepare the channels. And so on-a
simple theme which will sing in the rice-
peasant's head long after Singing Suprap-
tor has gone.
We went on his rounds with him, in the
mountains around Surakarta, visiting the
new farmers'clubs and rural extension
centres, of which there are ten in his
district. Heart-warming places they are
- bright and lively with posters, primi-
tive in terms of the subtle sophistries of
western visual aids, but"packing a
punch, because they are the sort of
things which an illiterate peasant might
himself draw in trying to express himself.
These clubs are substantial buildings,
some of them provided with American
aid, but very much the farmers'own in
initiation and continuing support. They
come there in their spare time for good
fellowship, tea-drinking and rice-eating,
and once a week they have instruction.
They hail Supraptor as an old friend.
They provide the musical accompaniment
with strange instruments, including bass-
effects from"booping"into hollow bam-
boo tubes of various sizes.
I have never seen a"class"enjoy itself
more than that collection of tea-swilling,
chorus-singing, cigar-smoking peasants in
their turbans and sarongs. And I have
never seen more attentive pupils than
those who surrounded the irrigation
expert, as he demonstrated how, by co-
operatively planning their terrace lay-outs,
each could help all.
He used a sand. table on which was
modelled the contours of their own fami-
liar countryside, and on which they could
recognize their own rice plots. He show-
ed how, by banking and grading and
proper run. off, they could husband the
water and the soil, and prevent erosion
and the heartbreak of collapsing terraces.
What he was doing was no more than
"adding-up"the centuries. of experience
which have produced those monuments
of careful farming, the Javanese rice ter
races. I say"monuments"advisedly,
because I went to Borobadour, one of the
world's wonders, in this same region.
This is a Hindu temple (a reminder of
the time when the Hindu empire reached
down through the archipelago to Bali),
where hundreds of Gautama images look
out from their niches and stupas on the
ledges of a great ornate pyramid. But
those terraces of inanimate stone did not
impress me half as much as the living
Borobadours-the terraces of growing
rice which climb the mountains. Every
foot-and sometimes the ledges are not
more than a foot wide-of soil that
can be cultivated is made to yield rice,
with ingenious water management to flood
each terrace for the wet-paddy.
Often they yield more than rice, be-
cause these thrifty, ingenious Javanese
peasants"plant"fish with the rice and
"harvest"them with the grain. As they
flood the terraces, they introduce the
fingerling, or fry. When they drain the
water off some three months later, the
fish which have been"grazing"among
the rice are about the size of a large
sardine, or pilchard-which is the size
the Javanese like. This is a vital source
of protein for peasants on a rice diet,
and Supraptor and the other Government
officials are encouraging the peasants to
increase their fish yields. They supply
hundreds of thousands of fish fry.
Here in the Surakarta regency, we have
seen something of the leaven which has
come into the social and economic life of a
hard-working peasant population, with
political freedom (which they value fer-
vently), with the health campaign (which
has lessened the crippling burden of.
disease), with the anti. illiteracy campaign,
and with a sense of urgency to improve
their low standard of life.
With Social Supraptor, I went round
social centres, clinics, adult education
schools and rehabilitation centres. The
anti-illiteracy urge-from the people
themselves-is intense. Young and old
sit together on the benches in the school-
rooms. The teachers (in a country deplor-
ably short of them) are everyone who
knows and can communicate, such as civil
servants, doctors, nurses, postal workers,
all in their time off.
Perhaps it can be summed up in the
example of a rehabilitation centre for war
wounded, of which Social Supraptor is
properly proud. There we saw limbless
men, and women, making their own arti-
ficial limbs-not peg-legs but mobile,
aluminium arms and legs carefully copied,
with newly-acquired skills, from proto-
types obtained from abroad. And they
were learning their alphabet as they
worked.
There is something inspiring in a people
who sing their own practical salvation and
in cripples who mend their bodies and
minds at the same time.

WANT
THE'GNOMES'ARE MOVtNG
A MOUNTAIN WITH BARE HANDS
JOGJAKARTA, CENTRAL JAVA.
LIKE gnomes in some weird fairy tale,copper-red bodies dug and delved
in the squelching mud at the bot-
tom of the pit or scurried like ants up
the swaying bamboo ladder, as long as
a fire-escape. The peasants of the hills
above the Progo River were constructing
a canal.
It was an incredible sight which I watch-
ed under the blistering sun until my
eyes glazed and my muscles ached in
sympathy with the back-breaking efforts
of the toilers. It was like stepping out
of the 20th century back into the remote
ages when the pyramids of Egypt were
built. In this way, with such primitive
tools, the Babylonian slaves must have
cut the Hillah Canal which diverted the
Euphrates. With such freaks of muscular
effort, the fabulous Hindu temple of Bo-
robadour must have been built.
That is no exaggeration. The Javanese
peasants are cutting a fifty mile long
canal with nothing but their own muscles,
pickaxes, mattocks and chisels. The only
contribution of the machine-age is a
couple of oil-pumps, no bigger than motor-
car engines, to check the seepage through
the dirt dam holding back the swirling
waters of the Progo, which will presently
flow through the canal. For the rest it
is just flesh and blood and primitive iron.
When they encounter rocks they do not
use dynamite because they have not got
it and because manpower is still cheaper
than explosives. So they use hammers
and chisels and wedges and chip the rock
into pieces small enough for the bearers
to carry away in their baskets. I saw a
rock two cubic yards in size being put
up to contract. The foreman put a price
of 75 roepias ($10) on its removal.
The bidder then started immediately
on a chiselling job which would take him
a week. Work which a mechanical shovel,
or a bulldozer and a few sticks of dyna-
mite could accomplish in a few days takes
hundreds of peasants months of strenuous
effort. In a year, they advanced two
miles.
But these were not Babylonian slaves.
They were free farmers working for a
greater freedom on an enterprise they
themselves had started. They wanted rice
and this is the hard way to get it. Up
here in the mountains, about 30 miles
from Jogjakarta, which was the first capi-
tal of the Indonesian Republic, life is
even harder than in the plains. Down
below there is water-rice in those impres-
sive Javanese terraces, contoured like the
seats of an arena. Up here there are
coconuts and cassava.
Rice needs water, and the Progo River
by-passes their hill-lands. Further down
the river, a Dutch plantation owner had
dammed the river and drawn off water for
his hill-station. And tantalizingly across
the river are the kind of wet. rice fields
the peasants on this side would like to
copy.
So the hill dwellers got together and
decided to cut this canal just to meet
their own local needs by bringing water
into the hills. Then the Government
took a hand. It could not give the pea-
sants equipment but it could give them
advice and a master plan, by which the
hill villagers were persuaded to make
their local irrigation scheme part of a
bigger scheme which will make the Progo
water 25, 000 acres over a wide area. Arid
so it will be. The villagers in each area,
working co-operatively, provide volun-
teers for the work, each village sending
its complement, as the work progresses
into its area. The Government has pro-
vided some permanent labour but only a
fraction. It is still primarily the peasants'
own efforts which matter.
UN Technical Assistance experts in
Indonesia had urged us to see this remark-
able undertaking, not because the United
Nations has any direct connexion with it,
but because of its significance.
The United Nations, even if asked,
which it has not been, could not mate-
rially help a project of this kind. Tech-
nical Assistance is confined to advice and
such limited material as is needed to
demonstrate that advice ; it does not
supply capital equipment. Nor can the
Government, in this case, afford to do so.
Even if it could supply the dynamite it
would have to provide the trained civil
engineers as well. So all it can do is to
give such help as it can spare and its
blessing to the peasants'efforts.
But the significance is what happens
when a community is relieved of the
disabling and discouraging burden of
mass disease, such as yaws, and with the
incentive of new-found freedom is urged
on to produce the better food it needs,
to make use of experience in new methods
of cultivation, and, at the same time, to
create the instruments of its improved
well-being, like education and the anti-
illiteracy campaigns.
The Government is giving every assis-
tance and encouragement to new move-
ments for co-operatives-credit co-ope-
ratives to find the means and producer
and marketing co-operatives to procure
supplies and sell the produce.
Just what that can mean can be mea-
sured by the age-old abuse of peasant
labour. To get seed, the peasant had to
borrow from the Chinese money-lenders.
If he borrowed a hundred roepias, he
would repay at the usurous rate of
15 roepias a month-and still be owing
the original borrowing at the end of the
year. But it did not stop there. When
the seeds had sprouted in the nursery
patch he and all his family would labour
from dawn till dark, laboriously trans-
planting it seedling by seedling. Then
when the crop was approaching ripening
in the wet fields, he would drain them.
At this point, the money-lender who
would also be the agent for the rice
merchants would come along again. He
would make an offer for the green rice,
which would be half what the harvested
rice would fetch. And since the farmer,
to meet his interest rate and feed his
family, would be in desperate need of
money, he would have to accept the offer.
Then he would have to husband and
harvest the crop for the benefit of the
money-lender.
Credit co-operatives will help him
there. The Government can help him
with improved seeds, from special breed.
ing stations and with experts on proper
management and on the way co-operatives
should be run. It has started rural
extension courses and schemes for sup-
plying cattle as a way of encouraging
farmers to improve and extend their
stocks.
All this marches alongside the other
activities-the trai'iing of social workers,
of health officers for the villages, cam-
paigns to improve nutrition and remove
disease, schools (two and sometimes three
relays of pupils a day) and adult edu-
cation.
This is new life in an old country. The
Javanese are amongst the most careful
farmers in the world. They understood
contour farming long before the words got
into textbooks. They built up these
earthworks of mud, plastered by hand.
In their flooded fields they developed
inland fisheries, the simultaneous growing
of fish and rice. Because of the value
of this in supplying badly needed protein
for peasants in other parts of the world,
the Food and Agriculture Organization
has enabled students from as far away
as the Caribbean to go to Java. And the
"professors"have been the illiterate
peasants, rendering Technical Assistance
to other countries out of age-old expe-
rience of their own.
So the"gnomes"of the Progo canal
are symbolic. They are cutting their way
into the twentieth century and, to do it,
are moving mountains with their bare
hands..
The Javanese peasants are building a 50-mile long canal
with nothing but their own muscles, pickaxes, mattocks
and chisels. When they encounter rocks they use no
dynamite, because manpower is cheaper than explosives.
Copper-red bodies scurried like ants up the swaying
bamboo ladder as long as a fire-escape. It was like
stepping back into the era when Egypt's Pyramids were
built. Only modern contribution was two oil pumps.
No load is too heavy for this Javanese peasant woman atBorobodour, Central Java. An Indonesian bird-cage vendor is on his way to the market on the island of Java.

Page I 2. MAY I 9 52 UNESCO) OUR
shelter of the valleys and fjords of Norway right
until the beginning of our present century.
From earliest time, the inhabitants of Norway
have shown a strong urge to express their
thoughts and ideas in terms of decorative art.
Undisputed master of his land for many
centuries, the Norwegian peasant was also a
skilled carpenter and woodworker. He turned
oak, birch, beech and fir into log dwellings and
farm buildings and furnished them with hand-
made objects ranging from carved furniture
to decorated beer bowls.
Peasant art was mostly a winter art, flourishing
during the cold, dark months when the home
became the centre of all family life.
The artistic development of painting, carving
and architecture, all of which are closely linked,
really began with the introduction of chimneys
into peasant houses. Until the Middle Ages, and
in some places even much later, the fire was
made in an open hearth. Before the smoke
escaped through a ljore or smokehole in the
roof, it obscured and blackened everything.
(Continued on þøge 14.)
THERE seems to be such an enormous differencein quality between the everyday household
objects we see displayed in museums and
those we actually use ourselves today. If we stop
for a moment to reflect that, before finding their
place in museum showcases, many of these
treasures were once considered little more than
ordinary objects, made and sold for common use,
we may well ask ourselves why so much beauty
and quality have gone out of the familiar objects
that surround us today.
Museum collectors comb the world in search of
the works of craftsmanship and art of old, and
painstakingly assemble them in truly magni-
ficent treasure houses for their own and future
generations to see and admire. But have we made
anything like a similar effort to bring more
beauty into our own everyday lives, into our
homes, into our cities, into our streets ? How
many of us, for example, accept with complacency
or with an apathetic shrug of the shoulder the
ghastly ugliness of our industrial suburbs ?
It is in this light of marrying art more closely
to our daily living and surroundings that I see
the peasant culture which flourished in the

The Norwegian home is like an ever-open book to which the tired peasant can
turn his mind when the daily toil is ended. The decoration of his furniture and
walls-and often of ceilings-can be compared to the illuminated manuscripts
which, in the Middle Ages, combined beauty, spiritual instruction and humour.
A BLENDING OF USEFULNESS AND ART IN EVERY OBJECT
(Continued from page/2.)'.,'-,,
Decorations therefore were limited to symbols
designed to ward off evil spirits : magic signs
or dragons'heads carved on wooden beams. On
feast days, tapestries woven by the womenfolk
were hung on the walls, relieving the drabness
of the bare wood with their variety of colours.
These tapestries, with their biblical figures or
geometrical designs, followed a traditional
technique still in use nowadays. Old Norwegian
peasant women can still be seen spinning and
dyeing the new wool and then weaving it on
antique wooden looms.
After the introduction of the chimney into the
home, the whole atmosphere of the living-room
changed. With the disappearance of smoke and
soot inside the house, the furniture and walls
began to be covered with permanent decorations.
First, symbolic geometrical designs were carved
on coffers, sideboards and beds ; then the carved
wood was covered by a simple coat of paint and
finally, as its possibilities were applied to the
reproduction of biblical or family themes, painting
became the basic element in decoration.
This is, of course, an over-simplincation since
the development did not occur simultaneously in
all parts of Norway. At Voss in western Norway,
for example, carved geometrical decorations
remained in vogue at a time when decorative
painting was being outstandingly developed in
the provinces of Telemark and Hallingdal. In
these two areas, graced with especially pictu-
resque landscapes, painting acquired a special
name, rosemaleri (rose-painting) from the use
of flower foliages as the basic motif.
The rose-painters soon became skilled crafts-
men both as housepainters and artists.
They went from farm to farm offering the
peasants their services. At times they travelled
into other provinces, where their work
influenced and enriched the existing local styles.
One of the most famous Norwegian rose-painters
was Olav Hanson of Telemark, whose works show
evidence of a sure hand, true powers of
observation and a developed sense of humour,
despite his reputation as a great drinker of
aquavit (alcohol distilled from potatoes).
Inscriptions got place of honour
AFTER the flower foliages, the subjects on doorpanels and wardrobes took the f rm f
remarkable little paintings. Borrowing from
illustrated bibles and religious pictures, the
artists painted reproductions of Old Testament
images alongside domestic scenes of feasts and
marriages. Heraldic animals also lent inspira-
tion, but the most common subject was that of a
peasant astride his horse.
The technique employed by these artists was
always very simple. Outlines were first skilfully
made with the brush and then vivid tones were
applied flat. Neither perspective nor relief was
very highly studied, and the treatment of the
subject was in general as simple as possible.
In these decorations, a place of honour was
given to inscriptions, with the lettering pro-
minently placed among flowers and arabesques.
This was especially true of the linen chest which
a bride even today traditionally receives from her
parents in rural Norway. The chest, usually an
ancient one, is repainted in bright colours, with
the bride's name and the date of her marriage
carefully inscribed inside. For many families,
dates on these bridal chests constituted a sort of
civil register.
Typical Norwegian peasant beer bowl.
It is difficult to follow the evolution of these
popular peasant styles because they intermingled
and no chronological records were kept. Never-
theless, one can distinguish two main currents.
The first is a sense of continuity in both
conception and technique springing from the
effect of the recurrent seasons on farm life. This
explains why we find prehistoric magic symbols
and Roman motifs side by side on 19th century
furniture. The second current is the slow and
late introduction of different European styles
which gradually became integrated with
Norwegian peasant art but did not destroy its
national character.
It was natural that folk art in a seafaring
country like Norway should be inspired by
souvenirs brought back from abroad by sailors.
The peasants'practice of decorating a horse's
harness with cowrie shells, which serve as money
in some parts of Africa, is one example. (See
back page cover.)
The popular rose-painter, Gunnar Anfinsen
Arekel, drew inspiration from material brought
from abroad by seamen in the early 19th century.
Arekel, who lived in the fjord of Hardanger in
South-west Norway, became a painter because he
was lame and could not work on the land. The
local pastor taught him the rudiments of drawing
and the young man eventually became nati01'''llly
known for his exquisite decorations of wedding
chests.
'--.",--.. : >-Fiance carved his proposal
THE Norwegian peasant's love for decorationexpressed itself in practically every piece
of furniture and wooden object at home.
The ancient wooden board used for ironing-
called the mangletre-was profusely decorated
and came to acquire a special symbolism as the
traditional love token of the peasant.
The mangletre-a forerunner of the modern
flat-iron-is still used as a love token in rural
Norway even today, in the same way as the Dutch
sabots, the Alpine casket and the African Bam-
bara clogs are in their own countries.
A narrow wooden board, about two feet long
with a handle in the shape of a horse, the
mangletre was (and still is), the peasant's
traditional"proposal of marriage."Before
proposing, the young nance spent long hours
patiently carving on it figured motifs, decorative
forms and lettering. Later, when in use, the flat
wooden board was rubbed against the laundry
until it was pressed. Today, hanging in the
home, the mangletre is a reminder of the
wedding day.
The Norwegian house is like an ever-open book
on whose pages the peasant can rest his eyes
and his thoughts. The decorations that brighten
the furniture, walls and often the ceilings, have
something in common with the illuminated
manuscripts of the Middle Ages which combined
beauty, spiritual teaching and the joy of colours.
Norwegian peasant art teaches a lesson of life,
going far beyond the mere study of style or
aesthetics. It is with this art, intimately linked
to everyday objects of the home and farm and
rich in symbolism, that the peasants, in spite of
their isolation, or perhaps because of it,
maintained a flourishing regional culture until it
began to lose its vigour with the growth of
industry at the start of our century.
Nowadays, art and usefulness are too often
divorced from each other. I do not of course
suggest that to bring them together we should
copy the decorative forms of Norwegian popular
art. They have spoken their language ; we should
speak our own. For there is nothing so sterile
in art as to seek to evade the present, and to
take refuge only in the past. But today our
streets are emptied of beauty to make room for
advertisements. Our homes are frequently
furnished with a thought only to material
comfort. Even our skies are used to proclaim
the virtues of this or that brand of soap,
spaghetti or tinned food. Surely, it is important
that the spiritual beauty of decorative art be
given greater meaning in our everyday lives.
