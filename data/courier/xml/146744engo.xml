After months of necessary preparation, as the Director-
General declared recently in an address to the Secrétariat,
Unesco is now moving forward, carrying out in many fields
of action. the tasks assigned to it as one of the specialised
agencies related to the United Nations.
ion addition to working in the closest co-operation with
the appointed représentatives of its 31 Member States,
relations have been established for the execution of the
programme with a certain number of non-member States,
notably, Austria, Hungary, Italy and Switzerland, which
have applied for membocship within the organisation. Both
Switzeriand and Italy have appointed officiais of their
diplomatic representations in Paris to maintain liaison
with Unesco House.
The Vatican has established in Paris an International
Catholic Co-ordination Committee to ensure liaison with
Unesco and to inform Catholic circles throughout thé. world
of its activities.
During the past, weeks, Unesco has participated in. or
has been represented at, a number of United Nations con-
ferences and activities at Lake Success. Thèse include : the
First Session of the Trusteeship Council, the Temporary
Social Welfare Committee. thé Sub-Commission on Free-
dom of Information and the Press, thé-informai Committee
on Housing and Town Planning, the Comm'sMrn on the
Status of Women, and the Drafting Committee of the Com-
mission on Human Rights.
Unesco is negotiating agreements with thc Worid Heaith
Organisation, the International Labour Organisation, the
Food and Agriculture Organisation.
An information office of the United Nations has been
established in Paris, with offices in Unesco House, to
strengthen liaison between the two bodies.
Thé Nationa ! 
Commissions
As regards National Commissions and Co-operating
bodies, the Netherlands became the seventh nation to
establish a Commission and plans are progressing for the
création of Commissions in Canada, China, Denmark, New
Zealand and TUlfkey. National Commissions, are function-
ing. 
in Brazit, Errance. Haiti, NQrwax. poláz, (J... an1...... L11e
United States.
National Co-operating Bodies for Education. Mass
Media. Muséums, Social Sciences, Arts and Libraries, and
an Inter-Departmental Committee, have been set up in the
United Kingdom in the place of a National Commission.
Pians hâve been made for active association of National
Commissions with the execution of the programme of
Unesco. Practical proposais are being worked out for each
country.
A national conference on Unesco, art, which more. than
500 Voluntary Organisations were represented. was hetd at
Philadelphia'March 24-26. under the auspices of the U. S. Na-
tional Commission, and the first U. S. régional conference,
attended by 1, 780 delegates and guests from the Rocky
Mountain and Plains States. was held at Denver. Colorado,
in. May.
Dr. Julian Huxley, the Director-General of Unesco, was
able to describe the work and importance of the Na-
tional Commissions, as well as report on the progrès of
Unesco, on his tour of ten Latin American countries during
June and early July. The Director-G'eneral had the op-
portunity to présent his views on the officiai as well as the
academic and cultural levels, and as a result of the interet
shown in the Unesco programme, fuller participation of
Latin American countries in thé forthcommg Gênerai Con-
ference at Mexico City and in Unesco work generally is
anticipated.
$72, 000, 000 Raised
The campaign for reconstruction and rehabilitation of
educational, scientific and cultural institutions in war-
devastated countries by Unesco and Co-operating gfoups is
proceeding on a wide scale. The American Commission for
International Educational Reconstruction (CIER). com-
prising 200 rational voluntary organizations, had raised
$7, 000, 000 for educational reconstruction by the end of
July and estimates contributions will have reached arouud
$100, 000, 000 by June, 1948. Reports of Unesco field teams
. rho made surveys of needs in six European nations during
the Spring and Summer are being compiled now. Mean-
time, questionnaires and letters have been sent to govern-
ments, ministries of éducation and others in the potential
recipient countries to ascertain exact needs.
There have been a number of contributions to the re-
habilitation programme and many others are in prospect.
In the limitéd space available hère, not hall can be men-
tioned. but examples are 300 sets of the EncyCiopedia
Britannica, most ot which have been distributed. 38000
post-liberation books from the French Government. 2. 000
tons of educational equipment from Canada. The Council
fo :' Education in World Citizenship has agreed to use the
JE4, 000 unspent balance of a Æ : 13, 000 fund for educational
reconstruction in collaboration, with Unesco.
A mission in London this Spring puorchased workshop
machinery and tools to be assembled in 50 complete work-
shop sets for use in construction of their own apparats
and equipment by University science faculties and technical
colleges in devastated countries.
Hytean Amazon Project
Considerable progress has been made with the Hprlean
Amazon projet. This was raised to the status of a Unesco-
wide project at the Al ? ril'meeting of the Executive Board,
and Dr. Alfredo Metraux, the social anthropologist, was
loaned by the United Nations Economic and Social Counêl1
to act as expert consultant to Uno.'Dr. Bernard Mish.-
kin'was named consultant on the educational aspects of
thé projet.

Unesco Fa ; ces Two W orlds
"
(ÉJ ? TOR'S NOTÌi :" T following isfábOndensation ol'n article 1
written'by Byron Dexter, the assistant edi, tor of Foniip ; n Affairs,
in the April issue of that American quarterly review"1t is'not given
herse as an officiai representation of Unesco. but as a rather
brilliantlll-presented vielV of Unesco as seen tram the outside.)
. 
y BYRON DEXTER
THE new. inte) national body which is known for convenience as
Unesco is a product of the widespread belief thyt ; y to he' : j 1
degree that there i-s a world community will world law be praticable"
and a world poHtical organization be effective. It is the instrument
devised to help buHd that community by working direCHy to mould
men's ideas. But in addressing itself to that apparently beneficent task,
it find. s-perhaps a litUe to its surprise-that it is dealihg with some
of the most explosive political issues now confronting statesmen and
people.
The first General Conference of the United Nations Educational,
Scientific and Cultural Organization (to Rive it its full name) was hetd.in Paris in November and December of last year and was attended by
.-..
NEWSLE1TER
c---
rj delegates of the 44 member states.
_ H selected four major, immédiate
; S, 
objectives : 1) Rehabilitation of
00 shattered cultural and educational
centers ; 2) Reduction of illiteracy ;
's 3) Revision of textbooks. and 4)
i Removal of barriers to world com-
munications 
and extension of the
nid use of the"mass media,"It also
g_ adopted a budget of $6, 000, 000 for
lS. the first year. elected a Director-
n General to serve a two-year term
to (an English scholar. Julian Hux-
, {) ley). located its permanent head-
1t quarters in Paris and chose Mexico
City as the site of the 1947 general
: i- conference. By agreement with the
) r Economic and Social Council of
11.-thé United Nations, it is officially
11-a specialized agency ouf the United
z
Nations, under Articles 57 and 63 of
g. thé Charter. And in the United
) f states, a National Commission to
) r supply a propulsive force in its
0-wor in this country has been
o formed by act of Congress. The
11. 1 new agency is a going concern.
ClearÎnc-liouse Rile
The first rote of the new organ-
ization is the relatively non-oontro-
versial one of acting as a clearing-
:).-bourse, particularly in regard to the
>. > projects of educators. As outlined
in Uneeco's constitution, it may
ici be described more or tess as an ex-
III tension of the role of the old Inter-
rational Institute of Intellectual
S-Co-operation of the League of Na-
1 tuions. A project for an exehange
y I of student feHowshipe. which might
r-I  expre. s&ed in bilateral agree-
. ments between states, is an exam-
'pte of activités of this sort.
Thé second role is new, unde-
fined. challenging, and dangerous.
. Thé door) s opened for it in
Unesco 
because it leads to the
heart of the complex forces which
represent thé 
hope of these postr
war years. as well as their dangers.
y le 
is the role which has been weil
suggested 
by Messrs. White and
Leigh in the title of a book :"Peo-
s p1es Speaking to Peoples."It is
thé one-worid idea. particulartyvivid in the imaginations of Amer-
iwans and heralded by the new
 technical devices which can be de-
scribed soberly enough as introduc-
 ing changes in communication
'comparable in importance to those
effected five centuries ago by the
invention 
of movable type. As part
s of this second function, the new
' agency ha. s the task of promoting
'thé use of the mass media in order
to induce the greatest possible de-
. grée of understanding among the
mes and women of the world.
Though numerous activities in
khis category would be implemented
j by agreements between states for
f wtfich Unesco wouid act as ctear-
j ing house. they obviously also im-
pty a different type of international
'action, 
distinguished by its ten-
dency to disregard the formai divi-
; sions of states and to cut across
national boundaries. Thé proposai
for a global network. to be operated
by thé 
new agency is an example.
f The Great Paradox
j Unesco's second major proMem..
and gréât paradox. can be put in
a few sentences. The U. S. S. R. ab-
t sented itself from the general ! con-
ference at Parla. But it was gen-
eratly accepted that the U. S. S. R.
made its views known 
through a 1
; Jugoslav observer at the conter-1
 ence ; and that spokesman turned :
inside out the premlse upon which 1
Unesco 18 founded, namely. that 1
'thé free new of ideas among men 1
in a primary ideal. The depth oft
thé gutf that séparâtes Communist)
aJ ;) d"western"vlews of free speech, j
; 
aiready very plain, wM suddenly t
a ccentuated. The QuestIon la, can J
thé eutf be bridged ? In attemptr (
ing to bridge it, may not Unesco 1
eut the world more sharp ! y tnto two J
communtties... ? (
If It was Hitler who gave the 1
League ite death blow, it WM Hit-<
1er who, in Mt-handed ïMhton.
. e made certain that the task of intel-
f lectual co-operation would be re-
d sumed with new strength and con-
' ; viction at the end of the second
 World War. Hitler paid the intel-
1-lectuals of Europe a fine complu-
e ment : he recognized them as his
 primary enemies. He and Goeb-
r bets saw clearly that teachers.
'-scientistes, men of letters-"intellec-
n tuais"or"professional men,"which-
[-ever label one prefers-first had to
t-be exterminated in the conquered
o nations before the New Order could
ici become a political possibi ! ity. Thé
e intellectuals of Europe went under-
 ground. and when those who lived
y finally emerged. it turned out, of-
d ten enough, that they were the poli
If tical leadel's of their coun tries.
d That new morale among profea-
o 1 sional men, and the clearer under-
s standing of the political power in-
n herent in cultural affairs. account
e for no lite of the drive and con-
fidence that hâve brought Unesco
into being.
Pestwar Trend Reflceted
thé 
constitution of this spécial-
- ized agency is an interesting docu-
 ment It reflects the great politicai
trend of thé postwar years, and
'reflets it in just about the propor-
tions that it seems to assume in
1 the thoughts of men and m thé
events of the day. Thé constitu-
tion is expticitty an arrangement'
 among sovereign states. And il &
something more. Vaguely, ambi-
- guously, yet with unmistakable in-
- tent and with the stirrmgs of power,
it reaches for an ordering of indt-
vidua ! s to individuals within 8
world organization in which nu.1 tional governments are secondary.
 ThiSt perhaps, is why Henri Bon-
net has eaUed Unesco"the spear-
head of thé United Nations."The
. opening and closing phrases of thé
i 
Preamble are typical :
The governments of the
5 States parties to the constit. u-
tion declare... That a peace
based exclusively upon the poli--
tincal and économic a. rrange-
ments of governments would
not be a peaee which eould
t secure thé unanimous. iastinz
and sincere support of the peo-
'pies of the world, and that thé
peace must therefore be found-
ed, if it is not to fait. upon the
intellectuel and moral colidarity
of mankind.
"Governments of Sta ! es" is writ
'large : and so is"mankind."Be-
tween stretches a vast area to be
l given meaning. 
1 A few places in which the inter-
ptay of the two approaches to world
organization is especially visible
may be noted. The General Con-
ference is composed of the"l'l'pre-
sentatives of the States Membera
of the Organization,"but it may in-
vite représentatives of international
organizations-that is to say. indi-
viduals-to attend specified ces-
sions of the Conference as ob8er-
vers. The General Conference of
sovereign-state deiegates is the
formai seat of power in the agency ;
it détermines policies, take ! l dec1-
sions on programs drawn up by
the Executive Board, and appoints
the Director-General. This is or-
thodox procedure. But from thla
body to the Executive Board and
Secrétariat-thé next instrumente
of power-is a good-sized jump. The
Executive Board of 18 is whoHy y.
board of indiY ! duals--"per80l14 com-
petent in the arts, the humanitiea,
the sciences, education and the dif-
fusion of ides and qualified by

With the arrivai of Dr. W. E.

Questionnaires employed Dy
thèse fieid teams contained ques-
tions on such subjects as quotas.
tariffs, currency restrictions and
censorship. with the view not Gnly
of ascertaining the technical ! needs
in mass communications of coun-
tries which have suffered in the
, war, but also of obtaining inform-
avion which might lead to removal
of obstacle to the free flow of in-
formation. Almost 60 per cent of
the questions concerned free flow l,
of information. There were 167
questions deaiing with) egis) ation of
thé press and news agencies in-
cluding queries on such subjects
as responsibihty for prpss offences,

- are facilitating attendance of
, scientists at international scientific
; conferences scheduled this'year.
; Aid to international scientific and
 technological organisations is one
of the main pillars of the pro-
s gramme of Unesco in the field of
. natural sciences. Of these organ-
; isations, thé-best-established and
. most effectively integrated is the
s International Council of Scientific
, 
Unions (1CSU) and the bodies
which it federates. Unesco has al-
'located provisionaHy about $250, 000
ion grants-in-aid to some twenty
l organizations affiliated to ICSU.
: This is intended to permit execu-
tion of some 140 specific projects,
including the travel of over 5
outstanding scientists to 60 im-
, portant international conferences,
- publication of around 80 reports of
'international importance and as-
distance to the rehabilitation and
'opérations of 30 intocnational la-

Are the Mveretgn strates the Lud-
ditea which will attempt to break
the machines ?
Thé Proposât !
How deeply American commer-
cial and political interests are in-
volved need not be underscored. It
was at the behëst of Americans that
the London Conference of 1945
adopted the résolution instructing
the Preparatory Commission to give
special attention to Uneseo's work
in the field of mass commu-
nications. But it is equally ap-
parent that this technologieal
revolution already touches the in-
terests of every nation in the \world.
The report of the Program Com-
mittee, adopted at Paris, propos5 :
1) The eventual establishment of a
world-wide network for radio
broadcasting and rec. eption, and
an immediate study of the question 1
with a view to submitting a prac-
ticable plan to the next General
Conference ; 2) a survey of the
press, the film and the whole range
of telecommunications and postal
services, to eliminate inadequacies
and encourage needed expansion ;
3) the establishment of an inter-
national radio forum and a world,
university of the air,. by whioh
(within the framework of existing
facilities) subjects of international
interest can be discussed, and 4)
"what might be called negative or
curative proposais for the removal
of barriers obstructing the flow of
communication."The report of
the Sub-Committee had recom-
mended, in regard to this"curative"
aspect of the program, that the
agency deal with copyright restric-
tions, with the cost of cable and
wireless communication, and"with
all restrictions on the flow of in-
formation and ideas across inter-
national boundaries, and with the
suppression and distortion of in-
formation and ideas by any in-
fluence."
In a final comment on the pro-
gram, the chairman of the Program
Committee emphasized the two
strands of thought which, as we
have seen, interweave everywhere
in the constitution and the pro-
gram of the agency. Without the
collaboration of the member na-
tions, Unesco can do nothing, he
concluded ;, yet at the same time, he
pointed out, these are"proposais
advanced for action by the peoples
of the worid."
U. S. S. R. Opposed
The Russian comment came
quickly, Vladislav Ribnikar, a 
Juge-
slav observer, addressed the General
Conférence at the first session to
explain why his government haù
not ratified the constitution of
1 Unesco ; and it was unmistakable
that his remarks were to be taken
as the view of the U. S. S. R. on thé
program and 
possibilités of thé !
new agency. In short, he served'
notice that the U. S S. R. is im-
placably opposed to the mass-com-
1 munications activities of Unesco
t This clarifies the situation. Thcre
is no reason 
to suppose that Soviet
Russia does not mean what she
! says. Nor has she raised an issue
which will disappear mcrely if it is
not diseussed. The initial responsc I[
to such a différence of opinion can
only be an effort of re-examina-
tion by member nations of Unesco
and their peoples-above ale bv
Americans, who are the prime
movers in the proposais to which
Russia objccts-of thé course of
action which has been taken. Therc
are no limites to thé ficld of such
an inquiry. But are there, perhaps.
scveral fixcd points which may
help orient the thinking which
must be donc ?

A aecond point. of référence 181
that Russia seems wUling to parti-
c1pate in certain activities-those
presumably of the"clearing h
kind--and that it 1s to the attRtn-
tage of everyone tha. . IIoutd
do so. The ne< :'^., ,".'"r maklng
such projects f'.'.. nd practical
is obvious-as is thé po sibUity of
over-extension of efforts.
An Unavoidabte Function
The third fixed point is that, in
Soviet : eyes. thé future of Unesco
dépend. on what is done in the
iield of mass communications. It
is helpfuf to be told this so plainly.
Shouid thé"western"answer, then.
be to drop those activities, to put
them in an organisation by them-
selves, or to go ahcad with them
--and if the latter, th !'n. on what
terms ?
To drop the mass communica-
tions activities would be for Unesco.
and for the United Nations, to
turn their backs on one of the
greatest.. potentially most useful
and most dangerous centers of
force in the modern world. It would
mean thé renunciation of a world
mission for the agency and its pa-
rent body. Since the forces of the
mass média are so unmistakably
both international and superna-
tional in character, an attempt to
harness and use them is an un-
avoidable function of a world
agency which pretends to concern
itself with the forces which make
for war and peace.
There has, however, been somme
evidence of a temptation among
différent groups of specialists to
play with the thought of putting
these mass-media activities in a
sCiparate organization. The Com-
mittee of Consultants to the De-
partment of State, in its report of
September, 1946, insisted that, i :
the mass-media work were rele-
gated to an inferior position, it
should be withdrawn from Unesco
and a new body which was ex-
clusively concerned with it should
be set up. The committee could
hardly have considered thé im-
plications of its suggestion. No-
thing could so easily put this whole
question of breaking down of bar-
riers to the use of the mass meùia
into terms of the United States
versus the world, as would such a
course. It is the United States
which is asking new arrangements,
new privileges, new fields of acti-
vity for its mass communication
industries, ail around the globe. A
world agency mainly representing
the objectives of one nation would
be 
unfortunate indeed.
Highbrow vs. Lowbrow
As an example of the contrary
tendency, we may note a protest
by Kenneth Lindsay. in the Lon-
don Spectator ; that"matters of
; technique sucti as the film, the
radio and the press have been
elevated into positions of undue
importance at the expense of
education and tcaehing,"and that
this has spoiled the purity of the
onginal concept. But. : ortunatcly,
a oivfsion of Unchco into t\vo
separate agencics is not scriousiy
1 bcing 
considered. Thc amalgama-
tion of the work of the two groups
of specialists is pssential if the work
of either is to be effective, as the
expérience of thé International
Institute makes plain. Hère, in-
decd, Americans can make a valu-
able contribution, for what comes
to thé surface in ait of this is the
old question of highbrow and low-
brow, perennially familiar to Amer-
icans. One of the gréât pieces of
ncws m the world is that. for the
first time in hi. story. therc cxists
a large nation with a mass culture
- 
the United States of America.
That mass culture is the reverse
of thc merdai of mass production

thing thé Am ('l'icun l'xpcl'1l'nce to

And hen-lies one more fixed
point of referenre. H is th (' int el"
action between thé mass culture of
thc United States. and thé culturels
of other mMnbrr states. which will
a'once b ('t {tn to Rive Unesco Ifs
shape and slze. Will there be an

strelun ? Th) a is what more than 0111'
country (quite apart from thé grog
of Stav nations) genuinety fears.
To phrase the question of ta,
U. S. S. R. and Unesco merely in
terms of whether and when Russla
. will jOin ia to miss what would
seem to be the most important point
of ait. The fact is that a wor\
platform has been et up, and th.
corollary fact is that Russia is on
this platform now, addressinj : thé
world. Whether or not she is for-
mally a member state of tht
agency, she will certainly continue
to do so. And with great shrewd-
ness in perceiving openings. she will
deliver her own message. She will
say many intelligent things, as Mr.
Ribnikar's speech at Paris shows.
The message will likewise be ruth-
lessly propagandist. Mr. Ribnikar's
demand, for example, that Unesco
take active measures to suppress
"any attempt to provoke suspicion
and hatred between thé peoptes,"
coming as it did after a demand
for strict observance of thé ruies of
the constitution, and after an at-
tack on thé centralization OIf
Unesco's activities which 1. Ione
might give the agency power, made
little sense. But it was skillful
propaganda, enabling the speaker
to take the offensive, and to at-
tach the epithet Fascist to"the free
flow of ideas"-a nimble feat
indeed. How effectively so negative
a propaganda will appeai to men'a
imaginations in the longer run Ls
another matter.
Whose nIul : print' ?
Russia does not doubt that a
. world community is desirable and
necessary, but she has her own
blueprint of the nature of that com-
munity. That, and not the shade
of meaning of such words as"im-
pose,"or of"matters essentially
within a nation's jurisdiction"and
so forth, is the substance of the
issue between Russia and the non-
Communist world, here as eise-
where. Nothing is gained by pre-
tending that this is not the case.
We may remind ourselves alitain
that there are many"clearing
house"activities in which the
U. S. S. R. can participate to her
own and Unesco's advantage ; b'. ;t
it may properly be emphasized also
that thé agency's larger aim of
bringing peoples more closely in
touch with peoples is repugnant
to the Soviet Union, and that she
will oppose'it. outside Unesco or
inside, as she thinks best. Unesco
can make it easier for the U. S. S. R.
to look with favor upon many of
its projects just by makins them
realistic. efficient and effective.
But there is no use spinning a
bridge of words.
Will the gap betwcen the twa
worlds be wtdened. then, if the new
agency, after careful examination
of the mass-communication pro-
jects, goes ahead with them ?
First iet us note again that this
l1lay 
not be quite the question. Ir
the United States pursues its own
special interests. enthusiasms and
objectives uncritically, a gay can
open in a different place, that is
to say, between the United States
and other nations of the non-Com-
munist worid. Thé drive behind

sum of $100, 000, 000 is riamed as the
goal.)
The campaign to make available
a minimum degree of education to
ail the people of the world-about
hall of whom can now neither read
nor write-is'a long-term project,
to be initiated by a survey by the
staff of the agency in collaboration
with experts from ail countries.
The program envisages eùucation i
for adults in such fields as agricul-
ture and public health, as well as
instruction for young and old in
thé rudiments of reading and writ-
ing. This should be one of 
Unesco's
gréât projeets.
The project for the world-wide
revision of textbooks is more con-
troversial. It calls for a clearing
house for the collection of in-
formation on the subject, in-
cluding copies of school books
most commonly used, the for-
mulation of a code of ethics for
writers of textbooks, and a world-
wide conference which would focus
attention on the subject. The ef-
fort would presumably be imple-
mented by bilateral agreements
between states. Unesco will, more-
over,"cali to the attention of the
member nations any misuse of the
facilities of teaching which it con-
siders dangerous to the peace."
The Explosive Element
The fourth major project in its
program-the elimination of bar-
riers to world communications and
the extension of the use of the
mass media-lies in the new, broad
category of"peoples speaking to
peoples."Inherent in every action
to be taken by Unesco is the pos-
sibility of appealing to world opi-
nion to achieve the desired ends.
But though that explosive element
is present to some degree in ail
the plans of the new agency, it is
eoncentrated in the proposai. for
action in the field of communica-
tions. The question of a global
network, by which the people of
all the world would be addressed
at one signal from a world center,
is merely one of the controversial
issues which focus upon this part
of the program. Even were it re-
moved, there would remain the in-
sistent problems of thé commercial
and cultural use of the new devices
of telecommunication (a word
which takes its full significance if
it is remembered that the first two
syllables mean"far-away") ; the
troublesome question of interpene-
tration of cultures ; and above ail
the issue of freedom of informa-
tion, which so séparâtes thé west-
ern lands from Russia.
Lest Unesco be too easily charg-
nd with temerity in tackling prob-
lems of this size, it should per-
I haps be pointed out that it was the
1 
prominence of thèse factors of in-
Ii ternational relations which created
1 
this specialized agency, not the
1 agency 
which originated the prob-
1 lems. The range and power of the
new 
inventions which have made
zthe problems so real are little ap-
! preciated ; indeed some of the new
devices may as yet be merely in
thé 
stage of Hargreaves'spinning-
jenny of 1770, Voice broadcasting
by radio, which can penctrate every
corner of the worid, is only one of
hem. To this familiar deveiop-
ment must be added such devices
as wireless transmission of fac-
simile pages, in color if desired. and
"nultiple address"newscasting,
which permit. wirf'lf'ss transmission
ot words by dot and dash at the
rate of 800 a minute (as compared
with 40 to 60 by cabale). Thc im-
plications of such a technique are

unprovided for. Vote is by ma-
jorlty ; save when international con-
ventions, e. g., a copyright conven-I
tion, are to be submitted to statues.
1vhen a two-thirds majority is re-
quired. Article V, Section 2 spells
out the idea :"The members of the
Executive Board shall exercise the
powers delegated to them by the
General Conference on behalf of
the Conference as a whole and not
as representatives of their respect-
ive Governt : l ?-ents."
The Real Leverage of Power
The Secretariat is wholly non-
governmental. This follows United
Nations precedent ; but the Director-
General of this agency is perhaps
more explicitly endowed with power
than is his prototype, the Secretary-
General ; he is succinctiy instructed
to"formulate proposais for appro-
priate action by the Conference and
the Board."Whether he or the
Executive Board will be the power
behind the throne remains to be
seen. The real leverage of Unesco
In whatever it does must be the
power of public opinion, and the
two requirements for the effective
application of that force are expert-
ness and unremitting attention to
the business in hand-virtues which
the Director-General and his staff
are designed to embody. At Paris,
however, the term of the first
Director-General was, by informai
agreement, limited to two years in-
stead of the six prescribed by the
constitution, and it was specified
that ail appointments by the Di-
rector-General must be approved by
the Executive Board.
In any event, much of what
Unesco does, and no matter
whether it be done through indi-
vidual states, or through individual
men and women, will be done by
an appeal to the mind of the com-
munity. The agency is enjoined
by its member states from"lnter-
vening in matters which are es-
sentially within their domestic
jurisdiction."But the General Con-
ference can summon international
conférences on education, on the
sciences and humanities and (a
broad phrase) on"the dissemina-
tion of knowledge."It can submit
recommendations and international
conventions to governments. Every
member state is obligated to submit
to it reports"relating to educa-
tional, scientific and cultural life
and institutions,"It is instructed
to"advise the United Nations Or-
ganization on the educationai.
scientLfic and cultural aspects of
matters of concern to the latter in
accordance with the terms and pro-
cedure agreed upon between thé
appropriate authorities of the two
Organizations."Ali this is the ap-
paratus for moulding public opinion.
To aid in summoning that tween-
tieth-century génie. Unesco ha,
also the instrument of the National
Commissions, the formation of
which is rceommendcd to the mem-
ber states by the constitution 
but
not made compulsory. (In the
United States. the Commission is
composed of représentatives of"0
organizations, and 40 individu
appointed by the Secretary,
State.) Given strong'ieadersh. p,
wise selection of issues and skilled
présentation, these Commissions
could conceivably exert much in-
fluence.
Portelltous"Mass Media"
And then. thcre are the porten-
tous"mass media."which Unesco
is so emphatically instructed to
cultivate. The purpose of the or-
ganizatlon is to"collabora te in thé
work of advancing thé mutual
knowledge and undeistanding of
peoples, through aU means of mas. 
communication and to that end

agreements as may be necessary
