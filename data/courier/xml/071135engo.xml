FROM THE UNESCO NEWSROOM
* United Kingdom : A Ministry of Edu-
cation report on a steady increase in the
demand for adult education has surpris-
ed certain quarters in Britain. It had
been expected that the interest in adult
education during the years following the
War might be only temporary. The
latest statistics, however, show a per-
manent increase in the number of stud-
ents attending adult education classes
throughout the country.
* Italy : The Food and Agriculture
Organization's new library, which has
been inaugurated in Rome, is the largest
agricultural library in Europe with its
400. 000 volumes. It is called after David
Lubin, founder of the International In-
stitute of Agriculture, one of the
world's first international organizations.
* Syria : On the invitation of the Syr-
ian Government, the Netherlands So-
ciety for Land Reclamation, in co-
operation with an engineering concern
and an airline, is planning to convert
15, 000 acres of wasteland to agricultural
use, in the Syrian valley of Gab. A
detailed plan will be made after air sur-
veys of the region.
* Norway : The Norwegian Government
has asked Parliament to approve a
81, 400, 000 appropriation for technical
and economic assistance to India. Nor-
wegian engineers, doctors and fisheries
experts will be sent to India, while In-
dians will be invited to Norway for tech-
nical training.
* Sweden : Thanks to intensive scien-
tific and industrial research, things once
considered useless are being changed
into much-needed industrial and con-
struction materials. Swedish experts
are using common peat-moss to make
insulating boards. In the United States,
technicians are developing electric equip-
ment that will turn sea-shells into
cement.
* Brazil : Outstanding physicists from
all American countries met in Rio de
Janeiro for a scientific meeting organiz-
ed by Unesco's Scientific Co-operation
office for Latin America, which func-
tions in Montevideo. This symposium
was held with the help of Brazil's scien-
tific institutions, and of the Internation-
al Union of Pure and Applied Physics.
* El Salvador : Savings stamps which
will be issued shortly by the school co-
operatives will bear pictures and slogans
illustrating different aspects of the
work of the United Nations, Unesco and
other UN specialized agencies. The Cul-
tural Ministry of El Salvador has
appointed a special commission to make
selections from among 100 themes sub-
mitted by UN agencies at El Salvador's
request.
* U. S. A. : It is estimated that 20, 000
American students, will cross the Atlan-
tic this summer to Europe. Some of
them will tour Europe by bicycle, while
others intend to stay in students'camps.
Several groups will attend special
courses in cultural institutions.
Meanwhile more than 30, 000
foreign students from 126 countries are
this year studying in United States col-
leges and universities, an all-time record
number according to statistics published
by the Institute of International Educa-
tion, New York City. The fact that
women students form nearly a quarter
of this total is also a record. Almost
half of the students have won scholar-
ships from their own governments, the
U. S. Government, private agencies or
the colleges and universities themselves.
By far the largest number of students-
10, 952--come from Asia and the Near
East. From Europe there are 7, 220, from
Latin America 6, 802, from Canada 4, 232
and from Africa 1, 072. Subjects studied
show engineering to be the most popu-
lar, attracting nearly 18 per cent of vi-
siting students. Almost as many are
taking courses in social sciences and the
liberal arts, while other popular fields
are medical and physical sciences, com-
merce, agriculture and the fine arts.
* Hungary : Something like 2, 000
theatre groups are functioning in rural
areas of Hungary. Special talent-spot-
ting boards visit the villages to select the
most promising actors, whose train-
ing is then paid for by the State.
Amateur actors from similar groups
formed in factories now form the major-
ity of the student body at the Budapest
High School of Dramatic Art. Some
2, 800 factory troupes took part in last
year's Hungarian National Culture
Contest.
* France : Paris children now have
their own theatre, set up under the aus-
pices of the Unesco-sponsored Interna-
tional Theatre Institute. Since the
theatre opened, thousands of schoolchil-
dren have had an afternoon off from
lessons in order to see a stage adaptation
of Robert Louis Stevenson's"Treasure
Island".
* Austria : A society of film sciences
has been formed by Austrian film-
makers, research workers and writers to
further the study of film problems, in-
volving mainly history, aesthetics, social
sciences and psychology.
United Kingdom : Old masters will no
longer"rob"space from contemporary
artists in the British Pavilion of the
Venice Biennale. This year's exhibit is
to consist of paintings, drawings, engrav-
ings and sculpture produced by modern
artists. Since the Pavilion was opened
in 1910, it had been the practice to com-
bine works of early English artists with
those of the moderns, but the British
Council has decided that the new policy
better serves the purpose for which the
Biennale exists.
* International : In order to help inter-
national technical assistance experts to
form a better idea of the cultures of the
different countries they are serving,
Unesco is publishing an explanatory
handbook called Cultural Patterns and
Technological Changes. It was prepared
by a committee headed by Dr. Margaret
Mead, the noted American anthropo-
logist.
* Denmark : According to Newts from
Copenhagen, well intentioned-if some-
what disrespectful-students at Copen-
hagen University have asked for more.. canned professors". By this, they mean
tape recordings of lectures given by pro-
minent guest speakers, which will make
them available to many more students,
now and in the future. In the United
States schools, universities and other
educational institutions which have their
own radio stations send tape recordings
of their most interesting broadcasts to
the National Association of Educational
Broadcasters, which passes them on to
other school stations, thus supplying a
wide range of interesting programmes at
very low cost.
* France : A unique collection of 500
rare or little known books on Joan of
Arc which an American jurist and
statesman, Judge Bingham, of Ken-
tucky, spent a lifetime assembling, have
been donated to the City Library in Or-
leans (France). The collection which
includes books in English, French and
Latin, covers every aspect of the life of
the Maid of Orleans.

* Scandinavia : History teachers from
all types of schools in Sweden, Norway
and Denmark have been invited to par-
ticipate in a regional seminar near
Stockholm in August to study ways of
using history courses as a means of fos-
tering international understanding. The
seminar is being organized by the
Swedish National Commission for
Unesco in co-operation with the Norden
Association and the Swedish Association
of History Teachers. It supplements the
Unesco International Seminar on the
same subject held at Sevres, France, last
year.
* United Kingdom : The International
Sculpture Competition for a work on the
theme"The Unknown Political Pri-
soner"sponsored by Britain's Institute
of Contemporary Arts, has brought
in about 3, 000 entries, represent-
ing 67 nationalities in 52 countries. The
largest number, 450, came from Ger-
many. Entries have also been received
from Canada, the United States, Austra-
lia, New Zealand, the Union of South
Africa, India, Ceylon, Burma, Malta,
British Guiana and the West Indies.
Many countries are arranging to hold
preliminary exhibitions where the best
works will be chosen before going to
London for final judging. In Italy,
prizes are offered to sculptors who
commemorate the Italian Resistance.
The prize money total £11, 500.
* Chile : The second Congress of Latin
American universities will take place in
September in Santiago de Chile. The
first Congress, which took place in 1949
in Guatemala, proclaimed the Latin
American universities charter, which
deals with the problem of educational,
scientific and cultural collaboration be-
tween the Latin American countries.
* International : A two-barge floating
summer theatre, travelling along the
Rhine, is performing before riverside
audiences in Switzerland, France, Ger-
many, the Netherlands and Belgium.
The actors are amateurs from ten dif-
ferent countries.
* United Kingdom : The invention of a
simple and inexpensive method-for
mass reproduction of manuscripts in
Braille has been announced in London.
The characters are reproduced in stencil
form and printed on paper with slow
drying ink. The paper is then coated
with a powder which sticks to the wet
dots. The characters are hardened by
heat treatment, so that they stand out
from the surface of the page to be felt
by the sensitive fingers of the blind.
* International : The International
Civil Aviation Organization has begun
work on a international aviation
language that can be used, without
danger of misunderstanding, between
speakers of various tongues. It has
already published a dictionary designed
to clarify the specialized aeronautical
vocabularies in English, French and
Spanish. The need for a standard
language of communication between air-
craft in flight and the ground has been
increased by the greater emphasis which
is being placed on the use of radiotele-
phony rather than code. Pending the
development and adoption of ILA or
International Language for Aviation,
English is recommended by ICAO, be-
cause it is now by far the most used
language in world air transport. Indeed,
the basis of ILA is to be a simplified,
codified, limited English with the addi-
tion of words from other languages.
* France : Second-hand booksellers in
Paris, whose stalls on the banks of the
Seine are a well-known sight, have
founded an unusual annual literary
prize, Ie Prix Littèraire des Bouquin-
istes. Its purpose is"to attract the
attention of readers in general-and
idlers on the quays of the Seine in par-
ticular-to a worthy book in French
which has escaped the vigilance of
literary critics and book selection com-
mittees", and has wound up on a
second-hand bookstall, probably before
ending its days among old papers at the
pulping mill. The winning author must
not already have received a literary
prize.
* Mexico : Colour television has been
installed in the National School of Me-
dicine of the University of Mexico to
train students. The equipment is of
particular value for the broadcast of
practical demonstrations, and will en-
able large numbers of students to see
operations in close-up which they could
not possibly observe in such detail in
any other way.
* International : The Conservatories of
Music in Paris and Rio de Janeiro have
recently concluded an agreement where-
by scholarships awarded in a compe-
tition of young Brazilians will permit
them to finish their studies in Paris.
* United States : An ornamental foun-
tain has been presented to the United
Nations by schoo]hildren of the United
States as an expression of their faith in
the Organization. The fountain was de-
dicated at the United Nations Headquar-
ters in New York on the seventh anni-
versary of the signing of the UN Char-
ter. in San Francisco. Its plaque bears
the inscription"Presented to the United
Nations by the children of the United
States and its territories as a gesture of
friendship to the children of the world
and a constant reminder of our hope for
a peaceful world through the United Na-
tions."
* International : An illustrates hand-
book for education through art, entitled
"Creative Teaching in the Visual Arts",
will be published this year by Unesco,
under the general editorship of Dr. Ed-
win Ziegfeld of Teachers College, Co-
lumbia University, New York. Reflecting
theories and practices in many coun-
tries, it will epitomize various aspects of
education through art considered during
the Unesco Seminar on the Teaching of
the Visual Arts which was held in Bris-
tol in the United Kingdom in July, 1951.
* International : The first Internatio-
nal Poetry Biennale will be held under
the auspices of Unesco and the Inter-
national PEN Club at Knokke-Ie-Zoute,
Belgium, from September 11 to 15. In-
vitations to attend this meeting of poets
have been issued by the Belgian Minis-
try of Education to all Unesco Member
States.
* Israel : Unesco is sending five scien-
tists in optics, bio-chemistry, geology
and experimental physics to Israel as
part of its Technical Assistance pro-
gramme. Five fellowships will also ena-
ble Israelite scientists to study abroad in
these fields. Unesco has previously pro-
vided technical aid in the setting up of
a seismological network and in research
into new sources of electric power in
Israel.
* Great Britain : The University of Bir-
mingham has established a Shakespeare
Institute for the promotion of Shakes-
pearean and related Elizabethan studies.
The new institute, organized as a cen-
tre for research work, will have a staff
of teaching fellows. Its students will be
largely candidates for advanced degrees.
Resources will be available from the
Shakespeare Memorial Library, other lo-
cal collections and the archives at Strat-
ford, Birmingham and Warwick.
* France : Children in isolated rural
areas of France no longer have to tra-
vel to the city to visit a museum-it now
comes to them in the form of a travel-
ling"bus-museum"service. Set up by
the International Children's Centre in
Paris, the first travelling museum has
been visiting the French countryside for
the past months with exhibitions of all
kinds in the form of drawings, photo-
graphs, small scale models as well as
large panels showing engravings and co-
lour reproductions of works of art. Use
is also made of books, films and record-
ings. All exhroits are periodically chang-
ed. Through this service, the Children's
Centre seeks to bring country boys and
girls aspects of French life as well as
that of other lands.

A novel movement for the collective viewing of television programmes is bringing
entertainment and education to young people and old in an increasing number of
small villagers in France. When the notice"Television programme this afternoon"-
- is posted outside the local school (above), children can hardly wait to get into the
classroom to see the"show"which gives lessons a new interest. In the evening,
villagers (below) gather in the school house to watch and discuss programmes.
by Henry R. CASSIRER
IN the village of Nogentel, 60 miles east of Paris, television was
known two years ago as one of those miracles of modern science,
like atomic energy or air conditioning, which belong to a world
far removed from the traditional life of the peasants.
Today, however, the village gathers several times a seek to
'watch television programmes in its little one-room school house, and
is proud of having started a movement for collective viewing-a
movement which may hold great significance for many countries.
Television today is developing rapidly in the United States and
Great Britain, and also in many countries of Latin America and on
the European continent. Even in Asia and Africa steps are being
taken to establish television broadcasting. But because sets are
expensive in most of these countries, there is the danger that this
great new medium for education and information may become
nothing but a source of entertainment for those who can afford to buy
luxury items.
That is why Unesco is particularly interested in the movement
for collective viewing in French villages, which is sho'wing a way to
bring television to poorer people and enabling them to use it primarily
for education. This movement is a French contribution to the use of
television for education which ranks with efforts of a different kind
being made in the United Kingdom and the U. S. A.
Here is what happened in Nogentel, Gland, Chaudun and 40 other
villages of 200 or 300 inhabitants where most people make their living
as land labourers, small farmers and wine growers.
The idea of using television sets for entertainment and education
in these villages originated among a group who had tried. to organize
film clubs but who had run up against many obstacles. These were
due to the high cost of projectors and film rentals, the problem of
moving the few projectors available from village to village and the
difficulty of finding skilled projectionists without whose services the
projectors frequently broke down.
Those film clubs, and now the television clubs, are guided mainly
by the primary school masters. In France, adult education rests
predominantly in the hands of these teachers, who are well organized
throughout the country and spend a good deal of their after-school
time in bringing cultural activities into the lives of villages and
townspeople alike.
The plan which these teachers developed together with a group
of television enthusiasts works as follows : by agreement with
various television set manufacturers, a set is placed for a limited
period in the school house, and the villagers are invited to view
programmes in the evenings. At first they can see them free, later
a small entrance fee is charged.
After a few weeks the teacher asks the villagers whether they
want to buy the set. So far, in all except one village, the answer has
been affirmative, and many villagers have even volunteered to
advance the necessary funds (in France these amount to about
180, 000frs. or $300 for complete installation of a set with a screen
measuring 12 square feet.
A local committee is formed which organizes the purchase,
determines the entrance fee (the money that has been advanced is
paid back out of this) and chooses the programmes, as the set is
turned on only a few nights a week.
Soon the villagers get into the habit of gathering in the school
house for entertainment, and also for education and informal
discussion. Quite naturally a closer link develops between the
schoolmaster and his community,'while the adults take a greater
interest in the life of the school.
One of the essential conditions of this plan is that the set is made
available during day-time for reception of educational programmes
in the cla room, and that it will become school property once it has
been fully paid out of the admission fees. It is therefore of immediate
advantage to the school, and becomes eventually a valuable source of
additional income which can be used for school purposes, such as
trips and special equipment for sports and theatre activities.
Even though French programmes are at present only of limited
educational value, it is undeniable that the television set is already
enriching the life of the community. The programmes which are
being received with the greatest interest by adults and children alike
are those which tell them"hdw things work". An inside view of a
newspaper plant, films showing life abroad, personal accounts by
explorers and scientists, unusual sports events all find an eager
audience among the peasants who rarely emerge from the isolation
of their normal life.
At the same time, the viewing groups are constructive critics for
the improvement of broadcasts. They strongly objected to the
broadcast of gangster films, with the result that these were finally
omitted from French programmes. The organizers realize that
their movement can be really beneficial only if they are supported by
special educational programmes which can be prepared from
information distributed in advance and exploited more fully through
discussions following the broadcast. Educators and French televi-
sion are therefore planning to co-operate in the creation of such
programmes.
The peasants and schoolmasters of the French départments of
Aisne and Marne have only made a beginning. They have organized
themselves into the National Federation of Educational and Cultural
Television in oi'der to give organized support to this movement, which
is spreading \vherever television can be received.
The entire project is now being officially sponsored by the Ligue
Française de 1'Enseignement (the French League for Education).
Their efforts may eventually help many other countries to find a
way to give television its place as a vital force for the improvement of
education, the dissemination of knowledge and the enjoyment of an
expanding life of culture.

U. N. Photographs
by Eric Schwab
UNESCO COUF
In Burma, an ever-increasing number
of women and young girls are volun-
teering to train as doctors, nurses,
social workers and midwives thanks
to the energetic efforts of Daw Khin
Kyi, widow of one of the country's
national heroes, who directs Burma's
Mother and Child Welfare Depart-
ment. Trained women are badly
needed in the hospitals and dispen-
saries of which there are still too few
(upper photos). Their skill and devo-
tion are just as urgently required by
families crowded into single rooms
(photo below). In this room live six
people-including a T. B. sufferer.
WOMEN HAVE
"NO'NO !"protested Da'w Khin Kyi,
when a fulsome compatriot des-
cribed her as the Little Mother of
the Country. And she added :
"Just call me Little Sister".
Little Sister of her Country is the widow of
Aung San, the statesman who negotiated the
treaty with Britain which gave Burma its inde-
pendence. He was later assassinated by polit-
ical rivals in the government buildings where
Daw Khin Kyi now'works.
As the widow of a national hero, she would
have been honoured in Burma-but she has
won a place of her own as well. She does not
call herself Mrs. Aung San, but, in this country
of emancipated women, retains her maiden
name (pronounced Dawkinchee), and works for
her living as the Director of the Mother and
Child Welfare Department.
I had been warned of the charm of Daw
Khin Kyi-"warned"because her flashing
smile and disarming chuckle is calculated to
win any argument.
That is why I found myself being eaten alive
by nocturnal insects as I sat in a tropical garden
and watched a revue of which I did not under-
stand one word. It was no use pleading that
we had been out since before dawn, labouring
in the sweltering heat, without respite or a
meal. Even the fact that it had been all in the
interests of Daw Khin Kyi's mothers and chil-
dren was no excuse. She just smiled...
It was graduation day for her student nurses.
They had qualified for their arduous assign-
ment of going out into the country, to the vil-
lages of the Irrawaddy delta and up into the
hill states. And she was going to see that they
enjoyed themselves. She had been a nurse
herself once. (It was while nursing Aung San,
then leader of the Burmese resistance army,
that their romance started.) So she was stag-
ing a party for them. And they were staging
a party for her.

ALWAYS BEEN MEN'S EQUALS IN BURMA
These 12 girls were Daw Khin Kyi's pride
and joy. They were girls whom she had
selected from the countryside and had brought
to Rangoon to train (because city-bred girls
would not take very well to the country life for
which the nurses were needed). And they had
qualified with honours.
Their idea of a celebration was to put on a
play or a series of sketches with songs and
dancing, illustrating a student nurse's life and
why they were going to be nurses (with a lot of
slapstick to liven the argument).
The stout figure under the banyan tree was
U Bat Sein, Permanent Secretary of the Minis-
tries of Health and Education, laughing
uproariously and applauding vigorously.
"This,"he said,"is part of the answer to our
problem of recruiting nurses. Let's send this
show round the countryside, and the people
will love it, and the girls will rush to join..."
Daw Khin Kyi has other methods as well.
She gets the wives of cabinet ministers to
appear at women's meetings. Most of them
have been nurses, doctors, or professional
women. And the idea is that if a girl takes up
nursing, she may get a good match.
"But,"I warned her,"if you bring girls into
the nursing profession just as a prelude to get-
ting married, isn't your training going to be
wasted ?"
She smiled pityingly at this male logic.
"No training of women is ever wasted in our
country,"she said. ("wen a woman sets up a
home she does not cast away her experience.
Even if she makes a modest match, the girl-
nurse is always the'good neighbour'. Her
skill is a permanent part of the community.
And when a woman marries she does not give
up her career. There are more women than
men doctors in Burma. Our leading lawyer is
a woman..."
And she quoted a whole list, pointing out,
too, that \women were responsible for organiz-
ing and running most of the social institutions
in the country.
That is what makes Burma exceptional in
South-East Asia. Women from time imme-
morial have had equality with men. At one
time there was probably polyandry (the form
of polygamy in which the woman has several
husbands). Marriage is an equal contract, civil
and not religious. Divorce is by consent. All
property is shared equally between husbands
and wives. Most of the trading is done by
women and, in the case of market-traders, the
housekeeping is often done by the husband.
Burma also claims to be exceptional in its
high proportion of literacy. Boys and girls, in
the Buddhist tradition, have attended the temple
schools. Now these schools are run by lay
teachers (another secular function which the
priests have lost), but visiting educationists and
quite a number of Burmese expresses some
misgivings about what"literacy"amounts to.
The content of education leaves a lot to be
desired.
One of the most significant developments in
independent Burma is the Burmese Translation
Society, which is setting out to put worthwhile
literature from every language into Burmese.
The government supports the Society and has
helped it to send missions to other parts of the
world to get help for this enlightened enter-
prise.
Another new development is mass education.
Aung Min, Secretary of the Mass Education
Council, told me how, in spite of insurrection
in the countryside, Government trained mass
education organizers spread through the vil-
lages.
"Our activities", he said,"are entirely confin-
ed to rural areas. We choose a village as the
centre of a district-even in the Hill States---
and there are now 105 of these village centres.
"We select men who can provide leadership,
and give them six months'training. Main
emphasis is on health, then agriculture, home
crafts and rural industries, co-operatives, tech-
niques and adult education. They come from
the villages and go back to the villages.
"The organizer's house becomes the model
home in the village, an example to others to
improve their cleanliness and sanitation. He
lives the lives of the villagers, takes a part in
their work problems, their education problems
and their health problems. lIe leads the chil-
dren in games, and adults into the anti-illiteracy
campaign.
"Priests play a big part in this movement.
They urge the people in their areas to start the
community centres and to get a mass education
urganizer, and many of the centres are in the
monasteries, just as the schools are."
Unesco sent Dr. Tisinger and Prof. Her-
nandez, at the request of the Government, to
help with the educational problems of Burma.
One of the biggest problems is training. There
are 13, 000 teachers available in the country, but
45, 000 are needed-a deficiency of 32, 000.
Apart from filling that gap, the output of
existing teachers'training colleges are putting
out only a fifth of the replacements required.
Plans for new training schools and new edu-
cational improvements in line with the
Unesco recommendations are now in process
for both normal and Fundamental Education.
The task of equipping a new country with
staff for Government administration, education,
health services, new industries, improved agri-
culture, financial and economic services. is
enormous. The Burmese Government has
recognized that in its very extensive and extra-
ordinarily varied requests for technical assis-
tance from U. N.
One of the advantages which Burma has is
the full participation of the women. When
women are on the side of change, everything
is possible.

AN INQUIRY INTO RACE
RELATIONS IN BRAZIL
by Dr. Alfred (/Jf
HY has Unesco undertaken a sociological inquiry into
race relations in Brazil ? This question has often been
asked, for it comes as a surprise to some people that
an international organization should choose for its study
of inter-racial relations a country which is considered
to have no urgent problems of this kind, People are
so accustomed to seeing efforts being made to relieve
t-n4 : ll+ thou I"'Q'nnnt nnÑø : rC ! t. t. : 20nñ Tlr'hu ð........ nT"ð nor løcC ! n ! : lJ--critical situations that they cannot understand why a more or less har-
monious state of affairs has need of attention.
Even the purpose of this inquiry has caused a certain amount of alarm
among people who fear it might. have repercussions on the very situation
Unesco is trying to analyze and describe."Beware,"they say,.'of making
the Brazilians conscious of racial differences to which at present they
apparently attach little importance. Take care not to arouse by indiscreet
questioning the sort of antagonisms which are always ready to flare up."
Such remarks, even if made seriously, have no careful thought behind
them, for the social sciences are not able, at present at least, to exercise
a direct and immediate influence on ideas which have taken root since
centuries. It is quite natural, however, for people to express surprise
that the study of race relations in Brazil should be part of Unesco's
campaign against racial prejudices and discrimination.-------o ; t  -.....-------. a...
It is particularly important to explain
the reason for this choice since the
gravity of racial conflicts in other parts
of the world would seem to call for an
entirely different approach.
But it was not in a spirit of escap-
ism or with the desire to undertake
an easy task that Unesco embarked on
this analysis of Brazilian behaviour in
matters of race. Innumerable studies
have already been made of racial dis-
crimination in all its forms. Whole
libraries could be filled with books and
articles devoted to descriptions and
analyses of racial prejudice and its
effects.
In the United States alone, hundreds
of organizations and public and private
institutions concern themselves with
problems arising from racial discrimi-
nation in the hope of solving them
through scientific methods. Again, the
fierce tensions which racial antagonism
provokes in South Africa form the sub-
ject of an abundant and ever-increas-
ing literature.
It would have been extremely diffi-
cult, therefore, for Unesco to find new
facts to add to those already assembled,
and it is doubtful whether supplement-
ary inquiries could have thrown new
light on these problems that have been
studied and discussed so often.
The rare examples of harmonious
race relations have not, however,
received the same attention either from
scientists or the public in general. Yet
the existence of countries in which
different races live in harmony is itself
an important fact capable of exercising
a strong influence on racial questions
in general.
One of the basic dogmas of racialism
is that men of different races cannot
mix without condemning themselves to
moral and physical decadence.
Those who believe this declare that
complete segregation is the only
solution for countries inhabited by two different races, for, they say, there
must be a congenital incompatibility between human beings whose skins
are of a different colour or whose noses have a different shape.
If we can show, by one or more concrete examples, that this argument,
or more precisely this belief, is false, the injustices and sufferings which
segregation policies inflict on members of the so-called"inferior"races
can no longer be justified.
Is the harmony real or apparent ?
THE case of Brazil offers the strongest argument against this racialistcreed. It is not therefore a waste of time to learn more about a social
environment which so strongly refutes everything that theorists of
racialism and politicians who support them continue to affirm.
The generally favourable impression produced by Brazil's race relations
has for many years been remarked on by travellers and sociologists who
have been greatly surprised to find there such different attitudes from
those observed in other parts of the world. Brazil has, in fact, been hailed
as one of the rare countries which. have achieved"racial democracy".
But science demands more than general observations. It wants to know
if this harmony is real or only apparent and if it appears in the same form
on all social levels and in every part of Brazil.
Earlier inquiries, particularly the historic works of Gilberto Freyre and
the sociological research done by Donald Pierson in Bahia had already
confirmed the favourable opinions that had been widely formed on Brazil's
racial situation, but not all doubts had been removed. Several incidents,
and some angry statements made by Negro organizations, suggested that
Last year, Unesco undertook a full, on-the-spot inquiry into thevarious social, economic, cultural and psychological factors-
both favourable and unfavourable-which condition race
relations in Brazil today. The reasons why a country like Brazil,
which has been regarded by sociologists and students of race rela-
tions as a remarkable example of racial harmony, was chosen for
Unesco's"pilot survey"rather than some other country in which
racial tensions are more bitter, are explained on this page by
Dr. Alfred Métraux, of the Race Relations Division of Unesco. In
order to avoid giving this survey too local a character, the most repre-
sentative regions throughout Brazil were included, and the task
entrusted to a number of different scientific groups and individuals
from Brazil itself and from abroad. The survey included direct
contact and case studies of the attitudes towards racial problems
- particularly towards the Negro and his position in the social scale-
of the population of four large metropolitan areas of Brazil : Sao
Paulo, the fastest growing city not only of Brazil but of all Latin
America ; Rio de Janeiro, the federal capital and a large industrial
centre ; Bahia (also called Salvador, or Salvador da Bahia), the great
Negro metropolis of Brazil ; and Recife, capital of the arid State of
Pernambuco, in the north-eastern hump of the country. The ques-
tion of race relations in rural Brazil-a subject that up to now has
been largely neglected-was also undertaken by a Unesco team in
a series of first-hand case studies in representative communities of
mountainous Central Brazil, the Amazon region, the arid backlands
(sertao) of the north-east, and the plantation area of the Bahian area.
The articles published on the following pages present a picture of
what the scientists conducting the Unesco survey found to be the
state of racial attitudes in Brazil today. Except for the article on the
place of the Negro in Brazilian history, by Gilberto Freyre-author of
"The Masters and the Slaves", a monumental study of the develop-
ment and evolution of the patriarchal society in Brazil-the articles
presented in this issue were written by the scientists who have played
a leading role in Unesco's survey. The work of the Unesco team
on race relations in rural Brazil is being published by Unesco in book
form this year under the title"Class and Caste in Rural Brazil",
edited by Dr. Charles Wagley, of Columbia University, New York.
The studies and findings of the other teams will be published by
Unesco within the next two years. This complete up-to-date study of
the Negro and race relations in Brazil will total at least six volumes.
racial relations were not as harmonious as many Brazilians and foreigners
liked to believe.
Yet if even no discordant note had been sounded, the existing harmony
would still have needed clarification and explanation by concrete examples.
It is the scientist's duty to discover which factors have so far preserved
Brazil from the bitter fruits of racial discrimination.
Thus it was in order to draw a lesson from the case of Brazil that Unesco
entrusted to different teams of sociologists, anthropologists and psycholo-
gists the task of completing existing knowledge by making studies of other
areas and different social groups.
These investigations extended from the Amazon region to the industrial
area of Sao Paulo and covered varying sections of the community ranging
from populations living in sertao (backlands) villages to members of uni-
versIty circles.
Brazilian authorities and scientific centres gave Unesco their whole-
hearted support, knowing that their country's reputation had nothing to
fear from such research. The few shadows on the picture only help to
intensify the light which suffuses it.
Unesco's inquiry has been of a purely sociological and psychological cha-
racter, that is, it has dealt with present-
day social realities, while historical
questions have been given only a minor
place. Nevertheless we should not for-
get that the racial attitudes found in
Brazil spring from a long historic tra-
dition. They show us that the attitude
of the Iberian peoples towards the slave
differed greatly from that of other
colonial powers.
Thus, clauses favourable to slaves
have always existed in Spanish and
Portuguese laws and the laws them-
selves have aimed at helping slaves
win their freedom. Such clauses reflect
the will of the church which, as early
as the 16th century, defended the In-
dians and the Negro slaves as human
beings. However miserable was the lot
of the slave in Brazil, he was never at
any time reduced to the level of an ani-
mal, and once freed he could aspire to
joining the community of free men,
and thus begin to rise in the social
scale..",
Debt to former slaves
THOSE who deplore the presence inj a country like Brazil of a large
minority of coloured people too
easily tend to forget the role which the
Indians and Negroes have played in the
growth of Brazilian civilization. As
many historians have already pointed
out, the Brazilian nation would have
had an entirely different character
were it not for the African contribu-
tions which it owes to its former slaves.
Can there be any doubt that this
contribution by the Negro has singu-
larly enriched the social, religious and
artistic traditions of a country now in
the course of demonstrating its power-
ful originality and of setting up a new
type of civilization ? To be astonished
that a Negro or a mulatto can be
talented and rise to a position of
importance is to express an unconscious. -.. 1......... :--..... +..................... \..' ; 1' ; +........,.. of : +1-....... hlnn1rracialism, as well as to cast doubt on the innate capabilities of the black
race.
When we speak of the debt owed by Brazil to its coloured citizens, we
are not thinking of those of its distinguished men who are wholly or
partly Negro. More significant is the wider contribution of the Negro
civilizations superimposed on that of the Portuguese by millions of slaves
imported from Africa.
The colonization of Brazil has been an adventure shared in by whites
and Negroes who even against their inclination have worked closely
together to set up a new social environment. The charm of Brazilian
life derives to a certain extent from those African traditions which have
moulded the national character.
Another lesson which can be drawn from Brazil's example is the large
part whieh economic factors play in the formation of racial prejudices.
Rapid urbanization in Brazil has upset the relations between whites
and Negroes in certain large towns, and has provoked conflicts which
threaten to become serious.
The rise of a rural working class, accompanied by growing competition
between immigrants and the large numbers of coloured people who are
moving into the industrial centres, could destroy this"racial democracy"
if the racialist feelings they bring to the surface. wee not countered by a
strong resistance based on liberal and open-hearted traditions.
In Brazil,"racial"laws were passed to combat racial prejudice and not
to give it official existence.
That is why-as Unesco's inquiry has clearly shown-Brazil remains an
exemplary nation, destined because of this to play an important role in the
building of a world in which mutual respect between races will become an
established and universal fact.

by Gilberto FREYRE
Author of The Masters and the Slaves
IT has been said by more than one author thatany account of the Negro in Brazil would be
no less than the history of the country itself.
This is obviously an exaggeration, for the same
thing has been said of the Portuguese, who made
a nation of Brazil through the development of a
patriarchal slave-holding, agrarian system, in
which the Negro was a basic element, but not the
whole system.
There are also interpreters of Braze's social and
cultural development who consider that the Indian
- and not the European or Negro"intruder"-
should be the central figure. According to them,
Brazilian history should be Indocentric (to use the
technical term), and not Lusocentric of Afrocen-
tric.
The problem of which group has played the
greatest role in Brazilian historv is a difficult one
to deal with objectively ; but the best evidence so
far assembled by social anthropologists and histor-
ians seems to indicate that the Negro is second
only to the Portuguese as the ba'sic element to
which Brazil owes not only its economic existence,
but also the main extra-European traits in its
modern culture and social organization.
Throughout America. Brazilian culture is noted
more for these extra-European traits (although
it remains predominantly European in culture)
than for its passively colonial sub-European
characteristics. And much of what contributes to
thm vigorous beginning of an original Brazilian
culture comes from the fact that the Negro, as a
result of the comparatively iiberat treatment given
him by the Portuguese, has had an opportunity
to express himself as a Brazilian and not as an
intruder, either ethnically or culturlly. It is also
because he has had an opportunity to express
himself as a Brazilian of African origin and not
as an undesirable African who shou) d never have
been introduced into Brazil at all.
The African came as a slave to Brazil as early
as the 15th century, the very century when the
country was discovered by the Portuguese. He
was introduced, first to supplement, but soon to
take the place of the Indian who was so hard to
maintain in slavery that it became uneconomic to
use him as a slave.
Admirers of the Indian regard this as evidence
that he was, and is, ethnically superior to the
African, in whom social psycho) ogists tike McDou-
gall have not hesitated to find a sort of instinct of
submission. More than this, they see here evidence
to confirm the idea that the Indian should be
considered by Brazilians as the really"noble
savage", whose blood Brazilians should be proud
and honoured to have running in their veins.
This may be true, but it is also true that the
insubordination of the Indian slave to his captors,
and his lack of adaptability to routine agrarian
work in the Portuguese plantations were not
enlirely an expression of race, psychology or
character ; they were also a consequence of the
fact that culturallv most Indians were in a nomad-
ic, non-agricuttural stage, while many of the
Africans brought to Brazil as slaves had reached
this agricultural stage and therefore accepted a
sedentarv life more readilv than the Indians.
Beside, it is not correct to say that Africans in
Brazil were always submissive to their masters.
Africans adapted themselves to their sedentary
life, but not always to slavery. From the early
colonization period, right down to the abolition of
slavery by the Brazilian Empire in 1889, there
were a number of slave uprisings, not only on
plantations, but also in towns and cities.
The most important Brazilian city during the
colonial period, Salvador da Bahia, was rocked by
a violent rising of African stave against their
masters in the early days of the Empire. The
astute Mussulman slaves were the"grey emi-
nence"behind this and other slave risings-for
among the Africans imported for household and
plantation work, Brazil was fortunate in having a
considerable number of Mussulmans, and a still
larger number of Negroes who had come under
Islamic influence and adopted that religion and
part of Mohammedan culture.
A number of these imported Africans knew how
to read and write Arabic, and some of them even
imported Arabic books through a French book-
seller in Rio. At that time a large number of
white plantation owners hardly knew how to read
their prayer-books or write notes for their wills,
while the ladies were kept so ignorant that they
were considered accomplished when they could
laboriously trace their own Christian names !
It seems also to have been a fact that a number
of girls were imported from Africa to Brazil to be
the mistresses of Portuguese princes of trade
established in cities like Salvador. Therefore
these girls were selected somewhat according to
Caucasian standards of beauty and European
refinement, and usua lIy from slightly Arabized
and Islamized African groups.
In connection with the history of the Negro in
Brazil, it should never be forgotten that Brazil
was colonized by the Portuguese who, as early as
the 15th century, became captors of slaves in
Africa. These were used in domestic as well as in
plantation work, and some were treated as if
thev were members of the white families to whom
they became attached. The 15th century Portu-
guèse historian, Zurara, teUs us that he'knew a.. _1,.....-...... l'.... 1 ..... number r such cases.

in the home. This explains why so many of the
slaves introduced into Portugal during the 15th
century were gradually Christianized and Europe-
anized, instead of being kept apart as.'Negroes"
or"barbarians".
Such an example was followed, to a large extent,
in Brazil, though it must be admitted that, under
the pressure of violent economic and environ-
mental changes, some masters were both inhumane
and cruel to their slaves.
A number of these masters had only one aim : to
become rich in the tropics as quickly as possible.
Therefore, they treated their slaves, not as mem-
bers of their patriarchal family, according to the
best Arab and Portuguese tradition, but as ani-
mals, from whom an ambitious sugar cane or
coffee planter sought to extract the maximum of
productivity for a minimum of expense in food,
clothing and lodging.
But it is only fair to say that,. as a rule, the
patriarchal system of slave-holding and agrarian
family life preserved in Brazil some of the Arab
methods of dealing with slaves that 15th century
Portugal introduced into Europe. A number of
reliable foreign observers tell us that slavery in
Brazil was more humane than in other parts of
America and of the world.
Some of them go so far as to contrast the
situation in Brazil with that of workmen in the
new factories of Europe during the early 19th
century. They reached the conclusion that it was
better to be a slave in a typically patriarchal sugar
or coffee plantation in Brazil than a labourer in
a European factory at that time.
Comparisons have also been made between the
treatment received by slaves in Brazil under the
patriarchal system and that received by free la-
bourers during the years of economic laissez-faire
that followed the liberation of the Negroes in Por-
tuguese America. Some investigators reached the
conclusion that the stave, under the patriarchal,
paternalistic regime, were probably better cared
for by their masters than free labourers, black
and white, during these years of transition. But
it is probably true that this period, cruel as it
was, contributed to the development of a more
virile personality among the ablest groups of black
or coloured labourers.
Throughout the history of Brazil, the contri-
bution of Negroes, both slave and free, has not
only aided Brazil's economic development, but
enriched Brazilian cultural life. In addition, as
more than one foreign observer has pointed out,
the Negro has contributed to what may be
described as the most originally Brazilian types of
feminine grace or beauty.
Brazilian quadroon or octoroon girls have a
special charm that harmonizes peculiarly with the
forms and colours of the tropical iandscape. It is
rarely attained by completely white girls or girls
with only a touch of Indian blood. And it is
common, now, in Brazil to observe, in even the
whitest Brazilian girls, a sort of subtle or indirect
imitation of this type of feminine beauty or grace,
as in the Negro's rhythm of walking, and her grace
in dancing and smiling.
One may say that, even without race mixture,
the profound influence of the Negro has made
itself felt in Brazil. Every Brazilian, no matter
how blonde, bears in his soul something of the
Negro. This influence is to be seen in a number
of intimate aspects of Brazilian life or culture such
as in the colourful form of Catholicism which
delights their senses, and their typical way of
walking, laughing and dancing.
The Negro influence is evident in Brazilian
music too, particularly in lullabies, ghost and ani-
mal stories, and folk tales.
As for Brazilian cooking, it would be nothing
more than that of Portugal, with a touch or two
of Indian influence, were it not for the African
contributions such as African vegetables, African
stimulants to taste of the kind that have been
described as.'aphrodisiac to one's appetite".
These, Brazil has assimilated and blended with
European, Arab, East Indian and American Indian
tastes.
In fact, African culture in Brazil is far from a
mere museum or anthropological curiosity. It is
not merely picturesque, but living and creative.
A Brazilian whose skin is black and whose hair
is woollv does not consider himself an African or
a Negro ; bust a Brazilian. This explains why his
situation is entirelv different from that of the
Negro in the United States or in South Africa,
even though he may not be as well adjusted to
predominantly European ways as he is to those
which characterize modern Brazil.
This also explains why it was so natural for a
famous Brazilian Negro, with a good European
literary education, to have once said in a speech :
*'\Ve. members of the Latin race..."In Brazil, a
Negro with a literary education find no diflìcultv
in considering himself not only a Brazilian, that is
a futi-nedged'citixpn of Brazil, but also a Latin, a
member of the Latin race.

SAO PAULO

THE OCTOPUS
TOWN
IN 1888, when slavery was abolished in Brazil,Sao Paulo was still only a colonial town where
life followed the traditional rural rather than
the urban pattern. Today it is the second city of
Brazil, with nearly a million-and-a-half inhabit-
ants, and the largest industrial centre in the
whole of Latin America. With its reinforced
concrete skyscrapers and its feverish construction
boom (a new building goes up at the rate of one
every fifteen minutes), its ring of smoking chim-
neys, its mixture of peoples and races-Italians,
Portuguese, Spaniards, Germans, Slavs and
Japanese, mingled with the old Brazilian stock-'
and with its Negro population, flocking from north
and central Brazil to join the army of industrial
workers, Sao Paulo is truly, in Verhaeren's
phrase, an"octopus"town.
Industrialization and city life have given the
coloured man opportunities which he has learned
to take advantage of with practical common sense.
First of all, in the big city where most people pass
unknown, he has been able to melt into the crowd
and thus escape from the patriarchal life of the
old rural families and the tradition of passive sur-
render or servile submission to the whites as a
class. And although he may live in a slum, it does
not prevent him from breathing the air of free-
dom. He has a better chance of giving his children
an education which will help them to rise in the
social scale. Above all, he finds jobs open to him
in factories and industries, both big or small,
where he can earn wages high enough to improve
his standard of living. Already a middle class of
coloured people is emerging in Sao Paulo, who
own their houses or land, and who are distin-
guished from the lower working class by their
puritanical outlook and their sense of dignity.
It was, of, course, possible for the mulatto or the
Negro to make his way upward in the old-time
Brazilian society but such opportunities were then
open to very few. The great families always had
their coloured proves-adoptive children, god-
children, sometimes their own illegitimate
offspring, or those who were singled out from
others of their colour for their intelligence or
their devoted attachment to the family. Such
children were sent to school or found a job in
government service, so that the old families all
had a number of Negroes who advanced socially
under their protection. But these where only the
"elite", and the improvement in the position of
the favoured few did nothing for the mass of their
fellows, who remained in slavery. Industrialization
and the growth of cities, and the labour legislation
which applies to all workers, irrespective of colour
or origin, are now helping to improve the posi-
tion of the coloured people as a whole, rather
than that of a few isolated individuals.
It is obvious, however, that for this very reason
the whites are bound to feel that the privileged
situation they enjoyed in the past is threatened,
and they will try to defend their governing posi-
tions against the increasing numbers of black or
brown competitors. They will seek to put up bar-
riers at least to retard, if not to arrest, the move-
ment. But how can they do this in a democratic
country like Brazil where all mention of colour
is taboo and where the old tradition of friendly
relations between whites and Negroes continues
to exist ? They can only do this by indirect, round-
about ways, by rejecting, on medical grounds, for
example, a successful Negro candidate in a compe-
titive examination. There is thus a policy of
directing coloured workers into certain branches
of industry, such as the building trade or hard
and dirty types of work for which the whites are
not anxious to compete. I myself have known of
several coloured men with academic qualifications
who tried to get"white collar"jobs but finally
had to put up with sweeping floors or acting as
doormen.
The basis and grounds for this policy are to be
found in stereotypes and ideologies, which vary
in different sections of the population. In the old
traditional families, which are accustomed to
submissive affection from the Negroes under their
protection, there is a reaction against the arrog-
ance and aggressiveness of the new generation
of Negroes, a desire to maintain the old patriar-
chal control and to compel the Negro to"keep
his place". Among the descendants of immi-
grants, the struggle to make a living, the compe-
tition for the best jobs and the effort to find work
for newly-arrived compatriots lead them to stress
the"technical inferiority"or the'''unprepossessing
appearance"of the Negro. In addition, for cer-
tain children of foreigners, becoming assimilated
Brazilians has had a tendency to mean acquiring
the outlook of Brazilian society of the past and
adopting the ideas and feelings of the old ruling
class which held sway when slavery still existed.
In spite of ail this, however, with the spread of
education, with the influence of the war which
speeded up both industrialization and the inllux
of needed labour from Europe, with the competi-
tion between political parties and their increasing
bids to the electorate, the Negro has managed to
make his way into positions which he could never
have hoped to reach in the past. The whites have
therefore been compelled to revise their conven-
tional views, to acknowledge the worth of their
coloured colleagues in the office, and even, in some
cases, to take orders from Negroes who have
proved to be more capable.
The whites then usually fall back on a second
line of defence ; they respect official superiors
whose skin is darker than their own, they treat
their coloured colleagues in the office or factory
on the same terms as their white colleagues, but
they do not invite them into their homes. In the
sphere of family or social life, there is a barrier
which the white can pass but not, as a general
rule, the Negro. This attitude is found even among
the working classes. Sports clubs accept Negro
athletes in their games but they will not admit
them to the dances they run, and even less to
their swimming pools. Professional associations
exclude from their social functions those whose
skin is too dark.
This semi-voluntary segregation and the whole
phenomenon of Negro segregation is particularly
striking to the observer of Sao Paulo since it is in
complete opposition to the status of the Negro in
the rest of Brazil. Let us not be led to believe
that the phenomenon in Sao Paulo is simply a
question of class, with the Negroes at the lowest
stratum of society and the whites, occupying a
higher position, anxious to avoid a degrading
contamination. The coloured middle classes are
also excluded and, as their members do not wish
to be assimilated to the lower class, and as the
whites spurn them, they have been obliged to
organize their own recreational clubs.
It would be wrong, however, to exaggerate the
effect of this segregation. The sexual attraction
which, under the Empire, brought about the
mingling of races of different colour and so pre-
vented the formation of distinct castes, is still in
operation to encourage intermarriage, though pos-
sibly mainly among the lower classes and in
illegitimate relationships. Marriages do also take
place, however, between dark-skinned and lighter-
skinned people, the difference in colour being
offset by the economic advantages which the
darker partner can offer. A study of the census
returns for the population of Sao Paulo, and a
comparison of the birth and mortality figures for
Negroes and mulattoes, prove that a certain
number of coloured people cross the dividing line
each year and are absorbed into the white popu-
lation. This is not simply a question of statistics
but of their own outlook and of the attitude of
other people towards them. By this I mean that,
living in the impersonal atmosphere of a big city
where it is impossible to keep track of family
descent, they will be treated as whites and, at the
same time, they will adopt the white man's dero-
gatory stereotypes and prejudices against those
who have remained on the other side of the colour
barrier.
North American sociologists have given the
name of"transition societies"to these commu-
nities where the social structure is undergoing an
upheaval through the action of new economic
factors while many traditional values still sur-
vive. The city of Sao Paulo is an instance of such
a society in transition, where the patriarchal way
of life is succumbing to economic competition, and
the formation of social classes is undermining the
domination of the old rural aristocracy. The
colour prejudice which served to justify slavery
for the Negro is now out of date. It is changing
into class prejudice to justify white retention of
the governing or controlling positions in society.
Nevertheless, the democratic laws of Brazil and
the development of industrialization, with the
accompanying demand for more labour, are
helping to improve the position of the coloured
people as a whole. The classic master-and-man
relations is no longer applicable to the relations
between whites and blacks at work. This
accounts for the reluctance of the white man to
share his social life with the Negro and for his
desire to put the latter"in his place". It also
accounts for the uneasiness of the black man ;
he may still, in some cases, make his way up-
wards, as in the past, through the patronage of
a white but, in others, he may give way to resent-
ment at the obstacles he encounters in his efforts
to rise in the social scale, and in turn may deve-
lop racial prejudices of his own against the
Negro. The unifying forces and the forces of
segregation are thus accentuated and intensified
in the tangled relationships of city life. The ideo-
logical chaos is indicative of the conflict between
opposing social trends. Yet the coloured man has
glimpsed a better world, even though the way to
it lies through the sufferings of a painful period
of transition, in which outworn prejudices seek
to stave off final defeat by assuming a new guise
seemingly even more intense than the old ; a
period, in particular, in which those prejudices,
even when weakened, are felt more bitterly by
men and women who have been taught by free-
dom the meaning of human dignity.
Brazil is one of the rare countries which have achieved racial harmony and racial democracy. Although a few discordant notes can be found
in white-Negro relations in certain large, industrialized towns, they are in complete opposition to the status of the Negro in the rest of Brazil.

RACE RELATIONS
IN BRAZIL
.
RIO D JANEIRO
MELTING-POT OF PEOPLES
By Professor L. A. COSTA PINTO
University of Brazil, Rio de Janeiro
THE racial situation in Rio de Janeiro
offers some striking analogies with
what has been written about that in
Sao Paulo. In Rio, just as in Sao
Paulo, the harmonious integration which is
regarded as characteristic of inter-racial rela-
tionships in Brazil fails to correspond to facts
revea ! ed by sociological investigations.
It has been said to often and for so long that
racial prejudices do not exist in Brazil, that thisaffinnation which has
been passed around the
world has finally become
a source of Brazilian na-
tional pride. Yet, behind
this piece of dogma lie
feelings of bitterness and
an obvious uneasiness. To
describe this phenomenon,
we might well use the
expression"nyptomelan-
ism", which was applied
by the soeiologist Renzo
Sereno to Puerto Rico.
The word denotes the fear
to admit or the desire to
hide the importance which
is, in fact, attached to the
question of race and of
colour. Such a refusal to
face up to reality spring
from various causes. The
first must be sought in
the extreme forms taken
by racialism in other
countries by comparison
with which Brazil's situa-
tion takes on the air of a
model of tolerance and
harmony. Yet if the situa-
tions of the United States
and Brazil are placed side
by side, it can be seen that
the differences are of
degree rather than of
nature. They are differ-
ences of degrees easy to
identify in one country or
the other according to the
areas examined.
There is no question of
persecutions or even of
brutal discrimination, but
of a series of small facts
of greater or less import-
ance, more or less gene-
ralized and more or less
frequent which by their
sum total develop among
the members of a racial
group the feeling that they
may, at any moment, be
exposed to injustice or
even to discourtesy simply
because of their racial
origin. It is this insecur-
ity which produces in many Negroes a serious
state of anxiety, of fear and instability. Even
though someone may never have suffered from
another person's lack of respect for him or may
never have been snubbed because of his colour,
the threat of this is sufficient to put him on
the defensive and to give him a feeling of
victimization.
What seems typical of the Brazilian situation
is not the complete lack of prejudice, but the
absence of violence in the forms of discrimina-
tion shown to the Negro.
First of all it should be made clear that the
appearance of a new racial situation which can
be observed in Rio de Janeiro is directly related
to the influx from the countryside into the
Brazilian capital of people attracted by the
possibilities opened up to them by a rapidly
developing industry.
As a very large proportion of these emigrants
from the interior of the country is made up
of coloured people, it follows that the urban
proletariat is also made up to a great extent of
Negroes or mulattos. Statistics bring the
picture even more clearly into perspective.
They show that the number of Negroes who can
be classed as employers is insignificant in
comparison with the mass of coloured
employees, and that posts of authority in
industry, trade and agriculture are, with very
few exceptions, occupied by white people.
The men of colour who have succeeded in
rising above the general mass of the people and
in establishing themselves in the higher ranks
of the social scale represent"honourable
exceptions"'\vhich can give rise to no illusions
about the true state of the racial situation.
These men, who appear to have successfully
overcome barriers raised against them because
of the colour of their skin, underwent a
process of"whitening"and in proportion to
their rise in the social scale were treated as
if they had been white.
Alongside this long-standing elite which the
upper classes of the community accept and
regard as the symbol of their own liberal
outlook, is rising a new Negro elite which,
while wishing to progress, in no way desires to
renounce its"Negro consciousness". In its
march forward, this group runs into prejudices
expressed as racial stereotypes. Before this
barrier its reaction to the problem confronting
it takes the form of an awareness of race.
The ideology which Negro intellectuals have
built around the idea of"Negro consciousness"
is the form taken by this race consciousness
forced on the coloured elite. Its development
has been made possible because the whites
themselves sowed the seeds of the idea in the
very midst of the Negro"intelligenzia."-For,
just as one can say that the Negro problem is,
above all, that of the white man who has
mistaken ideas about Negroes and who acts on
the basis of these false ideas, so one can also
affirm that the idea of"Negro consciousness"
is not of Negro origin but merely a Negro
reflection of the ideas'which white men have
about him and also the result of his race
consciousness which has been developed by the
obstacles he has met throughout life.
It is these obstacles which are at the root of
racial ideology and which make of race a
mystic entity, mystic in the sense that it
transposes a daily experience into something
on the imaginative leve). It is of Htt) e import-
ance that these conceptions are naive ones.
The fact is they do exist and the socio-
logist is obliged to recognize their power
and analyze their origin.
It must be understood thai this exaltation of
"Negro consciousness"and the contradictions
which are so apparent in the ideological systems
are, in fact, the expressions, in racial terms, of
the aspirations and disillusions of a middle
class grnup which is try,
ing to rise, not as a race,
hut as a social class.
Their overriding aim is to
obtain for themselves and
their likes the acquisition
of the sort of life led by
the upper and middle
classed which are the
traditionally white classes
of Brazilian society.
While this rise of a
Negro eHte in Brazilian
society is slow, it is
nevertheless cedaintv tak-
ing place in existing
social frameworks and in
accordance with the values
and attitudes which belong
to them.
Progress. in the case of
a Negro who is a member
of the proletariat is limited
by the houndaries of the
particular social group in
which he lives. As one of
this mass of people the
Negro does not suffer
from the same feeling of
oppression and suffocation
of which the"élite"
complain. Me does not
feel, as do the latter, that
he is"two people in one."
He is ; he feels, simply a
Negro of the proletariat.
When he is attacked by
racial prejudice he reacts
simply and directly as an
injured party without in
any'way seeking the
transcendent causes for
the affront he has suffered.
Because racial prejudice
does not appear to him as
a coherent system, but
rather as a series of
incidents, he fights it as
a member of a social
class and not as a member
of a race. Furthermore,
he views his progress
not as something which
has a racial element but
which affects a mass
whose members include
men of other colours.
Brazil has no racialist philosophy to support
or give moral sanction to racial discrimination.
Only the"cryptomelanism", of which I spoke
earlier, had an effect of this kind. There
exists, however, no absolute or hard and fast
values capable of preventing the development
of racial tensions or of ensuring that they do
not lead to catastrophes.
The racial question in Brazil is not a problem
which is independent from others facing the
country. It has not been resolved in some
miraculous fashion, not is it, as some declare,
an unchangeable state of affairs. We would
not say that Brazil has a racial problem, if, by
that, we mean the particular form this question
has taken in other social structures which differ
from our own. nor would we say, in view of
the facts brought to light by our investigation,
that no problem exists. We would simply say
that there does exist a racial question which is
undergoing a process of change and which
displays particular characteristics within any
given social structure. This cannot be sepa-
rated from other present-day tensions.
This interdependence, then, can result in a
crisis or a solution according to the nature of
Brazil's social evolution in the coming years.

COURIER AUGUST-SEPTEMBER 1952. Page
1 :-. ; the United Stales an absolute
"line"is drawn between white
and Negro. A person who is not
white is Negro, wtwtever hi-. small
percentage of Negro blood may be. In
\'ita Reconeavo, a pseudonym given
ill a Unesco study to a town situated
in the zone known as the Recuncavo
which surrounds Salvador, the capital
of the State of Bahia, this'''line''
is recognized rather than drawn. A
distinction between Negro and white
is always kept in mind when class-
fying an individual. Everyone knows.
who is"pure"white and who is not.
Classification by race is one of the
most important aspects of local cul-
ture, and one of the most difficult
aspects for the outsider to grasp.
Bahians of the Recûncavo feel that
one may instantly recognize the dif-
ferenee between a"pure"white and
a mixed white-Indian, white-Negro
or Negro-Indian, but they do not let
it go at that. They classify or des-
cribe minutely each person ; they
classify according to skin colour,
according to hair form and according
to facial features. Their classifica-
tions of racial types are used in
everyday conversation. Just as it
would be said that someone is short
and fat in the United States, the
people of Vila Recòncavo will
describe a person's colour and hair.
In the Rec"ncavo three race slacks
are recognized : the white, the Negro
and the Indian. A white is called a
bl'anco. The Portuguese term negro
is rarely used to denote a person of
African descent. Rather such a per-
son is called homem de côr (man of
colour). Negro is used abstraetly to
denole the Negro race, but it is almost
never used to single out an indivi-
dual. Nego (a softened variation of
the word negro) may frequently be
used as a term of endearment, even
among whites, and it is sometimes
used as a nickname. When a Bahian
of the Reconeavo speaks of indigo, he
usually thinks of the Indian of the
interior of mats gross or of the
Amazon. When he wishes to indicate
people of American Indian physical
type, he generaHy-ays c<W «.
Yet even the whites are sub-classi-
fied, being divided into two cate-
gories, the 101ll'o (blond) <1nd. more-
no (dark). There is still <1 third
term for people with Caucasoid phy-
sical characteristics, but one which
is used only by those who are consi-
dered"pure"white-namely, ? I'all-
co da terry. He is someone who has
the physical characteristics of a
Caucasoid : fair skin, fine features
and"good" (meaning straight) hair
- but whose ancestry has Negro
blood. He or she is generally moreno,
and is frequently characterized by
a slightly yellowish tinge to the skin.
The white'bl' (mco da term sometimes
also shows traces of caboclo blood as
well as Negro and white blood. To
the majority of the population, the
b1'aft'co da terra if ; [llw<1vf ; raIled
white, and no-one would ever call
anyone a bnanco da terra to his face.
He is accorded the same treatment as
is any white hv both whites and non-
whites, and there is no constraint on
anyone's part.
In classifying people, skin colour is
an important factor but hair form is
equally important. If there is any
question as to what to call a person,
generally I she hair is the deriding cri-
terion. Aft 1'1'skin and hair, facial
fentures (prognathism, nose shape
and tliirkness of lips) are considered.
The many designations used in ViI<1
RecÙnravo for the people of Negroid
or mixed ancestry can be broken
down roughly into'the fottowing types
in terms of these various criterion :
j. Thp} m'lo (hl<1rk) has black
shiny skin, kinky. woolly Iwir, thirk
lips and a flat broad nose. The pl'e-
tos distinguish among themselves,
having what they call qualidadc, or
SHADES OF COLOUR
AND OF MEANING
by Harry W. HUTCHINSON
quality. and they rank themselves
according to minute differences in
quality of skin colour or nose form.
The pnto wit h (he most qllali-
datil'is the farthest from the u"ual
concept of a : \, egl'ü, Imt is a"prettier"
back.
2. The cabra (feminine, cabl'oclta)
is generally filightly lighter than the
]) I'ctO, with hair growing somewhat
longer, but still kinky and unmanage-
able, and with facial features less
Xegroid, atthough often with fairly
thick lips and flat nose. He general-
Iv lacks the definite features and
'hille of the pl'cfu.
3. T ! le ('obo 1'/, J' {/c is slight Iv light-
er than t he piTt 0, but still very dark.
But he has long straight hair, and
his facia) features are apt to be very
fine, with thin lips and a narrow
straight nose. He is almost a"black
white man"..
4. The 1'8Cl1ro,-or simply"dark
man", is darker than the usual run
"I'1II1'. I'tiro. l', hut tile tileI'm is gene-
rally applied to a person who does
not fit into one of the three types
mentioned above. The.'dark man"
is not a Negro with Caucasoid fea-
tures, but he almost is. He gene-
rally has qualidad1', Etc-pro is a very
useful term for the outsider in the
Reconcavo.
5. The mulato is a category always
divided into two types, the nwlato
escw'o and lIIulato ela/'o (dark and
light mulattoes). The mulato has
hair which grows perhaps to should-
er length, but which has a decided
curl and even kink. It can, however,
be straightened. The mulato's facial
features vary widely ; thick lips with
a narrow nose, or vice-versa. As a
rule, the features are thicker than
the white's, and thinner than the
negro's. The mulato is-generally
distinguishable by a yellowish tinge
to his skin colour, varying from very
light to very dark. A lIIuwto clarõ,
with straightened hair, thin lips and
a"good"nose is very much like the
branco d (l term.
6. Pardo is a term not often used
in speech. It i's one of the official
classifications used in the census and
on identification papers. However,
it is used o (' ( ; asionallv to describe an
individual who is closer to the white
than a light mulatto. Occasionally
/Ilcstico hildl'en are described as
pardo'during IIIe early year""j'theil'
life, before their features become
distinctive enough to fit them defi-
nitely into one of the other groups.
In one case, a little girl of three was
called pan/a by her mother. The girl
lives with her godfather, who is a
brrll1co ria tCI'I'a. He lists the girl as
whites, since her skin is very light
and her hair is growing long and
only sliglltly wavy. But her mother
says she is a parrla because she
knows that"her hair may curl up
any day, which would make her a
lIIutata dal'a."
7. The Mt'ara is not difficult to dis-
tinguish. He has very light skin, and
hair which is reddish or blondish
but kinkv or curled. His hair is des-
crihed as sura, or hard. His facial
features are extremely varied, even
more so than the s. Tfiere
are sarOl'as,.... ho would"pass"for
white in the United States, but more
often they have a curious appear-
ance ; skin which is neither dark nor
tight, frequently freckled, eye, with
a'greenish-btue cast and hair which
bteacheseasityinthesun.
8. The morena has excellent skin,
fine-textured and smooth. He is
light-skinner but not white. He has
dark hair, which is iong and either
wavy or eurty. It is manageable and
does'not need straightening. His fea-
tures are much more Caucasoid than
Negroid. Here again we can distin-
guish between the dark and light
1// (/I'cn6s. Also we must distinguish
between the morcno mulato and the
/I/O/'enu of the white families-the
morcno braneo. M. oren'o, as used
regarding the"white", distinguishes
the brown from the blond of the
same group.
Few people fit any of these
"racial"types one hundred percent.
When some one comes very close to
being a perfect preto-that is, has
all the characteristics of the reto-
people call him bem PI'uto or bent
prct inh 0 (really btack). The same
IS true of the Mrara-bem sÇl./'ará,
or of the moreno, who will be called
hem moreninho or mm'eno fino. It is
just as difficult to find the perfect
type for the other classifications,
because there are so many variations.
many times one must point out that
an individual is of one physical type,
but has one or more characteristics
of another type. For instance, one
young man in Vila Reconcavo has the
characteristics of an eseul'O, but
since most people like him they like
to think of him as 1IWI'eIW. He has
line skin and thin facial features, but
has tight kinky hair. People gene-
rally refer to him as moreno, adding
"hut he has poor hair."One fre-
quently hears he is"Ill ulato, but
very light."These verbal descrip-
tions paint a vivid picture of the
person in question. In Vila Recon-
cavo, it is not simply a matter of
black and white, but of all the
shades in between.
A term of classification not listed
above, cabIJc/o. presents something
uf a special case. As mentioned
earlier, most people with Indian
physical traits have come into the
Reròncavo region from the dry
hinterland during the dry spells of
the l\'orth. Considering the length
of time that people of the north
have been periodically coming into
the Reconcavo region,'comparativety
few have remained. Neverthetes-.
the population of Vila Recòncavù
shows a considerable caboclo ele-
ment-that is, of people with a
reddish or bronze tinge of their skin
colour, more prominent cheek bones
than the African or white element.
and a tendencv toward an a) mond-
shaped eye. However, few people
in Vila Reccincavo bearing these
marks are called caboc/os. They
are classified instead in the toca'
terms listed above, ignoring Ameri-
can Indian traits. In Vila RecòlI-
cavo, there i : : ; a certain dispraise of
the rabacla. He is considered less
civilized than the resident of the
Reconeavo. He is often known as a
better worker, more ambitious,
trustworthy, more frugal and less
genial than the easygoing person of
the Rel'ÒI1l'avo. In the rural area of
Vila RecÒncavo, each year many
cabacla men come to the plantations
to work during hanest time. For
the most part they stay together,
away from the resident'worker of
the plantation.
There is a mutual desire to keep
apart, for while the resident worker
looks down on the cabaclo, the
caboclo feels very much the same
about the locnl'people. He feels
that they are lazy, ignorant, and
above all superstitious. The cabo-
cla 1'aqllcil'o (north eastern cowboy)
of one., plantation says that the
workers of the plantation are always
talking about black magic, that they
are lazy and'spendthrifts, and at the
same time deride his frugality. He
says he is not afraid of their black
magic, since he knows there is
nothing to it, but he does not
understand it, and distrusts those
who speak of it. People in Vila
Reconcavo will not admit they have
cabocla or Indian blood ancestors.
One young girt who is almost a per-
fect American Indian type says she
is a I/Illlatinha or little 1nulata.
(Using the diminutive form seems to
he a softer and more agreeable way
of saying mlllato.) She vehemently
denied there was anv Indian blood in
her family, hut finally reluctantly
admitted that a great-grandparent
of hers had been partly Indian. This
girls's niece would make a perfect
double for the popular conception of
Pocahontas, given a feather in her
hair and n sarong, but she is con-
sidered a"1IIulata, ahnost morM."
However, among the"pure"whites
there is a different feeling about the
(' (Iboclo. White fnmilies say that
they would feel proud to know that
they have"Indian blood"for it
would indicate the length of time
their familv has been in Brazil.
Frequently a white child is extreme-
ly"Indian looking", that is, a
1I1O/'Cno with jet btack, straight hair.
The nickname of tapllya is often
given to this type which is generally
admired by the whites. And all
plantation owners agree that, for
work, no-one can top the caboclo.
The north eastern worker of Ameri-
can Indian physical type will go into
the fields at six in the morning and
not return until six at night. He
takes his lunch with him and eats it
there. On the other hand, the
resident worker will go to the fields
at six and return at noon. However,
as permanent resident workers,
plantation owners will prefer the
Negroes of the Reconcavo. Little if
any effort is made to'''fix''the
raboclo on the plantations. When
the harvest is finished, he takes his
money and departs. Next year he
may come again to the same plan-
tation, or he may not. It seems to
make little difference to either party.

RACE RELATION
I N BRA Z I L
..
,
ATTITUDES
IN THE'BACKLANDS'
B RAZlL is a living example of
how a nation composed of
people of diverse racial
stocks need not be split by
tensions, segregation, or discrimi-
nation between racial groups.
In this vast country,. however,
there are striking contrasts from
region to region, as well as between
the cosmopolitan cities and the small
towns and rural homesteads of the
interior. Like other aspects of the
Brazilian social scene, the patterns
of race relations may be expected to
vary within the common framework
of national life. Differences in
ethnic composition, living standards,
the extent of industrialization, and
receptiveness to foreign ideas
further complicate the problem of
generalizing on a national scale.
It is not surprising, therefore, that
there are'wide gaps in our infor-
mation. This was, until a short
time ago, especially true of our
knowledge of race relations in the
interior portions of the country.
Since over 70 per cent of Brazil's
approximately 50, 000, 000 people live
in towns with fewer than 5, 000 inha-
bitants, or on scattered farms and
plantations, studies of the rural
population were particularly urgent.
In 1950 and 1951 such studies were
carried out by the Fundaçao para 0
Desenvolvimento da Ciencia na
Bahia and the Department of An-
thropology of Columbia University,
in co-operation with Unesco. Three
smaU communities in different
regions of northern Brazil were
covered. A fourth anthropological
"community study"was made in
1948 as one of the surveys for the
International Hylean Amazon Insti-
tute sponsored by Unesco.
A report based upon these studies
has already been received by
Unesco.'Called Race and Class in
Rural Brazil it includes articles on
a traditional plantation community
of the Bahian area (Vila Reconcavo),
an old mining town of the Brazilian
plateau (Minas Velhas), a character-
istic community of the arid north
eastern sertao (Monte Serrat), and
a community situated along the
Amazon River, (Ita). These studies
were prepared respectively by Harry
W. Hutchinson, Marvin Harris, Ben
Zimmerman, and Charles Wagley.
Each is a first-hand"case study"
of race relations in a representative
community of an important region
of north Brazil. There are differ-
ences from one community to an-
other, and from one region to an-
other ; but the common patterns of
race relations which emerge from a
comparison of all four communities
seem to be basic traditions shared
by a significant segment of the Bra-
zilian nation.
In all of the communities included
in our research programme, it was
observed that the most important
principle governing relatioqs be-
tween people was membership of
a social class rather than"race".
People are assigned a place in the
social hierarchy depending on their
income, occupation, level of educa-
tion, family connections and finally,
but only of equal importance with
these qualifications, on their"race".
Considered separately from the
other criteria, the qualities popularly
associated with the various racial'
types stand out as evidence for a
mild form of race prejudice. Phy-
sical characteristics are rated higher
as they approach the white model,
and lower as they approach the
Negro or (in the Amazon) the In-'
dian. Thus people speak of"bad
hair", meaning the kinky hair of
the Negro, and everywhere very
dark skin colour is considered less
desirable than light skin colour.
In addition, psychological fea-
tures, some of them derogatory, are
regularly attributed to the various
races ; the average Negro, for exam-
ple, is considered to be innately less
intelligent than the white. Strictly
speaking, these are prejudices, but
the fact that racial criteria are regu-

larly weighed against the other
components of the over-all social
ranking system greatly diminishes
their effect upon actual behaviour.
In the old mining community of
Minas Velhas, for example, a man
who told us that he would never
welcome a Negro in his home, soon
afterwards entertained a Negro
engineer with the utmost respect
and cordiality. In concrete social
situations, other qualities such as
wealth, education, family member-
ship, personal attachments, and
politics seem to determine the way
people treat one another rather than
"race".
Instances in which race preju-
dice enters into actual behaviour
are not, however, entirely lacking.
Occasional tension occurs at the
margin of the upper class, where, if
other criteria have not been met deci-
sively, the racial factor is liable to
assume critical and disputed propor-
tions. Peoples who are clearly lower
class do not try to compete with the
upper class, but those striving to
enter the upper class or to attain
socÎ1d pl'Ominence in their commu-
nity do, as elsewhere, compete
\'.'uh one another.
It was at this point in the social
hierarchy that"race"was often
found to be the crucial qualification
for social success, when participa-
tion in festive ceremonies, appoint-
ment to political office, or marriage
with an economic equal were at
stake. On the other hand, if the eco-
nomic and educational criteria are
clearly and undoubtedly satisfied,
dark-skinned individuals easily
cross the threshold of the upper
class and are fully accepted.
Thus in all of the communities
studied there are"people of colour"
by Charles WAGLEY
Columbia University
in the upper class groups-indivi-
duals of relatively high income,
engaged in a"white collar"occupa-
tion, who are literate, related in one
way or another to an important local
family and'who are Negro, mulatto,
or caboclo (American Indian) in
appearance. Though their achieve-
ment of high social rank may be
more difficult, it is possible.
Despite the relative unimportance
of racial criteria so far as rank is
concerned, the majority of the
people in the upper class groups
of their respective communities are
European in appearance. In other
words, the"people of colour"gene-
rally do occupy positions that are
socially, economically and educa-
tionally inferior. It would be a
mistake, however, to regard this
correlation between race and class
as being wholly or largely the effect
of a mild race prejudice.
The causes of this situation must
be sought for rather in the slowness
with which economic and educa-
tional advantages have been
extended to those who are but third
or fourth generation descendants of
slaves and of primitive Indians.
The principal barrier to social
improvement is not race prejudice,
but the inherited disadvantage of
the non-European in terms of edu-
cation and wealth.
Of fundamental importance in
this respect is the fact that there is
no institutionalized segregation or
occupational and educational discri-
mination based on"race"alone.
Apparent instances of segregation
do occur when poor people who-are
also"people of colour"occupy
certain districts of the towns. But)
in fact, segregation on any large
scale would be impossible here.
There is no simple two-or three-
fold classification of racial types
which would permit the parcelling
of people into residential districts,
different schools, churches and
other such arrangements. There
are, instead, numerous physical
types, such as the to'anco (Euro-
pean), the mulatto, the moreno
eSCU1'O (dark brown), the morena
claro (light brown), the cabo
verde (dark skin, but European
features), the sai'ara (light skin but
Negro features), the caboclo (Ameri-
can Indian features), and the pardo
(brown), to mention only a few. It
is hard to imagine a"Jim Crow"
system in these circumstances.
The recognition of so many
intermediate types shows in one
sense an acute awareness of racial
differences. People go so far as
habitually to identify others in
conversation by referring to their
physical type.
"Aqllf'le mlllato"or"aqucle ca-
boclo"is mentionned in much the
same way as other people speak of
"that tall, thin fellow".
One of the important lessons
which a study of Brazil can teach
us is that intense awareness of racial
differences need not necessarily be
accompanied by an equal intensity
of prejudice or discrimination.
In rural Brazil,"people of
colour"may improve their social
status by improving their economic,
educational, and occupational posi-
tion. As the Brazilian economy
continues to expand, and educational
and economic opportunities become
more widely distributed, the people
of dark skin colour who now occupy
the lower ranks of society should
tend to take their places with the
more'privileged groups.
rural Brazil is not totally free of
prejudice and discrimination based
on race, but on the whole, the
traditional patterns of race relations
present in these rural communities
are a rich social heritage from
which the world has much to learn.t

RACE RELATIONS
· · ·
inc- : .-'<,"< (Continued) BAHIA
THE NEGRO
METROPOLIS
by Thales de AZEVEDO
of the University of Bahia, Brazil
THE best type of social
relationship between whites
and coloured people is pro-
bably to be found in
the regions colonized by the
Portuguese during the last four
centuries. This, for example, was
the impression which André Sieg-
fried formed after his travels round
the word.
Brazil, the biggest nation that the
Portuguese discovered and popu-
lated, is no exception to this rule.
In fact, one of the characteristics
of Brazilian cultural life is the
harmonious way the various
ethnic groups of native, European,
African and, more recently, Asiatic
origin, live together.
In pther lands too, it is true,
whites of different origin and
people of various colour groups,
live together peacefully and
without tension ; but in few parts
of the world today is the relation-
ship between whites and coloured
people (and especially the descend-
ants of African slaves) better
than in Brazil.
Active racial prejudices do not
really exist in Brazil, much less
any organized or open struggle
between whites and Negroes even
in those parts of the country, such
as the south-central and eastern
States, where Negroes are most
numerous.
Of all parts of Brazil, the State
of Bahia is undoubtedly the most
typical of Negro-white race rela-
tions. Its population consists for
the most part of white descendants
of the Portuguese, Negroes whose
ancestors were slaves brought
from Guinea and Angola, and
mulattos who are the result of the
constant lnesticagem (intermar-
riage) which has been going on
between whites and Negroes since
the middle of the 16th century.
(In fact, early colonial laws
banning the marriage of free men
and stave had become a dead
letter long before these laws were
done away with.)
If anything now tends to lessen
intermarriage, it is not so much
colour prejudice as the social
barriers fostered by class feeling.
Even this, however, is not very
strong, although it is unquestion-
ably stronger than colour prejudice
as such.
In Bahia, the capital of the State
of the same name, and one of the
most important cities of Brazil, a
little more than one-third of the
population of 400, 000 is white.
Twenty per cent is Negro, while
mestizos total about 47 per cent.
The number of whites is increas-
ing slowly-as slowly as theNegro population is decreasing ;
but mulattoes of all shades are
increasing at an ever mounting
rate which has now reached the
highest fIgure for all Brazil. This
is true even when compared to the
rate observed in those regions
where the greatest proportion of
Negroes live, such as the States of
Maranhào and Piaui in the far
north.
However, far more characteristic
than race mixture which is very
frequent in the lower levels of the
population but decreases in inten-
sity at the upper levels, are the
possibilities of advancement which
coloured people have in their local
communities. Since these commu-
nities are made up of multi-racial
classes in which caste is non-
existent, a man of colour can, as
the sociologist Donald Pierson has
shown"by reason of individual
merit or favourable circumstance,
improve his status and even
achieve position in the upper levels
of society and this position will
then be with reference not merely
to the darker group whose colour
he shares but to the total com-
munity." (1).
. A simple accident'
HAVT"IG more or less dark skinis regarded as"a simple
accident"of physical nature
which has nothing to do with
one's moral qualities or intellectual
ability. It does not predetermine
a person's social position but only
conditions it. For it is a symbol
or the low status which the major-
ity of the Negroes and mulattoes
have occupied throughout Brazilian
history as contrasted to the whites
who, despite the same political and
economic factors, were always
the dominant class of Brazilian
society.
Because of this, the lighter
skinned"wJÜter". mulattos find it
easiest to rise in the social scale.
In fact, when by reason of their
wealth, their talent, their political
influence or their university
degrees they reach a high position,
they are no longer considered
mulattos oj'mpsti : ; os, but whites.
It would be considered impertinent

and inelegant to remind such a
person of his ethnic background.
As in any other part of Brazil,
all racial groups mix freely in
theatres and cinemas, cafés and
restaurants, public conveyances,
churches, schools and in the
armed forces. This can be obseryed
more especially in Bahia where in
addition it causes less surprise
than elsewhere and where the
improvement in social position of
dark-skinned people is taken as a
natural thing.
Education is most important if
this improvement is to take place,
however. Bahians are fond of
saying that differences in their
social position are only a question
of education ; that anyone can rise
if he has reached a certain level
of instruction or professional
training and his moral conduct is
compatible with accepted local
patterns. Although the great ma-
jority of darker skinned coloured
people and mulattos are concen-
trated in the lower levels of society,
and in the lowest, humblest
occupations, many are to be found
in practically all the professions
which enjoy prestige.
Professions bring prestige
T IIl'S, coloured citizens work,not only with one another but
also among whites, as doctors,
judges, lawyer, engineers, uni-
yersity professors, priests, poli-
ticians, high government officials,
and-although relatiwly less
frequent-as businessmen, indus-
trialists, bankers and army officers.
Once they are classed as part of
these groups, they can enter scien-
tific societies, literary academies,
and the leading social and sporting
clubs.
It is to a great extent through the
liberal professions that poor
coloured people can achieve social
position. Among the poets, writers,
scientists and statisticians, whose
activities are a source of pride to
the people of Bahia and many
other Brazilians, there are many
coloured men-sometimes very
dark skinned and unmistakeably
Negro.
This is no romantic picture of
life in Bahia, painted with im-
pressions of hurried observation 01'
uncritical admiration but the result
of sociological inquiries based on
direct verification of the racial
composition of different"prestige"
groups and organizations in the
educational, sports, religious, poli-
tical, administrative and economic
fields. The writer of this article
himself undertook one of these
inquiries last year, under Unesco
auspices, as part of the programme
of social research in the State of
Bahia undertaken by the Founda-
tion for the Development of
Science in Bahia (Fundaçao ]JGra 0
Desenrolrimento da Ciencia na
l3ahia) in co-operation with Co-
lumbia University.
It must be pointed out, however,
that inter-racial relations in Bahia
are not entirely free from friction
and discrimination, but these are
often confused with antagonisms
of class. An analysis of the local
customs and social structure
shows that there are certain points
of resistance to the social rise of
individuals with the most pro-
nounced Negro traits. It reveals
that there are people in Bahia who
blame the Negroes for the eco-
nomic back hardness of the region,
as compared with other parts of
Brazil where industrialization and
economic advancement are much
more rapid.
In the upper class of society,
for example, inter-marriage runs
against barriers which at times are
extremely powerful, so that one
usually hears it said that except in
the case of marriage, no colour
prejudice really exists in Bahia.
In spite of this, however, a mulatto
who exercises a liberal profession
and who has a certain level of
income can marry an"aristo-
cratic"white girl-that is-one
of authentic European origin and
unquestionable white traits.
Paradoxical attitudes
MARRIAGE is the touchstoneof inter-racial relations. In
Bahia, the number of mixed
marriages is very high (about 20
per cent of all marriages), and the
social forces which formely ope-
rated to prevent them are now
diminishing.
There are coloured men with
responsible positions who marry
white women or at least girls with
skins much lighter than their own,
and for many of these men inter-
marriage opens the door to better
social standing.
A curious fact has been revealed
by a study of such cases. It shows
that a coloured man who marries
a white woman or a woman
of whiter skin than his own, is
much less likely to meet with
opposition from his wife's family
than is the dark-skinned woman
from the family of the white man
she marries.
These two attitudes which seem
paradoxical, are explained by the
fact that married couples in Bahia
live much more under the influence
of the wife's family than the hus-
band's, and the married man is
inevitably drawn more closely
into the family circle of his wife.
A coloured man is consequently
"raised in position"by joining the
family of a lighter-skinned or
white wife,'whereas a white man
who weds a dark-skinned woman
"steps down from his class". As
a popular Bahian proverb puts it,
"When a girl marries, her family
acquires a new son". By the same
token, a young man joins the
coloured community from'which
his wife happens to come.
But this occurs not only when
two different racial groups are
concerned, but also with different
social classes. Marriages between
educated and refined young men
(who happen to be poor) and rich
girls, are regarded more favour-
ably than those between men from
the upper classes and'women of a
lower class-regardless of colour.
The important thing is that the
man must be"educated and refin-
ed", so as to make up for his
poverty or his colour. In a sense,
therefore, he offers his"good cha-
racter"in exchange for his wife's
fortune and high social standing,
or her lighter skin colour-which-
ever the case may be.
These few examples show that
even though colour prejudices may
exist, they are not strong enough to
prevent inter-racial marriages in
the upper levels of society.
The fact is that antagonisms
between individuals and groups of
different racial stock is reduced to
a minimum in Bahia. Moreover,
they are further attenuated by the
process of adaptation and adjust-
ment which similarly affects other
aspects of social life, so that
competition tends to lose its
aggressiveness and conflicts much
of their bitterness. The people of
Bahia finally are very proud of
their traditions of tolerance and of
the absence among them of any
"racialism".

AROUND THE WORLD
to mail a letter or a newpaper to a friendon the other side of the globe is a
simple, everyday affair. So simple,
indeed, that few of us ever realize that it
took many centuries for the postal service
to achieve its present reliability and effi-
ciency, and to grow into the vast and com-
plex system which now spans the world.
For thousands of years, primitive man was
limited for his means of communication to
smoke signals, tom-toms and stick messages.
It was only when Middle Eastern scholars
devized the first form of writing that mail
services by runner or horseman began to be
organized. From this humble beginning, the
post has developed into one of the most
effective instruments of civilization.
Many nations have contributed to the ad-
vancement of this oldest of public services,
and today the world's postal systems, grouped
under the Universal Postal Union (UPU), play
a vital role in promoting the free flow of
word and image. It is only within the past
60 years that printed materials have enjoyed
low postal rates in more than a few coun-
tries. Until then, they were usually mailed
at the more costly letter rate. And it is
only within the past 150 years that the letter
post itself has been made available to people
generally. Before then the post was in most
cases reserved for royatty, the aristocracy and
State officials.
The first recorded post was founded about
500 B. C. by Darius the Great of Persia, who
used relays of horsemen to send messages
throughout his vast empire, ranging from
India to western Egypt. Macedonian, Egypt-
ian and Roman rulers followed suit. The
Chinese emperors then devised an e ! obo-
rate courier system, which Marco Polo des-
cribed centuries later during his journey to
the court of the Grand Khan.
The Romans raised the imperial post to a
height of efficiency surpassed only in
modern times. Julius Caesar's tetters to
Cicero, written from Britain, reached Rome
in 26 days. Letters carried along the same
route were still taking a month as late as
1800.
The word"post"dates from the Roman
period. It is derived from the Latin posifuS
meaning'''placed'', because horses were
placed at set distances to carry dispatches.
Private persons employed slaves to carry
letters or entrusted them to obliging travel-
lers. Around 300 A. D. the Emperor Diocte-
tion started the first public post for Roman
citizens.
With the fall of the Roman empire, the
European post collapsed, though Charle-
magnepartly restored it during the eighth
century. Medieval rulers maintained royal
couriers, but no regular public post. Mer-
chant's guilds in England, France, Germany
and Italy conducted private services, and
from the l3th century right up to the revolu-
tion of 1789 the University of Paris main-
tained an international post for its cosmo-
politan body of students and professors.
By 1550, royal couriers in England, France
and Spain were permitted to carry private
letters. Queen Elizabeth's master of posts
authorized his messengers to convey private
mail by cutter to the Continent. The Em-
peror Charles V had meanwhile extended the
German post to Austria and Holland.
In 1635 Britain's postmaster, Thomas
Witherings established a public service be-
tween London and Edinburgh. Rates, payable
by the recipient, were 2d for a letter conveyed
under 80 miles and 8d to Scotland. Wither-
ings also organized a foreign service through
France, with the consent of the French
Government.
Cardinal Mazarin, Prime Minister under
Louis Xt !) and Louis XIV, was responsible for
improving the parcel post in France. In 1653
Renouard de Villayer created a local post
for Paris, which was run from a central
office. Under this scheme, the many letter
boxes set up in the streets of Paris were
emptied several times daily. The postal
charge (one sou) was paid by the sender, and
the receipt slip accompanying the delivery
thus constituted the first use of a form of
postage stamp. An English imitator, William
Dockwra, organized a very efficient daily

penny service for the London area, but was
gaoled by James, Duke of York, who enjoyed
a monopoly of postal revenues.
The regular international governmental, or
official, post dates from 1670, when England
and France established the"Lyons Mail"by
special treaty. England provided twice-
weekly mail packets across the Channel, and
France furnished the overland service to
Lyons. Fees to this point were prepaid, but
charges for further transmission were col-
lected from the addresses.
British and French correspondents wel-
comed this innovation. Delays in the foreign
mail had become frequent, and were offi-
cially blamed on irresponsible post-boys who
spent too much time"peddling their own
traffic"and"lying in tippling houses."
A new Anglo-French treaty of 1713 provided
a basis of accounting for transit mails which
continued with little change until 1870.
Letters could be franked to Italy, Spain and
Turkey. Accounting between the English and
French post offices was based on the total
of amounts due on separate letters, mail by
mail.
Queen Anne's postmaster-general had in
1711 reorganized the British post and regu-
lated the services in the North American
colonies and West Indies. The celebrated
Falmouth packets began running from
England to Spain, Portugal and the West
Indies about this time, and by 1800 served a
large part of the world.
To supplement their low pay, the crews of
these little ships often indulged in smuggling
or capturing foreign vessels as prizes of war.
Their activities brought the luckless post-
master-general into frequent conflict with
other government departments, such as the
customs and the navy.
In North America, Benjamin Franklin
expanded the inter-colonial post and in 1755,
as deputy postmaster-general for the colonies,
started a packet service from New York to
England. The Continental Congress founded
an independent American post when war
broke out between Britain and her American
colonies in 1775.
The fate of empires has often depended
on the mails, as was illustrated during
this conflict. In October 1777, General
("Gentleman Johnny") Burgoyne, commanding
loyalist and Indian troops at Saratoga, near
New York, was waiting for General Howe to
advance up the Hudson Valley and
join forces with him. But London officials
failed to send instructions to Howe by fast
ship. The luckless Burgoyne was isolated and
overwhelmed by the Americans.
This victory was a turning point in the war,
for it encouraged France, Spain and Holland
to support the Americans openly. Bernard
Straw incorporated this incident in his play
The Devi/'s Disciple.
By 1790 the British mailcoach service,
founded by William Pitt six years before, was
carrying letters and parcels at half the cost
of the post-boy system. More and more
people were writing"Post-Haste ! * on
their letters. But the rates, based on the
distance carried, rose rapidly during the
Napoleonic wars. In France, the National
Convention put an end to the farming out of
mails to private contractors in 1795, and in
1804 Napoleon established a nationalized
service under a director-general.
By 1835 an Englishman was paying ls 5d
to mail a letter 700 miles, or to receive one.
Sir Rowland Hill, urging that rates should be
based on weight, not on distance carried, pro-
posed the adoption of a uniform led fee, and
prepayment by postage stamps. Both reforms
were in force by 1840 and soon after were
followed in the United States, France and
Germany. Before long, Britain was also first
with cheap rates for newspapers and books.
Trade and communications were expanding
rapidly throughout Europe, and pioneer
settlers were opening up vast new territoires
overseas. Railways and steamships carried
the post faster and in greater volume. Mail
subsidies enabled shipping companies like the
CunardLine, theP. andO., andtheRoya)
Mail Line to start running to the America :
and colonies.
Before this, in 1834, the Canton firm of
Jardine, Mathieson and Company had esta-
blished the famous China Clippers which
raced across the seas under full sail with
cargoes and dispatches.
In Indian, the service started by Lord Clive
in 1766 was following the British example of
low uniform rates, despite the great distances
involved. Stage coaches and horsemen were
carrying mails to isolated settlers in the
United States, Canada, Australia, New
Zealand and South Africa. The Australian
post, founded in 1810 by Governor Macquarie,
had regular sea communication with the
United States by 1866. The post first
employed Maori runners in New Zealand, and
Hottentot post-boys in South Africa.
A famous pioneer service was the"Pony
Express", which carried mails over 2, 000 miles
from St. Joseph (Missouri) to San Francisco
for 16 months during 1860-1861, when it was
replaced by Western Union telegraph.
Eighty riders and 400 horses in relays co-
vered the distances in under ten days,'or one
third the time taken by stage coach. Brav-
ing blizzards, floods and attacks by Indians,
these horsemen won a renown which time has
not diminished.
Another colourful service was the"tin can"
post maintained until recently at the South
SeaistandofTofua, in the Tonga group
Coral reefs prevented ships from approaching
the island closely, so a tin can containing
mail was thrown overboard. The island's
strongest swimmer dashed out through the
surf and towed the mail ashore.
As international mails expanded, more
postal treaties were conclude. But due to
the many differences in rates and procedures
in various countries, rapid and accurate
handling of the mails became almost
impossible. In 1863, at the suggestion of the."'r------_.-..----,--.

national conference in

err 0 a boy 12 years old whocan speak English, Paris,
France."
A letter bearing this address
was recently posted in Kansas
(U. S. A.). In Paris a postal, clerk
glanced at the address, smiled, and
forwarded it immediately to the
French division of the International
Federation of Organizations for
Scholastic Correspondence. He had
handled many such letters-and so
have the postal clerks of most other
countries, for they are written every
day by the school boys and girls of
all five continents to unknown boys
and girls whose languages and coun-
tries they wish to know.
The thirst for knowledge which
these youngsters show is at times
insatiable. Consider this"testimo-
nial"from a young girl :
"Thanks to you, I have found an
American pen-friend. She has sent
me the addresses of others, so now
I keep up a correspondence with
nearly every one of the States ! In
addition, through you, I got to know
an Argentinian, and there is a good
chance that I may one day visit her
country. But my biggest wish is to
learn languages and my latest is
Swedish ; so I am now going to ask
you for a Swedish correspondent. I
hope you can manage this. With the
help of your service, I can perfect
my foreign languages, and I also
have friends pretty well everywhere.
I think International Scholastic
Correspondence is the best example
of world understanding that the
youngsters of today can have, living
as we do in an atmosphere of per-
petual discord."
Teachers are convinced that the
pen-friend scheme has very real edu-
cational value. It awakens a deep
interest in language study. It leads
the young writers to better under-
standing of how other people live.
The exchange of ideas and impres-
sions quickly leads to mutual esteem
and often to personal friendships.
Letters are supplemented'by an
exchange of view cards, magazines,
and other informative matter, and
even by presents and souvenirs. The
friends, especially the girls, join in
each other's personal joys and sor-
rows. Exchange visits are arranged.
In fact there are many examples
that go to prove the solidity of the
links which International Scholastic
Correspondence has helped to forge.
It has even been the first step
towards a number of marriages.
Started almost simultaneously in
North America and France, the
movement has continued to grow
ever since the end of the first World
War, and a system of co-ordination
- now provided by over 30 national
offices-rapidly became indispens-
able to make sure that letters
actually found appropriate reci-
pients, and also to ensure that the
correspondence had an instructional
and generally beneficial background.
This co-ordination, which, since 1929,
had been aided by the Institute of
Intellectual Co-operation of the
League of Nations, was extended in
1946 to exchanges of, and trips by,
students. The permanent committee
of International Scholastic Corres-
pondence was transformed into the
International Federation of Organi-
zations for Scholastic Correspon-
dence and Travel, with the aim of
uniting all efforts in this direction
on an international basis-and
especially in relation to Unesco.
Thanks to these organizations,
hundreds of thousands of young
people from 45 countries now ex-
change letters regularly. Many
among them apply direct to the
national offices to find a correspon-
dent, but most of the exchanges are
made through teachers and head-
masters. They send requests to their
own national offices, who get in
touch with similar organizations
abroad and make the arrangements.
Educators insist that correspond-
ence must be personal, individual
and voluntary. The teacher should
avoid even the appearance of
meddling ; but he can suggest,
propose, or guide, and he can often
integrate the correspondence into his
lessons. It is easy enough, and well
received by the children, if he knows
how to make the right approach-
for instance, by putting up a map
of the foreign country with which
most of his pupils communicate. It
must, of course, be on a sufficiently
large scale to indicate the towns
where the correspondents live, and
the places where events reported in
the newspapers or in the letters have
occurred. He may also hold tempor-
ary and frequently-changed wall
exhibitions, each dealing with an
aspect of life abroad.
The letters thus are used to give
children an idea of the different
countries which speak the language
they are learning. When English is
taught, for instance, to French, Ita-
lian or Belgian youngsters, their
correspondents in various parts of
Great Britain, the Dominions and
North America often give the
teacher ideas for study themes such
as the wool trade in the Common-
wealth ; British cathedrals ; the part
sport plays in English life ; various
types of buildings in the United
States ; plant life of Australia and
New Zealand.
Inevitably, the natural curiosities
of one land will be compared to those
of another : the Italian, French and
Canadian lakes and the Norwegian
fjords ; prairies and steppes ; the
Alps and the Rocky Mountains ; the
Thames and the Orinoco Rivers ;
agriculture and stock breeding ;
industries (especially in professional
and technical schools) ; types of
houses, schools, monuments ; cos-
tumes and typical meals in differ-
ent countries ; sport ; the theatre.
Correspondence in just one language
can lead to an infinite enlargement
of horizons.
The documentation received also
leads to the production of albums of
pictures from illustrated magazines,
or of postage stamps-and even
of collections of insects and plants.
Small libraries of foreign books have
been set up following exchanges
between correspondents. And to
these visual aids to learning without
apparent effort can be added aural
aids-the singing of songs in for-
eign languages, readings of parti-
cularly interesting letters, and the
recitation of poems suggested by the
foreign writers.
In addition to exhibitions and
collections organized in collaboration
with the geography teacher, drawing
teachers find foreign themes which
can be used. Problems of foreign
money and measurements lose their
boredom in the mathematics class,
and become an important prepara-
tion for travel. The study of litera-
ture in all its forms also benefits
from these exchanges of letters.
Pupils see, for instance, how classical
or modern plays are presented else-
where. (A number of Continental
schools recently illustrated the study
of Hamlet by photographs of the
actors and decor in a London
theatre.) It is not only a knowledge
of foreign works which increases
from hearing about the most read
authors in other lands ; to inform
their pen-friends reciprocally, the
children feel obliged to get better
acquainted with the literary life of
their own country.
Through their faraway friends
thousands of youngsters have learn-
ed to appreciate better the human
community to which they belong.
More and more of the teachers and
parents who. use children take part in
these exchanges are enthusiastic
promoters of the scheme, seeing in
its further development an import-
ant contribution to genuine in-
ternational understanding.
(Continued from to improve and sim-
previous page) plify inernational post-al relations.
Progress was delayed by the American
: : : ivil War and the Franco-Prussian War. During
1870-1871, besieged Parisians organized a
pigeon and balloon post to Tours. This was
the first regular airmail. Three hundred and
sixty pigeons carried micro-photographed
dispatches. During the same period balloon
postmen made 63 ascents, transporting over
3, 000, 000 letters and 91 passagers, despite
attacks by high-firing German guns.
Meanwhile Dr. Heinrich von Stephan, Ger-
man postmaster-general, was preparing a plan
for an international postal union. In 1874,
Switzerland convened at Berne a congress at
which all the European countries, the United
States and Egypt were represented. The
result was the International Postal Conven-
tion, which, for the first time, brought order
and uniformity to this international service.
This treaty, which came into force in 1875,
provided for uniformity in treatment of cor-
respondence, simplification of accounts and
reduction of rates within limits. Rates were
to be based on weight rather than distance.
The agency thus founded was named the
Universal Postal Union in 1878 and by 1900
included almost every country in the world.
Nations large and small continued to contri-
bute to the advancement of the service.
New Zealand, for instance, produced the
automatic stamp-selling machine in 1908, and
in 1920 won international recognition for the
letter-franking machine.
Air mail, established in Britain, France and
the United States in 1919, covered four
continents within a decade. The UPU in 1927
adopted a code of international air mail
regulations, which have been expanded as
required.
The basic principle of the UPU is that, for
postal purposes, all Member States form a
single territory. Each member undertakes
to transmit mails entrusted to it by the best
means of communication it uses for its own
mails. Thus each country today enjoys full
use of the railway, shipping, and air mail ser-
vices of the whole world.
Organization of the UPU is simple but effec-
tive. Most questions are settled by the coun-
tries directly concerned, but for matters
concerning all members an international
bureau is maintained at Berne. This bureau
collects and publishes informations, issues lists
of air and steamer services, and acts as re-
quired as an office for settling international
accounts. These are based on a return,
taken every three years, of one month's
correspondence.
The Universal Postal Convention is revised
every five years by the UPU Congress, to
which all members send delegates. The UPU
Congress which was held this year in
Brussels and which ended on July 12, took
decisions which will lead to a wider appli-
cation of lower international postal rates for
newspapers, magazines, books, maps and
printed music. These concessions, based on
recommendations by Unesco or inspired by its
aims for the free flow of information, will :
1. Allow alp newspapers, books and maga-
zines sent abroad to enjoy a 50 per cent
reduction in rates, regardless of sender.
2. Ensure that rates for publications sent
abroad will parallel the favourable rates
for publications posted within a country.
3 Allow literature for the blind to be mailed
free of charge.
4. Broaden an existing scheme permitting
payment in national currency, at local post
offices, for subscriptions to foreign
newspapers and magazines, and their
dispatch at low rates. This service will
be greatly simplified, so that many more
countries may be able to participate.
In addition to the Congress there is a
19-nation executive committee which meets
annually. Under the revised convention of
1948, the UPU became a Specialized Agency
of the United Nations.
Today the Union's members handle over
60, 000, 000, 000 letters annually. Their air-
liners speed across the skies with tons of
mail. This is a far cry from the turbaned
horsemen of ancient Persia, the cross-Channel
cutters of Queen Elizabeth's time, or the
reckless riders of the Pony Express. Yet all
who have served the post have been inspired
by the same objective-to transmit news and
informations to the furthest corners of the
earth.

THE UNESCO GIFT COUPON SCHEME
Y OL' : \'G people following world
e\'ents these days often ask
themselves,"Is U thel'e any-
thing ? ue can do to help the
United Nations succeed ?"
There is. Unesco's Gift Coupon
Scheme offers students as well as
older persons who belong to vo-
luntary organizations, clubs or
other groups, a direct and per-
sonal part in the work of a United
Nations agency.
In fact, for some time, young
people in the schools of France,
the United Kingdom and the Unit-
eel States have been among the
pioneer in making the Gift Cou-
pon programme a successful
form of international co-operation.
They have been spending their
pennies, cents and francs so that
other people in less fayoured
countries throughout the world can
also have the advantages of edu-
cation. They have been selling
Gift Stamps and buying Gift Cou-
pons so that teachers, schoolchild-
ren, students of all ages and
types, artists and scientists can
obtain the books, films, micro-
scopes, music, and indeed equip-
ment of every kind that they need
for their work.
The Gift Coupon programme
was created by Unesco to help
struggling schools and other insti-
tutions of learning in under-deve-
loped and war-damaged countries
and at the same time to provide
voluntary organizations in the
more fortunate countries with a
practical way to join in the work
of the U. N. and Unesco.
L'nesco evolved the Gift Coupon
scheme when it realized that many
such voluntary organizations and
groups'were finding their efforts
to carry out programmes of inter-
national friendship hampered in
\'3. rious ways. Details about
worthwhile assistance projects
were hard to find. Buying, pack-
ing and shipping supplies pre-
sented troublesome, complicated
problems. A'nd fund raising for
sending gifts abroad had become
more difficult.
Unesco Gift Coupons eliminate
transportation problems as well as
currency difficulties. It enables
\'voluntary groups to send coupons
abroad to institutions of learning
whose needs have been made
known to them by Unesco. The
recipients themselves order the
equipment they need from a
list of suppliers who accept
the Coupons as a form of inter-
national currency. These sup-
pliers handle all shipping, packing
and crating, and are reimbursed
in their own currencies by Unesco.

A PRACTICAL WAY FOR SCHOOLS TO HELP THE U. N,
Gift Coupons, which are issued
in denomination of $10, fit, and
1, 000'Frenc h fmncs, al'e bought by
the voluntary donor group from
L'nesco which furnishes lists of
specific needs in padicular places.
The buyer of the Coupon can
decide whether, for example, he
want to provided tools for a funda-
mental education project in Burma
or Indonesia, laboratory equipment
or research apparatus for India,
radios or cinema equipment for
villages in Africa.
In order to make it easier for
clubs and other groups to buy a
$10 Coupon, L'nesco added a fund-
raising device to its programme-
the Gift Stamp. These are print-
ed in small denominations, such
as a-23 cent stamp, a 20 franc
stamp, a sixpenny stamp. These
stamps not only make it
connnient for children to parti-
cipate but they provide a symbolic
token for old and young as well.
Money raised by the sale of stamps
is sent by the donor group to
Unesco by cheque or money order,
and Unesco returns the Gift Cou-
pons to the group. These cou-
pons are then mailed by the donor
group directly to the recipient
together with a person-to-person
letter.
Thus, When a club or voluntary
organization adopts a Gift Coupon
project, it is on the l\\'ay to making
new friends in other parts of the
world, and is helping in a practical
way"to build peace in the minds
of men"which is L'nesco's goal.
Success after II months
THE Unesco Gift Coupon pro-gramme was launched experi-
mentally in the United States on
December 15, 1ü50. On that date
the first twenty $10 Unesco Gift
Coupons \very purchased by the
American Association of Univer-
sity Professors (Hunter College
Chapter, New York). They sent
half-$ 100 worth-to Professor
Franz Faltis at the Universitv of'
Vienna to help him obtain labo-
ratory equipment, books and scien-
tific periodicals. The other ten
coupons went to the University of
Wurzburg.
Eleven months later, the U. S.
National Commission for Unesco
pronounced the trial period a
success and gave the scheme its
complete endorsement. The Na-
tional Education Association, the
largest body of educators in the
United States, recommended offi-
cially that schools, teachers
and schoolchildren participate in
the programme as a means of
promoting international under-
standing and goodwill. Clubs,
schools, church groups, labour
unions, professional societies,
national and other organizations in
46 out of the 48 states undertook
gift projects.
By the middle of 195i, the
Unesco National Commissions of
the United Kingdom and France
decided to adopt the scheme. In
April 1052, Canadian groups
joined ; and by July of this year,
the number of donor countries had
risen to seven when Australia, the
German Federal Republic and the
Netherlands agreed to participate
in the programme. Meanwhile, in
New Zealand, the Council of Orga-
nization for Relief Service Over-
seas decided that a portion of its
funds would be converted into Gift
Coupons for selected projects.
Denmark. Japan, Norway, Sweden
and Switzerland are also consi-
dering participation as donor
countries.
The gift projects for the re-
ceiving'countries are carefully
chosen by Unesco from the most
urgent cases of needy schools and
other institutions in the under-
developed countries or those still
suffering the effects of \var.
Whenever t'nesco field officers or
experts, for example, find schools,
educational services, scientists or
artists whose work is important
for the development of their
countries but is retarded bv lack
of equipment or supplies, the facts
are reported back to Unesco in
Paris. Once approved the projects
are included in a Gift Coupon
"catalogue"and distributed to
prospective donor organizations.
1'he"catalogue"gives a general
background story summarizing the
salient historical facts and details
of each Gift Coupon project.
By July of this year, there were
more than 100 high-priority insti-
tutions in 37 countries listed as
Unesco Gift Coupon Projects.
Here are a few examples of
some of these institutions and of
the kind of material already
furnished to them through the
Unesco Gift programme :
Teacher Training College for
Girls, Kabul, Afghanistan : 10 mm.
sound projector and films, worth
$ 3, >0 ;
University of Rangoon, Burma :
laboratory equipment, $ 030 ;
Unesco Schools for Arab Re-
fugees in the Middle East ; 16 mm.
sound projector and film library,
$ i : do ;
Social Education Centre, Delhi :
Artists'supplies, $ 20 ;
Uffizi Galleries, Florence : ca-
mera equipment, $ 300 ;
Public Library, Bayreuth, Ger-
many : microfilm reader, $ 210 ;
Institute for Blind Children,
Bandung, Indonesia : blind'writ-
ing apparatus, $ 30 ;
Adult Education Service, Tunis :
audio-visual van and films $ 0, 300 ;
Fundamental Education Centre,
Patzcuaro, Mexico : bookmobile,
$ 8, 300 ;,
Library of the National Museum,
Prague, Czechoslovakia : books,
$ H) O ;
Leyte High Schoo), Tacyoban,
Philippines : laboratory equip-
ment, $ 200 ;
Hydro-Biological Research Ins-
titute, Lake Ohrid, Jugoslavia : mi-
crobalance and weights, $ 700.
In the donor countries school
teachers take an unusually active
part in the promotion of the pro-
gramme. In the United States,
they participate through their own
organizations. In France, with
the approval of the Ministry of
Education and the help of their
trade unions, they have introduced
the scheme in the public schools
and aroused the interest of their
pupils. In the United Kingdom,
it has also been the schools which
have been most active.
Corsica to India
NOT long ago, for example, aletter from a small town in
Corsica was sent to Mr. S. S. Ma-
thus, director of Janata College, a
rural education centre for Indian
peasants. The enwlope contained
a blue piece of paper, about the
size and shape of a bank cheque,
labelled'unesco Gift Coupon-
1, (joy Francs". The Corsican vil-
lage school whose fifteen pupils
collected the sum, had studied a
list of Janata's needs, ranging from
a 7, 000-franc farm implement to
several 1, 000-franc sewing kits.
The children decided they could
raise the 1. 000 francs for one
sewing kit, and received from
i'Unesco a booklet of fifty 20-franc
Gift Stamps to sell to their families
and friends.
About the same time, a similar
letter from the United States
reached my. gorge Yemenetsis in
Salonika, Greece. It contained
30 L'nesco Gift Coupons each for
$ 10.. Mr. Yemenetsis is Chairman
of the Anatolia College Alumni
Association's Committee for the
Adoption of Lefkohori village, and
the money came from a special
bazaar held bv the students of
Public School Number 221, Brook-
lyn, New York.
A third letter reached Professor
A.. I. vun del'Beek of Bandung,
Indonesia, on the other side of the
world. It contained 13 orange-
coloured Unesco Gift Coupons, of
one pound sterling each, and came
from the Bournemouth School for
Girls in Hampshire, England.
When these girls decided to join
the Unesco programme, they se-
lected Gift Project No. 23. 2-B-
"Kit of raffia-weaving materials,
fifteen pounds or fifteen Gift
Coupons."This unit was reserved
for the school by the Council for
Education in world Citizenship,
which manages the Gift Coupon
programme for the schools of
England, Wales and Scotland.
College and university students are
reached by the British World Uni-
versify Service, young peoples'
organizations by the World
Assembly of Youth, and adult
groups by the U. N. Association.
U. K. plans big campaign
PROCESSOR van der Beek hadsubmitted a list of his school's
urgent needs varying from vo-
cational training materials to a
$.) on instrument for measuring the
hearing of nearly-deaf children.
The children in Brooklyn had
learned through Unesco of the
needs of Lefkohori, one of a num-
ber of war-wrecked villages in
Northern Greece which have been
"adopted"by urban groups in
Salonika. These village"adop-
tion"groups or committees sup-
lement their relief and welfare
work with long-range educational
assistance for which they need
special teaching equipment, such
as film projectors and radios.
Dr. Luis Padilla Nervo, President
of Unesco's Sixth General Assem-
bly has said :
"Without doubt, this programme
will be accepted by the majority
of men, women and children in all
countries who desire to contribute
to peace, because I believe that
never before today has the will for
peace been more apparent in all
countries of the world. All the
world is convinced that peace must
be built in the minds of men, and
that this must begin with edu-
cation. Thus, to collaborate in this
Unesco activitv means also colla-
borating in the work of building
the peace."
The results of the programme in
the United States, the United
Kingdom and France seem to
confirm Dr. Padillo. Nerve's op-
timism. When the New York
State Classroom Teachers Asso-
ciation undertook to raise $ 1, 500
for the University of Vienna,
Mr. Erwin Coons, its president,
said :
"We started modestly with the
idea that our members would
purchase or sell 0, 000 Gift Stamps
during this school year, but our
original plan has mushroomed.
One county alone has already
taken more than the original
number of stamps we expected to
sell a) I year."
Since the programme was
launched experimentally in the
United States in December He50,
the value of the Gift Stamps
issued on consignment in that
country has mounted to the equi-
valent of about $ 120, 000 and the
Gift Coupons thus far sent to re-
1'ljHenl countries to a total 01 over
$ 40, 000. Ten national organi-
zations are among the large
number of educational, civic, pro-
fessional, religious and other
groups which are actively pro-
moting the scheme.
During the past year, twenty
state organizations of the De-
partment of Classroom Teachers of
the National Educational Asso-
ciation have adopted some $30. 000
worth of Gift Projects.
During the first half year of the
programme's operation in the
United Kingdom, groups in
England, Wales and Scotland
contribute £1, 070 for various
projects. Thus far, some twenty
different projects, each comprising
dozens of separate specified needs,
have been given assistance from
groups in the United Kingdom. A
big campaign is planned in
connexion with United Nations
nay on October 24 when pro-
minent national and international
personalities will visit schools.
universities, youth and adult
groups to describe the programme.
The most popular project among
United Kingdom donors thus far
has been Unesco's Arab Refugee
Schools in the Middle East.
Nearly fifty donations have been
sent in the form of Coupons to buy
basic school supplie, vocational
training and other equipment.
Other popular projects have been
the Village Adoption Scheme in
Greece, to which more than thirty
donations have been made, and the
School for Crippled Children in
Swiebodzin. Po) and, which has
received fifteen donations.
IN France, the programme hasalso caught the imagination of
schoolchildren and more than
100, 000 twenty-franc Gift Stamps
have been ordered by schools in
more than fifty French counties.
including those in North Africa and
Corsica. Coupons worth 1, 27>0, 00
francs have been bought. In the
Limoges region of Central France,
the Unesco Committee has been
particularly active, selling stamps
at the Limoges Fair as well as in
the schools. Coupons worth more
than 100, 000 francs, bought in the
Haute Yienne County, went to
Burma, Indonesia, India, Greece
and Ceylon. A half-dozen ele-
mentary schools in Corsica, includ-
ing tiny, one-room schools with a
dozen or so pupils, raised funds
varying from 1, 000 to 3, 000 francs
which were sent to the University
of Belgrade for French books, to
the Home for Crippled Children in
Sweibodzin, Poland, for occupa-
tional therapy materials, and, as
in the example cited previously, to
the Janata College in India for
sewing equipment.
L'nesco's Division of Yoluntary
International Assistance (VIA),
responsible for the Gift Coupon
Project, is soon to consolidate the
different Coupons which now exist
in doHar, franc and pound deno-
minations, into one unit of
currency. This is to be called
the L'NUM Gift Coupon. The
tel'm"CNTM"stand for"Cneseo
t'nit of Money". Each 1-UNUM
Gift Coupon will be sold for the
equivalent of five dollars in donor.
countries, and will avoid the
necessity of issuing new Gift
Coupons in national currencies as
additional countries join in.

HOW THE
SCHEME
WO RKS
Here is the procedure your
group should follow to partici-
pate in the Unesco Gift coupon
scheme :
I,
Your group adopts a gift pro-
ject. To do this, Unesco will of-
fer your organization the names
of a wide choice of schools,
universities, libraries, laborato-
ries and the like in over three do-
zen countries which have seriou
needs that can be met through
this plan. 
2
When your organization hus
selected a project, Unesco will
send you, on consignment, Gift
Stamps worth 25 cents, sixpence,
20 francs or 20 pfennig. By
selling Unesco Gift Stamps to
finance a specific project your
membership not only collects
funds but helps. spread informa-
tion about the purposes of the
. UN and Unesco.
3
Each booklet of 40 Gift Stamp
sold pays for a Unesco Gift Cou-
pon worth ten dollars or one
pound. This is a special kind of
international money order bear-
ing the name of your organiza-
tion and of the recipient you and
Unesco have agreed upon. You
mail the Gift Coupons directly to
the recipient together with a per-
son-to-person letter. Your new
friends use the Coupons as
"foreign exchange"to buy the
specific items they need from
an approved supplier of their
choice. The supplier then sends
the coupons to Unesco to he
redeemed.

The Unesco Gift Coupon Plan
works only through organized
groups such as clubs, societies,
schools, unions and the like ;
individual enquiries cannot be
acknowledged.

A GARLAND
BOMBAY is called"the gateway to India".Its harbour on the western coast is one of
the finest natural shelters in the world and
is only rivalled by those of Rio de Janeiro, Naples
and perhaps San Francisco. The city itself is
built on an island (in ancient times there were
seven islands) but it is connected to the mainland
by a series of causeways and breakwaters so that
it is practically a peninsula. Owing to its position
on the Far Eastern trade route to Europe, it is
today the second largest city in India (Calcutta
in the north-east is the first).
Bombay boasts many of the finest buildings in
India, both public and private, and its university
is one of the oldest in the country. But it also
has some of the worst industrial slums in the
world and 75 per cent of its inhabitants are
illiterate.
The population of Bombay is in the region of
1, 250, 000, but this figure is probably an under-
estimation since thousands of immigrant labour-
ers from all over India are attracted to the textile
mills, factories and workshops of the city every
year. In addition, the population of Bombay has
been swollen by thousands of refugees who
migrated from Pakistan following Partition.
New arrivals to the city usually settle in what
is known as a chawl (a tenement block) or in
one of the groups of slums surrounding Bombay.
For the past 13 years, an unusual organization
has been at work to clean up as many of these
slums as possible, to raise sanitary conditions,
and reduce the high percentage of illiteracy.
The organization is called the Bombay Social
Education Committee. Since it began this huge
task in 1939, over 300, 000 men and women have
taken four-month courses and two-thirds have
passed the basic tests which certify them as being
able to read and write. Wherever the committee
is active, improvements are to be found in the
slum conditions of the chawls. The committee,
whose educational and cultural influence has
spread throughout India, offers instruction in
literacy, health, citizenship, handicrafts and
many other aspects of social education.
Recently, a Unesco official visited classes of the
Bombay Social Education Committee and re-
ported as follows :
"I visited both men's and women's classes of
various sorts, during the evening as well as by
day.
"A large percentage of Bombay's industrial
workers are housed in chawls, of which there are
many hundreds. From the outside, these four-
storey reinforced concrete blocks have the
misleading appearance of fairly modern housing
units. Inside, however, they are like rabbit
warrens or, as someone said,'human filing
systems'.
"The average chawl contains about 30 room
of medium size. Each accommodates a dozen or
more people of all ages and both sexes. Often
Radio sets bought with Unesco Gift Coupons enable groups living in chawls (tenement buildings) of Bombay to profit from education pro-
grammes. A set from America is handed over (bellow) to a representative of the bahya (municipal milkmen) for the building where his
group lives. A worker (above) garlands the new radio set with almost religious fervour. Following one of the broadcasts, mothers form
discussion group (bottom photo). First radio programme was amplified for public through loudspeakers attached to palm tree (below, right).

dim kerosene lamps. It is not difficult to
imagine the problems of health, sanitation and
welfare in the chawls. In every chawl the
Social Education Committee organizes a centre.
"In and around those chawls where literacy
classes had barely started, conditions were
appalling. In others where the programme has
been operating for some time, cleanliness and
order prevail in spite of the crowding. Here I
could see clearly that'literacy', as taught by the
Social Education Committee, means far more
than the alphabet. People displayed evidence of
good civic sense, cared better for their children,
and seemed altogether more alert and capable."
It is the aim of the Social Education Committee
to transform the 75 per cent illiteracy in Bombay
into 75 per cent literacy.
The education of women, however, presents
special problems. Although women have made
enormous strides in recent years towards
achieving equality with men, millions of Indian
wives still live in purdah-the word means
veil or curtain-set apart and veiled from others
around them. It was only in 1939, the same year
that the Bombay Committee was formed, that
the Indian Government passed a law called the
"Child Marriage Restraint Act"forbidding child
marriages under the age of 16. All over India, a
great movement is growing to educate girls and
young women after they have married. The
opposition to such educational activity remains
strong, however, in many groups. Since even
today many women will not or cannot drop the
curtain of purdah, teachers must seek them out
behind their veil.
This the Bombay Committee is succeeding in
doing. More and more husbands of wives in
purdah are being brought into literacy and
fundamental education classes. And as a result
of this, veiled women too are now coming to the
education centres, and in many cases they are
taking an active part in the different activities.
The Bombay Social Education Committee is
supported in its work by local government grants
and voluntary local donations, but its resources
are still insufficient.
Last year, the Bombay Committee became one
of Unesco's Gift Coupon projects. Unesco
notified voluntary groups and organizations in
donor countries of the equipment the Committee
urgently needed-equipment ranging in price
from $10 to $5, 000. It explained how Unesco Gift
Stamps could buy Gift Coupons which the Bom-
bay committee could use to buy radio sets
specially adapted for use under tropical
conditions, or film strip projectors as well as
16mm. documentary films. It explained that All
India Radio (known as"AIR") has a regular
educational broadcasting programme for indus-
trial workers, villagers, schoolchildren and college
students ; that local Bombay stations broadcast
special programmes for workers every evening
and how the Committee would use the receiving
sets in its educational programmes. In a similar
way, Unesco explained the particular need for
film projectors and the filmstrips which"not only
speed up the rate of learning among large groups
of people but also serve to arouse the interest of
the people who have so far been untouched by
adult education activity."It showed how print-
ing equipment was urgently needed by the Bom-
bay Committee for the literacy primers it
produces and the special newspapers it publishes
for the newly literates ; and that the vocational
courses undertaken by the Committee at its
different centres in Bombay were seriously
hampered by the lack of necessary lathes, drill-
presses, wood-working machines, bookbinding
equipment as well as sewing machines.
Since then, a large number of groups and
organizations of young people in the United
States have adopted different parts of the Bom-
bay Social Education Gift Project. Several
months ago, for example, the first three film
projectors along with a whole series of filmstrips,
and 16 radio listening sets reached the pioneer
education group in Bombay. All this equipment
had been purchased by the Social Education
Committee with the aid of Gift Coupons supplied
by club women in the United States.
The arrival of the radio sets, for example, was
greeted by the inhabitants of the Bombay chawls
with almost religious fervour. Crowds gathered
to watch the crates being opened. A representa-
tive of the bahya (the municipal milkmen of Bom-
bay) proudly stood to attention to receive the gift
for his crawl. The sets were carefully decorated
with garlands of flowers, after which they were
switched on and special loudspeakers attached
to the high poles in the courtyards so that
the men, women and children could hear their
first programme broadcast by All India Radio.
For some inhabitants of the chawls, the arrival
of this equipment from the other side of the
world seemed almost unbelievable. But the
feeling quickly grew of a new bond of friendshipwith the women of a country which until then
had seemed so strange and far distant to them.
For the world-minded women from Okla-
homa, Texas, Illinois, Kentucky, Alabama, Florida,
Montana, and other states in the United States,
the Gift Project was an answer to their question
"What can we do to help the purposes of Unesco
and the United Nations ?"In it they have found
a new way of sharing with, a new way of speaking
to people in other lands, and a new way of foster-
ing international goodwill by joining to help
worthwhile causes most in need.
"What curious money is this ?", asks a Bombay worker, seeing Unesco Gift Coupons for the first time. Mrs
K. Sayani (right) Vice-President of the Bombay Social Education Committee, explains that they can be used
to buy radio sets, filmstrips and similar materials for the centres it has opened in the slum areas of the city.

This small boy from India is learning to walk again thanks to Unesco Gift Coupons. A victim
of infantile paralysis, he is being helped to recover his sense of balance on special apparatus
at the Bombay Society for the Rehabilitation of Crippled Children. Five French schools and
. two American organizations have already contributed equipment to the Bombay orthopaedic
centre through the Gift Coupon Programme of Unesco. The Unesco Gift Coupon is a form
of international money order or cheque which groups can send to any one of more tha :, 3 ? cou-tries allover the world, for the purchase of equipment for schools and other institutions In
under-developed or war-affected areas. For the story of the Unesco Gift Coupon Programme
and how it is bringing help to where it is most badly needed, see pages 19 to 23.
