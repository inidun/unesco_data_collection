At a time of heightened global tension, 
when human rights, freedom of speech, 
peace and the future of the planet 
itself may seem challenged as never 
before, the transformational power of 
education is of critical importance. 
In Learning: The Treasure Within, the 
landmark Report to UNESCO by 
the International Commission on 
Education for the Twenty-first Century 
in 1996, Jacques Delors, then 
Chairman of the Commission 
(1992 to 1996), spoke 
of education as “the 
necessary Utopia” 
and “an indispensable 
asset in its attempt 
to attain the ideals of 
peace, freedom and 
social justice.” 
Education was held up as neither 
miracle nor magic, but rather the 
best means to foster a climate where 
humanity would be improved − and 
where the rich potential for learning, 
inherent in every individual, would 
be tapped. 
Our humanity is confronted with a very 
strange paradox: the world’s population 
has never been better educated, and 
yet, according to the UNESCO Institute 
for Statistics, 263 million children 
and young people are out of school, 
617 million children and adolescents 
worldwide do not meet the minimum 
threshold for literacy and mathematics, 
at least 750 million adults are illiterate, 
and girls remain more likely than boys 
to never set foot in a classroom. Yet 
education is still called upon to address 
inequalities, poverty, terrorism and 
conflict. It is seen as one of the keys 
to global citizenship and sustainable 
development, two of UNESCO’s fields 
of action. The Organization is also 
mandated to lead the Education 2030 
global agenda with a special focus on 
ensuring that no one is left behind.
Under the title, “Education: Still 
searching for Utopia?”, the UNESCO 
Courier evaluates the state of global 
education and explores how it responds 
to some of the main challenges we face.

Where and how did your impulse to fight 
for children’s rights start? 
When I was five. The very first day of my 
schooling, I saw a boy, around the same 
age as me, sitting outside the school 
and looking at my shoes. He had a shoe-
polishing box in front of him. I was very 
disturbed. My first-ever question to the 
teacher was: why was the boy outside 
and not inside the school? The teacher 
said it was very common for poor children 
to have to work. 
One day I asked the boy’s father 
about this and he said his father and 
grandfather had also been shoe-shiners. 
Then he said: “Sir, don’t you know that 
people like you are born to go to school 
and people like us are born to work?” That 
question really stayed with me, but I had 
no answer as a child. 
Interview by Mary de Sousa
Children may have been given the right to education, but now they 
must be educated about their rights. This is the new challenge faced 
by Kailash Satyarthi, winner of the Nobel Peace Prize 2014. He has 
been at the forefront of the fight against child slavery and labour 
since 1980, when he founded his movement, the Bachpan Bachao 
Andolan (Save the Childhood Movement), which has helped liberate 
more than 85,000 children in India from exploitation – through 
education and rehabilitation. Satyarthi tells the UNESCO Courier 
how his quest to improve the lives of children began, what he hopes 
for from his new cause to make schools safe, and why he believes 
true liberation starts with education.

day of the Bharat Yatra march in Indore 
(Madhya Pradesh, India).

I spoke to legal friends, who explained to 
me the problem was that India did not 
have education classed as a human right 
in its Constitution. It was only in 2001 
that a mass campaign led to the 86th 
Amendment to our Constitution, making 
education a human right. 
Your child labour campaign started in 
India, but soon became international. 
How did that happen?
It took two decades before it became 
a global issue. When I founded the 
Bachpan Bachao Andolan (BBA) in 1980 
in India, I discovered that none of the 
United Nations bodies – the International 
Labour Organization (ILO), the United 
Nations Children’s Fund (UNICEF) – or 
the World Bank, had any international 
legal instrument to prevent children 
from being drawn into labour, trafficking, 
prostitution and other dangerous 
occupations.
I began to look at Pakistan, Nepal and 
Bangladesh, and realized that they 
all had similar situations concerning 
contemporary slavery. In parallel, I started 
to participate in the Human Rights 
Commission in Geneva, Switzerland, and 
decided to work towards an international 
law against child slavery.
I campaigned in Europe and America 
and set up a programme in Germany 
to fight against child labour. As a result, 
the first ILO International Programme on 
the Elimination of Child Labour was born 
in 1992, and then UNICEF and the World 
Bank joined in. 
In 1993, BBA initiated the first campaign 
in the form of a march against child 
labour in India. Five years later, 
we launched the 80,000-kilometre 
Global March Against Child Labour 
across 103 countries, which lasted for 
six months. 
The crowning achievement of these 
efforts was undoubtedly the ILO 
Convention 182, concerning the 
Prohibition and Immediate Action for the 
Elimination of the Worst Forms of Child 
Labour. It was unanimously adopted and 
ratified by 181 countries. This happened 
in 1999, twenty years after my first leaflets 
were circulated in India.
When I got older, I saved my old 
schoolbooks and collected my pocket 
money to pay the fees for poor children. 
I trained as an electrical engineer, but the 
feeling that I should do something for 
these children never left me. I left my job 
to become truly involved. 
What would you say were your first major 
achievements?
From the very start – when I used to 
write and print thousands of leaflets 
to be distributed in the market for our 
first campaign – I have believed that 
education and liberation are two sides of 
the same coin. When I first tried to bring 
the issue of child labour into the public 
domain, there was nothing being done 
about it. India did not have a law against 
child labour till 1986. I fought for six years 
for this law and it is still not perfect, so 
the fight goes on. 
When I freed children from slavery and 
asked for them to attend school, I was 
humiliated so many times. I was told 
they are dirty, uncared for, we can’t have 
them here.

Ten years ago, you launched another 
march in South Asia, to advocate for a 
regional protocol against forced labour, 
and more recently, in September 2017, the 
Bharat Yatra march to end child sexual 
abuse and trafficking. What made you 
organize these marches?
Bharat Yatra, a nationwide mobilization 
covering 11,000 kilometres over 36 days, 
was a clarion call to “Make India Safe 
Again for Children”. Child sexual abuse 
is a growing problem worldwide, but in 
India it has become a modern epidemic 
– with young children abused, raped or 
trafficked on a daily basis. 
A child is sold every two minutes and 
sexually abused every half hour. In most 
cases, the perpetrators are school bus 
drivers, teachers, tutors. While they roam 
free and fearless, the victims keep quiet 
out of feelings of shame.
I realized I had been fighting all this time 
for every child to be in school, but in fact 
children are not always safe there. 
The first thing that has to change is 
the taboo associated with child abuse. 
That requires a mass movement, so 
we used the time-tested strategy 
of marching. Based on our previous 
successful experiences, we have tackled 
the problem of violence against children 
– this time including child marriage 
and exploitation, which remain huge 
obstacles to education.
How successful was this journey and 
what will happen now that awareness 
has been raised?
To have 1.4 million people join the 
Bharat Yatra march was unprecedented, 
particularly as the topic of child sexual 
abuse is taboo. Wherever we went, young 
people from the crowd stood up, even 
came to the stage, and spoke for the very 
first time about what was happening 
to them. 
Children may have been given the right 
to education, but now they must be 
educated about the rights they possess. 
We are also pushing for a Safe Schools 
campaign to be promoted by schools, 
universities and colleges across India, 
where the priority will be safety from 
sexual abuse. 
We are now working on a study assessing 
attitudinal and behavioural change and 
knowledge-building as a result of the 
Bharat Yatra campaign, which may be 
shared internationally. We have already 
had requests from other countries to run 
Safe Schools campaigns there. 
I realized I had been 
fighting all this time 
for every child 
to be in school, 
but in fact children 
are not safe there
Marriage of an under-age girl in Kota 
(Rajasthan, India) on 16 May 2010. 
Early marriage is one of the main 
obstacles to education in India.
During the Bharat Yatra march, you told 
politicians they should go back to school. 
What did you mean?
They pledged to visit the schools they 
had attended, and I told them they 
should go, not as VIPs (Very Important 
Persons), but as ordinary fathers and 
mothers and try to learn more – not 
just about safety, but about the quality 
of education, the general school 
environment, the teachers. Is the school 
child-friendly? Does it have the midday 
meal programme? What is school 
attendance like? So often the education 
sector is aloof and disconnected, and 
corruption can mean that in rural areas, 
teachers don’t turn up and school 
drop-out rates are high. 
By getting politicians to visit schools, 
many changes can be brought about 
at the same time. I also asked that 
female police officers visit schools more 
often, to build the idea of protection. 
The government has indicated that 
there will be a new bill against human 
trafficking, including child trafficking. 
The bill will also include education 
campaigns and programmes to help 
create awareness on the subject.

Kailash Satyarthi (India) was jointly 
awarded the Nobel Peace Prize 2014 
(with Malala Yousafzai), for his “struggle 
against the suppression of children and 
young people and for the right of all 
children to education.” Satyarthi was 
instrumental in the adoption of the ILO 
Convention 182 on the worst forms of 
child labour in 1999. He is also founding 
president of the Global Campaign for 
Education and in this capacity, was 
a civil-society representative in the 
High-Level Group on Education for All. 
Satyarthi is best known for his mass 
awareness marches, the Global 
March Against Child Labour, across 
103 countries in 1998, the South Asian 
March Against Child Trafficking in 2007 
and the Bharat Yatra (Safe India for 
Children) march to end child sexual 
abuse and trafficking, which concluded 
in October 2017. He has also launched 
the 100 Million for 100 Million campaign 
to support children to know their rights.

You were awarded the Nobel Peace 
Prize in 2014 for your “struggle against 
the suppression of children and young 
people and for the right of all children 
to education.” Did it change your life?
I always joke that I was handed a 
medal for peace and all my peace was 
taken away! I have received about 
40,000 invitations and would need to 
live another 160 years to attend all these 
events. At the same time, I am very happy 
to be thought of as the ordinary man’s 
Nobel laureate. Being directly connected 
with ordinary people gives me much 
more confidence in what I am trying 
to do. 
One downside is that I am not able 
anymore to personally go on child 
labour rescue operations! My face is so 
well-known that I am recognized even in 
the remotest areas. This means there will 
be a tip-off, and children are removed 
from the mining area or factory before 
I get there. In several cases, I have had 
to be more stealthy and return two or 
three times to find them. On the positive 
side, I have access to almost all the 
heads of UN agencies, prime ministers, 
presidents, where I can talk directly about 
policy change. 
You have come a long way from your 
original career as an electrical engineer. 
Have you found a place for those skills 
in your work?
My training has proved extremely 
useful in that it allows me to think in an 
analytical, rational and structured way. 
I believe this is why my work against child 
slavery has a rights-based, rather than a 
conventional, charity approach. Structural 
change is much easier to bring about 
when you are familiar with a structural 
approach. 
What changes in children’s lives have you 
witnessed since you became an activist? 
I know that once we free children 
from slavery and child marriages, we 
see a ripple effect. Education brings 
empowerment, dignity and identity to 
the most deprived and marginalized 
people, particularly children and 
girls. Once they are educated about 
their rights, and acquire reading and 
writing skills, they gain tremendous 
self-confidence. 
I have witnessed girls standing up and 
refusing to be married against their 
will because they know their rights 
and can go to the police or to a non-
governmental organization (NGO). In the 
same way, many boys trapped into slave 
labour, once they know they have rights, 
are able to make contact with someone 
who can help.
You have met thousands of children. 
What have they taught you? 
That it is essential to keep the child alive 
inside oneself. I believe when people 
are genuine and simple and clear in life, 
it is because they have not forgotten 
the importance of being childlike. 
What keeps you motivated?
What keeps me motivated? The dreams 
I can see in children’s eyes.

The first school I visited in an active 
conflict zone was set on the side of a hill 
overlooking a plain in Kosovo*, in 1999. 
To get there, we had to drive through 
country lanes past a village, where 
skeletons of houses lined the road – many 
of them with makeshift roofs, and all of 
them with black scorch marks above 
their windows.
They had been torched by Serbian 
forces in retaliation for the activities of 
the Kosovo Liberation Army, the rebel 
armed group fighting for an independent 
Kosovo. And in many of them, extended 
families were now living in one blackened 
room, around a stove donated by the 
United Nations Children’s Fund (UNICEF).
At the school, I saw children sitting in thin 
clothes, shivering in freezing classrooms 
with shell-holes in the wall. Many of them 
looked numb from something deeper 
than the freezing winter cold.
by Brendan O’Malley
Every attack must be 
documented and every measure 
taken to ensure education 
continues during periods of 
conflict. The price paid for 
children losing access to schools 
is too high, writes Brendan 
O’Malley.
When going to school is 
an act of faith
With their families, they had lived in the 
woods for six months to escape earlier 
retribution and, after negotiations, 
had recently been allowed to return to 
their village. The teachers were working 
without any prospect of being paid, to 
keep classes going.
As I interviewed the headteacher, there 
was a loud thud outside and the whole 
building shook. A shell had landed on 
the other side of the hill.
“They do this every day, just to remind us 
they are here,” the headteacher explained. 
“But we will carry on. The school gives 
us hope.”
The Santa Barbara Elementary School 
in the Philippines became a killing 
ground after it was taken over by 
an armed group during the Zamboanga 
siege of September 2013.

A safe place to be 
In times of conflict or crisis, being able to 
send children to school offers parents and 
communities a semblance of normal life; 
a safe place to leave their children while 
they work; a place where vital services, 
such as vaccinations, can be delivered 
and where vital safety information – 
such as how to avoid landmines – can 
be learned. But above all, it is a means 
to give their children an education that 
will enable them to build a future for 
themselves and for their community 
and country.
The reverse is also true. When schools 
are destroyed in areas of instability, hope 
is destroyed along with them – fear of 
going to school and indeed, staying in 
the area, can spread. People may flee for 
their own safety and, with that, all hope of 
an education is gone.
There have been some shocking 
examples of education being targeted 
in recent years. In Chibok, Nigeria, 
in April 2014, Boko Haram militants 
abducted 276 girls from the Chibok 
Government Girls Secondary School, 
more than a hundred of whom have yet 
to be released (as of December 2017, 
according to news agencies Reuters and 
Agence France Presse). 
In October 2016, pro-government 
air strikes on the Kamal Qal’aji school 
complex in the Idlib Governorate, Syria, 
killed three teachers and nineteen 
children, injured sixteen children 
and severely damaged the school, 
the United Nations (UN) reported.
In June 2017, militants planted bombs 
around a primary school in Pigkawayan, 
in the Philippines, occupied it and held 
local people hostage in the school. 
Entire generations 
left behind 
The immediate impact of these attacks 
may be deaths and injuries to students 
and staff, destruction of facilities, 
closure of schools and universities, 
and psychological trauma.
If they are ongoing – given that on 
average, conflicts in poor countries 
last for twelve years – attacks, or even 
collateral damage, can lead to long-term 
disruption, closure, the permanent 
dropout of students and teachers, and 
the prevention of rebuilding. 
Even after a conflict ends, it can take 
years to rebuild destroyed facilities and 
get the education system back on its 
feet – during which time whole cohorts of 
children are denied an education.
Research by UNESCO shows that half of 
the world’s primary-aged children who 
are out of school, live in conflict-affected 
states, and most never get the chance to 
complete their education, “leaving behind 
entire generations”.
The latest global study of attacks on 
education, Education under Attack 2014 
– published by the Global Coalition to 
Protect Education from Attack (GCPEA) 
– documented that over four years, from 
2009 to 2012, armed non-state groups, 
state, military and security forces, and 
armed criminal groups had attacked 
thousands of schoolchildren, university 
students, teachers, academics and 
education establishments in at least 
seventy countries worldwide. 
The attacks ranged from the bombing or 
burning down of schools or universities 
to killing, injuring, kidnapping or illegally 
arresting, detaining or torturing students, 
teachers and academics.

In the six most heavily-affected countries 
– Afghanistan, Colombia, Pakistan, 
Somalia, Sudan and Syria – the 2014 
report documented that there were 
“1,000 or more attacks on schools, 
universities, staff and students or 
1,000 or more students, teachers or 
other education personnel attacked, 
or education buildings attacked or used 
for military purposes.”
The report also found that schools and 
university facilities were used for military 
purposes in twenty-four of the thirty 
countries profiled.
The UN has since reported that in 
Nigeria, an estimated 1,500 schools 
have been destroyed since 2011, with at 
least 1,280 casualties among teachers 
and students. According to the GCPEA, 
“in the worst cases, children have been 
injured and killed and schools damaged 
or destroyed when belligerent forces 
have attacked schools because military 
forces were using them”. 
Schools and universities are targeted for 
different, and often multiple, reasons – 
whether it is to create instability, attack 
the perceived type of education offered, 
seize facilities for military use; or in the 
case of higher education, to prevent 
expressions of alternative political views.
Every attack must 
be documented
The first and most crucial step to 
addressing the problem is to develop 
effective monitoring to understand what 
is happening, and why.
Prevention measures can range from 
providing protection, such as security 
guards or building a perimeter wall, to 
addressing a motive for attacks, such as 
ensuring equitable access to schools for 
minorities or enabling minorities to learn 
through their own language and study 
their own religion; or hiring teachers 
from the local ethnic community, as has 
happened in Southern Thailand.
The reduction of impact measures 
could include building schools out of 
concrete instead of wood and straw, 
because they would be harder to burn 
down, or providing two points of exit for 
each classroom, so that students have a 
chance to escape if militants or soldiers 
try to enter a classroom to recruit them 
at gunpoint.
In the case of the military use of 
schools, a key preventive measure is 
persuading states and non-state armed 
groups to agree not to use schools for 
military purposes.
Deterrence measures include ending 
legal impunity for the attacks and holding 
to account the armed groups and armed 
forces that carry out attacks. 
This includes the listing of parties 
committing grave violations against 
children in conflict – including attacks on 
schools and recruitment of child soldiers 
– in the UN Secretary General’s annual 
report on such violations to the UN 
Security Council. Those parties listed must 
draw up action plans to address and end 
the violations or face sanctions.
Currently, the GCPEA is leading an 
international campaign to persuade 
countries to sign up to the Safe Schools 
Declaration, which commits countries to 
many of these measures. In December 
2017, the Dominican Republic became 
the seventy-second country (as of 
9 January 2018) to sign the Declaration. 
The Special Representative of the 
Secretary-General for Children and 
Armed Conflict (CAAC), Virginia Gamba, 
has urged all UN Member States to 
endorse and promote the instrument. The 
Safe Schools Declaration “has made an 
essential contribution towards promoting 
tangible measures to prevent attacks on 
education. We simply cannot afford to 
make schools in conflict zones a military 
target. The price of a child losing his or 
her access to education for years, if not 
decades, is too high to pay,” Gamba said, 
while presenting the CAAC Report at the 
UN General Assembly, in October 2017.
Brendan O’Malley (United Kingdom), 
a journalist and consultant, has worked 
with several international organizations 
on issues related to attacks on education, 
and higher education for refugees and 
crisis-affected communities. He is the 
author of Education under Attack (2007, 
UNESCO) and Education under Attack 
(2010, UNESCO). He was lead researcher 
of Education under Attack 2014 (GCPEA). 
O’Malley was editor and co-writer 
of the Education Cluster’s Protecting 
Education in Countries Affected by Conflict 
series (2012).

Dalia Al-Najjar has crammed a great deal 
into her short life. At 22, the Palestinian 
refugee has already lived through three 
wars and has spent every spare moment 
between siege and ceasefire studying, 
volunteering, working, blogging, on 
the daily struggle to live in Gaza – and 
planning how to change the future. 
I chose to be

A child of war dedicates herself to peace
I was so angry, 
I felt like I wanted 
to blow up the 
whole world, 
but I didn’t. 
I decided 
I wouldn’t be 
pushed to 
become evil. 
I would choose 
peace.
A good deal of her energy goes into 
her role as Goodwill Ambassador for

trust, friendship and reconciliation 
between Israeli and Palestinian children, 
aged 4 to 17, and their communities.

Dalia says she is fuelled by anger and 
hope, but also that she draws heavily on 
a family culture that values education. 
She has consciously used learning as a 
means to realize her dreams, the greatest 
of which is to find solutions to violence 
and hatred. “My family has always made 
me aware that education is hugely 
important,” she said. 
Dalia experienced her first siege when 
she was just 12, followed by two major 
conflicts. “I was in ninth grade when the 
first war started, and everything fell apart. 
I didn’t understand: why were people 
killing each other? I thought it would last 
only a few weeks,” she said. 
She continued to study throughout, 
finally graduating with a Bachelor’s 
degree in Business Administration from 
the Islamic University of Gaza, her life 
reduced to the intermittent bursts of 
electricity in the city. “In those days I 
never went to school without watching 
the news first, and everything depended 
on the power schedule. So I woke up 
when there was electricity, or studied by 
candlelight, which destroyed my eyes. I 
would often fight with my brother and 
sister to get the candle.”
“Wars and Peace”, from the 
Cartooning for Peace international 
network of editorial cartoonists, 
supported by UNESCO. 
The 2014 war proved a turning point for 
Dalia. “After the war, my ideas became 
much clearer. I didn’t want anybody else 
to have to live like this. I chose to be 
optimistic, because if not, I don’t live. Not 
living wasn’t a choice for me,” she said. 
Dalia was invited on a short scholarship 
to the United States, and began a blog 
and YouTube show. She is also a member 
of the World Youth Alliance, a New York-
based international coalition, which 
works with young people worldwide to 
build a culture that nurtures and supports 
the dignity of the person – through 
advocacy, education and culture.
But it is Dalia’s work as a Goodwill 
Ambassador for Children of Peace that 
has changed her most profoundly.  
“It is easy to stay on your own side and 
demonize the other. Now I have Israeli 
friends and we realize we have been 
given different narratives, and we have to 
find our way through that together, using 
critical thinking,” she explained.  
“Being on one side of a conflict makes 
it much easier to dehumanize someone 
than to accept that there is trauma 
on both sides.” 
Now studying for her Master’s degree 
in Human Resources in Sakarya, Turkey, 
Dalia has an exciting new project. She 
attended the Young Sustainable Impact 
(YSI) conference in Oslo in 2017, as an 
‘earthpreneur’ (someone who uses 
entrepreneurship to work towards a 
sustainable planet), where she was 
tasked with proposing a startup that 
addressed one of the Sustainable 
Development Goals. 
When she learned that more people die 
as a result of waterborne diseases than 
from conflict, she co-founded Xyla Water 
Filtration Technologies. The company 
aims to commercialize a filter made from 
plant tissue that costs less than $10 and 
can provide clean water for a family of 
seven for a year.
And she has another goal. “I want to be 
prime minister,” she said, matter-of-factly.

A team of four trained educators run ten 
programmes a year, devised for children, 
families and older students. Any school 
or individual can sign up for hour-long 
training sessions and other activities 
including talks and films, all covering 
topics at the core of the history of the 
Nobel Peace Prize – such as conflict 
resolution and human rights.
Defining peace 
is not easy 
Our first task with the children is to 
explore the concept of peace. Everyone 
knows they want peace, but it is not that 
simple to talk about or teach. When we 
start to define it, most students say at first 
that peace is the absence of war. 
But is that enough? We challenge them 
to think further. Can peace be something 
more than the absence of war, and if so, 
what is it? And what destroys peace? 
by Toril Rokseth
Peace is more than the absence 
of war. That’s the crucial start 
of the learning curve for young 
people. The Nobel Peace Center 
in Oslo, official showcase for 
the Nobel Peace Prize, runs its 
own education programme, 
teaching peace. More than 
10,000 children aged between 
6 and 19 visit the Center 
each year.
Every year, thousands of schoolchildren 
walk through the doors of a converted 
railway station overlooking the harbour 
in the heart of Oslo, Norway’s capital, in 
search of one elusive thing – peace. 
An initiative of Geir Lundestad, former 
director of the Norwegian Nobel Institute, 
the Nobel Peace Center serves as a 
museum about the Nobel Peace Prize. 
An independent foundation, financed 
through a combination of private 
donations and government grants, its 
mission is to promote interest in, and 
knowledge of, the Nobel Peace Prize and 
tell the story of Alfred Nobel and the 
Peace Prize laureates. 
Through its events, the Center aims to 
foster reflection and engagement on 
topics related to war, peace and conflict 
resolution. Since it opened in 2005, it 
has welcomed over 1.6 million visitors 
to its more than sixty permanent and 
temporary exhibitions – including 
twelve about the Peace Prize, and 
exhibitions about the laureates and 
other world leaders.
Alongside that work, the Center runs an 
education programme aimed at opening 
young minds to the concept of peace, 
how it is defined and cultivated. More 
than 10,000 children aged between 6 and 
19 from Norway, Europe and further 
afield, visit the Center each year. 
Can peacebe taught?
The obvious answers are war and conflict, 
but peace can also be destroyed by 
poverty, racism, environmental disasters, 
or the absence of democracy and human 
rights. We start to pose harder questions. 
If racism destroys peace, should we not 
oppose it? If poverty destroys peace, 
should we not work to eradicate it? If the 
absence of human rights destroys peace, 
should we not work to ensure human 
rights for everyone? 
We also ask the students about their 
views on what promotes peace. This 
enables us to more fully explore topics 
such as human rights, how countries 
and groups can work together, and 
respect between people. The purpose of 
these questions is to provoke them into 
understanding that peace is a positive 
rather than a negative. 
At the Center, we believe the goal of our 
work is for students to acquire knowledge 
and values that can be transformed into 
actions that benefit them personally, and 
their communities. To nurture conscious, 
tolerant, empathetic citizens, the 
foundation must be democracy, human 
rights and conflict resolution.

Starting with 
the basics
“Democracy has to be born anew every 
generation, and education is its midwife,” 
wrote John Dewey in The School and 
Society. The American philosopher, 
psychologist and educational reformer 
(1859-1952) believed in teaching children 
through problem-solving rather than by 
learning facts by rote. We try to use the 
same approach. 
When we talk about human rights, we 
start with basics, like asking students 
if they feel they are heard when they 
express opinions. From this, it is a small 
step to talking about others who have 
not been allowed to talk freely – like 
Nobel laureates Nelson Mandela and 
the German pacifist Carl von Ossietzky, 
for example. We then discuss the 
responsibility that follows from basic 
human rights.
We adapt our methods to the age and 
ability of our students. We know, for 
example, that role-play works very well 
when the youngest students are being 
taught the importance of children’s rights. 
We challenge older students to take a 
stand in difficult cases based on true-life 
dilemmas. Above all, we try to ensure that 
the sessions are relevant and help build 
critical thinking. 
Drawing on personal 
experiences 
A directed discussion with open-ended 
questions can strengthen the students’ 
empathetic abilities. What is racism? 
What happens inside a person 
repeatedly exposed to racism? What 
are the consequences of racism? In 
group discussions, students learn how 
to articulate their opinions and expand 
their theoretical vocabulary. We draw on 
their personal experiences to reinforce 
the universal aspect of human rights 
and create a safe framework for them to 
share, and to try out standpoints with 
each other. 
Our programmes also make use of 
our archive and the laureates’ work, as 
powerful concrete examples of actions 
for peace. This may include the Austrian 
novelist and pacifist Bertha von Suttner 
(the first woman to be solely awarded 
the Nobel Peace Prize in 1905), for her 
persistent efforts in the international 
peace movement; American activist 
Martin Luther King, Jr.’s (awarded in 1964) 
use of non-violent methods to further the 
Civil Rights movement, or Iranian human 
rights lawyer Shirin Ebadi’s (awarded 
in 2003) audacious work to achieve 
universal human rights.
To follow up, we highly recommend that 
teachers take the conversation started 
at the Center back to the classroom. We 
provide follow-up tasks on our website, 
to support practice and knowledge-
deepening activities. We often receive 
very positive feedback from teachers 
about the way in which the visit has 
stimulated thought and debate among 
their students.
Toril Rokseth (Norway) is Director of 
Education at the Nobel Peace Center, 
where she leads a team of 
four educators. 
The Nobel Field, designed by American 
artist, David Small, is often called 
the heart of the Nobel Peace Center.

“Brain drain is particularly acute in 
sub-Saharan Africa,” says the World 
Economic Outlook (October 2016), 
a report published by the International 
Monetary Fund (IMF). “The migration of 
young and educated workers takes a large 
toll on a region whose human capital 
is already scarce. The concentration of 
migrants among those who are educated 
is higher than in other developing 
economies. The migration of highly-skilled 
workers entails a high social cost, as is 
evidenced by the departure of doctors 
and nurses from Malawi and Zimbabwe, 
which may mean welfare losses beyond 
those that are purely economic.” 
This situation is not new. The African brain 
drain had already started in the 1980s.
Temporary migration 
in the 1960s
In the 1960s, the higher education 
policies of newly independent African 
states reflected a need for them to train 
their own elites. For some, students 
would be trained abroad, mostly in 
the former colonizing countries and 
the Soviet Union. They received state 
scholarships and were expected to 
return home to contribute to their 
country’s development. Cameroon, for 
example, required that all students with 
scholarships sign a ten-year pledge. 
Meanwhile, countries in the former 
Soviet bloc demanded that African 
students leave as soon as they had 
finished their studies. They were also 
encouraged to leave the host countries 
due to other factors – such as difficulties 
in finding employment, jobs reserved for 
nationals, discrimination or downgraded 
appointments. At the same time, newly 
independent states offered attractive job 
prospects for their graduates – reviving 
their enthusiasm for independence 
and using laudatory slogans like 
“Your Country Needs You!” to make 
them feel wanted. 
by Luc Ngwé 
In October 2016, a report by 
the International Monetary 
Fund (IMF) forecast that 
“migrants [from sub-Saharan 
Africa] in OECD (Organisation 
for Economic Cooperation and 
Development) countries could 
increase from about 7 million 
in 2013 to about 34 million 
by 2050,” adding that “the 
migration of young and 
educated workers takes a large 
toll on a region whose human 
capital is already scarce.” 
This decades-long 
haemorrhaging of the 
continent cannot suddenly be 
stopped. African universities 
have to include time spent 
studying abroad as an integral 
part of their courses, while 
encouraging short-term 
migration that allows these 
well-educated citizens to 
return to their home countries.
 African brain
 drain:
is there an alternative?
In the two decades after independence, 
the African brain drain followed the logic 
of a wider migration movement. Its main 
feature was that it was temporary – at 
least in its intention. 
In the 1980s, this post-independence 
euphoria gave way to disenchantment 
in most African countries. Promises of 
an escape from poverty were not kept. 
In a series of successive self-imposed 
“slimming diets”, the state apparatus 
drastically cut back on public-sector 
recruitment. The ideal of a project for 
the common good began to fade, and a 
feeling of futility set in. Getting a diploma 
no longer had the same meaning, while 
“employability” became the watchword 
for educational policy, in Africa and 
elsewhere. Students increasingly turned 
towards courses that enabled them to 
acquire skills that were “saleable” in the 
world job market. 
Migration for life
Countries in the North were not 
unhappy about the migration of skills 
out of countries in the South, though. 
They competed for new talent while 
facing problems in renewing their own 
workforces. Forecasts of an ageing 
population and certain policies limiting 
the number of student places, like the 
numerus clausus for medical students 
in France, forced these countries to 
increasingly turn to foreign labour. They 
adopted selective immigration policies 
in an effort to match the skill sets of 
migrants to the needs of their economies. 
Faced with a dearth of doctors, France 
welcomed those from abroad, while 
Germany attracted foreigners with the 
skills their industries needed.

African countries 
have entered globalization 
through the backdoor
The health professions, computing, 
finance and technology, in particular, led 
the way for greater international mobility. 
In this sense, globalization gradually 
opened up national job markets, while 
encouraging greater standardization in 
curricula and diplomas worldwide. 
But, while African countries entered this 
globalization through the backdoor, 
in that they did not always have a 
say in it, the same was not true for 
individuals. They sometimes benefited 
through personal educational projects, 
professional prospects and other 
possibilities (consumption, travel, etc.) 
on offer to them. However, while these 
opportunities may have matched 
personal development goals, they 
did not necessarily correspond to the 
development goals, orientations and 
priorities of some African countries. 
Be that as it may, the internal policies of 
African countries are among the factors 
that – alongside the demographic 
trends of countries of the North, and 
globalization – transformed African 
migration from being temporary to being 
permanent. This was migration with no 
real prospect or intention of returning, 
and which was not due, as we have just 
seen, to economic factors alone (jobs, 
salaries, working conditions) or policies 
(persecution, insecurity). It was migration 
as a prospect for life.
Brain power 
in the diaspora
Today, African countries seem to find 
it impossible to stop the brain drain. 
Repatriation strategies at any price are 
proving to be ineffective, so long as 
governments do not attack the root 
causes of emigration.  
“I decided to leave my country because, 
at the time, I thought that there was 
no future for us there, and that life 
would be better here, in Europe. When 
I’ve finished my studies, I want to look 
for a job in my home country, while 
keeping a base here, in Italy. That 
way, if I don’t find work at home, I can 
always stay here and try to make it,” 
says Thertys Schemele, an African 
student interviewed by Congolese 
photographer Bourges Naboutawo.
And that priority is not given to retaining 
brains that are fleeing. 
One alternative – if not a solution – would 
be to use the brain power in the diaspora 
to teach courses in African universities. 
Such a circulation of skills would open 
new prospects for African countries at 
a time of inescapable globalization. 
For several years now, university and 
scientific networks have been set up 
between home countries and countries 
with an African diaspora. There is, for 
example, the University of the Mountains 
in Cameroon, which has formed an 
alliance with the Dijon University Hospital 
and the Paris 13 University in France – 
and with the University of Udine and the 
Centro Cardiologico Monzino in Milan, 
both in Italy.

Similar mutually beneficial practices 
between host country and country of 
origin operate in the academic world, 
especially in the United States and 
Canada, and to a lesser extent, in the 
United Kingdom and France. African 
universities with links to higher education 
and research institutions in these 
countries are piloting a programme of 
cooperation with their country of origin, 
supported by these overseas institutions. 
In 2010, Mahmood Mamdani, who was 
director of the Institute for African Studies 
at Columbia University, New York (from 
1999 to 2004), created the Makerere 
Institute of Social Research at the 
Makerere University in Uganda. In 2016, 
Ousmane Kane, who holds the Chair 
of Contemporary Islamic Religion and 
Society at the Harvard Divinity School in 
the US, started an academic exchange 
programme for students from Senegal, 
his country of birth. There is a long list 
of African researchers and academics 
who are helping to regenerate higher 
education and research in their countries 
of origin, through teaching and research 
programmes and co-publication projects. 
The integration of the African diaspora 
in the global skills market offers them 
some assurance that they will remain 
competitive, instead of experiencing the 
sclerosis they suffer if they stay in their 
country of origin – because of the poor 
working conditions and an environment 
that does not favour professional success. 
This is particularly the case for lecturers, 
researchers, health personnel, and more 
recently, the so-called cutting-edge 
professions like Information Technology 
(IT), telecommunications, finance and 
biotechnology.
As the IMF report points out, African 
diaspora networks “can also provide 
rigorous professional development 
and leadership training programmes. 
Combining their skills, contacts, and 
know-how with their insight into 
global opportunities and local customs, 
diaspora networks of emigrants may help 
strengthen the home-country business 
environment, raise efficiency, and expand 
into new markets.”
When we make the effort to transform 
the brain drain into brain circulation, 
it can pave the way for new forms of 
cooperation, new modes of development 
for African countries and new forms of 
influence that can draw strength from 
international socialization.
Luc Ngwé is a Cameroonian researcher 
and freelance consultant. The author of 
a series of studies on higher education, 
he has taught at the University of Douala 
(Cameroon), and at universities in 
Nanterre and Avignon (France).
“African students in Europe find it 
hard to return to their home country 
once they have finished their studies,” 
says Loveline Nguetsa. But not her. 
She wants to go back to Cameroon 
when she has her degree in electronics 
and a Master’s in automation. 
Despite the problems of employment, 
insecurity, education, and health, 
which drive young people to leave the 
continent, “you always feel better at 
home,” she explains to the Congolese 
photographer Bourges Naboutawo. 
She is convinced that, with real political 
will, these problems can be solved.
Morocco is involving its diaspora 
through national programmes such as 
the International Forum of Moroccan 
Competencies Abroad, which supports 
national research and technology 
initiatives. In 2009, the National Centre 
for Scientific and Technical Research 
(CNRST) in Rabat signed memoranda of 
understanding with a number of bodies 
abroad, notably the Association of 
Moroccan Computer Scientists in France 
(AIMAF) and the Moroccan-German Skills 
Network (DMK) in Germany.
Health is an area that would benefit from 
this kind of cooperation. Cameroonian 
pharmacists who have settled in Belgium 
have joined forces with the University of 
Douala to offer introductory courses in 
pharmacy. Since 2010, the Association 
of Cameroonian Physicians in Belgium 
(MedCamBel) has been organizing 
professional conferences and public 
information, prevention and awareness-
raising campaigns for Cameroonians. 
Circular migration 
– a new trend
In parallel, certain countries in the North 
are encouraging “circular mobility”, or 
short-term migration, which enables 
foreigners to work and to specialize 
in their vocations for a few years, 
before returning to their country 
of origin. This circular migration is 
supported by the Expert Council of 
German Foundations on Integration 
and Migration, the German Agency for 
International Cooperation (GIZ), under its 
Triple Win programme, and Germany’s 
Federal Employment Agency. 
Circular migration benefits both the 
country of origin as well as the host 
country, through the transfer of skills 
and knowledge. And we shouldn’t forget 
the subjects of all of these initiatives – 
who are learning by working, who form 
professional links that might prove useful, 
and who can earn a better living during 
their stay abroad, which they can then 
invest in the economy of their countries 
of origin someday.

Faced with these concerns about the 
contemporary world, one would imagine 
that the humanities – with one of its 
central missions being precisely to provide 
the keys to interpret the world in which 
we live – would have assumed a more 
prominent role. But, with the possible 
exception of sociology, the humanities 
have remained largely in the background 
in current debates and are slowly 
disappearing from university curricula. 
The place traditionally reserved for the 
humanities is clearly diminishing, just 
about everywhere in the world, but 
particularly in developed countries. 
by Jean Winand
Technological and scientific 
advances have changed the 
way we relate to the world. The 
role of the humanities has been 
ousted by an economics-centric 
approach. In this context, 
universities are confronted 
with a dilemma: should they 
be producing technicians who 
are intrinsically productive, or 
more generalist graduates who 
are able to reflect on the future 
of societies? Economic realism 
cannot be the sole response to 
today’s challenges.  
Among the phenomena that characterize 
the early twenty-first century, the most 
significant must be the disappearance of 
the landmarks that society uses to find 
its bearings, and the increasing difficulty 
that individuals have in visualizing an 
optimistic future for themselves – a 
feeling exacerbated by following a daily 
spectacle of wars and mass migrations. 
To this can be added our questions 
about the nature of the living world – 
the maintenance of our ecosystems, 
the workings of our democratic and 
individual freedoms, the role of the 
State, relationships between States 
and multinational corporations – that 
are able to mobilize enormous means 
to control the gathering, distribution 
and preservation of knowledge 
and information, as well as their 
transformation and exploitation.  
The isolationism of some rich countries, 
the rise of populism and the dramatic 
reinforcement of integralist movements, 
leads us to believe that power is 
progressively being seized by those 
who believe in quick and easy – if not 
simplistic – solutions. 
Universities 
and the “democracy of the gullible” 
On the one hand, their scope is shrinking 
– the messages they convey have ceased 
to be relevant for technical disciplines. 
At the same time, the resources allocated 
to the humanities, for both teaching and 
research, are at a constant low level.
The causes contributing to this situation 
are too numerous to be detailed here. 
I will restrict myself to the role of the 
political authorities.
Do politicians see how important 
it is to train people who can think 
about things with a critical mind?

What priorities 
for policy? 
In a world where full employment is no 
longer a certainty, the almost isometric 
correspondence between training and 
a trade that can lead to employment has 
become a real obsession. It now seems 
preferable to train graduates who are 
immediately ready for specific tasks, 
rather than offer them a more general 
degree. For example, in June 2015, the 
Japanese government announced its 
intention to drastically reduce, if not 
abolish, departments of humanities, 
social sciences, philosophy and the 
arts, in the universities it controls. 
The Japanese Prime Minister stated 
at the time, that rather than backing 
more academic research, which is very 
theoretical, it was preferable to provide 
more practical courses, which would 
better anticipate the needs of society. 
But can universities content themselves 
with training specialized technicians 
who remain ignorant of anything outside 
the limited area of their discipline? 
It has come to the point where we 
have to ask ourselves if politicians, who 
are responsible for setting strategic 
objectives, see the need to train people 
who can think more generally, with a 
critical mind. In some countries, the 
answer is clearly no. In many others it 
is not, or is no longer seen as a priority 
– sometimes even by the university 
establishment itself, now obsessed with 
questions of profitability.
In a world where it is becoming harder 
to find a philosophical and moral 
compass, universities still enjoy a good 
measure of trust with the public. But, 
in order to maintain and reinforce this 
trust, they have to continue to set a 
good example. Scientists are not always 
immune to certain criticisms of their 
intellectual integrity. 
So science has become suspect in the 
eyes of a growing proportion of the 
population. The presentation of what is 
called ‘alternative facts’ is an interesting 
case in point. This is probably not the 
place for a lengthy exposition of the 
various sceptical views – which are 
sometimes held at the highest levels of 
government – on the reality of climate 
change, or arguments – as if they were 
two equivalent opinions – about the 
theory of the evolution of species and 
creationism. In this changing context, 
universities can be strongholds of 
freedom. This depends, of course, 
to a large extent on the institutions 
themselves, but governments need to 
guarantee sufficient resources to ensure 
their real autonomy.
The role of 
the humanities
In an ideal university, the humanities 
would have a central role to play. And 
yet they are not taken seriously today. 
Too often the survival of these disciplines 
depends on an instrumentalization that 
is almost forced. For example, we can 
easily agree that a philosophical insight 
is necessary on ethical issues in the life 
sciences, but we don’t see the use of 
supporting research on Kant [Immanuel 
Kant (1724-1804), German philosopher] 
medieval philosophy or phenomenology. 
For many scientists, research in the 
human sciences is not real science. The 
lack of understanding stems particularly 
from the fact that the natural sciences 
impose their epistemological paradigm 
– or at least their research practices – on 
science as a whole.

As the preserve of the humanities is 
first and foremost that of meaning, 
it inevitably follows that there will be a 
certain relativity in their findings. 
Also, no one thinks of criticizing 
the technical elite, respected for their 
contributions to economic wealth, 
our physical well-being and our material 
comfort. The same is not true of the 
intellectual elites, whose mission is also 
to be disruptive, by the questions they 
pose to society, by the critical position 
they take vis-à-vis the authorities, or the 
way they decode the meaning – always 
the meaning – that is hidden, disguised 
or obscured under the continuous 
flow of information, in which we are 
all submerged. 
But it is precisely the humanities – which 
do not think in terms of binary categories 
– that are able to provide the tools we 
need to understand the complex world 
around us. By default, what will gradually, 
and perhaps irreversibly, emerge, is the 
“democracy of the gullible”, to borrow 
a term from the French sociologist, 
Gérald Bronner.
The warning signs of 
obscurantism
Confronted with the colossal challenges 
posed by the evolution of the 
contemporary world, by the extraordinary 
technological developments that 
profoundly question our models of 
society, the only possible response 
cannot lie solely in a search for economic 
well-being – even if there obviously 
have to be basic minimum standards, 
especially in the least developed 
countries. But sticking to that principle 
would at best be a fig leaf, used to 
conceal more complex and essential 
realities. The only adequate response lies 
in the comprehension of the intelligence 
of the world in which we live.  
This understanding depends on culture, 
a profound culture, not – or in any case, 
not only – a culture of entertainment. 
It demands a culture nurtured by the 
breadth of history; a multilingual culture, 
a culture which is concerned with its 
origins, which researches them, tries to 
deepen our understanding of them, and 
thus tries to understand its own present 
and envisage its future. A culture, then, 
that is fully informed, and which can 
only be so through the irreplaceable 
contribution of the humanities.
In order to understand the position 
of humans in the universe, along with 
their history and culture, in more than a 
superficial manner, we need to acquire 
methods that can sometimes be very 
exacting. Yet the ignorance of these 
things, along with the disdain or even 
contempt for those who defend them, 
have always been the harbingers of 
authoritarianism and obscurantism.
The excuse of leaders who would follow 
a path based solely on economic realism 
is, at best, stamped with the seal of 
ignorance. At worst, it is the trace of a 
desire to subjugate people by brutalizing 
them. This is what I was referring to when 
I spoke of a major democratic challenge 
in the way we conceive the status and the 
role of the humanities in our societies.

The same idea was captured in the 
inclusion of education as one of the rights 
in the Universal Declaration of Human 
Rights adopted in 1948, and in the 
Preamble to UNESCO’s Constitution.
The inclusion of that right in the 
Declaration sparked one of the 
most remarkable silent revolutions 
experienced by humanity. Global access 
to basic education increased from under 
50% in 1948 to over 85% today, and the 
percentage of the population who could 
read, increased from 36% to 85% in the 
same period (Global Rise of Education, 
2017). That this increase in access to 
education took place while the world 
population grew from 2.5 billion to 7.3 
billion, makes it all the more remarkable. 
Over the last decade, I have been 
working to understand how best to 
support the development of education 
systems to educate students as global 
citizens. The education process that 
leads to global competency must be 
supported by a high-quality curriculum 
and sustained by effective teacher 
preparation and leadership. With a 
number of collaborators, I developed 
two comprehensive school curricula, 
from kindergarten up to, and including, 
high school. We continue to collaborate 
with a network of schools around the 
world, developing instructional resources 
to further advance effective global 
citizenship education.
A road map to
change the world
by  Fernando  M.  Reimers 
It is imperative to equip the next 
generation with an education 
that will help them understand, 
care about and address the 
global risks we all face. Only then 
can we live in peace with one 
another, and with the planet 
we inhabit, argues education 
expert Fernando Reimers. He has 
created two innovative Global 
Citizenship Education curricula 
at Harvard University to help 
students become global citizens. 
What is education but the construction of 
opportunities for people to develop the 
skills and mindsets that help them live in 
ways that advance worthy goals? 
This idea dates back at least to the 
sixteenth-century pedagogue, Jan 
Comenius, who argued, in his Didactica 
Magna, that we should educate all, 
so we could have peace in the world. 
Cultivating 
a positive mindset
The first curriculum, published in the 
book, Empowering Global Citizens (2016), 
was designed in 2011 and 2012 to be 
taught in a six- to eight-hour a week 
course from kindergarten to high school. 
It was initially developed to be taught 
at Avenues: The World School, a global 
network of independent schools which 
was establishing its first campus, in 
New York, at the time. 
We developed a competency framework 
which included ethics, knowledge, social 
competencies, self-knowledge and 
mindsets, aligned to the development 
of capacities that would help students 
develop a global consciousness – while 
cultivating their motivation and skill to 
address global challenges.
Central to the conception of global 
competency was the notion of 
empowerment, cultivating a mindset that 
each individual can make a difference, 
can take the initiative and act in 
leadership roles.
We used a project-based learning 
approach, offering opportunities for 
students to develop their own interests 
and passions; it involved parents and 
community members as well.

Instead of just engaging with content 
knowledge, students are engaged in 
creating a product that demonstrates 
deep understanding – whether it 
be a puppet show (kindergarten), a 
business plan (third grade) or a social 
enterprise (eighth grade). For example, 
in third grade, students study global 
interdependence through creating a 
project in chocolate manufacturing and 
the creation of a marketing campaign 
that touches on global food chains, the 
ethics of free trade and child labour.
As this first curriculum was published 
and widely shared, it became clear 
that a simpler version was necessary to 
facilitate wide-scale adoption. Feedback 
from those who adopted the curriculum 
paved the way for a more effective and 
accessible approach.
Understanding 
globalization
The second curriculum, Empowering 
Students to Improve the World in Sixty 
Lessons (2017), offers three tools with that 
aim – a protocol to design and adapt a 
global citizenship curriculum; a protocol 
to design a school-wide strategy for global 
education; and an actual curriculum 
prototype, developed following the 
process presented in the book. 
Adopting and developing such a 
curriculum is within the reach of a wide 
range of schools, with varying levels of 
resources and support. Having a concrete 
prototype makes it possible to obtain 
feedback. It requires teaching only five 
lessons in each grade – yet it is a rigorous 
and robust sequence, with a clear set of 
learning outcomes. 
This second curriculum is aligned to 
a map of global competencies that 
characterize a high-school graduate 
who understands globalization and 
appreciates the opportunities it 
offers for people to collaborate on 
improving their communities. These 
competencies map onto the Sustainable 
Development Goals. 
Leading powerful 
learning
As part of the Global Education 
Innovation Initiative (an international 
collaborative research-policy practice 
group) I lead at Harvard University, I 
am now working with a number of 
schools and networks of schools around 
the world, learning together how to 
implement intentional global citizenship 
curricula. The original two curricula 
have been translated and adapted into 
Chinese, Portuguese and Spanish. 
We are learning that establishing 
conditions that sustain high-quality 
global citizenship education at scale 
requires collective leadership, and 
coordinated efforts – across a range of 
organizations in the public and private 
sectors over an extended period of time 
– that sustain the capacity of educators to 
lead powerful learning. 
Similarly, creating opportunities for 
education leaders to share what they 
have learned with others can accelerate 
the process of intentional cultivation 
of leadership, a crucial step in making 
education systems relevant to the twenty-
first century, as discussed in One Student 
at a Time. Leading the Global Education 
Movement (2017).
There is solid evidence that intentional 
high-quality curricula and effective 
pedagogies can empower students to 
become active global citizens. Education 
is indeed a most powerful avenue to help 
students improve the world. The task to 
educate each of the 1.2 billion learners as 
global citizens has never been more urgent. 
Fernando M. Reimers (Venezuela) is the 
Ford Foundation Professor of the Practice 
in International Education and Director of 
the Global Education Innovation Initiative 
and of the International Education Policy 
Program at Harvard University. An expert 
in the field of international education, he 
is interested in advancing understanding 
of the ways schools can empower 
students to participate civically and 
economically, and to help achieve the 
Sustainable Development Goals.

Radio in
pictures:
a detour via Bamako
Text: Katerina Markelova
Photos: Marco Dormino / 
MINUSMA
To celebrate radio in pictures 
– this was the challenge 
successfully undertaken 
by Marco Dormino. The 
photographer, who has worked 
with the United Nations for over 
a decade, specializes in recording 
emergency situations – notably 
in Central America and Mali.
To celebrate its obvious success, 
MINUSMA has decided that World Radio 
Day (13 February) is the ideal occasion to 
pay homage, not only to Mikado FM, but 
to radio in general. Radio has become 
the “main tool for disseminating culture 
and political opinions in Mali,” Dormino 
explains. “It plays a key role in the daily 
lives of Malians.” 
And here is our youthful 41-year-old 
Italian, combing the maze of streets 
in Bamako in search of radio stations! 
A difficult task, as their premises are 
often not in the best locations. “Some 
neighbourhoods in Bamako aren’t even 
marked on the map. It’s easy to get lost. 
In general, I only had a rough idea of 
where I was supposed to be going.” 
In a week, he discovered several radio 
stations in the city – not all, but many of 
which are the most listened to in Mali – 
Kledu, Benkan, Guintan, Jekafo, Chaîne 2, 
Liberté.
Dormino, who joined the United Nations 
Multidimensional Integrated Stabilization 
Mission in Mali (MINUSMA) in 2013, was 
in Bamako when its Mikado FM radio was 
launched in June 2015. This “Peace Radio” 
is broadcast over a vast area in northern 
Mali – home to the independence-
seeking Azawad community, among 
others. Its aim is to provide the public 
with accurate and reliable information 
on all aspects of the peace process in 
Mali and to thus help establish peace and 
national reconciliation. Its name, Mikado, 
was taken from the eponymous game, 
and refers to the power of a people that 
is united. 
Broadcasting in French and Bambara, 
and in other local languages (Fula, 
Songhai, Arabic and Tamasheq) for some 
specialized programmes, Mikado FM is 
rapidly gaining the trust of people in the 
country’s north – becoming the most 
widespread means of communication in 
the Gao region.

Dormano says he always received a warm 
welcome, was given complete freedom 
of movement and had the full support 
of the staff. “I met some very professional 
journalists, who were very well-organized 
and very committed – whether they were 
working for a large public station like Radio 
Chaîne 2, or a small private radio,” he said. 
“They all seemed to be passionate and were 
there because they really wanted to be.” 
By doing this assignment, Dormino 
wanted to get a real feeling for the way 
local people think. This is something he 
always tries to do, wherever he is. “Radio 
is about people’s opinions, their feelings 
and their voices. It is people who bring 
radio to life,” he says. 
 In terms of reception – in regions of the 
world where the absence of transport 
infrastructure makes it impossible to 
distribute print media, and where the 
electricity power supply for television 
broadcasting is at best intermittent 
– a small battery-operated transistor 
radio is all that is needed to access news 
and information. 
In an effort to promote access to 
information via radio, UNESCO, in 2011, 
proclaimed that World Radio Day would 
be celebrated on February 13 every year. 
The date is symbolic, as this was the day on 
which United Nations Radio was created, in 
1946. This UNESCO resolution was adopted 
by the UN General Assembly in 2013. 
Radio is in fact the media that is closest to 
the people. According to UNESCO, radio 
still reaches more people than any other 
media. In Africa, eighty per cent to ninety 
per cent of homes have a working radio 
set. In 2016, more people worldwide 
listened to radio than watched television 
or used smartphones. One does not have 
to be able to read to listen to radio, and 
it can reach very small communities by 
broadcasting in their language. 
Radio continues to be one of the 
cheapest means of communication. 
From the broadcasting point of view, 
a small 40-Watt FM radio station can be 
set up for under $5,000.

Our guest
Your nine-part series on the History of 
Africa has been broadcast on BBC World 
News TV in July and August 2017. What 
inspired you to do it?
Africa has a long, rich and complex 
history. Yet that history is neglected and 
overlooked, and what we are presented 
with often projects a distorted and 
partial picture. This has always troubled 
me. When I discovered, several years 
ago, the General History of Africa (GHA) 
published by UNESCO, I was delighted. 
Thousands and thousands of pages on 
Africa’s history from the beginning of 
time to the modern era, written mainly 
by African scholars. And yet I’d only 
vaguely heard of it.
The thought struck me that surely 
the General History of Africa is one of 
UNESCO’s best-kept secrets! This was 
the starting point of the project.
I have been in the media for more than 
twenty-five years and I have done all 
sorts of things, but I can honestly say 
– hand on my heart – that this project 
is by far the most exciting, the most 
interesting and the most valuable 
project I have ever been involved in.
It is a legacy project and a unique 
project, because never before in the 
history of broadcasting, have we had 
a systematic look from prehistory 
to the modern era of Africa’s history 
– told, I hope, in a compelling way – 
particularly targeting young people and 
particularly targeting Africans. I really 
hope that after they see this, they will 
have a very clear idea of how wonderful 
their continent is, regardless of which 
part of it they come from.
How do you plan to make the series 
accessible to as many people as 
possible? Is it available on the web? 
The series will be made available to all 
African and Caribbean state television 
stations and in Brazil – hopefully in 
several languages – as soon as we have 
managed to translate and put subtitles 
on the episodes. There is a big cost 
implication to doing this and it will also 
take time. The series is not available on 
the web, but it may be in future. It will 
be shown again in 2018, on BBC World 
TV. We are also exploring other options 
for its dissemination.
General History of Africa is an 
academic publication. How did you 
make it appealing for a wide, general 
audience? 
I am a television personality. I have been 
in television for a long time, and I am 
very keen to make sure that this series 
is grounded in proper scholarship. 
Which it is, but it also has to be visually 
enticing. So it is not an illustrated 
lecture. I am very keen on making sure 
that young people watch it. It is no use 
making programmes which tick the 
right boxes if nobody watches them.
I tried to make it fun and accessible and 
visually very colourful. For example, 
if I am talking about the trans-Sahara 
trade, I’ll find a camel market, I’ll jump 
on the camel, I’ll fall off the camel – yes, 
I did! And I’m not very proud of that… 
when I think that my great-grandfather 
was a camel trader.
The key thing that I am very sure about 
is that this project is the history of the 
African people – and not about stones 
and bones and monuments.

Interview by Jasmina Šopova 
The British-Sudanese television 
personality – who transformed 
UNESCO’s General History of 
Africa into a nine-part series for 
the BBC, making this treasure-
trove accessible to thousands 
– terms it her “most valuable 
project” yet. This broadcasting 
project is unique because it 
systematically explores Africa’s 
history from prehistoric times 
to the modern era – specifically 
targeting young people and 
Africans. Besides elaborating 
on what it took to make this 
ground-breaking series, Badawi 
also discusses the continuing 
gender hierarchies in the media, 
and the difficulties professional 
women encounter when aiming 
for a work-life balance.

Our guest
How do you see the gender issue in 
the media landscape today?
There are several aspects to the gender 
issue in the media. The female on-screen 
presence – the kind of role that I have, 
for example; female expert opinion that 
is also sought, when the women are 
interviewees; women in positions of real 
power in media organizations, behind 
the scenes; and the way gender issues 
are covered in the media.
In terms of women’s presence in the 
field, and on the screen, I think that it has 
improved, but the senior roles are still 
predominantly male.
All over the world, including in the 
United Kingdom, the number of 
professors who are women is small 
compared to men. It means that when 
you want to go and seek experts’ 
opinions, they are more likely to be male.
In terms of women in positions of 
power, regardless if it is a Western, 
African or Asian nation, the picture 
is not particularly optimistic. Major 
Western organizations remain very much 
controlled by men. The BBC, certainly. 
You find women in middle and lower 
levels of management, but the high level 
is still very male-dominated.
When it comes to gender issues, 
and how these are covered, that is 
sometimes done in a slightly superficial 
way – especially in countries where the 
assumptions, the prejudices on gender 
issues, are deeply rooted.
You moderated a Leader’s Forum 
at UNESCO in 2011, where you said 
that girls’ education was your “family 
business”. Could you explain why? 
In a sense, yes, it is. I was referring to my 
great-grandfather Sheikh Babiker, who 
pioneered girls’ education in Sudan at 
the turn of the twentieth century, when 
the country was under British rule. At 
that time, girls were not educated but my 
great-grandfather wanted to change this, 
and he started with his own daughters.  
Despite the hostility from the British 
authorities and the Sudanese 
community, he established a school for 
his children in his own house.
He had many children actually. We make 
jokes about him in the family: we say 
that he was so pro-women that he 
married four of them!
More seriously, he was indeed a great 
visionary. He set an example by making 
sure that his own daughters were 
educated, and then they developed 
schools. I grew up with aunts, who are 
now in their eighties, with Ph.D.s from 
Western universities. Presently, one of 
my uncles runs the Al-Ahfad University 
for Women in Khartoum, where girls 
from Sudan, but also from other parts of 
Africa and the Arab world, are educated.
So, when people say that Muslim 
girls cannot be educated because it 
is inconsistent with the values of that 
religion, I am simply astonished!
Your work is time-consuming. How do 
you balance work and family?
It is hard for women as mothers to have 
careers. We are the ones who give birth 
to children, and whatever our profession 
is, that means that there are some 
interruptions to our work. So you have 
got to do what works best for you. But 
if you opt for a longer interruption to 
your career – maybe three, four, five, ten 
years – in order to look after the children, 
you do pay the consequences for that. It 
could mean you are out of the frame and 
you have to reclimb the ladder, while 
others have gone beyond.
Have you experienced this?
Probably. I was lucky because my 
work is studio-based, but I had some 
interruptions to my work, because I 
have four children. It is a lot! Had I been 
childless, I would have probably had two 
or three more years to add to my career 
– who knows.
Of course, we show monuments where 
it is relevant, but we want to tell the 
history of the people. Everywhere we 
went, I was trying to find characters 
who are mentioned in the GHA and to 
put them at the front of the narrative. 
It might be the Aksumite King Ashama; 
it might be the Berber king Juba II, who 
married the daughter of Mark Antony 
and Cleopatra; it might be the Sudanese 
King Piye of Kush, who ruled Egypt in 
the eighth century BC. So this is my 
approach: to always start with a narrative 
that involves the people.
How were the local communities 
involved in this project?
I used local camera crews in each 
country. It is extremely hard work, and 
they were exhausted, but they were all 
thankful, because they were listening to 
the interviews, they were looking at the 
places, and they were learning about 
their country. Some of them said, at the 
end of it: “I had no idea there was so 
much in my country”.
What were the major difficulties you 
encountered during the shooting?
One of the problems was to get archival 
material from the national TV stations. 
They were all willing to collaborate, but 
in the end, you never get anything. Also, 
there was a question of language. I work 
in English, but most people in Western 
Africa speak French. In Northern Africa, 
they speak mostly Arabic. Fortunately, 
my Arabic is better than my French.
I would say the main problem was 
the lack of female interviewees. 
The vast majority of the experts are 
men. So, where possible, I tried to 
speak to women, in order to address 
the imbalance.
The key thing that I am very 
sure about is that this project 
is the history of the African 
people – and not about stones 
and bones and monuments

Our guest
You often say that you have a hyphenated 
identity. Could you elaborate on this?
Today, everybody is a bit of something 
in Europe, but when you have a badge 
of colour, your multiple identity is more 
evident than if you don’t. I was born in 
Sudan, and moved to the UK when I was 
2 years old. At that time, there were 
fewer people from Africa or Asia living 
in Europe. There are many more now. 
I think that it is really less of an issue 
than it was.
Obviously, I am of a Muslim 
background, but Muslims are a part 
of the European landscape. And I do 
think that when we refer to Muslims in 
Europe, we should say “Muslim Britons”, 
for example, instead of saying “British 
Muslims”. I would switch the name 
and the adjective, like the Americans 
do. They say “Muslim Americans”. The 
difference looks slight, but actually it 
speaks a lot more. It is quite profound 
and it is important to the mindset.
I see my hyphenated identity as an 
advantage that gives me a first-hand 
experience of both non-Western and 
European culture. I don’t see any 
inherent conflict. I just have the feeling 
that I have the best of both worlds!

Audrey Azoulay also stressed on 
UNESCO's special role in orchestrating 
international cooperation and bringing 
together the normative and operative 
as effectively as possible. “This supposes 
that we continue thinking, nurturing 
the crucial link with intellectual circles, 
especially in all scientific areas, that 
continuously probe the complexities 
of the current era,” she said. One of the 
major enterprises of our century in 
which UNESCO should play a leading 
role, as it cuts across each of the pillars 
of its mandate is, according to the 
Director-General, “the reconciliation 
between the unprecedented digital 
and scientific revolution that we are 
living and the humanist values that 
we uphold.”
Based on UNESCO's clear skills to 
provide for the 2030 Agenda and the 
Paris Agreement on Climate Change, 
she stressed the need for more alliances 
with other stakeholders: United Nations 
agencies, Member States, regional 
organizations, cities and civil societies.
Convinced that none of the major 
challenges facing the world today can 
be met by any one country on its own, 
without relying on the fundamental 
pillars of science, education and culture, 
the Director-General believes that 
UNESCO must participate fully in a 
world order based on multilateralism 
and humanist values: “UNESCO’s 
promise and what we owe to the world 
is to work in this multilateral framework 
by acting on the root causes of our 
collective destiny,” she said.
In the face of the multiple challenges 
that we all share, a world without 
collective intelligence would be 
powerless, according to Audrey 
Azoulay, who describes UNESCO as 
“collective intelligence in action.”
UNESCO: collective 
intelligence  in action
Audrey Azoulay
Audrey Azoulay (France) 
was appointed to the post of 
Director-General of UNESCO 
on 10th November 2017. 
The former French Minister of 
Culture and Communication 
is the 11th Director-General 
of the Organization and the 
second woman to occupy 
this position. With a long-
standing commitment to the 
universal values of peace, she 
is determined to maintain this 
commitment as the head of 
UNESCO: “a modern UNESCO,” 
which will contribute to shaping 
“the world of tomorrow”.

“My ambition is that UNESCO plays a 
major role in giving a human face to 
globalization,” Audrey Azoulay said, 
on 13 November 2017, during her 
installation as Director-General of 
the Organization. She considers that 
UNESCO is a standard-setter that helps 
society advance – as an expert agency 
contributing to the dissemination of 
knowledge to the greatest number of 
people, and as an intellectual forum for 
the world of tomorrow.
The world of tomorrow needs unity, she 
believes. And to rebuild this unity, it is 
necessary to rely on the universal values 
of peace through education, culture, 
science, and freedom, and to ensure that 
our action is rooted in the long term. 
“By virtue of its missions, its voice and its 
action, UNESCO is in direct contact with 
the future of humanity in the long term,” 
she noted. “This mandate is exercised 
with a key priority given to Africa and 
women. To Africa, in the conviction that 
it is the continent that crystallizes the 
challenges and solutions of our common 
future.” And to women and girls, so 
they may “restore their rightful place as 
agents of their own destiny and a force 
of progress in our societies.”

And the L’Oréal Foundation puts its 
skills and know-how behind this great 
cause to support women researchers 
through every stage of their career − 
bringing them into the public eye and 
emphasizing the importance of a better 
representation of women in scientific 
vocations if we are to solve the great 
challenges of our time.
Why is it important to promote women 
scientists?
The world has never been so 
changeable and uncertain. We are 
undergoing a veritable technological, 
social and environmental revolution, 
and are being confronted with 
challenges we have never faced before. 
How could we deprive ourselves of the 
scientific skills of half the world’s talent? 
How could we shape an inclusive world 
without women? We need to make use 
of all the talent available – obviously 
including women – if we are to address 
the challenges and the extraordinary 
complexity of our times. Yet, women 
continue to be under-represented in 
the world of science, where the glass 
ceiling remains a sad reality. 
Only about 30 per cent of researchers 
are women and three per cent of 
Nobel prizes in the sciences have been 
awarded to women since the prizes 
were established – none in 2017. At 
L’Oréal, both in our company and in our 
Foundation, it is impossible to imagine 
a world without the contribution of 
women.
How can the L’Oréal-UNESCO For 
Women in Science programme further 
the cause of women scientists? 
For the past twenty years, the L’Oréal-
UNESCO For Women in Science 
programme has been using the 
recognition and promotion of women 
in science to demonstrate by example 
that they have a full role to play in 
scientific institutions. 
This is particularly important. The 
promotion of women who serve as 
role models for others is fundamental 
to encouraging and supporting young 
women in scientific careers.
But when we look at the figures, it 
is obvious that this is not enough. 
Over the past ten years, the share of 
women in research has, it is true, risen 
by about twelve per cent. Women 
are increasingly following a career 
in science and represent about half 
of those enrolled in the first years of 
university. But they are still largely 
excluded from higher positions – only 
eleven per cent of senior academic 
posts are held by women, according 
to the UNESCO Science Report: Towards 
2030, published in 2015. 
Even if there is no doubt that our 
programme has helped to raise 
awareness and mobilized the scientific 
community, we obviously have to go 
even further. We have to work with the 
entire ecosystem − in other words, with 
the institutions and public authorities, 
as well as with men. One of the great 
merits of the L’Oréal-UNESCO For 
Women in Science programme is that it 
is far from being only a women’s cause 
being fought by women. It also allows 
women to help shape an inclusive world 
− a prerequisite for fair and balanced 
societies for all, able to respond to the 
challenges of today’s world.
A twenty-year partnership
Three questions for Jean-Paul Agon
This year is the twentieth anniversary 
of the L’Oréal-UNESCO For Women 
in Science programme. How would 
you define the partnership between 
L’Oréal and UNESCO?
L’Oréal’s partnership with UNESCO is 
unique. In 1998, when we launched the 
L’Oréal-UNESCO For Women in Science 
programme, our ambition was to 
promote women scientists by launching 
a prize for scientific excellence that 
is reserved for talented women. In 
order to do this, we were looking for 
a partner that shares this ambitious 
vision of a science – and a society – 
which is more inclusive. Partnering with 
UNESCO became an obvious choice, 
as we share the same humanist and 
universal values. After twenty years 
of collaboration, our programme has 
expanded to a magnificent scale. Not 
only do we award an annual prize to 
five eminent women scientists, each 
representing one of the five continents, 
but we also give awards to young 
researchers in 115 countries. 
Through these initiatives, in twenty 
years we have jointly supported over 
2,700 women. UNESCO is a valued 
partner for making the programme 
truly international. 
Jean-Paul Agon, Chairman and 
Chief Executive Officer of L’Oréal.

When did you first get interested 
in science?
I was always curious. I wanted to know 
how the world functions. Among my 
early experiments is one that I performed 
at age 5 − it ended with an accident. 
I wanted to measure the height from 
the floor to the ceiling in our home. 
At the time, we were living in Jerusalem 
in a four-room apartment shared by three 
families − we were very poor. I went on 
the balcony, I piled up furniture, a table, 
chairs, but still didn’t reach the ceiling. 
I tried to climb on top, but fell into the 
backyard instead and broke my arm. 
Fortunately, I continued to be curious, 
and my scientific ambition survived. 
The challenge
of science
is like climbing Mount Everest
Ada E. Yonath 
Interview by Cathy Nolan
Israeli crystallographer Ada E. Yonath, a 2008 laureate of the L’Oreal-
UNESCO For Women in Science Awards, went on to win the Nobel 
Prize in Chemistry in 2009 for her pioneering discoveries on the 
structure and function of ribosomes, the protein synthesizers in cells. 
Her research has also been key to understanding how antibiotics 
work. In this informal interview, Yonath talks about her life and 
elaborates on two of her favourite topics − conveying the joy of 
science to young people, and encouraging drug companies to 
develop new and better antibiotics. 
With this article, the UNESCO Courier marks the International Day of Women and Girls 
in Science, on 11 February.

You’ve said your parents always 
encouraged you to study, but your early 
years were difficult.
Learning in school or at home was 
never difficult. The difficulties arose 
from our deprived economic situation. 
My secret: I had a perfect memory. 
Then, not now! I was a very good 
student. But survival was difficult. My 
father had a little grocery shop. He 
died when I was 11. I had a baby sister. 
We had very little income, so I had to 
work. I had a million jobs − cleaning 
floors, washing dishes, giving tuition to 
younger kids, babysitting, etc. In high 
school, there was a chemistry lab and 
one of my jobs was to clean it. There 
I could perform my own experiments 
on the side! I used to get up at 5.30 in 
the morning, and had my first student 
at 6 a.m. – I taught mathematics and 
chemistry. I had long days and very little 
sleep, but it didn’t bother me.
Do you think these hardships made you 
more resilient?
Maybe. I was called crazy for years, for 
pursuing projects other scientists said 
were impossible, but it hardly disturbed 
me. What I cared about was seeing 
modest signs of progress in our work, 
not convincing other scientists who said 
there was “no chance”. For me, being 
a scientist was having a luxurious life. 
I could ask the questions that interested 
me, like “how are proteins made within 
cells?”, and I received a salary for that. 
It was a beautiful life. 
What do you say to young people today, 
who don’t want to study science? 
Whenever I have time, I talk to high 
school students – in Israel and also 
around the world, in Spain, Australia, 
India, Japan. I tell them that, for 
me, seeing the first structure of 
the ribosome was an unmatched 
experience! I also tell them that being 
a scientist is a joy. It’s fun. You ask a 
question that really interests you and 
you work on answering it. This is the 
best way to work. If you convince 
funding agencies that your question 
is important, they will pay you to 
answer it. 
I usually compare the challenge of 
science to climbing Mount Everest. 
Getting to the top is fantastic, 
but the climb is also an adventure. 
When I first understood how the 
ribosome works, it created an 
overwhelming internal joy. Even more 
than receiving the Nobel Prize! In 
addition, I was happy that those who 
called me crazy or stupid or a dreamer 
became supporters – because I’m 
human and it’s nice to be recognized.

Has receiving the Nobel Prize 
changed your life?
Now I can do something for young 
people. Before I got the prize, very few 
young people said they would opt for 
science, in a poll in Tel Aviv. The day 
after the Nobel ceremony, a similar 
street poll showed the number of those 
interested in science had gone up by 
forty per cent. Even if only ten per cent 
of these youth take up science, I will feel 
I did something good.

Current affairs
Has being a woman made your path 
more difficult?
I was never a man, so I cannot compare. 
At the same time, I can say that 
throughout my scientific career, I have 
never felt any gender discrimination. 
So far, only four women have received 
Nobel prizes in chemistry. Why do you 
think this is the case?
There are many more women in 
physiology and medicine. I don’t think 
the Nobel Committee is anti-women 
− they gave their prize to Marie Curie 
twice. 
There are fewer women in science 
because society doesn’t encourage 
women to become scientists − even 
societies that are supposedly open and 
liberal. Sentences like: “Don’t try to be 
clever, you’ll never find a husband”, or 
“Don’t choose a demanding career, 
you won’t have a good family life”, are 
frequently repeated. In some societies 
it’s said directly, in others indirectly. It’s 
the same in politics, art, any demanding 
profession. This is even more so in 
science because it may imply that the 
women are cleverer than the men. 
At universities, in science, it starts out 
equal, with fifty per cent male and 
female students. But this changes later. 
Some girls may be better students, but 
they often go to work in somebody 
else’s lab – either because they want 
less pressure at work, and are therefore 
less motivated to become principal 
investigators, or because they prefer 
to allocate more time to their families. 
What can we do to change women’s 
attitudes?
It’s not just women. Society has to 
change its opinions. Education is the 
way. It’s difficult, it will not happen 
tomorrow. When I lecture in schools, 
even if these young people don’t end 
up studying science themselves, it 
could make a difference when they 
have children of their own. 
Scientists can have a rewarding life, at 
home and in the lab. My granddaughter 
named me Grandma of the Year – one 
can be a good grandma and a good 
scientist! When a girl of 15 hears this, 
it makes an impression; five years 
later, in university, maybe she will 
choose science.
Women in science: still a minority
“Gender equality will encourage new solutions and expand the scope of 
research; it should be considered a priority by all if the global community is 
serious about reaching the next set of development goals,” cautions the UNESCO 
Science Report: Towards 2030, (2015). A summary of the situation today. 
As countries grapple with the need to establish a pool of scientists or researchers that 
is commensurate with their ambitions for development, their attitudes to gender 
issues are changing. Some Arab States now have more women than men studying 
natural sciences, health and agriculture at university (Chapter 17). Saudi Arabia 
plans to create 500 vocational training schools to reduce its dependence on foreign 
workers, half of which will train teenage girls (Chapter 17). Some 37% of researchers 
in the Arab world are women, more than in the European Union (33%).
On the whole, women constitute a minority in the research world. They also tend 
to have more limited access to funding than men, and to be less represented in 
prestigious universities and among senior faculty, which puts them at a further 
disadvantage in high-impact academic publishing (Chapter 3).
The regions with the highest shares of women researchers are Southeast Europe 
(49%), the Caribbean, Central Asia and Latin America (44%). Sub-Saharan Africa 
counts 30% women and South Asia, 17%. Southeast Asia presents a contrasting 
picture, with women representing 52% of researchers in the Philippines and Thailand, 
for instance, but only 14% in Japan and 18% in the Republic of Korea (Chapter 3).
Globally, women have achieved parity (45% to 55%) at the bachelor’s and master’s 
levels, where they represent 53% of graduates. At the Ph.D. level, they slip beneath 
parity to 43%. The gap widens at the researcher level, where they now account for 
only 28.4% of researchers, before becoming a gulf at the higher echelons of decision-
making (Chapter 3). 
A number of countries have put policies in place to foster gender equality. Three 
examples are Germany, where the coalition agreement of 2013 introduced a 30% 
quota for women on company boards of directors; Japan, where the selection criteria 
for most large university grants now take into account the proportion of women 
among teaching staff and researchers; and the Democratic Republic of the Congo, 
which established a Ministry for the Promotion of Women and Integration of Women 
in National Development in 2012.
Don’t you have to make sacrifices 
when you make these choices?
Of course, there are sacrifices – science 
is very demanding, both for men and 
women. It’s a question of priorities. 
I didn’t have a policy, I managed things 
as they came up, every day. I went to 
do the work I liked, and I also had the 
family I loved. The important thing is 
to love both these facets of life. 
An interesting example is that of the 
British crystallographer Kathleen 
Lonsdale (1903 to 1971), who took ten 
years off to raise her three children. She 
worked from home – this was before 
computers and internet, in the 1930s – 
documenting the entire mathematical 
background of crystallography. 
She wrote three books, which we still 
use today. 
What qualities does it take to be 
a good scientist?
Curiosity, first. Second, curiosity. And 
third, curiosity!
Also, one has to love, and not be afraid 
of, a challenge. And to have a critical 
spirit, to know if what you are doing is 
important, accurate and original.
Do you have to be competitive? Are you?
It’s possible to not be competitive 
in science. For example, we started 
working on the structure of ribosomes 
in 1980. We got the first indication for 
crystals after six months. Then the first 
potential was detected after four years. 
Two years later, we discovered that the 
crystals do not survive X-irradiation – 
the methodology used for diffraction 
measurement.

This led us to install our biggest 
contribution to life science, called 
cryo-bio-crystallography. All along, 
we published exactly what we did. 
In 1986, I met a scientist who had 
been laughing at me for a long time. 
He said: “We were able to repeat your 
experiment.” It had been sixteen years 
since we had started, by then. I almost 
kissed him! People couldn’t call me 
a deceiver any more. But he saw it 
differently: “Why did you publish it so 
accurately? Weren’t you afraid someone 
would steal it?” I replied: “The result 
is what’s important. I always publish 
correctly.” Competition is not my 
strong point.
Do you think men are more 
competitive?
I don’t know, I think everybody’s 
different. When I talk about challenges, 
I don’t mean trying to be better than 
anybody else. It’s to do the best I can 
in order to solve the problems, and 
progress towards the goals of the 
research.
This is also the advice I give to children: 
don’t compare. Find what you love to 
do most – it could be economics, or 
playing the flute, whatever you have 
passion for – and do your best.
We do hope that although antibiotics 
are considered less profitable, 
companies will grasp the importance of 
the resistance problem alongside the 
new options to reduce it dramatically. 
What are you currently working on?
I still work in the lab, on two things 
– developing the next generation of 
antibiotics, and understanding the 
origins of life. 
Ada Yonath (Israel) was born in 1939

Are you worried about the increasing 
threat posed by antibiotic resistance?
I’m very worried about the resistance 
caused by antibiotics. If you don’t use 
antibiotics, you don’t have resistance, 
but you may die from simple infections. 
We need to develop a new generation 
of better antibiotics. We are currently 
developing these. Examining the 
structure of ribosomes from pathogenic 
bacteria, we have identified a new type 
of antibiotic binding sites, which can 
inhibit protein biosynthesis within cells. 
So far, none of these sites are being 
used by any known antibiotic. Hence, 
we expect slow-developing resistance. 
Also, these are specific to pathogenic 
bacteria, so we expect minimal or no 
harm to the microbiome, or the “good 
bacteria” residing in the human body. 
Additionally, we can use the chemistry 
of these new sites to design fully 
degradable antibiotics, thus preserving 
the environment from the ecological 
burden caused by the non-degradable 
cores of the antibiotics that are 
currently available. In short, applying 
our multidisciplinary approach, we 
expect to optimize the next generation 
of antibiotics to significantly reduce 
resistance – while ensuring maximum 
selectivity, supreme potency, minimal 
toxicity and appropriate degradability.

I am convinced that non-violence is the 
most effective way to combat tyranny 
and find a way out of complex conflicts. 
It is always possible to resort to it. But 
that demands faith, courage and the 
capacity for self-sacrifice. In the end, 
change is achieved at a lower cost, and 
its effects are more powerful and more 
effective. Those who choose violence to 
change things do not always get what 
they want.
For me, non-violence is the common 
denominator of all my actions. I have 
adopted it in what I say, in what I do 
and in my strategies. I never shy away 
from it and I don’t see any alternative. 
What does non-violence mean to you? 
And what is the likely impact of non-
violent civil resistance in countries 
experiencing complex conflicts?
Political violence is the recourse to 
force to achieve political or religious 
objectives and to change the beliefs, 
opinions or behaviour of people in the 
public sphere. There is another type 
of political violence − that is certainly 
hard to condemn, but which I do not 
recommend – it is the use of force as a 
means of resistance to an occupier. 
Non-violence
is the common denominator
of all my actions
Tawakkol Karman
Interview by Anissa Barrak 
and Chen Xiaorong
Without justice, peace will 
always remain fragile − a kind 
of temporary truce, a rest for 
the warrior − which will only 
be followed by something 
more terrible, says Tawakkol 
Karman. The Yemeni feminist, 
journalist and human rights 
activist – one of the winners 
of the Nobel Peace Prize 2011 
– participated in celebrations 
for the International Day of 
Non-Violence at UNESCO on 
2 October 2017.
With this article, the UNESCO Courier 
marks International Women’s Day, 
on 8 March.

As a journalist and political activist, 
you are, first and foremost, defending 
human rights. 
My goal is clear – it is to contribute to 
the establishment of democratic states 
that respect freedoms and human 
rights. This objective can only be 
achieved through a fight against the 
violation of these rights and tyranny − 
and the building of legally-constituted 
states founded upon citizenship and 
institutional integrity. I act in a number 
of ways within civil society and use all 
kinds of platforms, including the media, 
human rights and politics. 
What I try to explain, wherever I go, 
is that tyranny deprives societies of 
development and peace. Societies 
deprived of freedoms and human rights 
live in a state of precarious peace, which 
is doomed to collapse rapidly.
In 2005, you co-founded Women 
Journalists Without Chains, which aims 
to promote freedom of expression and 
democratic rights. What difficulties have 
you encountered over the last decade 
and what has been your main success?
Women Journalists Without Chains 
was founded to combat widespread 
repression in the world of information 
at the time – arrests, beatings and 
various forms of aggression – but also 
to defend the right of every citizen to 
become the owner of a media, whether 
print, radio and television or digital. 
We put a great deal of effort into 
defending the civil and political rights 
of citizens. We participated in several 
actions to fight against corruption 
and the abuse of power. We organized 
sit-ins and demonstrations to help 
citizens stand up to the domination of 
influential tribal leaders.

It was a long struggle, on a daily basis, 
which resulted in the release of a large 
number of journalists who had been 
detained or abducted. This also made it 
possible for a number of independent 
and opposition newspapers that 
were previously banned, to be 
published again. 
Even before the peaceful revolution of 
11 February 2011 (in Egypt), I helped, 
along with others, to reduce violations 
by the incumbent regime (in Yemen). 
We created a force of civil pressure in 
order to preserve a minimum of rights 
and to raise the level of demands. After 
this civil revolution, Yemen entered 
a period of transition, where people 
could fully enjoy their rights and 
freedoms. There were no restrictions 
on freedom of expression, of assembly, 
the right to demonstrate or any other 
form of rights and freedoms. Everyone 
benefited, without distinction. There 
were no arrests or detentions – until 
the coup of January 2015 and the war 
that followed.
Peace does not 
just mean the end 
of war; it is also 
the end of oppression 
and injustice
What is your view of Yemen today, 
devastated by what you have called a 
“total war”? What do you plan to do to 
ensure a better future for your country? 
We can only think about the future of a 
country when peace has been restored. 
But peace does not just mean the end 
of war; it is also the end of oppression 
and injustice. There can be no peace 
without justice, because, without 
justice, peace will always remain fragile 
− a kind of temporary truce, a rest for 
the warrior – and which will only be 
followed by something more terrible. 
And the worst of wars are those waged 
by tyrannical regimes against their own 
people. This is why I remain convinced 
of the need to oppose regimes that do 
not respect rights and freedoms and 
which are unable to guarantee them, 
whether for individuals or institutions. 
They have to be replaced.
My struggle today, as in the past, 
remains focused on democracy: to put 
an end to the situation imposed by 
the coup d’état in Yemen and to hold a 
referendum on the draft constitution 
− which has already found consensus 
during the national dialogue set up 
during the period of transition. After 
that, elections can be held. 
Consequently, when political life returns 
to normal, I plan to found a political 
party which will bring together youth 
and women to carry forward the civic 
project advocated by the revolution. On 
the international front, I will continue to 
fight to defend human rights, promote 
peace and combat tyranny. 
In October 2011, you received the Nobel 
Peace Prize with Ellen Johnson Sirleaf 
and Leymah Gbowee. What is it that 
unites you all? 
The dreams we share are the building 
of a civil state, the use of non-violence 
as the only way to operate, and the 
defence of women’s rights for effective 
participation in political affairs. With 
Ellen Johnson Sirleaf, we have worked 
together with the United Nations on 
the Sustainable Development Goals. As 
for Leymah Gbowee, we have worked 
together to promote peace and human 
rights, particularly through the Nobel 
Women’s Initiative – which includes four 
other women Nobel Peace laureates 
– and the Nobel Peace Prize Forum, 
which works to coordinate action to 
promote peace and combat tyranny 
and violence.

The generalissimo of the peace movement
Bertha von Suttner, known as the "generalissimo of the peace movement", 
established the Austrian Peace Society in 1891. It aimed to prevent war, carrying out 
research into the causes of conflict, promoting pacifist thinking and supporting all 
efforts to establish international legislation as the basis for the peaceful settlement of 
all international disputes.
As a recognized journalist and activist, von Suttner was elected Honorary President 
of the Permanent International Peace Bureau when it was founded in 1891 in 
Bern, Switzerland. A year later, she established the German Peace Society with her 
countryman, the pacifist and journalist Alfred Hermann Fried (Nobel Peace Prize 1911 
laureate). 
As an author, she gained celebrity with her anti-war novel, Lay Down Your Arms! 
(1889). The novel was translated into more than ten languages and became one 
of nineteenth- century Europe’s most influential books – contributing, to a certain 
extent, to undermining the militaristic mindset prevalent at the time. 
Bertha von Suttner was the first woman to win the Nobel Peace Prize, in 1905. She 
was followed by Jane Addams (1931), Emily Greene Balch (1946), Betty Williams and 
Mairead Corrigan (1976), Mother Teresa (1979), Alva Myrdal (1982), Aung San Suu 
Kyi (1991), Rigoberta Menchú Tum (1992), Jody Williams (1997), Shirin Ebadi (2003), 
Wangari Muta Maathai (2004), Ellen Johnson Sirleaf, Leymah Gbowee and Tawakkol 
Karman (2011) and Malala Yousafzai (2014).
The Norwegian Nobel Committee said 
that it hoped, among other things, that 
the 2011 prize would “help to bring an 
end to the suppression of women that 
still occurs in many countries…”. What 
could Arab women do to contribute to 
peacebuilding? 
We have led a long campaign to end the 
repression of women, and the struggle 
continues. This will not happen within 
a matter of days or months, but I remain 
convinced that we will succeed one day. 
Unfortunately, in the Middle East, more 
than elsewhere, women are exposed 
to repression. Adding to the violations 
of women’s rights, especially in the 
Arab Spring countries, has been a 
lust for wealth. This, in some cases, 
has led to the sponsorship of coups 
d’état, counter-revolutions and even 
collaborations with the enemy. But 
we are determined to continue our 
struggle. Arab women are the driving 
force of sustainable peace in their 
countries and in the region. 
In one sentence, how would you 
summarize your philosophy of life?
I was born into a family whose 
philosophy of life revolved around two 
words – righteousness and justice. 
My father is a man of the law, and one 
of the earliest constitutionalists in the 
country. He is known for his efforts to 
fight against corruption and nepotism, 
and for his integrity in the high public 
offices he has held. Thanks to him, 
I acquired the legal culture needed to 
assert rights and conquer freedoms, the 
courage to speak the truth and confront 
oppression and injustice. He taught 
me to take initiatives, to be part of the 
solution and not part of the problem. 
My mother taught me to love people 
and to understand their suffering. 
To summarize my philosophy, I would 
say that it is possible to fight against 
violence and repression without 
resorting to violence and repression.
Tawakkol Karman (Yemen), Nobel 
Peace Prize 2011 laureate (with Ellen 
Johnson Sirleaf and Leymah Gbowee), 
is a feminist and human rights activist 
and one of the leading figures of the 
Arab Spring in Yemen. She has been 
arrested several times for organizing 
peaceful protests against Ali Abdullah 
Saleh (1942-2017), who was president 
of Yemen for over thirty years till 2011.

Nüshu literally means “women’s writing” 
in Chinese. Today it is the world’s only 
script designed and used exclusively by 
women. It was developed among the 
rural women of the Xiao River valley, in 
the Jiangyong county of China’s Hunan 
province, where there is a mixture of 
Han culture and Yao folkways.
Nüshu characters are a rhomboid variant 
derived from square Chinese characters, 
adapted to the local dialect (Chengguan 
Tuhua). The characters are formed 
with dots and three kinds of strokes 
− horizontals, virgules and arcs. These 
elongated letters are written with very 
fine and thread-like lines.
The earliest known artefact in the Nüshu 
script is a bronze coin discovered in 
Nanjing, the capital of Jiangsu province. 
It was minted during the Taiping 
Heavenly Kingdom, a rebel kingdom 
in China from 1851 to 1864, which 
introduced important social reforms and 
adopted − to a certain extent − several 
policies regarding gender equality. 
The eight characters etched in Nüshu 
on the coin mean “all the women in the 
world are members of the same family”.
A culture of sunshine 
Nüshu was taught mainly by mothers 
to their daughters and practised for 
fun among sisters and friends. It was 
used by women in a feudal society who 
lacked access to education in reading 
and writing. 
Nüshu: from tears to sunshine
by Chen Xiaorong
Nüshu is considered to be the 
world’s only writing system that 
is created and used exclusively 
by women. Originating in 
China’s Jiangyong county 
in the nineteenth century, 
it gave rise, over time, to a 
traditional female culture, 
which is endangered today. 
The country’s local and 
national authorities are 
working to revive it. 
He Jingua, writing the phrase 
“mysterious scripts through the ages” 
in Nüshu characters.

This syllabic script was generally used 
for writing autobiographies, letters 
between sworn sisters, and sanzhaoshu 
– "third day missives" of good wishes, 
presented to a bride by her closest 
friends, three days after her wedding. 
It was also used to record folk songs, 
riddles and translations of ancient 
Chinese poems, and to compose songs 
for farm women that promoted morality 
– stressing the importance of helping 
their husbands and encouraging 
frugality in household management. 
All of these works are in poetry form 
− most are seven-character poems and 
a few have five characters.
According to Zhao Liming, a professor at 
Tsinghua University in Beijing, Nüshu is 
not just a script − it represents a typical 
Chinese traditional female culture. It 
was like a ray of sunshine that made 
women’s lives more pleasant. “It is a 
culture of sunshine,” she says, “which 
allows women to speak up with their 
own voices and to fight against male 
chauvinism.”
As a Nüshu practitioner once said, “Men 
have their script, books and texts; they 
are men of honour. We have our own 
script, books and texts; we are women 
of honour.” 
Zhao explains that it was customary 
for women to gather together to sew 
clothes and sing Nüshu songs. The 
Nüshu script can be found inscribed on 
paper and fans, and also embroidered 
on clothes, handkerchiefs and belts. 
“Each woman in Jiangyong county was 
responsible for writing a biography,” 
she continues. “Those who didn’t know 
how to write might have others write 
for them. Daughters would also write 
biographies for their mothers, after 
their deaths.”
Like a fragile plant, Nüshu withered 
when its writer died. When older women 
felt the end was near, they would often 
ask family members to place some of 
their writing in their coffins and to burn 
other pieces of their work. Thus, most 
of a woman’s work was buried with her; 
her descendants were often left with 
only a few examples. 
“The content of Nüshu works comes 
from women’s everyday lives – marriage, 
family, social interactions, anecdotes, 
songs and riddles. These are rich in folk 
custom and are important for the study of 
linguistics, grammatology, archaeology, 
anthropology and other human and 
social sciences,” explains Zhao, who has 
been studying Nüshu for thirty years.
After several years of research, her team 
at the Tsinghua University collected and 
translated over ninety-five per cent of 
all existing original documents written 
in Nüshu, to produce the five-volume 
Chinese Nüshu Collection, published in 
2005 − the most complete anthology of 
Nüshu works to date. 
Before it, only one chapter of the book, 
A Ten-year History of Jiangyong, published 
in 1959, was dedicated to Nüshu. The 
first documentary evidence of this script 
is found in the 1933 Survey Notes on 
Counties of Hunan Province. 
“Women used their own script to tell 
stories, to comfort each other, to sing 
out sorrow and to express admiration. 
In the process, a paradise was built,” says 
Zhao. “Tianguang (heavenly light) is a 
word that often occurs in Nüshu works.”

Current affairs
Nüshu practitioners found comfort 
in this word, which could guide them 
through all their sorrows and difficulties 
to a better life. “None ever committed 
suicide, in fact, because Tianguang made 
them stronger and more optimistic. 
Through their tears, they never stopped 
seeking the light of the sun.”
A script from tears 
“This script helped women in Jiangyong 
to dry their tears,” says Tan Dun, 
renowned Chinese composer and 
conductor, and UNESCO Goodwill 
Ambassador. “When I hear their beautiful 
songs, I can see their tears.” In 2008, he 
went back to Hunan, his home province, 
to research Nüshu culture. “At the gate 
of Shanggangtang village, there is an 
800-year-old Song Dynasty bridge. Half 
of it has collapsed. It reminded me of 
Nüshu, which is also on the verge of 
extinction,” he wrote in his travel diary. 
Tan Dun promised himself he would 
help save this script, the characters of 
which look like “musical notes flying 
along on the wind”. Some of them 
reminded him of the harp and the 
Chinese stringed pipa. The idea for a 
new symphony, Nüshu: The Secret Songs 
of Women, was born. Since 2013, the 
Philadelphia Orchestra (United States), 
the Royal Concertgebouw Orchestra 
(the Netherlands), and the NHK 
Symphony Orchestra (Japan) have co-
produced performances of this Nüshu 
symphonic poem at several prestigious 
musical venues across the world. From 
a confidential women’s culture, Nüshu 
is becoming a “global culture that 
belongs to the world,” Tan Dun tells us. 
According to the composer, the success 
of his symphony “shows the world’s 
respect for women’s Utopia.”
The thirteen-movement modern 
symphony, which combines Eastern and 
Western musical forms, reflects different 
aspects of Nüshu culture − songs about 
dressing for the wedding ceremony, the 
daughter’s separation from her mother 
on her wedding day, remembering 
fifty years of married life, longing for 
childhood friends, and so on. The 
central instrument is the harp, which, 
according to the composer, sounds like 
“a woman telling a story and crying”. He 
has incorporated thirteen short videos, 
recorded during his journey home in 
2008, into the production. It was the 
first time that someone filmed Nüshu 
traditional culture.
In Shanggangtang, he met six women 
who can still write Nüshu and who 
have been designated by the county 
government as keepers of the Nüshu 
tradition. Thanks to them, this ancient 
culture can be passed on to new 
generations. 
“For me, the secret of immortality is the 
effort to preserve endangered cultural 
traditions and deliver them to the 
future,” notes Tan Dun. 
Extinction and rebirth
The death of centenarian Yang Huanyi 
on 20 September 2004 marked the start 
of the “post-Nüshu era”. Yang was one of 
the most famous writers and holders of 
Nüshu culture.

Current affairs
The progressive disappearance of Nüshu 
culture and the need to protect it have 
aroused particular attention at all levels 
of government. In 2002, Nüshu was 
added to the Chinese National Register 
of Documentary Heritage. Since 2003, 
the introduction of Nüshu workshops in 
Jiangyong county has helped develop 
this culture by attracting more people to 
learn about it. In 2006, the State Council 
listed Nüshu as a national intangible 
cultural heritage.
A Nüshu museum was built in Puwei 
Island, Jiangyong county, in May 2007. 
This beautiful island, surrounded by the 
Xiao river, was home to many famous 
Nüshu authors, making it an important 
place for Nüshu culture. According to 
Yang Cheng, Director of the Jiangyong 
Publicity Department, “the special 
Nüshu culture is the crystallization 
of the collective wisdom of women 
whose spiritual pursuits of intelligence, 
sense of self-respect, self-improvement 
and innovation have allowed various 
civilizations in the world to blossom with 
radiant splendour. And the protection 
of this national culture requires not only 
attention from academics, artists and 
officials, but also, more importantly, the 
cultural awareness of local people.” 
Over the years, China has made an 
effort to develop language legislation 
and planning, as well as to improve 
the digitalization and standardization 
of language. As part of the Chinese 
government’s plan to protect language 
resources, launched in 2015, Jiangyong 
has been designated as a pilot area for 
an ecolinguistics project.
Local governments are currently 
commissioning Nüshu specialists 
(researchers and authors) to prepare 
easy-to-understand manuals to explain 
the historical background, values and 
basic elements of Nüshu culture − 
stressing its significance and the need 
for its preservation. This content will 
be included in primary and secondary 
elective courses, to popularize the 
unique women’s script.
Colourful style
Because Nüshu was used among women 
to write the local dialect, its writing 
was not standardized, meaning each 
practitioner had her own, often highly 
colourful, wording and phrasing style. 
To put the transmission of the script 
on a more scientific footing, Zhao and 
her team worked on “Nüshu Character 
Unification”. Among the 220,000 
characters used by Nüshu practitioners, 
they chose the most frequently used, 
based on a statistical survey. In 2015, 
397 Nüshu characters were admitted 
by the International Organization for 
Standardization (ISO) and in March 
2017, China’s proposal to include Nüshu 
characters into the Universal Coded 
Character Set was approved. 
The conservation and protection 
of Nüshu culture represents a huge 
and complex social project. With the 
increasing exploitation of cultural 
space and the development of the 
information era, Nüshu is making 
progress in the endeavour to ensure 
its survival. Among its enthusiasts, 
some simply admire this charming old 
script, others are exploring business 
opportunities and developing creative 
products. And some are seizing the 
opportunity to promote a fine example 
of women’s traditional culture.

Current affairs
Beginning in 2007, the European 
Investment Bank (EIB) and the World 
Bank began issuing “green” bonds 
(also known as “climate” bonds) as a 
loan mechanism to show the use of 
proceeds applied to environment-
positive projects. Though the terms 
are often used interchangeably, in 
the case of climate bonds, the use of 
proceeds were further refined to apply 
to climate change mitigation and/
or adaptation projects. The standing 
of these institutions inspired market 
confidence, while a handful of other 
donor and multilateral institutions 
followed their lead.
However, as an investment category, 
green and climate bonds remained 
relatively niche markets, with limited 
impact until about 2013, when issuances 
tripled to around $10 billion, after 
commercial finance and corporate 
institutions began promoting the 
market. These trends continued and 
expanded to $86.1 billion in 2016, 
surpassing $100 billion in 2017.
As a source of climate finance, this 
total is on par with the Paris Climate 
Agreement’s (within the United Nations 
Framework Convention on Climate 
Change (UNFCCC), and which came into 
force on 4 November 2016) call to reach 
$100 billion worth of climate finance by 
2020. In China alone, green and climate 
bonds have crossed $36.2 billion in 2016.
How green are green 
bonds?
While the market pool has grown rapidly, 
some investors have expressed concern 
that the credibility of these new bonds 
as environmental investments may be 
questionable with the new categories 
of issues. How green are green bonds, 
and could the exposure of ineffective 
investments cause a collapse or systemic 
risk within the market category? 
Climate scientists predict global 
warming of 4–6 °C by the end of the 
century. At the same time, the world 
is entering an age of unprecedented 
urbanization and related infrastructure 
development. To ensure sustainable 
development, this infrastructure needs 
to be both low-carbon and resilient to 
climate change, without compromising 
the kind of economic growth needed to 
improve the livelihoods and well-being 
of the world’s most vulnerable citizens. 
Ensuring that the infrastructure built is 
low-carbon raises the annual investment 
needs by three per cent to four per 
cent, to $6.2 trillion, according to the 
Global Commission on the Economy 
and Climate’s 2016 New Climate 
Economy Report. Climate adaptation 
needs add another significant amount 
of investment, estimated at $280 billion 
to $500 billion per annum by 2050, 
even for a 2 °C scenario (United Nations 
Environment Programme (UNEP)’s 2016 
Adaptation Finance Gap Report).

infrastructure investment such as 
governments and commercial banks, are 
insufficient to meet capital requirement 
needs to 2030. Institutional investors, 
particularly pension and sovereign 
wealth funds, are increasingly being 
considered viable actors to fill these 
financing gaps. 
Green bonds, which provide an 
opportunity to mobilize capital for 
green, or environmentally sustainable, 
investments, have emerged as 
key financing instruments for the 
application of nature-based solutions 
(NBS). Globally, the green and climate 
bond market is only about a decade old.
Financing natural resilience: 
a new wave
by John H. Matthews, Lily Dai and Anna Creed
The 2018 edition of the World Water Development Report focuses 
on nature-based solutions for water. The issuance of water bonds 
is a relatively new phenomenon in this field, attracting private 
investment towards a sustainable future for natural resources, 
especially water. A new set of global scoring criteria for these bonds 
could help transform the financial markets and boost investment 
in nature-based solutions. 
The United Nations World Water 
Development Report (WWDR), 
released annually on World Water 
Day (22 March) and published by 
UNESCO’s World Water Assessment 
Programme (WWAP) – in close 
collaboration with members and 
partners of UN-Water – is the UN’s 
flagship report that focuses on 
different strategic water issues 
each year.

The need for open and independent 
standards was identified recently 
by a number of non-governmental 
organizations (NGOs) working with 
sustainability issues in the finance and 
investor communities. Water was shown 
to be a gap area, since freshwater 
resources are often relatively hidden 
to investors, who may not readily 
see water embedded within energy, 
agriculture, and urban projects − much 
less how the water within one project 
may affect other issues and systems 
within the same basin.
In mid-2014, a consortium of NGOs − 
Ceres, Climate Bonds Initiative, World 
Resources Institute, CDP (formerly 
the Carbon Disclosure Project), the 
Stockholm International Water Institute 
(SIWI), and the Alliance for Global Water 
Adaptation (AGWA) − coordinated the 
development of criteria to score the 
quality of water-related investments for 
their relevance to climate mitigation 
and climate adaptation. Together, they 
organized a series of technical and 
industry working groups, which defined 
scoring criteria for issuers and verifiers 
to provide investor confidence in 
climate bonds. 
Evaluating nature-
based solutions
These criteria effectively score the 
climate resilience and climate adaptive 
potential of these bonds in addition 
to their environmental impact. These 
issues remain well understood by 
engineers, scientists, and resource 
managers. But the level of even basic 
awareness among investor and finance 
groups is far more limited. Phase 1 of 
the work targeted traditional “grey” 
water infrastructure investments, with 
the exclusion of hydropower, and was 
launched in October 2016.
More broadly, the risk of greenwashing 
for nature-based solutions − 
investments in green and hybrid 
infrastructure − are very high. No 
science-based standard for such 
investments exists, much less the ability 
to certify that the ecosystems involved 
will themselves endure and be resilient 
to climate impacts. 
Recognizing this gap, the Rockefeller 
Foundation provided support in 2016 
to develop phase 2 criteria to evaluate 
and qualify nature-based solutions 
(NBS) for water investments. NBS 
investments depend explicitly on the 
use of ecosystems to provide grey 
infrastructure-like services, such as 
through so-called natural or green and 
hybrid infrastructure. Such services 
could include storm-water and flood 
protection through riparian ecosystems, 
water treatment in wetlands, and water 
storage in aquifers. These additional 
criteria were launched in early 2018.
Together, both phases evaluate the 
climate mitigation impact, and the 
ability of the investment to contribute 
to climate change adaptation.
In May 2016, the San Francisco Public 
Utilities Commission (SFPUC) in 
California, United States, issued the 
world’s first certified green bond for 
water, for $240 million. A second bond 
for $259 million was issued by the 
SFPUC in December 2016. Both bonds 
are certified under the Climate Bonds 
Standard, an investor screening tool 
that specifies the criteria that must be 
met for bonds to be labelled “green” or 
earmarked for funding water-related 
low-carbon initiatives. 
In July 2017, the City of Cape Town 
issued South Africa’s first certified 
green bond for 1 billion South African 
rand. In September 2017, the China 
Development Bank (CDB), a state-
owned policy bank, announced that 
it will issue green bonds for 5 billion 
yuan to raise funds for water resource 
protection along the Yangtze River 
Economic Belt, the China Daily 
newspaper reported.
The successful issuance 
and sale of green bonds 
against the Standard 
represents a vivid shift in 
investor awareness

The successful issuance and sale of 
these and other bonds against the 
Standard represents a vivid shift in 
investor awareness. To date, more than 
$1 billion have been issued against 
the grey criteria − a number that is 
expected to be rapidly achieved with 
the integrated nature-based solutions 
criteria as well. 
In a time of ecological and climate 
transformation, these criteria are also 
helping to transform finance itself.

Current affairs
Anti-Semitism is not a contemporary 
phenomenon. It is a centuries-old evil. 
Since the capture of Jerusalem by Titus 
in 70 AD, since the dispersal of the Jews, 
mainly throughout the Mediterranean 
basin, when they were sold as slaves in 
such large numbers that market prices (to 
use a modern economic term) plummeted 
in the Roman Empire − the condition 
of the Jews for two millennia, especially 
in Europe, has never ceased to involve 
exclusion, suffering, and persecution. Since 
that distant Roman period, I would say 
we know of three forms of anti-Semitism, 
which sometimes merge.
From religious to 
nationalist and racial 
anti-Semitism
The first form of anti-Semitism is 
religious. Since Constantine’s Edict of 
Milan recognizing Christianity as an 
official religion in 313, anti-Semitism has 
always nourished itself on the hatred 
of the “Jewish deicide”, those who killed 
Jesus Christ. Throughout the periods of 
persecution and massacres, the possibility 
was sometimes – though not always – 
offered to Jews to escape death or exile 
by forced conversion, even if they became 
Jews again when times were less cruel. 
The long, culturally rich history of the 
Marranos, particularly in the Iberian 
states, is an illustration of this.
With the birth of modern nations, 
anti-Semitism became essentially 
nationalist. The Jews, even when they 
were natives of the countries in which 
they lived, were always foreigners who 
were suspect. The fact that the Jews had 
quite naturally assumed responsibilities, 
despite the ostracism inflicted on them, 
and that they held eminent positions in 
political, economic and financial spheres, 
made them, at the slightest national 
crisis, potential traitors − always in the 
service of a mythical “international Jewish 
conspiracy” imagined by the anti-Semites.
This was particularly the case in France. 
I do not need to recall the significance 
of the Dreyfus affair (a political scandal 
and notable example of a miscarriage 
of justice, 1894 to 1906) in this respect. 
Because if we had been looking at things 
with lucidity for a moment, there was no 
reason why Alfred Dreyfus − a wealthy 
Alsatian Jew who hated Germany and 
wanted, first of all, to serve France – 
should be a traitor.
by Robert Badinter
Over the course of history, anti-
Semitism has continued to raise 
its ugly head. It first emerged 
under religious pretexts in the 
Middle Ages, then appeared 
as nationalism from the 
nineteenth century onwards, 
before assuming a scientific 
claim in Nazi ideology. Since the 
end of the Second World War, it 
has reappeared, in the guise of 
anti-Zionism. History urges us 
to be vigilant. Robert Badinter 
draws lessons from it that 
are rich with meaning − and 
warnings.
With this article, the UNESCO Courier 
contributes to the commemoration 
of the International Holocaust 
Remembrance Day on 27 January.

A wealth of significant 
lessons and warnings
I will not repeat here the long list of 
increasing persecutions suffered by the 
Jews − first in the Third Reich and then in 
the territories occupied by the German 
army. Today, countless studies have 
unveiled the scope and the horror of the 
Jewish genocide by the Nazis. Nor will 
I return to the remarkable historical and 
philosophical works which have dealt 
with this phenomenon.
What I would like to emphasize is this, 
which seems to me the most significant 
and cautionary lesson: what is quite 
remarkable and difficult to understand is 
that a great Christian people – cultivated 
among all the peoples of Europe, from 
which emerged numerous geniuses of 
art, thought and scientific research – was 
the bearer, organizer and perpetrator of 
the most terrible persecutions against 
the Jews that have ever blighted the 
history of Europe. It is essential to 
remember this, for in Europe there were 
no countries where the love of culture, 
the passion for art, especially music, and 
scientific research, were held higher 
than in Germany, at the end of the 
Weimar Republic.
This is precisely UNESCO’s opportunity 
for reflection. Because if there was one 
country that shone by its philosophy, it 
was Germany − Germany before Hitler. 
And it is this country – yielding to every 
fury of anti-Semitism and racism – that 
orchestrated the cruellest episodes the 
Jews have ever known. 
The lesson – and that is why I am 
insisting – is that culture, knowledge, 
and a love of the arts are not enough 
to constitute insurmountable ramparts 
against anti-Semitism, since it was here 
that it established itself with the most 
terrible horror.
Let me be understood clearly: in no 
way do I mean that we – disciples of the 
Enlightenment, who believe, throughout 
every ordeal, in the progress of humanity 
through the benefits of enlightened 
education and just institutions based on 
the philosophy of human rights – must 
renounce the struggle for ever-needed 
progress. But we must take into account 
the fact that neither education nor art, 
per se, nor culture in the broadest sense 
of the word, are by their very nature 
sufficient defences against the fury of 
racism and anti-Semitism. We must learn 
from this.
By the end of the nineteenth century, 
minds had evolved. Anti-Semitism 
strove to be scientific in the image of 
the modern disciplines. It became racial: 
the Jews being defined as a “race” of 
mysterious eastern origin that could not 
be assimilated by the peoples among 
whom they settled – especially those 
who claimed to belong to a superior 
Aryan race, who felt threatened with 
degeneration by the presence of Jews, 
with their numerous flaws, in their midst.
Recognition of Jewish 
citizenship
Thus, in the form of prohibitions, 
consignment to ghettos, markings on 
clothing – as if they were dangerous 
animals – Jews appear, in the long history 
of humanity, as an accursed species. 
Hence, the extreme importance we 
must attach to the French Revolution, 
which for the first time in history, in 1791, 
proclaimed that Jews living in France 
would be considered full French citizens.
A little anecdote: on the day the 
citizenship of the Jews was voted on, at 
the end of the Constituent Assembly, the 
Dauphine, sister of Louis XVI, wrote these 
words to a cousin of the royal Austrian 
Hapsburg family in Vienna: “The Assembly 
has reached the height of its folly, it has 
made the Jews citizens.”
If I stress this point, it is because the 
desire to make Jews full citizens, attained 
with difficulty in the parliamentary 
proceedings, is exactly what the Nazis 
hated the most – namely, human 
rights and the philosophy of the Age of 
Enlightenment. As stated in Adolf Hitler’s 
Mein Kampf, the Jews must be excluded 
absolutely from the community of the 
German people. This rabid anti-Semitism 
is at the origin of the racial laws of the 
Third Reich, adopted in Nuremberg in 
1935, the purpose of which, I would 
remind you, was “the protection of 
German blood and German honour” − 
supposedly defiled by the presence of 
the Jews.
I leave aside the impossibility that the 
racial theory has encountered, of finding 
scientific criteria. The scholars of the 
Third Reich sought hard and, of course, 
found nothing. And so they fell back on 
religious practice. 
The criteria adopted by the Nuremberg 
laws forbade any possibility for Jews to 
leave, through any kind of conversion, the 
herd of these evil beings to which they 
belonged by birth.
A woman endures a “scientific” racial 
examination during the Second World 
War, to establish her Jewish identity.

director Joseph Losey, 1976.

Anti-Zionism
The Third Reich collapsed, its founder 
committed suicide, his main henchmen 
were hanged, or they vanished. The 
immensity of the Jewish genocide in 
Europe was discovered, which gave rise 
to a powerful movement − at the newly-
created United Nations − in favour of 
the creation of a Jewish state. The Allies 
had, moreover, already made such a 
commitment between 1914 and 1918.
The creation of a Jewish state in Palestine 
− which we must remember ensued from 
a United Nations decision, UN Resolution 
181(II) of 29 November 1947 − was not 
accepted by all. The result was a war, 
launched by the armed forces of the 
neighbouring Arab states. They invaded 
Palestine, the conflict turned to the 
advantage of the Jews and the rest is 
history. The Israeli-Palestinian conflict has, 
in fact, never ceased since the creation of 
the State of Israel.

Current affairs
I am not going to discuss the legitimacy 
of the rights of the various parties here, 
nor the best solution to end this conflict 
– these issues need to be discussed in 
other forums. But that is the reality. What 
is certain is that in the context of the 
Israeli-Palestinian conflict, anti-Semitism 
has once again spread widely under the 
name of anti-Zionism.
We must have the lucidity to recognize 
that under this label that refers to 
Zionism, it is indeed the Jews, and Jews 
everywhere, who are targeted. And I 
would say that anti-Zionism under the 
surface is nothing but the contemporary 
expression of anti-Semitism, namely, 
hatred of the Jews.
The new battleground
Today’s anti-Semitism, of course, does 
not present itself in the same form as the 
one dating back to Constantine. It widely 
and successfully uses social media; 
speeches and videos, posted on certain 
websites, are based on a particularly 
perverse rhetoric. I have pondered at 
length what might have happened in 
pre-1939 Europe if Dr. Goebbels (Reich 
Minister of Propaganda of Nazi Germany, 
1933 to 1945) had had access to the 
same technical means that we have 
today in the digital age. This is the new 
battleground, as far as the fight against 
anti-Semitism is concerned. 
I would simply state my conviction, as 
a man who has lived a long time, and 
who has never seen anti-Semitism lose 
its hold − that as long as the Israeli-
Palestinian conflict continues, it is clear 
to me that hatred of the Jews, far beyond 
the Middle East, will continue to inflame 
some Muslims, especially the younger 
ones, inspired by the internet and the 
shrill propaganda of the violent images 
familiar to us. 
Hence the atrocious attacks that occur 
throughout the West, notably in France 
and in the Middle East, where the 
conflation of “Jewish equals Zionist” 
feeds anti-Semitic hatred. It is enough to 
look at a list of the victims of the crimes 
committed in the last few years. 
A recent image haunts my mind: a man, 
pursuing Jewish children in a Jewish 
school, and a little girl running away. And 
because she is running, this man grabs her 
by the hair and shoots her point-blank. 
What is this crime, if not a replica of 
the acts of the SS (The Schutzstaffel, 
the paramilitary organization of the 
Nazi party)? A horrifying expression of 
anti-Semitism, this image traverses time, 
reminding us of the Einsatzgruppen 
(SS death squads, 1939 to 1945) let loose 
in the ghettos of Eastern Europe. 
Action for civil peace 
Finally, I would like to point out, and to 
stress emphatically, one thing concerning 
action for civil peace. It is the importance 
of the role – and I would say for some, the 
fraternal role – of representatives of the 
Muslim community who denounce these 
crimes. Conflation here is another trap 
set by terrorism, and we certainly must 
not yield to it. I always stress the results of 
studies on terrorism by think-tanks, which 
have found that eighty per cent of the 
victims of terrorism in the world today 
are Muslims. I want to emphasize this 
fact, because conflation here would be 
reprehensible. 
My message is not overly optimistic, 
I know, but I believe that complacency 
nourishes prejudice, and that prejudice 
nourishes death, because it breeds 
hatred. If we can make the principles of 
the Enlightenment and human rights 
triumph in the minds of the younger 
generations, we will have served the right 
cause − that of peace among peoples. 
A French lawyer and Professor of Law, 
Robert Badinter was France’s Minister 
of Justice from 1981 to 1986. He is 
best known for obtaining a vote in 
French parliament to abolish the death 
penalty in 1981. Badinter was appointed 
President of the Constitutional Council 
from 1986 to 1995, and elected Senator 
(Socialist Party) for the Hauts-de-Seine 
department from 1995 to 2011.

The Courier first appeared in three 
language editions: English, French, and 
Spanish. That was steadily increased 
over the years, until, by 1988, thirty-five 
different language editions were being 
published – plus four different language 
editions in Braille.
In 1949, 40,000 copies of the magazine 
were produced; this figure rose to 
500,000 by the beginning of the 1980s. 
It was estimated that each copy would 
be read by more than four people, which 
meant the Courier had a readership 
of over two million. You could buy 
it at newsagents; you could take out 
a subscription, or you could find it 
in libraries.
The Courier was never well-known in the 
United Kingdom or the United States. 
But if you ask people – especially those 
in their 50s, brought up elsewhere – it’s 
astonishing how many of them will say: 
“Yes, I remember the Courier. We used to 
get it”, or even, “That’s where I first learned 
about anthropology”. I myself have heard 
statements like that from people as far 
afield as Indonesia, India, Pakistan, Ghana, 
Brazil, and Jamaica.
The UNESCO Courier is 70!
An inspiring read
by Alan Tormaid Campbell
Since its inception in 1948, the impact of this iconic magazine has 
been far-reaching, enthralling readers across the globe. Covering a 
vast array of topics, its contributors have included the biggest names 
in their fields. UNESCO’s actions against racism have been on the top 
of the agenda since the beginning – the Courier has always provided 
a powerful platform for debate and discussion of this dangerous and 
widespread prejudice that continues to blight our world. 
The UNESCO Courier, July-August 1950. 
Wide global horizons
The Courier was founded by the 
remarkable Sandy Koffler. The purpose 
of the magazine was to have – to use his 
famous phrase – “A window open on the 
world”, through which readers could look 
out onto “the wide global horizons”. 
Koffler, an American, graduated from 
the City College of New York, and was 
studying at the Sorbonne in Paris when 
his plans were cut short by the Second 
World War. Joining the Psychological 
Warfare Branch of the American army, 
Koffler’s war experience included 
landing with the troops of Operation 
Torch when the Allies invaded Vichy-
French North Africa in November 1942. 
There he started radio broadcasts in 
Rabat (Morocco) and Algiers (Algeria), 
before becoming a Voice of America 
correspondent – a job he held 
throughout the Italian campaign of 
1944-1945. 
UNESCO came into being in the mid-
1940s. Remembering the horrors of the 
Second World War, the preamble to the 
Constitution of UNESCO includes a phrase 
that is both haunting and inspiring: “Since 
wars begin in the minds of men, it is in 
the minds of men that the defences of 
peace must be constructed”.
Richard Hoggart, a British academic 
who was Assistant Director-General at 
UNESCO (1971 to 1975), wrote: “The 
extraordinary assertions within UNESCO’s 
Constitution – that governments will 
collectively promote the objective pursuit 
of knowledge and its free circulation – are 
redolent of their time. The world had just 
come through a terrible and protracted 
war… The impulse […] that people 
should understand each other better 
through improved education and all 
forms of cultural and scientific exchanges, 
the passionate emphasis on truth, 
justice, peace and the importance of the 
individual – these impulses were almost 
irresistible”. (Hoggart, R. 1978, An Idea and 
Its Servants: UNESCO from Within. London, 
Chatto and Windus, pp.27-29.) And 
UNESCO aimed very high to achieve these. 
UNESCO had a bulletin for official 
announcements and reports from its 
inception, but in 1948 it was decided 
to create the UNESCO Courier, a popular 
monthly journal to keep the public 
informed about UNESCO’s ideals 
and activities.

70th Anniversary Special 70
In January 1954, the Courier makes a new start
Excerpts from the Editorial 
At the beginning of this new year, the UNESCO Courier has wanted to do more than 
just offer its readers the traditional season’s greetings. It has sought to “make a new 
start”. In response to the desire expressed by readers it is abandoning its tabloid 
newspaper size for a new magazine format easier to read, handle and keep. It has 
increased the number of pages, designed a new cover in colour and prepared a 
brighter yet sober presentation(…). In its contents the Courier will continue to remain 
faithful to its set goal: to serve as a window opening on the world of education, 
science and culture through which the schoolteacher in particular for whom this 
publication is primarily conceived and prepared and other readers in general can 
look out on to wide global horizons. Each month it will present by text and image, 
features which are both informative and thought-provoking, and will devote a 
section to an authoritative treatment of an important world problem and show how 
it is being dealt with nationally and internationally. The Courier particularly invites 
comments, criticisms and suggestions from its readers. To the teacher who demands 
something more than run-of-the-mill fare, to those who are interested in people and 
problems of other nations, in the dramatic but little known story of ordinary men and 
women working together to raise standards of living, combat ignorance and disease, 
reduce racial prejudice and foster international understanding, to all those who are 
alert to today’s events and problems in education, in the arts and the sciences, the 
Courier says: This is a periodical specially prepared for you.

Whenever an Italian city was liberated, 
Koffler would set up a newspaper called 
the Corriere there. It came as no surprise, 
then, that when he joined UNESCO 
after the war, he set up, inevitably, the 
UNESCO Courier. His was an astonishing 
creative drive mixed with a passion for 
publishing. Moreover, it was publishing 
with a clear moral vision attached.
The magazine was intended for an 
“enlightened” public, in particular 
teachers and students, and it did indeed 
get its greatest readership through 
schools, colleges, and universities.
Koffler set out its principal themes 
as: the impact of science on human 
life, racial problems, art and culture, 
human rights, history and archaeology, 
cultural differences and conflicts 
between peoples. 
The sheer breadth of the subjects 
covered is breathtaking. In the same 
issue, you can discover the threats 
faced by the temple of Borobudur in 
Indonesia, by the Sri Ranganathaswamy 
temple in Srirangam, India, and the 
Parthenon in Greece. In the pages of the 
Courier, you will marvel at the work of 
the fifteenth-century Florentine painter 
Masaccio, and then, the work of the 
Aborigines of Australia. There is an issue 
to celebrate Einstein’s 70th birthday, 
another dedicated to Chekhov, and yet 
another, to Rabindranath Tagore. 
There are also numerous articles on 
ecology and conservation, especially on 
oceanography and marine biology – the 
Courier was green avant la lettre, or way 
before its time. 
The articles were notably well-written 
and beautifully presented. In 1954, 
the magazine’s format was changed to 
include colour illustration – setting new 
standards at the time. 
The range of contributors reads like a 
check-list of twentieth-century culture. 
The tradition of excellence established 
by Sandy Koffler has continued over 
the years. The Courier’s writers include 
Jorge Amado, Isaac Asimov, Jorge Luis 
Borges, Anthony Burgess,Aimé Cesaire, 
Arthur C. Clarke – to skim just a few 
names off the top of the alphabet. The 
magazine also covered major United 
Nations and UNESCO events. When the 
Universal Declaration of Human Rights 
was proclaimed, for example, a Courier 
edition was devoted to it.

70th Anniversary Special 70
Racism at the top of 
the agenda
Action against racism was at the top of 
the UNESCO agenda from the outset. An 
explicit campaign against South Africa’s 
apartheid regime led to the criticism 
that focusing on one country in this way 
sidelined other human rights issues. 
The point was well-made. Anyone who 
looks at the list of nations that officially 
signed up to the Universal Declaration 
and inquires about political repression 
and censorship, the ill-treatment of 
minorities, the consistent discrimination 
against women, etc., in some of these 
countries, would be forgiven a response 
of enormous cynicism. 
Besides, the campaign against apartheid 
was going on in a world where the British 
and French empires were still going 
full tilt, where the Jim Crow laws – that 
enforced racial segregation – were still a 
way of life in the southern United States, 
and where caste divisions in India were 
still thriving.
The first article in the Courier that 
directly addressed the question of race 
was in November 1949: “The question 
of race and the democratic world” by 
Arthur Ramos. A Brazilian psychologist 
and anthropologist who was head of 
UNESCO’s Department of Social Sciences, 
Ramos had been fighting racism all 
his life, and been imprisoned twice by 
the Brazilian security police during the 
dictatorship of Getúlio Vargas. 
The article made the case that: “In any 
discussion on the reorganization of the 
post-war world, particular account must 
be taken of anthropology. No other 
science has been so deflected from its 
true ends. In its name, whole nations 
have resorted to conflict, to defend the 
false ideal of racial or ethnic supremacy. 
It is, therefore, entirely natural that 
anthropology, restored to its proper place 
and stripped of the myths in which it 
had been veiled, should now deliver its 
scientific message to the world.” 
Then, when UNESCO released its 
“Statement on Race” in 1950, the July-
August Courier of that year carried 
the headline: “Fallacies of Racism 
Exposed”. The statement was published 
in full, with the conclusions on the 
front page. It was accompanied by an 
article, “Race and Civilization”, by the 
Swiss-born Argentinian anthropologist 
Alfred Métraux.
Métraux, who joined UNESCO in 
1947, and was head of the Division for 
the Study of Race Problems in 1950, 
played a central role in UNESCO’s anti-
racism initiatives. He was the principal 
coordinator behind the early statements 
– the first in 1950, and its revision in 1951. 
He was a close friend of Koffler, and an 
enthusiastic supporter of the Courier. 
With more than twenty articles to his 
name, Métraux was one of the magazine’s 
top contributors, till his death in 1963. 
Challenging long-held 
beliefs
As seen today, there were some 
obvious naïvetés in the arguments in 
the statements on race. Firstly, there 
was the enormous confidence in the 
power of “science” – that anthropology is 
“scientific”, and would therefore establish 
conclusions with unassailable certainty. 
Secondly, some of the examples are 
clearly debatable – the same July-August 
1950 issue carried an illustration, on 
page 8, accompanying the statement, 
shows a group of New Zealand Maori 
above the caption “Racial Harmony”. 
Did anyone ask the Maori their opinion 
on that?
Referring to the US, Ramos wrote in the 
November 1949 issue : “... after many years 
of vain effort, the policy of protecting 
the Indians seems to have become 
more humane and scientific. Here it is 
a question not only of protecting the 
Indians’ “reserves”, but of respecting 
the characteristics of their civilization, 
material or otherwise; ...”. Few Native 
Americans today would be happy with 
the words “humane”, “scientific”, and 
“respecting” as descriptions of the way 
they are treated. In the same issue, Ramos 
praised the work of Brazil’s Serviço de 
Proteção dos Índios (Indian Protection 
Service), writing that “the results have 
been highly encouraging”.

The UNESCO Courier • January-March 2018   |   61 
70th Anniversary Special 70
The Cintas Largas, the Yanomami, and 
many other indigenous groups in the 
Amazon were to be engulfed in atrocities, 
and continue to suffer discrimination to 
this day.
The Courier edition of August-September 
1952 featured a report on race relations in 
Brazil. It heralded a major UNESCO study 
on race in that country. All the writers 
argued on the basis of a belief that was 
common then – that Brazil represented 
a picture of racial harmony – with one 
exception. Luiz de Aguiar Costa Pinto, 
one of the authors of UNESCO’s 1950 
statement on Race, wrote in this issue of 
the Courier: “…the harmonious integration 
which is regarded as characteristic of 
interracial relationships in Brazil fails 
to correspond to facts revealed by 
sociological investigations. It has been 
said so often and for so long that racial 
prejudices do not exist in Brazil, that 
this affirmation which has been passed 
around the world has finally become a 
source of Brazilian national pride. Yet, 
behind this piece of dogma lie feelings of 
bitterness and an obvious uneasiness.”
Because the discussions in the Courier 
have always been robust and dynamic, the 
inevitable complacencies and received 
ideas get shaken up and challenged.
The greatest achievement of UNESCO’s 
four statements on the race question 
is the progressive move away from the 
“scientific” or “biological” definition of race. 
They dismantled any scientific justification 
or basis for racism, and proclaimed that 
race was not a biological fact of nature, 
but a dangerous social myth.
Decades later, on the question of race, 
no one can look at our world with 
much comfort. But listen to the hope 
and the intrinsic goodness in Métraux’s 
words in “Race and Civilization” (Courier, 
July-August 1950): “There is in this 
concept of race something implacable. 
The barbarity of our time is more ruthless 
and more absurd than that of the so-
called Dark Ages; for racial prejudice is 
an unintelligent and unattractive myth. 
Its flourishing development in the 
twentieth century will no doubt in future 
ages be regarded as one of the most 
shameful episodes in history.”
The Courier articles on race show a 
brave, uncompromising campaigning 
initiative. With a few adjustments, these 
statements are as appropriate today 
as they were then. The integrity of 
the arguments are part of the general 
strengths of the publication, not in the 
least constrained by narrow academic 
disciplines and protective professional 
postures. The inspiring, educative, 
cultural vision offered by the Courier is 
part of a vigorous moral vision of what 
human society can be.
Alan Tormaid Campbell (United 
Kingdom) taught Social Anthropology at 
the University of Edinburgh in Scotland 
for many years. Since 1974, he has been 
involved with the Wayapí, an indigenous 
people who live in the Amazon forest 
of Northern Brazil. His best-known book 
on the Wayapí is Getting to Know Waiwai 
(1995).

The Global Report assesses the 
impact of the most recent policies 
and measures taken around the 
world to implement the UNESCO 
2005 Convention on the Protection 
and Promotion of the Diversity of 
Cultural Expressions, now ratified 
by 145 Member States and the 
European Union.
Specifically, it tracks progress on 
the four main goals related to the 
Convention: support sustainable 
systems of governance for culture; 
achieve a balanced flow of cultural 
goods and services and increase 
mobility of artists and cultural 
professionals; integrate culture in 
sustainable development frameworks; 
promote human rights and 
fundamental freedoms.
When you read about journalists 
around the world who are attacked, 
beaten, harassed, imprisoned, and 
even murdered, there is a tendency 
to despair. More than 800 journalists 
have been killed worldwide in the past 
decade. And very few of the killers are 
ever brought to justice. 
It is in this environment that a range of 
media companies, individual journalists, 
media associations and NGOs are 
responding with proactive, successful 
initiatives to better protect journalists 
and combat impunity. The actions 
vary from small grassroots responses 
to massive global cooperative efforts. 
This report is a collection of some of 
these stories.
Across the world, journalism is under 
fire. While more individuals have access 
to content than ever before, the 
combination of political polarization 
and technological change has 
facilitated the rapid spread of hate 
speech, misogyny and unverified ‘fake 
news’, often leading to disproportionate 
restrictions on the freedom of 
expression. In an ever-growing number 
of countries, journalists face physical 
and verbal attacks that threaten their 
ability to report news and information 
to the public. 
In the face of such challenges, this new 
volume in the World Trends in Freedom 
of Expression and Media Development 
series offers a critical analysis of new 
trends in media freedom, pluralism, 
independence and the safety 
of journalists.
