The New Peasants’ Revolt
Industrial agriculture is built upon single crops,
intensive use of fertilizers and concentrated land
ownership. Across the world, farmers are
rebelling against the forces that are chasing them
from their land, destroying the environment and
poisoning our food. From the landless workers’
movement in Brazil to organic farmers in
Bangladesh and livestock breeders in France,
their initiatives go well beyond agricultural
techniques. By promoting family-based farming,
they are defending a whole new set of
environmental and social relations.Working the fields in Thailand.

Tar has turned Ndioum into a crossroads of commerce.
Tradespeople from Mauritania and former military staff and civil
servants have built all the shops, lined up next to each other like
a row of boxes, jam-packed with all kinds of goods.The entrances
are encumbered by wheelbarrows and the small stalls of vendors
selling fritters who rush up to travellers when they stop their cars.
I walked across the village looking for my neighbourhood.
Everyone has brought their own style to this land.The regional

wide colour strips of emigrants belonging to France, the cushy,
gated villas of executives from Dakar that are as uncomfortable
as they are ill-suited to the climate; the large mosque on the hill;
the small farmers’ bank and its grain storehouse; the two service
stations at the beginning and end of the avenue. The space
between the avenue and the houses shrinks; the windows looking
out onto the road are still shuttered when the shops begin to

with parents picking up money orders sent by their children who
have emigrated abroad.
Where are the buildings made of stuccoed earth with their
d a r k , cool inner verandahs that protected the occupants from the
windblown ochre dust? Where are the large concessions
surrounded by medium-high stockade fences through which
you could catch glimpses of life’s dramas—the letter announcing
a daughter’s engagement to an expatriate; the neighbour who
brought back a disease from central Africa that is taking a
terrible toll? But the tiny El Hadj Oumar Tal mosque is still
s t a n d i n g, with its roof tiles from Marseilles, its palm trees and
around it, the lush gardens of the former chief of police, w h i c h
look like an oasis in this huge plain turned upside-down by
construction work.
Ndioum and the myth that followed the taming of the river
captured the imaginations of only those who came from far
away to answer the call of its endless spaces, criss-crossed by a
grid of irrigation canals.The villagers received their plots, lost in

DEVELOPING THE SENEGAL RIVER
The three countries past which the Senegal River
flows—Mali, Mauritania and Senegal—began work to
open the river up for trade at the start of the 1970s,
leading to the inauguration of dams at Diama and
Manantali in 1985 and 1987 respectively. Primary
goals of the development project were to regulate
the river flow to improve its accessibility to river
traffic,supply urban centres with clean drinking
water, stop saltwater reaching beyond the mouth of
the river, and above all protect the region from its
fickle climate by ensuring regular irrigation. The total
irrigated area is due to reach 375,000 hectares,
190,000 of which will be in Senegal. Some 30,000
hectares in that country are already being irrigated.
The scheme’s main funding bodies, including the
European Union and various national development
agencies, have so far lent over $500 million, while 60
percent of Senegal’s agricultural investment is
thought to have been devoted to implementing the
plan.Crop yields, however, remain low, at four tonnes
per hectare of paddy field twice a year. The soil is
getting saline. A lack of interest from the state, neo-
liberal policies,the devaluation of the African franc,
rising prices for materials, water bills and a string of
poor yields have only served to make peasant

The story beggars belief. In the 1970s,
international agencies headed by the
United Nations Children’s Fund
(UNICEF) began pumping millions of
dollars of aid money into Bangladesh for
tubewells to provide “ c l e a n ” d r i n k i n g
w a t e r. According to the World Health
Organization,the direct result has been
the biggest outbreak of mass poisoning in
h i s t o r y.Up to half the country’s tubewells,
now estimated to number 10 million, a r e
p o i s o n e d . Te n s, perhaps hundreds of
thousands will die.
Why? Because nobody tested for the
likely take 30 years to find all the
poisoned tubewells—longer than it took
to sink them all. So why are the
authorities and international experts
proving incapable of coming up with a
solution? 
The roots of the problem go back to
the early 1970s when most Bangladeshis
living in the countryside relied on surface
ponds and rivers for their drinking water.
Sewage bacteria, h o w e v e r, unleashed a
battery of water-borne disease which killed
a quarter of a million children each year,
according to the World Bank.So UNICEF
sought to solve the problem by instigating
a massive tubewell project to tap into
underground water sources, d e s p i t e
warnings by some local people that they
were pumping the “ d e v i l ’s water.”
UNICEF explains today that “at the

Thirty years ago, Bangladeshi villages began pumping arsenic-laced water 
natural poison, arsenic, widely found in
underground water. And when a doctor
did find traces of the metal, and when
Bangladeshi villagers did start turning
up at doctors’ surgeries with the tumours
and telltale signs of arsenic poisoning,
the results were swiftly buried so that
nobody made the connection.
Even now as the scale of the calamity
e m e r g e s, nobody is admitting culpability.
Not UNICEF, which initiated the
tubewells programme and paid for the
first 900,000 wells, nor the World Bank, a
fellow sponsor. Not the Bangladeshi
g o v e r n m e n t ,or the foreign engineers and
public health scientists who did not think
to test the water for so long.

godmother to the catastrophe are now

t i m e, standard procedures for testing the
safety of groundwater did not include
tests for arsenic [which] had never before
been found in the kind of geological
formations that exist in Bangladesh.” B u t
many geochemists,such as John McArthur
at University College London, scoff at
such a suggestion. They blame dogma
among public health people with no
knowledge of geology, and who equated
underground water with safe water.
Who knew what and when? Th e
Bangladeshi government claims that cases
of arsenic contamination came to its
attention in 1993 and concluded two years
later that the poisoning was widespread,
with tubewell water the likely cause. B u t
according to Quazi Quamruzzaman of the
Dhaka Community Hospital, t h e
government was told as early as 1985 that
Bangladeshis crossing the border into We s t
Bengal were being diagnosed with arsenic
p o i s o n i n g. Arsenic is a slow killer. Th e
most obvious signs are the blisters found
on the palms of the hands and soles of the
f e e t ,which can eventually turn gangrenous
and cancerous.M e a n w h i l e,the poison also
attacks internal organs, notably the lungs
and kidneys,which can result in a battery
of illnesses including cancers.Despite the
mounting evidence of contamination,
there were no investigations.
The World Bank also maintains that
“before 1993, groundwater was never
tested for arsenic,” according to Babar
K a b i r, hydrogeologist and head of the
o r g a n i z a t i o n ’s water department. B u t
Peter Ravenscroft,an engineer based in
Dhaka for the British engineering
consultancy firm Mott MacDonald,who
worked extensively for international aid
agencies on the tubewell programme,
says he first found arsenic in
groundwaters in the late 1980s and
published his findings in 1990.
Yet it wasn’t until 1998 that the
international community finally appeared
to accept some responsibility for solving
the mass poisoning of Bangladesh. The
World Bank announced an emergency
three-year programme to identify the
killer tubewells using simple tests and to
“put in motion concrete actions [to]
combat a major health crisis with
devastating effects on the lives of
millions.” With almost every one of the
c o u n t r y ’s 68,000 villages potentially at
r i s k , the Bank said it would initially survey
4,000 villages and draw up action plans for
each. This “fast-track project” was to be
the first phase in a 15-year programme to
screen the country’s tubewells.
But the “ f a s t - t r a c k ” programme took
another year to negotiate between the
international agencies and the
Bangladeshi government, pushing its
completion date to late 2002. A n d
inquiries by the UNESCO Courier have
revealed that the programme remains
mired.Richard Wilson,a leading analyst
of the crisis from Harvard University’s
department of public health, says “ t h e
project is stalled.” He blames the
Bangladeshi government’s failure to
“decide how to spend the money” a n d
says that leading officers at the Bank are
privately “most upset about it.”
The Bank denies this publicly.K h a w a j a
M i n n a t u l l a h , a water specialist at the Wo r l d
B a n k ’s Dhaka offic e,s a y s :“It is not stalled.
There is now steady progress after an
initial slow pace.” But so far, he says, o n l y
800 villages have been screened,little more
than one percent of the country’s villages.
And few if any action plans have been
completed because, says Minnatullah,
scientists have failed to find a “ p r o v e n ,
a f f o r d a b l e ” method of removing arsenic
from village pumps.
While little changes in the lives of
most villagers, local scientist and activist
Dipankar Chakraborti (see box) is
shocked to find a flood of foreign
consultants gearing up for a junket on an
even bigger scale than the original
tubewell programme. “I cannot accept
that 50 percent of the fund will go to
foreign consultants. Bangladesh has
become an experimental station of
Western countries.”
Not that indigenous action has had a
flying start.The Bangladeshi government
created a steering committee which in
turn set up an expert committee in
September 2000 “to detect the causes of
arsenic contamination across the
country”—a matter that most experts
believed to have been long since resolved.
While the official programme has
s t u t t e r e d , many non-governmental
organizations—and none more so than
Chakraborti and his colleagues at the
Dhaka Community Hospital—have been
filling the gap. But the task is far too big
for any NGO. Shahida A z f a r, U N I C E F ’s
representative in Dhaka, told a
conference in the city last May that “to
date, only 250,000 tubewells have been
t e s t e d . If we keep this up it will take us 30
years to complete the testing.”
And now it appears that even this
baleful calculation may be optimistic.
According to Minnatullah, screening of
the first 800 villages revealed 70 percent
more pumps than estimated beforehand.
“Current observations indicate that there
are about 10 million handpumps,” he told
the UNESCO Courier—more than twice
P L A N E T ◗
“Bangladesh 
has become 
an experimental 
station of 
Western 
countries.”
Sounding the alarm 
Dipankar Chakraborti is the man who brought the arsenic crisis to international attention—
first in his native West Bengal and then later in Bangladesh.
Now the director of environmental studies at Jadavpur University in Calcutta,Chakraborti first
began investigations as a young researcher in 1988. After hearing about unusual health
problems among villagers during a visit to his parents’ West Bengali village, he sent water
samples for testing at the University of Antwerp, Belgium, which reported high levels of
arsenic.
By 1992,Chakraborti realized that the crisis in West Bengal was merely the prelude to a much
bigger calamity over the border in Bangladesh. In one West Bengali village, he found a lone
woman suffering from arsenic symptoms, while her family and neighbours were not.She said
she had come from Bangladesh after marrying,and that other people back home had similar
symptoms doctors assumed were linked to leprosy.
For five years now, Chakraborti has collaborated with doctors from the Dhaka Community
H o s p i t a l , which specializes in providing cheap health care for the poor. To g e t h e r, they have been
surveying the scale of the Bangladeshi problem, treating the poisoned and exposing the
epidemic to the wider world. In April 2000, he published the results of 240 days in the fie l d .
During that time, the team analyzed water samples from 22,000 tubewells in 54 of the country’s
64 districts, as well as 11,000 hair, nail and urine samples. They found 900 villages with arsenic
levels above the government limit. For Chakraborti, this is “only the tip of the iceberg.” ■

as many as assumed when the programme
was set up.
Indeed the WHO released a report in
September estimating that between 35
and 77 million Bangladeshis may be
drinking water containing more than the
safety limit of 10 parts per billion of
a r s e n i c.According to the report’s author,
Allan Smith of the University of
C a l i f o r n i a , B e r k e l e y, the scale of the
disaster is “beyond Bhopal; b e y o n d
Chernobyl.”
There is no way yet of predicting which
of the country’s tubewells is safe and which
carries a promise of disease and death.A
study by David Kinniburgh of the British
Geological Survey,published in June 2000,
found that neighbouring villages,and often
even neighbouring households, d r i n k
water with vastly different levels of
p o i s o n i n g. There is no alternative, h e
c o n c l u d e d , but to test almost every
tubewell in the country (see box).
It seems likely that water from about
half of all the country’s tubewells, in more
than 40,000 villages, exceeds the W H O
l i m i t , many by several hundred times,
according to the health organization.Th e
figure may be rising.Chakraborti recently
reported disturbing new evidence from
Faridpur district where some wells tested in
1995 as safe are becoming contaminated.
The amount of arsenic in the water is
a few parts per million at most. But over
the years it accumulates. It can take a
decade or more of drinking poisoned
water before the physical symptoms
e m e r g e. O f ficial figures show some 8,500
people have been diagnosed with arsenic
p o i s o n i n g.But nobody doubts that there is
massive under-reporting in Bangladesh’s
largely rural and desperately poor
population of 128 million,for whom there

“ Twenty thousand people could die
12 The Unesco Courier - January 2001
Shanta is one of many villages in which women continue to draw poisoned water.
W h e re does the arsenic come fro m ?
The arsenic probably originates in the Himalayan headwaters of the Ganges and
Brahmaputra rivers, and has lain undisturbed beneath the surface of the region’s deltas for
thousands of years in thick layers of fine alluvial mud smeared across the area by the rivers.
According to David Kinniburgh of the British Geological Survey, who has recently completed
a detailed study of the arsenic’s route into millions of tubewells, the arsenic concentration in
the mud is not extraordinary. Time is the culprit. The mud in Bangladesh lies thicker, wider and
flatter than almost anywhere on Earth. It can take hundreds or thousands of years for
underground water to percolate through the mud before reaching the sea.All the while it is
absorbing arsenic.
Th i s, says Kinniburgh, helps explain the diverse pattern of arsenic concentrations in tubewell
wa t e r s. The contaminated wells almost all take water from a depth of 20 to 100 metres.
Shallower wells are clean because they contain mostly recent rainwater or water flo w i n g
swiftly through the sediments. Deeper wells tap water in older sediments which have by now
been flushed clean of arsenic. It will take thousands of years, says Kinniburgh, before the rest
of the arsenic will wash away into the Indian Ocean.
Many underground water sources around the world contain arsenic. Parts of Ta i wa n ,A r g e n t i n a ,
Chile and China have all suffered epidemics of skin diseases, gangrene and cancer as a result.
S m i t h ’s analysis of the Ta i wan epidemic in particular helped set the WHO arsenic standards for
water and is the basis for his current predictions. B a n g l a d e s h , he says, is quite unprecedented.

each year,” according to the UN
Development Programme. The possible
death toll is difficult to calculate because
some cancers typically take 20 years to
e m e r g e.Smith estimates that in many parts
of southern Bangladesh, one in ten adult
deaths could soon be from arsenic-
triggered cancers of internal organs, s u c h
as the bladder and lungs.People are made
more vulnerable by poor nutrition, t h e
large volumes of water they drink
(typically five litres a day, s a y s
C h a k r a b o r t i ) ,and because they may ingest
more arsenic through eating rice irrigated
by poisoned water and then boiled in it.
“So far as we know there is no
medicine available for chronic arsenic
toxicity,” says Quamruzzaman of Dhaka
Community Hospital.The only treatment
is safe water, nutritious food and time.
This can clear up the skin blotches on
people in the early stages of poisoning.
But once gangrene and cancer have taken
hold they may be beyond hope.
Where is the situation worst?
Chakraborti says “one of the worst villages
I have ever visited” is Stadium Para in
Meherpur district, right on the border with
I n d i a . Here nine residents have already
died of cancerous ulcers caused by arsenic.
One was only 25 years old. B u t , after fiv e
years of surveying, he nominates the
southeastern village of Seladi as “in all
probability the most arsenic-contaminated
village in the world.” Here 72 out of 73
tubewells are contaminated. No fewer
than 21 contain arsenic at more than 1,000
parts per billion, and the highest at 4,000
p p b,or four hundred times the WHO limit.
In some villages almost everyone is
a f f e c t e d . In other villages,only a minority
are poisoned.But they may suffer worst of
a l l . “Nobody wants to come in contact
with them,” says Jinat Nahar Jitu of Dhaka
Community Hospital. “ They are barred
from coming out of their homes or even
from using water from clean wells.”Wi v e s
are divorced and children turned away
from schools, primarily out of an
unfounded fear that they may infect others.
That is what happened to Pinjra
B e g a m , a pretty 15-year- o l d , shortly after
her marriage in 1988 to Masud Rana, a
m i l l - w o r k e r.Her skin became mottled and
b l o t c h y, the tell tale signs of arsenicosis.
The blotches turned to ugly sores that
became gangrenous.Her husband left her
for another.Cancer took hold and spread
to her lungs. She finally died in her home
village of Miapur Paschim Para, near the
banks of the River Ganges, in May last
y e a r, aged just 26. She left three children,
aged seven, five and one. Soon Pinjra’s

What nex t ?
In the first step of the mammoth task of testing the country’s tubewells, v o l u n t e e r s, aid worke r s
and officials paint the dangerous ones red, which should only be used for wa s h i n g . Th e
villagers are supposed to use the safe wells exclusively for drinking, but that’s not easy when
the lucky one is found in someone else’s backyard.
In the longer run, part of the answer lies in sinking deeper wells to tap cleaner wa t e r. But it will
t a ke millions of dollars to install these wells in addition to the needed surface tanks and
distribution pipes. Also some deep tubewells in West Bengal have started bringing up arsenic
months or years after they were opened.
Another idea is to adopt traditional methods such as ponds and tanks to “harvest”rainwater.
This will work in some places, says Shahida Azfar from UNICEF, but “there is not enough rain
all year for that to be feasible as the main strategy.”
Could the tubewell waters be treated? While a large number of ideas for filters and chemical
treatments have been tried out in the past two years, there is “no proven affordable arsenic
r e m o val technology available yet,” according to Khawaja Minnatullah of the World Bank.
Most experts warn against blanket solutions. Each village needs its own plan.And none of them
can begin planning until it knows which of its tubewells are pouring poison into villagers’ bucke t s.

children will also likely develop the same
symptoms as the arsenic levels accumulate
in their bodies.
There are some technical solutions to
providing safe drinking water for the
people of Bangladesh—albeit hard to
execute in such a poor, ill-educated and
rural countryside (see box). But first the
millions of dangerous tubewells have to
be identifie d . The slow progress of the
World Bank programme so far could prove
a mortal blow. In his September report,
Smith warned that “the worst thing that can
possibly be done is nothing.”But for most
Bangladeshis caught up in this disaster,
nothing is exactly what is being done. ■

Enrolling a child at the local public school is
a painless exercise for most European
parents—unless of course, their child
happens to be “ d i f f e r e n t .” In that case,
where they live is still likely to determine
whether the child is welcomed into a
regular classroom or guided towards a
special school.
“Having a child with Down’s
s y n d r o m e, I realized that the school was
not against the principle but was
apprehensive because it lacked the means
to welcome her,” recalls Sophie Cluzel, a
mother of four living in a Paris suburb.
What ensued was a battle, via an
a s s o c i a t i o n , with the Education Ministry
to win the right to a special assistant, 8 0
percent financed by the state and reserved
for the 18-to-26 age bracket as part of a
pro-youth employment policy. H a v i n g
been granted her request, Cluzel went
BY CYNTHIA GUTTMAN

knocking on company doors to come up
with the remaining 20 percent. N o w, a s
part of a collective of parents representing
both physically and mentally handicapped
c h i l d r e n , funds for 20 more such assistants
have been granted. “If it weren’t for the
drive by families, you wouldn’t get
a n y w h e r e. Even if school is compulsory,
too much rests on the goodwill of teachers
or inspectors.”
A shift from a medical model 
to an inclusive approach
Since a government-commissioned
report lamented Fr a n c e ’s slow progress
on the integration front, a set of widely
applauded measures have been introduced
to speed up the process,notably by getting
different groups—parents, education and
social workers—talking with each other.
They are not alone in this quest:along with
Fi n l a n d ,Greece and the Netherlands,m o r e
than half of the country’s disabled students
are in special schools.At the other end of
the spectrum, I t a l y, a country deeply
i n fluenced by the anti-psychiatry
movement of the late 1960s, presents the
most extreme example of an all-out
integration policy, with less than two
percent of handicapped children in special
s c h o o l s, followed by Spain and Po r t u g a l ,
with roughly 18 percent. But does this
necessarily mean that integration is the
only politically acceptable route?
First of all, it is not always an either- o r
s c e n a r i o, since many countries have
“multi-track systems” offering a wider
choice, notably special classes in regular
schools with certain shared hours. B u t
considerable efforts over the past 10 to 15
years to make schools more inclusive—
open to all children—has changed the
way of looking at handicaps.“There has
been a shift from a medical model
towards a more pedagogical approach,
starting from the principle that children
have different capacities and needs,” s a y s
Victoriana Soriano from the European
A g e n cy for Development in Special
Needs Education, which has conducted
in-depth studies on the issue.
In the current climate, c o u n t r i e s

January 2001 - The Unesco Courier 15
would be hard put to take an anti-
inclusion line.What prevails is a system of
“guided choice.” The UN community,
notably via UN E S C O, has been
instrumental in advocating inclusion.Th e
European Commission makes integration
a guiding principle of its education
programmes. “From there on,it is up to
member states to apply these principles
according to their systems,” says the
C o m m i s s i o n ’s Georgia Henningsen.“A l l
our activities aim to stimulate action and
raise awareness,” she says, referring to
p r o j e c t s, networks and research
conducted on furthering integration.“ Th e
advantage of an integrated approach,”
she says,“is that when you make a special
effort for those with special needs on the
teaching front, everyone profit s,b e c a u s e
there are always students at the back of
the class.”
But for everyone to profit , that extra
little effort has to be made.“Inclusion can
work perfectly well under certain
c i r c u m s t a n c e s, but those are not
commonly met,” says the OE C D’s Peter
E v a n s, a special education expert. Fo r
o n e, “teacher training is not a very
inclusive exercise.” In some countries,
student teachers spend no more than
twelve hours of their whole training on
disabled students, in others half a year,
while in yet others it is part of the weekly
s c h e d u l e.The result is a fear of losing face
before the unknown.“ Teachers don’t have
the tools and they’re aware of it,” s a y s
S o r i a n o. Not surprisingly, teacher unions
tend to be in favour of maintaining the
status quo, and represent a “ s u b s t a n t i a l
f o r c e,”according to Evans,when it comes
to making decisions on integration.E v e n
when they do fully endorse the integration
p r i n c i p l e, many teachers and school
principals complain about the
disproportionate work load involved
through extra report writing, m e e t i n g s
with expert committees, e t c.
Transforming special schools
into resource centres
The other camp that governments
have to contend with are the special
education structures themselves.The task
underway—as in Norway, Denmark and
the Netherlands—is to transform them
into “resource centres” for mainstream
s c h o o l s, tapping the expertise of their
teachers and staff without cutting jobs.
Then there is the question of how teachers
skilled at working with disabled children
are treated. In Fr a n c e, for example, t h e r e
is a dearth of candidates applying to
become specialized teachers. In a Parisian
primary school with two classes for
children with Down’s syndrome, n o
specialized teachers applied for the post
when it was advertised.A regular teacher
was hired,who is learning on the job while
waiting for an answer to an application for
further training. According to the school
p r i n c i p a l , “specialized teachers have had
enough of not being recognized.”
For Cor Meijer, a researcher with the
European A g e n cy, financial mechanisms
largely explain the continued discrepancy
between policy and practice. Take the
N e t h e r l a n d s : an integration policy was set
up in the 1960s and 70s but no incentive
was given to encourage the shift.“In fact,
the structure rewards segregation,in spite
of what the government proclaims,” s a y s
M e i j e r,who is Dutch.This is set to change.
Parliament just approved a bill to allocate
funds to regions based on their total
number of children, rather than
distinguishing between those with special
needs and those without, a system that
tends to favour vested interests.
Staging cultural events to
change our perceptions
N u m b e r s, h o w e v e r, tend to say little
about quality, about which there is scant
i n f o r m a t i o n .Some parents strongly believe
that it’s better in special schools,notably in
countries operating a fairly large system.
A recent study in England found that
bullying was “the main factor” d r i v i n g
disabled children out of regular schools.
“ I t ’s not because children are integrated
that the problem is solved,” says Soriano.
“I’m all for the most comprehensive
legislation possible, but we won’t be able
to speak about equal opportunity until
we give top priority to more in-depth work
on pedagogy.”The problem is particularly
acute at the secondary level.“ S p e c i a l i z e d
schools are in a delicate situation, t h e y
see teenagers arriving who cannot go any
further in the mainstream,”says Catherine
C o u s e r g u e,a French doctor specialized in
integration matters.“So they think that at
the end of the day regular schools are a
failure and that kids would have been
better off there from the outset.”
Meijer foresees another paradox on
the horizon: schools are increasingly held
accountable for quality—namely turning
out good crops of students—while being
asked to cater for lower-achieving groups.
A r e n ’t the most vulnerable children likely
to be pushed out? 
Beyond this is the issue of mentality.
For Francis Degryse, the parent of a
handicapped seven-year old daughter,
the key is to “change our perception of
the disabled.” He notched up an
improbable success by getting a blind
director to stage a show featuring only
disabled actors to a full house in a
prestigious Paris venue. Such cultural
events have now become a yearly affair,
and aim to become European. Through
his association “ Without Drums Nor
Tr u m p e t s,” he organizes puppet shows
in regular schools to “take some of the
d r a m a ” out of mental and physical
h a n d i c a p s, has produced a CD and is
looking for backers to set up a web T Vo n
the disabled.“You have to know how to
impose yourself and be tenacious. For we
can all live together.”
This is probably the most convincing
argument for inclusion. “Parents in
general are very supportive, they believe
it is a good lesson in tolerance for their
children,” says a French principal whose
school includes two special classes for
the handicapped.“ You can always give all
the civic education courses you want,”
says Cousergue “but when you have a
handicapped mate next to you in class
e v e r y d a y, i t ’s a different story. It influ e n c e s
you for adult life: the day you have a
handicapped colleague, y o u ’ll look at
things in an altogether different way.” ■

Quand on est cinéaste et qu’on a la
chance que l’un de ses films soit primé à un
f e s t i v a l ,on peut accompagner l’œuvre élue
à travers le monde. C’est une occasion
exceptionnelle de se faire connaître – une
nécessité pour nous qui appartenons à des
systèmes de production excentrés – mais
c’est aussi le moyen de se rendre compte
que l’on n’est pas seul dans sa solitude.
J’ai vécu cette expérience de cinéaste
pèlerin.A Berlin,Nantes, Rotterdam ou
S u n d a n c e,aux Etats-Unis, en rencontrant
mes alter ego de Ta i w a n , de Corée, d u
Japon ou d’Iran, j’ai vérifié qu’il existe
un vigoureux courant de rénovation du
c i n é m a .Avant tout, il vient d’Asie,mais il
coïncide aussi avec le réveil latino-
a m é r i c a i n . Tous ces films diffèrent.
Po u r t a n t , malgré l’absence de cohérence
esthétique ou thématique, t o u s
participent d’une même volonté de se
mesurer avec la réalité et tous ont été
tournés avec des moyens limités.
J’ai réalisé l’un de mes fil m s, R a p a d o,
avec l’argent que m’avait octroyé le
Festival de Rotterdam pour écrire un
s y n o p s i s. Une somme juste suffis a n t e, e n
E u r o p e,pour financer le premier jet d’un
scénario permet à un cinéaste indépendant
argentin de produire un long métrage.
Disposer de peu d’argent n’est pas une
fin en soi mais oblige à garder l’esprit
affûté et à trouver des solutions narratives
a d a p t é e s.Nous puisons dans le vivier des
écoles de cinéma pour recruter des artistes
et des techniciens débutants,en leur offrant
un accès à la profession. Au Ja p o n , l e s
indépendants font de même.
On dénombre aujourd’hui plus de 15
écoles de cinéma à Buenos A i r e s. C e t t e
prolifération traduit la vitalité du septième
a r t , le désir largement partagé de
s’exprimer par ce biais. A i l l e u r s, e n
O c c i d e n t , le cinéma a-t-il perdu de son
intérêt? Il compte encore de grands
c r é a t e u r s, mais comment un réalisateur
américain ou européen ne se sentirait-il
pas bridé par des schémas éculés et
étouffé par la surconsommation d’images,
liée à l’omniprésence de la télévision?
En Iran, il est encore possible d’avoir
un regard innocent, de filmer son sujet
comme s’il n’avait jamais encore été porté
à l’écran. Le cinéma iranien a la candeur
des «premières fois», il en tire sa force.A
Ta i w a n , les conditions sont tout autres,
mais là aussi, les cinéastes ont su retrouver
l’innocence en interrogeant le passé d’une
société qui doute d’elle-même,en cultivant
l’étonnement que suscite l’étrangeté
même de la vie. Le Japon est encore
d i f f é r e n t , ses jeunes réalisateurs héritent
d’une longue tradition, mais ils sont
confrontés à la multiplication des chaînes
de télévision, à l’omniprésence des jeux
v i d é o s. L’expansion sans précédent de
l’univers audiovisuel ne laisse aucune
place à l’innocence, elle force au
détournement des codes, à leur utilisation
m a l i c i e u s e, i n t e l l i g e n t e. Dans les fil m s
j a p o n a i s, comme dans ceux de Hong-
Ko n g, les metteurs en scène jouent avec
les clichés de la publicité,de la vidéo,ou du
film de genre et les utilisent pour raconter
d’autres histoires, susciter de nouvelles
é m o t i o n s.
L’éclosion de ces «nouvelles vagues»
est sans doute liée à la réduction – et dans
certains cas, à la suppression – des aides
d’Etat au cinéma.Hormis les Etats-Unis,o ù
l’industrie bénéficie d’un large marché
intérieur captif, la majorité des autres pays
soutenaient la production nationale.
Au j o u r d ’ h u i , les systèmes de subventions
arrivent à épuisement et là où ils
fonctionnent encore, l’argent va toujours
aux mêmes.Faisons un rêve:et si les Etats
favorisaient cette éclosion sauvage que
l’on constate sous diverses latitudes?

Where we live, in the mountainous
Fouta-Djalon region of northern Guinea
—known as West A f r i c a ’s “ w a t  r
tower”—the peasants have only very
small plots, just a few hundred squar
metres each.
During th  rainy season, they harvest
ric  and maize for th ir own
c o  s u mp t i o n , and omatoes,potat es and
onions to sell. In good tim s and bad,
they earn between $200 and $270 a year,
which they somehow make d  with.
Everythi g is far away.To get a simple
b lt for a m chine,w  sometimes have to go
ll the way to the capital,C o n a k r y.We do ’t
have legal tit e to our land, whic  m ans
that we can’t stand up to individuals or the
government when they want to claim it.
We don’t h ve enough labour. Th e
y ng are all leaving, especially the men,
and often for abroa .W  ’re very short f
money to modernize our farms.We hav
to pay about 30 percent interest if we
take out loans from government-
controlled credit agencies and private
banks.
Yet despite ll this, w e ’re managing to
produce crops that are comp titive on
the domestic mark t,not just compared
with other national products but also
foreig  ones, sinc  the market was totally
opened up a dec de ago.When we decid
on somethi g, we carry it thro gh to th
en d .We do what we say we’ll do.We don’t
lie to people.We show them results.Th a t’s
why we’re su cessful.
The F uta-Djalon Peas ts’
Federation, founded in 1992, today has
12,500 members, two-thirds of them
w o m e n , who share farm work equally
with men. It buys eeds and fertiliz r
ch ap y to sell to th members. It builds
b a r n s, roads and bridges and runs literacy
cou ses. Its 18 experts help the pea ants
t  i prove their f rming methods, b u t
there ren’t e ough people ike them.
The federation also g v s classes in basic
accou ting and how to sell products to
 e r c h a n t .Foreig  aid organizations and
NGOs help us in various ways, w h i c h
works out at ro ghly $40 per memb r
each year.
It took us time bec use we’re dealing
with long-term development. D o n o r s
often want quick results, but we know
that if w  go too fast, w e ’ll fall flat on our
f ace.The r sul is th re for all to see.O ur
potato yields are now 3,000 kilos per
h e c ta r e. From 1992 to 1998, we man g d
to get the government to block foreign
potato imports at harvest ime.We don’t
need that pr tection any more.
Agro-industry costs the country and
the consumer a lot of money. It h s al o
failed beca s peasants are not just part of
the economy, t h e y ’re also part of soc ety,
local culture and the environme t. So
developing countries have to take another
path—a “third way”—the path of family
f a r m i  g, bu an improved version of it.
Guinea is still not s lf-sufficient a d
imports rice from southeast A s i a . B u t
ca  we keep on appealing to foreign
countries to feed us when that’s our job?

The sail of the felucca gently subsides. Its
hull bumps quietly against the old jetty

waters of the Nile.
Embraced by the two arms of the river, Dahab

Iskandar’s house has a white cross besides the
d o o r.The bell-tower of the imposing village church
dwarfs the nearby minaret as if to remind the visitor
that most of the islanders are Copts. “ When my
father died,” says Iskandar,“my three brothers and
I divided up his land between us. I got just over
three feddans (1.3 hectares) and half the house.
The other half went to my elder brother.Since then,
I haven’t been able to expand.”
Iskandar lives with his wife and children in three
r o o m s. A spotless white-tiled floor recently laid
over the bare earth stands out in the spartanly
furnished house, as does the television that takes
pride of place in the living-room, just as in nearly
every peasant home of the Nile valley.
The daughter of the family married at 14 and
went off with her fellah husband to his home village
on “the mainland,” near the Pyramids.Three other
c h i l d r e n , all boys between 17 and 21,are unmarried
and still at home, perhaps for a long time to come.
Getting married is expensive. The groom has to
provide a house for his bride and Iskandar has no
savings to help out his sons. “ The little money I
have goes on fertilizer or weedkiller,” he says.
In front of his house, in fields that are precisely
marked out and irrigated by canals leading from
the Nile, Iskandar grows fodder for his sheep and 10
cows along with enough maize to make bread for the
family all year round. On another plot, he grows
tomatoes and cucumbers he takes each week to sell
in Old Cairo’s market,where he pays a small tax for
a stand. He returns to the island with cooking oil,
sugar and an average of a kilo of meat per month.
“On the island the air is cleaner
and there’s no noise to bother us”
Every morning, his wife milks the cows,
Egyptian- bred creatures with high-ridged backs
and big udders.She takes the surplus of about 20 or
30 litres to the opposite bank of the river to a tanker
t r u c k , bringing back about 10 Egyptian pounds
( $ 3 . 5 0 ) .These are the only links the Khalil family has
with the world of money. Iskandar has never been
into a bank and knows nothing about credit. He
figures that his earnings average 150 Egyptian
pounds per month ($55). But saving is out of the
question:once he’s paid for fertilizers, weedkillers
and everyday goods, he has the equivalent of $6
l e f t , which he keeps carefully in a wardrobe.This is
money for special purposes, like buying a pair of
sandals or a piece of cloth,and for paying the annual
land tax of approximately $14. No wonder
expanding is just about impossible: besides the tax,
a feddan of land (0.42 hectares) costs nearly $5,700.
The Khalil family, like all Nile valley farmers, are
mainly self-suffic i e n t , eating what they produce and
keeping chickens and geese,who mingle freely with
the cows amid the heaps of manure.
In his field of maize,where the plants come up to
his shoulder,Iskandar gazes at the nearby skyscrapers

He was right, 
the one who said 
that agriculture is
the mother and
nurse of all the
other arts.
Xenophon, 
Greek historian 
(430-355 B.C.)
of Cairo’s wealthy Maadi neighbourhood.“ C a i r o ’s
very beautiful,” he says.“I like watching well-dressed
people go by. But here on the island,the air is cleaner
and there’s no noise to bother us.”
“We have to use chemicals to get the
earth to produce as much as
possible”
Like the other 200 islanders, Iskandar has never
lived anywhere else. He married a Dahab girl who
was a cousin. Tall and strong with a radiant look
and grey hair tucked under a black headscarf, she and
their three sons help him in the fields all day.But the
land is too small to be divided up between the sons.
“ I ’d like them to spend their lives here, close to me,
but when they get married they’ll have to go and
work in the city. Fa r m i n g ’s too hard now and you
d o n ’t earn enough.” S t i l l , his family count their
b l e s s i n g s : no one has ever been seriously ill and
t h e y ’ve rarely had to go to a healthcare centre,
generally financed by charitable or religious
o r g a n i z a t i o n s.
Sometimes Iskandar dreams of another life. If he
had been born elsewhere, he too would have
probably moved to Cairo, where he says, “life is
easier and much less tiring.” He does not understand
how city-dwellers can envy his life and smiles at
the thought. Manual labour and the heat of the sun
have dried up his skin. On market days, when he
loads heavy boxes of vegetables onto his cart, he
feels his thin, gnarled arms are not as strong as they
w e r e. In the evening, on his way back from the
fie l d s, he stops to chat with the menfolk of the
v i l l a g e.“Copts or Muslims, w e ’re all fellahin and we
help each other,” he says.
This is the hour when the wind carries the sounds
of the big city.The bridge built across the river a year
ago to link the two parts of the city on its south side
rumbles with the sound of traffic.But Dahab sleeps.
Here the day begins and ends with the sun. If he feels
like staying awake for a while, Iskandar turns on the
T V. “I like knowing what’s happening in other
p l a c e s,” he says.But he has never heard of genetically
m o d i fied food or angry European farmers.“ Wh a t ’s
the problem?” he says.“ We have to use chemicals to
get the earth to produce as much as possible. I use
t h e m . If I didn’t , what would I live on?”
He and his wife know they won’t starve.The soil
of Dahab has always fed the family. Last year’s
harvest wasn’t bad. But Iskandar also knows his
dream of building a “comfortable concrete house,
like in the city” where the whole family can live
together will never come true. He adjusts his blue
g a l l a b e y a r o b e s, strokes his chin and looks towards
the capital again.“I’ll be a bit ashamed when my
sons leave the island,” he says.“They’ll be the first
in our family not to be farmers.” ■

A knife at the throat of
half a billion farmers
Free trade threatens to drive half the world’s farmers off the land,
even though they hold the key to feeding the world and protecting the
environment
In the 1950s, an African farmer produced ten
quintals of grain, says Marcel Mazoyer1,
professor at the national agronomical institute
in Paris. He kept eight to feed his family, a n d
had two left over to sell on the market at $29
per quintal (at current rates). He thus had $57 of
income to cover basic expenses.To d a y,with a quintal
fetching less than $14,he must sell four to obtain the
same amount and purchase vital necessities. He can
no longer feed his family, much less make a profit that
would enable him to invest in ways to increase
p r o d u c t i o n . His chances of living, or rather eking a
living off the earth dwindle with each passing day.
A farmer in the Punjab could “modernize”his
farm thanks to the Green Revolution (see box,
p. 2 2 ) . Fifteen years ago, he used $30 worth of
fertilizers to harvest a tonne of grain (see article,p p.
2 7 - 2 8 ) .To d a y, soil depletion and the harmful effects
of uncontrolled irrigation force him to spend $80 for
the same amount of produce.M e a n w h i l e, the market
price has dropped and self-sufficiency has become
impossible. He must sell his harvests to purchase a
good part of his food, s e e d s, fertilizer and pesticides.
The outcome is inevitable:this farmer will have to
sell his land to pay back his creditors.
These two case studies are not unusual among the
w o r l d ’s 1.3 billion farmers and agricultural workers2.
In the developed countries, including eastern Europe,
only 45 million farmers,or roughly seven percent of
the working population, are left. In the developing
w o r l d , they account for over half the working
p o p u l a t i o n ,men and women combined.On average,
each farmer cultivates one hectare and harvests one
tonne of produce.Almost none owns a tractor.Th r e e -
quarters do not even own an animal to pull a plough.
Over half of these southern farmers suffer from
chronic malnutrition: three-quarters of the 800 million
human beings who go hungry every day are
impoverished farmers.The little that they manage to
sell has lost half its worth during the past 30 years.

The 1994 Marrakesh accords setting up the WTO
include an Agreement on Agriculture.
During the negotiations, the world’s two great food
powers—the United States and Europe—argued in
favour of liberalization, as long as it protected their
farmers’ interests.The Cairns group—14 of the world’s
leading food exporters, including Canada, Australia,
New Zealand,Argentina and Brazil—took a hard line
in defense of free trade. Poor developing countries
barely made themselves heard.
The final agricultural agreement contains
three sections:
• Market access: tariffs on imported products must
gradually decrease by 36 percent. For each product, 5
percent of national consumption must be freely
imported.
• Export subsidies must also be lowered by 36 percent
(in value), but not export credits, which are used
extensively by the United States.
• Domestic price supports must be reduced:farm price
subsidies must drop by 20 percent.But member states
have the right to subsidize their farmers’ income,
which Europe does.
Five years later, the Organization for Economic Co-
operation and Development says that Europe and the
United States have increased their aid to farmers, but 20
percent of them receive 80 percent of the assistance.
According to the FAO, developing countries have barely
increased their exports, while imports are much higher
than before.
A new round of talks is scheduled in 2001. ■
“ With such low income, they can afford neither
t o o l s, nor selected seeds, nor fertilizers; they can
barely survive,” says Dr. M a z o y e r. And they must
confront a growing threat: the opening of borders,
which puts them in direct competition with the
northern hemisphere’s industrial agro-businesses,
whose productivity per farmer may be up to 1,000
times higher.
“Agro-business” is relatively recent: it did not
become widespread in developed countries until
after the Second World Wa r. Until then, f a m i l y
farming had predominated since the agrarian reform
that followed the dismantling of feudal properties.
Agro-business relies on increasingly advanced
technology based on mechanization, c h e m i s t r y
(fertilizers and herbicides), the selection of seeds and
ever-costlier investments.The results are mixed.
Footing the bill of a model
stretched to the limits 
On the one hand, productivity has skyrocketed
in the north.Grain yields per hectare are an average
of two-and-a-half times higher than they were 40
years ago; on the most efficient farms, a single
farmer working alone can cultivate 300 hectares.
These productivity gains have been higher than in
manufacturing and services.They have resulted in
continuously dropping produce prices, and therefore
in a steady decline in the amount of income that
consumers spend on food.
On the other hand,the limits of this model are
increasingly obvious. The outbreak of “mad cow”
disease provides some idea of the ravages that high-
yield,industrial farming can cause.Environmental
d a m a g e—polluted aquifers, soil depletion,
decreasing biodiversity—is on the rise.This form of
agriculture guzzles 70 percent of potable water
c o n s u m e d .And now it is suffering from a backlash,

because yields and profitability have hit a ceiling.
That explains why spreading genetically modified
organisms is a central issue for industrial agriculture
in search of a second wind.
This model’s expansion also comes with an
economic and social cost. The former is largely
m a s k e d . Through a process that economists call
“externalization,” society as a whole foots a good
part of the bill.
“ E x t e r n a l i z a t i o n ” w i l l
continue in the future,
because one day the bill for
environmental damage will
have to be paid. It is already
present in the form of taxes
which citizens pay to
subsidize farmers. Most of
this aid is allocated
depending on production
volumes and cultivated
surface areas, and benefit s
farms that are the best
suited to agro-industry;the
rest are gradually sidelined.
The major social cost results from the ongoing
concentration of land, w h i c h , according to Rolf
Künnemann of the NGO Fo o d first Information
and Action Network, bears all the hallmarks of a
“new feudalism.” In the United States,50,000 farms
vanish every year. Polish farmers’ organizations
say that their country’s membership in the European
Union will spell the end of two-thirds of the
country’s farms,“in the best of cases.”
In the north, the casualties benefit or have
benefited from social safety nets or training
programmes to learn skills for new jobs in other
industries, which is what approximately 50 million
former farmers in the developed world did during
the past half-century. But how will southern cities
absorb a massive influx of people leaving the
countryside when they already have 600 million
inhabitants who are either unemployed or scraping
by on odd jobs in the parallel economy?
Yet this model in crisis is the one spreading across
the planet, despite its clearly identified negative
e f f e c t s, especially in terms of environmental and
social repercussions (see box p.2 3 ) .Agro-industry has
a blatant interest in conquering new markets in the
s o u t h , because those in the north are saturated. B u t
this development comes with a price: 500 million
farmers in the south will be driven off the land because
they lack the means to be or become competitive.
The planetary spread of agro-business is based
on a binary postulate that has been repeated so
often it has acquired the force of truth: the only
possible alternative would be either the hopeless
“ a r c h a i s m ” and immobility that characterize
southern farming, or “ m o d e r n i z a t i o n ,”which would
purely and simply graft the north’s industrial
agricultural revolution onto the south. B u t ,
observing the effects of this type of modernization
in the developing world, I g n a cy Sachs and Ricardo
A b r o m o v a y3 explain that “the great landed estates
inherited from colonial rule are turning into
agricultural companies.Their economic efficiency,
assessed by macro-social standards, is questionable.”
They see a new paradigm emerging:“the production
of wealth goes hand-in-hand with the simultaneous
reproduction of poverty.”
Time to give a chance 
to family farming
Is there a third way? Ye s, replies a chorus of
agronomists and farmers: family farming which,
when given a chance, breaks production records
and enables farmers to earn a decent livelihood.
Giving family farms a chance means first of all
breaking with the urbanization policy that most
governments in the developing countries have
a d o p t e d .Because cities are more turbulent than the
c o u n t r y s i d e, governments are trying to feed them
at a lower cost. The liberalization under way is
exacerbating this situation, because world farm
prices are generally lower than local ones. Wh a t ’s
m o r e,exports of cash crops are becoming a priority
to balance trade, which is kept under close watch by
the IMF and the World Bank.H o w e v e r, for farmers
in poor countries to advance, “the fruit of their
labour must be remunerated at a price which allows
them to purchase additional means of production,”
22 January 2001 - The Unesco Courier 22
In the 1950s, the Rockfeller and Ford foundations
transferred farm technology to Asia, which was
suffering from chronic food shortages, and Latin
America, which was ravaged by land conflicts. Both
areas were experiencing a rise in mass discontent, a
concern in the context of the Cold War.
The Green Revolution,which resulted from a massive
outpouring of public funding to small, o w n e r-
occupied farms, was based on the cultivation of high-
yield crops such as rice and wheat,the expansion of
irrigation and the spread of agro-chemicals, but
without mechanization.Affecting approximately half
the southern hemisphere’s farmers, it boosted their
yields and, especially in Asia, helped them achieve
food self-sufficiency.
But the Green Revolution had little impact on the
most disadvantaged areas. Elsewhere, this model is
in crisis because of declining public aid in the wake
of structural adjustment, harmful effects on the
environment caused by the use of chemical fertilizers
and pesticides, and the economic vulnerability of
farmers who have shifted from mixed-crop
subsistence farming to single-crop cultivation for the
market. ■

It would seem that the rural population is ageing everywhere,
isn’t it?
That’s something I observed while doing research on the beneficiaries of
agrarian reform in the Philippines several years ago. To be fruitful,access
to land must be accompanied by access to credit.Banks grant loans over
30-year periods.When a farmer is over 50,he finds himself at a dead end.
Why do young people want to leave the land?
First, because they don’t own any, or very little. Rural poverty increased
during the 1980s as a result of structural adjustment plans that countries
in debt negotiated with the IMF. That is something I observed in three
cases: the Madi valley in Nepal, which opened up to agriculture in the
1960s; the Sinai desert in Egypt, which has been farmed for a dozen
years;and the state of Pernambuco in Brazil.
Are the three situations similar?
In Nepal,the plots are too small and there is no hope of enlarging them.
The future there lies in emigrating to India, where the Nepalese, who
have a reputation for integrity and bravery, have locked up the security-
guard market, or to the Gulf states. In Ras Sudr, Egypt, the government
gives each family a plot of land where it grows olive trees and vegetables.
The nearby tourist resorts are an outlet for their produce. These families
had no hope of moving anywhere else in Egypt because inequality of land
ownership is still rife. There is one overriding feeling in Ras Sudr:
resignation.
Are the landless Brazilian farmers more determined?
Yes, the beneficiaries of agrarian reform know that in town their children
will spend more and be exposed to a crime-ridden environment. Most
often, they are former farm labourers who know a lot about soils and
crops. But the other side of the coin is that they were wage-earners who
worked in mechanized agriculture, and lack the savings mentality that
characterizes farmers in Asia. I spoke with a farmer who sold his corn
harvest to purchase cornmeal in a store. For every $14 he earned, he
spent $13.90. Not producing the food you consume is incomprehensible
to me. ■

society at the United Nations Research Institute for Social Development
in Geneva.
says Mazoyer. “ Without protectionism, w i t h o u t
trade barriers, they will not be able to grow.”
The second obstacle is agrarian reform. In a
recent study, Krishna Ghimire, a researcher at the
United Nations Research Institute for Social
Development (UNRISD),said that land ownership
remains a hidden explosive issue.The best-known
case is Brazil,where 20 percent of the landowners
possess 88 percent of the land (see pp. 2 4 - 2 6 ) .O n l y
a few countries have undertaken genuine agrarian
reform, including Mexico in the early days of the
twentieth century; Japan,Taiwan and South Korea
after the Second World Wa r ; China and Cuba after
their revolutions.Almost everywhere else, the laws
passed in the 1950s and 60s have not been applied.
In southeast A s i a , only India’s West Bengal and
Kerala states, where 10 percent of the region’s
population lives,have completed land redistribution.
Furthermore, says Krishna Ghimire, the major
international organizations have come round to
the doctrine of “market-assisted agrarian reform,”
which assumes that the law of supply and demand
can be fairly applied. But how could an Egyptian
agricultural worker acquire a feddan of land (0.42
h e c t a r e ) , which would cost him the equivalent of an
entire lifetime’s income?
To show the potential of the family farm, the fact
that it is not a solvent market for agro-industry has
to be acknowledged.Instead,it must accomplish a
scientific revolution geared towards its needs and
m e a n s. Only governments can undertake these
substantial research efforts, which must directly
involve farmers and their know-how.

consume the same produce that they sell.

not related to insufficient world production,” says

the poor countries.”Giving family farming a chance
at last is the indispensable condition to eliminate the
scourge of hunger. Farmers who are fighting for
their rights are also fighting for everyone to be able
to feed themselves decently and sufficiently. ■

And the meek shall
occupy the earth
Brazil’s landless peasants are fighting for more than just agrarian
reform—their goal is to build a new social order based on 
solidarity and mutual aid
2 . H OT SPOT S
A red banner flutters at the entrance to
the August 8 camp, a town of black
tent-houses and narrow alleys located
eight kilometres from Bagé and 120
kms from the border with Uruguay, i n
the Brazilian state of Rio Grande do Sul. It features
two peasants striding forth from a green map of
Brazil and the words “Landless Wo r k e r s ’
M o v e m e n t .”
Founded in the 1980s in southern Brazil to fig h t
for agrarian reform and land redistribution, t h e
Sem Terra movement operates in an unusual but
effective way: peaceful occupation of under-used
land belonging to transnational companies and big
landowners.
Brazil has plenty of such land. A f t e r
neighbouring Paraguay, it has the world’s highest
concentration of land ownership.About one percent
of landowners are thought to possess 46 percent of
the land,while 90 percent have less than 20 percent.
According to the National Institute for Land
Settlement and Reform (INCRA), the state body in
charge of agrarian reform, there are some 100
million hectares of idle land that could be farmed.
In the last 20 years, five million peasants and their
families have fled the countryside, largely because
of this unequal land distribution, and proceeded
to swell the ranks of the unemployed in already
overcrowded cities such as São Paulo and Rio de
Janeiro.
I t ’s an hour after dawn. Clouds and rain are
giving way to the sun, which finally emerges. A
strong wind whips through the streets of the little
t o w n , although a nearby thicket of eucalyptus trees
affords some protection.On one side of the tents,
men and women wash clothes in a stream. Th e
different teams in the camp are starting their daily
c h o r e s : some look for firewood, the only fuel
available, others cook food and clean,while others
meet to discuss the next steps in the fight for land.
Eight hundred farming families live in the town’s
200 various-sized dwellings made of wooden frames
and black nylon walls and roofs. On both sides,
behind wire fences, are 2,700 hectares of idle land
belonging to the Brazilian Agricultural Research
C o r p o r a t i o n .By the fir e,while the ch i m a r r ã o1 of tea
is passed around, C é s a r, the leader of the camp,
and Gilberto, his deputy, talk about the occupation
of the São Pedro estate a few kilometres away.
It began at 9pm when more than 3,000 people set
out for the estate.When they reached the entrance,
soldiers opened fire from a car. Realizing the size of
the advancing crowd, the troops retreated to the
safety of a building and continued fir i n g. Th e
peasants surrounded the house and pleaded with
them to stop. One marcher was killed and two
w o u n d e d . An hour later, the landowners and the
soldiers surrendered and São Pedro was occupied.
“ We stayed there for a few days,”says Gilberto,
“but then we decided to leave because the
government promised to give land to all the families
within 10 days.”
When black-tented camps 
grow into agro-towns
A few months later, the families still had no
l a n d , so new protests were mounted including a
450-km march to Porto A l e g r e, the state capital,
and further occupations. More than 30 children and
adults died during the struggle. Today, nine years
later, most of the families from the August 8 camp
have received land, but across Brazil there are
hundreds more black-tented camps.
Since 1984, landless peasants in Brazil have
occupied more than 3,900 estates and their campaign
has become one of the largest protest movements in
Latin A m e r i c a .After each occupation, they ask the
government to expropriate and redistribute the
land—as required by the 1988 Constitution—and
when the state does their bidding,the camp turns into
a settlement with more permanent structures.A b o u t
22 million hectares are thought to have been handed
over in this way to 618,000 families, many of whom
eat what they grow and sell what is left over through
a network of cooperatives.
The 8,000 settlements scattered through 24 of
Brazil’s 27 states are not just rice, bean and potato
plantations. There are kindergartens, schools and
c l i n i c s, meeting halls and churches. The most

“Our battle isn’t just to get land,” says economist
João Pedro Stédile, the movement’s national
c o o r d i n a t o r. “ We ’re building a new way of life,
s o c i a l l y, culturally and politically. Land is just a
stepping stone towards this new society, and each
occupation is a chance to start building our future.”
The movement, he says, “is changing the life of
peasants who were once marginalized and had no
f u t u r e. To d a y, they are working the land with dignity
and earning each month about the equivalent of
three times the minimum wage,which is more than
the average person living in the countryside.”
Fierce resistance from the 
country’s big landowners
During the first government of President
Fernando Henrique Cardoso (1994-98), a g r a r i a n
reform was presented as vital for the growth of family
f a r m i n g, a solution to food shortages and the way to
reduce rural confli c t .But Stédile argues that the new
p o l i cy followed the agricultural development model
promulgated by previous military regimes.
“ That economically-driven policy failed to
recognize the importance and potential of small-
scale farming in the production process. Fa m i l y
plots are still seen as backward in the capitalist
scheme of things. Governments seem to have
ignored the fact that over the past 36 years, since

agrarian reform began under President Jo ã o
Goulart in 1964, rural conflicts have continued and
are growing.Over the same period, food production
has risen but so has the number of hungry
Brazilians.”
In Stédile’s opinion, family plots are under siege
from a single model of agricultural development that
encourages growing cereals (especially soy) for
e x p o r t , and which requires huge investment in
transport infrastructure.
“Each occupation opens up a new area of
political and social formation, of struggle and
r e s i s t a n c e,” he says.“By occupying land, the peasants
are constantly recreating their own history and
winning a chance to negotiate.Th e y ’re also winning
a chance to get a new kind of education for their
children in the settlement and the right to a bigger
say in decisions about their future.”
The road has been far from easy. As expected,
the occupations prompted fierce resistance from
the big landowners, who ruthlessly worked to stamp
them out—persecuting and physically attacking
peasants and their leaders through gunmen and
paramilitary forces employed to drive protestors off
the land.According to the Catholic Church’s Land
C o m m i s s i o n ,which backs the Sem Terra movement,
1,169 violent deaths have occurred in rural Brazil
since 1985, including those of trade unionists,
p e a s a n t s, lawyers and priests. Only 16 culprits have
been tried and jailed.

To the peasants of the landless movement (MST),
agrarian reform is not just about land and capital.
It also means giving people the tools to become full-
fledged citizens. This is where access to education
becomes critical.
From the outset, MST leaders have not only striven to
teach families in the settlements basic literacy and
numeracy skills, but also to develop the political
awareness necessary to take a critical look at their
lives. Agrarian reform, social justice and the class
struggle are some of the topics teachers commonly
deal with, as well as encouraging discussion of
everyday living conditions.
The MST believes an organization can only survive if it
trains its own leaders, so it has set up several schools
for this purpose and a college (Iterra) to train
agronomists. There is also a medical brigade trained at
Cuba’s International School of Medicine, and eight
university teachers have been contracted to train MST
officials.
Primary and secondary education are also given pride
of place: the movement has opened about 1,000
schools on occupied land since the mid-1980s, in
which some 2,000 teachers give classes to 70,000
pupils.
To reduce truancy and combat illiteracy, the MST decided
early on to adapt the schools to the agricultural calendar.
The school year, which had always started in February or
M a r c h , no longer clashes with local sowing and harvest
times in the rainy season between January and May.Th i s
tripled the number of pupils in rural areas and halved
illiteracy and the dropout rate in many schools.
The Brazilian government acknowledged the success
of this approach and decided to follow suit in its own
public schools. The new school model involves
adapting education to rural conditions and respecting
local cultural values such as harmonious relations with
nature, a spirit of solidarity, a particular perception of
time, along with people’s close bond to the land and
their need to defend it. ■

In an effort to end these confli c t s, H e n r i q u e
Cardoso decided during his second term to ban the
expropriation of occupied estates. Stédile views
this as contradictory.“ The government wanted the
landless to stop occupying the estates by warning
them that occupied land would not be expropriated,
but the fact is that land is only handed over after
occupation and struggle.”
Violence against peasants has diminished in
recent years though Brazil is still lumbered with
the problem of how to redistribute its surfeit of
l a n d . The landless have opened up a breach and
have won property to farm alongside rewards such
as the Alternative Nobel Prize2.
Despite this, the current minister of agricultural
development,Raul Jungmann, recently suggested
that the  Sem Te r r a has strayed. “I think it’s
important to have mediators leading the protestors.
But the landless movement no longer plays this
role. It hasn’t been able to adapt to changes in the
world and to agrarian issues in Brazil.”
The minister pointed out that since he took
o f fice in 1996, the average annual number of newly
settled families has grown tenfold.The government’s
action,he stated,has two clear objectives: “reduce
the number of conflicts in the countryside and make
land reform more efficient.”
The movement contests this analysis and
remains well aware that the future of their struggle
will largely depend on not forgetting its original
aims. ■

As the sun sets on the sepia-coloured
h o r i z o n ,Ram Pal sits alone to tell his story.
“Let the land open wide and swallow us up.
My nine acres have become unproductive
due to water logging.The fields are full of
wild grass.I have a family of three to feed and a debt of
$1,100 to repay,” laments the 60-year-old farmer from
Kalalwala village in Punjab’s Bhatinda district. N o w
Ram Pal goes to the nearby town every day to work as
a labourer.
Like many farmers, he has been caught in the
vortex of Punjab’s agricultural crisis. Today, many
farmers living in one of India’s richest granaries
are in danger of losing their livelihood as agricultural
lands are slowly turning barren due to farming
practices aimed at increasing yields to meet demand.
Forty years ago, the state embarked on an
agrarian revolution, popularly known as the Green
Revolution (GR), designed to improve harvests. I t
was born out of a dire necessity to provide food
security for the country and reduce dependence
on imports from the We s t , which reached 10 million
tonnes in 1967.As a result of the GR,agricultural
productivity in Punjab grew by around six percent
annually for the next two decades. By the mid-
1980s, wheat and rice yields had trebled.
Rising costs as farmers step up
reliance on chemical fertilizers
U n d o u b t e d l y, the GR made Punjab—where 70
percent of the labour force works in agriculture
and related activities—one of the richest states in
India. Yearly per capita income (at current prices)
rose from $60 in 1980-81 to $440 in 1997-98, well
above the national $240 average.
But there is a flip side to this prosperity. A l w a y s
seeking to boost production, farmers made excessive
use of chemical fertilizers and pesticides,altered crop
patterns and overexploited groundwater resources.
Warning bells were sounded early on by M.S.
Swaminathan (see p. 3 6 ) , the eminent scientist who
masterminded the GR. “Irrigation without
arrangements for drainage could result in soils getting
alkaline or saline.Indiscriminate use of pesticides and
herbicides could cause adverse changes in the
biological balance,” he warned the Indian Science
Congress in 1968.
But the warning was not heeded.The soils have
been ravaged,central districts have depleted water
tables while others are waterlogged because of poor

drainage systems and heavy monsoons. Th o u g h
there have been no official reports indicating mass
rural exodus or decline in overall food yield in the
state, recent studies have revealed that the growth
rate in productivity has declined in most areas.
“ The GR was a reductionist strategy,not a total
s t r a t e g y,”says Pramod Ku m a r,director of the
Punjabi-based Institute for Development
and Communication. “It was more a grain
revolution than a green revolution. I t s
unsustainable policies have led to the poverty
of soil and the people.I call it the poverty of
p r o s p e r i t y.”
According to an official report,
dependence on chemical fertilizers, w h i c h
increased from 5,000 tonnes in 1960-61 to 1.3
million in 1998-99, has led to severe
micronutrient defic i e n cy in the soil.
F u r t h e r m o r e, in the absence of adequate
organic matter, soil organisms such as
b a c t e r i a , fungi and earthworms have been
reduced in number or lost altogether,n o t e s

“Since the soil has lost its natural capacity to
nourish the crops, we have to keep on adding

from $30 in 1984-85 to $80 in 1997-98,almost a three

crops like maize and pulses to wheat and rice
cultivation led to increased demand for groundwater.
“ Farmers sow paddy [rice] in the summer month of
May to meet a September 1 deadline set by the
government to procure paddy at a pre-fixed price.B u t
during the summer, crops need excess water, w h i c h
upsets the water table,” says S. P. M i t t a l , p r i n c i p a l
scientist at the Central Soil and Water Conservation
Research Centre in Chandigarh, the Punjabi capital.
Because of over- e x t r a c t i o n , the water table has
declined by one to three metres in more than 75
percent of the state.
At the same time, poor drainage systems and
the monsoons have led to waterlogging in the fie l d s.
A 1999 report estimates that agricultural lands
equivalent to a 2,350-square kilometre area in Punjab
have been affected. Once a field is waterlogged,
farmers have no other choice but to stop cultivation.
Many are forced to migrate to nearby towns for odd
jobs or wait for government help until the land
regains its fertility several years later.
An estimated 1.5 million hectares of land
already face various types of soil degradation. If this

These products are a thing of the past
and his harvests have improved.This 60-
y e a r-old father of seven, who lives in
Tangail district northwest of Dhaka,h a s
renewed confidence in the future.
Reazuddin is one of some 25,000
farmers around Bangladesh who have
joined the Nayakrishi A n d o l a n
m o v e m e n t .Created to help farmers after
the devastating floods of September
1 9 9 8 ,the movement not only advocates an alternative
method of farming—without pesticides or chemicals—
but also a more community-based approach that
draws on both traditional knowledge and scientific
i n n o v a t i o n s.
“ We insist that agriculture is not a factory or an
i n d u s t r y,” says Farhad Mazhar, a coordinator of
UBINIG (Po l i cy Research for Development
A l t e r n a t i v e s ) , the NGO that spearheaded the
movement.“Agriculture is a way of life, a cultural
p r a c t i c e. Our movement is about cultivating a
happier relationship with nature.”
For UBINIG, the extensive damage to crops
caused by the 1988 flood prompted a deeper
exploration of the agricultural crisis. In the early
1 9 9 0 s, the group carried out extensive research into
the impact of modern agriculture, introduced thirty
years earlier in Asia by the Green Revolution
through a package of chemical fertilizers,p e s t i c i d e s,
high-yielding seed varieties and irrigation water.
Their study pointed to declining soil fertility,a steady
increase in the use of fertilizers and a range of health
and nutrition problems.A decline in the quantity and
diversity of local fish populations was also reported,
while high-yielding rice varieties were failing to
produce the biomass needed to feed livestock.
The art of making good compost
and rotating crops
It is this whole ecological chain that Nayakrishi
Andolon is gradually trying to repair. Joining the
movement means adhering to a set of principles that
range from spurning pesticides, introducing mixed
cropping and crop rotation for soil fertility to
preserving seeds and genetic resources in farmers’
h a n d s.Winning adepts, h o w e v e r,has not always been
e a s y. “At the beginning, when workers from the
UB I N I G told us to grow crops without chemicals, w e
thought they were crazy,” recalls Rekha Begum,
from Kandapara village. “ They told us we could
make the soil fertile by using compost and taught us
how to prepare it in just over a month. Even though
the yield was a little below what others obtained by
using chemicals, when we calculated the cost of the
i n p u t s,we discovered we had more profit ,”she says.

trend continues, average yields per hectare are
expected to decrease, while reliance on fertilizers
will continue to push up production costs. Th e
situation is a deathknell for small farmers,who own
more than half of Punjab’s 1.2 million farms.
Ecological devastation and socio-economic
problems go hand in hand. Studies reveal that a
majority of farmers in Punjab take out short-term
loans at high interest rates to continue production.A
1999 Punjab University study found that
indebtedness among farmers has pushed up suicides
fourfold in ten years, while the rate in the rest of the
country is declining.
As the state’s agricultural crisis worsens,
solutions have been put forward.One of the most
urgent steps is to explore how certain regions could
be desalinated,says the noted scientist S.K.Sinha,
of the Indian Council for Agricultural Research
( I CA R ) .He also advocates policies that would give
farmers the incentive to shift to organic farming,
cultivate integrated soil healthcare systems involving
the use of green manure and reduce dependence on
water-consuming crops. ■

Scientists and peasants:
a fruitful alliance
Farmers have learnt to improve soil quality by
reintroducing natural nutrients such as composts
made with water hyacinth. Sugarcane yields have
increased thanks to the cultivation of nitrogen-
fixing crops like lentils and beans.Besides rice, t h e y
have started to grow varieties of pulses,oil seeds and
cereals that were once part of the daily diet.
Indigenous paddy varieties have reappeared along
with uncultivated crops such as creepers, w h i c h
account for up to 40 percent of food supply in some
a r e a s. More fish varieties have resurfaced and
production has improved, giving families greater
food security. According to a study by the UN
Development Programme (UN D P) , l i v e s t o c k
population has increased by 100 to 200 percent and
cash income by 50 to 200 percent since Nayakrishi
practices were introduced. Mixed cropping was
found to be three times more productive than
monocultures.
Control over seeds is a lifeline for farming

the seeds. Crop seeds are stored in community

Is your country self-reliant in food?
Since colonization, Philippine agriculture has
been export-oriented, and this is one of its
w e a k n e s s e s. From 1995 to 1999, it exported 8.25
million tonnes of banana, pineapple and mango,
but had to import 4.74 million tonnes of rice and 1.18
million tonnes of corn.
Our country doesn’t have basic industries.
Therefore agriculture has to import most farm
i n p u t s, tools and machines. Nine out of 13 big
pesticide companies in the Philippines are foreign.
They control 85 percent of the market. C o m p a n i e s
like Nestlé, Dole and Del Monte dominate the
processing and trade of food and agricultural
p r o d u c t s.Some of them also engage in agricultural
production and own or control vast tracts of land.
How has the situation evolved since the World
Trade Organization came into being in 1995?
30 January 2001 - The Unesco Courier 30
INTERVIEW BY MICHEL BESSIÈRES
UNESCO COURIER journalist
Can you briefly describe the situation of
a g r i c u l t u re in the Philippines? 
Agriculture is still the cornerstone of the
Philippine economy: it employs 40
percent of the active population (11.6
million in 1999). A majority of farmers use only
simple tools and draught animals. Most farms are
very small:only 2.1 hectares on average.
Landlessness is a major problem:seven out of ten
farmers do not own the land they till.They are bound
by feudal and semi-feudal relations of exploitation as
t e n a n t s,farm workers or lease-holders.A few families
control vast tracts of land: 60 percent of the
agricultural lands are in the hands of 13 percent of the
l a n d o w n e r s.The biggest landlords own more than 20
percent of all agricultural land.

During the 70s, when the country was under martial law, farmers formed clandestine
organizations that came into the open in the early 80s and started to launch mass campaigns.
KMP (Kilusang Magbubukid ng Pilipinas) a national federation of militant peasant organizations,
was officially founded in 1985. It counts 55 provincial chapters and an estimated membership of
800,000 poor and landless farmers.
One of the most powerful organizations of its kind in A s i a , KMP is a member of the international
Via Campesina farmers’ movement. It has been involved in several international campaigns
focusing on agro-chemical corporations and GMOs.
From November 13 to 30 2000, it joined the “The People’s Caravan–Citizens on the Move for
Land and Food Without Poisons,” a march comprising thousands of farmers, landless peasants
and anti-GMO advocates which travelled through Tamil Nadu (India), Bangladesh and the
Philippines. Additionally, partners from Japan, Korea and Indonesia also held events in their
respective countries.
During each leg, the Caravan staged educational teach-ins on globalization, pesticides and
genetic engineering; meetings and debates with local scientists along with food festivals to
promote pesticide-free products and celebrate local culinary diversity. It also organized seed
exchanges as an alternative to corporate control on seeds. ■

The Philippines has gone through a spectacular
shift from food exporter to food importer.In the fir s t
five years after the Agriculture Agreement came into
effect in January 1995,the Philippines incurred a total
agricultural trade deficit of $3.5 billion in contrast to
a $1.69 billion surplus in the previous five-year period.
Rice is not only the country’s most important
c r o p,providing a source of income to 3.2 million rice
f a r m e r s, it also provides 35 percent of the average
Filipino diet.Ye t , rice imports peaked at 2.2 million
tonnes in 1998, more than a quarter of local
c o n s u m p t i o n . Unstable prices can lead to large and
abrupt swings in purchasing power for poor
c o n s u m e r s.Such uncertainty contradicts the notion of
food security.
H ow does the use of agrochemicals affect
Filipino farmers? 
It started with the Green Revolution in the 70s
which farmers were almost forced to join as the
use of “high yielding varieties” was then part and
parcel of the bogus land reform programme of the
Marcos dictatorship. I remember that before we
always brought something home from our farms
even between harvesting seasons. There were
mudfish,snails and frogs. In this respect,our farms
were much more productive then. It was only after
the introduction of the so-called miracle rice that we
started to incur debts because we always had to
buy new pesticides every time there was a new pest
ravaging the fie l d s. Because of their debts, m a n y
farmers were driven from their land.
It is often argued that GMOs are the only way
to boost food production and meet the demand of
a rising population.Why do you refute this?
GMOs are the wrong answer to the wrong
p r o b l e m .The problem is not that there is not enough
f o o d , but that too many people have no access to
adequate food. Four out of five hungry people live in
countries that are exporting food,while Europe and
North America are facing a food surplus problem.
That is why they want to break open the markets of
poor countries for their agricultural products.
B e s i d e s, GMOs will increase the stranglehold of
transnational corporations. The top five
agrochemical companies also dominate the
transgenic seed business.They will dictate the terms.
The farmers will be at the losing end. So what’s the
use of increasing yields when you’re pushing
millions of small farmers deeper into perennial
poverty?
And then there’s the question of whether GMOs
will actually increase productivity. I doubt it. Fa r m s
that produce an adequate and diversified food
supply for the local market are much more
productive than those that produce only one crop
destined for cities or export.
Is organic farming an alternative, and is KMP
involved in any such experiments? 
KMP is first and foremost a campaign centre.We
encourage members to engage in organic farming
and to develop alternatives to destructive chemical-
intensive farming. We maintain close ties with a
range of Philippine NGOs that are experts in that

fie l d .With one of them,MA S I PAG,we are engaged in
the conservation,dissemination and development of

To be honest, organic farming is still quite
marginal in the Philippines because of the influ e n c e
of agro-chemical corporations. This is why it’s so
important to combine actual implementation of
organic agriculture with nationwide campaigns.
Sooner or later, we will be able to turn the tide.
The agriculture of the future will be much more
productive and beneficial for people and the
environment because it will be developed by the
farmers themselves.
Has KMP won many battles on the land re f o r m
front? 
Although it’s easy to focus on the problems,w e
s h o u l d n ’t forget the many victories.Thanks to their
campaigns, farmers have been able to reduce land
rents for instance,curb interest rates on farm capital
and increase the wages of farm workers.
There have also been cases of heroic resistance
to land grabbing.The farmers of Hacienda Looc in
the province of Batangas, for instance,were awarded
C e r t i ficates of Land Ownership Awards by the
Department of Agrarian Reform in 1991.Two years
l a t e r, the government-
controlled A s s e t
Privatization Trust sold the
same land to a company
that wanted to convert it
into a tourist spot with a
golf course. Although the
mighty real estate company
Fil-Estate Land Inc. a n d
local politicians are
applying every possible
tactic to drive the farmers
a w a y, they are still there.
Hacienda Looc has become a symbol of peasant
pride and resistance to landlords and big business.

C o h é r e n c e. “ That would be true if, after coming
home from the supermarket,we didn’t have to pay
taxes for the European Union’s common
agricultural policy, which amounts to 3,000 French
francs [about $400] per European household,
finance exceptional subsidies to offset periodic
drops in pork prices and,above all,foot the water
pollution clean-up bill.”
Brittany is no stranger to agricultural crises.
Each time one has arisen,the region has struggled
to overcome it as best it could, but the nagging
problem of water pollution is getting worse. H a r m f u l
nitrates from the 500 kilos of fertilizers per hectare
that farmers spread on their crops, or from foul-
smelling manure, are building up in rivers. Fo r
B r i t t a n y, that represents a toxic waste spill of 200,000
tonnes a day. In theory, France abides by the
p o l l u t e r-pays principle. But since the first water
pollution law was passed in 1964, p o w e r f u l
agricultural industry pressure groups have made
sure that it has never been enforced.
Marching for quality water and
a different kind of agriculture
As early as 1969, Eaux et Rivières de Bretagne,
an organization of salmon-fishers and nature-lovers,
sounded the alarm. Since then, the group has voiced
the discontent of its members, who have won a
lawsuit against the Lyonnaise des Eaux water
c o m p a n y : they deduct the pollution clean-up charges
from their bills.“On March 21, 1 9 9 9 ,” says livestock-
breeder and Cohérence member Denis Baulier,
“8,000 people demonstrated in Po n t i v y, in the centre
of Brittany, demanding both quality water and a
different kind of agriculture. That is the day when
consumers and farmers joined forces.”
As attitudes were changing, the condition of
rivers was deteriorating.The government launched
a pure water plan for Brittany in 1990,followed by
another one. Ten years and 1.5 billion francs later,
the amount of nitrates is higher than ever. Th e
government has even opened a second front by
implementing a plan to control agricultural
pollution. A recent government accounting office
report has blasted the scheme for abysmal
management.
“That plan has already cost five billion francs,”
says René Louail, a livestock-breeder from the
Côtes d’Armor region and spokesman for the
Confédération paysanne, a farmers’ group. “ Fo r
the most part, i t ’s been used to approve or legitimate

Wh a t ’s in Brittany? Three million
i n h a b i t a n t s, 57,000 farms and 22
million livestock animals, i n c l u d i n g
cows fed on animal meal, p i g s
enclosed in concrete pens by the
hundreds and industrially produced chickens that
have never seen the light of day. To catch up
economically with the rest of the country and to
provide jobs for its children, half a century ago this
region in western France adopted the only option it
was offered: production-intensive agriculture.E a c h
time there’s a hitch in the system, Brittany suffers.
First there were cyclical pig crises,now there’s mad-
cow disease.
But not everybody has lost hope. Standing in a
field of clover amidst his 35 cows, Pascal Hillion
believes he’ll make it through the epidemic.His secret:
his placid herbivores have always grazed on grass
instead of eating granules containing animal meal,
which causes bovine spongiform encephalopathy
( B S E ) . “In 1996, about twenty breeders, i n c l u d i n g
m y s e l f, created a label for our products, ‘ Fr o m
B r i t t a n n y ’s Pastures,’ which has helped us to win
back consumers’ trust and to show other breeders how
to proceed. We don’t use nitrate fertilizers, so our
method respects the environment,” he says. “ We
produce better-quality meat while spending less,
working less and earning a better living.Ten years ago,
people thought we were eccentric. To d a y, y o u n g
people who want to become farmers are studying us
c l o s e l y.” The 20 partners have even opened up a
b u t c h e r ’s shop in Saint-Brieuc.
This initiative will not revolutionize farming in
Brittany, but similar experiments are multiplying
thanks to a network of organizations. Seventy of
t h e m , grouped together under the name
“ C o h é r e n c e,” are trying to forge a new alliance
between farmers, environmentalists and consumers.
Everybody in the town of Lorient knows Dr.
Lylian Le Goff. Responding to a student council
r e q u e s t , he put organic food on the university
r e s t a u r a n t ’s menu, demonstrating that natural
products are not necessarily more expensive than
others. A nearby highschool has already followed
suit. And many local communities, after banning
beef from school cafeterias, wonder whether this
might be the answer to their worries.“Production-

André Pochon agrees. “ Farming in Brittany
started spinning out of control when the bond with
the soil was broken,” he says. D é d é , as everybody

encouraged to enroll in a teachers’ training college.
But he preferred cows and the Jeunesse agricole

a breeding ground for the trade union cadres who
were going to revolutionize Brittany’s agriculture.
“ We did a terrific job up to 1970. We boosted our
yield threefold while keeping the same number of

cows roam freely in the meadows and raised pigs on

increase yields.”
Dédé went along with the trend, but also took
correspondence courses and read a lot.“I became an
agronomist in spite of myself,” he says. He also
perfected his method of combining grass with clover
to fix nitrogen in the soil.As a result,he pursued and
improved the fodder revolution that had been under

farmers around him. A master of the one-liner, h e

ANNE LOUSSOUARN
Beijing-based journalist
Rage against the ex o d u s :
the crisis in China’s land reform
Punitive tax rates and falling revenues have combined to drive around
100 million Chinese peasants to the towns even as the spirit of protest
sweeps through the countryside
The village of Yuandu,70 kilometres from
the provincial capital of Nanchang, s e e m s
a quiet enough place. Elderly peasants in
threadbare Mao tunics lead their oxen
through the streets.Women attend to the
stalks of rice they have scattered over the road so the
occasional passage of a vehicle can help separate the
grain from the chaff.
The harvest is over. Everyone is preparing for a
quiet winter,or going off to work for a few months in
N a n c h a n g, a nearby town, or for their wealthy
neighbours in Fujian, Zhejiang or Guangdong
p r o v i n c e s. Just a few months ago on August 17,
h o w e v e r, the people of Yu a n d u , joined days later
by the inhabitants of nearby villages, staged violent
d e m o n s t r a t i o n s.
“ There are 300 officials in this village and we only
need 30,” shouts a woman in her 50s as she does her
laundry in a murky-looking pond.“ We have to get
rid of this huge burden.”She tills five m u (a third of
a hectare) of land—quite a big plot given that the
average population density in rural China is nearly
700 people per square kilometre.
She eats most of what she grows.
Chinese peasants only sell 20 to 30 per
cent of their yield. What she sells earns
her about 3,000 yuan (less than $300).
But she has to pay more than $100 in
land tax, a smaller amount for fertilizer
and pesticide and about $30 to a fund
for irrigation.Her annual net income as
a result comes to a little over $40. N o t
enough to pay for her children’s
schooling and certainly not enough to
buy meat,which she only eats three times
a year.“I borrow money from my sisters
who are laundresses in a hotel in
N a n c h a n g,” she says.
The youngsters have already left the village.“A lot
of people are trying to get rid of their land,”says one old
m a n . “But who’s going to want it?” The small rural
f a c t o r i e s,which have a hard time competing with those
in towns or abroad, are a shadow of what they once
w e r e.“ They can’t even pay their workers’ wages,”s a y s
a driver in the next town,Fe n g c h e n g.“Mostly it’s just the
managers who get paid.”
This over-taxing of the peasantry is seen as the
direct result of pressure on the local authorities to
e x c e e d , sometimes by a big margin, the tax ceiling of
five percent set by Beijing. In a letter in the
newspaper Nanfang Zhumo, Li Changping,the party
secretary of Qipan village in Hubei, says 80 percent
of peasants have gone into debt to pay their taxes.
But the local authorities have no alternative if
they are to make up the deficit in their budgets,
which are increasing by between 100,000 to 150,000
yuan (roughly $15,243) a year.The local bureaucracy
has nearly tripled from 120 to 340 people in the
past 10 years. The new leaders admit they cannot
stand up to the pressure of friends and family and
have no choice but to give them jobs as officials.
F u r t h e r m o r e,the costs of economic development
and running the village—including the maintenance
of infrastructure and irrigation, subsidies for schools,
support for local industry,upkeep of local militias,n o t
to mention embezzlement by bureaucrats, which is
constantly being denounced by press and party leaders
alike—have rocketed since the early 1990s.
Though heavy taxation triggered the unrest,
villagers’ discontent can be traced back to the
economic stagnation of the past decade, w h i c h
followed on from the euphoria that greeted the
end of collective farming in the 1980s.
A short-lasted
burst of prosperity 
Land is still collectively owned, but leased to
families for 30-year periods. In exchange, t h e
peasants must hand over a fixed part of their
production to the state at set prices before being
able to sell the rest on the free market. Since this
gives peasants more of a stake in the system, per-
hectare cereal production shot up by over 50 percent
between 1975 and 1985,according to the UN Food
and Agriculture Organization (FAO).
Meanwhile, the number of people working on
the land has dropped sharply, boosting production
by nearly 20 percent a year at village factories set up
in the wake of decollectivization to employ surplus
l a b o u r. Nearly 120 million people work in these
factories today.Estimates suggest that around 50 to
60 million peasants left the land at the end of the
1980s to look for better paid work in the towns,
mainly in construction, restaurants and domestic
service. Even in those jobs, an urban standard of
living is still higher than the hard life in the
countryside and better reflects the aspirations of
modern Chinese youth. For the villagers who stayed
b e h i n d , these far-reaching changes led to quite
unexpected profits and a sudden burst of prosperity.
But productivity gains also led to over-
p r o d u c t i o n ,which set off a disastrous price collapse

at the very same instant that the cost of farm supplies,
including fertilizers and pesticides,was steadily rising
(at nearly 15 percent a year between 1984 and 1996).
Families were thus trapped between rising tax
demands and stagnant incomes, or even, a c c o r d i n g
to some Chinese experts, incomes that have fallen
over the past three years. The exodus from the
countryside is increasing and now totals between 80
and 100 million men and women. And there is no
sign that this rural depopulation is going to stop,e v e n
though moving to the towns has been made more
d i f ficult through the introduction of the h u k o u o r
place of origin system, a kind of internal passport that
nails the Chinese to their place of birth.
The oncoming shock of the
World Trade Organization
Chinese experts believe that the farm crisis
stems from an incomplete liberalization,which they
note has been less sweeping than in the towns:this
would account for very low productivity rates caused
by tiny plots of land, a labour force that is still too
big and a crippling lack of bank loans needed for
capital investment.Cereal production in China, f o r
instance, is currently half what it is in France.
All of which adds up to a peasantry stripped of
power over their land.“Some local authorities often
force the villagers to plant what produces the best
tax revenues.But since everybody does the same, t h e
prices collapse within two years and the villager is
the loser,” explains Dang Guoying, a researcher at
the Academy of Social Sciences.

The rice harvest in the province of Guizhou won’t cushion the coming blow of lower market prices with China’s entry into the W TO.
Organization (WTO ) .Villagers are mostly unaware
of this, but they are almost certain to bear the brunt
of the change. How are they going to cope with
probable imports of much cheaper farm produce
given that some Chinese prices are far above world
market levels? In April 1999, for example, C h i n e s e
wheat was 44 percent higher, maize 67 percent, r i c e
26 percent and cotton 17 percent higher, a c c o r d i n g
to official Chinese statistics from 1999. Some experts
say China can use its comparative advantage in the
long-term by exporting labour-intensive items such
as fruit, vegetables and fis h . But according to
forecasting by the FAO,C h i n a ’s farming population
will still have to fall by 60 million over the coming
d e c a d e.
Will farmers have enough power to cushion the
shock? Since 1988, villagers have been able to elect
their own committees outside the framework of the
party and have thus won the right to a greater say in
economic management,whereas industrial workers
remain under tighter party control. “ What we’r e
seeing are more discussion groups at the village

t r e n d s. Another specialist, Liu Ya w e i , e m p h a s i z e s
that “villagers have learned how to obstruct moves
by local officials and take matters up at a higher
o f ficial level, even by inviting journalists from the
well-known national television programme Fo c u s

corruption and blatant injustice.” And no one has
forgotten that over the course of China’s 3,000-year

for the lasting eradication of poverty.This calls for
a paradigm shift in thinking about development
from a “do good”approach based on patronage to
one of genuine partnership with the poor.M a h a t m a
Gandhi in India was one of the first to deprecate the
p o l i cy of “poor feeding,” insisting that governments
and communities must enable everyone to e a r n h i s
or her daily bread.
Eco-jobs and micro-credit
to boost village income
These considerations led to the birth of the
biovillage movement in Po n d i c h e r r y. The term
“ b i o v i l l a g e ” is derived from the Greek word b i o s,
which means living, and our priority was just that:
human-centred development. Poverty persists in
conditions where human resources are undervalued
whereas land and material resources are overvalued.
The biovillage model of rural and agricultural
development is designed to remedy this imbalance
by conserving and enhancing natural resources,
eradicating poverty and empowering women.
This programme has been in progress in 19
villages in Pondicherry since 1994, covering a
population of 24,000 people, though we have plans
to extend the scheme to around 375,000 people
throughout the region by 2007. One leg of the
programme is eco-farming, meaning that chemicals
and capital—the building blocks of modern
farming—are replaced with knowledge and
biological inputs like vermiculture [exploitation of
e a r t h w o r m s ] , bio-fertilizers and bio-pesticides; t h i s
in turn creates new eco-jobs in villages. Th e
p r o g r a m m e ’s other leg is the creation of more
avenues for rural non-farm employment based on
marketing opportunities.
New opportunities for earning a living are
devised through analyzing a family’s resources.As
a result, landless labouring families take to
household mushroom cultivation, ornamental fis h -
rearing, coir rope-making, rearing small ruminant
animals under stall-fed conditions and other
enterprises which are within their means. Th o s e
with a small plot of land can take to hybrid seed
p r o d u c t i o n , flo r i c u l t u r e,d a i r y i n g,poultry and other
high value enterprises. Groups of assetless women
engage in aquaculture in community ponds. A l l
these exercises are based on micro-level planning,
and enterprises supported by micro-credit.

B i o v i l l a g e s :
a blueprint for the future?
The father of India’s Green Revolution—and early critic of its abuse —
has a new brainchild: villages where the poor have the means to earn
their living and preserve the land
The 20t h century ended with spectacular
achievements in every field of human
endeavour and the spread of democratic
systems of government. It also ended with
nearly a billion people going to bed
partially hungry and with the universal goals of
“ f o o d , h e a l t h , l i t e r a cy and work for all” s t i l l
remaining distant dreams.The uneven progress in
bringing the benefits of modern science and
technology to the least well-off, particularly in the
areas of medicine, a g r i c u l t u r e, i n f o r m a t i o n
technology and biotechnology, has led to increasing
divides between rich and poor in areas that are
critical to human well-being: d e m o g r a p h i c
distribution, technological and digital access, and
economic power.
Any objective balance sheet of human
achievements during the 20th century thus reveals
both “ b r i g h t ” spots in relation to prosperity built on
technological innovation, and “hot spots” w h e r e
poverty, deprivation and gender inequity remain,
and in some cases have even worsened.
The M. S. Swaminathan Research Fo u n d a t i o n
was established in Chennai [formerly
Madras] in India in 1990 with the aim of
addressing environmental degradation,
population explosion,poverty and gender
injustice at the micro-level in a few such
social “hot spots.” The Fo u n d a t i o n ’s
mandate is to impart a pro-nature, p r o -
poor and pro-women orientation to an
economic growth strategy in rural areas—
a strategy that above all else focuses on
creating jobs. This emphasis stems from
the fact that jobless economic growth is
joyless growth, and the observation that
inadequate purchasing power is the
overriding cause of household food
i n s e c u r i t y.
The Union Territory of Pondicherry in
the state of Tamil Nadu was chosen as the place to
start this adventure in empowering women and
men mired in poverty with skills, information and
access to technology. Such people are poor only
because they have no assets—no land,no livestock,
no houses and often no education.Their only assets
are time and labour.Our challenge was therefore to
enhance the economic value of these assets, a goal
that could be achieved through a transition from
unskilled to skilled work. Asset building and
community development have to be the pathways

UNESCO COURIER journalist
Will the College crumble?
The debate is only beginning over how the U.S. elects the world’s most powerful leader
efore laying the U. S. presidential election
saga to rest, l e t ’s revisit a favourite
bedtime story: The Three Little Pigs,
featuring Ralph,Al and Dubya.
The scene opens in the Green
wilderness where Ralph puts up a tent
and lights a campfire as young friends
gather to revel in his stories of slain
corporate giants.To stoke the excitement,
Ralph suddenly cries “ Wo l f ! ” In the
c o n f u s i o n , he runs to a house nearby
where he finds a warm meal and bed.
Cunning as a fox,he continues his “ Wo l f ! ”
cry and crosses the country in style.
Enter A l : a serious piggy, who has
spent years laying the foundations of his
fine home.The problem is that Al invested
so much in the bricks and mortar that he
overlooked a few details, namely little
holes in the ballot-lined roof. So after a
few weeks of huffing and puffin g, the wolf
blows his house down to a pile of chads.
Fi n a l l y,Dubya (referring to the middle
initial of George W. Bush) and the clan
arrive to reclaim an old stomping ground,
the Electoral College, a fortress dating
back over 200 years, whose framers
examined every nook and cranny before
sealing it constitutionally (see box). Th e
wolf ferociously attacks, enlisting the
majority of voters who throw their weight
against the candidate, but the College
d o e s n ’t budge.
But here’s the twist: the wolf is still
scratching at the College—which looks
increasingly like a crumbling relic.And his
howls are bouncing around the halls of
Congress and state legislatures, sending
shivers up the spines of politicians now
faced with a flurry of petition drives and
Internet campaigns by interest groups
seeking reform.
In fact, there are now three
congressional bills to scrap the Electoral
College and have voters elect the
president and vice president directly1. If
a candidate failed to secure 40 percent of
the vote, a run-off election would ensue.
I r o n i c a l l y, the most consistent call for
reform has come from a Republican,
Representative Ray LaHood of Illinois.
“ I t ’s a slap in the face to have a select
group of elites elect a president a month
after the people have cast their votes,” h e
says.
Before turning to politics,LaHood was
a highschool teacher in a quandary: h e
had to instruct students about an electoral
system he considered archaic. “I always
knew it would take a crisis to provoke a
controversy and now we have it,”r e f e r r i n g
to the bitter disputes over the popular
vote for Al Gore.“My own party doesn’t
support this… But for me, i t ’s a matter of
p r i n c i p l e.” Lahood notes “a huge shift in
public support,”especially since high-fly i n g
D e m o c r a t s, like the newly-elected Senator
Hillary Rodham Clinton, began climbing
aboard the bandwagon.
A constitutional amendment would

require two-thirds approval in the House
of Representatives and the Senate,
followed by a majority vote by three-
quarters of state legislatures. Wh i l e
LaHood foresees hearings in the House
this year,he expects small (low-population)
states to quash debate in the Senate just as
they did to a similar bill in 1969 after
Richard Nixon almost lost the presidential
election because of the “ s p o i l e r ”G e o r g e
Wa l l a c e, an independent candidate from
Alabama with an anti-liberal platform.
Just as they did 30 years ago, most small
states continue to believe that they have a
decisive advantage in the Electoral College.
For example, the District of Columbia and
the five least populous states have a total of
2.6 million voting-age residents.To g e t h e r,
they had 18 electoral votes in the 2000
election—the same number as Michigan,
which has 7.2 million voting-age residents.
Direct elections:
a formula for civil war?
But let’s imagine—or predict,as many
pollsters are already doing—that another
r a z o r-thin election in 2004 results in a
minority-elected president.Public support
could reach fever pitch and America might
finally opt for direct elections. Or if the
constitutional amendment proves too
d i f fic u l t , the states could follow the path of
Maine and Nebraska, which allocate all
but two of their electoral votes
proportionally instead of a winner- t a k e s - a l l
f o r m u l a . The remaining two votes are
awarded to the statewide winner. H o w
would the “little piggies” then fare in the
future? 
“ They will go hunting where the ducks
a r e,” says Judith Best, a political science
professor at State University New York at
C o r t l a n d , who testified at congressional
hearings in 1997 about the Electoral
C o l l e g e. In direct elections, c a n d i d a t e s
would focus on winning votes in populous
areas—namely the east and west coasts—
and ignore the middle of the country.In the
race to run up a mathematical majority,
they would see no need to build a broad
cross-national coalition.“ This is a formula
for civil war,”she says.To govern such a vast
and diverse country, the president must
stitch together a campaign based on local
and national issues. “If you don’t have a
system which forces candidates to reach out
to the diverse interests of people, t h e y
w o n ’t . Black and Latino influ e n c e, f o r
e x a m p l e, would drop like a stone. B l a c k s
represent just 12 percent of the
p o p u l a t i o n ,” she says, but they currently
enjoy leverage “as swing voters in many
s t a t e s.”
Best may want to check her
a r i t h m e t i c.According to David Bositis, a
senior analyst at the nation’s most
respected black think-tank, the Jo i n t
Center for Political and Economic Studies,
“direct elections would not diminish the
minority vote but may enhance it. Th e
minority population does not live in the
small states, which have the biggest
favourable vote in terms of the Electoral
C o l l e g e. A lot of the black and Hispanic
populations live in states like Mississippi,
Te x a s,Alabama and the Carolinas where
they vote Democrat but the majority votes
R e p u b l i c a n . So their votes don’t count.”
“ The small states would get less
attention but at least we would have more
states getting some attention,” s a y s
Harold Gold, an associate professor of
government at Smith College in
M a s s a c h u s e t t s. “ This last election was
fought in 17 states.The others saw nothing
of the candidates.Under direct elections,
there are no safe states.Al Gore could go
to Texas [a Republican stronghold] and
try to pick up the liberal votes.”
But instead of actually visiting those
“enemy states” and shaking hands with
ordinary folks,candidates would rely upon
mass media campaigns, namely through
t e l e v i s i o n , according to Curtis Gans,
director of the Committee for the Study of
the American Electorate, a highly
respected non-partisan,n o n - p r o fit research
i n s t i t u t e.“A giant media campaign would
reduce any incentive for a grassroots
campaigning and activism,” he says.
There is one point of agreement:
direct elections would offer a “ m o r e ”
level playing field to third parties.“ M o r e ”
is key—for these new players would still
suffer from financial handicaps (parties

must receive five percent of the vote in
the previous election to qualify for federal
campaign financing). But they might
finally break free from the role of the
“ s p o i l e r,” a nightmare for Ralph Nader’s
campaign strategist,Steve Cobble. “Ten
days before the elections, the polls
predicted that Ralph would receive five to
six million votes,” says Cobble. In the
end, the vote was so close that he only
received about half that, largely because
a vote for Nader was seen as a vote for
Bush.“In this country, we firmly believe
in the benefits of competition,” a d d s
Cobble,“except in the field of politics. ”
Multiple-party systems are seen
internationally as a sign of a vibrant
d e m o c r a cy. But critics from both the
American left and right warn that
“healthy competition” could quickly
degenerate into hyper-factionalism and
the backroom dealing of the Israeli
K n e s s e t , which is considered an emblem
of instability.
“I think there is some middle
g r o u n d ,” says Rob Richie, of the non-
p r o fit Center for Voting and Democracy.
The solution lies in obliging the winning
candidate to gain 50 percent of the vote,
explains Richie, and installing an instant
runoff mechanism so that voters could
list their first and second choices on the
same ballot.“ With an instant runoff, t h e r e
w o u l d n ’t be that nasty edge of one
candidate trying to destroy another,w h i c h
turns off voters. [A candidate like] Nader
could implicitly endorse his opponent as
a second choice, which is one way of
building a more coherent system.”
How would third parties compete in
the new landscape of direct elections?
Would they dynamize the debates?
According to Democratic pollster Paul
M a s l i n ,“this past election was the supreme
example of how the Electoral College sets
up a huge fight for the middle.”
Demographer Joel Garreau goes a step
f u r t h e r. “Both candidates ran as Bill
C l i n t o n ,which is to say both were willing to
do whatever it took in terms of degrading
their ideological positions to achieve the
c e n t r e.”Al Gore, for example, ducked the
issue of gun-control to woo voters in the
pro-gun swing states of Michigan and
P e n n s y l v a n i a . George W. Bush raised the
ire of the Republican conservative wing
by downplaying his anti-abortion position.
Under direct elections, it would be more
e f ficient for major party candidates to run
up their votes by moving closer to their
respective ideological poles, which would
leave space in the middle for third parties.
Slipping past the radar 
of the pollsters
“ This is one reason,”says Gerry Moan,
chairman of the populist Reform party,
“why we focus on trade policy and
campaign fin a n c i n g.Social issues get you
caught in either the left or the right—but
the battle will be for the middle.”
So much for a new era of vibrant and
diverse policy debates that third parties
were supposed to introduce… Other than
“ s p o i l i n g ” an election, third parties can
have the most impact by pushing a main
party into a new position, according to
G a r r e a u . “If a third party starts to get
traction on an issue that the majors didn’t
e x p e c t , then suddenly those positions
become ‘safe’ for mainstream candidates.”
But given the sophistication of the
demographics industry, can third parties
get far with a hot issue before someone
like Ed Goeas, a Republican pollster,
appropriates it? “My radar system is
constantly looking at the issues and
agendas to incorporate changes as they
e m e r g e.” I n d e e d , Goeas expects the
current outrage over the Electoral College
to subside after a few Congressional
hearings which most Americans will never
know took place.
But they may be in for a shock in 2004
if another razor-thin election materializes
and Republicans face their own “ s p o i l i n g
N a d e r,” in the form of John McCain.
According to many pollsters, the senator
from Arizona (who lost the Republican
nomination this time round) could have
won 25 percent of the vote as an
independent candidate. In which case, it
may soon be in all parties’ interest to cast
their ballots for direct elections. ■
Relic or re m e d y ?
It’s hard not to smirk about the fact that U.S. citizens don’t vote for their president. Instead they
vote for a slate of electors who are supposed to cast their ballots for a particular candidate. Every
state has as many votes in the Electoral College as the total number of its senators (two) and
representatives (based on population) in Congress. If no candidate receives a majority of electoral
votes, the House of Representatives chooses but each state has only one vote. What did the
constitutional framers have in mind? 
It is often assumed that the College arose out of mistrust of the masses. But 200 years ago, the
voting population consisted exclusively of an elite group of white men. The framers were looking to
break the communications gap:neither media nor political parties existed to spread the word of the
candidates. The solution: elect a council of wisemen to keep abreast of the issues and potential
presidential candidates.
According to John Samples of the libertarian Cato Institute, the framers deliberately sought to
complicate the electoral process to ensure that the president would represent local and national
constituencies. In this way, they could balance the interests of both small and large states.
Yet behind the federal debate lurked the scourge of slavery. According to Akhil Reed Amar, a Yale
University law professor, the southern states feared that they would be outnumbered in direct
elections because their huge slave populations could not vote. They sought a remedy in a previous
compromise in which they won the right to count each slave as three-fifths of a person in
determining the number of representatives they could send to Congress. They wanted the same
principle applied in the Electoral College.
In many ways, “the framers’ argument is irrelevant,” says George C. Edwards III, director of the
Center for Presidential Studies at Texas A&M University. For example, the framers never even
imagined that states would allocate their electoral votes on a “winner-takes-all” basis. More
importantly, “One of the clearest trends in American constitutional history has been the expansion
of franchise—with amendments to give the right to vote to minorities, women and the residents of
the District of Columbia.Since the 1960s, we have become dedicated to the principle of ‘one person,
one vote.’ Every elected official is selected that way—except for the president.” ■

LEO TUOR
Romansh writer
Chugging along on
E u ro p e ’s literary ex p re s s
What happens when one hundred writers spend a month without books on a tra i n , d e b a t i n g
in more than 40 languages and stopping along the way to meet the crowds? For one
t ra v e l l e r, the Litera t u re Express Europe 2000 did not live up to its dream of cultural dialogue
ne hundred writers on the same train.
Aw e s o m e. U n p r e c e d e n t e d . The train
started in Lisbon and was called the
Southern Express until it reached Paris.
Then it went to Berlin,Saint Petersburg
and Moscow, for which it was rechristened
the Northern Express.For the purposes of
the entire trip, t h e r e f o r e, it was the North-
South Express. A legend comparable to
the Orient Express was born.
I boarded the train without any
preconceptions. It was enough for me to
know that in Germany, where the idea
was invented, it was called
Literaturexpress Europa 2000 and in
other countries the Comboio da literatura
europa 2000, the Expreso da literatura
europa 2000, the Literaturtrena europa
2000 or Literaturas ekspresis eiropa, a n d
so on.A train with many names that all
said the same thing but had a different
ring each time. In that sense, it was lyrical;
what more could poets ask for?
And by the way, what would a train
like this be like without cellular phones,
cameras and other substitutes for male
virility? A n s w e r : it would be worthless.
Cellular phones, extensively used during
the trip by serious-looking passengers,g a v e
the train a distinctive feel.They were to our
train what the six-shooter is to the western.
At fir s t , there was just a train.Only as
time went by did it become our train, f o r
all of us writers,attendants and journalists.
Much to my surprise, the journalists were
very polite.They belong to our big family.
We accepted them and that put them at
e a s e.We didn’t mind the situation, for not
only were the questions they asked very
different from the common ones,but they
also took a more original approach to
photographing us. They were our
t e a m m a t e s, in the noble sense of the term.
Our train is on the Internet:
w w w. l i t e r a t u r e x p r e s s. o r g. We travelled
across Europe at top speed, but our souls
did not follow. But we are on the Internet,
therefore we are.
We represent a vast potential: t h e
European intelligentsia on rails. All of
us travelled quietly in the same direction,
in first-class. If the train disappeared in

Bordeaux is in fact the city of the
writers Montaigne,M o n t e s q u i e u
and Mauriac.
Q u e s t i o n : “ What do you
think of the train?”the journalists
a s k . We asked each other the
same thing.This idea is already a
reality for us. For the sake of
literature we have already
embarked on an adventure that
no longer has anything to do with
l i t e r a t u r e. The train is nothing
more than an outlandish event,
by dint of which it is also a classic
short story, like a slight
earthquake in Chile, the monster of
Kaliningrad or God knows what else. O n
top of which,no one expects us to present
our works.Our books are not on the train.
No one—strictly no one—asks us for our
t e x t s. That is what makes this train so
s p e c i a l .We travel naked,authors without
b o o k s. A library car designed to house
our writings in every European language
never got beyond the planning stage.
Until Kaliningrad, we would have been
best off reading a book entitled T h e
Critique of Pure Illusion.2
Trick question:other people are always
the ones asking the questions. Now it’s
our turn. What do you think of our
literature? Why haven’t you read our
books? Why aren’t you interested in what
we wrote before and after 19913, and in
what we are going to write in the future?
Whether we’re going to continue licking
the boots of the president of the Republic
or ruthlessly continue throwing everything
we think into his face? You don’t know
anything about what we write and you
c o u l d n ’t care less.Yo u ’re only interested in
us because we make you look good.
“ Why did you join this trip?” a
journalist asks me at the Gare de l’Est in
Paris. Or was it the Gare du Nord or the
Gare Saint Lazare? I really don’t know
a n y m o r e. All those train stations start
looking the same after a while. Let’s get
back to the question.The journalist asked
what I think of religions. Damn! Th a t
wasn’t it. It was, “Why did you join this
t r i p ? ” Or something like that. It didn’t
m a t t e r, just so long as the answer was
clever and well-founded.
Here you go then: I am on this trip
because I wanted another chance to
escape from my mountains and my native
l a n g u a g e, R h a e t o - R o m a n i c, which is
spoken by a mere 40,000 people,almost all
of whom know each other.We sometimes
feel cramped and would like to get out
into the so-called wide world to hear and
speak other languages. This journey
seemed like a godsend to satisfy that basic
n e e d , though I will not conceal the fact
that it was also inexpensive and accessible.
I also wanted once and for all to answer a
crucial question that every mountain-
dweller asks and that Schiller,who was not
a mountain-dweller but a poet,put in the
following terms: Fa t h e r, are there
countries where there are no mountains?
I left, fully aware of the risk that this train
could turn into a nightmare, into a train of
m a d n e s s. The reasons that led me into
taking this trip are so to speak, p r a c t i c a l
and cognitive at the same time.
A look back: Madrid is astounding;
Paris takes itself seriously; L i s b o n ,
destroyed by the 1755 earthquake, is by
far Europe’s most disillusioned city. It is
the only one that has not repressed its
past.It has the oldest soul.
What will be left of all these cities
one day? Wind.

discussing in Spanish,Rhaeto-Romanic,
O c c i t a n , French and Catalan whether
Europe is only made up of cities and
p o l l u t i o n .The discussion started with the
fall of the west (that is why this train of
“ w e l l - b e i n g ” is rolling east), then shifted
to the skirt-chaser who answered to the
name of Picasso, street brawls between
hooligans in Brussels, the poor
organization of the literary train and the
exasperation of many of our fellow
writers who have had more than enough
of wasting their time and would like to be
taken more seriously. L a t e r, the little
group took a close look at the concept of
literary freedom before coming to the
overall conclusion that only a writer who
does not depend on any publishing
company can claim he or she is free.
On the approach to Dortmund, w e
organized a group prayer session to ask
for a hotel that was a little more
presentable than the pigsties where we
stayed in Brussels. And our prayer was
a n s w e r e d . In this magnificent German
city, we were put up in lavish suites. For
two nights we felt like Nobel Prize
winners, considerably lifting our spirits,
which had been sagging since Paris.
At the Hanover Expo2000, we were
caught in a sudden downpour. Th e
t h u n d e r, lightning and wind were a
deliverance after the torrid heat of the
d a y. My shirt sticking to my skin, I ran all
the way to the Schweizerpavillon (the
Swiss pavilion), which attracted me so
irresistibly that this was my fifth visit.
For once, Switzerland was illustrated
neither through cows nor Alpine horns.
There was no facade, but an open maze
with 50 entrances that doubled as exits.
An open Switzerland.
Hanover was our last stop in the west.
It was also the longest day.
Our encounter with the east: on both
sides of the presidential palace gate, m e n
of steel were holding their semi-automatic
rifles planted in front of them like heavy
c a n d e l a b r a . They stared and never
b l i n k e d . We found that idiotic but got
used to it. We walked between the steel
men and through the house before
reaching the garden to drink and chat.
The thoughtful president delivered his
e u l o g y. For the occasion, we were the
d e a d , invited to an umpteenth reception.
A whisper was on everyone’s lips: t h e

LES BACK
Acting Head of the Centre for Urban and
Community Research at Goldsmiths College,
London. This article is an edited excerpt from his
forthcoming co-authored book (with Vron Ware)
provisionally entitled THE TROUBLE WITH WHITENESS, to
be published by the University of Chicago Press in
2001.
White fortresses in
c y b e rs p a c e
The face of racism changes on the Internet as preppy professionals join the ranks of the
“classic” tattooed skinheads. Will they prove even more dangerous?
fter celebrating the Internet as a digital
nirvana in which democracy and free
speech flo u r i s h , we are finally uncovering
the dark side in which racists and
xenophobes not only broadcast their
propaganda in cyberspace but also ply their
paraphernalia and hate through
international networks.However the spate
of scare stories about the burgeoning tide
of racist online materials ignores the
ultimate question: is the face of racism
c h a n g i n g ?
Most articles focus exclusively on the
number of websites, virtual discussion
groups and chat rooms spreading the
messages of white supremacist groups
like the Ku Klux Klan, White A r y a n
Resistance and the British National Party,
which first seized the Internet as an
unregulated and relatively cheap media in
the mid-1990s. While there is no doubt
that these sites and groups are growing,
accurate estimates are difficult to
c a l c u l a t e.To investigate hate on the Net,
you must combine the skills of a detective,
a lie detector and propaganda code
breaker. For online materials are part of
a digital masquerade that conceals as
much as it shows. You cannot simply
count and record web addresses because
of the frequency in which pages are
posted and taken down.H o w e v e r,e x p e r t s
agree that there are hundreds of sites,
perhaps as many as 3,000.
Much of the debate about hate on
the Net has revolved around censorship.
Internet Service Providers (ISP) may
voluntarily prohibit use of their servers
and install filters along with web browsers
to prevent access to key racist sites. But it
is almost impossible to regulate the Net as
a whole.The debate about censorship has
become a cul-de-sac because of the
seemingly irreconcilable tension between
the libertarian ethos of free speech and
the difficulty in defining the limit of what
is morally acceptable to say or write. To
some extent, the polemic overshadows
the critical issue:what is drawing people
into the racist Net world?
“WHITE PRIDE WO R L DW I D E ” —
with this slogan, Don Black of the U. S.
launched the world’s first and most
notorious racist website S t o r m f r o n t o n
March 27,1 9 9 5 .B l a c k ,a former Klansman,
learned his computer skills in a federal
prison in Texas where he compulsively
worked on the prison’s Radio Shack T R S -
80 computer at U. S. taxpayers’ expense.
Once out of jail,Black put his new skills to
work to build an international system of
followers by offering a trans-local notion of
r a c e.
A common language of race
and white solidarity 
Consider this passage from an e-mail
sent to S t o r m f r o n t:
“I am a 20-year-old white American
with roots in North America dating back
300 years and then into Europe,
N o r m a n d y, Fr a n c e. Well anyways, I am
proud to here [hear] of an organization
for the advancement of whites.”
Racists like Black are basically using
the Internet to foster a notion of whiteness
that unites old world racial nationalisms
( i . e. in Europe and Scandinavia) with the
white diasporas of the New World (i.e.
United States, C a n a d a , South A f r i c a ,
Australia and New Zealand and parts of
South A m e r i c a ) . Despite the diversity of
racist groups in cy b e r s p a c e, they share a
common language of race and white
s o l i d a r i t y. Fi r s t l y, this notion of whiteness
promotes a racial lineage that is plotted
t h r o u g h ,and to a large extent sustained in
cy b e r s p a c e.The Internet is the technology
of globalization, i n t e r c o n n e c t i n g
permeable human cultures. Yet in the
racist Net-world, the Internet is used to
foster an ethos of racial separation.Wi t h
the goal of establishing “white fortresses”
in cy b e r s p a c e, these racists are forging

new connections between ultra right-wing
sites in North A m e r i c a , Western Europe
and Scandinavia at a considerable pace.
Ye t , it is still the American websites and
news groups that are the most
sophisticated and the most active.
The big question remains exactly how
many people are being drawn into racist
activism by the Net? Recently, A l e x
Curtis—self-proclaimed “Lone Wolf of
hate” from San Diego and producer of
the extremist magazine The Nationalist
O b s e r v e r—claimed to “reach 100s - 1000s
of the most radical racists in the world
each week.” However, it is dangerous to
o v e r-estimate the level of activity. Th e
number of white racists regularly involved
in the Internet globally is somewhere
between 5,000 and 10,000,divided into 10
to 20 clusters.Once again, it is impossible
to offer anything other than an educated
g u e s s. The number of “ h i t s ” on a web
p a g e, for example, need not indicate
“sympathetic inquiries,”rather they could
include opponents, monitoring agencies
and researchers. The key point is that
these relatively small numbers of people
can have a significant presence.
Not only are they using the Net for
r e c r u i t m e n t , but attempts are also being
made to combine cy b e r-activism with that
of the “real world.” For example, t h e
RaceLink web page offers a list of
activists’ contact details and locations
around the world.A d d i t i o n a l l y,The A r y a n
Dating Pa g e (now posted on S t o r m f r o n t)
offers a contact service for white
s u p r e m a c i s t s. While most of the profil e s
are A m e r i c a n , there are also personal ads
from a range of countries including Brazil,
C a n a d a ,H o l l a n d ,N o r w a y,Po r t u g a l ,U. K . ,
Slovakia and Australia as well as from
white South A f r i c a n s.
Lonely hearts in search 
of their own kind 
One of the interesting things about
scrolling through the personal ads is that
the faces that appear are nothing like the
archetypal image of “The Racist.”There
are very few skinheads with Nazi tattoos:
these white supremacist “lonely hearts,”
mostly in their twenties and thirties, l o o k
surprisingly prosaic. Take 36-year- o l d
C a t h y, who lives in the U. S. state of
P e n n s y l v a n i a , which is far from an ethnic
melting pot, but who is “desperate to
move to a WHITE area!” She appears
in the photograph in a rhinestone outfit
with glitzy earrings:“ The picture of me is
a little overdone,” she explained.“I had
photos done with the girls at the office …
I look like an Aryan Princess when I get
dressed up. But I am really the girl-next-
door type.” O r, 1 9 - y e a r-old Debbie from
New England,who wrote:“I am [a] young
white power woman who seeks someone
seriously devoted to the white power
m o v e m e n t .A person whose commitment
is undaunting. I would like to speak with
men who share the same values as I.”
The male ads provide an equally
unexpected set of portraits of white
s u p r e m a cy. Frank (see photo next page),
a 48-year-old divorced single parent from
Palo Alto California,writes:“Today I’m
a responsible parent and have my views
but don’t go out of my way to let it be
known unless confronted. I have tattoos,
and am down for the Aryan race.So hope
to hear from you fine ladies in the near
f u t u r e.” Here Frank presents himself as a
kind of white supremacist “new man.”
This is contrasted with John Botti’s ad, a
2 5 - y e a r-old from Los Altos who presents
himself as a preppy,“going places” k i n d -
o f - g u y.He wrote:“I am looking for some
who is as conservative and pretty as hell.
Equally as important is someone with a
quality education.” These are images of
fascism in the information age that bear
little resemblance to previous
i n c a r n a t i o n s.This was brought home very
powerfully by the image of Max, a 36-
y e a r-old Canadian,who described himself

little resemblance to previous
i n c a r n a t i o n s.This was brought home very
powerfully by the image of Max, a 36-
y e a r-old Canadian,who described himself
as a “long-time Movement activist.” He
listed his interests as anthropology, M o n t y
P y t h o n ’s humour, the Titanic story, C e l t i c
music and [U.S.] Civil War re-enacting.
Max chose to have his photograph taken
at his computer keyboard, where he
presents himself as the picture of
technological profic i e n cy.This struck me,
the first time I saw it, as a very appropriate
image of the face of today’s racism.
H o w e v e r, these postmodern portraits
of racism are coloured by fragmented and
multiple identities little suited to the
disciplined organization of “real world”
racist politics. In this mercurial world,c a n
the ideology and commitment to racism be
turned off as quickly as the computer?
There is some evidence to suggest that
Net-racists have a rather chaotic affil i a t i o n
to white power politics. For example,
American Milton J.K l e i m , who was once
the self-styled “Net Nazi Number 1,”
renounced his politics almost overnight.
Shifting from National
Socialism to misanthropy  
Kleim first became involved through
U s e n e t ,a network of online newsgroups,a s
a student in 1993. But he didn’t have a
face-to-face meeting with anyone in the
racist movement until he graduated in
1 9 9 5 .Less than a year later,he abandoned
racism altogether. In an e-mail interview he
c o m m e n t e d : “ The act of leaving was
p a i n f u l , and the aftermath stressful […] I
essentially became a ‘ n o n p e r s o n ,’ and I
h a v e n ’t really been denounced […] I only
received two or three harassing phone calls
from displeased movement adherents…
The saddest part is that my ‘ m o v e m e n t ’
experience was my most exciting, m o s t
rewarding time in my life,” he commented.
“ I ’ve moved from National Socialism to
M i s a n t h r o p y.”Racist culture offered Kleim
a sense of purpose through an online
identity and a temporary resolution to
existential crisis.This same sense of purpose
comes through in many interviews with
Net racists.What is equally true is that this
does not last and the virtual mask of racial
extremism can be quickly cast off.
Not only does individual commitment
appear shaky, but so do the larger
networks of Net-based racist groups. I n
the “real world,” each group generally
revolves around or owes its existence to a
charismatic leader who takes on the
initiative of forging alliances. Th e s e
a g r e e m e n t s,h o w e v e r, are generally short-
lived because of power struggles between
the various leaders. In cy b e r s p a c e, t h i s
fall-out seems to be occurring at an even
faster pace.B a s i c a l l y, the condensed rate
of exchange in cyberspace shortens the
fuse for an explosion. The vituperative
on-line feud between Harold A .
Covington of the National Socialist Wh i t e
P e o p l e ’s Party, William L. Pierce of the
National Alliance and both sets of their
supporters (in the U. S.) is perhaps the
best example of this syndrome.R e fle c t i n g
on “ The Future of the White Internet,”
Covington wrote:
“ The Net is being viciously and
tragically abused by a shockingly large
number of either bogus or deranged
‘White Racists’ […] I think it is too early
just yet to quantify just how the lunacy
interacts with, counteracts and affects the
impact of the serious political work.It is
like panning for gold in a flowing sewer;
both the raw and toxic sewage and the
gold are there, and the question is how
much gold any individual can extract
before the fumes and the corruption drive
him off—or until he keels over and falls
in and becomes part of the sewer system.”
The racist use of the Internet is not
about to deliver a mass global racist
m o v e m e n t . In this sense, the imitators of
fascism and Nazism are not in the same
league as the zealots of yesteryear. Ye t
the significance of this phenomenon
should not be sought in the numbers of
a c t i v i s t s. The fact that those involved
remain relatively small should not be read
as a comforting statistic. Wh a t , t h e n , i s
the nature of this threat? The real danger
is perhaps that in the information age
isolated acts of racist terrorism may
become commonplace. In this respect the
1999 London bombing campaign
conducted by David Copeland—who
found his “ r e c i p e ” for nail bombs on the
Net—may be an indication of the form
that racist violence will take in this
m i l l e n n i u m . These acts are perpetrated
by individuals whose prime contact with
racist politics is via their computer
k e y b o a r d s. ■
46 The Unesco Courier - January 2001
Blurring fantasy
and re a l i t y
The combination of intimacy and
distance in cyberspace provides a new
context for racist harassment. R a c i s t s
began by sending “mail bombs”or a truck-
load of junk mail to crash their victims’
computer systems. More recently they
started using digital tools to offer the
“pleasure”of simulated racial violence. For
example, a photograph of a young black
man, face down on the floor being beaten
and kicked, used to be posted on the
Skinheads USA website until a police
investigation. By blurring the line between
reality and fantasy, this kind of violence is
politically slippery but very dangerous.
Cyberculture has also given a new lease of
life to the “International Jew” as an
omnipresent figure of hate. The Internet’s
global framework enhances a historical
component of anti-Semitism: the notion of
an international conspiracy. Th e
“ t r a d i t i o n a l ” products of the racist
imagination are now circulating further
than ever before. ■

48 The Unesco Courier - January 2001
The stomach is part of the human soul.
The mouth is the gateway
from getting across.
The right to choose one’s own food
The perfect symbol of globalization is
the success of firms like McDonald’s,
which opens five new restaurants around
the world each day. For me there is
something more significant than the fall
of the Berlin Wa l l . It was the queue of
Russians outside McDonald’s on
M o s c o w ’s Red Square as the so-called
“iron curtain”—which turned out be
more like a “mashed potato curtain”—
was coming down.
The “ M c D o n a l d i z a t i o n ” of the world
is planting plastic food in the four corners
of the planet. But the success of
M c D o n a l d ’s has at the same time
i n flicted a kind of open wound on one of
the most basic human rights, the right
to choose our own food.The stomach is
part of the human soul.The mouth is its
g a t e w a y.Tell me what you eat and I’ll tell
you who you are. I t ’s not about how
much you eat but what and how you
choose to do so. How people prepare
food is an important part of their cultural
i d e n t i t y. It matters greatly to poor or
even very poor people,who have little or
no food but who respect traditions that
turn the trivial act of barely eating into a
small ritual.
Against standardization
The best side of the world is that it
contains many worlds within itself. S u c h
cultural diversity,which is the heritage of
all humanity, appears in the different
ways people eat, but also in how they
think,feel,dream,talk and dance.
Th e r e ’s a very marked trend towards
the standardization of cultural behaviour.
But there is also a backlash by people
who endorse differences that are worth
p r e s e r v i n g. Emphasizing cultural
d i f f e r e n c e s,not social ones, is what gives
humankind its many concurrent faces
instead of just a single one. In the face of
this avalanche of forced standardization,
there have been very healthy reactions
alongside the odd crazy ones springing
from religious fanaticism and other
desperate attempts to affirm identity. I
d o n ’t think we’re at all doomed to live in
a world where the only choice is between
dying of hunger or dying of boredom.
Identity on the move
Cultural identity isn’t like a precious
vase standing silently in a museum
s h o w c a s e. I t ’s always moving, c h a n g i n g
and being challenged by reality that is
itself in perpetual movement. I am what
I am, but I’m also what I do to change
what I am. Th e r e ’s no such thing as
cultural purity, any more than there is
racial purity.
L u c k i l y, every culture is made up of
some elements that come from afar.Wh a t
d e fines a cultural product—whether it
be a book, a song, a popular saying or a
way of playing football—is never where
it comes from but what it is. A typical
Cuban drink like a daiquiri has nothing
Cuban in it: the ice comes from
somewhere else, just like the lemon, t h e
sugar and the rum. C h r i s t o p h e r
Columbus first brought sugar to the
Americas from the Canary Islands. Ye t
the daiquiri is considered quintessentially
C u b a n .The churro fritters of A n d a l u s i a
originated in the Middle East. I t a l i a n
pasta first came from China.Nothing can
be defined or derided on the basis of its
o r i g i n . The important thing is what is
done with it and how far a community
i d e n t i fies with something that symbolizes
its favourite way of dreaming, l i v i n g,
d a n c i n g, playing or loving.
This is the positive side of the world:
a constant intermingling that produces
new responses to new challenges. B u t
because of forced globalization, t h e r e ’s a
clear trend these days towards uniformity.
This trend comes largely from the ever-
greater concentration of power in the
hands of large media groups.
Hope for the future : the Internet and
community radio
Is the right to freedom of expression,
which is written into every country’s
constitution, being reduced to nothing
more than the right to listen? Is it not
also the right to speak? And how many
people have the right to speak? These
questions are very closely connected
with the battering that cultural diversity
is currently suffering.
Opportunities for independent
activity in the world of communications
have been greatly reduced. Th e
dominant media groups are imposing
doctored and distorted news along with
a vision of the world that tends to
become accepted as the only one
p o s s i b l e. I t ’s like reducing a face that
has millions of eyes to the standard two.
What does seem promising is the
dawn of the Internet, one of those
paradoxes that keeps hope alive. I t
sprang from the need to coordinate
global military strategy—in other words,
to serve the cause of war and death. B u t
it is now the forum for a myriad of voices
that were barely noticed before. Today
they are heard and networks can be
created using this new tool.
I t ’s true that the Internet can also
be used towards commercial ends or to
manipulate people. But the network has
definitely opened up very important
areas of freedom for expressing
independent views, which tend to be
ignored by television and the print
media.
Good things are happening in radio
t o o. The growth of community radio
stations in Latin America is encouraging
a much wider spectrum of people to
express themselves. Talking to people
about what is happening is not the same
thing as listening to their own voices
recounting their lives,when this is possible
and when freedom of expression is
r e s p e c t e d .

Many indigenous people burnt alive for
idolatry were simply enviro n m e n t a l i s t s
in recent years and in some cases
d e s t r o y e d . Ours is a world focused on
s e l fis h n e s s, on a belief in “ e v e r y o n e
looking out for their own self.”
People and land
Five centuries ago, people in Latin
America were taught to separate nature
from Man—or so-called Man—which in
fact meant men and women.Nature was
placed on one side, human beings on the
other. The same divorce took place the
world over.
Many of the indigenous people
burned alive for worshipping idols were
simply the environmentalists of their time
who were practising the only kind of
ecology that seems worthwhile to me—
an ecology of communion with nature.
Harmony with nature and a communal
approach to life ensured the survival of
ancient indigenous values despite fiv e
centuries of persecution and contempt.
For centuries, nature was seen as a
beast that had to be tamed—as a foreign
enemy and a traitor. Now that we’re all
“ g r e e n s,” thanks to deceitful advertising
based on words rather than deeds, n a t u r e
has become something to be protected.
But whether nature is to be protected or
mastered and exploited for profit , i t ’s
still seen as separate from us.
We have to recover this sense of
communion with nature. Nature is not a
l a n d s c a p e, i t ’s something inside us,
something we live with. I’m not just
talking about forests, but about
everything to do with the reverence for
the natural that the indigenous people of
the Americas have and always have had.
They see nature as sacred in the sense
that every harm we cause turns against us
one day or another. So every crime
becomes a suicide.This can be seen in the
large cities of Latin America,which are
bad copies of those in the developed
world where it’s just about impossible to
walk or breathe clean air. . We ’re living in
a world whose air, water and soil are
p o i s o n e d . But most of all, our minds are
p o i s o n e d . I truly wish that we could
manage to summon up enough energy to
heal ourselves.

T A L K I N G  T O  . . . ◗
Even when he is compiling painstakingly
detailed accounts of social discontent, t h e
pleasure Eduardo Galeano takes in telling his
story is palpable. The Open Veins of Latin
A m e r i c a (1971) is a point of reference for
anyone who wishes to understand the past
and present of Latin America.It starts with a
p u z z l e : w h y, he asks, has this continent so
abundantly blessed by Mother Nature had
such an unfortunate social and political history?
The book,as gripping as a police thriller, tells
with passion, lucidity and indignation the
history of what he describes as the looting of
Latin America, first by the Spaniards and the
Portuguese, and then by the rest of the West
and the ruling classes of the countries
themselves.
Galeano fearlessly breaks through divisions
between literary genres. His books, in which
narrative and essays, poetry and reportage all
m i n g l e, assemble voices from people’s souls
and the streets to form a compound of reality
and reminiscence.
Galeano was born in Montevideo, U r u g u a y,
60 years ago.There he became editor-in-chief
of the weekly magazine M a r c h a and the
newspaper É p o c a. In Buenos A i r e s, he founded
and ran the magazine C r i s i s. He went into
exile in Argentina and Spain in 1973 and
returned to Uruguay in early 1985.His books
have been translated into various languages
and his journalistic output has also been
p r o l i fic . As well as The Open Veins of Latin
America, he has published:
Memory of Fire trilogy (Genesis, 1982; Faces
and Masks, 1984; Century of the Wind, 1986)
The Book of Embraces (1989)
Walking Words (1993)
Soccer in Sun and Shadow (1995)
Upside Down: a Primer for the Looking Glass
World (1998)
We Say No (1989),a collection of articles and
essays
Galeano received the Casa de las A m é r i c a s
book award in 1975 and 1978. His Memory of
F i r e trilogy won the American Book A wa r d
from the University of Washington  and was
honoured by Uruguay’s Ministry of Culture in
1989. ■
magic world of newspaper offic e s, w h o
can pull you out again? You are taught
how to be brief, to summarize—an
interesting exercise for someone who
wants to write about so many things.
Yo u ’re also forced to come out of your
little world to face reality and dance to the
tune of others. You have to get out and
listen to people. But there’s a downside,
mainly the urgency.Sometimes when I’m
writing I get stuck on a word and spend
three hours looking for another. Th a t ’s
one luxury journalism couldn’t afford to
give me.
Dreams and vigilance
My only task is to try to reveal a
masked reality, to write about what we
see and what remains hidden. It is a
reality that comes from being on watch,
a false reality, sometimes a deceptive
o n e, but also one capable of telling
unknown or rarely heard truths.
Th e r e ’s no magic formula for changing
January 2001 - The Unesco Courier 51
G A L E A N O : THE JOY OF STO RY T E L L I N G
reality unless we start by looking at it as it
i s. To transform it, you have to begin by
accepting it.This is the problem in Latin
A m e r i c a .We still cannot see that.We are
blind towards our own selves because we
have been trained to see through the eyes
of others. The mirror only reflects an
opaque glint, and nothing more.
And football...
All Uruguayans are born shouting
“ g o a l ”and that’s why there’s always such
a tremendous racket in our maternity
wards. I wanted to be a football player
like all Uruguayan boys. I started playing
when I was eight years old but I was no
good at it because I was so clumsy. The
ball and I never got along. It was a case
of unrequited love. I was also a disaster
in another way.When an opposing team
played a good game, I ’d go and
congratulate them—an unforgivable sin
in the rules of modern football. ■
INTERVIEW BY NIELS BOEL
Memory as a catapult
In my book D ays and Nights of Lov e
and Wa r, I ’ve asked myself whether our
memories will allow us to be happy. I still
have no answer.Th e r e ’s a North A m e r i c a n
novel in which a great-grandfather meets
his great-grandson. The old man
remembers nothing because he’s lost his
m e m o r y. H e ’s senile. His thoughts are as
colourless as water.The grandson doesn’t
have any memories because he’s too
y o u n g. As I read the novel, I thought:
“ This is bliss.”
But this is not the happiness I’m after.
I want happiness that comes from both
remembering and from fighting against
r e m e m b e r i n g.A happiness that includes
the sadness,pain and injury of experience
but also goes forward. Not memory that
works like an anchor,but like a catapult.
Not a memory that you just arrive at,b u t
one that’s a launch pad.
Th e r e ’s an American indigenous
tradition found in the islands of the
P a c i fic, in Canada and also places like
C h i a p a s, in Mexico. It goes like this:w h e n
a master potter gives up his trade because
his hands are no longer steady and his
eyesight is failing, t h e r e ’s a ceremony at
which he presents his best pot, h i s
m a s t e r p i e c e,to a young potter just starting
o u t .The apprentice takes the flawless pot
and smashes it into a thousand pieces on
the ground. He then picks them up and
mixes them into his own stock of clay.
Th a t ’s the kind of memory I believe in.
Self-portrait
I find it hard to categorize any of the
books I’ve written.It’s difficult to draw
the line between fiction and fact.What I
like best is telling stories. I feel I’m a
s t o r y t e l l e r. I give and take, back and
f o r t h . I listen to voices and transform
them through the creative act into a
story, an essay, a poem,a novel.I try to
combine genres to go beyond the
standard divisions and convey a
complete message because I believe you
can create such a synthesis with human
language.
Th e r e ’s no divide between journalism
and literature. Literature is the totality of
written messages that a society produces
in whichever form it chooses. You can
always say what you feel like saying,
whether as a journalist or a writer. G o o d
journalism can also be fine literature as
José Marti, Carlos Quijano, R o d o l f o
Walsh and many others have shown.
I ’ve always been a journalist and want
to continue because once you enter the
