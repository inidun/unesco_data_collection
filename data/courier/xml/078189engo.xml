A UNESCO
Tremendous strides by press,
films, radio and television have
given 20th-century man a ring¬
side seat on daily events in his
world. Yet the basic right to
know what is going on in the
world around them is still
witheld from to two thousand
million people. A worldwide
enquiry by Unesco shows that
this right can only be made a
reality through a vast program¬
me of development in the infor¬
mation media which Unesco has
proposed for the next 15 years.
WORLD
ENQUIRY
by Mary Burnet
A little more than 13 years ago, In December
1948, the United Nations adopted the Universal
Declaration of Human Rights, which affirmed, among
others, the right of everyone "to seek, receive and impart
Information and ideas through any media and
regardless of frontiers." About the same time, Unesco
launched a survey of information facilities, first in war-
devastated countries and later throughout the world.
This survey provided the first global picture of the state
of the information media the press, radio, film and
television. It confirmed what was already known in a
general way: that about two-thirds of the people in the
world were unable to keep up with events because they
lacked the material means of doing so. Where informa¬
tion was concerned, the majority of the human race were
like a big family whose right to eat has been recognized
but who are unable to get enough food.
We have come a long way since then. In countries
devastated by World War II, information facilities have
been restored. The rapid development of many other
countries has brought them increases in the means of
information along with a general rise in the standard of
living.. In African villages where a few years ago nobody
could read or write, newspapers are now being sold. Over
roads deep in mud or thick with dust, trucks carry film
projectors into Isolated districts and, after nightfall, set
them up in the open air or under the thatched roof of a
meeting hut, where the light of a kerosene lamp, flickers
over the faces of an eager audience. In more than 100
languages and dialects in India alone, the radio beams
advice to farmers and housewives along with news and

100 MILLION TV RECEIVERS are now in use around
the world. The Japanese who pioneered the midget
transistor radio receiver are now applying the same skill
to television. Portable receivers, shown in production
here at a Japanese factory, will run either from a mains
supply or a re-chargeable battery. A "pocket" TV
receiver has also been designed and has been put on sale.
ACCESS TO NEWS (Cont'd)
A vital minimum for all by 1975
entertainment. In 1948 only four countries in the world
had television stations; now regular programmes are being
broadcast in 65, and the number of television receivers has
increased from four million to 100 million.
In spite of all these encouraging signs, however, we still
have a great deal further to go if we are to bring to
everybody, and not just a large and fortunate minority,
adequate means of being informed.
What are adequate means? Unesco has tried to set
some standard. It concluded that any group of people
should be considered to enjoy the "vital minimum" of
information facilities if, for every 100 persons it had the
following:
Ten copies of dally newspapers;
Five radio receivers;
Two cinema seats;
Two television receivers.
Despite all the progress made since the Human Rights
Declaration was signed, the majority of the world's
population still do not have access to this vital minimum.
At the same time, greater efforts than ever before are
being exerted to make the right to information a reality.
As might be expected, the countries most lacking in
information facilities are those where the standard of
living is lowest, and most of them lie in the world's three
great underdeveloped regions Asia, Africa and Latin
America. But almost without exception these countries
are well aware of their handicaps, and trying hard to
improve their situation.
Convinced of the vital link between information and
general economic development, the UN, three years ago
asked Unesco to make a special study of information
facilities in underdeveloped regions and to suggest how
they might be improved.
Unesco organized a series of meetings, each focused on
the problems of the information media in one of the three
great underdeveloped regions of the world. These
meetings brought together representatives of the press,
radio, film and television, in Asia, Africa and Latin
America, plus specialists from outside these regions, as
well as observers from various inter-governmental and
non-governmental organizations.
From these meetings, held over a period of two years,
there has emerged a far more revealing image of reality
than mere statistics could reflect. The pioneers working
in the information media and for most of them, pioneers
is not too strong a word knew not only what they lacked,
but why. They had pretty clear ideas of what they needed
and many suggestions as to how to get it. Along with
the outside experts at the meetings, they outlined the
steps to be taken if information enterprises in their
countries are to be given the initial assistance they need
in order to embark on a period of healthy growth.
Unesco then worked out an overall plan which was
presented by Mr. Tor Gjesdal, Director of the Dept. of
Mass Communication, to the Human Rights Commission

DISTANCE IS NO BARRIER to radio and neither Is
Illiteracy. Radio has grown more rapidly In underdeve¬
loped regions than any other of the mass media. Here
New Guinea villagers tune In to news and educational
broadcasts. Recent development of a $5 transistor
receiver should bring radio to millions more people.
in April shortly after the UN General Assembly had offi¬
cially proclaimed the 1960's as the UN Development
Decade. The aim of the plan Is nothing less than to bring
the whole world up to the Unesco target of a minimum
standard of information facilities by 1975.
If this plan is carried out, the progress made in the past
13 years, however creditable, will be as nothing to the
giant strides to be made in the coming thirteen. Informa¬
tion facilities in the world as a whole will be not increased,
but multiplied. For the first time in history, virtually
everyone on our planet will have at his disposal the
means of keeping informed. Not all the means that might
be desirable, perhaps, but enough to keep him in touch
with events at home and abroad and thus give him a
chance to play as enlightened a role as possible in the life
of his community and nation.
How will the job be done?
The easiest and cheapest way of getting information to
masses of people nowadays is the radio, modern successor
to the signal fire and the jungle drum. Distance is no
barrier to broadcasting, nor is lack of roads or airfields.
Equally important to the underdeveloped regions is the
fact that illiteracy presents no barrier either. A man who
could not read a newspaper if he had one can understand
the news bulletins he hears over the radio. All these
circumstances are reflected in the fact that since 1948
radio has made more gains in underdeveloped regions
than any other medium.
There does, however, exist one barrier to the further
expansion of radio: the price of receivers. Often those
people most in need of radio for Information purposes are
unable to pay for even a simple receiving set.
Already many developing countries have tried to help
these people. In areas without electricity, receivers have
been set up In village squares. They might be run by
batteries or with a generator powered by petrol or even
pedaled by foot. To the villagers loudspeakers have

TV IN THE SCHOOL
& A SCHOOL FOR TV
Television as a classroom aid has
developed individual forms according to
the needs of different countries. Left,
young workers in a Naples factory are
given time off daily to follow special
televised courses designed for young
people who only completed primary
schooling. Television, despite the
giant strides it has taken, is still a deve¬
loping medium and itself needs schools
and experimental centres. Right, in
Lima, Peru, future TV technicians and
producers now receive a two-year com¬
prehensive training course whose pro¬
gramme includes construction of
receiving sets, programme production,
camera work and lighting techniques.

ACCESS TO NEWS (Confd)
The trials of the struggling
backwoods newspaper
furnished news and entertainment, just as bards and
minstrels have done for ages past.
But such group listening is obviously limited by the
number of sets and operators available, and it does not
reach really Isolated people. So several years ago, the
International Telecommunication Union (ITU) at
Unesco's suggestion, began working on specifications for
cheap but efficient and durable receivers a problem
which the introduction of transistors had already
simplified. The sets now being designed by the ITU can
be produced for $5 If ordered in sufficient quantity.
This is not a prohibitive price even to those and in
certain areas the case is not rare who have incomes
as low as $300 or even $100 a year.
So in its plan Unesco has given highest priority to the
development of radio. Of course there are other problems
to be solved besides that of cheap receivers. Broadcasting
in the tropics, where many of the underdeveloped
countries are located, is beset by technical difficulties
greater than those encountered in temperate climates.
But with progress in electronics these difficulties can now
be solved. There is also a much more serious human
problem: the lack of technicians, operators and mainte¬
nance men, of good radio journalists and programme
material, including a sufficient supply of news. This
shortage of trained personnel and news sources is shared
by all the Information media, and the provision of training
opportunities in all media is one of the questions to
which most attention was given when Unesco's report
was drawn up.
Despite the convenience of radio, the basic and perma¬
nent medium of information remains the written word.
A radio bulletin must be listened to when it is broadcast,
but a newspaper can be read and pondered at leisure.
Furthermore, newspapers, like radio, in a developing
country can be not only a means of information and
entertainment but a very valuable educational aid.
Most developing countries have a large proportion of
illiterates and are making great efforts to teach them to
read. Once they have learned to read, however, materials
for further practice are often scarce. If its style is well
adapted to its audience, a newspaper can do a lot to keep
up reading skills.
Newspapers In the countries covered by the
Unesco report are generally scarce, and the
ones that do exist range from complete, sophisticated
dallies printed in large cities to the one-page sheet that
appears on market day in some backwoods town. The
modest one-pager may be printed on an antiquated press
with type so worn as to be barely legible, by an editor-
publisher-reporter, making a valiant effort to keep his
readers abreast of local news and also to arouse their
Interest in more general issues.
At the Unesco meetings, colourful stories were told of
the difficulties these struggling newspapers run into. For
the smallest, merely keeping their obsolete presses running
often requires feats of ingenuity. If spare parts are
needed they must usually be imported, at high cost and
with long delays, and possibly with customs' duties added
to the price. Paper must also, as a rule, be imported, and
the prevailing system of newsprint distribution works to
the detriment of the small enterprise. Newsprint can be
bought at mill prices only in large quantities and under
long-term contract. Small publishers, with their uncer¬
tain future and modest means, cannot place orders of
this kind. So they must buy their paper on the spot
market, where they will pay up to 300 per cent more than
is paid by their larger and wealthier counterparts.
8 Except for strictly local items, they also have trouble
getting news. For many it is out of the question to
subscribe to a news agency, and communications facilities
may be so scanty that they could not take advantage of
an agency's services even if they could pay for them. So
they must depend on radio news bulletins and whatever
feature materialpreferably freethat can reach them
by air mail.
One may wonder what keeps them going. Yet the
newspaper representatives at the three Unesco meetings
were among the most enthusiastic of participants.
Obviously they have great faith in the usefulness of what
they are doinga faith that is probably increased by the
knowledge that their papers are not discarded after a
hasty glance at the headlines but passed from reader to
reader until they have become tattered and torn. They
also know that, as literacy spreads, they will have a more
and more important role to play.
So in Unesco's report a high priority is also given to
newspaper development, and a series of measures, many
suggested by the newspaper men themselves, are recom¬
mended for reducing their handicaps and encouraging
others to follow in their path.
B y a happy paradox, recent technical advances
may put these small newspapers in a relati¬
vely more advantageous position than many better-
established ones where production is concerned. New
processes, including offset and photo-composition, make
it possible to produce attractively printed small news¬
papers, of limited circulation, with a small outlay for
equipment and with operators Who do not need to be
highly trained. Clear reproduction of photographs and
drawings is now possible at a cost that would have been
unthinkably low a few years ago. This is important,
since good illustration can do much to attract newly-
literate readers and help them understand what they
read.
As for that great bugbear, newsprint, the UN Food and
Agriculture Organization (FAO) has been working for the
past ten years on the problem of increasing the world
newsprint supply. Largely as a result of FAO's research,
newsprint can now be made from a variety of materials
never before used for the purpose such as bamboo, rice
straw and bagasse (sugar-cane residue). Many of these
materials are produced in the tropics.
The manufacture of newsprint, however, Is by nature a
large-scale operation. So the current problem is to find
steady markets big enough to make the establishment of
new paper mills economically feasible, possibly on a region¬
al basis. A pooling of orders by small enterprises, backed
by careful estimates of needs, could do much to reduce
the price of imported newsprint in the immediate future
and to bring nearer the day when local mills can be. estab¬
lished to provide the paper now shipped at high cost
from abroad.
There remains the problem of getting the
news a problem Which newspapers share
with broadcasting stations. To cater to both, news
agencies are needed. The number of these is growing
fast there are now 21 agencies in Africa, for instance,
as compared with two in 1948but most of them as
yet can provide only limited services, and more than
one valiant little agency still has to deliver mimeograph¬
ed news bulletins to its subscribers by bicycle. Further¬
more, throughout large parts of Asia, Africa and Latin
America, there are not enough telegraph or radio links
to provide adequately for collecting and distributing
news.

HARD LABOUR AND CULINARY CHORES
Physical resistance and patience were two
essential qualities required by the early
photographer-reporters. Right, an 1874
engraving showing the "portable" equip¬
ment needed by the photographer on the
move. Progress since then can best be
measured by reading the "recipe" for pre¬
paring an emulsion to cover the photogra¬
phic plate given in 1864 by the English
chemist, Sir J. W. Swan. "Take 4 ounces
of gelatine and leave it to swell in 30 cubic
inches of cold water for several hours.
Then dissolve it over a gentle heat. Now
add the beaten white of an egg, shake the
mixture and bring it to the boil, afterwards
filtering it. Now add two ounces of white
sugar and mix with Indian ink..."
As early as the 1850's photographers
were recording public ceremonies
and other events, but the first great
historic happening to be "covered"
in the current sense by photogra¬
phers was the Crimean War. The
first of these was the British photo¬
grapher, Roger Fenton, who arrived
at Balaclava in March 1855 with two
assistants, a photographic van and
an immense quantity of equipment.
Under difficult conditionsseveral
times his van was shelled by the

troops and their leaders and their

ACCESS TO NEWS (Cont'd)
World TV
via satellite
relays
News agencies and telecommunications are subjects
which the layman rarely stops to think about, but they
are of fundamental concern to professionals in the field.
They provide the basic means through which all of us
in Helsinki, Rangoon, Chicago or Tananarive get our
news. Whether we get it promptly or late, in plenty or in
snatches depends largely on how efficient news agencies
are and how well telegraph and telephone, cable and
wireless services function.
Years ago Unesco approached the ITU for help on the
problem of Improving information facilities. The ITU
provides expert advice to countries wishing to improve
their telecommunication networks and has already com¬
pleted plans for such networks in Asia and Latin America
in co-operation with UN and regional organizations. In
all such plans the ITU is now trying to make adequate
allowance for the expanding needs of the press and other
information media.
At the regional meetings on information problems con¬
vened by Unesco, special emphasis was laid on the need
for establishing or expanding news agencies. This need
was acutely felt by participants in all the meetings, and,
at all three, recommendations were made for fostering the
development of national news agencies and encouraging
co-operation both among them and with the great world
agencies which are the main source of International news.
Since then, at another meeting convened by Unesco at
their request, directors of national news agencies in Asia
have formed a regional association, the Organization of
Asian News Agencies, to increase the exchange of news
between them and with the rest of the world.

TOMORROW'S NEEDS IN NEWSPRINT
In many African countries today the average annual con¬
sumption of newsprint per person is only a few ounces (in
the U.S.A. it is 80 lbs). With the decrease in illiteracy,
however, tomorrow's needs in newsprint will increase consi¬
derably and world demand is expected to triple in the next
15 years. As present sources of production will be unable
to meet this rising demand and as the costly process of
importing newsprint is already a barrier to press expansion
in the less economically developed countries, efforts are now
being made to develop the manufacture of newsprint on a
regional basis, using fibrous materials found in the tropics.

eofle go to the cinema for entertainment. If
they see a newsreel or a documentary they
are receiving information as well. But so far, the role
of the film as a medium of information has been over¬
shadowed by its entertainment value, as the newsreel
Is overshadowed by the feature film. Yet this infor¬
mational role is already considerable and could be
developed much further, as is fully realized in the
developing countries of .the world. In Its report to the
UN, Unesco made recommendations for increasing the
number of documentary films produced in these countries
and Improving . their quality, and also for distributing
them in the broadest and most effective way.
There are plenty of commercial cinemas in the big cities
of Latin America, Asia and Africa, and one Asian coun¬
try which in many ways still considers itself under¬
developed India is the world's second largest producer
of feature films. (Japan is the largest and the United
States of America third.)
But the production of features is confined to a very few
countries, and these cinemas live and thrive by showing
Imported European, American or Asian films. Some of the
films are so ancient that, as one observer put it, "you
wonder how the prints can still be in existence." The
double feature is common practice, so that there is little
room on the programme for newsreels or documentaries.
But, cinematographically speaking, the back country is
a desert. It is into this desert that mobile projection units
have been making their forays within the past few years,
armed with documentaries or sometimes just educational
film strips. There is a fine art to presenting this material
as well as to making it; people who have never seen
images on a screen before cannot be approached in the
same way as city audiences.
So there is a need for all types of informational films,
from the simplest to the fairly sophisticated. While their
most important users will probably be mobile units,
schools, and community centres, Unesco has suggested,
that the showing of such films by commercial cinemas
be encouraged in the developing countries. Nor, the
Unesco report reminds us, should producers overlook the
future demand for films by the newest of all the informa¬
tion media television.
In the 13 years since the Declaration of Human Rights
was signed, television has grown from infancy to what
many people would call a turbulent adolescence whose
promises and problems are a matter for anxious concern.
So far, two factors have worked to hamper the spread of
television in the underdeveloped countries: technical limi¬
tations and expense.
But one by one the technical limitations are dropping
away. At a time when experiments are being made on the
use of communications satellites as relay stations, we may
envisage the physical possibility of providing television
broadcasts to any spot on the globe. The introduction
of transistor receivers will permit T.V. programmes to
be watched in regions devoid of electric power. There
remains the barrier of expense, but it ls not Impossible
that further technical advances may considerably reduce
costs.
One thing is certain: in regions now underdeveloped,
television will spread like a forest fire. So it is not too
soon, the Unesco report warns, to lay plans for making
the best use of it. Technical problems, like allocation
of wavelengths, and problems of policy, like how to ensure
sufficient emphasis on informational and educational
programmes, had best come under study now.
From the discussions in Bangkok, Santiago and Paris
(where the meeting of African specialists was held), it
was clear that the needs of the information media in
underdeveloped countries were essentially two: financial
means and human skills. Money may be hard to come

by, but it can be borrowed. Know-how cannot be provided
overnight ; it must be developed gradually.
Translated into concrete terms, this means that the
greatest problem of the press, the radio and the film in
three continents is for more trained workers in every
branch of their activity. Master printers, cameramen,
radio technicians, newspaper reporters are needed; so are
accountants, layout men, programme directors and film
editors.
In most of the numerous fields in which specialists are
required, opportunities for systematic training in the
underdeveloped regions themselves are now scanty or
non-existent. The Unesco survey looks forward to the
time when they can be provided on the spot or rather,
at centres serving one country or a group of countries.
Meanwhile, it suggests, the present shortage
could be alleviated by providing scholarships
in more advanced countries for promising trainees. (This
is already being done to some extent by various public
and private agencies, but the number of openings provid¬
ed must be multiplied.)
Furthermore, as the delegates to the Unesco meetings
were the first to point out, a great deal could be accom¬
plished through exchanges of personnel among news¬
papers and news agency bureaux, radio stations and film
units in the underdeveloped countries themselves. In
some of these countries the information media have
already made considerable progress and are thus in a
position to give valuable on-the-job training to colleagues
from neighbouring countries which are still in the pioneer
stage.
Such exchanges are only one of many forms of co¬
operation proposed by participants in the three Unesco
meetings. Never before had representatives of the mass
media in either Asia or Africa or Latin America been able
to get together to discuss their common problems, and
they were determined to make the most of the oppor¬
tunity to do so. They fully realized that they needed
outside help, but they were aware, too, that much could
be accomplished through their own collective clTorts.
Finally, they were deeply concerned not only with safe¬
guarding the freedom of the various Information media
but with encouraging a corresponding sense of responsi¬
bility. In the areas which they serve, this responsibility
Involves not only the usual basic requirements of accu¬
racy and objectivity, but a further special obligation to
contribute to the education of their audiences as well as
to keep them in touch with what is going on.
To carry out the programme Unesco has calculated that
a sum of about Ç3.400 million will be needed. This sounds
like a tremendous investment, but it becomes less formi¬
dable when one realizes that most of it would be shared
among the national budgets of the some 100 countries
in need of development of their information media. A
portion would also be made available through the kind of
bilateral co-operation programmes which have already
shown themselves an effective form of aid from advanced
countries to developing ones. Some capital may be
expected to be raised in the form of long-term, low-inte¬
rest loans from various International financing agencies
and through private investments from local sources.
The success of the programme will depend mainly on
the developing countries themselves, on their determina¬
tion to find the resources and skills needed. Unesco is
encouraged by the fact that the regional economic com¬
missions of the UN in Asia, Africa and Latin America
have all endorsed the plan. So has the UN Economic and
Social Council. There is hope that during the decade 11
ahead, for many millions of people the right to informa¬
tion may become a reality.

GLOBAL FACTS & FIGURES
RADIO
IN the last 13 years, radio and T.V. have made giant strides. The number of
radio transmitters rose from 5,450 to 11,670 and receivers from 161 million
to 366.5 million. Despite world population growth, the number of receivers per
100 persons rose from 7 to 13.
In Africa, radio transmitters increased from 119 to 368 and receivers from
930,000 to 5.5 million. However, owing to the growth in population, the number
of sets per 100 people rose from 0.5 to 2.3 only.
Asia has tripled its broadcasting and receiving facilities and now has 1,100
transmitters compared to 398 In 1948. Receivers rose from 10 million to 31 mil¬

to 1.9 the lowest level of all continents. South America, Oceania, U.S.S.R.,
Europe and North America have respectively 10.2, 17.9, 19, 21.3 and 69 radio
receivers per 100 persons.
I Population growth and increased prosperity are expected
to boost the demand for press, radio, film and television
facilities in the developing countries more than threefold
by 1975. A Unesco estimate, covering all media, forsees
the following increases (on the basis of 100 in 1955) :
Africa 338; Latin America (excluding Argentina) 341; Near
and Middle East, 384 ; Far East (excluding Japan and
mainland China) 382.
In some African and South American countries, the cost
of an annual subscription to a daily paper is as high as 28
per cent of average per capita income, compared with less
than one per cent in the U.S.A.

The first communication satellite
serving the mass media is expected
to be launched this month. An
initial exchange of television pro¬
grammes between the U.S.A. and
Europe will 'be conducted through
the satellite Telstar, orbiting the
globe in 2 hours 40 minutes. The
American programmes will be picked
up by a British Post Office station
in Cornwall and then piped into
the Eurovision network, in which
television systems of the major
Western European countries par¬
ticipate.
Charges for sending press
messages over similar distances may
vary by as much as 300 per cent
in Latin America, 600 per cent in
Africa and 700 per cent in Asia.
This is due largely to inadequate and
costly cable and radio services
which sometimes double the cost of
PRESS
sending a message in one direction
as compared with the reverse.
| Lack of telecommunication
services often force routing of
messages sent between two points in
tropical Africa through London or
Paris, instead of being sent direct.
For example, it is easier to tele¬
phone to Paris from Abidjan, Lomé
or Cotonou than to telephone from
these West African capitals to Lagos
(Nigeria), and vice versa. A cable
from Conakry reaches Accra more
quickly via Paris.
In Asia, telegraph services are
often beaten by the airmail and the
number of telephones in proportion
to population (0.1 for every 100
persons) is one of the lowest in the
world. Present development plans
should provide at least one telephone
within a radius of ten miles in all
South East Asian countries.

Although the press has lost ground in North America and Europe, It
has scored gains in the U.S.S.R., South America, Asia and Africa,
since 1948.
The world total of daily newspapers rose from 6,120 to 7,660. Total
circulation, while increasing from 219 to 288 million barely kept pace with
the growth in world population. ' The number of copies of dailies per
100 persons increased only slightly from 9.3 to 9.7.
In Africa, the press registered a notable advance and the number of
dailies rose from 171 to 262, and circulation from 1.9 to 3 million. How¬
ever, the number of copies of daily papers per 100 people remained almost
unchanged: 1.3 in 1960 as against 1 In 1948.
In Asia and South America, increases per 100 people were from 2.2 to
3.8 and from 6.9 to 8.1 respectively.

m¡ Geography and politics can make or
mar the development of one means of
communication as compared to another.
Reporting to the UN Economic Commission
for Asia and the Far East (ECAFE),
experts on telecommunication development
point out that "if a country is flat and there
is little trouble from rebels, aerial lines or
cables would be suitable. If, on the other
hand, the country is undulating or there is
danger of civil disturbances, microwave or
VHF radio links would be satisfactory."
IB Japan, which has the most highly
developed mass media in Asia, claims 77
per cent of the total daily newspaper circula¬
tion, 73 per cent of all radio sets, 40
per cent of all cinema seats and 97 per cent
of all television sets in the region of South
and East Asia. Fifty-five per cent of all
Japanese families now have television.

Meanwhile, lapan is building a giant tele¬

around the world through U.S. communic¬
ation satellites.
News agencies are developing more
rapidly in Africa than in any other part of
the world. Over 20 African countries now
have national news agencies, compared with
three countries five years ago.
In many tropical countries, short-wave
broadcasting is widely used for local services.
Short-wave broadcasts in the tropics are,
however, severely affected by solar inter¬
ference from October to April. To solve
this problem, telecommunication experts
urge the introduction of frequency modul¬
ation broadcasting, combined with medium-
wave "booster" services.
Among the islands of the South Pacific,
radio services are more widely developed
than the press and have become the main
source of news and other information.
Scattered over a vast ocean area, and with
small populations, the island groups face
formidable obstacles of transport and finance
in developing their press and cinema facilities.

Radio has overcome physical barriers, as
well as illiteracy itself, in Colombia, where
a private educational radio service has in
ten years become the most powerful network
in the country. Over 170,000 village listen¬

5 a.m. and late afternoon, when farmers
can most easily spare time from their work.
Similar programmes, known as farm forums,
are also being conducted in India and Japan.

The first journalists' association, the News¬

1836. Today several million mass media
professionals throughout the world arc
grouped in over 1,200 organizations, which
play a powerful role in promoting freedom
of information, improving professional train¬
ing and raising professional standards.
A pioneer in the development of the French
cinema, the Société des Auteurs et Composi¬
teurs Dramatiques (Paris) is the oldest pro¬

field. It was founded in 1777 by Carón de

Cinemas have increased In num¬
ber from 95,000 to 167,000
since 1948 and total annual atten¬
dances rose from 11,691 million to
15,000 million. Annual attendance
per person remained at 5, owing to
the growth in world population.
The U.S.S.R. registered the larg¬
est gains in the cinema field,
Increasing its cinemas and projec¬
tors from 15,200 to 59,000 and Its
annual attendance from 600 million
to 3,520 million. The level of at¬
tendance per person Increased
fivefold 3 to 16.4.
In Africa, cinemas Increased
from 1,335 to 2,300 and annual
attendance from 121.5 million to
250 million. Annual attendance
rate per person, although increas¬
ing from 0.6 to 1, still remains the
lowest of any continent. Asia now
has 15,900 cinemas as compared
to 6,800. There was a parallel rise
in annual cinema attendance from
1,140 million to 3,365 million
and in per capita attendance
0.9 to 2.1.
In Europe and Oceania total
annual attendance declined, but
most ground was lost In North
America, under the Impact made
by television some 9,000 cinemas
closed down and annual atten¬
dance per person fell from 24.2
to 10.7.
South America had a slight in¬
crease in cinemas and per capita
attendance (from 3.5 to 4).
Cultural and artistic subjects arc more
favoured as feature stories by Asian news¬
papers than by Western ones, says Mr. A.M.A.
Azam, editor of the Associated Press of
Pakistan, in a report to Unesco. This pre¬
ference has not so far been satisfied by
agencies serving the Asian press. "A 1,000
word feature on a Hollywood star's wedding
or divorce", he observes, "is not esteemed
as a cultural or social subject in the
Orient."
Television preferences among African
viewers arc noted in a Unesco report, "Mass
Media in the Developing Countries". "In
Nigeria," the report says, "news broadcasts
and programmes of African music and dances
are far more popular than the imported
serials favoured in Western countries."
News broadcasts also figure prominently in
Middle Eastern radio programmes.
"Pisin Niuspepa Bilong Ol Man" (Pidgin

A SCIENTIST LOOKS
AT POPULARIZATION
by Pierre Auger
The principle of the
gyroscope, whether
made as a toy or for
special scientific uses,
(at perhaps 20,000
times the cost), is
exactly the same.
That is why this re¬
search engineer can
still sometimes make
use of the toy ver¬
sion, spinning on his
fingertip, which was
once used as a play¬
thing by his daughter.

The notion that "science" is something
that belongs in a separate compartment of
its own, apart from everyday life, is one
that I should like to challenge. We live in
a scientific age ; yet we assume that know¬
ledge of science is the prerogative of only
a small number of human beings, isolated
and priestlike in their laboratories. This
is not true. The materials of science are
the materials of life itself. Science is part
of the reality of living ; it is the what, the
how, and the why of everything in our
experience. It is impossible to understand
man without understanding his environ¬
ment and the forces that have moulded
him physically and mentally.
Rachel Carson
(In an address in I 952 when accepting the I 95 I
non-fiction U.S. National Book Award for her
book on oceanography, The Sea Around Us)
Never in history has there been a greater
need than today for the popularization of
science. It has now become almost trite to speak of the
gap which separates the scientist and specialist from the
ordinary man in the street; and it hardly seems necessary
nowadays to repeat that the steady widening of this gap
is fraught with danger. Nevertheless it may be worth
stressing two distinct aspects of the dangers involved.
The public is usually ill-equipped to judge scientific and
technical developments adequately and so is at a loss
when called on to take decisions which may have serious
social or political consequences. Similarly, the scientist
and technician run the risk of losing contact with their
fellow citizens and hence of becoming an isolated group
in their community. The scientist and research worker
need a public which can understand them, just as the
public needs to be able to follow the work of the scientist.
But the task is far from easy.
People are no longer content to learn about the more
or less classic achievements of science in the past fifty
years; they are eager to understand and talk about the
new thinking of science today, such as the discarding of
the principle of parity or the new theories of Heisenberg
in certain nuclear reactions.

Three Lions, New York. Common, everyday objects like the tuning forks seen here arc sometimes used by research staffs
to test important scientific principles. Above, testing a new super-alloy for high lemDcrature
steam turbine blades. It demonstrates how the alloy (metal tuning fork at right) minimizes vibration
because it is built in magnetic structures, while ordinary steel tuning fork (left) vibrates freely.
Even more demanding in their desire for knowledge,
people would like to attempt an understanding of such
complex subjects without any recourse to mathematics,
and simply by applying their common sense, helped by
a few comparisons with already familiar phenomena.
Let us take a closer look at the difficulties faced both
by the popularizer and his readers. In the biological
sciences, for example, it is often impossible not to men¬
tion the names of species or refer to certain animal or
plant organs and tissues. Yet a little patience on the
part of the author and reader alike can overcome this
obstacle, especially as the writer can assume, quite reason¬
ably, that he has the reader's confidence and therefore
the latter will accept as scientifically established facts
certain phenomena and their effects, even though he
had no previous knowledge of them.
One example which comes to mind Is the explanation
of how bees transmit to each other information on the
whereabouts of food, which has been given by Professor
Karl von Frisch, the Austrian scientist (and 1959 winner
of the Kalinga Prize for the Popularization of Science.)
Professor von Frisch's studies showed that the eyes of
bees see polarized light in the sky, thus enabling them
to distinguish zones of different shades by which they
orient themselves. As the human eye, unlike the bee's,
ls not sensitive to the polarization of light, the reader
here has to use a certain degree of abstract thinking in
order to follow the explanation.
Complaints about the use of obscure, scientific Jargon,
common enough in the past century, have nowadays
become less frequent thanks to the efforts of science
writers and to a higher level of general scientific know
ledge among their readers. But the obstacles to clear and
simple explanation greatly increase once the science
writer moves away from observed facts and technical
achievements and begins dealing with fundamental laws
and principles. Yet this ls the realm in which the most
effective pioneer work in popularization could be made.
Modern sciences, or many of them, have long passed
the stage of merely accumulating knowledge; they have
succeeded in taking fundamental ideas that are linked
with one another by principles which can be stated In
a few lines and situating these ideas within a logical
framework of highly simplified structure. Without going
as far as Louis de Broglle's wave formula or Schrödlnger's
equation, it can be said that the principles of the conser¬
vation of impulse or energy, like the Carnot principle,
represent the syntheses of thousands of experiments and
calculations.
It Is from these heights of the scientific world that the
observer can expect to see all the valleys converge on
a common source; It is from these heights that he can
hope to reach the pinnacles from which he will obtain
a synthetic view of the whole complex system whose
exploration has taken so many years.
What is it that prevents the untrained public from
following the scientist in this ascent? I personally believe
that It Is the capacity for abstract thought that is lack¬
ing. Just now I mentioned those fundamental concepts
which are linked with one another by basic laws and
principles and the synthesis of which provides the vast
framework of modern science. Those concepts are essen-

SCIENCE POPULARIZATION (Cont'd)
The hazards of oversimplification
tlally abstract. Certainly they are based on familiar
ideas, on those things that are self-evidentnumbers,
size, speed, position in space and time of similar or dissi¬
milar objects; but these familiar ideas must be the
groundwork for intense Intellectual effort leading to
abstract structures like those of mathematics. Only thus
is it possible to clearly understand a fundamental concept
such as that of the relativity of space and time.
Some highly skilled writers have believed it possible
to present to a reader who is intelligent, but has had no
fundamental scientific training, the chain of reasoning
and the logical construction that lead from the concrete
and familiar concept to the abstract one. In certain
cases this can be done without mathematical formula?
and by using everyday terms. Unfortunately, however,
such a feat produces scarcely any more real understand¬
ing than does the watching of a conjuror's tricks. The
reader thinks he understands; each step of the argument
seems to be within his grasp; but if afterwards he tries to
handle the abstract concept which he believes he has
acquired, if he tries to make use of it in other arguments,
he at once realizes that he has still not acquired a suffi¬
ciently deep understanding.
There may even be some danger in the simplicity and
extreme neatness of certain expositions, however brilliant
they may be. I remember at the university a particu¬
larly able professor of mathematics whose lectures were
so clear that they could be followed without the slightest
effort and who could lead his students through the mazes
of integral calculus in such a way that they seemed
like broad avenues beautifully laid out. But once his
lectures were over, as soon as we wanted to use these
concepts in order to make an actual calculation, we often
realized that we had to start all over again and that we
had travelled, as in a dream, through a wilderness for
which in fact we had no map.
So let us not delude ourselves. To understand these
abstract concepts and to reach the syntheses they make
possible, much thought is needed and much reflection.
The chain of reasoning must be followed over and over
again from the beginning and each time we must
recognize that in fact we are only advancing a little
further, only parting a little wider the veils that enwrap
the new idea we wish to grasp.
This is an individual task; no one else can do it for us.
The scientific writer can guide us, help us .supply us with
all the equipment needed to move forward, but he cannot
"think" for us. Newton said that he had discovered his
principle "by thinking about it." Similarly, we must
think and re-think if we are to make any worthwhile
progress along the path which the great scientific ex¬
plorers have blazed for us.
The difficulties of abstract thought are not the only
ones which the popularizer encounters in his work. There
is also, so to speak, the question of "shock." The brightest
rockets of modern physics or biology have so shocked the
common sense of many highly developed people (their
common sense, not their good sense) that these people
have been unwilling or unable to make the effort needed
to follow their flight. The principle of relativity, and
more particularly the relativity of time, still seem
inadmissible to many people who, although educated, are
insufficiently trained in the intellectual discipline of
science. The same is true of the uncertainty principle
and the principle of genetic information.
Generally, moreover, such people are under the impres¬
sion that there is no reason to make any undue effort
since these things are only the provisional speculations
of scientists, useful perhaps for their specialized work but
meaningless from the point of view of real life. Others,
having thought more deeply, see in them the overthrow
of certain "values" which mean so much to them that
their elimination is intolerable.
In regard to genetic information, for example, there
are some people who, for religious or other reasons,
cannot admit that all the characteristics of life are mate¬
rially embodied in a list of chemical molecules, however
complex. They remain persuaded that life cannot be
explained on the basis of physical-chemical phenomena
KALINGA PRIZE TO SPACE-AGE WRITER
16
THE selection of Mr. Arthur C. Clarke,
a British science and science fiction
writer as winner of this year's Kalin¬
ga Prize means that this annual intern¬
ational award for the popularization of
science has honoured for the first time
an interpreter of the space age.
Mr. Clarke is a former chairman of
the British Interplanetary Society and is
now President of the Ceylon Astronom¬
ical Association. Interplanetary flights,
spaceships and expeditions into the
cosmos are among the subjects of his
twenty-eight books, both fiction and non-
fiction, which have sold two million
copies in fifteen languages.
The Kalinga Prize of 1,000 pounds
sterling is awarded by an international
jury appointed by Unesco. It is a per¬
sonal donation of Mr. Bijoyanand Patnaik,
an Indian industrialist, who is Chief
Minister of the State of Orissa and a
director of the Kalinga Foundation, nam¬
ed after the empire ruled by the peace-
loving Asoka in India twenty-two
centuries ago.
The jury which awarded this year's
Kalinga Prize was composed of Profes¬
sor I.I. Artobolevski of the Academy of
Arthur C. Clarke
Sciences
Giuseppe
Genetics
Dr. M. S
of the U.S.S.R., Professor
Montalenti of the Institute of
of Rome University, and
Randhawa, adviser on natural
resources and scientific research to the
Planning Commission of India.
Previous winners of the prize since its
foundation in 1951 have been: Louis de
Broglie (France), Julian Huxley (United
Kingdom), Waldemar Kaempffert (United
States), Augusto Pi Suner (Venezuela),
George Gamow (United States), Bertrand
Russell (United Kingdom), Karl von
Frisch (Germany and Austria), Jean Ros¬
tand (France) and Ritchie Calder (U.K.).
The tenth Kalinga prizewinner,
Mr. Clarke has, in addition to his interest
in space questions, also delved into and
written about another great unknown
the ocean depths. He has done much
underwater exploration and photography
along the Great Barrier Reef of Australia
and the coast of Ceylon.
Aged 44, he now lives in Ceylon and
was nominated as a candidate for the
Kalinga Prize by the Ceylon Association
for the Advancement of Science. Among
the books he has published are "Inter¬
planetary Flight", "The Exploration of
Space", "Voice Across the Sea", "The
Challenge of the Spaceship", "The First
Five Fathoms", "The Challenge of the
Sea", "The Other Side of the Sky" and
"A Fall of Moondust". A special study,
"The Challenge of the Spaceship",
appeared in The Unesco Courier in
November 1957.

i Three Lions, New York Scientific research sometimes calls for simple apparatus ranging from balls and toys to bubble
blowers. Because soap bubbles tend to join and balance like atoms grouping themselves Into
orderly structures, they can be used, as here, to duplicate actual atomic crystal structures of which
all metals are composed. Research scientists can thus "see" and Investigate on a vastly larger scale
the patterns and defect structures formed by atoms In nature. (In the case of actual crystal struc¬
ture, spaces between atoms would be approximately six million times smaller than shown here).
and that a totally different type of entity, often termed
a "vital" force, must be invoked. They will not be con¬
vinced until a chemical synthesis of the first artificial
living organism has been achieved, even if it be no more
than a virus.
In such cases, the popularizer cannot hope for anything
more than to transmit a clear understanding of the prob¬
lem, an exact definition of what must be accepted if the
scientific adventure is to be followed further. We can,
of course, also make this adventure so attractive that the
lure of the quest becomes stronger than the traditional
attachments. It is here, incidentally, that the fantasies
of "science fiction" might have their most valuable effect.
If the difficulties are so great, just what can the scien¬
tific writer do? Let us make use of a comparison. Every¬
one knows that the actions of any specialized group,
when seen from a distance, remain Incomprehensible
even to the attentive observer. The crew of a sailing ship
or the workmen on a building site or mountain climbers
on a rockface all behave in a seemingly bewildering
manner: they stand about doing nothing, for no apparent
reason; they hurry to and fro, gesticulate, concentrate
themselves on the effort, again without any apparent
reason. Their behaviour can only be understood if they
are observed from close at hand and even then some
technical explanations will be needed.
It is the same when scientists and specialists are at
work: they toil away, they give up, they exult and broad
cast their triumph in their publications. But we under¬
stand nothing of It, It ls all too far off. The popularizer
offers u.s an admirable telescope with which we can peer
Into the very place where the work ls going on. He pro¬
vides us with a hearing aid by means oí which we can
hear the replies to the questions we put; he gives us
the explanations which become necessary as we proceed
with our exploration.
Nevertheless, he will not turn us into mountain climbers
or sailors. For that, we should have to live on the ship
or cling to the rocks, with every movement having a
definite and often vital inner meaning. The reader comes
to share the research worker's outlook and, having under¬
stood him, will be interested in his task and will be
ready to help him as far as possible. He may even become
enthusiastic about this science whose spiritual value he
can at last appreciate, whereas before he knew nothing
of it but its material Implications. If he ls still young
enough, he may be tempted actually to bridge the gulf
which the popularizer has enabled him to cross in his
mind, and become a research worker himself. What better
justification could one wish for the scientific writer?
Men of the highest distinction, sometimes even famous
scientists, have devoted themselves to this task of
popularizing science which is at once so difficult and so
enthralling. They have not hesitated to give much of
their time and thought to the exposition of scientific
knowledge in its most accessible form and without
diminishing its value.

hese quotations from Goethe and Tagore aptly
describe the reason for and the essence of
Paul Geheeb's activity as an educationist in our time. The
official educational policy in every country gradually gets
Into a rut; it is then that we need pioneers and revolu¬
tionaries like a Pestalozzi, a Tagore and a Geheeb to bring
fresh life into the dead, mechanical system, to blaze a
trail into the unknown and beckon us to follow and strive
to realize the impossible.
The Unesco charter says that the ideals of peace, of
brotherhood and tolerance should be planted in the
tender hearts of children then only can we emerge one
day from the jungle of national rivalries that is the world
today. From this lofty height alone should we appraise
the activities of "Paulus," as his children and fellow
workers endearingly called him.
He was born on October 10, 1870 in Geisa in the moun¬
tains of the Rhön in Germany and died on May 1, 1961,
in Goldern, Switzerland, amidst his children and co¬
workers, who were so near to his heart till the very end.
Both his grandfather and father were pharmaceutical
chemists, and his father was also an active botanist, a
specialist in mosses, who had a unique collection
of mosses from all over the world. The young boy was
greatly inspired by his father's hobby and accompanied
him In his wanderings through the nearby forests, so
at eight years of age the precocious child signed his
letters: "Paul Geheeb, student of Natural Sciences."
After his matriculation he studied for 20 terms in the
Universities of Berlin and Jena, and was almost what
Germans call an ewiger student, for his thirst for
knowledge was insatiable; his striving to reach the
heights of a perfectly integrated being (In whom science
and humanism, philosophy and activity should blend into
a whole) was unceasing.
Wilhem von Humboldt, the friend of Goethe and
Schiller, was his dearest teacher all through his life. In
the university he studied theology, philosophy, oriental
and classical languages (Latin, Greek, Hebrew, Aramaic),
anatomy, physiology and psychiatry. He took his theology
degree and was ordained as a pastor. But soon after his
first sermon from the pulpit he strongly felt the call to
spend his life educating young growing minds.
The subject of his doctor's theses under Professor
Rudolf Eucken was: "Spinoza's Conception of God and
Its Influence on German Thinkers of the Classical Era."
But the almost penniless student, who had with great
effort saved 300 Marks for the doctorate fee, thought that
this sum could be more usefully spent to save the family
of a drunkard from ruin, and so he never became a "Herr
Dr." so all-important for the German bourgeoisie!
However, on his 90th birthday both the Universities of
Tübingen and Tagore's Visva-Bharati awarded him the
honorary doctorate.
Before he left the university, Paulus felt that his real
vocation was among the poor children of great cities and
so he started work among them in the poorest quarter of
Berlin. In 1902 he joined Hermann Lietz (one of the
early pioneers of the new education) in Haubinda, who
later appointed him as its head. But two years later
Lietz leased it out and, as many parents were eager to
have their children remain under Paulus' care, he started
"a free school community" in Wickersdorf.
Here Edith Cassirer, the daughter of a rich Berlin
industrialist, who hated the narrow constraints of a very
well-to-do family, joined Paulus as a kindergarden
teacher. It was nothing less than a revolt on the part
of the young lady at the turn of the century, who was
not willing to wait with docility for a rich man to come
and ask for her hand, but claimed a woman's right to
work, and further her self-development! She too, like
Paulus, had her novitiate among the slum children of
Berlin.
Three years later she became Paulus' wife and for
nearly 52 years stood by his side, firm as a rock. She
helped him, sustained him and served him to the last
and still is serving his ideal, with selfless devotion.
Without Edith, Paulus could never have realized his
dreams. And it shows the nobility of Edith's father,
Stadtrat Max Cassirer, that he who had at first bitterly
opposed the marriage, now lavishly poured out his wealth,
to found the Odenwaldschule in April 1910 with its
extensive grounds and twelve houses.
cHiLDREN from the elite of Germany (in litera¬
ture, arts and music), flocked to Paulus'
school, where blew a fresh wind in the stifling atmosphère
of Imperial Germany in the day of the last of the Kaisers.
It flourished and grew, till the chilling blast of Nazism
came like a hurricane and ushered in a new barbarism.
As a matter of fact Hitler wanted Geheeb to stay, because
of his great international reputation, especially in the
USA, but Geheeb was, as Einstein wrote to him after the
war, "one of the few upright men" who kept the honour
of Germany.
So with rucksacks on their backs Paulus and Edith
wandered to the land of Wilhelm Tell in April 1934 and
started again from scratch. In Switzerland they were
without money, without properly trained teachers and
they had few pupils (as the war soon broke out). They
had to change the location of their school five times, till

Love and affection for the animals and children surrounding him; respect and tolerance for the con¬
cepts and religions of others: these were the dominant precepts of Paul Geheeb, who counted among
his friends men like Gandhi, Albert Schweitzer, Romain Rolland and Albert Einstein. In 1930 he
first met Rabindranath Tagore (above) who was visiting Europe, and they became life-long friends.
'Beyond all borders, go beyond'
they found a permanent home for their "Ecole d'Huma¬
nité" in Goldern, Bernese Oberland, in 1946.
I have heard Edith Geheeb say that they were proudest
of their work during the war-years in Lac Noir (near
Fribourg), in a tiny "Home for the Friends of Nature,"
which stood empty. There, persecuted children with no
money in their pockets, escaping from various countries
of Europe, partly from the horror of concentration camps,
came and found a home and warmth of love, while the
world outside was drenched in blood and the atmosphere
poisoned with hatred. And the Geheebs shared what
little they had, with these hapless children.
When the war ended, the Americans (in occupation of
Hessen) asked Paulus to come back and re-start the
Odenwaldschule, but he refused to go, because, as he
said to me, "My countrymen have disappointed me too
deeply." But there was a more profound reason. The
minds of the truly great, develop and grow; they do not
remain static. Just as Tagore's tiny experimental school
92 slowly developed into an International University, so
Paulus' ideas were growing into a "School of Humanity,"
where children of all colours, races, and faiths might
gather, to cultivate universal tolerance and learn each
others' ways of life and culture. And where could it be
more ideally situated than in a country, where people
speaking four languages live in harmony and amity?
Today, among a hundred boys and girls in the "Ecole
d'Humanité" are children from fourteen countries.
Having been brought up in Tagore's school, I was keen
to visit the Odenwaldschule. T saw so many things that
the two schools had in common that I persuaded Tagore
to visit Paulus. They became life-long friends.
Among his friends Paulus counted men like Romain
Rolland, Gandhi, Tagore, Albert Schweitzer, Einstein
men who put their stamp on their Age. What did all
these men have in common? To answer in the words of
Tagore, they were all:
Travellers
Whose eternal journey is toward the future.
Climbing barriers, crossing mountains.
Through the gaping century they strode out
Into the Unknown, into the Unseen.
In their blood the trumpet sounded:
'Beyond all borders, go beyond'.

PAUL GEHEEB (Cont'd)
A BOLD EDUCATIONAL REFORMER
AND A SCHOOL FOR MANKIND
by Henry R. Cassirer
An "educational laboratory", Paul Geheeb called
the school which he founded in 1910. He con¬
ceived the Odenwaldschule as a place for "daring, bold
experiments in educational reforms", a pacemaker for
"the enormous and therefore more sluggish organism of
public education." In this spirit, the forty-year old
educator began his work in Germany, and he maintained
this air of adventure in the world of education until he
ended his days more than fifty years later in the midst
of his community, high in the mountains of Switzerland.
When Geheeb placed his school in the beautiful coun¬
tryside of Western Germany, not far from such centres
of urban culture as Heidelberg, Darmstadt and Mann¬
heim, his choice was inspired by the philosophical tradi¬
tion of which he was an outstanding heir.
Speaking in Darmstadt in 1929, Geheeb said:
"In the 18th century, there developed among the Ger
man people an ever-growing anxiety that civilization
would destroy humanism. More and more passionately
the cry arose: We do not need priests, nor learned men,
nor officials, nor future artisans, but human beings ! At
that moment Rousseau sounded his call for a Return to
Nature! but not In the sense of turning one's back on
culture. For Rousseau did not think of retreating Into
the cave of a virgin forest; he called for a true humanism.
We know how Kant and Goethe were moved and inspired
by Rousseau's Emile, and how the young Pestalozzi avidly
read this book though It was at that time proscribed in
Switzerland. It was then that the Magna Carta of new
education was illuminated in Goethe's Wilhelm Meister."
Closeness to nature was for Geheeb not escape but a
vital force for education. In this eyes there was no great¬
er natural wonder than the child. "There is no greater

At the age of eight, Paul Geheeb was already a keen student of natural sciences, and In preparing
himself for his work as an educator of youth, he strove to become a teacher in whom science and huma¬
nism, philosophy and activity were blended Into a whole. Here, surrounded by boys and girls of his
École d'Humanité in Switzerland (grouping children from I 4 countries) he gives a biology lesson.

PAUL GEHEEB (Cont'd)
Established in 1910, Paul Geheeb's Odenwaldschule
in Germany quickly became a focal point for pro¬
gressive education with its liberal views, co-education,
family groups under a house "father" and "mother"
and a remarkable degree of self-government. Above,

Not equal rights but equal responsibilities
miracle," he said, "among the inexhaustible miracles of
creation, which in the strictest sense is unlimited in its
richness, than the miraculous fact that nature dispenses
Its seed every day with generous amplitude and that not
one of its fruits is exactly the equal of the other. The
younger the child the more we enjoy it because we
rejoice in the wealth of individuality and originality."
Geheeb felt that it was not possible to develop the
individual personality of the child in isolation or even
within the limitation of the family circle. A living com¬
munity of adults and children is needed. "The idea that
the community exists only to serve the individual by no
means implies that the community as such is unimpor¬
tant," he said. Every individual emerges from and
depends upon his community, and without it he could
neither come into being nor exist in isolation. Moreover,
the individual can never reach fulfillment except through
society with its Immeasurable power of love, and this can
best be promoted through the community."
"To be only governed is completely unknown in our
school," Paul Geheeb said, "for it is a community without
superiors, a school without a director... We have never
quarrelled about rights, no one was interested in equal
rights for old and young. The central idea of our com¬
munity is responsibility, responsibility of everyone, for
himself and for the community."
His emphasis upon responsibility as the guiding factor
in education, inevitably led Geheeb to adopt an aristo¬
cratic rather than a quantitatively egalitarian approach,
for "the degree to which the individual is conscious of his
responsibility depends upon his experience and maturity
in life." Though formally democratic in its constitution,
with equal votes for children and adults in the school
council, Geheeb's emphasis was neither upon the autho¬
rity of the majority nor upon that of the teachers.
As one of the teachers in the Odenwaldschule put it:
"The authority of the teacher is replaced by the authority
of those who together represent the idea of the school;
this authority is heeded by adults as much as by children."
This approach was not only in stark contrast to the
authoritarian tradition of German education but also to
the opposite extreme where undue "freedom" is granted
to children in the name of progressive education.
"The teenage child of 12 to 14," Geheeb wrote, "often
completely lacks a sense of humility, and his unchlldlike
sophistication is actually encouraged by contemporary
thinking which is based on a confused notion of the
'right of the child,' and a well-meaning reaction against
24 the inhuman relationship between teacher and pupil
which was so prevalent in the past. As a result, teenagers
frequently have no understanding of the reserve required
in one's conduct with other people: they have lost the
feeling of respect for greater maturity, and are unable to
establish a fruitful relationship with adult friends, that is,
a relationship from which they can profit and develop."
These words, written by Geheeb more than forty years
ago, go to the root not only of the problem of teenagers
but also of the harmful impact of a misunderstood "pro¬
gressive" or "child-centred" education. Geheeb valued
and respected the individuality of each child and adult;
but he called for equal respect on the part of others,
no matter what their age or alleged "rights."
In Geheeb's eyes, life in the community for each child
was therefore not only a school of democracy but a source
of personality development and an appreciation of the
true human values in the relationship between man and
man.
This approach led Geheeb to proclaim a critérium appli¬
cable to all educational communities: "The key to the
right of existence and the validity of a community which
pretends to serve young people, is whether the prevailing
atmosphere is harmful and a hindrance to the develop¬
ment of the child, or whether it promotes such growth
and favours its flowering."
Ihe human community is composed of men and
women. The school community must similar¬
ly include both boys and girls. Co-education is funda¬
mental to education, in the view of Geheeb. It took
courage and far-sightedness in 1909 to establish a school
in which boys and girls not only were taught together
in the same classroom but shared their life from morning
till evening. The school was divided into families, each
headed by a teacher, who took care of a group of children
in one of the school buildings. Each family resembled
the natural family in that it included both sex<^s.
Geheeb, who had formerly been militant in the move¬
ment for the emancipation of women, considered co-edu¬
cation so vital that the 44-page application to the govern¬
ment for permission to open the Odenwaldschule con¬
tained 30 pages on this subject. "Co-education means joy¬
fully to affirm the polarity of the sexes in both theory
and practice," he said, "in attitude and living, to in¬
tegrate pedagogically the rich sources of wealth it pro¬
duces into all fields of life and culture, and to apply
them fruitfully to the development of the child."
Geheeb saw in co-education not merely a way of edu¬
cating children by raising them together and teaching
them in the same classroom, but a directive as to how

The Ecole d'Humanité at Goldern in Switzerland
is a testament to the tenets of Paul Geheeb's philoso¬
phy of education. Formal instruction, like chemistry
(above) is kept to the mornings, and afternoons are
devoted to art, handicrafts, music and the open air.
Youngsters find a common Interest In art. For Paul
Geheeb, the education of the whole man, as he saw
it, comes first. In his school, children of all colours,
races and faiths, cultivate universal tolerance and
learn to understand other cultures and ways of life.
human beings should live with each other throughout
their life despite and because of the differences between
the sexes. He conceived co-education as a force opposed
to all contemporary tendencies which seek to destroy
respect and tolerance among men.
Life and learning must advance together but in the
view of Geheeb public education fails in either respect.
The address with which he inaugurated the Odenwald¬
schule in 1910 has a modern-day ring to It.
"I do not want to criticize the teachers in state
schools," he said. "Many of them are of course capable
and are filled with the most noble intentions. But the
government schools are teaching institutions with more
or less overcrowded classes, where contact between the
old and the young is only superficial. Yet it Is only in
communities of life and work that children can grow into
full human beings."
"There is widespread dissatisfaction with public educa¬
tion and innumerable are the vain attempts at reform.
Complaints are made that the schools arc overburdened,
and learned men disagree over whether the curriculum
should be cut in one place or another. But it is impossible
to reform the school with scissors. Today wc see schooLs
in which children sit listening passively to lecturing
teachers, and then spend the remaining free time of the
day in a painful effort to learn what has been taught in
the lesson. What needs to be done is to turn these teach¬
ing institutions into working communities where children
actually can collaborate with their teachers."

PAUL GEHEEB (Cont'd)
Respect & tolerance
transcending all barriers
A new approach to learning and to work was therefore
required. Here Geheeb built upon the ideas of Ellen Key,
expressed so forcefully in her famous work, The Century
of the Child (1903), in which she said: "Until we have
succeeded In driving the phantom of general education
out of the curricula and out of the heads of parents, and
have replaced it by the education of the individual, it
will be vain to draft plans of school reform."
Geheeb therefore introduced a new structure into the
lesson plan, the Kurssystem. Its essential feature was
that for a period of one month each child had to choose
courses in three subjects, each taught daily for 11 hours.
This made it possible for the student to concentrate on
intensive studies in limited fields. Other subjects were
then taken up during subsequent periods. The emphasis
in teaching was less upon learning facts, than upon
learning to learn, to work independently, to study and to
understand.
Another feature of the Kurssystem was that the
children were to be gathered in study groups according
to their level of maturity and knowledge, rather than
according to age groups. Thus a child might find himself
with older children in one subject for which he was gifted,
but with younger children in another subject where he
had had little previous schooling. Adjustment of pace
and content to individual interests and abilities, all within
the framework of preparation for the final state exami¬
nation was a key goal of Geheeb's educational method.

I EHEEB expressed his purpose in these words:
"The organization of the curriculum should
take into account equally the needs of the subject matter
and of the student. So that the material can be present¬
ed and grasped in its essence, we insist that each field
be studied coherently and with as little distraction as
possible from other subjects. But, we also require that
the pupil be given a certain freedom of choice in deciding
the field of study which he takes up at any particular
time in order to give scope to his needs and initiative."
Overcrowding of the curriculum, lack of adaptation of
teaching to individual ability and pace, the need to teach
the capacity to think and work independently rather than
merely to accumulate facts and information these ever-
present concerns of all educators were clearly seen by
Geheeb over fifty years ago and given practical solutions
in his educational laboratory.
When National Socialism carried virulent nationalism
and racialism to their extremes, Paul Geheeb turned his
back upon Germany, not in a spirit of defeatism but in
one of defiance. His School of Mankind, which he founded
under difficult conditions in Switzerland in 1934 was as
yet more an ideal and a challenge for the future than a
reality.
In his inaugural speech he stressed that this might not
appear to be the appropriate time to speak of a school of
mankind, for while the concept of humanity had lived
as an abstraction in the minds of Kant, Herder or Schiller,
history had since demonstrated that humanity did not
yet exist.
"But precisely because the idea of a school of mankind
may easily be considered untimely," he said, "our age
probably needs it most of all."
"The ideal which firmly stands before my eyes is the
economic and cultural co-operation of mankind with each
bound closely to the other. The microcosm of a living
community in a school should correspond in its essential
characteristics to this."
Out of deep respect for the personality of the individual
in his community and a profound belief in the humanism
of man as the supreme goal of all education, there grew
his amity for other cultures, including in particular those
of the Orient.

Paul Geheeb and his wife, Edith, who for nearly
52 years helped and sustained him in all his educa¬
tional endeavours. She is still serving his ideal in
the Ecole d'Humanité seen here (left centre), against
the backdrop of the snowcapped Bernese Oberland.
A community is not a contradiction of individuality, but
rather its confirmation. Similarly, a school of mankind
requires that children shall not lose their national cul¬
tural roots in favour of a synthetic hotchpotch of cultures.
"The more a child is rooted in the culture of his own
nation," said Paul Geheeb, "the more forcefully and
creatively is he able to establish his relationship with
another cultural community."
It is love that binds man to his fellows ; it is love that is
the principal source of Geheeb's force as an educator.
This was the theme of his inaugural address at Odenwald
In 1910. "If there is anything which serves eternal
values," he said, "it is the union of men attuned to each
other, it is the spiritual community which consciously
cultivates its soul and sees the true service to God in a
community in which everyone feels that he is sustained
by the love of others and carried upward toward higher
goals."
This remained the theme of his life. Love and affection
for the animals and children who surrounded him, respect
and tolerance for the concepts and religions of others,
inspired an atmosphere which transcends all barriers of
nationality or religious dogma.
Dr. Henry R. Cassirer speaks of Paul Geheeb from long
acquaintance with the educator. A nephew of Geheeb, he receiv¬
ed all his schooling at the Odenwaldschule. Dr. Cassirer is head
of the radio and television section, Mass Communication Tech¬
niques Division, at Unesco and is the author of Unesco's popular
book, "Television Teaching Today."

MUSIC OF THE ORIENT
A new language for Western ears
by Alain Daniélou
Photo A. Martin © Atljj Photo
Governed by different rules and based on other forms, the music of Asian peoples is often
unintelligible to the peoples of the West, whose musical training and tastes are too dissi¬
milar for them to properly appreciate its beauty. Above, a flute player from Sumatra.
With the greater ease we now have In making
contacts across frontiers, we are gradually
coming to know more about the ideas and art forms of
other peoples. We thereby lose any feelings of uniqueness
or superiority and this, for all of us, is an immense gain.
Yet there are always some fields in which our ideas and
tastes have more difficulty in adjusting themselves to
unfamiliar forms of expression and w<2 are apt to deny,
or at least to disparage, the value of anything that strays
too far from our own aesthetic standards. One of these
fields is music.
Several times while I have been in Asia I have been
asked, for example, to help in answering Unesco question
naires dealing with the musical life in Asian countries.
The distinguished musicians and musicologists who drew
up these forms cannot be accused of bias and partiality,
yet I have often been embarrassed by the questions which,
unintentionally yet unmistakably, left no doubt that
"music" here was being considered exclusively In terms
of Occidental forms and traditions.
This fact alone seemed to reduce anything else to a
kind of folk music which, however charming and attrac¬
tive it might be, could not be regarded as anything more
than a simple and unsophisticated musical form surviving
among peoples who had still not attained the level of poly¬
phonic maturity.

MUSIC OF THE ORIENT (Cont'd)
Learning to accept the unfamiliar
How should I have answered these questions? "No! We
have no orchestras, no conductors, no composers, no con¬
cert halls, and yet our musical art is skilful and erudite,
refined and richly developed. It has the power to move
immense numbers of people, it lends Itself to grandiose
and complex melodic structures and, all things considered,
it is perhaps even more suited than Western music to
express human emotions at their most subtle or their
most intense those, in fact, of humanity in general and
not simply of the people in the Orient.
I have often wondered how one could possibly approach
such a problem except through a long, difficult and some¬
what pedantic statement which would strike at the very
roots of accepted musical theory and inevitably provoke
stormy reactions. As it happens I have never been asked
for an explanation of this kind since the inquiry was sim¬
ply seeking material facts and figures on which to base
a programme for helping musicians and disseminating
musical works.
Before we can hope to look realistically and effectively
for answers to questions of this kind and before we can
expect to deal with the manifold problems which a recon¬
ciliation of the world's musical cultures would involve, it
seems to me that priority should be given to putting the
facts of the case before as many people as possible. And
what better and more eloquent evidence could there be
than fine works of music taken in their purest and most
original state from the musical treasuries of countries
with highly developed cultures and in particular those
of Asia?
Already audiences in America, Great Britain and Ger¬
many, and to a lesser degree in France and Italy, have
had the chance to hear great musicians from countries
28 like India, Iran and Japan, as well as orchestras from
Indonesia. The success of such concerts has exceeded all
expectations.
Yet however great the impact of a concert (the perso¬
nality of the musician and "local colour" have to be
taken into account) the musical impression it leaves is
transitory, thus making it difficult for us either to analyze
a work or to perceive and understand the outlines of a
musical system.
If we wish to see beyond the superficial aspects of tech¬
nique and feeling in a performance, we need to hear the
same work repeated (and where improvisation plays a
major role, the same rendering) in order to grasp, little
by little, its meaning and understand its structure.
We should remember too that a concert artist, always
mindful of success, tends to "play" to his audience, to
adapt his style to what he believes to be the public's- tastes
and habits. In the kinds of music where improvisation is
all-important, this colouring of performance can go to
extremes, as many famous examples have shown.
Today, however, in the gramophone record we have an
unequalled instrument for listening reflectively, intelli¬
gently and perceptively to music which has been recorded
in its natural surroundings and for its usual audience.
Freed from any picturesque aspect, from showmanship
and the exotism which the presence of musicians with
their costumes and instruments creates, we are able to
listen to this music in complete tranquility, under con¬
ditions when we are best prepared from every point of
view to understand it.
I am sure it is through records that we shall gradually
grasp the meaning of musical systems that differ from
our own, learning to appreciate to the full their beauty,
quality and values. This too can open up vast new hori¬
zons to us, revealing fields of musical experience whose
existence we had never suspected.

Richly garbed musicians of a Japanese orchestra perform

The zither, with some variations, Is a stringed Instru¬
ment common to countries both In the Occident and
the Orient. Here two girls from Viet-Nam play the
melodies of their country on an Oriental version.
Today the economic predominance of the Occident
creates a serious problem for Asian cultures. Few indeed
are the people of the Occident capable of realizing that
modern progress and Western cultures do not necessarily
go hand-in-hand. The same mistaken idea seems
nowadays to be spreading in Asian countries.
The real problem today Is how to safeguard some Inten¬
sely precious aspects of cultural life associated with peo¬
ples who, because temporarily they are economically less
prosperous than the countries of the West, are too often
lumped together as "under-developed" when, more often
than not, the reverse Is true.
Peoples with complex social structures and "over- dev¬
eloped" cultural systems have always been at the mercy of
invaders less cultivated than themselves in so many ways.
We quickly see the absurdity of a supercilious attitude
when we are dealing with monuments, architectural mas¬
terpieces or examples of the graphic and plastic arts
which need to be saved from damage or destruction. But
the problem becomes far less straightforward when It ls
a question of the living arts and, in particular, music,
though this is of equal importance. Here we come up
against difficult problems of evaluation.
When we hear a language being spoken which we do
not understand we readily admit our ignorance. Curiously
enough this does not seem to be the case with music.
Even when we hear a musical language, whose syntax and
vocabulary are completely different from what we are used
to, we believe we have understood it all and at once feel
competent to express our views on it, more often than
not basing them on a few inferior examples of the music
in question.
Tired of hearing absurd criticisms not only from unqual¬
ified visitors but sometimes from eminent musicians whom
they admire and respect, most Oriental peoples today try
to produce musical forms which, while still based on their
traditional music, have been adapted to their idea of
International standards. What they are trying to do ls to
make Asian music more comprehensible to foreign visi¬
tors and to avoid criticism and thereby gain a place of
high repute in world music. The disquieting thing about
it ls that psychologically speaking they are not entirely
wrong, although as a technical proposition the idea ls
absurd.
In the case of art music the theoretical problems
Involved in producing skilled adaptations make the task
an impossible one. It can only be done at the lowest level
and this generally corresponds to what in the Occident
would be an adaptation Into jazz of say Bach's inventions
or Chopin's preludes.
In other words an alien rhythm is applied to melodic
forms which are not, In fact, the essentials of the
original music. In the case of Asian music the addition
of polyphonic forms and attempts at modulation are
utterly destructive to the very foundations of the musical
language. Even if the melodic forms appear to have been
preserved they no longer have the same meaning, nor in
fact any meaning whatsoever.
The only effective antidote to this strange sickness ls a
psychological one and it will come from a much wider
appreciation In other countries of the masterpieces
of Asian music presented in their true and original forms
and In an uncompromisingly traditional style.
This musical education can come initially through
recordings and be carried on subsequently over the radio.
Primarily the need is for recordings of the great 29

MUSIC OF THE ORIENT (Cont'd)
A unique Unesco
record collection
musicians and traditional orchestras of the various
Oriental cultures made under ideal conditions so that
selected examples of the musical systems which they
represent will be available for wide distribution. An
equivalent problem for the diffusion of Western music
has already been solved to a large extent.
These recordings should have more than a simple ethno-
musicological interest. The purpose is not to enrich the
musicological records of museums with the last examples
of musical arts which are doomed to extinction. On the
contrary, records of great living artists must be made and
widely circulated to pave the way for concerts and cultu¬
ral exchanges which could not only help to preserve Asia's
chief musical systems, but also Introduce us to a musical
art of which we at present know but little.
The production of these recordings is being supervised
by the International Music Council, a UNEsco-sponsored
organization, and they are being made in collaboration
with schools of traditional music, radio organizations and,
In most cases, with the support and help of governments.
Independent specialists are also helping to create a record
library which, both as regards quality of works and level
of Interpretation, truly represents the classical traditions
of different countries in their purest forms. Modern adap¬
tations and concessions to fads and tastes of the moment
have been scrupulously avoided and arrangements of folk
music of an orchestrated kind which have become quite
common in some countries are being systematically
excluded. (See details page 35)
In assembling these collections we have tried as far as
possible to draw a distinction between the different kinds
of music. Instead of offering a fragmentary sampling of
items, it has been decided to devote several records to spe¬
cific aspects of a country's music. This provides the room
needed to present complete works and the success so far
achieved by the collection shows that even from the view¬
point of musicians and music lovers belonging to other
cultures this choice was the right one.
Musical anthologies of Iran (two records), of
Afghanistan, of Laos and of Cambodia have
already been issued. Now in production are two records of
an Indian anthology (Vedic songs and music for dancing
and for the theatre from Southern India) and a record
of Tunisian music. Three records of Tibetan music and
a Moroccan record are now being made and Japanese,
Indonesian and Korean anthologies are also planned.
A parallel series of recordings of folk music will shortly
make available important traditional forms of music
from countries which do not possess, properly speaking,
an art music for which a written theory exists. This
series will not be limited to Asian music, but will
eventually deal with the traditional music of all countries
including African and European.
This collection of recordings ls not considered as
something final or complete in itself, but rather as
the first step in the creation of constructive links between
the world's different musical cultures. Thus a larger
place will be opened up for the great Asian musicians in
international musical" life and a greater measure of mutual
comprehension created, for we can never hope really to
know another people unless we understand the kind of
music which moves and stirs them.
Harpists and cymbal players accompanying singers and dancers who are
depicted on this bas-relief at the temple of Angkor-Vat testify to the
importance of music in the civilization of Cambodia. City ofAngkor with
its masterpieces of art and architecture came to light only a century ago.

LATEST PANORAMA
OF THE WORLD'S TRANSLATIONS
! ENIN was the world's most
translated author and the Bible was
the world's most widely translated
title in 1960, occording to figures
listed in the latest (thirteenth)
edition of "Index Translationum",
published annually by Unesco.
Shakespeare's comedies and tra¬
gedies were the most translated
works of literature by a single
author. Among writers of fiction,
Tolstoy and Jules Verne are tied
for second place while Agatha
Christie and Dostoievsky are tied
for third.
Translations of Shakespeare
numbered 134, spread over 29 diffe¬
rent countries. Tolstoy's "Anna
Karenina" and assorted other works
count up to 122 as do titles by
Jules Verne, grandfather of science
fiction. Mystery lovers .around the
world read Miss Christie in 109
different languages.
Unesco's thirteenth annual vol¬
ume lists 31,238 titles translated
In 58 countries. They are indexed
under General Works; Philosophy
(including Psychology); Religion
and Theology; Law, Social Sciences
and Education; Philology and Lin¬
guistics; Natural and Exact Scien¬
ces; Applied Sciences; Arts, Games
and Sports; Literature and History;
Biography and Geography.
More than half of the titles listed
(over 17,000) fall in the category of
Literature. Law, Social Sciences,
Education, History and Geography,
Applied Sciences, and Religion and
Philosophy come next in that order.
As usual, Language and Philology
trail the list with only 81 transla¬
tions recorded for 1960.
I he U.S.S.R., a multilingual
nation, continues to head the list
as the country with the most titles
translated 5,507. Germany, both
East and West, Is second with
2,859 works translated, and Czecho¬
slovakia third with 1,584. Other
countries listing more than a
thousand translated works are Italy
(1,513), France (1,426), Spain
(1,416), the United States (1,292),
the Netherlands (1,287) and Sweden
(1,075).
Although literary works account
for most translations listed in
Unesco's annual, a few countries
have given preference to other
subjects. In the United Kingdom,
for example, out of a total of 411
translations listed, 186 fall under the
subject of theology and religion.
In Bulgaria, with a total listing of
" 548 translations, law, social scien¬
ces and education account for
149 titles with another 135 trans¬
lations listed in the field of applied
science. Works on history, geo¬
graphy and biographies account for
205 translations listed by the United
States in an overall total of 1,292.
Applied sciences are the most fre¬
quently translated in Czechoslova¬
kia and arts, games and sports take
the head in Switzerland.
In Unesco's latest edition, the
Bible is listed the most often with
258 translations published of many
different versions, both classic and
modern. Most translated single
author of non-fiction is Lenin with
240 listings, and in second place is
Nikita Khrushchev whose works
have been translated into 211 diffe¬
rent languages In 12 countries. Sta¬
lin, once at the top of Unesco's lists
was translated seven times.
NI OBEL prize-winners for lit¬
erature are well represented among
those authors who have translations
listed in the two-figure category.
Pearl Buck has 59 translations
listed; Ernest Hemingway 36; Albert
Camus 31; Rabindranath Tagore 30;
George Bernard Shaw, Thomas
Mann and Henryk Sienkiewicz all
with 26; Rudyard Kipling, Boris Pas¬
ternak and Bertrand Russell all with
25; Romain Rolland 22; William
Faulkner and Selma Lagerlöf 21 ;
and André Gide with 17.
Chekhov ranks next to Shake¬
speare as most translated dra¬
matist. Other writers who have 60
to 100 titles listed are Enid Blyton,
English author of children's stories;
Georges Simenon, the creator of
"Maigret"; Karl Marx, Honoré de
Balzac, Michael Sholokhov, Charles
Dickens and another mystery
writer Erie Stanley Gardner. Close
to this group is a new-comer,
Graham Greene, the English nove¬
list, for whom 58 titles are listed as
having been translated in 1960.
Old favorites continue to multiply
themselves In foreign languages
with Sir Walter Scott's romantic
novels listed for 33 translations;
Guy de Maupassant's stories 39
translations; Edgar Allen Poe's
tales 25; the Arabian Nights 27; the
love stories of Colette 30; and the

Letters to the Editor
TEST FOR QUALITY
Sir,
In reference to the quality of The
Unesco Courier, may I point out
to those who feel it at all wanting in
any way, that any thick North Ame¬
rican publication, of which I take
several, when stripped of their adver¬
tising, contain no more meat for the
intellect than does your magazine and
in many cases, contain considerably
less. This is in addition to the fact
that The Unesco Courier gives the
most complete treatment to its chosen
subjects.
I can't pick an outstanding issue for
1961, they have all been adequate
and satisfying in their various fields.
May I humbly suggest to those readers
who feel The Unesco Courier does
not appeal to, or cover their fields of
interest, that they broaden their own
horizons. In today's world how can a
person who aspires to world fellow¬
ship or world cultural citizenship, at
the very least, say "Africa, or South
America or Abu Simbel or anthropo¬
logy do not interest me, I am only
interested in philatelies." I do feel
that a type of world cultural citizen¬
ship, to use the phrase loosely, can be
attained and must be in the back
of the minds of those who read your
magazine with deep contemplation
and appreciation. Perhaps this is a
first step towards world citizenship
in the full sense, for the individual
at any rate.
May I suggest as a final criterion
of magazine quality: What magazines'
articles remain in your mind the
longest? For me, those of The
Unesco Courier rank at the head of
my memory. May it also become
required reading in all schools one
day soon: it will be in effect a current
world encyclopedia.
G. H. Armstrong
Virden, Manitoba, Canada
THE OTHER SIDE OF SCIENCE
Sir,
I have been extremely interested in
certain of your issues Velasquez, the
Racialism issue, in particular. Here
you seem to me really aware of the
demands and interest of your readers.
However, your issue on African fauna
perturbed me. My main objection is
your placid acceptance of science and
its necessity as a whole. You dealt
with' African fauna, some members of
which you admitted have to be
destroyed for "utilitarian" reasons.
What of vivisection which in Unesco
countries is today a mainstay of
physiology, surgery, and medicine ?
The vivisectors themselves admit that
many experiments even in their eyes
are useless, cruel and wasteful. A few
scientists believe it is the main cause
of the failure of medical research in
its fight against disease. 'One medical
registrar went so far as to say that
he thought it "The greatest mistake
the world has ever committed."
Yet, we hear nothing of this side.
Vaccination, research, the strong arm
of Man, is all I have read of. I am
confident that you are not a magazine
that pampers to the majority just
because they want to be pampered to.
I believe that you sincerely wish to
present the truth to your readers. In
a nutshell, my wish is that you would
begin with the ideals of fraternity,
liberty and equality, in which you
believe, and work outwards wherever
they lead, and not try to reach them
by routes which might never get you,
or me, or any of us there.
Roger Moody
Bristol, England
WORLD-WIDE REFERENDUM
Sir,
Among the letters published in your
March issue was one from Australia,
headed "A Plea for survival." Is it
not crazily macabre that free people
have to make this plea? I agree
whole-heartedly with the contention
of the writers that "it seems pointless
addressing ourselves to or through
our governments."
Why should we not have a
voluntary world-wide "referendum"?
Simple letters could be ' written by
ordinary people of every race »and
nationality to the Secretary-General
of the United Nations asking him to
put before the General Assembly our
demand to be allowed to live in a
world free of contamination from nu¬
clear tests.
The fear in the world today is so
widespread that I am sure with a
minimum of publicity and with the
provision of a simple letter that could
be copied by all nationalities, the
flow of letters would be such that our
Governments would be forced to take
account of the views expressed. A
target date could be set to achieve
the maximum impact.
Surely this scheme would appeal
to the imagination of all who feci
helpless and frustrated by the present
situation? Would not the flow of
letters become an avalanche which
could sweep all before it ? Your
publication, distributed in so many
countries seems the ideal starting
point for such a scheme.

A FAIR DEAL FOR GEOGRAPHY
Sir,
Your article "The World of Pre¬
historic Man" (Unesco Courier
March 1961) was, overall, most
interesting. However, I would like to
correct just one statement that may
give a wrong impression of our
schools' curricula. This is the
inference that the subject of geography
is dealt with inadequately in Australian
schools.
It is true that until the completion
of the State School, when the child
is about 12 years, geography is
incorporated in a general subject,
Social Studies. Hut in the succeeding
years of the child's education, geo¬
graphy is recognized as a subject such
as the author of this article, Nino
Frank, would wish.
By the time the student has reached
Form VI level, he is about 17 years,
If he has chosen a Humanities Course,
as distinct from a Science course, he
has covered World Geography as a
study of the earth's crust and
atmosphere. Specialized MuJics of
various countries have also been m.ide.
Recently the University of Mel¬
bourne has appointed a Chair of
Geography. I believe too that our
new Monash University also recognizes
geography as an entity in its curricula.
Thus, in a Humanities Course of
Education, the study of geography
ranks with history, languages, philo¬
sophy, etc., as an integral part of
education in Australia.

TRAVEL AND TOURISTS
Sir,
The importance of the "seasonal
migration" of tourists both on
national and international levels, and
the manifold human and economic
factors it involves arc rightly regarded
as one of the most significant develop¬
ments of our time. Would it not
be a suitable subject for one of your
future issues? The great many forms
taken by it, the international efforts
to stimulate it and the thirst for
discovery which brings men closer
together through recreation would, I
am sure, interest the majority of your
readers.
K. CiLslcInau
Bordeaux, France
Ed. note : We hope to devote part
of a future issue to this important
subject.
BEWARE OF HISTORY BOOKS
Sir,
I was very surprised to find in
your March issue (The Story of the
Metric System) a kind of panegyric to
the French Revolution. Unesco,
symbol of order, civilization and
culture, sings the praises of the most
savage and sanguinary period of
French history.
You speak of Lavoisier, but do not
mention that he was executed in the
Place dc la Concorde, condemned by
a court which declared: "The Republic
has no need of scientists." You also
speak of Talleyrand, but do not say
that he was always a friend of order
and remained a monarchist.
One should beware of school text¬
books; they give an entirely false
picture of. this temblé period.

From the Unesco New;
SCIENCE SURVEY IN AFRICA: A
Unesco mission has now returned from
a survey of scientific training and research
facilities in fifteen countries of tropical
Africa. Its report will help to guide
Unesco's future long-term science pro¬
gramme for Africa and will cover such
fields as the higher educational facilities
needed for research workers and the con¬
servation of natural resources.
RADIOISOTOPE LIGHTING: Ger¬
man scientists report that six subs¬
tances among the thousand or so isotopes so
far known produce radioactive light ener¬
gy. Since these radioisotopes have a half-
life of several years they would provide
economical light sources in places where
permanent illumination is needed.
READERSHIP MOUNTS IN WESTERN
NIGERIA: Western Nigeria, which
spends nearly half of its revenue on educa¬
tion, is planning expanded readership faci¬
lities including the construction of a new
Central Library at Ibadan, its capital. The
Government is already sending books to
schools and villages through a series of mo¬
bile libraries, and local and district coun¬
cils operate over 50, including special ones
for children.
]\TEW WAYS IN TEACHING: Demons
-^ tration centres where educators could
see how new techniques radio, television,
films, electronic computers and teaching
machines can be applied to school pro¬
grammes should be set up in various parts
of the world. This recommendation was
made by educators, psychologists and tele¬
communications specialists from 15 coun¬
tries who met under Unesco's auspices in
Paris recently.
MEASURING ANTARCTICA'S ICE
CAP: A six-man party of Austra¬
lians from the Wilkes Station in the Ant¬
arctic now moving inland across the ice
cap of the continent has been measuring
its thickness by seismic soundings. In sever¬
al places bedrock was found 1,000 to 1,500
feet below sea level and at one point under¬
lying rock was about 9,000 feet below sea
level.
SHAKESPEARE IN ARABIC: The
complete works of Shakespeare are
being translated into Arabic under a pro¬
ject sponsored by the Arab League which
is also preparing translations of classics of
ancient European literature including the
"Iliad", as well as of works in Oriental lan¬
guages.
INTERNATIONAL SURVEYS OF THE
SEA: Plans for large-scale océanogra¬
phie expeditions with international fleets of
research vessels operating in the Atlantic
and Pacific under the auspices of the Inter¬
governmental Océanographie Commission
have been announced by the United States
and the U.S.S.R. at Unesco House in Paris.
The vast programmes proposed would in¬
clude studies of ocean currents; the ocean's
influence on the weather; physical, chemi¬
cal and biological processes; gravitational,
34 magnetic and electrical fields in the ocean;
and the geological structure of the ocean
floor.
WORLD THEATRE DAY: Special
theatre performances and television
and radio broadcasts marked the celebra¬
tion of World Theatre Day on March 27,
a date chosen to coincide with the opening
of the 6th season of the Theatre of the
Nations in Paris, where 23 countries are
presenting productions ranging from classic
Greek dramas to works by Strindberg,
James Joyce and Lorca.
PACT AGAINST DISCRIMINATION:
The Convention Against Discrimina¬
tion in Education adopted by the 11th
Unesco General Conference entered into
force on May 22. It conforms to the Uni¬
versal Declaration of Human Rights which
asserts the principle of non-discrimination
and the right of every person to education.
REVIEWING AFRICA'S EDUCATION:
Ministers of Education from more
than 30 African countries met in Unesco
House* recently to take stock of progress
made in implementing the master plan for
developing education in Africa adopted a
year ago in Addis Ababa. Primarily the
meeting reviewed national plans in the
general context of each country's econ¬
omic and social development.
CLEARER WORLD WATER MAPS: A
standard system of signs, symbols and
colours to be used on maps of the earth's
water resources was adopted by scientists
from eight countries meeting in Paris
recently. The standard legends approved
will ensure greater legibility on hydrogeo-
logical maps which group data on climate,
surface water, the permeability of rock for¬
mations and the underground water table.
EUROPE DEFEATS MALARIA: Re-
' ports reaching the World Health Orga¬
nization show that malaria will be eradicat¬
ed from the whole of continental Europe by
the end of this year. In 1961 there were
only 141 new cases of malaria in a total
population of 304 million Europeans living
in previously malarial areas.
WTORWAY HELPS HONG KONG: A
i-^ new hospital attached to the Chu Hai
College in Hong Kong which is a gift from
the Norwegian people in connexion with
the World Refugee Year was inaugurated
recently. It will serve as an educational
training centre for more than 2,000 students.
OXYGEN AT YOUR SERVICE: The
world's first Red Cross oxygen service
is now operating in Germany ready to meet
emergency needs for cardiac or pulmonary
patients around the clock. Oxygen supplies
are delivered to private homes on request
in a specially equipped ambulance, and a
Red Cross worker gives full instructions on
the use of the equipment.
CUBA'S FIGHT AGAINST ILLITER¬
ACY: According to a Cuban Govern¬
ment report to Unesco, 707,212 adults
learned to read and write during 1961 in
the "Year of Education" campaign to wipe
out illiteracy in the island nation. Last
year the number of illiterates in Cuba was
estimated by the Government at 979,207.
The report states that the number has
dropped to 271,995, which corresponds to
3.9 % of the population, and puts Cuba's
literacy level on a par with countries like
Switzerland, France, the U.S.S.R., Czecho¬
slovakia and Japan. According to the
report, people from all walks of life joined
to form a force of 271,000 volunteer teach¬
ers, including 35,000 regular teachers,
121,000 "popular instructors" and 115,000
members of special teaching brigades.
Teachers also came to help from Costa
Rica, Brazil, Mexico, Uruguay and Panama.
News Ffashesa
pj Yemen recently joined UNESCO, becom¬
ing the 106i/j member state.
Over 1,200,000 pages of historic docu¬
ments in libraries, museums and official
archives of eight Latin American countries
have been microfilmed by Unesco's mobile
unit since 1957.
In the north Pacific, the U.S. naval labo¬
ratory ship, "The Pioneer" has discovered
a mountain range of 34 underwater peaks
ranging from 3,000 to 6,000 feet in height.
Circulating art exhibitions sponsored by
the National Gallery of Canada reached
more than 250,000 people last year.
M) Thirty-four radio stations in Chile relay
twelve lessons a week to more than one
thousand local schools.
The Surf Life-Saving Association of Aus¬
tralia, an association of volunteers, has
saved over 200,000 people since its incep¬
tion.
To mark the 100/Zi anniversary of Jules
Verne's "Five Weeks in a Balloon" the
science correspondent of the London "Daily
Telegraph" is to make a similar trip starting
from Tanganyika.
Research into the use of chlorella, a
single-cell alga with high protein and vitamin
