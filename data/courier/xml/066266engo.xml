Persian paradise: flowers and gardens
For the people of the Orient flowers and gardens are more than mere elements of decoration. They are esteemed as intimate friends to be dearly
cherished. The Persians held them to be the Paradise on earth and a promise of future Paradise. The great Persian poet Omar Khayyam asked to
be buried in a garden. Persian miniatures in ancient manuscripts often took gardens as the central motif of their paintings. Photo shows a scene in
the forecourt of a Persian garden. Painting is attributed to a I 5th-century artist, Qasem AM, and is reproduced from the UNESCO World Art
Series colour album "Iran Persian MiniaturesImperial Library", published by the New York Graphic Society. .(See article on page 27.)

duction.
These are only a handful of the development projects
made possible through reCent loans extended by a
Specialized Agency of the United Nations the World
Bank. Officially known as the International Bank for
Reconstruction and Development, the World Bank was
established in June of 1946 with 38 nations. It now
has 67. Its aim is to develop the resources of its member
nations, increase the standards of living in under-deve¬
loped areas, and bring about a healthy balance of world
trade, guiding international investments into the most
productive fields.
Certain basic economic problems inadequate transpor¬
tation, lack of electric power, the need for agricultural
machinery and general agricultural development (flood
control, irrigation, land clearance, for instance) are
common to many countries. The World Bank concentrates
on loans to help wipe out these obstacles. And from tiny
El Salvador to giant India these loans are at work daily.
Since beginning its operations in the difficult period
following World War II, the Bank has helped member
nations to add almost ten million kilowatts to the electric
power capacity of the world. It has financed some fifty
railway, road and port improvement schemes and the
expansion of three international airlines. All told, the
World Bank has made 204 loans to 47 countries in the past
twelve years for a grand total of just under $4,000,000,000.
For each loan project, teams of Bank experts carefully
check the plan and all its ramifications before the loan
is actually granted. For the great. Kariba Dam project in
Africa, for example, experts spent the better part of
two years studying the Federation of Rhodesia's basic
problems and economic development before the Bank's
loan of $80 million was finally accorded. (See page 10.)
By concentrating on fundamental projects such as agri¬
culture, transportation and electric power, the Bank is
helping to build a solid floor under the economies of
almost half a hundred nations of the world. Although
universal economic development will require many years
to achieve, World Bank aid is a proven step toward that
goal. On pages 8-23, The Unesco Courier presents a few
projets which indicate the scope and purpose of World
Bank operations.

PUTTING MIGHTY
RIVERS TO WORK
MODERN VOLGA
'BOATMEN'
The Soviet Union is today the top-
ranking country of Europe and the
second in the world in the production
of hydro-electric energy, according to
the most recent survey, published in
July, by R.P. Nossov, head of the Soviet
Hydro-electric Construction Department
of the Ministry of Electric Stations.
With more than a million and a half
miles of rivers and waterways Soviet
energy potential exceeds that of all the
countries of Europe, the U.S.A. and
Canada combined, Mr. Nossov reports.
In the past ten years, dam construction
in the Soviet Union has been proceeding
at a colossal scale. Last year, the most
powerful dam in the world, with a capa¬
city of 2,100,000 kilowatts, went into
operation at Kuibychev on the Volga
river. The dam (shown on opposite
page) raised the level of the Volga by
1 00 feet and has an average annual
output of I 0,700 million kilowatt-hours.
This autumn an even more powerful dam
will go into operation when the first
turbines are installed at the Stalingrad
station with a capacity of 2,3 I 0,000 KW.
In the Ukraine, large hydro-electric
stations are being built at Kremchug and
Dneprodzerzhinsk. Seven dams are un¬
der construction on the Neman, the
largest river of the Baltic, while in
the Transcaucasus mountain rivers are
being harnessed.
But it is in Siberia and in Central Asia
that the most impressive work is now
in progress. Gigantic stations are going
up at Bratsk on the Angara river and at
Krasnoyarsk on the Yenisei, each of
which will produce 3,200,000 kilowatts.
The mighty Angara is the only outlet for
Lake Baikal, the deepest fresh-water lake
in the world and the world's second
largest in volume of water (23,000 mil¬
lion cubic metres). On the Yenisei,
another huge dam is now planned, the
Yeniseiskaya hydro-electric station, which
when completed will have a total capa¬
city of six million kilowatts.
Between 1959-1965, the Soviet Union
expects to complete its unified energy
system for the European part of the
USSR bringing its total electrical capa¬
city to 50 million kilowatts, while a
further 20 million kilowatts are foreseen
for eastern and western Siberia.

generators at Novosibirsk station, Siberia.

The Unesco Courier. August 1958
Rivers have tremendous power
for good or for destruction.
Uncontrolled, their recurring
floods lay waste the lands and cause
soil erosion, water pollution and often
widespread disease and famine. All
through the centuries large areas of
the world, in Asia especially, have
been impoverished in this way. Even
today more than one-fifth of the
human race is still subject to the
sudden and devastating onslaughts of
river flooding.
Yet when harnessed by modern en¬
gineering skill, the power of great
rivers can change the lives of whole
communities, turning scarcity into
plenty and creating virtually unlimit¬
ed opportunities for economic and so¬
cial progress. The multi-purpose de¬
velopment of river basins is making a
most important contribution towards
better living standards for millions of .
people. It provides for irrigation,
flood control and soil conservation,
electric power for industry and agri¬
culture, and improved navigation all
under one comprehensive scheme.
The benefits are permanent and may
be steadily extended ower a consider¬
able area.
There is now a world trend towards
this new concept of development as
a means of utilizing unproductive
lands, exploiting natural resources
and distributing population. Scienti
fic irrigation and flood control makes
agriculture on a hitherto unimagin-
ed scale practicable. Soil erosion is
halted by reafforestation schemes. An
abundant supply of hydro-electric
power attracts industry to undevelop¬
ed areas which may be rich in min-
rals or other raw materials. New
employment is created not only for
local communities but also for the
surplus populations of overcrowded
cities.
Multi-purpose river development is
by
W. H. Owens
practised on a large scale in the
U.S.A., where it has helped to open
up great areas of arid but otherwise
fertile lands. The huge Grand Coulee
Dam, centre of the Columbia River
Basin Project, is the key to future
industrial and agricultural progress
in the North-Western United States.
Its hydro-electric plant is able to
generate enough electricity to supply
the whole needs of a city of four
million people; its irrigation facilities
range over more than one million
acres. Regional population has in
creased twenty-fold since the scheme
began operating in 1941.
The world famous Hoover Dam
(formerly Boulder Dam) on the Colo¬
rado River, between Arizona and
Nevada, is another spectacular exam¬
ple of American multi-purpose river
planning, and is a vital factor today
in the development of the vast agri¬
cultural and growing industrial areas
in Southern California. Millions of
people and thousands of square miles
of fertile land are dependent on im¬
ported water. Giant conduits, cross¬
ing hundreds of miles of rugged
mountainous and desert country,
supply a thousand million gallons of
fresh water daily from the Colorado
River to between sixty and seventy
communities in the South California
Basin.
Nowhere in the world, perhaps, does
such imaginative utilization of rivers
promise greater rewards than in
countries like India and Pakistan,
and other regions of the East where
climate and uncontrolled water
courses have been a great hindrance
to human progress. The river valley
projects now under way or planned
will increase production and raise
living standards to a
far greater extent than
any other form of deve¬
lopment. Two of In¬
dia's largest power and

RIVERS
AT WORK
(Continued)
GREATEST SINGLE FACTOR
IN INDUSTRIAL GROWTH
irrigation schemes are the Hirakud
Dam in Orissa and the Bhakra Dam
in the Punjab. These are among the
modern engineering marvels of the
East and the most important of a
number of similar undertakings due
for completion in the course of the
Second Five Year Plan. They sym¬
bolize the new India and her deter¬
mination to make her rivers the basis
of future well-being and prosperity.
The Hirakud Dam, three miles long
and flanked by thirteen miles of pro¬
tective dikes, is a triumph of Indian
hydraulic engineers over the twin
scourges of flood and famine which
have been Orissa's burden down the
ages. Its 232,500 kW. generating ca¬
pacity will bring heavy industry, such
as steel-making and chemical plants,
to a State that has much unexploit-
ed mineral wealth.
Bhakra Dam is the keystone of the
Bhakra-Nangal Project that will
transform the Punjab into a great
food-producing and industrial area.
The massive 760-foot reinforced
concrete dam wall actually exceeds
that of the Hoover Dam in America
by 34 feet. The Damodar Valley Cor¬
poration Project, in Bihar, has been
modelled on that of the Tennessee
Valley Authority (U.S.A.) to develop
the very promising lands of a great
river basin near Calcutta.
Pakistan has comparable river de¬
velopments in her important foreign-
aided Karnafuli (East Pakistan) and
Warsak (West Pakistan) schemes.
The Warsak Project, which is being
financed largely by Canada, has spe¬
cial significance because it will bring
stability and purpose to the lives of
the tribal communities in the tradi¬
tionally unsettled region of the North¬
west Frontier. The irrigation part of
this scheme, extending over 120,000
acres, will increase food production
by at least 60,000 tons a year.
One of the most far-reaching deve¬
lopments of this kind in the world is
foreshadowed in the bold plan to
harness the mighty Mekong River of
South-East Asia. The Mekong flows
down from the remote, snow-covered
mountains in the heart of Tibet to
the South China Sea, a distance of
about 2,600 miles. The lower river
basin passes through four under¬
developed countries Cambodia, Laos,
Thailand and South Vietnam each
of which would benefit enormously if
the Mekong's power were controlled
and put to work for the good of the
inhabitants.
Towards the end of 1957 a United
Nations Survey Mission made an
extensive study tour through the
Mekong basin area. Members of the
Mission travelled nearly 2,000 miles
by road, river and air (making use of
helicopters in the remoter districts)
to study the natural features and
characteristics of the river, and to
investigate possible sites for dams,
barrages and so on. Their very detail¬
ed Report, published in January, 1958,
was favourable towards the multiple
development of this four-nation
watershed, and recommended a five-
year programme of investigation and
planning.
In many countries, especially where
coal resources are poor or lacking
altogether, the harnessing of water
power has been the most important
single factor in the growth of indus¬
try. Japan, for example, has insuffi¬
cient coal for her needs, but she has
become highly industrialized through
exploiting her abundant water power
to the fullest degree. Good rainfall
and a large number of swift-flowing
mountain streams provide the Japan¬
ese with ideal conditions for inten¬
sive hydro-development.
Similarly in Europe, Sweden and
Norway get more than 95 per cent
of the electrical energy for industry
from water power. Lacking coal of
their own, the Swiss have yoked their
mountain rivers and falls to the elec¬
trified national railway system and
most of their manufacturing indus¬
tries. Water power is also becoming
increasingly important to the nation¬
al economies of France and Italy.
The U.S.S.R., which has rich coal
deposits and other sources of power
besides, contains also more than a
third of the world's total water power
resources. Most of this lies in Asiatic
Russia and is for the greater part as
yet undeveloped though many im¬
portant power projects in the far east
of the Soviet Union have been under¬
taken in recent years. In the Euro¬
pean part of the country, more than
half the hydro power is located in the
Caucasus, and it has been extensively
developed.
Russia's famous Dnieper hydro¬
electric station, in the Ukraine
(restored since its destruction in the
second World War) was the most
powerful on earth when originally
opened in 1932. This huge project,
planned to meet the growing needs
of heavy industry in the Ukraine, was
designed also for irrigation purposes
and so was one of the prototypes of
multi-purpose river development out¬
side the U.S.A. Hydro-electric deve¬
lopment has naturally taken a promi¬
nent place in the recent Plans of the
Soviet Union. Last year, the giant
two-million kW Kuibychev Station
was put into operation. (See p. 4.)
In the next few years such major
projects as the large Stalingrad sta¬
tion on the Volga will be completed,
while a number of others along this
river and also on the Dnieper are in
progress.
Important hydro-electric stations
being constructed in Eastern Siberia,
a land of powerful rivers, include
those at Irkutsk, on the Angara, and
Krasnoyarsk, on the Yenisei. These
places are centres of heavy industry
supplying equipment for mining, agri¬
culture and railway and water trans¬
port in the far east of the U.S.S.R.
The immense water-power potential
of the Angara and the Yenisei will
be harnessed under a combined long-

3,000 foot drop
in ten miles
When the Lusitania was torpedoed in 1915,
among the 1,195 persons who perished was
an American engineer, Frederick Pearson, who
pioneered an audacious water power enterprise
in Mexico. At the start of the century, Pear¬
son heard of a tremendous waterfall, called
Necaxa, I 00 miles east of Mexico City, where
the river fell 3,000 feet in 10 miles in a series
of three gigantic steps. Pearson installed a power
plant at the foot of the first step; he built a
dam across the top of the fall, diverting the
water through pipes down 1,450 feet to a turbine
below. This involved the construction of what
was then the world's largest earth dam and the
longest transmission line in the world. Rather
than lead his water pipes down the mountain
side, Pearson dug a shaft straight down through
the mountain rock to its base. This shaft,
1,600 feet long, equipped with a cable car,
is still the only means of access to the power
plant below.
Pearson's death prevented him from exploiting
the two other falls. This was left to his succes¬
sors. Today power plants stand at all three falls.
" There can be few places in the world, "
official recently wrote, "where a given amount
of waterpower is so fully exploited. The quan¬
tity of water involved is very small... but the
total electrical energy it produces annually
already totals more than 7 50 million kilowatt-
hours in the three power stations. Mexico has
lost its Nexaca waterfalls, but it has gained the
sinews for its economic development."

term project for the exploitation of
Eastern Siberia's vast natural wealth.
Output of electrical energy in the
U.S.S.R. has grown impressively since
the last war, and is now second to
that of the U.S.A. On the outbreak
of World War H the total output of
all Soviet power stations, thermal and
hydraulic, amounted to about 50,000
million kW 25 times as much as in
1913. By 1955 it had more than
trebled again to 170,000 million kW,
and this figure is expected to be
almost doubled by 1960.
Canada provides a very striking
example of how a vigorous young
nation has built a flourishing indus¬
trial economy based on water power.
Her industries have grown up simul¬
taneously with the harnessing of just
a part of the virtually unlimited
power resources invested in the coun¬
try's innumerable lakes and rivers.
The gigantic power of the Niagara
Falls, for example, nowadays runs a
large part of industry in Ontario, the
most highly industrialized province
in Canada. Since the early part of
this century hydro-electric capacity
in Canada has increased more than
one hundred-fold, the most rapid pro¬
gress having taken place within the
last fifteen years. Even so, the coun¬
try's water power potential is still less
than one quarter developed.
In the heart of tropical Africa, too,
water power is beginning to be
exploited on a large scale to serve
new towns and new industries in
what was nothing but primitive
wilderness not so many years ago.
On the great Zambezi River, which
the explorer Livingstone reached just
over a century ago, a 420-ft. high dam
is now under construction to create
the world's largest man-made lake
(See page 10). Power generated at
this dam will be carried by overhead
transmission cables to many areas of
Central Africa where new economic
developments are under way, and in
particular to the important copper
mines on the frontier of Northern
Rhodesia and the Belgian Congo. The
output of these African copper mines
is at present exceeded only by that
from the copper deposits in Chile.
With the new power supplied by the
Zambezi scheme they are capable of
great expansion.
The advantages of producing elec¬
tricity by hydro methods are long-
term cheapness and dependence on
no raw material other than water,
which is unfailing. Capital costs are
certainly heavy at the outset, espe¬
cially for countries which are as yet
in the early stages of development.
But placing of an initial invest¬
ment ensures abundant supplies of
low-cost power over a wide area for
an indefinite period. Once the capital
charges have been worked off, the
actual cost of running a hydro plant
is considerably lower than that of a
fuel plant.
Moreover, as has been shown, the
same dam works provide the means
for such other purposes as irrigation,
flood control, and water supply for
local or distant towns and commun¬
ities. Nor is that all. The multi¬
farious benefits of comprehensive river
development range beyond the utili¬
tarian and may include the establish¬
ment of national parks for recreation
and wild life preservation.

MODERN
PYRAMIDS
The ancients created their great wonders of the worldthe Pyramids of Egypt, the Hanging
Gardens of Babylon, the Temple of Diana at Ephesus, the Statue of Zeus at Olympia, the
Mausoleum at Halicarnassus, the Lighthouse at Alexandria, and the Colossus at Rhodes.
Amazing as were these wonders of antiquity, they pale before the wonders of modern times.
The Hanging Gardens and the Pharos at Alexandria sink into insignificance before the skyscra¬
pers, span bridges and public buildings of today. The Pyramids, mighty as they are, are
equalled by the "pyramids" of our own century, the towering dams and barrages which are
harnessing rivers for the benefit of millions of common people and opening up unsuspected
perspectives of economic and social development for vast regions of the earth still little deve¬
loped. These great feats of engineering and architectural skill, however, usually require
fabulous sums of money which many States are unable to provide by themselves, and it is in
part through international co-operation and the help accorded, by a Specialized Agency of the
United Nations, the International Bank for Reconstruction and Development, that many of
the "modern pyramids" are being built today. Below, a "modern pyramid" rises in Austria.

Ten million acres of land put to work for men, crops and livestock.
This is the goal that the Cassa per il Mezzogiorno, an Italian government
agency, has set itself as part of a massive fifteen-year development
programme under way since 19 50 in the nation's southern provinces
and islands. Italy's greatest economic problem for many years has been
the poverty and backwardness of this region, supporting a third of the
Italian people, where flash floods in winter and droughts in summer have
long been the rule. A total of $3,200 million has been allotted the
Cassa mainly for irrigation, transportation and sanitation, and additional
sums are being used for industrial and electric power development.
The World Bank is helping the Italian Government in this huge
project and has made five important loans totalling S240 million.
Pipes are being laid across miles of countryside, and carried by tunnels

through the hills. Forty-four aqueducts are either completed or under
construction. In the outskirts of Naples, Italian engineers are cons¬
tructing a reservoir (to be ready this year) with a capacity of I 8 million
gallons. Irrigation canals are being built to bring water to the dry
farmlands. In Sicily, particularly in the Catania plain, where the
problems are similar to those on the southern mainland, what the
land needs most is water. In the hills behind the plain water is
plentiful and the Italians have already built one dam for producing
electricity and as a water-store for irrigation. A second reservoir and
a new dam are under construction (the Pozzillo Dam shown in photo
above) and will store enough water to feed I 500 farms. From the
start of operations in I 950 to end I 9 57 farm output in southern region
has increased by some 40% and industrial production by about 50%.

THE UNTAMED
ZAMBEZI
STRIKES
BACK
Ever since David Livingstone came across it in 1855,
the Zambezi River has inspired visions in the minds
of engineers. Untamed since the becinnine of time,
its mighty waters surge through the heart of Central
Africa until, at one point, they are suddenly precipi¬
tated in a deafening roar that can be heard for 20 miles
into the most formidable cataract in the world the Vic¬
toria Falls. From there the Zambezi's waters are carried
away in a tortuous and turbulent course through a series
of steep gorges which form the boundary of Northern
and Southern Rhodesia.
It is in one of these gorges, at a spot called Kariba
Gorge about 300 miles downstream from Victoria Falls,
that the largest dam in Africa and one of the greatest
power schemes in the world, is being built by the Fede¬
ration of Rhodesia and Nyasaland. The Kariba Dam is
going up with help of an $80,000,000 loan from the World
Bank the largest it has ever made for a single project.
When completed, the Kariba arch dam will contain
1,400,000 cubic yards of concrete and will rise 420 feet
above the river bed just about as high as the U.N.
skyscraper in New York. A roadway, 1,900 feet long,
will carry four lanes of traffic on the crest of the dam.
Such is the flow of the Zambezi at Kariba Gorge that
the reservoir behind the dam will flood 2,000 square miles
of bush country, creating the biggest man-made lake in
the world, 190 miles long and up to 40 miles wide more
than four times the capacity of the Hoover Dam in Amer¬
ica, at present the world's biggest artificial lake.

A few days after this picture was taken in March 1958, the swirling flood waters of the Zambezi River broke over the wall of the coffer dam erected
in midstream for the giant Kariba Dam hydro-electric power station being built In the Federation of Rhodesia and Nyasaland (photo of flooded coffer
dam is shown next page). For the Kariba Dam, one of the world's most ambitious engineering projects, the International Bank for Reconstruction
and Development has made loans totalling S80 million, the World Bank's largest loan in Africa, and its largest for a single undertaking to date.
By 1960, water from this artificial lake will be released
to turn the turbines of six 100,000 kilowatt generators
with a full potentiality of nearly 4,000 million kilowatt-
hours per year. By 1972 installations are scheduled to be
completed for generating 1,200,000 kilowatts. Two under¬
ground power stations are being hewn out of the rock
on either side of_the Zambezi for the turbines. Nearly
1,000 miles of transmission lines will be laid to feed elec¬
tricity to the power-starved copper belt of Northern
Rhodesia and the mushrooming industrial ' cities of
Southern Rhodesia.
Today, when more than ever before, man is trying to
control nature, the Zambezi is a logical candidate for
development. Ever since World War II and even before
then, countless people in government and out of govern¬
ment, scientists, engineers, economists, officials and
businessmen, have been studying the Zambezi, and more
important still, studying the territories and the people
that the river is made to serve.
These territories aré the rich but sparsely populated
countries of the Federation of Rhodesia and Nyasaland.
Covering an enormous area of over 450,000 square miles,
the Federation came into existence five years ago and
has a status close to that of the independent members
of the British Commonwealth. Its population numbers,
little more than seven million people, of which 250,000
are Europeans.
Few people realize that the Rhodesian Federation has
the fastest growing economy of any country in the
world ! Between 1950 and 1955 the national income of
all three regions combined more than doubled itself.
Imports, worth approximately $70 million in 1946 are
now running to something like $450 million, while exports
show a correspondingly spectacular jump in value.
Northern Rhodesia contains the great copper belt of
Africa and now rivals Chile as the world's largest copper
producer. Other mineral products, such as gold, lead,
asbestos, chrome and coal, are now being exploited. In
Southern Rhodesia, in addition to crop exports (tobacco
is the nation's second export item) local manufacturing
industries have show fantastic growth in the past few
years. At Bulawayo, for instance, 300 factories were regis¬
tered in 1957, principally metalworking, machinery and
motor engineering establishments.
Mining and industry now consume 78 per cent of the
power produced in the Federation and much larger quan¬
tities are essential for their continued expansion. In
Southern Rhodesia all urban and industrial centres
depend on electric power. Since there is no gas supply,
all essential services, including water supply in the large
cities, are electrically operated, and power rationing has
been required in recent years.
Power for the copper 'miñes iñ Northern
Rhodesia comes mainly from coal found
only at the western tip of Southern Rho¬
desia. It thus has to be transported two to
five hundred miles over a single-track rail-

EPIC OF MEXICO'S
GREAT FAR WEST
The northwest coast of Mexico runs
from a point on the Pacific
Ocean west of Guadalajara all the
way to Arizona, for the most part bor¬
dering the shores of the Gulf of Cali¬
fornia. Along most of this coast exten¬
sive flat plains rise abruptly to the foot¬
hills of the great Sierra Madre. The
winter snows on its peaks and the rains
in the wet season flood down across the
coastal plain through more than 25 riv¬
ers rivers whose courses are short and
swift and whose water is usually exhaust¬
ed in flash floods within a few days or
weeks.
Until recently, cultivation was confin¬
ed to small areas in the immediate vici¬
nity of the river valleys. There were
large ranches in the foothills of the
Sierra but the coastal plain itself for
most of the year was a hot, arid land of
cactus and brush. No one could have
predicted that this largely desert region
would come to bloom like a rose.
Sitting ducks
for bandits
It is here that the story of the Paci¬
fico Railway takes place a railroad
which after one life of 70 years was
reborn in November 1957 to meet the
challenges of a new world.
The first rail outlet for Mexico's
northwest was completed in 1882. The
line ran . 250 miles northwards from
Guaymas, a port on the Gulf of
California, to the Arizona border near
Tucson, transporting mainly cattle and
hides from the extensive ranching
country.
Over the years the railway crept
southward, first from Guaymas to Cu-
liacan, then down to the Pacific port of
Mazatlan. The many bridges on the
coastal plain were an invitation to ban¬
dits during the years of revolution and
counter-revolution between 1910 and
1920. A sure way to make the train a
sitting duck was to blow a bridge behind
it and another in front of it. Then it
could be looted at leisure. Further ex¬
tensions had to await more peaceful
times.
To add to the difficulties, the next
stage, from Mazatlan southwards, meant
leaving the flat coastal lands and climb¬
ing abruptly through the mountains to
Tepic. In this section the track climbs
3,000 feet in less than 30 miles. It was
not until 1927 that the final stretch to
Guadalajara was opened; it was one of
the world's most difficult railroad
construction operations, for it includes
25 tunnels in 20 miles of track. And
when there were no tunnels to dig the
line had to be thrown across chasms a
14
by George R. Young
thousand feet deep to regain a foothold
on the mountainsides.
With all these difficulties, the railroad
was the principal means by which Mexi¬
co's west received its main shipments of
American equipment and machinery in
the first half of this century. The re¬
turn traffic came gradually to include
more and more agricultural produce as
the irrigation possibilities of the coastal
plain were slowly explored. The real
surge forward came after World War II.
Indeed, people say that there has been
more development on the northwest
coast since 1950 than in the previous
300 years. Irrigation was intensified.
This was pump irrigation which requir-.
ed larger quantities of electric power
and more elaborate transmission sys¬
tems. The World Bank, through a loan
of $29.7 million helped to provide the
extra power. Large storage dams were
built. There are now eight of these on
the northwest coast and plans are ready
for five more. These in turn will be
followed by yet another seven.
One way or another the cultivated
area of the Mexican northwest coast was
lifted from a total of half a million acres
in 1925 to three million acres in 1957.
Where only a few years ago the arid
plain stretched to the sea, there is now
mile upon mile of crops growing like
the patches on a quilt cotton, maize,
sugarcane, vegetables and fruit.
This is the new granary of Mexico.
But it is more than a granary; it is also
becoming an important industrial area.
The city of Guadalajara, the southern
terminus of the Pacifico Railway, al¬
ready has 750,000 inhabitants and is the
second city of Mexico, with industry of
all kinds being established around it.
Obregon, halfway between Guadalajara
and the U.S. border, had not a single
cotton gin in 1950. Now it has about
50 and five cottonseed oil plants. Gay-
mas has seen great development as a
port since it is from there that the cotton
bales are shipped to foreign markets.
Huffing & puffing
choo-choo trains
All this development came at a bad
time for the railroad. The lo¬
comotives were all steam engines
of ancient vintage and in such bad
condition that they frequently had to be
changed four times in a hundred miles.
The track, laid many years before with
rail too light for modern heavy opera¬
tions was worn out to the point where
derailments were of, daily occurence..
Bridges were in an advanced state of
disrepair and fell easy prey to flooding
rivers. In fact, things were so bad that
in May 1952 it took, on an average, 29
days for a freight car loaded with copper
from the mines of Cananea to reach
Guadalajara, 1,170 miles away.
It was at this point that negotiations
were completed for the transfer of the .
Pacifico Railway (from an American
company which held the lease) to the
Mexican Government, for 12 million
dollars. Ferrocarril del Pacifico, as the
new line was renamed, then embarked
on one of the most spectacular railroad
rehabilitation operations of this century.
Spectacular
'face lifting'
As a first step in 1952, a New York
firm made a complete survey of
the needs of the railroad on which
was based the rehabilitation programme,
including track, bridges, locomotives,
rolling stock, and communications. The
programme was estimated to need four
years to complete at a cost of about
80 million dollars.
A number of short-term loans were
obtained, but it was clear that the task
called for long-term financing. The
Mexican Government approached the
World Bank. After thorough investiga¬
tion, the Bank, in August 1954 made a
15-year loan to the Pacifico Railway of
61 million dollars.
One of the first and largest contracts
financed out of the Bank loan was for
2,000 miles of new rail from a Canad¬
ian company. Nearly 1,000 steel box¬
cars were ordered from a Mexican com¬
pany. Large numbers of diesel locomo¬
tives, freightcars and other equipment
were purchased in the United States.
The work on the track had to be car¬
ried out quickly and while the line was
in daily use by traffic. The rails had
to be replaced along the entire 1,100
miles of the track. Three and a half
million wooden ties had to be renewed,
and new ballast applied to the roadbed
throughout its entire length. During
the most intensive periods of this work
there were 1,825 men engaged in recon¬
struction, in addition to the 2,000 em¬
ployees of the railroad who also partici¬
pated. Bridge and trestle repairs were
another large task, and permanent struc¬
tures had to be built to replace the tem¬
porary sections in the
bridges over several of
the largest rivers.
By the end of 1957
this work was virtually

Running like a worn-out thread over a thousand miles from Guadalajara in the south to the U.S. border near Tucson, Arizona, Mexico's Pacifico
Railwaylifeline of the nation's swiftly expanding northwest regionwas in a precarious state only a few years ago. On long stretches, the tracks had
buckled and tie plates were lacking. Most of the embankments were washed out or had simply disappeared, locomotives and rolling stock were sadly
outmoded, and train schedules were chaotic. Thanks in part to a S 6 I million loan from the. World Bank, the Pacifico stands today as one of the most
striking railroad modernization operations of our century. While the line was in daily use, the rails were replaced along the entire 1,1 00 miles
of track, four million wooden ties were renewed, and new ballast applied to roadbed throughout its entire length. A thousand boxcars and sixty diesel
trains were purchased. Below, line being relaid and re-located to do away with extreme curves Above, tracks before modernization.

complete. In addition, an entirely new
communications system had been install¬
ed throughout the length of the railroad,
with automatic telephone offices at the
main centres.
But re-laying the track and providing
the necessary communications was only
half the battle. The railroad also need¬
ed new equipment. The decision to
transfer from steam to diesel elec¬
tric locomotion was taken early,
and the transfer is now complete.
Most of the old locomotives have al¬
ready been broken up and sold as scrap
to the steel mills, but there are still one
or two graveyards of these rusty monsters
to be seen awaiting breaking-up in the
maintenance workshops. Altogether, 64
new diesel locomotives were purchased,
1,644 steel boxcars, and 78 passenger
and mail cars were added to the rolling
stock.
A new artery
for new wealth
Copper from Cananea now reaches
Guadalajara in eight days. Agri¬
cultural produce which took
49 days for a journey in 1949, takes
three days in 1958. In 1952, a merchant
shipping goods on the Pacifico railway
would take out a 30-day shipping credit
from his bank to finance him until the
goods reached their destination. As the
end of the month drew nearer and
nearer, he would be on the telephone to
the railroad several times a day seeking
information about his shipment, and
often in vain, for headquarters probably
did not even know where the shipment
was. ' i ". '
Railroad officials now take gleeful
pleasure in the fact that they mail the
invoice to the shipper as soon as they
receive his freight, for shipment, and
very often they have to telephone him
to collect his goods from their destina¬
tion, more than a thousand miles from
the departure .point, even before the
invoice has reached him in the post.
When the World Bank loan to the
Pacifico Railway was signed in 1954 it
was the largest that the Bank had made
up to then for a single project! Three
years later the railroad was rebuilt and
operating on a commercial basis. Meas¬
ured in concrete terms, this is one of the
most striking success stories associated
with a World Bank loan, in Mexico
or anywhere else.
For the Pacific Railway is no less
than a new artery for Mexico, an artery
along which can flow a stream of new
wealth for which few in the country
would have dared to hope.

ZAMBEZI
(Continued from p. 1 1)
way to the copper belt. An expensive
alternative is burning wood or im¬
porting coal from overseas via Angola.
Because of this situation, the Gov¬
ernment of the Federation in 1953
decided to turn to hydro-electric
power. The Zambezi became a logical
candidate for power development.
Studies showed that a hydro-electric
station at Kariba Gorge would pro¬
vide enough power to meet expected
requirements of the entire Federation
until about 1970, and would relieve
the pressure on the railroads by re¬
ducing coal haulage for power sta¬
tions, now one million tons a year. It
was estimated that $225 million would
be required to start construction on
the giant Zambezi dam.
Work at Kariba began in 1956
shortly after the World Bank had
granted the Federation its $80 million
loan. But the untamed Zambezi was
apparently determined not to give in
without a good fight.
In 1957, the African rainy season
flooded to extraordinary heights,
wiping out a great part of the work
that had been done on the prelimi¬
nary coffer dams.
After the floods had subsided, the
walls of the coffer dams were doubled
in height and work proceeded on
schedule despite the damage. Then
came the rains of 1958. This time the
Zambezi outdid itself. Passing well
above the flood peak of last year, the
Zambezi unleashed 450,000 cubic feet
of water a second into the Kariba
Gorge. Desperate measures were
taken but, almost as if it were laugh¬
ing at these efforts, the great river
drove the full force of its pounding
fury against the enormous concrete
blocks of the coffer dams and against
two bridges built across the river.
The tremendous pressure cracked fis¬
sures in the base of the coffer dams,
which began to fill rapidly. Soon, too,
the swirling waters poured right over
the top of the central dam block
throwing twisted sprays of water 20
feet into the air. The road bridge
buckled in the middle, toppled into
the swirling waters in two sections,
and was swept downstream.
As a United Nations reporter, Allan
House, commented the event in a re¬
cent U.N. broadcast : "It was an in¬
credible sight. Geologists, old timers
on the African rivers, and chiefs in
the African villages that line the
Zambezi say the flood is one that
would occur only once in ten thous¬
and years.
"Almost as quickly as it had risen,
the great river dropped again, and
work was set about pumping out the
coffer dams in readiness to lay a new
dam base... The walls are being thick¬
ened and raised even higher despite
the fact that everyone agrees on the
impossibility of a greater flood next
year. Additional labour force has
already been set to work to bring the
construction of the Kariba Dam back
on schedule, and the officials of the
World Bank are confident that des¬
pite the efforts of the old Zambezi to
wash it down the drain, their $80 mil¬
lion is safe, and will fulfil its useful
purpose."

ONE OF
GRANDEST VIEWS
OF CENTRAL
EUROPE
The dam construction engineer is closely bound up with
nature. His work is carried out not in the laboratory or
workshop but in wild natural surroundings, the beauty and
harmony of which he makes every effort to preserve. Although
a rising dam is inevitably accompanied by a mass of rubble
and sometimes unsightly disorder, the completed dam in
almost every case adds a touch of stylistic beauty to the majes¬
tic natural scene.
Aerial photograph, right, shows a remarkable view of three
recently-completed dams in their magnificent setting of the
Glockner-Tauern range in southern Austria's Tyrol : Llmberg
dam (foreground), Mooser dam (right) Drossen dam (left).
The summit of Mount Grossglockner, rising to 12,460 feet
(3,798 metres) nearby, affords one of the grandest views
to be had in Central Europe.
Before the last World War, the Austrian Alps were one of Eu¬
rope's chief remaining undeveloped natural resources. Today,
with dams and power stations dotting its mountain lakes and
rivers, Austria is well on the way to becoming the " Interna¬
tional Power Station" of Central Europe. Austria already
exports power to Italy and Germany, and other European
countries and the Ruhr are prospective future customers.
In I 947 all electric power companies in Austria were nation¬
alized, and the Austrian Electric Power Corporation (Ver¬
bundsgesellschaft) set up under government's auspices. With
its affiliated companies, the Verbundsgesellschaft and other
public corporations today operate almost 80 per cent of Aus¬
tria's total electric power. The World Bank has made five
loans to Austria for electric power development totalling
$56 million. These loans are helping to add 630,000 kilo¬
watts to the country's installed capacity.
One $12 million loan is for the great Reisseck-KreuzecTîla'nT
project, south of the Glockner-Tauern range. Four natural
lakes high in the Reisseck mountains will be made to serve
as reservoirs. The height of these reservoirs provides a head
on the turbines of some 5,500 feet, the highest in the world.

In I9S4, after 60 hours of continuous rain, the "gentle" Danube rose to heights rarely known in history, flooding several Austrian provinces. After
the last war, a multi-nation Danube Committee was set up for river development as well as flood control. The Jochenstein dam was completed by
Austria and Germany jointly in 1956. Fifteen dams are now planned by Austria's engineers on the 213 mile stretch of the Austrian Danube.
One of largest is World Bank-financed Ybbs-Persenbeug dam (left below), 80 miles from Vienna. Its six turbines will generate 192,000 kW. Also

THE ROOTS OF PREJUDICE
How children come to have racial bias
by Arnold M. Rose
(3)
In this issue we continue ihe serialization begun in June of "The Roots of Prejudice",
published by Unesco in its series "The Race Question in Modern Science". (See
bibliography page 35). In this article, Professor Rose discusses transmission of prejudice
to children, and the "Scapegoat" theory which he compares to the desire to kick a
chair on the part of people frustrated or stopped from doing something they want to do.
It is customary in countries where racism prevails to
assume that it is natural and inevitable that one group
should disdain or look up to another. We have already
seen that prejudice is frequently & result of deliberate
propaganda: yet the fact that it is often found in fairly
young children gives rise to the incorrect assumption that
it is inborn. Actually, prejudice is learned. Studies show
that it can be learned by children as young as four years
old.
The teaching of prejudice takes place in the same
informal manner in which other aspects of non-material
culture are taught. Children may be taught prejudice by
their parents, their teachers, their friends, their Sunday
school teachers. Parents are the most important
influence. While some parents do not want their children
to be prejudiced, others teach prejudice to their children
because they themselves grew up to believe that it was
proper and natural. Parents teach prejudice to their
children by their own behaviour, by their expressions of
disgust, by forbidding certain associations, by their choice
of observations, by their indications as to what is humo¬
rous or degrading, and so on.
Sometimes older people will even make fun of children
to get them to be prejudiced. But much of the time older
people do not realize that they are teaching prejudice
to children. At the dinner table, while the children are
listening, a mother will tell her husband about her
troubles with the Negro or Polish maid. Not only do the
children absorb this, but they also come to imitate her
behaviour towards the maid, which unconsciously
expresses her prejudice in almost every act.
At church or Sunday school, Christian children may
learn from the Bible story that "the Jews" killed Christ.
Biblical scholars point out that only a few Jews were
against Jesus, and that most of them thought He was a
good religious teacher. It was the Romans who punished
people at that time and they believed He was dangerous
to their government. But Sunday school teachers do not
always point out these facts.. To make matters much
worse, they sometimes identify the people of ancient
Palestine with the Jews living in present-day Europe and
America; and transfer the blame for a crime that hap¬
pened two thousand years ago on to people who are living
today. Other religious and folk teaching has similar
myths which promote prejudice in children.
Some school text-books help to create prejudice. Sur¬
veys in several countries have revealed that text-books,
especially history books, give derogatory descriptions of
people of other nations and disparage minority groups
within the nation itself. An immigrant group, for
instance, is not usually described in terms of what its
members hold dear and consider proper. Rather, the
immigrant group is judged by the standards of the
majority group. People may be loyal, hard-working,
kindly and ambitious, but if they are poor and ignorant
and have not yet learned the customs of their adopted
nation, they are looked down on in some text-books as
well as by most of the native-born people.
24
Older children teach prejudice to younger ones.
Children quickly develop rules about all sorts of things,
and each member of the neighbourhood gang is expected
to follow the rules. If prejudice is one of the "rules" in
the community, older children are sometimes even more
forceful than parents in teaching prejudice to younger
children. Sometimes they make up stories about how
dangerous or stupid members of minority groups are.
These stories are imaginative child's play, but their effect
can be very powerful in determining future attitudes.
One study of prejudice among adults showed that quite
a number of people claimed that their prejudice arose
from bad childhood experiences. But when the stories
were examined more closely, it Was found that the
incidents were not known to have actually happened, but
where mostly scare stories circulating among the local
children. The number of crimes committed by Negroes,
Mexicans, and other minorities is actually much smaller
than many people think.
Like games, swear words,
and good or bad manners
Thus we see how children, and adults, learn prejudice.
Like most other things, they learn it from * each
other, and especially is it true that the. old teach the
young. As it passes on from generation to generation, it
changes a little. It comes to be applied to new minority
groups, and once in a while it ceases to be directed at
what were formerly minority groups. . Sometimes it grows
stronger and sometimes it gets weaker. But it is always
taught in the same 'way as games, good manners, swear
words, or anything else in the non-material culture.
The teaching of prejudice is, of course, not inevitable.
Some parents, even those who live in dominantly prej¬
udiced cultures, bring up their children to be broad-
minded and free from prejudice. Also, children and
adults who have been taught prejudice can un-learn it.
Wise parents, teachers, friends, and books can explain
the errors and dangers of prejudice. General education
or a religious or humanitarian impulse can lead to a
self-examination which sometimes dissolves prejudice.
Thus far we have been considering prejudice in its
rational aspects as serving a certain purpose, or as a
result of ignorance or as a kind of tradition which is
learned. There is also an irrational function which it
fulfils, for it apparently satisfies a psychological need.
This is a very important factor, for without it prejudice
might die a natural death after a few generations, if
people realized that they were dupes of a few persons
who exploited prejudice or that they were blind followers
of a harmful tradition.
People have different theories as to what constitutes
the psychological basis of prejudice. Some of the theories
have been disproved by scientific studies by psychologists
and sociologists, yet are still believed by many people.

<![CDATA[
One such idea is that prejudice always arises instinc¬
tively against people who are different. This may be
called the "dislike of differences" theory. When some
people are asked why they dislike Negroes, they will say
it is because Negroes are so black and dirty, or because
Negroes are dangerous. Others will say they do not dis¬
like Negroes, but that you cannot treat a Negro as you
can a white man, because a Negro is like a child or an
minimal and cannot act like a man. All these statements
are expressions of prejudice. They assume that there is
something about the minority group which naturally
causes the majority group to regard it as inferior.
There are several things wrong with the "dislike of
differences" theory:
It does not explain the stereotyping that goes with
prejudice. Many Negroes are no more dangerous or
¿iirty than many white men. Most Negroes are not
even black, and a few are so light-skinned that they
can pass as whites. If Negroes do not always behave
like fully responsible people, that in itself is partly
due to prejudice. Even if the prejudiced person main¬
tains that most Negroes have these undesirable traits,
he will admit that -there are exceptions. Yet he is
prejudiced against the exceptions too.
There are a lot of differences among people against
which there is no prejudice. And there are many
places in the world where people of different races and
religions live together without prejudice. Red hair is
just as striking a characteristic as dark skin, and yet
few people have prejudice against people with red hair.
The "dislike of differences" theory does not explain
the fact that prejudiced people make contradictory
statements about those against whom they are prej¬
udiced. Prejudiced people say they dislike Jews
because the latter are "always trying to push them¬
selves into places where they are not wanted", and
also because "Jews are clannish; they keep to them¬
selves". Prejudiced people observe that "Negroes are
lazy, and have no ambition" and yet they are the first
to strike down a Negro who tries to secure education
or a better job or home.
Another largely fallacious, theory of prejudice is that
people become prejudiced because of unpleasant exper¬
iences with members of minority groups. It is true that
bad experience with a person can make one dislike
that person ever afterwards. But- why should the dislike
be turned to all people with the same colour of skin or
same accent? If a fat person does one some harm,
one does not forever thereafter hate all fat people. If one
has a quarrel with a member of the Baptist church, one
does not feel the need to fight all Baptists. Obviously, a
lot more is needed to explain prejudice.
Kicking a chair in anger,
or the 'scapegoat', theory
One of the most important steps in understanding
prejudice was taken when the psychologists develop¬
ed the "frustration-aggression" theory. In simpler
language this is called the "scapegoat" theory. It is based
on a great deal of sound scientific knowledge. Studies of
human behaviour have shown, that some people are
steadily prevented from doing the things they want to
do and are consequently not happy. This is called
"frustration". Then they are likely to strike at something
or try to make somebody else unhappy. That is, they
become "aggressive". When, as often happens, a person
cannot hit back at the specific thing that makes him
unhappy, he finds a substitute. . Among the ancient
Hebrews, there was a periodical ceremony of driving into
the desert a goat "burdened with the sins of Israel" to
perish there. We still use the term "scapegoat" to refer
to an innocent substitute who gets punished for someone's
troubles or anger.
Everyone uses a scapegoat. An occasional action, when
we are stopped from doing something we want to do or
become angry for some reason, is to kick a chair or other
convenient object or throw something on the floor. Small
children do this frequently. Little harm is done if the
scapegoat is not a living creature, but sometimes a man
will beat a dog or a child, not so much because of what
the dog or child did as because the man is angry about
something else. One who is reprimanded by his employer
will sometimes come home and pick a fight with his wife.
The Unesco Courier. August 1958
He cannot talk back to his employer so he vents his anger
upon his wife. The dog, the child, and the wife are
scapegoats, and they suffer because they are scapegoats.
Occasionally a whole group of people, perhaps a whole
country, feels frustrated. Perhaps such people do not
know what the trouble is, or perhaps they do know but
there is nothing that can be done about it. They may
feel frustrated by bad economic conditions, unemploy¬
ment, low pay, as many Americans in the Southern
States have been for a long time. Or they may feel
frustrated by failure to become the leading nation of the
world, as the Germans were after losing World War L
Nothing they do seems to bring prosperity or glory to
their land, and so they take it out on a scapegoat. It
is frequently a low grade politician who says "Here is
your scapegoat. It's the cause of your trouble. Kick it
and you'll feel better." According to the theory we are
considering, this is why there has been so much prejudice
and violence against Negroes in the American South, and
against Jews in Nazi Germany.
Learning to put up with
inevitable frustrations
In any country, some people feel more frustrated than
others. Some people are unable to earn even the
basic necessities of life. Others get these, but fail to
achieve higher ambitions. Some children are frustrated
by not doing well at games, or by not getting enough
affection or support from their parents. Some children
feel that they are unfairly treated by teachers. There are
various ways of meeting frustrations:
By trying to eliminate the frustrations.
By keeping away from the things that are frustrating.
+ By understanding the inevitable character of the frus¬
tration and deciding that it is necessary to put up
with it, at least for a while.
By refusing to realize the cause of the frustration, and
taking it out on some scapegoat.
Certain politicians benefit by leading people to scape¬
goats. One thing that helped Hitler to secure power in
Germany was his persuading the German people that the
Jews were the cause of all their troubles. In South Africa
politicians are sometimes elected to office after a cam¬
paign devoted merely to raising white people's fears about
Negroes. Some writers and radio speakers become popular
and wealthy by telling people to hate the bankers, or the
English, or the Jews. This may sound odd to anyone who
looks at the situation objectively; but it does not sound
odd to people who have troubles and do not know what
to do about them. They feel a little better by having a
scapegoat, just as each one of us feels better by kicking
or pounding something when we are angry.
Thus, people often follow the politicians who make
them feel better. But having a scapegoat does not really
solve any problems. In fact, people are steered away
from the solution of their real problems when they have
a scapegoat. The only one who benefits is the politician
or the writer, as he gains power over the whole people by
being the leader in kicking the helpless scapegoat.
During times of business depression, when many people
are unhappy and frustrated, there is an increase in
violence against Negroes in the Southern States of the
United States. The big depression of the 1930s saw the
birth, in the United States, of 114 organizations which
spent their time and money in spreading hate against
Jews. Similar organizations were started by pro-Germans
in all the free countries of Europe some of them by
agents of Nazi Germany, and others by people who hoped
to benefit by German domination of the world.
The leaders of these organizations hoped to get control
of the governments of their countries by following the
anti-Semitic propaganda- that had been so successful in
Germany. They did not achieve all their aims Hitler
was finally defeated but they did succeed in creating
hatred and fear of Jews. It is known that many of these
same people are now waiting for the next depression or
the next war to come along so that they can finish their
work. They know how to use frustrating conditions for
their own advantage.

Science has the answer
SOME ANIMALS SLEEP ALL WINTER-
HOW DO THEY LIVE WITHOUT EATING?
by Gerald Wendt
The ability to hibernate is a peculiar one, shared by
only a few mammals, and two species of birds. It
involves much more than just a long sleep from the
first cold of the autumn to the first warmth of spring.
The animal's body temperature actually falls to within a
few degrees of freezing point. Yet the heart continues to
pump blood through the arteries and veins, although the
human heart ceases to function when it is chilled. The
animal is nourished by its body fats even at a temperature
such that the fats are hard and immobile. The unusual
physiology of the true hibernators is under study at Har¬
vard University (U.S.A.) by Dr. Charles F. Lyman.
His experiments were made with the golden hamster a
species of rodent. Other animals that go into this
profound state of depressed existence for the winter are
the hedgehog, marmot, woodchuck, the dormouse, the
European and. the Arctic ground squirrel, a few varieties
of bats and, among birds, the hummingbird and the whip-
poorwill.
Eight heart beats per minute
The hamster enters this state at any time of the year
when he is kept in a room at 41 "F. His own body
temperature goes down to about a degree above the
room temperature, his heart beat is reduced to eight or
nine per minute, he takes less than 10 breaths per minute,
his blood pressure is extremely low and his rate of meta¬
bolism (using nourishment to maintain life) drops to 3%
or even 1% of normal. He is, of course, unconscious and
in a state of extreme torpor. But if the temperature of
the room drops below freezing point his metabolism in¬
creases three or fourfold so that he manages to keep his
body temperature at 37.4°F.
At this low temperature the hamster's nerves still
function although the nerves of a non-hibernating ani¬
mal, such as the rat, are insensitive and useless when
they are cooled below 50°F. Thus the little animal can be
wakened by prodding him with a finger or a stick of wood.
But it takes about three hours for him to awaken fully.
After about an hour he takes about 35 breaths per minute
and his body temperature has gone up to 50°F. Within
two hours he breathes over 100 times a minute, his pulse
is up to 550 beats per minute and his body temperature is
86°F. At this point he begins to try to stand but he can¬
not yet control his muscles. After two and a half to three
hours he is at last at a normal temperature of 98°F. and
is normal in behaviour.
Very fat before hibernating
By testing the cortex of the animal's brain, Dr. Lyman
showed that its activity ceases When its temperature
drops below 68°F, although its sensory nerves are
alert far below that point. This explains why muscular
control is lost early in the process of falling asleep and
returns only in the last stages of awakening. Another
mystery in hibernation is the ability of the hamster to
change his solid body fats into other forms that are semi-
liquid, like butter, when the body temperature is near
freezing point. Without this ability hibernating animals
would not be able to maintain themselves on their body
fat in place of food. Many of them beconie very fat before
they go to sleep. The hamster does not, but wakes several
26
times during the winter in order to eat from the stores
accumulated in the burrow with the approach of winter.
More and more use is being made in the kitchen of
soapless determents. Why do these detergents wash
cleaner than soap?
Instead of the old-fashioned bar of soap and the scrubb¬
ing board, modern housewives now use soap powders
(still based, as for centuries, on chemically-treated ani¬
mal fats or vegetable oils), but more frequently they use
detergents.
Let us be quite clear, however, when speaking of deter¬
gents, that soap itself is a detergent. That is, it removes
dirtwhich is what "detergence" means. Strictly speak¬
ing, therefore, these new chemicals should be called
"soapless detergents". They were made by nature millions
of years ago, and come from mineral oil, deep in the heart
of the earth. They are produced during the distillation of
petrol or gasoline. Their commercial use has developed
since the Second World War, and their development was
encouraged by the shortage of fats and oils during and
immediately after the War. But they are not just sub¬
stitutes for soap. They have scientific values in their own
right. They make water wetter.
Secret of detergents water
Water, in order to dissolve or remove dirt, has got to
permeate it. It has got to wet it. But oil and
grease repel water that is why a sheep's fatty
fleece acts as a waterproof. And that is why water runs
off a duck's oily back. If you were unkind enough to
wash a sheep or a duck with chemical detergents, the
sheep's fleece would no longer waterproof and the duck
would sink because its feathers would become waterlogged.
Now why does this happen? To understand the action
of detergents you have to know something about what is
scientifically called "surface tension". To make "surface
tension" very simple, one might think of a globule of oil
or a blob of grease as a tiny balloon. Just as the balloon
has a thin rubber coating, so the oil or grease has an
invisible skin which prevents the water from penetrating.
What the detergent does by its chemical action is to
destroy that skin remove the surface tension so that
the water, being now wetter, can dissolve the oil or grease.
So a greasy plate, or an oily cloth, is properly cleaned by
a detergent.
This, of course, has very important uses in industry as
well as in the home, and there are some medical scientists
who hope that the detergent action may even be of some
value within the human body. One of the things which
cause diseases of the arteries and the heart is the clogg¬
ing of the blood vessels with fat like the furring of a
waste pipe with grease and the doctors are looking for a
detergent which, carried by the blood stream, would
prevent this clogging of the blood vessels. But they
know they have to be very careful. Mineral chemicals of
this kind are always liable to have injurious effects on the
body. That is why it is advisable to wear rubber gloves
when washing with detergents in the kitchen sink or in
the washing machine.

In this, remarkable garden of the Ryoan-ji
Tempie (ISth century) at Kyoto there is
not a tree or a clump of grass; simply an
expanse of white sand in which carefully
selected rocks ,,ave been arranged in
groups of two, three or five. The sand,
supposed to represent the surface of
water (pond, stream or ocean), has been
lightly scratched with a bamboo rake to
imitate the gentle ripple of waves; the
stones appear like mountain isles rising
from a sea of sand. According to connois¬
seurs, not one of the rocks can be moved
without breaking the spell created by the
perfect design. The tranquillity of the
garden is intensified by the bare earth¬
work walls surrounding it. The Ryoan-ji
has been called "the highest form of beauty
in this type of Japanese garden art."

Every description of Oriental customs, past or present,
shows the close relation of man to the appurtenances
of daily life. Be they clothes, furniture, paintings,
flowers or gardens, they are regarded and esteemed as
friends more than as inanimate means to practical pur¬
poses. While all Orientals love and revere flowers, they
look upon them in different ways, depending upon their
national character and temperament. Let us take three
countries Japan, India and Persia and see what flowers
or gardens mean to the peoples of these lands.
Flower are almost a religion with the Japanese; they
worship them with sacrificial fervour. They watch for
the blossoms appropriate to each season, and when for a
week or two in early April the cherry-tree blooms, all
Japan seems to leave its work to gaze at the blossoms
or even to make pilgrimages to where the trees are most
abundant and complete. The cherry-tree is cultivated
not for its fruit but for its blossoms. "The heart of
man", says the poet Tsurayuki, "can never be understood;
but in my native village the flowers give forth their per¬
fumes as before."' This love of nature is one of Japan's
great cultural values. Few people have shown so much
love for cultivating flowers and gardens, or nourishing
plants and cultivating plants at home.
The Unesco Courier. August 1958
selves, ever though this involves the utmost care and skill.
In fact the gardener never ceases to prune, clip, weed
but he does so in the spirit of being part of the garden
himself rather than a directing agent standing outside.
He is not interfering with Nature, because he is Nature,
and he cultivates as if not cultivating. Thus the garden
is at once highly artificial and extremely natural.
In India and in many countries of South and East Asia
flowers are looked upon as the glorious creations of divi¬
nity. They are used for ritual and prayer. No worship
is complete without an offering of flowers to the temple.
Some deities, like Vishnu and Lakshmi, have special
flowers assigned to them. But of all flowers the lotus is
held most sacred. It is recognized as pure and chaste for,
while it springs from muddy water, it is unsullied by dust
and dirt. The lotus is the symbol of the Hindu and Bud¬
dhist ideals to live in the world among the things of the
world, yet to be untouched by them.
Seasonal flowers for favourite deities
a branch bearing only
MORE
THAN A
A single spray of plum blossoms;
a few red leaves; a polished
stone shining with the
clearness of water and dec¬
orated only by a wisp of
seaweed these small and
simple things can convey
meanings of spring, of au¬
tumn, of thankfulness for a
storm subsided. Many have
a deeper significance.
The art of flower-arrange¬
ment taught men and women
how flowers should be grown
in the garden and placed in
the home; it was not enough,
they said, to admire the
blossoms, "but one must
learn to see as much loveli¬
ness in the leaf, bough or
stalk as in the flower, as
much beauty in a flower as
in a thousand, and one must
arrange them not merely to colour but to grouping and
line."
Ever pruning clipping and weeding
Perhaps no other art, except painting, expresses the
Japanese temperament as flower arrangement. The
principle is one of suggestion. The word "flower" is us¬
ed in a broad sense, to cover not only flowering plants, but
also blossoming and even flowerless trees and shrubs.
Whether the material for an arrangement consists of
several flowers, a single branch of a flowering shrub, or a
handful of grasses, it should be so disposed in the contain¬
er that it symbolizes Heaven, Earth and Man. In the
case of a plant or miniature tree, the main stem represents
Heaven, a short branch growing (or bent) upwards on
one side of the main stem signifies Man, while a third
still lower and shorter branch on the opposite side de¬
notes Earth.
The intention of the best Japanese gardens according
to Alan Watts, a Zen scholar is not to make a realistic
illusion of landscape, but simply to suggest the general
atmosphere of "mountain and water" in a small space,
"so arranging the design of the garden that it seems to
have been helped rather than governed by the hand of
man." The Zen gardener has no mind to foist his own
intention upon natural forms, but is careful rather to
follow the "intentionless intention" of the forms them-
D
POEM
PICTURE
No effort to create an impossible or purely ideal landscape
is made in the Japanese garden. Its artistic purpose is to
copy faithfully the attractions of a veritable landscape, and
to convey the real impression that a real landscape com¬
municates. It is therefore at once a picture and a poem ;
perhaps even more a poem than a picture. For as nature's
scenery, in its varying aspects affects us with sensations of
joy or of solemnity, of grimness or of sweetness, of force
or of peace, so must the true reflection of it in the labour
of the landscape gardener create not merely an impression
of beauty, but a mood in the soul. .
Lafcadio Hearn in " Glimpses of Unfamiliar Japan "
EVOTEES offer seasonal flowers to their favourite dei¬
ties. Garlands are placed round their necks and
flowers fall like rain upon them. Guests and friends
are garlanded and fragrant
flowers are used at all cere¬
monies and festive occasions.
Buddhists offer sprays of
white flowers upon the altar
with the prayer: "These
flowers so full of beauty and
sweet scents I place in
offering at the feet of the
Lord. May my spirit be
fragrant as this flower.
May I never forget that, as
the flower fades, so will my
body die; may my life be
more than the body."
In daily life, women, young
and old, use flowers to braid
their hair, and string them
for necklaces, bracelets and
anklets. Many Orientals
identify themselves with na¬
ture in every form.
Trees, shade and water constitute the Persian garden.
The Persian paradise (the word itself is derived from the
Persian language) speaks of flowers and gardens. This
is to be expected since the Muslim paradise, as revealed
in the holy Koran, is a promise of gardens and flowers.
Sir Edwin Arnold renders one passage thus:
Never in that garden hear they speech of folly, sin
[or dread,
Only peace: Solaman only; that one word for ever
[said.
Peace peace peace and the companions of the
[Right Hand (ah, those bowers!)
They shall lodge 'mid thornless lote-groves, under
[mawz-trees thick with flowers.
All that a Persian, that dweller on a high, rocky pla¬
teau, demands is coolness, greenness and the sound of
trickling water. Traditionally a garden was used for
discussion, poetry recitals and conversation.
Great poets like Omar Kahyyam and Firdausi asked to
be buried in a garden. Speaking of Omar's tomb a twelfth
century poet said, "his tomb lay at the foot of a garden
wall over which pear-trees and peach-trees thrust their
heads, and on his grave had fallen so many blossoms
that his dust was hidden beneath the flowers."
Of all flowers, the Persian prefers the rose. The lyrics
of the great poets describe endlessly the beauties and
perfumes of the wondrous rose.

EBONY DRUMMER (opposite page) is a carving by Felix Idubor, a young Nigerian sculptor whose work has won high praise
from European art critics. A leading artist in his own country, he came to Europe last year on a Unesco fellowship and
studied in London where he held a one-man exhibition at the Imperial Institute. Examples of his work are shown here. As a
result of his voyage, Idubor has learned new methods of bronze casting and expects to open a foundry in his African studio.
Early last year, a young Nigerian sculptor named
Felix Idubor, dressed in his colourful native clothes,
arrived in London to begin a special course of study
at the Royal College of Art. A well-known artist in his
own country, Idubor Iwas making his first trip outside of
Africa as the result of an international fellowship grant
accorded to him by Unesco (1).
When Felix Idubor paid a visit to Unesco House in Paris
recently, he had not only enriched his knowledge and
techniques through studies in the United Kingdom, Bel¬
gium and France, but had also become something of an
"Ambassador" for West African art, through a highly
successful one-man exhibition at London's Imperial Insti¬
tute. Several thousand visitors attended this exhibition
and art critics from several countries warmly praised the
works he had carved in ebony and other African woods.
Felix Idubor was born 30 years ago in Benin City, in
Southern Nigeria, a traditional art centre of West Africa.
Negro art is predominantly plastic and the classical art
of Africa, in the purest sense of the word, is wood sculp¬
ture. There are several centres of Negro sculpture on the
Continent, but most are in the Western half and one of
the most prolific is Benin. Some art critics consider that
(1) Some 2,000 fellowships and travel grants have been made by
Unesco in the past 10 years to experienced men and women in fields
ranging from oceanography to nuclear physics and from, teaching
to journalism. Twelve art fellowships have been granted by Unesco
in the past four years. Unesco fellowships are not usualy granted to
undergraduate students but to professionnal men and women . who
are already established in their fields.
at Benin itself and at lie, in the Yoruba country to the
north, African sculpture reached its highest level.
The 41 pieces of sculpture, all of West African motif,
which Felix Idubor exhibited in London revealed him as
a worthy 20th-century heir to this art tradition whose
history has been traced back at least 600 years. The
exhibition also gave a European public the chance to see
figures and forms of Nigerian history and legend created
by a self-taught youth who, at 28, had already become
one of the foremost artists in his country.
Felix Idubor began carving at the age of eight, and he
was earning a living at his craft only four years later.
His reputation was quickly established at Benin City and,
before long, he moved to Lagos, the capital of Nigeria,
where he became known to a much wider public.
His first one-man exhibition Was held at Lagos in 1953
under the auspices of the British Council. Other exhibi¬
tions followed and in 1956 he was appointed instructor in
sculpture at the Yaba Technical Institute of Lagos.
At the Royal College of Art in London, Where he went
in 1957, Idubor soon became noted among the students
for his speed and skill in executing the West African
forms on which he continued to work. For on this point
he has very definite ideas. "From my experience in
Europe," he says, "I feel it is tremendously
valuable for artists to come from Africa to
study Western art, but I have one reserva¬
tion: I hope that African artists will not
be overwhelmed and lose their own tradi¬
tional forms and inspirations."

ART
AMBASSADOR
(Continued)
MEMORIES OF TRADITIONAL HEROES
He points out that most of the arts of Africa were
inspired by ancient secret cults like the "Ju-ju", and as
such they depicted the spirits of ancestors. "'Until the
last century," he says, "wealthy people supported artists
in Africa. They bought works of art for their secret cults
and to keep alive the memory of traditional heroes.
Artists in African communities were kept busy; they were
honoured and respected by all. Art in Africa is based
on the inspiration of the artist at the time of creation.
He expresses his feeling and his interpretation of an
object spontaneously."
Perhaps the most striking of the ancient works of art
produced in Benin are the bronzes, either life-size human
heads or complete models of animals and human beings, or
again, reliefs of complete scenes, animals, humans and
mythological or magical symbols. The existence of these
bronzes only became generally known in Europe towards
the end of the 19th century, although brass casting was
introduced into Benin in about 1280 A.D.
The ruler of Benin at that time, Oba (King) Oguola
sent to the Yaruba city of Ife for a brass-smith as he
wished to produce bronzes himself instead of importing
them from Ife. (See The 'Unesco Courier, July 1957,
page 18.) The craftsman who came to Benin was named
Iguo-igha. He was a very skilful worker and left many
designs to his successors. As a result he was deified and
is worshipped to this day by brass-smiths.
A later ruler, Esigue (c.1504) is said to have encouraged
and improved brass working until the art of Benin
reached its prime in the 16th century. Ivory and wood
carving had already been introduced by an earlier king.
Benin was visited in the 15th century by a Portuguese
navigator, Alfonso d'Aveiro and later by other European
voyagers. At one time it was thought that the brass
casting had actually been introduced by Europeans, and
there was also a theory that it had come by a roundabout
route from India. But dating of the earlier Benin bronzes
shows that the people of Benin (the Bini) practised this
art before the arrival of the Portuguese.
This is another aspect of Nigeria's art tradition that
fascinates Felix Idubor. As Well as teaching young
Nigerian artists something of what he has learned in
England and on the Continent, he now wants to set up
a bronze foundry in his Lagos studio. "I have now
learned new methods of bronze casting which will enable
me to work faster and compete with established foun¬
dries," he says.

Idubor works in a studio

Art in London. While
studying in Europe, he

forms and subjects. Most
of the materials he uses
are woods from his own
countryi.e. ebony, ope-
pe, obeche and iroko.

L etters to the Editor
OVERLOADING YOUNG MINDS
Sir,
How can education help the world to
unite individuals, groups and nations in
order to bring peace, harmony and
understanding?
Are our school systems yet in
accordance with this ideal? Are we not
overloading our pupils with knowledge
and do not we give them stones for
bread?
Childhood is a kingliness in itself.
It is a gift from above that the child is
growing, and during the time of his
growth, that he is unaware of the woes
and worries and anxieties of life. These
are the only days for experiencing the
kingliness of life. It is a source that
refreshes, when life full of struggle
comes.
If childhood is already devoted to
study, study of material knowledge,
what about mankind later on? Let us
stop to think of this question.

WHY A 'MANKIND DAY'?
Sir,
A reader of The Unesco Courier has
suggested that '"Mankind Day" be set
aside and observed all over the world.
There would be some humour in this
phrase if it were less macabre it sounds
like something another species would
observe in our honour or our memory.
On calendars in the United States,
"Mankind Day" would have to take
its place along with National Cat Week,
Fire Prevention Week and Eat More
Cheese Week. Mass communications
make it possible for us to put these
things over in a big way. And it is
also possible that nobody would ask,
"Why are we celebrating Mankind
Day?" We are conditioned to these
things and serve on committees from
habit.
Walt Whitman's "I Celebrate Myself"
is a paean of hopefulness and dignity.
"I celebrate mankind" is meaningless.
Mankind is a non-entity, mindless and
totally ineffectual. The lonely mind of
one man, all separate from his external
circumstance, is the only effective,
creative force. Any day the lives of
two men touch, there can be either a
celebration or a corrosion of this vital
force.
Every day is my day and your day
and his day and her day. "Mankind
Day" is a comfortable evasion of the
issue.

CORSICAN LINKS TO INDIA
Sir,
While reading in the June, 1957 issue
of The Unesco Courier one of the
tales of Father Beschi (An 18th century
Italian missionary-priest in India, who
gave the Tamil language its first works
in prose) I came across a curious
parallel. Father Beschi's story has much
in common with a Corsican tale I
published some years ago in the
newspaper La Corse.
Similarities between the folklore of
two such widely-separated peoples may
at first sight seem strange. But on
examining some of the ethnic features of
the Corsican people one finds certain
affinities between them and the people
of India, for instance, in regard to their
skin colour, their hair, their height and
build, and the shape of their eyes. The
ancient dress of Corsican women includ¬
ed a large shawl and very often it was
a Kashmir shawl. We came across
many of these shawls when we were
setting up a Corsican group in local
costumes in 1934.
Even today the origin of the Corsican
people remains a mystery. On our
island there are at least two distinctly
different races, and we differ from our
Mediterranean neighbours. A study of
language, music, costumes, customs and
physical characteristics could, I feel,
bring facts to light about hitherto
unknown migrations or, at least, about
very ancient trading activities between
Europe and Asia.

TOO HIGHBROW...
Sir,
I have to admit that The Unesco
Courier has a remarkable make-up and
is illustrated with photographs that are
always first-class and quite often super¬
lative. The articles are top quality and
the subjects presented have undoubt¬
ed artistic or scientific significance.
However, I am not renewing my
subscription because these same articles
and subjects are too "highbrow" for my
taste. Articles describing Ming Period
pottery or the Aztec civilization interest
only a limited number of readers
including, of course, teachers, archaeo¬
logists and other erudite persons.
I should indeed like to know whether
your magazine is trying to reach a
"super elite" or whether you really do
see it as an instrument of artistic and
social popularization.
I note too that certain subjects of
lively topical interest seem to be taboo
as far as you are concerned. You
gave up an entire issue to nuclear
energy and the use of radio-active
substances, but why didn't you devote
another one to bringing home to
readers the dangers of atomic experi¬
ments and radio-activity an issue in
which you could have published the
opinions, for or against, of the world's
leading scientists? And why don't you
deal with the problems of racial
segregation, the ravages of drug-taking
and alcoholism and the slums and
undernourishment that exist in certain
parts of the world? These are studies
you could give like news reports rather
than use an academic presentation
resembling a drawing-room lecture.
I hope these few criticisms will assist
you in planning and presenting your
future issues.

...NOT HIGHBROW ENOUGH
Sir,
I am renewing my subscription to
The Unesco Courier in which every line
is imbued with a spirit of altruism.
Sursum corda ! Along with the other
members of my Circle (Cercle de Cor¬
respondance Culturelle) I feel you must
raise the cultural standard in every
field, avoiding commonplace repetitions,
tedious statistics and the "spectacular"
side of human achievements. Deal with
educational and philosophical problems
which are truly those of civilized men.
The black magic and wizardry of Africa
and Asia are fascinating, but as out-of-
date as the superstitions of our fore¬
bears.
Be an arrowhead of great ideas, those
as original as your fine photographs.
M. Aubertin
Paris, France
LESS ART-MORE NEWS
Sir,
What I used to enjoy most in your
magazine was the knowledge I derived
of other countries; their customs, their
religion and their history; example the
article on Buddhism, or the history of
Jamaica, or the evolution of women in
different countries.
I am sorry to say that too much has
been written on art, and not enough on
modern history, which aim is to con¬
solidate international relations.
May I suggest you devote whole arti¬
cles to Jordan's history, for example,
when and how it was formed, the type
of government that rules it now; or
Saudi Arabia, or any country in the
Middle East that is in the news.
Mrs. A. Metcalfe

EDUCATIVE AND INFORMATIVE
Sir,
I have always been thinking of
writing you a letter, in order to thank
you and congratulate you on producing
such an educative and informative
magazine. And, as a token of gratitude,
I have always been introducing your
magazine to my friends and to those
with whom I make new contacts, and
I am very happy to say that, as such,
I secure for you new subscribers.

From the Unesco Newsroom...
WiHO. FIGHTING SMALLPOX:
Two million doses of dried smallpox
vaccine were recently sent to
Pakistan by the World Health Organ¬
ization to help the Government
combat the Worst smallpox epidemic
the country has known in over ten
years. Records available show that
there have been more than 35,000 ca¬
ses resulting in over 15,800 deaths. By
mass vaccination it is hoped to pre¬
vent a repetition of the 1944 ca¬
tastrophe when 140,000 deaths from
smallpox Were registered for the whole
of Bengal, since divided into East
Pakistan and the Indian state of West
Bengal.
PABLO CASALS' COMPETI¬
TION: The second Pablo Casals'
International Competition for cel¬
lists will be held in the picturesque
city of Xalapa, in the state of
Veracruz, Mexico, during January
1959. It is open to 'cellists of all
nationalities born between Janua¬
ry 1, 1929 and January 1, 1944. The
first of the Pablo Casals competi¬
tions which aim to help talented
young instrumentalists in their
careers, took place in Paris last
October.
A SIAN BOOK ADVISERS: A re¬
gional centre for the production of
reading materials in South Asia is
being opened this month in Karachi
by the Government of Pakistan and
Unesco. The centre will provide an
information service for the production
and distribution of literature in Ben¬
gali, Burmese, Sinhalese, Tamil, Hindi
and Urdu. It does not intend to pro¬
duce books itself, but to assist in the
improvement of techniques so that
low-cost books in simple languages
will be made available to Asia's grow¬
ing reading public.
PARTNERSHIP WITH YOUTH:
A leading feature of Unesco's work
with youth is the System of Asso¬
ciated Youth Enterprises which
has been operating since 1955. It
brings Unesco into association with
experimental projects contributing
to international understanding and
co-operation or to the development
of social responsibility among
young people. To youth projects
which are already under way or
are being planned, Unesco gives
professional guidance and a
documentation service. Reports
are received regularly from the
associated projects, and they are
kept in touch with each other.
The system now includes 47 pro¬
jects, including documentation
centres on youth work and youth
problems in Cuba and Beirut.
J. HE BRIDGE BUILDER: A new
full colour filmstrip depicting Unesco's
efforts to build bridges of understand¬
ing between the nations has been
34
prepared for the U.S. National Com¬
mission for Unesco. Entitled "The
Bridge Unesco Builds", it presents a
clear and concise analysis of Unesco's
structure and purposes and a drama¬
tic portrayal of its work in more than
a dozen countries. Developed espe¬
cially for civic organizations and ser¬
vice groups interested in foreign af¬
fairs and international relations, the
filmstrip is equally useful to libraries,
high schools, colleges and adult edu¬
cators. It is available from the
Unesco Publications Center, 801 Third
Avenue, New York, Price (with script)
$4.75; (with recorded narrative) $7.50.
ATOM MEN IN AMERICA:
A team of atomic energy specialists
which is now touring Latin Ameri¬
can countries is the first mission of
its kind to be organized by the new
International Atomic Energy Agen¬
cy (IAEA) with the aim of helping
less-developed countries to benefit
from the latest knowledge on pea¬
ceful uses of atomic energy. Besides
studying ways in which atomic
energy can promote economic de¬
velopment, the mission will assess
the manpower needs involved and
will make suggestions for estab¬
lishing training centres in nuclear
technology in the various Latin
American countries.
M:ICROFILMING EAST &
WEST: For the past few years a
Unesco mobile microfilming unit has
been doing valuable work in Unesco's
Member States in Latin America.
This travelling laboratory completed a
six-month mission in Panama, a
year's mission in Paraguay and is now
working in El Salvador. In Paraguay
alone the unit microfilmed 197,000 pa¬
ges of ancient volumes, many fragile
with age, containing precious records
of the era of exploration of the New
World. In Cairo, Egypt, the Institute
of Arab Manuscripts has microfilmed
over 15,000 manuscripts and made
over 80,000 enlargements since it was
founded by the Arab League in 1946.
The Arab world's contribution to uni¬
versal culture is found in over three
million volumes scattered around the
world. The Institute is reproducing
many of the rarest and most valuable
and making the collection of micro¬
films available to research workers.
NATIONAL LIBRARIES' PAR¬
LEY: Next month delegates from
26 European countries will meet in
Vienna at a UNEsco-organized
symposium to outline the tasks of
national libraries and to exchange
views on thfi administrative, legal
and other aspects of this work. A
national library is not only the
nerve-centre of a country's library
system, but also plays a vital rôle
in cultural exchanges between na¬
tions. The delegates aim to define
. the services a national library must
perform in each country, on both
national and international levels.
POPULAR PROFESSIONS: Ac¬
cording to a recently made survey
among nearly 4,000 pupils in 153 se¬
condary schools in Colombia, a high
proportion of students between 18
and 34 per cent seek to enter the
medical profession. Second most pop¬
ular career is engineering (between
13 and 30 per cent) followed by law
(four to 12 per cent) and architecture
and dental surgery (three to ten per
cent). Some five per cent of the stu¬
dents wished to study chemistry, two
to three per cent veterinerary or
agronomic sciences, and only 0.5 to
two per cent intended to study litera¬
ture, mathematics or modern lan¬
guages.
MUSICAL U.N. DAY: United
Nations Day celebrations this year
on October 24 will include the first
use of an international, transatlan¬
tic radio hookup presenting, as a
single integrate performance, a
three-part symphonic concert ori¬
ginating in three cities. This
broadcast symphony concert will
begin with the Boston Symphony
Orchestra playing in U.N. Head¬
quarters, New York. From there,
Secretary-General Dag Hammarsk-
jold will deliver a U.N. Day messa¬
ge to the world. After New York,
the programme will come from
Paris, and will feature a perfor¬
mance of Bach's Double Violin Con¬
certo by David Oistrakh and Yehu¬
di Menuhin. Lastly the broadcast
will come from Geneva where the
final movement of Beethoven's
Ninth Symphony will b,e played by
the Orchestre de la Suisse Ro¬
mande.

THE RACE QUESTION IN MODERN SCIENCE
Unesco has called upon outstanding anthropologists, sociologists,
biologists and physiologists of international renown to prepare a
series of publications each dealing with a different aspect of the
race question. These small volumes written for the lay reader are
most effective in combating racial misconceptions, false theories
and prejudices. Their success prompted Unesco to publish them
for the first time in one collective volume, forming a full study
of the race question in modern science. The nine titles included are:
+ Race and Culture, by Michel Leiris
+ Race and Psychology, by Otto Klineberg
Race and Biology, by L. C. Dunn
+ Racial Myths, by Juan Comas
+ The Roots of Prejudice, by Arnold M. Rose
-fRace and History, by Claude Lévi-Strauss
-f-Race and Society, by Kenneth L. Little
+ The Significance of Racial Differences, by G. M. Morant
Race Mixture, by Harry L. Shapiro
U.K. edition published jointly with Sidgwick & Jackson Ltd,
London.
U.S. edition published jointly with Whiteside Inc., New York."
Cloth: $5.00; 17/6 (stg.); 850 F. fr.
The nine foregoing titles and a tenth, not included in the
collective volume (The Race Concept Result of an Enquiry,
9.85; 4/- (stg.); 250 F. fr.) are also available separately. The price
of those marked -f is $.30; 1/6 (stg.); 100 F. fr.; others are priced
$.25; 1/- (stg.); 75 F. fr.
Orders for the separate volumes should not be sent to co-
publishers of the collective volume but direct to Unesco National
Distributors.
THE RACE QUESTION IN MODERN THOUGHT
The Catholic Church and the Race Question
by the Reverend Father Yves M . J. Congar, O.P.
The race question in relation to Catholic dogma is here reviewed
by an eminent Catholic theologian. Father Congar sets forth the
position of the Catholic Church as regards the problem from the
spiritual, the social and the historical points of view, and shows
that the principles of Catholicism are profoundly opposed to racial
discrimination. $.40; 21- (stg.); 100 F. fr.
Jewish Thought as a Factor in Civilization
by Professor Leon Roth.
A .short description of Judaism's specific contribution to world
civilization, underlining what in Judaism in the very negation of
racial exclusivism. Professor Roth writes of the history of the
Jewish people and explains how ideas which have become in one
shape or another part of the heritage of Western man, evolved
from the basic laws of the ancient Jews. $.40; 21- (stg.); 100 F. fr.
The Ecumenical Movement and the Racial Problem
by Dr. W. A. Visser't Hooft.
A study of the basic beliefs and convictions of the World Council
of Churches concerning the racial problem. The World Council
groups over 160 Protestant, Anglican and Orthodox churches all
over the world. The author describes the historical background
during the periods of slavery and missionary expansion and examines
the present situation in the United States and South Africa, where
Protestantism is faced with the greatest problems and the greatest
opportunities in the field of race relations. $.40; 21- (stg.); 100 F. fr.
Buddhism and the Race Question
by G. P. Malalasekera ànd K. N. Jayatilleke.
Two eminent specialists in the history of Buddhism, show
Buddhism's special contribution to the understanding and solution
of the race question. One of the main novelties of this work is
that it shows how close the Buddha's ideas are to the findings of
modern biologists and social scientists. Special attention is given
to the caste system and to the different doctrines of Buddhism in
.relation to this problem. $.50; 2/6 (stg.); 150 F. fr.

BULWARKS OF POWER
IN AUSTRIA'S TYROL
With the Alps occupying three-quarters of the
country, the majestic scenic beauty of Austria
has made it one of 'the chief tourist centres
in Europe. Massive fortresses are still to be
seen high up on the mountainsgrim remind¬
ers of a bygone turbulent past. Today, the
traveller touring Austria can see numerous
fortresses of a different kind rising on the
steep mountain slopesthe bulwarks of mighty
dams built to harness unruly waters and to
create the power vital for peaceful pursuits.
Double-page photo (front and back cover)
shows sweeping towers of two dam walls
(Mooser and Drossen dams) scintillating in the
reflected glare of a thousand night projectors,
being erected near the Grossglockner, the
highest peak in the Austrian Alps, and part
of the great Hohe Tauern range of the eastern
Tyrol. For an amazing aeroplane view of the
recently terminated dams in their breath¬
taking setting, see photo on centre pages 18-19.
