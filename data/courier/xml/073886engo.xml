"Human Rights Bay"
Urged By Unesco Head
lrHE celebration of December 10th as"Human Rights Day"in allschools has been recommended to Unesco Member States by
Dr. Jaime Torres Bodet, Director General.
In a message sent on December 30th, Dr. Torres Bodet recalls that
sot the close of its Third Session at Beirut, on December loth, 1948,
. ne ueUeral vonlerence 01 unesco
greeted with enthusiasm the In-
ternational Declaration of Human
Rights which had been adopted
the day before in Paris by the
General Assembly of the United
Nations.
At the same time, the General
Conferences instructed the Direc-
tor-General to take all necessary
steps to publicize this document
of historical significance and to
encourage its study and use by
Unesco in all its activities.
In pursuance of these instruc-
tions. the Director-General has
invited Member States of the Or-
ganization, to support Unesco and
the United Nations in their joint
efforts to make the Declaration
of Human Rights as widely known
as possible.
Tn his message, the Director-
General says :
"The world yearns for an age
of peace and justice which shall
give to all the opportunity to de-
velop to the fullest their creative
faculties in the cause of right
and progress. Peace and justice
require above everything else the
strengthening of that intellectual
and moral solidarity, without
which, in the words of Unesco's
Constitution, the political and
economic arrangements of Gov-
ernments alone could not secure
the lasting and sincere support
of the peoples of the world. But
for that solidarity to be the ex-
pression of a true harmony of
minds and not a mere passive co-
incidence of wills, there is one
fundamental condition, namely,
respect for the human being with
his essential integrity and with
all this manifold diversity.
To Unesco the International
Declaration of Human Rights af-
fords support and encouragement.
Recognition of the principles
therein proclaimed and their dis-
semination through education will
help to strengthen the faith of
every human being in the dignity
of his own experience, and to
fortify the urge to brotherhood
which bids civilization by common
action."
The Director-General further
suggests that, in order to imprint
upon the imaginations and hearts
of youth the memory of that his-
toric moment when the value of
human personality was universally
proclaimed the Tenth of Decem-
ber of every year should hence-
forth be devoted, in the pro-
gramme of all schools, to render
homage to the principles of free-
dom and the dignity of man.
Mrs. Roosevelt Links U. S.
And U. N. Rights Declaration
Mrs. Franklin D. Roosevelt in a
special statement, on December
15, paid tribute to the newly-
adopted U. N. Declaration of
Human Rights as a"milestone"
in the progress of people every-
where.
The statement was made on
the anniversary of the Bill of
Rights drafted 157 years ago as
the first-10 amendments to the
U. S. Constitution. Citing the
common goals of the Bill of
Rights and the U. N. Declaration,
Mrs. Roosevelt called for a joint
celebration in the United States
this year, honoring boh docu-
ments.

Director-General
WHEN the President of the Beirut Conference, M. Hamid Bey Frangie, Lebanese Minister of Educa-
tion and Foreign Affairs, rapped the gavel 00 the evening of December 11. 19M, he entrusted
Unesco to another Foreign Minister and Minister of Education, Dr. Jaime Torres Bodet of Mexico.
The new Director-General, who was elected by the delegates to the Third Session of Unesco's
Genera ! Conference on November 26, succeded Dr. Julian Huxley whose term of office as first head
of the Organization had ended. The Conference also elected seven new members of the Executive Board,
which, in turn, voted Sir Sarvepalli Radhakrishnan (India) its Chairman, and Dr. C. Parra-Perea
(Venezuela) and M. Roger Seydoux (France) Vice-Chairmen for 1949.
Immediately following the election of the new Director-General, M. Frangie cabled to Dr. Torres
Bodet in Mexico, on behalf of the Conference, invit ing him to come to Beirut, to participate in the
closing days of the Session.
On December 10, the newly-
elected Director-General made his
appearance before the delegates
to the Third Session. In his in-
augural address he assured his
listeners"that I shall dedicate
myself unreservedly to Unesco's
service"and stressed that Unes-
co's most urgent duty was to
defend the moral and intellectual
rights of man. (The full text of
Dr. Torres Bodet's address will be
found on the centre page of this
issue).
For three and one half weeks,
from November 17 to December
11, the Third Session worked
methodically in elaborating the
new programme during morning,
afternoon and often evening
meetings of Plenary Session.
Commission and Sub-Commis-
sions. In a similar fashion, ques-
tions concerning Unesco's budget,
administration and external rela-
tion were the subject of careful,
detailed examination and study.
At the end of their delibera-
tions, the delegates agreed not
only on specific, practical activ-
ities for the year 1949, but on a
broad educational programme for
the years to come, which would
assure centi : laity in Unesco's work
and facilitate greater understand-
ing and participation by the gen-
eral public. (For details of Unes-
co's new programme please see

THE General Conferences openedwith an impressive flourish.
As delegates poured into the Con-
ference Hall, cameras clicked and
movie men filmed the proceedings.

UNESCO COURIER December 1948-January 194. 9
EDUCATION : A DOCTRINE FOR PEACE
Story of Torres Bodet's Life
When in 1922, the Libraries De-
partment of the Ministry of Edu-
cation was created, the Mexican
Government asked 20 year old
Torres Bodet to step in and get
the Department under way.
Libraries Campaign
Developed
Torres Bodet immediately de-
veloped an ambitious libraries
campaign to make good books
better known throughout Mexico.
He set to work on a programme
of translation of the world's
classics, edited by the Mexican
Government, organized a series of
"travelling libraries", installed
reading centres for workers is
industrial regions and for farmers
and peasants in rural centres. In
the short period between 1923-24,
young Torres Bodet had circulated
and distributed several millions
of books to villages, hamlets find
industrial towns throughout Mex-
ico
At the same time, his own list,-
erary efforts were appearing in
private bookshops throughout the
country. In 1923, two books of
poems were acclaimed by critics :
to Casa"and"Los Dias". Tn
1924 his famous"Poemas"appear-
ed. and in 1925"Paravento" ! md
"Biombo"were published.
From 1924 to 1928 he occupied
the Chair of French Literature at
the University of Mexico. As a
poet and writer, tnese years were
perhaps the most decisive for
Torres Bodet. For it was during
this period that the most import-
ant publishing house of the
Spanish speaking world, Espasa
Calpe, included a selection of his
works in its famed"Coleccion
Contemporanea"..
The Mexican poejt, Torres Bodet,
immediately gained international
fame in the new school of Amer-
ican and European poets. The not-
ed Spanish critic, Gomez de Ba-
quero, saw in his poems"the mar-
riage of classic and modern fresh-
ness.. a sculptured. lyrical cry-
transmitting the voice of a living,
modern poetry". French critics,
including Jean Cassou, also hailed
the young Mexican poet.
A Leading Literary
Figure
Thus, in 1929, when he entered
the Mexican Foreign Service and
reached Madrid as Secretary of
the Mexican Legation, he was
greeted as a leading literary fig-
ure of his country.
In the pages of the Spanish rev-
Iews"El Sol"and"La Revista de
Occidente", his latest literary
works began to appear along side
those of José Ortega y Ga3st't,
Gabriel Miro, Garcia Lorca ind
other Spanish writers of note. It
was during this period that chap-
ters of his novels. which were lat-
er to be published under the
t'11 e s"Proserpina rescatada."
(931) and"Estrella de dia" (933),
first appeared in"La Revista de
Occidente".
Between 1932 and 1940, his dip-
lomatic career took Torres Bodet
to Holland as Charge d'Affaires,
to Paris as Secretary of the Mex-
ican Legation 0933-35) and to
Argentina. Returning to Mexico
in 1936, Dr. Torres Bodet was nam-
ed Director of the Diplomat : c
Department in the Ministry of
Foreign Affairs, a position he oc-
cupied until 1937.
In 1938, he returned to Europe
as Charge d'Affaires in Brussels,
leaving Belgium with the German
invasion of the Low Countries in
1940. Shortly after his return to
Mexico, in December, 1940, he was

appointed Under-Secretary for
Foreign Affairs by President Ma-
nuel Avila Camacho.
Educating Mexico's
Millions
Torres Bodet kept his post r. all
Under Secretary for Foreign aff-
airs for three years until one day.
towards the end of 1943, the Mex-
ican President began lookinlt a-
round for someone capable of tak.
ing over the tough job of educat-
ing the Mexican masses.
Millions of Mexicans, UIldDle

was desperately in need of a rev-
olutionary-minded educator'111d.
administrator as head of the Min-
istry of Education. President Ca-
macho pointed to Torres Bodet,
then only 41 years of age.
Torres Bodet's three years as
Minister of Education mark one
of the most brilliant phases in the
history of Mexican education.
To him, the problem of educa-
tion, whether in Mexico or in oth2r
parts of the world, was not merely
one of teaching people to read and
write. He saw it as a world battle
for peace, for democracy and for
human justice.
"If victory", Torres Bodet said
in 1945,"is to guarantee the princ-
iples for which the free people, f
the world have fought, the tu-st
standards that nations must ad-
opt in education, will be to make
it a permanent doctrine for pence.
both on the international and the
national level.
... For so long as liberties are
enshrined in treaties and in chart-
ers only as faculties devoid of
reality, and so long as individ-
uals in different countries do not
have full opportunity of enjoying
them, peace and democracy wil !
continue to be in danger".
Torres Bodet therefore attack-
ed the problem at its very lr-t : le.
To teach his countrymen the basic
elements of education, Mexico
needed good teachers more than
anything else.
His first job was to galvanize
into action the existing profes-
sional teachers and to inspire them
with his new principles for teach-
ing the younger generation. fie
completely re-cast the then exist-
ing educational programmes and
textbooks, and set about builamg
up-to-date modern training schools
for young instructors and schools
for new students.
Then in August 1944, with this
programme already under way, he
launched three full-scale cam-
paigns to eradicate illeteracy.
Many were sceptical. For as Dr.

When, after only t-years of
work, the results had b-en tab-
uhted, the scepties were con-
vinced. More than 1, 2M, MO Mex

and write. This was an unparall-
eled achievement in the history of
Mexican education.
mentary reading books and prim-
ers began flooding the country,
containing not only the Spanish
ABCs but brief history lessons and
short chapters on good citizenship
and simple hygiene.
But a part of Mexico's popula-
tion is made up of Indians who do
not speak Spanish. For these
people, Torres Bodet had special
primers prepared in their own
language. These he thought, would
serve as a basis for later instruc-
tion in Spanish. In many cases, the
alphabets of these languages bad
never been'written down. The
Minister of Education called in s

While Minister of Education,
Dr. Torres Bodet was elected, : n
November 1945, to lead his
country's delegation to the Uneseo
Preparatory Commission in Lon-
don. His name appears as one of
the signatories of the Carter of
Unesco.
A year later, he was named
Foreign Minister of Mexico and
occupied this position until Dec-
ember 1948, when he was elected
Director-General of Unesco by the
General Conference in Beirut.
As Foreign Minister, Torres Bo-
det led the Mexican delegation to
the Inter-American Conference for
the Maintenance of Peace and
Continental Security, held at
Petropolis, Brazil, in the summer
of 1947. At the Second Session of
the UN General Assembly (Sep-
tember 1947) he was elected Vice-
President, and at Bogota early m
1948, he led the Mexican delega-
tion to the Ninth-Lnter-American
Conference.

Appeal
To World Press
Early in January Dr. Torres
Hodet, Director-General of
Unesco, was the guest of hon-
our at the weekly lunch of
the Anglo-American Press As-
sociation in Paris.
Addressing the journalists, tne
Director-General emphasized
the importance of close col-
laboration between Unesco and
the press. Recalling that
Unesco aims above all at estab-
lishing a true"brotherliness
of the mind", he pointed out
that the first condition of that
brotherliness was a campaign
against the ignorance of the
masses ; but that that condition
was not enough in itself.
"Education is one thing, pro-
paganda is another", declared
Dr. Torres Bodet. To spread
the rudiments of learning
among the masses and then
to expose them to the dangers
of demagogy and propaganda.
he continued, was in contra-
diction to the end in view :
While education aimed at
putting the individual in com-
munion with mankind, propa-
ganda often imprisoned him
in the fiercest forms of na-
tionalism.
Serving Truth
The work of Unesco the
Director-General said would
therefore be useless unless the
press, for its part, placed at
the service of education, that
is, of truth, its own potent
means of persuasion. It was
for the press to form the judg-
ment of the masses, by giving
them impartial information
without flattering their foibles.
Dr. Torres Bodet stated that
Unesco in its turn was anxious
to help the press. He then gave
special attention to its prob-
lems, particularity to the ques-
tion of freedom of information,
the universal character of
which had just been proclaim-
ed in the International De-
claration of Human Rights.
The Director-General men-
tioned the inquiries carried
out by Unesco all over the
world into the technical needs
of the press, radio and films,
emphasizing the importance
given by these inquiries to the
professional training of jot ; rn-,
lists.
Mobilize Opinion i
The information thus ga-
thered, he added, would"en-
able Unesco to take positive
action in full knowledge of the
facts."Such action would of
course be difficult, because
Unesco is an inter-20vern-
mental Agency and the press
had to keep free of govern-
mental power.
It was also difficult, he said,
because Unesco was an intel-
lectual organization and could
not make a direct impact on
economic and political factors.
It was therefore for the press
itself to assist Unesco's efforts
and make its action effective
by mobilizing opinion
atom, Dr. Jaime Torres Bodet, newly elected Director-General of Unesco at the Beirut Confer-
pence, is one of the pounsest statesmen and educators to lead a United Nations international
Organization.
Born in Mexico City on April 17, 1902, the former Foreign Minister of Mexico has had a dist-
inguished career as poet, novelist, essayist, critic, educationist, diplomat and international statesman.
coupled with a reputation for driving energy, vigour and hard work.
Dr, Torres Bodet was educated at the Teachers'. College of Mexico, the National Preparatory Coy
lege and the Faculty of Philosophy and Letters of the University Of Mexico. His first book of verse,
"Fervor", was published at the age of 17, with an introduction by the great contemporary poet of
Mexico, Enrique Gonzalez Martinez.
At 19, already steeped in French literature, he completed the translation into Spanish of several
of the works of André Gide.
Francisco Lal"royo writes in"Mex-
ico y la Cultural" :'No campaign of
such scope had ever before been
undertaken in Mexico".
Torres Bodet, however, adopted
an unusual technique.
Each one teach one
He issued an. urgent call to a ! !
educated Mexicans between the
ages of 18 and 60 to become"em-
ergency"teachers for at least one
of their illiterate countrymen in
the 6 to 40 age bracket. Personally
touring Mexico's villages and
towns, he aroused and inspired
the population to take up the
challenge. The movement caht
on and began to sweep across the
entire nation.
Soon over 60, 000 collectiVe teach-
ing centres had been organized
throughout Mexico. Lawyers, doc-
tors, business men, industrialists,
farmers and landowners all began
"pitching in"to make the. cam-
paign a success.
Such was the enthusiasm arou-
sed, that country doctors, for ex-
ample, began forming special
classes in their offices, devoting
one and two hours daily to teach-
ing the first two"R'8"to their
neighbours.
Thus the campaign not only
made headway, but actually took
on the character of a national ed-
ucation"race". Individuals and
groups began vying with one an-
other to obtain the best results in
the shortest time.
Sewing Machines and
Farm Tools
In the interior of Mexico, in-
dustrial leaders and landowners
took to organizing Sunday fies-
tas in their factories and hacien-
rias so as to spur their students
on and guarantee promptness at
classes. Free lunches and special
prizes were awarded to the bright-
est students."Give-a ways"includ-
ed such useful and prized objects
as sewing machines for women,
tools and farm equipment for
country workers.
But for these people, Torres Bo-
det knew, there had to be some
kind of simple, easy reading ma-
terial, if their new knowledge was
not to be quickly forgotten. Prink-
ing presses started rolling fnd
special newspapers began appear-
ing on the walls of Mexico's towns
and villages.. Over 10, 000, 000 ele-
Uver 1, XUU. 600 m. exlcans learned to read, wrtte
through Torres Bodet's literacy campaigns.

December 1948-January 1949 UNESCO COURSER 3
FOOD AND PEOPLE
Unesco Issues Challenge
To Society and Science
is running away with us. people
say ; it is getting out of control ;
who knows but that it will destroy
us ?
Although food production is
nearing prewar level...
They have helped to create in
the minds of simple people every-
where an enormous increase of in-
terest in. science, and of respect.
almost awe. for it. But because all
this has happened in war-time.
because much of it was first
applied to destruction, this'in-
terest and this respect have carri-
ed with them an unmistakable
pessimism and even fear. Science
,
There are two things to be said
Weekly Radio Review
To Start February 19
N February 19, Unesco is presenting to world radio organizations1 its first programme for weekly broadcast,"Unesco World
Review". Sub-titled"A Weekly Radio Review on Education,
Science and Culture", it is. the result of months of research and testing
by the Projects Division of Mass Communications.
Fven before last October, when a Conference of Radio Experts from
eighteen countries meeting in Unesco House gave its complete approval
to the idea, memoers OI the ui vi-
sion have been planning the ap-
proach.
The problem was to present
developments in the fields of
Unesco interest, to show concrete
examples of international co-
operation within these areas, and
in those of other UN Specialized
Agencies, and to make these items
alive and interesting.
For people of different countries
do work together, there are steps
being taken towards a better life
for all. There is an interdepend-
ence between men and women of
various nationalities and many
things that are happening to-day
transcend narrow nationalistic
ideas. There are many examples.
A broadcast giving these can be
a real weapon for peace.
FOR instance, recently an artexhibition was held in Italy
to pay for the reconstruction of
a war-damaged bridge ; 3, 000
British students, 15 to 18 years
old, met in London during the
Christmas holidays to debate
problems facing their country and
the world.
It is news when countries dif-
fering in political ideology co-
operated to aid blind people re-
gain sight through the Eye Bank,
co-operate in attempts to curb
traffic in drugs. It is news when
modern science helps grow more
food for the world, elsewhere
aids the figth for world health.
Constant interchange of scholar-
ships takes place between the
countries of the world. Besides
this, new methods in medicine
are being discovered to prolong
human life ; arts and the theatre
daily cross national barriers. It
was thought that these events
leading to international under-
standing should be brought to the
attention of the world and that
their application in every-day life
should be stressed.
Mass Media experts are con-
vinced that a definite interest in
constructive achievements exists
and that they can be presented
in attention-holding fashion. In
tl1. e"Unesco World Review".
the listener will not be preached
to, nor will any particular cul-
ture be stressed above others.
THE programme is divided intothree parts. The first five
minutes consist of a round-up of
short items which might other-
wise be missed in the hurried
world of to-day. The next two
periods, also of five minutes each.
are devoted to features dealing
with the news behind the news.
In preliminary searches for the
first section, much of interest has
been uncovered. Items have come
from international organizations,
conferences, medical associations,
teachers.
Items which contribute to in-
ternational understanding are still
being sought. Members of Na-
tional Commissions and of other
Unesco groups may send such
news to Mr. Melton Davis, Mass
Communications, Room 323, Unes-
co. Provision has been made to
treat events such as the millenary
of Ibn Sina, better known as Avi-
cenna, in the"Unesco World
Review".
It should be clearly understood
that the programme does not in-
tend to publicize Unesco, but to
place before as wide a public as
possible those ideals for which
Unesco stands.
The five-minute features are
being produced in collaboration
with personalities qualified in the
particular subject treated. It is
here for example that the back-
ground of new scientific dis-
coveries will be given.
Food and People, chosen as the
discussion theme of the project
on the Social Implications of
Science, will also be the subject
of 5-minute"features".
Plans have been made to in-
clude frequent items resulting
from the Declaration of Human
Rights, passed by the UN As-
sembly at its last session. Since
Unesco is charged with publiciz-
ing the Declaration, features are
being specially prepared to carry
out this mission. Thumb-nail bio-
graphies of men who have been
leaders in the fight for human
rights are being scheduled.
A book of the month which, in
the opinion of Unesco, deserves
wide publicity because of its con-
tribution to international un-
derstanding, will also be pre-
sented.
The first trial"Unesco World
Review"programme, made up
for the radio conference, included
a story from the Unesco Calendar
of World Affairs. It told of a
poor coolie who conducted a one-
man campaign against illiteracy
in the villages of North China
He had begun by selling his pig-
tail to start a fund for building
schools.
Certain of the programmes will
be sent by air-mail, others may be
broadcast over UN short wave
stations and then re-transmitted
to local networks. It is not known
at present how many rad : o sta-
tions will carry the programme
from its start since most radio
schedules have been made up
months in advance. But it is hop-
ed that members of interested
groups will keep in touch with
their local radio stations : n order
to learn when they will be able to
hear"Unesco World Review".
Much of the eventual success
of this important and ambitious
project depends on the help given
it by the national radio organiza-
tions of the world. At Unesco
every effort will be made to see
that the programme-on educa-
tional, scientific and cultural
events-will be human, interest-
ing and constructive, and that it
will appeal to popular taste. In
the final analysis, this can really
be"Peoples speaking to Peoples".

about this pessimism. In the first
place, it is of course quite mis-
taken. In every generation, and
even during the recent war. the
positive gains from science have
far outweighed the destruction ;
only they don't get as much pub-
licity. Everyonermembers the
80, 000 dead at Hiroshima. But
how many people know that the
population of the world was
greater at the end of the war than
at the beginning ?
But the second point is even
more Important. People feel that
science is running away with
them personally because they
don't understand how it works,
and what are its underlying ideas.
No one has shown them how and
where science fits into their daily
lives. They need help to see
science in its perspective, and only
so can they in turn help us to
guide scientific work towards
peace and the fulfilment of hu-
man needs.
started has mostly been itself
alarmist and pessimistic, as if
these problems were handed to us
by Nature and we had no other
choice but to sit and starve.
Unesco will be presenting these
problems, not as matters for
alarm but as a. challenge ; a chal-
lenge to science to show how, for
example, world food shortages
should be met. and a challenge to
humanity to put into practice the
solutions whioo science has al-
ready made possible.
We want to bring this challenge
into the conscience of everyone in
every country and at every level.
These discussions and this cam-
paign are not for scientists alone,
because the problems are not only
scientific ones.
Dr. J. Bronowski is a mathema-
tician and statistician. He was a
Scientific member of the British
, Mission which ion 1945 visited Hiro-. shima and Nagasaki to assess the
damage done-byth atomic--bombs.
He has also written books on lite-
rature, including ali authoritative
life of the English poet,) lrUst and
mystic, William Btake.
We want to make everyone see
how much science has already
done and how much more it can
do ; and we want them to feel
that it is their business to see
that what can be done shall be
done. We want to create an in-
formed and an active public opi-
nion.
Details of the campaign will be
given in these pages regularly ; and
we shall also publish here extracts
from the work of
the many dis-
tinguished au-
t h o r s who are
helping us. The
first step in the
campaign is the
production of a
series of discus-
simon pamphlets by
writers of repute
who can present
the contribution
of their branch of
science clearly
and simply and in
a non-technical
way.
There will be
four levels of
such pamphlets,
ranging from the
most popular to
a comparatively
scientific level ;
though even such
scientific subjects
as Nutrition or
Population Ba-
lance will be pre-
sented in a man-
ner wmcii, Wfille imeuigem, aoes

tific background.
A list of the pamphlets and the
authors who are writing them

This is an important task for
Unesco, in which a number of
Departments are working together.
It must be carried out broadly,
must have a wide appeal, and
must address itself above all to
matters ; which are urgent and
immediate and within the under-
standing of people everywhere. It
is not enough to talk of the im-
pact of science on society ; we
must bring home to everyone the
impact of science on their lives.
For this reason the Director
General, after going over this
problem with members of the
Secretariat, decided to pic ; ; : a
single theme for the campaign,
to popularize it, and to discuss
it in all its implications.
The theme that has been chosen
for 1949 is"food and people". Un-
der this title two related problems
are presented, the growth of world
population and the strain on the
world's food resources now and in
the future. In a number of coun-
tries people have already begun to
think about these problems,
though few people yet understand
how very much they are their
daily concern and will be the con-
cern of their children.

TORRES BODET
THE following is the complete text of the inaugural address delivered by Dr.. JaimeTorres BOdet, Director-General of Unesco, on the occasion of his presentation to
the Third Session of the General Conference Of Unesco at Beirut, Lebanon, on DecemtJer
10, 1948 :
I wish first of all, Gentlemen, to express my deepest and sincerest
gcatitude.
I am profoundly moved by th  honour you have shown me in
appointing me Director-General of Unesco. I am quite aware that I
should regard this honour, above all, as the symbol of a great responsibi-
lity, which I should not be justified in accepting, untess I tried to deserve
it by my loyalty to Unesco and my devotion to the task before us.
Your confidence must be matched by the entire self-dedication of the
man in whom you rep06e it. I want to assure you today that I shall
dedicate myself unreservedly to Unesco's service.
I have always had the most complete faith in Unesco. Before assisting
at its birth, I had opportunities of appreciating the work of the Allied
Ministers of Education who, during their meetings in Great Britain, took
advantage of one of the darkest days of the struggle to reflect on the
destinies of a civilization which cannot be based on hatred and ignorance.
In 1945, I took part in the London Conference, as delegate of Mexico. In
transmitting the good wishes of my country to that Assembly, I renewed
my assurance that I would do my modest best to advance the noble.'st
cause of humanity : to establish peace in truth, on truth and by truth.
NO DIVIDING LINE BETWEEN
EDUCATOR AND DIPLOMAT
IN Mexico, I have been Minister of Education and Minister for ForeignAffairs. In these two posts, I came to realize that there could be no
sharp dividing line between the duties of the educationist and the
obligations of the diplomat. If the teacher trains the new generations to
intolerance, in obedience to a blind and exclusive nationalism. the
diplomat in his turn will be compelled to pursue a policy of aggression or
revenge.
Peoples, in their international conduct, show themselves no other than
they are in their school class-rooms, in their books, in their dramas, or
in their laboratories. It is therefore futile for diplomats to seek to shape
the figure of concord in the perishable clay of treaties, if the educationist
continues to mode ! the spirit of the mighty into the countenance of
despotism, or to carve into the minds of the weak the features of
abnegation.
Truth is universal. Those who deny that first principle and found their
hegemony on biased and incomplete reasoning preach lies. Hence the
importance of Unesco's task, because Unesco, truth and peace constitute
essentially a single enterprise.
A serious and disquieting doubt at present prevails among all nationsabout the power of our. Organization It would be a betrayal of the
ideas we preach to ignore this doubt. To recognize its existence, as I do
now however, in no way implIes that we share it. Quite the contrary. But
we must realize that many of the aims which inspired us in creating
Unesco are now in jeopardy. Nonetheless, far from allowing ourselves
to be disheartened, it is our duty to work with added zeal to restore the
real value of those aims. The United Nations are the body politic of a
new world, anti Unesco is its conscience. Unless that conscience triumphs,.
it will be difficult for the new World order to assert itself durably.
In pondering over the present world crisis, we realize that the discords
of the time constitute the most eloquent proof of the distress of the
peoples in their efforts to attain at one bound, to the three aims : Liberty,
Equality, Fraternity, proclaimed by the French Revolution. There are
still individuals and groups who place the ideal of liberty above that of
equality. Other groups and individuals set the ideal of equality above that
of liberty.
Both of them suffer, for both of them forget that, without equality of
opportunity, liberty becomes a vain symbol, to the advantage of the
readier and more powerful ; and that. without individual liberty, equality
would speedily become a sorry, undistinguished thing.
Furthermore, how is it possible to achieve fraternity without a proper
balancè between equality and liberty ? Looking back over a century and
a half. we now perceive clearly the necessity which just : fied the indis-
soluble link between the three great principles enunciated by the men
of 1789.
THE most distressing feature in the drama of our civilization is that
the two main actors are society, on the one hand, a joint and
inseparaole whole, which it is, alas, so difficult to guide and
stimulate in one direction ; and, on the other, individual Man. In other
words, the whole and the individual, the universe and the atom, the
discourse of the ages and the syllable of a moment...
In the endeavour to reconcile these two terms, the world has. after
every great struggle, believed that a saving formula had been discovered
in a treaty of international co-operation. The 1914 war led to the Treaty
of Versailles, the war of 1939 to the San Francisco Charter
The League of Nations. The United Nations. But how can secure an
effective union of nations without a previous union of the minds which
are the common denominator of each nation ? And how can these be
united, and their individuality safeguarded, without the help of education,
science and culture ?
The machinery of the State must constitute a bridge for good under-
standing between man and humanity. This is Unesco's goal, since the
promotion of the spirit of peace-which Unesco must encourage every-
where-aims at a single victory by way of a double achievement : the
happiness of man and the progress of mankind.
`-E were well aware, when we founded Unesco, that the new institu-
tion would be faced with obstacles of every kind. We never soughtto hide the formidable difficulties inherent in the fulfilment of
its purpose :"to determine the general aims of man's education"-
difficulties due to the cultural diversity of the modern world, a diversity
which is further emphasized by the imminent crisis in every culture.
Ne also knew that Unesco's ideals could not be attained if, although
supported by the teachers, scientists, artists and poets, they were under-
rated in the prevailing economic and political systems. Let me say, in
passing, that this shows how unjust it would be to hold Unesco alone
responsible for the inadequate results so far achieved.
Of all the various international bodies which have been established,
Vnesco Is the only one which claims to touch man directly. It is not
unfair to say that the others regard human conditions in their external
manifestations, seeking to prevent or to remove sources of conflict.
UNESCO, in its turn, owed its creation to the belief that"wars beginin the minds of men'. Unless we accepted this postulate, our institu-
tion would be meaningless. Peace, like war, is above all, a state of mind.
We have no hesitation in affirming that to all of us who went to London
at the request of our Governments, this was our fundamental idea.
We believed, and still believe, that In whatever philosophy man
seeks the reason for his being, he is a living centre of self-
dermination. Neither the backwardness of material life, nor the
evolution of science eould urge man irresistibly to war, had his
mind not already been invaded by a hostile determination.
That being so, the essential purpose of the United Nations : "to
save succeeding generations from the scourre of war", will be vaiu
and sterile unless we strive te dislodge war from its most secret
stronghold : the human mind. It is a rood thinr to organize a
security system, ready to mobilize all the resources of constraint
to combat any threat te peace. It is clear, however, that measures
of expediency are not enough;
else, is a sound foundation.

A DUAL DUTY FOR UNE ;
!
We publish below the full text
of Dr. Julian Huxley's final address
as Director-General of Unesco, to
the Third Session oj the General
Conference in Berut, delivered on.
December 10, 1948 :
I CANNOT help feeling some
regrets at leaving an infant
whose dev lopm nt I have
heiped to foster and to guide, just
when it is becoming really interest-
ing. I cannot claim, like some of
those here present who took part in
the discussions of. the Committee
of Allied Ministers in exile during
the late war, to have known
Unesco from the time when it was,
if I may say, no more than"a gleam
in its father's eye" or, if I may
adopt a paraphrase, no more than
a reaction against the glare of the
bombs falling on London ; but I
have now been serving the Organiz-
ation for nearly three years, and
some regrets are, as I say, inevit-
able.
However, any regrets that I feel
are much tempered by the know-
ledge that I am handing over my
office to a man of the calibre of
H. E. Señor Torres Bodet. You all
know his distinguished record ; as
what I may call an international
statesman ; as Minister of Forign
Affairs of his country ; as Minist ? r
of Education, in which function e
rendered notable services to the
cause of education, not only in his
own country but in the whole
world ; as poet ; as writer.
But I would like here to pay my
personal tribute to him. I have had
the good fortune to have had deal-
ings. with him on three several oc-
casions : in 1946, when I visited a
few Latin-American countries on
behalf of the Preparatory Commis-
sions, in the early summer of 1947,
when I was helping to urepare for
the Conference in Mexico City, and
again during the Conference itself ;
and can testify to his deep personal
interest in education in its broad-
est sense, including matters such as
the necessity of educating all the
peoples in regard to the conserva-
tion of natural resources, a question
too often neglected by educators I
can testify to his broad culture, his
intellectual energy, his deep sincer-
ity ; and thus in passing over the
reins of office, I am happy to be
doing so to a man whom I not only
respect, and admire but one whom
I am happy to be able to call my
friend.
HUXLEY'S PAP
A Call To
For Self'
I would like to take this opport-
unity of making a few observations
here which, while retrospective
from my point of view, may per-
haps have some prospective value
for my successor.
First of all, I think I am expressing
not only my own opinion, but that
of the great majority of delegates at
this Conference, and indeed that of
the Organization as a whole, that
the progress made by Unesco in the
first two years of its life has been
not merely encouraging but remark-
able ; and that it has been equally
remarkable to note the degree of
agreement-indeed of cordial
agreement-attained in the dis-
cussions and operations of Unesco as
compared with that attained in
some other Organizations and Ag-
encies of the United Nations.
While this happy result is due
largely to the interest and energy
of our Member Governments, of
their delegations and National
Commissions, of the international
non-governmental organizations
which aid us in our work, of the
general public, and of the Secret-
ariat, it is, I am sure, also proof
of the fact that Unesco fills a vital
need in the present circumstances
of our planet, the fact that the
world has become ripe for the em-
ergence of an international organ-
ization dealing with the things of
the mind and spirit.
Individuals and governments who
disagree elsewhere and on other
matters find that they can agree
here on the practical projects includ-
ed in Unesco's programme. They
find that they can agree upon a
common aim, in trying to make a
more civilized world : a world which
can become more civilized as it be-
comes more unified, but also can
become more unified as it becomes
more oivilized. There is no common
ideology involved in this, but a
common practical idea ; and find-
ing that all can agree on such a.
practical idea and participate In
such a common aim is undoubtedly
proving a source of inspiration.
We Must Reduce
Psychological Distances
Between Peoples and
Nations
I WOULD like to reiterate herewhat I said on other occas-
ions, namely that no peace will be
permanent unless it is based on
co-operation in scientific and cult-
ural affairs. To achieve this may
be a long and not always spectacul-
ar job, but it is none the less a ne-
cessary one. As was well said during
discussions at this Conference, to
have reduced the physical distances
between countries is of no avail,
unless at the same time we reduce
psychological distances between
peoples and nations. In fact, in the

Here I would go further than. ; tome who assert that Unesco IS not
merely devoted to the cause of
peace, but itself depends on the
maintenance of peace ; on the
contrary, I b : tieve that if-which
God forbid-a new war should

ing the First World War) and be
ready to begin its fruitful work

Twelve Probing Questions
This brings me to my second
main point. It has often-and
rightly been said that Unesco can
only operate efficiently WIth t..'1e
active co-operation of Member
States-through their governments.
their National Commissions, t. heir
specialists and experts in the fields
ßf education, science and culture,and the general mass of their
peoples.
In relinquishing my office, I
would like to thank all Member
States for all that they have done
to make it possible for us on the
Secretariat to get on with the exe-
cution of Unesco's programme. But
[ would also like to ask them to do
something more, namely to exa-
mine critically and dispassionately

igainst the yardstick of the aims

LS measure against the achieve-
nents of other nations.
I will give a few examples of
rhat I mean :
. ARE YOU EXAMINING
; CIENTIFlCALLY YOUR PROßL-
; my OF GOVERNMENT AND OF
SOCIAL AND ECONOMIC OR-
GANIZATION, with the aid of ad-
vice from the best social scientists
and economists, and in a QJspass-
ionate spirit of science ; or are you
treating them ad hoc on an essen-
tially political basis, and in the light
of emotional or material interests ?
Are you profiting by the exper en-'e
of other countries in the field of
administration, by studying their
methods and sending your young
men to be trained abroad ?
ARE YOU ALLOWING THAT
FULL FREEDOM OF PRESS AND
OPINION, OF EXPRESSION, RE-
SEARCH AND TEACHING, which
is laid down in our Constitution ?
. Are you profiting by the expe-
rience of the various countries which
have been attempting, in such fields
as radio or film to combine freedom
in presenting different pOInts of
vi : w with some reasonable degree of
control ?
. ARE YOU ATTEMPTING TO
USE NATURAL SCIENCE TO THE
FULL-whether in education to
give to your citizens a proper under-
standing of the method and the act-
ual and potential achievements of
science, or in practice, in the act-
ual solution of concrete problems ?
I may mention that my own
country has recently made a survey
of the number of trained scientists
it requires and has decided that it
must attempt to double the output
of scientific graduates in the next
twenty-five-years.
ARE YOU TAKING STEPS
TO PRESERVE THE POPULAR
TRADITIONS OF YOUR COUN-
TRY in ballads and songs, in cos-
tume, in art and craftmanship, and
to adapt them to the changed con-
ditions of modem lire. so that these
rich sources of cultural achieve-
ment, in all their diversity, shall not
perish from the face of th earth ?
HAVE YOU TAKEN ADE-
QUATE STEPS TOWARDS THE
CONSERVATION OF NATURE IN
YOUR COUNTRY-whether for
economic, or social, or aesthetic
reasons, a question one asks oms-
elf with added force in this region
where mountain sides which we
know in biblical times were covered
with forests are now largely bare
where great regions of once fertile
land which helped to nourish Rome
are now barren or even desert, nd
where birds and beasts have de-
creased to such an alarming extent.
. WHAT HAVE YOU DONE TO
PRESERVE AND MAKE KNOWN
YOUR CULTURAL HERITAGE ?
Have you taken steps to preserve
your h : storieal and ancient monum-
ents, to unearth further remains of
your past history, to exhibit its
treasures and mal[ them known
to the world at large-another ques-
tion one asks here, in this region of
ancient history and incomparable
cultural diversity, still too litt ! 
known by the peoples of other
lands.
. HAVE YOU TAKEN STEPS
TO REMOVE THE SCOURGE OF
ILLITERACY FROM YOUR
PEOPLE ; and have you profited to
the fullest extent by the experience
of other nations in this important
field ?
#> HAVE YOU PROVIDED THE
POSSIBILITY OF HIGHER EDU-
CATION FOR ALL CLASSES OF
YOUR POPULATION ? Here again
the knowledge of what some colon-
ial powers have recently done for
their colonial peoples might serve
as an incentive, not only for other
colonial powers, but for some
countries without colonies hut
with large classes and sectors of
educationally under-privileged peo-
pIe.
HAVE YOU TAKEN PAINS
TO PROVIDE THE BEST ARCH-
ITECTURE FOR YOUR PUBLIC
BUILDINGS, and in this domain
to consider not only material cost
or practical efficiency, but also the
worthy expression of public spirit
and national pride ?
. HAVE YOU ENCOURAGED
THE CREATIVE ARTIST, whether
in painting or music, in literature
or drama, to express the spirit of
his country and to make life more
interesting and more worthwhile for
its people ?

SPEARS AND SHIELDS OF SOVEREIGNTY
r VERY often, WOI'ds have little relation to the true i : nplications of
ideas. A disastrous gulf has opened between slJeech and action. In
the presence of this danger, Unesco must build up a rampart of
truth against the eloquence of officialdom, will too ready to make promise
but tardy in keeping them.
The difficulty in this, as in so many other matters, is due t, he
atmosphere of transition m which we aore now living. Undivided sov-
ereignty of the State is today a legal survival which there is no eluding.
The strong brandish it like a spear ; the weak shelter behind it as behind
a shield. So internationalism is as yet merely a noble hope for'he future.
To expect Unesco, by its mere existence, to change the innermost nature
of men, is to expect a miracle which Unescc can never perform. We do
not possess a magician's skill, but we have our principles. For the ful-
filment of our mission to advance the welfare of man, a path has been
marked out for us which we cannot ignore. To follow this path, we must
have the consent of governments.
The National Commissions, it is truce, make up for certam constitutional
restrictions upon our Organization, but have we made sure that in all
countries the National Commissions are able to operate on the scale which
the problems of our times require ?
This is a very delicate task. Unesco has no fight to interfere in the
domestic affairs of governments. We have neither the power nor the wish
to transform the Organization into a world Ministry of Education. Nor do
we want to burden the impoverished countries still further with unjusti-
fiable bureaucratic machinery. :. ;. ;. ;....
YOUR., work must be based, above all. on two factors for which nosubstitute has so far been found : the good faith of governments and
the persuasive force of principles. We shall continue to demand these
essential conditions, for, without them, it would be wiser to postpone our
hopes to better days.
Fortunately, that is not necessary We do not view the future with
pessimism. Much has been accomplIshed by Unescn since the London
Conference. It is only fair to recognize that all the members of the
Executive Board, as well as the whole staff of the Secretariat, have
contributed in a market degree to these successes ; ? nd I will ask them
to collaborate with me in the same spirit in which they worked with mY
distinguished predecessor, Dr. Huxley
In naming that eminent representative of contemporary learning, I
realize how much Unesco has lost by his departure. For us, the memory
of Dr. Huxley's gifts and authority will be imperishable. Unesco owes him
the highest possible tribute.
The applause which follows him as he goes brings home to me the
tremendous effort I shall be called upon to make. And, in the accomplish-
ment of that effort, I shall need your constant goodwill and support.
i
THE MINES OF INTOLERANCE
r ENTLEMEN, during the summer of 1947, we read of an event which
'7 filled our hearts with dismay. I refer to an accident that occurred
off the coast of Italy. Some fifty children, on holiday, were taking
a sea trip, when their boat struck a mine laid during the war. All the
unhappy victims were kIlled by the explosion.
This posthumous act of vengeance by the war may serve us as a
symbol. Conflicts never cease at a given time or in a given place. Those
responsible for them leave concealed in the waters, theoretically restored
to peaceful traffic, many deadly mines. The most dangerous of them all
is intolerance.
To perpetuate intolerance would be to allow our way to be strewn with
a mechanism as fearful as that which caused the death of those Italian
children on that bright summer's day. But, in our case, should we forget
our duty, we should be risking the final destruction of the basic principles
of human civilization, the abandonment of all hope in a new world. To
remove the lurking mines of enmity and discord is surely the duty of all
men of gooclwilI.
Let us shoulder'thM dutI, centlemen, aod thus fulfil Unesco's aollle
mission.
other than our own. Classical humanism was at one time restricted toe the
Mediterranean region. Modern humanism must know no limit or frontiers.
It is Unesco's supreme task to help to bring this new type of humanism
to birth.
lr HE SpeciaJized Agencies 01 the United Nations for education, eco-nomics and health respectively, form a tr : ple front in the battle
against the greatest enemies of human progress-ignorance, hunger and
disease. I have already had occasion elsewhere to emphasize the value
f these Agencies.1 then said that for the purpose of consolidating peace there had been
no hapPIer idea than the founding of the Specialized Agencies as an
integral part of the structure of the United Nations. If 1 return to the
theme today, it is because the good wcak of these Agencies cannot be
sufficiently emphasized ; that work is often forgotten in the concentration
of most men's interest on political problems.
ßy connecting culture with health and economics, I want to stress thehumanitarian and, in the broadest sense of the term, democratic
character of Unesco. We must never forget that the intellectual and
moral solidarity at which we aim will be but a beadtiful dream so long
as men lack health and sustenance. Nor must we lose sight of the fact
that, just as Unesco sister organizat : ons are concerned with man's
essential needs. Unesco too must work for the good of the greatest number.
If leading scientists and educationist are to pool their efforts
within Unesco, the object of this is not to form a centre of
intellectual co-operation for the benefit of a select minority, but
to improve the moral and intellectual conditions of the great malNl
ef the people.
, .
"LET US KEEP TO ESSENTIALS"
...'"ANY difficulties lie in Unesco's way, one of which is particularly
 dangerous : the multitude of projects and programmes which have
so far not commanded popular acceptance. We must make a
choIce and try to set to work without undue hesitation. The peoples
expect of Unesco concrete work. which shall make a direct and immediate
appeal to the wishes of mankind in general.
SINCE we know the limits of our resources, let us not be diverted
to too many projects, and so dissipate our energies and resources. Let US
keep to essentials and, if need be, reduc' the area of our activities so as
to be able to pursue them thoroughly and to a finish.
. THE SECOND difficulty is the idea, to my mind false, that Unesco
has become an instrument of propaganda for one way of thinking and
in favour of one system of cultural policy. I do not think I need spend
much time over such a completely wrong and tendentiou. s view as this.
There is and always will be room among as for all schools 01 thought,
as long as they contribute loyally to international understanding and 18
friendly association between culture, in an atmosphere øf peace. Chinese
and Peruvians, Arabs and Frenchmen, Australians and Turks, Czechs and
Poles. Anglo-Saxons from Great Britain and from the United States,
negroes from Liberia or Indians from Mexico or Bolivia-all make their
own distinctive contribution.
We are persuaded that only by respecting the individuality"
each country and by hearkening to its characteristic accent shall
we attain to that full co-ordination which is essential to any concert,
be it of instruments, wills, races or doctrines.
Our one wish is to set a faic and just goal to private ambitions, namely,
service to man as man. Unesco does not claim to impose peace on a world
permanently based on victors and vanquished. Born of the war, its mission
is to fight against war. And it is precisely the slender nature of the means
available to us in this fight that brings me to the third difficulty.

6 UNESCO COURIER December 1948-January 1949
NOTED INDIAN THINKER
HEADS EXECUT ! VE BOARD
Ops 1 December 1948 Sir Sarvepalli Radhakrishnan, the eminent Hinduhumanist, President of the Indian University Commission and a
Fellow of All Souls CoUege, Oxford, where he also holds the Spalding
Chair of Oriental Ethics and Religions, was appointed to the impor-
taut post of Chairman of the Executive Board of Unesco.
Sit Sarvepalli Radhakrishnan, who is known all over the world for
his works on philosophy, succeeds Dr. E. Ronald Walker, Counsellor of
the Australian Embassy in Paris.
Dr. Walker had ben appointed
ill Mexico for one year in place
of the former Chairman of the
Executive Board, H. E. M. Victor
Dore, Canadian Ambassador in
Brussels.
At the same time that it elected
Sir Sarvepalli, the Board elected
its other officers, choosing as its
two Vice-Chairmen M. Parma-
Perez (Venezuela) and M. Roger
Seydoux (France).
The Executive Board, which s
responsible to the General Con-
ference for the carrying out of
the Programme consists of eight-
een members, of whom one-third
are re-eligible every year.
At Beirut the General Confer-ence re-elected for three years
five of the six members of the
Board whose term of office expir-
èd in 1948. These are Shafik
Ghorbal Bey (Egypt). Professor
Louis Verniers (Beigium). M. Vic-
tor Doré (Canada). Professor
Alex photiades (Greece) and Sir
Sarvepalli Radhakrishnan. M. Ro-
ger Seydoux, who replaced M.
Pierre Auger when the latter re-
signed his membership of the
Board to take over Unesco's Nat-
ural Sciences Deportment, was
confirmed in his office until ex-
piry of the original term in 1949.
Stefano Jacini of Italy
On the same occasion, Decem-
ber 1. the Conference elected
Count Stefano Jacini (Italy) for
three years in the place of M. Jan
Opocensky (Czechoslovakia) who
had expressed his wish not to
stand for membership a second
time.
In recognition of his services to
Unesco while. on the Board, M.
Opocensky was invited by his
former colleagues to sit with
them in an advisory capacity un-
til the end of the Board's Thir-
teenth Session.
During that Thirteenth Session
the Board received a telegram of
designation frQlll one of its mem-
bers. Dr. Benjamin Carrion
(Ecuador), whose duties had pre-
vented him from going to Beirut.
To replace him on the Board, the
General Conference chose a prom-
inent South American in Dr.
Guillermo Nannetti of Colombia.
While the General Conference
was meeting in Beirut, the Execu-
tive Board concluded its Twelfth
Session, the first meetings of
which had been in Istanbul, and
began the Thirteenth Session,
which was completed at Cairo
after the Conference closed.
These two sessions, besides
reaching several very important
decisions, enabled the Board to
make close contact with cultural
circles in the Middle East, from
Istanbul to Cairo, and to make
Unesco's work and purposes
known to the inhabitants of the
region.
In particular, the Executive
Board received an application for
membership of Unesco from the
Government of Ceylon. As is the
rule in such cases, this applica-
tion has been transmitted for the
opinion of the Economic ana So-
cial Council of the United Na-
tions.
The Board further decided to
give the Director-General of
Unesco all latitude as regards the
steps to be taken, by the means
of mass communication at his
disposal, to make the interna-
tional Declaration of Human
Rights known both to govern-
ments and to National Commis-
sions.
Among the other decisions
taken by the Board since Novem-
ber, are : the approval of an agree-
ment concluded between Unesco
and the International Theatre
Institute ; and the approval of
contracts concluded with the
Interim Committee of the World
Conference of University Repre-
sentatives ; with the International
Association for Exchanges of
Students for technical training ;
with the International Union for
the Scientific Study of Demogra-
phic Problems, the Permanent
Commission for Industrial Medi-
cite. tfie ßntl-l, ; ancer Union. tne
World Health Federation, the Ins-
titute of Statistics, and the Union
for the Protection of Nature. The
Board also approved the granting
of further financial aid to the
International Unions of Chem-
istry, the Biological Sciences and
the History of Science.
During the five days spent in
Turkey, the members of the
Board were received by the Gov-
ernor-Mayor of Istanbul and by
the Viee-ChanceIlors of the two
Universities there. A visit to a
"People's Institute"allowed the
Board to see at work some of the
men who have carried out in
Turkey one of the finest experi-
ments in fundamental education
in existence.

of the United Kingdom.
Philippine Libraries
Offer Book
Exchanges
An exchange of locally
published books and other
printed matter with publica-
tions of similar nature in
foreign countries will be
sponsored by the Philippine
Bureau of Public Libraries ! n
connection with it, s present
exchange service.
Heretofore, in the course
of its exchange relations
with foreign libraries, the
Bureau of Public Libraries
was frequently asked for pub-
lications that were essentially
private or non-governmental
in nature. Because of the
dearth of materials, the ex-
change in the past has been
limited to government publi-
cations.
One way of broadening the
scope of the present literary
exchange service and at the
same time"sell"the Phil-
ippines abroad is to en-
courage local writers and
authors to exchange their
works for similar publications
in other countries. Authors
and writers are requested by
the Bureau of Public Libra-
ries to submit at least three
copies of each of their works
intended for exchange, two
of which will be sent at the
expense of the Bureau of
Public Libraries to foreign
countries, and one retained in
the Library files.
Upon r e c e i p t of the
foreign publications. one will
be delivered to the local
author concerned and the
second copy will remain with
the Library. Developments
along this line will be com-
municated to the"Unesco
Bulletin for Libraries"which
will be asked to co-operate
with the said Bureau in
effecting the desired ex-
change. I
"World School"
for peace planned
for United States
Plans are being made for an
"American World School"to
educate youths from all nations
in international understanding
and peace. Proposed by Dr. Frank
S. Hackett, headmaster and
founder of the Riverdale Country
School, Riverdale, New York, the
plan calls for construction of an
eight million dollar institution
at which pre-college instruction
would be given to about 600
students from all over the world.
Dr. Hackett plans to raise the
necessary funds through public
subscription.'
Dr. Hackett stressed that world
citizenship is dependent upon
enlightened leadership and that
the proposed school would be
designed to prepare its students
for such leadership. He expressed
the hope that the"Riverdale
idea"would be emulated by
schools all over the world and
that eventually there would be
developed a"Council òn school
education for peace".
Unesco Sit ns Agreement
With World Theatre Institute
An agreement has been sign-
ed detween the United Nations
Educational, Scientific and Cul-
tural Organization and the Inter-
national Theatre Institute.
Under the terms of this agree-
ment, Unesco grants the I. T. I.
a subsidy of $20. 000 for the year
1949 and, against payment, cer-
tain administrative services. The
I. T. I will"provide expert tech-
nical advice'. on Unesco's activi-
ties in the field of the theatre
and offer Unesco world-wide
liaison services and other profes-
sional and non-professional con-
tacts and sources including the-
atre artists". The I. T. I, also
agrees to consult Unesco on
Executive Board To Meet
The Executive Board of Unesco
will open its Fourteenth Session
at Unesco House, Paris, on 7
February. Sir Sarvepalli Rad-
hakrishnan.. who was. elected
Chairman for 1949, by the Beirut
General Conference, will be pre-
siding.
The Board will discuss the
Director-General's report on pri-
orities to be given to items with-
in the programme for 1949 and
1950, as well as progress made
in the diffusion of the Declara-
tion of Human Rights.
matters falling within the lat-
ter's scope of interests.
The terms of the agreement
had earlier been approved by
the Executive Board of Unesco.
Dr Jaime Torres Bodet, Direct-
, or-General. signed for Unesco,
and Mr Llewelyn Rees, Chairman
of the Executive Committee, for
the I. T. I.
The International Theatre In-
stitute was formed last year with
the assistance and under the
sponsorship of Unesco. At a meet-
ing in Prague last summer then-
tre personalities from twenty
countries agreed on a Charter
which brought the body into
being.
The purpose of the Institute
is to promote international
exchange of knowledge and
practice in theatre arts ; in other
words, to help each nation make
known its best theatrical pro-
ducts. It also aims at lowering,
if not eliminating, the obstacles
which interfere with the inter-
national movement of new
playscripts, opera and ballet
scores performing companies and
the various types of informa-
tion, leading to increased and bet-
ter professional relations between
theatre circles of all countries.
The headquarters of the I. T. I.
are provisionally at Unesco
House.
Two ceremonies early in Decem-
ber-one at the Organization's
Headquarters in Paris, and an-
other at the seat of the General
Conference in Beirut-celebrated
the first distribution of about
150, 000 dollars worth of Book
Coupons to the representatives of
thirteen countries who have join-
ed with Unesco to release'part
of the international trade in edu-
cational, scientific and cultural
books from the obstacles of cur-
rency restrictions.
In putting the first Book Cou-
pons into circulation, Dr. Julian
Huxley, and E. J. Carter, Head of
the Libraries Department-at
Beirut-and Mr. Gordon Menzies,
then Acting Director-General in
Paris, emphasized Unesco's wish
to contributed by this means not
only to the international circula-
tion of Ideas, but also, and inore
particularly ; to the restoration of
cultural institutions in the war-
devastated countries. One of the
obstacles to their recovery is the
scarcity of hard currencies.
Of the 150, 000 dollars of Cou-
pons issued by Unesco, approxi-
mately 50, 000 dollars have been
given as a gift by the Organiza-
tion to the following countries :
Austria, China. Greece, Hungary,
Indonesia, Iran, Italy, the Philip-
pines, Poland and Czechoslovakia.
The remainder of the issue wm
be offered for sale in China,
France, India, Poland, Great Bri-
tain and Czechoslovakia.
The main purpose of the Book
Coupon is to enable educational
and scientific institutions in soft-
currency countries to buy books
and publication in hard-currency
countries and to pay for them
in their own money. The neces-
sary guarnatee in hard currency
is furnished by Unesco. For
example, American booksellers
who accept Book coupons from
abroad as payment will be
refunded in their national cur-
rency. The American booksel-
lers'Association a powerful
professional organization of
United States bookshops, has in-
formed Unesco that it has agreed
to accept Book Coupons in
payment of orders received from
abroad. British, French and
Czech booksellers will also. accept
Coupons for purchases'fro
other countries.
As was pointed out to the repre-
sentatives of the countries, cult-
ural institutions and the press
who were present at the distribu-
tion in December, this endeavour
by Unesco to make up for the
scarcity of hard curreacy which
hampers the international circul-
ation of books and publications
is regarded for the time being as
a one-year experiment.
At the end of 1949, Unesco will
review the question in the light
of that experiment. If it is suc-
cessful, the Organization will con-
tinue it on a wder basis and will
consider extending the scheme to
facilitate the international ex-
change of other educational and
scientific material, particularly
the circulation of educational
films.
"Universities In Need"
Published
An illustrated booklet,"Uni-
versities In Need", has recently
been published by Unesco in
co-operation with the World
Student Relief Organization of
Geneva Switzerland.
Describing how striken uni-
versities in war-ravaged areas of
Europe and Asia are struggling
to resume normal activities with
few books and almost no equip-
ment, the booklet depicts the
hardships of young men send
women students, who. arp
endeavouring to gain a higher
education.
The booklet is designed to
stimulate the collection of funds,
books, scientific and other equ : p-
ment for distribution to needy
students and universities.

First World Meeting
.. 8II... l 0 other international iDStituiioB eooperates so closelyyvith the masses as l3nesco", said Dr. Jultan Huxley last
November 15. He was welcoming the reprentath'es or
T8 Natieoal C_missIOllS who had met in Beirut for a two day con-
ference immediately before the openint of the General Conference.
For the first time an inter-governmental organization had invited
persons", who directly represented the citizens of their countries, I
Unesco's primary object was to
enable its national co-operating
bodies to become better acquaint-
ed with one another.
And, indeed, when submitting
their reports on what they had
done to carry out Unesco's pro-
gramme in their own countries,
the Commissions were able to
compare the problems they had
to cope with in 19-f8 and the
solutions they had found for
them. These exchanges were use-
ful, especially for countries which
still lack the experience gained
by some of the others, either be-
cause their Commissions are of
recent creation or because they
have not yet been sufficiently
developed.
BY eonveninc the meeting artBeirut two days before the
General Conference, Unesco also
gave the National Commissions
a chance to put forward con-
crete suggestions on what Member
States can do to help Unesco
on the national level and on what.
Unesco itself can do in return.
Most of these suggestions were
accepted by the General Confer-
ence unamended and appear
among the recommendations and
binding resolutions which make
up Unesco's new programme.
Miiton S. Eisenhower, chairman
of Commissions meeting
In formulating these sugges-
tions, the Conference of National
Commissions was inspired by a
principle which its President, Mr.
Milton S. Eisenhower, defined as
follows :
"The total programme of Unes-
co must be developed in a manner
which would permit National
Commissions throughout the
world to develop common pro-
grammes of action involving the
maximum number of citizens."
In order to mobilize this public
opinion, several methods were re-
commended to the National Com-
missions. They were invited to
set up in 1949 national Com-
mittees of journalists and writers,
such as already exist in some
countries, in Great Britain and
the United States, for instance.
The duty of these writers and
journalists is to prepare articles
and pamphlets on the major
themes with which Unesco is
concerned.
THESE questions, it was said atBeirut, should also be treated
on the radio by the arrangement
of broadcasts and radio forums.
Obviously such broadcasts could
do a great deal to make
listeners as interested in Unesco s
efforts to obtain duty-free im-
portation of educational film, to
take one instance, as in the other
subjects which habitually occupy
their attention.
The topic of'Food and
People". discussion of which Unes-
co wishes to develop in 1949,
would thus, because of its many
educational and scientific aspects
of immediate and world-wide in-
terest. be treated on the air by
experts who would know how. to
approach it from such an angle as
to catch the ear of the public in
their different countries.
Among the other forms which
this programme might take, the
National Commissions mentioned
the organization of travelling
exhibitions on Unesco.
A method recommended to the
National Commissions for giving
their work the desired drive is
the establishment by each of them
of specialized committees made
up of distinguished representa-
tives of culture in each country.
That, however, as the National
Commissions Conference acknow-
ledged, raises many question
which only the governments can
settle : first of all, the question
of personnel.
WHILE certain Commissions"have adequate funds, others
made no secret of the fact that
they would think themselves
lucky to receive the equivalent of
only 2 per cent of their country's
contribution to Unesco. Member
States were therefore asked to
furnish their Commissions with
the funds required to establish
the necessary secretariats and
for the organization of meetings
of the Commissions, their com-
mittees and their other subsidiary
bodies.
To ease the work of those who
are to be in charge of the Com-
missions, Unesco will, fn 1949, in-
vite the Secretaries of about i5
Commissions to pay short visits
to Unesco House. It was recom-
mended that the Director-Gen-
eral and other senior members
of the Organization should visit
Member States and National
Commissions in 1949 in order to
strengthen the links between the
Commissions and the Paris
Secretariat.
This liaison often takes the
form of the exchange of informa-
tion between the Commissions
and Unesco. These exchanges were
closely examined at Beirut and
both parties suggested measures
to facilitate in particular, the
co-operation needed in carrying
out the Organization's surveys.
The Commissions further stress-
ed the necessity to secure the
widest possible circulation of
Unesco's publications. As regards
the"Unesco Courier". Member
States were asked to consider the
possibility of reproducing Unesco's
monthly journal in their own
country.
The Commissions were asked to
keep Unesco's Public Information
services regularly informed of
their activities so that its period-
icals could tell their readers how
Unesco's campaign for closer un-
derstanding between the nations
is progressing in all its different
fielde.
LATE in January 1949, an in-ternational team of specia-
lists is leaving for the Philip-
pines to launch a survey of the
educational system of this war-
devastated country. This marks
the first of a series of Educa-
tional Missions which will be
undertaken by Unesco in differ-
ent parts of the world. A se-
cond Mission is expected to de-
part shortly for Afghanistan on
a similar job.
On December 29 a contract,
defining the terms of the Phi-
lippine Mission, was signed at
Unesco Headquarters in Paris.
Dr. Gabriel R. Manalac, head of
the Philippine delegation to the
Beirut Conference, signed the
contract for his government, and
Dr. Torres Bodet. in one of the
first official acts since he be-
came Director-General, signed on
behalf of Unesco.
Under the terms of this con-
tract, the Mission will assist the
Government of the Philippines
in developing its primary and
adult education and will also
study the problems of education
and training in citizenship.
The international team will
start work in the Philippines at
the beginning of February and
will study the existing system off,
schooling for a period of about
five months. On completing its
task, the Unesco Mission will sub-
mit its recommendations to a'
commission which has been ap-
pointed by the government to
reorganize its education system.
"'e Need a Survey Badly"
In a special statement to the
Uneseo Courier on December 29,
Dr. Manalac expressed his coun-
try's appreciation for Unesco's
help, and confidence in the re-
sults of the Mission.
"For 400 years", be pointed
out,"we have lived under the
Spanish educational system, for
50 years under American educa-
tional methods, and during the
late war, we lived in a complete
educational blackout under Jap-
anese control. Since 1946 we have
gained independence and with It
a change in our political and
mental outlook."
"Our social conditions". Dr. Ma-
nalac added,"have changed very
much and our educational
system must keep pace with these
social changes. W ? need a survey
very badly in our country."
Referring to the Mission as the
"type of help extended by Dnèsco
which can easily be appreciated
by the masses of the people", Dr.
Manalac voiced his belief that"it
will serve both as an example
and encouragement to the coun-
tries of the Far East and other
parts of the world."
Mission to Afghanistan
The Unesc'J-Phil1ppine contract
is the second of its kind to be
concluded with a Member State.
The first was signed at Beirut on
December 8, during the General
Conference.
H. E. M. Nadjit UUah Khan,
Minister of Education and repres-
entative of Afghanistan at the
Beirut Conference, signed m the
name of his coun ; ry. The Mission.
which. will begin work in the
spring. will study elementary and
secondary Education and partic-
ulary questions of vocational
guidance and technical training
ill this Middle East country.
Unesco Educational Missions
are undertaken on request of
Member States, after the conclu-
simon-of a formal agreement. Ex-
penses are shared by Unesco and
the signatory country.
The missions will only begin to
exercise their effects after their
work is officially completed. The
report submitted to the govern-
ments will certainly not be inten-
ded to justify a mission s existence
by the publication of an"inter-
esting"report. It will contain a
definite plan of action. Unesco
could not itself accept the
responsibility for enforcement ;
nevertheless, it is ready at. any
time to help the Member State in
whatever work of reorganization it
decides to undertake.
Experts : make Plans
To Assist Intellectual
And M. E. Refugees
THE problem of resettling- *-intellectual refugees and
of bringing educational relief
to refugees who have been
driven from their homes by
the war in the Middle East
has been discussed at a two-
day conference of educational
reconstruction experts which
was held early in January at
Unesco House, Paris.
The experts, who represent-
ed some four hundred non-
governmental organizations,
agreed to plans for raising
$50, 000 to meet the emergency
needs of four hundred thou-
sand refugees in the Middle
East. They also made plans to
try to resettle as many as pos-
sible of the 40, 000 intellectual
refugees, at present in the
keeping of the International
Refugee Organization, in Ger-
many. Austria and Italy.
Among other questions re-
viewed by the Conference,
which was called by the Re-
construction Department of
Unesco, was the problem of
war-handicapped children, and
ways and means of raising
more funds in 1949 for emer-
gency educational reconstruc-
tion.
It was agreed to call upon
national organizations of Mem-
ber States, and particularly,
the United States, the United
Kingdom and Canada, to co-
operate fully with Unesco and
among themselves in order to
solve these problems. Par-
tlcular stress was laid on cam-
paigns to obtain assistance
, from all sources and to bring
home to people the urgency
and importance of educational
reconstruction throughout he
world.
Among those who attended
the conference were Dr. T. G.
Pullen, Chairman of the Com-
mission for International Edu-
cational Reconstruction (USA),
and Dr James Gibson (Ca-
nada), Acting Chairman of
the Temporary International
Council for Educational Re-
construction.

"Unesco Month"in Beirut
Attracts Thousands of Visitors
(Continued from Page 1)
H. E. Sheik Bechara EI-Khoury,
President of the Lebanese Re-
public, then began his stately
address in French with a quota-
tion from a Lat : n poet ;"I am
a man ; nothing human is alien
to me."He welcomed the Confer-
ence to"this soil of ancient,
civilizations, this... crossroads of
Eastern and Western cultures."
Towards the close of his speech,
he touched upon the"intellectual
spiritual and human efforts which
may one day clash with the law
of force, that ultima ratio regum
of old, with the unleashed forces of
atomic e : lery." But he assured
his audience that"the stakes are
worth the effort and that the risk
deserves to be run since these
stakes are world peace."
Among the many eminent per-
sonalities who attended the Gen-
eral Conference-were Mr. D. R.
Hardma : 1, Permanent Parliamen-
tary Under-Secretary to the Brit-
13h Ministry of Education : Mr.
George V. Alien. U. S. Assistant

a co-ordinated programme of
mutual aid for the coming :
months."This", Dr. Eisenhower
remarked,"is an important even
in current history."
1950 Conference in Italy
The General Conference voted
to change the time of year of its
annual meetings, beginning with
the 1950 Assembly which will be
convened in Italy, following an
invitation extended bv the Italian
Government. This has been done
to comply, with a United Nations
recommendation that all SpecIal-
ized Agencies hold their an : dual
conferences in the first half of
the year.
Because of this change, the
1949 Conference will be held at
Headquarters in Paris, during the
autumn, and will devote itself to
a more limited number of con-
siderations.
Unesco Month
As has been the case in previous
Conferences one of the more col-
ourful highlights of the Beirut
Conference was the organization of
a special"Unesco Month"pro-
gramme by the Lebaaese Govern-
ment and particularly Monsei-
gneur Jean Maroun, his country's
delegate to the Unesco Assembly.
Over 22, 000 people attented the Plenary Sessions of Unesco's General
Conference in Beirut. Above, a large audience in Main Conference Hall.
Musée de 1'Homme ; M. Nadj : b
UUah Khan, Afghaaistan Min-
ister of Education, and Mrs. Anne
O'Hare McCormick, world-famous
journalist.
Toward the close of the Third
Session, the General Conference
paid its tribute to another dis-
tinguished personality : its first
Director-General. A resolution.
passed unanimously,"pays tribute
to the striking contribution which
Dr. Huxley has made to the de-
velopment of Unesco since the
days of the Preparatory Commis-
sion and during the first two
3'ears of its existence."
"If Unesco is today established
on firm foundation", the resolu-
tion continues,"and is beginning
its concrete achievements in alas-
wer to the hope which men of
goodwill have placed in it. this
is mainly due to the indefatigable
work of the pioneer who was its
first Director-General"
Prior to the opening of the
General Conference, members of
32 National Commissions gathered
in Beirut"not as official spokes-
men for our governments", as Dr.
Milton S. Eisenhower. President
of the meetings, pot : ted out."but
as representatives of the educa-
tional, scientific and cultural for-
ces of our countries."
This was the first time that a
meeting of this kind had ever
taken place. It afforded a unique
opportunity for pooling ideas con-
eraing the development of Na-
tional Commissions, and permitted
the representatives to formulate
This year"Unesco Month"was
principally devoted to the theme
of Arab culture. It included. a
series of lectures on the cO : ltribu-
tions of Arab science, literature
and art, to world civilization, ex-
hibitions on the History of the
Lebanon, on Lebanese and Middle
Eastern artists, a : led educational
exhibits devoted to books, science
and various aspects of education
in the Arab countries. By this
means, delegates and visitors were
afforded an unusual opportunity
to study and appreciate the rich
cultural heritage of the Arab
countries.'
That the Lebanese Government
succeeded in arousing the interest
of the public in the work of
Unesco and in"Unesco Month'
was shown by the fact that more
than 20, 000 people attended the
specially organized lectures given
by delegates and other person-
alities, ZJ, Ooo persons attended

and over 70, 000 people visited the
exhibitions
To thank the people of the Le-
banon for the hospitality, co-
operation and interest they had
shown in the work of Unesco, the
General Conference, at its last
meeting on December 11, voted 1\
resolution establishing t h r e e
fellowships, to be known as
"Unesco Conference Fellowships".
These are to be awarded to qual-
ified citizens of the Lebanon to
study abroad for six months in
subjects related to Unesco's pro-
gramme.

The radio system of simul-

saved so much time at the
Beirut Conference, was first
used at a world conference

A Call To All Nations
For Self-Inquiry
(Continued from Page S)
And so I might continue with
questions in respect of the various
fields of Unesco's work. However,
I will merely ask one final but over-
riding question.
HAVE YOU LOOKED AT
YOUR PROBLEMS FROM A
UNESCO ANGL&-that is to say
not merely as national problf'm
but as part of a single world prob-
lem, where the several nations must
learn to make adjustments in the
interest of the whole body of na-

Some Statements Mode
During General Conference
H. . Hamid Bey Frangie (Leba-
non) :"International understanding
does not clash with that other
tendency of man to be an indivi-
dual... a citizen of a nation. In
trying to make man a citizen of
the world UNESCO does not
propose to tear him away from the
peculiar and concrete reality into
which he fits, a reality from which
he draws his drive and will to live.
UNESCO does not ask for the
abolition of States or frontiers. It
aims at shaping minds that can
cross them."
Mr. Geor : e V. AHen (U. S. A.) :
"Unesco is not a luxury or a side
issue, as some observers are inclined
to believe. I am convinced that it
Unesco fails, the United Nations
itself cannot succeed. Unesco's par-
ticular task is to bring about bet-
ter. human understanding and
sympathy among all the peoples of
the world... I am. fully convinced
that Unesco is one of the principal
pillars on which a solid United
Nations structure must rest."
,
M. Georges Btdanit (France) :
"Scientists cannot be held responsible
for the uses to which science Is
put... It Is not scientists as such,
but unfortunately men as such. who
sometimes misuse science. Francis
Rabelais, a western scientist as far
as anyone could be In his time,
said that science without conscience
was the ruin 01 the soul. That Is
a maxim which every scientist
should adopt."
Dr. Paulo de Berredo Carneiro
(brazil) :"'A Unesco man', the
bearer of Unesco's message, a man
inspired by feelings of dignity and
liberty and inheriting all that Is
best in our tradition... to subordi-
nate his personal interests, his na-
tional and regional interests to the
universal interest of mankind. He
would inherit all our efforts. be
an agent of peace ; he will be the
cement 01 human brotherhood and
solidarity. It is for this man of
the future that the men 01 the
past have worked ; we are only a
passing link, but we carry with liS
the nag and the message 01 the
future."
Mr. Kin&, Chll (China) :"We
stress the importance of cultural
activities, first because they have
more direct bearing on international
understanding and sympathy. and.
second, because we like to under-
stand by the word"culture"not

vation of-natural resources, the malt
ing available to the world the tr<, as
ures of national art and history, the
removal of those sources of social
discontent which are too often the
seeds of war, and so forth.
In this regard as well as in meas-
uring your own achievements a-
gainst those of other nations,
Unesco's Secretariat, through their
clearing house functions, can be of
real service.
It has been my privilege to assist,
with your aid and that of my ecr-
etariat, in the first phase of
Unesco's development, when the
broad outlines of its structure andits mode of working have become
established, and it has been able io
embark on a number of valuable
and practical projects. I venture to
suggest that an essential further
step in its growth will be for it to
develop, in addition, the maturer
functions of reflection and self-
criticism, and that these can be r·c-
ercised through the process of crit-
ical but constructive stock-taking
which I have just outlined.
World Citizens
of the Human Mind

I am very glad that this Confer-
ence has agreed on one step in this
direction ; that at our next Confr-

cussion of one or two themes of gen-
eral importance, and that we should

Another forward step which, in
my belief, it is essential that Unesco
should soon take, is that it should
adopt the policy of calling upon
distinguished men and women in
their individual capacity to assist
in its task. As I suggested in my
report, there are limitations to
what delegates at our Conferences
can say or do-limitations imposed
by the very fact that they are offic-
ial representatives of Governments.
But there do exist writers and
scientists, artists and philosophers,
who bar2 by virtue of their indi-

. UNESCO COURIER SUPPLEMENT December 1948-January 1949
IU NESCO, the educational, scientific and Cultural'
agency at the United Nations, IS now cnterz : zg
on its third year.
It has before it ! t new world programme and at its head
a new Director-General, Dr. Jaime Torres Bodet, a
Mexican poet and former Foreign Mm : ster and Minister
of Education. A noted Indian philosopher and educators-
Sir Sarvepalli Radhakrislman-is now the new Chairman
vf its Executive Board.
The new Unesco programmes, the resu ! t o/three aKd a
halt weeks of careful deliberation and study by the Th'ra
Session of the General Conference which met in Beirut,
'Lebanon, from November 17 to December 11, is a more
closely knit, more integrated attempt to get people working
together across national frontiers through education,
science and culture-and thus to get a little sanity tn. M
the"minds of men".
To carry out this task. Unesco has been given a 1949budget of $ 7, 780000, an increase or 97, 363 over 1948.
Of thus $ 7, 780, 000 total, the Beirut Conference voted

tatfs, their National Commission, and private inter-

gramme to occupied countries such as Germany and
Japan. and to autonomous and Trust territories.
Unesco has found that the National Commission is an
essential vehicle for getting its message directly to the
THE DECLARATION
OF HUMAN RIGHTS
 s enesco' General Conference drew to its end
on December 11, 19-18, in the last hour of the
last Plenary Session, the announcement came
that the United Nations General Assembly in I'aris
had adopted the International Declaration of Hu-
man Rights.
Following this announcement, the Unesco dele-
gates unanimously and dramatically voted one of
the most important resolutions of the pro
gramme, calling upon the Director-General
to employ all of Unesco's facilities, especially the
press, film and radio, to bring this document-
which has been compared to the Iagna Charta
of Great Britain, the French Declaration on the
Rights of Man. and the Constitution of the United
States-to the knowledge of met) and women
throughout the world.
The newly elected Director-Genera), Dr. Jaime
Torres Bodet, rose to pledge his full efforts and
those of the Unesco Secretariat in publicizing the
Declaration and in working towards its ultimate
world realization."The United Nations', Dr Torres
Bodet added,"have just provided Unesco with an
excellent basis for support."
The entire Conference rose to its feet and
applauded for five minutes to mark the solemn
occasion.
people. By January 1949, thirty-three Commissions had
been set up out of a total of 45 Member states. Unesco
is working four the development and strengthening of
those already in operation and. towards the formation of
similar Commissions in the remaining 12 countrs.
Unesco is now ready, too, after a preliminary study
of the problem in Germany and Ja ; pan, to extend parts
of its programme to these countries. During the coming
months, Unesco will launch a plan to help develop
democratic ways of thinking in Germany and Japan by
encouraging renewed scientific, educational and intellec-
tual contacts between the occupied countries and the
rcst oj the u : orld. Nor will the Organization neglect
action on behalf of the non-autonomous and Trust terri-
tories which come within its scope.
As a member of the United Nations family, Unesco
w'Zl continue to build a spirit of close co-operation with
its parent organization and the other Specialized
Afj ! : llcies.
IN this special Supplement, the Unesco Courier presentsthe n w program  of Unesco. T is programme,
c : i : lpted by the General Conference at Beirut, is ! 7nesco's
"Operation Education Science and Culture"for the year
1949. And yet it is more than just that.
In many respects it is a continuation of the basic
programme adopted in 1947 by the General Conference
at Mexico City and as such emphasizes the long-term,
continuous nature of Unesco's work.
But above all,"Operation Educat : on, Science and Cul-
ture"is Unesco's, only in the sense that its Director-
General and its Secretariat are the international servants
or all the peoples throughout the world, whether they be
Lebanese, Indian, American, French. or Chinese.
As Dr. Julian Huxley recently remarked :
"Alone, Unesco can accomplish nothing. Just as this
Specialized Agency of the United Nations is a product of
increasingly widespread belief in the necessity and the
practicabii. ty of an ordered world, so the activities under-
taken to implement that belief cannot be carried out alone
by a secretariat in Paris. The measure of Unesco's progress
and the measure of its worth will be the degree to which
there is co-operation and participation in its work by too
people of the world."
Reconstructing the Damages
INCE the end of the last war, the world has been
faced with two critical problems of educational
reconstruction : a material problem of rebuilding
and re-equipping destroyed schools and universities, mus-
eums and libraries ; a human problem of rebuilding
the shattered lives of thousands of children and young
people who have been almost totally deprived of normal
schooling.
Unesco's basic role in educational reconstruction is to
punt down the facts, find out what human and material
reconstruction is needed, and where, and bring this
information to the attention of the public.
By this"brass tacks"method of procedure, Unesco
has been helping to arouse public opinion in many
countries and to stimulate the efforts of voluntary
organizations which in 1948 alone contributed over
$100, 000, 000 in funds and materials. The job, however, is
far from completed.
Here is how Unesco intends to tackle the two problems
of human and material reconstruction during 1949. Let
us look first at the human side of the problem.
The Human Problems
Aid to Youth
Is ETWEEN 1939 and 1945 thousands of children sud-denly found themselves without om s and
without parents. Many of these war orphans
wandered about the war-torn countries and were later
found and given care and attention in spontaneously
oreated"Children's Villages","Children's Communities"
and"Children's Republics'.
Today, however, these same children are no longer
ehildren. They are grow. ng up and are ready to learn a
useful trade as citizens of society.
Unesco strongly feels its responsibility in facing the
problem of the education of these young workers. In
1949, therefore, in co-operation with the ILO and the UN
Social Commission and other Specialized Agencies,
Unesco will devote part of its attention to the organiza-
tion of the technical and professional training of adoles-
cent workers. This. Unesco believes. is a matter of urgent
necessity.
Until now, intelnational and national voluntary agen-
cies which have organized work camps have drawn
largely on student and teacher groups. Unesco feels that
young workers and young farmers should also be in-
cluded in the work camp movement.
DURING 1949, Unesco will consequently approach tradeunions and workers'educational associations as well
as the United Nations organization mentioned above, to
arouse their interest and inspire their collaboration in
the apprenticeship problems of wa-handicapped adoles-
cents.
At the same time Unesco will seek to broaden the
recruitment basis for youth camps so as to include these
groups of the younger generation which until now have
not received sufficient attention.
In addition Unesco will expand its overall programme
of aid to work camps generally through greater assis-
tance to these organizations in developing their educa-
tional programmes, supplying libraries on international
affairs and other subjects.
Youth Camp Leaders
ONE of the weaknesses of the youth camp movementlies in the present lack of trained leaders. To meet
this need in part, Unesco, working with the organizations
responsible for such movements, will publish in 1949, the
of War
first handbook of its kind in the world for camp leaders.
This handbook will treat all the varied aspects of the
organization and work of voluntary youth camps.
Unesco had already begun preparation, with the Inter-
national Federation of Children s Communities,'created
by Unesco last year, for the organization during the
summer holidays of 1949, of a big international children's
convention as well as a holiday camp in cne of the French
"Children's Republics". This convention will Ocing together
boys and girls from different national children's villages
to get them tc learn one another's way of living.
Child Editors
UNESCO also hopes to be able, with the Federation, toinitiate the publicat : on of an international children's
newspapers, in which children themselves-all citizens of
different"villages"and"communities"-will be able to
express their ideas and build an international chain
of friendship and brotherhood.
Plans for this newspaper are being worked out as part
of a proposed World Community Centre to be built in
Pestalozzi Village, Switzerland. The Centre would se. J : ve
as a meeting place for educators engaged in work on
war-handicapped children, and as a nucleus of speciaL
training courses for camp leaders.
Refugees
OTHER new phases of Unesco's"human"Reconstruc-tion programme, as formulated by the Beirut Con-
ference, include assistance to refugees driven from their
homes by military operations in the Middle East and aid
to refugee intellectuals everywhere.
In collaboration with officers delegated by r, he UN to
examine refugee problems in the Middle East, Unesco
has already completed a study of the educational needs
of 800, 000 refugees. Of these, 200, 000 are of school age.
The study will be used for stimulating campaigns to
provide these refugees with basic educational needs.
Unesco will also co-operate with the IRO in order to
find suitable employment for refugee intellectuals. Unesco
Member States will be asked to call upon their educa-
tional institutions to aid this employment programme.
The Material Problems
'mA/HEN microscopes and other scientific equipment
arrive by plane over the waters of the Pacific
and start a run-down Phiiippine laboratory going
again ; when a standard library with its 30 books becomes
a prized possession of an Austrian university and rapidly
achieves a long waiting list of readers ; when a scientific
review received in a youth camp library is prized as the
only copy in all northern Italy and helps, in its small
way, to bridge the years of intellectual isolation caused
by the war, Unesco feeis that the laborious job of re-
building and rye-equipping the damaged institutions of the
world is achieving results.
Millions of people in many countries have found in
educational reconstruction a positive, concrete way of
expressing their goodwill towards other nations and their
fervent desire for a decent and peaceful world.
The core of the problem, in reality, lies in what
Americans ca. ll"know-how''-that is in knowing and
ensuring that the right things are sent to the right
places.
Through its fact-finding surveys, Unesco has been
attempting to bring to light the"right things needed
in the right places".
Thus, Volume II of the Book of Needs, which will
appear early in 1949, as a result of Unesco's 1948 surveys,
will point up the acute shortages and the pressing prob-
lems of the devastated countries of Asia.
In a similar effort to give the facts and arouse the
people's conscience to the needs of the war-hit countries.
Unesco will publish, eaorly in 1949, a series of booklets
showing how libraries, art ga ! Ieries, museums and
scientific laboratories have suffered as a result OÍ war-
damage. Special pamphlets will also appear on the prob-
lems of child war victims and children's communities.
, In collaboration with the United Nations Film Board
and the United States National Commission, Unesco is
preparing two films for 1949. The Lrst will depict the
vast cultural destruction suffered by invaded countries
and efforts being made to repair those losses. The second
film will tell the tragic story of child victims of the, war.
Emergency Aid
OF Unesco's budget for 1949, $175, 000 has been set asidefor its Emergency Aid Fund to meet some of the
special high-priority needs Gf the war-hit countries.
This necessarily limited contribution, however, can meet
only a tiny fraction of the total needs. Even if the entire
Unesco Reconstruction budget of $420, 000 were ear-marked
for direct re-builaing purposes, it would hardly suffice to
build one up-to-date school.
The main task of raising funds and 0rganizÏng othec
forms of aid had been undertaken by national and inter-
national voluntary organizations, with Unesco assisting
them as a stimulating and co-ordinating agent. We have
already seen that, thanks to this effort, over $100, 000, 000
was collected in 1948.
Unesco will therefore continue to encourage national
campaigns and help voluntary agencies to increase their
already outstanding efforts.
Many of these agencies are now working in unison as
members of the Temporary Council for Educational
Reconstruction (TICER) whose headquarters are located
at Unesco House in Paris and whose secretariat is provided
by Unesco. TICER member-agencies now total 28 and
represent over 700 national organizations in more than
60 countries.
Unesco will also continue to work closely with the
International Children's Emergency Fund so that part
of the funds raised by its campaigns is devoted to educa-
tional needs.
Transition to Construction
The Beirut Conference, while fully recognizing that
the needs of devastated countries must continue to have
priority, resolved that Unesco will, in future years, effect
a gradual transition from reconstruction to a long-term
constructive programme of development of education,
science and culture in all countries and in under-
developed areas in particular.
During 1949 Unesco will accordingly develop a study-
plan,. with the International Bureau of Education, to
determine the needs of countries which have been unable
for social and economic reasons to reach adequate educa-
tional levels. This study will give preliminary indications
as to the degree and time of Unesco's transition from
reconstruction to construction.

OF ALL AGES
M N his inaugurat address on December10. 1948, before the General Con-
ference in Beirut, Dr. Torres Bodet,
Director General of Unesco, pointed out
that"no clear-cut line can be drawn
between the duties of the educator and
the obligations of the diplomat".
"For", he said."if the former brings up
new generations to believe in intolerance,
in conformity with some inhuman form
of nationalism, the diplomat in his turn
will find himself compelled to pursue a
policy of aggression or to practise tactics
"dictated by spite or envy. Peoples, in their
'-international conduct reveal the same
characteristics that they have revealed in
the class-room at school."
Unesco feels, in effect, that by getting
teachers to think internationally and to
understand other customs and habits, it
will be paving the road for global thinking
by the younger generations.
The Beirut Conference called upon all
teachers and educationists to make every
effort"in primary and secondary schools...
both in teaching and in framing pro-
grammes of study, to avoid inculcating
by word or implication, the belief that
lands, peoples and customs other than
one's own are necessarily inferior, or are
otherwise unworthy of understanding and
sympathy".
International-Minded Teachers
UNESCO itself has mapped out a pro-gramme designed to encourage inter-
nationaJ-mindedness amongst teachers
and young people alike, through educa-
tional seminars. the revision of textbooks.
educational missions. competitions for
youth and through its work towards an
Educational Charter foe Youth.
Unesco will, of course, continue to
develop its overall programme to im-
prove educational standards generally
throughout the world, by serving as an
educational"exchange and mart", and
providing information on the contributions
of each country and its most pressing
needs in education.
Among the more active methods which
will be carried out during the next twelve
months for bringing about this cross-
fertilization of educational ideae. are the
ioUowmg.
t Schools and Youth
'u NESCO will attempt to find ways ofassociating th  youth of the worldwith all of Unesco's pr gramme in
general. Last year, for example, the Or-
ganlzation launched two competitions-an
essay and a Dostec contest-to arouse
interest in Unesco's work. Entries for
these competitions must be posted before
July 1, 1949, and later in the year Un=
will announce the winners and make the
awards. These will consist of grants for
travel abroad, either for study or to
attend a conference on world affairs, or
to purchase books and other educational
material.
Unesco, however, is onlv one part of the
family of the United Nations. The
Teachers'Seminar held in New York last
year prepared a large number of materials
to help in teaching about the UN and its
Agencies. These are now being edited and
will be sent to Member States early in
1949, along with a forthcoming publications
on"Suggestions and Recommendations on
Teaching about the UN and its Agencies".
During 1949. Unesco will place special
emphasis on the development of inter-
national understanding through geography
teaching. A Teachers'Guide, showing
how, by using an historic approach, pupils
between 15 and 18 years of are can be
interested in the DECLARATION OF
HUMAN RIGHTS will also be prepared.
Unesco will continue to work toward an
international Charter for Youth.
This Charter, which would complement
the Declaration of Human Rights, would
specify that distinctions of colour. race.
sex or religion should not operate against
any groll9 of young people and that no
young person should be deprived of in-
struction suited to his capacities by reason
of financial handicap.
In many of its activities to encourage
education for international understanding
in schools. Unesco will continue to work
in close collaboration with the United
Nations itself, and with other interna-
tional orga. nizaWms slICh as the Interna-
tional Bureau of Education (IBE) in
Oeneva.
Educational Missions
E of Unesco's chief functions in thefield off Education is to find out the
most urcent needs of its Member States
and to help out, where it can, in meeting
these needs.
Several of Unesco's Member States have
asked the Organization to send"Educa-
tional MißSions"to help them survey and
improve their educational systems. Two
missions have already been arranged for
1949 to visit the Philippines and Afghanis-
tan.
The Philippine Government is considec-
ing the re-organization of its Educational
system, and with this in view, has asked
Unesco to undertake a survey of its
elementary, secondary and adult educa-
tion. The mission will probably begin work
at the end of January 1949.
The Afghanistan Mission will study the
vocational education system of the country
as well as elementary and secondary
education.
It is hoped that a thicd Mission will be
organized in 1949...,'--'r."
Educational Seminars.
./HAT started out as an experiment
two years ago in bringing teachers
and educators from different parts
of the world together to talk over their
special problems and getting to under-
stand one another's ways, has had such
success that Unesco's General Conference
in Beirut decided to put its international
teachers'Seminars On a more permanent
footing.
Unesco will therefore arrange for two
more Seminars in 1949 and prepare for a
further two in 1950.
The first 1949 Seminar, to be held in
India, will discuss adult education in rural
areas. The second (in Brazil) to be
planned as a joint enterprise of the Pan
American Union, the Government of
Brazil and Unesco, will have as its theme
the problem of combatting illiteracy.
In addition, Unesco will begin the prep-
aration of materials and documentation
for the two 1950 Seminars, one on the
teaching of geography in relation to inter-
national understanding, and the other on
the revision of textbooks, with special
emphasis on history books.
.
Improvements of Textbooks
THIS Seminar on textbook revision willundoubtedly serve to'highlight the
work carried out by Unesco in. 1948 and
1949 in the general field of textbook im-
provement.
Unesco has already worked out a set
of principles and criteria as well as a
Model Plan that will help countries to
analyse their school textbooks to prevnt
exaggerated national bias. These criteria
and the Model Plan will be published as a
handbook by the end of January 1949.
Work with Universities
AS another step in its programme tobring word educators together to talk
over their problems and learn each other's
ways, Unesco called a conference of
university leaders in 1948. This meeting
decided to create a world Universities
Bureau which will be set up in 1949 and
will serve as a clearinlr house for all
matters of interest to colleges and uni-
versities the world over.
WI< : have seen that Unesco is strivingVv to buud the will for world peace
by reaching out to the minds of
young persons in elementary and secon-
dary schools, that it is drawing teachers
and university leaders together from all
corners of the globe.
Unesco's aim, however, is to reach out
to the minds of ordinary citizens every-
where. This means that Unesco cannot
neglect the education of the whole adult
population and that it must look to the
needs of the millions who still lack the
very basic elements of education (Funda-
mental Education).
Adult Education
AN important change has taken placein recent years in the very conception
of Adult Education. In many countries it
was originally conceived to fin the gaps
left by inadequate schooling or to provide
apprenticeship training for a trade.
Today, adult education is also concerned
with meeting the needs for further edu-
cation of those who have even had a
university education.
,. Today adult education activities range
from evening courses to musical and
dramatic performances. It includes do-
mestic and technical training and
nourishes such leisure-time interests as
the arts and crafts, folk-dancing and
hobbies.
Unesco feels that the time is ripe for
the pooling of techniques and experiments
in this rapidly developing field. To provide
workers in adult education with their first
opportunity since the war for exchanging
ideas on the most characteristic develop-
ments in each country and to ensure
among them a feeling of common respons-
ibility, Unesco is calling a Conference on
Adult Education in 1949.
Every country in the world-whether a
member of Unesco or not-will be invited
to send representatives to the meetings
which will be held in Denmark. To prepare
adult education leaders for this con-
ference, Unesco has already published an
attractive pamphlet on Adult Education
which Is being distributed throughout
Member States..
In addition. Unesco has been gathering
information on adult education develop-
ments alt over the world which will be
incorporated into an International Direc-
tory on Adult Education, to be published
in 19411.
Fundamental Education
IN many parts of the world, millions of- *-men. women and children still live
in the most primitive ignorance and su-
perstition. These people lack the basic
intellectual tools of modern existence. Not
only must they learn to read and write,
but they must also be taught how to
check disease, how to use machines, how
to grow their food more efficiently. They
must also acquire the ability to govern
themselves. Only thus can they become
useful partners in a world community.
The Fundamental Education campaigns
carried out during the past years by coun-
tries such a. s China. Mexico, and Turkey
represent only a"dcop in the fundamental
education bucket", as it were.
Similar experiments are being carried
out effectively in many remote spots on
the globe. Until now, the results of these
efforts have not been available in system-
matic, co-ordinated form, to that work in
one country has rarely benefitted workers
in another.
Unesco's Clearing House in Funda-
mental Education is an attempt to pool
such information, analyze it and make
it available to field workers everywhere.
In 1949, Unesco will begin publication of
a Quarterly Bulletin of Fundamental
Education as well as a : Monthly Abstrad
Service of articles to fill this much-needed
gap.
HAITI PILOT PROJECT : In 1948. Unesco
undertook preliminary surveys for a
Pilot Project in the Marbial Valley of
Haiti. Pending a report from the
CARTOONS FOR EDUCATION :
in IMS, unesco began work on a Fun-
damental Education experiment, rich
in potentialities, in which an animated
cartoon specialist will attempt to
"marry"the work of Chinese artists
with Western techniques of animation.
In this wholiy new enterprise, Unesco
is co-operating with Jimmy Yen's
famous Mass Education Movement in
China in the production of sample
films, film-strips, charts and other
materials for the education oi illiterate
adults.
The first theme on which materials
are being prepared for 1949 is"A
Healthy Village". The Mass Education
Movement in China will provide a
testing ground for all the teaching
materials produced.
United Nations Mission to Haiti, on
which Unesco was represented, final
decisions as to the nature and scope
of the project was held up. In the
meantime, however, there has been
quite a remarkable upsurge of spon-
taneous activity amongst the inhabi-
tants of the Marbial Valley as a result
of Unesco's preliminary survey. During
the coming year it is hoped that this
undertaking will be able to show posi-
tive, definite results.

THE RURAL.-

WORLD CENTRE
OF SCIENTIFIC LIAISON
Aid to Organizations
in the Pure
and Applied Sciences
JrINCE its creation in 1946, Unesco hasrecogn : zed tile important contribu-
tion made by international non-gov-
ernmental organizations in the fields of
the pure and applied sciences in further-
ing the a ; ms and purposes of Unesco and
in showing how people of all countries
can work together on concrete problems.
Through grants-in-aids and contracts to
organizations, such as the International
Council of Scientific Unions (ICSU) and
its ten federated Unions (Astronomy,
Biological Sciences, Chemistry, Crystallo-
graphy, Geography, Geodesy and Geo-
physics, History of Science, Pure and
Applied Physics. Scientific Radio. and
Theoretical and Applied Mechanics), the
World Power Conference, the World
Engineering Conference and various In-
ternational Medical Congresses. Unesco
has given renewed life and vigour to the
work of international scientific collabora-
tion.
In the fields of Agricultural and Medi-
cal Sciences Unesco's work is closely co-
ordinated with the Food and Agricultural
Organization and the World Health
Organization.,
Aid to Over 100 Enterprises
IN reviewing the effectiveness ofUnesco's grants-in-aid for the pure
sciences, the General Conference at
Beirut voted to increase the proposed sum
for 1949 from an originally planned S192.-
010 to $200, 000. and approved a substan-
tial amount for contracts for the applied
sciences. In this way. Unesco will stimu-
late greater teamwork between professors.
students, research workers, engineers and
doctors all over the globe and will fur-
ther help these groups to develop a truly
international spirit based on common
work and common ideals.
The grants-in-aid and contracts will
make possible over one hundred differ'nit
enterprises, including intemationat sym-
posia on important and urgent scientific
subjects, increased travel grants to enable
scientists to pursue work in countries
other than their own. the publication of
the reports of international congresses,
organizational assistance to nascent in-
ternational bodies, preparation of special
studies for Unesco. etc.
In April 1949, a meeting to create a
Permanent Council for the Cho-ordination
of International Congresses of Medical
Sciences will be held in Brussels. Belgium,
in collaboration with WHO. The World
Health Organization has allocated the
sum of $20. 000 for 1949 to assist in the
organization of this Council. The Coun-
cil will be an independent non-govern-
mental organization, with agreements
with Unesco and WHO. The Council will
press forward the publication of the re-
sults of the Congresses to spread new
medical knowledge to the widest inter-
national public.
Scientific Literature
 ONSIDERABLE progress has al-
1'-./read been made on the interna-
tionally vital problem of what is
called"Science abstracting". As in most
other parts of Unesco's programme, this
work is carried on in close co-operation
not only with other aspects of the Organ-
ization's programme (Libraries), but
with other Agencies of the United Na-
tions (WHO, FAO).
It is estimated that about a million
technical articles are published in differ-
ent countries each year. Since no scien-
tist can possibly hope to read all the arti-
cles even within his special field of in-
terest, abstracts or resumes of these
articles are published. However, some
articles are abstracted many times and
others not at ail.
Unesco has set itself the goal of at-
tempting to achieve a co-ordination of
the activitie ! l of different abstracting
organization. Already an Interim Co-
ordinating Committee on Medical and
Biological Abstracting has been formed
under the auspices of Unesco and WHO.
A world Conference on science abstract-
ins and other problems concerning scien-
tific literature will be held in Unesco
House i ! 1- June 1949.
Muiti-Iingual
Scientific Dictionaries
DURING the next twelve months,Unesco will also begin preli inary
studies for the preparation of authorita-
tive multi-lingual scientific dictionaries by
establishing co-operation between pub-
lishers and scientific bodies. Such co-oper-
ation is greatly needed at the present
time and its scope is such that on ! y an
international organization such as Unesco
could successfully stimulate it.
In collaboration nvith FAO, Unesco will
aid in maintaining and operating the
Library of the International Institute of
Agriculture in Rome during 1949. Unesco
will provide an emergency grant of $15,-
000 towards the upkeep of the Rome
Library.
is estimated that approximately 50 per
cent will be spent on scientific equipment.
Credits will be allocated to various insti-
tutions in these countries for the pur-
chase of scientific equipment, of their
own choice, through Unesco.
SCIENCE CO-OPERATION
OFFICES
HROUGH its four Science Co-opera-tion Offices. located in the Middle
East (Cairo). East Asia (Nanking
and Shanghai), South Asia (Delhi) and
Latin America (Montevideo). Unesco is
overcoming the feeling of isolation and
even abandonment in which many scien-
tific groups still find themselves in vari-
ous parts of the world.
These stations or science"bases"will
continue to aid scientists and technicians
to raise the local standards of living and
to facilitate the exchange of scientific
knowledge and information within the
regions and with the rest of the world.
The peoples in the regions are thus given
a feeling of being a part of the. world
community and of taking part in its
modern development.
In view of the success of these Offices,
the Beirut Conference agreed that such
activities should be maintained"as an un-
dertaking of the highest priority in the
Natural Sciences programme".
Scientific Apparatus
IIE Beirut Conference approved thefurther development of the Scien-
tific Apparatus Information Service
(SAIS), whose establishment was recom-
mended by the Conference of Allied Min-
isters of Education in London. Thy novel
service answers queries concerning scien-
tific and technological apparatus for edu-
cation and research. ;
In order to extend the available services
of information. assurances of close co-X
operation have been obtained from repre-
sentatives of scientific equipment manu-
facturers in nine countiies. Such contacts
are being further extended to include
universities, research associations and
international scientific organizations.
There has been a long-felt need among
science teachers the world over for an
internationally agreed standard of basic
equipment for teaching science in pri-
mary and secondary schools, universities
and technical college.
To meet this need Unesco has obtained
the services of experts in five leading
countries to compile such inventories, and
it is planned to publish them during
1949 in French. English and Spanish and
later in Chinese and Arabic.
Scientific-'leconstruction
tm-\ URING 19M Unesco purchased abouta quarter of a million dollars worth
of scientific equipment for the war-
devastated countries of Europe and Asia.
In addition to this Unesco has been asked
to spend a quarter of a million dollars
for Educational Reconstruction on behalf
of the London Lord Mayor's Fund.
In 1949 a sum of S175000 has been set 8
aside by Unesco for Reconstruction of
war-devastated countries. Of this sum. it
scientific theme of current international
importance. For 1949 the theme selected
is FOOD AND PEOPLE (for further de-
tails see Mass Communications. Projects
Division, Page 7 of this Supplement.)
Conservation of Resources
and Protection of Nature
II N July 1949 the United Nations iscalling a Scientific Conference on
the Conservation and Utilization of
Resources. Unesco has participated in the
preparations for this Conference especial-
SPECIAL PROJECTS
Popularization of Science
and its Social Implications
HE principal goal of Unesco in thefield of science popularization is to
make available to the general pub-
lic information on new scientific and
technological discoveries and to spread
understanding of the scientific attitude
and methods.
During 1949 it is planned to dissemin-
ate reports prepared by experts familiar
with popularization of science through
the press, radio, films and museums. It
is also planned to call a meeting of
science club organizers to consider ways
of increasing the international effective-
ness of such clubs and to co-operate in
the development of Unesco's Adult Educa-
tion programme.
At Mexico City Unesco decided to
launch a programme to initiate in Mem-
ber States discussions each year on a
ly concentrating on the prob : ems of edu-
cation for conservation.
Unesco is calling, jointly with the new-
ly established International Union for
the Protection of Nature, an Interna-
tional Technical Conference on the Pro-
tection of Nature. It will be held in the
U. S. A. immediately following the United
Nations Conference.
International
Scientific Institutes
HE International Institute of thejj Hylean Amazon is expected to start
on its first programme of research
during 1949. At Beirut a $12, 000 subven-
tion to the new Institute was approved to
cover projects of special interest to
Unesco.
A new venture along this line was pro-
posed by India and approved by the
Beirut Conference. During 1949 Unesco
will study the possibilities of establishing
an INTERNATIONAL INSTITUTE OF
THE ARID ZONE which would devote vets
efforts to the problems of the ever-ex-
panding desert areas that now cover one-
fourth of the earth's surface.
Another new aspect of Unesco's 1949
programme in the Natural Sciences will
be a preliminary study towards the pos-
sible establishment of an international
computation centre.
Today few countries possess modern,
high-speed calculating equipment capable
of making complex computations needed
in many branches of pure and applied
science. An International Computation
Centre, especially available to countries
lacking specialized equipment, is con-
sidered of great value.

THE UNESCO Bl
lr HE budget of Unesco. for 1949 totals$7, 780, 000.
Following the procedure they
adopted at Mexico City in 1947, the
delegates to the Beirut Conference
began, on 23 November, by fixing the
ceiling budget for the financial year
1949, before discussing the Programme
in any detail. This was placed at
8. 000. 000 dollars, a : led finally reduced to
$7. 780, 000.
The budgetary ceiling which the Con-
ference set itself, enabled the delegates
to elect the most important and urgent
among the projects ; which had been sub-
mitted. and to define clearly the prac-
tical scope, in 1949, of those adopted.
The Programme budget for Unesco's
six Departments, in order of size of the
appropriation, follows :

- THE SOCIAL
..
NGES
on has now reached a stage
zit in his history where he can
study scientifically the causes
of the tensions that make for war". Eight
prominent social scientists, brought to-
gether by Unesco during 1948. worked out
and signed a common statement on the
causes of world friction beginning with
the words just quoted.
"modern wars between nations and
groups of nations", this 12-point statement
continues,"are fostered by many of the
myths, traditions and symbols of national
pride handed down from one generation
to another".
Study of Fascism in Germany
and Italy
As part of its broad programme onTensions Affecting International
Understanding, Unesco is undertaking in
1949 an important study of some of these
myths, traditions and symbols of national
pride which lay at the root of Fascism in
Germany and Italy.
It is true that the origins of German
Nazism and Italian Fascism have been
the subject of study by individual before.
Unesco feels, however, that by getting
social scientists from all parts of the
world to work together on this subject,
and by organizing intensive research with
documentary material now available but
not yet adequately exploited, it will be
able to achieve new and more revealing
results. In this way, Unesco hopes it can
assist in the early recognition of similar
movements of this kind in the future.
Community studies
he study of the origin and develop-ment of Fascism is only one new
development In Unesco's"Ten-
sions"progmmme. In 1949, Unesco will
also undertake a series of : ntensive
studies of individual commu'''es to
"determine the distinctive character of
the various national cultures".
These enquiries will be arranged as a
number of"pilot studies"in four coun-
tries-France, India, Hungary and Aus-
tralia-presentjn widely varying cultur-
al patterns. In each country at least two
distinctly different communities wHl be
selected for study to determine whether
"national"characteristics emerge in
spite of the differences between one
community and another. The studies will
be carried on under the direct super-
vision of scientific organizations in these
four countries.
A preliminary meeting of a small group
of special scientists-anthropologists,
social psychologists and psychiatrists-
will be held at Unesco House from
January 24-28, to prepare the way for
this whole investigation. Among these
experts will be representatives from the
WHO and the World Federation of Mean..
al Health.
"Way of Life"series
THE community studies will in no wayduplicate or replace the"Way of
Life"series begun in 1948 which will be
continued in 1949. They will serve rather
to supplement that series by the use of
more intensive methods.
Early in 1948, Unesco enlisted the co-op-
eration of the International Studies Con-
ference to prepare a series of monographs
on the"Way of Life", of various peoples
of the world, including France, Norway,
Poland. Switzerland. Canada. India and
Hungary.
A number of additional countries are
being asked to prepare similar memoranda
during the next twelve months, and
Unesco will publish several volumes in
this serves.. _
Population and Technological
Change
ANTHER new aspect of Unesco's 1949"Tensions"programme deals with the
relations between population problems
and technological changes on the one
hand. and international tensions on the
other.
Two'studies will be undertaken in this
field. One on the effect of modern tech-
nology on international tensions (in collab-
oration with the International Labour
Organization). The other on the relation
between population problems, especially
as related to '1inority and immigrant
groups, and international relations. This
latte1"work will be carried out in collab-
oration with ECOSOC.
What do you think of your
neighbours ?
DURING the past twelve months Unescoasked various organizations to help
in studies to find out what people in one
country think of their own and other
nations.
A number of surveys of the"public
opinion"type were conducted in the
U. S. A., France, U. K., Australia the
Netherlands, Norway, Italy, China and
Mexico. Studies were also completed of
the treatment of certain foreign groups
in U. S. films and in the American press
and radio. The results of these studies
w ; qj be published in 1949.
) g N all of its activities in the field oftensions", Unesco is seeking to en-
courage and facilitate co-operative
international research by social scientists.
It is gathering together and examining
critically the results of such research and
is serving to make these results available
to social scientists. educators and others
throughout the world.

statement on the causes of tensions which
make for war so aptly put it :
"The social scientist can help make
clear to people of all nations that the
freedom and welfare of one are ultimat-
ely bound up with the freedom and
welfare of all. that the word need not
continue to be a place where men must
either kill or be killed".
Standards of political science
TOURING 1949. the Social SciencesDepartment of Unesco will continue
research into the technique of internat-
ional conferences in order to develop more
effective methods of planning and con-
ducting such conferences.
Unesco will also continue its work on
the methods and techniques in Political
Science. A report, stressing recommenda-
tions for the promotion of international
standards in political science, will prob-
ably be published in 1949
SOCIAL scientists have long feist theneed for a world organization, similar
to the International Council of Scientific
Unions, which would knit their work
together on an international level and
increase their effectiveness.
Unesco is actively engaged in aiding
three of the principal social sciences
(economics, sociology and political
science) to set up international associa-
tions-for the first time in their History.
In each of these three discipline an in-
: ernational Congress is planned for 1949.
By this means Unesco hopes to advance
the scientific standards in each of these
fields, and to promote the setting up of
national associations of economists, sociol-
ogists and political scientists in countries
where no associations at present exist.
Eventually, Unesco hopes that an Inter-
national Council of the Social Sciences
will also be created which will speak for
social scientists as a whole the world over.

Philosophy and Humanistic Studies
ALTH-OUGH : n the jield oj the
A'-Natural Sciences Unesco's ideal is
unqualified universal'ty. the same
principle cannot be applied in the fields
of the Humanistic Sciences. Here diversity
is legitimate ant any attempt at artifICial

human group. Here too, however, Unesco
has a ritul role to play in securing univer-
sality Of a kind, but the an'versality which
must"be sought is that oj mutual under-
stan ( ! : Kf/ a ? tf ! not o/ ! eucH ! f.t ding and not oj levelling.
In organizing its PhilQsophic Round
Tables Unesco's aim is to consult the best,
the clearest, and the most sensitive minds
of the contemporary world, to enable them
to clarify its work, and to associate them-
selves with its endeavours. These Round
Tables will supply a meeting place for
people in different fields : writers, artists,
scientists, men of action, or philosophers,
and they will have as their subject these
problems of values which are central to
Unesco's task.
IN 1949 Unesco will organize a RoundTable discussion on the complex ques-
tion of the freedom and responsibility of
the artist. This will be designed to isolate
the undcrlying significance of the concept
of freedom of artistic creation, without
neglecting the concomitant problem of the
rf) ationship between the artist and the
public, and of the artist's responsibility
(see next page''Freedom of the Artist").
In another series. Unesco will endeavour
to convene leading men of letters and
thinkers, and will ask them to determine
the position of modern intellectuals
towards the problem of peace in a world
which has never been more highly con-
scious, but which at the same time, has
never been more disturbed.
Inquiry into Ideological Conflicts
"WHERE are some problems so graveand complex that more elaborate
methods must be adopted to explore
them properly and to arrive at conclusions
capable of application in the present state
of international affairs. A mere d. scussion,
however profound, between prominent
personalities would be inadequate in such
a matter as the misundel'8tandings so
often implicit in the use of the commonest
political concepts.
Words like"democracy","equality",
"law"seem clear enough. In fact. however,
each is a tangled complex of ideas which
must be patiently unravelled in order to
eliminate the powers of suggestion and
the possibilities of discord which arise
from the ambiguous use of such words.
It is with this in mind that l'nescc will
complete, in 1949, an inquiry begun in
1948 into the varying connotations of
democracy. Unesco has chosen the concept
of democracy because it has felt that it is
the most important stake in contemporary
political discussions.
Unesco drafted a detailed. precise ques-
tionnaire which was sent to National
Commissions and to a large number of
specialists in Member States. During the
coming months, a Committee wit ! study
the replies received and sum up its
findings. The result t wii ! provide a veri-
table catalogue of the accepted meanings
of the word'democracy", and of the
misunderstandings revealed by the in-
quiry.
Comparative Study of Cultures
IH OWEVER, if the study of politicalconcepts is at the core of the
whole task of pacification, it must
not be forgotten that these comparatively
clear and easily defined ideas are only a
small part of the complexity of a partic-
ular culture.
It is often said that civilization is pay.
sing through a crisis, that mankind is
no longer agreed on the content of a
common civilization which all nat. ons
could adopt, and which teachers could
propagate ; each people feels that. it has
an original contribution to make two the
jo : nt creation of the human civilization
of to-morrow. But what is that contribu-
tion ? And how frequently is the idea of
an original contribution clouded by pride
or an inferiority complex-both 01 which
are often inter-related ?
In view 01 this, Unesco has undertaken
an inquiry to determine how far the
cultures of the various who. old areas either
do, or without much difficulty could, in-
fluence each other. Conversely Unesco
wants to find out how much mutual
understanding, and a possible pooling of
certain elements, are checked bv deep-
seated antipathies which could be isolated
and eventually eliminated.
Scientific and Cultural History
of lUankind
) m t NESCO feels that a scientific andcuìtliral history of mankind, pre-
pared with a truiv international
spirit and Jß keeping with all modern
scientific data is strongly needed to-day.
Such a history, Unesco feels, should be
widely distributed throughout the world,
once it is completed.
This. however, is a long-term task which
can best be carried out in two stages :
first the preparation of small textbooks
for pupils and teachers in schools all over
the world. These textbooks would tell the
story of man's progress, not by citing
examples of wars, or Qûlitical deals devoid
of any humane significance, but by show-
ing the slew rise of civilization through
the combined efforts of all peoples.
The second stage would utilize aU
modern scientific means to draw up a
great synthesis of the history of mankind
from the point of view of scientific
progress and cultural achievement.
International Council
lr 0 accomplish all these t. asks it isnecessary that. Unesco bring together
the world's best minds as often as
possible. More than that, however, it
must also encourage and support the
great international learned societies of the,
world which can ensure the continuity of
relationships and exchanges necessary for
the creation of a common outlook trans-
cending national frontiers and the strict
confines of particular subjects.
Unesco. therefore, will continue in 1949
the work begun in 194a f the foundation
of an International Covpcil of Philoscphy
and Humanist : c Studi. To this end it
will encourage the formation of intern-
ational societies or federations of philo-
sophers, historians. linguists, anthropo-
logists and archaeologists, and wil) asso-
ciate them in a Council where the various
groups may exchange notes and strive to
"-void the perils of ecessive specialization.

CULTURAL INTERCHANGE
.'-
BETWEEN COUNTRIES t
ARTS AND LETTERS
THOUGH supported financially byUnesco, the International Theatre
Institute, with headquarters at
Paris, is a young independent organiz-
ation working to encourage and facilitate
theatrical exchar. ges of all types.
At present, Unesco is making prepara-
tions for the foundation, on similar auto-
nomous lines, of an International Or-
ganization for Music. The preliminary
investigation has been made and a com-
mittee of experts and of representatives
of specialized international organiza-
tions is to meet at Unesco House to con-
sider the possibility of such an organiza-
tion of its programme and its constitu-
tion.
Unesco has also undertaken the pre-
paration of catalogues of existing re-
corded music, which, it is hoped, will
prove of the utmost value to the general
public, schools and projessionnal musi-
cians of all countries. Three catalogues
are in course of preparation and will
cover Western and Oriental classical
music and folk music..
Reproductions of Paintings
similar effort is being made regard-
® ing art reproductions. Unesco ispreparing lists of the fine repro-
ductions currently available in all coun-
tries. A cataloue of reproductions of
western paintings since 1860 is in course
of preparation and will be followed this
year by a second catalogue covering
paintings prior to that date. Catalogues
on oriental painting will also be com-
pleted.
The finest reproductions, selected with
the assistance of highly qualified experts,
and covering major periods in the history
of art, will be made available to school
and other education groups, so that they
may arrange travelling exhibitions for
the countries most lacking in original
works.
Closely connected with the preceding
projects is Unesco's task of encouraging
Member States to take steps to strengh-
then the role of the arts in teaching and
general culture. Committees are in
course of organization in several coun-
tries, and an international committee
wille be convened at Unesco in 1949 to
report on this subject and publish its
results.
Literary Pool
IN the field of Letters the Interna-tional Pool of'Literature enables
reviews 1M all countries to offer to
their readers articles published in the
reviews of other lands, and sometimes
original works, through a scheme of
translations and exchanges. During 1949
it will devote special attention to forg-
ing closer links between distant cultures.
Unesco is now carrying out a plan
drawn up by the international committee
of experts, which met in Paris in 1948,
to increase the translation of literary,
philosophic and scientific works. Steps
have already been taken for the trans-
lation of world classics into Arabic. and
of Arabic classics into other fanfares.
A similar programme has begun for
Latin America, and will be applied later
to other regions of the world.
Unesco is also to resume the publica-
tion of the Index Translationum fonnely
published by the International Institute
of Intellectual Co-operation.
Freedom of the Artist
II N addition to the programme out-
lined above, the Arts and Letters
Division will this year undertake an
inquiry into the way in which artists
can serve the ends of Unesco and into
the obstacles of all kinds preventing the
free exercice of their art. This inquiry
will enable the Director-General to
submit to the next General Conference
concrete plans designed to improve the
working conditions of artists in the
world.
Unesco will also study the possibility
of creating a series of annual awards
to be made on the recommendation of
recognized international authorities for
the best musical, theatrical, artistic and
literary works produced during the pre-
ceding twelve months.
MUSEUMS AND HISTORIC
MONUMENTS
I () URING the coming months Unescowill devote considerable effort to
the questions of scientific, technic-
al and art museums, work on which in
1948 has already made considerable
progress.
Consideration will also be given to the
problem of the protection and conserva-
tion of ancient monuments of artistic
and cultural significance.
The projects now in hand stress the
international contacts and future ac-
tivities to be effected through museums.The most important of these projects
calls for the co-operation of Member
States of Unesco in a scheme for the
organization of international exchange
of exhibitions. It is based on reports
furnished by the International Council
of Museums and by experts from all parts
of the world. These reports bring out
the present difficulties and make re-
commendations for surmounting them.
The second volume of Museum, the
quaterly review of museographical
technique, will be published during 1949.
It will include issues on the conservation
of works of arts, archeaological sites and
ancient monuments, on the new tech-
niques perfected in Swedish museums ;
on the teaching role of museums and the
technique of its application. Co-opera-
tion with the International Council of
Museums, with its world experience and
world-wide influence will be intensified.
On the basis of the inquiries con-
ducted in 1948 and of the report sub-
mitted by the experts of the Interna-
tional Council of Museums, the Secreta-
riat will prepare draft proposals design-
ed to secure access to archaeological sites,
which will be submitted to Member
States for consideration.
The problem of the protection against
destruction, and, where necessary the
restoration, of ancient monuments and
historic sites is assuming an alarming
degree of acuteness and gravity in many
Member States. The Secretariat has been
instructed by the General Conference to
investigate, in co-operation with the In-
ternational Council of Museums, the
desirability of setting up, under Unesco's
auspices, an international committee of
experts and the possibility of creating
an international fund to subsidize the
work of preservation and restoration.
COPYRIGHT
A FTER overcoming the initial dif-
/L ficulties of a new activity and the
establishment of a truly effective
network of international relations, the
Copyright Division completed in 1948 the
launching of the vast inquiry into com-
parative law.
In 1949, the Copyright Division will
study replies received to its 1948 inquiry
on comparative law. The results will
then be submitted to Unesco's Member
States. Thereafter the result of the in-
quiry and the remarks of Member States
will be submitted for study by an inter-
national copyright committee, which will
decide on the future drafting of a Uni-
versal Copyright Convention.
unesco's
.
Fellowship Programme
THERE are thousands of people todayB who would like to study in other
countries and exchange ideas with.
those from whom they have been isolated
for many years. While many governments,
universities, foundations and charitable
institutions are actively promoting inter-
national study, very often information
about such opportunities. is not easily
available to those who could best benefit
from them.
Unesco's programme in 1949 for the
interchange of persons will attempt to
remedy this situation, at least in part, by
expanding the work already v beI1 : un i  past
years. Unesco will carry out its programme
by means of three chief methods.
First by gathering together, analyzing
and making available information on in-
ternational fellowship programmes and
similar opportunities for study abroad.
Second, by planning and encouraging new
fellowship schemes in its Member States,
National Commissions and interested
agencies. Third, by promoting and ad-
ministering both Unesco-sponsored and
Unesco-financed fellowships.
Although Unesco's major job will
continue to be to stress fellowship oppor-
tunities for mature persons such as
scientists, librarians, museum personnel
and radio and film technicians, etc.,
attention will also be given to the prob-
lems of young peoples'exchanges.
Fellowship Handbook
THE most important tool developed byUnesco for the stimulation of study
in other countries is Unesco's"Study
Abroad-International Handbook of
Fellowships, Scholarships and Educational
Exchange", the first volume of which was
published early in January 1949. The
volume, which is the first comprehensive
mapping of an important aspect of inter-
national cultural relations, covers more
than 10, 000 fellowship awards for 1948-49
and includes data from over 20 countries.
The Handbook also contains analyses of
national programmes and other problems
related to the movement of scholars, scien-
tists, technicians and students from coun-
try to country.
Survey Brings Results
.,. JfTUDY ABROAD"is a result of
a detailed enquiry sent to
countries throughout the world
and long months of painstaking inve -
tigation undertaken during 1948. It is a
croncrete example of how the question-
naire-enquiry technique adopted by
Unesco can be made to work. For it has
undoubtedly served as an"eye-opener"for
certain countries, where this type of in-
formation had never before existed in
collected form, by making them aware of
the facilities available in their own coun-
tries..
In April 1949, Unesco hopes to publish
a supplement to Volume I of"Study
Abroad"and later in the year a Second
volume will appear containing materiat
on facilities avaUaMe in 1949L5C.
The participation of the nations of the
world in preparing material for these
periodic reports wiU. Unesco hopes,
stimulate new fellowships and increase
the interest of the various countries in
international study.
New Fellowships
THE information obtained from thesurvey, together with the advice of
other programme Departments of
Unesco, will enable the Organization in
1949 to develop plans for new fellowship
programmes in various Member States.
Special attention will be given to fellow-
ship programmes aimed at developing
trained personnel for press, radio and
film, the social implications of science,
public administration, certain branches
of Education, and certain aspects of the
cultural programme of Unesco.
Scholarships for Young People
- m-HE Beirut Conference urged theextension of Unesco's international
fellowship programme beyond the
more academic area to include all. vies of
artists, technicians, civil servants, indus-
trial and agricultural workers.
In this work, the Exchange of Persons
Department is already working closely
with the Reconstruction Department,
particularly with respect to the work
camps programme (see Chapter on Re-
construction : Human Problems), and
with the Education Department for
the promotion of world understanding
through Seminars and summer courses.
In addit. ion, a consultant has been
engaged to conduct a special investigation
into exchange schemes for young persons.
Unesco will also study ways of extending
the fellowship programme beyond war-
devastated Member States to include the
needs of under-developed areas and trust
territories.
225 Fellowships Administered
AT the present time approximately 225fellowships are being administered by
Unesco. During 1949, Unesco will be res-
ponsibl for about 20 new Unesco fellow-
slúps and for such new opportunities
which the Organization may be called
upon to sponsor ion the course of the
coming year.
CULTURAL LIAISON
OFFICE FOR
MIDDLE EAST
() N the basis of the report submittedto It, after the most thorough in-
vestigation by the Director-General.
the General Conference voted to set up
within the Secretariat, a cultural liaison
office with the special task of encourag-
ing the exchange of ideas, documentary
information, material and persons, be-
tween the countries of the Middle East
and between those countries and other
parts of the world.
This unit, though small in number,
will endeavour to draw up, in consult.
tion with the governments and national
Commissions of the countries concerned,
a programme of cultural liaison in the
field of arts, letters, philosophy and
humanistic studies, in which the first
step will be to encourage translations of
world masterpiéces and collaboration
among the libraries of the Middle East.
BOOKS AND LIBRARIES
us an outcome of contacts establish-
end during the Beirut Conference
Unesco will publish a guide to
Middle East libraries as a practical con-
tribution to the work of the Middle East
Cultural Liaison Office and to cultural
contacts between the Middle East and
the rest of the world. Also, as another
publications project the reproduction is
being organized of a number of highly
important out-of-print periodicals.
Unesco will especially undertake the
publication of manuals in promotion of
public library work and assistance to
public libraries. This is largely based
on the valuable discussions held during
the 1948 Unesco Summer School for
Public Librarians.
Libraries Reconstruction
To a large extent Unesco's librariesprogramme is directly concerned
with the establishment of libraries
- particularly public libraries for the
general readers-with the technical ef-
"f ; cienCy of libraries, the education of. orarians and with the background
library services of bibliography and
documentation.
But in the foreground of this coming
year's work, as of previous years, is the
problem of library reconstruction widely
conceived as the problem of international
library communications and the distri-
bution of publications. All libraries
everywhere are inter-dependent and the
problem of reconstruction cannot be
isolated as affecting only libraries in
war-damaged countries.
The largest part of the Division's work
is concerned with the operation of
Unesco's Clearing House for Publication,
as an advice centre in connection with
all book distribution and exchange ac-
tivity and the promotion of national book
exchange centres.
Bulletin for Libraries
THROUGH the Clearing House,donors of books and periodicals can
obtain accurate and up-to-date ad-
vice on library needs of war-damaged
countries ; the libraries in these countries
can be helped to find the books they need
and. to a limited extent, direct purchase
is made of publications and equipment
for reconstruction area libraries.
A main Clearing House activity is the
publication of a monthly Bulletin for
Libraries, in which needs and offers of
donations and proposals for inter-library
exchange are advertised. The Bulletin
goes free to 6, 500 libraries and has prov-
ed its value as a unique and essentially
practical journal of international library
communication.
A fundamental obstruction to all
library development is the lack of in-
formation on what publications exist
and the deficiencies in bibliographical
services. No librarian can build up his
collection and no scholar conduct his
studies unless he has good bibliographies
on which to base his purchases and.
reading.
This complex and vast problem is
being studied cooperatively with the U. S.
Library of Congress and other national
libraries as a Ions term survey project,
leading towards proposals for practical
improvemen* in bibliographical services.
During 1949 an attempt will be made
to prepare guides to the main biblio-
graphical sources in various Unesco
field.
