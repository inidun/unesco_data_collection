Geometry of abstraction, 2000 B.C.
Masterwork of abstraction, this Persian female deity (20 cm., 8 in. high) carved in stone some
4,000 years ago, was unearthed at Tepe Hissar in northwest Iran, near the Caspian Sea. Reducing
the human form to its simplest expression, with two triangles representing body and limbs,
topped by a cylinder-shaped head, the sculptor has produced a geometric-shaped figure whose
pure forms and lines are strikingly modern. Tepe Hissar (tepe means mound or hillock) is one
of many ancient sites where archaeologists have made rich discoveries of pottery, vases of stone
and metal, jewellery and figurines dating from the Bronze Age.

ONLY ONE EARTH
Proud of his technological mastery
and eager to grasp its benefits, man
has been burning the candle at both
ends and despoiling the biosphere on
which his existence depends. Careless
technology has polluted the oceans,
land and atmosphere to such an extent
that the quality of life Is rapidly depreci¬
ating. At the United Nations Confer¬
ence on the Human Environment, held
in Stockholm last summer, the nations
of the world took the first tentative
steps towards resolving the problem of
safeguarding our planet while at the
same time ensuring an improvement in
the standard of life for the developing
countries.

A world policy
for the
environment
by Lynton K. Caldwell
4
HE basic concept of world
environmental policy and decision¬
making is now the biosphere. This
term, and the idea it expresses, is scar¬
cely more than a century old. Its devel¬
opment has been truly international.
Its origins have been traced to the
French naturalist, Lamarck; the term
first appeared (1875) in the scientific
writings of the Austrian geographer,
Suess; and its full development and
entry into the lexicon of modern
science was largely the work of the
Russian mineralogist, V.l. Vernadsky.
Scientific recognition of the practi-
LYIMTON K. CALDWELL'S Professor of Pub¬
lic and Environmental Affairs and of Poli¬
tical Science at Indiana University (U.S.A.),
and Chairman of the Committee on Environ¬
mental Policy, Law and Administration of the
International Union for Conservation of
Nature and Natural Resources in Morges
(Switzerland). He has published five books
on problems of the environment, including
"Environment: A Challenge to Modern So¬
ciety' (Natural History Press, 1970; Anchor
Paperbacks, 1971), and more than 100 arti¬
cles and papers. His most recent book, 'In
Defense of Earth" (Indiana University Press.
1972) describes the growth of International
efforts to protect the biosphere. A new book,
'Man and Environment: Public Policy and
Administration' will be published In 1973 by
Harper and Row, New York.
cal significance of the complex unity
of the biosphere preceded, by several
decades, a comparable political
awareness. Not until the Paris Bio¬
sphere Conference of 1968, sponsored
by Unesco (in co-operation with the
United Nations, the World Health
Organization, the Food and Agriculture
Organization, the International Union
for Conservation of Nature and Nat¬
ural Resources, and the International
Biological Programme of the Internat¬
ional Council of Scientific Unions) did
the world environment, as biosphere,
appear upon the agenda of official
representatives of nations and inter¬
national organizations.
United Nations conferences in 1949
(Conservation and Utilization of Re¬
sources) and 1963 (Application of
Science and Technology for the Bene¬
fit of Less Developed Areas) may have
tacitly assumed the oneness of the
planet Earth. But they did not exam¬
ine the implications of this complex
unity for man-environment relation¬
ships. The behaviour of peoples and
governments toward the biosphere
was left largely unexplored until 1968.
As often happens in public affairs,
non-governmental action preceded offi¬
cial political recognition. In 1948, at
Fontainebleau (France) with the assis¬
tance of Unesco, the International
Union for Conservation of Nature
(IUCN) was established. The Union
has now become the world conserva¬
tion organization, its name extended
to include Natural Resources, and its
functions enlarged to environmental
policy, law, and administration.
More recently (1970), the Internation¬
al Council of Scientific Unions (ICSU)
established its Scientific Committee on
Problems of the Environment (SCOPE).
As with IUCN, SCOPE has found that
its primarily scientific mission cannot
be adequately performed without con¬
sidering the human impact upon the
environment.
This impact, however, results not
only from the activities of human indi¬
viduals; it is widely organized and
mediated through governments, cor¬
porations, and international organiza¬
tions. Even to analyze and describe
the interactions of man with the envi¬
ronment requires inputs from social
and behavioural disciplines not fully
represented among the scientific
bodies forming ICSU.
In microcosm this need to integrate

skills in analyzing the environmental
decision process reflects the larger
problem of governments and inter¬
national organizations in coping with
complex environmental questions to
which no single discipline can provide
an adequate answer.
If the Biosphere Conference of 1968
marked the arrival of international poli¬
tical awareness of the world environ¬
ment, the United Nations Conference
on the Human Environment, meeting
in Stockholm in June 1972, provided
confirmation of this awareness.
The Biosphere Conference was
technically an assembly of scientific
experts, whereas the United Nations
Conference was a meeting of political
representatives of governments. Rep¬
resentatives of more than 110 na¬
tions were present at Stockholm and
adopted an Action Plan of 109 recom¬
mendations to national government and
international organizations. The Con¬
ference also adopted a declaration,
and proposed new U.N. machinery to
assist the translation of the work of the
Conference into scientific and political
action.
To facilitate this task the Conference
urged establishment of a World Envi
ronment Fund, made up of the volun¬
tary contributions of national govern¬
ments. Support for the Fund has al¬
ready been pledged by a number of
states, including Canada, the German
Federal Republic, Iran, Japan, Sweden,
the Netherlands, and the United States.
Disposition of the Stockholm recom¬
mendations rests, of course, with the
General Assembly of the U.N., with
national governments, and with the
U.N. Specialized Agencies. Imple¬
mentation of the Action Plan cannot be
accomplished overnight, but there are
good reasons for believing that most
of it will ultimately be put into effect.
Even without official endorsement,
many of the recommendations may
influence and guide the environmental
decisions of governmental and inter¬
national officials.
Support for guarded optimism may
be found in action taken by national
governments to cope with their envi¬
ronmental problems. As late as 1968,
no country was organized politically
or administratively to deal with "envi¬
ronment" as such. Decisions affecting
man-environment interactions were
made pursuant to other considera¬
tions, such as public health, econo¬
mic policy, tourism, national security,
or preservation of a national heritage.
The analogy of the biosphere as the
planetary life-support system achieved
popular comprehension as a conse¬
quence of the voyages into outer space
by Americans and Soviets (the Spa¬
ceship Earth concept); the vision
of the lonely blue planet viewed by
the astronauts and cosmonauts had a
profound psychological impact upon
the peoples of the Earth.
No event in historic time has dra¬
matized more powerfully the unity and
fragility of the biosphere. The symbol
of "only one earth" transcended lan¬
guages and ideologies; its message
readable even by the illiterate. And
while it would be difficult to demons¬
trate that the lunar voyages directly
influenced specific environmental deci¬
sions, they clearly affected the climate
of thought and opinion in which action
was taken by governments and inter¬
national organizations after 1968.
Between 1969 and 1972, nearly
every industrialized nation took legisla¬
tive or administrative action to cope
more effectively with its environmental
problems. A landmark in national
legislation was the signing on January 1 ,
1970 by the President of the United

WORLD POLICY (Continued)
States of the National Environmental
Policy Act of 1969. This far-reaching
law established criteria to guide the
decisions of agencies of the United
States Government that had a signi¬
ficant impact upon the environment.
The Act contains a novel method of
enforcement. For any action by any
federal agency having a significant
environmental impact, a responsible
official must prepare a five-point
statement explaining, and justifying,
the action proposed. These statements
have been made subject to review by
the high-level Council on Environmen¬
tal Quality (also established by the
Act) and are made available to state
governments, to other federal agencies,
and to the concerned public.
In 1970, the United Kingdom provi¬
ded, in a White Paper on Protection
of the Environment, a basis for govern¬
mental reorganization leading to estab¬
lishment of the Department of the
Environment. In 1971, the French
Government established a Ministry for
the Protection of Nature and the Envi¬
ronment. In Sweden, Canada, Japan,
and many other countries, new envi¬
ronmental agencies were created, or
existing departments and ministries
were reorganized.
The world-wide impact of environ¬
mental concepts upon governmental
organization was evident in the reports
submitted by as many as 80 countries
to the Preparatory Committee for the
United Nations Conference on the
Human Environment.
Prior to the U.N. Conference, and
at the plenary sessions at Stockholm,
representatives of national govern¬
ments issued formal declarations re¬
garding the environmental policies of
their nations. A collection of these
statements has been assembled for
publication by the IUCN, and they
indicate a. widespread commitment by
heads of state and high-ranking offi¬
cials to the objectives of environ¬
mental improvement and protection.
A major task in institutionalizing
national decisions on environmental
issues is to find ways to reconcile
ecology and economics. National dev¬
elopment goals and policies, regard¬
ing the applications of science and
technology, have often been formu¬
lated without adequate regard to their
ecological consequences.
In the past, the political and admin¬
istrative structures, through which
decisions were taken, handicapped and
often precluded, co-ordination and re¬
conciliation of environmental and
developmental policies. In pursuit of
development goals serious ecological
errors have been made in many coun¬
tries, leading too often to disappoint¬
ing failures of development and to
waste of scarce resources.
There has been recently published
a 1,060 page volume of case studies
and analyses by 70 internationally-
known scientists examining develop¬
ment projects that were unsuccessful
or that produced destructive side-
effects because of failure to reconcile
technology with ecological realities
and development goals: (The Careless
Technology: Ecology and International
Development. Edited by M.T. Farvar
and J.P. Milton, Natural History Press,
1972).
In nearly all of the more than 50
cases reported, the miscarriage of
development may be explained by in¬
adequacies in the structuring of deci¬
sion-making. At policy formulating
levels there was seldom adequate
means for obtaining a full input of
relevant scientific data, for identifying
alternate means to development goals,
or for testing the probable outcomes
of these alternatives.
Moreover, institutional machinery for
project execution seldom was provided
with guidelines, check points, and peri¬
odic reassessments of technical pro¬
cedures that could enable projects to
be redirected when self-defeating or
when dysfunctional effects appeared.
It is not always easy to discover
exactly where and how the structure
of decision-making has led to un-
desired results. The actual mechanisms
of decision in governmental and inter¬
national agencies are seldom fully
open to public scrutiny or to beha¬
vioural research. Private corporate de¬
cisions are usually even less amenable
to investigation. And yet the wide¬
spread current tendency of govern¬
ments to reorganize for environmental
management indicates that there is a
recognized desire for structural im¬
provement.
Many of the U.N. Specialized Agen¬
cies have established environmental
offices or co-ordinative arrangements
for environmental affairs; and the
Stockholm Conference (as previously
noted) recommended the establish¬
ment of an environmental office in the
United Nations Secretariat. The Eco¬
nomic and Financial Committee of
the U.N. General Assembly recently

ONE EARTH
Study of the biosphere has led us to take a new
look at the interaction of man with his planet. Right,

I
cannot help wondering
whether we may not be present at
one of those turning points in man's
affairs when the human race begins
to see itself and its concerns from a
new angle of vision and, as a result,
finds new openings for action, for
courage and for hope.
I cannot help wondering whether
today's debates on the human environ¬
ment, in their passion, scale and ori¬
ginality, do not resemble the profound
questionings of the accepted order
which erupt into human history in
times of radical change.
One thinks of the intellectual ferment
which, over two millenia ago, accom¬
panied the end of China's feudal wars
and the establishment of the first
great centralized Han dynasty. In
more recent history men had almost
to stand on their heads to realize
that the sun did not go round the
earth, but the reverse. This "Coperni-
can Revolution" is the archetype of
fundamental change by which men
learn to rethink, totally, their place in
the scheme of things.
Our own epoch is, I believe, such an
age again. We belong to the genera-

tidn that has used radio telescopes
to uncover 100,000 million other
galaxies each with 100,000 million
other suns. We belong to the genera¬
tion that has brought nuclear energy
to earth, made possible by computers
the simulation, acceleration and for¬
ward projection of infinitely complicat¬
ed human activities and provided us
with instantaneous worldwide and
interplanetary visible and audible
communication.
Above all, we are the generation to
see through the eyes of the astronauts
the astonishing "earthrise" of our
small and beautiful planet above the
barren horizons of the moon. Indeed,
we in this generation would be some
kind of psychological monstrosity if
this were not an age of Intense, pas¬
sionate, committed debate and search.
So vast is the scale of change
through which we live that there must
be an equally vast range of competitors
for first place as agents of upheaval.
I wish to suggest three areas in which
the concepts that are being virtually
forced upon us offer a startling break
from past patterns of thought and
accepted wisdom.
The first is the possibility of
making the planet unfit for life.
Hitherto, people have known that they
could do local damage. They could
farm carelessly and lose top soil or
deforest or overgraze or mine out a
mineral. They also contrived to live
through major natural disasters
earthquakes, tornadoes, ice ages. But
nobody thought that the planet itself
could be at risk.
Today our experts know something
new. They know that air, soil and
water form a totally interdependent
worldwide system or biosphere sus¬
taining all life, transmitting all energy
and in spite of its rugged powers of
survival, full or inmensely delicate and
vulnerable mechanisms, leaves, bac¬
teria, plankton, catalysts, levels of
dissolved oxygen, thermal balances
which alone permit the sun's searing
energies to be transmuted and life to
carry on.
Our experts also tell us what we do
not know. Given our suddenly and
vastly increasing numbers, our enor¬
mous rise in the use of energy,
including nuclear energy, and our
fabulous mastery of molecular chem¬
istry, we impinge on the fine balances
and mechanisms of the total system
in ways and with consequences that
we too often are in no position to
judge.
Let me give one example. Our
traditional vision of the oceans is
boundless. It is inconceivable to our
imagination that we should perma¬
nently damage this infinity of water.
But we have no idea of its capacity
to absorb as it ultimately must
virtually all the planet's wastes.
In the last two or three decades,
to give only one instance, a high
percentage of the long-lived chlori¬
nated hydrocarbons including DDT
appear to have been absorbed into
natural "sinks" in the biosphere.
Recent sample-taking suggests an
unexpectedly high dosage appearing
in the oceans.
Does this mean that natural storage
systems are filling up? Will further
effluents reinforce irreversible damage
to marine species known to be suscep¬
tible to such substances as DDT?
Is this part of a deeper risk of
deterioration from a steadily widening
range of chemical wastes? We do
not know.
Rivers and lakes teach us that there
are limits to water's self-cleansing

properties. Ultimately the oceans are
one vast cistern with no outlet. This
image is a safer one, perhaps, than
that of infinite and "moving waters at
their priest-like task of pure ablution
round earth's human shores."
And it underlines the need for world¬
wide monitoring and research to ensure
that over the next forty years of still
continuing growth in people, indus¬
trialization, consumption and inter¬
continental transport we do not, unwit¬
tingly, take the oceans themselves
past some still unmeasured threshold
of "no-return".
This concept of newly understood
limits is relevant to the second
reversal of earlier concepts whose
implications I would judge to be most
revolutionary for the present age. For
over a century now and with Increasing
enthusiasm in the last 25 years, we
have seen in economic growth, mea¬
sured by the satisfaction of both
ordinary and induced material needs,
a prime aim of national policy and
a powerful solvent of social conflict.
Inside the nation, as output and
incomes rise, the flow of goods will
be great enough to reward effort and
enterprise and provide on an upward
scale for the needs of the mass of
the people. In the world economy,
international trade and investment will
pull the developing peoples up in the
wake of the already developed nations.
This is a sort of "follow-my-leader"
concept of economic satisfactions
according to which, over the next fifty
years, per capita incomes all round
the world rise to meet, say, America's
present annual average of $4,000 or,
to use a concrete measurement, a
million calories and thirteen tons of
coal equivalent in energy. At the
same time developed standards would
rise to perhaps $10,000 or $15,000 per
capita with a two-home, three-car,
four-TV-set norm in the upper income
brackets.
But this implicit assumption of
unending expansion has two self-
reinforcing flaws. Even within the
wealthiest states, even with all the
transfers of resources from richer to
poorer citizens secured by tax and
welfare and social insurance, "trickle
down" economics do not ensure the
ending of poverty at the base of
society. The lowest twenty per cent
can have as little as five per cent of
national income, the top twenty per
cent as much as forty.
In the world at large, where no
systematic social transfers occur, the
richer states are pulling away from
the less developed ones. Even if
$10,000 a year per capita is a rea
sonable likelihood for developed
societies by the year 2000, for two
thirds of mankind, $400 a year looks
like being the utmost reach of
optimism. For perhaps a third, mal¬
nutrition, illiteracy, shanty-town dwel¬
ling and unemployment In other
words, the worst of all human environ¬
ments could be the most likely fate.
But now we must add another
constraint. Even if we assume unlimit¬
ed resources with which to develop,
development is, as we have seen,
grossly uneven. But suppose there
are indeed strict physical "limits to
growth"? Suppose that these delicate
mechanisms and balances in the
biosphere that make life possible
cannot sustain 10,000 million people
all aiming to produce and consume and
discard and pollute according to pre¬
sent developed standards?
Here, admittedly, the range of debate
is very wide. Some experts believe
that 20,000 million people can live at
America's present standards simply on
the products of atomic energy, water
and the minerals in common rock.
Others postulate irretrievable damage
in terms of exhausted resources, ther- rt
mal pollution, and environmental dis- H
ruption if even half that number secure
the current standards of the rich. We
are at the beginning of this debate.

ONLY ONE EARTH (Continued)

But one point is surely clear. There
are limits. The biosphere is not infin¬
ite. Populations must become stable.
So must the demands they make.
But in that case, whose upward
aspirations must first be checked?
Given finite resources, we cannot
evade this basic social issue. Where
are the restraints to be put? What
is to be reduced, the luxuries of the
rich or the necessities of the poor?
What are the priorities a decent hu¬
man environment for the whole human
species or riches for some and squalor
for the majority?
We can slide over this fundamental
issue of environmental quality only if
"trickle down" economics work within
a context of unlimited resources.
Neither assumption is correct. So, as
nations, as a planet, we are compel¬
led to confront the fundamental Issues
of choice and justice.
But at this point we encounter
a third basic challenge to our habits
of thinking. Our effective instruments of
judgment, decision and action are
separate governments. The nations
give our planet its colour, its variety,
its richness of life and experience.
For those to whom full nationhood has
come only in the last quarter of a cen¬
tury, it expresses the essence of their
being and their hopes.
None of this can be doubted. Yet
it is also true that the cumulative effect
of the separate actions of separate
sovereign governments can, over time,
injure the basic national needs of all
of them.
If our airs and oceans can stand
only so much strain before they lose
their capacity for self-purification, it
will help no government to say that
others were responsible. The most
flagrant case is clearly the risk of
nuclear conflict and planetary nuclear
pollution. We may rejoice that a num¬
ber of intergovernmental agreements
now limit atomic testing in the air, keep
nuclear weapons from the seabed,
Outer Space and Antarctica.
But we could collectively pollute the
planet not "with a bang but a whim¬
per" by the small, steady accumu¬
lation of long-lasting poisons and pes¬
ticides, of chemicals and tailings, of
eroded soil and detritus and reach,
almost inadvertently, a creeping plan¬
etary disaster to which all have separ¬
ately made their cumulative contri¬
bution. No single nation can avert
this risk as numbers and activities rise.
Its control will be achieved by nations
acting together or not at all.
And this raises by another route
the issue of planetary justice which
equally cannot be solved by nations
acting alone. How do we ensure that
the need to check pollution does not
become an inhibition on the desperate
need of two thirds of humanity for
development? This is an area about
which we do not know too much.
It is certainly not clear that all non-
pollutive technologies are more expen¬
sive. It is also possible that in opting
straight away for pollution control,
developing states could take full
advantage of the greatest asset of late
comers to learn from other people's
mistakes. Equally it is possible that
to control wastes and effluents at an
early stage of modernization would
greatly add to costs and strains.
Should poorer countries then accept
added costs for development or even
their own modernization because dev¬
eloped nations have already, as it
were, pre-empted so much of the
biosphere's costless capacities for
self-cleansing?
We do not know the answers. But
we do know that nations, acting indi¬
vidually, will not necessarily produce
a workable planetary answer. The
relentless pursuit of separate national
interest by rich and poor alike can, in
a totally interdependent biosphere,
produce global disasters of irreversible
environmental damage.
HERE are then, I suggest,
three vital ways in which the reality
we are beginning to perceive diverges
from our habitual thinking.
We normally consider Nature as a
whole, the entire biosphere, to be safe
from man, even if we can chip away at
little bits of it. We have been taught
to believe, with increasing intensity in
recent decades, that we can moder¬
nize all our economies and settle most
issues of distribution by our unlimited
command of rising energy, technology
and resources. And by our millenial
history we have been taught to expect
final decisions to be taken by separ¬
ate sovereign states.
It requires a desperate wrench from
accepted thinking, a profound leap, a
Copernican leap of the imagination,
to begin to see that in stark physical
and scientific reality none of these
pre-suppositions are any longer true.
We can damage the entire biosphere.
Resources are not unlimited. States
acting separately can produce plan¬
etary disaster.
We all know enough of history to
realize how uncertain it is whether this
change in the direction of our thinking
will be made in time. Custom and
habit hold us to the traditional themes.
The sheer momentum of our present
activities could well be enough to drive
us on for another four or five decades
on our present path.
We could increase the damaging
impact upon our biosphere, accentuate
the deepening gulf between wealth
and opportunity for an elite of dev¬
eloped states and a squalid and det¬
eriorating human environment for
everyone else. We could arrive at
no intergovernmental agreements or
strategies to check either kind of
profound environmental degradation.
This is a possible "scenario".
Realists might even call it the most
likely one. But I would like to give
you three reasons why I feel it is
legitimate to entertain shall we say,
a modest hope?
The first is that the Stockholm
Conference was held at all. Once the
environmental concern moves nearer
to the centre of the nations' attention,
I do not doubt that its fuller implica¬
tions will inevitably unfold. For its
whole essence is interconnexion and
interdependence. Its whole message
is that separate drives, ambitions and
policies have to be made compatible
with the continuing common life of our
single, shared planetary system.
My second reason is precisely this
scientific imperative. We can cheat
on morals. We can cheat on politics.
We can deceive ourselves with dreams
and myths. But there is no mon¬
keying about with DNA or photosyn¬
thesis or eutrophication or nuclear fu¬
sion or the impact on all living things
of excessive radiation from the sun
or the hydrogen bomb.
And what our incredible scientific
breakthroughs of the last century
have taught us is that the ultimate
energy of the universe both sustains
or destroys life and that the mecha¬
nisms and balances by which it be¬
comes life-enhancing are fragile and
precious beyond our belief.
To act without rapacity, to use
knowledge with wisdom, to respect
interdependence, to operate without
hubris and greed are not simply
moral imperatives. They are an
accurate scientific description of the
means of survival. It is this compel¬
ling force of fact that may, I think,
control our separatist ambitions before
they overturn our planetary life.
But man does not live by fact alone.
Our human environment has within
it our perpetual striving to make it
humane as well. In the past, histor¬
ians tell us, there have been profound
revulsions against the aggression,
pride and rapacity of human systems.
The great ethical systems of man¬
kind in India, in China, in the, Middle
East, from the benign wisdom of
Confucius to the passionate social
protest of the Hebrew prophets all
sought to express an underlying moral
reality, that we live by moderation, by
compassion, by justice, that we die by
aggression, by pride, by rapacity and
greed.
Now in these latter days, the planet
itself in its underlying physical reality
repeats the witness of the sages and
the prophets. Our collective greeds
can degrade and destroy our basic
sources of life in air and soil and
water. Our collective injustice can
continue to create an intolerable imbal¬
ance between rich and poor. Envy
and fear can unleash the nuclear holo¬
caust. At last, in this age of ultimate
scientific discovery, our facts and our
morals have come together to tell us
how we must live. I for one believe
profoundly that they have done so just
in time.

In April 1968, some 30 personalities from the worlds of
industry, science, economics, sociology, government, etc.
gathered in Rome at the Accademia dei Lincei, one of the
world's oldest academies of science, for an Informal dis¬
cussion on the present and future predicament of man. It
was from this meeting, instigated by Italian economist and
industrialist Aurelio Peccei and the Organization for Eco¬
nomic Co-operation and Development's Scottish Director-
General for Scientific Affairs, Dr. Alexander King, that the
Club of Rome was born.
Peccei has described the Club as an " invisible college ";
it has some seventy members from widely varied back¬
grounds who share a common conviction that it is urgent
to redress the world situation. The Club aims to acquire
and spread real understanding of the critical state of hu¬
man affairs and the uncertain prospects for the future and
to propose new policy guidelines for the intelligent
management of human affairs.
As a first step the Club commissioned a team of scien¬
tists at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology, under
THE LIMITS
TO GROWTH
Interview with
the President
of the Club of Rome
Aurelio Peccei
the direction of Professor Dennis Meadows, to study the
probable dynamics of the world situation with particular
attention to the problems of making a deliberate transition
from world-wide growth to global dynamic equilibrium.
Adopting the " systems dynamics " techniques originated
by Professor Jay Forrester, Professor Meadows and his
team produced a computer model of the complex, interlink¬
ed forces that affect man and his environment into which
they introduced a number of variables that affect growth.
They then proceeded to make projections of man's chances
of survival in the future. Their ultimate conclusion was
that all projections based on growth end in collapse.
This study, the first of a series commissioned by the
Club of Rome, was published last year in the form of the
now world famous book " The Limits to Growth". The
book has aroused enormous controversy (see for instance
pages 12, 14). In the interview accorded to Unesco recently,
extracts of which we publish below, Mr. Aurelio Peccei,
President of the Club of Rome, comments on some of the
criticisms with which it has been greeted.
QUESTION : What method did the
Club of Rome use for
such a complex, global
study ?
Aurelio PECCEI : We based our study
on five crucial trends of world concern
which, as a starting point, can be said
to represent the dynamics, complexi¬
ties and dangers inherent in the pre¬
sent world system. The first trend is
population growth. The second and
third are the parallel economic factors
of industrial and agricultural growth,
in other words, the ability to meet the
needs of the growing world population.
The fourth factor is pollution, the con
tamination of the environment with
unwanted by-products of industry and
agriculture. The fifth is the use we
make of our natural resources, the
inherited world resources we deplete,
all too heedless of the fact that we are
living on the capital, not the income.
Q. : Your model comprises
five highly complex varia¬
bles. Did you take into
account the variables
within these variables ?
A. P. : The five variables we chose are
interlinked and interact on each other.
After trying to take into account all the
data that could have a bearing on the
interactions, we drew up over a
hundred equations whose various cur¬
ves represent these interrelationships.
We fed them into a computer model
designed to accept as many world
variables as our knowledge or res¬
earch could identify.
Q. : What global conclusions
has the model helped you
to reach ?
A. P. : The model is largely indicative
in character. Within two to five years
we hope to arrive at much firmer
conclusions. But the conclusions we

THE LIMITS TO GROWTH (Continued)
can draw already are alarming enough.
If present trends continue, exponential
growth of production, consumption,
pollution and depletion of raw mater¬
ials will lead to a completely imposs¬
ible situation: overpopulation of the
planet, impoverishment of our environ¬
ment with our atmosphere and water
supplies polluted.
Q. : An optimistic viewpoint
suggests that this alarm¬
ist attitude is exagge¬
rated.
A. P. : Our model is purely descriptive
of a situation as it exists today and of
the possible outcome if present trends
continue; the project was not intended
as a piece of futurology. The opti¬
mists say that the road ahead may
seem dangerous but that human in¬
genuity, science and tecnology will be
capable of solving many of the prob¬
lems we now face. To my mind, the
optimists fail to consider two funda¬
mental factors. The first is the accel¬
erating pace of history; our institu¬
tions and our ability to react to prob¬
lems are not fast enough for us to
master these problems in time.
Events move more rapidly than we do.
But the second factor is even more
fundamental; critical world problems
exist for which there are no technical
solutions. These are problems of
reaction, adaptation and values. Solu¬
tions for these problems will have
to be sought in the context of social
and cultural development. Thus, ra¬
ther than increase the rôle of techno¬
logy in the world, we should, perhaps,
attempt to humanize it. This means
that we must seek quite different solu¬
tions.
Q. : It is claimed that your
model corresponds to the
situation in industrially
developed countries but
not to that of the Third
World, since it does not
include social or political
factors.
A. P. : Such criticisms come closer to
the truth. The real need is for a fun¬
damental change in our political and
social standpoints. If present trends
continue we shall be heading for dis¬
aster. Yet we have no new models
of the world. We want people to
realize, now, that something must be
changed in the world. I must stress
that the model merely describes the
present world situation with all its pos¬
sibilities and problems. We wanted
to learn from our model what this old
earth of ours can provide globally and
then consider how to make better use
of it to eliminate inequalities and ten¬
sions.
I do not think it is possible today
to have both a global and a detailed
view of the world; we do not have the
necessary techniques to do this. So
our model must be improved in the
years ahead from only five para¬
meters today to ten tomorrow as
well as in other ways such as a re¬
appraisal of our institutions, etc. since
these represent the needs of an evol¬
ving society.
In a society that will be both fragile
and complex, when world population is
double what it is now, I fear that com¬
puters and other tools that expand the
capacity of the human mind will be a
necessary aid to life. But if man could
regain some essentially human qual¬
ities, if injustice were diminished, if
wiser generations should succeed us,
then perhaps we should have less need
of computers to guide us. In short,
the choice is between a raising of our
ethical standards or an ant-heap exis¬
tence. As men, I trust, our destiny
is not to be mere ants with no higher
aspirations than feeding ourselves and
achieving material well-being.

HE recently published Re¬
port for the Club of Rome, The Limits
to Growth, will probably have the use¬
ful effect of popularizing the ecolo-
gists' broad warnings of the necessity
of giving up our expectations of conti¬
nuing on the road of unrestrained
growth. But to the serious student
the report has grave defects in its
very approach to the problems of both
present trends and the possibilities
and means of altering these trends.
To begin with, the report uncritically
accepts the concept Gross National
Product without any queries. Also for
the rest, it builds upon, and aggregates
in the most careless way, data that
are extremely uncertain both in regard
to economic growth itself and its
various components.
The data concerning threatening pol¬
lution and depletion are equally un¬
reliable. Even a popular presentation
should contain a reminder of this, par¬
ticularly as it is of importance for the
use of these data in a system analysis.

The authors are, in other words, over¬
selling their product in regard to the
validity of the basic data.
Much more fundamental is the ques¬
tion of the realism of the report's
global "world system analysis". This
analysis implies, to begin with, a non-
consideration of the enormous and
increasing differences and inequalities
within countries and still more between
countries.
To explain this, the report states
that "inequalities of distribution are
defined as social problems" and then
placed outside "the world simulation
model", which only "calculates the
maximum possible behaviour of our
world system" provided that there is
"intelligent action on world problems,
from a world-wide perspective".
An economist working on these very
problems will be hard put to give any
intelligible meaning to this assump¬
tion of perfect harmony in the world.
Still less will he be able to outline
how it could be brought about. Par
ticularly in a pretended system analy¬
sis it is simply not possible to get
away from "the social problems" mere¬
ly by stating that they are not taken
into account. The ecosystem has to
be studied as part of the social system
I have mentioned.
More specifically the report places
outside the "interactions" within the
"world model" attitudes and institu¬
tions, indeed even the process of price
formation, while politics is only repre¬
sented by stating a number of the
results of abstract policy alternatives.
Their system is, therefore, far from
inclusive enough to have meaning.
The birth rate, for exemple, is quite
rightly a factor, and a very important
one, within their model. But it is cer¬
tainly not a function only of the other
factors within that model and the inter¬
relations between them all. As we
who have studied the demographic
development in the several regions of
the world know, the movements of
these other factors are not even
among the most important determinants
of the birth rate. And the importance
of them is not through the simple
interrelations of the model. Indeed,
those interrelations are fictitious.
Under these circumstances the use
of mathematical equations and a huge
computer, which registers the alterna¬
tives of abstractly conceived policies
by a "world simulation model", may
impress the innocent general public
but has little, if any, scientific validity.
That this "sort of model is actually a
new tool for mankind" is unfortunately
not true. It represents quasi-learned-
ness of a type that we have, for a long
time, had too much of, not least in eco¬
nomics, when we try to deal with
problems simply in "economic terms".
In the end, those conclusions from
the report's analysis which are sen¬
sible at all, are not different and defi¬
nitely not more certain than could
have been reached without that elab¬
orate apparatus by what Alfred Mar¬
shall called "hard simple thinking
aware of the limitations of what we
know."

Young scientists' round table at Unesco
ENVIRONMENT
AND POLITICAL
COMMITMENT
i,
14
IN the midst of the current
debate on the environmental crisis,
young scientists have made their
voices heard on a number of impor¬
tant issues.
Over the past 18 months, Unesco
has participated in several internatio¬
nal meetings with young natural and
social scientists: at Enschede (Nether¬
lands) in July 1971, at a meeting
organized by the World Federation of
Scientific Workers on the theme
"Young Scientists and Contemporary
Society", and at Hamilton (Canada) in
August 1971, at the International Youth
Conference on the Human Environ¬
ment.
More recently, on the eve of the
1972 United Nations Conference on
the Human Environment in Stockholm,
Unesco brought together a small
group of young scientists from indus
trialized and developing countries, to
discuss two recent models of the
global future and the solutions which
they suggest.
The two models were the Massa¬
chusetts Institute of Technology-Club
of Rome study, "The Limits to
Growth", and the United Nations
World Plan of Action for the Appli¬
cation of Science and Technology to
Development. In the event, the young
scientists, meeting at Unesco's h.Q.
in Paris, focused most attention on
the first of these studies.
The Club of Rome initiative in mak¬
ing the study was generally welcomed.
Doubts were expressed, however, on
two quite separate issues: the meth¬
ods used to construct the computer
model; and the model's political impli¬
cations, particularly in view of the
"a-political" stance claimed by those
who produced it.
The young scientists questioned the
validity of the model on several
counts, but directed most of their cri¬
ticisms at its political aspects. For
most participants, the selection of five
basic parameters, of a purely techni¬
cal nature, meant that the model was
not one which applied to the real
world situation.
Why, they asked, were war, the
arms trade, colonialism and imperia¬
lism rejected as specific factors that
might, and indeed already were,
causing breakdowns? Why was the
unequal distribution of resources, bet¬
ween nations and within them, not
included in the analysis?
There. was considerable agreement
that all the model's assumptions were
conditional on an unaltered status
quo in world affairs; that it was a
"conflict-free" model of a world which,
in reality, is torn by conflict.

The model was also considered
to have some dangerous effects.
One participant described it as a
"recipe for stagnation" which would
do, and had already done, far more
to obscure ideas than the piecemeal
approach of the world's politicians
which the Club of Rome had sought
to avoid.
As the young scientists saw it, one
basic assumption behind the Club of
Rome model is that world population
growth is the essential cause of the
future breakdowns in society that the
model predicts. All the participants
agreed that population growth is nei¬
ther the only nor the main cause of
the environmental crisis. Other fac¬
tors involved are economic growth,
the type of technology used, particu¬
larly in developed countries, the
nature of existing political and eco¬
nomic systems, the high level of
consumption in the developed world,
etc., etc.
They saw high rates of population
growth as a symptom, and not a
cause, of underdevelopment which
results from political exploitation of
the developing countries by the dev¬
eloped.
Nearly all participants agreed that
the problems of development, of
family planning, of the relationship
between rich and the poor countries
and the problems of the environment,
cannot be analysed as separate
issues. The interdependence of these
factors means that the "environmental
crisis", as the industrialized countries
term it, is in reality a multiple crisis
or a series of convergent crises.
Young scientists from Third World
countries, in particular, pointed out
that a planetary disequilibrium had
always existed to the detriment of the
poor countries, broadly those in the
southern hemisphere.
Problems of the environment and
development were debated primarily
in their political context and only
secondarily, or not at all, in their
scientific context. This reflects the
increasingly prevalent view among
young scientists today that science
should be politically and morally
committed; that the value of science
is measured by the extent of its ethical
commitment; and that the rôle of
science should be seen as part of the
political context.
They also stressed the importance
of restoring public confidence in
science. The man in the street should
have a clearer understanding of the
ideas underlying science.
But they warned against the dan¬
gers of technological domination. In
many cases it would be better to
improve traditional practices rather
than introduce totally new forms of
technology. The right attitude would
be neither an unquestioning venera¬
tion of technological progress nor a
blind subservience to tradition.
The young scientists outlined a
major research programme which
would for the first time investigate
traditional labour technologies on a
decentralized basis. The aim should
be to put local resources and skills
to maximum use and to make scien¬
tists out of laymen rather than huma¬
nitarians out of scientists. A great
demand exists in developing and
industrially developed countries for
new technologies which are not harm¬
ful to the environment.
Finally, general agreement was
reached on a number of basic prin¬
ciples: that science can never be a
substitute for political debate, that
men must once again be counted as
men and not as statistics, that an
obsession with quantity must give
way to considerations of quality, and
that global analyses must be replac¬
ed by regional and local solutions
which will reintegrate man fully with
nature and with the technologies he
has created.

Mediterranean:
DANGER!
OIL POLLUTION
LS a result of their proxi¬
mity to some of the world's richest
oilfields, the waters of the Mediterra¬
nean are used by a vast fleet of oil
tankers.
Forecasts point to a staggering
growth in these oil shipments during
the next few years. In 1975, 360 mil¬
lion tons out of a world total of 1,650
million tons of crude oil carried by sea
will be discharged at Mediterranean
ports.
When the Suez canal is re-opened
and the existing pipelines in the canal
zone conveying crude oil from the Red
Sea to the Mediterranean are brought
back into use, some of the traffic now
going round the Cape of Good Hope
could well return to the Mediterranean
routes.
But how is it that oil loaded on
tankers for delivery to refineries
finishes up in the sea?
Oil pollution in the sea is generally
associated with an accident of some
kind, one which arouses public opinion
and draws attention to the high cost
of cleaning up vast areas of water after
an accident at sea.
In reality, the major problem of oil
pollution in the sea is only partly due
to accidents; operational pollution,
bound up with the normal sea trans¬
port of oil and with loading and dis¬
charging operations at the terminals,
is far more important. This is a more
general source of pollution, less in the
limelight than tanker accidents but far
more insidious.
The fact is that less than 99 per cent
of the oil taken on board a tanker is
discharged at the port of destination.
Part of the remaining one per cent is
lost by evaporation of the most volatile
16
CARLO MUNNS, Italian expert on legal and
technical matters concerning protection of
the environment, is working with the Parlia¬
mentary Committee on the study of water
problems in Italy and Is collaborating In the
drawing up of the first "Report on the State
of the Environment In Italy" at present
under preparation by the Italian Ministry of
Scientific and Technological Research. He

environmental questions for the Food and
Agriculture Organization and the United Na¬
tions In Rome.
elements in the oil and the rest settles
on the walls and bottom of the tanks
in the ship in the form of sediment.
These far from negligible quantities
of oily substances represent a danger
for the ship itself since they give off
gases which may form an explosive
mixture with the air in the now empty
tanks. It is thus indispensable to rinse
out the tanks with water.
When a tanker has discharged its
crude oil load and leaves again to pick
up another shipment the washing of
the tanks coincides with the need to
take on sea water as ballast. Empty
tankers are unstable and difficult to
manoeuvre and therefore have to take
on amounts of water varying from 40
to 60 per cent of their capacity.
This ballast, which forms an emul¬
sion with the oily residue, has to be
pumped out before a fresh cargo of
crude oil can be taken on, so that
large quantities of this residue find
their way into the sea. The amount,
according to the oil companies, is some
0.4 to 0.5 per cent of the oil carried,
and it is one of the main causes of
pollution.
Authorities in the oil-exporting coun¬
tries do not tolerate the discharge of
dirty ballast and tank-rinsing water
near their coasts or in their ports,
and place strict controls on the quality
of water discharged. So tanker cap¬
tains make a practice of discharging
dirty ballast water on their way from
port to port and of replacing it with
clean water.
Although less toxic for the environ¬
ment than radio-active substances,
non-biodegradable detergents and
plastics, crude oil creates an alarming
problem because of the enormous
volume transported and the high
concentration in one area the Medi¬
terranean.
The natural environment in the area
is obviously threatened by other fac¬
tors: the increasing concentrations of
population and of industry along the
coastline, the development of the tour¬
ist trade, and the growth in consump¬
tion and in waste and refuse which,

in one way or another, eventually
finishes up in the sea. But in terms
of urgency oil pollution is the most
crucial issue.
According to estimates, 300,000 tons
of oil residue were discharged into the
Mediterranean in 1970, and this figure
will probably climb to 500,000 tons in
1975 and 650,000 tons in 1980.
But the Mediterranean presents
some special problems. It is a shal¬
low sea (only 3,500 metres deep at its
central part), and its rising currents
are not strong enough to assist in
water exchange and oxygenation by
contact with the air. Water tempera¬
tures at the bottom are more or less
constant because of the protective
effect of the Gibraltar threshold, and
there are no currents moving faster
than 2-3 knots.
The masses of water in the Medi¬
terranean down to the first 150 metres
thus take an extremely long time to
mix and regenerate, a fair estimate
being about 80 years.
Serious harm to the marine environ¬
ment is therefore caused in a number
of ways:
The oil slick on the water pre¬
vents water oxygenation and instead
consumes oxygen itself for its own
degradation.
Oil pollution is a serious obstacle
to the photosynthesis on which de¬
pends the life and growth of the
minute phytoplankton the food of
the Zooplankton on which, in their turn,
the larger sea creatures feed.
Absorbed by fish, the pollutants
eventually reach and endanger human
life.
Every year, according to figures of
the FAO General Fisheries Council
for the Mediterranean, about one mil¬
lion metric tons of fish are caught in
waters of this sea, and the protein
requirement of the Mediterranean
population increases yearly. Recent
FAO reports indicate that some fish
species are already decreasing.
The various governments, concerned
at the worsening pollution situation,
took steps to ban the discharge of
tank-rinsing water within their terri¬
torial waters, with the inevitable result
that the pollution has shifted to the
high seas. In a closed sea like the
Mediterranean this in turn causes pol¬
lution of coastal waters. The problem
therefore called for a solution at inter¬
national level.
The 1954 London Convention for the
Prevention of the Pollution of the Sea
by Oil prohibited all tankers from
discharging oily mixtures containing
more than 100 mg of oil per litre
within 50 miles of land. In 1962,
the 1954 Convention was amend
ed, within the framework of the Inter¬
governmental Maritime Consultative
Organization (IMCO). The ban now
became absolute for all ships of over
20,000 tons and the protected areas
were extended (from 50 to 100 miles
in the case of the Mediterranean).
The result was that in the Mediter¬
ranean two zones were left, one bet¬
ween Libya and Sicily and the other
south of the island of Rhodes, in which
ships were free to discharge as much
tank rinsing water as they wished.
But in the absence of any effective
monitoring system the discharge areas
are expanding unchecked.
As an alternative to the rules laid
down in the 1962 IMCO Convention,
shipping lines and oil companies sug¬
gested a new way of rinsing out tanks
chiefly responsible for the pollution
of the Mediterranean Sea and coast.
Other techniques have been put
forward to save oil from being dis¬
charged into the sea, but technically
and economically they are difficult to
implement in the case of the existing
tanker fleet.
As long ago as 1954, IMCO affirmed
that the only effective way of solving
the oil pollution problem in the Medi¬
terranean was to install plants for
treating tanker ballast and rinsing
water at all oil loading terminals. But
because of the cost of building such
plants the governments of the pro¬
ducer countries and the oil companies
operating the terminals have not so far,
with some rare exceptions, complied
with the recommendation.

known as the "Load on top" system.
This process consists of separating
the sea water from the oil residue
during the return voyage. The water
is cleaner when discharged into the
sea and the oil residue from all the
tanks is collected into one tank only.
This concentrated oil-water mixture
is processed on board ship after the
fresh cargo of crude oil has been
pumped into the tanks, and is dis¬
charged separately when the tanker
arrives at the refinery port with its
new load.
In order for the process of separa¬
tion by gravity to take place between
water and oily substances a minimum
of about 40 hours is needed, provided
that the weather is calm. Unfortu¬
nately because of the short voyage
time between crude oil embarkation
ports in North Africa and the Near
East and the user countries in south¬
ern Europe, tankers on these routes
cannot effectively use the "Load on
top" system. They have thus become
However, a recent study made for
IMCO puts the cost of providing such
new plants where they are needed and
of improving existing ones at about
80 million dollars. Running costs
would be about 70 cents per ton of oil
shipped.
If these plants were built and oper¬
ated, oil pollution in the Mediterranean
could be reduced to negligible propor¬
tions within a space of three or four
years. A solution is urgently needed,
and many international research orga¬
nizations now investigating the oil pol¬
lution question have made special
studies of the problem in the Medi¬
terranean.

for the Mediterranean has set up a

'It seems to me quite absurd", writes Josué de Castro,
"to propose a zero economic growth rate for the Third
World when the peoples of these areas consider economic
development to be their last hope of emerging from their
crushing burden of poverty."
POLLUTION PROBLEM N° 1
UNDERDEVELOPMENT
by Josué de Castro
W
20
HY should the so-called
"underdeveloped" countries be con¬
cerned with problems of the environ¬
ment? At first sight, these problems
seem much more serious and more
complex in the "highly-developed"
countries, where intensive industriali¬
zation and urban growth damage or
upset the balance of the natural envi¬
ronment. Pollution would thus seem
to be almost exclusively a problem
for the highly industrialized countries
and to be of little interest to the poor
ones, which supply the world's raw
materials.
This analysis is quite wrong. It
results from the vagueness of certain
basic concepts, particularly the current
concepts of "environment" and "dev¬
elopment".
JOSUE DE CASTRO, of Brazil, is famous for
his efforts in the world struggle against
hunger. He Is the author of "The Geography
of Hunger", 1952 (translated into 24 langua¬
ges) and "Of Men and Crabs", 1970 (see also
page 33). President of the World Association
for the Struggle Against Hunger and former
Chairman of the Council of FAO, he was
Brazilian Ambassador to the U.N. in Geneva,
from 1961 to 1964. Professor of Human Geo¬
graphy at the University of Brazil (Rio de
Janeiro) since 1939, he is at present Asso¬
ciate Professor of Geography at the Univer¬
sity of Paris (Vincennes) and President of
the International Centre for Development, in
Paris. He took part in the Environment
Forum held concurrently with the 1972 U.N.
Environment Conference In Stockholm, where
he spoke on "Problems of Development and
Environment in the Third World".
The environment is not only the
sum of all the material things that
make up the mosaic of the country¬
side or landscape, and constantly
interact with each other. It is much
more than this. It also includes the
economic structures and the outlook
and habits of peoples in different
parts of the world.
The environment as a whole there¬
fore includes not only physical or
material factors but economic and
cultural ones as well.
An accurate analysis of the environ¬
ment must always consider the total
impact of man and his culture on all
the surrounding elements, and also
the impact of ecological factors on
every aspect of human life. Viewed
in this perspective the environment
includes biological, physiological, eco¬
nomic and cultural aspects, all linked
in the same constantly changing eco¬
logical fabric.
This concept is much wider and
more objective than that of the
environment considered merely as a
system of mutual relations between
living creatures and their natural envi¬
ronment.
The concept of "development" as
measured only by statistics and
increased material wealth by econo¬
mic growth is just as false. Dev¬
elopment also involves far-reaching
and successive social changes which
inevitably accompany the techno
logical transformation of the natural
environment.
The concept of development is not
only a quantitative one, measurable
in dollars, but also one that includes
qualitative aspects of the communities
concerned, in other words their qual¬
ity of life.
To grow is one thing; to develop
another. To grow is, generally speak¬
ing, relatively easy. To develop in a
balanced way is much more difficult.
So difficult, that no country has yet
managed to achieve it. From this
point of view, the whole world is
more or less underdeveloped.
Yet it is the fashion today to speak
of the harmful effects of economic
growth on the environment and on
nature in general. And people talk
above all of the effects that are not
the most threatening ones for the
future of mankind. The most frequent
cries of alarm condemn the population
explosion, the pollution of air, rivers
and seas, the degradation of animal
and plant resources in the most highly-
developed regions of the world.
This attitude reflects a limited view
of the problem that takes into account
only the direct effects of economic
expansion, overlooking the insidious,
indirect yet much more determinant
action of development on all human
societies.

POLLUTION PROBLEM No. 1 (Continued)
The danger of ecological disintegration
false conclusion arising from this par¬
tial view of the problem, is the idea
that it is the richest areas that were
first affected by the pollution and
destruction of the natural environment
caused by economic growth.
The reality is quite different. The
earliest and gravest effects of dev¬
elopment were to be found precisely in
the regions which are today economi¬
cally underdeveloped and which were
yesterday under colonial rule. Under¬
development in these regions was the
first result of the unbalanced dev¬
elopment of the world as a whole.
Underdevelopment itself represents
a type of pollution and human degra¬
dation localized in certain regions
unjustly exploited by the great indus¬
trial powers.
u

' NDERDEVELOPMENT is
not, as is often supposed, the lack or
absence of development. It is a
product or by-product of development,
an inevitable result of the colonial
system of economic exploitation that
is still in force in several parts of the
world.
Many people are convinced that the
whole question of environmental
problems in developing countries is
totally different from that in the rich
industrialized countries, and should be
viewed in quite a different way. In
the poorer countries, they say, people
do not concern themselves with the
quality of life, but only with the
chances of survival, with the struggle
against hunger, disease and igno¬
rance.
But these things are none other
than the symptoms of a serious
social malady underdevelopment
which is itself a product of develop¬
ment. The underdeveloped countries
which are struggling to survive need
to take a direct interest in world-wide
development and environmental prob¬
lems so as to defend themselves
against the aggressions their own
environment has undergone for cen¬
turies on the part of the colonial
powers.
If it is only recently that people
have come to talk so insistently about
the pollution and degradation caused
by economic growth, this is because
Western civilization, with its scien¬
tific and ethnocentric approach, has
always refused to see what is
obvious: that the hunger and poverty
of certain far-off regions form part
of the social price mankind pays so
that economic development may ad¬
vance in a few economically and
politically dominant regions.
The blurring of this basic truth led
to the institution on a global scale
of a development strategy which
inevitably resulted in the failure of
the 1960-1970 Development Decade.
This will happen again and again so
long as the economic structures of
the world continue to depend on the
false foundations of its social struc¬
ture: a war economy, a maximum
profit economy, and a policy of eco¬
nomic oppression of the Third World.
To succeed in their struggle for
emancipation and survival, the under¬
developed countries must obtain at
all costs a marked reduction of the
negative economic impact the market
economy has had on their systems
of economic dependence. These coun¬
tries will have to fight hard against
the indirect action of the great cen¬
tres of accumulated capital, which
perpetuate the underdevelopment of
the world's economic fringe by every
available means, including the refusal
to stabilize the cost of raw materials.
To eliminate any doubt that in a
consumer civilization underdevelop¬
ment is a product of development, it
is enough to remember that before
the capitalistic and industrial explo¬
sion of our century, there were no
developed and underdeveloped coun¬
tries separated by a wide economic
gap. It was only after the second
industrial revolution that the extreme
disparities of growth rates and econo¬
mic levels between the two groups
of countries came into existence.
Let us take a concrete example:
the average income per inhabitant of
countries representative of the two
groups the U.S.A. and India. Before
the first World War, the average
income per head in India was 8 times
less than that of the U.S.A.; before
the second World War it was 15 times
less; today it is 50 times less...
The economic degradation of the
underdeveloped countries must be
considered as .a pollution of their
human environment by the economic
abuses of the dominant areas of
the world economy. Hunger, poverty,
widespread disease that would be
avoidable with a minimum of hygiene,
a short average life-expectancy: all
these are products of the destructive
effect of world exploitation under a
system of economic domination.
Starvation in India, Peru, San Do¬
mingo or the North-East of Brazil may
look like a local symptom of under¬
development, but in reality it repre¬
sents a paradoxical aspect of the
diseases of civilization. Hunger is
an indirect result of unbalanced eco¬
nomic growth, just as cardio-vascular
and degenerative diseases are else¬
where.
Ultimately, the two groups of mala¬
dies the so-called diseases of civi
lization and the diseases of poverty
are products of the same despotic
and frenzied civilization of profit. The
first ones are produced directly, on
the spot; the others indirectly, at a
distance.
A development strategy that envi¬
saged the social reality of the Third
World as something apart from the
rest of the world doomed from the
start any hope of improving environ¬
mental conditions. In reality, the whole
biosphere is a single ecosystem com¬
posed of a multitude of sub-systems.
The ecosystem of the biosphere is
given an enormous structural elasti¬
city by mechanisms which compensate
and counterbalance the negative
impact of man's actions. This elasti¬
city gives an important advantage
to man, since it allows him to
transform the biosphere and use its
elements to satisfy his own needs.
But the process cannot continue
beyond certain limits fixed by the
laws of natural balances (nuisance
thresholds) without causing serious
breakdowns, which may be fatal for
the ecosystems.
HROUGH the play of
ecological interactions, the serious
imbalances to which the Third World
has been condemned threaten the
whole biosphere and with it all
mankind. Starvation in the Third World
could one day lead to world-wide
pestilences; the revolt of the hungry
could lead to war on a planetary scale.
Starvation and war are themselves
symptoms of a dynamic disequilibrium
in the social and economic environ¬
ment of our planet.
But it is not enough to consider
only the indirect effect of develop¬
ment on the Third World's environment
an effect which is economic or
cultural rather than purely physical
or natural. We should also consider
the threat of direct action: the
thoughtless waste of non-renewable
natural resources and the biological
unbalancing of ecological sub-sys¬
tems.
The Third World lives under the
permanent threat of the on-the-spot
installation of types of technological
development which fail to take the
ecological dimension into account
and which could therefore cause the
total disintegration of ecological struc¬
tures. And if we consider the relative
fragility of certain equatorial and
tropical ecosystems, where most of
the Third World is situated, the
danger appears even greater.
It is well known that the soils in
these areas are easily eroded when
their covering layer of vegetation is

over-exploited; and that the upsurges
of tropical rivers are curbed by
barriers composed of certain types of
plants, which to some extent regu¬
late and direct their flow. The des¬
truction of this vegetation may lead
to floods or to stagnation and other
serious disasters such as the loss
of flooded crops or the spread of
endemic diseases carried by insects
proliferating in stagnant water.
Does the fact that technological
progress and economic growth are
at present destroying the Third
World's environment justify the halt¬
ing of growth in these areas, as
some people insist? I do not believe
so. It seems to me quite absurd to
propose a zero growth rate for the
Third World when the peoples of
these areas consider economic dev¬
elopment to be their last hope of
emerging from the crushing burden
of poverty. I do not think those who
oppose development are right to call
a halt, when the urgent need is for
a reconversion of development.
Technology in itself is neither good
nor bad. It is its use which gives
it an ethical meaning. If technology
has worked against the Third World,
this is because it has been used with
one aim in view: maximum advantage
and profit. It is neo-colonialist exploi¬
tation that has led these countries to
their present state of despair, now
aggravated by the new threat of stop¬
ping the little progress they have made
in recent decades.
A great deal has been said about
the report drawn up for the Club of
Rome by the Massachusetts Institute
of Technology, with the help of com¬
puters. The report establishes the
limits of future growth with regard to
the harmful effects of technology and
industrialization as zero-growth for
the world economy as a whole.
While, superficially, the report
appears to be right for we are all
alarmed by the pollution and des¬
truction of the human environment it
cannot be accepted outright because
its conclusions have been distorted
by methods that can hardly be called
scientific.
The report supposes that the dev¬
elopment model it presents, which
paints the portrait of the world in a
century's time, is the only valid one
that can be built with available data
on present world realities. This exclu-
siveness, typical of the ethnocentric
culture of the highly developed coun¬
tries, reveals the unscientific nature
of the report.
One cannot forecast a single model
of the future. All those who study
futurology are well aware that one
cannot envisage a unique future
determined by the various conditions
prevailing at the time of the study.
All that can be done is to imagine a
series of probable futures according
to the Theory of Probability, which has
replaced the deterministic attitude that
was the rule before the adoption of
the Theory of Relativity. So one can
very well project several models of
the world of tomorrow.
One can estimate, with a high risk
of error, the probability of any of
these models becoming a reality. But
it is quite impossible to limit a scien¬
tific forecast to one single model. To
make linear projections, as was done
for the report on the limits of growth,
is a naive procedure which does not
take into account the structural break¬
downs which are a characteristic
feature of modern times. We live in
a period of discontinuity, not one of
continuity.
The worst mistake of the M.I.T.
report is not to have included the
problem of economic, social and poli¬
tical structures among the factors
determining growth. In the introduc¬
tion to the report the authors only
consider five development factors:
population, agricultural output, natural
resources, industrial output and pollu¬
tion.
There is not a word about the
problem of social and economic struc¬
tures. Yet everybody knows that the
level of production and the level- of
pollution i.e. the state of develop¬
ment and the state of the environment
essentially depend on the type of
structure dominant at a given place
and time.
By leaving out man and his culture,
the project has become alienated, for
it does not take into account the
realities of the modern world and
therefore the realities of the future.
If the majority of Third World coun¬
tries reject the conclusions of this
report, it is because they are suspi¬
cious of this proposal to stop growth,
which risks affecting the poorer re¬
gions of the world alone, since the
rich ones will obviously not obey it.
So the gap between the two worlds
will increase.
If this is true, all the charitable
paternalism of the Club of Rome
towards the countries of the Third
World will turn out to be a trap. Far
from being helped by this kind of
recipe, they will be enchained for
ever in underdevelopment and pov¬
erty.
The reaction of these countries
should be to try to find a type of
development that would be indepen¬
dent of neo-colonialism, applying tech¬
niques created on the spot the only
ones that would be valid and rational.
The present type of development, as
I see it, is obviously a failure; but
the world could be developed if it
were given social and economic struc¬
tures and means of production
different to those which exist today.
But before this can be done, the
war economy in which we live must
be reconverted into a peace economy,
and the enormous savings resulting
from partial disarmament must be
used to obtain a type of pacific dev¬
elopment that would be not only more
equitable but also non-polluting.

THE MYTH
OF ECOLOGICAL
EQUILIBRIUM
by Miguel A. Ozorio de Almeida
ERHAPS the best way to
put the environment issue in proper
perspective is to ask straight away the
basic question: according to whose
criteria is the environment to be con¬
sidered healthy, adequate, pleasant,
desirable?
If the subject were an anaconda,
and if the anaconda had a mind capa¬
ble of value judgments, it would prob¬
ably suggest that the world should be
a swampy forest; a dromedary would
wish it to be a desert. . But what
should it be for the human race? Cert¬
ainly not all desert or all swamp.
A certain misunderstanding has
permeated the whole debate on envi¬
ronmental protection and restoration,
even in relatively sophisticated cir¬
cles namely that we have to keep
or protect environment or ecological
"equilibrium".
The problem to be solved in fact
is not achieving an "ecological
balance" but, on the contrary obtain¬
ing the most efficient forms of "long-
term ecological imbalance". The prob¬
lem is not to exterminate mankind
now, in the name of ecological equi¬
librium, but to prolong our ability to
use natural resources for as long as
possible.
A basic misunderstanding of this
reality and the consequent striving
for ecological balance has led to
many ill-founded conclusions, both
explicit and implicit. Some suggest
MIGUEL A. OZORIO DE ALMEIDA, spec/a/
adviser to the Foreign Minister of Brazil,
headed the Brazilian delegation to the United
Nations Conference on the Human Environ¬
ment at Stockholm in 1972. Ambassador
Almeida has been closely associated with
the U.N. since 1948, in particular with the
Economic and Social Council, and was Braz¬
ilian delegate to the 1952 Unesco General
Conference.
that mankind reduce its numbers, or
be content with consuming less, or
both. The most interesting aspect of
these conclusions is that the "conclu-
ders" generally tend to shift the bur¬
den of reducing numbers or of consum¬
ing less to some community other than
their own.
But with only marginal exceptions
the great polluters are the highly
industrialized countries. Starting from
radionuclides (practically 100 per cent
of whose production and dissemin¬
ation is imputable to a few highly
developed countries) and going right
on down the list of all the other major
pollutants, the overwhelming discharge
of effluents is the consequence of the
developed countries recent technolo¬
gies and of their high levels of indus¬
trial as well as primary production
(particularly in over-fertilized, over-
herbicided, and synthetically control¬
led agriculture). The contribution to
this type of pollution by underdevel¬
oped countries is, in absolute terms,
extremely small and in relative terms
practically nil.
It could be said that if all pollution
generated by the developed countries
could be withdrawn from the earth,
there would be no pollution of world¬
wide significance; conversely if all
pollution directly Imputable to activities
in underdeveloped countries could be
withdrawn from the world today, all
dangers linked to pollution would con¬
tinue to exist in practically the same
densities.
The possible exception is the pol¬
lution that originates in the existence
of humans at low levels of income:
to be many and to be poor is offen¬
sive to the sight and feelings of some
people. So far most proposals in
this area do not concern co-operat¬
ion to reduce population. It is even
neatly construed that by reducing
numbers per capita income will
increase.
It is forgotten that there is a func¬
tional relationship between popula¬
tion and the ability to grow economic¬
ally and that, if in certain areas, most¬
ly in Asia, human numbers have
become excessive (probably on
account of colonial policies of the
last century), in most of Africa and
Latin America human densities are
still below ideal levels for efficient
economic development.
The threat of pollution is an area
in which there has been a lot of
pseudo-scientific extrapolation of the
doomsday variety.
We are threatened with the melt¬
ing of the polar ice-caps, the conse¬
quent rise in sea levels, and the whole¬
sale drowning of some of the largest
cities and capitals in the world.
We are threatened with the exhaus¬
tion of the oxygen reserve on earth
because of North American and Euro¬
pean over-consumption of this useful
gas, while certain effluents dumped
into the sea are jeopardizing its algae
oxygen-producing ability. We are also
told that the Brazilian occupation and
utilization of the Amazon forest will
eliminate its ability to compensate for
American oxygen voracity.
We are threatened with cancer;
everything that may be an irritant to
human tissues from love-making to
all sorts of organic and inorganic
compounds may produce cancer.
We are threatened with hunger.
We are threatened with emphysema.
We are threatened with poisons. We
are threatened with numbers that may 9n
be expected to eliminate all elbow- **
room on our little, already half-
scuttled "spaceship" earth.

ECOLOGICAL EQUILIBRIUM (Continued)
26
The sensible question to ask about
these dire predictions of course is:
how probable are these threats and
how long before they become real¬
ities?
One of the answers to this ques¬
tion has been provided by the secre¬
tariat of the 1972 Stockholm Confer¬
ence. In a balance sheet listing of
what are believed to be the twenty-
one most important pollutants, the
state of knowledge about effects other
than acute toxicity to experimental
mammals has been indicated as un¬
certain in all cases but one.
Another answer to the same ques¬
tion may be induced from the very
nature of most of the dramatic predict¬
ions made. Let us take, for instance,
the consequences of the accumulation
of carbon dioxide and the melting of
the polar ice-cap. The first observa¬
tion this evokes is that no index of
probability is attached to this predict¬
ion, which reduces its scientific value.
Our planet had already passed
through great variations in temperature
long before modern industry and tech¬
nology started tampering with its ecol¬
ogy. Each "warming up" period has
generated an opposite "cooling off"
tendency. Moreover, it should be not¬
ed that carbon dioxide accumulates
simultaneously with other effluents,
mostly particles, which reduce solar
radiation reaching the earth and thus
tend to cool its surface. *
As for the time span that these
predictions assume, if they apply to
the next ten years, we had better act
right away. If, however, it is a question
of a hundred years, we may have the
time to improve our knowledge and
thus risk fewer mistakes in dealing
with the problem. If it is one thousand
years, the threat must be discounted,
since it is not realistic to predict the
burning of fossil fuels for such a long
time. If it is one hundred thousand
or one million years, let us forget
about it.
The truth is that we do not yet know
enough to pass judgment and take
action in quite a few of the more
important fields. Ecology, through its
necessarily very broad, general equili¬
brium approach to the ecosystem, is
still very far from a complete science,
either as a methodology or as a body
of accepted facts.
The old scientific approach is inade¬
quate and the new ecological approach
is not yet sufficiently ripe. This leaves
us with a probabilistic outlook; quite
a few of the threats now being made
are illegitimate and another few prob¬
ably true, but it is hard to tell one
group from the other. What should be
done In these circumstances?
The DDT battle
continues
An international group of experts
on pesticides, who met in Rome
in November 1972, supports the
continued use of DDT in agricul¬
ture. "The benefits to man aris¬
ing from the proper controlled
use of DDT will outweigh the
possible risk from exposure",
declared the experts, advisers
to the Food and Agriculture
Organization and the World
Health Organization. The bene¬
fits of DDT, said their report, lay
in the prevention of food losses
to pests which would be disas¬
trous in the developing countries
(see also the "Unesco Courier",
June 1971, July 1971, February
1972, May 1972). The experts
also defended the use of mer¬
cury-based fungicides, whose
risks they considered negligible.
But they recommended further
research to discover completely
harmless yet equally effective
replacement fungicides.
The first step should be to identify
those cases of pollution that have
international significance and then,
within the limits of available know¬
ledge, to determine the degree of
probable urgency for the necessary
action. It is quite clear that the
existing situation of incomplete know¬
ledge precludes drastic action in most
fields.
Action might worsen the situation
rather than improve it as was true
in the case of smog clearance in
Los Angeles, where efforts to reduce
carbon monoxide in the exhaust
of motor vehicles led to measures
provoking the equally harmful pro¬
duction by high-powered engines of
nitrogen oxides and the highly poison¬
ous nitrogen dioxide. In the same
way the abolition of the use of DDT
and other persistent organochlorine
insecticides could drastically increase
malaria and reduce agricultural pro¬
duction in tropical areas.
The second step should thus aim
at sensible improvement of the situa¬
tion, as much as possible by reduction
of emission of the major sources of
pollution and in areas where the carry¬
ing capacity of the environment has
been clearly overtaxed.
This brings up a happy coincidence,
namely, that the largest sources of
pollution are to be found in highly
developed areas, where the largest
economic and technological resources
that are a necessary condition for the
ability to act on environmental prob¬
lems are also concentrated.
The third step should be the ini¬
tiation of adequate research for all
areas where danger seems to lurk, thus
creating the appropriate basis for
future action.
The legitimacy of yet another range
of problems relating to the pollution
of poverty or underdevelopment must
be carefully scrutinized. In rural
areas, pollution mostly consists of
poor sanitation and of food and water
contamination, and the major pollutants
are micro-organisms disseminated
because of the lack of appropriate
sewage. In urban areas the same
problems exist together with quite
a few others linked to excessive urban
densities at very low income levels.
The squalor of poverty itself is one
of the ugliest faces environment may
acquire.
A third characteristic is that, contrary
to the prevailing conditions in devel¬
oped countries, such pollution tends
to diminish with economic develop¬
ment itself. In fact it is impossible
to correct this particular pollution
process, mainly because the resources
necessary to cope with it are not
available at low levels of income.
It is thus highly inappropriate to
discuss these problems, both rural
and urban, outside the framework of
economic development.
Nor is pollution the only problem
of environmental degradation linked
to poverty. Problems of agricultural
soil conservation and of different
types of urban deterioration are also
essentially the result of the economic
inability to act. The prevailing condi¬
tions In the rural areas of developing
countries are based upon a fundamen¬
tal lack of capital resources, whether
in terms of equipment or in terms of
inputs for the improvement (or even
maintenance) of soil conditions.
In urban areas, most problems of
environmental degradation are linked
to the inadequacy of productive
employment in industry. This is the
consequence of the inappropriateness
of imported technologies to the factor
endowment of underdeveloped coun¬
tries, where labour tends to be
plentiful and cheap but is not being
fully utilized within the framework of
the internationally available techno¬
logies.
All proposals so far made for the
solution of urban degradation in under¬
developed countries do not touch upon
the core of the problem, which is
technical and economic. By concen¬
trating upon consequences and ignor¬
ing causes, this approach represents

Ten major pollutants
CARBON
DIOXIDE
Normally the result of energy consumed in power stations, in industry and homes.
It is thought that accumulation of this gas could significantly increase the earth's
surface temperature, with the possibility of geochemical and ecological disasters.
2
4
CARBON
MONOXIDE
SULPHUR
DIOXIDE
NITROGEN
OXIDES
Results from incomplete fuel combustion, mostly in the steel industry, in solid
waste disposal, in oil refineries and in motor vehicles. Some scientists believe this
highly poisonous gas may adversely affect the stratosphere.
Smoke from power generating plants, industrial factories, automobiles and fuel used
in the home often produces sulphuric acid. The polluted air aggravates respiratory
diseases, corrodes trees and limestone buildings, as well as certain synthetic
textiles and vegetation.
Produced by combustion engines, aircraft, furnaces, incinerators, excessive use of
fertilizers, forest fires, industrial plants. Causes smog, may lead to respiratory
infections and bronchitis in new-born children. Causes excessive growth of
aquatic plants, depletion of oxygen, loss of fish and degradation of water quality.
PHOSPHATES
Found in sewage, especially in detergents, in over-fertilized land and the consequent
runoff into water, and as wastes from intensive animal farming. A major factor
in the degradation of lake and river water.
6 MERCURY
Resulting from combustion of fossil fuels, the chlor-alkali industry, electrical and
paint manufacture, mining and refining processes, the pulp and paper industry.
Mercury is a serious food contaminant, especially of seafood, and is a cumulative
poison that affects the nervous system.
Principle source the anti-knock additive in petrol, but lead smelting, the chemical
industry and pesticides also contribute. It is a cumulative poison that affects enzymes
and impairs cell metabolism. Accumulates in marine deposits and in drinking water.
Contamination due to the operation of oil, tankers, shipping accidents, refinery op¬
eration, offshore oil production and transport wastes. Has disastrous ecological
effects including damage to plankton, marine life and sea birds as well as pollution
of beaches and estuaries.
DDT AND
OTHER
PESTICIDES
Very toxic to crustaceans at extremely low concentrations. Used mostly in agriculture.
The runoff of these products into the water kills off fish and their food and conta¬
minates man's food. May have a cancer-producing effect, and may reduce population
of beneficial insects, thus helping in the creation of new pests.
10 RADIATION
Mostly produced in nuclear fuel processing, and also in weapon production and testing
and nuclear-powered ships. Has important medical and research uses, but above a
certain dose can cause malignant growths and genetic changes.

ECOLOGICAL EQUILIBRIUM (Continued)
Three roads to world sanity
28
a serious diversion of resources from
development and constitutes an inef¬
ficient attack upon the problem.
An implicit assumption has been
that, given the present demographic
magnitudes and distribution in the
world and given the present patterns
of consumption of natural resources
and of emission of pollutants by the
developed countries, the world cannot
afford the economic development of
the underdeveloped countries along
the lines followed by the presently
developed ones.
If the three-fourths of mankind
represented by underdeveloped coun¬
tries were to squander natural
resources at the same rate (in per
capita terms) as, for example, the
United States or the Western European
countries, there would not be enough
oxygen to go around and there would
not be enough metals for industry,
while, on the other hand, there would
be so much carbon, sulphur, and
nitrogen dioxide that mankind would be
pushed toward extinction.
As a result of this line of reasoning,
three basic measures are being pro¬
posed:
explicitly, the control of popula¬
tion growth in underdeveloped coun¬
tries;
implicitly, a ceiling on the devel¬
opment of underdeveloped countries;
and
explicitly, a reduction of the
emission of major pollutants by
developed countries.
What this scheme obviously lacks
in logical symmetry if not accepta¬
bility is a fourth measure: that
overpopulated countries reduce their
own demographic numbers and, if
necessary, their industrial "prédation"
upon nature so as to reduce their
claim upon the natural resources of
underdeveloped countries.
It is of course impossible for under¬
developed countries to accept inter¬
nationally agreed ceilings for their
population and for their economic
development. These ceilings are
made all the more unacceptable by the
underlying assumption that the popu¬
lations and development levels of
developed countries are taken for
granted and not liable to discussion,
change, and correction. Lack of
knowledge about the earth's capacity
to sustain human life would make such
ceilings anything but a scientific
necessity.
Plans for the Stockholm Conference
were marked by the attitude that the
developed countries have demonstrat¬
ed, by their development, a special
right to salvation and perpetuation,
thus passing on to the more numerous
underdeveloped peoples the respon¬
sibility for creating the necessary
space on earth. This attitude is all
the more dangerous for being implicit
and not normally discussed in public.
Emphasis upon population growth,
as such, unlinked to the relationship
of the population to the national
resource base including geographical
space is inadequate and unac¬
ceptable.
Countries with more than 100, 200,
or even 300 persons per square
kilometre are thus left outside this
approach, while countries with fewer
than 20 inhabitants per square kilo¬
metre are being condemned for demo¬
graphic policies that would bring about
increased economic efficiency and
constitute a necessary condition for
their national integration and fulfill¬
ment as a human community.
IfcSSENTIAL to the Stock¬
holm approach to environment is the
assumption of the universal right of all
peoples to share in the earth's natural
resources. These resources are not
the so-called common goods, like the
high seas or the bottom of the oceans,
but the mineral, animal, soil, and other
resources within national boundaries.
This is, of course, a very beautiful
assumption, but it would fit better in
the institutional framework of a world
government and we should not forget
that we are still very far from this idea.
United Nations action takes place
within the framework of a world divid¬
ed into national states having a high
degree of sovereignty over the resour¬
ces within their borders. This is a fact
of life that, until changed, must be
kept in mind.
If this were not so, the still untapped
natural resources of underdeveloped
countries very often their only assets
and basis for development would
quite likely be placed by the Stockholm
Conference within a World Trust and
thus at the disposal of the voracious
industry and consumption of highly
developed countries.
Simultaneously the developed world,
closely sheltered by its national
boundaries, would keep basically
unchanged its economic power, its
industrial productivity, and its finan¬
cial control of the international com¬
munity.
It should be understood that what
is necessary is either one universal
framework for all sectors, or a nation¬
al framework for all sectors. If
resources are shared in trust by all
peoples, then economic power,
industrial productivity, and financial
control should also be shared. Since
the latter is considered unthinkable by
developed countries, the former
should also be unthinkable by under¬
developed countries.
A sensible approach at this stage
should be to:
Establish conditions for more
research in critical areas of the envi¬
ronment field;
Muster countries to initiate nation¬
al and international efforts to prevent
the unneccessary loss of unrecover¬
able resources;
Provide for a better dissemination
of knowledge in the broad area of
environment.
In more specific areas, there should
be a commitment by the great polluters
of world-wide significance to take
measures to reduce pollution at the
source, or to compensate or neutral¬
ize its effects wherever they are felt.
And measures should be formulated
to accelerate development of under¬
developed countries so as to reduce
the environmental degradation conse¬
quent to poverty and help in the
creation of additional resources for
environmental restoration alongside the
development process.
Furthermore, an effort should be
made to prevent the transfer of part
of the costs of environmental im¬
provement in developed countries to
the underdeveloped peoples, through
trade or financial or technological
manipulations.
This is the moment of history in
which modern science and technology,
making full application of both accu¬
mulated knowledge and potentialities,
is, perhaps for the first time, on the
verge of carrying out its promises to
provide abundance for all mankind.
And the most important point I can
make is that now, more than ever, we
must not allow ourselves to be cheat¬
ed of our opportunities, to be swept
into a period of unnecessary panic,
impelled by a lamentably short-sighted
interpretation of trends.
We must not meet unjustifiable
fears with dreary solutions: scarcity
for all, reduction of population, and
masochistic castigation of present and
future generations through economiz¬
ing on resources that are far from
exhausted.

POWER FROM THE SUN. The French Pyrenees have become a major centre for research into the in¬
dustrial uses of solar energy. At the Mont-Louis solar laboratory, a sun-powered furnace has been used
for specialized metallurgical research during the past 20 years (see "Unesco Courier", Sept. 1958).
Today, the first solar "factory" is operating at Odeillo, six miles away. Here, some of the 63 mobile
mirrors of its solar furnace capture the sun's rays which another concave mirror as high as a 9 -storey
building (not shown here) concentrates on to the furnace itself. "Increasing the world's green plant
cover (which absorbs and uses solar energy)," says Nikolai Timofeyev-Ressovsky, "would trap
enough energy to raise the productivity of the biosphere 2 to 3 times."
The biosphere
is 10 times richer
than we think

tinguished Soviet biologist and geneticist

'URING the past twenty
years the problem of the population
explosion has moved to the centre of
world-wide attention and concern.
Some economists believe that even
with good infrastructural organization
our planet is not capable of feeding
(on the basis of current scientific and
technical possibilities) more than 8 to
12,000 million people.
Consequently within the next
hundred years or so nearly half the
Earth's population would lack not only
food but also the biochemical sub¬
stances so important to modern life.

THE BIOSPHERE (Continued)
An optimistic view based on hard facts
30
surface that they may be regarded as
a "new geological factor". Rapid
population growth is accompanied by
an equally rapid increase in the scale,
volume and intensity of man's technical
and industrial activities.
At this pace it is not inconceivable
that life on our planet and the equili¬
brium of the biosphere will ultimately
be disrupted, with disastrous con¬
sequences that might even jeopardize
man's very existence.
At first sight, therefore, the possi¬
bility of achieving a balance between
a teeming population and the limited
productive forces of nature does not
seem very encouraging. It Is predict¬
ed that in a hundred years or so a
good 50 per cent of the population
will be "surplus", with no food to eat
and perhaps not enough air to breathe
and that water will be lacking for both
domestic use and industry.
It follows that of the major scientific
and technical problems before us, the
balance between man and the bio¬
sphere must be regarded as the most
urgent, arid its global solution will
need the participation of all branches
of science, including mathematics.
But let us look at the same question
from a more optimistic angle, using
arguments that are not in the least
Utopian but are based on forecasts
that can be made here and now in
the light of current knowledge and
achievements.
iI^bARTH is a planet on which
many varied forms of life have dev¬
eloped. All cosmogonie theories re¬
cognize the existence in the Universe
of "dead planets", devoid of life. The
great peculiarity which makes earth a
"living" planet is its characteristic
envelope known as the biosphere.
A rough outline of the working of
the biosphere shows, first, an intake
of energy from the sun. Within the
biomass vast metabolic reactions take
place as a result of which certain
organisms are born, others die, some
feed on others, make use of their
products, and so on.
It is an immense continuous biolo¬
gical cycle with countless materials and
energy forms changing from one
biological state to another. The cycle
also has an outlet at the point at
which a certain amount of living
matter and energy is lost in the
formation of sedimentary rock.
What new resources can this vast
biological cycle offer to man? Let us
consider this question on three levels:
the energy intake; the biological cycle;
the end of the biological cycle and
the beginning of the geological cycle.
First, the earth receives a certain
amount of solar energy. Of this only
the fraction absorbed by plants
capable of photosynthesis is of biolo¬
gical interest. Of the total energy
received only 1 to 10 per cent, varying
according to geographical region, is
absorbed by plants and not all of it
is used for photosynthesis.
We can speak of an "efficiency
coefficient" in Nature just as we can
in technology. This coefficient is diffi¬
cult to compute exactly but it can be
said to vary between 2 and 8 per cent,
depending on the species of plants.
Thus we see that even at the
"intake" point man can do something
to make plants absorb a greater
amount of energy by simply increas¬
ing the density of the earth's green
cover.
We have to admit that so far he
has done the contrary. In his
economic and industrial activities man
reduces this density by over-exploiting
forests, pastures and fields. Green
cover density is also lower than it
need be because very little is done to
reafforestate deserts and reclaim arid
lands.
But it is quite certain that in the
present state of technology and
industry it is perfectly possible in
theory to reverse this process and to
raise the density of the green cover
on land and in suitable stretches of
water, especially fresh water lakes.
It has been calculated that if this
were done, the rate of absorption
of solar energy would be increased at
least 1è to 2 times. Biological
productivity would be substantially
increased, probably 2 to 3 times.
This is precisely the production
increase required in the forecasts for
the next hundred years.
Let us now consider the major biolo¬
gical cycle itself. Man cannot really
be regarded as a thrifty manager of his
natural resources, for he destroys or
seriously jeopardizes the balance of
plant life and wildlife. A study of the
reproduction of land and water animals
and plants should make it possible to
increase the effective productivity of
the vast biological cycle considerably,
simply because a vaster area of the
earth's green cover can sustain a
greater number of animals.
In the last ten years genetics the
science of heredity has discovered
more and more about the structure
and functioning of the genotype, the
code of genetic information trans¬
mitted from generation to generation.
Soon man will probably be able to
influence these various phenomena in
order to increase yields and accelerate
selective breeding of crops and
livestock, and this too can enormously
raise the feedback of the biological
cycle.
We may therefore say that at the
level of the biological cycle man can
obtain eventually two, three or even
more times as many useful products
as he does today. In Japan, for
instance, over 20 species of algae
(seaweeds) are already used in the
manufacture of foods for human
consumption and for animal fodder.
us see what increased
potential all this gives us. At the
point of energy intake the increase in
the rate of absorption of solar energy
and plant efficiency gives us a produc¬
tivity increase of from 1 to 2, and at the
level of the major biological cycle we
have a further increase of 3 to 4,
which gives a total increase of about
6 to 8 times. And this is possible
solely on the basis of established
knowledge and current techniques.
Let us now look at another equally
important biological problem. We
know that all over the earth there are
more or less complex biological
communities consisting of numerous
species or organisms living together.
So far we do not know by what
mechanisms such communities persist
through time provided that man does
not disrupt their equilibrium or modify
the species coexisting in them.
When man has found the key to
the balance of nature, he will be able
to obtain infinitely more from the
biological cycle than he does now.
He will be able to alter and improve
the earth's biological communities at
will, deliberately, scientifically and to
his advantage. And if this enables
him to raise the biological productivity
of the earth a further 1i times, that
will bring the total increase up to ten
times.

<![CDATA[
Now let us look at our last point
the "outlet" of the biosphere. We
know that in some parts of the earth,
at the bottom of some lakes, the mud,
due to a mineralization process by
living organisms, turns into soluble
salts and is ultimately transformed
into "sapropel", an extremely interest¬
ing organic substance mainly compos¬
ed of carbohydrates, proteins and
fats.
There are already many uses for this
substance. The Japanese employ the
best quality in foodstuffs, the medium
qualities in animal feed and the lowest
as organic fertilizer. In other countries
it is used in sweet-making as a sub¬
stitute for gelatine and agar. But by
and large it Is still used only in very
small proportions.
This brings us to a far wider Issue.
It is certain that in future it will be the
special task of biotechnical engineers
to study the products of the biological
cycle with a view to preventing the
gradual degradation of valuable sub¬
stances Into a conglomerate of lower
molecules of little utility, inorganic
salts and limestone.
These specialists will try to harness
the products of the biosphere at the
point where they are present in their
most valuable forms organic macro-
molecules of carbohydrates, proteins
and fats, which mankind needs so
much. This is the third level at which
man can increase the natural produc¬
tivity of the planet.
I began with a rather pessimistic
account of the rapidly widening gap
between population growth and the
natural biological reserves of our
planet. But after examining the
processes going on in the biosphere
and what we have learned from the
research of leading scientists we can
make a far more optimistic forecast:
Man can increase the earth's pro¬
ductivity not twice but ten times and
more without damaging the potential
capacity of the biosphere.
The conclusion is obvious. The
most important and most urgent
problem is that man should learn to
use the products of the biosphere
rationally and with moderation.
Scientists must start now to find a
solution.
A first step would be to make an
exhaustive inventory of the environ¬
ment. Action must be taken im¬
mediately to safeguard nature and to
develop the new technology which
will eliminate from every branch of
industry all sources of pollution and
contamination of the biosphere.
Methods used in forestry and
fishing, etc. need to be rationalized
at once; greater use should be made
of new species of living organisms;
the density of plant cover must be
rapidly increased; biological produc¬
tivity of the various sectors of the
biosphere must be raised.
All these inter-related tasks can be
carried out only if we co-ordinate the
efforts of many fields of science and
draw widely on the most modern
materials and the most varied in¬
dustries. And we should never forget
that the No.1 problem facing mankind
today has got to be solved. For
mankind it is a matter of life or death.
'VER the past 15 to 20
years, the Soviet Government has
shown that the protection of nature
is one of its main preoccupations.
Among other legal and practical mea¬
sures, it has launched vast reaffores¬
tation schemes, made studies of the
hydrological balance of northern water¬
ways, of the Caspian and Aral Seas,
taken steps to preserve Lake Baikal
from pollution and introduced laws
concerning soil use and pollution of
air and water, to quote but a few
examples.
Such action was reinforced and
extended by the adoption, in Sep¬
tember 1972, by the U.S.S.R. Supreme
Soviet, of a new series of far-reaching
measures concerning protection of the
environment and the rational use of
natural resources.
In spite of the effectiveness of
these measures and of those adopted
in other countries, they are not in
themselves enough to resolve many of
the problems of the pollution of the
atmosphere and the oceans. Inter¬
national co-operation is essential since
pollution entails world-wide conse¬
quences which can onk be controlled
by the concerted efforts of all
countries.
S.O.S. FOR PLANET EARTH
Classroom studies and children's books are bringing
home the problems of the environment to young people
in many countries. In Italy the International Book Centre

MEDITERRANEAN: DANGER! OIL POLLUTION
Exploration of the Mediterranean Sea
(ICSEM, in Monaco), the FAO Working
Party has commissioned an updated
study on the state of pollution in the
Mediterranean.
A draft agreement between all Medi¬
terranean countries has been ham¬
mered out during a series of meetings
in Malta, promoted by a non-govern¬
mental organization called "Pacem in
Maribus", the members of which are
scientists, lawyers and politicians from
all over the world interested in marine
problems.
There have also been important bi¬
lateral and multilateral discussions.
Parliamentary groups from the coun¬
tries of the northern Mediterranean
basin, including Italy, France, Yugo
slavia and Monaco, have frequently dis¬
cussed the serious problems of the
Adriatic and Tyrrhenian Seas.
These direct contacts between coun¬
tries on the shores of the Mediterra¬
nean are in line with the proposals
of the United Nations Conference on
the Human Environment in Stockholm,
which has recommended, in an effort
to eliminate all voluntary sources of
oil pollution by 1975, that regional
agreements should be concluded for
the protection of specific sea areas.
But an agreement between all Medi¬
terranean countries would be of only
relative value unless it were also hon¬
oured by all countries (including those
outside the Mediterranean) whose
tankers use its waters.
For this reason the problem needs
(Continued from page 17)
to be tackled in the amendments to be
made to the 1969 London Convention
and which are to be signed in 1973
by IMCO's member countries.
Italy and France have proposed the
inclusion in the 1973 Convention of a
section concerning the Mediterranean
and other "special areas". This would
specify what anti-pollution measures
should be taken and would make com¬
pulsory the installation and use of
plants for treating tanker ballast.
The building of such plants at all
terminals where crude oil is loaded
would be an immediate and practical
solution, since the Mediterranean can
no longer wait for long-term solutions
and the theoretical prospects of new
technologies to mature.

A WORLD POLICY FOR THE ENVIRONMENT
32
recommended that the environment
secretariat should be located in Nai¬
robi (Kenya).
Innovations now undertaken at na¬
tional and international levels should,
within a few years, give us some prac¬
tical evidence of how best to struc¬
turally organize and integrate develop¬
mental and environmental goals and
operational programme. To obtain an
input of information, properly balanced
in relation to programme needs, pre¬
sents an additional challenge.
Availability of information in a usable
form is a necessary, but insufficient,
step toward better environmental deci¬
sions. There is also need to insure
that a broad spectrum of decision¬
makers are aware of the availability
of the data, and that they correctly
appraise its significance for their work.
Both the Biosphere Conference and
the U.N. Stockholm Conference re¬
commended education and training
programmes for technical, professional,
and administrative personnel to enable
them more effectively to integrate eco¬
logical concepts into their work. And,
because many environmental decisions
require a scientific input, it has been
necessary to improve the ability of
scientists to advise and to assist public
officials in arriving at ecologically
valid environmental and developmental
decisions.
Prior to the Stockholm Conference,
the International Council of Scientific
Unions' Scientific Committee on Prob¬
lems of the Environment brought to¬
gether, at Canberra (Australia), a group
of scientists from developing countries
for the purpose of clarifying environ¬
mental issues, especially in relation
to development objectives.
Regional seminars for officials,
chiefly from developing countries, were
sponsored by the United Nations
Economic Commissions and the
Regional Office in Beirut; and the
Secretary-General of the United
Nations Conference on the Human
Environment convened a panel of
experts in June 1971 at Founex
(Switzerland) to consider the inter¬
relationships of development and
environment, with emphasis on policy
formulation and action.
These efforts are among the more
important of a much larger number of
official and unofficial conferences,
seminars, and workshops intended
ultimately to improve the quality of
environmental decision-making. Pre-
Stockholm efforts in this direction were
necessarily experimental; post-Stock¬
holm training for environmental deci¬
sion-making will almost certainly be¬
come a regular and continuing func¬
tion of many public agencies and scien¬
tific and commercial organizations.
The purpose of decision-making is
to arrive at a judgment regarding
proposed action: whether, how, or
when to act. A decision against action
may be as significant as one for action,
and the way in which a decision is
made may be as important as the
substance of what is decided.
ÍT international levels, the
diversities among nations require a
broad base of deliberation for deci¬
sions that affect all or large groups of
national states. At national levels (but
increasingly at international levels
also) there is need to benefit from the
contributions of the non-governmental
organizations to the decision process.
Non-governmental organizations were
strongly represented at the Stockholm
Conference and made major direct and
indirect contributions to official action.
A structure for environmental deci¬
sion-making is thus emerging, slowly
(Continued from page 6)
perhaps in relation to need but
rapidly by historical precedent. This
structure may in time provide a
coherent system for environmental
decision-making that links all political
levels local, national, regional, and
international, and that provides regular
channels for continuous communica¬
tion among scientists, planners, and
decision-makers, as well as between
official and non-governmental agencies.
But meanwhile, who makes the deci¬
sions on environmental affairs?
A superficial answer would be:
almost everybody or in some in¬
stances, nobody. The present disorders
of our global environment reflect the
inadequacy of our decision process at
all jurisdictional levels. No nation as
yet can claim true expertise in envi¬
ronmental management. The so-called
developed nations are only a few
years ahead of the developing states
in awareness and experience.
Environmental protection technolo¬
gies may be rapidly transferred where
receptive conditions exist. Awareness
of the need for wise environmental
management is rapidly becoming evi¬
dent among the leadership in many
developing countries. Ecologically
sound policies are increasingly under¬
stood to go hand in hand with effect¬
ive development. There is indeed
ground for optimism that, at least,
some developing countries may bring
their environmental problems under
control more rapidly than will the older
industrialized states.
The task of international environ¬
mental and developmental policy today
is to develop the concepts, criteria,
and institutional arrangements which
will give the best chances for public
action addressed to the broad range
of human needs experienced by all
mankind.

Unesco General Conference
Unesco has now embarked on the world
programme for 1973-74 in science, edu¬
cation and culture adopted by its General
Conference in Paris on November 21.
The conference, at which the People's
Republic of China was represented for
the first time, approved a budget of
$119,954,000 for the Unesco programme.
Admission of Bangladesh and the German
Democratic Republic during the confer¬
ence brings Unesco's membership to 131.
Nature conservation project
A project to distribute to schoolchildren
booklets on nature conservation written
and illustrated by educators and artists in
Kenya, India and Venezuela is being
launched by the International Union for
Conservation of Nature and Natural
Resources in collaboration with Unesco.
A Unesco Gift Coupon Project* will pay
for the design and printing of the booklets.
* Protect No. 528. For further information on
Unesco Gift Coupons a form of International
money order which beneficiaries in developing
countries can use to buy school supplies and
others materials write to: Unesco Gift Coupon
Programme, Place de Fontenoy, Parls-7°.
International science prizes
Two international science prizes were
presented by Mr. René Maheu, Unesco's
c '
rnLÍL
Director-General, at Unesco H.Q. in Paris
on November 22. The Unesco Science
Prize for achievements of special value to
the developing countries was awarded
jointly to Dr. Viktor Kovda, the distinguished
Soviet soil scientist and to a group of
nine Austrian scientists who developed a
new and cheaper way to make steel. The
Kalinga Prize for the Popularization of
Science was awarded to the internationally-
known French physicist, Prof. Pierre Auger.
Prof. Auger has written and broadcast regu¬
larly for the public, and helped to bring
science into the programmes of the French
Radio and Television Service.
Jawaharlal Nehru fellowship
for Indian graphic artist
The young Indian graphic artist Narendra
(Narendra Nath Srivastava) has been
awarded the Jawaharlal Nehru Memorial
Foundation Fellowship for his work in the
development of Devanagari script used for
writing Hindi and Sanskrit. In our
December 1972 issue on the Art of the
Book, we published a work by Narendra
(not Navendra, as misprinted in the caption
on page 35) entirely composed of his newly-
designed Devanagari characters. An exhi¬
bition of paintings by Narendra was held
in Pans last month.
To save Venice
A series of four gold and silver medallions
have been issued by the "Venezia Nostra"
Foundation (Italy), as part of Unesco's
international campaign to save Venice.
Funds from their sale, which closed on
December 31, 1972, will be used to restore
the famous Rialto bridge. The reverse
side of the medallions are an exact replica
of a 16th century Venetian sequin, an
ancient gold coin.
Dr. Hans Rieben
The "Unesco Courier" regrets to
announce the death, in Berne on
November 23, 1972, of Dr. Hans

Letters to the Editor
THE EMERGENCE OF MAN
Sir,
This letter is sent to you by a group
of school mothers with children in a
private school at Berne (Switzerland).
We meet every Monday afternoon for
cultural group work. Several members
of our group are subscribers to your
magazine and we have used many of
your interesting and well compiled
issues in our discussions.
Our discussions roam into many
fields, e.g. education, religion, philo¬
sophy, etc., but our main theme might
be summed up as "Man, as a physical,
soulful and spiritual Being, his origin,
development and future within the pres¬
ent, highly materialistic and technical
world."
Our letter is brought up by your
August-September 1972 issue, "The
Emergence of Man". This question is of
paramount importance to us and a reply
is a human necessity, not only of passing
scientific interest. We were deeply
disappointed by the contents of this
issue. Such a criticism does not apply
to the make-up of the magazine.
The problem of the origin of Man
concerns every individual on earth. The
reply shapes his attitude towards life
and fellow-beings. It therefore hardly
seems proper to base a reply quite
narrow-mindedly on only one scientific
hypothesis. The question of origin and
descent of Man has been raised ever
since he appeared on earth and a wide
range of answers were given. In your
issue, the reply is based on one theory,
formulated only a short time ago and
transformed several times since its
conception.
Evolution is a factor not to be neglect¬
ed in a reply to the question about the
origin of Man. One version follows
Darwin and Haeckel through a long line
of anthropomorphous apes to Man.
Another version, as taught by one
branch of modern evolutionary research,
remains within the field of materialistic
matter and reduces everything: life,
perception, spiritual activity to variable
chemical processes. The difference
between these versions is only one of
degree, but at least both should have
been covered.
Since the first unquestionable and
established traces of Man, which your
issue shows in his artistic endeavour
(tools, ornaments, rock carvings and
paintings, etc.), he has asked himself
this question during thousands of years.
His questions resulted in many different
replies, but this basic experience of
mankind is not even mentioned in your
issue.
Since remote antiquity, Man felt
himself to be a creation, if not even
a part of higher powers. Of importance
to him were those influences which
turned him into a feeling, aspiring, res¬
ponsible being. He over-emphasized
this part of his entity, to the exclusion
of other parts, so that in time the
necessity arose for him to become
conscious as well of the origin of his
physical body.
Your magazine is published in many
languages and it reaches almost all
countries of the world. In the hand of
a teacher it turns into a tool for shaping
future generations. The danger is
greatest in the underdeveloped coun¬
tries, with the almost complete absence
of sufficient teaching aids and books,
that such pictures are accepted at face
value and without any doubts. This
also applies to the text, insofar as this
can be easily read or translated. Gener¬
ations, striving towards a new and
overall view of the world, get this one¬
sided Darwinian version of the "struggle
for survival" and "natural selection"
drummed into their brains as proof of
their descent from the apesl
We feel that you are fully aware of
the tremendous responsibility involved
in your work. Unfortunately, it seems
to have escaped your awareness how
destructive such a biased reply must
become in the minds of people, where
untold preceding generations knew
themselves to be in contact with a spi¬
ritual reality, or where such a relation
was being sought for. Your reply tears
them away from such relations. Man is
thrown back exclusively to his purely
physical organism, and is linked into
a evolutionary chain created by chance
and uncontrolled mutations.
Any thinking person can accept
"Creation and Evolution", or "Creation
with Evolution", if both are being di¬
rected towards a pre-planned goal under
the guidance of some higher wisdom.
The chance product of unplanned biolo¬
gical and chemical reactions and muta¬
tions cannot be held responsible for
any results of his actions, even if he
destroys himself and others in the
clutches of drugs, drinks or passions.
Not one problem of human society or
of mankind can be solved by ignoring
the human-spiritual components of Man.
Unesco, a champion for the dignity and
the rights of mankind, cannot be allow¬
ed to feel content with the concept of
Man as a purely physical being alone
and with the belief, that the human
race is exclusively the product of freak
mutations within biological and chemical
processes.
A materialistic belief, as it was still
proclaimed by Kautsky, may not be
considered as up-to-date and binding
in our days. The overcoming of mater¬
ialism should have progressed beyond
the stage requested by Driesch and
others. The "Unesco Courier" owes
it to its readers to inform them of the
latest developments in research and the
results obtained thereby.
In a question as important as the
one about the origin of Man, the
viewpoint of modern scientists, to men¬
tion only Einstein, Oppenheimer and
Heisenberg is a decisive factor in a
renewed humanism.
From many of your former issues we
have formed the opinion that your
organization, more than others, looks
upon Man as a free and morally respon¬
sible being. If this is correct, the
biased theory of the origin of Man,
applying to the human body only,
cannot suffice in itself. In the records
of great religions and nations, as well
as in modern spiritual research, may
be found a host of references to and
proofs for the physical-soulful-spiritual
origin of mankind.
Therefore, we hope that a future
issue might try to probe a bit deeper
for a reply to the question: "Where
are the origins of Man as an entity?"

THE GREAT HERITAGE OF IRAN
Sir,
I have read with great interest your
article in the July 1972 issue of the
"Unesco Courier" entitled "Renaissance
of Arab Thought and Literature".
It is indeed, fascinating to note the
important scientific and cultural impact
of Islamic civilization on the history of
mankind.
There is, however, a point of histor¬
ical clarification, well known to pro¬
fessionals In the field, which may not
be evident to all of your readers. At
the height of its glory, the broad Islamic
empire, was the melting pot of many
different races, languages and cultures.
During this golden age, the rich and
powerful arabic language became the
major source of universal scientific and
literary communication. The treasures
of this intellectual and philosophical
heritage had emanated from many
different nations and races, which
eventually coalesced into the great
family of Islam. It may, therefore, be
appropriate to pay due tribute to the
great scientists, philosophers and
writers of Islam, not only as the torch-
bearers of Islam, but also as the heirs
of those nations which composed the
Islamic empire.
Many of the great writers mentioned
in your article, such as Ibn al-Muqaffa,
Ibn-Sina (Avicenna), Al-Khwarazmi, Al-
Biruni, Ar-Razi and Al-Farabi, were of
Iranian origin. They wrote in their
mother tongue (Persian), and made
numerous long-lasting scientific contri¬
butions in Arabic, that rich language of
Islam.
In our day, many scientists of all
nations, choose to write for instance,
in English. Evidently, the choice of a
common means of communication does
not reflect on one's national origin.
The above note is brought to
the attention of your readers in the
interest of historical accuracy. Looking,
however, from a higher plateau, beyond
all national boundaries, great men
belong to all mankind.
Prof. F. Reza
Ambassador, Permanent Delegate
of Iran at Unesco
The article in our July 1972 Issue dealt
with Arab and Islamic thought as a
world phenomenon irrespective of the
national origins of the various scientists
and scholars mentioned. Only a few
months earlier a special issue was
entirely devoted to "Iran, Cultural Cross¬
roads for 2,500 Years" (Oct. 1971)
where the contributions of all the
scientists mentioned by Ambassador
Reza were described In detail Editor.

Animal shadowland
The ancient and almost forgotten art of the outline, commonly
and erroneously called the "silhouette" has been brought
to a flowering which it has perhaps rarely known before
by an American artist born in Florence, Italy, Ugo Mochi.
His designs are not only works of supreme beauty but also
detailed and scientifically accurate studies of wildlife, birds,
animals and nature. Two examples are shown above. See
