ples of Maichisan, in
Kansu province, are
among the spectacular
archaeological discov¬
eries made in China
in the last 20 years.
They contain some of
the earliest examples
of Chinese Buddhist

common theme is the
seated Buddha flanked
by bodhisattvas and
other figures such as

THE ICELAND SAGA
The hardy ponies of Iceland seem
to have stepped straight out of a
Lascaux cave-painting. Brought over
from Norway by the Vikings, the
ancestors of these ponies carried the
early settlers to every corner of the
new land and for centuries were the
Icelanders sole means of transport.
Today, in a world of cars and planes,
they are beloved by all Icelanders.

June day in the year 1000.
At Thingvellir on the Oxará River, in
Iceland, the Althing has been In ses¬
sion for some days. For threescore
and ten years this assembly, which in
modern times has sometimes been
referred to as "the Grandmother of^
Parliaments", has been convening for
two nightless weeks in June every
summer. At its session this summer
the Althing has to decide a question
more fateful than any it has ever been
faced with: whether in the future paga¬
nism or Christianity shall reign In the
land.
Thingvellir is an extraordinary setting
for a parliament: the level, grassy
banks of the Oxará River, and above
the west bank a lava slope which rises
to form the east wall of a great lava

The towering pillars of an Icelandic
basalt rock formation, thrown up by
millenial volcanic upheavals and form¬
ing a natural "Parthenon" of the Hyper-
boreas, or "Land Beyond the North"
of Greek legend.
E leven centuries ago, the westward wave of
Scandinavian migration reached a new land,
just south of the Arctic Circle, where ice
contended with fire, where glaciers, volcanoes
and boiling springs seemed to hurl defiance at
man and at each other. This was Iceland. In this
issue of the "Unesco Courier" we recount the
saga of the Icelandic people's unending struggle
with a hostile climate, the splendours of the
literary heritage of a unique culture, and the
beauty and geological contrasts of a country
still shrouded in legend but in which myth has
blended into the modernity of the 20th century.
chasm. The dark west wall of the
chasm echoes every word spoken on
the brink at the top of the lava slope,
the site of Lögberg, the Law Rock.
From this rock the Law Speaker, the
supreme officer of the Althing, must
annually recite before the assembly
and the general public the unwritten
laws of the nation, one third of the
code for each of his three years in
office, in order that the law may be
known and that the legislature may
alter and amend it as needed.
The conflict between pagans and
Christians appears beyond peaceful
settlement and the young republic is
on the brink of religious civil war.
"But at that moment", says one of
the ancient sources, "a man came
running with the message that an
earthfire had broken out in ölfus and
was likely to overrun the farm of
Thóroddur, the Chieftain-Priest."
Those of the heathen party said:
"It is no wonder that the gods are
angered by such words as have been
spoken here." Then Snorri the Chief¬
tain-Priest asked: "What angered the
gods when this rock burned on which
we are now standing?" The heathen
leaders were at a loss for words.
Everyone present knew quite well that
he was standing on ancient lava that
had flowed long before the country
was settled. The Althing of 1000 A.D.
ended by resolving that henceforth
all Icelanders would be Christians.
July 20, 1783. The scene is Kirkju-
baejarklaustur, an ancient estate in the
heart of the district of Sida in south¬
ern Iceland. In the parish church, a
decaying, low-roofed structure of
stone and turf, a service is In progress.
This service is to go down in Icelandic
history as "the Fire-Mass", but the
subject of the preacher's sermon this
Sunday is not the Fire of Hell: he
speaks of the fire in the earth which
for forty days and forty nights had
been harrying the region.
On June 8, a twelve kilometre long
fissure had opened up in the highland
pastures south-west of Vatnajökull
Glacier. The lava flowed down along
the gorge of the Skaftá River and
spread out over the farming districts
of Sida and Medalland. It has been
calculated that during those first forty
days the average flow from the fissure
was twice that of the Rhine at its
mouth.
When the eruption finally came to
an end almost six months later, the
lava flow covered 565 square kilo¬
metres, and by the end of the following
year, seventy-five per cent of the
country's livestock had perished, either
directly from the poisonous effects of
fluorine and other pollutants or because
of the failure of the grass crop
caused by the blue haze, and some
10,000 people, or rather more than a
fifth of the nation, had died of hunger
or disease caused by the eruption.

electric power plant, the largest by far
in the country and one of the greatest
engineering projects ever undertaken
in Iceland, is about to be inaugurated.
During the first centuries after the
colonization of Iceland, this then hos¬
pitable valley sheltered a flourishing
farming community. But in 1104 Hekla
erupted for the first time In the nation's
history, making the larger part of Thjór-
sárdalur so utterly waste that no
resettlement was ever attempted.
Through all these centuries the
upper part of the valley remained a
white desert, covered with light-colour¬
ed rhyolitic pumice. But with the
harnessing of the Thjórsá River, efforts
were made to cover the desert with
grass in order to prevent the drifting of
dust and sand around the powerhouse.
The guests at the dedication cere¬
mony see grassy ground on every
hand, and the President and other
speakers talk of the white desert
having at last taken on again the green
colour of life. Three days later, a rain
of coarse cinders and ash beats down
on the roof of the powerhouse. Hekla
has started again. And when the ash
fall lets up after two hours, the valley
once more ¡s a desert. A black desert,
this time.
These are three incidents in the his¬
tory of country which in spite of its

coldest-sounding name is nevertheless
one of the hottest. For Iceland is one
of the twenty-five or so regions in the
world now referred to by geologists
as "hot-spots". Virtually all of Iceland
has been built up in volcanic eruptions,
and about one third of the country is
an active volcanic region.
The principal zone of activity lies in
a broad belt across the country from
north to south, the southern half form¬
ing two distinct branches. This vol¬
canic region forms part of the system
of rifts and ridges that runs the length
of the Atlantic ocean.
In the volcanic regions of Iceland
nearly every type of volcano found
on the globe is represented, but the
commonest type is the crater row.
It is characteristic of Iceland that
some of the most active and most
vigorous of the country's volcanoes
are covered by eternal ice, so that the
eruptions are accompanied by gigantic
water floods, the so-called jökulhlaup,
or glacier bursts, the heat from the
eruption melting the ice from below
until the water forces its way out from
under the ice cover.
It is thought that volcanic activity
has occurred in about thirty different
locations in Iceland since the country
was settled and that on the average
one eruption takes place every fifth
year.
The main feature of volcanic activity
in Iceland Is that many volcanoes
erupt only once and that in the volcanic
zones a new volcano may come Into
being almost anywhere and at almost
any time. Usually this happens far
from human habitations, but fissures
have been known to open up to spew
their fire practically on people's door¬
steps.
The most recent eruption in a settled
area occurred in the early hours of
January 23, 1973, when a one and a
half kilometre long rift opened up on
Heimaey, the principal island in the
Vestmannaeyjar (Westmann) group,
about 100 metres from the houses on
the southern edge of the most import¬
ant fishing town in the country (see
photos pages 16 to 19).
This eruption lasted for five months.
Where once stood dwelling houses,
there now rises a new mountain, Eldfell,
about 220 metres high, and a third of
this once bustling town, where one
fifth of the nation's total catch of fish
used to be brought ashore, has
disappeared under a thick cover of
cinders and lava.
And how does the Icelandic nation
like living with all this volcanic
activity? How does it feel about its
volcanoes?
Innumerable place-names testify to
the wonder and Interest with which
the settlers regarded vulcanism and
the phenomena associated with it, such
as thermal springs and earthquakes;
after all, they had had no experience
of such things in their former homes.
It is more than likely that the descrip¬
tion of Ragnarök, the final destruction
of the world, in the Eddie poem "The
Sybil's Prophecy" was partly inspired
by a great ash eruption.
The Icelanders soon learned to view
such natural phenomena in a rational
and realistic light. There are few signs
of any superstitious beliefs centering
on volcanoes in Iceland. The idea that
Hell was situated under Mount Hekla
in Iceland never caught on with the
Icelanders.
In accounts of earthquakes and
other natural catastrophes In former
ages, the only feature that smacks
of the legendary is that Invariably one
individual somehow survives: the soul
of the nation refuses to acknowledge
total defeat by the forces of nature.
To be sure, the Icelanders have a |
healthy respect of their volcanoes, and
they have now taken steps to reduce
the damage caused by eruptions,

ICELAND GEOLOGICAL HOT-SPOT. A purely oceanic island with no foundation of continental rock, Iceland
has been almost entirely built up by volcanic action and remains one of the geological "hot-spots" of the
world, with an average of one eruption every five years. The map below (part of a larger map of the Atlantic
ocean floor, reproduced here by special permission of the National Geographic Society, Washington D.C.,

range, itself only part of the Mid-Oceanic Ridge which encircles the entire globe. Key to figures shown on

including a warning system in the
volcanic zone, which proved Its value
during the Eldfell eruption. But they
have also, ever since Romantic writers
first opened men's eyes to the beauties
of nature, regarded their volcanoes
with an admiration that in somes cases
verges on veneration.
What Popocatepetl and Iztaccihuatl
are to the people of Mexico City or
Fuji to the Japanese, Snaefellsjökull
is to the inhabitants of Reykjavik.
While the great eruption of Hekla In
1947 was going on, the principal worry
of some of the people In the neigh¬
bourhood seemed to be that the
shape of the mountain might somehow
be spoiled as a result of the eruption.
But the Icelanders have also learned
to make use on an ever Increasing
scale of the wealth of natural heat that
is one consequence of their country
being a young volcanic one. (See
article page 24.) Ever since settle¬
ment times 1,000 years ago, they have
used the hot springs for washing and
bathing. A famous incident connected
with the conversion to Christianity in
the year 1000 involved the refusal of
the Northerners present at the Althing
to be immersed in the cold water of
Thingvellir; they had to be taken to a
hot spring fifteen miles away before
they would consent to being baptized.
In areas with hot springs it was
formerly the custom to bake bread
by burying the dough in the boiling
hot mud or sand. But It was rrot until
the fourth decade of the present cen¬
tury that the natural heat began to be
harnessed on any considerable scale.
At first it was mainly used for
heating houses, and by now more than
half the nation, including virtually the
entire population of the capital, lives
in houses heated by natural hot water.
Greenhouses heated in the same
fashion supply the population with
flowers and vegetables, and even
grapes and such tropical fruits as
bananas may be found there, although
to tell the truth, their cultivation Is
of rather greater significance for the
tourist brochures than for the national
economy. The great majority of people
can go for a healthful swim the year
around in outdoor pools heated with
water from hot springs.
In addition, the natural heat repre¬
sents an enormous untapped source of
energy which in the future may be
expected to provide a basis for further
industrial development.
It is safe to claim that in spite of
severe blows from eruptions and earth¬
quakes every now and then, the vol¬
canic character of Iceland makes It a
better country to live In than it would
otherwise be.
During the recent eruption in
Vestmannaeyjar, it became evident
once more that living with the forces
of Icelandic nature has ingrained into
the nation an attitude of stoic
composure, grounded in the knowledge
that such things are no more than
what one must always expect on the
fiery Atlantic island where this small
nation has, after all, held out for eleven
hundred years.

wildfire over islands and coasts, and
founding independent Viking states in
Scotland, Ireland and England in the
west, in France in the south, in Russia
in the east.
Though some of their states, such
as Normandy in France and Holmgard,
the old Norse name for the city-state
of Novgorod in Russia, became power¬
ful, the small ruling element was gra¬
dually absorbed by the native mass,
losing both language and national iden¬
tity. The only places where this did
not happen were previously uninhabit¬
ed lands occupied by the Vikings. Ice¬
land was the only permanent state
founded by the Vikings during this
period.
Ari Thorgilsson the Learned (1067-
1148) the first Icelandic author, who
wrote a brief history of Iceland
Islendingabók (The Book of the Ice¬
landers) says that the first settler
made his home there "a few years"
after 870 while another ancient source
tells us that this happened in 874.
Thousands of settlers crossed the
stormy seas in open vessels; men
with their wives and children and other
kinsfolk, housecarls (bodyguards of
kings and nobles) and thralls (serfs).
With them they took clothes and pro¬
visions, utensils and domestic equip¬
ment as well as animals.
During the Age of Settlement (9th
to 10th century) the climate of Ice-

land must have been relatively mild.
There was an abundance of fish in
the rivers and lakes and coastal waters
of the island. The lowlands were
covered with rich pasture and birch-
woods that reached high up the slopes
of the mountains.
Some of the newcomers described
the new country as a fishing-station,
while one declared that every blade
of grass dripped butter. However, it
was soon found that there were two
sides to the picture and the Icelandic
weather could be unaccountable.
One of the earliest would-be settlers
lost all his livestock in the rigours of
the first winter, and went back to his
homeland. Before leaving he climbed
a high mountain and saw a fjord filled
with drift-ice, whereupon he gave the
country Its chilly name.
From the start the people. that settled
the new land had a distinctive culture
and customs of their own. This may
be due to the particular sample of
Norwegians that migrated there, and
especially to the slight admixture of
Celtic stock among the settlers from
the Celtic parts of the British Isles,
including the islands of the Hebrides,
Orkneys and Shetlands. Many of the
thralls who later mixed with the free-
born immigrants were also of Celtic
origin.
Towards the close of the Age of
Settlement, about the year 930, the
Icelanders combined to establish a
common state and general assembly
the Althing for their land. The coun¬
try was divided Into four Ouarters, and
each of these into nine godord, or
chieftaincies, except the Northern
Quarter, In which there were twelve.
The chieftains in charge of the
heathen sacrifical rites were called
godar, and these were also the leaders
of this miniature state. In early spring
a district assembly would be held in
the territory of every three chief¬
taincies.
Though the Icelandic laws were
based on the Norwegian ones of the
settlers' native districts, these were
considerably supplemented and amend¬
ed. They are preserved complete in
two vellum books dating from about
the time when the Icelandic national
state came to an end in the latter part
of the 13th century.
At the Althing, as might be sup¬
posed, the godar were supreme. They
were self-appointed members of the
legislature (logrétta), the court that
amended old laws, drafted new ones
and gave judgement on points of law.
To ensure its efficient and impartial
operation, however, every godi had
two advisers, one sitting behind him
and one before.
The judicial courts of the Althing
were four in number, one for each
Quarter. The godar nominated a man
each in every Quarter Court, thus
giving them effective control, though
the interests of parties to a dispute
were safeguarded by their right to
object to any member of the court on
grounds of unsuitability for his office.
Many features of the Icelandic Con¬
stitution were unique, beside being
more democratic than in neighbouring
lands. There was no king to oppress
his subjects with tyrannical commands.
The power was equally divided
between thirty-nine farmer-chieftains,
among whose tasks was the duty of
protecting the interests of their own
people, each In his own district.
The legislative and judicial powers
were completely separate and allotted
to Independent bodies. In criminal
cases juries were very much used as
evidence of character, the members
giving their verdict according to con¬
science. At a fairly early date a Fifth
Court was introduced as a kind of
supreme court of appeal for the whole
country.
In the early centuries after the
settlement the inhabitants possessed
a large and effective fleet of ships,
and the wanderlust that had driven
their forefathers to Iceland was still
in their blood. From here they voyaged
further westwards in search of new
lands. Eirik the Red, a man from the
west of Iceland, discovered a large
country which he named Greenland
"and said that it would urge men to
go there, that the land had a good
name", observes Ari the Learned.
During the next few years many
emigrated from Iceland to Greenland,
establishing there a settlement that
flourished at the start. From Green¬
land It was not far to the North Am¬
erican continent, and the sea-dogs of
Greenland soon had a glimpse of yet
other lands to the southwest.

Leif the Lucky, son of Eirik the
Red, set out to find these lands
about the year 1000, discovering
three, to which he gave the names
Helluland ("flagstone-land"), Markland
("forest-land") and Vinland ("wine-
land"). Helluland and Markland were
probably Baffinland and the Labrador
peninsula. Vinland could have been
Newfoundland, on whose northern¬
most promontory very ancient Norse
remains have recently been dis¬

The birth of an original
form of literature
HE history of Iceland's
rich and varied literature dates back
over 1,000 years. At the earliest pe¬
riod, the Icelanders had no written
literature, but in poem and story they
preserved memories of times long
past, of notable events not only in
their own country but also among
their neighbours, their sister nations
across the sea, especially Norway,
Sweden and Denmark, from whence
their forefathers had come.

This natural amphitheatre, at Thingvellir, was
the cradle of Europe's oldest parliament, the
Althing, whose first meeting in 930 A.D. mark¬
ed the birth of the Icelandic state. Meetings
were held each summer in the open air.
Today the Althing meets a 19th-century build¬
ing in Reykjavik. Old traditions persist and
at an annual banquet it is customary for
members of parliament to make their speeches
in verse. Below, a cavalcade crosses the
Thingvellir plain. Top of page, 16th century

In this they were not unique: settlers
In a new land often seem to have a
memory more retentive of ancient lore
than that of those who remain behind.
The stories of Norse gods and heroes
are now a familiar part of the European
heritage of myth and legend, but It is
not always realized that knowledge of
them derives chiefly from Icelandic
manuscripts.
The settlement of Iceland itself about
870 A.D. was itself a tremendous event,
bound to leave its imprint on the na¬
tion's memory and give birth to stories
and tales. In the Settlement Age the
Icelanders had no books, and between
the founding of the Icelandic state in
930 and the beginning of the Age of
Writing towards the end of the 11th
century just the right length of time
passed for the tales of ancient heroes
to mature in oral tradition.
The history of Old Icelandic litera¬
ture may be roughly divided into three
periods. First there is the period of
oral literature, lasting from settlement
times until about 1100. At this time
poems and occasional verses were
composed on a great variety of sub¬
jects and memorized and handed down
from generation to generation.

THE ICELAND SAGA (Continued)
In the same way memories of men
and events as far back as the Settle¬
ment Age or even earlier times were
kept alive, and tales of ancient worthies
were told for instruction or entertain¬
ment. This period may thus be called
the Age of Tradition.
The first works written in the Ice¬
landic language were produced to¬
wards the end of the 11th century. On
the one hand we find translations from
Latin of religious writings saints'
lives, homilies, etc. and on the other,
historical and other learned works
law books, genealogies, and concise
histories, with Ari the Learned's Book
of the Icelanders as the outstanding
example. The 12th century can there¬
fore rightly be termed the Age of
Learning.
In the course of time Icelandic his¬
torical writing underwent a remarkable
development which led to the creation
of a rich and varied narrative literature.
In other languages the Icelandic word
saga has been adopted to describe
this literature. The earliest preserved
sagas date from the end of the 12th
century, and the most recent were
probably composed around 1400. The
third and last period of Old Icelandic
literature, from c. 1200 to c. 1400, can
thus be called the Age of Sagas.
After this time no original prose lite¬
rature to speak of was produced until
the latter half of he 16th century, by
which time the Reformation had paved
the way for new kinds of literature in
the Icelandic language.
When we speak of the first period
(Age of Tradition), it is customary to
distinguish two kinds of Old Icelandic
poetry: Eddie poems and Scaldic (or
Court) poems. Both forms of poetry
have their roots in Scandinavia or, in
the case of the Eddie poems, even
farther south. The oldest poems were
composed in Norway, but the bulk are
Icelandic, and they have been pre¬
served only in Iceland.
The earliest Icelandic poetry is
closely bound up with pagan beliefs.
Many of the ancient poems deal di¬
rectly with the old gods, while poetry
itself is the gift of Odin and its lan¬
guage derived from pagan religion and
the legends of the gods. One word
has become a kind of common denomi¬
nator for these religious beliefs and
poetry the name Edda, which means
great-grandmother.
To explain the art of poetry or teach
would-be poets how to compose could
not be done without giving an account
of the old beliefs and telling the stories
of the gods on which the poetic voca¬
bulary was based.
According to the old Norse beliefs,
the gods live In Asgard as a large
family, though each individual has his
specific dwelling. Their chief is Odin,
god of poetry, runes and magic. To
Valholl, his abode, go all men who
have died in battle.
Many of the principal gods are sons
of Odin. Of these the most popular is
Thor, who is also the biggest and
strongest. He batters the giants with
his hammer Mjolnir ("the crusher"),
which becomes the sacred symbol of
pagans.
Tyr is the god of war. He is one-
handed, having lost a hand which he
had placed as a pledge in the jaws of
the wolf Fenrir. Heimdall is the sen¬
tinel of the gods. He sees as well
by night as by day and can hear the
grass and the wool of sheep growing.
Baldur is the best of all the gods.
"He is so fair of countenance and so
bright that he shines." But Loki,
crafty and the scandalmonger of the
gods, brings about the death of Bal¬
dur, who then descends to the abode
of Hel to share a miserable existence
with those who die of disease and
old age.
Njord, the god of navigation, belongs
to another race called Vanir. His
children are Frey and Freyja, deities
of love and fertility who enjoyed an
extensive cult throughout Scandinavia.
The gods are at perpetual war with
their enemies the giants who live in
the rocks and caves of Jotunheim.
With them are associated various
monsters such as the wolf Fenrir,
whom the gods bound, and Midgard-
sorm, the World Serpent, that lies
encircling the earth with its tail in its
mouth.
But the Icelanders also composed

<![CDATA[
poetry of another kind, the so-called
Scaldic of Court Poetry that Is dif¬
ferent from Eddie poetry in form and
content. This kind of poetry originated
in Scandinavia and reached its matur¬
ity in Iceland. Scaldic poetry is cha¬
racterized by a highly elaborate and
artificial form, requiring the use of a
special poetic diction and complicated
syntax and word order.
When young Icelandic poets went
abroad, they would make their way
to some royal court, where they recited
a poem of praise before the king,
eulogizing his noteworthy deeds, and
were rewarded with wealth and hon¬
ours. But poets would also impro¬
vise verses on all kinds of everyday
occasions. Battles were a favourite
subject, but the poets also sang the
praises of fair maidens and the sad¬
ness of unrequited love.
In the year 1000 Christianity was
adopted by the Althing, the Icelandic
Parliament, as the national religion, and
with it the literary culture of Europe
came to Iceland. But because of the
unique political structure of the Ice¬
landic state, literature developed along
other lines than it did in Europe. In
pagan times secular chieftains had
also been the religious heads of the
community, and this situation inevi¬
tably remained unchanged after the
coming of Christianity.
During the first centuries of Chris¬
tianity the church was therefore sub¬
ject to the secular power and was
not a state within the state as in most
other countries. The result was a two¬
fold gain for Icelandic culture: the
Church became national in character,
and members of the ruling class
devoted themselves to book-learning.
Thus in Iceland learned men had
both feet firmly planted in the secular
world and had a taste for national
lore, ancient poems and traditional
tales, and consequently the art of
writing was taken into the service of
the national culture. Icelandic writers,
almost without exception, wrote not in
Latin but in their native tongue. Reli¬
gious works were translated Into or
composed in Icelandic, as were
works on other branches of foreign
learning.
The Icelanders were subject to no
earthly king, but after they had become
Christians, they began to direct their
panegyrics on high, using scaldic me¬
tres for sacred poems in praise of the
saints of Christianity.
A great many works pertaining to
the Age of Learning (1100- 1200) have
been irretrievably lost, but the remain¬
ing sources testify to the fact that
writers of the time were composing
many Icelandic historical and other
learned works.
Shortly before the middle of the
12th century an unknown grammarian
set out to devise an alphabet for the
Icelanders. The work of this gram¬
marian, the so-called First Grammatical
Treatise, is thus our authority on the
first things to be written in Icelandic.
This treatise is an outstanding work of
linguistic scholarship, an invaluable
source of information about the Ice¬
landic language at the time it was
being reduced to writing.
The first known records in the Ice¬
landic tongue were the laws of the
Commonwealth. These were preserv¬
ed only in men's memories during the
first centuries of its existence, and a
special official, the Law Speaker, was
charged with the duty of reciting them
in public at the Althing. It was thus
a great step forward when the code
was put in writing about 1100, so that
all could know what In fact was the
law of the land.
The rudiments of native sagas may
already be detected in the works of
learning of the 12th century, such as
the Book of the Icelanders In which
Ari the Learned sketches a dramatic
picture of the adoption of Christianity
at the Althing in the year 1000. (see
article page 4).
Ari the Learned also had a hand In
making of the Landnámabók (The
Book of Settlements), in which all the
principal settlers of Iceland are enu¬
merated, their original homes and their
places of settlement given, and their
ancestors and descendants recorded.
No other nation in the world possesses
such a record of its origin. '
With the approach of the Age of
Sagas (1200-1400), learning no longer

Illuminated manuscripts with scenes from everyday life
Before the spread of printing, many illuminated
manuscripts were produced in Iceland, especially
during the 14th and 15th centuries. There were many
scribes, not only in church and monastery but also in
the lay world. Calfskin parchment and ink made from
plants were in plentiful supply. Some manuscripts
were the size of half a calfskin while others were no
more than matchbox size. The oldest extant manuscript
dates from the beginning of the 12th century when the
Latin alphabet was adopted. On these two pages we
present details from a 16th century copy of the Jónsbók,
the law code of king Magnus "the law-mender"
(14th century). Opposite, ladies in festive garb attired

new copies were made, so few of the earliest remain

THE ICELAND SAGA (Continued)
Tales of gods and heroes, chivalry and romance
14
enjoyed the same pre-eminence as
before. The scholarly writing of his¬
tory declined as the artistic exploi¬
tation of history developed.
There can be no doubt that one of
the main sources of the sagas are
oral accounts of men and events,
sometimes from the remote past. The
style and diction of the written sagas
bear the artistic imprint of oral nar¬
rative. Yet the sagas are very far
from being a mere copying.
The saga is a prose story whose
narrative is swift-moving and concise,
free from verbal embellishments and
verbosity. The dialogue Is terse, and
the characters often express them¬
selves in pointed epigrams. The cast
of characters is large and varied, and
the individual traits of each character
are drawn in clear strokes. While
minor characters may typify particular
human qualities, the main characters
are often complicated and even enig¬
matic. Great emphasis is placed on
certain moral commands, ideals, and
duties, many of which are of great
antiquity.
The highest ideal is drengskapur, a
term which embraces most of the ad¬
mired virtues: truthfulness, good faith,
sincerity, frankness, humanity, magna¬
nimity, and, above all, the courage to
defend honour and family, flinching at
neither wounds nor death.
The circle of kinsmen is a power¬
ful defensive bulwark, but the ties of
kinship can also become strong fet¬
ters to draw men into blood feud and
vengeance, in defiance of the precepts
equally of pagan law and Christian
doctrine.
HE Kings' Sagas were the
first completely original Icelandic
sagas to be written. They derive their
name from the fact that the principal
characters are kings or earls of
northern lands.
Greatest of all the writers of Kings'
Sagas was a poet and scholar Snorri
Sturluson (1178-1241). His monu¬
mental Heimskringla is a comprehen¬
sive history of Norwegian kings from
the twilight times of myth down to
his own day. Each king is given his
own saga in chronological order, but
more space than to any of the rest Is
devoted to the saga of King Olafur
Haraldsson the Saint.
In the wake of the Kings' Sagas
follow other kinds of sagas, each with
its own definite characteristics. The
Sagas of Icelanders are the most ori¬
ginal and remarkable and deal with
events of the 10th and 11th centuries.
They tell mostly of quarrels and con¬
flicts, of killings and blood feuds.
Although the Icelandic Common¬
wealth was in many ways a well orga¬
nized state with an extensive system
of law, a central authority was totally
lacking. As a result, unruly and violent
individuals were free to settle their
differences by force of arms. Such
conflicts would naturally be recognized
as fitting themes for a story and be
preserved in memory more readily
than the peaceful dealings of law-
abiding members of the community.
Many of these short stories are min¬
iature masterpieces, such as the story
of Audun of the West Fjords, who
presented the King of Denmark with
the gift of a polar bear and was
royally rewarded but in the end re¬
served his deepest gratitude for the
King of Norway, who in time of war
had let him pass In peace with a gift
intended for the enemy king.
As time goes by, the Sagas of Ice¬
landers undergo great changes. The
distance between the events and the
authors grows and as a result the oral
tradition becomes attenuated, and the
saga as a literary form begins to lead
a life of its own.
New trends from abroad influence
development: the French tales of chiv¬
alry are translated into the old Norse
tongue and leave their mark on Ice¬
landic literature.
The novelty in the Saga of Laxdaela,
for example, Is due to the influence
of the translated romances. From
them are derived the beauty and
"courtesy" of the characters, the
splendour and elegance of their dress,
and the sentimental quality of their
love.
Kjartan Olafsson is "the handsomest
man ever born in Iceland", his hair is
"fine as silk and hangs down In curls".
His wife dies of sorrow when she
learns he has been slain.
The current of southern romanticism
continues to flow through the Sagas
of Icelanders side by side with the
ancient Icelandic one. Gradually the
oral sources from the Heroic Age dry
up, but in their place the authors dip
deeply into the wells of literature.
Fantasy and romanticism flourish and
sagas with little or no basis in tradi¬
tion are written in Imitation of older
works. This is the literature of deca¬
dence of the 14th century.
The decline is partly accounted for
by the fact that the Icelanders had
lost their independence and become
subject to the king of Norway shortly
after the middle of the thirteenth cen¬
tury. Finally the creative impulse is
exhausted, and saga writing comes to
an end around 1400.
N the watershed between
classical saga and extravagant adven¬
ture tales stands Njála, the greatest
and most famous of all sagas, written
shortly before 1300.
Its author had at his disposal some
historical sources, oral and written, on
the persons and events of the saga,
but he also helped himself liberally
from literature, picking up whatever
served his purpose, reshaping it and
providing it with a new context to suit
his story. His cast of characters is
enormous, and the connexion between
individual chapters is often of the
most tenuous kind.
Gunnar of Hlidarendi is a romantic
knight, a splendid figure of chivalry,
who can jump his own height in full
armour, but his violent temper and his
self-will serve to make him human.
When he learns that his wife Hallger-
dur is guilty of theft, he strikes her in
the face. Essentially a man of peace,
Gunnar is repeatedly drawn into hosti¬
lities and feuds, but the author's sym¬
pathies always remain with him.
Hallgerdur, on the other hand, is
the character for whom the author
seems to have the greatest aversion.
When Gunnar is fighting his last battle,
she remembers the blow he struck her
and refuses to give him a strand of
her hair to replace his broken bow¬
string.
No Icelandic saga has achieved such
popularity as Njála. It captures a
child's imagination with its simplicity
and its boldly pencilled outlines, but
in later years an adult can return to it
again and again and always find new
strokes of creative genius, new depths
of wisdom. Booklovers in Iceland
have long thought it right to read Njála
once a year. And there are old men
who still maintain, maybe with more
than a modicum of truth, that in it are
to be found answers to all the prob¬
lems of human life.
The Icelandic sagas and Eddie
poems are a notable chapter In the
history of world culture, and the
manuscripts that preserve them are
the most treasured literary heritage of
the Icelandic people.

_*N the northern edge of
Vatnajökull there is "a huge mountain
area, Kverkfjöll, cut across by a great
chasm with a narrow outlet glacier
which separates it into eastern and
western parts. Kverkfjöll has 1,800
metre high mountain ridges, and its
tallest peak rises to 1,920 metres.
The Kverkfjöll group of mountains
is volcanic and doubtless the western
Kverkfjöll is still an active volcano.
Here is one of the largest thermal
areas in Iceland with big steam and
hot water springs and boiling mud
pots, mainly in or close to a cleft
valley called the Hveradalur.
This hot spring valley is in itself
one of the most remarkable natural
phenomena in Iceland. It is com¬
pletely covered with hot springs of
different types and sizes, steam
springs and mud pots, and the slopes
on both sides are also boiling to some
extent.
At the south-west end of the valley
there is a glacier-dammed lake some¬
times covered by ice, but also some¬
times studded with icebergs that have
broken off the glacier above. There
seem to be hot water outlets at the
bottom of the lake, but hot water also
runs from the springs on the slopes.
The hot springs even extend south¬
wards and eastwards underneath the
glacier ice where high columns of
steam ascend through melted holes
in the firn (granular ice).
To the east of the lake, there are
tuff (porous volcanic stone) hills with
countless boiling springs, while at the

conferences on safety at sea, prevention of
oil pollution, etc. Well known for his pho¬
tographs which have earned him many inter¬
national prizes, he is also the author of a
number of books Including "Ice and Fire",
published In Reykjavik in 1971 and from
which this article Is condensed (see Book¬
shelf page 36).
north-east end of the lake there are
some blue boiling mud pots, sulphu¬
rous hot springs, most of them seeth¬
ing with a mass of bubbles. From
the end of the lake the valley slopes
gently up towards a thin ridge across
the valley, almost closing it, with small
peaks on both sides.
North-east of this ridge the valley
is completely different in character,
now getting V-shaped and much deep¬
er like a cleft, but opening out further
north. The west side of the valley is
very steep here, and the colours are
extremely rich and varied, even for
colourful Iceland. The hot springs
are close to each other, covering the
whole slope down to the bottom of
the valley. The whole area, thick-set
with steam jets, seems to be on the
boil.
Few places in Iceland convey the
feeling of contrast between ice and
fire as powerfully as this area,
although several others have frost
and fire locked in constant combat,
and the colours here are beyond
description.
There are not many places more
remote than Kverkfjöll. From the
north one has to travel a long way
over lava, sandur-plains and glacial
rivers, and from the south the biggest
ice cap in the country has to be
crossed to reach it. But that is the
easiest way if one travels by snow¬
mobile.
Most famous of the Icelandic spout¬
ing hot springs is Geysir (in Hauka-
dalur), which has given its name to
all similar hot springs in the world.
Geysir spouts very seldom now, but
nearby there are several boiling hot
water springs, some of which erupt
regularly such as the one called
Strokkur.
The bowl of Geysir is 18 m. wide
and 1.3 m. deep, and it is situated
in the top of a low mound, built up
of layers of siliceous deposits from
the spring water. From the bottom
of the bowl there is a vertical tube
which is about 20 m. deep and 3 m.
wide at the top, but it narrows as it
goes down. It is believed that Geysir
and Strokkur were both formed in a
great earthquake in 1294.
We are told in the Oddaverja Annual
that "...at Haukadalur two big hot
water springs came into existence,
whereas others which had been there
before disappeared." Research based
on the time needed to build up the
siliceous sinter mound, and dated vol¬
canic ash layers in the soil below it
supports this dating.
After 1800 Geysir is often mention¬
ed in foreign books on travel in Ice¬
land, but around 1900 Geysir eruptions
decreased in number, and in 1916
they stopped completely. In 1935 the
eruptions started again after the

ISLAND BORN IN FIRE.
Surtur, the Norse god, is
said to have come from
the south with fire and
thunder. He did so again
on November 14, 1963
when the island of Surtsey
was formed by a submarine
eruption in the coastal
waters of southern Iceland.
Four months later Surtsey
was more than 1 sq. km. in
area, but its survival as
an island was only ensured
the day this photo was
taken, on April 4, 1964.
On that date sea water no
longer found its way to
the molten magma in the
crater, and flows of lava
began to form an island.
Today the surface is cold
enough for snow to stay
on the ground.

LAND OF ICE AND FIRE
(Continued from page 16)
water level in the bowl had been
lowered, thus reducing the cooling
effect of the water surface.
The Geysir eruptions were then and
later studied by Dr. Trausti Einarsson,
who explains them as follows: "Into
the vertical channel of Geysir the
water enters at a temperature of
125° C., through smaller passages
coming from greater depths.
"At the bottom of the main tube
the boiling point is about 132° C.
when the water is standing high in
the bowl, and therefore the water
does not boil at the bottom. At a
depth of 10 m. in the pipe the boiling
point is about 120° C., and there the
temperature sometimes reaches that
level and even higher, and boiling of
the water there generates an eruption."
It is not sufficient, however, for the
water to reach a boiling point to start
an eruption. The water has to be
overheated by 4 to 5 °C. above the boil¬
ing point. The boiling then generates
a sudden explosion, and the water
above is thrown into the air.
The explosive boiling produces the
well known rumbling noise just before
the starting of an eruption, which is
really the result of a long chain of
explosions in the water. In powerful
Geysir eruptions the water column
can reach a height of 40 to 60 m. and
it may continue for about 10 minutes.
Towards the end a. steam column
emerges from the nearly empty tube.
Strokkur is of a similar type and is
situated on the same fissure as Geysir,
but it is much smaller.
The highest temperature recorded in
Iceland is 280 °C. at a depth of about
1,200 m. in a drill-hole at Námaskard,
but the deepest hole drilled so far is
in Reykjavik, 2,200 m. deep with a
temperature of 146°C.

[ CELAND'S glaciers with
their snow-white caps against the
blue sky have always been acclaimed
for their majestic beauty and extolled
in many a poem. The Icelandic nation
has certainly got to know their many
different aspects during eleven cen¬
turies of cohabitation.
It even appears that the Icelanders
were in fact the first to understand the
development and nature of glaciers.
If the material written about glaciers
in Icelandic had been published in a
world language, some of the findings
based on the studies of local farmers
would have been considered a remark¬
able contribution to the glaciology of
the time.
There is no doubt that some of the
settlers from Norway were familiar
with the glaciers in their homeland;
and in Iceland some made their new
homes very close to glaciers. In
many places routes between farms
ran along the edges of glaciers or even
across them.
As is well known, a glacier is a
mass of ice, covering mountains or
valleys all the year round, the ice
being formed naturally from compact¬
ed snow. It is evident that a glacier
will be formed only if more snow falls
during winter than is melted away
during the summer.
It has been calculated that glaciers
cover 11,800 sq. km., or about 11.5 per
cent of the area of Iceland. Icelandic
glaciers vary in size from the biggest,
the Vatnajökull ice plateau which
covers about 8,400 sq. km., to minor
glaciers of less than 30 sq. km. In
area.
Why do glaciers not grow higher
each year since a 4 to 8 metre thick
snow layer may be added on to. the
ice cap in a single year? As Sveinn
Pálsson discovered and explained
quite correctly in the 18th century, the
reason is that although ice is hard and
fragile, it has considerable plasticity
like pitch.
Glaciers have their discharge like
most lakes. Glacier ice is softer
than a layer of sea ice, and therefore
glacier ice moves slowly under the
pressure of its own ice caps from the
mountains down valleys where the
temperature is higher and melting is
more rapid than in the highlands.
Air temperature falls by about 0.5 to
0.7 °C. on the average for every
100 metres we go up in altitude above
sea level. Hence, there is often a
snowfall in the mountains when it is
raining in the lowlands. Each area
has an equilibrium at a certain altitude
above sea level. Above that altitude
snow will accumulate year after year
forming a glacier, but below that same
altitude the winter snow will melt
away during summer.
An ice cap, therefore, does not
increase its height if the climate
remains constant, even though more
snow is accumulated there every year
than the warm season can melt away.
Further down the ice cap is drained by
broad lobe-shaped outlets or by valley
glaciers. Here more and more of the
ice is melted and at the glacier's front
the movement and the melting is
balanced.
This equilibrium, however, can be'
disturbed. If some years of unusually
heavy snowfall are followed by cold
summers, an outlet glacier may
advance further down the valley or on
to the lowlands before an equilibrium
is reached again. Conversely, the
snout of a glacier outlet will retreat if
several years of relatively light snow¬
fall are followed by warm summers,
and that has' been the case of Icelandic
outlet glaciers during the last few
decades.
When outlet glaciers retreat, as they
have been doing in Iceland for the
last 40 to 50 years, they considerably
transform the surrounding landscape.
Big pieces of ice may remain for some
time buried in clay and sand where the
glacier has withdrawn, and walking
may be difficult in knee-deep mud on
the top of a layer of dead ice, prevent¬
ing the water from getting away.
But vegetation reaches this new
area surprisingly quickly, even if there
is still ice underneath. In midsummer
the vegetation is often so soggy that
a man walking in it penetrates to the
ice layer.

CHEAP CITY HEATING
FROM NATURAL
HOT SPRINGS

HE use of geothermal
energy for large-scale heating of
houses was pioneered in Iceland, which
is natural since it has a climate
requiring the heating of houses for
330 to 340 days a year. No fossil
fuel sources are available except
limited reserves of peat and lignite.
But there are a multitude of hot springs
and a number of major geothermal
steam fields.
The first attempts at heating single
farmhouses were made in the begin¬
ning of the 20th century. Around 1925
hot spring water was used In the first
hothouses for vegetables.
A major step forward was made
when the first boreholes for hot water

Energy", published by Unesco In 1973.
were drilled in the vicinity of Reykjavik,
in 1928, yielding 14 litres per second
of 87 °C. hot water. A 3 km. long
pipeline to the city was constructed,
feeding a pilot district heating scheme
comprising 70 houses, an enclosed
swimming pool, an open-air swimming
pool and a school.
This venture was quite successful,
and as a consequence more extensive
drilling for hot water was started in
1933 at the Reykir thermal spring area
some 18 km. outside the city. This
yielded about 200 litres per second of
86 °C. hot water, and in the years 1939
to 1943 a new district heating system
was constructed, serving 2,300 houses
with about 30.000 people and public
buildings of the town.
The system included an 18 km. long
transmission pipeline, pumping stations,
8,000 cubic metre water storage tanks
and an underground distribution net¬
work in the streets of the town. This
system was commissioned on Decem
ber 1, 1943 and Is still operating quite
satisfactorily.
An extension of the system was built
in 1949-50. A total of 72 boreholes
were drilled producing a total of
330 litres per second of 86 "C. water.
The boreholes vary in depth from about
300 m. to 770 m.
The Reykir fields have now been
producing continuously for about
35 years, and the total production over
this period is of the order of 300 mil¬
lion cubic metres of water without
any drop in temperature or decrease
of the production rate.
A survey of the area within the
limits of the city of Reykjavik de¬
lineated a thermal area where deep
drilling (700 to 2,200 m.) was started
in 1958. The steady yield of this field
is now 300 litres per second of 128"C.
water, and more recently another
thermal area has been discovered and
developed on the eastern periphery of
the city.

Iceland is endowed with a natural hot water system which
provides heating for over 40 per cent of the population.
Hot springs abound in this land of volcanoes, the most
famous of them being the Geysir which has given its name
to similar hot springs throughout the world (see also page
16). Geysir spouts very seldom nowadays but even at
rest it gives off a thick cloud of steam (below). The
nearby Strokkur (butter-churn) spouts fairly regularly and
photos left show three phases, from left to right: the
boiling water bubbles up, pressure increases till the bubble
bursts, and finally a jet of water and steam is thrown
high in the air.

The district heating system has been
greatly expanded on the basis of these
new thermal sources and 8,700 houses
with 72,000 inhabitants were connected
to the system by the end of 1969.
This represents about 87 per .cent of
the houses in the city, and the goal of
connecting new residential quarters to
the heating system as soon as they are
b'jilt is nearing realization.
The city of Reykjavik has developed,
owned and operated the system from
the very beginning. It has been
highly successful technically and
economically and Is perhaps more
highly regarded by the inhabitants than
any other public service. This has
contributed to the general concept in
Iceland that, where thermal resources
are available, a district heating system
is a necessary and normal public
service, just as much as a cold water
supply, an electricity supply or a sewer
system.
The town of Olafsfjördur in northern
Iceland, with 1,000 Inhabitants, built its
first district heating system in 1944
using hot water of only 48 °C. produced
by drilling in a thermal area about
3 km. away. Deep drilling in 1961
yielded additional water at 56 °C. The
system comprises all the houses of
the town, and it has been quite
successful.
The town of Selfoss (2,200 in¬
habitants) In southern Iceland has a
district heating system which was built
in 1948. It heats the whole town
comprising 154,000 cubic metres of
flats and 75,000 cubic metres of public,
commercial or industrial buildings.
The village of Hveragerdi in southern
Iceland with 820 inhabitants and thera¬
peutic baths capable of handling 140
patients, is one of the main hothouse
centres for growing flowers and
vegetables. A district heating system
serving all houses in the village and
supplying heat to 30,000 square metres
of hothouses has^feesttein operation
since 1953. This is the only district
heating system in Iceland that uses a
high temperature field (180°C.).
Since about 1930 elementary and
secondary boarding schools in the
rural areas of Iceland have whenever
possible been sited at locations where
geothermal energy is available. In
these centres the school buildings and
living quarters for the pupils and staff
are geothermally heated. They are also
as a rule equipped with a swimming
pool, and are self-supplying with
vegetables (tomatoes, cucumbers, cau¬
liflowers, etc.) grown in their own
hothouses.
There are now many such schools
in various parts of the country, and
quite often they are used as tourist
hotels during the summer holidays.
At the end of 1969 a total of almost
80,000 people, or about 40 per cent of
the population of Iceland (204,930),
were living in houses heated with geo¬
thermal energy.

<![CDATA[
i^hVER since the earliest
settlers came from Norway in the late
9th century, the history of Iceland and
the life of the Icelandic nation have
been closely linked to the sea, to its
bounty and to Its caprices.
The climate of Iceland is a cold
temperate one, but considering the
country's geographic position, very
mild, especially in winter. The country
lies on the boundary between warm
and cold currents, both in the air and
in the sea.
The chief characteristic of the cli¬
mate is a sudden alternation between
cold winds from the north and warm
air currents from the Atlantic. Warm
and moist air currents cause thaws
in the winter and wet and cool
weather in the summer, sometimes
for weeks on end. If winds blow from
Greenland, the result may be lengthy
periods of frost in the winter, especially
in the north.
Iceland lies at the confluence of
dissimilar ocean currents (warm Atlan¬
tic waves carried by a branch of the
Gulf Stream and cold water originating
in the so-called East Icelandic current)
and this, too, greatly affects the
climate.
For a succinct characterization of the
oceanography of Iceland, one can
hardly improve upon the Icelandic poet
who described the country as being:
On one side embraced by a warming
[flood,
By the sea-ice harshly grasped on the
[other.
As a result, there is a considerable
difference in the temperature of the
sea off different parts of the country.
In coastal waters in the north and east
the temperature of the sea ranges
from 1 to 2° C. during the coldest
winter months and from 8 to 9° C.
in the summer. Off the south coast it
is close to 11° C. In the summer and
rarely goes below 6° C. in the winter.
Considering the latitude, these
temperatures are very high, especially
the winter temperature. The ocean is
thus the great heat reservoir which
tempers the climate of the country
and makes it habitable in spite of
high latitude, gales and drift Ice.
Three factors determine the climate
of Iceland: the country's position on
the borderline between warm and cold
air currents, the influence of different
ocean currents, and the extent of the
drift ice.
Due to extensive vertical mixing of
sea waters, especially rapid in the
boundary zone between the warm and
the cold ocean currents, the sea
around Iceland is constantly replen
ished with nutrients creating highly
favourable conditions for the vegeta¬
tion that is the basis of life in the
ocean. As a result, biological condi¬
tions on the continental shelf off
Iceland make It one of the richest
spawning and nursery grounds for
commercially important species of fish
in the whole North Atlantic.
Considerable climatic changes have
taken place in the Northern Hemi¬
sphere in past centuries. It is believed
that in Iceland's early Settlement Age
the Far North enjoyed a relatively mild
climate, and at that time Iceland had
some forests, which have since mostly
disappeared. It seems probable that
the favourable climate of this period
facilitated the settlement of Greenland.
In more recent centuries we have
records of cold periods often lasting
for years or even decades. Thus there
were great ice years and exceptionally
cold weather in Iceland from 1686 to
1704. Severe frosts and drift ice made
it very difficult for the fishermen to go
out, and at the same time the fishing
was extremely poor in many places.
In the 20th century the Far North
has undergone the greatest climatic
changes in its recorded history, con¬
sisting chiefly in a rise in the tempera¬
ture of air and sea and a reduction
in the amount of drift ice. The effects

ICELANDERS AND THE SEA (Continued)
Fishing accounts for 80 per cent of exports
28
of these changes have been very
noticeable In Iceland. The rise in tem¬
perature was particularly rapid In the
1920s, but the peak seems to have
been reached between 1930 and 1940.
These changes in the climate were
accompanied by changes in the marine
fauna around Iceland, Including a wider
distribution of more southerly species
and an increase in the number of
spawning grounds for commercially
important species, especially cod.
But during the last decade the cli¬
mate began to grow colder again: in
particular 1968 and 1969 were cold
years. This most recent change in the
climate has again affected the distri¬
bution of fish species around Iceland,
especially herring, whose feeding
migrations have moved farther east
and finally, in the last few years, north
to the Spitzbergen region. As a result,
no herring has been caught off the
north coast of Iceland since 1968.
HE ships of the settlers
were too small to carry livestock in
large numbers along with people and
household goods, and the settlers'
herds of sheep and cattle were there¬
fore bound to be very small. So their
livelihood at first depended far less on
farming than on the hunting and fishing
provided by the sea.
The Icelanders soon began to build
boats, no doubt using driftwood which
presumably was plentiful. In a country
practically without forests, the drift¬
wood also came in handy for housing
men and beasts and as material for
various household articles.
There was also seal hunting and
sea-bird catching for the Icelanders to
take advantage of, as well as an occa¬
sional stranded whale. The sea thus
proved to the settlers a generous
bringer of varied gifts.
Although the Icelanders have
throughout most of their history, in
fact up until the end of the 19th cen¬
tury, been regarded as an agricultural
nation, marine products have always
been the nation's most sought after
export goods, besides forming in large
measure the basis of the national diet.
For some time after the settlement,
the Icelanders had a considerable num¬
ber of merchant ships of their own
in which they went on trading voyages
to various foreign lands. In addition
to voyages to Greenland and America,
we have reports of Icelandic traders
in the Baltic, in France, in the British
Isles, and, most commonly when they
sailed in their own ships, in Norway.
But gradually the seafaring of the
Icelanders declined, as the settlement
fleet wore out. From 1262 Iceland was
under foreign rule, and overseas trade
fell Into foreign hands to remain there
for centuries.
Many reasons have been adduced
for this unfortunate development In Ice¬
landic overseas shipping. But the prin¬
cipal one is believed to lie in the Ice¬
landic production and marketing condi¬
tions of those times. Icelandic pro¬
ducts were lacking in variety, consist¬
ing chiefly of homespun and hides, and
it is known that during the first cen¬
turies after the settlement the demand
for these goods fell off, so that the
trade was no longer profitable. To this
was added the unfavourable location of
the country, voyages to Iceland being
costly as well as risky for the ships
of those days.
Towards the end of the 13th century
the export market for Icelandic goods
began to improve somewhat. Luckily
for the Icelanders a change in European
dietary habits resulted in a greatly
increased demand for fish. They began
to export stockfish, and around the
middle of the 14th century dried fish
and fish oil were being sold on a
large scale in foreign markets. Fish
products thus became the principal
export commodity of the country and
have remained so ever since.
For most of the country's history,
fishing in Iceland has been carried on
In open boats. In all likelihood very
small craft, carrying two or four men,
were always most common, so the na¬
tion has indeed been fortunate in hav¬
ing rich fishing grounds close inshore.
Larger six-oar and eight-oar craft were,
however, to be found already during
the first centuries of settlement.
In 1770 the Icelanders owned 1,870
boats, of which two-oar and four-oar
boats made up about one third each,
while just under one third consisted of
six-oar and eight-oar craft. In propor¬
tion to the population this was quite a
respectable fleet, for it would have
taken twenty per cent of the nation to
man all of it at once.
The first decked fishing boat in Ice¬
land is thought to have been built
about the middle of the 17th century,
but such vessels are not much heard
of until the 19th century. In 1828 their
number had reached 16, by 1876 it had
risen to 38, and by the close of the
century it had passed 100. All of these
first decked boats were sailing vessels.
The first motor boat came to Iceland
just after the turn of the century and
the first trawler In 1905. Trawler fish¬
ing, however, did not begin in earnest
until a few years later, but it has since
played an ever more important role in
the Icelandic fishing industry.
At the beginning of 1973 registered
open motor boats numbered 1,054, with
a total tonnage of 3,313. The 32 traw¬
lers listed in 1973 use trawl fishing
as their principal method, but an addi¬
tional 605 vessels use it to a greater
or lesser extent.
In the 20th century the Icelanders
finally became a seafaring nation
again. At the beginning of 1973 the
Icelandic register listed 77 vessels,
with a total of 63,633 gross registered
tons, for passenger and cargo trans¬
port, oil transport, patrolling and fish¬
eries inspection, rescue work, etc.
Except for oil, virtually all transport of
goods to and from the country is now
in Icelandic hands, as well as all
domestic transport by sea.
As far as Icelandic marine products
are concerned, the most important
commercial species have for a long
time been cod and herring, but other
species of importance include red-fish,
haddock, ocean cat-fish, plaice and
halibut, Norway lobster, shrimp and
scallop.
In the last few years there has been
a large catch of capelin most of which
has been used for fish-meal. Until
about 1910, shark-fishing played a cer¬
tain role in the fishing industry, and
in 1948 whaling was taken up. The
record catch of the Icelandic fishing
fleet for all types of fish was 1,199,100
tons in 1965, compared to 732,800 tons
in 1970.
M OREIGN markets for Ice¬
landic stockfish and fish oil opened up
at the beginning of the 14th century,
and for a long time these products
were the principal export commodities
of the country. In the 18th century
shortlived attempts were made to
utilize natural hot water for salt pro¬
duction. But about the same time the
Icelanders began in increasing measure
to cure saltfish (principally cod) for
export.
After the middle of the 19th century
the sale of saltfish increased rapidly,
and for a long time saltfish was the
chief export of the country. At the
same time the production of stockfish

ICELANDERS AND THE SEA (Continued)
decreased, but In recent decades it
has again become an Important indus¬
try, due to the opening of a big market
in West Africa.
In 1910 the freezing of fish for
export was begun, but the quantity
produced remained very small for a
long time. In 1950 frozen fish account¬
ed already for about 20 per cent
of the total exports and in 1972 chiefly
cod-type fish amounted to over 70 per
cent of the combined export of frozen
and salted fish products: it has thus
become one of the most important
export products of the country.
With the coming of drift-nets and
purse-nets after the turn of the century,
herring fishing increased and a new
Industry may be said to have been
added to the Icelandic economy. Dur¬
ing the following decades the share
of salted herring in the total exports
of fish products continued to grow,
and in certain years herring has
accounted for more than half of the
total catch, but there have been consi¬
derable periodic fluctuations in the
herring catch.
Although Iceland is a barren coun¬
try, has no forests or mineral resour¬
ces, and is forced to import not only
machinery and other industrial products
but also cereals and most necessities
of life except fish, meat and dairy
products, the Iceland of today ¡s a
welfare state. The per capita national
product amounted to $2,480 during the
period 1966-1970.
30
The reason for this high standard
of living Is above all to be found in
the rich fishing grounds around the
country, and fishing is the Industry on
which the relative affluence of the
country is based. No single nation
. relies as heavily on the sea for its eco¬
nomic prosperity as do the Icelanders.
In the 1930s the share of fish pro¬
ducts in the total value of the national
export passed 90 per cent, and at that
level It was to remain until the last
few years, when the growth of other
export industries has brought it down
to just over 80 per cent'. And as the
share of fish products in the exports
has increased, the total catch has kept
rising, and with it the standard of liv¬
ing of the nation.
Fishing In Icelandic waters is both
difficult and dangerous during the long
and cold winter months on a rough
and stormy ocean. The Icelanders
therefore regard it as a vital necessity
to use only fishing vessels of the
best kind available, equipped with the
most modern fishing gear, navigational
aids, and safety equipment.
The high total catch per fisherman
In Iceland (in 1969 it amounted to
about 143 tons per man) is due not
only to the richness of the fishing
grounds and excellent equipment, but
also to the skill of the Icelandic fisher¬
men and their thorough familiarity with
local conditions in Icelandic waters.
Iceland has two research Institutions
working exclusively In the service of
the fishing industry: the Fisheries
Research Institute and the Marine Re¬
search Institute. The Icelanders began
systematic fisheries studies shortly
after 1930, and activities in this field
have expanded and developed to the
point where they now include most
branches of océanographie research.
Special emphasis has been placed
on studying the physical-chemical con¬
ditions and the systems of currents in
the sea around Iceland and in adjacent
waters. Extensive studies have also
been made of the plant and animal
plankton and the way it is affected by
the chemical and physical factors of
the environment.
The principal subject of these resear¬
ches, however, are the fish stocks
themselves, their nature, their size, and
the effect that fishing has on them.
Recently Icelandic scientists have
turned their attention to pollution and
its effect on the marine fauna, espe¬
cially heavy-metal pollution. The pro¬
tection of the marine environment is
a matter of deep concern to the Ice¬
landers.
For several decades Iceland has par¬
ticipated in International research in
the field of fisheries and oceanography.
Through international organizations,
particularly the U.N. Food and Agricul¬
ture Organization, Icelandic Ichthyolo¬
gists, fishing captains, and technicians
have shared their knowledge and ex¬
perience with other nations.
The rich fishing grounds around Ice¬
land have long been a favourite haunt
of the fishing fleets of various foreign
nations. The continuous intensification
of the fishing has resulted in a severe
reduction of the fish stocks. The death
rate of some species has reached dan¬
gerous levels. This Is particularly true
of cod, where the mortality is at least
70 per cent and the proportion of small
fish in the catch is rising rapidly.
Thus a point had been reached some
time ago where it was clear that the
stocks were seriously overfished and
the productivity of the seas around Ice¬
land gravely endangered. On Septem¬
ber 1, 1972 the Icelandic Government
and the Althing (Parliament) decided to
extend the Icelandic fisheries jurisdic¬
tion to 50 miles. This decision has not
been accepted by all nations and has
been the cause of some tensions and
disputes with certain European fishing
nations.

as regular a feature of university life
as examinations.
Internally, higher education systems
have had to cope with an explosion
of knowledge, for in the last twenty
years scientists have found out rough¬
ly as much again about the natural
world and human nature as the sum of
all human knowledge up to 1950.
The scientific and technological
revolution has coincided with a period
of great social and economic change
in all parts of the world, calling into
question the accepted aims of higher
education. So many problems have
arisen that there is even much talk
among some people of a "world crisis
in education", and the need for
guidelines is obvious.
O help find solutions to
some of the problems which
higher educational systems are facing,
Unesco's International Institute for
Educational Planning (HEP) in Paris
undertook a world-wide study on the
planning of university development.
This involved computer-analyzing re¬
plies by 80 universities to a compre¬
hensive questionnaire and carrying out
21 case-studies of university activity,
including the teaching process,
research work and the formation of
teaching teams.
Since the universities participating
were located in more than fifty
countries, the International Institute had
a sufficiently representative group to
classify the information and this yielded
significant results. Thus the type and
level of planning was found to range
from comprehensive social and econo¬
mic planning in socialist countries to
indicative type planning in some wes¬
tern European countries, rudimentary
planning, or even, in more than a
quarter of the universities, no planning
at all.
The Institute was .able to work out a
diagnosis of the present situation of
higher education in different parts of
the world and in different groups of
countries. This showed how rash it
is to make assertions about "the
world crisis" without differentiating
between certain groups.
While there are many new pheno¬
mena in university development which
are common to many countries, their
consequences vary according to the
social, political and economic structure
of each country. There is a variety
of situations ranging from the very
critical (including periods of complete
disruption of university life as in
France and the United States) to the
smooth development of higher edu¬
cation in those countries where overall
social and economic planning is the
rule.
But important general conclusions
can be drawn. The first is that in
very many universities there is a
serious and increasing gap between
their activities and the actual needs
of their countries for qualified man¬
power In industry, agriculture or the
professions. The exceptions to this
are the universities in socialist
countries whose functions are pro¬
grammed in the overall national plan¬
ning which is part of their system.
Other universities are badly Informed
about these needs; very often they
have little or no idea how many of their
graduates will be required, or in which
fields of employment. Of the sample
of universities analysed, only 16 per
cent said that they were adequately
informed about the demand for their
graduates. The rest either did not
have this information at all or used
very unreliable methods to estimate
the demand.
The inquiry shows that in terms of
both quantity and quality universities
do not always relate their programmes
directly to national needs. This can
produce an unbalanced mixture of
graduates, leading to "intellectual
unemployment" and a shortage of
much-needed specialists. In India
and Ceylon, for example, there is
a predominance of social science and
humanities' graduates over those in
engineering. And this imbalance is
particularly apparent in some develop¬
ing countries of Africa where curricula
copied from those of European
countries are not strictly relevant to
their own particular situation.
In the last decade universities
around the world have had to cope
with soaring enrolments, as in Africa
where they tripled In the five years up
to 1968. Their concern has thus been
with questions of quantity: how to
expand their facilities, how to increase
their budgets and so on.
But quantity is no longer the main
problem as the global inquiry of the
International Institute revealed. This
was confirmed by a special survey
carried out by Unesco for the Con¬
ference of European Ministers of Edu
cation which it organized in Bucharest
in December last. In most countries
the rate of growth in enrolments is
declining and this trend is expected
to continue. In the view of university
heads, the focus must now be on
quality, on defining the aims of higher
education, on reforming curricula, on
raising the standard of teaching staff
and on making better use of existing
facilities.
A conclusion of particular import¬
ance to international organizations Is
the fact that despite the rapid growth
of higher education in developing
countries, the quality gap between
their universities and those in Indus¬
trially developed countries is not
diminishing with time, but widening.
This is true of both qualified teaching
staff and material resources, and as
a result, of the quality of teaching and
the amount and level of research work.

Some countries in Africa and Latin
America face serious difficulties in
training highly qualified staff and then
in keeping them at the university
where they have been trained. Very
often conditions are inadequate for
research work, and although good
training can be had abroad, the
chances of putting it to practical use
in the students' home countries are
sometimes so slim that foreign trained
graduates prefer to stay where they
can utilize their knowledge and so the
"brain drain" increases.
One of the most paradoxical facts
to emerge from the study is that many
universities which are active on the
frontiers of knowledge and research
have neither the information nor the
administrative means to plan and
manage their own affairs. Many
university authorities, while insisting
on the need for more money, more
teaching and research equipment and
expanded facilities, are not even aware
how existing facilities are being used.
Traditional university structures do
not as a rule contribute to interdisci¬
plinary or multidisciplinary studies
and research, but tend to separate
units instead of creating an atmos¬
phere of co-operation. Their jealously
guarded autonomy tends to isolate
universities from their social and
economic environment and they often
remain prisoners of traditions going
back to the Middle Ages.
Little information was available on
the social and economic backgrounds
of students but what there was indi¬
cates that despite the rapid growth In
numbers, in many countries large
sectors of the population, particularly
industrial and agricultural workers, are
not adequately represented at the
universities. This can be traced back
to the kinds of primary and secondary
education available to different social
groups and the fact that certain types
of school have" very weak links with
universities or none at all; some
schools are no more than educational
"dead ends".
Another important social aspect to
emerge from the Unesco study is that
although the proportion of women
students has been growing rapidly
during the last decade women still only
add up to an average of just over
30 per cent in the global sample. How¬
ever, the latest figures for Europe,
collected for the Bucharest confer¬
ence, show women making up 42 per
cent of the total of students and in one
country, Bulgaria, actually being in the
majority at 53.6 per cent.
The study also showed that many
countries do not provide proper
guidance and counselling for students.

by Dan Behrman
DAN BEHRMAN is a Unesco science writer well known to
"Unesco Courier" readers. He is the author of 'The New World
of the Oceans" (Little Brown and Co., Boston, U.S.A.) also
published in a paperback edition, and "In Partnership with Nature:
Unesco and the Environment" (Unesco, Paris, 1972). His latest
book, "The Man Who Loved Bicycles", was published last year by
Harper's Magazine Press, New York.
ERU's 10 million-ton-a-year
anchovy fishing industry, for years
the world's largest fishery, is today
threatened with collapse. Changes
in the movements of on ocean current
called El Niño are partly to blame.
In normal years, the cold Humboldt
Current of the eastern Pacific moving
north to the equator is driven offshore
by trade winds from the south-east.
When it moves away from the coast,
deep water wells up to replace it, bring¬
ing along nitrates and phosphates to
fertilize the growth of plant plankton.
The Peruvian anchovies graze on this
feast, swarming in such numbers that
they have made Peru the world's lead¬
ing fishing nation.
In abnormal years, the trade winds
weaken and warm water penetrates
down from the equator. The upwelling
stops, so does plant growth. The
anchovies fail to appear and the fisher¬
men return with empty holds.
The phenomenon is known as El
Niño (The Child) because It usually

occurs around Christmas time, the
summer season in the Southern Hemi¬
sphere. It struck most recently in 1972
with effects felt around the world.
The Peruvian anchovies are con¬
verted into fishmeal for animal feed.
Usually, they amount to two-fifths of
the world's fish meal production, but
the catch in 1972 dropped from 10 mil¬
lion to 4.5 million tons. Demand for
protein then drove up the price of
soya beans with widespread interna¬
tional economic and political reper¬
cussions.
Previously, the anchovies have
always returned following an El Niño.
In 1973, they did not come back in their
normal strength and the Peruvian
government closed the fishery in April.
No one really knows why the ancho¬
vies did not recover. A report by the
United Nations Food and Agriculture
Organization (FAO) Advisory Com¬
mittee on Marine Resources Research
states cautiously: "Most likely a com¬
bination of factors Is responsible. The
moderately low level of adult stock
resulting from heavy fishing can still
produce adequate offspring under av¬
erage or favourable conditions, but a
recruitment failure may occur when
environmental factors are poor."
The committee is not overly pessimis¬
tic: "Fortunately, throughout the period
of crisis, the Peruvian government has
kept catches at the lowest possible
level, thus minimizing the chances of
the Peruvian anchovy following the
Californian sardine and Atlanto-Scan-
dian (Norwegian) herring into commer¬
cial extinction."
Steps that could lead to an inter¬
national study of El Niño were voted
by the Intergovernmental Océanogra¬
phie Commission at its eighth assembly
at Unesco House in Paris, in November
last.
The decision to focus scientific effort
into a study of the problem was taken
by the Intergovernmental Océanogra¬
phie Commission when it adopted a
resolution submitted by Peru with the
support of Chile, Colombia and
Ecuador.
The resolution asks the Océanogra¬
phie Commission to organize, jointly
with FAO and the World Meteorolo¬
gical Organization, a "scientific work¬
shop" on El Niño, in a country within
the region in 1974. This meeting will
have a four fold purpose:
summarizing what Is now known
about El Niño-,
singling out the main questions
that must be answered if it is to be
understood and, most important of all,
predicted;
setting up a scientific research and
monitoring programme to solve these
problems with the "effective partici¬
pation" of countries belonging to the
International Océanographie Com¬
mission and FAO, particularly those
affected;
formulating proposals to study the
interaction between El Niño and the
region's biological resources.
These studies would be made as
part of the International Decade of
Ocean Exploration now under way.

Unesco appeal
for Moenjodaro
The Director-General of Unesco, René
Maheu, has launched an international
appeal for aid totalling $5 million to help
save Moenjodaro, the 5,000-year-old city-
site of the ancient Indus Valley civilization
in Pakistan (see "Unesco Courier", Dec¬
ember 1973). Moenjodaro's outstanding
archaeological remains are threatened with
total destruction unless measures are
taken immediately. A plan drawn up by
Pakistan in collaboration with Unesco spe¬
cialists aims to stabilize the right bank of
the Indus, lower the water table and
conserve Moenjodaro's buildings. The first
phase will last five years and cost an esti¬
mated $7.5 million.

of learning, it will not be a university in the
conventional sense granting degrees and
having a central campus but a flexible,
decentralized network of co-operation and

pressing global problems such as inter¬
national relations and peace, problems of
development and the influence of science

Catholic schools in Northern Ireland. Con¬
tacted by the Protestant Model Girl's
School, in Belfast, the neighbouring Cath¬
olic Little Flower School for girls agreed
to collaborate in an exchange project with
a girl's school in Hjardstrup (Denmark).
Girls from the Irish schools prepared tape-
recordings, scrapbooks and a film with
taped commentary on Northern Ireland for
the Danish school. Later a joint party from
both schools visited Denmark with the help
of the Council for Education in World
Citizenship and the section of the Danish
Ministry of Education which handles
Unesco's Associated Schools Project in
Denmark. Co-operation between the schools
is now as firmly established as the links
with their Danish friends.

Letters to the Editor
PORTUGUESE ' AFRICA
Sir,
No matter how just and worthy the
cause of liberating the African people
from Portuguese domination, I maintain
that to devote a whole number to this
theme is unjustified.
Your aim has always been to provide
informative and stimulating reading on
cultural and educational subjects and
you have usually been successful in
what you set out to achieve.
In any case your message in the
November 1973 issue lost its impact
through repetition.
E. N. Bardon
Booterstown, Ireland
Sir,
I have been a reader and admirer of
the "Unesco Courier" since 1960.
Reading your November 1973 number
I was extremely shocked to find that
your excellent magazine had chosen to
publish tendentious and biased articles
on the position of Portugal in Africa,
without giving its many readers the
possibility of being able to reach an
independent conclusion.
I must say in the strongest terms
and I am sure that my view is that of
all Portuguese how much I disagree
with your decision to publish these
articles.
"Signed articles", states the 'Unesco
Courier' on page 3, "express the
opinions of the authors and do not
necessarily represent the opinions of
Unesco or those of the editors of the
'Unesco Courier'."
How then are we to understand what
we read on page 25 of the same issue:
"The 'Unesco Courier' offers readers
a preview from a special Unesco report
on the effects of Portuguese colo¬
nialism. . . in African territories under
Portuguese control. . . This study is
one of several which Unesco plans to
publish under its programme of "moral
assistance' to African liberation move¬
ments."
For these reasons I no longer wish
to receive the "Unesco Courier" and
am cancelling my subscription.
Adolfo de Castro
Oporto, Portugal
Sir,
Bravo for your November 1973 issue
on independence movements in Portu¬
guese Africa.
Jean Lepetit
Marseille, France
Sir,
I do not wish to renew my subscrip¬
tion to the "Unesco Courier" as I
consider the November 1973 issue to
be tendentious and quite inappropriate
in choice of subject, presentation and
content.
J. M. Stewart
Paris, France
Sir,
The article by Amilcar Cabrai pub¬
lished in your November 1973 issue
has real importance. Very few people
in the industrially developed countries
realize that the cultures of the dev¬
eloping countries are in no way
inferior to their own.
What is even more disturbing is
that western culture is still used as a
means of coercion and exploitation of
others.
L. Covez

40 MILLION CHILD WORKERS
Sir,
The October 1973 issue of the
Courier gave me quite a pang after I
read about 40 million child-workers in
the world. Fifty years ago, when Soviet
Russia was healing her wounds after
the first world war, I was among those
who took part in the campaign to help
homeless children. Those grim years
now belong to the past but I still
remember the poor orphans and the
effect on them of a life in the streets.
I cannot but feel strong indignation
over the position of 40 million children
aged from six to fourteen, for it is a
disgrace to exploit children's labour.
Moreover, this situation exists in some
developed countries where there are
millions of unemployed adults.
From the pages of your magazine
I would like to call on world public
opinion to step up the struggle against
this gross injustice. Children must go
to school.
Can we talk about human rights if
merciless exploitation begins with the
young ones?
I. I. Marusich

CHANGING THE WEATHER
Sir,
Your August-September 1973 issue of
the "Unesco Courier" on Meteorology
was a fine achievement, especially since
this science has such an influence on
our everyday life.
However, I should like to comment on
.two of the subjects touched upon. On
page 30 you mentioned Professor E.A.
Bernard's warning against experiments
with artificial rainfall in developing
countries. I disagree with this point of
view. Not only should these countries
undertake such projects which are
directly linked with their economies,
their development and their indepen¬
dence, but they should also receive the
support of the developed countries and
international organizations.
The problem is certainly not a simple
one, but it does not call for authoritarian
solutions based on preconceived ideas
decreeing by whom such projects may
be undertaken (at least in the fields of
science and technology) or what the
developing countries may or may not
do before the problem has been fully
explored, or because it may or may
not suit the interests of more developed
countries.
I do not question Professor Bernard's
good intentions, but his words could lead
to confusion since he does not explain,
even briefly, the scientific and historical
background to the question of weather
modification. This would have shown
the enormous difficulties scientists have
had to overcome to achieve modest but
important advances in the problem of
artificial rain.
The second subject I would like to
raise is that mentioned on page 13
what meteorology can do to help us
avoid famine in the year 2000. You do
not mention the advantages that could
be obtained by experiments with weather
modification on a large scale. Among
other things, such experiments would
enable us to achieve regular crop yields,
to extend the land area devoted to
agriculture and cattle-raising, etc., with
all the social and economic consequen¬
ces that would imply.

ABC OF METEOROLOGY
Sir.
I am a keen reader of the "Unesco
Courier" and I especially enjoyed your
issue on the world problems of meteor¬
ology and weather forecasting (August-
September 1973).
To my mind François Le Lionnais
and Roger Clausse found the best way
to popularize the subject in "A Short
Guide to Weather-Speak" which gives
an ABC of meteorology and weather
forecasting for the man-in-the-street. I
also enjoyed the "50 World Weather
Records" which taught me more about
various weather phenomena all over the
globe.
Although your magazine has on more
than one occasion tackled the prob¬
lems of oceanography, I suggest that
it should tell us about the latest aspects
of the problem of using the resources
and power of the World Ocean.

RIGHTS OF YOUTH
IN ARGENTINA
Sir,
I would like to correct some facts
concerning Argentina published in your
October 1973 issue under the heading
"Age Ladder of Rights and Obligations".
Under Argentinian law, the minimum
age for marriage is 16 for boys and
14 for girls and not 18 as you stated.
As for the age of criminal responsibility,
the law contains special provisions for
minors. Minors under the age of 16
cannot be subjected to the normal pro¬
visions of the penal code; those aged
from 16 to 17 can, in certain circums¬
tances, be tried in the same way as
adults and even sentenced when, the
judge "deems it necessary". Similarly
the judge has the power to reduce the
proscribed penalty by dealing with an
offence as if it were only an attempted
offence. Finally, the right to vote is
granted at 18 and not at 21.

WHAT'S UP IN HIGHER EDUCATION ? (Continued from page 33)
38
As a result, young people often opt
for currently "fashionable" courses.
The social sciences, for example, are
now growing much faster than other
disciplines whereas engineering and
other subjects which are vital for the
economy, are frequently under-pro¬
ducing.
To a great extent the so-called
"open system" of admission contri¬
butes to these imbalances. Univer¬
sities such as those in France, where
everyone who has a secondary edu¬
cation certificate automatically has the
right to entrance, have serious diffi¬
culties because they cannot predict
the size of student admissions and
because the percentage of drop-outs
is much higher than in universities
where admission is by selective
examination or assessment. In any
case, the aim of unlimited access to
higher education often proves an
illusion, since selection does In fact
exist in other forms, either at the lower
levels of education or in the form of
a high rate of drop-out.
ENCOURAGING findings
are that teaching staffs have increased
rapidly in numbers, and despite the
fact that junior staff now make up an
even greater proportion of teachers,
the level of their qualifications has
risen. A far larger ratio of today's
teachers possess the highest academic
degrees.
University teaching staff certainly
need all the advantages of youth and
high qualifications. They have to face
ever new situations as more and more
students from widely varying edu¬
cational backgrounds enrol, specializ¬
ation is modified by new knowledge
and sources of scientific information
continue to multiply. Merely keeping
abreast of a subject has become
almost a full time job.
All this has changed the role of the
teacher. From being mainly a source
of Information, the teacher must now
evolve into an organizer of the teach¬
ing-learning process and in this stu¬
dents themselves need to play an active
part. A consequence Is the need to
develop the techniques of teaching in
higher education. Some universities
(the University of London for example)
have started work in this direction
and in several countries, the U.S.S.R.
actively among them, systematic
courses for the improvement of the
qualifications of university teaching
staff have been organized.
The Unesco-International Institute
investigation shows that universities
are experimenting with new technical
media for the teaching process, but
partly because of their relatively high
costs and partly because of the tradi¬
tional approach towards teaching,
change here is still far behind the level
which one might expect to see. For
example, computer-assisted instruction
was used by only eleven per cent of
universities in the sample, U.S. uni¬
versities being well ahead of others.
One of the directions in which
higher education is likely to develop
is obviously towards greater democ¬
ratization. But as the analysis of
students' social backgrounds shows,
democratization does not happen
merely because greater numbers of
students are admitted; both the acade¬
mic and the material conditions have
to be created to allow the access of
all social groups and classes to higher
education.
In some countries, notably the
Soviet Union and Poland, special
preparatory courses for working youth
have been created in order to com¬
pensate for varying levels of second¬
ary education and bring young workers
directly to the university. In other
countries, continuing education centres
are introduced to fill these gaps while
in the United Kingdom, the Open
University, a combination of broadcast
and televised instruction with corre¬
spondence courses, has been set up
to offer the chance of higher education
to anyone with the will and the time
for it.
Rules of admission are also being
eased. Thus, it was reported that in
Finland some institutions are required
to accept a fixed percentage of stu¬
dents without matriculation; in Sweden,
students with a minimum of two years
of secondary education can be ad¬
mitted after an aptitude test; in
Yugoslavia adults may enter if they
have worked for four years in an
activity connected with their proposed
studies. In the Soviet Union, technical
studies in a specialized school may be
accepted instead of the normal
secondary courses.
LNOTHER step In the direc¬
tion of- democratization is the wide¬
spread introduction of short courses of
up to 24 months which are preliminary
to, but independent of, full-length uni¬
versity courses of three or more years.
A further contribution is the develop¬
ment of the concept of life-long edu¬
cation and its introduction into the
university framework. This, while
helping to bring people of all ages
and different social origins into the
university, can also prepare univer¬
sities for their new function coping
with "the knowledge explosion" by
providing refresher courses where
qualifications can be improved and
graduates retrained. Such functions
will help the present higher educa¬
tional systems to find closer links with
working life.
The results of both Unesco Inquiries
show that universities need to seek
clearer definitions of their aims and
objectives and to give their programmes
more flexibility to meet the goals.
The studies point out that this could be
achieved through better planning and
the use of modern management
techniques.
The Unesco study into European
higher education shows that the pro¬
portion actually enrolled of the age-
group who could be at university (20-
24 years old) is already very high:
23 per cent in the U.S.S.R., well over
20 per cent in Sweden and the Nether¬
lands, around 15 per cent in Bulgaria,
France, the German Democratic
Republic, the Federal Republic of Ger¬
many and Yugoslavia, and just over
14 per cent In the U.K.
MUDENT bodies are be¬
coming increasingly international in
Europe where higher educational insti¬
tutions receive over 40 per cent of all
the world's students taking courses
abroad. Latin Americans, in particu¬
lar, study in Spain, students from
African and Arab States in France,
and Asians in Britain, while In the
U.S.S.R. and the German Democratic
Republic foreign students come from
a wide range of countries.
Spain and Switzerland reported a
balance between the flow Into higher
education and foreseeable job oppor¬
tunities, but other European countries
had some "overproduction" in medi¬
cine and dentistry in Ireland and the
social sciences in Sweden.
At their Bucharest meeting the Euro¬
pean ministers agreed on the need
for more plastic surgery for changing
the face of higher education. Apart
from increasing access to higher
education, countries should build
bridges between its different forms,
doing away with the "class distinction"
between university and technical train¬
ing and making it possible for students
to move between them.
They suggested that students at
upper secondary school should be
prepared both for jobs and for further
studies, so that they have a real choice
between going to work or going to the
university when they leave. They
urged universities to admit adults on
the same basis as school-leavers and
to adapt their organization and
methods to accommodate more mature
people, who clearly have different
experience and family needs from
those of the traditional young student.
The ministers also called for greater
exchanges of students and professors
and asked Unesco to tackle the
biggest obstacle to mobility in higher
education by speeding preparation of
a European convention on the mutual
recognition of diplomas. At present,
substantial agreement exists only
between the socialist countries and
inside the Nordic group of countries. M

ÄND OF ICE AND FIRE
he breathtaking beauty of Iceland's
hi Gullfoss Canyon waterfall in winter garb.
Apparently petrified in full flood, the
' waterfall continues to flow even at minus
20 °C. beneath a covering mantle of frozen
- spray. Although situated just south of the
' Arctic circle, Iceland is also aland of fire,
lying as it does across one of the most
active and unpredictable volcano belts in
the world (see articles pages 4 and 16).
