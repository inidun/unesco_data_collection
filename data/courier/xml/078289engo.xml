Handsome young Etruscan
The Etruscans, who flourished in central Italy some 2,800 years ago, are one of history's
enigmas. Where they came from has never been satisfactorily explained nor has their
writing been deciphered. What is certain is that they were gifted sculptors whose works
in bronze, ivory and terracotta have shown us the nature of the civilization they created
before it was absorbed into the Roman world. This bronze head of a young Etruscan
(4th century B.C.) has qualities that recall Greek sculptures of the same period.

THE GREAT
CIVILIZATION
OF THE KUSHANS
The Kushan Empire of Central Asia ranked with
Rome, China and Parthia in the first centuries of
our era. It is now emerging from the shrouds of
mystery to take its rightful place in world history.

WO thousand years ago
central Asia, northern India, West
Pakistan, Afghanistan and eastern Iran
formed a single vast state which
stretched all the way from the shores
of the Aral Sea to the Indian Ocean.
This empire, which had given itself
the name of Kushan, ranked with the
other great empires of the time Rome,
Parthia and China and formed one
of the most important links in the
political system of the ancient world.
The empire of the Kushans was the
setting for a number of crucial events
in the history of Asian civilization. It
not only stands as a symbol of the poli¬
tical unity of many peoples and races
of the East but also represents a new
stage in the cultural development of
Asia and the world as a whole.
The great period of Gandhara
art coincides with the reign of
the Kushan Dynasty. From India,
Buddhism spread rapidly throughout
the Kushan Empire and from there be¬
gan its penetration and conversion of
China. Kushan artists enriched Bud¬
dhist sculpture by the most important
innovation of the period: the rendering

The Kushan Empire occupies
a unique place in the
history of the ancient
world, and recent
archaeological discoveries
have produced new
evidence to show that
several distinctly different
art schools flourished in
different parts of the vast
kingdom that stretched
from the Aral Sea to the
Indian Ocean. Kushan art
first developed in ancient
Bactria. Left, head of

of the Buddha in human form. The
Kushans not only sponsored great in¬
tellectual and artistic achievements in
their dominions but were also in close
contact with the leading cultural cen¬
tres of the ancient world, and control¬
led the important overland routes bet¬
ween China and Rome.
At the beginning of the Christian era
the powerful Kushan Empire bordered
on China in the east and Parthia in
the west and linked the previously
disunited centres of the ancient world
into a single whole. For several cen¬
turies, all the countries of the ancient
world from the British Isles to the
shores of the Pacific Ocean were under
either Roman, Parthian, Chinese or
Kushan rule, and these four great em¬
pires were themselves interlinked by
a complex system of close ties and
communication.
The first trans-continental trading
and diplomatic route known as the
Great Silk Route ran from China to the
Mediterranean across the Parthian and
Kushan dominions. More than a
thousand years before Vasco da
Gama, ships were sailing regularly
over the Indian Ocean and the Red
Sea between Egypt, conquered by
Rome, and the ports of western India
which served the Kushan empire.
At the same time the important land
route over the steppes was apparently
opened from central Asia to eastern
Europe and the ancient towns of the
northern Black Sea coast. Coins of
Kushan rulers have been found in Kiev,

the most

KUSHAN CIVILIZATION (Continued)
An empire created by
in Ethiopia and Scandinavia as well as
in towns of the former Roman Empire,
while Roman coins of Augustus and
Tiberius have been discovered in
western and southern India.
Kushan coins from the Kama area
(southwest of the Urals) and a silver
vessel from Khorezm in the eastern
Urals point to links with northern neigh¬
bours. Dishes produced by craftsmen
in the town which once stood on the
same site as present-day Dushanbe
(capital of the Soviet Tajik Republic)
show pictures of the god Dionysius.
Indian bone carvings of the Kushan
period have been discovered in Pom¬
peii, and Roman glassware has been
unearthed in the palace of the Kushan
rulers at Begram, north of Kabul.
In the Roman Empire, the Asiatic
cult of Mithra extended as far as Brit¬
ain, oriental spices and silk were
fashionable in Rome, and Roman arti¬
cles have often been found in western
Asia, the Caucasus, Hindostán, central
Asia and Indo-china. Kushan ambas¬
sadors were present in Rome at the
celebrations held by Trajan after his
victory over the Dacians at the end of
the 1st century A.D.
Thus the Kushan period was not
simply the continuation of previously
established relations between East and
West but qualitatively a new stage in
the development of this important his¬
torical and cultural process.
L.ITTLE more than a century
has passed since scholars first began
their investigations of the Kushan
epoch. The origins and birth of the
Kushan civilization are still shrouded in
much mystery despite the early
accounts and chronicles left to us by
the ancient Greeks, Romans and Chi¬
nese. The patient effort of many
scientists and scholars from different
countries, combined with recent
archaeological discoveries, is slowly
helping to unravel the secrets of their
past.
Here it is encouraging to note that
one of the themes of a new Unesco
project, "Studies on the Civilizations
of the Peoples of Central Asia" is
devoted to the history of the Kushans.
Last year, Unesco organized an inter¬
national conference at Dushanbe on
the history, archaeology and culture of
Central Asia during the Kushan per¬
iod, attended by scholars from many
countries, which has given new im¬
petus to the study of this important
aspect of world history.

former nomads
The history of the Kushans covers a
period of about five centuries, between
the downfall of the Graeco-Bactrian
kingdom in the second or first centur¬
ies B.C. and the rise of the empire
of the Ephtalites, or White Huns, at the
end of the fourth or early in the fifth
century A.D. (1).
Very little is known about the early
years of the Kushan State. It is now
generally agreed that it was created by
a nation of former nomads whose ruling
princes gave themselves the dynastic
name Kushanas (Kuei Shuang, in Chi¬
nese chronicles). Who these nomads
were is still not absolutely certain, but
current evidence clearly points to
tribes from the northern regions of
Central Asia who formed a confederacy
with other tribes called Yueh-Chih, Wu-
Sun, and the Sakas, a Scythian people
of Central Asian origin.
s.I OME time between the se¬
cond and first centuries B.C., these
tribes joined together to overthrow the
Greek kingdom of Bactria. In the
struggle which ensued the Kushans
must have headed all the other nation-
tribes of the confederation since they
gave their name to the new state in
Bactria.
The first ruler whose name is re¬
corded in history is Kujula Kadphiz
(there are many spellings of Kushan
names), who proclaimed himself "King
of Kings" and carried out the first
great policy of Kushan unification,
uniting Bactria and Sogdiana (whose
capital city was Samarkand), and
extending his influence over the Ka¬
bul valley and Kashmir to the south.
His successor, Vima Kadphiz, contin¬
ued to expand the kingdom to the
south and south-east, spreading its
cultural influence as far as Benares.
In the north, the ancient kingdom of
Kangha (later known as Khorezm) was
also united into the empire.
It was under Kanishka that Kushan
reached the zenith of its cultural in¬
fluence. Although Kanishka's name
scarcely figures at all in the histories
intended for the general reader, there

(1) Kushan chronology has tantalized scho¬
lars for generations, and very few events
can be dated with any precision or certainty.
Even the dates of the reign of Emperor
Kanishka, the best-known personality of
Kushan history, Is sharply disputed, with
different schools fixing the beginning of his
reign at A.D. 78; A.D. 110-115; A.D. 128; and
A.D. 144. Editor's note.

This monumental headless statue Is thought to represent Kanishka, the great ruler
of the Kushans. It was discovered at Surkh Kotal (north-eastern Afghanistan)
In the ruins of the acropolis raised by Kanishka towards the end of the first century A.D.
An almost Identical headless figure, now In the archaeological museum at Mathura
(Afghanistan), bears an inscription clearly identifying it as a statue of Kanishka.
French archaeological missions have made numerous excavations at Surkh Kotal
under the direction of Professor Daniel Schlumberger. Among Important remains
they have brought to light is a massive stone Inscription (detail below) which has proved
to be one of the most significant discoveries of the past twenty years in historical
and philological studies of this part of Asia. This Kushan text is composed of 25 lines
written in Greek characters. Though not yet fully deciphered, It has thrown
new light on the construction of the Surkh Kotal acropolis by the great Kanishka.

Kushan portrait
gallery of
2,000 years ago
All the Kushan sculptures on these pages,
with the exception of photo 10, are recent
discoveries made in southern Soviet
Uzbekistan. Number 10, unearthed near
Begram (Afghanistan), is believed to represent
a water goddess. Carved in ivory, this
outstanding work of the Gandhara school
(see photos page 10) is now in the Kabul
museum. Most of the sculptures shown on
these pages were modelled in clay and then
painted. They were recovered from the main
hall of a Kushan palace at Kalchayan,
excavated a few years ago by an expedition
led by the Soviet woman archaeologist,
Professor Galina Pugachenkova. Character
portraits par excellence, the sculptures depict
a cross-section of people in one area of the
Kushan Empire 2,000 years ago. The portrait
gallery includes an almost complete figure
of a Kushan prince (3), a warrior and a
bowman (4 and 8), a jester (5) and a
satyr (12). The woman's head (9) was
unearthed at Dalversin-tepe, another Kushan
city excavated by the same expedition in
southern Uzbekistan. Discoveries at the two
sites have given scholars new insight into
Kushan culture and particularly the monumental
statuary art of this region which formed
part of northern Bactria.

This extraordinary piece of
sculpture, which could
easily be taken for one of
the saints gracing the
medieval cathedrals of
Europe, is an example of the
Gandhara art school that
flowered In Central Asia,
In the first centuries of
our era, during the Kushan
period. Gandhara art was
influenced by the styles of
many countries Including
Greece, Rome and Persia.

KUSHAN CIVILIZATION (Continued from page 7)
Kanishka, one of the great sovereigns of Antiquity
can be little doubt that he was one of
the greatest sovereigns that ever held
sway in the ancient world.
Kanishka is remembered as one of
the great patrons of art and religion,
who turned Gandhara into a veritable
holy land of Buddhism (although as we
shall see in a moment religious toler¬
ance was the hallmark of Kushan
civilization). Kanishka convened the
Fourth Buddhist Council, and it is gen¬
erally believed that the Buddhism of
the Great Vehicle made its appearance
under his reign and patronage.
II HE overthrow of Greek rule
by no means led to a decline In the
cultural and political importance of
Bactria and its neighbouring regions.
Greek, dynasties in Bactria and India
had already become isolated from
Mediterranean civilization by the sec¬
ond and first centuries B.C. and had
degenerated into warring groups.
However strange it may seem, it was
not until the Greek rulers had been re¬
placed by Kushan kings that the ancient
local traditions received a new impetus.
The mutual influence of Greek and
local Bactrian cultures goes back as
early as the Achaemenian epoch in the
fourth century B.C. when the first set¬
tlers from the Hellenic world appeared
in the area and founded their colonies.
Bactria also played an important part
in Alexander the Great's plan to unite
the Hellenes with the peoples of the
East. The fact that the Kushans
adopted the Greek script to record
the ancient Bactrian language is also
an event of great cultural significance.
Thus, three different historical and
cultural components, I. e. the local Bac¬
trian, the Hellenic and the nomadic
combined with the traditions of the
neighbouring peoples in Central Asia,
Afghanistan, Pakistan, India and Iran
to create that complex and unique com¬
bination of ethnic, cultural, social and
political phenomena we know as the
Kushan civilization.
Central Asia thus came to play a
tremendous role in the dissemination
of Greek, Roman and Indian culture in
the Far East. The evidence of written
records and archaeological findings
suggests that the whole eastern part
of the Great Silk Route was entirely
in the hands of the Sogdians by the
fourth century A.D. The Sogdians had
founded their colonies and settlements
in the heart of Asia for trade with
many peoples. Sogdian silks, com¬
peting with those from China and the
Far East, later penetrated into Byzan¬
tium and western Europe. This is
supported by recent finds of silk bear¬
ing "old" Sogdian inscriptions among
European church treasures.
This union of the peoples of Cen¬
tral Asia, Afghanistan, Pakistan, India
and eastern Iran within the framework
of a single state, and their comparative
security from foreign invasions, led to
a flourishing in trade and great pros¬
perity in that part of the world.
The Kushan period is furthermore
marked by a very significant fact: the
prolonged and fruitful co-existence of
the traditions of the various peoples
who inhabited the empire and of their
different religious systems and beliefs.
The Kushan pantheon bears witness
to this religious tolerance and the co¬
existence of different cultural tradi¬
tions. Coins struck In the second
century A.D. during the reign of Kan¬
ishka bear the names and effigies of
gods from the Indian, Persian and Hel¬
lenic pantheons: Mithras the defender
of truth; Ordokhsh the goddess of
fertility; the mighty god of war, Vere-
tragna; the Indian Shiva as well as
Buddha; Helios, Selena and even
Serapis whose cult was well-known
in Hellenic Egypt.
The syncretic character of the Ku¬
shan religious pantheon reflected the
ethnic and cultural diversity of the
population of this vast empire, and the
many standards and traditions which
had developed through close mutual
contact, and had formed a common
bond throughout the kingdom.
This tolerance, in the broadest sense
of the word, was an important factor
in the flowering of culture, making it
possible to preserve the essential fea¬
tures of local traditions and ways,
while it helped to mould new cultural
values for the entire nation.
IHE Kushan Empire, as we
have seen, was instrumental in the wide
dissemination of Buddhism in Asia.'
But this did not lead by any means to
the disappearance of local religions
and traditions. It was a fruitful,
complex process of mutual influence
and acceptance of new ideas.
The history of Buddhism in Central
Asia offers us some interesting
insights in this respect, despite the
fact that Buddhism was never the pre¬
vailing religion there. The followers
of Buddhism in Bactria not only learn¬
ed to read the Buddhist texts and
translated them into Sanskrit but also
prepared careful commentaries and
explanations of the texts.
This approach can also be seen in
religious architecture. The design
and structure of the Buddhist temples
in Bactria (and later in Central Asia
generally) did not as a rule correspond
to the Buddhist sanctuaries of the pre-
Kushan and early Kushan periods in
India, but rather to the religious archi¬
tecture of Near and Central Asia with
its enclosed sanctuary surrounded by
narrow circular corridors.
Central Asia became the centre from
which Buddhist culture spread across
the face of Asia to China, Japan and
Korea. Chinese manuscripts contain
the names of more than ten Buddhist
monks from Bactria, Sogdiana and Par¬
thia who wrote religious texts and
translated them into Chinese. And
some authorities have rightly asserted
that China would not have known
Buddhism in the 2nd-4th centuries A.D.
had it not been for the Central Asian
monks.
cI ENTRAL Asia thus became
the direct link between the Near and
Far East. This was no mechanical
link implying the mere transfer of one
people's culture to another. It involved
a total mastery of different cultural
values and their fusion into a new and
higher synthesis.
It was during the Kushan period that
the peoples of the East first became
aware of the tremendous importance
of relations between peoples as well
as states, and created common cultu¬
ral values which served to cement
together all the peoples of this vast
region. And no less important, in the
course of this process of assimilation
the local traditions and features of
each component part of the common
culture were preserved.
These features, common to all the
people of the Kushan Empire, have
become clearly apparent over the last
few years in the field of art, where at
the same time the unique character of
local art trends and schools can be
readily discerned.
For several decades scholars have
been arguing over the origins and
nature of Kushan art. Specimens of
Kushan art found in Gandhara (West
Pakistan) were examined to establish
their link with ancient Roman traditions
or Buddhist art. The discovery of 1 1
Kushan works belonging to the Ma- ' '
thura school of India, finds in Pakis¬
tan (Taxila and Butkara), Afghanistan

KUSHAN CIVILIZATION (Continued)
The influence of Kushan civilization was
prolonged in Central Asia well after
the Empire had ceased to exist Traces
of its artistic legacy are seen in these
two paintings copies of sections of
a 7th-8th century fresco discovered
near Samarkand (Uzbekistan) in 1965

(Begram, Hadda and more recently
Surkh Kotal) and in Central Asia (Air-
tarn and the recent discoveries in
Khalchayan and Dalverzin-Tepe) have
completely revised earlier ideas about
the origins and nature of that complex,
many-sided phenomenon that was
Kushan art.
Today we can definitely state that
several different artistic schools and
trends existed during the Kushan per¬
iod, which though often inter-connect¬
ed were also artistically independent.
Bactrian art occupied a special position
in Kushan art as a whole, and amazing
specimens have been found recently in
northern Afghanistan and Central Asia.
It was in Bactria that Kushan art first
emerged to be developed later by
other schools.
The art of the Kushans survived long
after the downfall of the empire and
became an inspiration for many paint¬
ers and masters from the early
medieval countries and regions of Cen¬
tral Asia, Hindostán and the Far East.
Its influence is clearly discernible in
the sculpture of the Guptas in India and
in wall paintings and reliefs in Sog¬
diana (Pjanjikent, Varakhsha) and east¬
ern Turkestan.
IHE cultural and historical
ties which developed during the
Kushan period continued to be felt for
centuries in this vast area, and Kushan
art has made a particularly important
contribution to the medieval art of Af¬
ghanistan, Iran and Central Asia.
Scholars are now tracing Kushan in¬
fluences in the later religious philo¬
sophies and thinking of India as well as
in the culture of the peoples of north
India, West Pakistan, Afghanistan and
Central Asia. It is quite obvious that
Kushan culture forms an integral part
of the history and cultural heritage of
the descendants of these peoples
today.
By virtue of their high level of dev¬
elopment, their originality and grace,
Kushan art and culture stand on a par
with the culture of ancient Greece and
Rome. Each decade, every year, con¬
tinues to provide new finds. The 1960s
were particularly rich and fruitful.
Thanks to the joint efforts of schol¬
ars from Afghanistan, India, the
U.S.S.R., Pakistan and Iran, the French
archaeological mission in Afghanistan,
Italian and Japanese expeditions, and
the work of scholars from the U.S.A.,
Great Britain and other countries, im¬
portant new material has come to light
on the Kushan period. And perhaps
the day will soon come when the key
will be found to unlock all the mysteries
of this remarkable and unique period
in human civilization.

COINAGE OF THE

Images of Kushan rulers have come down to us on the coins struck
during their reigns. Portrait on coin, above left, is that of Kujula Kadphiz,
first unifier of the Kushan Empire. Above right, reverse of same coin.
Below right, coin bearing the image of King Kanishka, a great patron of the

Below left, reverse of same coin. The documentary evidence of Kushan
coins, unearthed in large numbers from many sites, has been of great
value to historians and scholars seeking to reconstruct the history
of the Kushan Empire. Near Begram (or Kapisa), the former summer
capital of the Kushan Empire, north-east of Kabul (Afghanistan),
no less than 30,000 coins dating from various periods were discovered
in 1830. Other rich archaeological finds made at Begram include a great
hoard of luxury objects: Syrian glass, Chinese lacquer ware, Indian ivory
carvings, Hellenistic bronze figurines, plaster models for silver plaques
from the Graeco-Latin West. The Begram finds are evidence
of the many contacts and exchanges which the Kushan Empire
promoted between the peoples of the Ancient World.

UNKNOWN TREASURES
OF HIMALAYAN ART
by Madanjeet Singh
A unique artistic heritage, still virtually unknown to the world at large, is
hidden in the fastnesses of the Himalayan ranges. Until recently no single
account of Himalayan art covering the entire region from Ladakh in the
west to Bhutan in the east had been published, chiefly because its
magnificent wall-paintings and sculptures are located mainly in remote
temples and monasteries. This omission has now been made good with
the publication of "Himalayan Art" by Madanjeet Singh, the first volume
in a new series of Unesco Art Books (published in U.K. by Macmillan and
Co. Ltd., London; in U.S.A. by the New York Graphic Society, Greenwich,
Conn.; see inside back cover). Thanks to the help of the Indian and
Nepalese governments and with the authorization of the Dalai Lama and
the local rulers of Sikkim and Bhutan, Madanjeet Singh was able to reach
the most inaccessible religious communities and to photograph works of
art whose reproduction had hitherto been forbidden. With the following
article, written specially for this issue of the "Unesco Courier" by
Madanjeet Singh, we reproduce a number of these works (some in full
colour) selected from "Himalayan Art". To collect material for this first
complete account of a significant chapter in the history of Asian and world
art, Mr. Singh undertook thirty-five expeditions by helicopter, jeep, pony
and on foot to visit mountain shrines, and made over 7,000 repro¬
ductions of manuscripts, wall-paintings and sculptures.

HE eminent Indian sage
Swami Vivekananda was once asked
in the United States whether India's
heat had influenced the forms of India's
spiritual heritage and religions. He
replied that India's greatest spiritual
inspirations were nourished not so
much in its tropical climate as through
the meditations of ascetics in the Hima¬
laya, which means "abodes of snow".
Among these saints the one most
revered in the Himalaya is the Indian
sage Padmasambhava (750-800 A.D.);
there is hardly a Buddhist shrine in
the mountains that does not contain
an image of this Siddha or Tantra Guru.
According to tradition, it was at
Riwalsar in the Punjab Hills that Pad¬
masambhava, who came from Uddiyana
MADANJEET SINGH is a rare combination of
scholar, painter, writer and photographer. A
long-time student of Asian art and European
art history, he became known internationally
with his first book, 'Indian Sculpture In
Bronze and Stone", published in Rome by
the Institute of the Middle and Far East in
1952. This was followed in 1954 by 'India:
Paintings from Ajanta Caves" (A Unesco
World Art Series album) published by the
New York Graphic Society. Mr. Singh
devoted a later book to the art of this famous
Indian shrine ("Ajanta', published jointly In
1964 by Thames and Hudson. London, and
The Macmillan Company of New York). A
member of the Indian Diplomatic Service,
Mr. Singh is now First Secretary at the Indian
Embassy In Madrid.
(the Swat valley in Kashmir), gave a
popular basis to the mystical elements
of Tantric philosophy and iconography.
He thus became a symbol of the spirit
of the time, in an age when Buddhist
and Hindu practices and art forms
practically lost their separate identity.
Padmasambhava is said to have
travelled several times between Tibet
and Kashmir via Riwalsar despite the
difficult journey involving three or
four months. Although his specific
routes of travel are not known, the
footpaths had been well recognized
since the time of Thonmi Sambhota,
the minister of the famous Tibetan
king Srongtsen-gampo (died 650 A.D.).
Thonmi Sambhota had journeyed to
Kashmir to learn the Sanskrit alphabet
and had also brought back to Tibet
several models of Kashmiri art.
Since his time the holiest of all
mountains, Kailasha, by the sacred
lake Manasarovara, could be approach¬
ed from the important Buddhist centre
Jalandhara by following the river
Sutlej upstream. This great river with
its source beyond the Indian frontiers
flows for nearly 800 kilometres before
descending to the Indian plains. Simi¬
larly, the routes to Kashmir, which had -i r
become a chief centre of Buddhist | Jj
learning since Emperor Ashoka's time
(273-232 B.C.), were well marked by
Buddhist pilgrims.

The recent discovery of terracotta figures dating back to
300 B.C. confirms the early origins of art in Nepal, a country
whose climates and terrains (including Everest, the world's
highest peak) are as varied as the ethnic origins of its people.
For unbroken centuries, Nepal was an illustrious centre of
the arts. Masterpieces of its painting and sculpture are
preserved In the country's temples and monasteries.
This graceful 10th century limestone sculpture,
"Nativity of the Buddha", from Kathmandu, recalls the style
of paintings in the Ajanta caves, in central India.

These were and still are formid¬
able footpaths winding their way
through high snowy passes of great
beauty and grandeur and equally
great hardship. These ancient tracks
in the western Himalaya were among
the footpaths I was able to partly
retrace in the course of my 35 major
expeditions through the entire mountain
ranges from Kashmir in the west to
Bhutan in the east (see map page 6).
By this time I had already covered
picturesque Nepal, a journey which
was indeed stimulating because every
nook and corner in the Kathmandu
valley is studded with marvellous
pieces of art; but I did not feel before
that overwhelming impact of the envir¬
onments which apparently brought
forth Himalayan art, until I saw the
awe-inspiring peaks of mighty splen¬
dour in western Himalaya.
For example, as I crossed the diffi¬
cult Rohtang pass (4,100 metres),
where the river Beas is born, I at once
came face to face with a mass of snow-
covered peaks which like ocean waves
extend beyond the horizon. The green
luxuriance of pines and foliage of the
foothills (Siwalik) disappears and below
the brilliant ice line of mountain sum¬
mits are the deep valley bottoms of
brownish rocks which are completely
destitute of vegetation of any kind.
This area (typical of Ladakh) is like
a vast desert, and it is mostly in these
mountain belts that several of the Bud¬
dhist monasteries are situated.
Both Hinduism and Buddhism have
a strong monastic emphasis and it was
inevitable that these institutions, which
by tradition were set up in isolated
areas, but on major trade routes,
should become the basis of religious
life in the Himalaya and also the
centres of art, education and culture.
The Himalayan monasteries and tem¬
ples containing incredibly beautiful
works of art are invariably situated
along the intersections of the enormous
high valleys, which are formed by the
two great rivers, the Indus and the
Brahmaputra, flanking in the west and
in the east the valleys of rivers such
as the Sutlej, Ganges, Jamuna, Kali,
Bhagmati, Tista, Sankosh, etc., which
flow across the mountains roughly from
north to south.
This is why, except in some regions
of the western Himalaya, it is mostly
impossible to travel laterally from west
to east or vice versa. Therefore, before
embarking on each new expedition I
had to return to the "bases" i.e. Cal¬
cutta in the east and New Delhi in the
west. It is not possible even to go
from western Bhutan to the eastern
part of the country without going
through the Indian plains, unless of
course one is prepared to undertake a
journey of over a month with all the
hardships thrown in.
In these circumstances the cross
currents of history and styles of art
forms have reached these regions
slowly in time with the pace of the
trade caravans that still traverse the

THE WHEEL OF EXISTENCE
Ladakh, in the lap of the majestic snow-covered
Karakoram mountains, in north-east Kashmir,
is a region of desolate valleys, almost impenetrable
gorges and vast glaciers. With an area of
about 117,000 square kilometres, Ladakh has a
population of barely 88,000. This province of
the ancient Kushan Empire (see article page 4)
is an age-old route from India to Central Asia,
linked to the great Silk Route. Buddhism
reached Ladakh in the second century B.C. Monasteries
founded down the centuries were embellished
with paintings and sculpture of great beauty.

HIMALAYAN ART (Continued)

deep river valleys and the tortuous
passes of Ladakh, Himachal Pradesh,
Nepal, Sikkim and Bhutan. It was the
caravans and pilgrims that carried the
culture of India into the Himalaya, pre¬
dominantly from the Buddhist centres
of Kashmir and the great monastic
institutions of the Ganges basin in
Bihar and Bengal.
As Buddhism fanned out through the
Himalaya to become the religion of
all Asia, its art models carried on
painted banners by pilgrims also tra¬
versed the "silk routes" of Central
Asia and later reached Tibet, whence
they slowly turned back upon the
Himalayan kingdoms of Bhutan and
Sikkim as late as the fifteenth and
sixteenth centuries a one-millennium
journey covering a linear distance of
about six hundred kilometres. It is as
if the love songs of medieval Provence
had finally reached the Hebrides last
year.
My journeys in Bhutan and particu¬
larly the western part of Sikkim were
the toughest even though the foot¬
paths in these regions are at much
lower heights than in the western Hima¬
laya. There are monasteries such as
Tak-sang or "Tiger's nest" in Bhutan
hanging at a thousand feet on a ver¬
tical rock face, and approached by
narrow footsteps cut out in the rock.
For me the frustrating part of labor¬
iously climbing up to some of these
shrines was not so much the effort and
fatigue but often the deep disappoint¬
ment of not finding any art object of
merit or data to suit my purpose. Tak-
sang monastery is a case in point.
But at other times I was fully com¬
pensated when I discovered some
lovely masterpieces of art at the most
unexpected localities. For example,
while trekking in western Bhutan from
the monastery of Wangdu Phodrang to
the famous castle-monastery of Pun-
akha, I accidentally came across the
small but most lovely shrine of Bajo
containing some of the finest earlier
examples of the Buddha figure in
Bhutan.
To give readers some idea of the
rough going in western Sikkim, I will
briefly describe one such visit to
the monastery of Sinon.
There is a fairly good jeepable road
from the Sikkimese capital Gangtok to
the Pemiangtse monastery, where the
present ruler of Sikkim once served as
a lama. About five kilometres from
Pemiangtse, however, the only access
to Tashi Dhing monastery on the way
to Sinon shrine is a narrow footpath
which winds along an almost vertical
cliff overlooking a river.
This track is not even wide enough
for mules and hence my interpreter and
the five porters carrying our baggage
had to walk about five kilometres to a
point where a messenger boy had been
sent the day before to arrange for
some mules for our ascent to the mon¬
asteries of Tashi Dhing and Sinon.
Hardly had we set out on the journey
when I slipped and fell. If it were not
for a sturdy bush three metres below,
this article would not have seen the
light of day. I then had to take off my
shoes and walk barefooted on burning
hot slates for the rest of this torment¬
ing trek. The agony was prolonged
when the mules did not show up, and
having come to a point of no return,
and because of blisters on my feet, I
wrapped jute rags around my feet to
scale a steep slope of another five
kilometres to Tashi Dhing monastery.
A kilometre indeed is a very long dis¬
tance in these regions.
Exhausted from the climb, heat and
altitude, I never felt so comforted in
my life as when I dipped my blistered
feet in a bowl of hot water with salt,
which was offered to me by the Head
Lama. Hsuan Tsang, the noted Chi¬
nese Buddhist pilgrim who visited
India in the 7th century, has described
this method of hospitality at the monas¬
teries in his famous memoirs, and it
is amazing how in the 20th century
in some parts of the world such
practices can still have their comfort¬
ing validity.
FrROM Tashi Dhing to Sinon
is another four kilometres of steeper
climb and there, against the back¬
ground of the eternal snows of Kan-
chenjunga (8,578 metres), is the
ancient monastery of Sinon contain¬
ing some of the loveliest wall-paintings
in Sikkim.
One of the most beautiful paintings
here is that of the donor princess Pedi
Wangmo (see colour photo opposite),
the half-sister of the ruler Chador
Namgyal, who was born in 1686. In a
bizarre plot, reminiscent of medieval
Europe, Pedi Wangmo had conspired
with a Tibetan doctor who assassinat¬
ed Chador Namgyal by opening one of
the ruler's arteries, thus causing him
to bleed to death. A troop of soldiers
pursued the princess to Namchi
(another important monastery which I
visited), where the doctor was execut¬
ed and.Pedi Wangmo was strangled
to death with a. silk scarf.
However,, images of secular import,
such as those of donors like Princess
Pedi Wangmo, are few. The art of
the Himalaya is largely a religious art
and from 'the time of the Indus valley
culture in the 3rd millennium B.C. to
the present day, it has been largely
devoted to the making of images of
deities.
Hinduism has many gods, and each
of these gods has many forms; but
this vast pantheon was ordered, syste¬
matized and standardized in the ancient
holy text books, mostly of the Gupta
period (4th to 6th centuries A.D.).
Every form of each of the gods is assi¬
gned a special shape, particular colours
and individual attributes, and all holy
¡mages have to be made to exact
specifications.
The three major gods at the top of
the Hindu pantheon known as the
Hindu trinity are Brahma, Shiva and
Vishnu, but in the art of the Himalaya
Shiva and Vishnu are by far the most
popular.
The philosophy of Shiva, a god of
creative energy, is particularly applic¬
able in the mountains, and in his more
terrible aspect he is frequently evoked
as a protector deity who will save the
people from their enemies and from
natural disasters.
Vishnu, on the other hand, appears
in more peaceful and joyful forms in
most of his ten incarnations. In some
of these he is half-man, half-animal,
but his best loved manifestation is that
of Krishna, the flute-playing country
boy whose love for the cowgirl, Radha,
is one of the most popular themes in
painting.
Similarly, the Buddhist faith is the
inspiration and reason for Himalayan

It hangs in the main chapel of the
monastery of Sinon, in western Sikkim,
which was built under Pedi Wangmo's
patronage. Sikkim's art was most
successful when its painters were able
to break through ' imposed formalism,
and portray with individuality and relative
freedom what they saw -,nd felt.

the Wheel of Existence, which shows
the world's unreality, to which every
living being is Inextricably bound.

HIMALAYAN ART (Continued)
art but the form of Buddhism that
was carried to the mountains around
the eighth century A.D. by Padmasam¬
bhava bears scant resemblance to the
simple teachings that had been set
forth about twelve hundred years be¬
fore by the historic Buddha, Siddhar-
tha Gautama.
What the Himalayan people received
was Buddhism in the vastly elaborated
form it had taken during its long
settlement in India. By the early years
of the Christian Era the historic Buddha
was deified and elevated into an eter¬
nal, absolute, primordial principle. At
the same time Indian Buddhism not
only permitted the use of idols but
took over a vast array of deities from
the Hindu religion.
The branch of Buddhism that became
most popular in the Himalaya was
Vajrayana. Vajrayana worship relied
on magical formulas and magical cere¬
monies and on the introduction of
goddesses (Taras) and Buddhas-to-be
(Bodhisattvas) to the ever-expanding
Buddhist pantheon. Popularly known
as Lamaism, this branch of the religion
taught that the devotee could summon
up a huge number of imagined deities
by means of certain magical formulas.
Both in Hindu and in Buddhist Tan-
trie beliefs, the duality of the sexes was
developed with particular emphasis.
One of the cardinal doctrines was the
worship of the spiritual-sexual prin¬
ciple: the union of opposites. < Dhyana,
or meditation as abstract thought, was
regarded as the male principle, which
remained inert until activated by a cos¬
mic female energy (Shakti, or Prajna).
By the eighth century, when Bud¬
dhism reached Tibet, Vajrayana was
practically the only form of Buddhism
that still survived in India, its strong¬
holds located in such famous monastic
institutions as Nalanda and Vikrama-
shila. From these monasteries Gau¬
tama's ancient creed, now metamor¬
phosed into Tantric Buddhism, came to
the Himalaya, where today it still sur¬
vives, being in fact the state religion
of Sikkim and Bhutan.
In the remote monasteries of the
Himalaya, Vajrayana, - or Tantric Bud¬
dhism and its art underwent further
change, largely in spirit, when it
encountered natives who believed then,
and believe now, in demons, sorcery,
and the pervasive presence of malevo¬
lent spirits.

In the 18th century, Himalayan painters
and sculptors abandoned the strict
rules of religious iconography, gave
free rein to their imagination and drew
inspiration from folk art. The result
has been some extraordinary works
of art fresh in modernism. In painting,

a legendary monster, Yama, is being led

The people of Ladakh have long placed faith In protector deities.
In Tantric Buddhism, the most fearless of these deities Is Yamantaka,
often represented as an eagle (above) and a yak (below), as shown
in these striking 15th-16th century paintings in Ladakh's Thikse
monastery. Situated astride the major trade routes, the monasteries
and temples became centres of art, education, and culture. Artists
had to rely on Indian merchants for their pigments, especially carmine
and Indigo. The Tibetan polygrapher, Taranatha, records that
part of the duty which was paid by traders as transit fees in Nepal,
consisted of paints for local artists.

In a lonely corner of many of Bhutan's monasteries, a small dark room
hung with the skins, teeth and claws of animals enshrines a statue called
a "Bhayankara", the effigy of an enemy. The one seen above is in the
monastery of Wangdu Phodrang (16th-17th century). Reserved for denizens
of the demoniac world, such rooms are often decorated with paintings
of evil spirits, magicians and witches. Tradition has it that the earliest
settlers in Bhutan's valleys were nomadic tribes from eastern India, but
virtually nothing is known of Bhutan's people and history before the
15th century. At that time refugee craftsmen from Tibet arrived in
Bhutan and set up many workshops for bronze casting. Below,
an 18th century painted statue of Padmasambhava, a guru, or Hindu saint,
at the Pemiangtse monastery, in Sikkim, where this sage is deeply
venerated. Nourished by the influence of Indian, Chinese, Iranian and
Uighurlan (Chinese Turkestan) arts, that of Sikkim flowered in a wide
variety of forms.
HIMALAYAN ART (Continued)
This influence is seen in what are
called Goinkhangs, which are reserved
for the inmates of the demoniac world.
A Goinkhang is usually a small, dark
room in a lonely corner of a monastery,
in the eerie gloom of which are hung
huge skins and the teeth and nails of
animals, as well as the remains of
sacrificial victims or enemies along
with their weapons and armour. The
walls of the room are covered with
paintings of the misshapen forms of
demons, black magicians, witches, fero¬
cious animals, and vultures.
The atmosphere is typically Himal¬
ayan, for these people, after all, spend
their lives under the shadows of the
groaning and cracking sound of des¬
cending glaciers and of great avalan¬
ches tumbling from the mountains. The
paintings are typically Himalayan, too:
although Buddhist art in general had
its terrifying figures, the artists of the
Himalaya had great freedom to enlarge
and improve upon this grotesque
world. Paintings of terrifying gods are
meant to strike terror an emotion that,
temporarily at least, thrusts a man
outside of himself.
The Buddhist concept of the cycle
of births and deaths is enacted here
in all its sorrow and pain until finally
it points the path of nirvana (salvation).
In contrast to the Goinkhang is the
serene, peaceful atmosphere inside
the temple chapels that form the centre
of these monasteries. Paintings on the
walls and ceilings of the chapels depict
either Jatakas, scenes of events from
Gautama Buddha's life, or portraits of
Tantra gurus (Siddhas). The gurus
were the most eminent esoteric per¬
sonalities of medieval India, and they
provide ¡deal links between Hindu and
Buddhist Tantricism.
The wall-paintings are done either
directly on the dry plaster not, as
Western frescos are, in wet plaster
or upon canvas glued to the walls.
The temple walls are also hung with
cloth paintings and brilliant brocade
banners. The focal point of the cha¬
pels is the altar, which holds large
enthroned images of gilded stucco or
brass. Incense burns at one side, and
oil lamps provide the only light apart
from a few small windows and the
main door.
Because Tantric art is meant to serve
a religious, rather than an aesthetic
purpose, and because artists believed
that they acquired spiritual merit by
copying prototypes, the art has not
greatly changed over the centuries.
The emphasis is not on style but on
iconography.
The earliest known motif is the naked
Siva prototype, with phallus erect, who
sits in a Yoga posture. First seen in
the Indus valley civilization of the third
millennium B.C., its corollaries are the
representation of fierce deities, the
protector gods, who are often por¬
trayed with blue or black skin and set
in furious scenes suitable to the deep-
seated demonism that formed the
Himalaya's aboriginal faith.

Human and animal forms of a more or less mythological nature, floating in space as
if engaged on some mysterious quest, are elements in a "Tantric Manifestation of Symbols",
a painting at the Thikse monastery, Ladakh (see page 17). A later form of Hinduism,
Tantricism gave birth to a wealth of separate symbolic elements which coalesce and then
disintegrate only to join together once more in new symbolic forms. Tantric artists
were thus increasingly able to abandon classical figurative representations and to
create an art rich in colour and line symbolism.

The vivacity of
Philippine folk ballet
I HE Republic of the Philippines
is more than a meeting place for East and
West: its 7,000 islands, grouped in a rough
triangle in the Pacific Ocean, form a
crucible in which Asian and European
cultures have combined with the tradi¬
tional Philippine way of life to produce
a national heritage of infinite variety and
vitality.
Interpreting this kaleidoscopic culture
through music and dance is the mission
of the Bayanihan Philippine Dance Com¬
pany, which was established in 1956 to
stimulate interest among Filipinos in their
national folklore.
"Bayanihan" is a Tagalog word mean¬
ing the ancient custom of working to¬
gether. In fact, it is a way of life among
the rural populations, born out of the
need of a people with meagre resources
to band together to achieve their goals:
its symbol is a house being moved on
the shoulders of neighbours.
This is the spirit in which the company
was formed, in which it grew, and with
which it remains imbued today. There
are no stars, and the dancers are not
professionals.
The Bayanihan Company itself was
part of a much broader movement which
gained momentum after World War II,
when the President of the Philippines
set up a special cultural committee to
study folk customs and traditions on a
national scale.
The man who gave special impetus to
this movement was Alejandro R. Roces
(now president of the Unesco National
Commission of the Philippines) who
directed the committee and arranged for
special teams to tour the country and
record and study the traditional dances,
customs and folklore in the islands and
mountain areas.
The opportunity which catapulted the
Bayanihan Philippine Dance Company to
international prominence was provided in
1958, when these gifted young dancers

PHILIPPINE FOLK BALLET (Continued)
responded to a government appeal for
a cultural programme to represent the
Philippines at the World's Fair at Brus¬
sels, Belgium.
The artistry with which this spirited
young ensemble presented its country's
ancient and contemporary dances in
Brussels, the scope and diversity of
their repertoire embracing Philippine,
Arabic, Malayan, Spanish and American
elements their colourful costumes,
and the subtlety of their dancing were
aspects which enchanted the specta¬
tors and showed that Bayanihan was
a most effective way of projecting to
the world an impression of the past
and present facets of Philippine life.
In 1959, the company was desig¬
nated to "officially represent the Philip¬
pines as cultural mission to the Amer¬
icas and Europe for one year. . .", and
in 1960, they won the special critics
award for folk ensembles at the Fête
des Nations in Paris. Since then,
regular tours abroad have been org¬
anized; the latest, In 1968, took Bayan¬
ihan to North America, Latin America
and Europe, where their programme, '
incorporating many new dances, was
acclaimed by audiences and critics
alike.
At least as important as its Inter¬
national tours are Bayanihan's activities
at home. Through weekly recitals and
visits to the country's far-flung islands,
it is playing a major part in stimulat¬
ing renewed interest among the people
of the Philippines in their diverse folk
dances and customs.
This task was started back in the
1930s by an informal group called the
Filipiniana Folk Music and Dance Com¬
mittee, which was begun at the Philip¬
pine Women's College now a uni¬
versity to preserve and encourage
the folk music of the islands. Out of
this committee grew the Bayanihan
Folk Arts Centre, formed in Manila to
do research on Philippine culture, to
preserve the country's art forms and
promote their use in daily life, and
to organize the dance company's per¬
formances at home and abroad.
Although traditional dances are "re¬
novated" before being presented, their
authenticity is assured by the work
of a team of researchers who often
travel far through the woods of the
south Philippine islands, or over the
mountains of the northern regions in
search of ancient dances kept alive by
isolated villages.
Mrs. Lucrecia Urtula, the dance di¬
rector and choreographer of Bayanihan,
acts quickly when word comes through
that a festival is to be held In a
distant jungle or mountain clearing.
Most of the indigenous festivals are
religious in character and tied closely
to the seasons. To pass up the
chances to see one, film its dances
and tape record its music often means
an opportunity lost for at least a year.
Along with the music and the steps
of the dances, the researchers are
anxious to duplicate the original cos¬
tumes. This sometimes presents a
problem. In one of the southern

dimensions correspond to classic tragedy.
Against a background of lightning and thun¬
der, a poet and chorus intone, and symboli¬
cally weave into a tapestry, a plot of love,
jealousy and retribution. The favourite wife
of the Datu, or chief, of the Tagabili tribe
on the island of Mindanao (centre figure in

younger brother. After she reveals her true
feelings during a dance with her husband

combat (below) and slays him. As punish¬
ment, his young daughter falls ill. Accord¬
ing to Tagabili belief, she can be saved
only through marriage. Neighbouring tribes

and minutes later we bumped to a
standstill on an improvised landing
strip.
For twenty minutes a jeep rattled
my bones over a corrugated track
and suddenly we were in the outskirts
of a dusty little town. It was Gonabad.
Here dwell some 8,000 people, in a
township which has achieved unsought
importance as headquarters for all the
rescue and relief services concentrated
in the earthquake zone; here, too, had
been set up the camp for the team of
Unesco scientists at work in the area.
A feature of this town and of villages
in the region is the brick tower atop
many of the houses. The tower is
closed on three sides; the open side,
which faces the prevailing wind, Is
divided into vertical compartments and
these extend down through the roof of
the house to form an ingenious ventil¬

The earthquake which shook the Iranian province of Khorassan on August 31, 1968
lasted perhaps ten seconds, yet it killed between 12,000 and 16,000 people and
rendered 150,000 homeless. Below left, gleaming tiled dome of a medieval mosque

notorious seismic regions of our planet.

WHEN THE EARTH SHOOK (Continued)
As if a giant mole had burrowed beneath the surface
houses are the domed roofs. To stand
at roof level among a forest of such
towers and domes is infinitely satisfy¬
ing to the eye, yet most are built of
adobe mud-brick like the houses
beneath, and in this seismic area such
dwellings are nothing less than death
traps, destined to collapse at the first
heavy tremor.
The earthquake which shattered the
peace of a summer's afternoon on
August 31, 1968, lasted perhaps 10 sec¬
onds, yet it killed between 12,000 and
16,000 people and rendered 150,000
homeless and destitute. Some two
hundred and thirty villages were
shaken; several, like Dashti-Biaz, sim¬
ply fell to fragments so completely
that the remains had to be bulldozed
into the earth, leaving only the fruit
trees and a pattern of irrigated fields
to show that people had once lived
there.
A second shock several days later
shattered the large village of Firdos,
and it is a strange twist of fate that this
same Firdos was once a great city
called Toon until, in the year 856, an
earthquake destroyed it and, say the
old chronicles, 45,000 people perished.
I came upon the large village of
Karkhk from the hills which enfold it
and stood for a moment looking down
into a township 'celebrated throughout
Khorassan for its craftsmen 'and as a
holiday resort. I might have been on
the outskirts of an ancient city aban¬
doned centuries ago to the hawks and
jackals.
The effect was heightened by the
remains of a blue-domed mosque lean¬
ing in drunken ruin. Around 1t, window
frames and doorways stared sight¬
lessly from heaps of rubble which had
once been houses. A flutter of torn
curtain was the only indication that
people had lived, loved and worked
there less than a month before. In the
distance a cloud of dust and a low
rumbling marked the presence of a
bulldozer pounding the hulks of build¬
ings back into the earth.
I walked down into what had once
been a town renowned for its beauty.
It was my first sight of the aftermath
of an earthquake "and it took me by the
throat. Here and there men were still
digging among the rubble a month
after the disaster in the vain hope of
recovering the body of a missing rela¬
tive for proper burial, or a few prized
possessions. It was a scene of deso¬
lation. Only the school, strongly built
of baked brick over a metal frame,
stood foursquare, unharmed.

This dramatic photograph shows the effect of the 1968 earthquake at Karkhk In
eastern Iran. The aerial picture taken from 5,500 feet includes an area of cultivated land
set in the hills of Khorassan. Contorted fissures can be seen spreading like tentacles
across the landscape. The original path of the main mountain stream of the town

for its beauty and as a holiday resort. It is now a heap of rubble and ruined
buildings, as photo opposite grimly shows.
tentedly. An old man, its owner,
pointed to the hillock of rubble. "My
wife was there when the mosque began
to vibrate horribly. She felt no fear.
Here in the house of God what harm
could come to her? Then the dome
fell and the lives of twelve women
praying directly beneath were extin¬
guished. She, being in a corner
against the wall, was dug out, unhurt."
He shook his head. "Buried under
there are carpets of great age and
beauty; they should not be forgotten
by the rescuers."
Some 8,000 persons, including many
visitors, had been in Karkhk on that
Saturday afternoon. Within seconds
3,000 were dead and hundreds injured.
The homeless survivors, some 4,000,
I found in a canvas village erected on
the edge of the ruins.
Tents stood row upon row, each sur¬
rounded with household goods rescued
from the rubble pitiful little heaps of
junk, no more. Moving among them,
volunteer workers from the Red Lion
and Sun Society (the Iranian equiva¬
lent of the Red Cross) were handing
out clothing. In the midst of a group
of devout men a mullah was reciting
prayers for the dead, while women
keened softly in the background.
Yet in the midst of tragedy, the place
was vivid with life and movement.
Children played noisily among flutter¬
ing chickens, women were preparing
the mid-day meal on portable stoves
outside each tent, others chattered
animatedly while drawing clear water
from taps placed at regular intervals.
IHIS water supply and a
sewage system vital elements in a
camp of this size if health is to be safe¬
guarded had been installed by the
Health Corps of the Iranian Army ; irri¬
gation channels, roads and bridges had
been repaired by the Extension and
Development Corps. All these young
men with others from the Education
Corps (the "Army of Knowledge") were
conscripts on National Service.
A temporary school was in full cry,
repeating the lessons aloud in the
Iranian fashion, while in a neighbouring
tent some fifty little girls worked on
carpet weaving, sewing and stitching
under the care of án instructress.
Stores were piled on all sides tents,
medical supplies, foodstuffs, cooking
utensils, clothing, much of it donated
by sympathetic countries. A bakery
and a soup kitchen for the volunteer
workers was further evidence of the
speed and efficiency with which the
Red Lion and Sun Society had moved
in on the devastated area.
I was taken to see the main fault,
where the earthquake originated. Snak¬
ing across the plain for 60 kilometres
and beyond through mountain ranges
which bounded the valley to east
and west, it was as if a giant mole had
burrowed just below the surface.
At well-defined points the earth was
thrust upwards, elsewhere it had fallen
below the original level, showing clear¬
ly where forces of compression and
expansion had been released by the
titanic shearing of rocks perhaps
10 kilometres down in the earth's crust.
That the shearing had been a scis¬
soring movement was shown by the
displacement of surface features, such
as irrigation embankments, by as much
as five metres. The ill-starred village
of Dashti-Biaz, for example, had lain
squarely astride the fault at its west¬
ern extremity.

WHEN THE EAÜTH SHOOK (Continued)
Anatomy of a seismic disaster
Imperial College, London, who, to¬
gether with his colleague Dr. J. Tcha-
lenko, Dr. S. Budnov, a Yugoslav
earthquake engineer, and Professor
T. Tassios from the Technical Univer¬
sity of Athens, had been sent out to
Khorassbn by Unesco to trace and
map the ramifications of the "quake".
S

TANDING in that deserted
steppeland Dr. Ambraseys described
what had probably happened some six
miles below our feet. The complex
structure of the earth's crust in mount¬
ainous regions of a certain nature
gives rise to internal pressure of un¬
imaginable intensity, pressures which
generate energy on a vast scale.
The pressures build up until there
comes a moment when something gives
. way a weak point, or geological fault.
It can be likened to a stretched spring
with a flaw in its steel the spring
breaks at that point and the stored
energy is released. So with the
earth. The imprisoned energy breaks
out with cataclysmic violence, shearing
the rocks and giving rise to powerful
vibrations in the crust which travel
outwards in all directions like waves
in a pond.
It is these vibrations which shake
the foundations of buildings to the
point of collapse. A curious feature
of some earthquakes, as I saw for my¬
self in Khorassan, is that buildings
quite close to the source of the earth¬
quake, say within a kilometre or so, are
damaged but do not collapse, while
others, fifteen or twenty kilometres off,
fall into ruins.
The reason for this seeming paradox
Is that near to the source the shock is
violent but short; as the distance
increases so does the violence de¬
crease but the period of shaking length¬
ens and may last as long as 20 or
30 seconds. Only buildings designed
to be earthquake resistant can stand
up to prolonged shaking of this kind.
Hence the presence of Ambraseys
and his colleagues. Earthquake
engineers can recommend various
categories of structures which while
using local materials as far as possible
will be less vulnerable to earthquake
shock.
That crack snaking across the des
erted plain exhibited a detachment
from man and his works that I found
terrifying. It would have made no
difference had a city of two million
souls lain in its path. And far below
the surface those uncontrollable forces
were still active. Later, in a tent not
10 miles away, I was to listen to the
cracking and tearing of the earth's
crust as the vestiges of pent-up ener¬
gy sought to release the strain and
restore equilibrium.
These "micro-shocks", the invariable
aftermath of an earthquake, had been
recorded by a group of three men from
the Geophysical Laboratories of the
Institute of Geological Sciences, Edin¬
burgh: a seismologist. Dr. Stuart Cram-
pin, and two assistants. At Unesco's
instigation they had brought to this
remote corner of Asia a collection of
electronic apparatus which represent¬
ed the last word in earthquake
detection.
An R.A.F. Hercules transport had
flown them out to Teheran together
with the out-size truck bearing their
equipment. This monster had been
edged into the aircraft with less than
an inch to spare between it and the
roof of the Hercules. From Teheran
they had nursed their delicate load
of instruments across 1,000 miles of
Iran to the scene of the disaster and
there at the foot of a mountain they
had set up their camp.
0 N the slope 100 feet or so
above, a flame-coloured tent marked
the location of a group of three seismo¬
meters (earthquake detectors) and the
Ultra High Frequency and Very High
Frequency radio receivers. These lat¬
ter were tuned to two out-stations set
up by the Edinburgh men 20 and
50 kilometres away respectively, which
were detecting earth tremors and
transmitting the data by automatic
radio back to the central camp.
Analysis of the three sets of signals
made it possible to take bearings and
so to pin-point the source of the
"events", as they are termed. The
signals are recorded on magnetic tape
by a machine with no less than twenty-
one recording heads, and by speeding
up the playback of the recorded signals
some fifty-six times the earthquake
shocks become audible and one can
actually hear the rocks being torn
asunder far below the surface.
However, this spectacular device is
really no more than a convenient
method of monitoring and storing the
signals; the actual hour-by-hour record
and analysis of shocks is printed on a
continuous paper strip by an ingenious
electrical device known as a jet-pen
recorder.
Incidentally, I was startled to spot
an electric vacuum cleaner inside the
tent housing the apparatus, not to
mention a carpet on the floor. None
of this, I was assured, implied exag¬
gerated leanings towards domesticity
but was essential to keep down dust,
a grain of which could put the record¬
ers out of action.
IHE seismometers lay in a
rocky hole, deceptively simple cylin¬
ders in appearance, yet capable of de¬
tecting tremors on the far side of the
earth my footsteps on the nearby
mountain face showed up as violent
disturbances on the paper record.
Two weeks after the original shock
the scientists had recorded no less
than 400 after-shocks daily; at the
time of my visit, a month after the
disaster, 100 "events" were still being
recorded in 24 hours. This manifesta¬
tion of science at its most sophisticat¬
ed level among the wastelands of
eastern Iran was, to me, in the best
traditions of science fiction. Yet in
that camp there was nothing of fiction
or fantasy in a routine geared exclu¬
sively to scientific observation and
analysis.
The question may be asked: why go
to all this trouble and expense? If
ever it becomes possible to predict
earthquakes it can only be through
the amassing and study of a vast
amount of data in relation to the seis¬
mic regions of the world, painstakingly
collected by scientific observation and
measurement.
A great earthquake and its after¬
shocks offer an opportunity of collect¬
ing vital information in a short time,
provided you can get equipment to
the spot soon enough; on the other
hand, the engineers concerned with
the design of earthquake-resistant
buildings can also obtain from the ins-

pection of damage factual Information
on which they can test their theories
about the behaviour of different kinds
of buildings under seismic stresses.
In some places, even today, It would
be possible to forecast the likelihood
of a seismic disturbance but not, unfor¬
tunately, its time or intensity. Never¬
theless in an unstable area of that
kind and with such information avail¬
able a planning authority would be
well advised to steer clear of major
constructional works such as new
towns, nuclear power plants or hydro¬
electric stations. Or if building is
unavoidable, then it should be earth¬
quake resistant both in design and
construction.
Obviously earthquakes must be stud¬
ied on the spot, and as soon as pos¬
sible after a disaster. To locate, co¬
ordinate and organize the transport of
a team of specialists seismologists,
geologists and earthquake engineers
literally at a few hours notice is beyond
the scope of most Individual countries.
It has become an international opera¬
tion with Unesco at the centre of a
communications network which strad¬
dles the globe.
w.ITHIN an hour or so of a
major earthquake the scientist respon¬
sible at Unesco Headquarters is noti¬
fied, at any hour of the day or night. He
immediately makes contact with indivi¬
dual specialists. They form a pool, as
it were, of scientists and engineers
who stand ready to drop everything
and take off for the scene of the
disaster. They could come from as
many as half a dozen countries.
On returning to their universities or
institutes they prepare detailed reports
of their findings and conclusions which
are published by Unesco and distri¬
buted to the interested bodies in all
member states. This was the pro¬
cedure followed in the Khorassan
earthquake.
Here is an instance of science in
the service of mankind, working unob¬
trusively for the prevention of death.
And as the corpus of knowledge
grows, we may look forward to a time
when the appalling human misery of
a Khorassan, a Skopje or an Agadir
will be a thing of the past.

Amassing and analysing vital scientific data following a major
earthquake such as the Khorassan disaster has become an
International operation co-ordinated by the earthquake emergency
service operated by Unesco from its Paris headquarters.
Within hours of a serious earth tremor this service can contact
and despatch to the stricken area a group of scientists and
engineers. The tent, above, pitched on the edge of a vast
plain in Iran is an outpost used by seismologists of a Unesco
mission carrying out a scientific Investigation of the Khorassan

HIMALAYAN ART
(Continued from page 24)
Another characteristic motif is the
ever popular Mithuna, or lovers, some¬
times in sexual embrace. Depicted in
a variety of forms, these are known
in Tibet as the "yab-yum", or mother-
father couple. A third anthropomorphic
theme is the human-animal configura¬
tion, in which the deity appears as
half-human and half-ánimal.
An ensemble of these cardinal motifs
and several other subsidiary symbols
popular in- the Himalaya is the Wheel
of Life. First seen in a Gupta period
painting at the Ajanta caves in India,
the Wheel of Life sums up both pic-
torially and philosophically the Hindu
and Buddhist view of life and the
causes of human sorrow.
Cultural influences from great civi¬
lizations have reached the Himalaya
only after a considerable time lag,
because of the hardships in the paths
of travellers, but similarly the ultimate
decline of its traditions has been delay¬
ed by geographical isolation. Even
today in the great river valleys ringed
by the gigantic mountain ranges can
be found traces of culture, which are
derived from those of northern and
central India and remain closely allied
to them.
But the isolation, the geographical
hardship and the grandeur of the area,
have given the beliefs and the cul¬
ture that expresses them a magnifi¬
cence and mystery of their own. The
masterpieces of ancient art preserved
in the Himalayan monasteries and tem¬
ples reflect great periods in the history
of Asia and the world in the same way
as the ruins of Pompeii give an insight
into the civilization of Rome at its
height.
PHILIPPINE FOLK BALLET

regions, they saw beautiful beaded
attire and, in order to guarantee the
authenticity of the costumes to be
reproduced, by Bayanihan's seam¬
stresses, they asked if they could buy
a model costume. The tribesmen
agreed, and the Philippine Women's
University footed the bill. . . six horses.
As important as the audio and visual
aspects of the dances are their his¬
tories, and the researchers from the
Folk Arts Centre closely question the
original performers about their back¬
ground and origins. These interviews
often must be conducted through in¬
terpreters, for 87 dialects are spoken
in the Philippines.
In addition to tape recordings and
films of local musicians playing in the
authentic manner, the field study trips
have yielded a full set of Philippine
musical instruments. Local masters
teach the Bayanihan musicians how to
play such unusual instruments as the
kulintangan, a set of eight graduated
gongs used by Muslim Filipinos, the
bamboo xylophone called the gabbang,
and the balingging, a bamboo flute
blown with the nostril.
After a field trip, Mrs. Urtula faces
the delicate and sometimes monu¬
mental task of choreographing local
dances so that they can be presented
on a modem stage to international
audiences, and at the same time remain
truly representative of the culture from
which they evolved.
For instance, the Pagdiwata, a rice
planting dance discovered on the
western island of Palawan, ¡s a forty-
eight hour performance that had to be
condensed, shaped and moulded into
a theatrical piece. The most important
aspects of the two day marathon were
selected and co-ordinated from the
tapes and films made in the field, and
the final result is a dramatic, seven
minute dance highlighted by the state¬
ly whirling of the high priestess and
her attendants, who bear lighted
candles on their heads and on the
backs of their hands, joined in a prayer
of thanksgiving for a bountiful harvest,
and supplication for continued protec¬
tion and favour.
Most of the dancers are in their
teens or early twenties. They are
admitted into the company only after
strict auditions, and if they marry they
must leave. To ensure a reservoir of
young talent, the Bayanihan Folk Arts
Centre has a regular programme of
training for young men and women
from whose ranks are chosen the
members of the dance company. This
may help explain the youthful and
dynamic quality of the troupe, which
has impressed spectators throughout
the world.
Providing facilities for research,
recruitment and training is the Philip¬
pine Women's University, in whose en¬
vironment Bayanihan first flourished,
and which continues to play a major
part in its success.
The panorama that Bayanihan un¬
folds to its audiences affords an oppor¬
tunity of seeing folk art which, more
than a preservation of the past, is a
functioning, essential part of the Philip¬
pines of today. The myriad styles and
techniques, ranging from fierce, primi¬
tive dances and displays of prowess,
through stately social dances or reli¬
gious ceremonials, to folk antics and
bursts of dazzling virtuosity, are all
Philippine in origin, and yet testify to
the cultural calling cards that have
been left in this nation of islands east
of the Asian land mass.
Asia's growing road network
To complete the ten main routes
projected in its Five Year Plan, the Asian
Highway System needs $440 million in
external aid to supplement the $500 mil¬
lion contributed by the participating
countries. It is hoped to reach the
goal of minimum International road con¬
nexions joining the nations of the most
populated region of the world within two
to three years.
Well-suited
for 300 degrees C.
A new lightweight fire protection suit,
claimed to protect its wearer at tem¬
peratures over 300 degrees centigrade, has
been developed in Sweden. Made of
rayon and alumlnized polyester, It has been
designed to repel 98 per cent of radiation
heat through reflection. It gives the
wearer great freedom of movement In
emergencies, such as rescuing people
from car or airplane wrecks, because of
its light weight and design.
50 years
of Byelorussia
0.JN January 1, 1969, the Byelo¬
russian Soviet Socialist Republic, one of
the 125 member states of Unesco and a
co-founder of the United Nations, cele¬
brated the 50th anniversary of Its creation.
Formerly a backward, Illiterate and
agrarian outskirt of czarist Russia, Bye¬
lorussia has become a developed country
whose industrial goods are now on sale
in 80 countries the world over.
What is Byelorussia now?
It is one of the 15 sovereign republics,
which make up the Soviet Union, situated
almost in the heart of the European
continent with its capital at Minsk (pop.
772,000).
It is 207,500 sq. km. of dense forests,
picturesque fields, bottomless swamps and
countless rivers which, if put together in
length, could run around the Equator
several times.
It has 9 million people, mostly Byelo¬
russians, who, by their culture, language
and origin, are very close to the Russian
and Ukrainian nations.
It is the only republic in the U.S.S.R.
whose population has not yet reached the
pre-war figure because 2,500,000 people,
or every fourth inhabitant, died during the
Second World War.
It is a land (called the "Hartfsan Re¬
public" during the war) which has virtually
arisen, Phoenix-like, from the ashes of war
after the 1941-44 invasion of the Nazi
armies, and had to start to build almost
everything from scratch all over again.
It has 76 Industrial centres, ranking
second in the U.S.S.R. for production of
lorries, motorcycles, watches and clocks,
and ¡s a major producer of potatoes, flax,
hemp and wheat.
Its Academy of Sciences boasts
30 research institutes and laboratories; in

45 years in Canada, Austria, Denmark,
Finland, Federal Republic of Germany,
Hungary, Sweden and Switzerland, accord¬
ing to a World Health Organization report
for 1955-1966. Suicide rates are highest
among men, especially those aged 75, or
over.
Unesco and its programme
Unesco has just published the first two
brochures in a series entitled "Unesco and
its Programme." The brochures, "The Right
to Education" and "Teachers for the Schools
of Tomorrow" are available in English,
French or Spanish editions. Priced at
$1.00; 6/- or 3.50 F, they can be ordered
from Sales Section, Unesco, Place de Fon¬
tenoy, Paris-7e. For distribution to schools,
libraries, non-governmental organizations
and other educational bodies, specimen
copies can be obtained, free of charge,
from Unesco's Public Liaison Division.
Besides its professional orchestras and
theatre and ballet companies, Byelorussia
has many amateur groups in which over
360,000 adults and young people devote
themselves to the performing arts. Here,
young amateur musicians play the tsymbaly,

four million copies; in 1967, It produced
2,000 book titles accounting for 22 million
copies.
In the steps of
Hans Christian Andersen
The town of Sestri Levante, on the
Italian Riviera, where the famous Danish
writer of fairy tales, Hans Christian Ander¬
sen, lived for many years, has established
a competition open to Italian and Danish
writers. The 1968 Andersen Prize for the
best fairy tale of the year has been
awarded to Maria Remiddi, managing
editor of the Italian edition of the "Unesco
Courier," for her story "The King's Testa¬
ment." Gold medals were awarded to the
Danish writers Arne Hartmann and
Gudrun Hangor.

In its latest global report, "The Ark Under
Way," the World Wildlife Fund, set up
In 1961 as an International organization for
saving the world's wildlife and wild places,
notes encouraging progress in the work it
accomplished between 1965 and 1967. By
the end of 1967, the Fund had financed
183 conservation projects, mostly in Africa.
In "The Ark Under Way," Peter Scott,
chairman of the Fund, recalls that out of
some 200 species of animals that have
disappeared In the last 2,000 years, 38 per
cent have become extinct in the last
50 years. He urges more research in
ecology, more land to be set aside as
sanctuaries and, above all, education to
promote wildlife conservation.
Unesco science prize
for British inventor
Prof. R.S. Silver, British inventor of the
multi-stage flash distillation process for
desalting sea water, was awarded the
Unesco Science Prize for 1968 at a cere¬
mony in Unesco House, on November 5,
1968. He is the first winner of the
$3,000 prize, established for "outstanding
contributions to the technological develop¬
ment of a developing Member State or
region." In the multi-stage flash distillation
process, which can be used with both
atomic reactor and ordinary fuels, sea
water is heated under pressure, and when
the pressure is released it suddenly
"flashes" into steam, which condenses
into fresh water. First installed in Kuwait
in 1957, the system has since been set
up in many other countries.
Flashes...
Under its recent "Manifesto on the
Conservation of Nature and Natural Re¬
sources." the Somali Republic is to intro¬
duce special laws, establish national parks
and nature reserves, and teach conserva¬
tion in schools.
By 1980, there are likely to be 130
million motor vehicles in the United States,
using 107 thousand million gallons of fuel
annually.
The 1968 Unesco painting award has
been won by Spanish artist Manuel Her¬
nandez Mompé for his work "Ansia de
Vivir." The award is made every two
years to honour the work of an outstand¬
ing modern artist.
With 9,652,000 passengers in J 967,
Heathrow, near London, is the worJd's
busiest airport. In 1970, 20 million people
will pass through Heathrow.

RESPECT FOR OTHER FAITHS
Sir.
I should like to see you publish
something on the different religions of
the world. Sometimes, we tend to look
down on other faiths; if we understood
them better, I think we would feel less
superior.

OUR TWELFTH EDITION
Sir,
I was delighted to learn that a
Hebrew edition has been added to the
11 existing languge editions of the
"Unesco Courier". I look forward to
many more years of pleasure from
reading your magazine one of the
world's most remarkable publications.

SYMBOL OF A COSMIC TRUTH
Sir,
I was astonished to see in your issue
on the Ramayana and the Mahabha-
rata (December 1967) that nobody
explained the Ramayana as a veiled
representation of a cosmic truth.
The Ramayana represents the journey
of the soul from the Region of Bliss
down into matter (into desire and lust)
until the deepest point is reached.
Then the Voice of Silence (the Inner
voice conscience) comes as a messen¬
ger from the Ego, and a battle ensues
between the soul and the powers of
evil, with evil finally being conquered.
After his conversion, Man begins his
journey back to the "father-house". At
the end of this journey, he has regain¬
ed the Region of Bliss.
Rama is the soul. That is why his
birth was supernatural. Sita is the
body. That is why she was not born
of woman, but rose up from a furrow
when her father was ploughing a field in
preparation for a sacrifice.
Rama and Sita are banished from
Ayodhya (the Region of Bliss, or heav¬
en), and when they arrive in Dandaka
Forest (the earth), Sita falls prey to
Ravana (evil, lust, desire, ignorance),
and she is taken to Lanka, deep into
the mire of sensual things. Then Rama
sends Hanuman (conscience) to Sita,
and struggles down to meet her. The
battle between good and evil Is Joined,
with Rama fighting the forces of evil.
His adversary, Ravana, is helped by,
among others, Khoembhakarna, the
huge giant who represents sloth (Even
after Man admits the error of his ways,
he must still struggle against sloth and
habit).
When Khoembhakarna is killed, Indra-
jit continues the fight, shooting arrows
which change into poisonous snakes.
The evil powers have the upper hand
until Hanuman fetches the magic herb
from Mount Kalasan (help from on
high meditation, contemplation, .etc.).
Then the final struggle against Ravana
starts. He has ten heads, which must
be cut off at the same time; if only one
head is cut off, it grows back again (If
Man conquers one aspect of evil, he
falls prey to another. Man can triumph
over evil only if he defeats it in all
its aspects). With divine help (the
Brahma weapon), Rama fights with all
his strength and slays Ravana.
After his conversion, Man regards
the body as being intrinsically evil, the
cause of all his troubles. He chas¬
tises- the body (Rama repudiates Sita).
But Sita vindicates herself in an ordeal
by fire. Man must learn that the things
of the body are not in themselves evil;
they are also from God. Only Man's
attitude is evil when he uses his body
with lust, desire and sensuality.
With Sita's exoneration, the body and
soul become, one, and may strive to¬
gether to attain perfection (Be ye there¬
fore perfect, as your Father in heaven
is perfect). In this way, Rama and Sita
regain Ayodhya (Man enters heaven,
the Region of Bliss).
That is the original conclusion of the
epic. The second part is more recent,
and does not belong to the original
story.
Parallels are found with other stories.
Perseus and his mother were banished
from Argos, and Perseus had to over¬
come evil in the person of Polydectes.
The story of Paradise, together with the
Gospel, forms another parallel. And
there are others.
The fact that these stories may also
be interpreted as sun myths takes away
nothing from the cosmic truth they
represent. The sun also descends into
the underworld to fight the powers of
evil.
In this case, Rama is the sun. He
wins his bride by bending a bow; he
suffers for the welfare of others; he
fights against the powers of evil and
darkness; he wins by means of a magic
weapon, which he alone can use.
His bride's name Sita actually means
furrow (e.g. the earth wed to the sun).
This duality of truths was discovered
long ago, and has given birth to the
adage, "So on high, so below".
When thinking about the Ramayana,
the reader will doubtless find, by using
the above key, that many episodes in
the story and many persons become
clearer to him. I was surprised that
among the very learned authors writ¬
ing in the "Unesco Courier", none
explained the Ramayana as the repres¬
entation of an eternal truth.

SCHOLARSHIPS FOR NON-WHITE
SOUTH AFRICANS
Sir,
I wish to thank the students of the
University of East Anglia for establish¬
ing a scholarship fund for the assistance
of non-white South African students
(Letters to the Editor, January 1968).
This scholarship will be a valuable addi¬
tion to the many already offered by
South African trusts to our own people.
A list compiled by the Education In¬
formation Centre (P.O. Box 97) in
Johannesburg to provide information to
prospective and other interested non-
white students, shows that there are
198 separate funds from which one or
more scholarships and bursaries are
awarded annually to non-white students.
Grants and loans are also readily avail¬
able from both universities and training
colleges.
Our association's Students' Aid Fund
is one of the smaller trusts, but its capi¬
tal amount shows a steady increase.
In 1968 we were assisting five non-
white women students, one post grad¬
uate and four undergraduates. In add¬
ition, some of our branches administer
their own bursary funds for non-white
students.
If the students and members of the
Senate of the University of East Anglia
wish any further information on this
subject, I shall be happy to supply it.

HUMAN RIGHTS- AND DUTIES
Sir,
Your number on Human Rights . . .
Tomorrow (November 1968) affirms
that little respect is felt for human
rights today; "... Man is no longer
much in fashion among the leaders of
the nations ..." But was he ever in
fashion? Have these leaders at any
time hesitated to call upon men to des¬
troy each other in the name of God,
Allah, or the Fatherland?
Are not the numerous atrocities com¬
mitted by Man ample evidence that he
should be reminded of his duties as
well as his rights? Man's worth is
measured on the basis of the duties he
has fulfilled, not on the basis of his
rights.

" SORRY I SOLD OUT "
Sir,
Bravo for the issue devoted to Japan
on the occasion of the Meiji Centenary
(September-October 1968). The inter¬
esting articles in every issue not only
give one the satisfaction of learning
something new, but also show clearly
that there are still many problems to be
solved.
I have only one complaint: the diffi¬
culty I have in obtaining your magazine.
When it is due to appear I go day after
day to the bookshop, but on many
occasions finally to hear the bookseller
say, sadly, "I'm sorry, the 'Unesco
Courier' was sold out this morning."
When that happens, all I can do is to
hope for better luck the following month.

ANTIQUE SITE IN PERIL
Sir,
Could you devote an article in a
future issue to the recently discovered
archaeological site at Marseille. It Is
now threatened with being swept away
to make place for modern buildings,
which I think the municipality could erect
elsewhere.

HIDDEN ART
OF THE HIMALAYA
In a rocky wilderness walled in by mighty
Himalayan peaks, 16th century Buddhist monks
founded this religious community, the Kye
monastery, on the northern tip of India.
The Kye monastery and other remote temples
on the slopes of the Himalaya abound in hitherto
virtually unknown masterpieces of painting
and sculpture, recently revealed to the, world
through the expeditions of a venturesome
Indian scholar, Madanjeet Singh
(see story page 14).
