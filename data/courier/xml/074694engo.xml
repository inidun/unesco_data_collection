rO take account of the universality
of human language and of the
diversity of forms which lan¬
guage takes is a task beyond the
possibilities of a magazine. And so, even
if this special issue of the Unesco Courier
resembles a dictionary in its presentation,
readers will not find in it a panoramic
survey, still less a detailed inventory, of
the languages used in the world, nor a
study of the various possible systems of
transcription.
We hope, all the same, that the dozen
or more articles on the following pages
will give readers an impression of the uni¬
ty as well as the phenomenal riches of the
world's treasury of tongues. However,
we have decided to adopt a largely socio-
cultural approach to the problem of
languages, presenting for reflection cer¬
tain points which are particularly signifi¬
cant and which also lie at the heart of
Unesco's thinking and action.
The supreme instrument of com
munication, a tool for teaching and lear¬
ning, a vector of civilization, the spoken
or written language remains the
mainstay, the key to the cultural identity
of both groups and individuals. In this
context, the right to be taught in and to
speak one's mother tongue is a fun¬
damental right, and one which Unesco
stubbornly defends.
Linguistic diversity is seen today, not
as a cause of fragmentation, a hindrance
to effective communication between
cultures, but, through a multitude of in¬
dividual cases, from country to country
and continent to continent, as the precon¬
dition of dialogue between peoples and
cultures.
Time and again, our contributors de¬
nounce the linguistic "racism" which
honours the written above the spoken
word or which judges certain languages
to be innately inferior to others. All of
them, not least the linguists, condemn
these attitudes based on false premises
and stress thefundamental equality of all .
languages that transcends their dif¬
ferences. Any disequilibrium between
languages is always the result of historical
and economic circumstance, never of any
inherent defect in a particular language.
In the last analysis, re-establishing a
language balance is as much a question of
collective as of political will.
To diminish further the world's rich
linguistic diversity, already in part stifled,
would be a dangerous course to take. As
this issue of the Unesco Courier makes
clear, strategies for the preservation of
this diversity are as varied as the situa¬
tions the different languages face; on
their rapid and successful implementa¬
tion depends the development, in the
widest sense of the term, of that diverse
unity mankind.

I. A talking animal
Burgess, Anthony
Our greatest
possession
Man is called in Greek the Zoon
phonanta or talking animal. What
makes humanity different from the
brute creation is its capacity for con¬
structing a system of auditory signs
which stand not only for its thoughts
and feelings about the outside world
but for the outside world itself. You
will say at once that certain birds talk
and some of them, such as mynahs,
talk very well. Chimpanzees can be
taught a number of words and a few
simple linguistic structures. But only
human beings are defined by their
capacity to originate whole languages,
not merely mimic parts of them or han¬
dle a few nouns and verbs. When an
animal began to talk, that animal called
itself man.
We all have a vague, and totally
false, notion of very primitive man
making a few Tarzan grunts and howl¬
ing vocables, usually at the same time
accompanying these gruff melodies on
the drum of his chest. But human
language almost certainly did not begin
like that. It began as a continuous bab¬
ble and it probably began in the dark.
The dark is always frightening,
especially when one is alone in it, and
man learned very early in his career to
maintain the sense of society, the com¬
forting conviction that he was not
alone, when the sun went out and the
moon had not risen and the cave had no
lamp. Speech certainly came before the
discovery of fire. We still tend to use
speech not for conveying messages or
expressing feelings but merely for
establishing and sustaining human
contact.
The anthropologist Malinowski call¬
ed this kind of social speech "phatic
communion", pAcr/Zc deriving from the
Greek phatos, meaning spoken. The
act of speaking, the speech act, serves
primarily the end of sociability. It does
not have to mean anything, but it has to
be continuous. At dinner parties a pro¬
longed silence is the most embarrassing
thing in the world: it seems to indicate
that sociability has failed. It is often
broken by more than one person's
speaking at the same time excuse
me sorry after you no, after
you and what is said is far less impor¬
tant than the fact of somebody having
said something, anything. Everyone
breathes a sigh of relief, especially the
hostess.
We have no means of knowing what
the language of, say, Stone Age man
was like, but we know something of
that ancient language known as Indo-
European or Aryan because its struc¬
ture and some of its vocabulary, much
changed, survive in the daughter
languages, which means most of the
languages of Europe. It seems to have
been a complex language, with a rich
grammar, not at all like Malay or
Chinese, and it is fairly certain that the
further back we go in our study of
language the greater complexities we
find.
The simplification of language is
essentially a part of the modernization
of language: modern English is gram¬
matically much simpler than its
ancestor Anglo-Saxon, and Italian and
Spanish are much simpler than their
mother Latin. It is wrong to think of
the first talkers taking a few linguistic
bricks, cementing them together, then
baking more bricks and adding them to
make a more and more imposing struc¬
ture. An original babble was associated
with a particular feeling or thought,
but it was only in the period after, say,
There no longer seems to be any
doubt either about the deep-
seated unity of all languages
spoken throughout the world or
about the extension of this unity
to all three main aspects of
human language phonological,
syntactical and semantic. The in¬
nate character of the profound
structures in these threefields ap¬
pears to be confirmed.

the break-up of the Roman Empire that
the specialists we call grammarians
began to analyse the component parts
of this babble and come up with terms
like noun, verb, adjective, adverb.
Noam Chomsky, the most impor¬
tant, certainly the most influential,
specialist in linguistic theory that the
post-war period has produced, has sug¬
gested that every human being has built
into his skull an apparatus that equips
him to master the whole of language,
any language. We all say things we
never said before, and without much
conscious effort; we're always inven¬
ting new things to say; we have within
us an apparently infinite capacity for
generating new statements. That is the
great human endowment. This endow¬
ment is based, however, on a very sim¬
ple peculiarity of the human brain its
capacity to think in opposed structures.
Look at it this way: the spectrum has
innumerable colours in it, and one
merges into another. Man learned to
pick out colours as separable items. He
did more; he learned how to make them
into signs of opposed meaning. You
have only to think of a traffic signal to
see that this is so. Now out of the bab¬
ble of noise which the human vocal
system is capable of producing it is
How many languages are there in the world in 1983? The answer depends
on what is meant by language and the way In which languages are differen¬
tiatedfrom dialects. Estimates thus vary between 2,500 and some 5,000.

borch the Elder (1535-1612).

possible to separate specific sounds and
oppose one to the other. Pick does not
mean the same as pig, because /k/ is
opposed to /g/, though those two
sounds only differ (in English, anyway)
in that one is breathed and the other
sung. This structuralist gift of the
human brain enables us to talk of
phonemes (speech sounds) and mor¬
phemes (combinations of phonemes
that convey meaning) tiny structures
that oppose each other in doing
separate jobs and, taken together, add
up to a language.
What interests us most is why a word
should mean what it does. If primitive
man wanted to indicate that something
was high he probably instinctively
stretched up his arm, just as he brought
it down to indicate that something was
low. In other words, he used a mimetic
or imitative faculty. There is no
evidence to show that the physical
gestures which are speech (after all, you
use your vocal organs very athletically
to produce phonemes) were attempts at
imitating the things or actions or feel¬
ings described. Moon and ¡una and
bu¡an suggest something round and
high (the lips pout and the front of the
tongue is raised almost to touch the
roof of the mouth, which the Malay
language calls the langit or heaven), but
such imitative words are very rare in¬
deed. Dag does not sound like a dog,
nor does cat suggest a cat. If you want
the technical terms, language is not
iconic symbolism. Words are very ar¬
bitrary things. If it is suddenly decided
that cat shall mean not a cat but a dog,
it may take some time to accept the
idea, but there is nothing intrinsically
illogical about it.
With no evidence at all, I think of
primitive man looking up at the moon
and saying something like garava-
poiagiya. He does not mean moon; he
means: there is a situation in which I

Fyle, Clifford
National languages
and cultural i(ientity
The grammar, the proverbs, and the
idioms of a language give us a clear
understanding of how its mother
tongue users think and feel, and they
do this more completely than anything
else can. The vocabulary is the sum
total of all the objects, actions and
ideas that affect them or that they need
to know in their environment. Their
literature expresses the best of what
they have experienced and felt over the
years.
It is for these reasons that language is
an expression of the personality of the
group, a means of identifying its
members according to their culture.
When, for example, we say "I am
Italian" or "I am Yoruba", we are
identifying ourselves as members of a
particular cultural group using a par¬
ticular language.
This kind of identification is impor¬
tant. It provides authenticity for an in¬
dividual, in the sense of rooting him
firmly within his community, of
bonding him with others of the same
culture. In this respect, language is a
great unifying factor. One can in fact
say that an important essential for any
unified society is that all its members
should speak the same language.
This is why in many developing
countries there has been so much in¬
terest in a single national language,
which is seen among other things as a
means of achieving national unity. It
becomes imperative to. teach a
language, its literature and its oral
traditions to its users, so that they" can
have a proper appreciation of their own
culture.
This is necessary even when the users
are in their home environment; it
becomes even more so when they are
removed from this environment but
may have to return to it. This is the
case, for example, with the families of
migrant workers, who for various
reasons have taken employment in
other countries, but whose children at
least have to preserve their own culture
and may wish to return to their home
environment. These migrant workers,
however, also have to learn the
language of the other country in which
they find themselves, so that, at least
for the duration of their stay, they can
integrate also into these new
communities.
Since a person's mother tongue is the
language in which he is most adept, in
which he can best express himself,
which he can best understand, it
follows that it is the language in which,
for him, learning can best take place.
For this reason, there has developed the
worldwide educational principle that
all education is best achieved when it is
given through the medium of the
learner's own language.
Countries seeking to achieve rapid
development for their peoples need
rapidly also to provide education for all
their citizens. Only by mobilizing their
total manpower and putting it to effec¬
tive use will they be able to make the
economic strides that they desire. This
means mass education, the mass
teaching of reading and writing, a con¬
stant flow of information and constant
communication, teaching of new habits
and new attitudes, and not least of all,
training in new skills. All this is im¬
possible without a vast national mass
education programme. A country's
leaders are usually quick to realize that
such a programme can only succeed if
it is conducted in the language or
languages with which their people are
familiar.
At this point it is useful to reject the
popular linguistic fiction that some
languages are incapable of being used
for certain educational purposes. The
truth is that any language, any one at
all, is a complete and perfect medium
of expression and can be used to teach
anything. Initially it may not have
enough words to cope with a new situa-

problem for developing countries is
that, with the abundance of new situa¬
tions their languages have to face in be¬
ing used for modern education, bor¬
rowings have to be rapid, organized,
and are therefore generally expensive.
What are the major problems involv¬
ed in promoting and using national
languages as a means of reinforcing
cultural identity, and as educational
instruments?
The initial problem is that of which
language to choose, particularly in
countries with large numbers of
peoples using different languages. It
does not always help to say that one
must choose the language of the
greatest number of speakers, because
sometimes there are two or more
groups equal or almost equal in
strength, or there may be a minority
group which is socially or economically
more significant than a majority
group. The problem is not as serious
for countries with only one language
each; but even they do not escape it en¬
tirely. This single language usually has
a number of dialects that is to say, the
language, though basically the same, is
used in distinctly varying forms in dif¬
ferent parts of the country.
This explains why a number of
developing countries have still not been
able to choose their national languages.
For example, of the forty-five States in
sub-Saharan Africa, there are some
eleven which still have to make the deci¬
sion. It also explains why, in the coun¬
tries which have made the decision, the
term "national language" has been in¬
terpreted in different ways and cor¬
respondingly different choices have
been made. There are the cases where a
country has decided on one language as
a national language. Tanzania is an ex¬
ample of this. Then there are the cases
of multiple adoption. Some countries
merely choose a few of their many
languages as national. Others go fur¬
ther and add a few others for use at
some levels of formal education. Still
others go further and add a number of
other languages for purposes of
literacy teaching.
One problem facing all these coun¬
tries is the dominance of the old col¬
onial languages, usually English,
French or Portuguese. Traditionally,
all education in the Western sense of
the word has been given in these
languages, often for well over a hun¬
dred years. This has led to the assump¬
tion that modern education is only
meaningful if it is given in one of these
languages. The assumption is false
because, as we have noted above, given
vocabulary development, any language
can be used to teach anything. But it is
such a widespread assumption in
developing countries that it often acts
as an effective barrier against the
development and use of the country's
own languages.
But languages such as English,
French and Portuguese affect the
unesco's activities on behalf of migrant workers and their families reflect two major pre¬
occupations. On the one hand they seek to help second-generation migrants to adapt to living
conditions in the host country, chiefly by obtaining a command of the language. They are
also concerned with preparing migrant workers for integration In their home countries by
providing the children with an opportunity to learn their mother tongue and to acquire a
knowledge of their national culture. Above, an African migrant worker in France.
problem of African language develop¬
ment and use in another way. These
languages are international languages,
and so for the purposes of international
communication at least, the developing
countries wish to retain the one they
have been used to and to see that it is ef¬
fectively taught. In face of this, the
problem arises of how much use can be
made of the countries' own languages
as instruments of education, no matter
how the term "national language" is
interpreted.
But the biggest problem of all is the
practical problem of research and the
availability of materials. Some of the
heavily multilingual countries still have
not been able to determine exactly how
many languages are within their
borders and how many persons speak
each language, not to mention produc¬
ing the linguistic grammars and dic¬
tionaries needed as basic reference
works for the use of these languages.
There is also a need for educational
research into the proper curricula and
methodology for teaching the
languages in the languages. Then there
is the need to provide primers, readers
and other materials for literacy and
other forms of education.
Another problem is that of minority
languages. Except for the few States
which have only one language or which
have decided on the adoption of all
their languages as national, all develop¬
ing nations are faced with a minority
language problem. And when we con¬
sider that a country like Nigeria with
possibly some 400 languages has decid¬
ed to adopt only three as national, and
that Kenya with some ninety-four
languages has decided to adopt only
one, Kiswahili, we can appreciate the
scope of the minority language
problem. Properly used, minority
languages can contribute very greatly
to the enrichment of the national
culture and enrich and inform national
education. Yet very few countries, if
any, seem to have discovered exactly
how to take them into account. In
Africa only Tanzania seems to have
taken some action, and that only by
way of looking for words from these
languages to enrich the vocabulary of
Kiswahili. So important is the use of
national languages seen to be for pur¬
poses of national unity, identity and
development that more and more of the
developing countries are facing up to
these problems. The statistics would
seem to bear this out. They are
available for fifty African States, and
they indicate that whereas in 1976,
twenty-eight of these States had more
or less clear language policies and
ongoing programmes, mostly at the
primary level, for the use of their
African languages in education, by
1980, eleven more countries had
declared national language policies,
and six more had initiated primary level
programmes. By 1982, some twenty to
twenty-five of them were teaching
African languages as subjects in secon¬
dary education, and ten were actually
using the languages as media of instruc¬
tion at this level.

A TALKING ANIMAL
Glissant, Edouard
Beyond Babel
"Live in confinement or live with an
open, receptive attitude to others." It is
often maintained that the right of each
people to speak its own language boils
down to this straightforward choice,
which in point of fact legitimizes
premises inherited from a tradition of
domination. Either you speak a language
which is "universal" or is tending to
become so, and you participate in the life
of the great world; or else you withdraw
into your own idiom, which is so little
suited to being shared with others. I f you
take the latter course, you cut yourself
off from the world and languish isolated
and sterile within your so-called identity.
However, since so many liberated
peoples have taken their place on the
world stage, it has come to be felt that the
language of a community is the primary
vector of its cultural identity, which in
turn underlies all the dimensions of its
development. This desire to privilege the
cultural dimension, known as "cul-
turalism", has been stigmatized as
dubious if not harmful. At the same time
every .development process has been
reduced to a single kind of technology,
said to be advanced and inevitable. What
more can you ask for, when a single
language can offer you the key to
progress?
From the point of view of language
and culture, the world's nations would
seem to have no choice apart from that
between confinement in a restrictive par¬
ticularity on the one hand, and on the
other, dilution in the "generalizing
universal". From this dangerous theo¬
retical construction, the "spoken genius"
of the peoples of the world has brought a
brilliant release. Even crushed by the pro¬
ducts of pseudo-progress, the voice of the
African griots, the story-tellers maroon¬
ed on the edges of big cities, still obsti¬
nately refuses to disappear. Govern¬
ments are gradually coming round to the
idea that there is no single, transcendent
model of development that can be impos¬
ed everywhere.
The relations between languages today
are, then, characterized, in the explosion
of our unbelievable diversity, both by
creations which come like a bolt from the
blue, born of the "friction" between
languages, and by a mass of received
ideas and prejudices passively inherited
from the past.
Perhaps the most crucial of these
received ideas has to do with the tradi¬
tional hierarchic division of languages in¬
to the written and the oral. The latter
were reputedly crude, unfitted for con¬
ceptualization and as a result for the true
acquisition and transmission of know¬
ledge. The former were "civilizing"; they
allowed men to emerge from their
"natural state", endowing them with a
context of permanence and giving them a
destiny.
It is true that literacy teaching on a
massive scale is a task of the highest
priority and that it is often carried out,
for want of suitable materials, in what
8
are known as the vehicular languages of
communication. But it is increasingly felt
that literacy instruction in the strict sense
should go hand in hand with the teaching
of "cultural literacy" which widens the
spectrum of choices and permits
autonomous creative forces to be revived
from within.
Between those languages which are
supposedly entrenched in the transcen¬
dence of writing and the rest, which have
long been confined to what was called
with a hint of condescension the world of
oral expression, relations are thus com¬
plex and infinitely various.
Domination is, of course, the
characteristic of the most flagrant of
these forms of relationship, one which is
buttressed by technological expansion
and which usually opens the way to the
trivialization and neutralization of
culture. However carefully devised, the
way out of this paralyzing uniformity,
this banishment of dominated languages
into the restricted realms of folklore and
non-technological areas of expression,
does not lie in a universal language but in
the promotion of a plurilingualism in
which all the languages would be
associated, each responsible for its own
environment.
Fascination is the second of these rela¬
tionships. Admittedly this fascination is
becoming less and less virulent;
nonetheless it has incited the intellectual
élites of the developing countries to use a
prestige language in a reverent and
distorting way, thereby impoverishing
themselves.
Relationships based on contagion oc¬
cur when melting pots explode and yield
unexpected forms which are found above
all in the language used by young people.
Purists are shocked by such mixtures;
poets who are alert to the intermingling
of world cultures are delighted.
Linguistic "purity" is no longer a valid
criterion, and "borrowings" should only
be condemned when they uphold
political, economic and cultural
domination.
Relations based on compliance and
derision may occur, for example,
through fréquentation of tourist spots;
or are products of the very practices of
subordination. This tendency to en¬
courage the birth of hybrid "Tarzan"
languages is swept away when peoples
and nations take a firm grip on their own
cultures.
Tangential relationships are by far the
most insidious. They occur whenever
composite, compromise languages ap¬
pear, such as the Creoles of the French-
speaking parts of the Americas and the
Indian Ocean. In such cases it is
necessary to neutralize the erosion of the
new language, which in a sense takes
place from within the language when one
of its components from afar becomes the
dominant factor in their relationship.
Subversive relations, when a language
is "melted down" by a community and
put to a new use, often as a vehicle for
criticism. In the case of the English
language the English-speaking West In¬
dians and the Blacks of the United States
provide notable examples of this
phenomenon; the people of Quebec, in
the case of French.
Relations based on intolerance arise
especially in the teaching of a major
language of communication. These stem
from the fact that "atavistic fluency" in
the use of a language has hitherto been
tacitly considered indispensable in
achieving mastery of that language. The
language was presented, on a take it or
leave it basis, as wedded to its past
history and therefore intransigently
hostile to the dreadful contagions to
which it might be forced to "submit" by
speakers and creators from elsewhere.
Theories of teaching and learning the
language in question could only be
developed in its "original home".
Above, a Mauritanian village
schoolboy concentrates on his

official languages, Arabic and
French.
But these distinctions between the writ¬
ten and the oral do not only date from the
recent past. In some cases they have ex¬
isted for a long time, creating a rift within
a single language by designating two
often irreconcilable orders of
expression one learned, the other
popular for the same community.

uniformization of cultural practices; or
because the national language is con¬
fronted with problems of transcription)
is but one illustration of the inexhaustible
variety of linguistic situations in the
world today.
A list of such situations would include:
monolingual countries with "external"
problems. In this case a national
language, which is also a major language
of communication, is threatened
economically and culturally by a
"foreign" language.
Bilingual countries with "internal"
problems: there is a confrontation bet¬
ween two widely used languages, each of
which is used by a part of the community,
which is consequently destabilized.
Countries where diglossia exists; a ma¬
jor language of communication tends to
dominate and restrict one or several
mother tongues, sometimes until the lat¬
ter completely disappear.
Multilingual countries without ap¬
parent problems: a federative principle
governs relations between languages in a
single nation.
Multilingual countries where the ex¬
istence of a large number of mother
tongues makes it difficult to choose one
or several official languages.
These situations overlap, exist side by
side, proliferate, transcending the
straightforward conflict between the oral
and the written. They are spectacular in¬
stances of the relations between peoples
and cultures. Their complexity rules out
any summary or reductive assessment of
the strategies which might be employed.
There is no single solution.
This very complexity also makes it
possible to emerge from confinement.
Speaking one's own language does not
exclude a receptive, open-minded at¬
titude to other people and their cultures.
"I speak to you in your language, and it
is in mine that I understand you."
But the possibility of speaking its own
language above all offers to a people the
liberty to create, at all levels, by and
through its language. In other words, the
means of concretizing its relationship
with and place in the world.
Viewed in this light, it is by no means
certain that languages with an oral tradi¬
tion are fundamentally at a disadvan¬
tage. It even seems that, with a great flex¬
ibility and adaptability, they are more in
tune with today's linguistic ferment.
More, perhaps than languages which
have a written tradition and are ossified
in time-worn ways, they are suited to the
changing demands of audio-visual
techniques. Whether this is a weakness or
a strength, it indicates a greater flexibility
and availability. The problems of stan¬
dardization and transcription, when the
results of scholarly research have been
used by the communities concerned, may
lead to compromise solutions which will
gradually be sanctioned and systemat¬
ized.
Vast and dizzying possibilities are
opening up, transcending fierce struggles
against economic domination. This is not
the pre-apocalyptic dizziness which
precedes the fall of the tower of Babel,
but the tremors of creativity confronted
with these boundless possibilities. The
Tower can be built, in all languages.

IL A treasury
of tongues
BaLMIR, Guy Claude
Black English
Since the publication, in 1972, of Joey
Lee Dillard's erudite study Black
English, it is no longer possible to dismiss
the Black North American's way of
speaking as "a vague and artificial
lingo". To be fair, this disdainful out¬
burst of the journalist and literary critic
H.L. Mencken, normally more cir¬
cumspect and balanced in his
judgements, referred only to the period
before the American Civil War.
Like the members of any mixed
language group trying ' to make
themselves understood, the first Blacks
reduced to slavery in North America at
the beginning of the seventeenth century
must have communicated, with the
Whites and amongst themselves, in some
kind of lingua franca, or Pidgin English.
Some of them would already have had
some experience of this aboard the slave
ships on which slaves from different
tribes were mixed up so as to lessen the
risk of escape plots or revolt. Others
from the West African coast might have
learnt one of the forms of Pidgin English
which, like the Portuguese Pidgins
before them, were known to have been
used during the sixteenth century as a
form of //rtgwa/ranea associated with the
slave trade.
It should not be forgotten that multil¬
ingualism and vehicular languages are
traditional in Africa because of the conti¬
nent's great diversity of languages, or
that, even today, many Anglo-West
African Pidgins still persist (krio in
10
Sierra Leone, Pidgin Liberian and
wescos in Cameroon and Nigeria). Fur¬
thermore, other Pidgins exist in the
United States, such as that of the
Chinese, for example, or of certain In¬
dians, like the Seminóles, who at times
lived in close relationship with runaway
slaves.
The basic lingua franca of the slaves
born in Africa was continually being
renewed by successive arrivals, and at the
same time a patois was developing which
served as a new vehicular language
among the creóles, or slaves born in cap¬
tivity. Some slaves, however, acquired
the language of the Whites, either by be¬
ing taught it or else simply by picking it
up, to the point where runaway slaves
succeeded in escaping by forging passes
"signed" by their masters. Thus, in the
words of Dillard, "by the end of the eigh¬
teenth century, slaves from
Massachusetts to South Carolina used
varieties of English ranging from West
African Pidgin to (nearly) Standard
English", and including, of course, the
Creole of the plantations. The planters
themselves, as well as their children
brought up by Black women servants and
in daily contact with young Black
playmates, gradually became bilingual in
Creole and English or, in Louisiana, in
Creole and French.
The Creole of the plantations reached
its peak in the nineteenth century. The
writings of both negrophiles, such as
Harriet Beecher Stowe, and negrophobes
such as N. Beverly Tucker, bear witness
to its vitality in the period up to the Civil
War. In his book Army Life in a Black
Regiment, published in 1870, Thomas
Wentworth Higginson not only left us
some of the finest examples we have of
Creole, but also gave an indication of its
links with the Gullah Creole, now an
isolated dialect, of the coastal regions
and offshore islands of South Carolina
and Georgia.
During the 1940s, Lorenzo Turner
discovered in Gullah many African bor¬
rowings: names of the days of the week
given to children (Cuffy-Friday, Kwame-
Saturday, Quashee-Sunday, etc.), and
common nouns and verbs such as
goober-peanut, tote-carry, buckra-white

man, nyam-yam, as well as banjo, gum¬
bo and jazz. The use of tote is recorded
from 1677 and as early as 1782 Benjamin
Franklin employed the word "boc-
carorra" (buckra) when writing about a
white man.
After the Emancipation and the
Reconstruction, the Negro speech of the
plantations underwent a gradual process
of "decreolisation", moving closer to
Standard English, although in the rural
areas, where schooling was less
widespread, it survived much longer, as
witness the accounts in Lay My Burden
Down; A Folk History of Slavery,
published in 1945, an anthology of
writings of generations spanning a period
long before that date.
As a result, twentieth-century Black
English, through a process of mutual in¬
teractions and influences, though not
identical, has become closer to that of
white southerners at least in its
phonology. But Dillard draws attention
to certain characteristics of its grammar
and recalls the richness of its slang,
especially that of the urban centres of the
North where migrants from the South
settled. What "blues" or "gospel" fan is
unaware of the Negro meaning of "soul"
or of its derivative "soul music"?
It cannot be denied that Black
American vernacular has given birth to a
speech form, even a literature, which is
distinct from that of the dominant
culture, a language the group recognized
as its own and in which it expresses its
collective consciousness. It was thanks to
the fecundity of their gestural "motor"
memory that these Africans, plunged in¬
to a European/Protestant environment
which effaced their residual "image"
memory, were able to structure the ex¬
perience they were obliged to live out in
the concentration-camp world of slavery,
then in a state of serfdom dosed with

lynchings and, finally, in the racist urban
ghettos.
American neo-African expressionism
is based essentially on three elements.
First, rhythms, which in spite of the early
(seventeenth century) banning of the
native drum, at times expands to
polyrhythm and at times adds syncopa¬
tion to the songs adopted or invented in
the new surroundings. Second, the art of
improvisation which makes possible in¬
deed ensures the constant re-invention of
both music and words. Third, African-
style antiphony, that is, the rhythmic
division of the song, of the words bet¬
ween soloist and chorus, between the
preacher, the leader of a game, the work
leader and the group that participates
and supports him with their responses.
These elements shape all the tradi¬
tional forms; the religious forms,
especially the sermon with participation
of the congregation in which the preacher
goes into a trance, declaring himself to be
possessed of the Holy Spirit; the
spiritual, transformations by the slaves
of Protestant canticles into historio-
myths; the sung preachment which was a
happy combination of sermon and
spirituals (and also non-religious forms
such as work songs, adapted English and
Scottish ballads, country and city blues,
In the United States after the
emancipation of the slaves and
the end of the Civil War, "the
Negro speech of the plantations
underwent a gradual process of

Standard English". Left, "the

game songs and the pornographic poems
of the ghettos known as "dozens").
Today "gospel" is really no more than
a modern version of the old religious
songs and the participatory sermon has
moved into the towns where it occupies
improvised store-front churches. The
blues singer has stolen the limelight from
the anonymous bards of the spirituals of
bygone times, and the events of daily life
rather than religious topics have become
the theme of the blues. Nevertheless, by
enriching jazz with its melodies and its
tonality (the famous "blue notes" in par¬
ticular) the blues form has provided a
link between the traditional expres¬
sionism of song and the expressionism of
instrumental intervention which has
adopted all the elements of the Afro-
American language including its
vocabulary. What is jazz if not impromp¬
tu song, the voice of the Negro taken up
by the instrument, just as, in early times,
the beat of the banned drum was taken
up by the feet and hands of the slaves? Is
not "scat" the voice playing the role of
the instrument? Or could it be the instru¬
ment which turns again to the voice?
Here tongue and language become con¬
founded, as though unconsciously, in
their native ambiguity.
Nevertheless, although no mention has
been made here of the theatre, the novel,
or even of the improvised "jazz poetry"
of the 1960s, it is to the "folklore" poets
that we owe the final encounter between
literature and "orature". In the past,
Fenton Johnson, and later Weldon
Johnson, Langston Hughes and Sterling
Brown, and today Raymond Patterson,
by adopting popular forms and then
adapting them into literary genres, have
succeeded in giving back to the speech
forms and language of Black Americans
their beauty and their dignity.

A TREASURY OF TONGUES
BaREIRO SAGUIER, Rubén
The Indian languages
of Latin America
With the death in April 1983 of
"Abuela Rosa" (Grandmother Rose,
the last of the Yaganas, once an impor¬
tant ethnic group in Southern Chile), a
"vision of the world" as seen through
an indigenous American culture was
extinguished. It was another of the
many such cultures which have disap¬
peared since the European conquest
and colonization of this continent
started nearly five centuries ago.
Expert studies reveal that more than
five hundred languages or dialects still
survive in Latin America. They are
grouped in twenty main families,
established on the basis of different
criteria genetic-structural relations,
grammatical-lexical kinships, or simple
geographical groupings. The diversity
and dissimilarity of these languages
add to the mystery surrounding their
origins. Indeed, explanations of the
origin or cultural roots of the Amerin¬
dian people are still in the realm of
hypothesis. Are they autogenous, or
arethey of Asiatic, Oceanic, Africaner
runic origin? Or does their origin lie in
a mixture of all these possibilities? At
all events, serious investigations have
revealed noteworthy analogies with
such faraway languages as Finnish,
Basque, Turko-Caucasian or Sino-
Tibetan.
A feature of these languages is the
absence of unity within "families".
Thus Quechua, which was the language
of the most highly developed empire at
the time of the arrival of the Spaniards,
that of the Incas, contains a rather wide
diversity of dialects. In this regard, a
very typical case is that of the Maya
group, within which twenty-eight
dissimilar dialectic forms exist today.
The difference between Quiche (the
language of the' Popal Vuh) and
another important dialect, Cakchiquel,
for example, is as great as that between
French and Russian, both of which are
members of the Indo-European
linguistic family.
In order to appreciate the substantial
difference between the native
languages of America and those of the
so-called "Western" world, certain
basic characteristics of the former must
be pointed out. It is essential to make
the distinction because it was the
"Western" languages which entered
into contact with the Amerindian
languages, a contact marked by a con¬
flict of cultures and a relationship of
domination. In this connexion, the
French specialist in Amerindian
languages Bernard Pottier draws atten¬
tion to "the existence of categories of
thought manifested by grammatical
modes to which we are not accustom-
12
ed". This is an initial difference related
to "the Vision of the World", that is to
say "the connexions between kinds of
experience lived and linguistic
taxonomies".
Secondly, it is necessary to em¬
phasize the essentially oral character of
the Amerindian languages which have
no alphabet. I say "essentially",
because at least two of them Maya
and Náhuatl had a method of
transmission. This was based on a
system of grooves and ideograms
engraved on stone, wood, plaster, on
jade or drawn in the codices manufac¬
tured from the bark of the amate. But
writing did not exclude oral tradition
since writing was exclusive to the priest¬
ly class in particular, as well as to an
élite of nobles and rulers.
Of all these languages, the one which
is most widely used today is Quechua,
which is spoken by approximately
12,000,000 people (in Peru, Bolivia,
Ecuador, Northern Argentina,
Southern Colombia). Next comes
Guarani, spoken by 3,000,000 people
(in Paraguay, several parts of Argen¬
tina and pockets in Brazil and Bolivia).
About a million speak Maya (in
Guatemala, Southern Mexico, Belize, a
part of Honduras); Aymara (in
Bolivia, Northern Chile and Southern
Peru); Náhuatl (in Mexico and El
Salvador). The present standing of
these languages corresponds to the
characteristics of a general language or
a lingua franca which they possessed
before the conquest and during the col¬
onial period, i.e. vehicular languages in
extensive areas of the continent.
This leads us to an examination of
the consequences of the various contact
situations which arose as a result of the
European presence on the American
continent. This presence interrupted a
process of civilization by bringing two
different systems of values into con¬
frontation. It was a dramatic confron¬
tation which, because of the technical
superiority of the European, involved
the imposition of the "Western"
Christian model to the detriment of
Amerindian cultural values and, at the
same time, of the language of the con¬
quistador. The conflict opposing two
concepts of civilization was fundamen¬
tally an ideological confrontation.
Specifically, it derived from the need to
impose "an unquestionable truth"
the existence of one true god, that of
the conquerors, and consequently the
indispensable "destruction of
idolatry", the death of the "false
divinities" adored by the "infidels".
This was the main pretext for the entire
process of cultural substitution and
economic exploitation of the colony.
Language naturally played an essen¬
tial role in this confrontation, since it
was the material in which the
ideological content of the conditioning
process was moulded. It was also the
material in which resistance to that pro¬
cess was fashioned.
To the conquering language of
Castile, whose imposition on the
Iberian peninsula was completed in the
very year in which America was
discovered, was assigned the task of
conditioning. Initially, it was the
medium of evangelization, but it
withdrew from this role when the
superior efficacy of the vehicular
Amerindian languages for teaching the
"true faith" was realized. This victory
of the judgment of the "theologians"
over that of the "politicians" took
place during the 16th century with the
solid support of the Jesuits. This meant
that the natives were conditioned in
their own language but also that the
colonial process strengthened the status
of some languages, such as Guarani,
which was standardized in the Mis¬
sions, or developed the spread of
others, like Quechua, whose use was
greatly extended after the Conquest.
The most remarkable experiment af¬
fecting a native language was that per¬
formed by the Jesuits in the Guarani
Reductions during a century and a half.
This experiment consisted in using only
Guarani for the production of Chris¬
tian religious literature. This certainly
helped to strengthen the position of the
indigenous language (which, thanks to
a process of generalized racial integra-
The Lacandon Indians who live
in the south of the Yucatan
peninsula, between Mexico and
Guatemala, were only "dis¬
co vered ' ' at the beginning of this
century. Perhaps because of their
geographical and cultural isola¬
tion they speak an extraordinarily
pure form of the Maya language.

tion, was already well established in the
Province of Paraguay), but at the same
time it drained Guarani of its own
values which were essentially of a
mystical-religious character.
Not a single example of this oral
literature had been transcribed up to
the first decade of this century, which
proves that the "colonial process" con¬
tinued after independence (1811). And
this marginalization is even more
serious since the exuberant speech of
the Guaranis was the principal expres¬
sion of their culture.
However, Guarani has survived in
resemanticized, diglottic form until to¬
day as the generally spoken language of
a national community, Paraguay. This
is a unique case in America. 95 per cent
of the population speak it, 45 per cent
of the population are bilingual, 50 per
cent are monolingual in Guarani and 5
per cent are monolingual in Spanish.
Its use is not restricted to the regions of
the interior. It has also invaded the
cities. Nor is its use confined to certain
classes of society, as happens with the
native languages in other countries of
the continent. But notwithstanding its
general use. Guarani is only a "na¬
tional" language together with
Spanish as declared in Article 5 of the
Constitution which, in the next line,
consecrates Spanish as the "official"
language.
Literacy programmes are not con¬
ducted in Guarani and it is not used as
a medium of artistic expression. Thus
the Paraguayan writer has accepted his
condition of being a colonized writer
since, despite the fact of knowing the
native language, he does not write in it.
The impulses of the popular will
operate in Guarani, but social and
cultural advancement are achieved
through Spanish. These are signs which
show that Guarani is the language of a
dominated, albeit a majority group.
But what is happening to the other
great indigenous language. Quechua,
which is the most widely spoken on the
continent? To compare it with the
situation described above, that is to say
in the context of a State, let us take the
case of Peru. In May 1975, Quechua
was declared by law to be an official
language of that country on an equal
footing with Spanish. The purpose of
this was to strengthen the position of
Quechua in the national community
and to combat the social inferiority at¬
tached to the indigenous language and
its speakers. At the present time, the
linguistic position in Peru is as follows.
Between six and eight million out of a
total population of 16 million are bil¬
ingual in varying degrees, and about
1 ,600,000 are monolingual in Quechua.
That is to say that approximately 50 per
cent of the population are in a linguistic
situation similar to that found in
Paraguay. With one difference
however this half of the population is
linguistically isolated from the other

half, doubtless through lack of com¬
munication, but also because those
who speak Quechua are looked down
upon.
The situation of Náhuatl, the other
language which enjoyed great prestige
and was widely used in pre-Columbian
times, is even worse. Successive cen¬
suses reveal a progressive decline in the
number of speakers, again largely
because of the social opprobrium of
which the language is victim. This is
despite the admirable declarations of
principle enshrined in "indigenista"
policies which, judging by the results,
are ineffectual and incoherent.
There exists another approach
through which Amerindian cultures, or
the encouragement of the languages, is
extended or projected within the hybrid
societies of America, and here I am
speaking primarily of cultural hybridi-
ty. This is the approach which evokes
or proposes an image of the Indian and
of the components of his world. The
first projection, called indianismo, is
that portrayed in nineteenth-century
Latin American romanticism.
Alienated, stereotyped, idealized, it is
nothing else than the image borrowed
from the cliché of the "noble savage"
which was a fashionable invention of
European literature.
Towards the beginning of the present
century, an entire change of focus took
place, and the Indian portrayed in the
pages of the indigenista novel sym¬
bolizes a denunciation of, and violent
protest against, the exploitation of
which he himself is a victim in Latin
American society. This vision is com¬
passionate, indignant and committed
but it is outside the cultures it seeks to
defend. Thus the indigenistas fall into
an unconscious contradiction when
they propose the integration of the In¬
dian on terms of equality into national
or "white" society. In doing so, they
overlook cultural specificities, which
involves an obvious risk of con¬
tributing to a loss of identity.
Towards the 1940s, the nature of
writing underwent a change and the
Latin American writer lost his complex
of writing in an "imposed language".
Overcoming the old tyranny of "cor¬
rect" Spanish, he adopted a language
in which local, everyday elements
enriched the linguistic system
Castilian Spanish in which he ex¬
pressed himself. Much of this renewal
is due to the fact that a number of
writers assumed the profound values of
indigenous cultures. True, they write in
Spanish but knowing, as most of them
do, the autochthonous languages on
which in all cases these cultures are bas¬
ed, they employ resources and tech¬
niques borrowed from them which end
by changing or giving a profoundly dif¬
ferent colouring to what in literary
terms remains the predominant
idiom.

Creole language of
the Caribbean
About 1615, French privateers gained a
foothold on a Caribbean rock to which
they gave the name of St. Christopher.
At that time, the archipelago "belong¬
ed" to the Spanish crown, but the rival
European powers decided to fight for a
share of the spoils. Thus the first
French to settle in the West Indies were
men of the sea, of the sword, and of lit¬
tle faith. Stealing a few slaves from the
Spaniards in the course of daring raids,
they managed to come to terms with the
Caribs who occupied the Windward
Islands. There followed settlements in
Guadeloupe and Martinique (1635),
Saint-Lucia and Grenada (1650),
Guiana (1660) and Tortuga which serv¬
ed as a bridgehead for the conquest of
Santo Domingo (1697). In all these
islands, a Creole language is still
spoken which, despite some regional
peculiarities, is of relatively homo¬
geneous structure.
The term Creole, which has a variety
of meanings in French, also varies con¬
siderably in meaning in English,
Spanish, Portuguese and Dutch.
Sometimes, it denotes the white descen¬
dant of the master, sometimes it
denotes on the contrary the black ele¬
ment of African origin, on occasions it
is used to denote the intermediate
stages of ethnic cross-breeding. Never¬
theless, a radical semantic frontier ex¬
tends from the bayous of Louisiana to
the border of Guiana.
Creole is always used in contrast to a
word or series of words indicating a
foreign, imported, immigrant element,
introduced into the Community will¬
ingly or by force without taking root.
Whether used adjectivally or as a noun,
it constantly signifies a symbolical
renaissance or final integration into a
new ecosystem. The Creole languages,
which too often, for the sake of conve¬
nience, are attached to a European
trunk, are always treated as hybrids,
mutants or breakaways which refuse to
acknowledge their alleged origins.
Putting the question of the genesis of
the Creole language in this way already
amounts to participating in the endless
discussion which is going on in this
field. We find that Creole is linked with
seventeenth century French coloniza¬
tion, that it spread very rapidly and
that it came into being in order to meet
the needs of a new kind of communica¬
tion between unequal partners.
In fact, more careful analysis would
reveal that negroes and whites must
have collaborated closely in creating
this new language and that before the
arrival of large numbers of black slaves
Creole was already the vernacular of all
the inhabitants of the archipelago, ir¬
respective of their ethnic origin.

(1685) and the withdrawal of white
contract workers thrust Creole into the
negro communities from the beginning
of the next century onwards, and it was
only then that Creole would be referred
to as a negro language. It should be
noted that even now the béké (white
West Indian settlers) still use Creole,
which they have never abandoned
completely.
We reject the dialect hypothesis (that
Creole is derived from French) or the
neo-African hypothesis (that Creole is
a re-creation of a pre-existing African
pidgin language) in favour of a mixed,
hybrid in a word, mulatto origin of
a system which admits a French source
for eighty per cent of its vocabulary but
certain aspects of whose morphology,
syntax and rhetoric recall, in the
opinion of other observers, West
African patterns. The socio-linguistic
function of Creole, more important
than its genetic or typological
classification, must be recognized. The
language of a rural community cut off
from the written word, official
statements or great technological in¬
ventions, it provides a basic system of
communication within relatively small
communities which are strongly im¬
pregnated with customs and traditions
which guarantee the survival of the ex¬
isting social order.
After the 1804 revolution, Haiti pro¬
vided a fertile soil for Creole. Having
violently rejected both slavery and col¬
onialism, the Haitians created a State
that was both isolated and free of
foreign tutelage, within which com¬
munications were difficult. With
educational facilities that are
ridiculously small in proportion to the
population's theoretical needs and
media reaching only a limited au¬
dience, the Republic of Haiti is basical¬
ly a Creole-speaking nation. In the
absence of exact language statistics,
researchers generally agree that about
80 per cent of the population speak
only Creole. Only the "élite", the
privileged 5 per cent who live in Port-
au-Prince and Pétionville and who
benefitted from full-time school atten¬
dance can at present claim to know
standard French.
The socio-linguistic situation is dif¬
ferent in the Lesser Antilles and
Guiana, which have remained French.
Since the abolition of slavery (1848)
and the campaigns for universal lay
education (beginning of the twentieth
century), French has gradually gained
ground. The growing numbers of tran¬
sistors, telephones and television sets,
of newspapers and magazines, the
large-scale post-war school attendance
programmes and the considerable in¬
crease in the movement of persons bet-

Above, a Creole version of the
famous maxim from George
Orwell's Animal Farm: "All
animals are equal but some are
more equal than others. " The il¬
lustration is taken from an adap¬

ed In Mauritius under the title
Repibllk Zanimo.
ween the "home country" and the
"Overseas Departments" all these
have contributed to an undeniable
retreat of Creole in areas where it was
the accepted medium of conversation.
Creole is used less and less to discuss
the price of vegetables or for story¬
telling in the countryside, and political
and sports commentaries are increas¬
ingly given in French.
A similar phenomenon is taking
place in the West Indies, especially
Dominica and Saint Lucia, of which
France lost control in the nineteenth
century, but here it seems to be English
which is hastening the decline of Creole
and taking its place. Although in syn-
tax and vocabulary they are very close
to the languages of Guadeloupe and
Martinique, the varieties of Creole
spoken in the former British dominions
are rapidly becoming anglicized.
This problematic co-existence of a
popular, rural everyday language side
by side with another, official, written,
influential language has been studied
by North American experts in socio-
linguistics under the general descrip¬
tion of diglassia. But more solidly
founded investigations have recently
invalidated the idea of a harmonious
co-existence of two languages in our
communities. The West Indians and
the inhabitants of Guiana are not
perfectly bilingual speakers who
"choose" to express themselves either
in Creole or in the standard language
each time they have something to say.
On the contrary, a sort of third
language is gradually taking form, a
sort of mongrel Creole crossed with
French or English, a system which is to
all appearances extremely unstable
but which is recruiting enthusiastic
adherents in the field of the popular
song, literature and the mass circula¬
tion press and quite simply in daily in¬
tercourse amongst all members of the
community. This Frenchified Creole,
or Creolized French has recently been
baptized interlecte. According to some
researchers into this phenomenon,
Creole is merely continuing its "life-
cycle", is re-pidginizing itself with a
standard language because of the
socio-economic changes which have
taken place in recent years and should
eventually become merged into a broad
continuum with its mother tongue. In
their view, Creole will gradually disap¬
pear as it is re-absorbed by the symbolic
power of the standard language,
mastery of which is a permanent aim
for the underprivileged speakers of
Creole.

linguistics, however, maintains that the
death certificate of a language should
not be issued with undue haste. True,
when seen subjectively from a certain
viewpoint in Guiana and the West In¬
dies, Creole appears to be in poor
shape. The rural dwelling, in which it
was firmly rooted, has disappeared
from our landscape, and the younger
generation is strongly attracted by
vocabulary coming from elsewhere,
whether it be Parisian slang, Jamaican
forms of speech, American negro songs
or expressions from the campuses of
foreign universities.
But. amongst these young people
Creole also has a stabilizing rôle. It is a
factor of cultural identity and of con¬
tact with a history that is constantly be¬
ing questioned. Young Caribbeans are
discovering that, compared with the
obvious advantages of French in
school, at work, in international life,
Creole provides a form of cultural pro¬
tection. As a result, it is no longer ap¬
propriate to speak of Creole as a
language that is despised and belittled
by those who speak it. Opinion polls
show that the younger population
groups are strongly in favour of a stan¬
dardization of the "patois" and want
to see it taught in schools. Thus
pessimism is no longer necessarily
justified regarding the future of the
language.
Apart from this change of attitude,
there is a gradual increase in the output
of artistic works in Creole adapted to
the needs and tastes of the new market.
These include records and cassettes not
only of local origin but also from the
North American and European
diaspora, storybooks, collections of
proverbs, works of history and
philosophy, plays and films.
The last bastion of official resistance
is collapsing. The governments con¬
cerned seem to be moving towards a
recognition of the fact that Creole is the
language of their citizens. In Haiti,
thanks to a daring educational reform
introduced in 1979, Creole is now the
first language taught in primary
schools.
Although they have not gone quite so
far, the governments of Saint Lucia
and Dominica are introducing ar¬
rangements which will contribute to a
recognition of Creole as a fact of
linguistic and cultural life. In
Dominica, whose national motto is a
phrase in Creole, a Creole day has been
instituted. Cultural research groups are
officially supported and radio pro¬
grammes are broadcast both for those
who speak only Creole and for those
who wish to improve their knowledge
of the language.
Things have been moving more slow¬
ly in Guiana, Guadeloupe and Martin¬
ique. There is no shortage of man¬
power and printed matter, but the
authorities have been slow to act.
However, the latest instructions con-
16
cerning regional languages in France
lead us to hope that reforms may now
be introduced in teacher-training. Such
reforms are essential for the pro¬
gressive introduction of Creole into the
educational system both as a working
language and as a subject of study.
KeDROS, André
When Greek
meets Greek
The Greek language has changed less in
the course of time than many other an¬
cient idioms. Modern Greek is much
closer to the Greek of Plato than is
Italian to the Latin of Cicero. A Greek
high school pupil of today could just
about read Xenophon's Anabasis or
Plato's Dialogues without having
recourse to a dictionary (this would not
be true of Homer's writings). To do
this, however, he would need a good
command of "pure" Greek.
This is because modern Greek suf¬
fers from a dichotomy between
katharevusa, or "pure" Greek, and
demotiki, the popular language of the
people. A similar dichotomy within a
language is found in varying degrees in
other regions, particularly in Arab-
speaking countries. In Greece, this
resulted in a "war of words" that has
roused passions, at times been given an
ideological colouring, and has still not
been completely resolved.
Poor, the victims (even quite recent¬
ly) of their history, unable to acquire an
acceptable level of instruction from an
inadequate educational system, the
people of Greece have always spoken
the so-called "popular" language, a
flexible, expressive, living language,
but one which, cut off from the
mainstream and currents of thought
that have enriched Western culture, has
remained somewhat confined, as poor
as the people who speak it.
The "pure" language, on the other
hand, preserved by the Church and
close to classical Greek, has retained
the rich vocabulary and many of the
subtleties of a language with a noble
tradition; unfortunately, it is rigid and
archaistic and the ordinary people
understand very little of it.
In the early years of the seventeenth
century, Cyril Lucaris, patriarch of the
Greek Orthodox Church, wanted to
have the gospels translated into
Demotic Greek, but this initiative end¬
ed in tragedy. Denounced for "Pro¬
testantism" by his co-religionists, he
was condemned to death by Sultan
Murad IV and strangled by his Ot¬
toman guards.
At the beginning of the nineteenth
century, the Greeks, with the help of
some of the great powers of the day,
finally freed a large part of their ter¬
ritory from the occupying Turks. The
poet Dionysios Solomos helped to
rouse national feeling with inflam¬
matory poems such as his masterpiece
The Freed Besieged which, since he was
addressing the freedom fighters and the
Greek people as a whole, were written
in the popular language. Some of the
freedom fighters' leaders, men of hum¬
ble origin such as Makriyannis, also
left behind them remarkable memoirs
in demotiki.
With independence scarcely achiev¬
ed, social divisions quickly re-surfaced
in the new Greek State. The conser¬
vatism of the Church, which had had a
positive influence during the long years
of Turkish occupation, found an echo
in the conservatism of the privileged
classes, the big landowners and the
bourgeoisie who had taken over the
reins of power. This conservatism,
which made its influence felt in
schools, the judiciary, indeed,
throughout the administration, extend¬
ed even to the language question and as
a result katharevusa, the "pure"
language, was adopted by the entire ap¬
paratus of State.
The question of the two languages
thus took on a new dimension. The of¬
ficial adoption of katharevusa had the
effect of keeping the common people in
a clear situation of inferiority. It
severely limited their access to secon¬
dary and higher education, made them
dependent on "literate" intermediaries
in their dealings with the administra¬
tion and the law courts, and encourag¬
ed political patronage. The example of
Dionysios Solomos was forgotten, and
the literature of the period, as well, of
course, as the newspapers and
magazines were all written in the
"pure" language.
In 1888, the Greek writer Jean
Psichari attempted another
breakthrough by publishing his novel
My Journey in demotiki. The book was
greeted with howls of protest and was
to become a landmark in the "language
war". The objections to it were in large
part ideologically based, but it is true
that Psichari, a man of upper middle
class origin, seldom used demotiki
himself and in writing his book drew
largely on the rather stilted, artificial
language of folklore. Thus his
courageous initiative was open to
criticism and, although he was to in¬
fluence the poets and writers of the end
of the century such as Kostas Palamas
and Kosmas Politis they were careful to
avoid his radical approach.
The language problem soon
developed into a major political issue.
The left wing parties included the in¬
troduction of demotiki in schools and
the administration among their
demands for social reform and made a
point of using it in their own

newspapers and publications. The
quarrel reached such a pitch that, in the
1920s, any fervent protagonist of
demotiki was automatically considered
to be a political extremist.
Gradually, however, even the most
confirmed conservatives began to
realize that, in an ever more rapidly
changing world, the use o{ katharevusa
was isolating them more and more
from the ordinary people over whom
they were thus losing their control.
General Metaxas, who in 1936
established a nazi-style regime in
Greece, switched to using demotiki.
And it is significant that it was a fairly
conservative government that, in 1976,
issued the decree introducing the use of
the popular language in the schools.
A number of problems remain,
however. The demotiki used in the
schools was found in practice to be
rather too imprecise and only by mak¬
ing rather arbitrary borrowings from
katharevusa could it be made suitable
for the teaching of technology and the
sciences. Soon voices were calling "a
plague on both your houses", charging
the defenders of demotiki with sec¬
tarianism and denouncing the diehard
protagonists of katharevusa as elitists.
A language cannot be developed by
decree. It is a living thing which can be
modified only at the pace of its own in¬
ternal rythms and which enriches itself
by taking what it needs from wherever
it finds it. Demotiki, a living, popular
language, is lucky enough to be able to
draw on the wellsprings of an Attic
language which, though stiff and
pedantic in its present form, has reach¬
ed across the centuries to provide the
Western world with many of the terms

Memories come rushing back to me
pell-mell, memories that for twenty
years have played upon my feelings and
my inner consciousness. From the time
that I became aware of the outer world
I was steeped in a linguistic environ¬
ment which was preponderantly
English and bilingual, French being
reserved for use in the home. The end
result of this overlapping of two
languages, or, to be more precise, of
one language over another, was to pro¬
duce an undifferentiated web in which
words went in two's, pairings which
came through to me as a single signal.

meat/viande, lundi/Monday, péage/
toll, men/hommes, address/adresse,
merci/thank you, bienvenue/welcome.
Posters, advertisements, signs were all
around me. This, I thought, is how the
world is.
This was also how it was in Montreal
when I arrived there in 1947, and, in¬
deed, how it was throughout the Pro¬
vince. In the street (the Rue Principale,
the Rue Saint-Vincent, the Rue Tour-
du-Lac) I used to hear English spoken
more often than not and see French
Canadians the shopkeepers, the
workmen all deferentially getting by
as best they could in this language.
Some of them were proud to do this;
others, I felt, were less so. Already I
could hear all around me what I had
heard over twenty years wherever I had
lived or travelled: "So-and-so gets by
very well in English' ' ; " Look at old So-
18
and-so, he's got a good job, he speaks
English"; "He's educated, he knows
English", or its variant, "He's a
cultivate(i man, he speaks English";
"He's completely bilingual", and so
on.
Later, in Montreal, I was on several
occasions to hear something which
went much further: "1 speak English so
well that when I am with the English
(English-speaking Canadians) they
can't tell that I am French Canadian",
or words to that effect. When, at the
age of twenty-five, I began to ponder
the significance of these remarks, I

was a carpentry contractor and a high

English. Yet he spoke English only with
great difficulty. One day I was present
during a particularly halting discussion
with a rich customer. After she had
left, he said to me: "You, at any rate,
are going to learn English." At eight
years old, that had a powerful effect on
me.

Bonjour Québec
For two centuries after the Treaty of
Paris (1763) which brought to an end
Anglo-French contention for the pos¬
session of New France, English was the
language of business and economic
power in Quebec. The language clash
that this situation gave rise to bore
witness to the struggle of a people
against assimilation. Cut off from its
French roots, the language of Quebec
was obliged to evolve outside the
mainstream of the French language
and to affirm its own specificity.
The industrial expansion of the
beginning of the twentieth century
threatened to result in the "angliciza-
tion"of the lower-paid workers, and in
1902, the Association for the Use of
French in Canada was established
whose aim was to encourage the study,
improvement and protection of Cana¬
dian French. Nevertheless, up to 1960,
the language question seems to have
been limited to literary squabbles and
nationalistic rhetoric.
The popular spoken language,
Joual, has given rise to a great deal of
controversy. No one seems able to
agree on a precise definition of Joual;
does it include the entire vocabulary of
Quebec French, or does it cover only a
Montreal dialect full of anglicisms? Is
it a new language, a patois, or simply a
certain level of a language? Each
linguist and commentator adopts a dif¬
ferent viewpoint and the debate
widens, since the linguistic question is
only one aspect of a wider social
problem.
From the linguistic point of view, the
peculiarities of Quebec French are not
a matter of vocabulary, syntax or mor¬
phology, but rather of phonetics.
Apart from a certain number of
anglicisms, which vary from region to
region, the vocabulary is marked chief¬
ly by the use of archaic words or expres¬
sions that can still be traced back to cer¬
tain regions of France. To these must
be added words that had to be invented
to describe the realities of a new land:
bancs de neige (snow banks), poudrerie
(blizzard), érablière (maple grove),
orignal (moose). The syntax borrows
some English or American construc¬
tions, yet without straying from the
French sentence form. Crammed with
abbreviations, the morphology is often
elliptic and at times abrupt,
syncopated.
The Quebec accent, however, like
the accents of Marseille or Belgium, is
immediately recognizable. It is a matter
of a tone and a rhythm which, com¬
bined with nasalization, diphthongiza-
tion and the displacement of the tonic
accent, demand a certain period of
adaptation for an untutored ear. Once
the listener has become accustomed to
these peculiarities, he soon realizes that
Quebec speech is neither a dialect nor a
patois; even less is it an autonomous
language distinct from French.
Joual has had a striking impact in the
literary field. The people of Quebec
have long been asking themselves
whether they have a literature that can
be considered distinct from French li¬
terature. Their writers have wavered
between universalism (respect for the
beauty of mainstream French) and
regionalism (giving rein to exoticism
and the picturesque). They were aware
of the gap that existed between the writ¬
ten and the spoken language in Quebec.
This debate was necessary to clarify
the issues about a language under
pressure. The people of Quebec can
now set about trying to define a French
language which is specifically North
American; not a new but a different
language which is developing within
the environment in which it is
employed.
Language, which is a form of cul¬
tural and political expression, remains
a matter of discussion. The number of
dictionaries and indexes which attempt
to capture its specificity, the multiplici¬
ty of opinions, the inquiries aimed at
establishing a better assessment of its
representativeness are all evidence of a
permanent, continuing questioning.
Two important Commissions were
set up: the Royal Commission on Bil-
ingualism and Biculturalism
(1963-1970), which resuUed in the
recognition of the equality of English
and French regarding their use in all

French language and language rights in
Quebec, whose multidisciplinary
studies have opened up new horizons.
Established in 1 961 , the Office of the
French Language is responsible for
watching over the enrichment and cor¬
rect use of the spoken and written
language and acts as an arbiter on the
usage of technical terminology. The
purpose of the Charter of the French
Language, which was adopted in 1977
and was the outcome of a lengthy
period of discussion, is to guarantee the
French-speaking people of Quebec cer¬

to make French the normal and
customary language of work, com¬

both of the administration and the
business world.

India, a multilingual
sub-continent
According to the 1961 Census, there are
1,652 mother tongues in India. These
mother tongues are identity tokens, but
not necessarily languages. Depending on
how one counts, there are between 400
and 700 languages in India. There are
thirteen major modern languages listed
in the eighth schedule of the Indian Con¬
stitution besides Sanskrit, and English,
which is the associate official language of
the Republic.
These thirteen languages have a history
of at least one thousand years, Tamil
claiming antiquity as old as Sanskrit or
even older. Each of them, excepting Sin-
dhi, Urdu, Sanskrit and Hindi, is a domi¬
nant language in a State. Sindhi is a non-
State language spread "over different
parts of the country. Urdu is the official
language of Jammu and Kashmir States
and yet is spoken in almost all States of
India. Hindi is spoken in six States and
Union Territories as the mother tongue
and culture language and is spoken by the
largest number of people as their second
language. Sanskrit has been the mother
language of all languages of India ir¬
respective of family affiliation. All these
languages have their dialects, styles and
registers adding further complexity to the
scene.
The languages of India belong to four
language families, Indo-European, Dravi-
dian, Austric (a language grouping that

includes the Austro-Asiatic and
Austronesian language families) and
Sino-Tibetan. There are a large number
of languages yet to be classified and
scholars have suggested a fifth family.
However, both the influence of Sanskrit
and the cultural miscegenation of the last
3,000 years has made India a single
language, linguistic, socio-linguistic and
semantic area.
There are eight major script systems
and a host of minor ones in India. It is in¬
teresting that while the languages of In¬
dia belong to four or five language
families, all scripts except Roman and
Arabic belong to one script family. The
Indian language alphabet systems bor¬
rowed from Sanskrit are among the most
phonetic scripts in the world. Sanskrit
was permitted to be written in different
scripts in different parts of the country.
This to a certain extent explains the in¬
fluence Sanskrit exercised over different
Indian languages. In the new awareness
about literacy teaching, enthusiasts and
sectarians have been proposing new
scripts and expanding existing scripts.
But the general tendency among non-
literate languages acquiring literacy is to
adopt the script of the dominant
language of the region of their location.
Even now languages like Santhali and
Konkani are written in five and four
scripts respectively. As one language is
written in many scripts, many languages
are also written using Devanagari.
A close look at the demography of the
country makes it amply clear that not on¬
ly the Republic as a whole, but each con¬
stituent part of it is multilingual. Three
distinct linguistic profiles are discerned
even from a cursory look. There are
States where the dominant language is
spoken by between 85-95 per cent of the
population. There is a different group of
States where the dominant language is
spoken by between 45 and 65 per cent of
the population. The third group consists
of regions comprising States and Union
Territories where no language is spoken
by over 20 per cent of the population.
Each one poses a different set of educa¬
tional and cultural problems.
India's tribal population constitutes 7
per cent of its population. Although
many of the tribal languages have died or
surrendered their identity to other major
Indian languages, a vast number still per¬
sists. Except in the north-east of India
tribal languages are nowhere in the ma¬
jority. Even in north-east India, althoujgh
tribal languages are in the majority
because of the existence of a large
number of small ethno-linguistic groups,
there is no cohesiveness among them. As
a result English has been adopted as the
State language in some of these States.
Hindi is the official language and
English is the associate official language
of the Republic. However, Hindi has not
been able to resolve the internal con¬
tradiction between language and dialects
and the external contradiction arising out
of binary juxtaposition of Hindi with
English on the one hand and Hindi and
other regional languages on the other. In
spite of all promotional efforts, Hindi in
the popular mind is neither the language
of authority nor of convenience. Yet it is
20
defacto the linguafranca of the country.
English is spoken by approximately
2 per cent of the population. This
population though small in percentage is
larger in size than that of Australia.
There is a small group of Anglo-Indians
whose mother tongue is English. They
have been granted special constitutional
protection. English continues to be the
language of intellection, commerce and
above all is the key to jobs guaranteeing
rank, status and wealth in society.
English education has created an élite
class and has created a gap between the
élite and the masses. Whether in educa¬
tion, administration or mass com¬
munication, English dominates the field.
There is a growing demand for a realloca-
one goes in the ladder, the greater is the
demand for a lesser number of languages.
This militates against the grass-root
multilingualism in the country.
The policy of the Indian Government,
generally known as the "three language
formula", is a consensus born out of
pragmatism. This three language for¬
mula is a strategy and not a goal. It leaves
open the possibility of learning more
than the three required languages, the
regional State language, and the two of¬
ficial national languages, Hindi and
English. Thus, anyone who has a mother
tongue other than one of these three and
who wishes to pursue its study at school,
or anyone who wishes to study classical

Urdu, which belongs to the Indlc group of the Indo-European languages,
is spoken by some 26 million people In India and Pakistan. Although
structurally and historically spoken Urdu and Hindi derivefrom the same
base, the literary forms of the two languages have separated due to the in¬
fluence of Sanskrit on Hindi and of Persian and Arabic on Urdu. Urdu
is written from right to left. The alphabet, above, is in Arabic script with
Persian additions and extra letters to Indicate sounds specific to Urdu,
tion of domains of usage between English
and the newly emerging regional
languages. In the process, English is also
set against the Indian languages and an
artificial conflict of interest is created.
India is one of the rare countries that
have given a constitutional guarantee of
primary education through the mother
tongue. But this provision is respected
more in the breach than in the obser¬
vance. Only 58 languages are used as
school languages. The structure of the
education system is such that the higher
languages, such as Sanskrit or Arabic,
has to study four or five languages.
Many, oriented in the dominant
monolingual culture, consider multi¬
lingualism a burden and even go to the
extent of dubbing it the disease of the
poor. In developed countries of the
world, where dominant monolingualism
is the practice, systematic efforts to an¬
nihilate minority languages and cultures
have not only resulted in cultural im¬
poverishment but also a backlash of
revolt by small groups.

The Western mind, operating with a
linear and binary logic, sees opposition
between English and Hindi, English and
other Indian languages, Hindi and Urdu,
Hindi and other Indian languages, domi¬
nant and minority languages. The Indian
intellectuals trained in the ways of the
West also perceive their reality in the
above manner. This runs counter to the
inclusive spirit of Indian logic which
finds a specific role for each of the
elements in a multi-cultural set up. Thus
speaking one language at home and
another outside, one language to com¬
municate with the neighbouring State
and another for intercommunication in
the Union, one or more languages for in¬
ternational communication does not pose
any conflict in the common man's logic.
This is one of the reasons for the growing
estrangement between the masses and the
élite alienated from its own roots.
Many languages militate against the
approach of mass media in the same way
as small land holdings militate against
super farm technology. The reluctance to
use many mother tongues in education is
linked with the reluctance to share power
and economic resources with the people.
A multiplicity of languages, by drawing
attention to many small groups, demands
a more human approach to economic
planning. Thus more languages are a
greater defence of democracy. Therefore
many see in it a threat and inconvenience
to the centralized State.
The Indian experiment must succeed if
an interdependent international order is
to be built on the sound principles of
mutual respect and understanding. As in
other parts of the Third World, Indian
multilingualism and pluriculturalism are
under constant threat from those who
seek, both in theory and in practice, to
impose mono-models. Thus while the
Republic remains multilingual, subtle ef¬
forts are made to create pressures to
make the States dominant monolingual
regions. This is bound to fail. Multil¬
ingualism and pluriculturalism dictate
alternate modes of thinking and alternate
strategies of development. If human in¬
genuity fails to rise to this challenge, then
not only India and the Third World, but
all mankind will have to face chaos and
destruction.

The story of
an alphabet
It was the second spring of the war in
the old Nivkh village of Chaivo. Old
Mamzin, the oldest member of our
Nivkh people which was dying out, was
afraid that he would suddenly go away
to Mly-vo, the land of the departed.
And so he decided to initiate me, a

Nivkh children study a reading primer in their own language. The
Nivkh language Is spoken by some 4,000 people on the island of
Sakhalin and along the estuary of the river Amur. The first Nivkh
primer, using a modified Cyrillic alphabet, was published by author
Vladimir Sanghl, himself of Nivkh origin, and G. Otalna in 1981,
whippersnapper of seven years of age,
into the ways of men, hunting at sea.
But before I was judged fit to step into
the boat with the tough, unsmiling
hunters, I had to take part several times
in the feeding ceremony of the yzgns,
the guardian spirits of the places where
we were to hunt.
From a canvas bag the old man took
a pinch of tea, a pinch of tobacco, some
dried lily bulbs and a small piece of
sugar. Addressing the mysterious jzg«,
he said, "Here we are! We have come
to see you. We are poor and have
nothing." Unable to take my eyes off
his hand, swallowing my saliva, I
listened to the old man with one ear. It
was a long time since we had had sugar
on our table. "We would have liked to
give you more," old Mamzin went on,
"but there isn't any. Have pity on us.
Make everything go well for us.
Amen!" And with a sweeping gesture
he cast the offerings beneath a thick
bush of twisted alder or low cedar.
On the rare sunny days, when wind
and tide bore ice-floes towards the
shore, the old men sailed out to sea in
boats hewn out of poplar trunks. On
the shore, I controlled myself as best I
could; neither running about nor acting
childishly in case the lord of the sea
might think that my pranks were the
result of too easy a life and would
refuse to provide the hunters with a
quarry.
In the evening after a real feast, with
a good reassuring fire crackling away,
the old men would recount the
marvellous myths and legends of the
Nivkh, while I who was lucky enough
to hear them dreamed of the day when
I would be able to write so that I could
record these stories for the enjoyment
of hundreds and thousands of other
children.
In byegone days the Nivkh had their
own form of writing, but later they lost
it. Legend has it that the guilty one was
a Nivkh who had been made responsi¬
ble for guarding the written signs. The
man did not look after the document
properly, and it was drenched with
rain. When good weather returned, the

man spread out the pages in the sun.
But the wind rose and blew away the
leaves inscribed with Nivkh writing.
Ever since then, according to the
legend, the Nivkh have lived without
writing.
In 1930 the Soviet State created in
Leningrad an Institute of the Peoples
of the North for the education of the
twenty-six peoples who lived in the vast
Arctic and sub-Arctic lands stretching
from the Kola peninsula in the west to
Chukotka, Kamchatka and northern
Sakhalin in the east. These peoples are
bound by a common historical destiny
and identical natural and economic
conditions (they practise reindeer rais¬
ing, dog rearing, hunting, and live
from sea mammal and fishing in¬
dustries). They had no writing of their
own.
left to develop Nivkh as a written
language.
Over twenty years ago I began to
write my first poems and stories in my
mother tongue. However my first
book, Nivkh Legends (1961) was
published in Russian translation. When
it appeared, Constantin A. Fedin, the
great Soviet writer in Russian, wrote
me a letter in which he said: "So a
Nivkh writer, a poet of the Nivkhs, has
arisen, and it is up to him to reveal to
all other peoples the heart and soul of
his own." Such words have a binding
force, and I continued to write poetry
and prose.
I was glad that I had spent three years
studying written Nivkh in Leningrad,
at the preparatory section of the
Herzen Institute's Faculty of the
Peoples of the North. Actually, the
In June 1979 an important event
took place in the life of my people: a
new, more accurate and more complete
Nivkh alphabet was adopted. Each
sound of the Nivkh language is now
noted according to principles which
have been organized in a coherent
system.
But it is one thing to create an
alphabet; it is another to introduce a
people to reading. And so, with the
Nivkh specialist Calina A. Otaina, I
began to write a primer and a teaching
course in the basics of Nivkh writing.
The course was published in 1980 and
the primer in 1981. Now Nivkh
children can learn their language with
textbooks.
Adults and children of school age
can thus learn their own language. But
what about the toddlers? Now we had

Russian scholars helped the
Chukches, the Evenki, the Nentsy, the
Eskimos, the Khantes and other
peoples of the North to develop their
own forms of writing. The first Eskimo
primer, which appeared in the Soviet
Union at the beginning of the 1930s, is
still used today in Eskimo schools in
North America.
Latin characters were initially used
for the alphabets of the peoples of the
North. Then, shortly before World
War II, at the request of the peoples
themselves, work began on transcrib¬
ing them into Cyrillic characters. But
war broke out before the work could be
completed.
The war ended in victory, but the
Nivkhs who had studied at the Institute
of the Peoples of the North did not
return from the battlefield. No one was

notation system used there was terribly
ponderous and far from perfect. There
are over forty sounds in Nivkh whereas
the Russian alphabet has only thirty-
three letters. Consequently two and
sometimes three letters which were
often fundamentally incompatible had
to be used to denote those sounds of the
Nivkh language which have no
equivalent in Russian. It was a very
clumsy transcription to handle and
was, in fact, only used in the Institute.
It had not spread to the Nivkh people.
As an adult and the author of several
books, I set myself the goal of creating
a Nivkh alphabet as comprehensive as
those of the other peoples of our multi¬
lingual country and of bringing writing
to our people. It took about five years
to create a new alphabet.
to create a course and a method for
teaching pre-school-age children their
mother tongue. This is a very special
kind of work which called for a great
deal of time and energy; but now it is
finished, and in autumn 1982 it was ap¬
proved at Sakhalin. The task which re¬
mains is to produce a series of text¬
books like those which have been used
for over ten years by many other nor¬
thern peoples. In addition to a
language textbook, the series will con¬
sist of a bilingual dictionary, a manual
for teachers, a reader in the vernacular
language, and an anthology of work by
national writers as well as translations
of the great classics of Russian, Soviet
and world literature. I am currently
preparing translations into Nivkh of
stories by Pushkin and Andersen as
well as Tolstoy's tales for children.

The existence of Nivkh as a written
language opens up to my people the
fabulous treasures of a time-honoured
popular oral tradition and gives them
access to world culture in their own
language. I have sometimes heard it
said that the language of a people
which has very recently emerged from a
patriarchal state is bound to be in¬
capable of expressing the feelings of
our contemporaries and the complex¬
ities of their vision of society and the
world. I do not think this is so. A real
writer can use any language to describe
the present-day life of his people in all
its complexity.
One remarkable result of the cre¬
ation of a written Nivkh language has
been that many gifted Nivkhs are now
turning to creative writing. Young
Nivkhs are also being drawn to the
study of literature, and several of them
are currently students at higher educa¬
tion institutions in Leningrad and
Moscow. Nivkhs who have won doc¬
torates will soon hold teaching posts at
institutes of education at Leningrad
and Juzno-Sachalinsk. The teaching of
Nivkh is also being introduced into col¬
leges of education.
After the Nivkhs (4,400 persons), the
Saami (1,900), the Koriaks (7,500) and
the Dolgans (4,900) have begun to
transcribe their languages and have
already published their first readers.
The Evens (12,000) and the Mansi
(7,700) are working along the same
lines.
The modern world has no right to
neglect any language, whoever it may
belong to and whatever the level of its
development. The neglect and disap¬
pearance of a non-written language
constitute a loss for human culture as a
whole.
The Soviet author Chingiz Aitmatov
is right when he says, "Everyone
should have his point of junction with
the earth." The homeland is the
spiritual culture of all our brother
peoples, but its starting point is your
yurt\ your yaranga', your aaul', the
river of your childhood. It is there that
a man's personality is formed. When
the Kirghiz writer Aitmatov wrote his
story called "Pied dog running by the
waterside", 1 believe that he
understood and felt this Nivkh tale
from within because, although he
thinks on a planetary scale, he is still
deeply attached to Cheker, the
kichlait*, where he was born, beside
the rushing waters of the Kurkureou.
'Yurt: A light, circular movable tent consisting
of skins or felt stretched over a lattice
framework, used by the Kirghiz and other Cen¬
tral Asian peoples.
' Yaranga: a kind of yurt used in the northeastern
regions of Siberia.
'Aoul: a village in the Caucasus or central Asia.
'Kichlak: a village of central Asia.

Spain's language
mosaic
The Spanish Constitution of 1978
recognizes the plurilingualism of the
Spanish State, which has four official
languages: Castilian (or Spanish) which
is the official language throughout
Spain; Catalan, or the language spoken
in Catalonia, the Valencia region and
the Balearic islands; Gallego (or Gali-
cian), which is the language of Galicia;
and Basque (or Euskera), the language
spoken in the Basque country and
Navarre. Twenty-two million Spaniards
live in regions where only one official
language (Castilian) is spoken, and
nearly sixteen million live in areas with
two official languages (see table on
page 26).
As the official language of the State,
Castilian is a language which all
Spaniards are required to know by law.

The language of Castile,
Castillan Spanish, is the official
language of all Spain, But it is
also an international language
which is spoken on several con¬
tinents and especially throughout
Hispanoamérica, In Spain three
other languages share official
status with it in their respective
communities. They are Catalan,
Euskera (Basque) and Gallego

language of all branches of govern¬

press, radio and television only use
Castilian apart from one Barcelona

small number of radio and television
stations broadcasting in Catalan,
Euskera or Gallego. Lastly, Castilian is
the vehicle of communication of

language groups.

A TREASURY OF TONGUES
Although, like other European
languages, Castilian is suffering more
and more from penetration by English,
especially as far as so-called "mass
culture" is concerned, its survival is en¬
sured not only by its ranking as the
most widespread language and its
resulting greater public impact, but
also by its international character, and
especially the fact that it is spoken in
almost the whole of Latin America.
With this large market open to it, it has
a competitive edge in both book and
newspaper publishing and in the pro¬
duction of films, radio and TV pro¬
grammes, gramophone records, and so
on, compared with the minority
languages, whose efforts in these direc¬
tions are more costly and require more
protection from the authorities. This
preponderance is illustrated by the fact
that, out ofthe 29,286 books published
in Spain in I98I, 26,721 or over 91
per cent represented titles published
in Castilian.
Catalan is a Romance language like
Castilian and is spoken mainly on
Spanish territory, but also in south¬
eastern France in the "Pyrénées-
Orientales" Department in the town
of Alghero on the Italian island of Sar¬
dinia, and in the principality of An¬
dorra. Catalan had a glorious period
from the thirteenth to the fifteenth cen¬
tury, when its literature flourished, but
it lost its official status in the eighteenth
century, as a result of the War of Suc¬
cession. The three main Catalan-
speaking areas forming part of the
Spanish State are as follows:
Catalonia. The Catalan people have
never ceased speaking their own
language, not even at times when they
were persecuted. In 1931, with the com¬
ing of the Republic, Catalonia regained
its autonomy and with it the official use
of Catalan until 1939, when General
Franco established a rigidly centralist
régime and banned the public use ofthe
minority languages. Since 1979,
Catalonia has had a new Statute of
Autonomy, which lays down the of¬
ficial character of Catalan, together
with Castilian.
In all Catalonian schools, the two
languages are compulsory, regardless
of which is the language of instruction.
In secondary and higher education,
both languages are used as vehicles of
instruction. The output of books in
Catalan has been growing steadily in
the past few years: in 1981, 2,140 titles
were published in that language. On the
other hand, the position in the other
communication media is less satisfac¬
tory: only one of the six daily
newspapers published in the capital,
Barcelona, is entirely in Catalan; the
two State-owned television channels
usually broadcast in Castilian and
devote only twenty-six hours a week to
Catalan; radio stations do not feature
many programmes in Catalan either,
although there are several FM stations
whose programmes arc exclusively in
that language; Catalan-speaking films
are likewise few in number. This situa¬
tion bears no relation to the socio-
linguistic facts of Catalonia, where
most of the population (68 per cent)
speaks Catalan and some 85 per cent of
the population is reckoned to under¬
stand it, although it is true that the in¬
habitants include many Castilian-
speakers from other parts of Spain.
The Valencia region. Owing to
special historical circumstances and to
the fact that part ofthe Valencia region
is Castilian-spcaking, the autoch¬
thonous language has tended to lose
more ground: for example, in Valencia
and Alicante, the two largest cities, less
than 40 per cent of the people habitual¬
ly speak Valencian, although some 80
per cent of the population as a whole
can understand it. Furthermore, the
form of the language spoken in the
Valencia region has given rise to con¬
troversy between those who claim that
Valencian is an independent language
separate from Catalan and those who
regard it in the light of historical and
linguistic considerations as being a
regional variant of Catalan. In general,
the advocates of the former view, who
are a socially very influential minority,
are not interested in their "language"
being used for public purposes,
whereas the second school, while not
overlooking the dialectical features of
the language, demand that it be fully
standardized and used in public. The
Statute of Autonomy of the Valencian
"Community" officially recognizes
the two languages, but only in regard to
the easternmost districts, since the
hinterland is Castilian-spcaking.
Tlie Balearic Islands. It is reckoned
that some 80 per cent of the population
speaks Catalan in one of its different
Autonomous Communities of Spain
in which there is a second official language

The Statute of Autonomy for the
Balearics recognizes the official
character of Catalan as a specific
language of the archipelago, together
with Castilian.
Galician (GaUego). Galician is also a
Romance language that is closely
related to Castilian and is spoken in the
north-western corner of the Iberian
peninsula. In the Middle Ages, the
language spread southwards and was
responsible for the formation of Por¬
tuguese. The number of Galician-
speakcrs is more or less the same as the
number of inhabitants of the region, to
which almost a million Galician-
speaking emigrants must be added.
The 1981 Statute of Autonomy for
Galicia recognizes Galician as a specific
language and accords it official status,
together with Castilian. The revival of
Galician is taking place at a pace which
varies from sector to sector: for in¬
stance, while only 41 per cent of all
schoolchildren received instruction in
Galician in the 1980-1981 academic
year, a large number of lectures were
given in the language at university
level. Similarly, although there is no
daily newspaper written entirely in
Galician, a number of scientific
periodicals are published in the
language. In addition, 201 books in
Galician were published in 1981. Gali¬
cian radio and television programmes
are still very few in number.
Euskera, the Basque language, . is
unrelated to any other language spoken
in Europe. Its origins are uncertain. On
account of its peculiarity, it has at¬
tracted the interest of many linguists
and anthropologists. Today Euskera is
1. Euskera or Euskara is the Basque name for the language, which is traditionally known as
Vascuence in Castilian Spanish.
2. In the Statute of Autonomy the autochthonous language is referred to as Valenciano, the
traditional name given to the Catalan language in the region.
3. Basque is an official language only in the northern part of Navarre.

spoken in seven regions, three belong¬
ing to France (Basse Navarre, Laburdi
and Zuberoa) and four belonging to
Spain (Navarre, and Vascongadas or
the Basque Provinces: Alava, Guipúz¬
coa and Vizcaya).
Although some 2,000 years ago the
Euskera-language territory covered an
area four or five times larger than it
does today, it declined slowly until the
eighteenth century, and more quickly
since then. Today it is reckoned that
Basque-speakers account for only 1 1
per cent of the population of Navarre.
As for the Vascongadas or, to give
them their official title, the
"Autonomous Community of the
Basque Country" some 23 per cent of
the population speak Euskera.
The difficulties involved in achieving
linguistic standardization for Euskera
are greater than those for Catalan or
Galician, not only on account of the
ground it has lost in its home region but
also because of its unique nature, the
difficulty of learning it, and the cre¬
ation of neologisms. Even so, despite
the fact that in the 1960s Euskera seem¬
ed to be a dying language, there are
clear signs that it is now on the road to
recovery. Political autonomy (the
Statute was approved in 1979) is not the
only factor accounting for this situa¬
tion; there has also been a widespread
campaign to inform public opinion.
Special mention must be made of the
ikastolas, private schools in which
Euskera is the language of instruction.
These schools are now largely in¬
tegrated into the public educational
system. In the I981-I982 academic
year, more than 15 per cent of Basque
schoolchildren were taught in Euskera,
while the rest were taught in Castilian
Above, the fiesta of San Fermín

peninsula. Photo below shows

with Euskera as a compulsory separate
subject.
Shortcomings are more serious as far
as the Basque-language situation in the
media is concerned, in that there are
only two bilingual daily newspapers
containing features and information in
Euskera, although a number of
magazines are published in the
language. The State radio and tele¬
vision system does not broadcast pro¬
grammes in Euskera, although a
Basque regional government television
centre began broadcasting for four
hours a day in 1983, and this may go
some way to filling the gap. In 1981,
224 books were published in Euskera.
In short, the well-worn image of
Spain is changing as the new situation
of four official languages comes into
effect although the change has as yet
scarcely begun. Thousands of signposts
have been replaced or supplemented on
motorways and roads and in towns and
villages, but much still remains to be
done. Government departments are
endeavouring to adjust to the demands
of official bilingualism, in instances
where this exists. Schools and other
educational institutions have incor¬
porated or are incorporating languages
that were formerly banned into their
curricula, although the re-adaptation
process is not as rapid as might be wish¬
ed. The communication media are fac¬
ing material difficulties in broadcasting
in these languages, and consequently
the authorities should give them en¬
couragement. We are facing a historic
challenge; if we take it up successfully,
it will be possible to say that everyone
has gained from it, in that the
centuries-old cultures expressed in
these four languages, whose disap¬
pearance would have been a serious
loss for world culture, will have been
preserved and developed and the young
Spanish democracy will have been
strengthened.

The culture shock of
language learning
Until the beginning of this century,
foreign languages were taught like dead
languages such as Latin. On the one
hand there was the vocabulary, on the
other the grammar, two quite separate
fields of study. Translation was the
main teaching method.
This so-called traditional conception
was criticized and replaced here and
there, by the audio-oral method in the
United States and by the direct method
in Europe. These methods enjoyed a
certain success in the years after World
War II and marked the first departure
of modern-language teaching methods
from those of teaching dead languages.
They were based on the principle of
treating a foreign language from the
oral point of view, of encouraging the
pupil to speak (through question and
answer), and of bringing him into con¬
tact with the everyday environment
(learning how to name things).
In the 1960s and 1970s audio-visual
methods appeared in Europe in the
wake of structural linguistics, which
were then winning acceptance in
university teaching. These methods
were based on a structural-global
methodology originating in research in¬
to the basic foundations of the
language (Basic English, Français fon¬
damental). Their aim was to present a
language in the act of communication,
through simulated dialogues accom¬
panied by situations depicted in im¬
ages. Systematized exercises were used
to enable the learner to acquire the
basic structures of the language before
going on to dramatizations in class to
teach the learner how to use his
knowledge in different situations.
However, in the 1970s audio-visual
methods also came under fire. In
linguistics the success of the concept of
enunciation was dethroning the idea of
language as an object of study.
Language was no longer considered as
an absolute, disembodied entity but as
an act of communication linked to the
speaker's situation as a producer in
society. The notion of linguistic com¬
petence was replaced by that of com¬
municative competence. A new
hypothesis appeared: the learner's
motivation to learn a foreign language
may be related to the extent to which
the language is taught in a way cor¬
responding to his needs. For example,
the specialist may only learn what
relates to his own speciality (teaching
with specific objectives). As this notion

language teaching and been replaced by
an attitude towards a given learner and
his needs. Thus began the era which
still exists of the functional and the
communicative.
Today, on the eve of the 21st cen¬

language teaching. There is the scien¬

linguistics and a belief that, in the
human sciences, modern thought can
no longer be divided into watertight
compartments. It is already apparent
that certain attempts to create common
ground for interdisciplinary reflection
lead to démystification which is
beneficial to science and education.
There is a new social situation owing
to the growth of the school population
and the number of people requiring
training; its main characteristic is a
change in the symbolic social function
of education. The institutional
character of education is no longer the
same, and differs from one cultural
context to another.
In some countries the task may be to
promote an active form of learning by
encouraging pupils to participate, in
others social customs will require
teaching and learning to be conceived
as a "show". The approach will de¬
pend ultimately on the society's image
of the role and power of the word.
Perhaps the most important develop¬
ment in the teaching of foreign
languages is a new awareness of the
inlercultural issues involved. This
awareness alone can bring about a final
break with the universalist conception
of language teaching, which still per¬
sists in a different modern guise. The
idea has been launched that the pupil's
essential purpose should be to learn
about the foreign culture and in so do¬
ing to learn about his own, that the
"culture shock" of discovering
something new and different should
also lead to self-discovery. In this set¬
ting the teaching of languages would be
above all an opportunity to become
aware of different mental approaches,
of the different forms of imagination
which exist in different societies and
cultures.

The translation
explosion
A rapid growth is taking place in
translating at the present time, both in
terms of quantity and of quality. Infor¬
mation supplied by 61 countries in¬
dicates that during 1978 alone 57,158
books were translated. This pheno¬
menon is explained by the constantly
growing need of individuals and
peoples to communicate. It is now
realized that, irrespective of national,
social and linguistic differences, it is
only through cultural co-operation that
progress in science, literature or educa¬
tion can be achieved.
The extraordinary changes repre¬
sented by modern communication
techniques give men ever greater access
to cultures other than their own. In this
way, each of us can discover new
values, become aware of modes of
behaviour with which we were
previously unfamiliar and get to know
mankind in all its diversity. This
phenomenon, which has developed
particularly since the Second World
War, has considerably increased the
demands made on translators, because

For many years Unesco has sought to contribute to a broader international understanding of (he world 's lirerar}* 	 _
translation and publication, mainly in English and French, of representative works of literatures written in the less widely known languages.
Since the inception of this "Unesco Collection of Representative Works" nearly 800 (irles have been published from over 40 Oriental and
some 20 European languages, as well as from languages of Africa and ftceania. Above, covers of four works in the Collection.

it means that one must be in a position
to overcome the obstacles caused by a
multiplicity of languages.
The existence of many languages, as
symbolized by the Tower of Babel, has
often been deplored in the past. For
centuries, hope persisted that a new
lingua franca .would emerge which
would become the common language
of all mankind. Descartes pleaded for
the creation of a language that would
be as universal as mathematics and the
idea of creating an ideal language
occurred to many other philosophers,
logicians and mathematicians, such as
Leibniz, Carnap, Wittgenstein, Russell.
Up to the 1950s, more than four hun¬
dred so-called "universal" languages
had been invented.
These efforts enriched linguistics and
led to the currently popular idea of
translations by computer. But the
limits of human capacity and of the
capacity of the machine are known.
The flexibility of a language cannot be
confined within a formal framework, it
remains and will always remain in the
domain of human intelligence and sen¬
sitivity. No machine can convey the
"genius of a language" as a conscien¬
tious, experienced and gifted translator
can.
Some people still imagine that in¬
creasingly sophisticated computers will
be able to perfect a "working
language" which will be so simple and
efficient as to be accessible to all.
Sooner or later, perhaps, such an ar¬
tificial language will come into use. But
is it possible or desirable? Nowadays
linguistic groups assert their identity
through the right to express themselves
in their own languages because
languages are symbols of indepen¬
dence. There are 2,796 languages and

The problems of translation have been recognized since antiquity and were expressed by St.

THE THREE TsTEACHING, TRANSLATING, TRANSCRIBING
8,000 dialects in the world, but more
than two-thirds of the world's popula¬
tion speak 27 languages, while less than
one third speak the others, so that pro¬
fessional intercourse, which is
regulated by economic and political
needs, draws upon a limited number of
languages.
It may be asked whether such a
limitation is justified from a cultural
point of view. The new multilingual
African States, for example, are mak¬
ing efforts to assert themselves by
developing their national and written
languages. These languages, which
were suppressed or neglected in the
past, are now being improved. They are
being enriched through direct or in¬
direct contacts with other cultures, thus
opening the way for the development
of national literatures, sciences and
techniques. Translating has an impor¬
tant rôle in this process, and the re¬
quirements of the African continent in
translators and translations are
enormous.
Translating has special respon-
sibiHties to national cuUures of the
smaller peoples and to the less-widely
spoken languages. It has a twofold
function to disseminate these cultures
abroad through their irreplaceable
original identity, and to enrich and fer¬
tilize them through contributions from
elsewhere. Translated books preserve
and express these two functions, they
serve as a link between the particular
and the universal.
In the past, translations served as a
leaven. In the ninth century, the works
translated by the brothers Cyril and
Methodius, who invented the alphabet
of the Slavs, made possible the
development of national literatures
throughout the Slav-speaking nations
of Europe. Similarly, the flowering of
German prose was preceded by
Luther's translation of the Bible.
Translation has a multiplier effect on
the scientific, literary and aesthetic
potential of the contents of books.
In Unesco Member States taken as a
whole, an average 39 per cent of all
books published are translated. The
countries with the highest output of
translated works are (according to the
1982 Unesco Statistical Yearbook
figures relating to 1978): France 8,350
(figure for 1977 and 1978 combined).
Federal Republic of Germany 7,168,
USSR 7,023, Spain 5,543, Japan 2,307,
Denmark 2,014, Italy 1,738, United
Kingdom 1,494.
The fact that a number of countries,
especially developing countries, pro¬
duce fewer translations is largely due to
the high cost (authors' and translators'
royalties), to the lack of printing
facilities and high production costs
(printing and paper).
The International Federation of
Translators, which comprises 40
associations of scientific, technical and
literary translators and translation
theoreticians, is a non-governmental
organization attached to Unesco. Since
its establishment in 1953, it has been
under the direction of personalities
remarkable for their enthusiasm and
devotion to translation, including the
late Pierre-François Caillé who presid¬
ed over it for many years. The principal
aims of the Federation are to bring
together and organize translators'
associations throughout the world, to
defend the moral and legal rights of
translators, to further the circulation
of translated books and of the cultural
values of all peoples, and to assert the
prestige of the translator in the world
of today.
The numerous initiatives undertaken
by the Federation include the organiza¬
tion of world congresses, of national
and international meetings, round
tables and symposia, publication ofthe
review "Babel", the circulation and
implementation of the Recommenda¬
tion of Unesco Member States regar¬
ding the moral and legal rights of
translators and participation in the In¬
ternational Book Commission. That all
these initiatives have been possible is
largely thanks to the assistance of
Unesco. As Mr Amadou-Mahtar
M'Bow, Director-General of Unesco
has pointed out, "translators maintain
the ongoing dialogue between different
civilizations and have thus contributed
to the contacts and harmonious rela¬
tions between them".
I^EKHLIVANOV, Ilya
Bulgaria's first
language laboratory
Over the past five years, Bulgarian ar¬
chaeologists have brought to light rich
evidence of the intense literary activity
of the disciples of St. Cyril and St.
Methodius (brothers who in 863 in¬
vented the Cyrillic alphabet) after their
arrival in Bulgaria. In 1978, the re¬
mains of a monastery were found near
Ravna on the shores of the Black Sea
some 70 kilometres west of Varna. So
far 200 inscriptions and 600 rock carv¬
ings have been uncovered which have
given a great impetus to Slav
epigraphical studies.
What conclusions can now be drawn
from these discoveries? According to
the Bulgarian archaeologist Kazimir
Popkonstantinov, the monastery was
built during the second half of the ninth
century on a site of about 8,000 square
metres. A church, a 35-metre-long
scriptorium, living quarters and a bath¬
house have been uncovered. An in¬
scription indicates that the church was
built in 889. The monastery was
doubtless destroyed during the
Pecheneg invasion in the second half of
the eleventh century.
The limestone walls of the church
and the scriptorium are covered with
inscriptions and paintings. The inscrip¬
tions are in several different scripts, in¬
cluding Runic, Greek, Glagolitic and
Cyrillic, and some are inscribed in both
Greek and Old Bulgarian. They repre¬
sent the beginnings of the creation of a
medieval Bulgarian and Slav literature.
Notable among the drawings are
representations of horsemen and
shamans (pagan priests) as well as of
the "horse" and the "cross", symbols
Two ofthe 200 inscriptions carv¬
ed on stonework which have so

sion. There are also drawings of
various animals stags, goats, wolves
and hares.
Vignettes and engravings similar to
those that embellish the most ancient
manuscripts in Old Bulgarian are also
to be seen on the limestone walls, and
the characters used in the inscriptions
are identical in form and size to those
on the old parchments. Clearly, the
early Bulgarian scribes saw writing,
whether on stone, ceramics or parch¬
ment, as the prime means of furthering
their mission of instruction and
evangelization.
What evidence is there that the
disciples of St. Cyril and St. Methodius
worked in this particular monastery?
First, its location, a three-hour ride on
horseback from Pliska, the first capital
ofthe Bulgarian State, founded in 681,
and the seat of Prince Boris I (852-889).
Thus the monastery was a haven far
from the disturbing influence of both
the Byzantine clergy and the pagan
proto-Bulgars who opposed the desire
of Prince Boris to establish an indepen¬
dent Bulgarian Church whose mission
would be to propagate Christian doc¬
trine in the common language.
Furthermore, the name of Saint Cle¬
ment, who as Pope Clement I (88-97)
was the third successor of St. Peter in
Rome, is mentioned in one of the in¬
scriptions, and it was the brothers Cyril
and Methodius who revived veneration
for him as a Saint during the ninth
century.
Finally, the layout of the church of
Ravna is a faithful reproduction of that
of the church at PHska, the most im¬
portant architectural monument of this
period still preserved in the Balkans.
This was no accident; all the buildings
of the monastery were erected at the
same time as part of an ensemble to
which the State had devoted very con¬
siderable resources with the aim of
creating a religious and cultural centre
of the highest importance.
In August 1982, a number of experts
on ancient Slav culture from eight
countries attended a Symposium on
medieval Bulgar literature and
language, the most recent in a series of
meetings organized every two years by
the Bulgarian Academy of Sciences and
the Clement Ohrid University of Sofia.
The participants visited the Ravna site
and their examination of the recent
finds gave rise to keen debate and
discussion.
Frederick Kortland, of the Universi¬
ty of Leyden, in the Netherlands,
summed up the opinions of the experts
when he declared that: "The ar¬
chaeological finds at Ravna may well
cause us to revise and reconsider our
views on ancient Slav history."

Unesco meeting
reviews languages
as cultural expression
A Unesco symposium on languages as
an expression of cultural identity and an
instrument of intercultural communica¬
tion was held in Venice from 3 to 6 May
1983. Among the main questions
discussed at the meeting, attended by
16 specialists from the different world
regions, were the identification of
"linguistic unlversals" features com¬
mon to all languages, and the prospects
for linguistic studies offered by new in¬
formation technologies, especially infor¬
matics. The results of the symposium
will be the theme of a publication which
is scheduled to appear in 1984.
Vatican library
treasures in facsimile
shown at Unesco
Superb examples of manuscripts from
medieval and Renaissance Europe and
the Islamic world, reproduced in
faultless facsimiles, were exhibited at
Unesco's Paris HQ from 9 to 16 May
(see page 28). Ranging from
magnificently illuminated religious
works to maps and treatises on animals
and heraldry, the exhibits were produced
using the latest techniques for making
exact copies, including scanners and
lasers. Opening the exhibition, Mr.
Amadou-Mahtar M'Bow, the Director-
General of Unesco, noted that it was an
"exceptional event" which revealed the
great promise of new reproduction
methods for making available the
treasures of the Vatican Library and
others around the world.
Language teaching
in developing countries
The content and methods of language
teaching in developing countries were
examined at an international symposium
of specialists held at Unesco's Paris HQ
from 25 to 29 April 1983. Among the
themes discussed were the changing ob¬
jectives of language education as new
development requirements emerge, the
impact of new linguistic and pedagogical
approaches on language teaching, and
the preparation of teaching materials
with improved relevance to national
needs. The symposium was part of
Unesco's efforts to promote mother
tongues as instruments of education and
culture.
