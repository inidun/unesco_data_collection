@ Guatemala
7th century Mayan Indian dancer
This dish, recovered from a 7th century A.D. Mayan tomb at Uaxactun, in the Peten jungle of Guatemala,
was ritually " killed " by being pierced at the centre, and then placed with other furnishings in the Mayan
grave. Cracks show where broken fragments were reassembled. The Mayas customarily " killed " the objects
they placed in graves for the use of the dead on their journey to the other world. Mayan potters made a
great variety of ceramic works in the shape of snakes, birds, men and gods, on which the decorations were
painted, engraved or wrought in relief. Painted pottery designs were richly warm in colour: black against
a yellow or orange ground with details of red, brown or white. Photo shows painting of a male dancer.

THE PUBLIC
AND
MODERN ART
Some unexpected findings
of a Unesco-backed inquiry
How does the general public judge modern art? To what
extent are the paintings of famous modern artists such as
Picasso, Klee, Miro, Mondrian and Pollock really [appreciated
by the average man or woman? This issue of the "Unesco
Courier " offers some tentative answers based on the findings
of a public opinion poll carried out in Toronto, Canada, by the
International Council of Museums with the aid of Unesco.
Readers who would like to compare their own reactions to
modern art with the results obtained in Toronto are invited to
turn at once to the section " Anyone Can Play " on page 18 and
to the centre colour pages.

P
1^^. USKIN once described a
new painting by Whistler as "a pot
of paint thrown in the face of the
public." By its response to an inquiry
carried out recently in Toronto,
Canada, the public might be said to
have picked up the pot of paint and
thrown it straight back into the face
of the modern artist.
The inquiry was carried out as a
public opinion poll in the city of
Toronto, by the International Council
of Museums with the aid of Unesco
and the Canadian National Commission
for Unesco.
This poll has revealed that when it
comes to tastes in modern art people
may not always know what they like
but they are extremely vehement In
proclaiming what they don't like. They
tend to like paintings of a type familiar
to them, but bridle at "jumbled up"
styles or innovations generally.
The results of the poll were
first published in Unesco's quarterly
magazine "Museum", destined for
museum specialists (1). The poll itself
consisted in showing a selection of
modern paintings, grouped according
to certain categories, to a repre¬
sentative sampling of the population of
Toronto over the age of 15. Persons
interviewed were given four sets of
10 paintings on colour postcards to
examine. The persons interviewed
were not given either the names of the
artists or the titles of the works.
Works of art in the inquiry were
nearly all by artists working between
1900 and 1960. In most sets there
was at least one "control" painting
from an earlier period. With few
exceptions the control painting proved
the most liked. Millet's "The Ángelus",
(1) 'Museum", Vol. XXII, No.
Price 90p, $3.00 or 10 F.
3/4, 1969.
painted in 1859 and now well known
(see photo page 7), was voted top
favourite among the 220 paintings
covered by the inquiry.
While the choice of favourites
varied, people were emphatically
agreed on what they did not like. The
most consistently unpopular paintings
were those of Dubuffet (represented
by "La Barbe des Incertains Retours",
see page 7, and "Landscape of the
Mental"). The first of these was voted
down by 78 per cent of the res¬
pondents.
Among the "champion hates" were
Léger, De Kooning, Miro and Pollock.
Certain paintings by other famous
modern artists such as Paul Klee and
Picasso came way down in the order
of preference and yet an equal number
of Picasso's paintings were highly
rated. (Eight were placed among the
four top choices in various sets and
eight among the four bottom choices.)

"In the arts," says William Withrow, Director of the Art Gallery of Ontario,
"we tend to love the things which are most familiar. Exposure means familiarity,
and familiarity, in this case, breeds the reverse of contempt. In all efforts to
educate we must move from the known to the unknown... This is particularly
essential in art education." Above, visitors to the Museum of Modern Art in
New York listen to the comments of an art expert on Picasso's Three
Musicians (in full colour on our cover).

THE PUBLIC AND MODERN ART (Continued)
'Unnatural colours'
make the public see red
One Picasso work, "The Old Guita¬
rist" painted in 1904 at the end of
his Blue Period rated top place in its
set (see page 16), and even his wilfully-
distorted still-life "La Casserole Email-
lée" (1944) gained second place in its
group perhaps because it has a very
juggy-looking jug (see colour reproduc¬
tion, No. 6, page 19).
Léger is another artist whose works
won high and low ratings. His "Mother
and Child", for example, was placed
next to the top in its group, perhaps
because the subject was easily re¬
cognizable. Mondrian's paintings,
however, were always and strongly
disliked.
From the survey a somewhat clearer
picture of public likes and dislikes in
modern art seems to have been brought
into focus one based on something
more than mere guesswork and in¬
tuition. However, the committee of
specialists which organized the poll has
hastened to point out that it would be
unwise to draw definitive conclusions
from its findings. It emphasizes that
the inquiry was primarily designed to
establish, test and prove a method of
research which now needs to be tried
out in other countries.
Yet even the preliminary results, as
yet uncomputerized, have been found
so revealing that it is difficult to ignore
them. They show, for instance, that
the public, as represented by the
Canadian sampling, is consistent in its
likes and dislikes and that age, sex,
occupation and education make little
difference in the results obtained.
T

HE inquiry reinforces an
assumption commonly made by mu¬
seum directors and art specialists that
the public's taste in art is strongly
conservative. Dr. Theodore Heinrich,
a member of the Toronto inquiry work¬
ing committee and a former director of
the Royal Ontario Museum, comments
on this point in his evaluation of the
preliminary findings published in "Mu¬
seum."
As he puts it: "Despite all the claims
within the professional communications
field . . . that the inventions of the
current generation have vastly in¬
creased the pace of assimilation of
information and dissemination of know¬
ledge, and of certain artists and critics
that ergo, any novelty in art will enjoy
equally rapid acceptance, we can now
confidently state the contrary.
"As far as art is concerned, the long
observed peculiarity that there exists
a generally stable gap of two genera¬
tions or a minimum of half a century
between important creative innovation
and its general acceptance by the
ordinary public remains true. For all
the technical innovations in commu¬
nications and the vast spread of edu¬
cation, we doubt that the acceptance
gap has been shortened by so much as
a week."
D
R. Heinrich finds it signif¬
icant that three of the most violently
rejected pictures in the Toronto poll
"Soldiers Playing Cards", by Léger,
"Brücke III" by Feininger and "Compo¬
sition in Blue" by Mondrian (see colour
reproduction, No. 6, page 20) were all
painted in 1917 that is, just over 50
years ago, though less radical paint¬
ings by Léger and Feininger scored
high rankings in the poll.
Equally revealing, reports Dr. Hein¬
rich, are some of the results obtained
by the use of "control" paintings in 20
of the 23 sets of postcard reproduc¬
tions. These "controls" were chosen
mainly from the works of artists of the
second half of the 19th century, but
also included works by Chardin (18th
century) and Vermeer (17th century)
and a number of more "conservative"
20th century paintings.
With few exceptions, the control
paintings ended up in the most favour¬
ed positions and the next two highest
rankings in each set generally went to
works closest in spirit to the control
paintings.
"Regardless of the range of style
and expression offered in any one
group," writes Dr. Heinrich, "the
choice went unerringly in favour of the
least radical, the most nearly conser¬
vative paintings available. Such other¬
wise popular artists as Degas, Renoir
and Monet all dropped to middle or
low rankings when their more experi¬
mental, less conventional pictures
were included."
Commenting on some of the conclu¬
sions that can already be drawn
from the inquiry, Dr Heinrich notes
that if people are offered a sufficiently
wide range of paintings, they are quite
prepared to demonstrate by a choice,
if not by a reasoned explanation, which
painting they like, regardless of how
little they know about art.
Generally speaking, however, people
find it much easier to say what they
do not like. "Our study seems to
show," writes Dr. Heinrich, that 'like'
is a charged word susceptible of wide
interpretations, none of which necess¬
arily includes the idea of enjoyment,
but that 'dislike' is a widely shared
sensation or emotion."
The inquiry revealed the sort of
things in modern art that people clearly
dislike, that upset them and that even
arouse their hostility. Among these dis¬
likes are non-traditional representa¬
tions of religious subjects (as in Gau¬
guin's "Yellow Christ", see page 17),
angular spiky lines (with the notable
exception of the works of Bernard Buf¬
fet), distortion of familiar objects, pic¬
tures expressing menace or doom
(although Van Gogh's "Cornfield with
Crows" was an exception, see pages
16-17), and paintings which give
people the impression that the artist is
trying to fool them. Also, and
unaccountably, pictures of fish appear
to be disliked.
w
V W HAT people dislike above
all is- a painting that is unintelligible to
them.
"They are accustomed in verbal
terms to clear, declarative statements
and expect the same in art," writes
Dr. Heinrich. "It no longer appears that
they expect a painting to tell a story
or point a moral, but unless it presents
an apprehensible image which they can
at least feel, they will reject it.
"We found gratifyingly little rejection
on grounds of indecency or racial pre¬
judice," he reports, "but over and over
again encountered the feeling that our
respondents were being put upon by
artists who didn't care to be 'under¬
stood' by ordinary people. They are
clearly of the opinion that 'good' art
has meaning and is meant to be fairly
readily grasped by anyone of average
intelligence.
"Visual confusion upsets them and
they complain of it under diverse cir¬
cumstances it often seems to mean
a densely activated surface but, almost
as often, either prolific detail or appa¬
rently unrelated but insistent detail.

"References to social problems
seem... to be out of place. Images
overtly or otherwise suggestive of
catastrophe, human or social decay or
other negative aspects of life as they
understand it are offensive and viewed
as deliberately destructive. What is
commonplace on television in the way
of violence and other distortions of life
is not, in their view, equally accept¬
able as subject matter for painting."
Other reactions noted by the art
specialists in Toronto:
Geometrical forms are only accept¬
ed if dominant and simple, and circles
and ovals seem to be preferable to
squares and rectangles, but must not
be "blurry" or "fuzzy".
The male form may be depicted
more or less as it is ; distortions of
the female shape are not tolerated to
any degree.
"Drab," "dull" or "jarring" (usually
meaning "bright") colours are often
criticized. Predominant reds or greens
are found highly distasteful except in
landscapes. Purple and strong violet
arouse no comment. "Unnatural"
colours are resented (as in Gauguin's
"Yellow Christ," and also in the same
artist's "Three Puppies"). Yet Franz
Marc's "Tower of Blue Horses" (see
pages 10-11) received a high ranking,
the fact that the horses are recogniz¬
able as horses perhaps overcoming
objections to their "unreal" colour.
In his final summing up of find¬
ings that emerge from the Toronto
inquiry, Dr. Heinrich notes encoura¬
gingly that even those persons who .
claimed a total disinterest in art of any
kind, let alone contemporary art, prov¬
ed to have some opinions and display¬
ed some feeling for art. "These people,
a great many more than we think, are
accessible and can be pursuaded to
become interested in modern art," he
affirms.
At a time when a profound re-exam¬
ination of the role of the museum in
modern life Is being made throughout
the world, do the preliminary findings
of the inquiry suggest new ways in
which the museum can help bridge
the gap between what today's artist
creates and what the general public is
prepared to accept?
One member of the working com¬
mittee who thinks that they do is
Mr. William Withrow, Director of the
Art Gallery of Ontario. The clear

FOR WHOM THE BELLS TOLL. Jean-François Millet's The Ángelus (above
and in colour. No. 9 on page 25), painted in 1859, certainly "rang the bell" with
people polled in the Toronto inquiry on the public and modern art. It was rated top
favourite out of the 220 paintings used in the survey. Paintings by Renoir, Cézanne
and Monet also found favour with the public whose tastes have been clearly shown
to lean towards well-known, older works. At the other end of the scale it was "thumbs
down" for Jean Dubuffet's La Barbe des Incertains Retours, (below) painted a
century after The Ángelus; nearly 80 per cent found Dubuffet's work totally incom¬
prehensible, many stating flatly that it was "not art". Other famous painters, such
as Léger, de Kooning, Miro and Pollock, received scant credit in the Toronto poll.

Toronto's choices
in order of preference
Right, a set of 10 postcards used in the Toronto inquiry on modern painting. The paintings
shown here are numbered from 1 to 10 in descending order of preference. No. 1, Vermeer's
The Artist in his Studio, being the painting most preferred and No. 10, the least. This set
includes the Picasso painting reproduced in full colour on our front cover which was ranked 7th.
The inquiry was carried out using postcard-size colour reproductions of paintings in 23 sets
of 10 cards per set. Each interviewee was shown only 4 sets of 10 cards. For one of these
sets he (or she) was invited to place the paintings in order of preference and was then asked
to answer a number of questions, such as: "Have you seen any of these pictures before?";
"Can you see any reason why they should have been placed together in a group ?" (the Toronto
researchers had arranged for each set to present a common overall idea, link, theme, form or
pattern).
This last question was asked about each of the other 3 sets for which the interviewee was
asked to designate only two works: the one he liked most and the one he liked least. It should
be emphasized that neither the names of the painters nor the names of the paintings were revealed
by the interviewers. Most sets contained a "control" painting by a famous artist not from the
20th century. Here the control is the Vermeer which, interestingly enough, came out No. 1.
After studying the order of preference indicated by the persons interviewed and the reasons
advanced, the Toronto investigators concluded that "realism, spatial depth and clear outlines
were strongly preferred", and that paintings considered too "satirical" or "abstract" were
rejected : the Vieira da Silva with its predominance of red, was not at all liked and was classed
last in this set.
This issue reproduces (in black and white and colour) eleven other sets of paintings out of the
total of 23 used in the poll. The remarks and comments contained in the accompanying captions
are largely based on the observations of the art specialists in Toronto who examined the results,
particularly Theodore A. Heinrich, Professor of the History of Art at York University, Toronto,
whose special analysis of the findings, published in Unesco's quarterly magazine "Museum",
has been extremely useful.

THE PUBLIC AND MODERN ART
(Continued)
relationship shown by the inquiry be¬
tween familiarity with a work of art
and the public's preference for that
work provides one obvious line of
approach.
"In all efforts to educate," writes
Mr. Withrow, "begin with the known
(i.e. the loved and accepted) and move
to the unknown. This is a simple and
well-known pedagogical principle
which naturally operates effectively in
all fields, but is particularly essential
in art education. Obvious ? Yes, but
how many times has the principle been
violated or ignored in a museum tour
or lecture with the result that the au¬
dience became restless before the lec¬
turer had a chance to win confidence

and move through prejudices to a new
appreciation of the unfamiliar?"
There are implications too, Mr. With-
row points out, for the practical ap¬
proach to organizing exhibitions of
modern art. In selecting reproductions
for use on posters advertising an
exhibition, for example, the organizer
should choose works that are likely
to be known to the public or which deal
with a theme that is familiar.
Layout of the exhibition can be ar¬
ranged in such a way as to help the
visitor understand and appreciate what
he sees. Careful grouping and posi¬
tioning of pictures can emphasize the
artist's intent and make it easier for the
visitor to discern certain formal as¬
pects of a painter's work that the in¬
quiry shows generally baffle the public.
Diagrams and labels attached to
pictures displayed could well be devot¬
ed to explanation of the work rather
than to a mass of biographical detail
about the artist, and the technical jar¬
gon often employed in exhibition cata¬
logues should be replaced by simple,
clear terms that anyone can under¬
stand.
"It cannot be over-emphasized,"
says Mr. Withrow, "that this study
was initiated In order to establish and
test a method. It therefore cannot be
judged in any other terms. That the
results to date are of limited use, no
one denies. What we look forward to
is the application of the method in
other cities in many countries.
"During the next few years, it is
also hoped that the method will be
refined and improved and that a more
precise scientific interpretation can
be made of the collected results. The
art museum director will have a for¬
midable body of facts upon which he
can base his efforts to reach a large
audience. In the meantime, having
been warned by the preliminary find¬
ings of the Toronto study, he might
start by taking a hard look at the tech¬
niques of presentation and education
now used in his own museum."

THE PUBLIC AND MODERN ART (Continued)
Here, Paul Cezanne's Boy with
the Red Waistcoat (in full colour
on back cover) was voted top
choice. In the paintings which took
the first five places there is "less
deviation from realism" than in the
other five. The subjects are easily
recognizable, the outlines are firm
and perspective is respected.
Ranked very low (eighth place)
Matisse's La Blouse Roumaine
was said to be "not serious enough
for art " and its style was even
compared with a comic strip.
Despite the "unreal use of colour"
Franz Marc's Tower of Blue
Horses was placed second, appa¬
rently because the people polled
felt that the horses were "recogni¬
zable and gave an impression of
strength and vitality".

THE PUBLIC AND MODERN ART (Continued)
The first eight paintings in this series
differ strikingly from the last two in
at least one respect: their subject is
easily recognizable. Carl Hofer's
Water Girl was preferred to the
Renoir, Degas and Picasso because,
according to many of the persons
polled, the picture had a certain
"calm monumentality". The control
painting by Chardin (an 18th century
work), unlike other older works used
in the inquiry, received a fairly low
rating. The painting by Max Beckmann
depicting Three Dancing Girls was
considered vulgar and even "per¬
verse". Nevertheless it was preferred
to the Severini (No. 9) and the Léger
(No. 10) which were given the lowest
ratings because they were considered
too jumbled up, confused and abstract.
The attitudes expressed in Toronto on
these paintings illustrate one of Pro¬
fessor Heinrich's conclusions, that
"what may be commonplace on tele¬
vision in the way of violence and
other distortions of life is not equally
acceptable as subject matter for
painting."

The ten paintings in this set were
grouped in the poll under the heading
"Calligraphy" Interestingly enough,
the far preferred painting was the
hauntingly beautiful Piazza of Zao
Wou-ki. A French painter of Chinese
origin, he was born in Peking in 1920.
Calligraphy and painting have a com¬
mon origin in China, both using the
same instrument (the brush), the same
materials (the special Chinese ink
known in English under the misnomer
"Indian ink"), and have had a parallel
development for several millenia. Al¬
though Zao Wou-ki enjoys doing
calligraphy. Piazza is not actually a
work of calligraphy. When con¬
fronted with Mark Tobey's Awaken¬
ing Night, the persons polled in
Toronto placed it last, well after
the two Picasso's which scored well
here (3rd and 4th places) and the first
of the two Klee's (5th). Klee's
This Star Teaches Humility (9th)
was compared to a child's painting.
The Tobey was felt to be annoyingly
overcrowded and "busy".

The public
puts its cards

by Duncan F. Cameron
T
HE New Consciousness,
or, if you prefer, social conscience,
is the fact of the 1970s. It is no
longer a movement to be observed
in any one society or even hemisphere.
It is a reality of world society, varying
from place to place only in its
expression and degree of sophis¬
tication. And universally the artist is
to be found In the vanguard in alliance
with the intellectuals, the political
reformers, radicalized youth and the
factions of protest.
Historically this is no new rôle for
the artist any more than a reforma¬
tion or revolution is an invention of
our time. But the global dimension
is unprecedented as is the volume
and speed of communication and the
rate of change.
Thus it can be argued that it was
never more important that the artist
be not only heard but also be under¬
stood. Surely the evidence of the
recent past suggests that the artist
has been most often the harbinger of
social change and most rarely a mere
bell-wether.
In Western European and North
American society at least, there is
cause for concern that the contemp¬
orary artist is unlikely to be heard
and most unlikely to be understood
DUNCAN F. CAMERON was one of the
leaders of the group of Canadian art spe¬
cialists which carried out the Toronto
inquiry on The Public and Modern Art. He
is National Director of the Canadian Con¬
ference of the Arts, a national association
of Canada's major organizations in the arts,
and co-ordinator of the International Sub-
Committee on The Public and Modern Art,
of the International Council of Museums.
He has been active in promoting a better
and broader use of art and cultural faci¬
lities for the public, especially museums,
and has written extensively on these sub¬
jects. Readers will recall his article "Mu¬
seums for Moderns", in our Oct. f970 issue.
by anything approaching a mass
audience. Popular culture, with the
momentous force of commercializa¬
tion behind it, experiences wave after
wave of folk art heroes. Some of
the content is strong, visceral, born
of the desire for change. Much is
shoddy, commercial exploitation of
this same desire.
And amidst the clamour of elec¬
tronic mass media and in the great
snowdrifts of mass circulation news¬
papers and periodicals, the voice of
the artist seems to be lost, smother¬
ed. This is true if he speaks through
the art gallery or museum, the con¬
cert hall or legitimate theatre, or the
literary press, be they the institutions
of the establishment or of the under¬
ground.
In either case he speaks to an élite.
His language as well as his state¬
ments remain unknown to the mass
audience including those who may
fervently follow the directions of one
élite or the other.
In the visual arts, and specifically
painting with which we are concern¬
ed here, it is not good enough to say
that the artist is not heard because
contemporary artists who are exhibit¬
ed in art galleries are bourgeois or
that art gallery visitors are members
of a bourgeois élite. It would quickly
be denied by the evidence of audience
studies and a review of gallery cata¬
logues.
Admittedly it appears that there is
a positive correlation between educa¬
tion and art gallery visiting, but
directors of museums exhibiting mod¬
ern and contemporary art report every¬
thing from apathy to open hostility
towards such art from their general
public. As a means to establishing
a rapport and effective communication p
between the visual artists of the | Q
20th century (and especially of the
present day) and the general public,
the art gallery seems to fail.

The paintings of this group,
entitled "Figures in Isolation" are
all expressive of anxiety, menace,
alienation or doom. Most of the
persons shown the set felt that
there was something "morbid"
about all of the paintings. Some
even went so far as to use the
expression "nauseating". Despite
this, a small but significant number
admitted that the artists showed a
good deal of imagination. The
paintings ranked first and second
a Picasso from the Blue Period
(1904) and A Day at the Fair
by the American artist Andrew
Wyeth were both felt to express
human loneliness and were pre¬

was liked for its intense yellows
and blues, whereas Gauguin's
Yellow Christ was often criti¬
cized for its greenish yellow colour
and angular lines and wound up

ANYONE CAN PLAY
What is your opinion of modern art? In what order of preference
would you classify a set of ten paintings without knowing the
name of the artist or the title of the work?
This is the game we invite you to play on the following eight colour
pages on which are reproduced five of the sets (of ten paintings
each) used in the Toronto inquiry into public attitudes to modern art.
1st set (page 19), 2nd set (pages 20-21), 3rd set (pages 22-23),
4th set (pages 24-25), 5th set (page 26). In each set the paintings
on the colour pages are numbered from one to ten for identifica¬
tion purposes only. The numbers do not correspond to the
classification indicated by the Toronto inquiry.
Here is how to play:
Taking each set in turn, rank the ten paintings in your personal
order of preference from one to ten.
For example, let us take the ten paintings on page 19 opposite.
If you like painting N° 6 best and N° 3 second best, write the figure
6 against the word "one" in the first column entitled "First set"
and the figure 3 against the word "Two", also in the first column,
and so on. Repeat this procedure for the four other sets.
When you have finished, turn to pages 27, 28, 29, and 30, where
our colour paintings are reproduced, in black and white, numbered
in the order of preference shown by the Toronto survey and appro¬
priately identified. The numbers in brackets correspond to the identi¬
fication numbers on the colour pages.

THE PUBLIC PUTS ITS CARDS ON THE TABLE (Continued)
18
Is the public art gallery in Western
society an establishment enclave to
such a degree that the mass audience
is either intimidated or stays away in
protest? Art galleries of all sizes and
types have been reporting dramatic
attendance increases since the late
1940s.
Is special .education necessary to
an understanding of modern and con¬
temporary art so that only those who
have learned the language can break
the code? In my experience, children,
who have not been muddled with art
education, respond to education
through art, happily interpret in their
own way even the most contemporary
innovations, and do not suffer the
visual inhibitions which afflict their
educated elders. Regrettably, as they
grow older youngsters seem to lose
this ability and adopt the prejudices
of their elders.
Is the long-held hypothesis true
that there is a generational or fifty-
year gap between creative innovation
and general acceptance? If so, and
we accept the idea that what this
decade's artists have to say will not
be comprehensible until the year 2020,
we might well ask if there will be
anyone around to comprehend.
In considering this dilemma it does
not matter whether we are radical or
reactionary, concerned with political
change to the left or right, preoccupied
with racism, the destruction of the
biosphere, or women's liberation. If
we are concerned with the nature of
man, the quality of life and the altern¬
atives for tomorrow, then the artist,
and not least of these the visual
artist, must be heard. We know from
the past that what he is saying will
be Important to us.
The Toronto inquiry into public
attitudes to modern art is one of the
small beginnings being made to
bridge the gap between the artist and
his public. The frustration is. that the
problem is so vast, so complex and
the need so immediate. In evaluating
research in areas such as this, I am
haunted by a fragment of a contempo¬
rary folk lyric which I heard a school¬
boy singing to himself as he waited
in line for a bus. . . "tomorrow is today
that was."
To describe the beginnings of the
Toronto research project in its
simplest form, it appears that some
directors of museums of modern art
expressed a concern at the 1965
International Council of Museums
(ICOM) Congress in Washington and
New York that they had difficulty
getting through to large segments of
their potential audience.
They felt that an inquiry should be
made into the reasons for public
resistance to exhibitions of modern or
contemporary art, and those who
would not admit that they had met
resistance agreed that there should
at least be an inquiry into the
difficulties which some members of
the public seemed to have in under¬
standing the art of the 20th century
and of their own time.
Mrs. Ayala Zacks of Toronto, a
member of the ICOM Committee for
Museums of Modern Art, volunteered
to organize a committee to make such
enquiries. Subsequently, in 1966, a
committee was organized in Toronto
including a psychologist, Dr. David
S. Abbey, an art historian and former
museum director, Dr. Theodore Allen
Heinrich, an art gallery director,
William Withrow, a professor of
fine arts, Dr. Robert Welsh, a repre¬
sentative of the Canadian National
Committee for ICOM, Donald Crowdis
and the writer.
A variety of possible inquiries
were discussed and some of these
were explored to the point of prelim¬
inary research designs. It was finally
decided that it would be most useful
to develop a methodology for the
definition of public attitudes toward
modern art which could be applied in
any city regardless of the language
spoken, the dominant cultural patterns
or the kinds of art museums available
to the public under investigation.
It was accepted that the Toronto
study would not attempt to answer
any questions at all about the attitudes
of the public in Toronto. The com¬
mittee set out to do nothing more than
develop a methodology and test it to
the point where it could be said to
be capable of producing valid results
provided that certain conditions in the
research were met.
The results of the survey have been
described in Unesco's quarterly. "Mu¬
seum", and the study was reported at
ICOM meetings in Cologne and Munich
in 1968.
The study depended first of all on
the careful selection of a sample of

Nearly half of those ques¬

Winter Street with Hor¬

Canadian painter James
Morrice as their top pref¬
erence. Yet this was not a
judgement influenced by
national pride since only a
few persons said they had
seen it before. It actually
hangs in their own city's
Art Gallery where it is
considered to be a "very
well known "work. Fernand
Léger's Mother and Child
(2nd place) attained high
ranking "only because of
the recognizable subject".
Last place in the set went
to Piet Mondrian's Com¬
position in Blue. This
artist's works were "consis¬
tently and strongly dislik¬
ed", the poll found, even
though a major exhibition
of his paintings had been
held in Toronto shortly
before the inquiry.

This group of paintings pro¬
vided some interesting, not to
say surprising, results, and the
ranking order has been describ¬
ed as "unfathomable". The
Villon work, La Jeune Fille,
might have been expected to
end up at or near the bottom of
the list since the composition
is highly unconventional. Ins¬
tead it gets a fairly good rating
(No. 5) ahead of the Modi¬
gliani (No. 6), Buffet (No. 7)
and Picasso (No. 8). On
the other hand, the bridge on
the woman's head in Brau-
ner's painting (No. 9) was
apparently little appreciated.
It is curious to note that the
four least liked paintings all
have staring eyes which led
one commentator to remark
"there appears to be a dislike
for eyes that engage the view¬
er." One respondent thought
that all paintings were by the
same "modern" artist and
that all were "bad".

On page 7 it was pointed
out that Millet's The Ánge¬
lus was the top favourite of
the Toronto poll. Here it
will be seen that the paint¬
ing occupies second, not
first place behind Renoir's
The Box at the Theatre.
Why this discrepancy ? The
answer is that the poll
comprised several parts: In
one, a set of paintings was
presented and the persons
in the poll were asked to
choose only two paintings
the one they liked best and
the one they liked least of
all. Here the Millet came
out first above all other
paintings in the series.
In another part of the To¬
ronto poll the public was
shown the same set, but
this time the paintings were
examined with much more
detail and the persons in¬
terviewed were asked to
rank all ten paintings (not
just two) in order of pre¬
ference. In this more de¬
tailed study, the Millet drop¬
ped to second place behind
the Renoir.
This curious switch from
1st to 2nd place did not
occur only- in the case of
the Millet painting, but in
nearly a third of the total
of 23 sets used during the
inquiry. The distinction
between the two parts of
the poll is referred to in
the articles of this issue in
terms of "minor" sets and
"major" sets.
It is interesting to note that
the famous painting by
Grant Wood, American
Gothic was ranked low in
the set (No. 8) because,
though it was better known
to the people of Toronto
than any other work, many
persons said it was a
"parody" of the subject.

5TH COLOUR SET
PAGE 26
Choosing the order of pre¬
ference in this set may have
presented certain difficul¬
ties for the persons inter¬
viewed in Toronto, since
the paintings are notably
"abstract" or "non-repre¬
sentational". The majority
preferred the most "natura¬
listic" work, Claude Monet's
Water-lilies (the control
painting) being ranked No.
1. A fairly large number of
persons could see no reason
why this Monet painting
was grouped with the
others. Other comments
regarding the set as a
whole were : "abstract",
"pop art" ; "colours very
pretty", "just colour and
shape", "colours seem
messy or blurred ", "blobs " ;
"all have something in
them but hard to tell what",
"these are not art", "mean¬
ingless", "all terrible".
THE PUBLIC PUTS ITS CARDS
ON THE TABLE
(Continued from page 18)
respondents. A high quality proba¬
bility sample of Metropolitan Toronto
residents was chosen and by this is
meant that each resident of Metropo¬
litan Toronto had an equal chance of
being chosen to be interviewed in the
poll. The one limitation was that
only those over 15 years of age were
eligible.
The interviewing was conducted
face-to-face in the homes of the per¬
sons polled, using the best professional
interviewers available.
The first part of the Interview was
designed to collect an abundance of
information about the individual's
background, family, ethnic origin and
education and included questions
about any particular education in the
visual arts. Information was also
gathered about the education of each
person's parents.
The body of the interview, however,
was concerned with the evaluation by
the interviewee of postcard reproduc¬
tions of 20th century works of art.
By far the most difficult and
demanding part of the entire project
was the selection of a representative
sample of postcard reproductions.
The fact that we had to rely on
available postcards was a limiting
factor in itself, but even at that the
preliminary selection produced some
two thousand possibilities. These had
to be reduced to a workable number.
The selection was made by Mrs. Zacks,
Drs. Welsh and Heinrich and Mr. Wi¬
th row.
As a sideline observer I can only
say that there could have been no
greater concern for care and the
exercise of expert judgement in
reducing the two thousand cards to
the 220 that were finally used. The
220 cards were organized into
23 decks of ten, each deck being
based on some formal quality of the
works of art common to those includ¬
ed. Several of the cards were used
in more than one deck.
Each person interviewed was asked
first of all to make a number of
decisions about the cards in one of
the decks. He, or she, ranked them
according to liking and, as the results
showed, according to hating as well.
Each person was asked to indicate
likes and dislikes and why he thought
the ten pictures presented should have
been put together in a set; to decide
which of the pictures, if any, did not
belong in the set and to explain why;
to discuss which of the pictures he
would like to have for himself and, if
he had it, what he would do with it.
Following the rather lengthy viewing
and manipulation of what we refer to
as the Major Deck, those interviewed
made shorter studies, of three Minor
Decks and for each of these they
also made specific preference ratings
(the most liked and the least liked

The double generation gap between public and artist
painting) and they were also asked
why they thought the paintings had
been grouped together.
To give the results of the Toronto
study, it is perhaps simplest to say
that the data it produced imply certain
hypotheses that demand further study.
The most striking of these comes from
the fact that the 500 persons involved
in the study gave evidence by their
preference ratings that first of all, they
tended to agree with each other on
what they liked and did not like. One
can carry this so far as to hypothesize
that the so called aesthetically illiterate
do have taste even if it is not what
some might call educated taste.
People also showed that they could
explain their reactions, could give
reasons for their likes .and dislikes,
and that they were prepared to take
a definite stand and to argue in its
defence. They possessed a vernacular
language of art.
The second hypothesis comes from
evidence in support of the long esta¬
blished 'belief that there is a lag of
about 50 years between creative inno¬
vation and its general acceptance. The
decks of cards included, as controls,
a small number of examples of 19th
century realism and works of the
Impressionists. These pictures obtained
such high scores by comparison with
the low scores accorded even the
most inoffensive works of the avant-
garde of the early 20th century that
it is difficult to interpret these data
other than in terms of lag.
Dr. Abbey stated the hypothesis as
"familiarity breeds content", and
demonstrated that there were positive
correlations between those pictures
which people said they had seen
before and those which they liked.
Since some of the pictures which a
large number of persons said they
had seen before were ones which had
rarely been published or never exhi¬
bited locally, Dr. Heinrich countered
by saying that the genre may have
been familiar but the picture was not
and so once again we are back to the
lag hypothesis.
T
HESE findings were not, of
course, the primary objective of the
Toronto group. We were concerned
with knowing whether or not the me¬
thodology which we had tested could
produce statistically valid results.
The answer is that the methodology
works, that is, given a high quality
probability sample of adequate size
and using the interview techniques
and interview materials of the Toronto
pilot study, statistically valid measures
of public attitudes can be expected.
The task now is to have the Toronto
pilot study repeated in a number of
other centres so that we can accumu¬
late comparative data. David Bartlett,
Commissioner General of the Cana¬
dian Commission for Unesco, which
provided the financial support for the
study, has pointed out that the most
important result of repeating the
Toronto study elsewhere may be to
provide an opportunity to make cross-
cultural comparisons in public atti¬
tudes.
But to come back to the original
questions put by the directors of
museums of modern art at the interna¬
tional meetings in Mew York and Wash¬
ington, what are they going to do
with the results? How can they apply
them to their day-to-day problems in
the museum of modern art?
It has never been suggested that the
Toronto study and its duplication
elsewhere would provide a formula
which could be used for the pro¬
gramming of an art gallery. Nor
has it been suggested that the sta¬
tistical results of these studies should
be used as the basis for art museum
programming where the objective was
to give the public what it liked, now
that its likes were known.
Rather, it is felt that results of
studies such as the Toronto inquiry
can be helpful to the art museum
director by giving him greater insight
into the problems which members of
his audience face as they strive to
relate their own life experience to
modern art.
In my view these problems appear
to be related, not so much to the non¬
verbal language of art as to the verbal
and semantic gulf between the in-
group jargon of the artist, critic and
curator and the vernacular of the lay¬
man who "doesn't know anything
about art but knows what he likes."
With the successful testing of the
research instrument, its presentation
to ICOM and subsequent publication
in "Museum", the Toronto group could
have decided its job was finished. But
there were disturbing questions that
demanded answers. In 1971 the group,
now working in co-operation with York
University, Toronto, is attempting to
explore at least two of these.
First, is it true that the general public
shares an art vernacular and also
shares what might be called public
taste. In other words is there an élite
aesthetic (and we seem to assume
that there is when we speak of "good
taste") paralleled by a popular aesthe¬
tic which can be clearly expressed and
¡s much more a cultural legacy than the
often assumed attributes of ignorance,
vulgarity, apathy, conservatism, insen-
sitivity or the lack of ability to discri¬
minate?
Second, is the theory of lag in
general acceptance of creative innov
ation valid for the young (15-25 years
of age) as it appears to be for the
population in general. The Toronto
pilot study showed no difference
among age groups in this regard but
the sample size (500) was small, so
that the responses from the sub-
sample of the young hardly justifies a
conclusion.
There are many who argue that the
rate of assimilation of new ideas, new
values, and new modes of expression
is accelerating inversely as to age and
in sympathy if not at the same rate as
social and technological change. Why
should the new forms of the visual arts
be an exception if that is so?
N
O attempt will be made ¡n
the present programme to answer
either of these complex questions. It
is hoped only that hypotheses can
be developed which are sufficiently
precise to permit the design of a
quantitative study of the problems.
For the purposes of the current
research, 24 of the postcard repro¬
ductions used in the pilot study have
been chosen as working tools. These
cards are those which obtained very
high (liked) and very low (disliked)
scores. Tape-recorded interviews with
groups of 8-12 persons will be
conducted and the tapes will subse¬
quently be analyzed using a variety of
criteria. The results of the group inter¬
views, of course, may indicate other
methods of enquiry.
What is important here is that the
study of the problem is continuing.
What is regrettable is that there is so
much time lost between initiation of
these projects and the publication of
results.
In '1965 when the Toronto project
began, for example, it seemed reason¬
able to use 1960 as a cut-off date for
works of art included In the study.
Today the absence of the paintings of
the 1960s may be seen by some as a
serious handicap in using the research
design (1).
Only a concerted effort by Unesco,
ICOM and museums ¿f modern and
contemporary art can accelerate these
research programmes so that they
keep pace with the urgency of our
need.
(1) On this point, Dr Theodore Heinrich,
of the Toronto inquiry working committee,
comments: "We all know what changes
have taken place in the paintings of the
1960s, and for a time we felt that our
results through this omission might be 01
improperly weighted and misleading. We 0 1
are now of the opinion that the inclusion of
radically avant garde material would not
significantly have altered the results."

interviewed could see any common

The Dubuffet work referred to on

as we have seen, caused an uproar of
indignation. The Self-Portrait of
Picasso, here rated last but one
though executed as early as 1906
during the artist's "Rose Period", was
liked far less than his Maternité

is a similar gap between the rankings
of the two works by Gauguin in this

Many persons grimaced when shown
this set of paintings. It is interesting
to note that the works given the top
four ratings all contain human figures
in their composition in contrast with
the other six which do not. This set
again offers striking evidence of the
dislike for non-representational art by
the persons polled in Toronto. Sugai's
painting, rated second from last, is in
reality a highly representational work.
Entitled Oni, it resembles the Japa¬
nese word for a kind of devil. The
painting is a stylization of the Chi¬
nese-Japanese ideogram meaning
"devil". Of course, none of the
persons interviewed knew this nor,
no doubt, did any of the pollsters.

An Italian initiative
SCHOOL
FOR DISARMAMENT
T
| HE impressive mass of
the 15th century Castello Duino stands
on a rocky promontory overlooking the
Adriatic Sea a few miles south of
Trieste in Italy. For three weeks last
summer this ancient monument
housed a gathering of eminent men
and young scholars, from 21 countries,
attending the 3rd International Summer
School on Disarmament and Arms
Control.
It was In the course of a con¬
versation m with Professor Edoardo
Amaldi, during the 1962 summer
school for physicists organized by the
Italian Physics Society, that Professor
Carlo Schaerf first put forward the
idea of an international school on
disarmament and arms control.
As Professor of Physics at Rome
University and author of a number of
important papers on nuclear physics,
Carlo Schaerf was more aware than
most of the full implications of modern
warfare and he was determined to
make his own contribution to the cause
of world peace.
Perhaps the formula used with great
success to expose physicists to the
latest experimental and theoretical
results and update their education in
fields that were not exactly their own
could be used also in the field of
disarmament and arms control.
Disarmament, Dr. Schaerf reasoned,
is a political problem. It can be
achieved only by the concerted poli¬
tical decisions of world leaders acting
under pressure from their respective
national public opinions. However,
disarmament is also a very difficult
technical problem. To understand the
political problems of disarmament a
vast amount of technical information is
necessary.
Suppose such information could be
brought to the attention of men of
influence in countries throughout the
world, would not this at least have a
moderating influence on the councils
of men and perhaps finally snowball
until disarmament and arms control
became a self-evident necessity
instead of a Utopian dream?
Professor Amaldi, himself a member
of the Continuing Committee of the
Pugwash Conference, the informal
organization of scientists for the inter¬
national exchange of ideas on the
impact of science on human affairs,
accepted the idea with enthusiasm.
Then began the long struggle to
convince other people of the value of
the idea and to raise the funds ne¬
cessary for its realization. The Car¬
negie Endowment for International
Peace, in the United States, and the
Italian National Commission for Unesco
were the first to act on the initiative
and grant financial support. The
School opened its doors for the first
time on July 13, 1966, with Professor
Amaldi as Director.
Invitations to the principal lecturers
at the Summer School were issued on
the basis of the teachers' specific
interest and reputation in the sphere
of disarmament and related subjects.
Amongst the personalities who have
lectured at the School are such experts
as Mr. Jules Moch, of France, former
statesman and at one time president of
the United Nations Disarmament
Commission, Mr. V. Emeljanov, presi¬
dent of the Commission for the
Scientific Problems of Disarmament
of the Academy of Sciences of Mos¬
cow, Mr. M. Markovich, Professor of
the Philosophy of Science at the Uni¬
versity of Belgrade, and Mr. Bert
Röling, Secretary-General of the Inter¬
national Peace Research Association.
Participants included young scho¬
lars of international relations, foreign
office officials, sociologists, econo¬
mists, etc.
Courses cover a period of two
weeks with approximately three ses¬
sions every day. They start with formal
lectures and continue with long dis¬
cussions. Round tables, open discus¬
sions and very specialized seminars
are organized on the initiative of the
Director or at participants' request. At
night, people gather in small, informal
groups to continue the arguments of
the day. The 1970 course was follow¬
ed by a week-long symposium.
One of the techniques that has been
adopted by the School, both for
teaching purposes and for research, is
the use of social simulation and game
theory, both highly complex techni¬
ques employing laboratory experimen¬
tation with environments simulating
those of international situations. The
game theory was applied to disarma¬
ment problems in the early 1960s and
the School sought to integrate this
knowledge and induce more and
better research on them.
M
I ^B OW, at the end of several
years' experience, the School has be¬
come an internationally recognized
initiative in the field of peace-orientat¬
ed education and research.
It is a minimum budget operation
with no regular financing, and while
this situation causes the organizers
some headaches it also ensures the
School's great virtue of independence.
No national or political pressure group
can claim to influence in any way the
work of the School. Impartiality and
the freedom to discuss any argument
on its merits are the rule.
The International Summer School on
Disarmament and Arms Control
attempts to achieve the fusion of
knowledge-seeking and social action.
Perhaps, in the words of one distin¬
guished participant, Professor Rapo-
port of the University of Toronto, from
this initiative and others like it "an
applied science of peace will emerge,
just as in another age natural science
was born when philosophers overcame
their reluctance to handle things and 07
moved into the workshops where *" '
craftsmen and artists were already
working." "

T
Educational aid
for the Palestine
refugees
Appeal by Mr René Maheu
Director-General of Unesco
38
HERE are one and a half million
Palestine refugees in the world and they
demand justice.
In whatever manner these demands may
be met on a political level, as part of a peace¬
ful settlement between States, we know that
there can be no true and effective justice for
these refugees, or for all men and women
everywhere, that is not based on the recog¬
nition of their human rights. These rights are
inalienable and on no account can be denied.
The right to education is one of these
rights.
For over 20 years, Unesco has been
associated with the United Nations Relief
and Works Agency for Palestine Refugees
(UNRWA) in order to provide these refugees
with the education to which they have a right.
This action, which began without resources
or adequate preparation, has developed and
become progressively better organized and
equipped until, despite the continued pre-
cariousness of the refugees' position and of
the status of the Agency itself, and despite
a psychological atmosphere continually upset
by violence, it has become the most ambi¬
tious educational undertaking under inter¬
national administration. Even in the territo¬
ries occupied as a result of the events of
June 1967, this action continues in circum¬
stances as near normal as possible.
At present, the 500 schools which UNRWA
has established and which it administers
with technical assistance from Unesco, in
Lebanon, in the Syrian Arab Republic, in Jor¬
dan on both banks of the River Jordan and
in the Gaza Strip, accommodate 192,000
pupils for primary education alone, to whom
must be added the 35,000 pupils who attend
public and private schools in the host count¬
ries, thanks to UNRWA subventions. For
secondary education the figures are, res¬
pectively, 53,000 and 30,000, with 2,500 for
technical education. Finally, over 800 stu¬
dents have been awarded scholarships to
continue their studies at university level.
In terms of numbers, the percentage of
Palestine refugees receiving education is
among the highest in the Arab countries,
while from the point of view of quality a
constant improvement has been noted, thanks
in particular to the systematic effort which
has been made to train teachers almost all
Palestinians who, at the rate of 2,700 a year,

are admitted to five teacher-training schools
and to the Institute of Education established
at Beirut for primary teachers already in
service.
And now the continuation of this humani¬
tarian work, a signal example of international
co-operation, is endangered by the precari-
ousness and insufficiency of the resources
available to UNRWA as the agency respon¬
sible for financing the project.
These resources, as we know, are derived
entirely from voluntary contributions, which
are decided upon each year and are supplied
by a small number of States. To meet the
requirements of an ever-increasing popula¬
tion, the Agency has recorded, for several
years now, a deficit which is continually
increasing and which in 1970 will have reach¬
ed $5,300 000 for a budget of $47,800 000.
This chronic deficit has up till now been
covered by drawing on the Agency's work¬
ing capital fund, but this is now so seriously
depleted that it would be risky to have
recourse to it again.
I N these circumstances as Sec¬
retary-General U Thant pointed out to the
General Assembly of the United Nations
short of a substantial and regular increase of
resources, major reductions in the activities
of the Agency will become necessary. And as
it is impossible for the reductions to affect the
medical and health services, which are prime
necessities, or the food rations, amounting
as they do to 1,500 calories a day, i.e. the
bare minimum for subsistence, the Commis¬
sioner-General, Mr. Michelmore, has regret¬
fully reached the conclusion that it is in the
education appropriations that the inevitable
cuts must be made.
These cuts, which will become effective,
as from the coming school year, beginning
September 1, 1971, may amount to as much
as 20 per cent of the appropriations envisag¬
ed for that year, and will have to be decided
on in April at the latest if additional contrib¬
utions are not forthcoming before that date.
In the face of this possibility, whose serious
effect on the morale of the refugees needs
no emphasis, the Executive Board of Unesco
has authorized me to appeal to the spirit of
international solidarity with a view to collect¬
ing the funds necessary for maintaining and
expanding the education services for Pales¬
tine refugees, and the General Assembly of
the United Nations has urged all govern¬
ments to respond generously to this appeal.
It is this appeal to international solidarity
which I formally launch in virtue of the
authority and backing thus accorded me.
I turn first to governments who have the
power, as it is their duty, to work for the
establishment of justice and peace. I ask
them to consider, by reference to other
expenditures, the immense value deriving in
human terms from the few million dollars
ten million would be enough for the time
being which are necessary to pursue the
work of education on which we have
embarked.
The money I am seeking can be paid either
into UNRWA's general fund or into a deposit
account specially opened by Unesco for the
education of the Palestine refugees. Accord¬
ing to the wishes of the donors it can either
be allocated to the UNRWA-Unesco pro¬
gramme as a whole or earmarked for a par¬
ticular undertaking or a particular sector of
that programme.
But I also appeal to private bodies and
movements in a word to all men and women
of goodwill for justice and peace are the
common possession of all mankind and the
concern of everyone.
And it is in virtue of the rights of all men
and women that I make this appeal. Human
rights are a universal cause and no one could
possibly remain indifferent and inactive in the
face of the derelictions or violations to which
these rights are, alas, subject in so many
ways and so many places throughout the
world. We must act while there is yet time.
At the start of a New Year which leads us
to reflect on the passage of time and the use
we have made of our lives, at a time which
Pope Paul VI asks us once more to devote
to ardent meditation and courageous resol¬
ves in regard to the problems of peace, as
we again discern the hope of a peaceful
settlement of the conflict which has ravaged
the Near East for twenty-five years past, the
international community cannot disregard an
essential aspect of the problem of the Pales¬
tine refugees on whom the whole of that
conflict centres.
In these circumstances may there be wide¬
spread and generous response to Unesco's
appeal on behalf of the noble cause of the
right to education.

Unesco gift coupons
raise $90,000 to aid
East Pakistan schools
Immediately after the cyclone catastro¬
phe in East Pakistan last November a
Unesco Gift Coupon major project was
launched to provide basic equipment and
supplies for schools in the devastated area.
A swift response came from the people
of the Netherlands, who have contributed
$75,000 to buy radio receivers for the
3,500 schools, colleges and technical train¬
ing Institutes which were destroyed or
severely damaged in the disaster.
This contributions brings to over $90,000
the total thus far raised by this Unesco
priority project {GCP 524) which now seeks
to provide an additional $100,000 for other
equipment urgently needed by the schools.
Another gift coupon project (GCP 609)
was set up last year with a target of
$10,000 to provide equipment for blind and
deaf children In eleven special schools In
the area of East Pakistan since devastated
by the cyclone. Now, more than ever, these
schools need help. They urgently require
group hearing appliances, printing machines,
and Braille machines for stenography.
Unesco Gift Coupons are a form of
International money order which beneficia¬
ries may use to buy school equipment and
supplies. Write for information to Gift Cou¬
pon Programme, Unesco House, Place de
Fontenoy, Paris 7; Gift Coupon Office,
Unesco, U.N. Building, New York; or to
the Unesco National Commission In your
country. Contributions should be marked
"East Pakistan SchoolsGCP 524, or 609".
As Pakistan strives to make good the
materlaJ losses of the disaster, Unesco has
pledged its help in the colossal task of
reconstruction, particularly in helping to
make the schools fully operational again.
As initial aid, Unesco's Executive Board
allocated $50,000 from Unesco's budget and
this grant will be used to help secondary
schools replace their lost science teaching
equipment.
The East Pakistan Government's rehabili¬
tation and reconstruction programme for
schools In now under way. It gives a prlo-
s rlty to the rebuilding of 483 primary schools
based on plans prepared by the Unesco-
sponsored Asian Regional Institute for
School Building Research In Colombo,
Ceylon.
Accomodating 400 children, each two-
storey building is designed to withstand the
onslaughts of any future cyclones. The
schools will thus also serve as storm
shelters for the local population and will
be used as community and adult education
centres after school hours.
East Pakistan's short and long-term repair
and reconstruction programme will cover a
further 4,400 schools and colleges in coast¬
al areas which are often affected by cyclo¬
nes and flooding.
Meanwhile, an emergency programme is
in operation to get classes started again.

examination of 29 mummified Pharaohs and
queens at the Cairo Museum has revealed
sacred jewellery, statues and Inscribed sca
rabs hidden on and in the bodies. The dis¬
coveries, of great value to archaeologists,
were made by scientists from the Univer¬
sity of Michigan, U.S.A., during studies

Unesco gift to International
Youth Library
Unesco has given a 25,000 volume col¬
lection of children's books to the Interna¬
tional Youth Library, in Munich, Fed. Rep.
of Germany. Assembled by the Interna¬
tional Bureau of Education in Geneva, the
collection includes numerous children's
books of the Victorian era and rare French
books of the 18th century. An 18 vol¬
ume catalogue of children's books In the
collection of the International Youth
Library has been published by Hall and
Co of Boston, U.S.A.
'Art in Resistance'
Between 1922 and
1945 an entire gen¬
eration of artists
mobilized their skills
and genius in de-
fence of human
freedoms. This
spontaneous resis¬
tance movement by
modern art against
totalitarian tyranny and aggression is strik¬
ingly captured in "Kunst Im Widerstand"
(Art in Resistance), a book presenting 600
pictures of paintings, drawings and sculp¬
ture denouncing oppression, brutality and
the horrors of war. It includes works by
over 300 artists, including many world
famous sculptors and painters Henry
Moore, Jacob Epstein, Ivan Mestrovic, Max
Ernst, Salvador Dali, Joan Miro, Jean Lurcat,
Marc Chagall, Pablo Picasso, Paul Klee,
Henri Matisse and George Grosz, to name
but a few. (See "Bookshelf").
UNESCO AND THE PALES
Ambassador Mansour Khalid, Sudan's
chief representative at the United Nations,
is carrying out a round-the-world fund-rais¬
ing mission, following the appeal launched
by Unesco's Director-General, Mr. René
Maheu for educational aid for Palestine
refugees. Travelling as Mr. Maheu's special
adviser, Ambassador Khalid is seeking
more funds for the joint UNRWA/Unesco
educational programme. After discussions
at UNRWA headquarters in Beirut (Leba¬
non), he is visiting Iran, Iraq, Kuwait, Bah¬
rein, Qatar, Abu Dhabi, Dubai, Saudi Ara¬
bia, Libya, Italy, Spain, Switzerland, the
Fed. Rep. of Germany and U.K. He is
also spending several weeks in other Euro¬
pean countries, the Far East and North
America.

Head of FAO
condemns
racial
discrimination
Mr. Addeke H. Boerma, Director-General
of the Food and Agriculture Organization,
has described racial discrimination as
"loathsome", "criminal" and "an undoubted
threat to peace", in a New Year message
welcoming the U.N. designation of 1971 as
International Year for Action to Combat
Racism and Racial Discrimination (above,
the symbol for this campaign).
"The Preamble to the FAO Constitution
speaks, among other things, about raising
levels of nutrition and standards of living,
bettering the conditions of ruraJ populations
and ensuring humanity's freedom from hun¬
ger," declares Mr. Boerma. "How can
these objectives be achieved when, In addi¬
tion to whatever other inequalities may
exist, there are whole population groups
condemned to a second-class existence
deprived of land on which to grow their
own food or the means to buy enough of
what they need to eat simply because they
are arbitrarily, inhumanly and Insanely
classified as an inferior race?."
$13 million rescue operation

A $13.3 million operation Is being launch¬
ed to save the temples of Philae in Nubia.
Under an agreement between the United
Arab Republic and Unesco, the UAR will
dismantle the temples on the island of Phi¬
lae, where flooding for most of the year is
damaging them, and reconstruct them on
the nearby Island of Agilkia. The UAR will
pay one-third of the cost of the opera¬
tion, and under a voluntary aid agreement
approved by 18 countries, Unesco will pass
on to the UAR contributions from govern¬
ments, foundations and individuals. The
World Food Programme will provide food
for 3,000 workers and their families for
four years, thus saving the equivalent of
$2,443,000 In wages. The removal of the
temples marks the last phase of the

A first batch of about 214,000 books
has arrived for use in primary and lower
secondary schools and a further 200,000
books are to follow. The granting of an
import licence for these books means that
only six titles are excluded from the

on the advice of a three-member interna¬
tional commission of Arab-language scholars
set up to examine the books for use in
UNRWA/Unesco schools.
This followed a ban by Israeli authorities

link among national news agencies through¬
out the region. The centre will be
established by the Indonesian news agency
Antara, in Djakarta. Agreement on the
project was reached at a recent meeting
of the Organization of Asian News Agen¬
cies (OANA) in Tokyo. OANA was set up
ten years ago at a Unesco-sponsored
meeting on the development of national and
regional news exchange, held in Bangkok

of history
The Austrian National Commission for
Unesco, in co-operation with the Vienna
publishing house, "Verlag fur Jugend und

books prepared on an international basis.
The first volume, covering the history of
Austria and of Italy, will be written jointly
by an Austrian and an Italian historian.
Bulgaria and France are exchanging geo¬
graphers for a similar project following
consultations between the French and Bul¬
garian National Commissions for Unesco.
Big drop in infant
death rates
A striking decrease in the death rates of
children under one year has been register¬
ed over the past 15 years in many countries
reports WHO. The most notable improve¬
ment was in Japan where infant death
rates were reduced by 69 per cent, follow¬
ed by Poland (decrease of 64 per cent),

Letters to the Editor
INTERNATIONAL AID
WHEN DISASTER STRIKES
Sir,
While, the world at large is Indifferent
to the inadequacy and muddle of the
aid extended to Pakistan, following last
November's tidal disaster in East Pakis¬
tan, a group of some 300 persons In
the small town of Dole, in the French
Jura, has been greatly disturbed by
these tragic events.
Spontaneously, these people have set
up a committee to call for the launching
of a full-scale international relief pro¬
gramme. Following their example, over
600 persons in Dole have signed a
petition addressed to the French autho¬
rities. Active support has come from
other groups In this part of France.
The problem, of course, is not a local
but an international one and of direct
concern to organizations such as Unes¬
co. Today, new means of commu¬
nication shrink distance and make the
world a smaller and more Interdependent
community. This new situation demands
the organization of massive relief ser¬
vices to meet major emergencies.
Each country should have its own
inter-aid organization that can Immedia¬
tely go into action as part of an inter¬
national relief operation in the event of
a major disaster or catastrophe anywhere
in the world.
Soon, Man will have conquered space,
but will he still deserve the name Man
if, on earth, he has lost the attributes
of human dignity?

NAIVE AND TRUSTING?
Sir,
In a letter published in your July 1970
issue, a reader maintains that world
peace can never become a reality while
States spend large sums on armaments
and, in their school programmes, glori¬
fy national heroes and the art of war.
This is a naive and trusting viewpoint
and one that is blind to the fact that
human institutions are vulnerable and
require constant vigilance and defence
against attack.
Our civilization may be far from ideal,
but it does at least make possible a
certain order and stability and provide
some opportunity for development. We
have a duty to ourselves and our chil¬
dren to consolidate and defend it.
A. Bénésis
Nice, France
MISGUIDED MAXIM
Sir,
I read with great interest Philip
Noel-Baker's article, "The Arms Race,
Escalation of Total Madness", in your
November 1970 issue. It presents a
picture of the vast and increasing sums
spent by most countries on the produc
tion and importation of arms. In so
doing, are they merely paying heed to
that most senseless of maxims, "If you
want peace, prepare for war"?
The disastrous effects of the arms
race can be judged by comparing the
situation of other countries with those
of the Federal Republic of Germany
and Japan, two nations which have
enjoyed a greater economic expansion
than any others since the Second
World War, although both were largely
in ruins In 1945.
The explanation Is simple. Follow¬
ing their defeat these two countries
were forbidden for some time to
maintain armies. Whereas in other
countries young people of working age
were obliged to spend one or two
years in uniform, being fed, clothed
and armed by the rest of the working
population, the Germans and Japanese
were able to devote all their efforts
to constructive tasks. As a result, new
towns have risen from the ruins of war
and the standard of living in these two
countries has steadily increased over
the past 25 years. _ . .

A GOOD TEACHERWORTH TONS
OF GLOSSY EQUIPMENT
Sir,
Dr. Malcolm Adiseshiah's article
"The Crisis In Development" (October
1970 number) makes challenging read¬
ing, and although the problems with
which it deals are familiar, it gives
a masterly survey of them which I read
with growing appreciation and concern.
I wish only to comment on one Item,
not in the article itself, but in the
illustrations which accompany It.
On page 13 you show two photo¬
graphs, evidently intended to point a
contrast, comparing two mathematics
classes, one in the Sudan where chil¬
dren are working in the sand, and one
in Europe where children are studying
sets and relations. I would suggest
that the pictures present a false anti¬
thesis, and the caption includes one or
two misapprehensions.
Apart from the Meccano which Is
visible in the lower photograph, the
child shown is not using particularly
sophisticated equipment, such as could
not be improvised in the Sudan.
Sand is not necessarily a makeshift
material, and the conditions in the
upper photograph may well be ¡deal
for the lesson being learnt in the cli¬
mate prevailing. In any case, few
better materials than sand and stones
could be found for primary children to
learn about matching of sets (which is
what seems to be going on in the lower
picture).
Although it ¡s a commonly used jour¬
nalistic cliché to describe modern school
mathematics as having been confined to
research specialists a generation ago, it
Is just not true, except in the very
limited sense of the symbols used. The
ideas of "new mathematics" are very
simple, and relate the subject to the
child's psychology and his future
studies in a far more meaningful way.
The true antithesis between the
schools shown probably lies in what
cannot be shown in a photograph the
mental attitudes of the two teachers. In
Africa we urgently need teachers who
understand the meaning of mathematics
and whose minds are sensitive to their
pupils' ways of learning and to the
influence of a strange environment. It
does the cause of reform in mathema¬
tical education a disservice to suggest
that expensive equipment is required; a
good teacher is worth the weight in
plutonium of a roomful of glossy equip¬
ment, and every bit as potent. Never¬
theless, let the children play with

POSSIBLE
MISUNDERSTANDING
Sir.
We have noticed that in the Novem¬
ber 1970 Issue of the " Unesco Cou¬
rier ", on page 23, a list of wars and
conflicts In the various regions of the
world, since the Second World War, has
been given. The section devoted to
" Far East and South Asia " contains a
few references to India which are not
factually correct and which could be
considered as tendentious. ' It is true
that there have been some internal
disturbances in India as in most coun¬
tries in the world at some time or other,
but they should neither be magnified
unnecessarily nor construed as " con¬
flicts " and certainly not as conflicts
with a neighbouring country.
For example, to mention India and
Pakistan as the two parties involved in
internal disturbances which are called In
the article "Indian communal riots" or
to characterize the police action i n
Hyderabad as a conflict between the
Indian Government on the one hand and
the Nizam and the Moslems on the other
hand, is not only a false statement but
an interference in the Internal affairs of
a Member State of Unesco.
We wish to believe that the author of
this document has not fully realized all
the unfortunate Implications of such
assertions not only for India but for
many other countries as well.
E. Pouchpa Dass
Indian delegation to Unesco
The conflict referred to took place
In 1948, when Hyderabad still had a
special independent status, and for this
reason was included in the list. The
Editors of the "Unesco Courier" are
fully aware that India is made up of
peoples of many religions, including
many Moslems, and did not imply, in
any way, any political or religious
discrimination on the part of the Indian
Government. The phrase "Indian com¬
munal riots" referred to disturbances
that took place at the time of the
partition of the Indian sub-continent in
1947. We regret if any misunderstand¬
ing has been caused by this reference
or any other statement about any other
countries reproduced from the "SIPRI
Yearbook of World Armaments and Dis¬
armament 1968-1969", published by the
Stockholm International Peace Research
Institute. Editor.

CEZAIMIME, Boy with the Red Waistcoat
The works of Paul Cézanne (1839-1906), one of the great French
painters of the 19th century, were not appreciated by the general
public during most of his lifetime and he was bitterly attacked by the
Collection Buhrle. Zurich (Switzerland) Photo © S.A.W. Schmitt-Verlag. Zurich
" academic " painters and art critics of his day for his innovations in
painting. Today he is accepted and famous the world over. In a
recent inquiry in Toronto (Canada) into public tastes in modern art,
this painting by Cézanne, "Boy with the red waistcoat", ranked top
choice among 1 0 works by 1 9th and 20th century artists (see page 1 0).
