Young
Hittite mother
Cradle of civilizations
dating back to the dawn
of history, Turkey boasts
an illustrious array of
art and monuments from
its ancient past. Among
these vestiges of anti¬
quity are the works of
craftsmen and sculptors
of the Hittites whose
art and culture devel¬
oped about 4,000 years
ago in central Anatolia
and flowered during
more than six centuries.
The Hittite civilization
was contemporary with
those of Assyria and
Phoenicia and also with
that of the Indus valley
at Moenjodaro and Har-
appa (see page 14). Its
people mined copper,
lead and silver and dev¬
eloped advanced tech¬
niques of metalworking.
The skill of an Anatolian
craftsman of 3,500 years
ago is displayed in this
little bronze statuette
(7 cm. high).

PAKISTAN : 5,000 YEARS OF ART AND CULTURE
The present grows out of the past, it has been
said, and the future out of the present The better
we understand the past, the better shall we be able
to mould the future. Pakistan is a nation which can
boast a history going back almost 5,000 years. This
land, perched in the heart of the Asian continent,
has forged its own rich culture and original artistic
expression, blending and assimilating cultural ele¬
ments from both East and West : Greco-Buddhist
art of Gandhara (cover photo of the Buddha), Moghul
miniature painting and landscape art, Islamic archi¬
tecture, and Pakistan's oldest cultural complex, Moen-
jodaro (which must be saved from destruction) have
all enriched the nation's vast cultural heritage.
NEW PRICE OF THE UNESCO COURIER
The continued rise in production and distribution costs
has made it necessary to increase the price of the

had the honour of being Pakistan's interim capital. Located near the ruins of Taxila, it marks the site of the

<![CDATA[
'ULTURAL relics of a coun¬
try are the virtual foundations for
advancement in corporate life. As
achievements acquired after prolonged
struggle with nature and environment,
they manifest the store of creative
intelligence, initiative, perseverance
and integrity that have gone into the
making of a particular national charac¬
ter.
Pakistan has been very fortunate in
this respect. Admittedly, this land has
been an important primeval stage for
the grand and grim drama of man's
first endeavour, his integral rise, his
phenomenal fall and the great resili¬
ence which kept the stream of human
life in action in spite of all obstructions
and intermittent lapses.
Rough and rugged implements un¬
earthed by the eroding current of the
river Soan near Rawalpindi carry the
saga of human toil and labour to the
interglacial ages roughly estimated at
500,000 years before our time. These
are stone "choppers" and "hand-axes"
which are hardly different from river-
rounded pebbles to the layman's eye.
They have revealed a written chapter
to the archaeologist proving that even
in so remote a period man had proved
his intellectual superiority over all
other beings of the jungle. Indomitable
and free, he roved through the thick
forests and hunted other animals for
food and perhaps even for sport.
But we have no other records to
link those interglacial anthropos to
their primate ancestors or to more
civilized progeny. It is in the mounds
of Baluchistan that a chink is opened
to the distant past.
The pieces of pottery excavated in
Baluchistan dislose the existence of a
new era. Here we find a more con¬
tinuous chapter of human activity
dating back to 5000 B.C. though still
in the Stone Age. Here, man is already
established both as herdsman and
farmer. He is found settled in villages
in the little valleys amongst the hills
or occasionally on the outskirts of the
plains. He is seen growing crops,
milking cows and shearing sheep.
Yet much more has to be explored
to reconstruct the true position of
Pakistan in this vital phase of growth
and experiment which culminated in
the great civilization of ancient Meso¬
potamia on one side and the Indus
Valley on the other.
Between the years 2500 and 1500
B.C., there flourished in the Indus plain
one of the most well-developed civi¬
lizations of the ancient Middle East.
SYED A. NAQVI, Internationally known
archaeologist and museologist, was General
Director of Pakistan's Department of Archaeo¬
logy and Museums until last July, when he
joined Unesco's Division for the Development
of the Cultural Heritage. Former head of the
National Museum of Pakistan, in Karachi, he
has excavated at many Pakistani sites Includ¬
ing Moenjodaro, Taxlla and Mansura. Among
his studies on archaeology and ancient art are
'The Muslim Art" (1966), "Gandhara Art"
(1967) and "1,400 Years of Quranic Calligra¬
phy" (1973).
THIS issue of the "Unesco Courier" is devoted in major
part to Pakistan and its rich heritage of art and culture.
Pakistan's cultural history goes back almost 5,000 years
when a great civilization was born in the Indus valley (see
article page 9). Excavations at two of its major cities,
Moenjodaro and Harappa, show that the Indus valley people
reached a remarkable stage of development in town planning
and architecture and an extraordinary degree of artistic
sophistication. Today the site of Moenjodaro is threatened
with destruction by salt corrosion and flooding from the
Indus river.
THE recent flood damage to cultural monuments and
educational facilities in Pakistan amounts to a real disaster
affecting the country's future, declared René Maheu,
Director-General of Unesco, 'at a special press conference
held in Paris last September. World public opinion, he said,
must be alerted to the serious damage from floods in
the Punjab and in the Indus valley. The number of edu¬
cational establishments at all levels either destroyed or
damaged was in the order of 8,000, nearly 800 of them
secondary schools or post-secondary and technical insti¬
tutes. The damage, so far calculated at $13 million,
affected buildings, libraries, equipment and laboratories,
said Mr. Maheu.
DAMAGE had also been suffered by over 30 monuments
of major importance and 150 other monuments or archaeo¬
logical sites. The threat to the famous site of Moenjodaro,
in which Unesco is particularly interested, had been
considerably increased. Mr. Maheu appealed to international
solidarity, urging those who were able to contribute in
cash or in kind to help the rebuilding of the educational
infrastructure and the preservation of the cultural heritage
of Pakistan.
UNESCO and the Government of Pakistan have drawn up
a plan for the preservation and development of the
Moenjodaro site. The first phase will require an estimated
$7.5 million (see article page 16). The Executive Board of
Unesco has authorized the Director-General to launch an
international campaign aimed at raising $5 million towards
the first phase of the preservation and protection of
Moenjodaro.
Moenjodaro and Harappa, the two
important city sites of this civilization
exposed by the archaeologist's spade,
are the outstanding examples of
regimented life.
The wide, straight roads dividing and
sub-dividing the city in square blocks,
well planned houses and underground
system of drainage are still a model
to the present day town-planner. The
inhabitants lived largely by agriculture
but also maintained a trade with lands
as far away as Mesopotamia and
northern Afghanistan.
Of the early stages of this civi¬
lization, nothing was known till the
recent excavations at Kot Diji in Upper
Sind which provided important clues
to this question and also brought to
light remains of an earlier culture of
equally remarkable character, roughly
datable from 3000 to 2500 B.C. It
seems to have influenced different
aspects of life and culture of the Indus
people, though our information is still
very meagre.
By about 1500 B.C., the Indus Valley
Civilization, however, seems to have
disappeared under inexplicable con¬
ditions followed by a wide gap of
about one thousand years. The
excavated remains at Taxila and a
number of monasteries and stupas in
the north-west now bring us down to
the period of recorded history. It was
no longer an isolated culture.
Although separated by the lofty
Himalayas and the Hindu Kush ranges
from the neighbouring cities of central
Asia, Taxila still formed part of one
and the same Buddhistic civilization.
The first city of Taxila or Bhir Mound
as it is known, has preserved little to
show any notable advancement in art
and architecture (see "Unesco Cour¬
ier", October 1972).
The serene pool of this life was,
however, rudely disturbed by the
haughty and youthful Macedonian
intruder in 326 B.C. But this conquest
by Alexander proved a boon in
disguise. The pagan Greeks soon

PAKISTAN (Continued)
found themselves subdued by the
superior religious logic of the Bud¬
dhists and employed all their art and
intelligence in creating a new Buddha
with beautiful Greco-Roman features
and an oriental halo. This mode of
sculpture, which has since come to be
known as Gandhara Art, marked an
escape from the conventional Indian
style.
In 711 A.D., at the time when the
Gothic Kingdom of Spain was captured
and when Kashghar was being con¬
quered by an Arab army, the provinces
of Sind and Multan were annexed to
the dominions of Islam. This first
impact of Islam on the life and culture
of this region is markedly manifest in
the excavated remains of Banbhore,
an Arab port near Karachi, and in the
early Islamic art and architecture of
Hyderabad, Multan, Rohri, Uch, Seh-
wan and Brahmanabad.
The culture which the Muslims
brought from Syria and Persia created,
with the fusion of local elements, a
tradition which was henceforth to
dominate the scene, and gradually
became identical with the art and
culture, thought and aspirations of the
sub-continent.
The political conquest of the land
was, however, left to the Turks who
came in the wake of the invasions of
Sultan Mahmud of Ghazni in the 11th
century A.D. But, with the exception of
very few specimens, most of the sur¬
viving relics of Islam may be attributed

Few sculptures in stone have been found at Moenjodaro. Above, two striking pieces now in
the National Museum of Pakistan, at Karachi. Left, a limestone head from the late period of Moen¬
jodaro (1500 B.C.). The hair is cut short and held in place with a net. Right, the famous

to the Imperial Moghuls or their con¬
temporary local dynasties. The marked
absence of Muslim monuments prior
to the Moghuls is a strange phenom¬
enon and difficult to explain unless
it is supposed that the enhanced build¬
ing activity of the 16th and the later
centuries completely swept away
earlier and outmoded structures.
The existing monuments of this pre-
Moghul Sultanate period (1206-1526)
are grouped save a few tombs at
Thatta in Multan. The finest of them,
the tomb of saint Shah Rukn-i-Alam
(1320-24), has been described as "one
of the most splendid memorials ever
erected in honour of the dead". It is
octagonal in plan and the brickwork
is elaborately carved with a liberal
inter-mixture of azure and white glazed
tiles.
Architecturally, the tomb marks an
epoch in Indo-lslamic forms and antici¬
pates elements which went into the
making of a number of Moghul monu¬
ments during the following centuries.
The features which distinguish the
architecture of this period are a rugged
simplicity and massiveness showing
central Asian and Persian influence,
circular or polygonal forms, and
extensive use of local material.
The Moghul Empire of India was
established by Emperor Babur in 1526.
But it was Akbar the Great who laid
its real foundation. Born in 1542 at
Umarkot in Sind, he left before his
death in 1605 not only a large empire
and a dynamic social and economic
system, but also a distinct style of
art and architecture created by a
harmonious fusion of the parallel
strains of central Asian, Persian and
indigenous traditions. This Indo-lranian
Moghul style was further developed
and refined in the succeeding century
by his grandson Shah Jahan, the
Master Builder. Pakistan possesses
some of the finest creations of this
Golden Era.
Many buildings from the Moghul
period are to be seen in Thatta, the
ancient capital of Sind. Here, in the
old city lies Shah Jahan's Mosque,
a marvel in coloured tile work, while
countless mausoleums of princes,
ministers, governors and holy men
spread over an area of six square
miles on the nearby Makli Hill, the
biggest necropolis of the East.
With the advent of the Moghuls,
Lahore entered the front rank of Asian
cities with the construction of a series
of magnificent structures. Today, many
of the great relics of Moghul architec¬
tural achievements can still be seen
there including the fortified citadel
begun by Akbar and subsequently
enriched with dainty palaces by his
successors. Jahangir's mausoleum,
Noorjahan's tomb, the Shalamar
Gardens and Wazir Khan's Mosque
are some of the other outstanding
monuments which remind us of the
great role played by the Moghuls as
patrons of art and architecture.

5th century
peregrinations
of the
Chinese monk
Fa-Hsien
The Chinese Buddhist monk, Fa-
Hsien, is famous as one of the great
traveller-scholars of antiquity. At
the beginning of the 5th century
he undertook an extraordinary
pilgrimage, traversing thousands
of miles of desert, mountain and
jungle to follow in the footsteps
of the Buddha across the ancient
Indo-Pakistan sub-continent. For
15 years, from 399 to 414 A.D.. Fa-
Hsien travelled in search of all the
places visited by the Buddha, recor¬
ding every scrap of information
about him and describing festivals
held in his honour and the monu¬
ments erected to him. Below, a short
passage from Fa-Hsien's "Record
of Buddhistic Kingdoms" (trans¬
lated by J. Legge, Oxford, 1886) :
...Seven days Journey to the east
brought the travellers to the
kingdom of Takshasila, [Taxila]
which means "the severed head"
in the language of China. Here
when Buddha was a Bodhisattva,
he gave away his head to a man;
and from this circumstance the
kingdom got its name.
Going on further for two days to
the east, they came to the place
where the Bodhisattva threw down
his body to feed a starving tigress.
In these places also large topes
[shrines] have been built, both
adorned with layers of all the
precious substances. The kings,
ministers and peoples of the king¬
doms around vie with one another
in making offerings at them. The
trains of those who come to scatter
flowers and light lamps at them
never cease. The nations of those
quarters call those (and the other
two mentioned before) " the four
great topes "...
Right, detail of a statue of
a bodhisattva or future
Buddha. The folds of the
robe and the style of the
sandal are characteristic of
a form of Greco-Buddhist
art known as " Gandhara "
(4th and 3rd centuries
B.C.) which flourished in
an area around Peshawar
in north-west Pakistan.

MOENJODARO
MODERN METROPOLIS
OF ANTIQUITY
4,500 years ago in the valley of the Indus,
an extraordinary civilization flourished
covering a million square kilometres
by S.M. Ashfaque
and Syed A. Naqvi
_ HE Indus valley in Pakis¬
tan shares with Mesopotamia and the
valley of the Nile the pride of being
the cradle of one of the earliest civi¬
lizations of the world. Moenjodaro,
an important metropolis of that civi¬
lization, exposed by the archaeol¬
ogist's spade about 250 miles north of
Karachi, bears eloquent testimony of
a highly developed society.
The original inhabitants of the South
Asian sub-continent were described
in the Vedas as heathens and bar¬
barians speaking gibberish, living in
fortified cities and raising herds of
cattle. But excavations carried out
at the Indus valley sites of Harappa
and Moenjodaro in 1921 and the
subsequent years established that the
people living in these 4,500-year-old
cities were highly civilized and indus¬
trious, possessing a high standard of
arts and craftsmanship, and a well
developed system of pictographic
writing.
In area, the Indus Valley Civilization
was much more extensive than the
civilizations of Mesopotamia and
Egypt combined, being roughly 1,600
kilometres in length from north to south
and more than 800 kilometres in
breadth from east to west.
The economy of the cities of
Harappa and Moenjodaro was based
S.M. ASHFAQUE Is head of the Epigraphical
branch of Pakistan's Department of Archaeo¬
logy and Museums and was formerly head
of the Ethnological Department of the Natio¬
nal Museum of Pakistan In Karachi. Author
of many papers on archaeology and museo-
logy, he has made a special study of astro¬
labes and other astronomical .instruments
developed during the Moghul period.

upon the fertile valleys of the major
rivers of the Indus basin and the easy
means of transportation which these
rivers afforded. Agriculture was the
main occupation of the people. There
is evidence to show that wheat, barley,
sesame, dates and cotton were the
main agricultural products.
The vast quantity of burnt bricks
and common use of terracotta pottery
indicate that in the past, wood was
available in plenty in the countryside
to provide fuel for the kilns. The
brick-lined drains found in the remains
of the city and pictorial representation
on seals of such animals as tiger,
rhinoceros, elephant and buffalo,
which favour a moist habitat, go to
prove that the Indus valley enjoyed a
copious rainfall in its heyday.
The surplus of agricultural products
and the availability of easy means of
communication made it possible for
the people to barter their goods for
raw materials such as metals, semi¬
precious stones and spices from out¬
side. The trade links of the Indus
valley have been traced to central
Asia, Afghanistan, north-eastern Per¬
sia, south India, and nearer home to
Baluchistan, Rajasthan and Gujarat.
Trade was mostly carried over land
routes, but there is also evidence of
sea links.
Direct evidence of the use of sail¬
boats is confined to some pictures
on a seal, a potsherd graffito and a
terracotta relief found at Moenjodaro.
The picture of the boat on a small
steatite seal shows a craft with
sharply turned up bows and stern, a
central cabin, mast and steering oar.
Such boats appear to be mainly suit¬
able for river sailing, but possibly they
also ventured out along the coastal
waters up to Lothal at the head of the
Gulf of Cambay in the south-east and
to Sutkagendor on the Makran Coast
and the Persian Gulf in the west.
The ruins of Moenjodaro fall into
more or less two distinct parts: a
lower and upper city. The upper city,
close to the Archaeological Museum
of Moenjodaro, is an oblong mound
of which a considerable portion has
been exposed to view. It comprises
the Great Bath, the Great Granary, the
Pillared Hall and a number of other
structures arranged in rows divided
by lanes and by-lanes. The remains
of the ancient civilization are topped
by an imposing Buddhist stupa of the
second century A.D., rising 72 feet
above the surrounding plain to domi¬
nate the scene.
The lower city lying to the east is
an extensive mound of undulating
surface, three large portions of which
have been excavated. The exposed
areas show extensive remains of resi¬
dential quarters arranged in blocks
neatly divided by streets and lanes.
Excavations in the upper city have
revealed that for the most part, it was
rebuilt upon an artificial hill 20 to
40 feet in height, crowned by the
Buddhist stupa. The artificial plat¬
form of the citadel is built of mud-
brick and mud.
Evidence shows that a rising water
table and floods had plagued the city
even as they do today. Especially in
the lower city, closer to the river in ^
the east, there are traces of embank- U
ments and terraced structures built to "
protect the settlement from the river
erosion and inundation.

EVERYDAY LIFE
IN THE CITIES
OF THE INDUS
The vestiges uncovered at Harappa and
Moenjodaro have provided a valuable
insight into the daily lives of the inhabitants
of these two cities 4,500 years ago.
Archaeologists have been able to recons¬
titute a picture of the architecture and
the function of many buildings. Above,
a reconstitution of the Great Bath, the
most remarkable building of Moenjodaro.
The 12-metre-long bath itself was made
completely watertight by the application
of a layer of bitumen between two layers
of brick pointed with lime mortar. Right,
reconstitution of a large house containing
a bathroom, a well and several rooms
giving on to a central courtyard. At
Harappa, archaeologists have also un¬
covered 17 threshing floors (opposite page)
placed at the base of the city's grain
silos. They consist of large, circular,
brick platforms with a central hole perhaps
used for crushing the grain with a pestle.
Above right, a shop or craftsman's work¬
shop at Moenjodaro. The cone-shaped
depressions in the floor were perhaps
dyers' vats or holders for oil jars.

MOENJODARO (Continued)
The houses of Moenjodaro remind
one of the dictum of Francis Bacon,
"Houses are built to live in, not to
look at." It seems that the aim of
the city builders was to make life
comfortable rather than luxurious.
The ante-chambers, parlours, court¬
yards, toilets, staircases and wells
seen in almost every dwelling give an
impression of immaculate planning for
every convenience.
Within the exposed parts of the
upper city, the most famous structure
is that of the Great Bath, 39 feet in
length from north to south, 23 feet in
breadth, sunk 8 feet below a brick
paved floor enclosed in a courtyard.
The rows of rectangular pillars on all
four sides indicate a corridor or pav¬
ilion which shows that the Bath was a
place of some kind of social gathering
or, as interpreted by the archaeo¬
logist, a place of religious bathing on
some particular occasion. The com¬
plex of adjacent rooms and water
closets strengthens the latter infer¬
ence, and it may be concluded that
life in Moenjodaro was dominated by
some kind of priestly guardian or
authority.
From the technical viewpoint, the
masonry structure of the Great Bath
reveals the high degree of skill and
craftsmanship that went into its
conception and construction. The
floor of the bath is reached by brick
steps originally provided with timber
treads set in asphalt. To make the
basin watertight, its floor and sides
were lined with bricks set on edge in
gypsum. Behind the facing bricks
of the sides was a layer of bitumen
held in place by an additional lining
of bricks encased in a packing of mud-
bricks.
On the eastern, side of the bathing
pavilion, a well with a double ring of
brickwork undoubtedly supplied water
to the tank through a sluice connected
to the basin. Near the south-western
comer, there was an outlet by an
underground drain covered by a
corbelled arch through which the
water of the tank was flushed and
led down to the western side of the
city. All those details not only show
the technical ingenuity of the builders
but also reveal their deep preoccu¬
pation with matters of hygiene.
On the western side of the Great
Bath is a peculiar masonry structure
consisting of a number of square plat¬
forms of more or less uniform size
rising five feet in height. The blocks
are divided by a network of narrow
passages meeting at right angles.
On the eastern and southern sides
there are remnants of a superstructure
showing timber holes. Basing him¬
self upon the analogy of a granary
found at Harappa, the noted archae¬
ologist Sir Mortimer Wheeler advan¬
ced the view that this structure also
represents a kind of silo for grain
storage.
A series of solid masonry blocks
formed a podium supporting the timber
floor of the Great Granary. The

narrow passages were the air ducts
to keep the bottom of the 'silo dry
and safe from the effect of ground
moisture. The external walls of the
podium were battered like that of a
fortress, and on the northern side
was an alcove with a brick pavement.
The presence of a granary at Moenjo¬
daro indicates that there was prob¬
ably a barter system for exchange of
commodities, the granary serving the
purpose of a state treasury.
Towards the north-east of the Great
Bath, there is an outline of a long
building the plan of which suggests
that it was the residence of the Chief
Priest, or perhaps a hostel for a
number of priests. This cloister-like
structure includes an open courtyard
enclosed by verandahs on three sides.
The structural alternations suggest
that once five doorways opened into
it from a lane on the eastern side and
one door each on the southern and
western sides. The floor throughout
the rooms is paved with bricks, and
there is evidence of two staircases
leading to an upper storey.
The presence of such buildings
besides the ordinary dwellings
suggests that the ancient people had
certain social institutions which pro¬
vided occasions for group activities.
It is just possible that this large build¬
ing might have been the "punchait"
or court of the city magistrate.

TERRACOTTA
WONDERLAND
In the Indus Valley Civilization terracotta was widely used for a variety of purposes in
architecture (bricks and pipes), for household objects (vases and other containers), for or¬
naments (bracelets) and in sculpture (figurines of humans and animals). (1) A terracotta rhi¬
noceros found at Moenjodaro. The potters also made terracotta toys such as this solid-
wheeled, single-shaft cart (4) drawn by a pair of water buffaloes, identical with those still
used today by Pakistani farmers in the Sind. Many curiously fashioned human figurines have
also been unearthed at Moenjodaro. (2 and 3.)

sector and the probability of peri¬
pheral towers suggest that it was the
residential sector of the élite and the
officials who controlled the secular
and religious administration.
The lower city of Moenjodaro is an
excellent example of scientific town
planning with its basic gridiron system
of main streets demarcating blocks
of residential houses. The principal
thoroughfare is the Central Street
running the whole length of the ruins
from north to south. The main streets
are about 30 feet wide joined by lanes
and side streets varying from 5 to
10 feet in width. The, doors of the
houses usually open on to the lanes
rather than the main streets.
Some of the houses have rectangu¬
lar windows, which might have orig¬
inally been closed by lattices of
alabaster and terracotta. To keep out
the scorching sun the number of
doors and windows was reduced to an
absolute minimum. The common
features are the courtyards, a range
of rooms of modest size, staircases
leading to the upper floors, and quite
frequently, wells to supply water.
The age of the lower city of Moenjo¬
daro can be clearly judged where
stack-like masonry columns are seen
standing on the floors of rooms in
the houses. These are the brick
linings of the wells dug in later times
when the houses below had already
fallen into ruins and been covered
with deposits up to the top of the
wells. Looking down into a well is a
common enough experience, but
seeing a well from the outside, like
a water jug, is intriguing and
irresistibly reminiscent of Alice in
Wonderland.
Walking south down the Central
Street one passes acres of the un-
excavated mound arriving at an area
with a community well. This area had
been the scene of the massacre of
the innocent people of Moenjodaro
when a horde of Aryans attacked the
city and rang the death-knell of this
most remarkable culture.
A short distance further south is the
dyer's shop where we see a number
of shallow pits capped with bricks to
hold the vats of chemicals and dyes.
From there the Central Street leads
to an area where the reduced size of
the residential quarters indicate it to
be the sector of the working class and
the poorer people.
South beyond that point the mound
extends much farther but has been
left intact for future excavations. On
the eastern edge of the lower city
there is considerable evidence of mud-
embankments and terraced structures
obviously raised to protect the metro¬
polis from inundation during monsoon
floods of the river Indus.

found at Moenjodaro including a large
number of burnt clay male and female
figurines, models of birds and min¬
iature representations of animals.
The females figurines are bejewelled
and wear pannier-like head-dresses,
some of which are stained with smoke
perhaps because they served as
incense burners. These figurines are
supposed to represent the Mother
Goddess whose cult was widespread
in the contemporary cultures of the
Middle East.
The male figurines are usually
bearded and nude. They probably
also represent some kind of deity.
The terracotta figurines are modelled
by hand and painted flesh-colour.
Noteworthy among the male figurines
is a steatite bust of a nobleman or
King-Priest wearing a loose robe
engraved with a trefoil pattern in relief.
Such a pattern seems to carry some
divine or authoritative connotation as
it occurs on the Bull of Heaven found
at a Sumerian site, and dates to the
time of Gudea, ruler of Ur about
2200 B.C.
Trefoil patterns also occur on some
Egyptian antiquities of the second
millennium B.C. At Moenjodaro such
patterns can also be seen on a large
steatite head which might have been
an amulet or a protective sign against
the evil eye, worn by some priest or
a monarch. This enigmatic pattern
and the sedate bearing of the male
bust have impressed the archaeologists
enough to assign him the title of King-
Priest.
Sculptural art shows further diversifi¬
cation in the small bronze figurine of
a dancing girl standing with her right
arm akimbo, and her left hand resting
on her left thigh. She is naked, has
a rather ugly face and is wearing
a necklace with three pendants
hanging over her burgeoning breasts.
Two thick bangles are seen on her
right arm above the elbow while a
spiral ornament covers the whole
length of her left arm.
But the best examples of the plastic
art of Moenjodaro uncovered up to
now are no doubt the many magnifi¬
cent seals bearing life-like figures of
animals. These include the Brahmani
bull, the short-horned bull, buffalo,
tiger, rhinoceros, crocodile, and also
mythological creatures like the unicorn,
a human figure with horns and a tail,
and a horned tiger.
Besides these animals and goblins
depicted on seals, there are also
several miniature replicas of monkeys
and squirrels carved with a mastery
of natural detail. In their more light- . _
hearted moments the sculptors also 1 Q
modelled toy bullock carts and ' **
domestic animals for the amusement
of children.

GREAT WORLD CIVILIZATIONS

The Indus Valley Civiliz¬

its economic and cultural
zenith between 2500 and
1500 B.C. On this double
page we indicate some of
the great ' civilizations of
Asia, Africa, Europe and
America which also flour¬
ished at the time. It is
interesting to note that,
thanks to the 7000-year-
old tree-ring samples pro¬
vided by the bristle-cone
pine in California, it has
become apparent that
Carbon-14 dating methods
have been consistently
underestimating the dates
of monuments. It is now
thought, for example, that
the megalithic graves of
Brittany, France antedate
the Pyramids by as much
as 2,000 years and that
Stonehenge was being
built in England at about
the same time as a sculp¬

capturing in bronze the

Sargon of Akkad, whose
portrait in bronze (above)
was discovered at Nine¬
veh, became king of Meso¬
potamia in about 2370
B.C. The rich Tigris-
Euphrates valley had al¬
ready been cultivated for
some 2,000 years by the
Sumerlans (their name
derives from the Sumer
valley, in southern Meso¬
potamia). Skilled crafts¬
men, artists and traders,
they established a soph¬
isticated urban civiliz¬
ation which was emulated
by the Akkadians in north¬
ern Mesopotamia. At the
time of Sargon, Meso¬
potamia had trade links
with the Indus valley
cities and with the Medi¬
terranean countries. Cer¬
tain objects, in particular
seals and jewellery, seem
to indicate influences
from the Indus Valley
Civilization. The Meso¬
potamia n pictographic
script, which first ap¬
peared about 3500 B.C.,
was modified over the
centuries to develop into
the cuneiform script (now
deciphered) used through¬
out the Near East until
about 1000 B.C.

During the period of The
Old Kingdom (about 2800-
2200 B.C.) an aristocratic
culture developed in Egypt
under the Pharaohs of the
lllrd, IVth, Vth and Vlth
dynasties which saw a
flowering of the arts and
sciences (in particular
astronomy and medicine).
The great pyramids of
Giza were built during this
period and sculpture was
marked by a finely ex¬
pressed realism. Above,

ago, Egyptian civilization
was beginning to develop
in Africa along the Nile
valley, in the regions bor¬
dering the Red Sea, in
Sudan and Ethiopia. The
development of papyrus
during the 3rd millenium
B.C. encouraged the
spread of a form of writ¬
ing which developed into
hieroglyphics (deciphered
in 1822). Countless texts
inscribed on stone and
other materials have en¬

Shortly after 2000 B.C.
the Hittites established
their capital city Hattusas
(today Bogazkoy, 150 km.
east of Ankara) in the
mountainous region of
Anatolia in central Turkey.
The royal archives of the
Hittites contained thou¬
sands of clay tablets which
have provided detailed
information concerning
Hittite economic, religious
and legislative structures,
the names of kings and
dates of battles and
treaties. Mesopota¬
mian tablets indicate that
a civilization existed in
Anatolia, dating from
3000 B.C., and refer to
the time when Sargon of
Akkad came to the throne
of Mesopotamia, as well
as to a people speaking
the Hatti language who
were later displaced by
the Hittites. The Hittite
empire collapsed under
pressure from neighbour¬
ing peoples and the last
survivors established small
feudal enclaves in Syria
which were finally ab¬
sorbed into the rising
Assyrian empire. Warriors
and legislators rather
than artists, the Hittites,
nevertheless, produced fine
rock-carvings for their
open-air sanctuaries. Skil¬
led metal-workers, they
also fashioned copper or
bronze animal figurines,
such as the stag above.
The stag was a favourite
subject with Hittite artists
and was no doubt a cult
figure.

This striking Chinese
bronze vase is some 3,500
years old. It dates from
the era of the Shang

B.C.). Many bronze tripod
vases, like the wine vessel
(chia) shown above, or in
other shapes, have been
found on the site of the
Shang capital of An-yang
in the province of Honan.
Most are richly decorated
with extraordinary, intri¬

The perfection of the
Shang bronzes has never
been equalled. At An¬

unearthed thousands of
bones inscribed with an¬

Already at the time of the

The standard text-book
dates of the ancient civili¬
zations of pre-Columbian
America are being pushed
back as a result of the
latest scientific research.
Thus, the Olmecs, usually
said to have flourished in
Mexico from about 800
B.C., are now considered
to be much older as
much as 1500 B.C. and,
according to some autho¬
rities, even older (2000
B.C.). The Olmecs, or
"hule (rubber) people",
established themselves in
the plains bordering the
Gulf of Mexico. Remains
of large mud buildings of
a later period have been
discovered at the great
centres of La Venta, Tres
Zapotes and San Lorenzo-
Tenochtitlan. Among later
Olmec art treasures that
have come down to us
are a number of colossal
heads (carved in imported
stone, some weighing up
to 18 tons) and countless
clay or jade objects and
figurines. The Olmecs
devised a calendar, an
arithmetical system and a
form of hieroglyphic writ¬
ing and their cultural
influence spread through¬
out Mesoamerica (Mexico
and central America).

hero of old buried some
3,600 years ago. It was
discovered at Mycenae, In
the Péloponnèse, Greece,
by the German archaeolo¬

at the end of the 19th
century. The tombs open¬

ed fabulous art treasures
gold funerary masks
and ornaments, clay and
bronze vases and wea¬

objects of Cretan origin
and others made by artists
from mainland Greece.
Mycenaean civilization
was at the height of its
glory in about 1600 B.C.
and its influence extended
to Macedonia, Cyprus,
Syria, Asia Minor and even

MOENJODARO
IN PERIL
Unesco alerts world opinion
to an imminent catastrophe
by Hiroshi Daifuku
16
HIROSHI DAIFUKU is head of Unesco's
Division for the Development of the Cultural
Heritage. The author of many studies on
anthropology, conservation and museography,
he has contributed frequently to the "Unesco
Courier".
'HANGE is ever present
and stability an illusion. Even conti¬
nents, once thought to be immovable,
are known to be great rafts floating
above the liquid core of the earth.
Their movements affect the rise and
fall of mountains, the shape of the
coastline, and only the relatively short
lifespan of man makes them seem
immutable.
Streams form, change their courses
or disappear. Temperature changes,
from those of long duration lasting
millenia to changes which take place
in a few minutes (due to a passing
cloud), the growth of bacteria, lichens,
woody plants and trees, all contribute
towards the change of the environ¬
ment.
Preservation of a site or monument
represents, therefore, a constant strug¬
gle to stay or to slow this process.
Inevitably, if the climate is harsh and
there are great variations in tempera¬
ture and humidity, as in the case of
the site of Moenjodaro in Pakistan,
the task becomes difficult and costly.
It is a semi-arid region with an aver¬
age annual rainfall of about 12 cm.
(under 5 inches). It is a region of low
relief and as a result the Indus river,
through silting, raises its bed above
the plain (during the rainy season the
mean level of the river is about
3 metres above the level of the site).
The river thus forms great loops, suc¬
ceeded by ox-bow lakes, and con¬
stantly shifts its bed. At times it
moves away from Moenjodaro; at
others (as at present) it turns towards
the site to threaten its eventual
destruction.
The construction of a dam (the
Sukkur Barrage) nearby and the
development of irrigation agriculture
have contributed to a rise of the water
table. While irrigation agriculture can
be productive in semi-arid lands,
drainage in a nearly level flood plain
is very difficult, and all too frequently
irrigation results in the rise of a
heavily saline water table.
In the southern reaches of the Indus

tivated land which has been seriously
damaged by water-logging and salinity
is close to 5 million acres. In the area
of Moenjodaro, low-lying land al¬
ready glints with salt and lies aban¬
doned. At the site itself the level of
the water table varies seasonally from
1.5 to 3.9 metres below the surface,
reflecting the rise and fall of the level
of the river, and seasonal irrigations.
Through capillary action water rises
about 2.4 metres (8 feet) above the
aqueous layer and introduces salts
into the bricks composing the monu¬
ment. During the day high tempera¬
tures and low humidity result in rapid
evaporation leaving behind, in the
bricks, a deposit of salts.
These salts (of which sodium,
magnesium and potassium sulphates
and carbonates are among the most
destructive) crystallize. Those found
below the surface exert pressure on
the bricks, causing fragments to flake
off, progressively destroying the sur¬
face and weakening the interior. In
solution the salts help to corrode and
weaken the structure of the bricks.
Thus, the preservation of Moenjo¬
daro is one face of a problem invol¬
ving the development of the entire
Larkana region. Anxiety about the
future of Moenjodaro increased as
the bricks began to show greater wear.
At the request of the Pakistan Gov¬
ernment, Unesco sent a team of
experts to Moenjodaro in January 1964.
The mission was led by Dr. Harold
J. Plenderleith, then Director of the
International Centre for the Study of
the Preservation and the Restoration of
Cultural Property in Rome. He was
accompanied by Mr. C. Th. de Beau¬
fort, a Dutch engineer with con¬
siderable experience in working on
desalinization problems in Iraq and by
Dr. Caesar Voûte, a Dutch geologist.
The team reviewed with Pakistani
specialists all the problems involved
as well as the measures which had
been taken.
Despite severe handicaps, the
Pakistani Department of Archaeology
maintained the site for many years,
using mud-plaster and mud-brick
cappings to help leach the salts away.
When the plaster is moist the salts
within the bricks will migrate to the
mud until the two solutions attain an
equilibrium. The removal of the now
contaminated mud and its replacement
by desalinized mud helped to lessen
the concentration of salts and pre¬
vented the formation of crystals on or
just below the surface.
This did not, however, arrest eros¬
ion as constant new supplies of salt
were introduced from the ground
water and the Department lacked the
means to attack the basic source of
contamination, the rise of the water
table.
The measures to be followed in the
preservation of the site are known
and include: deflection of the river;
lowering the water table; removing or
leaching out the salts found in the
walls of the buildings. All of these
are costly. The decision taken to aid
the Pakistani Government in raising
funds through voluntary contributions

MOENJODARO IN PERIL (Continued)
from the international community will
make possible the following measures:
the construction of a slanting
barrier in the river which will
deflect the current and turn the
river away from the site;
the construction of a ring of tube
wells surrounding the excavated
area to lower the water table;
salt removal and conservation.
The first measure required poses
few problems, the technology is known
and the results predictable. Insofar
as the lowering of the water table is
concerned, there are some unknowns.
The use of tube wells in Pakistan to
lower a saline water table has already
been carried out by the government
on a large-scale agricultural project
in the Punjab.
The discharge of water from the
wells at Moenjodaro can eventually
contribute towards land irrigation.
Nevertheless the process must be
carried out with care. The lowering
of the water level may result in com¬
pression and the effects, particularly
on massive structures, must be care¬
fully observed so as to avoid damage
and ensure the preservation of the
site.
Once the water table is sufficiently
lowered the area found within the ring
of tube wells will be progressively
desalinized. This too may be a long
process as the best methods to be
used have still to be worked out.
The salts found in the monuments
dissolve readily which should make it
easy to leach them out. On the
other hand the fired brick is not of
good quality and the mud mortar
would wash away if too much water
is used.
A common method used to extract
salts from stone or brick is to cover
it with wet paper pulp. The salts
migrate to the pulp which upon drying,
is removed. The experimental use of
fresh mud (uncontaminated with salt)
instead of paper pulp by the Depart¬
ment of Archaeology showed some
promise. But it was abandoned as
it became a veritable labour of Sisy¬
phus since the salts were constantly
replenished from the ground water
below.
Once the tube wells are in oper¬
ation, however, it should be possible
to carry out thorough leaching of the
salts and to follow this by ordinary
maintenance.
The rapid deterioration of the bricks,
noted by the Archaeology Department
Colour pages
and by the experts sent there should
then cease. But work to ensure the
continued survival of the monument
will have to be continued on a long
term basis. Obviously the water table
cannot be permitted to rise again, so
the tube wells will have to be checked
and the machinery periodically renew¬
ed (experience in the Punjab gives an
average life of 20 years).
Airborne salts, while not an important
factor must also be taken into account.
Worn bricks must either be replaced
with sound ones or somehow consoli¬
dated.
I NTERNATIONAL assist¬
ance to solve the problems of Moenjo¬
daro has taken many forms. In 1969,
leading archaeologists under the chair¬
manship of Sir Mortimer Wheeler
examined several proposals to save the
site. In 1972, Raoul Curiel (France) led
a team which reviewed the final con¬
servation project of the Government
of Pakistan. Early this year, Mr. Zulfi-
kar Ali Bhutto, then President of Pa¬
kistan and today its Prime Minister
opened an international symposium
on the preservation of Moenjodaro
organized on the site with Unesco's
assistance.
Practical aspects were not neglected
and in 1972-73, Unesco supplied
equipment for two experimental tube
wells, including pumps which work
inside the tubes and thus remove the
need for above surface buildings. A
laboratory equipped by Unesco is being
built by the Pakistan Government and
Unesco is providing a fellowship for
the chemist in charge to study the
latest techniques used in other coun¬
tries.
Unesco's Executive Board recently
examined the joint Pakistan-Unesco
Moenjodaro preservation project which
in its first phase will cost an estimated
$7.5 million. It authorized Unesco's
Director-General to launch an interna¬
tional fund-raising campaign with a
target figure of $5 million.
After the work of conservation is
completed, the sale of water from the
tube wells for irrigation and the
revenue from tourism will pay the
expenses of maintaining the equipment
and site. But while the measures
foreseen will stop the primary cause
of erosion, constant vigilance and care
will be needed if the site is to survive
as a vivid reminder that here was the
birthplace of an ancient civilization.

POETRY & REALISM
IN MOGHUL
MINIATURE PAINTING
by Mumtaz Hasan
¿LS í * ****£** I
An 18th century miniature
painting of the great
Moghul Emperor Akbar
(1542-1602),
now in the Louvre, Paris.
A generous patron of the arts
he was the founder of
the Moghul school of art.
OGHUL minia¬
ture painting represents
the finest in the miniature
arts of the Indo-Pakistan
sub-continent. This es¬
sentially Muslim school of
painting flourished under
the inspiring patronage of
the Moghul Emperors for
well over two hundred
years from the second
quarter of the sixteenth
to the close of the eight¬
eenth century.
At its zenith, its fame
reached such distant
lands as those of Europe
where it aroused the ad¬
miration of a master of
the calibre of Rembrandt.
At home, it exercised a
profound influence on a
large number of schools
of miniature painting,
such as the Rajput, «an¬
gra, and Deccan Schools.
The art of miniature
painting began in the sub-continent during the later phase
of the reign of the Emperor Humayun, who on his return
from Iran brought with him two master miniature painters
of the court of King Tahmasp I Sayyid Ali and Abdus
Samad. A host of local artists worked under the supervision
of these masters from Iran. Moghul art was largely a con¬
tinuation and an offshoot of the arabesque, two-dimension¬
al decorative Iranian School which, in its earlier stages, was
influenced by Chinese painting.
The earlier formative stages of Moghul painting, however,
were soon followed by a phase of assertive identity when
it showed signs of contact with European art to which it
was most probably introduced by the early Christian
missionaries.
In course of time, the school evolved a vision of reality
all its own. It was undoubtedly this vision, pulsating with
life and vigour, that imparted to Moghul art an indivi¬
duality which is easy to recognize and easier to appreciate.
In this sense, the Emperor Akbar is the real founder of
the Moghul school of art. During most of the fifty years
MUMTAZ HASAN is President of the Museums Association of Pakis¬
tan. He has been Pakistan's permanent Secretary for Finance and
was for many years President of the National Bank of Pakistan.
Doctor Honoris Causa of the Goethe Institute (Fed. Rep. of Germany)
he has always been interested in the promotion of cultural activities.
His publications include a study of Iqbal, the great philosopher and
poet who has been called "the spiritual father of Pakistan", and
"In Search of Debul", an historical account of the earliest Muslim
city in the Indo-Pakistan sub-continent. He edited the English edition
of "The Adventures of Hir and Ran¡ha" from the Punjabi poem by
Waris Shah.
of his reign a large number of painters were busy in his
atelier illustrating manuscripts, mostly epics, such as Hamza
Nameh, Shah Nameh, Tarikh-i-Khandan-i-Taimuriyan and
Akbar Nameh and painting portraits of the royal personage
and his nobles.
In the manuscripts and album paintings, the Iranian deli¬
cacy of detail and linear grace combined with the charac¬
teristic Indian palette of varied greens, glowing reds
and oranges.
Among the local artists at the royal court were masters
such as Mansur, Daswanth and Basawan, who illustrated
the Hamza Nameh, but most of their finest work was
produced in the shape of isolated miniature paintings for
albums, portrait drawings, paintings of animals and flowers,
hunting scenes and paintings depicting incidents of court
life. This was executed in a style which basically was
Safavid, but indigenous in most of its details.
During the reign of the Emperor Jahangir, the natura¬
listic tendency was predominant. It is evident in the careful
studies of animals, birds, flowers and trees executed
during this period, which rank among the most exquisite
examples of Moghul art.
It was during this period that Moghul art reached the
zenith of its glory. Whatever Persian influence had lingered
during the reign of Akbar, disappeared from the paintings
of Jahangir's time. Besides scenes from nature, of which
the Emperor was a keen lover, depiction of court life largely
constituted the thematic component of the paintings o)
this period, and the practice of elaborately decorating the
mounts of paintings came into vogue.
The style of Jahangir's period continued and was per¬
fected during the reign of the Emperor Shah Jahan, the
builder of the Taj Mahal. Technical perfection, uninhibited
yet judicious use of colours, and masterly brushwork are
the outstanding features of the paintings of this time. The-
matically, the court and its splendour along with portraits
in groups, of courtiers or dervishes, often dominate the
miniatures of Shah Jahan's time.
A new technique of portraiture, which originated during
Jahangir's reign and amounted to lightly touching a sketch
with colour or gold, came into its own during this period.
It attained nobility, representative character and refinement,
although it lacked, to some extent, the vitality of Akbar's
time and the keen interest in life shown by Jahangir's
painters.
It is a tribute to the vitality of Moghul art that even after
passing its zenith after the reign of the Emperor Shah Jahan,
which ended in 1658, it retained most of its greatness, so
far as technique was concerned, till the close of the reign
of Muhammad Shah in 1748.
During his reign and that of his predecessor, Farrukhsiyar
(1713-1718), painting again became a favourite art at court,
but the decline of the Moghul Empire saw artists turning
more and more to Nawabs and Rajahs, the local potentates
who had established independent or semi-independent
states of their own, in search of new patrons and security.
At their courts, the imitation of the Imperial Moghul style
flourished for nearly another century.

MYSTERY
SCRIPT
OF THE
INDUS VALLEY
One of the world's oldest writing systems
still resists the efforts of scholars

HE Indus Valley lies across
ancient migration routes from central
and western Asia to India.
The Indus Civilization introduced
the first urban life in this valley at a
time when similar civilizations had
developed on the banks of the Nile
and the Tigris-Euphrates valleys. Such
urban growth was possible because of
a new technical advance in the
Bronze Age when the river valleys
could be made to yield sufficient crops
to sustain the growing human popula¬
tion.
This also led to overseas trade and
contacts with distant lands. As a
result, a system of writing evolved
in each region. Each system had a
character of its own, but the earliest
forms shared a common pattern derived
from the pictures of the objects
common in their particular civilizations.
These picture writings, known as
pictographs, are not read in the way
we read our alphabets. In order to
specify the meaning it is necessary to
associate one meaning with each
pictograph. Such association simpli¬
fies the process of understanding. To
make it simpler the pictures are re¬
duced in outline and only brief
sketches express human ideas. In this
way, man developed ideograms to
make his symbols understood by
others. This process of simplification
differed from region to region.
As each region had its own lan¬
guage, the regional ideograms ex¬
pressed the words of those languages.
And thus we see simplified pictures
related to human sounds. Man went
a step further in the evolution of writing
when he could express not only the
visible objects in writing but also all
kinds of sounds. And in time, the
pictures actually lost their real visible
shape and meaning. They were
reduced to symbols and came to be
associated permanently with sounds.
Each of the three great civilizations
had their own way of evolution.
Egypt developed a system known as
hieroglyph while Mesopotamia pro¬
gressed towards wedge-shaped writ¬
ing called cuneiform. The Indus writ¬
ing is still a mystery and scholars are
busy solving it.
The scripts of the forgotten civiliza¬
tions need to be deciphered. The way
to decipherment is either by learning
the value of the symbols which would

Most examples of the mysterious Indus valley script consist of short inscriptions on seals usually accom¬
panied by representations of real or fabulous anim als (see back cover) or, more rarely, human figures
(opposite page). Inscriptions on copper or pottery tablets have also been found such as the two above,
unearthed at Moenjodaro.
give us words, or by recognizing the
sounds of a known language, and
finally relating words with sounds.
Such a method was possible in the
case of hieroglyph and cuneiform
writing as the discovery of the same
inscription in two or three scripts or
languages (bilingual or trilingual),
enabled the decipherers to get to the
sound and finally they were able to
unlock these ancient scripts.
The Rosetta Stone with its trilingual
inscription helped to reveal the secrets
of the Egyptian hieroglyphs. But no
"Rosetta Stone" has so far been found
in the Indus Civilization.
Attempts at decipherment however,
have not been given up. There must
be some other method to decipher an
unknown script. After all, symbols are
human creations in a given context.
If we know thoroughly the cultural
context and if we can recognize the
symbols in that context and their value,
we are on a path that may lead to
decipherment.
It is also possible to approach the
subject from another angle. Among
the many languages spoken today in
the world, some are inter-related and
form a group belonging to one family.
The languages of one family behave
in a particular way. If the Indus writ¬
ing expresses any language belonging
to any of the linguistic groups surviv¬
ing today, its particular sounds could
be caught, their behaviour pattern det¬
ermined, and this behaviour of sounds
could then be planted on the behaviour
of symbols in order to determine whe¬
ther the design of the symbols agrees
with one linguistic family or another.
This is a complicated method no
doubt but the computer, it is hoped,
can now help us in finding a solution.
But machines work only to the extent
that the human brain instructs them
to, so first we need to examine the
problem methodically.
In the Indus Civilization no long
inscriptions have so far been found,
but short inscriptions engraved mainly
on seals, sealings and bronze tablets
have been unearthed. Some are
found scratched on pots. The seals
carry the negative of the inscriptions
and it is their impression which gives
the positive reading.
The seals usually carry the figure of __
an animal bull, elephant, tiger, uni- /U
corn, etc. and short inscriptions of
one to three lines usually occupy the
top space.

MYSTERY SCRIPT (Continued)
Did the Indus people
speak a Dravidian language?
30
As all the animals face right, it had
been concluded that the direction of
writing is from right to left. This
conclusion is now proved by an over¬
writing on a pot in which a left symbol
cuts across the right one.
Some of the symbols of the Indus
writing are easy to decipher. These
are short or long vertical strokes num¬
bering from one to ten or twelve.
The strokes are presumed to represent
numbers. But are they just numbers?
As they occur in various combinations
before and after the symbols, it is
inferred that they are used to express
syllabic sounds.
HE nature of the short
inscriptions on the Indus valley seals
has led some scholars to believe that
they are only the names and titles of
the persons who owned the seals and
used them to authenticate documents
or as a trade mark on bales of cotton
or other goods bartered with the lands
far and near. This interpretation is
based on a similarity with the writing
of titles in Ancient Egypt.
Other comparisons have revealed
similarities in the shapes of symbols
and these have been noted on tablets
in places as far away as Easter Island
in the Pacific and on tablets bearing
Hittite hieroglyphic writing.
But similarities apart, there Is no
proof that these symbols have the
same sound value in different civiliza¬
tions. It is therefore essential that the
system of the Indus writing should first
be discovered and then the nature of
this system tested as to its suitability
with one linguistic group or another.
Another possible method is to de¬
termine the particular linguistic group
to which the language of the Indus
people could possibly be related.
Three such claimant groups Indo-
Aryan, Munda or Proto-Austro-Asian,
and Dravidian have been thoroughly
examined in this connexion. On
purely historical grounds, the Indo-
Aryan group has been left out as the
Aryans appeared on the scene in the
post Indus Valley period.
Yet some scholars have tried to link
it with the Indus writing while others
have sought connexions between the
Indus script and the much later Indian
writing called Brahmi. These attempts,
however, have not proved successful,
and neither have efforts to link the
Indus script with Munda, which has
been found to be unsuitable on cultural
and linguistic grounds.
A team of Soviet scientists has ana¬
lysed the Indus symbols in a scientific
manner and has tried to read them on
the basis of the Dravidian language (1).
The Dravidian with Brahui as one of
its branches is still spoken in central
Baluchistan. It is known to have been
pre-Aryan in this part of the world and
thus offers a possibility. But in the
main area of South India where Dra¬
vidian is now spoken, the Indus Civi¬
lization is not known to have penetra¬
ted.
However, the real difficulty is to
establish the particular form of the
Dravidian language which may have
been spoken by the Indus people.
All attempts are now concentrated on
reconstructing that language and with
its help, deciphering the Indus symbols.
Meanwhile new discoveries in the
Gomal valley of Pakistan, in south
Afghanistan and in Soviet Turkmenistan
have shown that during the Bronze
Age there was more contact between
the peoples of these regions than had
been supposed. Not only this fact
but other considerations suggest that
the Altai group of languages may pos¬
sibly help to solve the mystery of the
language used by the people of the
Indus valley nearly five thousand years
ago.
I N an effort to clarify the
mechanics of the Indus writing, several
attempts have been made to collect
the inscriptions, arrange them in some
order, determine the exact number of
known symbols, specify the beginning
and end signs, and follow the definite
form of the symbols as they undergo
changes.
The latest work of this kind, com¬
piled by Asko Parpóla and his coll¬
eagues from Finland at the Scandina¬
vian Institute of Asian Studies in
Copenhagen, brings together in one
place the entire material suitably
arranged with the help of a computer.
This is ready-made material which
could be used profitably by other
would-be decipherers.
In this work, the total number of
signs listed is 396. Some of the sym¬
bols are easily recognizable. They
include the homo-sign, animal sign
and bird, fish and insect signs.
Others are taken from local flora
such as the mushroom, the p/pa/-leaf
and flower and probably the tree itself.
Some represent objects such as the
bow-and-arrow, shrimping net, or
wheeled cart, but most of them are
simple lines or geometrical forms.
H
(1) Attempts at decipherment using a
computer have been made since 1964 by
Soviet teams in Moscow led by Yu. V.
Knorozov.
IOWEVER, the signs have
two main features: some appear in
various combinations and others are
modified by the addition of strokes.
The significance of these two features
is not yet established. It is generally
assumed that they qualify the original
sign in the same fashion as the
grammatical suffixes used with words
in the Altai group of languages or in
Dravidian.
In modern Turkish, which belongs to
the Altai group, we have the base
word "coçuk" meaning child. Changes
are made by adding suffixes as in this
example:
"Coçuk" (child) + "lar" = "çocuk-
lar" (children) + "iniz" = "cocuk-
lariniz" (our children) + "dan" = "ço-
cuklarinizdan" (from our children).
Languages which behave in the
above fashion belong to the aggluti¬
native language group. If Indus writing
belongs to this group, it should be
possible to analyse it and classify the
symbols under the main signs and
suffixes. These suffixes should indicate
the grammatical behaviour of words.
Once the grammatical behaviour is
determined, it is possible to place the
writing definitely in one linguistic group
or another. But so far, this last stage
of classification has not been done in
the case of the Indus writing.
The absence of long inscriptions in
the Indus Civilization writing should
not be a bar to its decipherment. It
is possible that some scholar, in a
remote corner of South America, Afri¬
ca or China may one day devote him¬
self to this task and give us the ana¬
lysis that can unravel the mystery of
the Indus script.

The computer takes a crack
at code-cracking
H	|ow do experts set about
deciphering an ancient, pictographic script?
The famous Rosetta Stone, inscribed in hiero¬
glyphic, demotic and Greek characters, provided
a key to the secrets of the hieroglyphs of ancient
Egypt. But in the case of the Indus script no such
key has been found and a much longer, more
painstaking study is required involving complex
semantic, phonetic, grammatical, historical,
statistical and other factors combined with infor¬
med guesswork.
For almost a decade, four Finnish experts,
Asko Parpóla, Seppo Koskenniemi, Simo Parpóla
and Pentti Aalto, of the Scandinavian Institute
of Asian Studies, Copenhagen, have been attempt¬
ing, with the aid of a computer, to decipher the
300 or so signs of the Indus script on the basis
of the 2,000 inscriptions on seals found in the
Indus valley. Their work is based on the as¬
sumption that the Indus script is related to
Dravidian. This assumption and the interpre¬
tations arrived at by the Finnish team have
been contested by other authorities.
We present below extracts from one of the
preliminary studies "Further Progress in the
Indus Script Decipherment", Special Publication
No. 3, published in 1970 by the Scandinavian
Institute of Asian Studies. They give the layman
an insight into the reasoning used by experts
in an attempt to crack the coded messages
that have come down to us over some 4,000 years.

must have been called after their "colours by the ancient
Dravidians, for the original Dravidian names coincide with
the colours associated with the planets in the Sanskrit and
Tamil sources: Mars = red; Mercury = green; Jupiter =
golden, yellow; Venus = white; Saturn = black.
The above order of the planets can be deduced from
the weekdays (Tuesday - Saturday) with which they are
associated in later Indian tradition.

Jupiter's Sanskrit name is Brhaspati, which is also one
name of Brahma, the Creator of the Hindu trinity, called
also Brahmanaspati, Prajapati or Vacaspati. Since, on the
seal above, the god's name is one of the two planet signs
that had not yet been deciphered, it seemed worth .while
to examine whether the scene would fit to what is known
about Jupiter and Brahma.
The man kneeling in front of the horned personage in the
midst of the holy pipal or fig-tree (Ficus religiosa) is
obviously the god's high priest (note his "crown") and

corresponds to the sign
*& = an "man, servant"
at the end of the inscription [read from right to left]. Most
probably the sign
UJ (here "ritually pure")
on the other side of the tree also refers to him. The person
in the fig-tree must be the god himself, whose name in
the genitive case precedes the sign
i .if*.
The sacred tree of the planet Jupiter is according to the
Sanskrit sources, the asvattha or pipal tree; in Dravidian
this tree is aracu and aracan means besides "king" also the
planet Jupiter. The same tree, usually called udumbara,
is the sacred tree of the god Brahma/Prajapati, being a
symbol of life and fertility and the place of the soul after
the death.
In the Brahmana texts we have numerous variations of
the story of how Prajapati created these worlds. They used
to begin by telling that Prajapati hatched himself and then
created these three worlds, which he then hatched, etc.
In the Vedic agnicayana ritual where Prajapati is the central
deity, he is represented by a golden man; the acts re'ating
to this figure are accompanied by verses of "he who was
born of golden womb". In the Mahabharata it is told that
Brahma was hatched out of the golden egg that lay floating
on primeval waters.
Jupiter is the golden planet, and pon "gold" is also the
Tamil name of the planet Jupiter. If we allow for a slight
difference of the final nasal, we have a homophone which
would give a good explanation to the scratch inside the fish
in the pictogram
*
32
pun "wound, scratch"
Brhaspati and Brahmanaspati must mean approximately
the same as Prajapati and be translations into Sanskrit of
a Dravidian epithet meaning "the lord of creation and life".
But Brahma also has a name Vacaspati "the lord of speech",
and in fact he is the husband of Vac, "Speech, Voice", who
is identical with Sarasvati the goddess of wisdom (= Tamil
kalai-makal) and the life-giving holy river of north-west India.
It is not a mere coincidence that the best Dravidian word
for (the principle of) "life", uy, uyir, ucir, means besides
^life; salvation, reanimation" (= Sanskrit Brahman) and
"propagation, emitting semen" (= Sanskrit praja) also
"speech" (= Sanskrit vac), the basic meaning being
"breath" (= Sanskrit prana), an important concept intimately
connected with Brahma/Prajapati.
Brahma and Sarasvati had seven children, the "seven
sages" who are the stars of the constellation of Great Bear.
The planet Jupiter also has seven children, six sons and one
daughter by Candramasi, Seven persons are seen depicted
at the bottom of the seal.
Brahma is represented as riding on a wild goose (hamsa),
which symbolizes the soul and the sun, and the Mahabharata
tells in several places how Prajapati assumed the shape of
a golden goose, which is the first incarnation of Visnu, the
supreme soul. Also in Tamil literature Brahma is said
to have a swan in his banner. But in the Vedic ritual the
animal specially connected with Prajapati is the horse, the
foremost symbol of sun and fertility of the Aryans. The
vahana or "vehicle" of the planet Jupiter is a yellow horse
or goose. (Is the unclear object in the seal a goose?)
The planet Jupiter holds in his hand a lotus, and is some¬
times represented as sitting on a lotus. The lotus is, like
the fig tree, an important symbol of fertility (of kantal, kanta,
katta "bulbous root of lotus" and kanta "male, husband")
and also the seat of Brahma, who according to one legend
sprang from a lotus that came out of Visnu's navel. That
Jupiter was a god of fertility like Prajapati is evident also
from the great importance that was attached to the
favourable position of Jupiter in the case of marriages in
post-Vedic times.
The significance of the human-headed ram on the seal is
not yet clear.

HE Indus seals usually
have in addition to the pictographic
text a design of an animal. The
ancient Tamil kings, gods, tribes, etc.,
had totemic emblems depicted in their
flags, seals, houses, etc., consisting
mostly of different kinds of animals.
Ancient Tamil literature has preserved
a most interesting account of the use
of these seals. It is said that mer-

chandise was sealed with emblems of
respective kings. . . Goods unloaded
from ship to shore and vice versa, and
the articles gathered on the shore,
were sealed before letting them go
out of the customs yard. The act of
sealing the bags is explained in the
words pulí porittu puram pokki, which
means "the tiger (sign) was stamped
and was passed out". The extant
Indus sealings were stamped on clay
tablets attached to bales of goods.
The word venkai means in Dravidian
both "kino tree" and "tiger", both
totemic emblems of clans. The colour
of the tiger's stripes bears a strong
resemblance to the colour of the
flowers of the kino tree. "It was on
account of this resemblance that the
young maidens of the Kuravar phratry
shouted out 'Tiger, Tiger' when they
were plucking the flowers of the venkai
tree." This looks almost like a des¬
cription of a fairly common scene
depicted on the Indus seals, where a
person is squatting in a tree and
extending one of his arms with some
object (flower?) in the hand towards
a tiger beneath him.

with some special priestly act depicted
on the seal, opposite, showing a female
figure with a bull's head and tail and
legs, reaching towards a horned tiger.
On this seal the text, unfortunately
broken, contains the sign Ps
with a tail added:^^C
This tail is otherwise known from
the sign^-^Ç, a variant of vfi/, both
of which occur in contexts indicating
a meaning "priestess".
If £^ is tampi/nampi (used also
as god's epithet like ]& )
and V%) is its feminine form, the
word is tankai/nankai "younger sis¬
ter; woman of distinction". The tail
added to the pictograph of course
associates it with the priestess's dress,
but also probably has a phonetic value.
The word for "tail" in Dravidian is val,
which has an exact homophone val
meaning "(ceremonially) pure, white,
holy", used with special reference to
virgins. In Egyptian the word w' b

THE GLORY
THAT WAS
SHALAMAR
Restoring the splendours of Lahore's
17th century garden of delights
by
Muhammad
Ishtiaq Khan
34
MUHAMMAD ISHTIAQ KHAN is General
Director of Archaeology and Museums in
Pakistan. He has excavated at the 8th-cen-
tury Arab city of Banbhore near Karachi and
other important sites. His mam field of study
is Islamic archaeology.
"A
at^ garden", observed Em¬
peror Babur, founder of the Moghul dy¬
nasty, "is the purest of human pleas¬
ures". His successors Humayun,
Akbar, Jahangir and Shah Jahan true
to their tradition stinted neither time
nor money in satisfying their craving
for beauty.
The Shalamar Gardens, laid out near
Lahore at the command of Emperor
Shah Jahan, express the pure aesthe¬
tic taste of Moghul landscape archi¬
tecture.
They thus embody the Moghul con¬
ception of a perfect garden: a deli-
ciously cool and pleasant atmosphere,
the murmuring waters of canals, calm
mirrored surfaces of ornamental tanks,
splashing fountains, rippling and sing¬
ing cascades and the sombre forms
of swaying cypresses.
The name "Shalamar" has been vari¬
ously interpreted, most popularly of
all as "abode of bliss" or "light of the
moon". The most plausible interpre¬
tation, however, seems to be that the
word is a corruption of "Shalimar",
from "Shali" (rice paddy) and "Mar"
(black loamy soil) in the Kashmiri lan¬
guage.

"Shalimar" therefore meant "black
loamy soil for rice-growing". But
exactly when the gardens at Lahore
came to be given the name Shalamar
is not known.
In 1639, Ali Mardan Khan, a Persian
noble and Governor of Lahore, infor¬
med Emperor Shah Jahan that he could
call on the services of expert canal
engineers, and sought permission to
build a canal from the river Ravi to
Lahore.
His request was granted, funds were
placed at his disposal and within two
years the "Shah Nahar" or Royal Canal
was completed with the help of Mulla
Alaul Mulk Tuni, an expert in hydro¬
logy.
In 1641 Khalilullah Khan, a noble of
Shah Jahan's court, was directed by
the emperor to select a suitable site
on the newly dug canal for laying out
a garden. The site he chose was on
the old bed of the river Ravi.
On October 31, 1642, exactly one
year, five months and four days after
the foundations had been laid, the
Emperor Shah Jahan paid his first
state visit to the completed gardens.
A typical Moghul garden, the Sha¬
lamar at Lahore is surrounded by a
high battlemented wall, enclosing
canals with running waters, large tanks
with fountains, rippling cascades, and
"Khayabans" or shady promenades. It
:*.-
was laid out in three descending ter¬
races from south to north covering
some forty acres. Originally, the ter¬
races were entered through an elegant
gateway pierced in the western wall of
the lower terrace. In this manner the
cascades faced the visitor and new
delights were revealed as each ter¬
race was surmounted.
While the upper terrace is nearly
15 ft. higher than the middle terrace,
the difference in level between the
middle and the lower terrace is only
5 ft. Within the upper and lower terra¬
ces, each measuring 290 yds. square,
the symmetrical garden plots are divi¬
ded by intersecting canals into four
square parterres. The 20 ft. broad
canals are paved and contain rows of
fountains in red sandstone and marble.
Tanks containing fountains are placed
at the intersections of the canals.
The middle terrace measuring 290
yds. by 84 yds. is subdivided length¬
wise into three parts. The central part
contains the great tank over two
hundred feet across and having more
than one hundred fountains four
pavilions and the great cascade. This
is the most spectacular feature of the
garden. The tinkling music of the foun¬
tain jets and their falling sprays res¬
embling masses of diamonds, the rip¬
pling and singing cascades and the
sweet fragrance of flowers create an
atmosphere little short of magical.

The original names of the terraces
"Farah Bakhsh" (Bestower of Plea¬
sure) and "Faiz Bakhsh" (Bestower of
Plenty) clearly indicate that while in
the upper terrace only flowers and
sweet scented shrubs were planted, the
middle and lower terraces were reser¬
ved for fruit trees. The eastern and
western parts of the middle terrace
were composed entirely of rosebeds.
Cypresses, poplars and chenar trees
lined the sides of the "khayabans" or
raised brick pavements, transforming
them into beautiful shady avenues.
Historians of that time record that
within the gardens were planted
fruit trees of every season and
climate, such as mango, cherry, apri¬
cot, peach, apple, almond, quince,
seedless mulberry and sweet and bitter
orange. Roses, tulips, irises, cyclamen,
crown imperials, lilies, pinks, narcissus,
jasmine, lilac, lotus and many other
flowers bloomed exquisitely.
The canal waters, brought from the
river Ravi, entered the gardens from
the south, rippled over the great cas¬
cade and flowed into the main tank on
the middle terrace. After splitting into
three cascades, they passed into the
lower terrace canals and eventually
flowed out of the northern side of the
Shalamar Gardens.
"The garden contains so many build¬
ings" wrote a 17th century historian,
Muhammad Salih, "that when the Em¬
peror, along with the royal harem, en-

camps there not a single tent need be
pitched".
The upper terrace alone has eight
buildings, including the royal "Aram-
gah" (resting place) whose middle
room has a beautiful cup-shaped mar¬
ble basin with a fountain "like a foam¬
ing spring". Another building on its
eastern side and now known as "Naq-
qar Khana", or place of fanfare, was
originally the "Jharoka-e-Daulat Khana-
e-Khas-o-Am" or Balcony of the Hall
of Private and Public Audience. On
the western side of the terrace is the
"Khwabgah" or sleeping chambers of
the Empress.
The arcaded building on the nor¬
thern side, overlooking the great mar¬
ble cascade and the two lower ter¬
races, is the "Aiwan" or Grand Hall,
the walls of which were originally
decorated with panelling and frescoes.
Each corner of this terrace is occu¬
pied by a "burj" or tower comprising
an octagonal chamber surmounted by
a red sandstone octagonal pavilion.
In the south-east corner of the mid¬
dle terrace is the "hamam" or royal
bath comprising a "Sard Khana" (cold
bath) "Garm Khana" (hot bath) and a
large "Rakht Khana" (dressing room).
Originally the interior of the bath was
decorated with delicate pletra-dura
work.
IN THE
REALM
OF THE
GREAT
MOGHUL
Chaynes, belles & guilt banners...
For four years, from 1615 to 1619, Sir Thomas Roe diplo¬
mat and author, served as English ambassador to the
court of the Moghul emperor Jahangir, father of Shah
Jahan who built the Shalamar Gardens at Lahore. The
journals kept by Sir Thomas and the reports and letters
he despatched from the Moghul court are enriched with
vivid descriptive accounts and copious details of local
customs. Below a short extract from "Embassy of Sir
T. Roe to the Court of the Great Moghul" (edited with
an introduction by William Foster. London 1899) :
This day was the Birth of the king and solemnized as a
great feast . . . The tyme was spent in bringing of his
greatest Eliphantes before him, some of which, beeing
Lord Eliphants. had their chaynes, belles, and furniture
of Gould and siluer, attended with many guilt banners
and flagges. and 8 or 10 Eliphantes wayting on him
On the eastern and western fringes
of the great tank are two pavilions
originally built in red sandstone but
now lime plastered. In the centre of
the great tank approached by red
sandstone causeways is a raised plat¬
form called "Mahtabi" or "of the moon"
since it was used for sitting out of
doors to enjoy the moonlight.
On the lower terrace is the "Chini-
Khana", a three sided "abshar" or
waterfall. Its three marble-faced walls
have small niches in which golden
flower vases were placed in the
daytime and camphored .wax candles
at night.
Since the lamps make an endless
chain of light and create coloured
reflections on the water sheet falling
on the opposite walls it is also called
"Dip Mala", or chain of lights.
Facing it is a three-arched ruined
pavilion, the "Daulat Khana-e-Khas" or
Hall of Private Audience of the Em¬
peror. Its dado was in marble and
its walls were originally decorated
with frescoes.

woorthy as I euer saw any of beasts only. The keepers
of euery Chefe Eliphant gaue a present. So with gratious
complements to mee he rose and went in.
Palaces, orchards & bazaars...
The text presented below is taken from the journal of
Fray Sebastien Manrique, an Augustinian missionary,
entitled: "Itinerary of the missions in Eastern India
together with a brief account of the great and wealthy
kingdom of the Emperor and Grand Moghul Shah Jahan,
and other kings who, during their reign, aided the missio
naries of Saint Augustine". During these missions Fray
Manrique spent 13 years (1629-1643) travelling throughout
the Indo-Pakistan sub-continent. The extract given here
is from an English edition of his journal. Volume II,
Oxford, 1927.
This city of Laor [Lahore] is the second city of the Moghul
Empire, famous both as having been... a place of residence
for its monarchs, and also owing to its wealth and gran¬
deur. This is augmented by its being adorned with magni¬
ficent Palaces, delightful gardens, and fruitful orchards,
full of reservoirs and springs of excellent water. The
riches discernible in its main street, or as the inhabitants
style it. Bazaar of the Souk, were such as already proved
the advantages derived by these regions from the richest
and most powerful parts of Europe, especially on this
occasion, when the Emperor was present for the feast
of the Nauruz [New Year], which that year fell during
Ramadan, with its thirty days fast.
joyed by many Moghul rulers, and it
was here that the Princess Zebunnisa,
talented daughter of Emperor Aurang-
zeb, moved by the rhythmic sound of
the cascade, composed these verses:
"O waterfall I for whose sake art thou
[weeping?
In whose sorrowful recollection hast
[thou wrinkled thy brows?
What pain was it that impelled thee,
[like myself, the whole night
To strike thy head against stone and
[to shed tears?"
The gardens were well looked after
during the Moghul period but after the
collapse of Moghul authority in the
Punjab the Shalamar was plundered.
A Sikh governor of the province later
on undertook to preserve the gardens.
He redug the canals and tanks and
restored the water supply, stopped all
ploughing within the walls and lime
plastered the denuded structures. But
for his belated patronage the Shalamar
Gardens would have disappeared.
Since the gardens were handed
over to the Pakistan Department of
Archaeology, sustained efforts have
been made to preserve the buildings,
to restore the gardens to their origi¬
nal appearance and to recreate the
former atmosphere.
A phased programme to illuminate
the garden has already been initiated
and a master plan for its preservation
and restoration, costing over $2 mil¬
lion, has been prepared.
The Government of Pakistan has
already taken steps to execute this
master plan. When completed it will
go a long way towards reviving the
glory that was Shalamar.
ISLAMABAD
modern capital
of

Since 1961 a great modern city
Pakistan's new capital Islamabad
has risen, Brasilia-like, on the
Potwar Plateau between Rawal¬
pindi and ancient Taxilia. Isla¬
mabad is a striking achievement
of architectural design and town
planning. When completed it will
have administrative, residential,
industrial and business sectors,
a diplomatic enclave, a sector for
special institutions, a green-belt
area and a national park with an
Olympic village and zoological and
botanical gardens. Designers have
incorporated traditional Islamic
styles in buildings such as govern¬
ment offices (left) and the imposing
hotel on opposite page. In form,
as In name, Islamabad harmonizes
Pakistan's history and traditions
with modernity and innovation.

MOENJODARO
MODERN METROPOLIS OF ANTIQUITY
(Continued from page 13)
Moenjodaro bear pictographic inscrip¬
tions which have so far defied all
attempts at decipherment. The in¬
terpretation of the script is one of
the greatest problems of the archae¬
ology of the Indus valley. The writing
consists of loops, circles, combs,
ladders, spoked wheels and a variety
of leaf, fish and other shapes.
Sometimes these symbols appear
tantalizingly within grasp, as a former
custodian of Moenjodaro narrating a
small incident pointed out. He once
asked a small boy visiting the Moenjo¬
daro Museum whether he could make
out anything from these inscriptions.
The boy replied after a moment's
thought that these could be the spare
parts of a bullock cart!
The Indus valley script consisting
of some 250 symbols, excluding
variants, is considered to be a picto¬
graphic writing, presumably read from
right to left and is judged to be a level
higher in precision than the hiero¬
glyphic script of Egypt, or the cunei¬
form script of Mesopotamia.
The signs do not appear to be
alphabetic and possibly may represent
either syllables, ideograms, or deter¬
minatives related to the class of things
to which the word belongs.
The script does not show any
relation with the ancient writings of
the Middle Eastern countries, but it
is just possible that its invention was
inspired by the example of the cunei¬
form script of Mesopotamia. At any
rate the discussion remains purely
academic as long as the script remains
undeciphered. (See article page 28.)
38
OST common ornaments
found at Moenjodaro are necklaces and
pendants of semi-precious stones.
Decorative faience and paste beads
also seem to have been fairly popular.
Some cornelian beads etched and
marked with designs in white are the
same as those found in Mesopotamia
and Iran, and they undoubtedly provide
evidence of trade relations with the
Middle East.
Gold necklaces, armlets, bangles
and finger rings were commonly worn
by both sexes, while long cornelian
beads, ear-rings and anklets were
meant for women only. Some of the
unusually long cornelian beads indicate
advanced techniques of drilling fine
and uniform holes through hard
substances. A feat of such great skill
might have been performed with some
delicate drill of high speed.
Among the many implements un¬
earthed at Moenjodaro are stone tools
lying alongside copper and bronze
tools and utensils. The stone tools
are mostly long chert flakes with worn
and serrated edges, evidently used as
knives for cutting meat and vegetables.
Stone vessels are few but there are
some alabaster dishes thick and
clumsy in appearance.
Almost a complete series of stone
weights have also been found which
bear a binary ratio. These weights
are made of highly polished pieces of
chert, quartzite, alabaster, limestone
and jasper. Their shapes are cubical,
half-cubical, cylindrical and spherical.
Very few weights are reported to be
defective in measure, a fact which
signifies a consistency of commercial
standards maintained by the state.
Among the other objects found at
Moenjodaro, the gamesmen of carved
stones for chess and games of dice
are particularly noteworthy. There is
also a terracotta saucer with a spiral
channel, which is certainly the
forerunner of the game of bagatelle.
These paraphernalia of indoor
recreation indicate that the ancient
inhabitants led a life of consider¬
able prosperity and pleasure.
There are some cooking pots,
agricultural implements, mirrors, sta¬
tuettes and ornaments made of copper
and bronze. The earthenware objects
include a wide range of pottery varying
in size from miniature containers for
perfumes and cosmetics to large
vessels for animal fodder, storing
other products, or for sanitary pur¬
poses.
The pottery is mostly wheel-turned
in plain shapes or with decorations in
paints, graffito, etc. The highly
specialized character is evident from
decorations on the red ware. The
patterns consist of geometric shapes,
as well as stylized human, animal and
bird forms and vegetation. Fish-scale
patterns, intersecting circles, pipal leaf
motifs and checkerboard designs are
fairly common, with some incised and
stamped pottery.
The Indus Valley Civilization thus
floats within the ken of knowledge
quite dramatically and disappears with
equal suddenness. Between it and
the next important phase in the
chronology of the sub-continent there
is a wide gap, which it is the hope of
archaeologists to fill one day.
Among the causes of the decline
and fall of this civilization, scholars
enumerate a progressive desiccation
of the climate of the Indus valley,
devastation by floods, some kind of
mysterious epidemic which wiped out
the population, and lastly, but strongly
emphasized, forays of marauding
bands of Aryans, pouring down in
waves from the mountain passes in the
north and west. Each possibility has
its own merits and arguments, but the
definitive answer has yet to come.
HE ruins of Moenjodaro,
buried beneath the accumulation of
thousands of years, remained in an
excellent state of preservation. But as
soon as they were exposed from
oblivion to the incredulous gaze of the
20th century, they were overtaken by
the plague of water-logging and the
leprosy of salinity. These two diseases
combined with the threat of erosion
by the Indus river, pose a grim danger
to the very existence of one of the
most remarkable cultural legacies of
the human race.
The present state of the archaeo¬
logical remains at Moenjodaro has
attracted the attention of specialists
and laymen alike. It is doubtful if any
other country, had it inherited Moenjo¬
daro, would have done more for its
preservation than what has been done
so far by Pakistan, despite her tight
economy.
But saving the ruins of Moenjodaro
from total obliteration is not the
responsibility of Pakistan alone. It is
in fact the combined responsibility of
the entire civilized world.
Tangible arrangements to tackle this
important task with the help of Unesco
are now in the offing and on completion
may in themselves be a monument to
modern technology and international
co-operation.

NASIMI
poet-philosopher
of Azerbaijan
Imadeddin Nasimi's name is famous as
one of the great poet-philosophers of
the Muslim world. Born in Shemakka,
Azerbaijan, 600 years ago, his anniver¬
sary has been celebrated in various
parts of the world this year. Special
international commemorations were
held in Baku and Moscow last Septem¬
ber organized by the Azerbaijanian
Academy of Sciences with the partici¬
pation of Unesco. "Nasimi's poems",
declared the President of the Azer¬
baijanian S.S.R., Kurban Khalilov,
"glorify the beauty and joy of life".
All his works "are permeated by this
indomitable belief in man and man's
ability to develop spiritually and assert
himself". "Nasimi", he said, "called on
man to reason, fight religious fanaticism
and deliver himself from the psychology
of slavery. "In the article published here
the Soviet writer Vagif Aslanov speaks
of the poetry of Nasimi and its meaning
in the world of today.
by Vagif Aslanov
IIMADEDDIN NASIMI, the great Azerbaijanian
poet and an outstanding figure in the poetry and philoso¬
phical thought of the Orient was the founder of philosophical
poetry in the Azerbaijanian language.
At the time he lived and wrote, at the turn of the fourteenth
and fifteenth centuries, religious obscuranticism was
dominant and his homeland was ravaged by invasion.
Those propagating humanist views, opposing feudal
oppression and calling on men to trust in their own powers
were punished by death or imprisonment and all non¬
conformist writings were burned.
His surviving poems show that Nasimi had an ency¬
clopaedic grasp of the learning of his day. He was a
propagator and leading theorist of Hurufism, a mystic
pantheistic doctrine which emerged in Azerbaijan at the
dawn of the fifteenth century. Its name came from the
Arab word huruf, or letters.
Hurufism deified numerals, letters and the combination
of letters in words. It regarded letters as the basis of
the whole universe. It believed that all the letters of the
alphabet, the whole of Holy Scripture and even God
himself were manifest on the face of man. In Nasimi's
poems we often find such explicit statements as, Supreme
God is himself humanity's son. Nasimi says to his reader:
O you in whose face pristine substance is seen, your image
is merciful and gracious God.
Nasimi used the personal pronoun "I" in the generic
sense to mean "all men":
Since my ending is eternal and my beginning
[primordial,
Primordially and eternally I am the Supreme Being.
He ascribed to man all the epithets of God in the
Koran: The thirty-two immortal letters I am; no mate, no
like, no substitute have I.
The founder of Hurufism was the great Azerbaijanian
philosopher Fazlullah Naimi, who set out his doctrine
in the treatise entitled Djavidan-Nama (The Book of
Eternity). Fazlullah Naimi was executed by Tamerlaine's
son, Miran Shah in 1394. Nasimi then left Baku and went
to Turkey. For spreading Hurufi ideas he was prosecuted
and jailed. According to contemporary chronicles, Nasimi
spent the last days of his life in the city of Aleppo.
It is recorded that a pupil of his declaimed one of Nasimi's
Persian ghazels in the street: To see my face you need an
eye that can perceive True God. How can the eye that is
short-sighted see the face of God?
Hearing this heresy religious fanatics arrested the youth
and ordered him to name the author of the poem. The
youth said it was his own poem and he was promptly
sentenced to death. Learning of this, Nasimi went to the
place of execution and demanded the innocent youth's
release, saying that he himself was the author.
The religious fanatics resolved to flay Nasimi alive. He
faced this terrible death with characteristic dignity. During
the torture one of the divines present asked Nasimi: "You
say you are God. Then why do you grow pale as your
blood drains away?" To which Nasimi replied: "I am the
sun of love on eternity's horizon. The sun always pales
at sundown."

VAGIF ASLANOV is senior researcher at the Language Institute of the
Academy of Sciences of the Azerbaijan Republic, where he heads the
Dept. of Comparative Studies of Turk Languages. He recently
compiled and commented a two-volume edition of works by Imadeddin
Nasimi (published in Baku, capital of Azerbaijan). A one-volume
English edition has just been published in Moscow by Progress
Publishers.

NASIMI (Continued)
Thus Nasimi, whose poems praise truthfulness in man
and the nobility and beauty of the human heart and soul,
took his place in history as a hero who sacrificed his life
for a fellow-man, for the triumph of justice.
In his poems Nasimi summons man to know himself and
his own divine nature. He believed that only man can
grasp all the secrets of Creation. In oriental mythology
the legendary Iranian ruler Djemshid, or Djem, had a cup
which, when full of wine, showed all that was happening
in the world.
Nasimi often calls human reason the cup of Djemshid.
The essence of God is hidden in man, the wine in the
chalice of Djem is man. Knowledge and reason are the
greatest riches and knowledge gives man strength :
O you who thirst for pearls and gold, for knowledge
[strive.
For is not knowledge of man gold and pearls?
And again: He who masters knowledge, O man, is strong.
The man of reason who is aware of his divine majesty is
the most precious being in all Creation: O you who call a
stone earth a precious pearl, is not man who is so fair
and gentle also a pearl?
40
I OST religions regard God as the Creator at
whose command "Let there be . . ." the world was made.
Extolling man's beauty and powers, Nasimi regards man
as the maker of all things: Since I am primordial and eternal,
I am the Creator and the creature of the universe.
Nasimi deeply believed that God's command "Let there
be..." was prompted by the power of human speech:
This command by which all things were made possessed
the power of our voice and speech.
While proclaiming man to be God Nasimi does not idealize
man and elevate him to Heaven but, on the contrary,
placing God within man, he particularly stresses his material
origin: Why are fire and water, earth and air given the name
of man? Entranced by the beauty of man who embraces
"the four elements and the six dimensions", the poet
exclaims: Praise him who combines the earth with fire and
air. praise the artist who impresses this form upon waterl
In many of his poems he voices the thoughts and suffer¬
ings of a man gripped by earthly passion for a woman
by whose beauty he is entranced.
Nasimi used poetic forms widespread in the Near and
Middle East: the ghazel (love poem), rubai (quatrain), qasida
(ode), and mesnevi (rhymed couplets), forms of classic
Arabic and Persian poetry. His brilliant poems had a
decisive influence on the later development of these forms
in Turkish poetry.
Ghazels are traditionally love poems about a beautiful
woman, about the lover's anguish, the grief of separation
and the joys of meeting. Nasimi, however, treats social
and philosophical themes in his ghazels, which may run
to forty or fifty couplets. The distinctive features of his
poetry are its combination of lyric verse and philosophical
thought, its rich and bold rhythms, harmonies, alliteration
and internal rhymes.
Even in his love poems Nasimi boldly opposed religious
scholasticism and stated his own philosophy. Comparing
his beloved's dark locks to heresy or disbelief and her
fair face to belief, he notes how sweetly they live together:
If disbelief is not belief, how did I come to find the light of
faith within the circle of your faithless locks? And again.
/ say to him who does not know the secrets of your locks
and face, they are the very essence of belief and disbelief.
Praising nature's charms, man's power and nobility and
the grandeur of reason, fostering love of man and setting
a high value on human dignity, Nasimi raised to a new
height the ideas of humanism in oriental poetry? He strove
for man's moral purity, taught norms of humanist morality
and called on man to reject duplicity, villainy, ignorance,
greed and conceit and to do good deeds and to respect
his fellow-men. Nasimi proudly proclaimed: / have no share
in the enslavement of man. God knows I speak the truth.
Nasimi's poetry affirmed life and urged man to relish
all the joys in this world. He categorically rejected the
world beyond and considered it Heaven to merge with
one's beloved in this world:
Do not thirst for happiness in the world beyond the
[grave,
For Paradise and its fair maidens is to meet your
[lovel
For this reason he reproached the preachers and legis¬
lators:
O preacher, do not seek to scare me with tomorrow!
The sage for whom tomorrow comes today, is
[unafraid.
Although they promise us God's wine and honey in
[Paradise,
It is your lips I need for there I find both honey and
[wine...
The freedom and happiness, dignity and majesty of man
form the leitmotif of Nasimi's poems. Of the grandeur
and dignity of man he wrote: Both worlds within my
compass come, but this world cannot compass me. The
poet was in love with the world in which he lived and in
which his poetry lives on. Not for one moment did he wish
to exchange for Paradise the moments of joy with his
beloved in this world:
My rival says: Give me today's lovel Take tomorrow
[for yourself!
An hour spent with my love for a whole epoch I shall
[not exchange.
Nasimi urged people to place no trust in empty promises:
O heart reject vain promises! Let us spend this moment
in pleasure I Yesterday has gone, tomorrow is unknown,
and so this moment is pleasure.
NlASIMI's poetry is rooted in the social, political
and cultural development of the countries of the Near and
Middle East, and especially of his homeland of Azerbaijan.
It expresses the poet's own extremely complex outlook.
There are occasional notes of pessimism; alongside his
faith and confidence in man's might and goodness there
are expressions of distrust. Nasimi complains that in this
deceitful world there is no true friend and no true love:
Where is the friend who is true to his promise, where the
beloved who utters the truth? In one quatrain he says:
The men of this world have become scorpions and snakes.
Evil is widespread throughout the world. Where shall one
find a true friend of pure heart? Where is the man of
conscience and justice?
Sometimes he curses the world, observing that unworthy
fools hold the reins of government while men of learning
and noble ideas have no say. Nevertheless the poet does
not lose hope and he trusts that justice will triumph: O
nightingale, do not grieve on parting from the rose! Be
patient!. Winter shall- pass, the garden fill with blossom
and spring shall come.
Many of his verses are aphoristic, expressing moral sen¬
timents and maxims. Do not grasp the hand of foes, though
sweet as honey it may be... How can a man who is corrupt
your proper worth assess?... It is hell with villains to
converse.
Nasimi was fully justified in ranking himself alongside the
unsurpassed lyric poets of Persian literature, Salman
Saveji and Faridaddin Attar. Valuing riches of the
spirit above all else, Nasimi declares: / am he to whom as
servants shahs and sultans come, I am he whose watchman
and custodian is the sun.
Addressing his readers Nasimi declares:
Call me a man who has immortal life,
For I immortal am and ever alive.

Letters to the Editor
THE SCOURGE
OF CHILD LABOUR
Sir,
Your article "40 million child-workers
in the world today" (October, 1973)
was timely and deals with a deeply
disturbing situation. May 1 take up the
question of what is being done, and
what should be done, about what you
rightly describe as "the scourge of
child labour".
The International Labour Office paper
(their report IV (1) of 1972) from which
you quote has now led to the adoption
of a new Convention at the Internatio-
tional Labour Conference in June this
year. I was able to attend part of the
conference as a private individual, and
was much moved by the effort of
the representatives of governments,
employers and trade unions to put
together a sound and workable Conven¬
tion to limit child labour.
But although this Convention sets
new standards intended to be of world¬
wide application, it will only become
effective as nations decide to ratify
and enforce it. And the very fact that
so much exploitation of children takes
place in cottage industries, street tra¬
des, agriculture, domestic service, and
small, non-unionised factories, means
that enforcement is quite difficult. It
seems likely that even those countries
who do ratify the Convention will
invoke escape clauses which permit
them to exempt from control precisely
those occupations where the majority
of young children are at work.
So unless ordinary people in all
countries take a lively interest in what
their own government is doing, in the
light of the new Convention, to stop
damage to the health and future of
children by excessive and unsuitable
work, it is unlikely that anything very
effective will be done.
May I therefore urge each of your
readers to try and get hold of a copy
of the new (1973) International Labour
Convention on "Minimum Age for Ad¬
mission to Employment, and in any case
to try to persuade the government of
his country to help to assure the future
health of its citizens by effectively
abolishing the use of children in work
which damages their health and poten¬
tial.
Thank you again for drawing attention
to this very important problem.

Canterbury, Kent, U.K.
CHILDREN IN PERIL
Sir,
I have just read "40 million child-
workers in the world today" (October
1973 issue). The practices exposed in
this article are terrifying especially
when we read of children being em¬
ployed in the manufacture of fireworks.
In France, the employment of children
under the age of 18 in the manufacture
of fireworks was forbidden by a decree
dating back to 1836. The dangers
involved with fireworks are in quite a
different category to those involved in
tasks such as weaving, spinning,
sewing, embroidery, metalwork, leather-
work, making carpets, clothing, shoes,
toys, etc. To the risk of burns and
those from the handling of toxic sub¬
stances for the children you mentioned
as working in glassworks and foundries
must be added the serious risk of
explosions. I do not recall ever having
seen such facts reported in any of the
mass media. Thank you for publishing
this courageous article which will, I
hope, put a stop to this dangerous
exploitation of children.
Georges Angeraud

SHALLOW ATTACK 7
Sir.
I have been requested by the
committee representing all churches
of various denominations in Wootton
Bassett to write to you concerning the
supplement: "Copernicus as Told to
Children" in your April 1973 issue.
The committee are concerned that
what appears to be an unbelievably
shallow attack on Theology as such
supported by various assumptions in
the name of science has been published
in a magazine such as yours. We
believe that such an article can only
confuse the minds of children and
would not seem to be representative
of the many other excellent articles
which appear in your magazine.
P.M.O. Giles
Wootton Basset, U.K.
CATCHING UP
WITH EVENTS
Sir, .
The "Unesco Courier" is indeed a
useful magazine. It provides up-to-date
and accurate information of world-wide
events and developments. It enables
people particularly students and teach¬
ers to catch up with world events.
I especially appreciated your April
1973 issue on Copernicus and its
children's story. I am still a student
and find it difficult to get your magazine
because of foreign currency problems.

WORLD'S DEBT
TO PASTEUR
Sir,
I was very happy with your issue
on Copernicus because it helped me
in my studies of international scientific
collaboration.
I can only regret that your magazine
did not devote a whole issue in 1972
to the commemoration of the 150th
anniversary of the great French scientist,
Louis Pasteur (1822-1895).
This anniversary was widely marked,
especially In France and the Soviet
Union. In all major cities of the U.S.S.R.
ceremonies were held and a special
scientific conference was jointly arrang¬
ed by the U.S.S.R. Academy of Scien¬
ces, Academy of Medical Sciences,
Ministry of Public Health and the Gama-
leya Institute of Epidemiology and
Microbiology.
Pasteur's services to mankind are
immense in terms of medical theory,
its practical application and (few people
are fully aware of this) in promoting
intensive co-operation among the
world's scientists. What man could not
achieve over the centuries to advance
all walks of life, wrote the great Russian
scientist Kliment A. Timiryazev, Pasteur
did in his lifetime.

BACK TO BOSSU ET 7
Sir,
Your number on the origins of man
August-September 1972) was an out¬
standing achievement. I have since
loaned my copy to several friends who
have found in the articles answers to
many of the questions put to them by
their young children on this subject.
This first-rate piece of science popu¬
larization will help to train young minds
to think rationally. I am surprised that
the Bernese Monday Group of School
Mothers (Letters page, January 1973)
should protest against scientific discov¬
eries that are contributing to our know¬
ledge of man as an animal species.
Every time fossil discoveries confirm
that we belong to the order of primates,
going back into the most distant past,
must we bring out Bossuet's theory
that the world was created in the
autumn of the year 4004 A.D. ("Dis¬
cours sur l'Histoire Universelle"), or
quote the first chapters of Genesis to
"enlighten" people?
Renée Fournier

SOS FROM
PLANET EARTH
Sir,
Day after day articles on pollution
appear in international publications. It
is clear that we, the younger genera¬
tion, must fight to ensure that our
children will enjoy a cleaner world than
that in which we live. I would like to
appeal to young people the world over
to join in an International campaign
using letters, telephone calls and other
means of communication. Every day
we should remind people that planet
Earth is making a last cry for help.
I think it is up to Unesco to provide
young people with the means to carry
out such a campaign.
David G. Cross
Palma Soriano, Cuba
SPARK OF LEARNING
Sir.
Your November 1972 issue on the
crisis in schools and in education in
general deeply impressed me. Resolv¬
ing this crisis is one of the most urgent
tasks for our generation. But one can
never overemphasize the vital role in
education of individual imagination.
Virtually every kind of work calls for
imagination and each great discovery
is the fruit of an imaginative mind. Yet
we still do our best to stifle it in the
child, in whom it flourishes so richly.
We can never remind parents and
teachers of this fact too often.

Mystery script of Moenjodaro
The seals of the Indus
Valley Civilization of
Moenjodaro, engraved
4,500 years ago, carry
mysterious inscrip¬
tions that scholars are
still trying to decipher
(see article page 28).
The three seals along¬
side are presented in
two forms : left, the
actual seal with hol-
lowed-out animal fig¬
ure and script; right,
the impression made
by the same seal. For
a curious optical effect
turn the page upside
down and the hollow-
ed-out figures will
appear in relief and
vice-versa.
