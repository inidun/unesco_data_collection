This flute-playing bronze "Bodhisattva", or future Buddha, was sculptured
in the eighth century A.D. on the face of a votive lantern which stands
in the avenue leading to the great Todaiji Temple in Nara, Japan. The
ancient city of Nara, 220 miles southwest of Tokyo was an outstanding
centre of Japanese art. The period of 80 years from when the capital of
Japan was established in Nara in 710 A.D. until its transfer to Kyoto in
794, is known as the Golden Age of Japanese sculpture.

Formerly, science and culture were
indistinguishable. Today they appear to
be regaining their basic unity. Both are
engaged in a pursuit of wisdom that
transcends the gap, even the feud, that
has developed between them (see arti¬
cles pp. 4 and 11). Photo shows tiny

science that until recently were used

they are being superseded by much

SCIENCE
AND THE CULTURE
OF OUR TIMES
by Laurence Af. Could
W,
HILE modern society
seems confident that science and
technology can take care of all human
needs, I still think not enough people
appreciate the magnitude and the vio¬
lence of the scientific technological
revolution in which we are involved.
Today, there is no other influence
comparable with science in changing
the foundations, indeed, the very
character of our lives.
Science and its products determine
our economy, dominate our industry,
affect our health and welfare, alter
our relations to all other nations, and
determine the conditions of war and
peace. Everyone who breathes is
affected, and cannot remain imper¬
vious to them.
Our very existence is so completely
dependent upon science and techno¬
logy that it would be impossible to
materially alter our present methods.
We have no option. We can't stifle
man's curiosity. It is only from the
knowledge that we gain by asking
questions, no matter how terrible, how
dreadful they are; it is only by these
questions that man achieves final
dignity.
When I was president of the Ameri¬
can Association for the Advancement
of Science, I attended the British
Association meetings. I was dumb¬
founded and delighted to hear
J.C, Dancy, the great classical scholar,
headmaster of Marlborough College,
argue "technology and a liberal edu¬
cation, far from being antithetical, are
not even complementary; some expe-

LAURENCE M. GOULD is former president
of the American Association far the
Advancement of Science. He is now
chairman of the Committee on Polar Re¬
search, U.S. Academy of Sciences, and
has taken part in several expeditions to
the Arctic and Antarctic. He has written
extensive/y on Antarctica, the International
Geophysical Year and international science.
Readers will recall his article, "Antarctica,
International Land of Science" which
appeared in the January 1962 issue of the
"Unesco Courier".
rience in technology is an essential
ingredient in a liberal education."
The Greeks did not scorn techno¬
logy. Classical Greek civilization was
characterized by a unity between art,
science, and technology; a unity which
is the hallmark of all great civiliza¬
tions; a unity which disappeared then
until Leonardo da Vinci. A historian
of science might say that the schism
we now know began then, and yet
philosophy and science were indis¬
tinguishable until almost the end of the
18th century. You can date with
exactness when the split came: when
philosopher Immanuel Kant said that
science dealt only with the world of
appearance, and philosophy with the
world of reality. Nonsensel
Nevertheless, a dangerous gap has
developed. It was greatly overstated
by C.P. Snow. I do not subscribe to
the idea of two cultures. The gap
exists, but the feud between science
and the humanities is without substan¬
ce. It is time it be ended. We must
have humanists who comprehend and
include scientific and technological
knowledge in their dreams of the
world, else we shall have no world
at all. We must recover the Renais¬
sance. The pursuit of wisdom must
at long last be a single enterprise,
or liberal education has no meaning.
I studied geology, therefore, I'm a
scientist and not a humanist? Some¬
body studies philosophy or art and,
therefore, is a humanist? Nonsense!
It isn't true at all. To major in philo¬
sophy does not make you a humanist.
Don't you remember the greatest of
all teachers once said, "Not all who
cry Lord, Lord, shall enter the King¬
dom of Heaven"? A chemist with
an omnivorous intellectual appetite
may be a greater humanist than a
philosopher whose interest is confin¬
ed to existentialism.
Part of the problem is semantics.
Certain words lose their meaning.
I think humanism has. It implies that
all else may be something less than
human. I was delighted when Joseph
Wood Krutch wrote in a "Saturday
Review" article, "the trouble is that
Text copyright © Reproduction prohibited
"humanities', narrowly interpreted,
ceases to mean much more than the
polite accomplishment analogous to
the needlework and flower painting
which (adíes were once supposed to
dabble in, primarily to demonstrate
that they were ladies rather than
something economically and socially
inferior."
Let me state a little more seriously:
a great disservice has been done to
the truly humanistic tradition by trying
to identify it too closely with particular
fields of study. Many supposed
conflicts rise from a gross misunder¬
standing of what science is all about.
Science is not a form of black magic.
A thousand blind alleys must often be
explored before a right road is found;
a thousand amateurs must have their
fling before a Darwin or an Einstein
comes along.
Whenever you hear a scientist say,
"This is the end of it; this is all of it",
that man is no longer a scientist.
There is no quest for truth in scientific
research which does not carry within
itself the possibility, even the proba¬
bility, of error. We respect the find¬
ings of science because they are
always open to re-examination and to
question. Scientific truth is dynamic
and self-correcting and never final.
When someone asked Einstein how
he discovered the theory of relativity,
he replied, "By challenging an axiom."
There never was a great scientist who

Though science has long been changing
the very nature of human life,
surprisingly little place is given
to the great discoveries of science
in many history books. Certain do not
even mention such famous names
as Galileo, Kepler, Descartes
and Newton. Photo recalls one of Galileo's
studies on the laws of bodies in motion
his demonstration that bodies of
different weights fall with equal
velocities, said to have been carried
out in 1589 from the Leaning Tower
of Pisa (in background).

SCIENCE AS CULTURE (Continued)
Why not an epic poem on Relativity or DNA?
did not make bold guesses, and never
one whose guesses were always right.
The scientist looks for order. He
believes in a real world and he
believes that science is a means of
teaching the truths about that world.
But still, he's got to make guesses.
He must invent concepts to make the
world intelligible.
So the scientific world never reflects
completely the real world, but only
selected characteristics organized on
accepted assumptions.
The best definition of science is
one by George Boas: "Science is
the art of understanding nature."
There is no better definition.
It is oversimplification to talk about
"the scientific method." There isn't
one. There are a thousand, all rational
methods. But human rationality is
the most important realm in which
man can fruitfully live.
To me, pure science has been, along
with religion and art, one of man's
great avenues in his quest for truth.
As Jacob Bronowski points out, "1
believe the concepts of value in the
humanities are not as different in kind
from those of sciences as many would
have us believe. Both seek to express
the deep relations between the human
mind and the world it matches."
Coleridge, trying to define beauty,
always returned to: "Beauty is unity
and variety." Well, reverse it science
is the search to discover unity in the
wild variety of nature.
Both the scientist and the poet seek
to explore and to understand. It is
only the form of exploration which
is different. You cannot enter any
world of meaning without making
postulates. In religion we call them
faith; in ethics we call them norms
or ideals; in science we call them
hypotheses or theories; the choice of
these hypotheses or theories or
assumptions is always a matter of
faith.
There is a fallacious idea that
science is objective while the human¬
istic studies are subjective. This is
complete nonsense. Science is always
the record of someone's personal
experience. There is no kind of
experience that can be impersonal.
No one can have the same experien¬
ces I have had; the best he can do is
have the same kind, and in no case
has science reduced the personal

Building has always drawn on
technological innovations, and
architecture is as much a science
as an art. From the use of concrete,
steel and glass have come new concepts
of building design and construction.
Right, a building in Chandigharh,
capital of Panjab (India), built to the
plans of Le Corbusier.
equation to zero. Science is subjective
within man's nature in the same sense
that the other humanistic studies are.
If what I say is true, why has not
science played a larger role in liberal
education? And though science is so
all-pervasive, why have scientists not
become a part of the ordinary citizen's
experience of knowledge. More stran¬
gely, poets and playwrights have not
drawn heavily upon science and tech¬
nology. Twentieth century art and
letters do not have great expressions
concerning the industrial revolution
and its science and technology.
Shelly, in his defence of poetry,
said that one of the tasks of the
literary artist is to "Absorb the know¬
ledge of the sciences and assimilate
it to human needs; colour it with
human passions, transform it with the
blood and bone of human nature." In
other words, literature ought to concern
itself with the whole of life, including
science.
Dante and Milton especially among
Renaissance writers were inspired by
astronomy and dealt with it in their
own sublime language. When Milton
was fascinated by the new optical
instruments of Galileo, and when he
was portraying his Satan tempting

In the 5th century B.C., Pythagorus, the great
philosopher and mathematician, demonstrated
the interrelation of music and mathematics,
that music was "the numeral thing par
excellence", as the French musicologist Louis Laloy
has put it, and that musical intervals are determined
by whole numbers. Pythagorus showed
that from a string and the note it produces,
all the notes of the scale may be obtained by
lengthening the string according to given ratios.
In ancient times the Chinese too perceived
the correlation of music with mathematics.
Right, illustrations from a famous work,
"The Theory of Music" (1480), by the Italian
composer Franchino Gafori, show Pythagorus
demonstrating the mathematical essence of music
with the aid of a series of strings (on left) and
with tubes of different lengths filled with air.
From "Enciclopedia délie grandi scoperte et dell'era atómica," Tomaselll, Rome
Christ, he displays to Him the Kingdom
of this world not in antique fashion
through the naked eye, but by "optic
skill of vision multiplied by air or glass
of telescope."
In "Paradise Lost", Milton wrote
about Antarctica: "Beyond this flood
a frozen continent lies dark and wild,
beat with perpetual storms, of whirl¬
winds and dire hail, which on firm land
thaws not but gathers heap, and ruin
seems of ancient pile; all else deep
snow and ice." No one is writing
like that about Antarctica today. Yet
science has given some of the greatest
epic themes in the history of man¬
kind the nuclear atom, the chromo¬
somes, and DNA, more beautiful than
anything man has contrived.
Oh, I wish Milton could have orbited
the earth with John Glenn or Gordon
Cooper! It should have been.
The general theory of relativity by
which Einstein renounced absolute
space and time gave us a picture of
unity and harmony surpassing any
that man had ever dreamed before.
It's probably the finest intellectual
achievement of our times, and yet the
only poem that I've ever been able to
find about relativity is this:
There was a young lady
[named Bright
Who learned to move faster
[than light
She set out one day m a
[relative way
And came back on the pre¬
vious night.
That isn't enoughl
We need more scientists who are
literate and articulate, but we need
more imaginative literature to interpret
our mechanized existence into noble
language to reach and inspire us. In
Shelley's words "which will trans¬
form it with the blood and bone of
human nature."
How shall we do that? In medieval
universities, philosophy gave unity to
the whole. We still have that notion
preserved in the fossilized expression,
Ph.D., Doctor of Philosophy. You know
very well one can have his degree in
economics, animal husbandry, or even
geology without ever having been
exposed to philosophy. There is no
unifying study in our culture today.
But let me suggest that history,
broadly conceived, could provide the
cultural bridge to bring the disciplines
of our academic world into order.
This idea was said more eloquently by
William James: "You can give human¬
istic value to almost anything by teach¬
ing it historically geology, economics,
mechanics are humanities when taught
with reference to the achievements of
the geniuses to which these sciences
owe their being. Not taught thus,
literature remains grammar; art a cata¬
logue; history a list of dates; and
natural science a sheet of formulas,
weights and measures. The sifting of
human creations is what we ought to
mean by the humanities."
What James is saying is that the
humanistic content of any subject lies
in its history. Well, history is built-in
the humanities. You can't teach art
or letters without teaching its history.
But science can be taught; it is too
often taught, as formulas, weights and
measures. Yet science is the product
of historical development. It is the
one truly cumulative aspect of man's
history. Science makes history, but
is largely neglected by historians.
Bacon conceived of the history of
all learning and Bacon insisted that
such history would include the scien¬
ces and the humanities.
In the 1800s, a young German
scientist, Liebig, detected phosphate
and potash in the ashes of burned
plants and found ammonia in the
vapours. He tried all three in a
barren plot of ground. Shortly Darm¬
stadt became a cradle of agricultural
chemistry. Artificial fertilizers were
created which doubled the food capa¬
city of Europe almost overnight. I
have never found any reference to
Liebig in any historical document.
Well, I picked up a text used at
Carleton College called "European
History, Renaissance to Waterloo,"
752 pages. Science was mentioned on
only 33 pages. Even worse, Toynbee's
600-page "Outline of History" did not
mention Kepler, Copernicus, Galileo,
Descartes, or Newton. What kind of
a history of the world is it that leaves
out Newton, the greatest investigator
of all times?
The historians will think I am pick¬
ing on them, and yet I'm not. In some
ways we scientists are worse offen¬
ders. Unfortunately for the human
aspects of science the study of the
past isn't necessary. You can become
a first rate research man in physics
and chemistry without knowing the
history that produced both. So the
rich humanistic heritage of science is
almost as badly neglected by scientists
as by others.
We as scientists and technologists
are so surfeited with information, so
bogged down with the immediate job
that we have neither the time nor the
patience to inquire into the meaning
of what we are doing. T.S. Eliot
summed it up, "Where is the wisdom
we have lost in knowledge, where is
the knowledge we have lost in inform¬
ation?"
Yet you can take any product of
science and technology, trace it to its
ultimate origin, and you would see the
end result of a long and continuing
tradition embodying parts of man's
unending record of failures, stupidities,
and genius.
Lynn White, remarkable medieval
historian, said "To be as concrete as
possible, we shall not have built a new
hberal education in democratic terms
until we can give in our colleges a
course on the internal combustion
engine as humanly conceived as the
course on Shakespeare's plays. Both
are supreme expressions of the mind
and should be studied as such." I
agree.
But, dedicated as I am, I couldn't
hold that an internal combustion engine _
is comparable with the works of 7
Shakespeare. Nothing that man has '
ever done, no split atom, nor any
other achievement is comparable with

his words and phrases. Here is man's
creativity at its greatest.
In the 1920s, on a 2,000-mile sledge
journey in Antarctica, five companions
and I mapped mountains and glaciers
no one had ever seen. I wrote in my
journal: "No work of art of which
I have stood in awe, no symphony
I have ever heard, ever gave me the
thrill that came when I picked up a
piece of rock and found it was the
sandstone I had come all the way to
Antarctica to find." This was true.
It was one of the great spiritual experi¬
ences of my life.
But, if I had to change that experi¬
ence for the satisfactions of having
read and reread Hamlet, which is
surely one of the half dozen wonders
of the world, I would have to choose
Hamlet; but, I don't have to choose.
Neither do you. Both are part of a
larger whole.
In old Europe, scholarship developed
under an all-covering canopy of truth
from the church, and force from the
classics. Both are largely gone. The
Hebrew-Christian tradition has become
so tenuous that many theological
schools say God is dead, and refer to
our times as the post-Christian era.
Twenty-four centuries of Hellenic
domination are gone. Now there is
no generally accepted view on funda¬
ments as in the Renaissance. We are
adrift without an anchor in a world of
shaken beliefs.
That remarkable classical scholar,
the late Sir Richard Livingstone, said:
"We are a generation without either
illusions or a positive faith, kept from
collapse by dead convictions which
still influence the conduct but are no
longer anchored in our beliefs."
My thesis is a simple one: we've
got to find some stronger unifying
element in our intellectual life than
any now apparent. Science, viewed
'historically, is the great untapped
reservoir of humanism which can help
fill the void caused by the decay of
the classical humanism.
We have studied Aristotle as a
great philosopher and metaphysician.
Do we realize he was one of the great
figures of science? Are we taught
he was considered the greatest natu¬
ralist, the father of biology, the man
who opened inquiry into physiology,
embryology, comparative anatomy, and
ecology? Darwin didn't know this,
Darwin was fairly old before he heard
of Aristotle. Then, he wrote: "I had
not the remotest notion what a won¬
derful man Aristotle was."
My comment on the lost unity of
humanist education is an expression
of profound regret. All the great
cultures China, Athens, India were
held together by ideas based upon
spiritual unity, and of all the things
that are part of our lives, science and
technology are the most pervasive.
They diffuse more rapidly than any
other. Literature and art remain pro¬
vincial. But not science and techno¬
logy. Their product is immediately
understandable to all peoples. Scien¬
tific workers have a sense of world
citizenship. Discoveries have signi¬
ficance only when communicated to
other scientists. Scientific knowledge
is a living, growing thing. Scientific
knowledge must be used; it doesn't
keep any better than fish.
The universal status of science, its
proudest claim, is also its greatest
opportunity. In an age characterized
by perfection of means and confusion
of ideals, the disciplines of science
which admit no frontiers of race or
creed, provide a basis for effective
international co-operation. Science has
long since made the world one com¬
munity; a statement that cannot be
made about any of the other avenues
that man has followed in his quest for
an orderly world. Today the contend¬
ing forces which make the strongest
appeal are the national and the
racialist movements which deny this
principle of science.
Science came into being and has
evolved because man is curious; he's
relatively intelligent; to become intel¬
lectually enlightened he had to have
a desire to better understand his world,
and in the broadest sense, science
was the first common enterprise of
mankind.
My fellow scientists know that
it takes two or three thousands of
millions of years to account for me.
I have a documentary body, I am a
museum of all life, I am a part of all
that has preceded me; and science,
like biology, like life itself, has grown
not by revolution, but by evolution.
The germs of science are as old as
man.
When we use the word "science"
now, we think of only four centuries.
Yet it began when man got up off his
front feet and began using stones for
tools. Progress was infinitely slow,
and then came the discoveries of the
Egyptians, Sumerians, and Babylo¬
nians; and upon these the Greeks
built their own system of knowledge.
The historian who follows a single
people finds them dust and forgotten,
but their science lives on.
Science and technology have woven
unity into our society and we could
not escape if we would. Here are two
examples: the International Geophy¬
sical year began July 1, 1957, and
ended theoretically, December 31,
1958. It was the greatest peacetime
activity in mankind's history, with
nearly 70 nations, 40,000 scientists in
4,000 stations from pole to pole
observing planet earth. There was an
almost magical quality about it. Inter¬
national barriers were lowered and
closed doors opened. There was
simplicity, flexibility, freedom from
political consideration. At its peak,
the whole secretariat consisted of
only eight people.
It was carried out in a period of
worldwide unrest, and yet, we dem¬
onstrated that it is possible to engage
in rational and reasonable conduct at
the scientific level, and that inter¬
national scientific co-operation is the
best model for worldwide organization.
And out of our I.G.Y. co-operative
effort in Antarctica, the coldest con¬
tinent, came the first thaw in the cold
war. For from 12 nations there came
the Antarctic treaty. Hear these
words: "Recognizing that it is in the
interest of all mankind that Antarctica
shall continue forever to be used
exclusively for peaceful purposes and
shall not become the scene or object
of international discord."
I believe the Antarctic treaty is a
breakthrough of international impor¬
tance. It may take its place alongside
the Magna Carta because for the first
time a large part of the world is
dedicated, for the first time, to peace¬
ful purposes. It is a treaty which

prohibits nuclear explosions; a treaty
which provides freedom of scientific
investigation, a treaty which is a prece¬
dent in the field of disarmament, his¬
tory's first test-ban treaty. It is its
first disarmament treaty. It is the first
treaty designed to protect a scientific
programme and then, by some kind of
magic, the programme is implemented
by the Scientific Committee which is
not a government body at all. That
may be one of the reasons it works.
As a result of Antarctica's isolation,
it's the one continent that has never
been the home of man, and the flora
and fauna of Antarctica represent the
only sizable assemblage of organisms
anywhere almost uncontaminated by
man. Neither by accident nor by
design has man introduced new plants
and animals into Antarctica. Perhaps
one tiny part of our earth will remain
as it was before man started spoil¬
ing it.
When I retired as president of
Carleton College in 1962, the student
body gave my wife and me two round
trip tickets to Athens. I had over the
years spoken so often of my fascin¬
ation of classic Greece, that we did
go to Athens and when we arrived,
for some reason, I had a great reluc¬
tance to go and see what I had always
wanted to see.
In the earliest things that I ever
read, I became fascinated with two
people one was Abraham Lincoln
and the other one was Socrates. I had
read so much about the Acropolis, so
much about the Parthenon that I was
afraid to go see them.
Well, a remarkable Greek, Constan¬
tinos Doxiadis a remarkable man
who is doing things about pollution
and many other problems arranged
for us to go up the Acropolis. We did,
and as I stood in the midst of the
columns of the Parthenon looking out
over this beautiful city, it was one of
the most thrilling experiences of my
life, and I realized this was indeed
one of the noblest experiences of the
human spirit.
The next day when I had lunch with
Doxiadis and said of the Acropolis,
"This is the greatest and noblest
expression of the human spirit I have
ever seen", Dr. Doxiadis said, "Yes,
but remember this. For its time, it
was also one of the world's greatest
engineering feats."
You see, the technology and the art
that produced the Parthenon are parts
of a larger whole.
Now, I want to quote from another
philosopher, a friend of mine. He has
been buried for more than 20 centu¬
ries, but he's more alive than two-
thirds of us. His name is Plato, and
he once said this: "What I'm saying
may not be true, but something very
like it is."

IN
THE COSMOS...
E
i VERY day mankind is gain-
in new knowledge. I am thinking first
of the tremendous accumulation of
new scientific data and the Increasing
flood of information available to and
enriching modern society. Knowledge
and achievement in all branches of
science have developed to such an
extent and become so highly specializ¬
ed that no one nowadays can hope to
become an Encyclopaedist like Diderot
Montesquieu or Lomonossov. The age
of the Encyclopaedists is long past.
And as one of our great Russian
scientists Timinazev, if I am not mis¬
taken has so rightly said, in our day
a really cultured man is one who knows
everything about a limited field and
a little about everything.
Be that as it may, the power of
world science has increased tenfold,
penetrating alike into the infinitely
great and the infinitely small, probing
the depths of the universe, the atomic
nucleus and the living cell. And as
the quality of human knowledge has
risen, so it has increased in volume,
if we consider the distribution of know¬
ledge among the inhabitants of our
planet. Yes, undoubtedly mankind as
a whole is growing more learned, more
cultured, more civilized.
But can we say that man is the hap¬
pier for it? Does knowledge alone
make him more sensitive to the joys
of living?
We know that if we are to be able
to draw freely from all the springs
that nourish human feelings, a know-
fry Lev Kassil

writer and ¡ournahst has a scientific back¬
ground (physics and mathematics). His
many articles and books for young people
are famous in the U.S.S.R.
ledge of physical laws alone is not
enough. We must also be able to
see the world in affective terms.
And here man cannot do without the
arts. Victor Hugo said very rightly:
"L'art c'est moi, la science c'est nous."
(I am art, all of us are science.) Ob¬
viously he did not intend by this
aphorism to lay stress on the specific
individualism of art as opposed to the
collective universality and levelling
effect of science.
No doubt he meant that science is
based on objective laws formulated
after analysis, experiment and research.
Once these laws have been demons¬
trated, confirmed and not contradicted
by some new hypothesis or discovery,
they are adopted in an identical man¬
ner by everyone.
A work of art, on the other hand,
however perfect it may be and how¬
ever universal its appeal, permits of a
certain variety of assessments. More¬
over, generalities apart, the artist's
creation always expresses something
of his own personal nature, reflecting
his aspirations, tastes, sympathies and
outlook.
I N any case, these are no
grounds for antagonism between
science and art. Nevertheless, from
time to time there are signs of a
recrudescence of the sort of debate
carried on recently in the Soviet
press. "Physicist or Poet?" was the
title of this discussion quite injus-
tified in my view which stirred up
young intellectuals all over the Soviet
Union where visitors on their first
trip are often astonished by the tre¬
mendous popularity of art and poetry.

LILACS IN THE COSMOS... (Continued)
Supersociety' and the yearning
for beauty
12
It has been argued naively and even
somewhat crudely that today science
and technology give prestige to a
nation, the two enabling us to unravel
many of the mysteries of the invisible
world and to carry man far out into
space.
As for the arts, it has been maintain¬
ed that nowadays the human spirit
has little chance of expressing itself ;
and the advocates of science first
and last have mockingly exclaimed:
"Johann Sebastian Bachl... Alexanaer
Blok! . . . Who needs them today?"
I should like to say that this sporadic
episode met with little success except
perhaps in a few schools where certain
students ill-prepared for their literat¬
ure classes tried to justify their un-
preparedness by alleging that it was
no longer necessary to waste their time
on literature and the arts. This did not
save them from failing their course.
I might add that the very theme of
the debate Physicist or Poet was
hardly original. In the years following
the October Revolution, when part of
the country's youth was tempted to
join the hordes bent on destroying
everything connected with the past,
there were even some who denied any
value whatever not only to classical
art but to every form of art. I even
recall the flippant motto: "Art is the
opium of the people" and "Peace to
the chemists, war on the creative
artistsl" (the latter deriving from the
famous revolutionary slogan: "Peace to
the huts, war on the palaces!")
V
ERY quickly, however,
Lenin explained to the young that the
people who had undertaken to build
a new life could never attain this
objective except by absorbing all the
most precious products of human cul¬
ture and in particular by making use
of the countless treasures created by
the arts throughout the course of
human history.
But the final defeat of these scien¬
tific Savonarolas who proposed to
establish the primacy of practical
science over all other human interests
was completed when the cosmonauts
themselves those who we might well
expect to be the most forthright
spokesmen of the avant garde trends
of our age acknowledged the help
they had found in the great writers
of prose and poetry, as they prepared
their flights into space, and when the
world learned that during their most
trying moments, they found encoura¬
gement in music and song.
And so was born the lovely motto:
"In the cosmos, too, there is a place
for a spray of lilac." After all, science
gives man knowledge, art gives him
feeling. If there is a place in life
for knowledge, there is also a place
for feeling.
And here I might do well to recall
the words of Anton Chekhov: "I wish
people wouldn't see conflict where in
fact there is none. Knowledge is

The level and scope of
scientific knowledge is
greater today than at
any time in history. Yet
the attraction of art and
all forms of beauty has
in no way been sup¬
planted, and aesthetic
education which enri¬
ches the human perso¬

always present in the world Ana¬
tomy and literature are equally noble in
origin. They have common aims and
a common enemy the Devil; there
are therefore absolutely no grounds
for conflict between them."
"There is no struggle for existence
between them. If a man knows about
the theory of the circulation of the
blood, he is rich; if he adds to that a
study of the history of religion and the
song 'I remember a wonderful mom¬
ent' (1), he becomes not poorer, but
richer, and this again is wholly to his
advantage. Men of genius have never
warred with each other and, in the
person of Goethe, we find side by side
the naturalist and the poet."
It may seem scarcely worthwhile
to have brought up all this at a time
when the question, theoretically at
least, seems to be settled once and
for all. It is not without value, how-

ever, to recall the efforts to divorce
knowledge from feeling because in
practice the answer is still a long way
off. Can we in fact honestly maintain
today that the human race, as it gains
in knowledge, is deepening and refin¬
ing its appreciation of the beautiful?
In this connexion I am reminded of
two conversations which I had with
people of sharply diverging spiritual
views. One of them, a devout Christ¬
ian representing a religious brother¬
hood, said to me during one of my
visits to the United States: "Beauty is
God. If from youth you teach a per¬
son to see the hand of God and the
will of God in everything around him,
he will finally understand the harmony
of all things, that is, perfect beauty."
The other, a Communist with whom
I was talking at home some time ago,
it is true, after one of my lectures on
the aesthetic education of young
people criticized me in the following
words:
"Why clutter up their heads with
that! The important thing is to foster
a revolutionary conscience in people, a
proper understanding of the laws of
social development, to teach them the
practical elements of social behaviour.
The rest, including the sense of beauty,
can come later."
I T is not my intention to
enter into a discussion of the factors
that have led to the great ethical and
spiritual flowering of the human per¬
sonality. I will simply say that in my
view the purpose of all education is to
give the individual the wherewithal
to find happiness suited to his nature
and to make his fellows happy.
As for the notion that our con¬
temporaries can be completely happy,
in the fullest sense of the term, that is
to say, appreciating all the wholesome
joys of life, without having had instill¬
ed in them a feeling for beauty that
is quite simply impossible. We are
speaking here of the education of a
human being completely and harmo¬
niously developed, able not only to
master knowledge but also to enjoy
beauty and to share it with others.
For this reason, when we seek to
achieve perfection as regards social
organization and the distribution of
material wealth, we must take great
care, earnestly and in good time, to
see that the future, does not merely
hold out the prospect of a high mat¬
erial standard of living and a fair
sharing of everything indispensable
for material comfort. We must see to
it that all society can participate in the
world of beauty, the aesthetic world,
the world of art. And this world must
be accessible to all. We must en¬
courage, foster and strengthen in each
of us the desire to seek and find real
beauty. And this cannot be achieved
with mediocre products or worthless
substitutes.
Why deny it: the man who lives in
material comfort but disdains the
world of art exhibitions, museums and
art galleries leads the life of blind
men. Little does he realize the joys
and beauty he is missing.
The man who is interested only in
the popular songs of the day, the
music of which, though catchy and
easily remembered, is nevertheless
extremely limited, is in fact half deaf.
For he has not learned to listen to and
appreciate really great music.
Again, the man who has never read
the great authors, the books which
have moved the hearts and minds of
millions of readers, if he has not
learnt by heart a dozen or so lines
of his favourite poet if indeed he has
one that man is condemned to
spiritual poverty, to live half-hearted¬
ly and to deprive himself of the greater
part of those joys which spring from
contact with beauty.
These contacts with beauty invite us
to improve our personality and to take
an active part in creating a life offering
joy, satisfaction and consolation. The
man who knows the meaning of beauty
can reap the reward that dreams afford
to help him to enjoy today and to face
tomorrow with serenity.
This is a far cry from the narrow
materialistic search for individual com¬
fort. It is a romantic quest, inviting us
to perfect our lives in all their pleni¬
tude. For the romantic approach is
the centrifugal force which propels
ideas and feelings beyond the horizons
of everyday existence; it is the dynamic
force which translates dreams into
reality.
During my visits to the United States
and Western Europe, I have been
confronted with most varied manifes¬
tations of modern art. These, I must
confess, have at times somewhat dis¬
concerted me. Perhaps because it is
an attempt to protect itself from the
invading cybernetics of our time, with
its yes-no and plus-minus responses,
that art sometimes seeks refuge in
the obscure realms of the subconscious
and even illogical artificiality.
B
UT years ago Tolstoy
wrote that the beautiful cannot be
devoid of meaning. Now that the
electronic computer is capable of
translating a book and even of writing
simple poetry, the artist, if he is a
true artist, cannot stand by with his
arms crossed and watch the human
factor disappear from the arts. On
the contrary, today more than ever,
art must reveal itself as in complete
possession of all potentialities of the
human spirit. The artist is the last
bastion of those great gifts of man
which can never be reproduced even
by the most complicated electronic
equipment. "I Q
At the same time it would be stupid **

exaggerated notions of a "superman"
which a certain press has popularized.
True art, inspired by truth and beauty,
exalts the splendours of the human
personality, and seeks to help man
to find his place in life and society,
rejecting both the myth of the "super¬
man" and of the "supersociety" which
too often crushes the individual under
implacable and inhuman laws.
Aesthetic education, of course, is
inseparable from ethical education.
Aesthetics and ethics should go hand
in hand, both in the private world of
the individual and in his relations with
others. This unity must be created in
infancy and must be talked about at
home in the family circle. The har¬
mony between the sense of the beauti¬
ful and the sense of right should be
reaffirmed, strengthened and develop¬
ed at school.
Unfortunately the time allotted to
teachers in the school curriculum for
initiating pupils in the realm of aesthe¬
tics above all in literatureis
not being used to best advantage.
More often than not the great
authors included in the Soviet curri¬
culum are not properly studied; they
are given only cursory examination.
The children in class simply reel off
in haphazard fashion the plots of clas¬
sical masterpieces or of the best-
known modern works.
IT is all too rare to find
a schoolmaster, himself an enthusiast
for his subject, who is able to commu¬
nicate his personal admiration and
attachment to his pupils so as to
awaken in them a genuine love of the
beautiful. Far more often the class
repeats with indifference conventional
views with no attempt to penetrate
the reaí deeper sense or truth of the
work. They make no attempt to find
pleasure in a new experience so that
under the spell of the author, they
realize that what they were being
taught was not boring and being
forced upon them. Yet there can
be no true education without educa¬
tion in ethics.
The Soviet Union has already achiev¬
ed a great deal in the field of aesthetic
education. We feel, however, that
there is still much urgent work to be
done. We have an Institute of Aesthe¬
tic Education attached to the Soviet
Academy of the Science of Teaching
where many aspects of the problems
I have mentioned are being studied
both scientifically and pedagogically.
Moscow has a Publishing House of
Children's Books specially created to
study the requirements of young
readers, to guide and develop the
tastes of children, and to assess and
set aesthetic standards for children's
books. We endeavour to ensure that
radio and television should be not
the rivals but the allies and sup¬
porters of literature, in a word, the
auxiliaries of all who are concerned
with the aesthetic development of the
rising generations.
The Soviet Union comprises a large
network of amateur artist groups to
which millions of children and adults
belong. There are popular theatres,
literary circles, and art studios. Even
so, we must admit that the general
level of artistic taste and aesthetic
appreciation lags far behind that of
general technical education in the
Soviet Union. In this field we still
have a long way to go.
Painters, scientists, writers, musi¬
cians and teachers should combine
their efforts to enable society not only
to expand the scope of its knowledge,
but also to make it possible for every¬
one to take the bold step of explor¬
ing the world of aesthetics and the
world of the beautiful.
From the infinitely great to the infinitely
tiny, science is enlarging the bounds
of the universe and those of life itself.
Simultanously it probes the mysteries of
space and those of the living cell and
in the process uncovers hitherto
imperceptible forms of beauty. Below, a
symbolic model of the molecule of DNA
(desoxyribonucleic acid). Science has
shown that these molecules are the
fundamental building blocks of heredity.

SCIENCE AND FUNDAMENTAL
CONCEPTS OF THINKING
by Paul Couderc
Winner of the 15th Kalinga Prize for the Popula¬
rization of Science, awarded by an international
jury appointed by Unesco, the French astronomer
and science writer Paul Couderc outlines, below,
his views on the need for impartiality in science,
and for regular science information to be avail¬
able to everyone.
O
«i
T
HE triumph of science
must ultimately engender peace by
endowing all mankind with better
means of livelihood, more leisure,
more culture and reasoning powers.
Progress put an end to the age of
the cave-dwellers; why should it not
put an end and the sooner the
better to the age of the barrack-
dwellers?
The time is not long past when
science was regarded as suspect and
frightening. Opprobrium was poured
on its ruthlessness, on the "cold-
hearted scientist" and his materialism,
which was equated, unfairly, with the
negation of any ideal (instead of being
contrasted with professions of so-
called idealism, as it properly should
be).
The "cold-hearted scientist" is one
of the myths most widely propagated
by the enemies of science and
PAUL COUDERC, astronomer at the Pans
Observatory and lecturer in astronomy at
the Ecole Polytechnique (Paris), has written
widely on cosmography and the structure
of the universe. Many of his books have
appeared in the "Que sais-je V collection
published by Presses Universitaires de
France (Paris), among them: "La Relativité"
(1966); "Les Eclipses" (1961); "L'Univers"
(published by Arrow Books, London, as
"The Wider Universe", 1960); "Le Calen¬
drier" (1961); "Histoire de l'Astronomie"
(1961) and "L'Astrologie" (1957).
especially by the zealots of spurious
science and occultism. It is obviously
easier to deceive the multitude when
one is dealing with those who "respect
the mystery at the heart of things",
who can be fobbed off with pure
verbalism and who confuse irrational
belief with reasonable knowledge.
This bane of scientific illiteracy may
perhaps have lost its hold; people
nowadays seem increasingly conscious
of the handicap of insufficient
scientific knowledge in the modern
age. Henceforth, science is a factor
of vital social importance. It offers
man the only chance of building a
better future and breaking his fetters;
it is the only means of assuring man
a longer, easier and happier life.
In our vindication of science, we
are not confusing material comfort
with happiness. The individual rarely
owes his happiness directly to the
pursuit of research. Moreover, the
seat of happiness is in the emotions
rather than the intellect the joys of
the family, moral satisfaction, deep-
felt emotions aroused by music,
poetry, literature, films or the theatre.
Scientists are no more beyond the
reach of feeling than other men, nor
do they wish to be.
But obviously, art and enjoyment
demand freedom and leisure. When
prehistoric man spent all his waking
hours protecting himself and finding
food, he hardly had time for meditation
or amusement: this explains the
extreme slowness of early progress,
contrasted with its remarkable speed
today.
Those who belittle scientific achieve¬
ments have forgotten the advances
made in medicine and surgery, the
alleviation of pain and sleeplessness.
The expectation of life has doubled in
fifty years, and life has become less
arduous.
Science moves so fast and has
become so vast and complex that the
man in the street can no longer fully
participate in the life of his time
without some intelligent popularization
of knowledge. Even the scientist
needs popularization in fields other
than his own.
Popularization aims to make the
march of science intelligible to the
layman, in simple, clear, direct and
if possible vivid, but above all accurate
terms. The attempt can never be
completely successful, for over¬
simplification always entails some
deformation; especially as the pro-
foundest scientific truths, in nuclear
physics or cosmology, for example,
are now becoming so abstruse that
there is great danger in deviating from
them even slightly. In any event, the
popular science writer must take care
not to slip into sensationalism or
triviality. The reader must be pre¬
pared to make an intellectual effort:
he must want to understand.
Furthermore, the new ideas and
images of the universe must infiltrate
education as soon as possible and
become part of every schoolboy's

stock in trade, to ensure that the gulf
is not too wide between ordinary
thinking and the mental processes of
the research scientist. We call the
properties or relationships we learnt
at an early age "self-evident".
If steps were taken to keep
education up-to-date, everyone would
start on the same intellectual footing
in each country, or very nearly so;
and some inter-communication would
be possible between the privileged few
who wrest from nature her secrets and
the multitude who can now do no more
than benefit from the applications of
science.
The people will become an in¬
exhaustible store of new research
workers, provided they are informed
and instructed in a scientific spirit, not
one of mystery, and are shown the
hallmarks of real scientific proof,
instead of the vain pretensions of
spurious science. From the ranks of
those still barred from the high schools
and universities by a selective social
system that is deplorable, many men
of science might emerge, and once in
a while a genius.
Think of the cases (only too rare)
where a brilliant mind has been
rescued, by some lucky chance, from
an occupation with no future. Think,
for example, of Faraday, the book¬
binder's workman, who fathered the
prodigy of the present day electrical
industry; think of Alexander Fleming,
the son of poor Scottish moorland
crofters, who worked for five years as
a clerk in a shipping company, until
a small legacy enabled him to take
up medicine; but for that legacy, we
should probably still be without
penicillin and the other antibiotics.
1 should like to illustrate by
the example of astronomy how the
evolution of science can change the
laws of human reasoning.
For primitive tribes the world is a
frightening place. They have an
affective conception of the universe:
they people heaven and earth with
higher powers, capricious and menac¬
ing, whom they must endeavour to
placate. Meteorology is confused
with astronomy, and there is no inkling
of natural law.
This was undoubtedly the world of
prehistoric man. But little by little,
the alternation of day and night, the
unvarying sequence of the phases of
the moon, the succession of the
seasons, provided the primitive peo¬
ples with time units, and led to the
notion of regular cycles in the
universe.
In the sixth century before our era,
in the Eastern Mediterranean, the earth
was identified as a celestial body,
spherical and surrounded by space,
from the observation of its shadow
on the moon in eclipse and from the
progressive change in the field of
stars visible to the traveller.
The idea of a single vertical
dimension, and the notion of up and
down, were gradually superseded by
the concept of an infinite number of
vertical dimensions converging towards
the centre of the earth, and the possi¬
bility of being able to stand upright
at the antipodes. What a revolution
in thought!
Similarly, the concrete reality of
darkness, with the antithesis of light
and dark, was superseded by the
notion of shadow. Only light is real;
darkness is merely the absence of
light. This vital step forward was
also due to an understanding of the
eclipses and the phases of the moon.
N
EXT, the attempts of the
Greeks to account for the movements
of the planets geometrically mark the
final advent of scientific rationalism:
from then on, it is assumed that any
natural phenomenon can be explained;
the concept of natural law carries all
before it, ousting the supernatural and
fantastic. Mystical needs still have
their place, but as a thing apart, hardly
impinging on science.
Fifteen centuries later, Copernicus
and Galileo supplied the proof that
the earth is not the centre of the
universe. This changed the whole
face of philosophy; the inhabitant of a
modest planet revolving round the sun
cannot think along the same lines as
a privileged denizen of the centre of
the universe. A study of our galaxy
now shows the sun to be a star in
the suburbs of a multitude of hundreds
of thousands of millions of other stars
like it: and the giant telescopes
reveal that the universe is filled with
thousands of millions of galaxies
similar to our own.
Lastly, these galaxies are running
away from each other in an expanding
universe, where space itself is not
only curved but dilating. What, then,
is space? Matter? Gravitation? At
this very time, these questions are
moving from the metaphysical to the
scientific plane. Thus, science again
appears as the "power behind the
throne" in our philosophy, returning
the fundamental concepts of our
thinking to the melting-pot.
Astronomy is still in the forefront
of the natural sciences, and the most
abstract ideas are invoked in contenr-
porary cosmology. At the same time,
allying as it does the beauty of the
stars and the poetry of the heavens
to infinite scales of time and space,
it remains a particularly apt medium
for bringing the conquests of modern
science within the grasp of the general
public.

make full use of the waters of the lower
Mekong in terms of hydro-electric power,
irrigation, flood control, drainage, navigation
improvement, water management and water
supply. Map left, shows location of some
of the Mekong projects in Thailand, Laos,

Unesco has produced a Mathematical Model of
the Mekong Delta which has already played
a major role in proving the feasibility of
building a barrage across the Tonle Sap
River (Cambodia) and will be used to study
other projects. Above, a boat race along

make their largest catches as
the annual flood waters recede

Improvised markets are set up
on the river banks to which
the rice farmers, travelling
from far afield, bring their
grain to exchange for fish.

benefit from the river or to control
its many and unpredictable idiosyncra¬

The Mekong has an annual cycle,
with a dry season from November to
June and then a regular flood which
usually reaches a single peak.
When the floods come, over 15,000
square miles (38,000 sq. kms.) in Cam¬

are inundated. Herein lies the major
problem, that of introducing some
control over this yearly phenomenon.
One of the special features of the
flooding is that by the time the
enormous volume of water reaches
Phnom Penh, the capital of Cambodia,
sometimes reaching a height of thirty
feet, the head developed by the
Mekong is sufficient to reverse the
flow of one of its principal tributaries,
the Tonle Sap. This river flows back¬
wards into the Great Lake of Cam¬

around the vicissitudes of the mon¬

ries they have learned after a fashion
to adapt their way of life and their
livelihood to these difficult conditions.
It has therefore been necessary to
bear well in mind that any develop¬
ment plans call for careful co-ordi
nation of all factors concerned and to
ensure that what is planned will not
disrupt the present economy and the
whole ecology of the region. Since
rice and fish constitute the daily diet
of such a large proportion of the
population, even a brief interruption of
supplies could have serious conse¬
quences.
Of all the projects considered or
planned for the Mekong the most pro¬
mising and most complicated one is
the Tonle Sap project. Here, it is
proposed to build a great barrage, and
planning for it has called for the deve¬
lopment by Unesco of a mathematical
model.
Over the past seven years Unesco
and the United Nations Development
Programme (UNDP) have been engag¬
ed on this highly sophisticated research
project the creation of a theoretical
model in the form of a computer and
programme of the Mekong River Delta,
as distinct from a physical model
which is built to scale and which is
usually used for the study of hydro-
logical problems of this sort. In the
present instance the term Mathema¬
tical Model is used by the specialists
and it has been made possible by the
use of an electronic computer.
While this model has made a special
contribution to basic studies of a
number of development projects being
undertaken in the Mekong Flood Plain,
it has also led to fundamental scientific
advances in the field of hydrology and
hydraulics.
This project is an example of Inter¬
national scientific collaboration at its
best. Born out of a spirit of co-opera¬
tion between the United Nations and
the four countries, Cambodia, Laos,
Thailand and the Republic of Viet-
Nam, which are most closely concern¬
ed with the Mekong, the new techni¬
ques developed will serve other states
far distant from South-East Asia. For
example, the study of many of the
flood problems of Italy may well be
assisted by the application of the
scientific knowledge resulting from
the Mekong studies, and thus a re¬
currence of the enormous damage
caused by the devastating floods of
1966 may be prevented.
D URING recent years the
experience of many has been sought
out to see how the Mekong as a vast
natural resource might be turned to
greater use and thus contribute to an
improvement in the economic situation
of the population of the great flood
plain.
The Lower Basin of the Mekong
River comprises approximately one
third of the total territory of Cambo¬
dia, Laos, Thailand and the Repub¬
lic of Viet-Nam, and within it live
20 million people. Eighty per cent of
them are farmers and fishermen and
all are dependent on the river.
Less than 3 per cent of the basin is
irrigated; much more of it could be
and will be under the development
plans. Only 86 per cent of the culti¬
vated land is under rice, and only one
crop a year is grown, but this could
be increased to three. With electric
power becoming available it will be
possible to produce nitrogenous ferti¬
lizer. Furthermore, large abandoned
areas like the Plaine des Joncs could

well be brought under cultivation if
they were desalinated.
The advent of power could also
make it possible to work the iron ore,
bauxite, copper, tungsten and zinc
which are found in the area, and to set
up new industries. These will call
for increased educational and exten¬
sion programmes for the people to
enable them to understand the new
development, to acquire new skills
and to adapt the existing social and
commercial structures.
The fishing industry, about 90 per
cent of it fresh-water, is extensive and
important, with the Great Lake pro¬
ducing about 50,000 tons per year.
But this production is very variable
and it is foreseen that if the proposed
barrage on the Tonle Sap could be
regulated the fish production might be
more balanced.
Whatever might be the sum total
of benefits from a barrage on the
Tonle Sap it is clear that there would
result a tremendous reduction in the
loss of lives and property. For exam¬
ple, in the 1961 flood, 164 lives were
lost and a population of over 300,000
affected; untold damage was done to
buildings, roads and bridges.
The problems of the Lower Mekong
Basin can only be solved as a whole:
there is need for a joint effort, but
not even the four countries involved
could assemble anything like the ne¬
cessary technical and material resour¬
ces required to carry through a pro¬
ject of this magnitude. This then was
a real project for study and assistance
by the United Nations.
In 1951, the Economic Commission
for Asia and the Far East (ECAFE)
established by the United Nations Eco¬
nomic and Social Council in 1947 took
up the study of the Lower Mekong.
The technical work was undertaken
by the Bureau of Flood Control and
Water Resources Development, a sub¬
sidiary body of ECAFE which is em¬
powered, among other things, to advise
and assist governments on flood con¬
trol and related river problems. The
first study, published early in 1952,
aroused keen interest and brought
forth favourable response.
I N 1957, a United Nations
mission planned a five-year program¬
me of surveys with a budget of $9 mil¬
lion. The first recommendation, which
received early approval of the United
Nations, was the creation of a local
authority to draw up a master plan
and to ensure proper co-ordination of
resources.
Thus was established the Committee
for Co-ordination of Investigations of
the Lower Mekong Basin, which is
composed of plenipotentiaries from
the four riparian states of Cambodia,
Laos, "Thailand and the Republic of
Viet-Nam. It is empowered to control
supervise and co-ordinate develop¬
ment projects. To handle the vital day
to day work between sessions of the
committee an executive agent was
appointed and, to assist him, a three-
member consultative committee. This
small operational body puts into effect
decisions taken by the Committee for
Co-ordination.
Pilot projects have been started,
and are well under way in each of
the four states. These are the four
Mekong United Nations Special Fund
tributary projects:
The Battambang Project in Cambo¬
dia envisages a diversion dam. But,
since the river is almost dry during
April and May, round-the-year irriga¬
tion cannot be ensured simply by pro¬
viding such a diversion dam. It is
proposed to solve this problem by
building an upstream storage dam and
reservoir, which should provide gra¬
vity irrigation for 150,000 acres. In
addition it is planned to generate
110 million KWh of electricity per year.
The Nam Ngum Project in Laos is
to provide irrigation for farming on
about 100,000 acres and will produce
about 520 million KWh of electricity
per year.
In Thailand the Nam Pong project
located in the north makes provision
for pumping and irrigation to about
95,000 acres and provides for the
drainage of soil which is sandy and
often very salty. It will also produce
some 90 million KWh. of electricity.
Finally, the Upper Se San Project
located in the plateau area of the
Republic of Viet-Nam is designed to
develop a large area for resettlement.
The project will provide gravity irriga¬
tion for some 25,000 acres down¬
stream and, by pumping and upstream
diversion, for an additional 35,000
acres. The production of 220 million
KWh. of electricity is planned.
These then constitute the four
UNDP Special Fund Component pro¬
jects which aim to irrigate slightly more n-i
than 400,000 acres; and additional tri- / I
butary projects will doubtless be built.

The delta in the computer
are under way and are being assisted
under bilateral aid and the Colombo
Plan. (The British Commonwealth's
scheme for aiding its member coun¬
tries in South-East Asia.) Five of these
projects envisage providing irrigation
to an area of nearly 6 million acres
and an annual electricity output of
about 25,000 million KWh.
The Tonle Sap and Delta project is
one of especial interest to Unesco as
the organization entrusted by UNDP
with the making of the mathematical
model of the Delta.
Quite apart from these large-scale
land and water development projects
other work is in progress undertaken
by the four riparian governments
which are receiving bilateral assis¬
tance as well as aid from the United
Nations and other international agen¬
cies.

OR example the U.N. is
carrying out a survey of minerals and
the mineral processing industries in
the Mekong Basin. In agriculture, the
Food and Agriculture Organization
(FAO) is helping with the development
of a 740-acre experimental irrigation
and demonstration farm in the Vietiane
Plain, under the Special Fund Compo¬
nent Tributaries Project. FAO is also
assisting by directing the design of
a number of agriculture stations.
Because of great losses from forest
and grassland fires caused by shifting
cultivation, FAO is investigating ways
which may be used to restrain this
practice. Schistosomiasis (a disease
caused when the bloodstream is in¬
vaded by tiny parasites) and malaria
surveys have been carried out by the
World Health Organization, and pre¬
ventive measures suggested.
At the request of the Co-ordination
Committee, the International Labour
Organization has completed a prelimi¬
nary manpower survey of the Mekong
Basin.
The change of flow of the Tonle Sap
caused by the swelling of the Mekong
at flood time has already been men¬
tioned. This constitutes a major hy-
drological and hydraulic problem, and
a detailed scientific study was consi¬
dered to be fundamental to any plan
for building a barrage on the Tonle
Sap and indeed basic to most of the
projects envisaged for the whole
Lower Mekong Basin.
Having in mind the need for a
thorough basic study, Unesco consti
tuted a three-man mission to visit the
area and to look into the idea of
constructing a suitable hydrological
model.
Studies of hydraulic problems are
usually carried out by using a physical
scale model, but in this case the rela¬
tions between surface distances and
gradients were of an order that made
it almost impossible to reproduce such
small slopes in a model.
Such a model would have requir¬
ed an area of almost one hectare
(2è acres) with levels accurate to
1/10 mm. This important considera¬
tion, among others, led the Unesco
Mission to propose the development
of a mathematical model, to be pre¬
pared by using an electronic com¬
puter.
Accordingly, the Committee for Co¬
ordination, on behalf of the Govern¬
ments of Cambodia and the Repub¬
lic of Viet-Nam asked the UNDP
Special Fund Component for help in
building up a mathematical model of
the Delta. The project was approved
and in May 1961 the Governing Council
of the Special Fund entrusted Unesco
with the responsibility for building the
model.
The mission contemplated the build¬
ing of a model for two major reasons.
Firstly, they considered it necessary to
resolve the controversy existing be¬
tween experts about the total effect
of building the dam and also to prepare
a design that would provide the most
efficient control. Secondly they felt
it was vital to demonstrate clearly that
a dam built in Cambodia would not
in any circumstances adversely affect
the lower part of the Delta in the
Republic of Viet-Nam.
A T the time of the mission's
work a physical model had already
been ruled out. A new approach was
being made and new developments
were taking place which eventually
made it clear that a mathematical
model was more suited to the investi¬
gation. That the decision to use a
mathematical model was taken at a
time when the technique had not yet
been fully developed can be consi¬
dered as an important contribution to
fundamental hydraulic studies.
Very careful planning was required
in preparation for the model. First a
panel of consultants was appointed
three hydraulics experts and two
mathematicians who contributed the
expert knowledge and experience of
the four different countries from which
they came. Then a suitable laboratory
had to be found to undertake the
construction of the model. The one
selected, SOGREAHthe Société Gre¬
nobloise d'Etudes et d'Applications
Hydrauliques in Grenoble, France,
had had years of experience of
research in this field.
T HE model project was
planned to cover four phases:
The collection of all existing docu¬
mentation and data on the hydraulics
of the region;
The designing and programming
of a preliminary model on the basis
of these results which could determine
the possible deficiencies of the
eventual model;
A measurement campaign plan¬
ned on the basis of the preliminary
model, which would check the cri¬
tical data needed for improving the
accuracy of this model in preparation
for the final stage;
The construction of the eventual
model, in the form of a computer
programme accurately representing
the seasonal variations in water levels
and discharge rates.
In phase two, trial runs were made
to determine how faithfully the pre¬
liminary model reflected the natural
phenomena. The main purpose was
to determine which factors (discharge
rates and levels at particular points
for instance), were critical for the
operation of the model, adjustments
being possible to make it more
accurate.
Essentially the computer programme
constituting the Mathematical Model
involves the introduction of detailed
hydraulic data (topographic features,
water levels and discharge volumes
etc.) into an electronic computer in
the form of formulae embodying well
known physical laws. The computer
then determines the water levels and
their rates of variation at the points
and times of special interest in the
Delta plain.
The test area concerning the Tonle
Sap was divided up into more than
260 meshes covering dry land,
water or marsh from which the
natural phenomena could be faithfully
reproduced by definition of the
exchanges between them and the
average water levels in each of them.
Each mesh entailed a great number of
accurate and painstaking measure-

With the latest advances in technology it
is foreseen that in the next 10 years our
TV screens will be able to receive world-wide
programmes via satellite relays. The real
problem today is not so much the need for
more perfected satellites as better plans for
using them for a vast exchange of educa¬
tional, scientific and cultural programmes.
Professor W. Schramm, a world authority on
mass media development, here looks at a
few of the major problems that call for
solution before the intercontinental exchange
of news and cultural programmes can become
a day-to-day occurence.
T
HE opportunity now exists
to share data over long distances as
never before in the history of mankind.
The development of computers of great
capacity has made it possible to store
enormous quantities of information in
digital form, and to search efficiently
for and retrieve any part of what is
stored. The development of related
arts and sciences of indexing, abstract¬
ing and programming has brought into
being a new force in human affairs
information science.
Fortunately for us, these develop¬
ments come at a time when many of
the natural sciences are experiencing

a glut of research information, when
information of great importance to
scientists is being produced at many
and distant places on earth, and when
rising educational levels and expanding
scholarships are creating new needs
for information world wide.
In this race between information
needs and new information capabilities,
communication satellites will play a
facilitating role, and probably an impor¬
tant one.
Indeed, some space scientists have
predicted that communication satellites
may be used more for data than for
telephone transmission. Their function
will be to extend the connexion bet¬
ween data sources and user.
Already computers have been con¬
nected to other computers or to data
consoles, over thousands of miles, by
means of land lines. They can also
be connected by satellite.
Weather data have been exchanged,
' by words, numbers and pictures, over
almost all the world, by satellite. Tele¬
metry and even television from satel¬
lites have been received on earth
from many hundreds of thousands of
miles away in space. Can we now
adapt these proved capabilities to the
needs of scientific and educational
information?
Men have dreamed of a new age of
information. Great data banks, estab¬
lished centrally, would be available
to the most distant users. Scientists
in developing countries or at isolated
locations would have as ready access
to scientific research as would their
colleagues in the great centres. A
sick man in a distant location could
count on the help of a great medical
centre. There would no longer be a
stultifying lag between new knowledge
and its dissemination. New findings in
medicine, for example, would be
promptly available to clinics and hos¬
pitals and medical schools everywhere.
The resources of a small town or
school library would no longer be a
few hundred or a few thousand volu¬
mes; there would be available by quick
data transmission, when needed, the
enormous resources of such great
information centres as the Library of
Congress, the British Museum, or the
Lenin Library.
National, and ultimately international,
information systems would come to be
realities, and computerized indexing
and cataloguing would take much of
the drudgery out of working with them.
Let us not mistake the dream for
present reality: we are far from being
able to make that kind of dream come
true. But we can already do remark¬
able things in using computers for
information storage and retrieval, and
it is safe to say that whatever we can
store on a computer we can transmit
and retrieve at the end of a satellite
circuit.
Present needs, as we move toward
full use of satellites for scientific and
educational data transmission, are to
establish the demand for such data,
the locations where it exists, the forms
in which it must be packaged in order
to be useful, and the institutions and
organizations which must come into
being in order to collect and dissemi¬
nate it. This is planning of a high order
which must involve many sectors of
the academic community and the infor¬
mation professions.
International data exchange will
require building up national capabi¬
lities for information exchange.
How can an organization like Unesco
best contribute to this growth toward
international data exchange, in which

A talk on Greek poetry in the
television series, "The Sense of
Poetry," produced by the
educational TV station in Boston
(U.S.A.). With the use of
communication satellites, completely
new possibilities are open to
educational radio and television in
every country and notably in the
vast areas covered by the
developing countries.
communication satellites will play a
considerable part?
It seems that the greatest contri¬
butions might come: (a) by helping to
share with the smaller and newer
countries what is being found out about
information technology and dissemi¬
nation, and (b) by facilitating in every
way possible the planning for truly
international data systems. The joint
International Council of Scientific
Unions (ICSU)-Unesco Project on the
Communication of Scientific Informa¬
tion and the Feasibility of a World
Science Information System is an
important step toward meeting these
objectives.
The central committee designed to
supervise the ICSU-Unesco Project
could serve as the nucleus of a com¬
mission or advisory group on infor¬
mation exchange.
International information exchange
will become a very large activity. It
may be that a new United Nations
Specialized Agency or bureau will have
to be organized to handle it.
Communication satellites offer an
opportunity to increase and even out
the flow of news in the world. It has
been amply demonstrated that news
flow falls off markedly with distance
(geographical or psychological) and
that the flow is overwhelmingly from
the more developed countries to the
less developed ones.
Experience has shown that whenever
cables have been extended to a
country there has been a notable
improvement in both the speed and
quantity of news available to readers
and listeners in that country. There¬
fore, there is reason to believe that
satellites can potentially make a real
difference in news availability through¬
out the world.
In theory at least, this should occur
at each stage of satellite development.
In the relatively distant years of direct
broadcasting we may be able to look
forward to facsimile newspapers broad¬
cast directly into the home, and
perhaps even to some choice as to
what part of the news one wants to
have printed on his facsimile machine.
That stage of development should
also make a difference m the kinds
of news organizations that serve
the home. For example, international
newspapers could become a reality,
and in very large countries national
newspapers could circulate much more
easily than now.
There might be a merger of some
newspapers and broadcasting news
units into a broader kind of news ser¬
vice, combining the sense of receiving
"instant news" that television offers
with the greater depth possible in print
and facsimile
Much of the effect on news trans¬
mission may be felt even at the early
stages when most satellite communi¬
cation is point-to-point.
One of the characteristics of satel¬
lite communication is that the use of
the space link should cost about the
same regardless of the distance the
message travels, providing that it is
within the satellite's effective coverage
area. This area can be as large as
40 per cent of the earth's surface.
This suggests the attractive idea that
perhaps something like a flat rate (or
an almost flat rate) for news, regard¬
less of distance, might be established
world wide thanks to the peculiar eco¬
nomic qualities of satellite transmis¬
sion. If this were possible, it would
help to even out the flow, and thus
help to equalize the chance for one part
of the world to know about others.
Similarly, satellites will sooner or
later offer a chance to develop reliable
teletype news service by radio to parts
of the world where radio reception is
not now reliable. They also offer an
invitation to experiment with facsimile,
a method which has been improved
and used for the transmission of
numerous kinds of pictural material,
including newspaper pages for offset
reproduction. Satellites extend these
capabilities farther and invite the news
media to review the question of what
news functions might in the future be
carried on by facsimile.
F OR television news, point-
to-point satellites offer an opportunity
to transmit news films and sound
tracks more quickly and probably more
cheaply. One major American net¬
work has announced that it plans
to establish "self-contained news
bureaux. . . complete with equipment
and production crews for transmitting
fully prepared stories" around the
"main gateways for satellite commu¬
nication" meaning chiefly the country
with ground stations.
The international news agencies and
many national press associations are
well aware of the potential of satel¬
lites for news transmissions, and ten
of these organizations have formed a
joint committee, with a secretariat, in
London.
One of the keenest observers of
the press has suggested that a joint
advisory board should be formed, in¬
cluding the committee just mentioned,
the International Telecommunications
Union, the Communications Satellite
Corporation, other organizations that
may be responsible for launching com¬
munication satellites, and Unesco.
This board, he suggests, should be
responsible for examining all means
by which the world flow of news could
be improved through developments in
space communication.
The contribution of Unesco to bring¬
ing satellites into use to assist the
flow of world news might take the form
of calling together such a group as
this, representing as broad as pos¬
sible a spectrum of news media, news
agencies, and space communication,
at first on a one-time basis, later on
a continuing basis if that proved
desirable.

It is reasonable to assume that most
cultural exchange via satellites will be
in the form of television, and that as
long as we have only point-to-point
satellites there will not be much of
it. Most programmes, except spot
news, sporting events of wide in¬
terest, or great historical events can
be exchanged just as appropriately on
films or videotape carried by jet aero¬
plane, as by satellite.
In fact many cultural programmes,
such as opera, ballet and drama, are
relatively timeless, and can be trans¬
mitted by almost any means. A com¬
plicating factor, however, is that if it
proves impossible to negotiate for
other than live transmission of certain
art and entertainment events (for
example some music festivals), an ex¬
change by films or videotape might
not be feasible.
Yet the televising 'of great events
by satellite, the occasional live pro¬
gramme (for example, the "Our World"
programme seen in Europe, North
America, Mexico, Tunisia, Australia
and Japan on June 25, 1967, and the
sporadic "Town Meeting of the Air"
programmes of discussion between
Europe and America), along with the
increasing amount of travel in the
world, are building appetites for
foreign television, and if satellite
charges continue to decrease we may
expect to see more foreign television
via satellite.
There may be still more of it when
distribution satellites come in, and
offer the opportunity to use evening
hours on an educational satellite for
general programming. But the real
impact of satellite culture exchange
will come, if at all, when direct broad¬
casting satellites are operative.
We can only speculate now as to
what these will do to television ser¬
vices. The opportunity will be there
for international television, if the bar¬
riers and objections to it can be over¬
come. It is not beyond belief that,
twenty years from now, television from
several continents, along with a fac¬
simile newspaper, might be readily
available in any home where there is
a receiver..
Satellite programmers will know less
and less about their audiences and
may be forced into more and more
innocuous programming in order to
meet a wide variety of tastes and
avoid offending a wide variety of sen¬
sitivities.
Furthermore, satellite broadcasting
over a very wide range is certain to
come up against the problems of na¬
tional sovereignty and national cultural
sensitivity. What is a documentary to
one country may be propaganda to
another country. What is great lite¬
rature to one country may be offensive
to another. What is history to one
country may be provocative to another.
Even what is education to one
country may be contrary to the norms
and beliefs of another. In any wide-
area satellite broadcasting there is

Performer s rights in the era of satellites
likelihood of unintentional overlap of
coverage areas, as well as opportuni¬
ties for intentional propaganda to other
countries.
Along with this, consider the pecu¬
liar vulnerability of a satellite to hos¬
tile action. It is relatively easy to jam
the communication link to the instru¬
ment, and in some cases even to take
it over at times for one's own mes¬
sages. It is also within easy possi¬
bility to break the signal code by which
the satellite is turned on or off, or
by which the jets are operated to keep
it in position.
Therefore, it is conceivable that a
nation offended by a satellite's trans¬
mission might simply turn on the jets
to move the satellite out of orbit and
destroy it. It is clear that the world
can hardly enter into this direct broad¬
cast stage of cultural exchange until
the institutions and patterns of co¬
operation, the mutually agreeable
codes" of programme conduct, and the
arrangements for control of programme
content and redress of grievances, are
all carefully prepared.
Every public communication system
requires controlling patterns and ins¬
titutions so that its uses and content
will be consonant with the norms of
the society it serves. It is precisely
because different nations of the world
have different norms regarding free¬
dom of information that satellite com¬
munication represents a difficult con¬
trol problem.
I
28
HE more international com¬
munication the satellites carry, the more
necessary it will become to surround
the satellite system with a pattern of
law and orderliness and some institu¬
tional arrangements to manage the
control problems. If these arrange¬
ments are not in working order by the
time we are ready to begin direct
broadcasting from satellites, then we
shall face a very dangerous situation.
Point-to-point communication by sat¬
ellite is unlikely to challenge national
sovereignty, and domestic legislation
will provide recourse for individuals or
organizations who consider themselves
to be injured by satellite transmissions.
Some problems may arise from dif¬
fering national legislation on libel and
breach of privacy, and the rights of
performers may have to be redefined
or reconsidered on an international
basis if their performances are made
public in a number of distant countries.
At present these international arran¬
gements are typically made by the
broadcasting organizations of the na¬
tions involved. The more countries
involved, however, the more attractive
some broad, general arrangements will
come to seem'. Copyright, too, may
present some problems.
The closer we move toward direct
broadcasting, the more imperative it
will become to approach on an inter¬
national basis the problem of prevent¬
ing abuses of the new capability for
international communication, h is pre¬
dictable that efforts to establish an
international legal system for infor¬
mation will be resumed, at or near the
point where they were carried by the
1948 Geneva Conference. Some ins¬
titutional arrangements to carry out
control agreements will doubtless be
required.
Space law seems to be evolving
within long-accepted outlines of inter¬
national law. At the time of the Inter¬
national Geophysical Year, all nations
agreed by common consent to an evo¬
lutionary step of such importance that
it might be considered a part of the
"common law of mankind": that outer
space may be used for peaceful and
scientific purposes without restrictions
based on terrestrial sovereignty.
A second principle, the basic right
of a nation to defend itself from attack,
whether from the ground or from outer
space, is embodied in Article 51 of the
Charter of the United Nations. It
points to the obvious need of defin¬
ing what in the field of information
constitutes an "attack", and providing
controls and opportunity for redress.
A third principle is that of order¬
liness in space, illustrated by the in¬
ternational agreements already arrived
at for use of the radio spectrum which,
like space itself, is conceived as the
common property of mankind. It is
desirable now to devote major atten¬
tion to defining these developing norms
in practical terms.
But a professional code typically
requires a professional body to admi¬
nister it. A set of rules or regulations,
or a body of law, is of little value with¬
out enforcement and administration.
Therefore, it is necessary to consider
the kinds of international institutions
and arrangements that would be re¬
quired to maintain a rule of law and
order in space broadcasting.
The developing situation being what
it is, this institution should be designed
not only to administer an existing code,
but also to meet a series of unfore¬
seen problems and challenges as hu¬
man experience in space unfolds.
How can we begin to move toward
the goal of very wide exchange, even
where the pattern does not now exist?
The European Broadcasting Union has
its own exchange organization, Euro-
vision, and the nations of East Europe
have a parallel to it, Intervision.
One reason why the prospect of a
distribution satellite is so attractive in
Europe is that a firm basis already
exists 'there for the exchange of pro¬
grammes. There is also provision in
the Far East. No such regional ex¬
change organizations exist, however,
in Africa or the Americas.
In this problem, as in others we have
talked about, there is much to be done
on the ground before we leap into
space. Perhaps, the first step should
be to encourage mtercultural co-opera¬
tion among broadcasters, as it has
been encouraged in Europe, quite apart
from any consideration of space links
for this exchange.
A T the same time it would be
useful to try to understand some of the
problems involved in such co-operation,
and how they may be overcome.
Unesco has begun to collect some
of the experiences of regional
organizations with exchange of
programmes. This is a sound and
practical step and should furnish some
guidance both for new regional
organizations, and for co-operative
efforts on a world-wide scale.
The Chairman of the Board of the
National Broadcasting Company (Uni¬
ted States) has advocated a world-wide
association of broadcasters. Nothing
less than that, he says, "can provide
a wholly effective nerve centre to
serve emerging needs rising from tele¬
vision's rapid global growth. These
include the need, not only for a cen¬
tral file of programmes available for
purchase or exchange, but for a clear¬
ing house to deal with such factors as
time differentials, copyrights, union
arrangements, scheduling clearances
and simultaneous translation."
It is apparent that much international
exchange of cultural programmes can
and will take place without the use
of satellites, and therefore if regional
and then world-wide exchange can be
facihted in general a certain part of
the practice will merge into exchange
by satellite.
This would then be a step toward
meeting the problems of direct broad¬
casting by satellite. At least, the habit
of co-operation would be set up, and
various forms of it for example, the
joint planning and production of a
programme would be tried out. Such
difficult problems as performer's rights
and copyright would be aired.
Problems like these might be the

next areas where Unesco or other
appropriate organizations could help
pave the way toward direct broad¬
casting of cultural programmes by sat¬
ellite. The question of copyright, as
affected by satellite transmission,
needs to be studied.
The Buenos Aires round table of
1964 on Legal Systems Governing Sat¬
ellite Communications, as reported by
Armando Cocea, concluded that an
extension of the present copyright
convention would provide adequate
protection.
The rights of performers will present
more complex and difficult problems
in the satellite age, and the Berne
Convention, as revised at Rome in
1961 and at Stockholm in 1967, clearly
needs re-examination. When it is
decided what modifications, extensions,
or replacements of these agreements
are desirable, then new instruments,
if needed, might be drafted by the
appropriate parties and brought to the
attention of governments.
Studies and possible agreements of
these kinds would be easier than the
ultimate problems of control and orga¬
nization which must be met before
direct broadcasting becomes a reality.
Yet at the appropriate time these too
can be faced. Whether the problem
of freedom and control, as applied
to space broadcasting, is taken up as
an extension of the 1948 United Na¬
tions sessions, or otherwise, it would
be desirable to stimulate preparatory
dialogue.
Practising broadcasters and inter¬
national legal scholars believe that a
high degree of co-operation, tolerance
and restraint, along with suitable agree¬
ments and administrative machinery,
will be required if direct broadcasting
from satellites is ever to be anything
other than a piece of science fiction
or a non-fictional fiasco. The reason
for approaching these problems today
is that they will certainly be far worse
tomorrow.

A prize-winning essay from Uruguay
THE WORLD
WE HOPE FOR
by Maria Cristina Costa Diaz
B
30
Y "The world we hope for"
I mean the world hoped for not only
by the present generation to which I
belong, but by future generations.
Aspirations to a better world cannot
be fulfilled in a single life-span, which
is but a moment in the immensity of
time.
The world we hope for, then, should
bring:
Lasting peace: no more wars bet¬
ween nations or groups of nations; no
expansionist countries using their su¬
perior material, military or economic
strength to abuse or violate the rights
of weaker countries; an end to the
causes of strife within nations; no
endless class struggles; international
relations governed by clear, just prin¬
ciples which always respect the peo¬
ple's rights; a lasting peace, free from
fear and oppression.
Concord and solidarity among all
men: no infuriating disparity between
those who make millions and those
who have not even enough to feed
their families properly. The sight for
ever banished of the destitute begging
for charity in the streets, when what
they need, as our equals in rights, is
work, a chance to improve their lot and
to restore their confidence and faith in
themselves. To be spared the sight of
ragged children selling band-aids, tran¬
quilizers and matches in public buses,
when their parents should be the ones
to work; and to be rid of the selfish
and miserly whose very existence
means that many of their fellow-beings
go hungry. The benefits would be
universal if men acted upon feelings
of friendship and mutual respect,
instead of merely paying lip-service to
them!
The spread of education and know¬
ledge throughout every continent so
that the light of learning may disperse
the shadows of illiteracy. Education
made available to all an education
no longer theoretical and largely di¬
vorced from life; all the cultural
resources of society at the service of
of the whole community.
The aim of teaching and education
to be a training for life, providing
instruction rooted in life itself and in
the fundamental problems of the day.
To this end, industrial and agricultural
education should be developed and
intensified, as should scientific and
technological research. In other
words, the aim should not be to
make (or rather deform) to measure
persons whose professional skills
serve merely to plead the cause of
privilege and to uphold the privileged;
on the contrary, professional training
should be dedicated to the service of
society as a whole.
The printed word is the most power¬
ful instrument of man's development:
it satisfies the infinite thirst for know¬
ledge and is unmatched as a medium
of intellectual communication; it main¬
tains the continuity of history and
culture, the common heritage, animat¬
ing force and living essence of a
people, which it behoves us all,
as cells of the social organism, to
conserve, defend and cherish. Books
train and cultivate the mind. All men
must be educated and taught their
civic rights and duties so as to enjoy
a real freedom of decision, without the
risk of being cheated or defrauded in
their aspirations.
Study as a corner-stone of life, so
that when literacy becomes universal,
everyone may find opportunities of
applying, in their community and
especially in their work, all they have
learned.
The promotion of science and tech¬
nology, symbolic of the present and
the future, to enable man to explore
infinite space, and allow human intelli¬
gence to penetrate far and deep in
its insatiable thirst for knowledge.
The Uruguayan scientist, Clemente
Estable, addressing the Uruguayan
Chamber of Representatives, which
held a session in his honour on Octo¬
ber 3, 1960, declared : "In our time,
when even astronomy has become,
amazingly, an experimental science,
with artificial satellites and planetoids,
scientific research is an absolute and
imperative necessity, and any invest¬
ment in such research is of great
significance for democracy."
The paths of science and technology
lead to the realm of energy, light and
speed. A stimulus must be given to
all speculative pure or applied thought
(in philosophy or the sciences) and to
every concrete expression of the
concept of beauty (in the realm of the
arts, whether sculpture or painting,
music or literature.) The essential
aim is to enhance the meaning of life
through art, and thus hallow the
triumph of spiritual over material
things.
Increased production, and the abun¬
dance that will result from compulsory
work, whose effects will be chiefly
felt in the productive sectors; by
planning and rationalization of produc¬
tion; by the contribution of techno¬
logy; by economic development. All
this should make for abundance;
enough food for all, an end to malnu¬
trition; lower death rates; prevention
and eradication of sickness; the gua¬
rantee of a better life for future gen¬
erations; a fair distribution of the
national income.
The concept of work as a law of
life, in accordance with the following
principles: compulsion to work for all
the mentally and physically fit; a nor¬
mal work day to satisfy not only the
needs but the reasonable and legiti¬
mate desires of all; elimination of
social parasites so that each can and
must live by his own resources, not by
the effort and sacrifice of others.

A regular programme on Uruguayan television,

themes from the "Unesco Courier". Last year,

and re-education from the social, psy¬
chological, moral, individual and pro¬
fessional viewpoints. Creation of eco¬
nomic and social conditions which will
do away with the socio-economic roots
of crime. Penal laws with humane and
social aims that concord with the
most progressive recommendations
adopted by specialists at international
congresses, always bearing in mind
that a prison should not be a place of
torment and retribution, but of re-edu¬
cation, rehabilitation and work. And
measures should be taken to prevent
criminals from buying immunity from
the law through influence.
Proper housing for all. The "right
to a roof" is a primary, elementary and
essentiel right which must be guaran¬
teed by the State. It is one way
of giving self-respect to the citizen
and promoting a better standard of
living.
An end to man's exploitation by man,
that appalling evil which still persists
in various hidden forms: all men to be
of equal standing, with neither exploi¬
ters nor exploited; work as a social
force used to further the general in¬
terest, creating wealth for all; the
fashioning of a new mentality, taking
for granted that man should be the
brother and friend of man, not his
plunderer, and that everyone should
support and help his neighbour.
Strong feelings of solidarity, dead¬
ened under the present competitive
system, would be aroused, and "all
for each and each for all" would
acquire real meaning as a principle
of work, with a full, human, fraternal
relationship uniting all mankind as
artisans of progress.
Full development of "fundamental
rights". I will refer to only one of
these: freedom. This implies, in insti¬
tutional and material terms, the right
of everyone to fulfil a vocation and
to develop his personality; and in the
expression and communication of
ideas, the right to meet together and
to form associations, freedom to
express political, philosophical, moral
and religious ideas of any kind and
the right to exercise any profession
or occupation, as well as to develop
any manual, scientific or cultural skill.
Freedom of work, certainly, but also
for everyone the right to work, to
do an honest job without being exploit¬
ed; and for the State, the duty to
provide it. In short, freedom unimped¬
ed by economic, social or political
barriers.
Ethical principles put into practice,
shaping man's thoughts and acts.
Fulfilment of moral precepts estab¬
lished by general consensus; man's
thinking and actions guided by pure
and worthy motives.
Justice for all, giving to each
according to his needs, encouraging
each to give according to his abilities,
wiping out oppression and the exis¬
tence of privileged groups which place
themselves above the law.
Achievement of real equality, as all
will have the same rights and duties,
and the same economic, social, poli¬
tical, cultural and vocational opportu¬
nities.
The reign of truth and sincerity with
men speaking from the heart, in purity
of intent and action, and an end to
lying, hypocrisy and dissimulation.
Governments worthy of civically
mature peoples: upright, loyal, honest
defenders of the general interest;
neither corrupt nor corrupting, nor
venal; neither enriching themselves in
office, nor betraying the people. Poli¬
tics practised with a moral sense of
civil guidance and conduct, without
suborning or purchasing the cons¬
cience of men with money or favours;
in other words, politics based on matu¬
rity and enlightenment, instead of
ignorance.
The disappearance of existing colo¬
nies and the incorporation of their
peoples in the concert of free nations.
In our century of satellites and space
rockets, in this atomic and thermo¬
nuclear age, colonies are a blot to be
wiped from the face of the planet once
and for all. We Uruguayans finally
threw off all foreign yokes in 1828.
Shame on the human race that colo¬
nies should still exist in our world
today.
The world we Uruguayans hope for
fits into the pattern already outlined
(conceived not as a vision of tomor¬
row but of a future time), yet has
some special features of its own.
In the reality we expect for Uruguay
and the other Latin American countries,
the following aims should be achieved:
land must be put to better use, redis¬
tributed to serve the whole community,
exploited rationally and with the help
of modern technology; sources of
employment must be created, as the
only effective weapon to attack enforc¬
ed idleness; commerce and industry
must be planned to take account of
national needs; the various branches
of national legislation must be reno¬
vated and adjusted to current ways
of life and to the pace and demands
of our time.
Education and instruction must be
available to all, with priority for those
living in the countryside; a vast literacy
campaign should be promoted, and
school-building accelerated. Higher
agricultural, industrial and technical
education must also be developed.
All public services must be
reorganized, to prevent the irrational
distribution of specialists, technicians,
office staff and manual workers.
Their knowledge and ability should be
used to the best advantage, with
agricultural engineers and specialists
working in rural agricultural schools,
not in offices in the capital; and in Q1
general, all professional men, doctors, J |
lawyers, architects and others should
devote their efforts to the work for
which they were trained.

ments and a certain co-operation on
the part of nature.
With this special Model hydraulic
and hydrological conditions in the
Delta, fromi Chlong to the South China
Sea and the Gulf of Thailand were
simulated, first without and later with
a dam: the data collected in the field
and those already available were
subjected to computer analysis taking
the two sets of conditions, without and
with the dam All these materials
will be carefully kept because, with
modifications appropriate to different
conditions, they can be used in future
investigations, perhaps for the study
of different problems.
At the SOGREAH laboratories,
where the computer work was done,
six specialists two from Cambodia
and four from the Republic of Viet-
Nam were given UNDP fellow¬
ships to be trained in the use of
the Model. Though unexpected va¬
garies of the monsoon caused delays
in the measurement campaign, the
first three phases of the project
were almost finished by the end of
1965. With all the essential data
collected at this time, it was thus
possible to complete the final model
by early 1966.
Coming to the end of this
programme after seven years, and
with a joint expenditure of slightly
more than $1,250,000 by the govern¬
ments concerned and UNDP, it is
logical to ask: has the project been
successful and has it been worth
while?
The completed .project demonstrates
a number of special achievements.
In the final plan the Mathematical
Model has enabled the technicians to
find answers to many questions
relating to the effect of the Tonle Sap
dam. It can now be demonstrated that
the control of the flood-water will be
effective, although less so than was
expected, but that great care will be
needed to avoid aggravating the flood
effect, mainly in Cambodia.
Taking the results of the programme
as a whole mention can be made of
three notable conclusions:
; There is now agreement between
the specialists on what could be
expected of the Tonle Sap dam;
The Mathematical Model is an
essential tool for effecting the best
control of the flood. It may also be
used for studies yet to be made on
possible dam sites in the upper part
of the Mekong Basin and may permit
the study of the effects on the Delta
of upper basin regulation;
In order to adjust the model, a
survey has been carried out which
has added to the knowledge of the
Delta. For example, the curve defining
the capacity of the lake as a function
of the water level is now accurately
known.
In the broader sense, the carrying
through of this project has contributed
new scientific techniques which can
and will be used in other parts of the
world.
The project has also an important
educational factor in that competent
senior personnel from countries of the
region have received high level training
in specialized laboratories in fields
such as programming, hydraulics,
computer mathematics, engineering
technology and administration.
Finally some comment is due on the
spirit of international technical co¬
operation which prevailed throughout
the project.
In an area where there were periods
of major political conflicts and strained
diplomatic relations, at no time was
it necessary to suspend or interrupt
the work of the committee. This fact
alone has instilled into the project a
healthy air of confidence which it is
hoped will carry on into the develop¬
ment projects that the creation of
the Mathematical Model has made
possible.

Letters to the Editor
FARADAY AND THE DYNAMO
Sir,
In "Great Men, Great Events" (Oct.
1967) I read that Michael Faraday
invented the dynamo. I believe this
is incorrect. The dynamo the ma¬
chine capable of generating a con¬
tinuous electric current was invented
by a Belgian, Zénobe Gramme, a con¬
temporary of Faraday. I believe Fara¬
day, in his experiments, concentrated
on alternating current. The first
successful generation of continuous
current cannot be attributed to him,
but this in no way detracts from his
talents.

A CORRECTION
Sir,
My contribution to the studies of
Indian and Asian art is far more
modest than is suggested by the bio¬
graphical note on me which appears
in the Dec. 1967 issue of the "Unesco
Courier", accompanying my article on
"The Epics in the Art of India and
South Asia". The error in my iden¬
tification appears to have arisen from
my surname which I share with other
and learned authors. The principal
field of my work is the History of
Indian Painting and my publications
do not include the titles listed in the
biographical note.

THE RIGHT VALUES
FOR CULTURAL TOURISM
Sir,
What is Unesco doing for the
preservation of cultural assets not
carved in stone? Your reports on
plans for "cultural tourism" in Turkey,
Peru and Iran (Dec. 1966) qualifies
as "tourist attractions" such things as
"native traditions, customs, national
dress, folklore, etc."
As a student of folk music, I submit
with all respect that if large-scale
tourism is brought to Peru, the young
Peruvian piper whose photo you
reproduce will in a few years be a
thing of the past. This young man
will be driving a taxi or slouching
around in the streets of the neighbour¬
ing town. The "attractions" you men¬
tion will be nothing more than artificial
survivals for exhibition at annual fairs.
Should not economic develop¬
ment take more responsible forms?
Should it not, among other things,
encourage the native crafts instead of
meddlesome activities from outside
the country? Efforts of that kind
should at least go side by side with
the plans in view, if we are to avoid
a social convulsion, the effects of
which are hard to foretell. Unesco
should be concerned primarily with
these matters And this, I may
presume, is your general practice,
although these articles harp rather
too much on the scramble for foreign
exchange.
The attentive reader might question
your optimism about international
understanding 'International under¬
standing is nothing more than
"education" and, in this context, the
education of both parties. The mass
tourist, however, does not travel in
search of culture, but, for the most
part unprepared and without any
inward urge, wants to spend his
holiday in an "interesting" place.
The inhabitant of the country visited is
thinking solely in terms of "money".
The result, I am afraid, is what ethno¬
logists would call an "exchange
between mutes". (Sausages, films,
picture postcards and straw hats can be
sold just as easily by slot machines;
and, all the world over, the tourist
guide is, regrettably, little more than
a superior gramophone.) What has so
far been achieved in this branch of
work and what, to judge by your
articles, is still to be achieved is not
the beginning of understanding, but
its lamentable end'
That, of course, is no more your
fault than mine; yet I consider that
it should be your job, in future under¬
takings of this kind, to set the right
standards
If I may be allowed the question,
what will become of the "invest¬
ments" spoken of, should the flow of
tourists not materialize or gradually
dry up? True, a restored temple will
retain its incalculable value (scientific
or other), but a change in a country's
infrastructure, brought about artificially
from beyond its borders, is left behind,
stripped of all meaning. It can only
be hoped that the authorities on both
sides are not thinking exclusively of
foreign currency, for what ends have
hitherto been served by the blessings
of foreign exchange and teeming
tourists? Nowhere have they con¬
tributed anything worth mentioning to
native studies or to any notable
flowering of an indigenous culture.
All that they have done is to hasten
its decay or, at best, to sap its
vitality in every sphere.
In conclusion, may I thank you for
your informative magazine and assure
you that I follow your projects with
lively interest.

UNITED STATES OF EUROPE 7
Sir,
Congratulations on your issue
"U.S.SR. Today" (November 1967) I
wonder whether you could publish a
similar issue on the United States,
dealing with roughly the same subjects
in equal depth and breadth.
May I also suggest an issue on
"The United States of Europe: Myth
or Future Reality", which could Include
articles on Christendom in the Middle
Ages; the ideas of France's Henry IV;
the Europe of the Emperor Charles V,
of Louis XIV, the "Sun King", of
Napoleon and of Hitler; and the am¬
bitions of each of these men; also
the efforts being made today in the
context of the European Economic
Community.
I should also welcome an article
comparing the U.S.S.R. and the United
States from an administrative as well
as an economic viewpoint: how, for
example, the American states and the
Soviet republics administer their own
affairs and to what extent they are
obliged to comply with federal laws.

WORLD PETITION
FOR PEACE
Sir,
In your Issue on "War or Peace"
(August-September 1967) I was struck
by the identity of views expressed by
men of such different outlooks as
Pope Paul VI, a Soviet journalist and
Philip Noel-Baker namely that war
is anachronistic and absurd and that
all "men of good will" must devote
themselves urgently to building a last¬
ing Peace. I believe public opinion
will be awakened to the terrifying
prospect of a nuclear war, a danger
which we must strive to eliminate. The
solutions you propose are reasonable,
realistic and sound. A call for a
world petition is not a Utopian idea
it would certainly disclose the pro¬
found longing for peace felt by millions
of human beings.

COSTA RICA SETS
AN EXAMPLE
Sir,
As a mathematics teacher in the
oldest high school in Costa Rica and
an admirer of your magazine, I decid¬
ed in December 1966 to take out ten
one-year subscriptions with money
collected by my 100 students. When
the next academic year began the
following March we already had in
hand 30 copies of the magazine
with which to establish a circulat¬
ing library. By the end of the year
each student had been able to borrow
five different issues, each for a two-
week period, and was then present¬
ed with a copy to keep. Among your
1967 issues "Africa and the African
Genius", with its excellent map, "Expo
67" and "The Population Crunch were
favourites with these young readers.
I think such a scheme could be
followed in hundreds of secondary
schools, thus promoting the diffusion
of your splendid magazine.

From the Unesco New

Australia's weather
data satellite
Australia has become the seventh nation
to place an artificial satellite in orbit around
the earth. Named Wresat, the Australian-
built satellite was launched on November
29, 1967 from the Woomera Rocket Range
with a US rocket and with the help
of British technical facilities. Conical in
shape and weighing 100 lbs (45 Kg), its
primary object is to transmit scientific data
for studies of climate Other nations which
have successfully launched artificial satel¬
lites are Canada, France, Italy, USSR,
UK. and U.S A.
Cyclone warning
system for Pakistan
The Swedish Save the Children Organ¬
ization has given a modern hurricane
warning system costing about $200,000 to
Pakistan. Functioning by radar, the system
can detect hurricanes 250 miles away It
will protect a region in East Pakistan where
hurricanes occur frequently, causing many
deaths each year.
Medicated salt
against malaria
By impregnating ordinary cooking salt
with chloroquine, an anti-malarial drug, the
World Health Organization may have found
an effective way to combat malaria among
nomadic peoples In a pilot project in Iran,
the malaria parasite rate among nomads
using the medicated salt dropped in one
year from 18.7 per cent to 3 4 per cent,
and to 0 1 1 per cent in the following year.
Malaria control among nomads is difficult
because their way of life makes spraying
of living quarters impractical and regular
drug-taking difficult
Lifting taxes on knowledge
Representatives of 68 governments,
meeting in Geneva under Unesco's
auspices, have recommended the elimin¬
ation of tariffs and frontier formalities
affecting the international circulation of
audio-visual equipment, books, news¬
papers, magazines, works of art, scientific
apparatus and articles for the blind Two
Unesco international agreements aimed at
easing the circulation of educational,
scientific and cultural materials already
exist; the Geneva meeting urged that they
be given wider application; in particular,
that sound recordings for broadcasting and
apparatus for fundamental scientific
research be duty-free
REGULAR PAGES
IN FULL COLOUR
We wish to remind our readers that,
as in past years, the UNESCO
COURIER will publish 20 full colour
pages grouped in four of five issues
during 1968.
Motorists, T.V.
is watching you
Television cameras placed at busy inter¬
sections may give United States road
safety experts a better idea of what
actually happens in traffic accidents. To
be used initially on an experimental basis,
the cameras will monitor traffic contin¬
uously, erasing the video record automatic¬
ally every twenty seconds. However, the
sound of an accident will touch off a signal
and preserve the preceding images. The
United States Department of Transport¬
ation is installing the first monitoring unit
in Buffalo, New York State, and plans to
set up 75 to 100 others if the experiment
is successful.
Cheaper drilling for minerals
Scientists in Australia are experimenting
with high-pressure water jets as a means
of drilling holes for mineral prospection. In
laboratory tests with the new method hard
granite has been cut at a rate of about
one foot (30 cm) a second over a short
period, much faster than conventional
diamond-tipped drills Subjected first to
very high pressure, the water is released
through a fine nozzle, reaching a velocity
of 2,000 feet (600 metres) a second. If
commercially applicable, this drilling
technique would be not only faster but
also cheaper than diamond drilling, which
can cost $20 a foot ($66 a metre).
6,000 U.N. specialists
aid developing countries
During 1967-68 more than 6,000 special¬
ists are participating in technical assistance
projects in 113 countries under the United
Nations Development Programme (UNDP)
These projects are carried out with the
help of U.N. specialized agencies Their
cost during the two-year period will total
$140 million, of which $114 million will be
spent in Africa, Asia and Latin America.
Flashes...
Spam has singled out 1,550 of its historic
buildings and sites for State conservation
and restoration
In Brisbane (Australia) technicians have
perfected a typewriter which flashes the
words typed onto a screen, thus enabling
dumb persons to communicate rapidly with
each other
Young men drivers with good academic
records in school or university have fewer
accidents than those with poor records,
a United States insurance company has
found.
The first Soviet observatory specially
designed to study comets is being built
near Kiev.
There are now more than 191 million
motor vehicles in 'use in the world, com¬
pared with only 56 million in 1946.
An underground concert auditorium is
being built in the Jeita Cave near Beirut,
Lebanon the largest known cave in Asia.

Until recently man had never attempted to control the unpre¬
dictable Mekong ("Mother of Rivers"), one of the world's
longest rivers (2,600 miles) whose vagaries directly affect the
economy of vast areas of South-East Asia. The development
of the Lower Mekong Basin concerns Cambodia, Laos, Thai¬
land and the Republic of Viet-Nam, but cannot be carried
out without international assistance. For the past seven
years Unesco and the United Nations Development Programme
have worked with these countries on plans to control the
lower course of the Mekong. For this unprecedented project a
mathematical model of the Mekong Delta has been created
with the aid of an electronic computer (see article page 17).
