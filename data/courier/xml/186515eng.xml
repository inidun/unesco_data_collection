submerged memory
more than three million shipwrecks are lying on the ocean floor today. 
Hundreds of underwater decorated caves, towns and monuments 
remain to be discovered. How can we make use of the knowledge 
contained in these remains? How can they be presented to the general 
public? This issue of the Courier tackles these questions.

THe deep dive syndrome
The French writer Jean-Marie Blas de 
Roblès tells how he pursued his dream of 
uncovering “fragments of raw beauty long 
since forgotten” from the depths of the sea, 
an emotional experience very different from a treasure hunt. Between 
1986 and 2001, the novelist took part in underwater archaeologi-
cal excavations off the coast of Libya, exploring that “unseen part of 
ourselves” which must be carefully and respectfully protected.  p 3

                                    The french writer Jean-marie blas de roblès tells how he pursued his dream of uncovering 
                 “fragments of raw beauty long since forgotten” from the depths of the sea, an emotional experience very 
     different from a treasure hunt. between 1986 and 2001, the novelist took part in underwater archaeological excavations 
off the coast of libya, exploring that “unseen part of ourselves” which must be carefully and respectfully protected.
The deep dive 
syndrome
ing our site headquarters habitable. 
It was a dilapidated house from the 
Italian colonial period infested with 
scorpions and huge dark brown 
cockroaches. The next day, an ini-
tial reconnaissance of the site with 
mask and snorkel confirmed the 
observations of the American ar-
chaeologist Nicholas Flemming; as 
he had noted in 1957 after his first 
survey, the buried structures of the 
port of Apollonia were clearly vis-
ible and without doubt they justified 
the excavations we were going to 
undertake. 
On a more personal level, they im-
mediately prompted me to discover 
a universe I had hitherto believed 
to be the preserve of literature. In a 
single leap I had been transported 
to the worlds of Jules Verne and 
H.G.Wells – the worlds of Twenty 
Thousand Leagues under the Sea 
and The Time Machine came togeth-
er in the joyous feeling of knowing 
for certain that I was swimming over 
the abandoned city of Atlantis! 
I had come to my love of Greece 
through an acquaintance with the 
pre-Socratics, and I fell in love with 
Antiquity through baptism in the 
warm waters of Apollonia. Practised 
t all began in 1985. Not long re-
turned from his first terrestrial dig 
with the French archaeological mis-
sion in Libya – one of the privileges 
of friendship – Claude Sintes [Di-
rector of the Museum of Ancient 
Arles] wasted no time in sharing his 
experiences with me: coming from 
Apollonia, he had seen Cyrene, Sa-
bratha and Leptis Magna – Greek 
and Roman remains surpassing in 
size everything we knew or could 
have imagined. He said he had no 
idea that whole towns lay buried 
under the sand of the seashore in 
such wondrous and magnificent 
settings. 
But even better was the fact that 
hardly anyone had ever thought of 
exploring the seabed off this coast-
line. Everything was still exactly 
where it had been in the seventh 
century B.C.! Imagine the fabulous 
finds there might be! Ancient ship-
wrecks for certain – because the 
shores of the Gulf of Sidra had al-
ways been among the most inhos-
pitable coastlines in the world – but 
also buildings swallowed up by the 
sea and statuary and materials of 
all kinds… Furthermore, he had se-
cured permission to organize an un-
derwater archaeological campaign 
for the following summer! 
He dealt with the technical side 
himself, but there was still the ques-
tion of recruitment. The Libyan re-
gime did not license small trading 
operations, so it was extremely dif-
ficult to arrange for the expedition’s 
supplies. As for the conditions of 
the excavations and the accommo-
dation, they would be even worse: 
“Spartan” seemed rather a mild eu-
phemism to describe the situation. 
Therefore, he had to be able to have 
a technical team in which he had 
complete confidence, and people 
he could count on to be available at 
all times. I had an adequate knowl-
edge of archaeology and genuine 
experience of the sea, and I was 
used to living in confined spaces: 
if I wouldn’t mind doing the cooking 
as well as working on the digs, then 
I would be the first recruit… 
So that is how it all began. I 
jumped with joy when I agreed to 
go – I would even have done the 
cleaning if it had meant going with 
him to Libya! – but I never suspect-
ed that my contiribution, and that of 
all the other members of the team, 
would actually begin with precisely 
that kind of work. 
In August 1986, after a three-day 
journey, we were ready to get down 
to work. The first day was spent mak- (•••)
The breathtaking excitement of finding objects underwater has 
nothing to do with their monetary value, writes Blas de Roblès.

in hunting with a harpoon since my 
early adolescence, I had regarded 
the depths of the sea – the fields 
of laminaria, the rocky caverns 
covered with spiky coral, the wavy 
formations of sand – merely as the 
hiding places or clearly designated 
locations of my prey. These all too 
familiar underwater landscapes as-
sumed a phantasmagorical dimen-
sion in reality: in one direction, there 
would be an alignment of Cyclo-
pean blocks dovetailed together; 
in another, a square tower, and be-
yond that banks of oars for triremes 
sculpted in the rock, and in two me-
tres of water a fish tank described 
by Vitruvius [the 1st century B.C. 
Roman architect], with its fitments 
for octopuses and morays… 
Everywhere, between each stone, 
each structure that was more or 
less discernible beneath its cover-
ing of algae, there lay visible, and 
easily within reach, dozens, indeed 
hundreds of objects that were de-
serving of places in museums or at 
least in archaeologists’ archives: 
the bellies and bottoms of ampho-
rae from all periods, stamped Rho-
dian handles from the 6th century 
B.C., Roman cups, broken decora-
tive vases… 
A world was lying there, set as in 
the aftermath of a disaster, and on 
display for the pleasure of those 
willing to take an interest in it. All 
that remained of Apollonia, the 
Greek port of ancient Cyrene sung 
of in olden times by Pindar or Cal-
limachus, was a tongue of red land 
bristling with Byzantine columns, a 
theatre on a hillside and various lat-
er developments. But a few metres 
from the coast, awaiting visitors, 
was a city that had been swallowed 
up like Pompeii. An incredible prize 
for the scientist and a gift from the 
gods for the dreamer I have never 
ceased to be.
Adventure  
and misadventures
Underwater archaeology is of 
course no different from terres-
trial archaeology; they use similar 
techniques even if underwater ex-
cavations are more complicated 
to undertake and require special 
equipment and even specific skills. 
In our case, the working conditions 
were particularly complex. In the ab-
sence of a boat we had to transport 
bottles and equipment to the beach 
on foot. To reap the most benefit 
from our time there we had agreed 
to do two dives a day. Three hours 
in the morning, followed by refilling 
the bottles on the shore, and anoth-
er three hours in the afternoon. We 
then had to take all our equipment 
back to the stores, clean it and 
maintain it, compile an inventory 
of what we had found… and then 
cook dinner. 
Including the land-based team I 
had about a dozen mouths to feed 
every evening; the mission had a 
container of melted cheese, pow-
dered orange juice, spices and 
biscuits… As it was impossible 
to obtain any staples in the State 
shops, we bought from our Libyan 
friends the sugar, pasta and rice I 
needed to put together the stopgap 
recipes concocted by my mother. 
Although our daily menu was regu-
larly improved by fish – the grouper 
we caught on Fridays – I still mar-
vel at how we managed to avoid a 
general mutiny! Especially as we 
only had water from a tank. It was 
also best not to think about it too 
much when you had to remove the 
mosquito larvae from your glass be-
fore you drank from it. After dinner, 
there was an account of the day’s 
digs and then we drank mint tea on 
the terrace, keeping an eye out for 
scorpions scuttling up towards the 
light. 
In fifteen years of missions, the 
list of our misadventures would be 
enough to put anyone off contem-
plating a career as an archaeolo-
gist: the snake under the sheets, the 
scorpions in the shoes, fishing with 
hand-grenades not far from where 
we were diving, warning shots from 
a heavy machine-gun when we got

The deep dive syndrome
(•••)
too close to a restricted zone, short-
ness of breath in stormy seas, etc. 
Surprising as it may seem, none of 
our misadventures ever lessened 
the joy of taking part.
Dionysus  
the twice-born
After the 1986 mission our results 
were so encouraging that the un-
derwater team secured permission 
to study the port of Leptis Magna. 
Prospecting the following year led 
to our surveying a submerged jetty, 
and that significantly altered our 
understanding of the town’s impor-
tance in the Severian period [from 
the end of the 2nd to the begin-
ning of the 3rd century]. Meticulous 
study of the port of Apollonia made 
it possible not only to understand 
the way it had developed from its 
Greek origins to its abandonment 
in the seventh century but also to 
determine the sinkage coefficient 
of the land involved in its partial en-
gulfing. This work led to the discov-
ery of a Hellenistic wreck and to the 
unearthing of innumerable pieces 
of pottery, coins and statuary. 
My initial motivations for engag-
ing in this kind of work included a 
spirit of adventure, friendship and 
the writings of Albert Camus [No-
bel Prize for Literature, 1957] on 
Tipasa and Djemila [two Algerian 
sites on UNESCO’s World Heri-
tage List], but I was never attract-
ed by the idea of a “treasure hunt” 
as such. Although I did once find a 
very rare gold solidus and the ex-
citement was breathtaking, it was 
not at all because of the object’s 
monetary value. It was because of 
the way in which this 
small shiny disc was 
spinning in the blue 
water, reflecting the 
sun like a mirror, 
and because of the 
inexpressible joy of 
having brought up 
from the depths of 
the sea a fragment 
of raw beauty long 
since forgotten. It 
is a process that is, 
ultimately, very close 
to that which is in-
volved in writing, and 
of which to my mind 
one of the most truth-
ful metaphors is pro-
vided by the French 
novelist Serge Brus-
solo’s Le Syndrome 
du scaphandrier(The 
Deep Dive Syndrome) 
in which day after day 
a hunter of dreams 
plunges into the 
darkness of sleep; 
from this parallel 
universe he comes 
up with ectoplasms 
of various kinds, strange fictions 
which take root in reality and man-
age to acquire a real existence. 
Fifteen years on, another dis-
covery demonstrated even better 
the reasons for my perseverance. 
During the underwater excavation 
of the Roman fish tanks of Apol-
lonia, Claude Sintes and I had the 
good fortune to dig up a statue of 
Dionysus. Once we got it on to 
dry land it was examined and then 
it became clear that it matched a 
statuette of a satyr found in 1957, 
and which Nicholas Flemming is 
seen holding, as if it were a new-
born child saved from the sea, in a 
photograph taken after one of his 
dives. Almost 50 years later we 
had just reconstituted a “drunken 
Dionysus” who had crossed the 
ages and seemingly given some 
dramatic irony to his surname 
“twice-born”. 
Archaeology renews bonds. More 
than any other discipline it brings 
together and reconciles the living 
who have been separated over 
the centuries. The sub-aquatic 
heritage is more directly acces-
sible and often better preserved 
and more homogeneous than 
its terrestrial counterpart. Fur-
thermore, it is unexplored. When 
we think, for example, of the still 
mysterious 1,500 kilometres of 
Libyan coast, we are readily per-
suaded that this invisible part of 
ourselves must be protected with 
every bit as much care and re-
spect as the part that has already 
come to light.

and archaeologist, born in 
Sidi-Bel-Abbès, Algeria, in 1954,

Jørgen Dencker’s eyes twinkle with 
enthusiasm as he recalls one high 
point of his over-30-year career in 
maritime archaeology. The head of 
the Maritime Archaeology Depart-
ment at the Viking Ship Museum 
of Roskilde was diving in Tybrind 
Vig creek, some 300 meters off the 
coast of Western Funen. “We were 
carrying out an extensive submarine 
excavation of a Stone Age settle-
ment when I uncovered a paddle 
made of ash wood. The paddle was 
more than 6,000 years old, but the 
ash was still a shiny yellow with al-
most black growth rings. In the soft 
sediments of gytja (a sort of mud) 
– which are practically oxygen-free 
- the paddle had conserved the 
same vivid color as 6,000 years 
ago, when some fisherman must 
have dropped it. But the exposure 
to daylight changed the color within 
minutes and the ash turned grey.” 
Other extraordinary discoveries 
of Danish maritime archaeology 
include an intact tomb containing 
the 7,000-year-old skeletons of a 
young woman and her child and a 
finely decorated paddle with a fish-
ing line attached. These finds illus-
trate what an immensely rich and 
well preserved cultural heritage lies 
submerged in the Baltic Sea and 
inner Danish waters. These waters 
are riddled with sheltered small 
bays, creeks, straits and inlets. 
Here waves tend to be small, the 
current weak and the tide almost 
non-existent. 
This very special geography has 
created ideal conservation condi-
tions for Stone Age settlements. 
Organic material like bones, ant-
lers, trees and other plant fiber – 
which have long disappeared from 
similar settlements found on land – 
have been preserved in the marine 
sediments. These underwater finds 
give us amazing insight into daily 
life and activities 6-9,000 years 
ago, unobtainable from digs on dry 
land. Since the 1970s when the 
first submerged settlements were 
investigated, some 2,000 under-
water Stone Age sites have been 
recorded and scientists expect the 
total number to exceed 20,000.

Climate change:  
protection,  
then destruction
The submerged Stone Age set-
tlements bear witness to radical 
changes of climate in Northern Eu-
rope. As the last Ice Age came to 
an end some 20,000 years ago, a 
huge ice cap covered today’s Nor-
way, Sweden, almost all Denmark 
and the northern part of the United 
Kingdom. Enormous masses of 
water were caught in the ice and 
the level of the sea was several 
hundred meters lower than today. 
As the temperature rose, the ice 
melted gradually and retreated to 
the North. New land emerged, to 
be covered by dense forest. The 
Baltic Sea was created as the ice 
melted, and some 9,000 years ago 
it began to run into the North Sea 
through the Store Belt in Denmark. 
At that time Denmark was still con-
nected by land to Sweden and the 
UK due to the low sea level. Human 
settlements were located along the 
shorelines and as the water rose 
they were flooded. This explains 
why drowned settlements and for-
ests are found today along former 
coast lines, both close to and far 
from present ones and at almost all 
water depths. 
Ironically, the rich cultural heritage 
preserved thanks to the climate 
changes some 20,000 years ago is 
now threatened by modern climate 
upheavals and human induced en-
vironmental changes. Shifts in wind 
direction and more numerous and 
stronger storms modify currents 
and depositing conditions in the 
sea. Sediments that have protected 
submerged settlements for millen-
niums are now being eroded; arti-
facts are exposed, oxidized and de-
stroyed by waves and currents, and 
quickly washed away. 
Meanwhile, the massive use of fer-
tilizers in Danish agro-business is 
affecting the eelgrass at the bottom 
of the sea, which has played an im-
portant role in the protection of an-
cient sub aquatic settlements. Fer-
tilizers are drained from the fields 
to the sea, endangering eelgrass 
growth. 
For Jørgen Dencker, struggling 
with sparse public founding and 
“Seahenge”, marine archeological site in the United Kingdom named after the famous  
Stonehenge, is more than 4000 years old. Its original use is unknown.
(•••)
growing environmental threats, in-
ternational collaboration – strength-
ened by the UNESCO Convention 
on the Protection of the Underwater 
Cultural Heritage, which Denmark 
has yet to sign – is more crucial 
than ever.
A prehistorical menu
“Before, we thought of Stone Age 
men as primitive. But today we see 
them as not very different from our-
selves, people with an extensive 
knowledge of the nature in which 
they lived”, explains Dencker. 
Skeletons found in graves show 
that people were relatively tall and 
well-fed and that most of their food 
came from the sea. Fauna diversity 
was great in the sea as well as on 
land. New findings in the Baltic Sea 
show that even big fish like tuna, 
sturgeon and swordfish – thought 
to have appeared in Denmark only 
thousands of years later – were also 
caught at the time. Well-preserved 
leftovers in ceramic pots show that 
bouillabaisse was on the menu long 
before the existence of French gas-
tronomy. 
Fishing was well-developed and 
tools still common in many places 
today were used 6-9,500 years 
ago. “Discovering several hundred 
meters of fish fences from the later 
Stone Age, harpoons made of ant-
lers and long dugout canoes brings 
us close to everyday life in the Stone 
Age”, explains Dencker. 
Thirty years of Danish investiga-
tion into submerged settlements 
has changed our perception of life 
during this period.

w hen European explorers began 
arriving on Australian shores in the 
1600s they attempted to describe 
Aboriginal Australians; this contin-
ued during the colonisation of Aus-
tralia from 1788. But Aboriginal lan-
guages, artistic representations of 
their reality and Aboriginal relation-
ship to the land meant nothing to 
the new arrivals. The cultures were 
so different that European descrip-
tions were, for the most part, vague, 
misleading or inaccurate. Although 
the accounts are valuable referenc-
es, we cannot depend on them. 
On land, a lot of Aboriginal ar-
chaeological work has been under-
taken. This has provided important 
insight into the immense antiquity 
of Aboriginal Australia – establish-
ing a date of at least 60,000 years. 
Where this work is in partnership 
with Aboriginal people and draws 
upon their oral histories, it helps 
society as a whole to better under-
stand the enormous achievements 
and endurance of Aboriginal cul-
tures. 
Underwater sites have the poten-
tial to reveal much more. Above wa-
ter, we can only look at the places 
where people moved when the sea 
rose or where water never covered 
the land. Furthermore, most organic 
and inorganic materials can survive 
better underwater than on land! 
Although the sea destroys when 
waves hit the shore, it becomes 
very protective once material is on 
the seabed. 
Only limited studies have been 
undertaken in Australia. Artefact 
and habitation sites have been re-
corded in Lake Jasper, Western 
Australia, by Dr Charles Dortch and 
the Western Australian Museum 
in the late 1980s. In 2007 an ar-
chaeological survey (by the author, 
James Wheeler and Cosmos Coro-
neos, assisted by volunteers from 
the Underwater Research Group) 
searched for potential underwater 
rock shelters in a protected estu-
ary south of Sydney. In this area, 
numerous rock overhangs above 
water had been used as rock shel-
ters. Under water, rock overhangs 
were found but it was not possible, 
within the scope of this survey, to 
confirm whether these had been 
used as shelters. What the study 
did show was that their form was 
consistent with their above water 
counterparts. 
Meticulous archaeological investi-
gation will be required to unveil such 
sites, hidden for tens of thousands 
of years – and the task will not be 
easy. Anyone who has searched for 
shipwrecks knows how difficult it 
is to even find large iron naval ves-
sels. Looking for artefact scatters, 
rocks quarried to make stone tools, 
hearths, stone fish traps and other 
such vestiges even in shallow water 
will be difficult. However, if offshore 
peat beds from old submerged la-
goons have survived, these may 
hold the key. Perhaps a core sam-
ple from an offshore drilling opera-
tion will one day open up a whole 
new chapter on Australia’s Aborigi-
nal past?

in Forton Lake, are also part of the 
UK’s underwater heritage and have 
recently been the focus of a three-
year archaeology project, with local 
volunteers working alongside pro-
fessionals.
Nothing  
earth-shattering, but…
In fact, Forton Lake is not really a 
lake, but a tidal inlet off Portsmouth 
harbour, now flanked on two sides 
by housing estates. “At high tide, 
some of the wrecks are completely 
submerged, while others are par-
tially visible,” says Mark Beattie-
Edwards, Programme Director of 
the Nautical Archaeology Society

one riding past on their bikes or on 
the ferry, on their way to work.” But 
this made the site a perfect candi-

the Hampshire and Wight Trust for 
Maritime Archaeology (HWTMA), 
The hulks 
of forTon 
lake
You need only Wellington boots to go explore the Forton Lake shipwrecks.
 The Mary Rose, favourite ship of 
King Henry VIII and now one of the 
world’s most famous wrecks, sank in 
1545, defending England against a 
massive French invasion. The wreck 
was discovered in the late 1960s, 
over 400 years later, using state-of-
the-art sonar and divers working in 
near-zero visibility. It was brought 
to the surface in 1982 and is now 
housed in a purpose-built museum 
in Portsmouth, United Kingdom, a 
few kilometres from where it sank, 
attracting some 600,000 visitors a 
year. 
Meanwhile, across the harbour in 
Forton Lake, the less glamorous 
wrecks of a 1950s Gosport to Ports-
mouth ferry, the Vadne , the Second 
World War minesweeper M293, 
and a scrapped chain ferry from 
the Isle of Wight can be reached 
on foot at low tide by anyone with 
a good pair of boots and are never 
going to be on a tourist itinerary. Yet

both based in Portsmouth, were 
awarded a grant to carry out the 
research, using volunteers to help 
excavate the wrecks, take measure-
ments and gather data. With field-
work completed last year, the or-
ganisers are now writing their final 
report, preparing an exhibition and 
a book. 
Starting with a survey conducted 
ten years earlier, the project teams 
identified 27 wrecks, including 
World War II landing craft, mine-
sweepers and gunboats, a sail-
ing barge and two ferries. “These 
wrecks aren’t earth-shattering dis-
coveries,” admits Beattie-Edwards, 
“and none are either worth preserv-
ing or restoring under the terms of 
UK legislation on scheduled monu-
ments. But they do show that heri-
tage can be what’s on your door-
step. What, for one person, might 
be considered an eyesore is, for 
someone else, of historical interest.”

Indeed, the UK National Register of 
Historic Vessels currently has no 
examples of some of the kinds of 
vessel found in Forton Lake, such 
as the minesweeper. And, unlike the 
Mary Rose, local people remember 
playing on the wrecks and have 
been contributing valuable eye-wit-
ness information to the project, as 
well as old photographs.
A chance for amateur 
archaeologists
Volunteers, including some sixth 
form students at St Vincent Col-
lege, which overlooks Forton Lake, 
received training in survey methods 
from NAS, both in the classroom 
and on the site. Dan Karmy, a young 
local amateur photographer, joined 
in the fieldwork as a volunteer in the 
summer of 2008. “I used to go fish-
ing a lot at Forton Lake,” he says, 
“but I didn’t really take much notice 
of the wrecks. After working on the 
The hulks of forTon lake
(•••)
project, I now know things that I 
wouldn’t have had a clue about be-
fore.” Since the project started he 
has taken over 700 photos of the 
Lake and its wrecks (http://www.
flickr.com/photos/dank147/). 
“I am fascinated by Gosport’s 
history” says a contributor to the 
World Naval Ships Forums , “but 
the wreck of the minesweeper is a 
particular favourite. I grew up living 
in Grove Road and, at that time, it 
was visible from my bedroom win-
dow.” His memories of climbing on 
the wreck as a child have provided 
valuable detail for historians, while 
a local 90-year-old even served on 
a sister ship during the war. Oth-
ers have charted the demise of a 
1950s Gosport-Portsmouth ferry, 
the Vadne, which, after it had been 
taken off service, was used as the 
clubhouse for the local yachting 
club, before being left to rust in the 
mud, its funnel gathering graffiti. 
“Part of the Forton Lake initiative 
was to encourage people to set up 
their own projects,” explains Mark 
Beattie-Edwards. Accessible re-
mains like these can be ideal for the 
amateur archaeologist. They can be 
visited whenever tidal conditions 
permit, without the need for expen-
sive boat hire or special diving con-
ditions. And they can yield some 
surprises. When another project by 
the Hampshire and Wight Trust for 
Maritime Archaeology investigated 
the remains of what, at first, was 
thought to be a simple coaster on 
the banks of the nearby River Ham-
ble, it turned out to be the wreck of 
an elegant schooner, the Norseman. 
Built in 1881 in the USA for a multi-
millionaire, it fell on hard times and 
was converted to a floating brothel, 
then a houseboat, before going up 
in flames at Swanwick.

Stonehenge, Chartres cathedral, 
the pyramids of Egypt, are all evi-
dence of the power of human cre-
ativity. They need to be protected 
and preserved, but not locked away, 
so that everyone can marvel at their 
heritage. 
This is not a great problem on land. 
But how can the public discover the 
ruins of the Alexandria lighthouse, 
or Cleopatra’s palace, the wrecks 
of Greek and Roman ships, or the 
sphinxes and other statues found 
beneath the waters of the Bay of 
Alexandra? 
This is one of the purposes of un-
derwater archaeology, a discipline 
that requires good diving skills and 
expensive equipment. But it takes a 
great number of dives and sophis-
ticated technology - and therefore 
a lot of money - to bring treasures 
to the surface, or to decide to leave 
them where they are and preserve 
them. 
After all, if these wooden wrecks 
have survived for centuries, it is pre-
cisely because the darkness and 
lack of oxygen in deep water have 
allowed their preservation. Once 
exposed to the air, the saturated 
remains have to be treated to stop 
them deteriorating. “Conservation 
takes a lot of work, over many years, 
and is very expensive,” says Florian 
Huber, underwater archaeologist at 
the University of Kiel (Germany). 
Irena Radi-Rossi, one of his Croa-
tian colleagues, is a specialist in 
Roman shipwrecks carrying large 
cargoes of amphorae. “When you 
raise that number of objects,” she 
explains, “you run into all sorts of 
problems, like storage, conser-
vation, treatment and exhibition 
space.” And, on some sites, the 
underwater museums and parks, replicas and digital reconstructions of wrecks are all ways to encour-
age the public to discover our underwater cultural heritage without damaging it. some cost more than 
others, but they may also be more magical. Take the museum in the bay of alexandria, for example.
amphorae have melded with the 
seabed. “Any attempt to free them 
could easily end up by destroying 
some of the finds.” 
The easiest solution, concludes 
Huber, is to leave the sunken ob-
ject where it is. This is what the 
Convention on the Protection of 
the Underwater Cultural Heritage, 
adopted in 2001 by the UNESCO 
General Conference, recommends. 
But how can these submerged 
treasures then be made accessible 
to the public?
Underwater museums
The ideal solution would be to build 
an underwater museum that could 
be visited without even getting 
one’s feet wet. No need, then, to be 
able to dive to admire the exhibits 
in situ. But building such a museum

hind one such project in Caesarea, 
the ancient port city on the Mediter-
ranean coast of Israel, constructed 
by King Herod to honour the Em-
peror, Augustus Caesar, in 10 B.C. 
Some of the problems that still have 
to be solved in Alexandria are famil-
iar to her. “In the case of Caesarea, 
there was no option of recovery,” 
she explains, “as the site is mainly 
composed of architectural remains.” 
But, she adds, “the prospects of 
damage to the site are slight. The 
biggest danger comes from use of 
the area by fishermen and pleasure 
craft.” The only way to prevent this, 
she says, is through legislation, by 
prohibiting fishing and boating in 
the area. But, as for visibility, “the 
only answer is prayer,” she smiles. 
Meanwhile, pollution is minimized 
by periodical cleaning by volun-
teers, attracted by special events 
and competitions. 
For Daniel Zwick, of Deguwa, the 
German society for nautical archae-
ology, underwater parks are a good 
way to make underwater heritage 
accessible, while preserving it. 
“The routes followed by divers are 
usually designed to avoid exposed 
relics, which could be damaged by 
the movement of scuba fins, for ex-
ample.” 
Humans are still a threat, though. 
is itself a highly complex and costly 
technological feat. The question is, 
how complex and, above all, how 
expensive? 
“Finding answers to these ques-
tions was one of the aims of a 
feasibility study for an underwater 
museum in the Bay of Alexandria,” 
explains Ulrike Koschtial, of UNES-
CO’s Division of Cultural Objects 
and Intangible Heritage. Launched 
by the Egyptian authorities with sup-
port from UNESCO, the pilot proj-
ect is under the direction of French 
architect Jacques Rougerie. Not 
lacking imagination, he envisages 
a museum complex in two major 
parts. Not far from the new library of 
Alexandria visitors will enter the first 
part, above ground, with its glass 
walls. They will then go deep under-
ground via a tunnel until they reach 
a 40-metre diameter underwater 
terrace, in the centre of the Bay. 
There, seven metres down, behind 
glass windows, they will be able to 
admire the many finds dating back 
to ancient Alexandria. The museum 
would boast a total surface area of 
22,000 square metres and receive 
some three million visitors a year. 
Apart from its probably prohibitive 
cost, this captivating project would 
have to overcome other obstacles, 
like the Bay’s pollution. Before visi-
visiTing submerged Treasures
(•••)
tors can appreciate the treasures in 
their underwater setting, a way has 
to be found to purify the seawater 
and keep it clear, while not hamper-
ing the operation of the port. An-
other challenge is that Egypt is in 
a seismically active area, with the 
Red Sea lying on a fault line be-
tween the Arabian and African tec-
tonic plates. 
Another underwater museum is 
already being built. At Baiheliang 
(China), there is a 1600 metre-long 
ridge, on which changes in the level 
of the Yangtze River have been re-
corded for 1200 years. Until now, 
the ‘White Heron Ridge’, as it is 
called, has only partially been sub-
merged by the river. But, when the 
Three Gorges dam is completed, it 
will be completely under water. So, 
in the 1990s, the Chinese authori-
ties decided to preserve the Baihe-
liang inscriptions by making them 
part of an underwater museum. This 
should have been finished in 2007, 
but is taking longer than planned.
Other solutions
While waiting for these underwa-
ter museums to open, the public 
can enjoy ‘underwater parks’. But 
for this, the visitor needs to be able 
to dive. Sarah Arenson, a historian 
from the University of Haifa, is be-

There are always a few black sheep 
masquerading as divers who come 
to pillage the sites. And, to enable 
the public to gain a better appre-
ciation of these sites, Florian Hu-
ber has set up a study group for 
maritime and limnic (freshwater) 
archaeology (AMLA), which offers 
regular courses for divers. “It is very 
difficult to protect shipwrecks,” he 
says. “The only way is to raise pub-
lic awareness.” Even so, fragile rel-
ics can also be damaged by deep 
sea fishing nets, storms and even 
the naval shipworm (Teredo nava-
lis), a tiny mollusc that bores into 
submerged wood. 
This is why other approaches 
are being used. One of the most 
impressive underwater trails, any-
where, takes visitors to the oldest 
known shipwreck, the Uluburun, 
which sank over 3000 years ago, 
off the south-west coast of Turkey. 
But, since 2006, divers have been 
unable to explore the original. The 
archaeological park they come to is, 
in fact, next to the original site, and 
exhibits an exact replica, named 
Uluburun III. 
“Uluburun III was built on dry 
land,” says underwater archaeolo-
gist Guzden Varinliogu, “with a fake 
cargo of gold and amphorae. It was 
then laid on the seabed following 
the archaeological layout of the 
original Uluburun wreck.” The origi-

nal is now in the museum for under-
water archaeology in Bodrum. 
Even less harmful to underwater 
treasures are virtual visits, where 
dives are simulated on a screen. 
This is the aim of the European Ve-
nus project, which digitally recon-
structs wrecks in three dimensions. 
Data from sonar scans of the site 
are combined with underwater pho-
tography to provide a realistic simu-
lation of the sunken object, with the 
same resolution used in the latest 
computer games. This is one way 
to allow everyone to see these un-
derwater relics. “It is perfectly clear 
that not everybody can reach such 
sites,” says Irena Radi-Rossi. “But 
you can always create virtual real-
ity spaces on nearby land and offer 
some of the emotion, pleasure and 
adventure of diving to people who 
can’t dive.”

It was a turning point in the his-
tory of attempts to safeguard 
shipwrecks and other submerged 
monuments when, on 2 January 
2009, the UNESCO Convention 
on the Protection of the Underwa-
ter Cultural Heritage entered into 
force. Adopted by Member States 
in 2001, this is the only convention 
that is specific to the underwater 
cultural heritage. Even so, it neither 
regulates the ownership of heritage 
nor changes maritime sovereignty 
zones. Its aim is to combat looting 
and extend to our underwater heri-
tage the same protection offered to 
sites on dry land. “From now on, it 
will be possible to offer legal pro-
tection to the memory of humanity 
that is buried at the bottom of the 
oceans, lakes and rivers, thus cur-
tailing the growing illicit trade by 
looters,” said UNESCO’s Director-
General, Koïchiro Matsuura. 
Archaeologists have been waiting 
a long time for international legisla-
tion such as this. “The 2001 Con-
vention is heaven’s gift for under-
water archaeologists,” says Robert 
Grenier, a well-known Canadian 
underwater archaeologist. This new 
instrument should also enable the 
public to get to know this little-known 
aspect of our heritage, which is so 
much more than a few shipwrecks 
at the bottom of the sea. Untold 
treasures lie in the depths, some-
times for thousands of years. And, 
while Atlantis was probably just a 
myth, entire stone-age landscapes, 
painted caverns and sacrificial sites 
are yielding their amazing secrets 
day after day. Take, for example, 
the ‘cenotes’ of Yucatan (Mexico), 
natural sinkholes that hold traces of 
Mayan sacrifices. The Chichen Itza 
cenote contained no fewer than 
120 sacrificed bodies.
A minefield
The UNESCO convention is, how-
ever, entering a minefield when it is 
applied to safeguard this fragile her-
itage. While land-based heritage is 
subject to increasing protection, the 
looting of our underwater heritage 
is growing at an alarming rate, and 
national legislation is very patchy. 
Treasure hunters and commercial 
enterprises, attracted by profit, are 
deserting sites on dry land for deep-
sea archaeology. Just one example 
is their interest in the precious car-
goes of the caravels and carracks, 
these jewels of the Portuguese fleet 
that plied the spice routes in the 
17th century. Commercial exploita-
tion of their wrecks off the coast of 
Mozambique, for example, is threat-
ening the only remaining historical 
evidence of their construction, as 
most of the documents from the era 
   The unesCo Convention on the protection of the underwater Cultural Heritage 
         is the first legal instrument to safeguard underwater archaeological sites on an international
   scale, providing protection against treasure-hunters, while regulating international cooperation.

were destroyed in the 1755 Lisbon 
earthquake. 
Faced with protests from archae-
ologists and the suspicions of the 
authorities when approached for 
licenses to explore, private compa-
nies looking for wrecks are increas-
ingly proclaiming the scientific inter-
est of their research. But it is almost 
impossible to practice genuine ar-
chaeology when the real motive is 
profit, and shareholders, not an in-
formed public, are behind the work. 
As the celebrated Portuguese ar-
chaeologist, Francisco Alves, put 
it, “the archaeologist’s work is often 
like that of a detective. But what 
would we think of a detective who 
sells the victim’s watch to pay for 
his investigations?” 
Confronted with destruction and 
looting, the UNESCO Conven-
tion has added a series of rules in 
its Annex regarding archaeological 
exploration, which aim to act as 
an added safeguard and directive 
for national authorities. By impos-
ing ethical norms of protection, it 
should eventually eradicate purely 
commercial operations. 
The Convention has also been set 
up to provide a legal safeguard and 
to monitor the protection of sites, 
which is probably its most delicate 
task. In international waters, States 
have, with some exceptions, only 
a limited jurisdiction, which often 
restricts the application of national 
regulations to their own nationals 
or to vessels flying their flag. Ev-
ery time a commercial enterprise 
from a given country sets its sights 
on some article that another State 
thinks is valuable, international co-
operation becomes crucial for its 
protection. Hence the value of the 
Convention, which aims to regulate 
and improve the conditions of this 
cooperation.
Other threats,  
other solutions
Commercial excavations are not 
the only threat hanging over the 
relics located at the bottom of the

seas, even if they are largely the rea-
son behind the Convention. Fool-
hardy tourists looking for souvenirs, 
the construction of ports and oil 
pipelines, mineral prospecting and 
trawler fishing are also threats. 
But satisfactory solutions can 
sometimes be found. Nord Stream 
AG, the company that built a gas 
pipeline in the Baltic Sea, recently 
had to open a breach in an ancient 
barrage made out of sunken Swed-
ish ships, preserved in the Bay of 
Greifswald, in northern Germany. 
This barrage dates back to the 
Great Northern War when, in 1715, 
the Swedish navy scuttled some 
twenty ships, each around 15 me-
tres long, in order to protect the 
bay. The construction company paid 
for the costs of archaeological re-
search and salvage, demonstrating 
that it is possible to find a balance 
between the need to safeguard the 
past and the needs of the present. 
The UNESCO Convention has the 
advantage of inviting its States Par-
ties to find solutions that limit dam-
age to the underwater heritage. 
There remain, of course, the in-
evitable threats posed by nature, 
such as erosion, tides, storms, 
tsunamis, etc. The 2001 Conven-
tion invites national governments 
to take measures to prevent or to 
reduce the impact of such phenom-
ena, by fencing off threatened sites, 
building cages, or covering them in 
sand. 
UNESCO and the European 
Union have carried out several 
studies on the effects of climate 
change on cultural heritage. And a 
project has also just been launched 
with the Sovrintendenza del Mare, 
in Sicily, to investigate the possi-
bility of preventing the destruction 
of coastal and underwater sites by 
earthquakes, under the framework 
of the Convention. The task is enor-
mous, but the Convention has the 
whole future before it.

by UNESCO for the launch of the International Year of 
Astronomy, on 15 January 2009.
“This is the golden age 
of astronomy”
Catherine 
Cesarski  
four hundred years ago, galileo looked at the stars through  
a telescope for the first time. To celebrate this event, the 
united nations proclaimed 2009 the international  
year of astronomy (iya) and named unesCo its lead agency.  
in honour of the year, the Courier is publishing an interview  
with Catherine Cesarsky, emeritus research director  
at the french atomic energy Commission (Cea),  
researcher at the paris observatory, and president  
of the international astronomical union (iau) since 2006.
Interview by Pierre Gaillard (UNESCO).

is around 13.6 billion years old. We 
are able to observe galaxies that are 
barely younger than the universe. 
What new advances does as-
tronomy hold for coming years? 
We are currently experiencing the 
first discoveries of galaxies that al-
ready existed very early on in the life 
of the universe. For the moment, we 
are discovering a few: the brightest. 
Later, with even more sensitive in-
struments, we will be able to under-
stand how they were created, if they 
resembled the galaxies as they are 
now. We will be able to study their 
properties, which for me is some-
thing very interesting. We are also 
in the middle of precisely working 
out cosmological parameters, those 
that govern the expansion of the uni-
verse, its creation at the time of the 
What is the purpose  
of astronomy? 
Astronomy is the science that al-
lows humanity to try to answer ques-
tions it has always asked. Where do 
we come from? Where are we go-
ing? Are we alone in the universe? 
Using scientific means, we try to 
answer these questions, to under-
stand how the universe works, how 
the universe came into being, along 
with its galaxies, stars and planets. 
To know if there are other planets 
in the universe and if they resemble 
ours. And, in a while, we will proba-
bly try to find out if they are inhabited 
by living beings, maybe even made 
of cells as we are.
How is astronomy faring today?
This the golden age of astronomy, 
thanks in large part to great advanc-
es in technology. Astronomy is a 
science that uses technology to the 
maximum and makes it advance as 
well, always going to the extremes 
of electronics, optics and mechan-
ics. 
Recent advances allow for meth-
ods of observation far superior to 
those we had in the past. For a long 
time, we studied only nearby galax-
ies that we call our near universe. 
Now we have much more sensitive 
telescopes and instruments, al-
lowing us to see sources that are 
weaker. Usually, these sources are 
weaker because they are simply far 
away. And when we observe a gal-
axy that is very far away, since light 
takes a very long time to reach us, 
we see the galaxy as it was when it 
emitted the light that we are receiv-
ing. Today, we think that the universe

Big Bang. There as well, we have 
a lot of potential progress. Finally, 
there are extra-solar planets that we 
began to discover a bit more than 
ten years ago because of their in-
direct effects. Now we know a few 
hundred. We know better and bet-
ter how to find ones that resemble 
Earth, and soon we will study their 
characteristics.
Have all these developments 
changed the profession  
of the astronomer?
The day-to-day work of an astrono-
mer has nothing to do with what it 
used to be. We have essentially two 
types of observational astronomy: 
astronomy on the ground and in 
space. It takes a long time to de-
velop instruments for space, they 
must be perfect, we cannot afford to 
make any mistakes. Just proposing 
and carrying out an instrument proj-
ect takes 15 years. The instrument is 
then taken on board a satellite and, 
to explore the solar system, another 
eight to ten years may be required 
before the probe reaches its desti-
nation. It takes a lot of patience! 
And astronomers who carry out 
their observation on the ground use 
telescopes that no longer have 
anything to do with those of our 
predecessors. We now have tele-
scopes with diameters of eight to 
ten metres and we are studying 
new ones with diameters in the 
order of 30m, and even 40m and 
more. Astronomers are no longer 
sat in front of their telescope, in an 
ice-cold dome, like in the past: with 
one eye glued on the star to make 
sure it does not leave the field. 
They now work in front of comput-
ers and do everything through re-
mote control. 
We are no longer satisfied with 
just visible astronomy. Between 
the ground and space, we scru-
tinize all wavelengths, from radio 
waves to gamma rays, which give 
us a much more complete view. 
What will the International Year 
of Astronomy achieve? 
The International Year of Astronomy 
was invented by the International As-
tronomical Union and – fortunately 
– UNESCO joined us very quickly! 
Our goal is to share with the rest of 
the world the wonder we feel as as-
tronomers, faced with the mysteries 
of the universe. 
We want all countries in the world – 
many of which have already created 
programmes – to get involved. And 
we want the public, the widest pos-
sible public, to be able to take part. 
By the end of the year, we would like 
everyone on Earth to have spent at 
least a short while with their atten-
tion turned to the sky. Or at least to 
have read something on the most 
recent discoveries, or reflected on 
our position in the universe.
