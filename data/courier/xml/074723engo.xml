"The word of the Elder is the pure Word..." The respect or even veneration in which certain traditional societies, notably
in Asia and Africa, hold their older members, is far from being the universal rule. The situation of the aging varies widely
from one society and civilization to another, reflecting different social structures and outlooks. But it appears universally true
that for older people full participation in family and community life is an important part of the recipe for a rewarding life.

providing shelter for markets, social

It was under the sign of a stylized

Nations World Assembly on Aging
gathered at Vienna, from 26 July to 6
August this year, to formulate an in¬

the quality oflife ofthe world'sfastest
growing age group, the over 60s.
Longevity in the past was for the
few. In our century it has become the
destiny of the majority. For this
reason we have opened this issue ofthe
Unesco Courier both to the elderly,
represented by a remarkable
nonagenarian, Philip Whitcomb, who
opens our eyes to the enormouspoten¬

to the young, who explain their rela¬

an age group to which they themselves

worldwide increase in the number of
elderly persons make clear the need
for immediate action if the transition
to a world in which an extended life¬
span is the norm is to be smoothly
accomplished.

The
splendid company
of older men
and women
by Philip Wright Whitcomb
'A
N important achievement of
the World Assembly on Ag¬
ing has been a clarification
of the obligations of society to its older
members. But an equally valuable
result may prove to be an increased
understanding by all older people of
the value of their individual contribu¬
tions to the social groups of which they
are members."
This statement, made on the closing
day (6 August, 1982) of the World
Assembly on Aging, in Vienna, by its
Secretary-General William M. Ker¬
rigan, clearly indicates the new impor¬
tance of the part to be played in society
by older individuals.
In the countries of the West, the im¬
portance to society of its older
members and the nature of their role
had indeed become blurred over the
last hundred years or more. The in¬
dustrial revolution had deprived them
of their millennial role of wise
counsellors. Their relegation to a
status of a vaguely honorary citizen¬
ship became even more evident with
the technical tidal wave of the twen¬
tieth century automobiles, planes, in¬
stant communication, stereo and
video, and, most disruptive of all, bat¬
talions of computers and data banks.
Readjustment of the social position
of the elderly was slow in coming, but
by the 1960s pressure from three direc¬
tions had already begun a process of
change the meaning of which has now
become clearer.
The first of the three factors to take
effect was a long-delayed emphasis on
human rights. Simple logic and human
decency combined to add the elderly to
the others whose rights demanded re-
establishment.
A second factor was the formation
of a steadily increasing bloc of retired
voters. In the industrialized countries
new systems of retirement pensions
were introduced based on outdated
statistics of life expectancy. And the
size of this new class of voters was fre-

Most of the authors of the thousands of articles published during the last few years on the
problems of the aging have been men and women in their pre-retirement years. Philip Whit¬
comb, the author of the article starting on this page is now beginning his ninety-second
year. After a sixty-four-year career as an American foreign news correspondent, he
entered the graduate school of the University of Kansas. He is seen above at the degree-
giving ceremony at which he was awarded a Ph. D. in scholastic methaphysics, thus
becoming, at eighty-nine years of age, the oldest graduate in the history of the University.

quently increased by a theory that early
retirement could help to reduce
unemployment. Simultaneously,
shorter working hours, new standards
of hygiene and a new understanding of
the nature and importance of health
combined not merely to increase life
expectancy but also to ensure that in
certain respects the new generations of
retired persons were still fully efficient.
The third factor, sharply distinct
from pity, respect or love for the elder¬
ly, and from cautious consideration of
their political power, is the growing
recognition that the world of today
and tomorrow cannot afford to neglect
the contributions of its growing com¬
pany of older men and women.
Who exactly are the members of this
steadily growing part of the world's
people the older members of society?
What is meant by saying that a certain
individual is "old" or "aging"? What
is today's meaning of retirement? How
does it change the life of the
individual?
Let us consider the latter question
first, the meaning of retirement and
the fundamental change in the in¬
dividual's life. In the final years of life
the vital difference is a freedom of
choice impossible in the first two parts
of human life as we know it today.
Throughout the prenatal period,
through childhood and through the
training and education of youth,
freedom of choice is either non¬
existent, minimal or illusory. Heredity,
the anxious guidance of the family, the
jealous tutorship of community and
school, of religion and politics, of na¬
tionality and of humanity itself, all
combine to make predestination at
least a partial reality.
In the second period of life too, with
its more or less full participation in one
or two of the multiple activities essen¬
tial to humanity for its continuing ex¬
istence, choice is again close to il¬
lusory. In the great majority of lives
choice is strongly affected, often
dominated, by the need to earn a
living.
But in the third period of a typical
life in the Western world today, some
provision, probably at least minimally
sufficient, is made by pension funds,
governmental or private, through sav¬
ings or by some family arrangement,
not only for physical needs but for an
activity to be chosen by the retired
person.
For the first time since conception,
the individual feels free to follow some
desire that necessity or common sense
had long repressed. Driven perhaps by
an accumulated hatred for early morn¬
ing alarm clocks and obnoxious
timetables, a first choice may be to
leave each day to chance and whim a
choice probably soon abandoned.
A second choice is usually travel.
Participants in organized tours include
a majority of retired persons, in all
Western countries. But costs are high
and ten days or a fortnight may be the
limit. Time spent with children or

Michigan high school. As part of an experiment aimed at bridging the generation gap, some fifty
older residents of Harbor Springs, Michigan, ranging In age from 55 to 90, are free to attend any
of the school's classes they wish and to join in other out-of-class activities. Said one 1 5-year-old
schoolgirl of the experiment: "At first it was weird. Now it's nice... well, sort of weird and nice
combined".
grandchildren, especially in Western
countries, except when emergency help
is needed, seems to become less and
less. Plato's insistence on the impor¬
tance for children of visits to distant
grandparents is forgotten.
Group activities occupy most of the
time of most older persons, either in
self organized groups or, especially
among the less affluent, in activities ar¬
ranged by the professionals now
engaged in the care of the elderly.
Serious scholastic effort by the
elderly has developed rapidly in the last
fifteen years. Not only are local study
groups available; university courses are
increasingly available. The university
section for the elderly in one of the
world's oldest universities, that at
Toulouse, France, is internationally
famous. .In Paris the Sorbonne has
revived, after an interval of over ninety
years, what it now calls its "inter-age"
lectures. American State universities,
and many others, make special ar¬
rangements for persons beyond retire¬
ment age.
The activities just mentioned,
leisure, travel, clubs and continuing
education, are all related to the
awakened recognition of the human
rights of the elderly. They ease the con¬
science of society rather than adding
directly to its strength. They are in¬
spired by the obligations of any group
to each of its individual members.
But obligations are reciprocal. Bet¬
ween the individual and the different
groups of which he may be a mem¬
ber family, community, religious,
political, national, global or simply
human a two-way relationship is in¬
evitable. And so it is on the older per¬
son's obligations to some of the many
groups to which he or she may have
belonged that a new emphasis is being
placed.
In many cases the individual
achieves sufficient financial success in
some disliked activity, forced upon
him by circumstances, to be able to
retire as early as forty or forty-five and
undertake something long dreamed of.
In other cases the change from an
unhappy activity may only occur at
what is regarded as a normal retire¬
ment age, but the resultant contribu¬
tion to some part of the social structure
can be important.
Even more obvious is the result
when retirement opens the way at last
for achievements in literature, music,
painting, astronomy, ornithology,
botany or any of the scores of spe¬
cialized fields in which a passion for
the subject, accumulated knowledge
and skill, combined with patience and
plenty of time, are essential.
The dictum "look to the middle-
aged for good work, to the young and
the old for masterpieces" is perhaps no
more than a clever exaggeration. But
there is no exaggeration in the
American poet Longfellow's tribute to
famous men who defied old age:
"Cato learned Greek at eighty;
Sophocles
Wrote his grand Oedipus, and
Simonides
Bore off the prize for verse from his
compeers,
When each had numbered more than
fourscore years;
Chaucer at Woodstock with the
nightingales
At sixty wrote the Canterbury Tales;
Goethe at Weimar, toiling to the
last,
Completed Faust when eighty years
were past.
Turning now to the original ques¬
tion, who is old and what is aging, two
points are obvious; first, that the
health of persons entering the period
5

of retirement is the result of the same
causes that made them healthy or
unhealthy when younger; and second,
that physical aging and mental and
spiritual aging take place at quite dif¬
ferent speeds and different times.
No one needs to be told that
statistical methods of defining old age,
essential though they are for insurance
and for governmental and institutional
planning, fail to explain individual
cases. Wide variations from a
statistical mean, or from the mental
and physical effectiveness that an in¬
dividual's record in youth and middle
age would justify, may be due not to
any profound biological factor but
merely to the same causes that ruin the
career of a football star or a prodigy of
the violin alcohol, drugs, laziness,
gross over-eating or even an explosive
temper.
On the question of physical
senescence accompanied by the
maintenance or even the improvement
of mental and spiritual faculties, the
experience of all who know a number
of older people indicates that there are
indeed two kinds of aging. Scholarly
examination of the question in many
countries confirms this conclusion. Ex¬
amples quoted at random might in¬
clude work done by Dr. Karl Menft-
inger of the Menninger Foundation in
Topeka, Kansas, by Dr. Walter
Crockett and Professor Gary Shapiro
at the University of Kansas, and by the
neurologists Professor Herbert Haug,
Professor Wolfgang Schlote and Pro¬
fessor William Meier-Ruge in the
Federal Republic of Germany and
Switzerland.
In the college of medicine at Lübeck,
Professor Herbert Haug, head of the
Department of Anatomy, has shown
that the section of the brain which con¬
verts sensory impressions into con¬
scious awareness does not change with
age, or that the changes are impercepti¬
ble. The cerebrum, where sensory in¬
formation is processed to become con¬
scious thought, does shrink with age,
but this shrinkage affects only the
frontal, and not the parietal, part. In
other words, some sections of the brain
appear to undergo no aging process,
while other sections definitely begin
aging at some point near the age of
thirty.
Some earlier assumptions are now
seen to be erroneous. For example, the
brown pigment lipofuscin, the volume
of which in some tissues of the brain
does increase with age, is now seen to
be a deterrent rather than as was
previously thought a cause of aging.
Professor Wolfgang Schlote, at Tüb¬
ingen, has found lipofuscin in the body
cells of infants, a fact which becomes
part of his proof that it has a protective
function, that of absorbing dangerous
by-products of metabolism and thus
preventing the death of the nerve cells
which it protects.
Heredity, often cited as a cause of
differences in aging, is in part absolved
by Professor William Meier-Ruge, at
Basle, insofar as failures of the
cholinergic system are concerned. It is
this system that transmits impulses
from the central brain and is therefore
involved in those familiar failures to
retrieve stored information and make
it available to the conscious mind a
discouraging phenomenon familiar to
students at examination time as well as
to older people. Though hereditary
factors do, according to Professor
Meier-Ruge, account for differences in
cholinergic systems, a chief cause for
their failure may simply be disorders of
the metabolism.
Errors and disagreements in evaluat¬
ing the problems of aging are inevi¬
table, so emotion-laden is the entire
subject of withdrawal from active life
At 80, Mabel Karelse, who
could see for most of her life,
found it difficult at first to learn
braille. But with Pattie
Gregory, 1 7, who is also blind,
coaching her for several hours
a week she is making good
progress, especially since it
was pointed out that if she
mastered braille she could
once again play cards. "You
know we both learn", says
Mabel, "Now I am going to
teach Pattie to cook."
for the future regardless of emergen¬
cies and temptations, we undertake as
your trustee to collect and invest your
obligatory and automatic contribu¬
tion, to invest it wisely and at an
agreed point in your life to begin pay¬
ing you an appropriate annuity."
Theoretically the all-wise government
invests these funds in wealth-creating
activities and uses the product in the
payment of the promised annuities.
The national economy is strengthened
and the individual protected. And the
money obligatorily contributed by
each worker, whatever his age,
becomes, theoretically, the basis of his
own future annuity... not that of
someone else.

and the approach of death. But though
some errors are made only because of
insufficient scientific data, others may
be due to prejudice.
The cry of alarm that "the world's
population is aging faster and faster"
is in fact the opposite of the truth. A
century ago, young people of twenty
could still expect to reach old age in
thirty or forty years; now it will take
them fifty or sixty years before they
will admit to being really old. Aging
has become a slower process, not a
faster one.
Political objectives seem to be in¬
volved when disaster is predicted on
the ground that the retirement pen¬
sions of the old are deducted from the
hard-earned pay of the young, creating
an impossible problem as the number
of workers diminishes while the horde
of the idle aged increases rapidly.
The problem, and it is a real prob¬
lem, cannot be solved by concealing
the theory underlying all obligatory
retirement annuity plans. An organiza¬
tion in this case a government with
the power to collect a part of all wages
and salaries declares, in effect, to the
recipients that "for two reasons, first
because the years will come when you
will no longer be paid for working but
will still need money, and second
because you, being human, would be
unable to save and invest your money

Discussion of the problem of retire¬
ment annuities and of obligatory or
voluntary withdrawal from the main
productive activities of a nation may
have obscured an enormous change in
the social structure of many countries.
The network of structured activities
linked with the first part of life is
rapidly being counterbalanced by a
startling new structure of professions
and institutions devoted to the third
and final part of life.
Suddenly a score of professions are
devoted only to the elderly; in France
a periodical magazine has been found¬
ed to meet their needs. Gerontologists
of various kinds abound and no unive¬
rsity is complete without some kind of
gerontological studies.
In the Western world there are at
least a thousand dwelling centres con¬
structed and managed solely for older
people and at least one town Sun
City in Arizona limits its citizens to
persons over a certain age.
But underlying the multiple and
diverse activities proposed for older
people, or even imposed on them, the
basic principle of human society re¬
mains determinant: obligations are
reciprocal between each individual and
the various groups of which he is a
member.
Grandparents, for example, are
members not only of a family, a com-

munity, a nation and a racial group,
but probably of one or more other
groups religious, political, profes¬
sional, social or nostalgic.
The obligations of each group to its
older members and former members
have been the subject of almost
neurotic attention during the last fifty
years. Today not only the obligations
of older persons to the groups to which
they may still belong, but also the
unique value of many of the contri¬
butions they can make, are more fully
understood.
The structure of human society will
suffer dangerous strain if a con¬
tinuously enlarging segment of its peo¬
ple are relieved of all obligation to the
world that nurtured them. In today's
confusion of what too often seems to
be insoluble problems, the existence of
a steadily increasing number of
, parasites must be unthinkable.
Few older people now think of
themselves as parasites. On the con¬
trary they consider themselves to be
well equipped with good health, good
judgment, some special skills and a
great deal of experience. And ready
though they may be when need arises to
care for their children's or their
neighbour's children, dogs, cats and
houses, their personal preferences go
much farther.
Many take part in group activities
such as welfare work, advisory commit¬
tees to help young business people,
teaching and counselling. Others limit
themselves to personal activities, often
those in which they had once felt a pas¬
sionate interest but with little opportuni¬
ty for participation painting, music,
creative writing, historical or family '
records, research in astronomy, natural
history or some other area linked to a
secret ambition. Archaeological digs,
reconstruction of abandoned villages or
buildings, planning or completion of
trails and roads these and other ac¬
tivities imposed- by the variegated ex¬
perience of a lifetime can serve to fulfill
the obligations that retired persons may
feel towards the society that had made
their lives possible.
Whatever activity may be chosen, the
effort will be infinitely less than it would
have been even forty or fifty years ago
because of changes that are yet scarcely
realized.
Every week, last-year pupils Kevin Gilhuly and
Jerry Jessick play the word game "Scrabble"
with 73-year-old Florence Stewart. "I was
amazed when it turned out to be fun, says
Kevin. "With Florence, I find that I am expand¬
ing my vocabulary". For Florence, "Those
boys are terrific... When they talk, they talk
about something interesting."
So fundamental has been the change
in the infrastructure of all human ac¬
tivity that a normal output in most kinds
of work could be achieved in twenty-five
or thirty hours a week, leaving almost
as much time available for some creative
or artistic activity. Ego-extensor devices,
recorders, microfilms, video tapes, data
banks with instant retrieval, satellite
transmission the fast-increasing array
cuts the time spent in the endless non¬
productive tasks that absorbed the
strength of human beings, a change of
great importance to all whose physical
strength is waning while mental and
spiritual powers are maintained or
sharpened.
The human beings of the world form
three great companies. On those three
companies the true wealth of the world
depends. The first is the company of
the young who learn. The second is
that of the middle-aged who continue
and improve the necessary
achievements of the past. The third
company are those who first learned,
then made their own particular con¬
tribution to maintaining and bettering
the achievements of the past, and are
now free to fulfill, if they so choose,
their individual obligations to some
small group or to the whole of the
society that nurtured them. So grave
are the problems of our world today
that the contributions of this third
great and splendid company, steadily
growing in numbers and in potential,
must be sought and facilitated.
Secrets of a nonagenarian
here is a tradition that persons reaching the age of one hundred
should be asked, respectfully, for the secret of their continuing ex¬
istence. Persons less than a hundred years old are not usually ex¬
pected to have any secrets at all, and I was therefore surprised when
the editors of the Unesco Courier asked for mine.
Whatever the explanation of how I am approaching the age of
ninety-two in excellent physical condition and, I hope, a fairly
reasonable mental state, it seems not to be heredity. The fact that
even ifonly the last seven generations are counted an individual must
have over two hundred ancestors makes it impossible for ordinary
people to say whether their ancestors lived long or not.
The points I think of as important are the following. I have never
used tobacco, alcohol or what are usually referred to as "drugs". I
am very suspicious ofmedicines ofall kinds but admire the skill of
today's surgeons.
When I was about twelve years old Isubscribed to a magazine called
Boy's Physical Culture, a publication which soon died. But I have
continued daily physical exercise for the entire eighty years since
then Inow do about twenty-five minutes each morning andfifteen
each afternoon. I have tried with some success to attain a sort of
medium efficiency in a considerable range ofsports: A mericanfoot¬
ball, rugby, basketball, running, rowing, heavyweight boxing.
Throughout sixty-four years of journalism I have tried never to
specialize but to write continuously about the widest possible range
ofsubjectsfrom holiday tours, children's games and archaeological
research to analyses ofeconomic reformprogrammesand interviews
with prime ministers.
As a war correspondent Iflew with a general in an air battle, rode
in a captured submarine, and was myself twice internedfor a total
of about two years.
Throughout my journalistic career I have written well over twelve
million words, but Ineverfailed to continue my study ofphilosophy
ofall kinds.
Ifirmly believe in the necessity of daily exercise, not only physical
but also mental and spiritual, and I continue them regularly as I
always have.

The mystery
of aging
The mechanisms
of growing old
are still not
fully understood
by Ana Asian
AGING is an evolutionary process of life which is link¬
ed with heredity, environment and time, but whose
precise causes have yet to be determined.
Many gerontologists regard aging as an illness, and ex¬
perimental therapeutic research carried out at Romania's
National Institute of Gerontology and Geriatry in Bucharest
over a period of some twenty-five years indicates that with
the aid of certain chemical drugs, especially hydrochloride
para-amino-benzoate diethyl-amino-ethanol, the aging pro¬
cess can be retarded. Furthermore, it has been found that
the use of cell cultures can lead to an apparent regeneration
of human cells or at least to the absence of cell modifica¬
tion or impairment with time. These findings, supported as
they are by research carried out in other countries, seem to
justify the optimism of the Romanian school of
gerontology.
One of the basic problems of gerontology is how to
distinguish between changes caused by age and changes
which are pathological in origin, for in many cases such as
arthritis and the thromboses, which develop as people
grow older, both kinds of change are associated.
ANA ASLAN is general director of the National Institute of Gerontology
and Geriatrics, Bucharest, and a member of the Academy of the Socialist
Republic of Romania. The author of over 250 papers and studies on aging,
Professor Asian is widely known for her advocacy of the use of certain
chemical drugs as a means of retarding the aging process. Among the many
distinctions she has received in recognition ofher work are the titles ofHero
of Socialist Labour (1971) and Merited Scientist (1977) of the Socialist
Republic of Romania, and the World Health Organization's Leon Bernard
Medal and Prize.
Another difficulty lies in the fact that there is no single
criterion for determining biological age. Everyone who has
done research into aging has encountered this difficulty.
Although criteria of aging feature in the first study pro¬
gramme drawn up by the Romanian National Institute of
Gerontology and Geriatry in 1952, a satisfactory solution
has still not been achieved. Today, specialists wishing to
determine biological age, which does not always coincide

with chronological age, take into account the functional
criteria of all the organs and changes occurring in all the
metabolisms.
It would be extremely useful to be able to diagnose
biological age, also known as functional age, both from the
biological and the social point of view.
Within the limits of a given species there exist wide func¬
tional variations from one individual to another, proving
that in addition to heredity the environment exercises a
preponderant influence.
It is thought that aging begins at the same time as life
itself. However, from childhood until the moment when
growth ceases, constructive phenomena predominate and
the functions of the organism are not affected. But with the
coming of maturity and old age there is a gradual functional
decline caused by the loss of active cells. In short, the aging
process, at least from the functional point of view, begins
when growth stops, and it is quite arbitrary to suppose that
old age begins at sixty.
Another difficulty stems from the fact that the question
of the mechanisms of aging has not been elucidated. In this
connexion, one of the theories supported by geneticians
envisages the possibility that aging is "programmed".
Another theory, which has won widespread support in
the world's institutes of gerontology, has been furthered by
advances in the field of immunology. Immunologists have
noted that humoral and cellular reactivity diminishes with
age, while auto-immunity phenomena are strengtnenea ana
become dominant, in other words, immune reactions begin
to attack cells of the person's own body. Another theory
Spring, Summer, Autumn and Winter (left to right) by the Flemish artist
Joost de Momper (1564-1635).
stresses the gradual loss and impairment of post-mitotic
cells (neurons). This explains why the study of the central
nervous system from the morphological, biochemical and
functional point of view has acquired such importance in
research on aging. The possibility of influencing this system
has even been mooted owing to its importance in maintain¬
ing homeostasis and adaptability, two phenomena which
are affected by aging.
It is now known that the life of mitotic cells is limited. The
cellular function undergoes changes caused by the ac¬
cumulation of lipofuscin in the cytoplasm, and other fac¬
tors, the outcome of which is fatal.
Some of the factors in aging have been identified, such
as certain free radicals [groups of atoms which usually exist
in combination with other atoms, but which may exist in¬
dependently for short periods] which are responsible for
major changes in the cellular membrane and for the growth
of cross links between or within the molecules of collagen,
a fibrous protein that gives elasticity to body tissues.
Naturally the laboratories are testing the soundness of
each of these ideas. However It is possible, as we have
noted, that aging is the result of several Interconnected
mechanisms, some of which have not yet been discovered.
It should also be pointed out that the number of persons
over sixty-five who enjoy perfect health is currently very
low, and that today at least the problem of old age Is above
all a medical and social one. If current difficulties are to be
overcome, greater importance must be attached to the pro¬
phylaxis of aging; only then will the World Health Organiza¬
tion's slogan "Health for all by the year 2000" have any
meaning for the aging.

THE increase in the numbers of
the elderly in many countries
has created the need to investi¬
gate the reasons for "the aging of the
nations". Current studies are seeking to
identify the economic, demographic
and social consequences of this
phenomenon and to help in the search
' for effective solutions to the problems it
raises in such fields as medicine, the
social services, and housing.
The first question which arises is how
long is the optimal life-span of a human
being? It has to be admitted that so far
science has produced precious little
about this matter. The biologically
"normal" life-span of homo sapiens
has not yet been established, and scien¬
tists have widely different opinions on
the question.
tumours. Such complaints are increas¬
ingly frequent as people grow older, and
it is almost as difficult to combat them
as it is to combat old age. Accordingly,
in some countries the average life-span
is rising beyond the age of seventy much
more slowly than might have been ex¬
pected. In Sweden and in some other
countries, it is predicted that the
average life-span, which is now seventy-
five years, will not reach eighty years
until the end of the century. However,
the average life-span for mankind as a
whole could, in certain social and
cultural conditions, reach ninety years.
Those who cross this age threshold are
called by gerontologists "persons of
great age".
The study of the phenomenon of
longevity is of great theoretical and
groups with a high degree of longevity
are found in Yakutia, in Tajikistan, in
Byelorussia and in the Baltic Republics.
It has also been established that the
longevity index is higher among some
national groups than others. In the
Caucasus this is the case notably among
the Balkars, the Abkhasians, the
Azerbaijanis of the Nakhichevan Auto¬
nomous Republic, and among the
Armenians of the Nagorno-Karabakh
Autonomous Oblast, whereas in
Armenia itself the average length of life
is scarcely higher than the average for
the Soviet Union as a whole.
In 1977 an agreement was concluded
between Soviet and U.S. scientists to
carry out in parallel work on "com¬
prehensive biological, anthropological
and socio-ethnographic studies of the

national reputation for longevity

cessful book on The Long-Living

Information about persons who have
lived to the age of 150 and over,
although not fully verified, has led some
specialists to claim that this is the nor¬
mal human life-span. Others, including
the author of this article, believe that
the average length of human life cannot
be deduced from isolated and uncheck¬
ed "records" of longevity and that all
the factors should be assembled and
analysed.
It can be said that in the economically
developed countries the struggle against
the external causes of death is almost
over. In these countries the main killers
have been for some time such internal
causes. as cardiovascular diseases and
practical interest because it brings a new
insight into the problem of "aging na¬
tions" and suggests ways of facing up to
an issue whose incidence varies greatly
from one country to another. Persons
ofgreat age are to be found in almost all
big cities and rural areas; nevertheless
there are certain areas where their
numbers are particularly great.
In the Soviet Union one of these
regions is the Caucasus. According to
the 1970 census, some 7 per cent of the
population of the USSR lives in the
Caucasus; nevertheless 16 per cent of all
the country's persons of great age and
35 per cent of those over a hundred
years of age live in this region. Other
peoples and ethnic groups with a higher
than normal percentage of long-lived
persons." In the USSR the work is car¬
ried out under the direction of the In¬
stitute of Ethnography of the USSR
Academy of Sciences in Moscow, and in
the United States by the New York
Research Institute for the Study of
Man.
This project is distinguished in two
ways from previous research on the sub¬
ject, notably that carried out by geron¬
tologists. Firstly, the phenomenon of
longevity is being studied at the group
rather than the individual level, and is
being observed over several decades.
Secondly, it is not the ailments of old

people and methods of treating them
which are being studied, but the causes
of the phenomenon of longevity, in
tandem with research in ecology and the
human sciences. This type of research
had hitherto not been carried out
scientifically.
In the USSR the first investigations
concerned the rural population of
Abkhasia and certain groups of
Georgians living there; in the United
States the first community to be studied
was Robertson, Kentucky, where most
of the people are of Scottish or Irish
origin. Research has also been carried
out as part of a slightly different pro¬
gramme among groups of Mennonites
in the State of Kansas.
To explain the phenomenon of group
longevity, Soviet scientists have put for¬
ward a series of hypotheses (genetical,
bio-reproductive, ecological, demogra¬
phic, psychological and socio-psycholo-
gical, economic based on work, hous¬
ing, living conditions, nutrition) on
which doctors, anthropologists, ecolo-
gists, demographers, ethnographers,
psychologists and other specialists are
working.
Today, now that the first stage of the
work is virtually complete, research in
the USSR is being concentrated on the
Azerbaijan area, and in the United
States there is a project to extend it to
the State of Kentucky.
The data produced so far are still be¬
ing analysed, and the final conclusions
will only be drawn when they are com¬
pared with data from other regions with
a high proportion of persons of great
age. Nevertheless, some points can
already be made in relation to the origin
of longevity and the problems of the
aging of the population.
The basic question is not simply that
a large number of persons aged over
ninety, or even a hundred, live in a given
area but that many of them are in
relatively good health, and continue to
work and take part in social life. In a
word, we are confronted with a
"natural" and fully acceptable solution
to the problem of the aging of the
population. This is today attracting the
attention of scientists and the interna¬
tional community.
Our research shows that group
longevity is determined by a combina¬
tion of factors. In the case of the
Abkhasians, ecological factors have un¬
doubtedly played a beneficial role,
especially the subtropical climate to
which the population has biologically
(physiologically) adapted in the'course
of many generations. Some aspects of
this adaptation have been reinforced
genetically and transmitted to their

in the village of Aknahpur, near Idzevan.
descendants. Anthropologists believe
that this adaptation has also been
reflected in the external morphological
characteristics of the Abkhasians in
their relatively small stature and their
muscular constitution. However, cases
of group longevity also exist in regions
where natural conditions are less
favourable. Thus it seems that the
essential thing is a good capacity to
adapt biologically, socially and
culturally.
The traditional diet of the Abkha¬
sians plays a vital role in the process.
They eat little meat and hardly any
animal fats, salt or sugar, but on the
other hand they consume lots of milk
products (especially cheese), fruit and
vegetables, precisely the diet recom¬
mended for old people. However, it
would be a mistake to subscribe to the
views of those scientists who consider
diet to be of pre-eminent importance.
The traditional diet of very old people in
Azerbaijan, for instance, includes large
quantities of meat and fats. This factor
thus admits of many variations. All the
same, research makes it possible to
deduce the existence of a certain "com¬
mon denominator" in persons of great
age.
In the regions we have studied, such
persons have generally lived all their
lives in the place where they were born,
and have always done the same kind of
work, in farming or in the home. The
country people end their working lives
gradually and many of them continue at
an advanced age to be as active as their
strength permits, working in the home,

and sometimes even in the fields of the
kolkhozes. They still see their circle of
friends, and take an active part in
various social activities. The situation
of those who live in the towns and cities
is quite different. Old people in an ur¬
ban environment often suffer from
what might be called "retirement
sickness", the result of a sudden break
in their working life, an interruption in
their former social relationships, a com¬
plete change in the pattern of their daily
lives. All this provokes nervous tension,
a growing sense of isolation and
uselessness and a feeling that they have
no more reason to live. City life does not
provide them with an opportunity to
replace the physical work they carried
out before retirement with another kind
of activity and leads to cases of hyper¬
activity.
Seeing their relations and friends
helps old people to preserve their in¬
terest in life, and the breaking of these
ties tends to reduce their mobility and to
bring about a deterioration in their
morale and health. Thus one solution to
the problems faced by old people is to
give them a chance to live near to their
children and their families. This would
allow them to keep up their old contacts
and would ensure that they received the
necessary care when they were ill.
It should also be borne in mind that
the number of people living alone in¬
creases with age, especially in the case of
women, who on average live longer than
men. Furthermore, it is usually more
difficult for widows than for widowers
to remarry late in life. Another factor in
the USSR is the heavy losses in men dur¬
ing the Second World War (1941-1945)
as a result of which almost a quarter of
all the women over sixty today have no
family. The Soviet social security
organisms and other organizations are
particularly concerned with old people
who are living alone and who are in
many cases sick and unable to work. In
this connexion, attention should be
drawn to the special decision of the
USSR Minister of Public Health con¬
cerning the "measures relating to the
organization of the medical protection
of old people."
In the rural areas we have studied, old
people live with the family of one of
their grown-up children (among the
Abkhasians this is traditionally the
family of the youngest son). They main¬
tain regular contact with their other
children, relatives and friends, who
usually live in the same village. Clan and
family relationships are particularly
strong among the Abkhasians: several
hundred people gather at weddings,
funerals and annual family reunions.
The traditional strength of these
family ties has a powerful effect in
reducing stress, especially in extreme
situations: when a person is fully sup¬
ported by those around him, it is as if his
burden of grief is lessened through be¬
ing shared with dozens, even hundreds,
of people. The traditional code of social
behaviour which prescribes that each
person should obey certain rules of
behaviour in situations of great tension
may also contribute to mental health
and longevity.
In all the ethnic groups we have
studied we have encountered a strongly
expressed liking for old people, who en¬
joy a privileged position in the family
and in society, high moral status and
universal respect. Perhaps this tradition
goes back to the once widespread in¬
stitution of gerontocracy.
The influence exercised by old people
on the course of events is perhaps not as
strong as it was but, especially among
the Abkhasians, they continue to play a
leading role in family councils, clan
assemblies and village meetings. In
everyday life care and attention are
lavished on them; at family gatherings
and meals they are given a place of
honour, in accordance with their age.
This source of social and psychological
comfort, which strengthens the feeling
that they are useful to their family, in¬
cluding the young generations, and to
the wider circle of village people, un¬
doubtedly helps to keep them active and
prolongs their lives.
It is hard to see how all the elements
of the traditional way of life of Abkha-
sian or Azerbaijan villagers could be
transplanted to a modern urban en¬
vironment in order to help solve the pro¬
blems of old people. But some of them,
notably the social and psychological
factors, are worthy of study not only by
specialists but by all who work for old
people.
The results ofour research should not
be considered as practical recommenda¬
tions on ways of living, diet, medical
treatment and other aspects of the sub¬
ject which must be tackled by geron-
tologists. All the same, these scientific
observations and conclusions may be
profitably used, for example, in plann¬
ing vast housing complexes, organizing
the public health system and the
geriatric services in given geographic
and ethnocultural regions, in protecting
the environment, and in making young
people aware of positive forms of
behaviour and community spirit which
may help combat stressone of the fac¬
tors which shortens human life.

The
eternal return
In Africa old age is a privileged
moment in the endless circle of life
by Nsang O'Khan Kabwasa
IN the African society from which I
comethe Ambuun, the people indi¬
genous to the Kwilu region in Zaire-
people are not regarded as being elderly at
a specific age, but are recognized as such
when their hair goes white or when they
become grandparents, and then they are
addressed with deference and honorary
titles are attached to their names. They
are generally called tata (father), mbuta
(elder) or even nkuluntu (literally: "old
head"). In this society of oral traditions,
as in most African societies, old people
are the foundation of village life. It is said,
moreover, that a village without old peo¬
ple is like a hut eaten away by termites.
The respect in which they are held
stems not only from their having achieved
long life a rare phenomenon in Africa
but also from the African animistic view
of the universe in which life is seen as a
never-ending current flowing through
succeeding generations of mankind.
Before his birth, the African is already part
of this process; he forms part of a group
from which he is indissociable, he cannot
be separated either from those who have
preceded him or from those who will
follow him, and traditional values will pro¬
tect him against abandonment and
solitude.
In this African view of the world, which
is linked to the concept of vital force, old
age constitutes a stage in human life
towards which everyone aspires since
the belief in an afterlife, in the continuity
of life and in ancestor worship places old
people in a special position, since they are
the link between the living and the dead.
This unending life is seen as a circular
movement going from birth to death and
from death to birth (see diagram).
Just as the child is destined to become
an adult, the adult an old man, and the old
man an ancestor, the ancestor as vital
force will be reborn to complete the circle
of life in the universe. In the Ambuun con¬
ception of. the universe, after death
begins the invisible life of the spirits, that
of the ancestors. This invisible world con¬
tains the supreme vital force which the
ancestors communicate to old people.
To each of the three ages of man there
corresponds a particular function. Thus
childhood ¡s a period of learning, a very

been a programme specialist In Unesco's Divi¬
sion of Literacy, Adult Education and Rural
Development since 1977. He was formerly a
programme officer with the Manpower and
Training Sections of the United Nations
Economic Commission for Africa, in Addis
Ababa, Ethiopia. He has won literary prizes for
his short stories, written in English, and his
short stories for children, written in French.
In certain countries there is
a strong and persistent
tradition that young people
should show respect and
deference towards the
"elders", protecting them
from solitude and neglect
in the village community.
At the same time there is a
growing tendency for
achievements in formal
education to become the
yardstick for determining
status. This erosion of
community values, linked
notably to the spread of
the individualistic values
of urban life, heightens the
risk that older people may

physical period of life, during which
spiritual development is in gestation.
Maturity is a productive period of life
when man reaches physical and spiritual
equilibrium. Old age is the age of wisdom
and of teaching. There is thus no question
of retirement, for "even if the bodies of
old people are frail, their spirit does not go
into retirement". On the contrary, it is a
time when the life of the spirit becomes
intensified.
Old people continue to fulfil important
functions in society, functions which rely
on their knowledge of traditions in various
fields: legal, religious, medico-magical,
educational or economic. It is at the time
of initiation that, as possessors of tradi¬
tional knowledge, they ritually transmit
their practical experience orally to the
new generation. That is why, as the
African sage Hampâté Bâ of Mali has so
aptly expressed it, it is a common saying
in Africa that "Each time an old man dies,
a whole library goes up in flames".
Moreover, old people are not only
respected, they are also feared; though if
it should happen that an elderly person is
not on very good terms with the other
members of the family, the magical force
which he possesses may sometimes
work against him and he runs the risk of
being regarded as a Ndoki (a sorcerer, a

away and banished from the village, but
generally efforts are made to appease him
with presents so that he will withdraw his
evil spells and bless the activities of the
young people.
With advancing age and the weakening
of physical powers, the elderly become
dependent, and it is the youngest
member of the family who is responsible
for looking after them. It is for this reason
that every man aims to have a large family
as insurance for his old age. Naturally,
such systems only work effectively when
the entire family lives in the same village
and follows a traditional way of life.
However, nowadays there is a risk of
old people being socially excluded or
isolated when the young go off to the
towns or to foreign countries. With the

They could likewise contribute to the
establishment of "data banks" of tradi¬

made to develop the possibility of in¬

participation in the education of the
young, for they have their role to play in
contemporary African society and this is
the only way of avoiding their isolation
from the other generations. The elderly
still have something to teach us, and the
respect paid to them in traditional
societies should not be regarded as out¬
moded. The system which was founded
on the hierarchy of age and ancestor wor¬
ship should be preserved and readapted
to the circumstances of contemporary

values exist side by side.

WHILE many traditions may be
falling by the wayside
throughout the world, in
China, the custom of the extended
family living together is still followed
and the elderly retain an important
familial role.
Three generations residing under
one roof is a usual occurrence. These
traditional ties have brought about a
mutual dependence among the dif¬
ferent age groups with the grand¬
parents playing an active part in the
family. Thus, the oldest generations in
households can look after the grand¬
children and help with chores accor¬
ding to their ability and, in turn, their
children will care for them.
Parents usually continue to live with
one of their children, after the latter
has married. All the children who
become wage-earners, however, will
give money, according to their
economic conditions, to their parents.
However, many old couples who earn
salaries or pensions won't accept this
monetary assistance.
Pensions and retirement ages, set by
the State Council (China's highest
governmental organ), are stipulated
for urban workers only. Payments
average from 60 to 90 per cent of the
working wage. Retirement ages for
male and female industrial workers are
60 and 50, respectively. For office
work, this minimum is raised five years
for women. If a person of retirement
age has a needed skill and is in good
health, however, he or she may
sometimes remain on the job.
Many retired persons still like to do
some useful work either at home or for
the community, such as volunteering
for neighbourhood activities, helping
children with their lessons or running
small day-care services.
One retired couple living in Beijing
has a story that can be heard
throughout China.
Song Fengzhi, 63, and her husband,
Ding Shuangyin, 69, have three sons, a
daughter and tour grandchildren. They
live with their eldest son and his wife.
YI SHUI, of the People's Republic of China, is
a writer on the staff of China Features, Beijing.

How China cares for her aging millions
by Yi Shui
Their second son and his wife live with
the son's parents-in-law who have no
other children. The daughter married
an army officer and the couple live in
the husband's barracks. The youngest
son is single and lives with his parents.
The old couple have been living with
their eldest son and his wife for four¬
teen years. All get along well. The
daughter-in-law, Liu Muzhen, never
squabbles with her parents-in-law. She
knows that they had a difficult time
bringing up four children.
"My parents-in-law are growing
older and need the younger genera¬
tion's assistance and support. I have
the duty to pay reverence to them and
take care of them," Liu said.
Song grew up in feudal China and
had to serve her husband's parents as
a maid-servant. She wants better for
her family. "I suffered quite a lot
when I was a daughter-in-law in my
husband's family. I don't want my
miserable life repeated in my family. I
treat my daughter-in-law as my own
daughter and she serves me well,"
Song said.
The young couple try to give their
pay to their parents, but the old couple
refuse to take the money. "We have a
regular income. We don't need our
children's money. But they insist on
giving us some money or gifts regular¬
ly," Song said.
Song works in the neighbourhood
committee, a self-governing residents'
organization. Ding is a night guard at
the sewing workshop run by the com¬
mittee. The family spends every even¬
ing together and, on weekends or Sun¬
days, the rest of the clan comes to visit.
In other families, if the children live
in different cities, they would probably
visit their parents on traditional
festivals such as New Year's Day,
Spring Festival, May Day and National

Day. Parents may also visit their
children who live in other parts of
China.
Peasants can continue doing farm-
work as long as they are able, as there
is no stipulated retirement age; nor is
there a pension plan for them. But
some of the wealthier communes began
direct payments last year for peasants
who had stopped working due to old
age. Under this new system, according
to the Ministry of Civil Affairs,
133,000 retired peasants living in com¬
munes near Shanghai received
payments from welfare funds.
Pensions vary from village to village
and are dependent on the living stan¬
dards of the area as well as the year's
harvest. Based on these two factors,
some communes give subsidies in the
form of food, fuel and winter clothes
to families who are supporting old peo¬
ple. The government hopes that this
pension system will change the ingrain¬
ed peasant attitude of having many
children so the parents will be taken
care of in their old age.
In the countryside, the unmarried
grown children usually hand in their
income to their parents who will even¬
tually build two- to three-room houses
for each son to live in after he marries.
These new dwellings are near the
parents' home. Daughters, according
to tradition, are expected to stay in
their husband's home after marriage.
In the one-child family, an old couple
with no son will let their daughter
bring home a son-in-law to live in their
house.
Elderly people with no children may
live in old-age homes. The State
allocates relief funds for running these
homes. City and country governments
run about 500 of these facilities and
7,500 are managed by communes and
the smaller production brigades.
Residents of these homes are
guaranteed food, clothing, medical
care, housing and, lastly, burial ser¬
vices. Many childless old people,
though, prefer depending on relatives
whose financial situation is better than
theirs.

Centenarians

THE medieval alchemists who quested for the

the valley of Vilcabamba in Ecuador.

tional. A census taken there a year or two ago revealed
that no less than nine of the 800 people living in the
valley were centenarians. (The average in an in¬
dustrialized country today is some three or four
centenarians per 100,000 population.) The oldest
Vilcabamban was Miguel Carpió, 123; one of his
daughters was a sprightly 98. Micaela Quezada, born
in 1 870, still spun wool as she had done for over a cen¬

had twelve brothers over 90.
Most of the inhabitants of the valley are descended
from Spaniards who settled there at the time of the
conquest some 400 years ago. They are Roman
Catholics and their claims to longevity can be checked
out against baptismal certificates. A British geron-
tologist, David Davies, who visited Vilcabamba some
years ago noted that "the area has seen little upheaval

valley is extremely tranquil, and the climate is equable,
with much the same amount of sun each day, and a
steady breeze always from the same direction.
"Indeed," Davies went on, "it is this tranquillity that
is regarded by the Ecuadorian and foreign doctors who
have visited the valley and studied the people, as the
cause of their great age. Hypertension, heart disease,
and cancer are comparatively uncommon. Death is

za from the few outsiders who visit the place."
A particularly remarkable feature of the Vilcabam-
bans was that some of them drank "from two to four
cups of rum a day" and smoked "from forty to sixty
cigarettes each day", although the rum was unrefined
and the cigarettes homemade from tobacco grown in
their gardens and therefore, perhaps, less harmful than
the usual manufactured products. Less remarkable is
the low-calorie diet: the average daily adult intake is on¬
ly around 1,700 calories largely from vegetables and
fruit.
Vilcabamba is one of several places scattered around
the world where, for reasons not fully understood, peo¬
ple commonly live to a great age. Other well-known ex¬
amples include the Hunza region of Pakistan, set in the

of the Hunza a year or two ago was said to be over 1 40
years old, while the 1 970 census indicated that there
were 5,000 centenarians in the Caucasus, or 63 per
100,000. What all these places have in common is in¬
accessibility and high altitude. French researchers
have discovered that in France too people tend to live

However, the exact relationship (if any) between
high altitude living and longevity remains to be
established. One survey carried out by the Soviet
Union's Social Gerontology Laboratory and covering
over 40,000 people in the Caucasus reached the con¬
clusion that the oldest among them had rarely changed
jobs or been divorced, or followed an exclusively
vegetarian diet. However a 1 965 study on Hungary's

abnormal numbers of people living to a great age

amounts of animal fats from their reindeer. Such con¬

study the centenarian phenomenon wherever in the
world it occurs with great frequency, and suggest
that modern science is as far as medieval alchemy
from discovering that elusive elixir of life.

The aging world
Facts and figures
The number of people aged 60 and over
is the fastest growing section of the popula¬
tion in the world.
While total world population is expected
to treble in the 75 years from 1950 to 2025,
the United Nations predicts that the
population of the over-60s will show a five¬
fold increase and the over-80s will increase
to seven times their present number.
This means that one person in every seven will be over 60
years of age in 2025 compared with just one in every 12 in
1950.
In 1950 there were only an estimated 214 million people
over the age of 60 in the world. By 2025 that number is ex¬
pected to reach 1,121 million.
The aging of populations will be most dramatic in the
developing world where the over-60s are expected to in¬
crease nearly seven times between 1950 and 2025, when they
will number 800 million.
In 1950 the developing world held only 56 per cent of the
over-60s. By 2025, 72 per cent of the over-60s will live there.
The number of over-60s in the developing world will in¬
crease fastest between 2000 and 2025, when countries like
Bangladesh, Brazil, Mexico and Nigeria will see their
over-60s increase by nearly 15 times.
HEALTH
The large number of old people in 2025 will be the sur¬
vivors of the population aged between 15 and 35 today.
They will owe their survival largely to improvements in
health, hygiene and nutrition. The World Health Organiza¬
tion (WHO) has estimated that two-thirds of the rise in life
expectancy is due to such improvements.
The natural process of aging need not be disabling.
Healthy people can remain active and vigorous until they
die. Modern research has shown that it is the cumulative ef¬
fects of actual disease that cause older people to become
disabled.
In more developed regions the WHO has estimated that
75 per cent of over-60s are active and able to care for
themselves. Less than five per cent are severely disabled by
irreversible brain atrophy.
But the proportion of disabled old is likely to be much
larger in the developing world where many people have suf¬
fered a lifetime of poor nutrition and disease. One study of
over-60s in Costa Rica revealed that 85 per cent had dif¬
ficulties with their vision and 66 per cent suffered from
arthritis.
Throughout the world most disabled old people are cared
for at home. Even in more developed regions, estimates
reveal that fewer than five per cent of the over-60s are
receiving institutional care.
WOMEN
In almost every country women live longer than men.
Most researchers believe this is because of genetic
differences.
Because they live longer, older women outnumber older
men. The difference is especially pronounced in more
developed regions where women in their 60s outnumbered
men in their 60s by 100 to 74 in 1975. The ratio becomes
even more uneven in older age groupswith only 48 men
for every 100 women over 80.
In developing countries the number of men and women
in their 60s is almost equal. But, as development advances,
the gap in life expectancy will widen and women over 60 will
become a majority.
URBANIZATION
Migration of younger family members to urban areas in
search of employment leaves older people in the
countryside.
In the expanding cities a higher standard of living will of¬
fer the young job-seekers a longer life so that, by 2025, the
UN predicts that the majority of aging people in the
developing world will be living in urban areas.
In more developed regions this process of urbanization
has already occurred and the majority of people now live in
cities. In 1975 two-thirds of the over-60s lived in cities. By
2000 this number is expected to increase by 60 per cent until
over three-quarters of the developed world's aged are living
in cities.
EMPLOYMENT
The International Labour Office (ILO) estimates that
only 39 per cent of men and 12 per cent of women over 65
were in employment in 1975. This level of employment is ex¬
pected to drop so that, by 2000, only 27 per cent of men and
ten per cent of women over 65 will be in employment. (Here
"employment" excludes those tasks involved in housework
and growing food for domestic consumption.)
PENSIONS
Most industrialized countries have a fixed retirement age
at which people in formal employment stop work and
receive a pension from the government. Retirement age
typically ranges from 60 to 65 years for men and 55 to 60
years for women.
For these retired people, the main problem is the size of
pension they receive. ILO economists recommend that the
state pension should be equivalent to at least 65 per cent of
a person's earnings. Even in more developed regions few
countries provide the recommended minimum pension.
Nearly all developing countries also have some kind of
government pension scheme. But coverage is usually limited
to the relatively few people in formal wage employment.
The ILO estimates that only 23 per cent of working men
and 6 per cent of working women will be receiving a pension
by the year 2000.
DEPENDENCE
People are growing old faster than children are being
born to support them in their old age. In 1950 there were 19
people over 60 and 45 children under the age of 15 for every
100 adults aged 15-59. By 2025 there are expected to be 40
over-60s and only 35 children for every 100 active adults.
The ILO predicts that there will be 270 million
"economically inactive" over 55-year olds in industrialized
countries by 2020. That will mean 38 older dependents for
every 100 workers twice as many as in 1950.
In Austria there is already one pensioner for every two
workers.
The "dependency ratio" in East Asia is expected to dou¬
ble by 2025, when China will have one person over 60 for
every three active adults.

How the family can help
Delegates from 43 countries, representing 159 Organizations concerned with aging
and old age, attended a Forum held in Vienna from 29March to 2April 1982, under
the auspices of the New York and Vienna Committees of Non Governmental
Organizations (NGO) and the International Centre ofSocial Gerontology. The aim
ofthe Forum was to prepare a report on theproblems ofaging and old age as a con¬
tribution to the United Nations World Assembly on Aging Held in Vienna from
26 July to 6 August 1982. An extract from the report is presented below.
THE family remains the best
guarantee of the material and
spiritual welfare of its older
members.
Relationships within the family
vary in form and meaning from one
society to another, according to the
cultural, social and economic
background, but they are still essen¬
tial for the intergenerational network
of assistance, communication and
services. These exchanges indeed
work both ways: personal contact
between children and the elderly are
for both a source of fulfilment, learn¬
ing and creativity. And the burden im¬
posed by the aging is offset by the
various forms of assistance in cash or
services that they frequently render
to their children and grandchildren.
Because of this reciprocity, it is
within the family that distinctions on
the grounds of chronological age are
blurred, that intergenerational con¬
flicts subside, whereas too strong
reliance on the State increases the
dependence of the aging on the
others.
The study of the changes in family
structures and practices mainly
characterized by a greater geographi¬
cal scattering of the family members
and the change in the status and role
of women make possible an adapta¬
tion of the function of community-
based mutual help networks and en¬
courage measures governments
should take in order to reinforce and
supplement the supporting role of the
family.

Assistance and unpaid care ser¬
vices given by the family to its elderly
members represent a substantial
share of the informal economy which
does not appear in the gross national
product. This informal economy will
undoubtedly be the only way of en¬
suring survival for the elderly in coun¬
tries without the resources to deve¬
lop an institutionalized assistance.
It is .therefore unanimously
recognized that the mutual respect
across generations, necessary to
family solidarity, is based on the
ethical and philosophical values of
the societies and cultures of the
world. This solidarity is strengthened
by a transfer of knowledge and skills
and by economic links. It cannot
however fully come into play, if the
family has not the means necessary
in order to meet basic priority needs.
Considering these principles, the
Non Governmental Organizations
recommend that:
A An old age policy be developed,
integrated in a three-generation fami¬
ly policy, and that in the continuity of
the family the older members be
taken into account on an equal
footing with the younger ones; that
the public authorities give in all fields
of life their support to the setting up
and development of relationships
between parents arid children.
B The family's capacity to sup¬
port older members, both within the
home and in the community be
strengthened:
through a realistic assessment of
the care a family can or cannot pro¬
vide for its older members;
by providing specific information to
families on programmes and services
available to help older persons retain
their autonomy and enhance their
well-being;
through such specific means as
home health care and help and
through providing moral and spiritual
assistance to the families with their
essential responsibilities;
offering to those who provide care
to older members of the family train¬
ing and guidance to assist effectively
persons with chronic conditions;
by offering to families providing
continuous and often demanding
care to an older member the possibili¬
ty of being relieved from time to time
of this burden through such program¬
mes as day hospitals and day care
centres, for respite and holidays;
by recognizing grandparents' legal
responsibilities and rights in the up¬
bringing and care of their grand¬
children;
by providing the elderly without a
family with the opportunity to be in¬
tegrated into a family environment.
C Housing be designed to accom¬
modate older family members
without unnecessarily restricting
their autonomy and planning com¬
munities that facilitate the older
family members' participation in the
neighbourhood and the community.
D The essential role that the fami¬
ly plays or should play should never
prevent the public authorities from
ensuring for the elderly the means for
a healthy and dignified life.

Through youthful eyes
JO celebrate the anniversary of
the proclamation of the Univer¬
salDeclaration ofHuman Rights
by the United Nations General
Assembly on 10 December 1948,
Unesco, with the assistance of the
French National Commission for
Unesco, has organizedfor the last few
years at Unesco House in Paris a
"Youth Day for Human Rights".
A different theme is chosen each year
in response to internationalevents. This
year it was inspired by the decision of
the United Nations to convene a World
Assembly on Aging in Vienna from 26
July to 6 August 1982.
The 1982 Day was therefore devoted
to the deliberations ofyoung people on
the problems ofaging and the rights of
the elderly. It was attended by more
than 400youngpeople aged between 12
and 18, from several French and inter¬
national educational establishments,
members ofthe Unesco Clubs ofseveral
'different regions of France, teachers,
associations ofretiredpeople, members
of senior citizens' clubs and of the
Université du Troisième Age de Paris X,
and various specialists in geriatrics,
gerontology and psychotherapy.
On thefollowingpages wepresent the
findings ofa questionnaire on the elder¬
ly and aging prepared by the French
Federation of Unesco Clubs and a
survey on the general situation of the
elderly in the United States ofAmerica,
Banglcdesh, Japan, the United
Kingdom, France, Iran, Canada, and
the Republic ofKorea, by the students
of the American School ofParis.

1. WHAT YOUNG PEOPLE THINK
ABOUT THE ELDERLY AND AGING
Results of the questionnaire on the elderly and aging
prepared by the French Federation of Unesco Clubs and sent
to young people between the ages of 12 and 18, living in
France and representing more than forty different na¬
tionalities. More than 400 replies were received.
# Do you have grandparents and great-grandparents?
Four equally-divided groups, making up 90 per cent of
those replying, still have 1, 2, 3 or 4 grandparents, and 25 per
cent still have one great-grandparent or, in a very few cases,
two or three.
# Do you live with them? If not, do you see them often?
Where do they live?
10 per cent live with their grandparents. One stated that he
had lived for three years with his grandfather "and that they
got on very well, each owing much to the other".
10 per cent spend one or several months with them each
year (generally on holiday). One, whose grandparents are
peasants, likes to see them since "they remind him of his roots
and make him think about his social background, and their
way of life is dear to him".
40 per cent see them "often, very often, as often as
possible".
40 per cent see them rarely: some a few times a year, some
every six or eight years, two have not met their grandparents,
one has not seen them for three years, though they live close
by.
The great majority of the older generation live in France,
Spain, Portugal, Italy, Netherlands, Belgium, the United
Kingdom and the United States, and the remainder, a very
small number in Sweden, Norway, Denmark, Iran, Lebanon,
Israel, Japan, Bangladesh, Peru, Algeria and Poland.
Do you know any elderly people who live near you, and if
so what are your relations with them?
Two young people said that they found the term "elderly' '
disagreeable, "because it makes them sound like a separate
community".
30 per cent do not know any. Some regret this, as they
would like to know old people's opinions of the young.
70 per cent know some. Their relations with them, whether
frequent or otherwise, are for the most part friendly: "we
discuss things, we help them, we do the shopping, we keep
them company' ' . One wishes "to give them even a short break
in their loneliness' ' , another has "adopted an elderly couple' '
to replace a grandparent who lives too far away; one girl said
that she had a ' 'grown-up" relationship with elderly people. . .
another that one can only have a relationship "of respect,
nothing else".
In villages, "they are invited to all the local celebrations".
It is clear that the relationships between the old and the
young are better in the countryside that in the towns.
Some young people take no interest of any kind in the elder¬
ly; only one said the relationship was unfriendly.
Near where you live, is there an old people's home, a retire¬
ment home or a residence for elderly people?
Yes: 59 per cent. No: 36 per cent. Don't know: 6 per cent. No
answer: 5 per cent.
Have you ever been inside one? Why?
25 per cent have been inside one: for most of them it was
to visit a relative or take part in activities arranged by the
school or boy scouts. Some visited them specially in connex¬
ion with the Unesco questionnaire.
60 per cent have not been inside a home: for the majority,
this was through lack of opportunity, because they do not
know anyone there and would not dare just to walk in. Many
do not want to, or do not have the courage: they would find
it distressing or even "horrid". Some do not want to be
intrusive.
15 per cent did not feel concerned by this question or did
not answer.
How do you think the people in them live?
5 per cent don't know.
10 per cent think that it depends. It depends on the homes,
whether they are good or bad: there are "homes for the dy¬
ing", and retirement homes "like hotels". It depends on the
individual's financial situation. It also depends on people's
character and the extent to which they are able to adapt.
Above all, it depends on whether they receive visits from their
families or whether they are alone and abandoned, and also
on whether or not they have been forced to go into the home.
Some homes are very strict and severe, while in others the at¬
mosphere is freer and more cheerful.
25 per cent think that the people there live comfortably
because they are protected, cared for and, above all, because
they are not alone. They have the calm and the tranquillity
necessary for reflection since "they no longer find themselves
part of the world which has changed so much..." Some no
longer want any contact with the outside world... They have
a great number of organized activities: games, outings, etc.
They chat amongst themselves and are like schoolchildren at
school; they are happy. . . They get on well with each other, the
staff are competent, there is a good atmosphere... there is
television...
N.B. - 1. Those who think this have never been inside a home
themselves "it's what they have been told".
2. The opinions ofyoungpeoplefrom theprovinces on these homes
are much morefavourable than those ofyoung people living in the
Paris region.
Sixty per cent think that the people there live uncomfor¬
tably or very uncomfortably, and that they are unhappy, sad
("gloomy"), lonely, abandoned by their families. They are
rejected by society because they are no longer needed, because
they "make no contribution to the wealth of the country",
because they are embarrassing "castoffs", and these homes
are an easy way of getting rid of such "millstones" . They feel
frustrated, they are bored and they are forced to engage in ac¬
tivities that are not very creative... they are deprived of their
personality, dignity, and of all their belongings and
memories.
They are sent to these "care centres" like children, and they
are no longer regarded as human beings. They do not live,
they pretend to live, they survive, they are "kept in storage",
confined as in a prison or hospital. They live in a limbo out¬
side life. They are nothing but "discarded rags" . Some are ill-
treated there... There is nothing left in life but the sameness
of habit, monotony and loneliness, without any contact with
the outside world... "Those going in and out are sad all the
time"... "They sit quietly waiting for death to come..." in a
state of "hibernation"... "it's infinitely sad... some have
become senile... There are brief altercations, interminable
silences, the sound of slow shuffling steps on the stairs...
everything is bathed in a sleepy half-light"... It is a "fitting-
room for trying on one's shroud"... Putting people in these
homes makes them grow old. . . Beyond a certain age, it is bad
to be separated from youth and gaiety and to put old people
with other old people... "They need to be looked after and it
is up to the family to help them' ' ..." It upsets me to know that
people must be looked after by an association as soon as they
are old: it doesn't seem right"... "I find it unthinkable that,
in 1982, there still exist old people's homes dating from the
last century"... "It's dreadful!" "Alas, now I know how
they live.J can no longer indulge in make-believe...".
Do you think that the elderly suffer the same fate in all
societies as they do in Europe? Do you know of any
examples?
Five per cent think that the elderly are not better integrated
elsewhere in the world than they are in Europe, that the
distinction to be drawn is not between different societies but
between old people who are rich and those who are poor, and
finally that what they have in common is the sadness of their
lives.
Ten per cent do not know and have not heard of any ex¬
amples "as they have not travelled very much". They think ^
that in any case people grow old in different ways depending
23
]]>

<page number="24">
<![CDATA[
^ on their attitudes, customs, religions, political systems and
ideologies. Whatever the society, an old person is happy if he
lives with his family.
They "hope that they are better treated than in Europe",
but add "that it is possible that things are worse...".
Eighty-five per cent think that their fates are very different.
The vast majority compare the position of the elderly in
Europe with that ofold people in Africa, Asia, Latin America
and the Arab countries.
In traditional societies, what is important is that old people
continue to be looked after by their families (even if they no
longer have all their mental faculties...) until their death.
They are respected for having generated life. They represent
knowledge and wisdom, and are sometimes venerated "as a
kind of demigod". They serve as an example and are con¬
sulted for their advice and when important decisions need to
be taken. They teach the young. They are listened to and
feared. They are seldom rejected. The elderly patriarch heads
and unites the family. "In fact, one has to be old in order to
be taken seriously"... "The word of our elders is the Word
itself"... "their word is gold"...
In Europe, on the other hand, elderly people receive more
assistance, health care and welfare facilities from the State,
but "their psychological suffering is greater", since they are
not ' 'looked after' ' by their families. When they are no longer
useful for looking after the younger children, they are put into
homes. They are rejected by the other generations and much
less respected than in other societies. Their situation depends
to a great extent on their former profession: a Swiss banker
can afford cruises, while a farmer will work in his garden and
take a rest.
Others think that in some Arab or Latin American coun¬
tries, elderly people are worse off than in Europe. "They do
really hard work, and are sometimes ill-treated, excluded
from society, and abandoned, suffering from leprosy or
crippled, in the streets... They are left to die... There are no
old people's homes to take them in, and no social welfare. For
these countries, the first priority is to help children to survive.
Those who have no family are very wretched. . . In some tribes,
they are considered a nuisance because they need looking
after. . . " They must stay active and useful until they are worn
out, in most cases in order to have enough to eat and not
starve to death.
Certain countries were specifically mentioned:
In Spain, Portugal and Italy, elderly people are respected.
It is the children's duty to look after their parents until their
death. (Same thing in Japan, USSR, Iran, China...).
In Israel they participate fully in life until the very end...
In the USSR they are isolated.
In Japan they grow old more slowly, because they go in for
sport.
In China, a married man used (until recently) to accord
greater importance to his mother than to his wife.
In the United States the elderly suffer from the "youth
cult", but on the other hand, they are better integrated, since
they prepare for their retirement at an early age.
Eskimos, old people leave the community to go out and die
in the snöw, so as not to be a burden to their tribe.
Many young people came to the conclusion that ' 'a country
increasingly abandons its old people as it develops".
# At what age does one become old?
Forty-five per cent mentioned a specific age or an age
range, between 50 and 80, there being a large majority for the
period between 60 and 70, though some mentioned 20, 35, 42
and 45 years. One young person "did not want to be
categorical, but thought that after 80 it was no longer like be¬
ing 20" ... "one becomes old at 40, because at this age one can
no longer find a job".
Fifty-five per cent thought that there was no particular age,
in that it mainly depended on character "on being young in
spirit' ' : "You can be a wreck at 50, and in great shape at 70! "
At 80, you can be "blooming with health".
"You are old when you feel old... when you don't ap¬
preciate life any more... when you feel isolated... when peo¬
ple say you are. . . when and if you want to be. . . when you are
alone, rejected by young people... put into a home... when

you can't work any more... when your sex life comes to an
end... when you have no more dreams, no more hopes... you
are old all the time... you grow old from the day you were
born... you are old the day you are buried... you may never
be old, provided you feel young...".
Do you feel that you are growing old?
Eight per cent answered: a little, or from time to time,
physically yes, psychologically no (and vice versa).
' 'Does growing old consist in being a year older or in taking
on responsibilities?"
Twenty per cent answered yes. "With each new ex¬
perience... when I have problems... when I think about my
childhood... as I grow bigger... especially since the death of
my grandfather... at 15, I am at the beginning of the
downward slope... I know that I have been dying since my
birth..." "Yes, since I'm not as I was... because I'm develop¬
ing as a person... yes, but I try not to think about it, and to
adapt... as long as I stay with my parents, nothing changes...
this feeling obsesses me...".
Seventy-two per cent answered no, since "they feel young,
full of life. . . they have plenty of time. . . at 20 perhaps . . . grow¬
ing old only happens to other people. . . they don't think about
it" . However, many felt that they were developing, becoming
more mature...
Can you imagine that one day you too will be among the
elderly?
Ten per cent don't know, do not think about it or will think
about it "in due course" ... "as a 14 year-old, I just can't think
aboutit".
Twenty-five per cent cannot imagine it or have difficulty in
imagining it "since it's so good to be young"... "even when
I'm an old woman, I won't be like old people' "... "since socie¬
ty compels us to live from hand to mouth...".
Sixty-five per cent can imagine it: "It's a law of nature, it's
inevitable and you might just as well accept it" . For some, the
thought frightens them, fills them with anguish, haunts
them...
Do you want to grow old and, if so, why?
Ten per cent said that they didn't care or that "it didn't af¬
fect them".
Thirty per cent wanted to grow old, as they wanted to live
for a long time, to get the best out of their life and their family,
have grandchildren, and live as their grandparents lived...
"Like my grandmother, I shall have my own home, with all
my bills paid by my children."
They want "to have time to discover what they never
knew... to do everything they feel like doing... to pause and

to pass on their experience, their wisdom, perhaps to uncover
hitherto hidden artistic talents...".
"I think it's wonderful to stand back and see the world
from a distance!" They think that old age is "a door giving
on to another life' ' , which is different, but which can be fruit¬
ful and pleasant, with leisure pursuits, travelling and many
other activities. They think that they will remain active, and
young at heart, will keep in contact with young people and
help them with their experience. They will be loved, for they
will have known how to make the best of life. They will look
on the bright side of life and will not get bored because they
will give their lives a meaning. "If one accepts old age,
everything should work out all right".
They think that "it's nice to grow old... every age has its
joys, and to stay young for ever would be monotonous...".
"I am happy to be 14, but I'll be just as happy to be 70."
Several of them expressed reservations: "As long as you're
in good health... as long as you are young in spirit and live
with young people... are not destitute... are not put into a
home... have something to keep you occupied... and that
everybody else grows old too."
"I'm not very worried about wrinkles, but I really don't
want people to call me old ! "... "I don't want to be one of the
elderly straight away, as I am only 12, but I would like to live
long enough to become elderly." In any event, they would
rather be elderly than very elderly... one states that, when
retired, he would rather belong to a Club for young people
than for the elderly...
Sixty per cent do not want to grow old, because "they will
no longer be independent", and they do not want "to bother
other people... be a burden on their family... be ill... be in¬
firm, lose their faculties, no longer be able to express
themselves... to suffer... to be sad, no longer able to enjoy
themselves, or run about... to lead a monotonous life, get
bored, have to do without everything... to be completely
useless, to have no future... perhaps to be put into a home,
alone and unvisited... enclosed between four walls or behind
a window all day... to be cut off from the world, abandoned
by the young, ignored by everybody."
They are frightened of being very miserable, of feeling the
end approach: "You feel your departure from the world
gradually approaching... I would feel like a dead leaf."
Some grow angry on the subject: "Who could possibly
want to grow old? I like being young, it's better, it's fun!... ^-

I'd rather die than grow old! At the age of fourteen I'm
already sorry that so much time has passed... I don't want to
grow old, to give up my place to others... The thought of
growing old fills me with anguish."
"It's horrible to be old, I prefer not to think about it, you
become ugly, lonely, a widow (perhaps), ill, your parents are
dead, you cry when you remember the past, you can't go in
for sport any more, you have no end of troubles, you spend
your time sitting alone with nothing to do".
How would you best define the state of old age?
Physical infirmities are most often mentioned: loss of self-
reliance, dependence, illness, disabilities, pain and suffering.
Loneliness and isolation from the outside world. When
people no longer take an interest in what is happening around
them, when they are no longer able to adapt to modern life,
when they can no longer communicate, when they no longer
understand young people, when they feel "left out of
things", when their own family treats them "like a piece of
furniture", when they feel that they are useless (but "as one
is never useless, one ought never to be old")...
The decline of intellectual faculties: memory, creativity:
"old age means the end of being creative, of doing anything
individual".
The end of one's working life, retirement. "A man who is
no longer active is a dead man... I would no longer have any
reason to stay alive and it would be better to die at once, rather
than to drag out the years in suffering...".
Old age is also boredom, the monotony of life, no longer
caring about things. It is sadness, losing any taste for and en¬
joyment of life, melancholy, "waiting for death to creep up
inch by inch", the fear of death.
"The fact that old age means loneliness, uselessness, being
a burden, shows that society has no awareness whatsoever of
the problem."
"Old age is a return to childhood."
"Old age is wisdom."
"Old age is only a stage in life like childhood, adolescence
and maturity."
' 'There is no such thing as old age, there is only life; it is like
a whole day passing . "
Dove, a deserted village in France's Cévennes hills. The drift to towns
and cities has altered the "extended family" way of living in industrializ¬
ed countries. It is now happening In many parts of the Third World, caus¬
ing a breakdown in traditional systems of care and responsibility for the
elderly who are left in the villages to fend for themselves.
2. BRIDGING THE GENERATION GAP
The general situation of the elderly throughout the world
was introduced by the American School, which had carried
out a survey on the following countries: United States of
America, Bangladesh, Japan, United Kingdom, France,
Iran, Canada, the Republic of Korea.
The initial conclusion was that the elderly are respected
much more in the non-industrialized countries, where they
live in contact with the other generations and where they often
exercise economic power and have great intellectual
influence.
In the industrialized countries the situation of the elderly is
very different in towns and in villages . In villages there are fre¬
quent and close contacts between different age groups, in the
same way as in traditional societies.
In the industrialized countries the problem of retirement
homes arises. In the Scandinavian countries some of them are
too "perfect", too well-planned, to the detriment of the
freedom of human contacts.
We visited elderly people in these homes and saw how very
lonely they are. Our visits were very much appreciated. It is
important that these contacts should continue and that the
elderly, for their part, should seek such contacts with the
young.
We have come to distinguish between two categories of
elderly people:
the very elderly, who are often disabled and living in
homes. They tend to be very lonely, and their main need is for
moral support;
the less elderly, who are still active, and who should get
young people to share in their activities. In this way young
people will also be able to prepare themselves for growing old.
26
In the mass media youth and beauty are often synonymous (right)
and the elderly either forgotten or portrayed as lonely and decrepit
has-beens. Women, if only because they usually outlive men, are
particularly susceptible targets of "ageist" myths. Movements such
as the Gray Panthers In the United States are doing all they can to
banish myths which distort the ¡mage of older women in the media.

of his playful kitten. The companionship of domestic pets can often
alleviate the solitude of the elderly.

If there is an unsolved problem concerning elderly people,
it is because there are obstacles in the way of contacts between
the young and the old. Such obstacles are:
psychological:
exclusion by other generations, "you are old",
self-exclusion by the older generation, who feel rejected by
other people: "I am old".
sociological:
current attitudes are in favour of individualism and the
idea of "youth first and foremost";
the consumer society equates productivity with
usefulness, and non-productivity with uselessness;
in towns housing conditions and the anonymity of large
housing estates make communications difficult, and are an
obstacle to having the elderly live with their families. There
are no common meeting places. The family unit has split up.
Old people are afraid to go out or to invite young people into
their homes (the danger of being attacked by gangs, young
hooligans...)
emotional:
peopletalk of the generation gap: we believe that it is more
a question either of mutual fear, the fear that some elderly
people have ofbeing pitied, or else in some cases mutual indif¬
ference, a lack of interest which can lead to a lack of
understanding;
the elderly say that their contacts with the young cease
when the latter reach adolescence.
Given these obstacles to the reintegration of the elderly in
society there is a common desire to find solutions.
The first requirement is to become aware of the problem
and of the need for change: both in oneself and in others. We,
the young, can begin with small, everyday acts of kindness:
smiling, carrying parcels... We can also attempt to influence,
our parents, for we have noticed that our attitudes towards
the old often reflect our parents' attitudes towards them.
Secondly, we should attempt, by all the means at our
disposal (personally and through publicity, the mass media
and organized groups) to make the elderly understand that
their experience, their knowledge, their wisdom and their af¬
fection are useful to everybody; to make everybody unders¬
tand the importance of the involvement of the elderly in
society.
We must encourage the young and the old to meet one
another.
A series of experiments has been carried out: a French
secondary school has organized, with great success, an outing
of its students with old people; some lycée students have been
teaching English to an old lady who, in turn, has been
teaching them to knit; in Sweden, classes take old people out
and read the newspapers to them; in France, some young peo¬
ple have been restoring a mill with the advice of their elders
on the way old people used to work. Senior Citizens' Clubs
have been formed which tell young people stories, relate the
history of the different districts of a town, put on audio-visual
displays for young people and organize joint painting ac¬
tivities, and the elderly have come to realize that their views
have changed through their contact with young people.
Following these meetings between young and old people,
we have noted that:
joint activities are easier in small groups, in which it is
easier to communicate;
our relationships are often more fruitful with our grand¬
parents than with our parents who are "in too much of a
hurry"...;
all these experiences have brought benefits to both sides;
the contribution of the elderly is uniquely valuable:
besides teaching skills such as cooking and knitting, they talk
about their life and times, their travels, their former occupa¬
tions. They are real "living archives". They also represent
our roots, "the basis of our identity in a world constantly in
search of itself".
How can these contacts between the young and the elderly
be increased?
We need:
to put up notices to publicize Senior Citizens' Clubs in
schools, town-halls, libraries, professional associations; to
give wider publicity to Universités du Troisième Age, which
are open to all, whatever their cultural background, and
which provide an ideal meeting place;
to organize meetings through various associations of a
professional, cultural, artistic, sporting (yoga, gymnastics) or
humanitarian nature (aid, personal contacts); through
Unesco Clubs, students' unions, libraries, travel agencies.
The elderly would like to hold social events with young people
such as showing films, singing, dancing, reciting poems, put¬
ting on plays, painting together and making music. They told
us "we like enjoying ourselves with young people";
to let old people visit schools and let them take a hand in
our "workshops";
to participate jointly in local or regional life by carrying
out surveys on the environment or on the community's prob¬
lems, researching into a town's history, or collecting the
stories and legends of a particular region. The elderly con¬
sider that this could make us more aware of our
responsibilities;
to try to counteract the image of the elderly given by the
media, of State-aided pensioners, social casualties, the in¬
habitants of "old people's ghettos", and so on. To promote
new values within our consumer society, the sharing not only
of sorrows but also of joys;
The obstacles to such meetings are often of a practical
nature, such as differences in the pace of life and in physical
capabilities. The main thing is to create real motivation on
both sides; not only to increase our own personal contacts,
but also to stimulate other young people to do the same, and
to encourage the elderly themselves to make corresponding
efforts on their side.
Conclusion
Our role as young people in helping old people to become
integrated in society is to encourage contacts in all fields: ar¬
tistic, cultural, social and at the family, local and national
levels.
One of our number said that: "From the cradle to the
grave, we are all part of the same human society and no one
should be excluded from it".
Many commented that: "You often accidentally jostle
elderly people, or you just don't see them, or you forget them,
but that doesn't mean that they aren't respected".
Some students also commented in writing that: "The elder¬
ly ask for neither pity nor paternalism but what is theirs by
right: the right to take part in life, the right to love and hap¬
piness, and it is up to us, the young, to see that these rights
are respected".
We should like to conclude by quoting a remark which was
made by one elderly person about young people and which
moved us very much: "Nothing is owed to them, but
everything may be entrusted to them.
They can both give and receive".

Education and aging
A Unesco study
THE aging population is today
more diverse than in any other
period in the history of the hu¬
man race. The main differences may lie
in the economic situation, the social
and family setting, the health or the
personal and professional history of
This article consists of salient extracts from

Unesco's contribution to the United Nations
World Assembly on Aging, held in Vienna from
26 July to 6 August 1982.
the individual, his past and present
relationship to education and culture,
and so on. There are of course vast dif¬
ferences among the aging with respect
to temperament, some of them being
active and others weak or dependent,
as a result of an infinite range of for¬
mative experiences and social factors.
The consequence of this extreme
diversity is that any national policy
and, to an even greater extent, any in¬
ternational policy in this respect must
be designed and implemented with
great flexibility, and that the most
unremitting attention must be paid to
the original features of the situations,
the social groups and the persons
concerned.
It is well known that aging, which
can legitimately be expected to open up
a period of freely available time, well-
being and infinite opportunities for in¬
tellectual and cultural enrichment, is
often a source of deep disappointments

"And thy Lord has decreed that you serve none but Him, and do good to Parents. Ifeither or both of them reach old age
with thee, say not 'Fie' to them, nor chide them, and speak to them a generous word. "
(The Qur'an, XVII: 23)
In Muslim countries the teachings of the Qur'an and strong family traditions combine to ensure that older persons
are respected and cherished. This is reinforced by a notion of profound importance in the Islamic ethic summed up
in Arabic in the phrase Rida al-walidain, an expression whose full meaning is difficult to convey but which could
be approximately translated as "Parents' love and affection". For a Muslim, to enjoy Rida al-walidain is one of the
greatest of life's blessings. One of the worst misfortunes that can befall a Muslim youth is to be maghdouban alalhi
mina al-walidain. "Accursed of his parents". Above, reading the Qur'an, bazaar scene at Tashkurgan, Afghanistan,

Like most other developing countries, Kenya is going through a rapid process of modernization and
change which is putting considerable strain on the traditional family structure and hence on the
traditional educational role, support and maintenance of the elderly. Family life is disintegrating as
the young move away to the towns in search of jobs, leaving the elderly In the rural areas. Under
these circumstances the time-honoured educational role of the elderly is no longer practicable. The
modern formal education system offers few educational opportunities for the elderly, although they
have been included in the mass literacy campaigns. Among the Masai, where the elders are often
the source of considerable wealth and family ties remain strong, the valuable contributions the ag¬
ing can make to society are still recognized. Above, three generations of a close-knit Masai family.
In the United States of America a number of innovative programmes are being started which enable
low-income older persons to be trained in "helping roles" and then placed in part-time jobs which
pay a small hourly stipend. In 1 977, under the Foster Grandparents Programme, more than 1 5,000
older persons with low incomes received 40 hours training in providing care to disturbed children.
The "grandparents" offer a service to the community and to the young people and at the same time
they gain financially and emotionally from the experience. In many cases the jobs are unpaid, but
the older persons still find them rewarding. Below, a Red Cross volunteer helper in a centre for
disabled children.
and experiences of which deterioration
of health is not always the worst. They
may be due to worsening of the finan¬
cial situation or even to poverty, to in-
frequency of family, professional and
social contacts, and to loss of identity
and justification for existence in the
community.
Where suitable educational and
cultural systems are not available and
where there has been no association
with such resources during youth and
adulthood, the aging are likely to be
condemned to solitude, emptiness and
boredom. The reality of these dangers
should prompt the public authorities to
devise a consistent policy with respect
to aging and to equip themselves with
the means of carrying it out; in draf¬
ting and implementing the policy they
should be able to reckon with the par¬
ticipation of the aging themselves and
with the co-operation of the non¬
governmental sector.
Without claiming that adult educa¬
tion should be considered a panacea, it
would appear that in its various dimen¬
sions it is a prerequisite for preparation
for retirement and entry into the last
stage of life as well as for creation of
the conditions for "a good old age".
Consequently, education should be a
fundamental aspect of any policy

^ relating to aging and elderly persons,
and the latter should be closely
associated with specifying the educa¬
tional priorities and the systems to be
established in this connexion.
In countries where oral traditions
prevail it would be most important for
the authorities to ensure that the aging
are enabled to give the community the
fullest possible benefit of their
knowledge, experience and moral
authority, for example, by recording
what they have to say and
disseminating it via the media. Here,
more than anywhere else, education
should not be conceived of as a process
limited to the formal transmission of
knowledge and techniques, still less as
an activity confined to a particular
stratum of the population or age
group, but rather as a fundamental
human right.
In 1981, India's over-60s numbered some
37.6 million (5.5 per cent of total population)
and it is estimated that by the year 2021 they
will number 130.5 million. The vast majority
(60 to 70 per cent) of the elderly belong to the
poorer section of society and their problems
are more the problems of poverty than of ag¬
ing. In spite of this, the elderly in India, grand¬
fathers, grandmothers, great-uncles and
great-aunts, whether in the affluent or the
poorer sectors of society, perform a very im¬
portant educational function in the socializa¬
tion of the children of the family, from the pre¬
school stage to well into adolescent life.

Many developing countries have yet
to solve the thorny problem of the
"brain drain" of which elderly people
are often the indirect victims.
Younger qualified people, trained at
considerable cost as part of the com¬
mon development effort, find it dif¬
ficult to resist the lure of the high
salaries they can command abroad.
Deprived of this human resource, the
development process stagnates and
their older unqualified compatriots,
who have contributed to the cost of
their training are reduced, like this
Haitian roadside candle-seller (right),
to humble tasks to eke out their pen¬
sions. One country of the Caribbean
basin, Guyana, has adopted a policy
of encouraging the comparatively
few qualified personnel who have
reached retirement age to continue in
their jobs while strategies are devised
to train rapidly large numbers of
young people and to motivate those
who have gone abroad to return and
work for the development of their
own country-

It is well known that in the
budgetary arbitration that goes on at
government level, education is rarely in
a privileged position relative to the
other items of expenditure and, within
the area of education, that for adults
and even more so for the aging most
often gives the impression of being a
poor relation. Aggravated by the
economic crisis, this state of affairs is
not only contrary to the interests of the
social categories and persons directly
concerned but it is also in conflict with
the true interest of countries, par
ticularly developing countries, to
whose progress the aging can make a
strong contribution.
Of course, a prerequisite for this
contribution is that the aging should be
literate and that they should receive
education and training suited to the
tasks which they could perform. Over
and above the productive and pace-
setting functions that they can per¬
form, special emphasis should be plac¬
ed on their aptitude for teaching the
young and also the less young; to a
considerable degree, this represents
compensation for the expenditure on
education for the aging.
Furthermore, it is generally
recognized that proper preparation for
retirement, in which education is a fun¬
damental factor, in most cases helps
avoid problems of both mental and
physical health which, besides being
especially poorly tolerated at this stage
of existence, can be extremely expen¬
sive for social security systems that is
to say, for the nation. It may therefore
be hoped that States will really want to
make available the financial resources

which are indispensable for implemen¬
ting their political intentions with
respect to the aging and that they will
consider expenditure on the education
of the aging to be a particularly pro¬
fitable investment, while sometimes
seeking supplementary resources from
the non-governmental and voluntary
assistance sectors.
Men and women are usually con¬
sidered together under the heading of
the aging. However, given the greater
longevity of women, the fact that it is
often harder for them to have access to
Among the subjects for possible
research special attention could be paid
to teaching the aging to read and write,
to the effects of prior access to educa¬
tional and cultural resources on the
utilization of free time for creative pur¬
poses and on the adaptation of in¬
dividuals to the status of retirement,
professional and technological readap¬
tation of the aging and so forth.
Research of this kind, in which the
aging should be extensively associated,
would undoubtedly result in innova¬
tions which could have a considerable
represent, especially from the point of
view of economic, social and cultural
development.
Here, by way of illustration, are
some educational aspects of the prob¬
lems of aging that could be included to
advantage in the priorities of the world
plan of action, as regards both recom¬
mendations to States and activities to
be undertaken on an international and
regional level:
Teaching all society's age groups to

in general, and the often subordinate
and laborious nature of the tasks
which are their lot in the household as
well as in production and in the tertiary
sector, they tend to be particularly
disadvantaged, handicapped and lone¬
ly in the face of aging. This situation
warrants special attention on the part
of the persons responsible at the
various decision-making levels to en¬
sure that the difficulties peculiar to the
circumstances of aging women can be
offset by specific and practical
measures.
The studies on education and aging
carried out for Unesco showed that
there are extremely conspicuous short¬
comings with respect to research, in¬
novations and exchanges of ideas and
experience on this subject. This defi¬
ciency is particularly regrettable in that
the matter has been ignored and
neglected for such a long time.

on society as a whole. It would appear
to be very desirable that various
developed and developing countries
should engage in mutually profitable
exchanges in this domain where, by
analogy with the isolation to which the
aging are so often exposed, the action
of States nearly always takes place in
solitude, ignorance, and even indif¬
ference, as compared with what hap¬
pens in other areas.
Since it is understood that education
should occupy a position of choice in
the world plan of action on aging, it
must be pointed out that the fun¬
damental idea that the access of
everybody and of all ages to education
and culture is based on an inalienable
human right should not lead to the
classification of education among so-
called "humanitarian" tasks. On the
contrary, it should be considered as a

An international plan
of action
AN International Plan of Action
to guide States in dealing with
problems brought about by
rapidly increasing numbers of elderly
persons all over the world was adopted
in Vienna at the conclusion of the two-
week United Nations-sponsored World
Assembly on Aging.
The Plan of Action, adopted by the
approximately 120 countries which at¬
tended the Assembly, emphasized the
need to help the elderly "lead indepen¬
dent lives in their own family and com¬
munity for as long as possible, instead
of being excluded and cut off from all
activities of society".
In the area of health and nutrition,
research and practical experience have
demonstrated that health maintenance
in the elderly is possible and that
diseases do not need to be essential com¬
ponents of aging. Early diagnosis and
appropriate treatment are required, as
well as preventive measures, to reduce
disabilities and diseases of the aging.
It is important to establish a proper
balance between the role of institutions
and that of the family in providing
health care based on recognition that
the family and the immediate communi¬
ty are the key elements in a well-
balanced system of care.
The Plan also states that a very im¬
portant question concerns the
possibilities of preventing or at least
postponing the negative functional con¬
sequences of aging. The health of the
aging is fundamentally conditioned by
their previous health and, therefore,
life-long health care starting in youth is
of paramount importance; this includes
preventive health care, nutrition, exer¬
cise, the avoidance of health-harming
habits and attention to environmental
factors.
The section on health in the Action
Plan also contains a number of other
recommendations, which deal with the
need for good nutrition, adequate com¬
munity services and special attention to
the very elderly. Other provisions also
deal with the need and ability to prevent
or deal with mental health problems
among the aging, and the vulnerability
of the elderly to accidents.
32
In the section on the housing and en¬
vironment ofthe elderly, the Plan notes
that "Housing for the elderly must be
viewed as more than mere shelter".
"In addition to the physical, it has
psychological and social significance,
which should be taken into account."
To release the aged from dependence on
others, national housing policies should
pursue a number of goals, which in¬
clude providing for the restoration and
development and, where feasible and
appropriate, the remodelling and im¬
provement of homes and their adapta¬
tion for the aged.
In the section on the elderly and their
relationship to the family, the Action
Plan states that the family, regardless of
its form or organization, is recognized
as a fundamental unit of society.
The changes in the status of women,
however, have reduced their traditional
role as caretakers of older family
members. It is necessary to enable the
family as a whole, including its male
members, to take over and share the
burden of help in and by the family.
Appropriate support from the wider
community, available when and where
it is needed, can make "a crucial dif¬
ference to the willingness and ability of
families to continue to care for elderly
relatives", the Plan states, so that plan¬
ning and provision of services should
take full account of the needs of those
who provide such care.
Governments and non-governmental
bodies should be encouraged to
establish social services to support the
whole family when there are elderly
people at home and to implement
measures especially for low-income
families who wish to keep elderly people
at home. Also, children should be en¬
couraged to support their parents.
In the area of social welfare for the
elderly, according to the Plan, this
should be community-based and pro¬
vide a broad range of preventive,
remedial and developmental services
for the aging, to enable them to lead as
independent a life as possible in their
own home and in their community, re¬
maining active and useful citizens.
In many countries where resources
are scarce, the Plan goes on, there is a
general lack of organized social welfare
services, particularly in the rural areas.
In traditional societies, old people have
enjoyed a privileged position based on
respect, consideration, status and
authority. But this is "starting to be upset
under the influence ofmodern trends and
that privileged position is now being
questioned". It is therefore "time to
become aware of these changes and on
that basis to define national aging
policies that would avoid some of the
problems concerning the elderly faced by
some developed countries".
Governments should endeavour to
reduce or eliminate fiscal or other con¬
straints on informal and voluntary ac¬
tivities, and eliminate or soften regula¬
tions which hinder or discourage part-
time work, mutual self-help and the use
of volunteers alongside professional
staff in providing social services or in in¬
stitutions for the elderly.
Regarding the question of institu¬
tionalization, the Plan states that
'whenever institutionalization is
necessary or inevitable for elderly per¬
sons, the utmost effort must be made to
ensure a quality of institutional life cor¬
responding to normal conditions in
their communities, with full respect for
their dignity, beliefs, needs, interests
and privacy. States should be encourag¬
ed to define minimum standards to en¬
sure higher quality of institutional care.
On the problems of elderly migrants,
appropriate measures should be taken
to provide social welfare services in ac¬
cordance with their ethnic, cultural,
linguistic and other characteristics.
Also in the section on the social
welfare of the elderly, the Plan states
that in order to facilitate mutual help
among the elderly and "let their voices
be heard", Governments and non¬
governmental bodies should encourage
the establishment and free initiative of
groups and movements of elderly per¬
sons and also give other age groups op¬
portunities for training in, and informa¬
tion on, the support of the elderly.
With regard to the issues of income
securityand employment ofthe elderly,
according to the Plan major differences
exist between the developed and the
developing countries and particularly
between urban, industrialized and^

^ agrarian economies with regard to the
achievement of policy goals related to
income security and employment.
Many developed countries have
achieved universal coverage through
generalized social security schemes.
"For the developing countries, where
many, if not the majority of persons,
live at subsistence levels, income securi¬
ty is an issue of concern for all age
groups". In several of these countries,
the social security programmes launch¬
ed tend to offer limited coverage: in the
rural areas, where in many cases most of
the population lives, there is little or no
coverage.
Furthermore, particular attention
should be paid, in social security and
social programmes to "the circum¬
stances of the elderly women whose
income is generally lower than men's
and whose employment has often been
broken up by maternity and family
responsibilities". In the long term,
policies should be directed towards pro¬
viding social insurance for women "in
their own right".
The Plan recommends that Govern¬
ments should work to create or develop
social security schemes based on the
principle of universal coverage for older
people. Where this is not feasible, other
approaches should be tried, such as pay¬
ment of benefits in kind, or direct
assistance to families.
Broadly related to the issues of in¬
come security, the Plan notes, are the
dual issues of the right to work and the
right to retire.
Governments should facilitate the
participation of older persons in the
economic life of the society. Ap¬
propriate measures should be taken to
ensure "to the maximum extent pos¬
sible' ' that older workers ' 'can continue
to work under satisfactory conditions
and enjoy security of employment".
Governments should eliminate
discrimination in the labour market and
ensure equality of treatment in profes¬
sional life.
Negative stereotypes about older
workers exist among some employers,
and Governments should take steps to
educate employers and employment
counsellors about the capabilities of
older workers.
Among other recommendations, the
Plan states that measures should be taken
to help older persons to find or return to
independent employment by creating
new employment possibilities and
facilitating training or retraining. The
right of older workers to employment
should be based on ability to perform the
work rather than on chronological age.
Despite the significant unemployment
problems facing many nations, in par¬
ticular with regard to young people, the
retirement age for employees should not
be lowered except on a voluntary basis.
The section also includes recommen¬
dations on the need for satisfactory
working conditions and environment,
measures to prevent industrial and
agricultural accidents, and protection
from occupational diseases.
Governments should take or en¬
courage measures that will ensure a
smooth and gradual transition from ac¬
tive working life to retirement, the Plan
states, and in addition make the age of
entitlement to a pension more flexible.
Such measures would include "pre¬
retirement courses" and lightening the
work load during the last years of work¬
ing life for example by modifying the
conditions of work and the working en¬
vironment and by promoting a gradual
reduction of work-time.
The section on income security and
employment also contains a provision on
the needs ofelderly migrant workers. Ac¬
cording to the Plan, measures should be
taken to guarantee migrant workers
social coverage in the receiving country
as well as maintenance of social security
rights acquired, especially regarding pen¬
sions, if they return to their country of
origin.
Another provision deals with the
needs of elderly refugees. On this ques¬
tion, the Plan states that as far as possi¬
ble, groups of refugees accepted by a
country should include elderly persons
as well as adults and children, and ef¬
forts should be made to keep family
groups intact and to ensure that ap¬
propriate housing and services are
provided.
Regarding education for and about
the elderly, among other recommenda¬
tions, the Plan states that education is a
basic human right, and must be made
available without discrimination
against the elderly. It further states that
"there is also a need to educate the
general public with regard to the aging
process".
Governments and international
organizations concerned with the prob¬
lems of aging should initiate pro¬
grammes aimed at educating the general
public with regard to the aging process
and the aging.
