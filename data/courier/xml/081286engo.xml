PU8L1CATION OF THE UNITED NATIONS EDUCATIONAl, SCIENTifiC AND CULTURAL ORGANIZATION
VOLUME III - 3 PRICE : 10 Cents (U. S.). 6 Pence (U. K.). or 20 Francs (FRANCE). Ier APRIL 1950
'In my time, Monsieur, one did not succeed'
OFFICIAL neglect, or positive abuse and persecution, were the lot of such artists as Cezanne, whose self portrait is shown above, and of Monet,Courbet, Renoir, Whistler, Gauguin and Manet. Edgar Degas spoke for them all, when he said bitterly, toward the end his life,'''IN MY TIME,
MONSIEUR, ONE DID NOT SUCCEED". Cezanne himself had to spend his energy, precious to the world, in attempting to break down barriers of
academic hostility which kept his paintings from the public. He denounced"the unfair judgment of men to whom I have not given the authority
to judge me". The only reply to this protest made by one of the greatest men in the history of world art, came from a long-forgotten official
who told Cezanne that to give public sponsorship to works not acceptable to the academicians would be"inconsistent with the dignity of art".
Today, art concerns not only the artist, but all the people. If the artist"does not succeed"-the people do not succeed. Unesco has there-
fore raised the question with the artists of the world, HOW ,IS IT IN OUR TIME ? For some of their answers, see pages 6 and 7.

UNESCO ACTS TO FREE BOOKS, ART,
FILMS FROM CUSTOMS CHARGES
Customs officials will stand aside and the beauty, wisdom andknowledge to be found in books, paintings, sculpture, music
and films will pass more freely from the creators to their
audience,'when the newest Unesco-proposed international agreement
is ratified by member states. For example, publications whose
price is currently increased by as much as 300 per cent will be
stamped"DUTY FREE", as the agreement enters into force. The
draft, already approved by delegates from 25 member states in a
two-'week meeting-in Geneva, covers books, newspapers, periodicals
and other publications. It also provides exemption for paintings,
drawings, sculpture and museum materials.
In a message to the Geneva Con-
ference, M. Torres Bodet, Unesco's
Director-General, declared :"No
protectionism could be more short
sighted than that which"protects"
the minds of people from the ideas
and attainments of the rest of the
world".
The text of the proposed interna-
tional agreement on the Importation
of Educational Scientific and Cultu-
ral material will be submitted for
adoption to the General Conference
of Unesco to be held in Florence,
Italy beginning May 22. If appro-
ved, it will take effect thereafter as
soon as it has been ratified by 10
nations.
Under the Agreement, approved
organizations would be freed from
tariff restrictions in importing
films, film-strips, microfilms and
recordings of an educational, scien-
tific or cultural character. Newsreels
would also be allowed to enter duty-
free.
In addition, scientific instruments
or apparatus for educational or
research purposes, if they are not
manufactured in the importing
country and if consigned to appro-
ved institutions, would be allowed
to move across frontiers without
payment of duty.
Among the other provisions of
the Draft Agreement is the grant-
ing of foreign exchange for the
importation of books and publica-
tions consigned to public libraries,
and publications and other articles
for the educational advancement of
the blind.
Easier Customs Clearance
Contracting States to the Agree-ment would also undertake to
facilitate the expeditions and safe
customs clearance of educational,
scientific and cultural materials and
to continue their common efforts to
promote the free circulation of
these materials.
The new Draft Agreement i-'
based on a text suggested to Unesco
by the 34 countries participating in
the Third Session of the Contrac-
ting Parties to the General Agree-
ment on Tariffs and Trade, which
met last year at Annecy.
Mr. A. R. Ashford, of the United
Kingdom, was Chairman of the
25-nation Unesco Committee, which
produced the revised Draft Agree-
ment.
In transmitting the text of the
Draft Agreement to M. Jaime Torres
Bodet, the Committee expressed the
view that, if adopted by the General
Conference of Unesco and ratified
by Member States,"this Agreement
will help substantially to redure
economic barriers hindering the cir-
culation of educational, scientific
and cultural materials".

A joint campaign by Unesco and the World Federation of United
Nations Associations to help the cause of peace by better teaching
about the vital importance of the United Nations has been further
advanced by a seminar recently held at Teheran, Iran.
Earlier seminars devoted to the same
purpose have been held in France,
Cuba, Italy and the United Kingdom.
Others are to take place won in Den-
mark and the Lebanon. The Iran
session was arranged especially for
secondary school teachers.
M. Jaime Torres Bodet, Director-
General of Unesco, sent a message to
the Seminar, whose opening and clos-
ing sessions were attended by the
Prime Minister, the representative of
his Majesty the Shah, and members
of the government. Five nations-

O RGANLZED on the initiative ofBran's Association for the United
Nations whose honorary president
is the Shah of Iran, the seminar was
held in co-operation with the Ministry
of Education and the Iranian National
Commission for Unesco. The work of
the 59 teachers who attended the
Seminar was directed by Dr. Mehran,
president of the UN Association's Cul-
tural Committee, and M. Sadighi, a
member of the National Commission
for Unesco.
Meetings were held each evening in
the great hall of the Archaeological
Museum where between two and three
hundred people listened to lectures by
well-known penonalities of the edu-
cational world. A film on the United
Nations accompanied each lecture.
Seminar members then divided into
study groups to discuss means of intro-
ducing information about the UN into
their school programmes.
The Iranian Ministry of Education
is publishing in Persian a collection
of speeches made during the seminar
and a report of the work of the study
groups. This means that the teachers
of Iran will now have a wide docu-
mentation on the United Nations and
Unesco in their own language. Their
task of helping to carry out Unesco's
work for international understanding
will thus be greatly aided.

"the
TEACHER'S
WORDS"
Extracts from a film
strip, produced by
Unesco's Fundamen-
tal Education Audio-
Visual Project in
China. It is one of
those being used to
warn people against
the dangers of tra-
choma and to show
them how to protect
themselves against
this disease of the
eyes.
I. Carrying a load
of firewood,
Chang Ta is walking
past the village
school, when he trips
over a stone. The
teachers and students
hear his cry of pain
and come outside to
see what has hap-
pened.
2. Chang Ta ex-
plains that he
cannot see very well
because of the illness
that has attacked his
eyes. All he can do
to make a living is
collect and sell fire-
wood.
3. Sending one of
his pupils to help
Chang Ta home, the
teacher calls the rest
into the class room
and explains the
cause of Chang's
illness.
4. Chang Ta, he
says, caught tra-
choma because he
was careless. He
did not treat it
quickly and so will
soon become blind.
5. There are four
precautions, he
explains, that one
should take to avoid
catching the disea-
se.
6. Don't use a towel
after someone
else has used it. He
may have had tra-
choma and you may
catch it from the to-
wel.
7. Do not, for exam-
ple, wipe your
face with a towel
provided in a public
place such as an
eating house.
8. Use only clean
water to wash
your face and never
wash in water that
someone else has
used.
9. Always see the
wash-basin is
clean because"the
trachoma poison so-
metimes sticks on the
sides".
Never rub your
eyes with your
hands. If they are
dirty you may easily
get trachoma.
IN. If you are care-
less and get the
disease you will not
only suffer from the
pain but also finan-
cially in paying for
treatment. And you
may be unable to
work.
The teacher re-
peats the lesson
he has taught his
pupils and adds :"Practice these four
health habits and you
will not catch tra-
choma."
FILMS TEACH
IT was market day whenthey arrived in Shih Tze
Hsiang, a woman and
three men in a car. Most
of the children were off
the streets, shouting their
lessons in the school as
their fathers and great
grandfathers had done in
their day. Everyone stopp-
ed whatever he was doing
to look. It wasn't every
day in a provincial town of
Szechuan, far in the interior
of China, that four
strangers arrived, and in a
car loaded with strange
wheels and boxes.
The four who arrived in
Shih Tze Hsiang on market
day were from Unesco's Fund-
amental Education Audio-
Visun. 1 Project at Pehpei, about
40 miles north of Chungking,
from a very different kind of
school to the one in the old
temple where the young
children were learning their
lessons. The woman in the
car was Dr Clara Nutting,
medical supervisor of the
mission, and the men were
Hugh H u b b a r d, Unesco's
Regional Representative in
China, and two members of
the Pehpei Mission, Wang Te-
wei and Fan Wei-Ch'uan.
As they drove along the streets
they looked and finally found
a place to set up an impromptu
outdoor film theatre which
would also be the school for a
lesson so many of the people
of the town and countryside
needed to learn-how to
recognize, to prevent and take
care of the illness of the eyes
called trachoma. Trachoma
is one of the most widespread
diseases in China, whose
people call it"Sha Yen"
(sand eye) because the pain it
causes makes its victims feel
as if grains of sand have got
into their red-rimmed water-
ing eyes.
Putting over
health lessons
But this is only one ofChina's health problems.
Large numbers of the people
must be shown the need for
small-pox vaccination, the use
of D. D. T., the importance of
safe drinking water and the
vital roles of proper sanitation
and protective medicine in
the fight for health.
All these aims are included
in the project at Pehpei,
where film strips, posters,
pamphlets and other audio-
visual materials for funda-
mental education are prepared
and later tested during visits
to towns and vlllages In
Szechuan Province.
The visit of Dr. Nutting,
Hugh H u b b a r d and their
assistants to Shuih Tze Hsiang
was typical of many others
which have enabled them to
find out the most effective
ways of"putting over"the
health lessons, lessons which
will later be used on a growing
scale elsewhere in China, and
by educators in other parts of
the world.
A few hours after their
arrival in the town, the mem-
bers of the Pehpei Mission
were unpacking their equip-
ment. By now they had the
help of two members of the
Chinese Mass Education
Movement, Dr. Chiang and
Nurse Hsiung-field soldiers
in the war of modern science
against the old plagues of
endemic and epidemic illness
in the Chinese countryside.
Children stood around,
watching with delight as out
of the car came a generator,
a transformer, a gramophone
and equipment for filmstrip
projection. Some of the
children, and the grown-ups
who watched from further
away, didn't see as well as
they should have ; they had
trachoma.
F
Story 01 Wantl San
in a II y everything wasr ready. About 1000 towns-
people and farmers, young
and old, were in the impromptu
theatre in front of the ancient
temple whose stone step made
an excellent gallery. Hubbard.
Wang and Fen Wei-ch'uan put
on the show. First there was
Chinese music. Then ai :
educational filmstrip about
the Pehpei mission's fight
against trachoma was shown.
The film brought to many
children, women and men
with sore eyes a simple tale of
what they needed to do to be
cured and to prevent others
from suffering.
Filmstrips on trachoma
shown by the mission in the
towns and villages have very
simple scripts telling, in a
way that every villager can
grasp, of the dangers of the
disease and how these can be
avoided. One, for example,
tells the story of Wang San, a
clever carpenter, who caught
trachoma from public towels
he used to wipe his face each
time he visited a tea house.
The towels had been used
previously by people suffering
from the disease. Wang San
neglected his eyes until it was
too late to cure him, became
blind and so lost his job.
Then, because he and his wife
used the same towel, she also
caught the disease. However,
with proper treatment, as the
filmstrip illustrates, she was
cured.
As the filmstrip ends, the
commentator gives some final
advice to the audience :
"Friends, p'ease rem. ember :
Do not use public towels to
wipe your eyes. When your
eyes feel wrong do not touch
them with your hands, but go
to a doctor for treatment. Use
your own towel and ww ; h
your face with clean water in
a clean basin to protect your-
self and others from becoming
blind."
Next morning Dr Nutting,
Dr Chiang and Nurse Hsiung
set to work. The impromptu
theatre of the previous night
became a medical consulting
room. And here sitting at
three tables they reaped
the harvest of the seeds
of knowledge that the
filmstrips had sown. ash
morning, they greeted towns-
folk and farmers, examining
their eyes, giving them treat-
ment, registering their cases.
Most of those who came had
sore eyes. In the afternoon
232 children from the school
were examined. Only 26 per
cent had trachoma and three-
fourths of the cases were mild ;
but the fifteen bad ones
proved to the doctors that
there would be much blindness
in Shih Tze Hsiang unless the
Unesco team could get into the
homes and show the need for
clean habits.
While the doctors were at
work, a loud speaker set up
near them explained what was
going on, told men and women
who had not seen the film-
strips the night before why the
examinations and treatments
were important. Posters were
also put up on walls of streets
far from the old temple
square, but the strongest
appeal was the fact and the
sight of the doctors carrying
out their mission of teaching
and helping in front of the
unseeing eyes of the old
temple gods.
Dice field cinema
In the evening of theirsecond day at Shih Tze
Hsiang, the Unesco health
educators went with their
school-theatre equipment to
another primary school two
and a half miles away. This
was in the courtyard of the
home of the local representa-
tive of the Chinese Mass Edu-
cation Movement. But the
courtyard was too small for
the 550 persons who wanted to
see the filmstrips, So the
screen was set up in a recently
harvested rice field by the side
of the road.
Although there was a drizzle
of rain the next day, farmers
on their way to the Pi Shan
market stopped to have their
eyes examined at the open-air
clinic which had been as usual
set up. Of the 87 children in
the school 39 had trachoma.
Before the team from Pehpei
left Shih Tze Hsiang another
programme of filmstrips was
given and again more than
1000 persons watched, listened
and learned.
The results of visits to
test the effectiveness of the
materials produced by the
Unesco project team have
been so successful that it has
been decided to continue the
work, which should have
ended in 1949, until the middle
of 1950. When it finally ends,
a report will be published and
samples of the materials made
available to the governments
of Unesco's Member States.
"Best wishes for good health"saye this Chinese Calendar for 1950. pre-
pared by Unesco's Fundamental Education Audio-Visual Project at
Pehpei. But as good health tems from habits rather than hopes, the
Calendar illustrate some of the do's and dons which can make every
Chinese village"a healthy village".

ON BEHALF OF 7, 000, 000 BLIND...
UNESCO EXPERTS PAY TR ! BUTE
TO LOU) S BRA) LLEr-----i
Millions of blind persons are today able to"see"because LouisBraille, a young Frenchman and himself blind from the age of
three, evolved a method of raised character writing which more
than any other step has helped to free the sightless from their prison
of perpetual darkness.
The debt owed to Louis Braille by
the world's 7, 000, 000 blind persons
was expressed on their behalf last
month by a group of men and
women who met at Unesco House it
Paris for the International Braille
Conference. Using the Braille sys-
tem as a basis for their work, the
delegates began to discuss on March
20th how best to work out a single
unified system of writing for the
blind men and women in all parts
of the globe.
But before these discussions
began the 21 delegates-more than
half of whom were blind themsel-
ves-spontaneously agreed to con-
clude their work by a visit to
Coupvray, the little town in the
Seine-et-Marne Department where
Louis Braille was born in 1809.
Their symbolic pi) grimage was
intended both as a tribute to Braille,
liberator of the blind, and Braille
as a man of exceptional courage

HUMAN RIGHTS EXHIBITION OPENS
IN HAITI
This year, Port-au-Prince, capital of the
Republic of Haiti, is celebrating its bi-cente-
nary with an international exhibition in which
Unesco is participating. To present the story
of Human Rights to the people of Haiti,
Unesco shipped exhibits to Port-au-Prince
which were a reproduction of the Human
Rights Exhibition it organized in Paris, last
year. (For more details see the February
issue of the"Courier", Volume III, N. 1.).
The photo below was taken outside the
Unesco pavilion at the official inauguration
of the international Exhibition at Port-au-
Prince in February. It shows, M. Dumarsais

pavilion.
who refused to accept the often
helpless and hopeless life led by
most blind persons of his time.
Jungle of World Languages
When he was ten, Braille beganstudies at the Institution Na-
tionale des Jeunes Aveugles in
Paris. An ardent musician, he learn-
ed to play the organ and became
organist at a Paris church. It was
when he was a professor at the
Institution that he undertook the
task of evolving a system of writing
for the blind, using as his starting
point, the work already done in the
same field by Captain Charles
Barbier, a young cavalry officer.
In 1829, Braille published the
system of writing which since then
has brought new hope and a new
life to millions of handicapped men
and women who have been taught
to"see"with their fingertip.
Five years later he presented deve-
lopments of his method, but it was
not until two years after his death
M. Jaime Torres Bodet, Direc-
tor-General of Unesco, speak-
ing to the International Meeting
on Braille Unilormity, at Unesco
House, on March 20th :
"There is something deeply
moving about this ingenious
script, those raised dots on the
paper by which the world's
thought is brought to the fingel'-
tips of the blind. Some civiliza-
tions seem inaccessible to others
simply because of their peculiar
alphabets, but the blind, at least,
have a chance of overcoming
such barrier."
in 1852 that the method was
generally accepted.
In 1878 the International Confe-
rence of Workers for the Blind mat
in Paris and adopted the policy of
using Braille and its adaptations as
a basis for efforts to bring writing
for the blind in all the world's lin-
guistic areas into a workable rela-
tionship.
In the present jungle of world
languages, with their multiplicity
of scripts and alphabets, the experts
are seeking the most practical pos-
sible approach to uniformity in
writing for the blind. By so doing,
the blind will, to some extent at
least, have taken a step beyond their
sighted brothers and sisters.

went to press a special ses-
sion of Unesco's Executive
Board began an overall review of
Unesco's 1951 programme, prepared
by the Board at its session in Feb-
ruary for presentation to the
General Conference in Florence,
next month.
This programme follows a new
pattern, outlined by the Unesco
General Conference in Paris last
Autumn. A"basic programme"
defines the main lines of Unesco's
work for several years ; a state-
ment of methods describes the
means Unesco can use to imple-
ment its programme and a series
or resolutions defines in detail the
activities to be undertaken in 1951.
The extension of sections of the
programme to Germany and Japan
in 1951 is also outlined.
The 1951 programme was desi-
gned by the Board to be carried out
on a budget of $ 8, 000, 000-the
same figure as for 1950. Although
the Board approved the programme
for submission to the Florence
Conference at its February meeting,
it also decided to hold a special
session in March to make any final
adjustments. (A report of this
meeting will be given in the next
issue of the Courier).
During its earlier meeting, the
Board also completed arrangements
for the Florence Conference. It
decided to extend invitations to the
Conference to observers of the
occupying authorities in the Eas-
tern and Western Zones of Germa-
ny, accompanied, if they wish, by
experts of Germany nationality.
It also approved a credit of
$ 40, 000 to allow Unesco to main-
tain until the end of 1950, its
assistance to refugee children in
the Middle East. Other programme
activities discussed by the Board
included the sending of a mission
of experts to Ecuador to advise on
fundamental education experi-
ments in the areas recently devas-
tãted by an earthquake. Finally
it decided to recommend to the
General Conference the admission
to Unesco of three countries, the
United States of Indonesia, the
Republic of Korea and the Hashe-
mite Kingdom of the Jordan which

TECHNICAL ASSISTANCE :
. \
A TWO-WAY TRAFFIC by pearl S. Buck
WE are today approaching the dawn of a worldwide renaissance.
Never before in history has the whole world, at one time, come
W within the range of such potentiality. Throughout centuries
there have been interchange and mutual stimulation between
sections, regional responses which brought Chinese ideas as well as goods
to Greece, and Greek ideals and art to China. The similarity between the
philosophies of a Jewish Jesus and a Chinese Confucius are not
accidental. Greece had her day in India, and Persia made the amalgam
But today is unique. Perhaps any
age seems unique to those who live in
it, and yet I think that we who live
now have a peculiar right to use the
word.
Never before has the earth been a
whole, as it is today, nor has it tap-
peared So to as many people. Slowly
everywhere men and women, often
unwillingly it is true, are coming to
understand that peoples cannot be free
of one another.
This understanding is the basis of
what has come to be called the"tech-
nical assistance programme"of the
'Reluctantly even the prosperous are begin-
ning to understand that"backward peoples"
must be educated, the underdeveloped areas
developed... Once begun, we may trust to
the peoples, however backward they may be
considered, to shape the process as it goes
on, and in that shaping we shall all be
modi&ed."
United Nations and such Specialized
Agencies as the Food and Agricultural
Organization, the World Health Orga-
nization and the United Nations Edu-
cational, Scientific and Cultural Orga-
nization. Sooner or later, depending
upon economic pressure from peoples,
the world will function as one.
Reluctantly even the prosperous are
beginning to understand that"back-
ward peoples"must be educated, the
undeveloped areas developed, if not for
their own sake then for the sake of
those who wish to maintain their pre-
sent standards of living. Countries
such as the United States, which pro-
duce more than their people can buy,
at least at present prices, must be able
to sell to outside peoples, and those
peoples must be educated to the point
of wanting the new goods and develop-
ed to the degree of being able to buy
them. Crudely put, this is the vague
idea behind much of the planning to-
day.
Greater Western Change
ONCE begun, we may trust to the
peoples, however backward they
may be considered, to shape the
process as it goes on, and in that shap-
ing we shall all be modified. It will
be impossible to have the Chinese
peasant educated without his also edu-
cating us. The Chinese have educated
more people than have ever educated
them. India has already shown the
unconquerable independence of her
mind and spirit.
In the contact that is now inevit. : tble
between the peoples of Occident and
Orient the greatest change will come
in the Occident. It will not be so
visible, at first, as the change in the
Orient. A refrigerator is a mon-
strously visible thing, but the change in
a man's attitude toward life is far more
important and powerful.
Nearly everyone recognizes that in
all countries there are spots of modern
civilization, individuals of profound
culture. There is no lack of admir-
ation for these, no unwillingness to
grant their superiority. In the average
American, for example, there is today
a humility almost touching toward
such figures as Gandhi and Nehru.
Humility and wistfulness promptly
disappear, however, when we contem-
plate the hut of the Indian peasant,
the dusty village home of the Chinese.
One reason why we are sometimes un-
able to grasp the greatness of the saint
or sage is that we can consider the in-
instruments of his life absurd. When
Gandhi drank goats'milk and ate
boiled spinach and a handful of beans,
few of us understood or believed that
he really preferred to do this, and that
to him it was a better way of life than
roasted meats upon a silver spread
table.
The Worldly Wise Folk
WE must not think that the people
sometimes spoken of as.. back-
"ward"consider themselves so
for one moment. The Chinese, while
pleased to observe western machines,
will be discriminating in his choice and
use of them and will not permit irrele-
vant gadgets to complicate his life.
Having achieved the height of sophis-
tication, which is the ultimate in sim-
plicity, it is not likely that the ancient
peoples of the East'twill allow their
ordered lives to become confused by
machinery not adapted to their needs.
The backward peoples are, in fact,
not backward at all. Being old, they
are clever and intelligent and worldly
wise folk, whether or not they read
and write.
Literacy has not been a necessity for
developing the mind, among most of
the earth's peoples. The mind deve-
lops itself, if it is there.
I believe in universal literacy and
consider it the primary duty of such
bodies as UNESCO to bring it about,
for only when the world's peoples are
all literate can there be world commu-
nication through literature and news.
Universal literacy is essential for
peace and understanding. To the in-
dividual mind it adds resources, but it
is not an essential. Some of the wisest
and most sophisticated minds I have
known belonged to persons who cod
not read and write and were far less
backward actu. a. lly than I was myself.
Peace and Better Roads
Iris a widespread myth that the
chief problem of the Chinese people
is hunger. This is not true. The
primary need is not for food, but first
for peace and then for better roads.
China has or can have plenty of food.
She has the richest soil in the world,
generally speaking. Anyone who lived
in China before the last war must have
been impressed daily with the wonder
and variety of the food markets.
China is a land rich in food and the
Chinese are generous feeders. Their
famines have always come not from an
actual shortage of food but from di-
sasters such as flood, drought, or war.
Communications are so poor that food
cannot be supplied from another region
quickly enough or easily enough to
mend local damage. It was actually
cheaper, in the last famine in which
I took part in relieving, to ship grain
across the Pacific Ocean from the
United States than it was to carry it
on donkey and man h3. ack from another
province three hundred miles away,
where there was plenty fo food for
sale.
China needs roads. A network of
good motor roads and the vehicles to
use on them in addition to a few vital
railways and airlines would solve her
food problems. Her agriculture is
THE DAMODAR VALLEY PROJECT
India has planned and is putting into effect
a project to control the Damodar river and
its tributaries and to use them to irrigate
lands, exploit minerals, work factories and
turn the valley into a prosperous land. The
figures above illustrate the improvement in
irrigation, power and food production that
can be expected under this scheme of tech-
nical development.
highly developed. Modem agriculture
has not much to teach the Chinese
farmer, beyond some methods in seed
selection and insect and disease con-
trol.
Nor is land distribution a primary
problem in China. In spite of much
talk to the contrary, comparatively
little of China's land is in the hands
of big owners. The average farm IS
small and intensely cultivated. The
lesson we must learn is that the CM-
nese are not backward at all.
India is very different indeed from
China. There the agriculture is
really undeveloped, and the soil has
not been made to adapt itself to the
difficult climatic conditions. I shall
never forget my dismay once when
visiting India in February to discover
that in spite of heat, in which crops
could certainly grow and mature, vast
areas were dry and useless, supporting
not even the bone-thin cattle that
"China lacks good roads."'41n India vast areas are dry and useless for lack of water."
These then are two priority needs that technical assistance must help to satisfy. Already a
start has been made by Asiatic countries on the"selfahelp"basis. Here. a party owt sura
veyors is mapping out the area of a projected dam on the KOllar River. India.

wandered upon their surfaces. Water
was the lack. Yet to-day there need
not be lack of water anywhere.
Science can and should work to pro-
duce water from reservoirs and seas,
and deep wells can be driven by coope-
rative means.
Need to Serve Mankind
PRIMARY in the Eastern countries,
too, and especially in China, is
the need for the development of a
spirit of service to mankind, which will
provide satisfaction sufficient for
educated young men and women to be
willing to undergo the isolation of
living in country places. In addition
to the skills taught in great modern
medical centres, where every facility
has been developed, we need even more
the greater skills which can teach a
graduate of such a centre how to use
what he knows in an Indian or Java-
nese village, where he must fashion
his own tools and build his own hospi-
tal.
And will there not be more people
then than the earth can support ?
This is said often and much discussed,
but actually it is the master myth of
our times. Robert Owen, the great
English industrialist, said in his book,
A New VIew of Society, published
in 1812,"The fear of any evil to rise
from an excess of population until
such time as the whole earth shall be-
come a cultivated garden, will, on due
and accurate investigation, prove a
mere phantom of the imagination, cal-
culated solely to keep the worker in
unnecessary ignorance, vice and crime.
... It is the artificial law of supply and
demand, arising fro the principal off
individual gain in opposition to the
welbeing of society, which has hi-
therto compelled population to press
on subsistence."
Truer words were never spoken,
truer to-day than then. A smalJ
but honest group of scientists today
are struggling to make themselves
heard in corroboration of what Robert
Owen said more than a hundred years
ago. They are tellinr us that the earth
is not overpopulated, that far more
food can be grown on the land, that
the sea is a vast storehouse of food
scarcely touched, that science has only
just begun to produce food.
Great Unused Lands
ALL large countries, including the
United States, have great unused
territories, not to speak of the
areas which are carelessly and wicked-
ly farmed. South America is scarcely
touched agriculturally. It is said that
Brazil alone, if adequately farmed,
could feed the world. Even in China
there are lands which could be used
for food and are idle. In India, as I
have said, the land is producing a
minimum of what it could. The same
is true of Australia.
While I do not believe that there are
any backward peoples, I know that
there are great undeveloped areas in
our world. The emphasis needs to be
put upon the development of these
areas, physically in communications,
food and public health ; mentally in
literacy and cultural interchange, and
spiritually in mutual understanding
and willingness to sacrifice. I know,
too, that there is the means for this
development, and it is simple in action.
This is the purpose and meaning of
"technical assistance".
The United Nations and its agen-
cies can direct the development of food
and plenty, with young men at their
command. Of public health we know
well enough how to drive major
diseases from the globe. James Yen
in China has devi : ed and proved a
simple means to literacy, and others
have done as much in other countries
We are ready to march forward, as
soon as, in the words of Robert Owen,
"the artificial law of supply and dex
mand, arising prom the principal if
individual gain in opþosition to the
wll-b9zng Of sXiety", allows it.

UNESCO courier - page 6
AT various times, every country has been the scene of fierce contro-
versy over the freedom of creative-artists and the difficulties they
meet in their work. T  ascertain what measure of fre dom exists
for artists today, Unesco sent a detailed questionnaire to writers,
painters, dancers, musicians, actors, sculptor. and scenario writers
living in its Member States.
The replies it received were later used as the basis for studies and discus-
sions by a committee of experts which met in Unesco House, last February.
This committee had as its members, M. Castrol Lea). Mexican Delegate to
Unesco (chairman). George Auric, the French composer, Gino Severini,
the Italian painter and critic, Philip James. of the Arts Council of Great
Britain, Krishna Hebber, the Indian poet and Frederik Prokosh, the American
writer.
After discussing the replies to the questionnaire, some of which are
included in the articles on this page, these experts framed a series of re-
commendations for improving the material and moral freedom of artists
and a draft Artists'Charter, for submission to Unesco's General Confe-
rence which meets in Florence next month.
Wherever it has been necessary to designate or identify a country,
it must be understood that the artists concerned are speaking of
their own countries. These statements do not imply that the artist
is less free in these countries than in others. What is important is
that some, perhaps even most of the comments may apply to the
country in which you are reading this story.
ARTISTS-HOW THEY LIVE IS HOBODY'S BUSINESS
IT is normal and expected for a work of
art, whether picture, symphony, poem,
statue, novel or medal, to find recogni-
tion and honour. In speeches and
press it is haiied, along with"culture", as
an expression of the soul of a nation, as a
justification for man's sojourn on the
earth.
So far so good. But the twentieth cen-
tury cares relatively little for the creators
of those same works of art to which, singly
or as a whole, we attach such importance.
The interest and concern that are lavished
on art are denied to the artist. There are,
it is true, a few painters or writers who, in
later life, find themselves in easier circum-
stances-a tardy reward for their years of
struggle.
Financial recognition comes much more
easily to music-hail singers and film actors.
But those whose work will go to enrich the
museums and libraries of tomorrow are
lucky if they escape the sneers of their
contemporaries. How they live is nobody's
business, to use a popular phrase.
Official opinion has another name for
that indifference : it cans it"freedom".
Artists are absolutely free to write, paint,
sculpt or compose ; but the poems are not
sold, the pictures are not shown, and
where are the statues ? The painter has no
studio, the composer and the poet cannot
pay (as pay they must) to have their works
printed. They cannot pay their rent,
either, Is that what freedom means ?
"BETTER TO STOP WORKING"
S freedom is, to say the least, some-what abstract, and we should hesitate
to dwell on its theoretical nature-
sometimes so tragic-but for solemn assu-
rances by people who say that"poverty is a
good school"and "genius will out". Here
are some of the views expressed by artists
in answer to Unesco's enqu'ry.
A poet says :"I write what I like, but
have to pay all publishing expenses out cf
my own pocket."
A painter :"I am given no encourage-
ment, eilher private or official. My sole
inspiration is my own wretchedness."
A writer :"In my country many writers
are living in dire poverty whilst publishers
and booksellers grow fat on lhe proceeds
of their works."
One grievance is common to them all :
"Our profits are minute, and we are faxed
as though they were hUge and regular, on
the ground that we are exercising a liberal
profession."
Even those authors that seem most suc-
cessful, whose books are published in
large number, would therefore support
Hpnri Trovals statement :"The incidence
of taxation is appaHin. q. Once you reach a
certain figure, is better to stop workinq."
Jean Cocteau admits :"we are. ground
under taxation to the point of discourage-
ment.'.'the engraver Jean Chieze says ;
"The artist is forced by taxation to stop his
output at a certain point" ; and Glenway
wescott :"The present system of taxation
is unfair tO writers ; it puts obstacles in the
way both of their artistic development and
of their integrity."
"BREAD AND BUTTER JOBS"
Advice often given to writers and artistsis :"why don't you earn your living
some olher Il'ay and pursue your art
in your spare time, free from financial
worries ?"
Some artists have already done so, and a
few of them are pleased with their choice.
Pierre Hamp, who published a large num-
her of volumes on"La Peine des Hommes"
(The Tribulations of Mankind) depicts him-
self as a former pastrycook's assistant,
deputy station-master, factory inspector
and civil engineer, and declares :"The
writer must subject his vocation and his
'personality to his ideal and sacrifice all
else fo the attainment of that ideal."
To the majority of artists, however, a
"bread and butter job"is a slavery that
robs them of opportunities for the pro-
longed reflection and careful attention to
detail required by any work of art."You
cannot write a symphonv in your spare
time", says a young musICian ; and many
an artist will flnd his own case reflected in
the following lines by a French writer :
"For twenty years I have followed a
profession, and I realize that the exercise
of another profession is the greaiest obsta-
cle to creative writing. But to give up
that second profession may mean starva-
If he managed to get the marble in spite
of all and finally made a statue, would
that work of his hands be free ?
Hardly more so than he is, it seems.
CURTAIN OF OFFICIALDOM
WrITERS, painters and musicians are. unanimous on this point : both
usage and laws are a hindrance to
the circulation of works of the mind.
A curtain of officialdom in many countries
- chaotic laws on copyright, customs bar-
riers, sales at a loss owing to the greed of
certain persons involved, mysterious admi-
nistrative complications-seems to cut off
the artist from the public that he once
hoped to reach.
An Israeli novelist, Zalman Schneour,
complains of "customs and financial re-
gulations under which books are treated as
ordinary goods and subjected to clearing
and quota restriction". A Swiss painter,
the disposal. of painters, sculptors and
engravers.
"Should aid for writers come from the
State ?" asks Henri Pourrat."It should
come rather from an independent body,
concerned exclusively with thought, art
and freedom. Surely some better organi-
zation of the book trade could be tried ?"
Accommodation problems are common
to all branches of art. One writer may say
that she needs nothing but"a, table, af
pencil and some paper", while others com-
plain that they have nowhere to put their
books. Sculptors and painters are particu-
larly hard hIt ; they search in vain for stu-
dios ; both in America and Europe owners
are accused of letting their studios to"any
one but artists". But who is going tO
build ?
Many poets, painters or musicians like
the Swiss violinist Paul Druey hope that
our present-day world may he brought to

THE ARTIST ANI
Modigliani, who with such painters as Utrillo.
Derain, Vlaminck. and Picasso renewed"paint-
ing at the start of this century, once sold his
canvases in the cafes of Paris-for one franc
each. He died at the age of 34. and with his
death came wide public recognition. Even at
his funeral collectors approached his friends,
offering high prices for his paintings.
tion, for society takes no interest in the
fate of artists. Well, I have given up my
second profession ; I have begun my real
life work at the age of 40 ; and I shall try
not to starve." (Maurice Toesca.)
FREEDOM TO WORK
To be free is to have full freedom ofaction. To the writer and the artist.
this means conditions that will make
it possible-in the physical sense, to begin
with-for him to create the work that he
has resolved to bring to completion. Thus
a French writer, Andr6 Dhõtel writes :
"Obstacles seem to be put in the way of
the very exercise of thought. Time in
which to work is not recognized as a
normal requirement. The need to exercise
a second profession makes it impossible to
embark on a task of any length ; whilst the
lack both of time and of means prerents an
ar/equate storing up of knowledge. Where
such freedom obtains, there is no place for
study."
And this is what two Indian painters
say :"brushes, paints an canvas are very
expensive. I am often unable to buy
them." (Mahitosh Biswas.)"We have nu
gallery." (Azurat Ullah Khan.)
Then, an American composer, Arne Old-
berg :"l would have to spend a thousand
dollars on getting my symphony per-
formed."
There is no end to the cases that might
be quoted, but they all fit in with the
remark of one sculptor, who has to work
for a firm of monumental masons in order
to keep his family :"If I were less tired in
the evening, I should be free to do my own
word: and if i hay some money left at the
end of the month, I should be free to buy
some marble."
Pietro Cuieva, says :"The problems raised
by customs regulations make it more and
more difficult to hold exhibitions abroad."
The sugestions put forward by artists
for remedymg the situation are indeed sur-
prisingly similar. Only a few are dif-
fident, like the American W. H. Auden,
who says :"l'imagine that no one is going
to pay any attention to what artists say."
Some propose positive measures, and, if
these should appear to some as beyond the
realm of possibility, they quote instances
from both the present and the past.
They demand, for example, that young
artists should receive more effective help
than scanty fellowships or arbitrary re-
wards. Musicians shoud be given grants
to enable them to have their works printed
and performed at concerts ; and exhibition
halls should be placed free of charge at
'1894 EXHIBITION-Ist PRIZE'
Official taste in the latter part of the l9th
century preferred this kind of art to the work
of the Impressionists.
acknowledge that"art is necessary to
public life, and the artist should be consi-
dered as a defender of civilizations".
They therefore ask that the State should,
help the artist to obtaIn his instruments off
work, and enable him to exercise his art.
As in the Middle Ages, their thoughts turn
to the municipalities, of which many have
indeed revived excellent traditions :
"The town of Zurich has made a rule
that 25 per cent of the cost or constructing
new public buildings (administrations, :
schools, hospitals, swimming-baths, etc.)
shall be earmarked for the visual arts, i.e.
for orders for mural paintings, stained-
glass windows, mosaics and sculptures."
Zurich is fortunately not the only town to
give proof of such a generous spirit, and it
IS to be hoped that the practice will be-
come general in many countries..
TWO INTERNATIONAL PROBLEMS
THE reform of copyright and the aboli-tion of customs barriers are intern-
tional problems."unesco can gice
valuable help in connection with the pro-
blem of copyright", writes Harrison Kerr,
professor of composition in Oklahoma."I
am convinced that if Unesco can get all
countries to accept universal copyright le-
gislation, it will have done a great work..."
Unesco has already gone to work on this
problem. Ever since its establishment, it
has been examining the copyright law of
various countries, and is preparing an.
international convention under which the
interests of artists and writers will at least
he reasonably protected.
Moreover, negotiations are well advanced.
for ensuring the free movement from
country to country of books, works of art,
films. gramophone records and, generally
speak'ng, any objects that can be consi-
dered as cultural. These negotiations have ;.
resulted in the drafting of an international
agreement.
When this has been signed bY a suffi-
cvent number of governments, artists will
discover, to their astonishment, that their
works can travel without payment of the
exorbitant customs duties that are the sub-
ject of such bitter complaint today
These measures, alone, cannot of course'
completely remedy the situation of the
artist. But they will help enormously to
make the freedom of the artist more real,
more effective. As a result, he will be
able, to quote one sculptor,"to talk without
laughing of that freedom that costs us so
much...".

TO FREE ART, FIRST FREE
MENUS'MINDS
ARE there one or more censorship controls in your country and what
form do they take ?"
This questi n has b en put by Unesco to the writers and artists
01 five continents. Censorship is all awesome word, carrying our
minds bank to half-forgotten stories of historical struggles for freedom of
thought and expression.
It will always be branded with the stigma of governmental tyranny, reli-
gious intolerance, militarism and the social imperatives. Men who live for
art, whose one aim is frankness and independence, are bound to find
censorship a galling encroachment of authority on the freedom of the mind.
Yet it would be idle to attempt an
analysis of this problem solely on the
replies to the Unesco questionnaire.
Some authors who volunteer detailed
information on the circulation of their
works, unfair taxation or the lack of
gime, landscape artists no doubt enjoy
t11e utmost freedom of expression.
They may in all sincerity imagine
that under a different government they
would still paint nothing but lands-
capes.
Cervantes lived most of his life in extreme poverty. And it was iai prison (above) where he was
sent for debt that the already famous but impecunious author wrote part of Don Quixote. The story
is told of two young Frenchmen, who at that time met the Bishop of Toledo and asked how
Cervantes was taring. On being told of his misfortunes one Frenchman remarked that a man of
such talents deserved better treatment. The other, however, intervened."He needs to live under
difficult conditions in order to produce such masterpieces,'"he  said. The only person never to
be consulted on this question was, naturally, Cervantes himself.
professional unions, are silent on the
subject of censorship, or merely voice
vague misgivings. This might be ex-
plained by some apprehension of be-
coming unconscious victims, or else,
maybe, a reaction against the unexpec-
ted bluntness of the questionnaire !
Obviously, the effects of censorship
vary with the poet and the painter,
the novelist and the architect, the
young beginner and the acclaimed mas-
ter. Even under the most harsh re-
But we must look deeper into the
special meaning censorship has for
those who close their eyes to the
complications of what they generously
call politics : to them censorship
means no more than attacks on
journalists and pamphleteers, which
they quite naturally feel have nothing
to do with them. Admittedly, if cen-
sorship were confined to wartime
safeguards of public morale and pa-
triotism, there would be no grounds
for complaint.
But we are concerned with peacetime
democratic government.
"Our government is above reproach
so far as censorship is concerned" ; re-
ported one lady-the author of books
which attack no prevalently accepted
attitudes, and which have therefore
been immune from attacks by those
possessing such attitudes.
State's Undoubted Right
YET all States reserve an unchallen-geable right-sometimes
expressly mentioned in their
Constitution-to impose silence on
all who abuse the freedom of speech
(though the exact meaning. of.'abuse"
is not always defined).
Thus, the United Kingdom Arts
Council, reports that, in Great Britain,
"the Lord Chamberlain has unlimited
powers of censorship in the theatre,
both as to the script and to the pre-
sensation". But in every country, there
is some such control of public morals,
normally exercised without any strong
protest.
Most writers and artists of every na-
tionality are fully aware of the bar-
riers society places in the way of their
freedom. R. Ulises Pelaez, a Bolivian
author, speaks of political censorship
in the following terms : "there are
unacknowledged forms of censorship-
religious, social, patriotic and military
land, above aM, that dtctated by econo-
mic interests".
Hundreds of his fellow writers tell
the same story, and here are some of
their remarks, which the Courier is
quoting.
From one country a painter reports :
"The Rector of the University, who
controls the exhibition halls, has ban-
ned the hibition of both nude and
seni-nude figures... when I have
written articles on raising the stan-
dard of art and have shown reproduc-.
tions of Picasso, Matisse, Jankl, Adlcr,
etc., I have had letters protesting that
I am corrupting the youth..."
A compatriot of his tells Unesco :
"In writing stories, the natives of my
country must only appear as servants
and cannot have individual lives, fami-
lics, etc. They cannot have parts in
play".
The reader's prejudices naturally
are commonly stimulated by those of
the shopkeeper :.'A great number of
booksellers", reports a famous author,
"refuse to sell my works, not so much
on account of their contents as because
of my social and political background".
Individuals react in endless dif-
ferent ways to the same situation.
According to Dos Passes :"There's a
certain intermittent censorship-
grounds of"decency", which is often a
prevailiny censorship of the fads and
fashions of the moment. On the whole,
there is less censorship in the USA at
the moment than is normal in human
societies".
Glenway Wescott, on the other hand,
holds that in the same country"there
are various groups organized to oppose
and persecute. writers for any real
boldness in this field (subject matter,
sexual behavior)".
Very Essence of Folly
THE film world, the meeting ground
of art and industry, appears to be
a special disappointment to ar-
tists who stand for independence and
aesthetic values. Maxence Van der
Meersh, author of the novel "Corps et
Ames", protests that.'film companics, s
utterly ignore the moral right of au-
thors to control film adaptations of
their'works".
For centuries ignorance and bigotry
have tried to stifle genius and despite
the consolatory praise that is lavished
on the dead, their methods have often
succeeded. Yet, to make assurance
doubly sure, the censors also resort to
ridicule. If we cannot refuse to see and
hear, we can at least laugh at what we
do not understand.
This is the very essence of folly.
Painters, sculptors, writers and com-
posers ail agree on this aspect of cen-
sorship, pointing to complacent igno-
rance as the one eternal enemv. A
painter wriles :"The greatest disad-
vantage here is the general lack of
cultural awareness and appreriation of
any form of'art".
Another painter says :"Many peo-
ple... believe that the real'national'art
of this cOuntrY is the art of sunlit
landscapes and that any art referring
to human problems is unhealthy". Si-
milar warnings are issued by artists
of every country.
must educators be expected to free
men's minds unaided ? Does such free-
dom mean merely the removal of those
traditional evils :' intolerance, prejudice
and ignorance ? Or is there yet another
obstacle to intellectual and aesthetic
freedom-the uncertainty of peace ?
"Present conditions arc not all that
matter", says René Barjavel, a French
writer..''We also have to reckon with
the future."
Honoré Daumier (1808-1879). one of whose lithographs is shown above. was a giant
among those artists who have known how to instill both authenticity and striking huma-
nity into their works. Oil painter. water colourist, draughtsman, sculptor and lithographer,
he was obliged to use up in pot-boiling, an energy he would have preferred to use in
a more individual realization of his artist's desires.
When he died in 1901. Henri de Toulouse-Lautrec left a large
number 01 drawings, 350 lithographs of amazing quality and
over 500 paintings. But, as this Paris theatre programme
lor 1893 shows, the initials''TL frequently appeared on
posters and other commercial publicity materials.

ARAB HOSPITALITY. We went down into the reception cnve. carpeted
with rich rugs. on which we sat cross-legged. And by the light 01
acetylene ilares, in a long-drawn-out, speechless ceremony we
drank tea."
THEY HOPE TO
HARNES'S THE STUN
OMEN, camels and don-
keys are the beasts of
burden of the Sahara.
And one enduring me-
mory 1 shall have will be a
caravan of women, with
camel-loads of wood on their
shoulders, filing over the dunes
in the heat of noon.
Another will be an Arab in
his burnous on a nickel plated
bicycle cycling to work in a
coal mine in the Sahara.
These two impressions are
not unconnected and have an
important bearing on my in-
quiry into what can be done
to arrest the advance of the
aesert and restore cultivation.
As we know with shivering
certainty the Sahara can be
excruciatingly cold and, apart
from keeping warm at nights,
the nomads have to find fuel
for their cooking. Wood is
scarce.
These women, about twentyof them. were nearly forty
miles from their oases. In
search of fuel, they will trek
for a week across the desert.
When they find it, they hack
the trees and destroy them ;
and with their destruction the
desert wins another victory.
The patch of soil breaks up
into drifting sand which in
turn may bury another fertile
plot.
So fuel for the desert 15 a
necessity only less important
than water.
And here, west of Colomb
&char, is a coal mine in the
midst of the desert. It em-
ploys 4, 500 miners and pro-
duces 30, 000 tons of coal a
month. It is not a pit. The
coal is mined by galleries
driven iBJto the decline of the
seam from the outcrop on a
hillside. Absenteeism must be
quite a problem because the
Arab miners are still nomads
who, when the floods come in
the oueds (intermittent rivers),
trek back to their valleys and
plough and sow their patri-
monial lands.
The seam at Kanadsa is only
16 inches thick and the coal
is inferior, but it serves for the
power-station which heats and
lights Colomb Bechar, is used
in the cement works, and hauls
the desert train. There is
also an export trade to Spain,
a thousand miles away across
the Atlas.
But another much bigger
seam, both in extent and in
thickness and much better in
quality, has just been discover-
ed about 40 miles farther into
the desert to the south. These
are remind'ers of the vast pri-
meval forests which once co-
vered this area.
Wallace says that there is
oil in the desert. And Wallace
ought to know. He is one of the
modern"men against the de-
sert". This geologist from
Oklahoma, six-and a half feet
tall, with buffalo shoulders and
a plaid shirt, has spent two
and a half years roaming the
Sahara with an Italian, a
Swiss, an Englishman and a
Scotsman, in two trucks and a
jeep (12 broken springs a
month) looking for oil for an
American oil company.
Sotar atomic Fite"
H 18. pet subject is not oi)but solar energy. Har-
nessing the sun may
seem an eccentric idea under
the clouds of Britain, but out
here every scientist (including
Wallace, who is a very good
one) is obsessed by it.
If one suggests that maybe
one day atomic piles will pro-
vide the Sahara with its
energy, they point to the sun
and say :"That's our atomic
pile. If the physicists would
work on that instead of bombs,
give us a reasonably efficient
solar engine, and tell us how
plants store the sun's energy
so tbit we can have solar bat-
teries for the hours oj dark-
ness, we could harvest the Sa-
hara."
They could stop the destruc-
tion of soil-binding vegetation
as fuel and have power to bore
and to pump water for irrig-
ation. Because everywhere they
tell me"We are walking on
water". At Zelfana (Lat.
32° 20"N., Long. 4° 25"E.),
there is a new oasis supplied
from a well nearly 4, 000 feet
deep. But its importance is
much more local. It proves
the existence Of a vast under-
ground lake, which stretches
from the Atlas far into the
Sahara and elst to Gabes, on
the coast of Tunisia.
This"Albienne Layer"as a.
source of water has been the
speculation and dream of geo-
logists for over half a century.
Many attempts have been
made to tap it and to prove its
extent, but they all failed until
the water gushed from Zeal-
fana.
Boring to such depths needs
energy, and oil for the drillers
is expensive in the Sahara.
Maybe the sun could be used
to do the boring.
By Ritchie Calder
Science Editor of the London
News Chronicle
Ritchie Calder, Science Editor of the London News Chronicle,working in collaboration with the Natural Sciences Depart-
ment of Unesco, is making a personal survey of the work
going on to reclaim the deserts of North Africa and the Middle
East for human use. He is not only carrying out an important
investigation, but a unique educational and reportorial task of
explaining to the men and women of many countries what can be
done to make the deserts useful so that they will agree to support
and help carry out the necessary measures.
The series of articles Ritchie Calder is writing for his newspaper
is being distributed to newspapers throughout the world by Unesco
and the information he gathers is being used in the preparation
of textbooks and filmstrips for schools. The results of his studies
will be widely used in school courses in England dealing with
history, scripture, economics, geography and current affairs.
Last month, the Unesco Courier published three reports from
the Algerian Sahara where the survey began. On this page are
reprinted the next three stories in the"Men Against the Desert"
series, in which Ritchie Calder deals with other aspects of the
struggle against this classic desert of all deserts, and reports
on what is being done to reclaim the wastelands of Tunisia.
THE holy man of the
t marsh sent a turbaned
negro barefoot to inter-
cept our convoy and to sum-
mon us to his cave."Summon"does not convey
the sociable invitation to
drink ceremonial green tea,
but it had the weight of a
command for the engineers
who are planning to remove
the marsh from underneath
his feet. For the mvabout
(M u s 1 i m saint) of Ain
Skhouna has mystical sanc-
tions over the people of an
area as large as Belgium and
to offend him might be se-
rious. So we headed the
jeeps across the marsh to the
mound-near-the-hot-
spring (which is what"ain
skhouna"means) and were
received by the white-robed
marabout surrounded by his
brotherhood.
Then he led us to his Mara-
bout (which is the name for
the holy place as well as the
holy person). The hut of
sun-baked, whitened bricks
seemed too small to receive us,
but this was only the vesti-
bule of a network of caves.
We went down into the re-
ception cave, carpeted with
rich rugs, on which we sat
cross-legged. And by the light
of acetylene flares, in a long-
drawn out, speechless cere-
mony we drank tea.
All this took place in a
great Swamp--Chott ech Cher-
gui or Southern Marsh which
is cradled between the Tell-
Atlas and the Sahara-Atlas
and is the site of one of the
warid°a most imaginative and
ambitious projects. It will
cost at least t 120, 000. 000.
Into this basin, a fifth of
the size Of France, 2, 500 feet
above sea level, drains or
seeps the seasonal rains which
deluge the two mountain sys-
tems. During the few brief
spasms in the wet season (as
I have seen) the Chott is a
KASSERINE (Tunisia)
TT'ASSERINE was a battle-fields. It still is. During
the war, this was the
scene of disaster both for the
Allies and for the Germans.
Today, a new battle is be-
ing waged ; massive machines
trundle across the valley. Men
dig in and shots are fired.
Searchlights play in the Afri-
can darkness. But the only
adversary is the desert itself.
Kasserine stands strategic-
ally at the end of a pass which
is a junction in the mountains,
giving access north and south,
east and we : t, but it is also a
centre of the Lost Lands.
The Lost Lands are whnt I
have been investigating in Tu-
nisia. These lands are not true
desert. Tunisia is not arid. Its
coastal belt shares the Medi-
terranean I'njnfall and the hin-
terland is by and large semi-
arid, with limited and inter-
mittent rains.
It does not need M. Sauma-
gne, the Tunisian Inspector-
General, with his lifetime
study of past civilizations, nor
shallow sea. Within a few
days, the sea has vanished
and there remains a treache-
rous, salty crust. What hap-
pens to the 14, 000 million
cubic yards of water which
pours down on this catchment
area ?
It is a problem which has
intrigued geologists and hy-
drologists (water scientists)
for a long time, but it was
M. Gautier, chief of the Scien-
tific Bureau of the Algerian
Service of Colonisation and
Hydraulics, who suggested the
answer which may make Ciiott
ech Chergui one of the won-
ders of the world. This
"man against the desert"
made his observations by air.
He decided that the Chott was
a great evaporation pan
which not only"steamed of !"
the surface rain (which is
useless anyway because it is
salted by the soil) but sucked
up and evaporated water from
the deep artesian layers.
NATURE'S WATER TANK
THE sum began to make
sense. Allowing for the
immediate loss through
evaporation in the mountains
and for the tiny fraction of
water yielded up in the wide-
ly-scattered wells of the Chott
basin (like the Hot Spring
itself). there must be under-
ground a vast reservoir reple-
nished annually by over
1. 000 million cubic yards of
water. And most of that
must evaporate through the
Chott.
The water is there and the
first charge will be to spread
man-made wells over the
desolate steppe where
20. 000 nomads drive their
flocks and camel herds across
the sparse pastures of desert
weeds to natural wells over
days'marches apart. It will
mean better vegetation, trees
for shade and better animals.
It will mean new oases on the
High Plateau.
But that is not the most
ambitious scheme. It is pro-
posed to shift the water of the
Chott to the rich but thirsty
fertile coastal plains beyond
the Atlas. At first it will be by
pumping the water through
concrete channels and tunnels
through the mountains for
fifty miles to the River Taht,
on which a barrage is already
being erected to distribute
this constant water supply to
the coastal belt. But the
second phase to be attempted
later, is even more ambitious.
It will dispense with pump-
ing and, instead, will tunnel
under the mountains and
under the Chott itself and
will draw the water, before it
evaporates, from the under-
ground reservoir.
The drop from the level of
the Chott to the coastal plains
will mean a terrific head of
water which will supply as
much electricity as Algeria at
present uses. It will bring
into rich, constant cultiVl1. tion
250, 000 acres of good land and
in addition slake the thirst of
the barren piateau.
All by stopping the desert
from perspiring !
MODERN TROGLODYTES
IN THE"LOST LANDS"
M. Tixeront, the chief engineer
of the waterfinding service, to
tell me that this is a man-
created wilderness. The evid-
ence of its past productivity is
there in abundance.
But I saw some of the worst
erosion I have met on this trip.
Great gullies and collapsing
hillsides scarred a desolation
which had once carried the
trees and herbage to tame the
rains and knit the soil..
MAN-MADE WILDERNESS
WE came to Kasserine byway of Sbeitl  and Kai-
rouran. Sbeitla was the
ancient Sufetula. Gregory, the
viceroy at Carthage of the By-
zantine Emperor, declared him-
self Emperor of Africa and
discreetly retired to the hinter-
land to build his own capital.
Sbeitla includes in its vast
ruins, preserved by the sands
of centuries, pillars from Ro-
man Carthage.
These ruins tell eloquently
the tragedy of the Lost Lands.
The Byzantines, threatened by
the Berbers (who killed Gre-
gory) and they, beset in turn
by the Arabs, turned their
homes into fortified granaries
with blind outside walls and
entered only by a ladder. The
land became only furtively
cultivated and declined into
wilderness, ranged by foraging
nomads.
That is what schemes like
Kasserine are designed to re-
dress. It was begun after the
Spanish Civil War as relief
work for three thousand refu-
gee Republicans. They started
the work on a barrage to di-
vert the waters of the Dherb
into channels where they could
be best used to irrigate the
land.
As living quarters the Spa-
niards dug themselves spacious
caves and became modern tro-
glodytes. It is disconcerting to
look up at an engineering feat
like the suspension bridge
which carries the conduit
across the gorge and find
family of well-dressed cave-
dwellers peering at you out of
a hole in the cliff-face.
Only about 50 Spanish fami-
lies remain but the work the
refugees started is beginning
to blossom in the decent in
which they settled.
Looking down on Kasserine
in the moonlight, M. Sauma-
gne said to me :"tell me that
there are ten men in the world
who believe that the desert
can be made to bear trtl. 1. t and
redeem the stupidities ot man-
kind, and 1 shall die happy."

MEN WHO FIGHT FOR WORLD'S RIGHT TO HEALTH
THE observance of a World Health Day on April 7 is not
for the specialists alone. Its main purpose is to bring
home to everybody, sane and sick, layman and profes-
sional, the direct bearing of health on other main pro-
blems of our time, and the inter-dependence of health condi-
tions in all parts of the world.
The World Health Organization exists to drive home this
lesson. UNESCO collaborates in this task through its Natural
Sciences, Mass Communications and Education Departments.
Some months ago UNESCO, for example, was responsible
for the world distribution of a series of IS articles on cancer
today, written for the New York Herald Tribune by Lester
Grant, who was later awarded the Peabody Prize for the best
science journalism in J 949. These articles were distributed
free to leading publications in all Member States.
THERE will be speeches-and stories in the papers-and there willbe public ceremonials, and the giving of medals and prizes ; there
will be lectures in the schoolrooms and dramatic programmes on
the radio-to help celebrate World Health Day, April 7. Some of the
best celebrations, however, will be on the sports fields of the world,
where young people play soccer, pelota, cricket, baseball, hockey, tennis,
basketball, throw javelins, run and jump.
They will celebrate in this way because they are alive. (Many of
them wouldn't be, save for the great international flow of medical
knowledge during the past few years-even during the past few weeks
or days). Fewer of them are disfigured ; fewer are blind, than would
have been the case even several years ago. A relatively small number
of them have had small-pox.
Only 200 years ago small-pox attacked more than 80 per cent of
mankind, and disfigured, crippled, blinded or killed one person in every
four in every nation. Today this disease is fully under control in the
more advanced countries. There are still, however, many unvaccinated
persons throughout the world.
In 1946-7 there was an epidemic of small-pox in Rangoon with a
death rate of 30 per cent, and in Hong Kong at the same time 530 people
died out of 820 who went sick. The main centres of infection are in the
less developed areas of the world.
It has been estimated that each year malaria cause* the d. aths of 3. 000.  peoples. To attack
this problem on a world scale, the World Health Orgcmiscrtion has organised joint campaigns
with the governments of many countries. In this photo Greek peasant women watch as a
team sprays their house with D. D. T. Experts from W. H. O. supervising this work during the
recent fighting in Greece had a significant experience in a lonely farmhouse one night. They
opened the door to find some partisans pointing rifles at them. The doctors feared the worst
until the partisans expiained that they wanted theiI"hide-outs"sprayed with D. D. T.
But while victory has been won over smallpox, there remain other
diseases which take their toll of mankind-as smallpox once did-in
terms of millions of lives. Tuberculosis, for example still kills between
3 and 5 million people each year.
In India alone, in 1944, nearly 2 million deaths were caused by
malaria.
Disease knows no frontiers, and we must therefore fight it wherever
it appears. The peoples of the world recognize this and that is why
the World Health Organization (WHO) came into being.
Nils Blaedel, science editor of the Copenhagen newspaper"Politiken"
recently went to WHO headquarters in Geneva. Here, in his own words,
is a glimpse of what he found :
"'Working in the Palais des Nations in Geneva is a group of practical
people who believe they can help bring peace to this troubled world.

SCIENCE AND MAN : 1950
J Ut. IUS CÆSAR could send a letter just as
swiftly as Napoleon could. As late as
1834, Sir Robert Pe l, c lled post haste
from Rome to London by a Cabint
crisis, took 13 days for the journey-preci-
sely the time allowed for a Roman official
18 hundred years ago. Today, anyone can
travel between these two capital cities is
two days hy rail and cross-channel steamer,
in six hours or less by airplane.
This is an example of the way in which
the application of scientific knowledge is
changing our lives.
Harvard's Professor Kirtley F. Mather,
President-elect of the American Association
for the Advancement of Science, discusses
some aspects of the international and social
implications of science in a report specially
written for Unesco's Division for the Popu-
larization of Science.
Vividly he shows, for example, how science
accelerates the rate of change :
PEOPLES ARE CLOSER
"TOUAY, everybody is aware of changeThe cont ast between the ways of
living at this mid point of the twen-
tieth century and at its beginning is vividly
recorded in the mind of every elderly person
and reported in vigorous words to every
yougster.
"Responsible for this is the application of
scientific research to everyday life. But this
is by no means as well understood and as
widely known as it should be."
The new technology of travel, transport
arid communication has resulted in the
peoples of the world being brought closer
together-in technological terms. This has,
however, led to an increased dependence
upon the natural resources of the earth.
maKe uiem acuve woria
citizens. Their task, on a
score of fronts, is to fight
disease-the mental and
physical enemy of man.
"These men and women
are members. of the World
Health Organization, whose
member states have united
in accepting the definition
of health as a state of com-
plete physical, mental and
social well-being. For
them, health is a positive
thing-not merely the
absence of disease and
infirmity.
"The WHO was born in
1948. Since then it has
fought for the attainment
by all peoples of the highest
possible level of health, in
the belief that their health
is decisive for world peace.
"Is this merely an empty
phrase, an international
cliché ?
"BACK TO HORSE AND BUGGY WAYS"
P IWFESSOH Mather'shows how, as peoplehave taken dvantage of the contribu-
tion of science and tecllllology to 1111-
man comfort and efficiency, there has been
an increase in energy requirements. We
are now dependent upon coal, petroleum, na-
tural gas and water power."Cut off the
supply of mineral fuels, and most of us
would have to revert promptly to the horse
and buggy ways of a century ago", he says.
with the increased dependence of man upon
the earth's mineral and agricultural resour-
cues, there has been a tremendous increase in
population.
"It is against the background of facts such
as these that the social implications of
science must be examined", says Professor
Mather."Especiall)'in this time of rapid and
drastic change, it is imperative that men of
intelligence and goodwill give careful consi-
deration to the social trends resulting in
whole or in part from the impact of science.
It would appear that in the long history of
geologic life development, man is the first
creature possessing the ability to determine
his own destiny."M. G.

Health Organization.
"MAN HIMSEI.. F
IS GREATEST
CHALLENGE
Or. G. Brock Chisholm,the canadian psy-
chiatrist responsible for the
health of the Canadian
army during the last war
and now Director General
of WHO, has an answer to
this question.
.,'if we utilize the know-
ledge we have today', he
says,'this ought not to be
merely a phrase, but the
facts at the root of the
problem are disagreeable
ones. Today, the greatest
challenge to humanity is
man himself. Throughout
human history men have
been fighting wars. Yet we
must not accept this as the
nature of things.
..'pother expressions of
human nature have under-
gone basic changes. Why
then cannot this ? We may
not be able to completely
change human nature, but
we can modify it in the
right direction. The res-
ponsibility for trying to
safe-guard the human race
against itself rests with
science. Together with
other. sciences, psychiatry
must try to shape another
'ftuI future humanity. The
WHO : will try to stimulate
this tremendously impor-
tant task.
"'But mental health is
only one half of the world
problem. We have experts
combatting avoidable dis-
eases which every year
claim hundreds of millions
of victims, whose sufferings
prevent them from co-
operating as active world
citizens. We co-operate
with our sister organization,
Unesco, in this international
peace work. Half the people
in the world are illiterate,
and in underdeveloped
areas where campaigns
against disease are carried
on Unesco and WHO are
fighting together for a new
and better civilization'".

LE COURRIER DE L'UNESCO-Page 10
As for the museums,"with the exception or that
in Istanbul, they have all been established in recent
years. Previously, a country's treasures went
abroad, but today these museums, thanks to recent
excavation, contain fine and growing collections.
Finds which can be moved are fairly divided, so
that both the cottntry of origin and that or the
excavators gain prom each discovery".
The palaces of Istanbul and the mosques of
Ispahan are regaining their ancient splendour.
Syrian frescoes are being restored to their original
beauty. The bas-reliefs found in Persepolis will
be preserved on their original sites. In the museum
at Bagdhad, the remains of a 7, 000 year-old civili-
nation can now be studied by school-children. As
Education advances, the peoples of the East are
themselves bringing to light their cultural heritage.
There is, however, a big task ahead. The
excavation, strengthening, restoration and safe-
guarding of such finds are extremely costly.
Archaeologists often work in isolation, museums are
short of money and there are still too few techni-
cians. International co-operation, however, can
provide the help, which is needed, reports M. van
der Haagen.
Buy (awarding study feUowships to young archaeo-
logists from the Near East Unesco has already given
a lead in such collaboration. More opportunities
of this sort must be provided, as they can be, by
the generosity of the wealthier nations, all of
whom owe some debt to those lands which were
once"the cradle of Western civilization".
RE ( ; LAIMS ITS CULTURAL
B E B IT AGE
FOR thousands of years, men strove to
mould the face of Asia and, later, the
shores of the Mediterranean. From
Sumer to Islam, from Egypt to Byzan-
tium, succeeding civilizations destroyed or
mingled with one another, each leaving
behind some trace of its passage. Temples
towns, palaces, records and pottery, statues and
paintings, accumulated like great alluvial
deposits.
It was only about three hundred years ago
that artists and, later, scientists began to delve
among the ruins. They came from the Ne-
therlands, France, Italy, England, Germany,
Poland or Russia and, later on, from America,
each expedition vying with the others in
knowledge and resource. In this.'scramble
for discoveries"archæologists set out to explore
history in the same way as pioneers opened
up Africa or the Far West of the United States.
They brought to the East their insatiable
scientific curiosity, their historical sense, and
their constantly improving technical resources.
Ranging from the work of Champollion to that
of Arthur Evans, from the Luxor excavations
to those at Persepolis, expeditions-famous
and obscure-transformed the study of ar-
chaeology, enriched the world's knowledge of
its past, and brought to life long dead civili-
zations.
The removal of the treasures they found
saved many of them from destruction, but, in
the excitement of their discoveries and their
anxiety to learn from their finds, few of the
scholars had thought seriously of how to de-
monstrate their value or to teach how they
might be preserved.
Apart from their aesthetic qualities, these
archaeological treasures meant little more to
the uninitiated than a date or a mysterious
name on a map. Thus there was a danger
that the net result of some discoveries would

be a tragic loss for the artistic heritage of the
East, with no real gain for the world as a
whole.
A Universal Message
T ODAY that danger has passed. Modern mus-
eums enable us to follow the development
and inter-relations of bygone civilizations.
The archaeologist's message is a universal
one, and the results of his studies are avalfable to
all. Moreover, the peoples of the near East many
of whom have only recently regained their indepen-
dence, have realized the great cultural value of the
treasures hidden in their cities and villages, their
mountains and deserts. And they are more than
interested in this wealth of history ; they have
taken it into their care.
Foreign missions, whose technical and financial
assistance is still required, are now collaborating
with local authorities. A clear picture of this
radical change in attitude has been reported by
M. van der Haagen, Head of Unesco's Museums and
Historical Monuments Division, following a trip he
made recently to Turkey, Persia, Lebanon and Syria.
"In most of these countries", he writes,"there
are local specialists, many of whom have been
trained in Europe and the United States of Am-
nca. Everywhere, one finds officials in chCJ1'ge of
antiquities who are enthusiastic and energetic..."
Fifty years ago, Pierre Loti. the French writer exclaimed
"what a dismal ruin', as he stood before the MadrCJse Mader

PURPOSE and SCOPE
of ART FILMS
TODAY the cinema isbringing art within
easy reach of millions
of people in much the same
way that radio has
for music. Films on art are
not a new innovation, but
until about ten years ago
most of them were of the
documentary type intended
to'''cultivate''the spec-
tator.
Then, producers in a num-
ber of countries, especially
those in Belgium and Italy
began to use new techniques
which enabled even people
without an expert knowledge
of art to"look inside"the
art being filmed where before
they had only looked at it
mechanically.
Evidence of the rapid and
widely international deve-
lopment of such techniques
was given two years ago when
many of these new art films
were screened at the first In-
ternational Congress of Art
Films in Paris.
Even greater progress has
been made in the last two
years, and when a Second In-
ternational Congress met in
Brussels a few weeks ago, its
delegates-producers, art
historians, critics and museum
curators-were able to see
and judge over 40 films pro-
duced since 1948.
To serve or use art
ONE cf the most important
tasks of the recent
Brussels Congress was to
define the scope and purpose
of films on art. Some
delegates maintained that
films should serve the cause
of art by strictly didactic
means ; others argued that it
was quite permissible for
producers to give a personal
interpretation of art to use it
to serve new ends.
Most art films produced to
date have dealt with painting,
sculpture and engraving-in
short, the visual arts. The
Congress agreed, however,
that there was no reason why
the scope of films on art
should not be extended to in-
clude music, dancing or even
poetry. This was reflected in
the final definition of art films
which the Congress declared
were those"contributing to
the knowledge, study or disse-
mination of all branches of
art".
Firstly, there are films which
contribute to a knowledge
of art such as documentary
films for the general pu-
blic ; for example the French
film"Cesaree"showing the
remains of a Roman city in
North Africa.
Then there are those which
assist the study of art and
which may be linked with art
history or criticism. An excel-
lent example of this group is
the Belgian aim"Rubens"
made by Paul Haesaerts and
Henri Storck.
Finally, there are those
films whose function is to
disseminate art, and this ca-
tegory includes all films
which, while based on a work
of art, give a free, imaginative
interpretation of it. In"L'Evan-
gile de la Pierre", for example,
Andr6 Bureau relates the life
of Christ through the medium
of sculptures in different ca-
thedrals.
Films, however, should not
One of the most important
results of the Brussels Con-
gress was the setting up of
the Council of the Internatio-
nal Federation of Art Films
This Council was asked to
consider, in consultation with
the International Federation
of Film Archives, the setting-
up of a central reference film
library. It was also asked to
study means of promoting the
production, sale and distribu-
tion of art films.
Between their meetings.
delegates to the Congress
were shown films from 15
countries. The following short
descriptions of some of these
give an idea of the wide field
covered by producers of art
films.

"Saga in Stone" (In-
dia) presents a splendid
gallery of sculptures.
Although the film might
be criticized on the
grounds of technical de-
fects, the material treat-
ed is so rich that such
drawbacks can be readily
overlooked.
Switzerland brings a

The"diabolic figures"or Brue-ghel, Bosch, Grunewald and
others are depicted by Carlo
Castelli Gattlnara and Enrico Ful-
chlgnonl in their'''Demoniaeo

of which IS Temptation through
Fear.
Dekenkeleire's"Les Metiers
d'Art de Flandre et de WaUo-
nie" (Belgium) depicting the
achievements of art craftsmen, Is
a glorification of work as the
maker of beauty. The beginning
and end of the film are in geva-
colour and throw valuable light
on this new colour process.
Poland has produced a highly
interesting documentary on the
ancient lake city of.'Blskupin",
where relics of the bronze age
have been discovered. The pro-
ducer, Stefanowski, may be con-
gratulated on a flawless piece of
work.

Such films showed that produ-
cers are seriously facing their
two-fold task of providing an
Instrument for research and a
means of spreading culture.
NEARLY 400 theatre groups
throughout the United
state, ranging from big
Broadway companies in
New York to small community
and school troupes in 45 states,
staged plays in March in
observance of International
Theatre Month. The celebra-
tion, sponsored by the Ameri-
can National Theatre and Aca-.

INTERNATIONAL THEATRE MONTH
demy in co-operation with the
U. S. National Commission for
Unesco, gave new and striking
proof that the theatre is a
living force for helping to pro-
mote understanding through
international cultural ex-
change.
The idea of a month devoted
to plays contributing to inter-
national understanding was
first suggested a. t last year's
U. S. National Conference on
Unesco. Planning is well-
advanced for a world-wide
observance next year of an
International Theatre Month
under the sponsorship of the
International Theatre Institute
(ITI) and Unesco.
Meanwhile, several countries
are already planning to hold
an International Theatre Week
later this year. In France, this
will take place in June to co-
incide with the holding in
Paris of the third ITI Congress.
Holland, Switzerland and other
ITI member countries also
plan to include theatre weeks
in existing art and music
festivals.
Last month's celebration in
America had a brilliant and
symbolic start in New York
with the world premiere of a
ballet with an international
flavour.
SYMBOLIC BALLET OPENS NAG
THIS new ballet,"Illumin-
nations", based on songs
by the French poet Ar-
thur Rimbaud was performed
by the New York City Ballet
Company. Three Englishmen
had co-operated in its creation
and presentation-Frederick
Ashton, the choreographer,
Benjamin1 Britten, the com-
poser, and Cecil Beaton, who
designed the sets.
Such major productions
formed only a part of the total
showings in 45 states plus
Alaska, Hawaii, the Panama
Canal Zone, Canada and
Japan. These were presented
by resident and travelling com-
panies, community theatres
and more than 120 university,
college, high school and
children's theatres
In Dads, Texas, theatre
audiences saw the American
premiere of"High Swing", the
first post-war comedy to come
to the United States from Ger-
majiy, written by Margo Jones
and translated by the English
playwright, AsMey Dukes.
At VMsar College, students
presented for the first time in
the United States Giraudoux's
"Electre".
Original plays, pageant,
ballets and radio and television
shows had been written by
American and foreign authors
especially for the national cel-
ebration. Each participating
group made its own choice of
the subject and form for its
presentation before its local
audience.
PROBLEMS OF UNUTO
"Home is to-morrow", a
drama hitherto un-
produced in America,
by the British author and
playwright, J. B. Priestley, was
presented in California, In-
diana, South Carolina and
Chicago. This play deals with
the problems of an imaginary
United Nations trusteeship
committee, UNUTO (United
Nations Under-developed Terri-
tories Organization).
It was J. B. Priestley who,
summing up the work of the
LT. L, once said :"A well
written play may do more
than fifty speeches by well
meaning politicians. A world.
in which an International
Theatre Institute is securely
established is a far safer and
more civilized world than one
in which the art of drama is
imprisoned between high na-
tional barriers,"
Last month's celebration
which enabled audiences from
Alaska to the Panama Canal
to fee performances ranging
from ancient Greek tragedy to
modern Shavian humour was
an outstanding effort to help
break down. barriers against
international cultural exchange
and world understanding.
A film which has already met
with much success is"Le Para-
dis Perdu" (Italy) in which Lu-
ciano Emmer reproduces the
many fascinating details of Hie-
ronymus Bosch's famous painting
"The Garden of Delights".

NEARLY 2 500 YEARS AGO
CONFUCIUS AS
SEEN BY THE
EUROPEANS
This picture of Con-
fucius is taken from
"Confucius Sinarum
Philosophus".
CONFUCIUS'the most sagely ancient teacher'
PLANNED A WORLD COMMONWEALTH
The following article on Confucius has been condensed fromone ritten by Dr. Cheng Chi-Pao, of Unesco's Education
Deportment.
IN the course of history few men
t have continued down the centu-
ries to exercise a profound
influence on the thoughts and
actions of many millions of people.
One man who has done so for more
than 20 centuries is Confucius, the
great Chinese sage, the 2500 th

compromise.
anniversary of whose birth is being
celebrated this year.
Confucius, whose teaching has
dominated the intellectual, political
and social life of China for more
than 2000 years, was born in 5511
B. C. in the ancient State of Lu-
now a part of Shantung province
- and died in 4i8 B. C. Historians
differ in their calculation as to the
exact date of his birth, but oft-
cially, the Chinese Government
fixed August 27 for its comme-
moration.
There was nothing spectacular
about the career of this political
thinker, social theorist and teacher.
He did not attempt to originate a
new philosophy, much less a new
religion, but merely tried to trans-
mit to future generations the
virtues and wisdom inherited from
the past.
\\'hile much of the external in Confu-
cianism has been swept away there
still remain in the thought and action'
of China's people many of its hidden
influences. In fact, so striking is the
identification between Confucius and
his people that it is difficult to mention
any special tenet of his without at once
recognizing it as one of the character-
istics of the people.
The basis of Confucianism rests
mainly on three great books all of
which were written or edited by his
disciples. To these, The Great Learning,
The Doctrine of the Golden Mean and
the Confucian Analect, must be added
a fourth book, the work of Mancius,
who lived one hundred years after Con-
fucius and was one of the chief ex-
pounders of Confucian philosophy.
The first of these books, The Great
Yearning, which embodies psychology,
education, science and political philo-
sophy, was the work of Tsang Sin, one
of the most profound of Confucius'
disciples.
It begins with the development of

able to ponder with care that one will
be able to reach the goal."
The Doctrine or the Golden Mean, a
great book on the exposition of the"na-
tural way'"was written by Confucius'
grandson, Tze-sze, and can be summed
up in one phrase :"In everything, he
Golden Mean is the best."-
Confucius himself said :"that
heaven ordains is called Nature. What
conforms to Nature is called the Na-
tural Way. What regulates Nature is
called Instruction."Man's duty he held
was to discover the way of nature and
thus avoid being swayed by doctrines
and dogmas. In this way would he
accord with the natural motion of the
universe and be able to live in serenity.
"The noble man is moderate in his words
but ardent in his action"
personal mind and virtues, through the
cultivation of man's social relations
and ends with training for government
leading to the final achievement of the
idea of a world commonwealth.
Holding that the moral development
of one's own person is the root of all
achievements, The Great Learning
states :"It is only when the goal to be
attained is known that the aim is fixed...
only when the aim is fixed that a calm
and steady state of mind can be achiev-
end... only when a calm and steady state
of mind. has been achieved that the
mind can be at ease... only : when the
mind is at ease that one is able to
ponder with care... only when one is
Confucianism is not a religion. Con-
fucius believed that man's attitude
towards the Supreme Being should be
one of deep reverence, but he was not
interested in such problems as the soul
or the nature of God. Speculation
about such matters was to him a
waste of time."H'e do not know li/e,
why should bother ourselves about
leath ? We have not leamd to serve
men ; how can we serve God ?" Never-
theless, he was undoubtedly a religious
man. To establish the Kingdom of God,
he considered that the right relationship
should first be established among men.
Confucius emphasized particularly
the 'development of personal virtues.
(Confucius, the Philo-
sopher of the Chin-
ese), published in Pa-
ris (1687). Some of the
earliest translations
of the Confucian
writings were pu-
blished in this book.
He believed that the nature of man is
esentially good, but that contact with
the everyday world often brings about
its degeneration. The well-being of so-
ciety depends on the right relations of
men.
He said :"Only he who has the spirit
of goodness within him is really able
either to love or to hate.""The wise
man regards the moral worth of a man,
a a fool only his position ; a wise man
expects justice, a fool, favour."
"I shall not be grieved that other men
do not know me, but I shall be grieved
that I do not know other men."when
the right relation among men is esta-
blished, it is easy to achieve a harmo-
nious family, a peaceful state, and even-
tually a world commonwealth.
This is the picture Confucius had in
mind :"When the Great Principle (an
ideal social order) prevails, the world
is like one home common to all ; men
of virtue and merit are to bel elected fo
be rulers ; sincerity and amity pervade
all dealings between man ana man ;
people. shall love not only their own
parents ana on children but also those
in politics. Not satisfied with exiting
conditions, he held up as a pattern for
his and succeeding generations the
model of a Golden Age. Looking into
the past he idealized the ancient states.
"Devote yoursel patiently to the theory
and conscientiously to the practice or
government", he said. "Without the
confidence of the people, no governement
can stand very long. Government is
good when it makes happy those who
live under it and attracts those who
live far way
Confucius was a great teacher--a
educator in the modern sense of the
word. He gave us principles of educa-
tion which are as sound today as they
were in his time. Students, he main-
tained, should be both diffusers of
knowledge and discoverers of new
truth."Learning without thinking is
useless and thinking without learning is
dangerous", he said."Know what you
know and know that you do'not know
what you do not know for that is the
characteristiG of one who knows" De-
manding earnestness and sincerity. from
his pupils, he said,"I explain nothing to

not anxious to express himself. when 1

Confucian philosophy is essentially
the study of how men can best be help-
ed to live together in harmony. Confu-
cius sought to"create a completely ho-
mogeneous community by the unifica-
tion of men's minds, a community in
which there would be general and
spontaneous agreement as regards the
objects considered worthy of desire and
in which the careless, the selfish and
the anti-social would be subdued by the
transforming influences of example and
exhortation". This is what the world
needs today and about which it can
learn much from Confucius.
Voltaire told of a philosopher friend
who kept in his study a single por-
trait-that of Confucius under which
was inscribed the following lines :
.. Without Assumption he explored the
mind."

Yet, strange, to say, his Country held

The Temple of Confucius at his birthplace,
K'iuh fow, in Shantung Province. Confucius
is buried outside the city and before his
tomb, a large and lofty mound, is a marble
stable bearing the inscription of the title
given him under the Sung dynasty :"The
most sagely ancient Teacher ; the all-accom-
plished, all-informed King."
there will be no cause for, conspiracy,
robber, the/t, or rebellion, and no need
to bolt one's outside door. This is a
true commonwealth."
But it is on the practical side of life
that Confucius has made the real con-
tribution not only to China. but also to
the entire world, both in the past and
for the future.

confusion, he was primarily interested
