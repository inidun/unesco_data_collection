MeMory of the World
Manuscripts, illuminations, archives, early films – the documentary heri-
tage of humanity is fragile and threatened. for the last 15 years, UNeS-
Co’s Memory of the World programme participates in its preservation. 
More documents of exceptional value are being inscribed in the Memory 
of the World register from 11 to 15 June in Pretoria (South Africa).

For the last fifteen years, the programme 
Memory of the World has focused on conservation and digitization 
of humanity’s documentary heritage. With UNESCO’s support, 
measures have been taken to preserve dozens of archive  
collections, thousands of meters of film, millions of pages  
of manuscripts, books and periodicals. 3

Detective work, technical progress and luck 
lie at the core of the restoration of The Story 
of the Kelly Gang, the world’s first feature 
length film. With it, Australia recovers the earliest record  
of a myth dear to its heart and part of its collective memory. 5

Some two hundred thousand ancient  
manuscripts that were disintegrating slowly but surely in libraries,  
cellars and attics in Timbuktu (Mali), today are systematically  
inventoried, preserved and digitized. These priceless treasures,  
the oldest dating back to the 13th century, are contributing  
to the rehabilitation of Africa’s written history. 7

the Matenadaran houses seventeen thousand manuscripts and 
30,000 documents, some dating back to antiquity. Texts on very 
varied subjects, written in Arabic, Persian, Syriac, Greek, Latin, 
Amharic, Japanese and certain Indian languages, are stored 
together in this museum-library, created at the same time as  
the Armenian alphabet in 405. Today the Matenadaran  
is entering the digital age thanks to UNESCO. 10

                                     for the last fifteen years, the programme Memory of the World has focused
                                         on conservation and digitization of humanity’s documentary heritage.

symbolize the history of humanity to 
the attention of a wider public. But 
the people backing the programme 
quickly came up against a contradic-
tion: the most important documents 
are not in danger because they are 
already the object of extensive safe-
guarding measures; little-known 
archive collections are the ones in 
danger. 
To reconcile these two concerns, 
the Register was established in 
1997. Every two years, the docu-
ments most representative of hu-
manity are inscribed in it. At the 
same time we launch projects to 
safeguard documents that are in 
particular need of attention. 
Many of these projects involve 
digitization, since our main goal is to 
make these documents accessible 
to the general public. For instance, 
one of UNESCO’s first projects was 
undertaken with the National Library 
of the Czech Republic, in Prague. 
It began very modestly with 
US$20,000, which allowed us to 
digitize a few collections of histori-
cal manuscripts. But this partnership 
with UNESCO motivated other or-
ganizations to sponsor projects. The 
library now has an excellent work-
shop that digitizes not only collec-
tions but also documents request-
ed by researchers – it costs about 
US$20 to digitize an entire manu-
script. The library in fact became in 
2005 the first laureate of the Jikji 
Memory of the World Prize. 
You said the programme’s  
main goal was to make 
the documents accessible 
to the general public. 
What about conservation? 
Conservation is not an end in itself, 
it is a means, a necessary condi-
tion, to allow the world’s citizens to 
have access to documentary heri-
tage. The ultimate goal is access to 
the contents of these documents, 
which before the digital age were 
generally under lock and key. How 
many people had the opportunity to 
see Gutenberg’s Bible before digiti-
A few years ago, the public 
responded very enthusiastically 
to the re-release of “Metropolis”, 
German film-maker Fritz Lang’s 
masterpiece, in its restored and 
digitized version. In 2001, it was 
included in the Memory of the 
World Register. 
It was the first film to be inscribed 
in the Memory of the World Reg-
ister. Besides its unquestionable 
qualities and the innovations it intro-
duces in special effects, costumes 
and music, this monument of cin-
ema holds particular interest from 
the point of view of conservation 
and restoration.  
The Friedrich-Wilhelm-Murnau 
Foundation (Munich, Germany), 
which owns the rights to Fritz Lang’s 
film legacy, went to considerable 
lengths to get hold of all known 
copies, extract the best elements 
and undertake a digital restoration. 
It thus gave new life to the film and 
made it possible for audiences in the 
21st century to see a work of excep-
tional quality that was filmed in 1927.
The Memory of the World  
programme came into being  
15 years ago. What inspired it? 
From the beginning, the programme 
 set itself a double goal, both to safe-
guard threatened documentary heri-
tage and to bring documents that

zation existed? Now everybody can 
see it. The programme therefore 
adopted digitization immediately. 
Not as a safeguarding measure, but 
as a means to ensure access. 
But there’s one thing to remember 
– just because you digitize a docu-
ment doesn’t mean you’ve safe-
guarded it for ever. Its conservation 
is an ongoing concern. At the same 
time, you have to preserve the digi-
tal document. Without preserva-
tion, a digital document disappears 
in ten years. 
That means that digital 
documents are even more 
fragile than those on traditional 
materials? 
Of course. A piece of parchment 
can survive for several centuries. 
Newsprint lasts several decades. It 
isn’t that the CD-ROM or the USB 
key can’t last for decades too, but 
the way in which the information 
is coded soon becomes obsolete. 
The problem isn’t the lifespan of the 
physical materials, but the progress 
in formats. 
In Yemen, manuscripts were dis-
covered in the main Sana’a mosque 
by chance that had remained walled 
up for 13 centuries! If you forget a 
digital document somewhere, at 
the end of ten years there’s nothing 
left of it. 
If we don’t pay attention to pre-
serving digital documents, we will 
leave a black hole for future genera-
tions. They’ll find Sumerian clay tab-
lets, Chinese, Arabic and European 
manuscripts and paper…and get-
ting to the 20th and 21st centuries, 
nothing! We must preserve traces 
of what we have created.
What has to be done? 
We have to begin by adopting a 
real digital conservation strategy. 
We can’t leave it to chance. Every 
country has to have an institution 
responsible for coordinating digi-
tal preservation efforts at a national 
level, to avoid either duplicating or 
overlooking things. 
At the same time, documents must 
be moved periodically from one for-
mat to another. In most documen-
tation centres and archives these 
days, what is basically a very simple 
technique is applied automatically. 
Is this expensive? 
Five dollars per gigabyte is the es-
timated annual preservation cost of 
digital information. A gigabyte con-
tains a lot of information, however, 
and the price doesn’t seem exorbi-
tant. But when you take into account 
the quantity of digital information cir-
culating in the world, which is to say 
some 12 billion gigabytes, it means 
60 billion dollars a year. This is enor-
mous. 
A global organization can’t take on 
this task. UNESCO’s role is less in 
funding than in alerting public opin-
ion, guiding and supporting countries 
to adopt policies to make it possible 
to safeguard their documentary heri-
tage, in whatever form. But every 
country has its own work to do. 
In 2003, UNESCO’s Member 
States adopted the Charter on 
the Preservation of the Digital 
Heritage. To what end? 
The Charter focuses attention on 
all the problems I have brought up. 
In a way, it pulled the emergency 
cord. It’s an official document that 
sets out general principles, but is 
not legally binding. 
At the same time, UNESCO also 
published, in collaboration with the 
Australian National Library, a large 
volume of guidelines for digital con-
servation. It deals with technical 
procedures and is available on line.

5The UNESCO Courier 2007 N°5
With American film so dominant 
across the world, it may come as 
a surprise to some film enthusiasts 
to learn that the very first full length 
narrative feature film was in fact 
made by Australians. 
Films depicting news events or 
domestic scenarios had been 
screened before awe-struck audi-
ences from the late 1800’s on, but 
they were usually no longer than 
ten minutes in duration, taking up 
just one film reel. That all changed 
when an Australian family of the-
atrical entrepreneurs took it upon 
themselves to create an hour long 
narrative film, using five reels in to-
tal, heralding the beginning of what 
was to become the feature length 
film experience. 
The Story of the Kelly Gang, in-
scribed on UNESCO’s Memory of 
the World Register in 2007, opened 
in Melbourne’s Athenaeum Hall on 
Boxing Day, December 26, 1906. It 
showed a fictionalised account of a 
real life bushranger, Ned Kelly, who 
had been caught and hanged just 
twenty five years earlier. 
The exploits of Ned Kelly and his 
band of thieves captured the imagi-
nation of Australians in Kelly’s life-
time and went on, after his death, to 
attain mythical status in the Austra-
lian psyche. Whatever violent acts 
they had committed, in a post co-
lonial context the Kelly Gang were 
seen as anti-authoritarian heroes, 
standing up to corrupt cops and de-
fending the honour of women. The 
iconic image of Kelly’s last stand 
at The Glenrowan Hotel, wear-
ing a homemade suit of armour to 
protect him against police bullets, 
continues to stir emotion in a nation 
built upon the courage, conviction, 
and as some contend, forced crimi-
nality of exiled Irish convicts.
The making and  
unmaking of a movie
Film exhibitor Charles Tait tapped 
into a universal fascination with this 
story and went on to write, direct, 
and with his brothers John and 
Nevin, produce and distribute an 
hour-long version of it. They were 
aided by other family members on 
acting duty, along with fellow exhib-
itors Millard Johnson and William 
Gibson as co-producers, technical 
advisors and camera operators. 
The Story of the Kelly Gang enter-
tained audiences across Australia 
for weeks, and a year later, played 
to packed houses in New Zealand, 
Britain and Ireland. 
Screenings took place in most 
Australian cities simultaneously, 
suggesting that at least half a dozen 
prints had been made. So contro-
versial was the subject matter that 
the film was immediately banned 
in the Victorian towns in which the 
Kelly gang operated. Years later a 
state wide ban was imposed, and 
by the 1930’s all films with a bush-
ranging theme were banned across 
Australia. The world’s first feature 
length film led directly to the first 
ever case of censorship! 
The Story of the Kelly Gang was 
not only unique for its running time; 
it also evidenced a very sophisticat-
ed use of cinematography. Scenes 
would often run for up to ten min-
utes, framing the action in a theatri-
cal manner in mid- to long shot, and 
establishing the conventions that 
would lay the groundwork for what 
was to become cinema’s most en-
during genre – the western. 
Despite its popularity, and due 
mainly to the limitations of highly 
perishable easily flammable film 
stock, The Story of the Kelly Gang 
all but disappeared by the mid for-
ties. Other versions of the story had 
been made, some of which created 
confusion amongst historians as to 
the authenticity of the original. But 
by the mid seventies, fragments 
of the Tait brother’s 1906 master-
piece began to turn up, sometimes 
in the most unlikely places.
On the importance 
of snippets
A tiny strip was found in Adelaide, 
another in Melbourne, most likely 
remnants left by local exhibitors, 
some of whom would re-arrange 
scenes, insert their own inter-titles 
or even ad scenes from out-takes.

       detective work, technical progress and luck lie at the core of the restoration 
              of the Story of the Kelly gang, the world’s first feature length film.

In 1982 someone hand delivered 
a long but severely damaged se-
quence to the offices of a film in-
dustry magazine after finding it at a 
garbage dump. But by far the big-
gest breakthrough came in 2006 
when a whole reel in near perfect 
condition was located at the Na-
tional Film and TV Archive in the 
United Kingdom. 
These snippets, together with ar-
chived copies of the original pro-
gramme brochure, helped Aus-
tralia’s National Film and Sound 
Archive reconstruct The Story of 
the Kelly Gang. Advances in digi-
tal restoration made by Haghefilm 
Laboratories in Amsterdam meant 
that recovered footage could be 
remastered, damage to individual 
frames caused by dust and dirt was 
cleaned up and missing frames 
were replicated where necessary, 
by borrowing from those that did 
exist. Even so, only 17 minutes re-
main of the original film, with some 
key scenes chemically burnt almost 
beyond recognition. 
The value of the well maintained 
programme brochures, posters, 
still photographs and press reviews 
from 1906 cannot be overstated 
– these archives have been as im-
portant as the discovery of film 
fragments in determining continuity, 
identifying characters and estab-
lishing narrative order. 
A great deal of detective work lies 
at the core of this attempt to recover 
a record of a story that looms large 
in the Australian collective memory. 
This film depicting a key historical 
event is of immeasurable value to 
Australia’s cultural heritage. A cen-
tury on, and the story of the Kelly 
Gang and its impact on Australian 
national identity is as vivid as ever.

More than 15,000 documents 
have been exhumed and  
catalogued in timbuktu thanks to 
UNeSCo. the project, funded by 
the government of luxembourg, 
has notably given support to the 
Ahmed baba documentation and 
research Centre for its efforts  
in restoration, conservation,  
commercialization and  
publication of the contents  
of the manuscripts.
T students enrolled at the University of 
Sankore camp in front of the ulemas 
reputed to be exceptionally erudite. 
In this “city of 333 saints”, the arrival 
of a number of Arab-Berber intel-
lectuals, fleeing Muslim Andalusia 
invaded by Christians, determines, 
for one, instruction of the Arabic lan-
guage and Islamic science. In 1512, 
Leo Africanus reports that higher 
profits can be made there from sell-
ing books than from any other mer-
chandise – proving the value of the 
written word. 
Today some of these manuscript 
documents have vital political sig-
nificance, as for instance the Tarikh 
el Sudan that traces the succes-
sion of the chiefs of Timbuktu in the 
15th century, or the Tarikh el Fetash, 
which does the same for medieval 
Sudan. The existence of this heri-

he key to a sizeable portion of Sa-

buried in Timbuktu, city perched on 
the crest of the Niger River in Mali. 
There, in the 15th century, at the 
height of the gold and salt trade, 
merchants and scholars are thick 
as thieves and the 25,000 African 
tage clearly refutes the stereotype 
that characterizes Africa as a conti-
nent of exclusively oral tradition.
Long forsaken  
treasures
But do the indigenous populations 
of Mali know that they possess, un-
der their feet or in their attics, hun-
dreds of thousands of vital manu-
scripts dating from the 13th to the 
19th century? Nothing is less cer-
tain. Because of a sanctified notion 
of African oral tradition, an absence 
of translation due to lack of funds 
(barely 1% of texts are translated 
into classical Arabic, French or Eng-
lish) and a certain reserve about 
rummaging through the memory of 
Africa, however honourable, gov-

ernment authorities are hesitant to 
exhume what resembles a political 
golden age. 
Let us judge for ourselves: trea-
tises on good governance, texts 
on the harmful effects of tobacco, 
pharmacopeial synopses…works 
on law (particularly on divorce and 
the status of divorced women), the-
ology, grammar and mathematics 
sit in dusty heaps in private librar-
ies or at the Ahmed Baba Docu-
mentation and Research Centre in 
Timbuktu. Written commentaries by 
the sages of Cordoba, Baghdad or 
Djenne can still be seen there. On 
screen-fronted shelves, legal acts 
regulating the lives of Jews and 
apostate Christians testify to the in-

Parchments concerning selling and 
freeing slaves, the market prices of 
salt, spices, gold and feathers are 
propped against correspondence 
between sovereigns from both sides

between 300 and 400 years,
 that’s the life expectancy  
of a palm leaf.
Between 300 and 400 years, that’s 
the life expectancy of a palm leaf. 
Which is why, for two millennia, the 
kings of Southern India would peri-
odically give orders to their scribes to 
recopy manuscripts their ancestors 
had written on these prolific but fragile 
leaves. The rajahs and temple authori-
ties made sure that the oldest manu-
scripts were disposed of at regular 
intervals according to specific rituals, 
after they had been transcribed on fresh 
palm leaves. 
The works included popular literature, 
technical and scientific manuals, trea-
tises on traditional Ayurveda, Siddha or 
Yunani medicine. Today, there are still 
tens of thousands of these precious 
palm leaves in the southern Indian state 
of Tamil Nadu alone, with more to be 
found in Myanmar, Malaysia, Cambodia, 
Nepal, India, Sri Lanka, Indonesia and 
Thailand. 
The tradition of scribes having suc-
cumbed to the onslaught of the print-
ing press, a very large number of 
manuscripts began deteriorating and 
disintegrating as of the 19th century. 
Right now, only a few scholars are still 
able to decipher the archaic script on 
palm leaves. These treasures are reach-
ing the end of their natural lives. They 
are attacked by humidity, fungus, white 
ants and cockroaches. 
In 2003, UNESCO launched a pres-
ervation project, giving priority to the 
100,000 palm-leaf manuscripts in re-
positories in southern India. A team of 
specialists has already published the 
first five volumes of a projected 25-vol-
ume Descriptive Catalogue of Palm-leaf 
Manuscripts..

in wooden or iron containers!” Not 
counting all the manuscripts stashed 
in the homes of families, who don’t 
want to give them up, either out of 
ignorance or for sordid profiteering 
reasons.
An African panorama 
rises to the surface  
of history
To pore over these manuscripts that 
have been successfully saved from 
insects and sand dust is a boon for 
the eyes as well as the spirit. The 
ensemble, generally inscribed on 
paper from the Orient (later from 
Italy) but also on sheepskin, bark 
or the scapula of a camel, is under-
lined, explained and annotated in 
the margin or on the colophon, final 
page of a book or at the end of a 
papyrus scroll where the copyist 
notes his name and the date he fin-
ished his work. Indirectly, we learn of 
an earthquake or violent brawl that 
perturbed the writing. Thanks to a 
few isolated modern translators, an 
entire African panorama rises again 
to the surface of history. The texts 
are decidedly not homogeneous, 
for good reason: though the over-
whelming bulk is written in Arabic, 
copyists expressed themselves ac-
cording to their origins – Tamashek, 
Hausa, Fula, but also Songhai, Diou-
la, Soninke or Wolof – using a com-
mon calligraphic base inspired from 
Maghribi, a cursive Arabic script, the 
form of which made it possible to 
use less paper. 
Now, how can we imagine this 
fabulous historical exploration with-
out the direct participation of local 
inhabitants, African scientists and 
national governments? This sums 
up the political challenge attached 
to the Timbuktu manuscripts, and 
beyond them, to the definitive reha-
bilitation of Africa’s written history.

ments and pieces of paper hidden in the 
ceiling. These manuscripts had been 
slumbering there for centuries. They are 
fragments of the Koran written in the 
oldest Arabic alphabet, and when they 
were first found no one could guess 
their exceptional value. 
What was this collection doing inside 
a wall? Some say the mosque rectors 
were in the habit of keeping old and 
disintegrating Koran manuscripts in 
places that were both safe and worthy 
of the sacred text. The Grand Mosque 
in Sana’a, which became from the first 
century of the Hijrah a place of learning 
and dissemination of the Koran, was the 
designated spot. Other sources argue 
that the collections were stored in a 
safe place to protect them from looting 
or destruction if invaders came. 
In 1984, the House of Manuscripts 
(Dar al Makhtutat) was founded close 
to the Grand Mosque, as part of a co-
operation project between Yemeni and 
German authorities. An enormous en-
deavor was begun to restore the Ko-
ranic fragments. Between 1983 and 
1996, approximately 15,000 out of 
40,000 pages were restored, specifi-
cally 12,000 fragments on parchment 
and manuscripts dating back to the 7th 
and 8th centuries. 
Some fragments were written in Hi-
jazi, the oldest calligraphy of the Ko-
ran, used in texts long before Kufic, 
which is the writing most often found 
in the Koranic manuscripts. Hijazi is a 
cursive calligraphy, in which accents 
and points are not indicated and short 
vowels inexistent. It is difficult to read, 
requiring complete mastery of the lan-
guage. 
Since the launching of the Memory 
of the World programme, UNESCO 
has shown its interest in the Sana’a 
manuscripts by providing the House of 
Manuscripts with conservation materi-
als. In 1995, the Organization also pro-
duced a CD-ROM in Arabic, English 
and French illustrating the history of 
the collection. Given recent advances 
in computer science, however, the CD-
ROM now needs to be adapted to the 
latest resources.

At Gayane Eliazarian’s fingertips, fine 
scissors or a brush remove time’s 
wrinkles from a page, bring out the 
carmine red of an illumination, or 
save a thousand-year-old text from 
obliteration. The workshop she runs 
restores an average of 20 to 30 man-
uscripts a year. The task is both titan-
ic and painstaking, in certain cases 
requiring several years. Ms Eliazarian 
is proud to show off a 19th century 
Russian book on her desk, sent to 
Erevan from St Petersburg for res-
toration. Proof of the Matenadaran’s 
expertise in this domain…And work 
on this kind of “recent” document is 
nothing compared to what will be 
needed for this 11th century Arme-
nian book of the gospels that Ms 
Eliazarian pulls out of the safe, where 
the manuscripts soon to be “resusci-
tated” are kept. 
When such efforts are deployed to 
preserve ancient texts, it’s best to go 
digital. “Whatever precautions are 
taken in terms of preserving manu-
scripts, you can never completely 
rule out the possibility that some will 
be physically destroyed by the pas-
sage of time. Digitizing is the surest 
means to safeguard these unique 
documents,” asserts Chouchanik 
Khatchadrian, a researcher at the 
Matenadaran.
Virtual Matenadaran: 
free admission
As part of the UNESCO program 
“Memory of the World”, a team led 
by Archak Banutchyan developed 
in 2000 and 2001 the Virtual Mat-
enadaran on the museum’s website. 
The result: the creation of a virtual 
gallery, containing more than 1000 
illuminations that can be contemplat-
ed at leisure on the site; more than 
5000 pages of manuscripts posted 
on line, with descriptions and trans-
lations from Armenian into French; 
a data base, to consult these pages 
or to search the Matenadaran col-
lection. “Our choice of documents 
to be digitized and put on line was 
guided by three criteria,” explains Mr 
Banutchyan. “First, we chose the 
pages we’d already published. Then 
our researchers identified excerpts 
that were the most representative 
of the manuscripts’ content in terms 
                       in the heart of erevan, capital of Armenia, the Matenadaran houses seventeen
                      thousand manuscripts and 30,000 documents, some dating back to antiquity. 
         texts on very varied subjects, written in Arabic, Persian, Syriac, greek, latin, Amharic,
               Japanese and certain indian languages, are stored together in this museum-library, 
                    created at the same time as the Armenian alphabet in 405.

manuscripts, the kind of illuminations, 
and so on.” 
This project is innovative because, 
as Mr Banutchayan points out, “in 
the late 1990s, we were only begin-
ning to be aware of the importance of 
internet resources and digitization in 
general.” Now we see that the project 
has made it possible not only for the 
Matenadaran scholars to make con-
tact with their foreign counterparts, 
but also to open the museum’s doors 
to amateurs from all over the world. 
A large number of the Matanadaran’s 
visitors these days first visited its 
website.
Copying by hand, 
digitizing: 
same reasoning
Digitizing represents also a significant 
advance compared to microfilm tech-
niques. “Putting manuscripts such 
as these on microfilm takes much 
longer than digital copying, which 
requires only one photo per page,” 
says Gevork Ter Vartanian, the Mat-
enadaran’s chief curator. It reduces 
the risk of damaging the manuscripts 
when they are handled – and these 
are unique documents, many of them 
Armenian translations of originals that 
have disappeared for ever. 
The same reasoning lies behind 
copying these manuscripts by hand, 
as people did 12 centuries ago, and 
digitizing them, Mr Banuchayan fur-
ther underlines. The idea is to pre-
serve a unique fragment of the world’s 
memory. Like the priest from the Lori 
region who saw how the Communist 
regime was starting to persecute reli-
gion and buried a splendid 15th cen-
tury New Testament, rescuing it from 
the threat of destruction. Removed 
from its underground hiding place 
only in the 1960s, it was brought 
in pitiful state to the Matedanaran, 
where it was restored.

a library’s  
Digital revival
After five centuries,  
most of the surviving works of the bibliotheca Corviniana 
will be under the same roof again,  
reunited in digital form
The Bibliotheca Corviniana was cre-
ated in the 15th century by Matthias 
Corvinus, king of Hungary (1458-
1490). During the Renaissance, it 
was the second greatest collection 
of books in Europe after the Vatican’s. 
It fulfilled the most modern scientific 
standards and the needs of the hu-
manists’ idea of education, including 
antique Greek and Latin authors, the 
Bible, works by ecclesiastics, theo-
logians, scholars, contemporary writ-
ers and even printed books. Subjects 
covered literature, history, philosophy, 
theology, rhetoric, military science, 
medicine, architecture and astronomy. 
King Matthias searched for curios 
and exchanged books with the great 
Lorenzo Medici and other collectors. 
He bought codices from Italian work-
shops before setting up his own in 
his capital, Buda. More than 30 arti-
sans illuminated and bound his manu-
scripts, known as Corvinas. Later, he 
opened his library to members of the 
nobility and church. He also patronized 
the first printing press in the Western 
world which produced the first book to 
be printed in Hungary in 1473. 
After his death and during the Turk-
ish occupation, the collection was 
dispersed. Today 216 Corvinas are 
known to exist. Only 53 volumes have 
remained in Hungary. Thirty nine are 
kept at the Austrian National Library 
and 49 in different Italian libraries. The 
others are spread out among French, 
German, English, Turkish and Ameri-
can collections. 
In 2001, the Hungarian National Szé-
chényi Library launched a joint program 
requesting libraries owning Corvinas to 
digitize them and send their scanned 
versions. So far, a few Corvinas 
have been published. More are to 
follow and reinstate Buda Castle. A 
valuable book based on the Széché-
nyi Library’s most beautiful gradual 
(a liturgical Codex Lat. 424 ) will be 
published in autumn 2007. 
This corpus recreates a unique rep-
resentation of the common cultural 
heritage of the European Renais-
sance. In 2005, it was inscribed on 
UNESCO’s Memory of the World 
Register. The inscription has given 
the program a new boost, and ac-
cording to Janos Kaldos of the Szé-
chényi Library, “is a great help for 
negotiations with partner libraries.” 
It also promotes the collection and 
makes it available to scholars and the 
public worldwide, upholding the link 
between past and future generations.

Hard to believe that fragile pieces of 
paper, which require the wearing of 
gloves for handling, can constitute 
a solid bridge linking past to present 
and European culture to indigenous 
culture of Mexico. The “Colleccion 
des Lenguas Indigenas” of the Jalisco 
Juan José Arreola public library in Mex-
ico comprises 166 books written for 
evangelical purposes during the colo-
nial era and the 19th century. This ex-
ceptional heritage contains precious 
information about four centuries of 
religious integration and about the lan-
guages of the first inhabitants of what 
would become the Mexican republic. 
“The collection contains a few of 
the first Mexican publications, some 
of them more astonishing than those 
published before the printing press 
(in 1500),” asserts Marina Mantilla 
Trolle, researcher at the University of 
Guadalajara. In a room as protected 
as a bank vault, where temperature 
and humidity are strictly regulated for 
optimal conservation of books, the his-
torian underlines the inestimable qual-
ity of the collection, representing 17 
languages belonging to nine different 
linguistic families, some of which have 
practically disappeared. For instance, 
the “Manual para administrar los san-
tos sacramentos” by Bartholomé Gar-
cía (1760) is the only register in exis-
tence written in coahuitleca. “There 
is a book in the opata language of 
which there are only four copies in 
the world. You even find works in 
Japanese. The missionaries used 
every book they found in the hope 
that some would help them com-
municate with the people living 
in the new countries where they 
landed.”
Among the rarest works is also the 
“Arte en lengua mixteca” by Fray An-
tonio de los Reyes (1593). Outside 
of Mexico, the only places the book 
can be found are in the Nettie Lee 
Benson Library at the University of 
Texas and in France’s National Li-
brary. 
To consult the whole collection, you 
have to go to Guadalajara. Otherwise 
you would need to visit more than ten 
libraries in Mexico, the United States, 
France and England.
Purgatory  
and butterfly 
Besides the fact that the books are 
rare, the value of the collection lies 
essentially in the information they 
provide. According to Marina Mantilla 
Trolle, this information is very useful 
to understand the development of in-
digenous languages and the process 
of integration in Mesoamerican com-
munities. Most of these books are bi-
lingual dictionaries, of Castilian trans-
lated into indigenous languages, and 
“artes” (grammatical descriptions) as 
well as catechisms, confession man-
uals and books of sermons. Some 
even contain very precise phonologi-
cal descriptions. 
One book, entitled “Vocabulario de 
Molina”, from 1571, is a very compre-
hensive dictionary which translates 
into “Mexican” words such as “pur-
gatory” (nechipauloyan neye otiloyan) 
or “butterfly cocoon” (tecilli). Another 
tome from 1578 sets out in its first 
pages the evangelical intention: “Es-
sential Christian doctrine in order that 
the ministers of these natives may 
teach them the principal mysteries of 
our holy Catholic faith and the natives 
understand.” 
In truth, the evangelical mission 
of the Spanish forced missionaries 
to learn the indigenous languages, 
which is why they were transcribed 
and studied in the books that are now 
             four centuries of colonization are recounted and illustrated in the “Colección de lenguas 
                indígenas” kept in guadalajara (Mexico). these 166 books, printed starting in 1539, 
                also preserve the memory of 17 indigenous languages, some of which have virtually disappeared
                         the collection was inscribed in UNeSCo’s Memory of the World register in 2007.

part of the collection. These tomes 
were in the monastery libraries, but in 
the 19th century a free market law ex-
propriated the church’s possessions, 
making them state property, which is 
how they all came to be together in 
one library. 
One special feature of these vol-
umes is the seal the missionaries 
placed on certain copies to estab-
lish ownership. In somewhat the 
same way we now brand cattle, they 
heated metal until it was red-hot and 
pressed it to the book’s edge, burn-
ing the pages to mark them with an 
indelible imprint.
“Each of these books constitutes 
a major source of knowledge. The 
collection is something we are only 
just beginning to explore,” explains 
Marina Mantilla. A team of specialists 
in history, ethno-history, linguistics 
and philology from the Universities in 
Guadelajara and the Colegio de Mi-
choacán has been formed to study 
these tomes. “But unfortunately suf-
ficient funding is lacking for research 
on this heritage the libraries contain, 
as well as for its conservation and 
restoration,” the historian adds. 
Living memory  
of vanished languages
Yet she is optimistic, because since 
digitization began on part of the col-
lection, the interest shown by sci-
entists from different regions of the 
world has grown significantly. “Ac-
cess to these works has been facili-
tated, because it’s in our interest to 
ensure the books are known to the 
general public and not just academ-
ics,” she concludes. 
a briDge between cultures
“Leafing through these books, 
some more than three hundred years 
old, is like travelling through the past. 
Many have handwritten annotations 
by monks. These texts testify to the 
evolution of culture and languages. 
They also offer a living memory of lost 
languages. That’s how they create a 
bridge between eras and cultures,” 
says Mantilla. 
“We would like to safeguard this 
treasure, study it and promote it, but 
it doesn’t belong to the University of 
Guadelajara, or to the state of Jalisco, 
nor to Mexico. It is part of the world’s 
heritage, says the researcher, as she 
closes, with almost maternal solici-
tude, “El camino al cielo en lengua 
Mexicana”, printed in 1611.

believe it or not,  
the first book to be printed with movable metal type face  
was printed in Korea, almost 80 years before gutenberg’s bible.
n July 1377, Priests Seokcan and Daldam used mov-
able metal type face to print the Jikji, the work of their 
teacher, the Korean monk Baegun Hwasang who 
in 1372 compiled a two-volume compendium of the 
essentials of “Seon.” This work - whose teachings 
later became known as Zen Buddhism in Japan - 
is the oldest surviving example of a book produced 
with moveable metal type face. It was inscribed on 
the Memory of the World Register in 2001 as the 
“Buljo jikji simche yojeol (vol. II).” 
The surviving volume, preserved in the National 
Library of France, contains only 38 sheets while a 
full version with all 307 chapters of the “Anthology 
of Great Buddhist Priests’ Zen Teachings” is pre-
served in a wooden type print in the National Library 
of Korea. 
Printed at the old Heungdeok-sa temple in Cheon-
gju city, with funds donated by the female priest 
Myodeok, this religious work is almost 80 years old-
er than Johannes Gutenberg’s Bible, the first book to 
be printed in Europe with the help of moveable metal 
type face technology, a technology that remained 
largely unchanged over the ensuing three and a half 
centuries. In Europe the belated discovery of this tech-
nology paved the way to massive cultural and social 
upheavals, including the Reformation. It may be worth 
noting that there is evidence that moveable metal type 
face was used by Korean printers even before 1377, 
although their work has been lost. 
The Jikji manuscript had been in the collection of 
Collin de Plancy, a chargé d’affaires with the French 
Embassy in Seoul in 1887. Sold at an auction in Par-
is in 1911, it was bought by Henri Vever, a collector 
of classics, and when he died in 1950, it was do-
nated to the Biliothèque nationale de France, where 
it has been ever since.

14The UNESCO Courier 2007 N°5
A domain reserved for historians 
since the end of the 19th century, 
the Atlantic slave trade archives 
have acquired a new legitimacy in 
the last few decades as the memo-
ry of the event, raised to the rank of 
cultural asset. 
The European countries that prac-
ticed the trade in African slaves be-
tween the 16th and 19th century 
for the profit of their overseas col-
onies are, a priori, those that hold 
the largest repositories. The official 
correspondence of local colonial 
authorities, for instance, is today 
kept in the Public Records Office 
in Kew, United Kingdom (Colonial 
Office), the Archives d’Outre-Mer 
françaises in Aix-en-Provence, 
France (“fonds des colonies”), the 
Archivo General de Las Indias in 
Seville, Spain (“Capitania general 
de Cuba”), the Rigsarkivet in Co-
penhagen, Denmark, and the Arqui-
vo Historico Ultramarino in Lisbon, 
Portugal. 
In Africa, the victim of the trade, 
archives remain in those countries 
where in the era of the fight against 
illegal trade, a central administra-
tion was established – this is the 
case in the first states founded by 
freed slaves, like Sierra Leone and 
Liberia, whose collections have suf-
fered from recent civil wars. In Por-
tuguese-speaking countries (Cap 
Verde, Sao Tome e Principe and 
Angola), certain records of the for-
mer colonial government go back 
as far as the 17th century (Arquivo 
dal Camara municipal de Principe, 
since 1665). 
In America, national archives pre-
serve collections that are often in-
tact : in Argentina (the « Division 
Colonial-seccion Gobierno » start-
ing in the late 16th century), in Co-
lombia (The collection « Negros 
y Esclavos » from 1553), in Brazil 
(Fundo Marinha-Secretaria de Es-
tado, 1786-1895), and in Cuba 
(the private Valle-Iznaga archive go-
ing back to 1606).
Companies, ports  
and private collections
In addition, emblematic collections 
are to be found in the possession 
of the important companies grant-
ed the monopoly of the slave trade: 
the Dutch West-Indische Compag-
nie in The Hague (1675-1791), 
the British Royal African Company 
(1672-1731) in the Public Records 
Office in Kew, the West Indies and 
Guinea Company (1671-1754) in 
Copenhagen, and the Compagnie 
des Indes françaises in Lorient. 
Similarly, archives remain in the 
great European slave-trading ports 
(Liverpool, Bristol, London, La Ro-
chelle, Bordeaux, Nantes, Le Havre, 
Middelburg, Amsterdam). Cham-
bers of commerce, port authorities, 
former maritime courts (admiralties) 
have left extensive records of the 
seafaring slave trade throughout 
the 18th century, notably the ar-
chives on traders’ bankruptcies in 
Antwerp and Bordeaux. 
Finally, there are private collec-
tions like those of the Belgian 
slave-trading captain Van Alstein in 
Gent, or the slave trader Humphrey 
Morice, director of the Bank of Eng-
land from 1721 to 1736, in London. 
The abolition of the slave trade in-
spired important research on slav-
ery at the beginning of the 19th 
century in England, in the context of 
a parliamentary debate before the 
law was voted in 1807 (Parliamen-
tary Papers). The same occurred in 
France during the period of the July 
Monarchy until the 1848 abolition.
What do these archives 
contain?
The documents preserved in these 
collections perpetuate the memory 
of the slave trade and slavery. We 
discover notably the extensive se-
ries of registers concerning ship-
ping that can be used to produce 
quantitative data on slave trading 
and sometimes specific details on 
particular voyages. 
The ships’ seafaring documents 
also yield valuable information: 
regulations and shipping contracts 
that talk about discipline on board, 
captains’ reports that often give de-
scriptions of the places where trad-
                             registers and log books, memoirs and travel stories, slave census reports
             – the archives of the Atlantic slave trade provide signposts to the itineraries taken 
                by the old slave ships between europe, the Americas and Africa. 
                         Where are those precious documents now?

ing was conducted, and log-book 
accounts of uprisings that broke 
out at sea. 
Memoirs and travel stories recount 
the history of slavery from another 
angle. Numerous in the 18th cen-
tury, they depict the different slave 
routes, sometimes including draw-
ings mapping the African coast 
and often relate the customs of the 
people who were the slave-traders’ 
prey. 
Other private collections come 
from agricultural properties in 
America, containing bills of sale 
for slaves, promissory notes or ac-
counting ledgers, all of them sourc-
es that make it possible to piece to-
gether the daily lives of slaves who 
worked on the plantations. 
Regarding census reports of 
slaves before and after abolition, 
we find in the Latin American colo-
nies, for instance, records of sales 
and mortgages of slaves in Brazil, 
and applications for emancipation 
in Argentina. In Africa too, there are 
lists of the names of slaves freed by 
the British navy, beginning in 1815, 
who were resettled in Sierra Leone 
(“Liberated African Registers”). 
Some archives recently brought 
to light, such as the Chinguetti 
Arabic manuscripts about Africa in 
Timbuktu (insert link to article) and 
those of the “zaouias”, religious or-
ders of the Algerian and Moroccan 
Sahara, may reveal new aspects of 
African slavery. 
These repositories are scattered 
all over the world, an indication of 
the magnitude of the task to be ac-
complished in taking inventory of 
and preserving the archives of the

by the Archives de France of a gen-
eral guide to the sources on the 
slave trade and slavery can set an 
example for Europe. In West Africa 
where some countries are emerg-
ing from civil war, safeguarding ma-

taken on by the international com-
munity.

eleven countries with histories shaped by the international slave trade 
are exploring, preserving and sharing their archives, a project sup-
ported by UNeSCo
Between March 1806 and February 
1807, more than 30 ships with United 
States flags and crews entered Havana 
Bay, freighted by local traders, trans-
porting over 5,000 captive Africans in 
their holds to be sold as slaves. These 
stark statistics are part of a rich trove 
of primary source information vividly de-
picting Cuba’s role in the international 
slave trade, recently uncovered by local 
archivists. They combed through 27 lin-
ear kilometres of documents kept in na-
tional archives, locating 38 particularly 
relevant collections from the colonial 
period. 
Highlights from 11 of these collec-
tions are now available on a CD-Rom, 
containing 500 documents, produced 
by the Slave Trade Archives Project, 
funded by NORAD and launched by 
UNESCO in 1999. Gambia, mean-
while, has developed a historical text 
based on its national records, and Sen-
egal a virtual guided tour of Gorée Is-
land, key slave trading post with its infa-
mous House of Slaves. The project was 
designed to safeguard and improve ac-
cess to original documentary sources 
on the transatlantic slave trade, notably 
through digitization. 
As the project unfolded, national ar-
chives in participating African, Latin 
American and Caribbean countries 
worked on upgrading their facilities, 
obtaining copies of records held else-
where and training staff. An array of 
historical papers – from official cor-
respondence and shipping records to 
slaves’ bills of sale and personal mem-
oirs - were scanned and selected. 
Eleven countries took part - Benin, 
Cape Verde, Gambia, Ghana and Sen-
egal in Africa, plus Argentina, Brazil, 
Barbados, Colombia, Cuba and Haiti 
- from 2000 to 2004. Among the proj-
ect’s tangible results, seminars were 
held, websites created, a dozen data-
bases loaded with over 10,000 docu-
ments, some 200,000 items, images 
and documents, digitized and 14 insti-
tutions acquired computer equipment. 
Future plans will incorporate more 
countries in this ongoing effort to resur-
rect a neglected facet of our collective 
memory...

cember 1911, a daring feat which 
successfully ended thanks to excep-
tionally good logistic planning and 
execution. The preparations for this 
expedition, the dog-sled journey and 
their return are documented in film 
footage from 1910 to 1912. 
Though the material is incomplete, 
it is made up of original sequences, 
consisting of negative film and first 
and second-generation print mate-
rial, kept by the Norwegian Film Insti-
tute and the National Library.  
the battle of the Somme  
(United Kingdom) 
This 1916 film on one of the ma-
jor battles of the First World War 
is the first feature-length documen-
tary ever to record war in action. It 
marked the development of docu-
mentary and propaganda war films 
and brought about debate on issues 
concerning the ethical treatment of 
“factual” film which continue to be 
relevant today. The film’s oldest 
existing copy is a cornerstone of the 
cinematic collection of the British 
Imperial War Museum. 
lumière films (france) 
The word “cinema” originated from 
“cinématographe”, a device invented in 
1895 by the Lumière brothers, Auguste 
and Louis. They gave the world its first 
ever motion picture, with the projec-
tion of “La Sortie des usines Lumière” 
(“Leaving the Lumière Factory”). 
Their archive of 1,405 titles, pro-
duced by cinema pioneers between 
1896 and 1900, contains a wealth 
of documentary material - scenes 
of daily life, historical events, drama 
and comedy. The collection is kept 
by the French Film Archives. 
Metropolis (germany) 
Director Fritz Lang’s silent futuris-
tic film is today considered a mas-
terpiece of German expressionism. 
Long before the term “super-produc-
tion” was associated with cinema, 
this film employed 35,000 extras, 
used up 620,000 metres of film and 
took close to a year to shoot. Be-
cause it was a commercial failure 
when first shown in 1927, it had to 
be heavily cut. It has since been re-
stored to a version close to the origi-
nal, with the soundtrack recorded 
at that time by the Saarbrücken Sym-
phony Orchestra. 
los olvidados (Mexico) 
Lost for 20 years, the original 
negative of this 1950 film is now 
preserved in the film archives of 
the National Autonomous Univer-
sity in Mexico City. Because it por-
trayed children in an urban slum, 
it was highly controversial during 
filming and even after its release, 
better known in English as “The 
Young and The Damned”. The fol-
lowing year, it caused a sensation 
at the Cannes Film Festival, win-
ning an award for Spanish-Mexi-
can director Luis Buñuel. Until he 
died in 1983, Buñuel went on to 
make many more films in Mexico 
and Europe and is today one of 
world’s major film directors. 
roald Amundsen’s South Pole 
expedition (Norway) 
The explorer Amundsen and his 
four-man team were the first people 
to reach the South Pole on 14 De-
Cinema
Some famous classics of world cinema 
are among those inscribed in the Memory of the World register. 
others, although lesser-known, deserve their place in the register, 
witnesses to exceptional human achievements..

inscription ever found. It is located 
on the ancient trade and pilgrimage 
route connecting the early Islamic 
city of al-Mabiyat with Madain Saleh. 
The inscription mentions the date of 
the death of the second Caliph of Is-
lam, Omar bin al-Khattab, which oc-
curred on the last night of the month 
of Dul-Hajj in the year 23 Hegrah 
(corresponding to 644 AD).  
the bleek Collection  
(South Africa) 
In the 19th century, W.H.I. Bleek 
and two family members developed 
a phonetic script for transcribing the 
characteristic clicks and sounds of 
the language of the |Xam, a now-
extinct hunter-gatherer society of the 
San Bushmen. Today, their photo-
graphs and notebooks comprising 
12,000 pages provide the only exist-
ing glimpse into the life and culture 
of this late Stone Age people.
human rights Archive  
(Chile) 
Chile’s military dictatorship, which 
lasted from 1973 to 1989, is docu-
mented in various archives of na-
tional institutions and human rights 
organizations. These include a photo 
register of some 1,000 people who 
disappeared, cassettes and videos 
of their stories, digitalized docu-
ments of the 3,877 human rights 
abuses investigated by the Truth and 
Reconciliation Commission, press 
clippings and many more. Confront-
ing the painful memories of this tur-
bulent past has been important in 
the country’s healing process. More. 
golden lists of the  
Qing dynasty imperial  
examination (China) 
These sheets of yellow paper, writ-
ten in Chinese and Manchu, are lists 
of candidates who passed the pal-
ace civil service examination, pre-
pared for the Emperor who himself 
supervised the final selection stage. 
Such documents from the Qing Dy-
nasty (1644-1911) are prized for 
their artistic calligraphy. This recruit-
ment system influenced those in Ja-
pan, Korea and Vietnam, and even 
those in some European countries. 
the leprosy Archives of bergen 
(Norway) 
It may come as a surprise that 19th 
century Bergen was a scientific cen-
tre in the fight against leprosy, a dis-
ease that has almost been wiped out 
in Europe today. Also known as Han-
sen’s disease, after the Norwegian 
doctor who discovered the leprosy 
bacillus, it was not such an unusual 
ailment in Europe for many centuries, 
especially in coastal regions. The 
Leprosy Archives document the sci-
entific breakthrough against the dis-
ease that today still affects 220,000 
people the world over.
