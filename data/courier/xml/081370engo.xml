ALL WAYS ARE FOUGHT AGAINST CHILDREN
IT is in the atr : of things that chidren can never win awar-and It IS In the nature of things that all wars are
waged against children. Some weapons are aimed at them
directly-and children lose their lives, their eyesight. their
arms and legs and mental faculties, just as if they, were
soldiers. These are only some of the victims, for, finally, every
weapon has the same target. The mere existence of a tank or
a gun means there are fewer hoes and scythes and tractors-
less food for the children. Even before the guns start firing,
the arithmetic of war deprives the children of their natural
providers, the fathers who till the fields, build the homes and
get the fuel to keep them warm. When the shooting is over,
it is not the dead who count their dead, for it is the children
who reckon their losses, and finally pay the tragic reckoning
for all the wars.
While all of decent mankind is revolted by war, the
road to peace is not yet clearly marked. For stories of some
of the means whereby men and women of good will are
seeking to chart that road, and a description of some of
the obstacles they must overcome, see Pages 5, 6 and 7.

UNESCO COURIER-Page 2
One of the non-governmental organizations helping to give form to Unesco's objectives is
the International Theatre Institute (IT !) which works to encourage the setting up of National
Theatre Centres in Unesco's Member States. Next month the ITI is holding its Third Annual
Congress in Paris in conjunction with a conference and exhibition on theatre architecture in
different countries. This photo shows M. René Thomas, secretary of the exhibition (left) and
M. Pierre Soarel. a Paris architect, inspecting theatre plans and models for this exhibition.
WITHIN the last century common
interests of humanity have led
v V to the formation of more tña
1000 international organiz-
ations all over the world. Of these over
900 are non-governmental. They in-
clude church and professional groups,
philosophers and educators, scholars,
lawyers, youth and women's organiz-
ations.
The United Nations is now working
closely with many of these indepen-
dent groups through its specialized
agencies, WHO, FAO and UNESCO.
At present 100 independent non-
governmental organizations are work-
ing under consultative arrangements
with Unesco, bringing their specialized
work and knowledge to help in the
accomplishment of Unesco'a pro-
gramme.
Architecture, women's rights, folk
music and philosophy, African affairs
and applied psychology-what com-
mon ground could there be for such
diverse interests as these ? The answer
is Unesco's objectives :
For instance, Unesco sets out to
protect the rights of the author, and
at the same time to promote the free
circulation of ideas. No author
wishes to let his work appear, un-
protected, where it may be pirated, re-
written or translated so badly that it
no longer bears much resemblance to
what he created, and fails to bring him
the rewards he deserves.
Maze of World Copyright
EXPERT advice on world copyrightproblem"was necessary for
Unesco to turn its resolution into
actuality. The International Literary
and Artistic Association was founded
in France in 1878 under the honorary
presidency of a great author. Victor
Hugo. This group, with members in
Belgium, Denmark, Egypt, France and
more than a dozen other countries,
working with Unesco, held meetings
of its national committees and prepar-
ed a report on the extension of world
copyright protection for the inform-
ation of Unesco's member states.
Expert opinion and professional ad-
vice were given by the International
Confederation of Societies of Authors.
and, in the interests of composers of
music, by the International Feder-
ation of the Phonographic Industry.
With this information at its disposal,
Unesco is now prepared to hold a
world conference on copyright law, to
straighten out the maze of internation-
al legal difficulties which expose
authors to unfair treatment and hinder
the free exchange of their work.
Consultative arrangements enablp
independent organizations to send ob-
servers to Unesco General Conferences,
to participate in meetings and technic-
al conferences held by Unesco on
subjects which interest them. But the
most important part of all the work
accomplished between Unesco and
these non-governmental groups is the
attainment of common objectives
Women's Access
To Education
FOR instance, a number of interna-tional women's organizations sub-
mitted special reports to a Unesco
conference studying problems of equal
educational opportunities for women.
Some of these groups provided resolu-
tions, such. as that made by the Inter-
national Alliance of Women, the In-
ternational Federation of University
Women, and the Open Door Inter-
national, that Unesco encourage go-
vernments to promote the organization
of educational and professional guid-
once for all, without prejudice to wo-
men.
Resolutions like these have given the
world such advances as woman surf-
frage. The work of these organiz-
ations, done now with Unesco sponsor-
ship, will be extended to countries
through their government, where the
fight'might have been long and bitter
for a non-governmehta ! organization
working alone.
One of the first requirements or
organizations working on a basis of
consultative arrangements with Unes-
co grants to. help them continue their
work Or carry through specific parts of
Unesco's special projects, is that they

be truly international in their scope,
and that their objectives conform with
the general principles in Unesco's
Constitution. Thus one of the Com-
mi5sions of the Inter-Parliamentary
Union is working with Unesco on the
analysis and improvement of text-
books, which too often in the put have
set mistaken grounds for national pre-
judices.
In some cases, Unesco has promoted
the creation of over-all federative
bodies, which directly relate the work
of independent groups to Unesco's pro-
gramme. One of these, the Interna-
tional Council of Philosophy and
Humanistic Studies was founded in
1949. Some of its member organiz-
ations are made up of smaller groups
which represent special fields of cul-
tural studies. One of the most repre-
sentative is the International Acade-
mic Union, founded in 1919, with a
membership now of 22 countries.
Of what interest is a Dictionary of
Terminology of International Law ? If
we give this a moment's attention-
Unesco has given it the encouragement
of a grant-its importance becomes
apparent. No legal agreement can be
reached when jurists of different
nations attach different meanings to
the same word in translation. This
happened when an important inter-
governmental agreement on admi-
nistration was being grawn up, when
the French word mandat, meaning a
legal contract in which one party is
subordinated to the other, was used for
the English word trusteeship.

interest calls for international co-

TRIBUTES TO TWO GREAT
INTERNATIONAlISTS
LÉON BLUM HAROLD LASKI
IN remembering Léon Blum there isa temptation to accept the sur-
face picture of a politician pre-
sented by his thirty years of publlc
life. To do so would be to forget the
long years of preparation which pre-
ceded it, for Blum was already 47
when first elected to the Chamber of
Deputies in 1919.
A brilliant critic and poet, his lite-
rary work first brought him notice,
and his name, With those of Marcel
Proust and André Gide, appeared
among the contributors to"Banquet"
and"Revue Blanche", two public-
ations in which young men, later to
win important places in French lite-
rature, first"tried their strength".
After entering the ConseiId'Etat in
1905, Blum pursued a twofold occup-
ation of magistrate and man of let-
ters. At this time a long process of
thought and reasoning was leading
him to the ideas for which he was to
fight hard during the rest of his life.
It was the assassination of Jaures on
August 1, 1914 that robbed the French
Socialist party of its leader and led
Léon Blum to devote himself to carry-
ing on the work of his friend and
teacher. From 1919 to 1940, Léon Blum
was. both In the French parliament
and in the world, an outstanding
representative of Socialist thought and
one of the most single-hearted cham-
pions of a more Just and peaceful
society.
Accusers Became Accused
WHEN the Vichy Governmentbrought him to trial on a
charge of responsibility for the
French reverses, he sought to defend
less himself than liberty and demo-
cracy. He argued with such force and
conviction that his trial became the
trial of his accusers and they hastened
to suspend it.
Liberated from internment in Ger-
many In 1945 he returned to France
and in 1946 he served as President of
the First General Conference of
Unesco, thus again associating himself
with work for peace and co-operation
to which his life had been dedicated.
Blum's life was to close with a signi-
ficant act. Just before he died he set
his signature to a telegram appealing
for the liberation of a'group of poli-
tical refugees. Thus the end of his
ownlifefellintolinewiththeconclu-
sion of his last book :"When man
feels troubled and discouraged, he has
only to turn his thoughts to mankind."
FOR most people Harold Laski willbe best remembered for his work
as a Professor of Political Science
at the University of London, a member
of the Labour Party Executive, and
the author of brilliant books on demo-
cracy and socialism. But by Unesco
he will also be remembered as one of
the most ardent and valued collabora-
tors In several of its early projects.
In 1947 he was consulted, with other
philosophers and sociologists, on the
philosophic bases of a Universal De-
claration of Human Rights, and his
contribution was a brilliant and cou-
rageous essay. In It he summed up
his view on the world of the future
by saying that the Declaration"woUld
have to take account rather of the
possibilities struggling to be born than
of the traditions dying before our
eyes".
Like others he had been struck by
the sceptical Indifference bred In
peoples by a surfeit of hollow formulae
and principles betrayed, and so he
called for a declaration which would
be both bold In its general character
and concrete In Its detailed conduct.
Declaration Must Unify
OF the division of the moderntut rld he wrote :"Under cir-
cumstances such as these, the
issue of a Declaration of Rights would
be a grave error of judgment unless it
set out deliberately to unify, and not
to separate men in their different
political societies. It must, therefore,
emphasize the identities, and not the
differences, in the competing. social
philosophies which now arouse such
passionate discussion."
Later he joined the Committees of
Experts convened by Unesco to study
the question of Human Rights, and he
entered into their deliberations with
the enthusiasm he brought to every-
thing.
Militant, tenacious and combative he
was at all times, but with repeated
flashes of transforming humour, and
the felicity of expression that was one
of his gifts was also a part of his
own vivacity. His learning was prodi-
gious and ready to hand, with history
particularly the history of thought, at
his fingertips to support his views.
To it he joined a mercilessly critical
spirit ; there can rarely have been a
man more concerned with the clear
definition, of terms and their proper
use. In a word, he had exactly the
qualities needed in a good committee
man, and especially the gift of stimul-
ating debate and clarifying the issues

"CAN THE BLIND LEAD THE BLIND ? SHALL THEY NOT BOTH FALL INTO THE DITCH ?" (Luke, vi. 39) This was already an old question
in the time of Christ. The answer was obvious. In the time of Breughel, 1500 years later, the question was still rhetorical, and the
answer was the same-unremitting misery, fear and solitude, well illustrated by Breughel's painting (above)"The Parable of the Blind".
WORLD BRAILLE-AN ADVANCE
TOWARDS ONE WORLD
... An answer !
BLIND men and women who
read with their fingertips
scores of different languages
in all parts of the earth are closer
than seeing readers to a goal of
extraordinary value for internatio-
nal understanding-a single
script for the whole world. This is
the result of agreements reached at
a ten-day meeting in Unesco House,
Paris, of the International Braille
Conference attended by delegates
representing most of the world's
principal language areas.
More than half of the partici-
pants in the proceedings were blind
themselves. They came from
countries as far apart as Brazil and
India, from Pakistan, China, Egypt,
Ceylon, England, Greece, the United
States. For the first time in
Unesco's history, a Japanese took
part in the gathering as an official
member of an agency working
under the auspices of the organi-
zation, and also for the first time
representatives of Hashemite Jor-
dan and the Federation of Malaya
were present in official capacities.
The delegates decided that it was
not only feasible but both desirable
and practicable to create a broadly
uniform Braille system for all lan-
guages and scripts. This is to be
called World Braille and will be
based upon the original system of
raised-character writing for the
blind developed by the Frenchman
Louis Braille, himself blind, more
than a century ago. The esta-
blishment of a World Braille
Council to maintain uniformity in
the future and to work out techni-
cal details in specialized fields of
Braille was strongly recommended..
A NEW ERA FOR THE BLIND
THE achievements of the meetingconstituted an important mile-stone in the history of Braill  be-
cause they permit further practical
and concrete measures to establish the
greatest degree of uniformity in a
single system of writing for the blind.
The delegates, who included Braillists,
linguists, phoneticians, blind educatio-
ists, and representatives of Braille
printing houses, agreed that the re-
sults of their talks were not only
extraordinarily satisfactory but better
than the most glowing optimist could
have expected.
Dr. Helen Keller, world-famous Ame-
rican blind deaf-mute, in whose ho-
nour a special session of the Confer-
ence was held, told the delegates that
through their work a new era for the
blind was beginning, for, she said, they
were"lifting the blind throughout the
world from age-long darkness into the
light of culture and knowledge".
Through them and through Unesco's
activities on behalf of the blind, she
added."the voice of the blind is being
heard in words that are to be put into
concrete assistance throughout'iI. world
of good will".
To reach agreement, the delegates
had to obtain the co-operation of
spokesmen for various groups of
Braille readers who, because of con-
flicting methods in adapting Braille in
the past, would now have to sacrifice
what they had learned-over periods
of many years-and begin all over
again. One example was S. T. Dajani,
principal of the Alaiya School for the
Blind, Ramallah, Hashemite Jordan,
who volunteered to scrap twelve years
of hard work in order to help world
unity. Another example was C. K.
Helen Kelier, the American b) ind deai-mute,

who made a similar offer.
TRADITIONS TAKE
SECOND PLACE
ONE of the achievements of the con-ference was an agreement by re-
presentatives of the various forms
of the Perso-Arabic languages spoken
in Hashemite Jordan. Egypt, Iraq,
Persia, Pakistan and MalaYa to recom-
mend to all countries in their lin-
guistic group that Braille writing in
the future be read from left to right,
instead of from right to left as in the
usual visual script for many centuries.
A spokesman for modern Hebrew, Dr.
Michael GeSner, of the Jewish Braille
Institute of America, concurred in the
change. Other formidable obstacles
arising from Braille codes built of
traditional practices in visual scripts
tied to historical religious and senti-
mental backgrounds also were over-
come.
Another achievement was an agree-
ment to begin the formulation of a
uniform Chinese Braille based on
Mandarin, but retaining a considerable
degree of sound relationship with tra-
ditional Braille. There are four main
spoken forms of Chinese, of which the
Pekin Braille code has 408 characters ;
while Union Mandarin has only 54
characters.
In addition, it was agreed to recom-
mend that mathematical and chemical
symbols should be represented with
greater uniformity throughout the
world ; that the degree of uniformity
already existing in musical notation
should be extended ; and that efforts
should be made to restore and main-
AN INTERNATIONAL TRIBUTE TO LOUIS BRAILLE
At the close of the International Braille Conference in Paris, on March 29th, delegates visited
the little town of Coupvray. where Louis Braille was born and where he is buried. Standing
at his graveside, these men and women, many of them blind, paid tribute to the man who
evolved the method of raised character writing that bears his name. Representing the
world's principal language areas, the delegates expressed by their gesture, the debt owed
to Louis Braille and those who adap1ed his system to the world's languages by countless
sightless persons who as a result have been able to live fuller and more useful lives.
LOUIS BRAILLE
There was still no basic change in the lot 01
the blind, when the great blind Milten wrote
angrily."0 dark, dark. dark. amid the blaze
of noon, Irrecoverably dark, total eclipse,
Without all hope 01 Day !" (Samson Ago-
nistes.) It remained for Louis Braille, in the
19th Century, to offer the blind something
better than the old question, and the old
and ugly answer. He gave them the script
which bears his name, and opened to them
a whole new world 01 hope and happiness.
tain world uniformity in punctuation
signs.
In the World Braille whose creation
was recommended, each sign will
as far as possible be used for the
same or nearly the same sound as in
. the original Braille, will represent thesame letter or will fulfil the same or
a similar function. Except where the
complexities of ideographic scripts
make it impossible, a Braille symbol
will be provided for each visual letter,
with the understanding that the
sound value of the symbol be identical
with that of the visual letter of the
a. lphabet of the particular language.
The effort will be made to make World
Braille a complete tactile repres-
entation of visual scripts, and to bring
about the maximum degree of con-
sistency among the Braille systems of
the various language groups.
The delegates decided that a truly
phonetic World Braille was not prac-
ticable for general purposes, but re-
commended that a panel of experts
be set up to make suggestions on the
possibility of improving the Braille
form of the International Phonetic
Alphabet. Another panel was recom-
mended to work out an international
classification of sounds of letters and
toue marks.
ANNUAL TRIBUTE ;,-
TO LOUIS BRAILLE
DESPITE the recommendation toform a World Braille Council, the
Conference voted that"it is still
of paramount importance that Unesco
should continue to play a vital role
in the Braille problem in view of
its educational and cultural commit-
ments"and that"a liaison should be
maintained permanently with Unesco.
In expressing its deep appreciation to
Unesco, the Conference asked that the
General Conference of Unesco to be
held in Florence in May should make
provision during the remainder of
1950 and in 1951 for the technical com-
pletion of the task it has so effective-
ly undertaken. These plans include
the holding of regional conferences
for areas using the Arabic script, for
Spanish and Portuguese speaking
areas, and for the languages of eastern
Asia.
In tribute to Louis Braille, the Con-
ference recommended that workers for
the blind in all parts of the world
observe his birthday as an annual ho-
liday, and that a world commemor-
ation be arranged for the centenary of
Braille's death, in 1952.

UNESCO COURIER-PAGE 4
Opening a closed book of highly original-
art, a Paris exhibition presents... 
ART TREASURES OF
MEDIAEVAL YUGOSLAVIA
WOMAN WITH THE AMPHORA (Church of the Holy Apostles. Petch
monastery).-1 A Serbian artist of the early l3th Century painted this
fresco. He attempted to solve a 3 dimensional geometrical problem
in terms of 2 dimensional art. Contemporary cubists set the same
problem and solved it in a manner which is strangely similar to the
technique of the 13th Century artist.
IT is 80 years since Japanese paintings were first exhib-
t ited in European museums and art galleries and
some 30 years since the Negro art of Africa first
became widely known in Europe through the same means.
Probably as important in its own way as these two
earlier events was the exhibition of Yugoslav Mediaeval
Art held at the Palais de Chaillot in Paris last month.
realistic drawing of the
features, sometimes carried to
caricature, the almost impress-
ionistic touches, with the flat
and heavy painting of the
hair and deliberate distortion
of the limbs.
It is easy to see why differ-
ent schools of archaeology
have often advanced conflict-
ing theories to explain the
originality of this painting.
The same applies, however, to
Yugoslav architecture and
sculpture, represented in the
Paris exhibition by some very
beautiful casts.
It is understandable too
that at one time at least, this
sculpture and architecture
were regarded simply as off-
shoots of the basilicas of Lom-
bardy.
But architecture and sculp-
ture do not develop for
eight centuries without being
decisively influenced by men-
in this case by the Slav
carvers and masons.
Although not likely to bring
about a revolution in art
these treasures of mediaeval
Yugoslavia lifted the curtain
hiding a fascinating civiliz-
ation, which since the eleventh
century has produced a great
number of masterpieces hith-
erto. insufficiently appreciated.
Most critics and archaeo-
logists, loath to leave the well-
trodden highways of art
history, have neglected these
works of art, and they have
thus remained practically
unknown to the general public
who, for the last twenty years
have learned to familiarize
themselves more with primitive
cave paintings than with
mediaeval frescos.
In Yugoslavia, however, such
frescos now receive their full
share of appreciation, and the
reproductions brought to Paris
through the"Association
Française d'Action Artistique"
and a Yugoslav organizing
committee explain why.
These striking reproductions
demonstrate the vitality of
Yugoslav art, which, influenced
by two often very different
worlds, has evolved original
and individual forms.
What is the reason for the
In this are the decorative
themes in particular seem
to be entirely original, as
if the southern Slavs had
found their most individual
form of expression in the
carving of doorways and
capitals and in the famous
"trellis-work"of friezes and
tympana.
When they adopted Christ-
ianity, they kept their own
language, songs and customs,
and they also preserved their
forms of ornamentation ; the
designs with which the stones
of their buildings are so pro-
fusely carved-transposed
perhaps from more primitive
work in wood-are closely
akin to those still found in
Serbian lace-work, pottery and
textiles.
One of the strangest, even
disturbing things revealed by
the Paris exhibition is Bogo-
mile sculpture.
More than thirty thousand
examples of this sculpture-
striking originality of these
paintings ? Even allowing for
the influence, both technical
and intellectual, of Byzantium
and Ravenna and, perhaps, of
Hellenic survivals, one has
only to look at the Descent
from the Cross in the Mo-
nastery of Milicheva and
especially the extraordinary
Sopotchani Dormition, to rea-
lize that those infiuences
alone cannot explain the
essence of this art.
THE"SCHISM IN ART"
THE fact is that the samecircumstances which fro
the twelfth to the four-
teenth century made it pos-
sible for the southern Slavs
to retain their ecclesiastical
and political independence ;
also account for the free
flowering of their art. This
sudden upsurge of a form
of painting, which included
psychological portraiture and
showed the utmost daring in
the use of colour, has been
called the"schism in art".
There is in fact a great
difference between the art of
Rome or Byzantium and this

carved monoliths, pillars, stelae

the mountain burial places of
BOSilia and Herzegovina. In
the thirteenth and fourteenth
centuries-until the Turkish
occupation-a persecuted
people raied these monuments
of their faith. Their part of

with an admixture of Christ-
ianity, were combined with
the older tribal myths of the
converts. 
MYSTERIOUS SYMBOLS
CUToff in their naturalstronghold, the Bogo-
miles and Patarini es-
caped the bloodbath in which
their kinsfolk, the Cathari of
Languedoc, perished. These
bas-reliefs, in which"old Slav"
themes are associated with
mysterious symbols, are all
that remain of their civiliz-
ation and tenets.
In one instance, a knight is
shown stretched bareheaded
on the Cross. More often,
clad in armour, the dead man
is depicted with his right hand
raised, disproportionate in size
and surmounted by a sun and
with a bow and arrow carved
at his left.
Tournaments ajid battles,
hunting scene, stylized pic-
tures of the Kolo, national
dance of Yugoslavia, horses
and stages reminiscent of the
primitive magical cave paint-
ings, all bear witness to the
fertile tenacity of a people
who loved and clung to their
past. their native soil and
their church.
To appreciate the signific-
ance of the exhibition one has
only to remember that Europe
has had to wait five hundred
years before discovering this
highly original art ; that it
became familiar with the
sculpture of Easter Island
before it first saw that of
Bosnia, and that about 1900,
critics used to treat the Yugo-
slav frescos as clumsy imit-
ations of Italian painting and
spoke of the BOgIJmile monu-
ments as the crude products of
a barbarian imagination.
While the authors of the
Exhibition catalogue write that
their national art is"becoming
a cultural legacy enjoyed by
all Yugoslavs", their work
itself proves that this newly
revealed art is also destined
to enrich and inspire many
other countries.
THE RtCHT TO WRITE
AND THE RICHT TO READ
of Unesco's Member States,
newly independent. Like many
under-developed countries, this
young nation suffers from a
scarcity of national literature.
Unlike the peoples of Europe,
whose national cultures have
been inspired and enriched
by centuries of each other's
work, its people have seen few
translations from other lan-
guages. To-day, badly in need
of the creative work of other
nations, they are being han-
dicapped through the com-
plications of international
copyright law.
Rights of Three Groups
SIMPLE to state, the problemis difficult to resolve.
The rights of three groups
must be balanced. The author
must be protected, the publish-
er who produces and dis-
tributes his work, and the
public. The public deserves
the unimpeded circulation of
by William Gaddis
original work. The publisher
must be paid for his work in
bringing it to the public.. And
the author, besides being paid
for his work, must have the
right to approve its distribution
in the form in which his
creative genius led him to
make it. When the French
Copyright Law of 1793 was
passed, the author's right was
called"the most sacred, the
most unassailable, and the
most personal of all forms of
property.
In Europe the right of the
author has always been regard-
ed as a natural right, while in
America it is acquired some-
what like a patent on an
invention. A book in France
is automatically copyrighted
when it is published, but in
the United States for instance
the author must go through
legal formalities, or lose his
copyright. In many counfries
motion pictures, radio and
television programmes which
publicize. original work are not
yet subject to copyright law.
Some countries, where the
benefits of science and culture
are most needed, have no
pecial copyright laws at all.
Equal Protection For All
EFFORTS have been madeat internatíonal co-oper-
ation in this maze of legal
differences. The Berne Con-
vention of 1886 is an active
agency in promoting copyright
agreements among most Eur-
cpean countries, members of
the British Commonwealth
and Brazil. Seven inter-Amer-
ican conferences have been
held, but the conventions that
came out of them have not
been far-reaching. Most of
Africa is outside international
agreements.
Experts, called together by
Unesco from all parts of the
world, have recommended
drafting a new convention
which as many nations as
po ; siMe wiU be able to ratify
without infringement upon
their own laws. The main
point would be that each
nation agree to give to any
author, regardless of his
nationality, the same protec-
tion that they give their own
authors.
The Copyright Division of
Unesco's Department of Cul-
tural Activities has analyzed
the copyright laws of more
than sixty countries, and
classified them according to
countries, subjects and dates.
The subjects have been cata-
logued and exhaustive reports
have been prepared, to give
legal experts a world copyright
picture easily and quickly. In
October, Unesco hopes to
convene a new Committee of
Experts in Washington to
recommend further action on
international copyright law. It
will be an important part in
Unesco's over-all effort to
break down more of the
barriers in men's minds which
make impossible the under-
standing necessary for peace
"BOOKS", wrote HenryDavid Thoreau,"are
the treasured wealth
of the world, the fit inheri-
tance of generations and na-
tions". To-day almost a cen-
turn after Thoreau wrote these
words, most members of the
world's family of nations have
still been unable to claim their
rightful share of this inter-
national heritage. Many
countries, old in civilization
but young in independence,
are cut off from the books
which are as vital to their
social and economic develop-
ment as technological advice
and equipment.
What stands between these
people and the books which
will help them catch up with
the scientific, social and cul-
tural progress of other coun-
tries ? Apart from the barrier
of different languages, most
of the reasons stem from
economic causes. Among these
are copyright laws.
Just how copyright laws can
create barriers between people
and knowledge was shown

Major Discussion Proposed
for Florence Conference
UNESCO'S CONTRIBUTION
UNITED NATIONS
PEACE MISSION
A general view of Florence, where the Fifth Session of Unesco's General Conierende wiU open on May 22nd.
In the background (centre) is the Pallazo Vecchio. where plenary sessions of the Conference will be held.
IN three weeks time over 1000 men
and women-delegates, official
observers, members of Unesco's
Secretariat and journalists-will be
gathered in Florence, Italy, for the
opening of the Fifth Session of
Unesco's General Conference.
Meeting from May 22 to June 17 at
plenary sessions in the renaissance
setting of the Palazzo Vecchio and at
committee gatherings in the 15th
century Pitti Palace, delegates will
consider how Unesco can best carry
out its work as the world organiz-
ation for education, science and
culture.
One question standing out above
all others in the minds of the dele-
gates will be that posed by Unesco's
Executive Board at a recent meeting :
what action can Unesco take, apart
from that already proposed in its
1951 programme resolutions, to con-
tribute vigorously, in the present as
well as in the future, to the United
Nations Mission of peace.
This question was raised at the
Executive Board meeting by M.
Jaime Torres Bodet, Unesco's Direc-
tor-General."There are turning
points in the lives of institutions just
as there are in those of individuals",
he said."I believe that the next
session of the'General Conference
will represent such a turning point
for Unesco, at once for reasons con-
nected with the tnternat strMctMre of
the Organization and for reasons
external to tt.
Peace Today Or
A Future Peace ?
"THE difficulties and the dangersc, vershadowing the world have
become so dressing". M. Torres
Badet pointed out."that it is now
essential for Unesco to shoulder the
responsibilities imposed upon it't5y its
Constitution, as a part of the maehi.
nery of the United Nations and Spe-
cialized Agencies, in the promotion of
peace.
"What exaetly are those responslbi-
lities How can we carry them out ?
And with what peace are we concern-
ed-peace today or peace four a more
or less distant future ? These supre-
mely important questions cannot be
evade", said the Director-General.
"Impelled alike by the process of zits
own development and the condition at
the world, Unesco can and must sub-
ject its methods and aims to a thor-
ough and critical examination, I am
convinced that the fundamental object
of the next session of the General Con-
ference shoulâ be to carry out such
an examination", he added.
To carry out its tasks Unesco follows
a programme planned at three levels :
information and exchange of docu-
mentation and news ; research, in-
vestigation and enquiry aimed at
helping men and women to contribute
actively to mankind's progress ; and
action, either by Unesco directly, or at
its instigation, to assist all countries
to contribute, through culture, educ-
ation and science, to peace.
As there are some tasks which
Unesco cannot undertake immediately
because of lack of funds, but which it
cannot renounce, a Basic Programme,
covering a number of years, has been
prepared and this, together with a
detailed annual programme outlining
the part that can be carried out in
each financial year, will be presented
to the Florence Conference.
Programme activities proposed for
1951 require a bUdget of $ 8, 150, 000-
an increase of $ 150, 000 over the 1950
budget.
How close a co-operation between
Unesco's Member States and its Secre-
tariat is required to carry out such a
programme was recently emphasised
by M. Torres Bodet,"Only through
the will and acts or Member States
can Unesco fulfil its true purpose-
! IALY, HOST TO UNESCO'S
CONFERENCE, WELCOMES
M. TORRES BODET
IT TALY, where preparations are being completed
for the opening of the Fifth Session of Unesco's
General Conference in Florence, on May 22n ,
gave a warm welcome to M. Jaime Torres Bodet,
Unesco's Director-General, during his short visit
there, last month.
On his arrival in Rome, M. Torres Bodet was re-
ceived by H. E. Signor de Gasper, the Prime Minister ;
H. E. Count Sforza, Minister for Foreign Affairs, and
H. E. Signor Ooner.'t, Minister for Education. The
same day, M. Torres Bodet discussed problems con-
cerning the Florence Conference with the authorities.
On Monday, April 17th. he held a press conference
at which he described the aims and activities of
Unesco.
During his recent visit to Italy. M. Jaime Torres Bodet, Unesco's
Director-General, broadcast from Rome on the aims and programme
of Unesco. This photo shows him (left) replying to the questions
of a radio journatist. Translated into 22 languages, his interview
was broadcast in many other countries.
While in Rome, Unesco's Direc-
tor-General was received in au-
dience by Pope Pious XII.
Addressing the recently formed
Italian National Commission for
Unesco. in the impressive setting
of the Palzzio de Venezia, M. Tor-
res Bodet told its members that
Unesco had a major part to play in
every problem of our age.
Dante's Noble words
OUR cause is that of every manon earth,"he said,"And
that cause was described more
than six centuries ago by one of
your own outstanding thinkers in
ringing words as fresh and true
today as when they were first
uttered :
"There is one activity proper to
the human race as a whole which
is the destiny of all men however
many they may be, but to which
no single man, family, village, city
or nation can attain alone. The
nature of that activity becomes
clear when we consider the quality
most characteristic of humanity,
namely the power p {knowing, the
intelligence.
"As such a power cannot attain
its full stature in any single man
or group, it is necessary that the
human species should consist of
many units. Given, then, that
humanity is designed by nature to
develop the total power of the in-
tellect... a first requirement is that
mankind should live in the tran-
ouillity of true peace that it may
the more freely and easily devote
itself to its appointed work. The
conclusion is that universal peace
is the greatest of all the good
thins which make up our felicity."
"Never", said M. Torres Bodet,
"his the connection between peace
and culture of the mind been
stressed more strongly than in
Dante Alighieri's noble words. And
so we find that in the very dawn
of Italian poetry and political
thought, Unesco's path is mapped.
Greatest History Lesson
« Y EST we should misunderstandthis aspect of the problems
of today,"he continued"we
should, however, add that, though
peace is necessary for the de-
velopment of the mind, a huma-
nistic training of thp mind is today
just as necessary for the strength-
ening of international peace.
"If peace is necessary for cul-
ture, culture is also necessary for
peace-and that, gentlemen, is the
greatest lesson that history should
teach us and it is also the ideal
of Unesco."
After leaving Rome, the Direc-
tor-General travelled to Florence
where he was able to inspect the
section of the Pitti Palace to be
used by Unesco's Secretariat dur-
ing the Conference, and the mag-
nificent'hall of the Pallazo Vec-
chio, in which the plenary sessions
will be held.
At Milan, which he visited be-
fore returning to Paris. M. Torres
Bodet was the guest of honour at
a reception given by Count Stefano
Jacini, a member of Unesco's Exe-
cutive Board and leader of the Ita-
lian delegation to the last two
Sessions of the General Conference.
Throughout his Italian journey,
M, Torres Bodet was accompanied
by H. E. Signor Mameli, Director-
General of Cultural Affairs at the
Italian Foreign Office, and by
Signor Alberto de Clementi, Italian
delegate to Unesco.
as a network of mutual services, the
value of which is self evident, asa
collective force working for the trans-
formation of the world,"he stated.
"The Secretariat, no matter how zea-
lous, cannot make up for any apathy
on the part of Member States, for it
can do no more than ser" thelr will
- the motive power for all its work."
Proposals to define clearly both the
tasks of the Secretariat and those of
Member States and a recomendation
that the latter should provide their
Unesco National Commissions wIth
adequate permanent secretariats wi11
be submitted to the Conference. Other
resolutions call on Member States to
etc-operate w'th one another in joint
action for Unesco aims, and suggest
that greater use be ma3e of inter-
national conventions involving the use
of education, science and culture for
progressive and peaceful ends.
" : :,
Creative Genius Of
Florentine Masters
GO-OPERATION will also be the keynoteof a series of special meetings
held in connection w'th the Con-
ference. One of these will group
representatives from National Com-
missions for Unesco and the second,
representatives from the 100 non-
governmental organizations. having
consultative status with the Organiz,-
ation.
Unesco's present membership-
55 nations-is likely to be increased
during the Conference, following its
consideration of memt>ership applic-
ations from Korea the United States
of Indonesia and the Hashemite
Kingdom of Jordan.
Meeting in surroundings which pro-
cla ; m the creative genius of the Flo-
rentine masters, delegates will study
Unesco's plan for the preparation of
a scientific and cultural history of
mankind. And, it is fitting that in
the city of men like Leonardo da
Vinci, Michelangelo, BoWcelli, Mas-
saecio and Donatello, they should be
called on to consider ways of
improving the material and moral
freedom of creative artists.
Among the other important ques-
tions on the Conference agenda are
whether final steps s2'foulð. be taken
for the preparation of a Universal
Convention on Copyright, on the pos-
sibility of founding an international
institute of the press, on the work
already done towards evolving a uni-
form Braille script for the bli, nd and
on Unesco's part in the United Nations
Technical Assistance Programme.
During the Conference, the Italian
Government will sponsor a large-scale
programme of cultural events in Flo-
rence, including exhibition and lec-
tures. The Florence Festival of Music
and Opera, which co-incides with
Unesco's Conference is to include a
Theatre Festival, from May 25th to
June 13th, at which Italian, British
and French companies will perform.

"LEADERS OF WORLD
ORGANIZATIONS MUST
OVERCOME INVISIBLE
OBSTACLES IN THEIR
WORK FOR PEACE'
M. Jaime Torres Bodet, Direc-
tor-General of Unesco
HOW can it possibly be that there is talk of war and thethreat of war, when all the peoples of the world want
peace ? Never before has the primordial horror of war
appeared in an uglier shape. Yet-never before has man had,
within the reach of his arm, greater power for the achievement
of a better, happier and nobler life. Why, then, is there need
to.. work"for peace-to"fij (ht"for peace ?
Mr. Trygve Lie. Secretary Gene-
ral of the United Nations
This staggering paradox is not simple to resolve.'To"save succeeding enerations from the scourge of war". the peoples of the
earth entrusted their dream of peace to the United Nations and its related agencies. These agencies, by practical daily work, are striving
to build a more secure society. One of them. UNESCO, especially concerned with eradicating the ignorance, fear, suspicion and hostility
which permit war and accompany war, is opening the Fifth Session of its General Conference in Florence Italy, this month. The General
Conference has been asked urgently by its Executive Board to consider action designed"to nab ! e UNESCO, as an organization of states, to
contribute vigorously, in the present as well as in the future, to the United Nations mission of peace".
One of the known obstacles to peace is the actual lack of comprehension between peoples and between their spokesmen, which are des-
cribed in the article on this page."They Don't Do it Our Way"was written for UNESCO by Dr. Ina Telberg. employed during 1947
and 1948 as simultaneous interpreter for the United Nations. Dr. Telberg, sociologist and anthropologist, has lived and worked in the
United States, the Soviet Union, India and France.
that many of my friends in America and
England were listening. In a few mi-
nutes, however, I lost every trace of
self-consciousness as Mr. Vishinsky's
Russian carried me away by its sheer
beauty, force, and richness of expression.
Latin quotations, Russian proverbs, even
Shakespearian poetry, were utilized for
the purposes of his attack on the
British and the American positions.
Next day I was startled by the press
reactions. I myself even received some
fan mail : a couple of letters that
denounced me as a Communist for
having interpreted the speech with such
fervor, and another one that praised me
for same. I realized then how unneces-
sarily vitriolic, aggressive, and offensive
the address was when translated : in
fact, how ill-adapted was the Russian,'
oratorical style to delivery in a foreign
tongue. It was not the language-itself,
"W HAT the Distinguished LarJy Representative has just sugges-
ted proves that women can be more than decorative-they
, call also be useful."With this jovial remark, a United States Delegate looked at
his Soviet Colleague in the Population Commission of the United Nations
and awaited a smile of response. None came. The Russian sat stiff and
unsmiling. In Russia there are no jokes about women drivers or women
delegates, so beloved by the Americans. The Russian conception of
courtesy, therefore, forbade the Soviet Delegate to do anything but freeze
into a silent disapproval. The well-meaning American attempt to find
common ground by means of a joke thus increased, rather than decreased,
the psychological distance between the two delegations.
The foregoing instance of a difference
in the sense of humour illustrates one
of the aspects involved in the problem
of cross-cultural understanding, which
is today preoccupying social scientists
and which may well affect every
individual's day-by-day life. What the
social scientists mean by culture is not
the arts of a nation, in the sense of
painting, sculpture, or poetry, but the
totality of the patterns of thinking and
acting transmitted through generations
from father to son, and absorbed, with
deviations and in varying degrees, by all
participants in the life of the nation.
So deeply rooted is our cultural
heritage that we are rarely conscious of
it. To us, it is the"human"way of
behaving, the"natural", the proper and
the expected. Any other behaviour we
are apt to consider"difficult","pecu-
liar","unreasonable", or"unpredic-
table".. tao social anthropologists,
however, each culture has its own inner
consistency, its own inherent order,
which makes it, in a lesser or greater
measure, workable, predictable, and
comprehensible.
One Man's Meal...
ONE of the most deeply rooted, andlargely unconscious, features of
any culture is what the psychol-
ogists call the time perspective. Within
the United Nations, at least three diffe-
rent time perspectives operate.
"Gentlemen, it is time for lunch, we
must adjourn", announces the Anglo-
Saxon chairman, in the unabashed belief
that having three meals a day at regular
hours is the proper way for mankind to
exist.
"But why ? We haven't finished what
we were doing", replies-in a puzzled
manner that grows rapidly more impa-
(FROM"RACES OF MANKIND"BY RUTH BENEDICT ANDGENE WELT WISH),
tient-an Eastern European Delegate,
in whose country people eat when the
inclination moves them and every
family follows its own individual time-
table.
"Why, indeed ?" placidly inquires
the Far Eastern representative, hailing
from a country where life and time are
conceived as a continuous stream, with
no man being indispensable, with no
life-process needing to be interrupted
for any human being, and where
members of electoral bodies walk in and
out of the room quietly, getting a bite to
eat when necessary, talking to a friend
when pleasant ; but where meetings,
theatre performances, and other arrang-
ed affairs last without interruption for
hours on end, while individuals come
and go, are replaced by others, meditate
or participate as the occasion requires,
without undue strain, stress, or nervous
tension.
As one or the other group persists in
its own conception of the time per-
spective, as the Anglo-Saxons demand
that the duration of meetings and
conferences be fixed in advance and
that meals be taken regularly at fixed
hours, and as the Russians sit irritated
and the Latins puzzled and the Secre-
tariat frantic-as this condition
continues, mutual friction grows, mur-
murs of"unreasonableness"are heard
around the room ; and, when the issue
under discussion is an important one,
overt accusations are hurled across the
room of,"insincerity",., lack of a
serious approach to the problem", and
even"sabotage".
Irony Or Poetry
ANOTHER frequent source of irritation,rooted deeply in the cultural dif-
ferences among nations, is the
length and the style of oration.
The Latins are usually accused of
unnecessary length and of equally
unnecessary flights of poetic fancy. The
Russians are disliked both for the length
of their speeches and for the irony and
sarcasm of the speeches'content. The
utilization of irony in political speeches
is a long-standing tradition of public
oratory in Russia. It has nothing to do
with the Soviet Government. Mr. Vi-
shinsky, for example, most noted for
this type of oration, was born, trained,
and had had considerable success as
trial lawyer and political orator, long
before the establishment of the Soviet
Government.
It was in November, 1946, that I was
flown to Lake Success from the
Nurnberg Trials. I was tired, sleepy, and
a stranger to the United Nations. On
November 15th Vishinsky was deliver-
ing his now-famous veto speech in the
Political Committee at Lake Success. A
regular interpreter failed, and I was
rushed to the microphone in the middle
of the speech. I remember how my
voice trembled when I first began to
speak. I knew that I was on the air, and
however, that was the obstacle. It was
the tradition behind the language ; what
I have since learned to call speech eti-
quette..-
Settling A"Grave"Issue
THE Latins, on the other hand, farfrom employing sarcasm, prefer to
sprinkle their speeches with a
liberal amount of poetic imagery, meta-
physical expressions, and literary allu-
sions.

ings in Paris, a Latin-American dele-
'gate pleaded for the inclusion of the
phrase,"from the cradLe to the grave",
in the Article of the Declaration of
Human Rights dealing with social secur-
ity. He wanted to insure that a worker,
or, rather, a citizen, should be covered
by measures of social protection in just
'that manner : from the cradle to the
grave. He meant precisely, literally,
what he said.
"Such phrases have no place in a

Latin-American Way
His difference in both the styles oforatory and the time concept was
once forcefully brought to, the
attention of the Assembly at the meet-
ing of the Social Committee in Paris.
There, a Cuban delegate, tired of
constant interruptions from the Chair-
man of the speeches of his Latin-Am-
erican colleagues, pleaded that :
"Not being all Nordics and Anglo-
Sa. rons, tue cannot fit into the pattern
of brevity, terseness, and conciseness
which you demand of us, Mr. Chairman.
Such patterns befit the Northerners, but

emotional, moving... From our point of
view we are not deviating from the
substance of the matter, as it is our way
of dealing with the matter."

, delegate.
,"It's a. legal document-not a
poem", muttered a Benelux member.
A member of the United States Deleg-
ation whispered darkly into a neigh-
bor's ear :
"Why not'from womb to tomb' ? At
least it rhymes !"
Before the final text of the Article
was settled upon, several other poetical
versions were suggested. Some others,
quite unprintable, shortly made the
rounds of the corridors outside the
conference rooms.

: ASE THE PSYCHOLOGICAL DISTANCE
S.
English-language speeches, conversely,
fall flat on both the Slav and the Latin
ear. English understatements-and
almost all English language speeches
are understatements from the Slav and
the Latin points of view-need to be
interpreted with particular skill into
Spanish and Russian, if they are to be
convincing. Rendered into Russian,
they particularly lack emphasis,
although there are some notable excep-
tions.
Ii is, for instance, impossible for any
of Sir Carl Berendson's remarks to lack
emphasis. It is equally impossible for
Mrs. Vijaya Lakshmi Pandit of India
to be either misunderstood or unappre-
ciated when she speaks in English and
is simultaneously interpreted into Spa-
nish, French, Russian, and Chinese.
These rare combinations in the same
speaker, however, of Latin fire, Russian
irony, and Anglo-Saxon precision are
exceptions to the rule.
Hospitality May
Cause Hostility
STILL another aspect of the problemof cross-cultural understanding
which looms large on the inter-
national scene lies in the differing
concepts of hospitality. When a social
anthropologist enters a new area his
first project usually consists in fam-
iliarizing himself with the hospitality
patterns prevailing within the group he
has come to study. The understanding
of such patterns provides him with a
key to social intercourse. In the United
Nations, differing concepts of hospital-
ity as between the East and the West
have been noted by this observer as
contributing to increasing coolness bet-
ween Delegations, and even as being
subject to sinister interpretations.
I remember the party at which this
was first brought home to me. It was
an afternoon when the American Deleg-
ation was host to other Delegations,
and the cocktail lounge was filling
rapidly as meeting after meeting was
breaking up. The bar was crowded with
trays of hors d'oeuvres, ice-bowls, and
bottles. The Delegates were jostling
one another, pushing jovially,'shouting
their orders at the servers. The Russians
stood stiffly, not touching either food or
drink. I tried to get one of the Soviet
Delegates a glass of vodka, but he
clutched any sleeve in an agony of
embarrassment.
"No, no, you mustn't. How can you ?..
It is not pottte..."
No Russian will take drink or food
offered by others unless he is repeatedly
and urgently pressed to do so, by his
hosts. This, like. the demands of platform
eloquence, has nothing to do with the
Soviets. This is a matter of the Russian
"culture", the code of behavior that is
part of the total pattern of living, and
has been for ages past. To disregard
it, in the giving and receiving of hospi-
tality, is a sign of immodesty, forward-
ness, rudeness, and, in general, extre-
mely bad manners. The Russians left
this party early ; as inter-cultural hos-
pitality, it was not a success.
This strict code has its other side
also : just as the guest can take
refreshments only from his host, so
the host must offer his hospitality
repeatedly before it is accepted. The
casual patterns of American hospitality,
administered with jcvial good humor,
have no counterpart in Russia. There,
the first offer of food or drink is merely
perfunctory ; it is only when the second,
third, fourth, and fifth come that the
Russian knows he is welcomed. This
phase of Russian culture has on occasion
been satirized by various Russian
writers, the most noted example being
Krylev's"Demian's Fish-chowder".
In that story, the guest is pressed to eat
and drink to the point where in despe-
ration he grabs his hat and flees. I have
also heard repeated complaints and
even sinister interpretations of this
Russian custom, from American visitors
to Russia. A number of diplomatic
memoirs mention that Russians press
food and drink on their guests while
eating sparingly, and drinking even less,
themselves. That, of course, is quite
true. But hospitality offered in the
casual Western manner can only mean
a studied insult to a Russian.
The Origin Of Man
LIFE itself is prized differently indifferent cultures. To die of
peaceful old age is the ideal
life pattern in some parts of the world.
Death for a country or an ideal is the
desirable social behavior in others.
Nowhere have these differences been
made so manifest as in the drafting of
the Declaration of Human Rights.
"Man is of divine origin, endowed by
nature with reason and conscience",
argued several Latin-American dele-
gates.
"At life is of divine origin, not only
human life", a representative of a
Buddhist state murmured gently."Is
it not vanity to attribute divine origin
to human life alone ?"
"Man is not divine. He is rooted in
the very land he tills, in the soil that
bred him", once stated an Eastern
European Delegate from a preponder-
antly agricultural area. The Soviets
suggested tactfully that science had
reservations on the whole subject. The
Anglo-Saxon bloc, evidently not quite
definite on the subject of human divi-
nity, kept still. ,''t.,-<
Confusion Over China
HUMOUR relief is not infrequentlyprovided by the very cultural
differences that are usually so
productive of misunderstandings.
On one occasion, a misunderstanding
was particularly startling :
"Gentlemen, gentlemen, let us not act
in this matter live an elephant in a china
shop !"
As this remark was being rendered
from the Russian into English, a lan-
guage in which the Chinese Delegate
was following proceedings, he promptly
raised his hand.
"Mr. Chairman, I should life the
Soviet Delegate to explain just what
China has to do with his objections".
"Mr. Chairman, I said nothing
whatever about China. The Chinese
Delegate must have misunderstood".
"Mr. Chairman, I distinctly heard my
country mentioned. I request an e. rpta-
nation".
To the social scientist, misunder-
standings such as those cited here are
less humorous ones than they are tragic
and deplorable. In a world already
strained with conflicting economic in-
terests and political ambitions, misun-
derstandings based on cross-cultural
ignorance can scarcely be excused. The
social sciences of today-social psy-
chology, cultural anthropology, sociol-
ogy-provide tools for interpreting and
gauging human behavior, regardless of
how alien a culture may be. During
the war, these tools were used, many
with quite startling success, in psychol-
ogical warfare. They can be used for
peace as well.
Anyone can learn any language, but interns-
tional understanding requires more than a mere
knowledge 01 tongues.

Ritchie Calder. ScienceEditor of the London
News Chronicle. re-
cently returned from a per-
sonal survey, carried out in
collaboration with the Na-
tural Sciences Department
of Unesco, of the work
going on to reclaim the
deserts of North Africa and,
the Middle East for human
use.
In its last two issues, the
"Courier"reprinted some
of the articles written by him
during his 15. 500 mile jour-
ney, which were distribut-
ed to newspapers through-
out the world.
On this page is reprinted
the last of the"Men Against
the Desert"articles in which
Ritchie Caller. cabling from
Cyprus, sketches some im-
pressions of his eleven
weeks tour against the back-
ground of an island where
men are winning the battle
against the desert.
MEN AGAINST THE DESERT
POSTSCRIPT TO A MISSION
By Ritchie CALDER
Science Editor, LondonÞ News Chronicle
*
"The immediate challenge
is that of the man-made
desert. What man has
done, man can by brains
and sweat undo."Effi-
cient damming controls
water-flow makes navi-
gation easier and saves
valuable land for culti-
vation. But this is a rare
example. Only too oftenrivers are allowed to go
as they please, erode fer-
tile land, rise in flood and
cut communications.
(Photos : Indian Air Sur-
vey and Transport Ltd.)
IN Libya an Eighth Army veteran who had stayed behindto wage war against the desert itself suggested to me
that in order to study desert problems schoolchildren
should construct sandtables-model terrain like those used
by the Army when planning operations.
Fans could act as prevailing winds (reproducing wind
erosion and advancing dunes overwhelming oases), water
trickles could show wadhi erosion, and matchsticks form
windbreaks, etc.
On a larger scale Cyprus could be my sandtable. An
island. half the size of Wales, it provides in miniature not
only desert conditions but what can be done about them.
That is why from next month a soil-conservation confe-
rence will be held by all Middle East countries to discuss
and see how deserts can be arrested.
On my journey I have seen two categories of desert-
climatic and man-made. The climatic desert is found
where rainfall is too low to sustain vegetation. Even that
is not hopeless when you remember Saharan scientists
saying"We are walking on water."
Underground lakes and underground rivers are await-
ing tapping,"Microclimate"-dew precipitation-is not
properly understood and not exploited.
Remember the dew-mounds, heaps of pebbles which sus-
tained civilization centuries ago in barren sun-scorched
Negev, where there is less than four inches of annual
rain. No, no, climatic deserts are not hopeless.
Ten Men Who Be ! ieve
BUT the immediate challenge is that of the man-made desert. What
man has done man can by brains and sweat undo.
One moonlight night on a desert plateau above the Kasserine Gap,
Charles Sausmagne, Tunisian Inspector-General, a veteran Man Against
the Desert, said to me :
"Tell me that there are ten men in the world who believe the desert
can be made to bear fruit and will redeem the stupidities 01 mankind,
and I will dine happy."
Now I can give him not ten but hundreds-men and women whom I
know by name slaving sacrificially in the desert.
d t 
ry  r rt t .)
One country where important victories have been won by men over the desert
is Palestine. Hard work by the desert"soldiers"-colonists like this Jewish
shepherd (above)-has transformed former arid ground into flourishing fruit
groves and lush grazing ground.
A JOURNEY ENDS-ITS LESSONS CONTINUE
THERE was a crowd of school boys waiting to welcome Ritchie Calderat Croydon Airport, London, when he landed there on the 30th March
after his 2 months long desert journey. Pupils of 15000 English
schools, and millions of readers in 28 countries have followed his 15, 500
mile trek from Beni Abbes in Algeria, along the North African coastline
to Egypt, Baghdad and Teheran, to the new Israel, and finally to Cyprus.
Man's fight against the desert in the vast water-starved areas of North
Africa and the Near East was the theme of his message. His running
commentaries from science outposts and field-stations captured the imagi-
nation of readers of some 40 publications in many countries which
published the Calder desert story. Sixteen thousand letters, mainly from
school boys, testify to the interest this project has already aroused.
The"Men Against the Desert"project was something more than an
important journalistic reportage ; it also introduced a novel aspect in
modern journalism-its direct utilization in schools and adult education
classes.
It was a co-operative enterprise, for whose success, Unesco, the United
Kingdom National Commission, the British Ministry of Education, the
London News Chronicle and many other publications-including esperan-
tist-have made important contributions.
Now the desert traveller is home again, but the material he and his
photographer collected has as yet, been far from fully utilized. Film-
strips to teach geography, history, classics, and religious history will be
made in co-operation with the English National Committee for Visual
Aids in Education.
Further articles will be written and lectures given on the subject, and
there is material enough for a book on the desert journey.
Tne Calder reportage, undertaken on the initiative of Unesco, shows
how journalists can serve Unesco's aims-by making man's fight against
a hostile environment known and understood, by showing how modern
science serves man in popularising the theme of"Food and People", and
explaining how other people live.
Above all, the"Men Against the Desert"articles are testimony of the
every-day drama and heroism which accompany man's progress-often
slow and painful-through education science and culture.
They not only believe, but are doing, acting
not only in faith and knowledge, but from
results.
From here in a forest look-out post, pinnac-
led 2, 000 ft., I see below my"sandtable",
Cyprus is not arid but the wet season rains are
a curse as well as a blessing. The unchecked
run-off scours the mountains leaving naked
rock, rips great gullies in her fertile soil and
flushes silt into the Mediterranean.
A grilling summer sun scorches the island
and burns the sand to dust. Man's wanton-
ness through the centuries has aided the
process of turning this rich island to desert.
But in the last twenty years man has
begun to make amends. Forest experts,
soil conservators, water engineers and the
British administration are carrying out in
concentrated form measures I have seen put
into action at various points throughout the
journey.
, From the pinnacle I see grim reminders :
Bald mountains, deep scars, gully erosion.
But I see also green hope-cropped plains
watered by the harnessed wadhis, groves of
olives, carobs and vine, The panorama is of
fields contour-ploughed on the slopes to check
soil sluicing, and terraces like great window-
boxes on the steeper hillsides.
The marching dunes are now manacled by
binding vegetation. But most significant are
the infant forests on the ranges below me.
Bare five years ago, ravaged by fuel-gatherers
and goats.
Wood was the only fuel for the islanders.
Limekilns, looking from the pinnacle like
young volcanoes, were stoked with trees until
the law made oilftring compulsory.
blosssoming here because Cyprus has checked wandering men, wandering
goats, wandering sand and wandering winds.
All through the deserts of North Africa and the Middle East I have
seen men triumphing against the desert. I have learned countless lessons
and found abundant hope.
Eagerly, scientists are grappling with the desert. They have welcomed
Unesco's proposed international co-operation and exchange and Unesco's
campaign to remind the world of the forgotten Men against the Desert.

ORUGOAY IS BIJI1DING NEWEST
'\.
LATIN AMERMAN SCIENCE MBSEBM
Montevideo's'Science and Modern Man"Museum is to be installed in the city's magnificent Palacio Muni-
cipal (City Hall). Intended as a centre for the popularization of science in Uruguay, the museum will behoused in the wing shown on the right of the architect's drawing (above).
MONTEVIDEO, capital city of Uruguay, already notedfor its great modern hospital nd its schools of
engineering and architecture, is soon to have one
of the most modern science museums in Latin America.
With the general theme of"Science and Modern Man",
this new museum, to be housed in the magnificent Palacio
Municipal, will be the country's centre for the populariza-
tion of science.
The idea for this modern museum of science was
conceived in talks between members of Montevideo's
Municipal Commission of Culture and Dr. A. Establier,
Head of Unesco's Field Science Office for Latin America.
Through Unesco's Division for the Popularization of
Science, technical assistance was given on all aspects of
planning. Mr W. Stephen Thomas, Director of the
Rochester Museum of Natural History, at the request of
Unesco, acted as consultant.
THE LESSON BECAME A CRUSADE
IN a certain United States city hygienic conditions ina number of public eating places were unsatisfactory.
Each day newspapers published articles and letters
on the need for a"clean-up". Finally, however, it was
the students of a class in 9th year Health Biology who
went into action and brought about a great improvement
in the standard of sanitation.
How the. se students did it as a regular part of their
school activity is told by John S. Richardson in a report
sp. ecially written for Unesco's Division for the Dissemi-
nation of Science (Introduction of Experimental Science
in the Elementary and Secondary Schools of the United
States. UNESCOjNSjPSIj9).
"The newspaper accounts",
writes Mr. Richardson,"were
brought to class each day
and analyzed for facts and
assumptions. Finally the class
accepted and defined three or
four of the most significant
problems. These problems
dealt with the cleanliness of
hamburger shops, soda noun-
tains and the like.
"In the process of discussion.
the students had to arrive at
definitions as to what consti-
tutes cleanliness. They decid-
ed that the one way to get
information was by observa-
tion and experiment. Sterile
culture plates were made, and
then students set out to expose
the culture plates to the air
in the. eating places.
EVIDENCE BY FLASHLIGHT
PERMISSION was obtainedfrom attendants to expose
the cloths with which
they wiped the counters. The
cleanliness of the attendants'
ciothing as well as their hands
and finger nails was noted.
The students checked the state
of floors, and took cultures of
dishes that had been washed.
Two boys even went to a
popular hamburger shop after
closing hours and obtained a
l1ashlight picture through the
window of food on the counter
inside.
"Cultures were propp. rly
grown and compared with
"ontro] cultures. The students
asked that a bacteriologist
from the county health de-
partment come to the class
and examine their evidence
and help them identify some
of the bacteria on the plates.
They made pure cultures of
some of the bacterial strains,
strained them and identified
some of the more common
types.
"Many periods were spent in
recording, organizing and in-
terpreting the evidence. Re-
ports were formulated and
criticized in class and conclu-
SIons relating to the stated
problems were drawn.
CLEAN UP OR CLOSE UP
PERHAPS the most interest-ing and significa  ou
come occurred when the
class decided without thp
knowledge of the teacher to
take some action. This action
took the form of letters
written to local papers, all of
which were published, and
others were written to p : aces
that had been found to be un-
sanitary, threatening boycott
unless certain practices of good
sanitation, which were set
forth in the letter, were insti-
tuted.
"The result was a very sharp
and observable clean-up OJ
almost all of the local ham-
burger and soda places which
were frequented by the stu-
dents.
This Report is the first in a
series intended to stimulate
discussion on the responsible
and difficult task of"teaching
for thinking". One of the best
ways of doing this seems to be
to make the pupils actively
acquainted with the scientific
approach to things.
A second report."The
Teaching of Science in
Elementary and secondary
Schools in Switzerland" (UN-
ESCO/NS PSI/10.) is also
available on request to Unesco.
One important reason for
spreading the scientific way
of thinking in the modern
world is to ensure a rational
approach to social problems.
A science museum is an
instrument whereby this
kind of general knowledge
about science can be diffu-
sed.
See and Understand
MR. STEPHEN THOMAS, Wri-ting about the impor-
tance of such institu-
tions, said : *'Museums are
not merely p I ace s for
preservation of-specimens,
and thus static and inert, they
o : re active and alive. They
exhibit material in an attrac-
tive and lively manner, and
at the same time carry or
extensive educational pro-
grammes.
"Because such museums
teach through visual edu-
cation-use of objects in
three dimensions-they can
reach an classes of people
However, the important thing
is that the exhibits convej)
ideas and thus serve in the
interpretation of facts and
principLes which are found
most difficuLt to convey
through the written word.
One has to see to understand.
Museums of science of this
type, designed for and sup-
ported by the community,
will soon become among the
most important institution !
of civiLized people".
In this museum self-ope-
rating exhibits consisting of
animated panel displays will
present highlights of the phy-
sical sciences under such
titles as,"The Sun, Source of
An Power","What is Mat-
ter ?"and"'The Water Cy-
cte".
A series of small models,
similar to those in The
Franklin Institute in Philadel-
phia, demonstrating magnets,
conductors, pendulums, etc.,
which can be operated by the
visitor, will show some of the
natural laws of physics. From
this point displays will de-
monstrate the relationship of
mathematics to other scien-
ces ; potential and kinetic
energy ; primitive tools and
mechanisms, and finally, mo-
dern mechanisms as applica-
tions of simple machines.
One section with the theme
"Man Controls His Environ-
ment", will reveal the
changes man has made in
nature through such applied
sciences as electricity, optics,
photography and atomic
energy. Modern industry in
Uruguay will be represented
by scale models of national
refrigerator plants, oil refi-
n e r i e s and hydroelectric
power systems.
Mature On Display
A SECOND division of them museum will depict
nature and natural prin-
ciples with special emphasis
on Uruguay. Here will be
demonstrated growth in
plants and animals, repro-
duction and race preserva-
tion, and the distribution of
living things. To illustrate
the latter, a series of habitat
groups or small dioramas will
show Uruguayan plant and
animal life in such biological
zones as sea-coast, open
forest and grasslands.
Climaxing these exhibits in
an adjacent hall will be a
section on the biology of man.
Here will be displayed models
showing the functions of the
human body as well as food,
human diseases and a series
of special exhibits on the
cultural progress of man.
This museum is a tribute
to the enlightened Uruguyan
attitude towards science and
constitutes an example of
how Unesco helps to translate
ideas into realities.
THE CAUSE OF FOOT AND MOUTH DISEASE
This photo, exclusive to Unesco and supplied by the University of Lyons, France, is dramatic proof
of what modern science can achieve in the fight against disease. After five months of intensive work,
scientists at the French Institute of Foot and Mouth Disease, in Lyons, isolated and photographed for
the first time this virus, the micro-organism responsible for the disease which each year causes
immense losses to the world's livestock supplies. Viruses are responsible for such diseases as small-
pox, yellow fever, poliomyelitis, influenza and the common cold. The foot and mouth disease virus,
however, is the smallest hat scientists have ever had to deal with. It has a diameter of about 20
to 30 millionths of a micron, a micron being one thousandth of a millimetre. Compared with it, the
viruses of influenza and fowl pest are ados ! ten times bigger. To. discover it the French scientists used
the electron-microscope, and in. the above photograph the virus is enlarged 42. 000 times. In the
circle appear at least ten of the virus of Foot and Mouth Disease.
TWO YEW UNE : ECO
i
UNESCO'S Division for the Populariza-tion of Science (Natural Sciences De
partment) has obtained the rights
for the distribution of articles appearing
in the British science journal.'DISCO-
VERY".
These are to be distributed on an exclu-
sive basis, for a preliminary test period, to
science magazines in other parts of the
world. Science journals interested in this
service are requested to write for informa-
tion to UNESCO.
An arrangement has also been made
with Cornell University, waiving fees on
the Cornell Rural School Leaflet which,
through UNESCO, can be made available
in any country.
These leaflets are world-famous for the
simple and intimate manner in which they
enable science to be taught, often with the
sole use of everyday objects.

THE ART FILM
IN ITALY
TODAY more people than ever before are learning both to enjoyand understand art, thanks to the cinema. The recent rapid and
widely international development of art films was demonstrated
last February, for example, at the Second International Congress of
Art Films in Brussels. Delegates were able to see and judge over 40 films
produced in 15 countries since 1948,
Although the production of art films in many of these countries
is a comparatively new development, it dates back in Italy to the 1920's
when the producer Bragaglia made a documentary on the Etruscan
city of Tarquinia.
Most of the early films, however, were intended. to serve educa-
tional purposes ; they were not conceived by artists and made no claim
to being artistic productions.
Among the first Italian efforts was a series of films which brought
to the screen the works of such celebrated Italian masters as Titian,
Tintoretto and Paolo Uccello.
A"Dead-End"Technique
THIS was àn"art album"approach to the production of art filmswhich told no.'story"and t us cons ituted a kind of"dead-end"
with little prospect of development. The real future lay in films
having an aesthetic appeal of their own, in addition to presenting a
succession of photographs of paintings, statues and monuments.
Thus, in a second type of document-
ary, works of art were compared with
the actual landscapes that inspired
them. A typical film of this kind was
the fine documentary on the work of
the 18th Century Italian engraver
Piraneso, produced over 15 years ago.
An Interpretative School
E second technique is obviously a
marked improvement on the first.
Greater life is infused into the film
by this alternation between the work of
art and the source of its actual inspi-
ration. Some idea of movement-
though of the simplest kind-is also
introduced, and the canons of cinema
art are thus more faithfully observed
than in the case of mere inert photo-
graphy.
In 1940, however, two young pro-
rHE BIRTH OF A WORK OF ART AND HOW
IT TAKES FORM IN THE ARTIST'S MAGI-
NATION ARE CLEARLY REVEALED IN THE
ITALIAN ART FILM BASED ON"THE DEPO-
SITION", BY RAPHAEL, This painting.
(left) with Ra-
ducers, Emmer and Gras, struck
out along completely new lines by
treating the picture not as an indivi-
sible whole, but as an object whose
qualities can be brought out brilliant-
ly by the film through skilful cutting.
In earlier types of documentary art
film, the commentary was of no ar-
tistic value, while the musical ac-
companiment was meaningless, bearing
no aesthetic relationship to the subject
treated.
Each of Emmer's films (BotticeUi,
Giotto, Beato, Angelico, Carpaccio,
Bosch) has music specially composed
for it, whilst the commentary is
usually spoken by artists, who bring
to the task their imagination and
special knowledge.
This new development has spread
abroad, and in France, England and
America, many producers now use
Emmer's methods for documentaries
on paintings. This is a triumph of
film technique and one of the most
interesting contemporary experiments
in the interpretation of one art in
terms of another.
HOW AN ART FILM IS MADE. This photo shows the shooting of"The
World of the Greeks"by the Italian producers Cesare Ardolino and
Gian-Luigi Polidoro. The equipment, known as a"boom", on which
the camera is mounted provides greater mobility in taking film shots,
and was being used here for the first time in the production of this typeof art film in Italy.
UNESCO

PROBLEMS OF THE MODERN THEATRE
discussed in German stage review
AFTER an interval of five years, the"Review of
Theatre Technique" (Die Buehnentechnische
Rundschau) a two-monthly periodical, has now
resumed publication in Berlin.
It contains articles and illustrations on all technical
aspects and problems of the modern theatre, from new
production techniques and stage-management to
lighting, as well as discussions of fundamental concep-
tions of the role of the theatre.
The review is mainly concerned with the development
of an unadulterated style of theatrical production in
which engineers, painters, architects and actors combine
efforts to stage drama as one integrated work of art in
the fullest sense of the term.
Contributors to the first new issue include André
Boll, the famous French theatre specialist who analyses
problems of theatrical production and stage-style
against the background of the modern French theatre.
The editor, Walter Unruh, is currently collecting
material on theatre reconstruction, architecture and
techniques in Germany for incorporation in a Theatre
Exhibition to be held in Paris next month in connection
with the Third Congress of the Unesco-sponsored Inter-
national Theatre Institute. Later in the year it is
planned to show this exhibition in other countries.

For Ram Char'era
--
"ABSTRACTS"
are practical
EACH ONE TEACH ONE.-In
India, as in those other countries
where the problem of illiteracy is
greatest, there is a shortage 01
trained teachers.
Fortunately, every
one who has at-
ready received so-
me instruction can
help others to
learn reading and
writing. This ph010
from the Centrul
Provinces of India
shows a Hindu lad
sharing his know-
ledge with some
Muslim friends.
N the little town of AdiIabad in
I rural India, a teacher, aided byUnesco, is guiding both a
seven-year-old boy and his 35-year-
old father along the road of
reading and writing which leads to
more active, more creative and
happier lives.
Little Ram Chandra was eager
from the very beginning, but his
father had been apathetic."Why",
he asked"should a poor and igno-
rant man learn to read about the
great world outside this valley ?
Why should he puzzle his tired
brain over the poetry of a man
named Tagore ? What good is all
this to me-and what good will it
be to my son ?"
But the teacher persuaded the
father that there are good reasons for
both of them to learn to read and
write.-Soon, father and son will learn
from books the cause of the"strange''
illness which frequently hits their fa-
mily. They will know that dysentery
is caused by pol : uted water from the
old well on the North Road, or carried
by swarms of flies in their house.
And they will learn that it may be
checked, even in Adilabad.
Ram and his father are being taught
to read and write so that they may
improve their lives with such facts,
and others-how to build a chimney
and fireplace with mud, why their
courtyard space should be planted
with vegetables, and how reasonable it
is to learn handicraft and practical
trades.
Bugs On Paper
T) AM'S teacher wants literacy tobring the world s experience about
prenatal care and baby health
into the home of Ram's father and
mother. Many other useful, definite
objectives for the people of Adilabad
loom before this teacher as he labours
to eliminate illiteracy. Naturally, he
also wishes to bring cultural enjoyment
to Ram and his father, including the
poetry of Tagore. But first things
first.
Similar objectives are before teachers
in Southern Italy, Indonesia, Tunisia,
Chile and among Eskimos in Green-
land-wherever there is a person
working to help another comprehend
the"bugs on paper". These"whys"
of literacy work depend largely upon
the"how"it may be accomplished.
The tools are important, shaping
human lives. The published"tools"
of the world-wide literacy programme
are varied and they issue forth in a
flood of matter in many languages.
The Secretariat of Public Education
in Mexico City issues a book of 112 pa-
ges which is a"primer"for literacy
teachers of modest education. A Lon-
don publisher prints a series of book-
lets as follow-up reading for the
newly literate. The Northern Rhode-
sia Publicity Office makes a film-strip
available showing the"each one teach
cne"system of helping people learn to
read and write. And it goes on for
hundreds of pages, the roster of the
materials which can be obtained by
teachers.
Briefing By Unesco
BUT where is this list, and how doesone come by it if one is a teach r
in Adilabad or the mountains of
Chile ? The teacher of Ram Chandra
provides the answer. He studies each
month a folio of 12 pages or more
which is published by Unesco, at
Unesco House, in Paris, under the title,
"Fundamental Education Abstracts."
He is"briefed"in this folio on the
late t publishing and'film-making de-
velopments in the field of fundamental
education, just as doctors are kept
informed of scientific developments
through the printed abstr, acts which
circulate throughout the world.
Thumbing through one of these
folios, one finds that a report has been
published On the Development of
Broadcasting to Africans in Central
Africa."The actual schedule of one
week's programmes is included, along
with an analysis of difficulties and
progress. This is a technique which
can be useful in many rural areas
where the village gathers about one
radio to listen to the world.
And there is another study of work
among 250 illiterates of Rome."Self-
government within the group of youths,
and extensive use of the library are
marked features."
Unesco includes general publications
which are useful after literacy is
achieved. Among these are pamphlets
giving clear directions on how the
people of a village can save their soil
from erosion. Another is titled,
"Improving Our Community Homes".
There are lists of textbooks, and in-
structions for making educational
films. Of equal significance are lists
of works on community responsibilities
and the international aspects of mo-
dern citizenship. In each case the
source, price and ordering arrange-
ments are given, as well as-a brief
summary of the subject.
To Live Fuller Lives
cm A BSTRACTS"are printed inEnglish, Spanish and French.
They are distributed to libra-
ries, teacher-training institutions, field
missions in fundamental education,
and other key locations throughout
the world where the data are of maxi-
mum, immediate value. There,
teachers and field workers consult
"abstracts"and order the books, pam-
phlets, films or other materials essen-
tial for their programmes, or for fur-
thering their own technical know-
ledge.
A small staff of experts in Unesco
prepares materials, advises on lan-
guage problems and serves as a world
clearing-house for fundamental edu-
cation. They also publish four times
a year a Bulletin hi which typically
successful programmes are analyzed
and illustrated as examples. In one
recent Bulletin, a 13-page article by a
British administrative officer described
literacy, health, agricultural and con-
struction work among Nigerian tribes.
Others dealt with Indian, Egyptian,
Chinese and Latin-American program-
mes in fundamental education.
Unesco staff people also prepare
audio-visual devices and exhibits for
special field tours to demonstrate mo-
dern methods for speedier teaching.
All these services are organized to aid
the teacher and field worker"to help
men, and women to live fuller lives in
adjustment with their changing-envi-
ronment, to develop the best elements
in their own cultures, to enable them
to take their place in the modern
world, and to live together in peace."
"Founded by William R. George near
New York, this Republic comprises 247
acres of ground and about 10 houses...
It has a Sag, a national anthem and a
national festival ; its citizens'ages range
from 6 to 18. Most of them come
from the poor districts of New York and
were pickpockets or horse thieves before
becoming free citIzens of the Republic.
But at Freetown they have neither the
desire nor the time to steal ; all their
energies are taken up with the adminis-
tration of their Republic."This was
how the Paris newspaper"Le Temps"
described this Children's Republic-the
first in the U. S.-in its issue of May 3,
1900.
Joseph Louis Gay-Lussac
Although Joseph Louis Gay-Lussac
was born the son of poor peasants and
was obliged to teach himself mathema-
tics, his life was marked by an impres-
sive series of discoveries. Gay-Lussac
was one of the first great figures In
modern science, In both physics and
chemistry, and we owe to him the first
statement of the law of combination of
gases ; the discovery of boron and boric
acid, cyanogen and prussic acid, and the
Invention of the siphon barometer.
When he died, on 9 May 1850, this great
French scientist had confirmed the
union of physics and chemistry.

The birthdays of a child, events in the lives of individual men and
women, commemoration of the births and deaths of men and women
who have lit torches along the road of history, red-letter days marking
the advance of mankind-these are dates traditionally noted in the arbi-
trary system of reckoning which we call the calendar.
Not forgetting the unknown and unsung persons and events, perhaps
of equal greatness, making no claim at completeness, here are some note-
worthy dates in May, fifth month of the Gregorian calendar.
This Peruvian poet, born in wma on
14 May 1875, was one of the first to sing
of the natural beauties of America.
"Walt Whitman has the North", he used
to say,"but the South is mine". For
his first volume of poems which showed
the influence of socialism, he was sent
to prison. Later on, freed from connec-
tions with any party or school, he tried
to bring together Spain and America in
his work ; he felt, he said, at once
"Indian and Spaniard, conquistador and
sun-worshipper".
Fl'idtjof Nansen
Nansen's exploits
as an athlete and
a Polar explorel
would alone have
won him fame, and
the popularity or
skiing and win teal
sports in general is
largely due to him.
He was, however.
above all, deeply
devoted to the
cause of justice
and peace. In 1918
he worked for the repatriation of pin-
soners of war, but three years later he
failed to persuade the League of Nations
to aid in famine rel1ef in Russia. He
therefore set to work with the help of
the Red Cross and with what govern-
ment assistance he could get. By em-
ploying all those who were ready to
assist, without distinction of creed or
party, he succeeded in saving the lives
of one and a half million people.
Awarded the Nobel peace prize in 1923,
and presented with the equivalent of its
value by a Danish publisher, Nansen
spent this money on founding mode]
farms in Russia. He was Norwegian de-
legate at Geneva ; and later Ambassador
in London. He died on 13 May 1930,
Robert Koch
A Prussian village doctor, Robert Koch,
studied the anthrax bacillus, following
Pasteur's methods, and was the first to
give a full account of that disease. In
1882 he announced to the Berlin Phy-
Siological Association his discovery of
the bacillus of tuberculosis, thus return-
ing to the traditional view of the
Hypocratic school on the contagious
nature of the illness Koch, who pur-
sued research untiringly, died 40 years
ago, on 27 May 1910, on his return from
a scientific expedition to the Indian
Archipelago and equatorial Africa.
The Interpretation of Dreams

Vienna, Sigmund

'Die Traumdeu-

trian professor was

ITALY REBUILDS

casualties or war
were magnificent
monuments of the
past. Some of these
were lost for ever-
the Abbey of Monte
Cassino, the Santa
Trinita bridge, the
mediaeval palaces
near the Ponte
Vecchio in Florence.
But others, less
badly damaged, are
being restored with
a competence that
does great credit to
Italian ingenuity.
Restoration work
was undertaken im-
mediately after the
war under the direc-
tion of Professor
Ranuccio Bianchi-
Bandinelli, Director
General of the Divi-
sion of Fine Arts in
the Ministry of Edu-
cation.
Everything p 0 s-
sible has been done
to save as much of
the original monu-
ments or painting as
possibly. Even small
fragments are re-
turned to the place
where they originally
belonged. Columns
too badly shattered
to hold the weight
of a roof are rein-
forced with concrete,
or with other devices
of modern architec-
ture, rather than
replaced. Paintings,
blown into torn frag-
ments, are being
restored to resemble

THE traveller in Italy to-day often finds it difficult to believe that
five years ago a devastating war wrought desolation and ruin in
its slow progress from Sicily to the Alps.
Bridges have been rebuilt ; roads cleared of wreckage ; churches
repaired ; great works of art restored ; entire villages which were levelled
by German demolition or Allied bombing have sprung up again. In a
collective effort the Italians have laboured to rebuild their country and
its art treasures.
It has been a difficult job, complicated by the fact that many of the
The competence with which partially war damaged buildings
are being restored does great credit to Italian ingenuity. At
Bolzano, for example, where the cathedral roof (above) suffered
severe damage, the architects and experts charged with its
reconstruction were faeed with the problem of building material
shortages, especially wood, when they began their work. As
the photo (right) shows, they overcame this by replacing the
ancient wooden beams with reinforced concrete.
.
No"Counterfeiting"Allowed
No attempt is made to repaint orto hide the damage or the work
of restoration. Professor Bianchi-
Bandinelli has too great a love for
antiauities to allow what he considers
counterfeiting. When a small part
of an ancient edifice has to be recon-
structed, and the new is hardly dis-
tinguishable from the original, the
date of restoration is engraved on
every new stone.
Of all Italian CitiM, Naples has done
the most, in proportion to the damage
suffered, to reorganize its great col-
lections of antiquities and art. Re-
construction has already been largely
completed on the Church of San
Martino, the Floridiana, and the
National and Pompeian Museums.
Epecially arduous has been the task
of restoring such beautiful landmarks
as the cupola of the Gerolomini, the
chapel of Sant'Anna dei Lombardi
and the crumbled columns of the
House of the Faun and the House of
Edipo Rufo in Pompei.
But by far the most difficult task
has been the repairing of the terrible
destruction wrought upon Naples'
Royal Palace, one of the most sump-
tuous in Europe. To-day the palace
is once more almost in its pre-war
condition, and the enormous salons
have again been furnished as they
were during the 122 years of foreign
occupation. The taste and mood of
the Spanish and French queens has
been recaptured and reproduced with
exquisite sensitivity.
Florence is also making good progress
in the reconstruction of its destroyed
art monuments. The blueprints for a
new bridge of Santa Trinita await
only the approval of the Ministry of
Public Works. The quarters along the
Arno demolished by the Germans be-
fore their retreat are quickly rising,
and they faithfully reproduce the ori-
ginal. The Uffizi Gallery, where many
of the Renaissance's most revered mas-
terpieces are exhibited, has been
completely repaired.
A share of the credit for this quick
revival must go to the Allied Armies,
which co-operated with the Italians
in making póssible the immediate
repair and restoration of works of art.
A great part of the preliminary work
was done through the Monuments,
Fine Arts and Archives Branch of the
During the fighC-ng in and around Florence many oj the city's finest buildings, including
the Uffizi Palace. home oj a priceless collection ot artistic treasures, were badly damaged.
Today, experts are working in the celebrated restoration1 laboratory at the Uffizi on the
delicate task 01 repairing the damage done to paintings and statues.
Allied Control Commission. This
branch, in turn, was aided by a spe-
cial committee for the protection of
works of art in war zones, oreated
under the auspices of the American
Council of Learned Societies, which
for about two ydars had prepared
lits of monuments that ran the risk
of being damaged. They were marked
with red circles on special maps dis-
tributed to Allied Airmen.
The Allied Armies were particularly
helpful to the Italians in connection
with the recovery of art treasures sto-
len by the Germans and taken out of
Italy. The Germans at first exported
only works of art"bought"from
private owners or antiquarians. But,
after the armistice between Italy and
the Allies in September 1943, they
systematically removed works belong-
ing to public collections, under the
pretence of safeguarding them.
In Italy, art restoration has been brought to
its highest level 01 skill and has become a
task 01 the most modern kind of precise
science combined with the old intuitive arti-
3unship. Work being carried out today
(above) in the UUizi Palace, Florence, is in
the hand. of men who are probably the best
scientists 01 their kind in the world.
Exodus of Art Treasures
AT the start o. she war accordingto a booklet written by the pre-
sent Minister of Education,
Guido Gonella-the art works of
Naples'National Museum and of the
Gallery (Pinacoteca) were carried,
together with other treasures of great
value belonging to churches, to three
depots far from any likely military
objective : the Abbey of Cava dei
Tirreni, the Convent of Mercogliano
and the Abbey of Monte Cassino.
In order to convert the hill of Monte
Cassino into a fortress, the Germans
later emptied that enormous store
house and moved its contents north.
The task was done by the German
Service for the Protection of Works
of Art (Kunstschutz), which never
tolerated any interference by Italians.
Before reaching the North, these
art-objects were trucked from city to
city, loaded and unloaded. Many
suffered severe damage. A part of
them was seized by paratroopers of
the Goering Division and secretly sent
to Berlin, as a tribute to their Mar-
shall. The remainder was stored at
the Palazzo Venezia, Mussolini's for-
mer residence in Rome.
Immediately after the liberation of
Rome, a check with the Neapolitan
Museums revealed the tremendous
artistic and intrinsic value of the
stolen property. The Danae of Titian
was missing, as were such master-
pieces as the Parable of the Blind
Men by Pieter Breughel, the Courtesan
Antea by Parmigianino, the Apollo
Citaredo, one of the most beautiful
statues uncovered at Pompei, together
with the rich collection of Pompeian
jewellry. Meanwhile, in Berlin, exam-
bitions and celebrations had been
organized to welcome the arrival of
Titian's Danae.
Works of Art Come Home
WHEN the mass-bombing of Ber-lin began, the stolen Italian
art treasures were sent to one
of the AIt-Aussee salt mines near
Salzburg. The order was given in
March 1945, and the transfer was
made by truck, in two stages because
of the heavy snow. The statues were
badly crated, The paintings had no
protection whatsoever. It has now
been revealed that Italian intelli-
gence officers, acting under specific
orders, secretly followed the convoy
to its destination, and subsequently
turned in a full report to their govern-
ment. This information was later
relayed to the Allied authorities.
After the occupation of Western
Austria by the American Army, the
depot was taken over by officers of
the Army's Fine Arts Service and,
later on, the works of art were trans-
ferred to Munich and housed in the
former headquarters of the Nazi
Party.
Many art treasures stolen from Flo-
rence's galleries were similarly reco-
vered. The Germans had stolen
58 crates containing statues in marble
and bronze, among them masterpieces
by Donatello and Michelangelo, plus
26 crates of Greek sculpture. They
had also carried off 291 paintings,
some of which were by Titian, Botti-
celli, Raffaello, and Murillo, together
with about 25 crates of smaller paint-
ings. These were eventually found,
reasonably intact, by Allied Forces in
north Italy and returned to their
rightful owners.
In spite of past achievements, much
remains still to be done.
Plans drawn up by the Division of
Fine Arts of Italy's Education Mi-
nistry reflect Italy's determination to
restore or repair all destructions
wrought by the war.
