The International Atomic Energy Agency
THE TAMING
OF THE... ATOM
FOR PEACE
T,
HROUGHOUT a world beset by growing problems of over¬
population, lack of food and limited traditional resources, nuclear energy
is emerging as a most powerful force for the benefit of man.
World leaders and scientists of vision realized this well over a decade
ago. Due to their foresight, the International Atomic Energy Agency of the
United Nations was founded to find ways of harnessing atoms for peace
and preventing their use for war.
4
After the World War Two bombings
of Hiroshima and Nagasaki had shown
the terrible destructiveness of atomic
power, the world was desperately
anxious to turn over the nuclear coin
and investigate its beneficial side.
However, until 1953, no acceptable
formula could be found to establish the
tool for these investigations.
Then President Eisenhower of the
United States urged the establishment
of an international organization through
which the technically developed
countries "would dedicate some of
their strength to serving the needs
rather than the fears of mankind."
This proposal marked the turning
point in the postwar evolution of
nuclear energy from its military
applications to its peaceful applications
for the benefit of everyone.
In 1954, the United Nations General
Assembly unanimously adopted an
"Atoms for Peace" resolution expres¬
sing the hope that the International
Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA) be
established without delay. In October,
1956, the Statute was approved unan
imously at a conference of 81 nations:
on July 29, 1957, the Agency officially
came into being. Today it has
98 member states.
The IAEA was conceived with two
broad aims: to actively promote the
peaceful uses of nuclear energy, and
to ensure that these applications are
carried out without risk to world peace
and to world health. These are still
vital considerations, but since the
agency's beginnings in 1957, its
scientists have widened their scope of
activities to include other related areas
affecting practically every walk of life.
By 1958, scientists were already hard
at work in their first laboratory In
Vienna; the first symposia were
organized; experts were appointed for
technical assistance; and the first
fellowships for research were awarded.
It was immediately recognized that
one of the main factors to encourage
wider use of nuclear energy is the
spreading of scientific and technical
know-how. Accordingly, the first
major enterprise was the fellowships
programme.
Fernand Léger, the famous
French painter executed
the painting shown here
(measuring a giant
8 metres by 5 metres) for
the Paris science museum,
Palais de la Découverte.
It represents man's
harnessing of energy for
peaceful purposes.
Over 3,000 fellowships have been
awarded to date. In addition, a
thousand persons have been trained
in Agency-organized courses and
120 visiting professorships provided.
Something like 15,000 scientists have
met at 100 conferences and symposia
to discuss 5,500 scientific papers.
Furthermore, nearly 200 panels,
40 study groups and 13 other meetings
were convened.
Knowledge of the properties of
stable isotopes and radioisotopes has
led to great advances in research and
technology.
Isotopes and instruments associated
with them can be turned to useful
purposes easily, often cheaply and
with relatively quick and practical re¬
sults, many of them particularly valu¬
able to developing countries. Here are
some of the ways that they are being
used by the IAEA and other organiza¬
tions with which it collaborates:
In Agriculture: Improvements of
yields through collective research
efforts to make better use of fertili¬
zers, as for rice, studied in 12 coun¬
tries, and for maize in eight countries;
production of better rice, wheat and
barley through radiation-induced muta¬
tions; control or eradication of insect
pests; protection of food against con¬
tamination; preservation of stored food
by irradiation; studies designed to
make fullest use of water In the soil;

preparation by radiation of vaccines
for animals.
In Hydrology: For six years a con¬
tinuing world survey of the content
of tritium (the radioactive isotope of
hydrogen) as well as some stable iso¬
topes has been carried out jointly with
the World Meteorological Organiza¬
tion to determine the water turn-over
on earth; more than 20 countries have
been helped to estimate their local
water development problems; studies
of 20 large rivers in various parts of
the world were carried out jointly with
Unesco as part of the programme of
the International Hydrological Decade
now in progress, with which the tri¬
tium survey is also linked.
In Medicine: Goitre research ranged
from the heights of the Andes in Peru
to those of the Himalayas in Nepal;
arrangements were made for the pro¬
vision of equipment for radiological
treatment of cancer in seven countries.
Radioisotope techniques and charts
for medical diagnosis and treatment
have been developed and standard¬
ized. The highest priority has been
given to four groups of subjects
anaemia, endemic goitre, malnutri¬
tion and the effects of parasitic infec¬
tions on human beings and re¬
search has been promoted in 44 coun¬
tries ; a training programme provides
the majority of qualified personnel
working in nuclear medicine in dev¬
eloping countries.
A programme aimed at making
snakebite serum generally available as
a result of radiation treatment of
venom has been initiated in the hope
of saving many of the 3,000 lives lost
annually. Sterilization of tissues and
hospital equipment is being developed
to facilitate surgical work and reduce
dangers of infection.
In Industry: Increasing efforts have
been made to acquaint nations with
radioisotope techniques for improving
the quality of production of manufac¬
tured goods; process, wear and tear
and flow control; sterilization of medi¬
cal products, all ways of saving hun¬
dreds of millions of dollars a year as
well as leading to more rapid indus¬
trial development.
Nuclear energy's greatest contribu¬
tion to human welfare ^will probably
be power production. At present, the
Agency acts mainly as an international
adviser. Its experts counsel individual
countries and regions on the feasibility
of their nuclear power proposals,
provide information enabling a choice
to be made, help In choosing sites,
make cost evaluations and give
guidance for safe operation.
These services are especially im¬
portant for countries whose size or
present state of development preclude
them from taking on these tasks alone.
Another, increasingly important appli¬
cation of nuclear energy is in the
large-scale desalting of sea water.
Glenn T. Seaborg, chairman of the U.S.
Atomic Energy Commission, under¬
lined its importance when he said,
"1 know of no more exciting prospect
for the future a future which I be¬
lieve is not distant than that of
nuclear reactors producing unprece¬
dented amounts of energy for the
production of electric power and the
desalting of water in some of the
earth's most arid regions."
Since 1963, the IAEA has served
as a clearing house for the interna¬
tional exchange of information on nu¬
clear desalting- as well as bringing
together technical experts and policy¬
makers from all parts of the world
during eight meetings of its Panel on
Nuclear Desalting. Now it is adding
to this work the exciting idea of link¬
ing the nuclear power/desalting oper¬
ations with chemical and fertilizer
plants to create new agro-industrial
centres.
,The Agency has also sponsored a
tripartite study into the possibility of
a huge dual-purpose nuclear power
and desalting plant to serve the arid
regions of Mexico and the United
States surrounding the Gulf of Cali¬
fornia. If it proves feasible, it might
produce as much as one thousand
million gallons of water a day.
The IAEA is acting as an observer
for a similar project between Israel
and the U.S.A., and power and desalin-

TAMING THE ATOM (Continued)

ation missions have been sent to
Chile, El Salvador, Finland, Republic
of Korea, Pakistan, Peru, the Philip¬
pines, Thailand, Tunisia and Turkey.
Apart from nuclear power and de¬
salting, the Agency is helping to ad¬
vance reactor technology through the
direct support of research on a
regional or international basis.
The IAEA's scientists recognized that
applied and basic science are indivis¬
ible and have planned their pro¬
gramme accordingly. The first pro¬
visional' laboratory, setup in 1958, dealt
with physics and some chemistry
involving low radioactivity. It is still
maintained although Its role has
changed: today it is used partly for
investigations into radiation acci¬
dentally or medically introduced into
the human body.
S

INCE 1961, a functional
laboratory has been in operation at
Seibersdorf, about 20 miles south-east
of Vienna. It has sections for nuclear
and medical physics, chemistry, agri¬
cultural research, hydrology and elec¬
tronics. Among the wide range of
subjects dealt with have been food¬
stuffs, the age and content of meteor¬
ites, and the quality of ores and
sedimentation in rivers. Furthermore,
8,000 of its radioisotope standards
serve to calibrate Instruments and
check research work in 56 countries.
Also created in 1961 was the Inter¬
national Marine Radioactivity Labora¬
tory at Monaco. It studies the effects
and dispersal of radioactivity in the
sea, its living creatures and its plants.
Its work will give guidance on the
future disposal of radioactive waste
from the growing number of nuclear
.installations, including ships.
The best example of the IAEA's
contribution to basic research is its
International Centre for Theoretical
Physics in Trieste, inaugurated in 1964
and headed by one of the world's most
brilliant physicists, Professor Abdus
Salam of Pakistan. Its main value has
been to encourage scientific thinkers,
especially from developing countries,
who previously found it difficult to
maintain contacts and standards of
work.
Over 400 special reports have been
produced; 600 physicists from 53 coun¬
tries have participated in the work;
seminars, training courses and re¬
search groups have resulted in useful
publications; scientists from dev
eloping countries are drawn to the
Centre by a system of associate
membership, fellowships, senior and
junior physicists positions, and a
scheme of affiliations with other
institutions. A symposium on contem¬
porary physics which has just ended
was one of the most important events
in theoretical physics for many years.
Nine Nobel Laureates were among
250 leading scientists of many discip¬
lines who took part.
The IAEA's basic research pro¬
gramme also promotes the effective
use of research reactors in developing
countries by providing experts to
advise on their efficient utilization.
As the value of nuclear power is
accepted by more countries, the need
for health and safety measures is
increased. The Agency has evolved
basic safety standards for radiation
protection and regulations for the safe
transport of radioactive materials.
These rules are mandatory for all
activities with which the IAEA is
connected and, although it does not
have the power to impose them on
nations, there is a growing trend to
adopt these or similar health and
safety standards.
To ensure that IAEA assistance is
not diverted for military purposes and
to apply safeguards at the request of
the parties to any bilateral or multi¬
lateral nuclear agreement, a system
of safeguards procedure has been
established which «applies to reactors
and to installations Where used nuclear
fuel is reprocessed. The system will
be extended to plants for conversion
and fabrication of nuclear fuel. It now
covers the entire fuel cycle except
isotope separation plants.
The first country to accept the safe¬
guards was Japan, which in 1959
obtained three tons of fuel through
the Agency's intermediary. Twenty-
eight other countries have since
accepted Agency safeguards, some
of which are supplied with their nuclear
materials by the Agency.
The number of installations now
subject to control is 120, including
70 reactors. Often these installations
represent the sole or major nuclear
activity in the country concerned.
Under the system, Member States
maintain records of the materials
under safeguards and report periodi¬
cally. An important element is on-site
inspections by a team of inspectors
with broad powers of access and
investigation.
ATOMIC RICE. The International
Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA) has
set up a plant mutation laboratory
at Seibersdorf, Austria, where
scientists have successfully used
radiation to produce better varieties
of rice, with higher yields, quicker
maturity and greater resistance to
disease. Seeds from many
rice-growing countries are irradiated
and grown in paddies under plastic
tents on an experimental basis.
Here, an IAEA fellowship holder,
Mr W.C. Li, from the Republic of
China, studies a new rice strain
produced by radiation.
As this team gains more experience,
it is called upon to fulfill more tasks.
The Treaty for the Prohibition of
Nuclear Weapons in Latin America,
the so-called Tlatelolco Treaty, signed
by 21 nations in 1967, nominates the
Agency to apply its safeguards to the
nuclear activities of the contracting
nations.
However, a danger remains. Nations
are still free to manufacture nuclear
weapons if they desire. And if more
countries decide to do so, the present
trend to non-proliferation could be
broken with possible disastrous
results.
The Non-Proliferation Treaty, spon¬
sored by U.S.S.R. and U.S.A. and
adopted in June 1968 by the U.N.
General Assembly with a very con¬
siderable majority, opens more opti¬
mistic perspectives for ensuring
greater safety for the world. Non-
nuclear weapons states, which are
parties to the treaty, accept not to
produce atomic bombs. It is foreseen
that the IAEA will carry out the inter¬
national control, ensuring that the
treaty is followed.
The treaty was signed by the U.S.,
Soviet Union and U.K. (three of the

NUCLEAR THIRST QUENCHER. The desalting of seawater by nuclear
energy holds out untold promise for the world's agriculture of tomorrow.
Deserts reach down to the sea along some 18,000 miles of the world's
coastlines. Installation of water desalting nuclear plants would transform
thousands of acres of parched soil and permit the setting up of
agro-industrial complexes. Cheap electricity from nuclear power plants
could also make inland deserts, bloom with water pumped from deep
underground natural reserves. The critical problems of certain arid areas,
where no rain may fall from one year to the next, are underlined by the
fact that 37 gallons of water are needed to make one slice of bread and
3,750 gallons to produce one pound of beef.
world's five nuclear powers) and
53 other nations in Washington, Mos¬
cow and London on July 1, 1968, and
other signatures brought the total to
64 by July 4. A total of 40 nations plus
the three signatory nuclear nations
must ratify the treaty before it be¬
comes international law.
An essential aspect of the IAEA's
approach to both its task and its
success to date is international co¬
operation. We have already indicated
projects involving different countries.
There are others.
One, the NPY agreement with
Norway, Poland and Yugoslavia, is
aimed at improving knowledge of
reactor physics, using experimental
facilities in all three countries. Another
joint programme of research in reactor
physics uses the NORA reactor in
Norway. It has provided useful data
for the development of power reactors
and has given experience to scientists
from many nations.
In South-East Asia, a regional train¬
ing and research programme, using
a neutron crystal spectrometer, was
established In 1965 at the Philippine
Atomic Research Centre, Quezon City,
administered by the Philippines, India
and the IAEA. India built the spectro¬
meter and provided scientists and
technicians. Indonesia, Korea, Repub¬
lic of China and, of course, the Philip¬
pines, whose research reactor is also
used, have been taking part.
The Middle Eastern Regional Radio¬
isotope Centre for the Arab countries,
set up under Agency auspices in
Cairo in 1963, trains specialists for
work and research. Participants come
from Algeria, Iraq, Jordan, Kuwait,
Lebanon, Libya, Morocco, Saudi
Arabia, Sudan, Syrian Arab Republic,
Tunisia, United Arab Republic and
Yeman, and have included trainees
from Nigeria and Ghana.
T HE IAEA also co-operates
with the United Nations and some of
its specialized agencies such as the
Food and Agricultural Organization,
the World Health Organization, Unesco,
the World Meteorological Organization,
the International Labour Organization,
and the United Nations Development
Programme (UNDP).
In fact, the Agency was the exe¬
cuting body of some of these joint
IAEA-UNDP projects. One of these
showed the value of nuclear power in
the Philippines; in India the use of
atomic energy will be intensified to
increase agricultural production; in
Central America, the campaign against
the Mediterranean fruit-fly is being
carried out, and in Yugoslavia, valuable
work to assist agriculture and animal
husbandry has been accomplished.
In all its work, the Agency has
taken as guiding principle the urgent
need to help improve standards of
living in developing countries. A
review made in 1967 showed that
30 per cent of the money spent goes
directly to projects for this purpose,
and that a large proportion of the
remainder is spent on activities of
interest to such nations. As techniques
develop, the trend is to concentrate
increasingly on practical rather than
advisory tasks.
These widespread and diverse activ¬
ities, in co-operation with nations and
organizations throughout the world,
illustrate how the International Atomic
Energy Agency, born out of a reali¬
zation that the promise and problems
of the peaceful uses of nuclear energy
recognize no national boundaries, has
moved steadily towards the great objec¬
tives for which it came into existence.

CHARTING THE
NUCLEAR LABYRINTH
A basic survey of the atom
and its peaceful uses
by I. H. Usmani
N.
8
I EVER in the annals of history has a scientific discovery so
profoundly affected the course of human destiny as the discovery of atomic
energy. Its potential for destruction is enormous and its use for econo¬
mic development unlimited. It is this co-existence of fear of annihilation
and hope for the progress of human welfare through its application that
has ushered us into the present era rightly known as the "Atomic Age."
Let us see what an atom is and
how it becomes such an enormous
source of energy and a tool to solve
problems of development in the fields
of industry, agriculture and medicine.
All the tangible things that we see
around us, whether in the form of
solids (like paper, pen or pencil),
liquids (like water), or gases (like
air), are all combinations of certain
basic materials or substances called
"Elements" of which only 92 are found
in nature: copper, iron, gold, uranium,
hydrogen and oxygen, etc.
Each of these elements has certain
specific physical and chemical proper¬
ties or characteristics by which it is
identified. The last indivisible particle
of an element is called the "Atom."
Thus, we have an atom of Iron, an
atom of gold and an atom of hydrogen,
each having characteristics typically its
own.
If these elements are arranged in
order of their weights in a tabular
form, Hydrogen, being the lightest,
occupies position number one and
Uranium, being the heaviest, occupies
position no. 92. All others fall In
between these positions.
DR. I. H. USMANI of Pakistan, one of
Asia's foremost nuclear physicists, is
Chairman of the Pakistan Atomic Energy
Agency. He was responsible for estab¬
lishing the Pakistan Institute of Nuclear
Science, the Atomic Energy Centres of
Lahore and Dacca, an Atomic Energy
Agricultural Research Centre in Tandojam
and five Atomic Energy Medical Centres
in Pakistan. He commissioned and super¬
vised Pakistan's first atomic reactor in
1965 and was responsible for launching
Pakistan's first space rocket in 1962.
Atomic Structure
To give an idea of the size and
weight of an atom of hydrogen,
nearly 36 billion atoms can be accom¬
modated on a pin-head and one million
million atoms weigh only one millionth
part of a millionth of a gramme!
All atoms have internal structures
which are built out of a combination
of only three fundamental "bricks"
called the "Electron," the "Proton,"
and the "Neutron." The last two have
more or less the same weight and size
but the electron Is about 1,800 times
lighter in weight. Further, the electron
Is electrically negative, carrying the
smallest possible electric charge, while
the proton carries a positive charge
equal to the negative charge of the
electron. The neutron carries no
charge and is electrically neutral,
hence its name.
Finally, the structures of all atoms
are built in such a way that in the
centre there is an inner core or a
"Nucleus" which consists of protons
and neutrons held together by a very
strong binding nuclear force. Around

Paradoxically, the deeper the nuclear scientist probes the infinitely tiny structure of
sub-atomic matter, the larger and more powerful are the tools he needs, notably
giant particle accelerators such as the cosmotron and synchrotron. Shot at fantastic
speeds from these machines, atomic particles pass into a "sorting" apparatus, such as
the particle separator shown above, and are then detected visually and studied by physicists.

the nucleus, the electrons revolve In
orbits just as the planets revolve
around the sun in our solar system.
Isotopes
Based on the above theory of atomic
structure, it has been found that it Is
the number of protons in the nucleus
(and, therefore, the number of elec¬
trons in the orbits) that determine the
chemical properties of an element.
The presence or addition of neutrons
in the body of the nucleus does not
cause any change in these properties.
Thus, it Is possible to have two
atoms of the same element having the
same number of protons in the nucleus
but a different number of neutrons.
Both will have identical chemical pro¬
perties but the nucleus of one will be
heavier than the other. These are
known as two "Isotopes" of the same
element ("Iso" in Greek means "same"
and "tope" means "place"). Thus, all
elements have isotopes which are
chemically indistinguishable from one
another but which are physically
different in weight because of the pre¬
sence of a different number of
neutrons in their nuclei.
Radioactivity
Building up the structures of atomic
nuclei by adding protons and neutrons,
as we go along from hydrogen, the
lightest, to uranium, the heaviest, we
find that a stage comes when the
piling of protons and neutrons causes
instability and the nucleus begins to
disintegrate by emitting the extra pro¬
tons and neutrons or combinations
thereof. This emission of radiations in
the form of particles or rays is known
as "Radioactivity."
When the unstable nuclei of radio¬
active elements disintegrate, they emit
three kinds of "radiations" called
"Alpha" particles, "Beta" particles and
"Gamma" rays. The alpha particles
are nothing but a combination of two
protons and two neutrons (helium
nucleus without the orbiting electrons)
carrying a positive charge due to the
two protons. The beta particles are
just negatively charged electrons
moving at high velocities and gamma
rays are deep penetrating radiations.
All the disintegrating nuclei "decay"
till such time as they revert to the most
stable nuclear structure. Time taken to
decay to half the original number of
atoms of a given kind is referred to by
the scientists as the "Half Life" of a
radioactive atom or "Radioisotope" for
short.
Transmutation of Elements
According to the theory of atomic
structure outlined above, If one ele¬
ment differs from another element by
just the number of protons and neu¬
trons in the body of the nucleus, it
follows that if somehow these numbers

could be changed by adding or remov¬
ing protons and neutrons to or from
the nucleus of an element, it could
be changed into another element. That
this is possible was first demonstrated
by Lord Rutherford in 1919.
Fission
The German scientists Otto Hahn
and Fritz Strassmann in 1938 found
that, when slow neutrons hit the
nucleus of the radioisotope uranium-
235, the nucleus fissioned into two
almost equal halves and there was a
tremendous burst of energy! How was
this to be explained?
As early as 1905, Einstein had prov¬
ed that matter and energy are inter¬
convertible and that if somehow matter
could be destroyed, it would appear in
the form of energy and this intercon-
vertibility would be governed by a very
simple equation E =Mc2 where E is
the energy liberated, M is the mass
converted and c is the constant velo¬
city of light which is 186,000 miles or
300,000 kilometres per second.
Einstein's equation satisfactorily
explained the phenomenon of fission
observed in the experiments of Hahn
and Strassmann. This led to calcula¬
tions which showed that if one pound
of uranium-235 could be fissioned it
would liberate as much energy
1,400 tons of high grade coal.
as
Reactors
The fission of every atom of uran¬
ium-235 results in the liberation
of energy as well as the release
of two to three secondary neutrons
from the disintegrating nucleus. These
neutrons if slowed down by a
erator," like graphite or water, could
get absorbed by another atom of
uranium-235 present in a piece of
uranium and cause another fission
which in turn would release energy and
two to three more neutrons and so on.
Thus, a chain reaction can be set up

and liberation of energy can be con¬
trolled by adjusting the absorption of
secondary neutrons by inserting some
material like boron or cadmium. A
contrivance sustaining a controlled
chain reaction is called a "Reactor".
Nuclear Power
Liberation of atomic energy once
controlled in a reactor can be used to
heat water which can produce steam
which in turn can drive a turbine to
generate electricity for supply to a
town. Thus, a nuclear power reactor
can replace a coal, oil or gas-fired
bojler of a conventional thermal power
plant.
The scale of energy produced from
the conventional' fuels and uranium is,
however, vastly different. The burning
of one pound of coal generates
3.5 units (Kwh) and one pound of oil
5.5 units (Kwh) of energy, the fission¬
ing of one pound of uranium liberates
10.5 million units (Kwh) of energy!
It is this enormous difference in the
output of energy that has propelled
the development of modern nuclear
power reactors to a degree that has
made them the cheapest source of
power generation.
Today, It Is possible to generate a
million KW (1000 MW) from a single
nuclear reactor producing power at
only about one quarter of a cent (US)
per unit (Kwh). Such a cheap and
Photo © APN
abundant supply of electric power has
made conversion of sea water into
fresh water on a large scale for
domestic and industrial purposes a
distinct economic possibility. In future,
it might be possible to establish big
energy centres on sea coasts with
agro-industrial complexes producing
power, water and fertilizers (from sea
salts), thus creating a thudding impact
on economic development.
In countries where the resources of
fossil fuels (coal, oil and gas) are
limited and where power is needed, not
at a "competitive cost" but at "any
cost," to accelerate the pace of eco¬
nomic development, as in countries of
Asia, Africa, and Latin America,
nuclear power is a boon.

Even in highly industrialized coun¬
tries of Europe, in the U.S.S.R., Canada
and U.S.A. where cheap and abun¬
dant supply of coal is available, nuclear
power stations are replacing the con¬
ventional thermal stations because the
uranium1 fuel is so compact that a
comparatively small quantity can easily
be transported to feed a big nuclear
power station in the heart of the load
centre resulting in saving on transport
of fuel and long distance power trans¬
mission lines (see article page 17).
Breeder Reactors
Natural uranium contains 99-3 per
cent of the isotope uranium-238 and
0.7 per cent of the isotope uranium-235.
When a slow neutron hits atoms of
uranium-235 in a reactor, fission take-*
place and we get energy which is con¬
verted into electric power. But when
the neutrons hit the nucleus of uran¬
ium-238, which is present in the
reactor fuel in abundance, transmuta¬
tion takes place converting uranium-
238 into a new element, neptunium,
which, after the emission of a beta-
particle, decays into a very long-lived
element called plutonium, having an
atomic weight of 239 and atomic
number 94.
Like uranium-235, plutonium-239 is
fissionable. In other words, while
uranium-235 fissions and gets con¬
sumed, the uranium-238 breeds into
plutonium-239 which on recovery
from the spent-fuel as a byproduct,
can either be recycled back into the
reactor or used as fuel in fast "Breeder
Reactors", using fast neutrons without
a moderator. It is hoped that the
technology of such reactors will be
perfected within the next 10-15 years
which would bring a power revolution
in its wake.
Production of Radioisotopes
Because a reactor is a big source
of neutrons released from the fission
of uranium, it is employed to produce
a large number of radioisotopes of
different elements either by the trans¬
mutation or the activation process.
For example, if sulphur is inserted in
the reactor, the neutrons convert it
into radioactive phosphorus with a half
life of 14.5 days and if tellurium is
inserted, it gets converted into radio¬
active iodine with a half life of 8 days.
Similarly, ordinary cobalt, when hit
by neutrons, is activated into radio¬
active cobalt with a half life of nearly
5 years. These "artificially" produced
radioisotopes have been used in a
variety cf ways to solve problems in
the fields of agriculture, hydrology,
medicine and industry. In fact, the
limit to which they can be used, is the
limit of man's imagination and genius.
Uses of Radioisotopes
as Tracers
The principle underlying the use of
radioisotopes is that the radiations
emitted by them can be detected by
sensitive electronic instruments and
can also be recorded on a photogra¬
phic plate, co that even where they are
present in' minute quantities of say
one In a million, they can be "traced."
Agriculture. One of the important
applications of tracer technique in the
field of agriculture is the determination
of the uptake of fertilizers by a plant
from the soil. Labelled phosphate fer¬
tilizer is mixed in the soil and the
uptake by the plant from different
types of soil is studied from the radio¬
graphs. Similarly, if "labelled" fertili¬
zers are applied at different stages of
the growth of a rice or wheat plant
(seedling stage, flowering stage, etc.),
the radiographs can help to determine
the right stage when the fertilizer
should be applied for maximum yields.
Medicine. Certain organs of the
body have great affinity for specific
elements which are absorbed from' the
intake of foods, For example, iodine is
absorbed entirely by the thyroid gland,
iron plays a vital role in the blood¬
stream and cobalt helps the synthesis
of vitamin B in the liver.
Thus, when radioiodine dissolved in
water is administered to a patient and
a "scanner" is placed against his
throat, the emission of electrons from
radioiodine are recorded on the pho¬
tographic paper in the scanner giving
an idea of the functioning of the
thyroid gland.
Labelled pharmaceuticals and radio-
medicines are being increasingly used
in the diagnosis and treatment of
diseases, so much so that nearly
80 per cent of the total production of
isotopes and their uses today, is in
the field of medicine and public health.
Hydrology. The injection of radio¬
isotopes which can mix with water, like
bromine, iodine and tritium, has helped
to "trace" the movement of sub-soil
streams and to discover underground
reservoirs of water for pump irrigation.
Similarly, the directional flow and
volume of seepage water from the
beds of irrigation canals can help in
the study of the problems of water
balance in the waterlogged areas.
One very successful application of
tracers has been in the use of labelled
sea-sand, to determine the movement
of silt in harbours. Such studies
carried out have not only helped in
the dredging of the silt but in dumping
it at an appropriate spot so that it is
not brought back into the harbours by
the undercurrents. The London Port
Authority seems to have cut down its
dredging budget by at least 50 per cent
as a result of the studies carried out
with the help of labelled sand.
Uses of Radioisotopes as
Radiation Sources
Although the application of radio¬
isotopes as tracers is important, their
use as sources of radiations Is equally
significant. The radiations most
widely used are the gamma rays from
radioactive-cobalt activated in a
reactor. These are such deep
penetrating rays that they have been
put to a variety of uses in the fields
mentioned below:
New Varieties of Crops. When
seeds of rice, wheat, maize, sugar¬
cane, tobacco, cotton, jute or, for that
matter, flowers are exposed to a
measured dose of gamma rays, they
undergo profound genetic changes
with the result that, on sowing, the
irradiated seeds give a variety of
plants, some of which are high yielding
and pest resistant.
Sterile male technique. There are
some insects and pests which mate
only once in life. The males of such
pests can be reared in the laboratory
on a mass scale and sterilized by a
dose of gamma rays. When such
sterilized males are released in the
pest infested area, they mate with
their females and die. Because of
sterility, no new generation is born
and after some time the females also
die resulting in the ultimate wiping
out of the pest. The eradication of
the screwworm attacking the cattle in
the United States, is one of the success
stories of the sterile male technique
which is being applied in the case of
fruit flies and other pests in many parts
of the world (see article page 18).
Disinfestation of stored foodgrains.
Gamma rays have also been used to
destroy insects and pests which infest
stored foodgrains. Experiments in
many countries have shown that the
irradiated wheat and rice do not
undergo any significant change in
taste or nutritional properties provided

MINING URANIUM FROM THE SEA. Man is not likely to run short of uranium for nuclear
power installations. The sea around him is virtually a limitless reservoir of uranium in
solution. The Norwegian Current, which flows past the north of the British Isles and along
the coast of Norway towards the Arctic Ocean, for instance, carries with it about 250,000 tons
of uranium par annum. Over a million tons of uranium pass through the Florida Straits and
the Japan Strait each year. For the past ten years scientists in Britain have experimented
with different ways of extracting the low concentration (3.3 microgrammes per litre) of
uranium in sea water, though these methods are still economically unattractive. One absorbent
substance they have used is hydrated titanium oxide which takes up uranium and can then
be treated to give solutions, in which the uranium concentration is increased ten thousandfold.
It gives good results» when prepared in the granular form being examined here by a scientist.
the dose of gamma rays is controlled.
Gamma-rays do not induce any radio¬
activity so that irradiated grains are
totally harmless.
Food Preservation. Fresh fruits,
fish, poultry, meat and vegetables
decay either on shelves or in cold
storage after some time. Experiments
have shown that sprouting in potatoes
and onions is inhibited by exposure to
gamma rays and that certain varieties
of oranges, strawberries etc. stay
fresh after a light dose of these rays.
The shelf life of fresh fish is extended
by several days when treated with
gamma rays and poultry and bacon
remain preserved when exposed
to radioactive cobalt. The results
obtained in this field are so promising
that in the next few years irradiated
preserved foods will be a common
sight in the world markets.
Cobalt Therapy. Nearly every
modern hospital has what is known
as a cobalt-therapy unit. It has a
pellet of radioactive cobalt embedded
in a shielded chamber which wjien
opened gives out an intense beam of
gamma rays. These are used to
destroy malignant growth of tumours
and cancerous tissues. This has
helped many patients not only to live
longer but to get completely cured.
Sterilization of Medical Supplies.
The lethal power of gamma rays is
also employed in the sterilization of a
variety of medical supplies, such as
syringes, needles, blades, sutures and
hospital linen. In advanced countries,
gamma-ray sterilized hypodermic
syringes are standard items used for
only one Injection so that there may
not be any cross infection if used a
second time on another patient.
Radiography. Because of the very
penetrating power of the gamma rays,
they have been used to detect the
faults in the castings of thick steel
plates, forgings, welded joints, pistons
and pipelines, etc. At one end of the
defective specimen is placed a cobalt
source and at the opposite end a
photographic film or a plate. The
image showing the voids and
defects is registered by the gamma
rays passing through the specimen.
Industrial radiography is now a well-
established technique which has
helped to improve the quality of
manufactured products and detection
of faults in hundreds of metallic items.
Grafting on Wood & Fibre. Under
the influence of gamma rays, grafting
of certain chemicals (polymers) has
been successfully accomplished on
fibres and wood which gives them new
properties. Many varieties of soft
wood become hard, adding to their
usefulness. Similarly, fibre and tex-

tiles treated with certain chemicals
under the influence of radiation may
help to produce new materials.
Chemical Compounds. Gamma rays
have been found to have a catalytic
effect on certain chemical processes
and have also helped to form new
chemical compounds (which would
not otherwise form under ordinary
conditions of chemical reactions). The
usefulness of this effect to the chemi¬
cal industry ¡s, therefore, invaluable.
Thickness and Density Gauges.
Radioactive sources emitting beta-
particles (electrons) are used as
thickness gauges to ensure uniform
density of products like paper. The
rollers are pre-set to pass through a
certain thickness of paper which is
rolled off the production line. The
electrons passing through the desired
thickness of paper are detected by a
counter which in turn controls the
setting of the rollers. As soon as
thicker paper passes over the rollers,
more electrons from the radioactive
source are stopped and there is less
detection by the counter which brings
the rollers closer till the pre-set value
is reached.
Thus, defects in thickness of
industrial products like paper, can be
detected and quality control exercised.
Similarly, density of packing of tobacco
in cigarettes is detectable with the
help of such gauges.
Carbon Dating. Old archeological
fossils and bones contain organic
matter and all organic matter contains
carbon. All natural carbon has a
very minute percentage of the radio¬
active isotope carbon-14 which has a
half-life of about 5,700 years. Thus,
if archeological specimens containing
organic matter such as bones, etc. are
placed before highly sensitive elec¬
tronic detectors, the faint emission of
radiations from radioactive carbon can
be registered and counted. As radio¬
active carbon must have decayed over
the period of antiquity, the intensity of
emission can determine the age of the
carbon and thus "date" the archeolo¬
gical specimen (see article page 22).
The scientist has learnt to tame the
atom in the service of man and his
quest to discover new horizons will
continue as an integral part of the
making of the scientist; but scientists
do not rule the world. It ¡s the
statesmen and politicians who hold the
key to two doors; one leading to
peace, progress and prosperity and
the other to total destruction and anni¬
hilation. Let us pray that sanity will
prevail and the key shall never be
turned to open the second door.

The nuclear arsenals of the great

present an explosive power equal to
about one hundred thousand million
tons of T.N.T., that Is thirty tons per
head of the world population. This
tremendous destructive force, stock¬
piled in the form of atomic weapons,

using "tactical" nuclear weapons in all
the local conflicts in which they have
become involved.
As nuclear energy has brought a
new dimension to the term "explosion",
man has begun to think in terms of
hitherto impossible things he can now
do with explosions. Using the wealth
of scientific and technological nuclear
data already acquired, he has begun
to develop a nuclear explosion tech¬
nology for peaceful uses.
In addition to the economic reasons
for this endeavour, there are psycho¬
logical and even political ones. Those
who had developed the technology of
nuclear explosives for military purposes
were anxious to demonstrate that it
could also be applied for the benefit
of mankind. Used constructively, it
could increase prosperity and thereby
help to ward off the danger of a
nuclear holocaust. "Plowshare", the
name given to the best-known Amer¬
ican programme for the peaceful uses
of nuclear explosives,
this attitude.
clearly reflects
The advantages of nuclear explosives
over the conventional chemical types
of explosives are their compactness
and low cost. Their disadvantage is
the possibility of radioactive contam¬
ination. ' So obviously, atomic explos¬
ives should be used only in relatively
uninhabited areas and when truly
massive blasts are necessary: for
instance in building new ports in
northern Alaska and western Australia,
for the construction of a sea-water
canal in Libya, or for tapping gas
deposits in New Mexico; but they
could hardly be used in Europe or in
other densely populated regions,
except with the greatest caution.
The U.S.S.R. was the first country
to officially announce its research
programme into the peaceful appli¬
cations of nuclear explosives. In 1949,

Nations, Mr. Andrei Vishinsky de-

NUCLEAR EXPLOSIVES (Continued)
Operation 'Dragon Tail'
to exploit natural gas
dared: "The Soviet Union is today
using atomic energy for peaceful and
not for military purposes. We are
utilizing this energy for the benefit
of our economy. We are levelling
mountains, irrigating deserts, opening
ways through our forests and tundra.
We are bringing life, prosperity and
well-being to regions which had been
uninhabited for thousands of years."
The first comprehensive study of
the utilization of nuclear explosives
for excavations was published in 1956
by Soviet technicians.
In 1957, the United States launched
a programme of systematic research
into all the possibilities of the
application of nuclear explosions, on
the surface of the earth as well as
underground. This was the beginning
of the "Plowshare Programme."
Part of this programme was devoted
to investigating the possibility of large-
scale excavations with nuclear explo¬
sives. Ways of reducing, as much as
possible, the amount of radioactivity
released by these explosives were
examined, and the techniques of
nuclear excavation were studied:
placing of charges, depth of explo¬
sions, etc. The possibility of exploding
nuclear devices at a depth great
enough for the exploitation of minerals
was also examined.
The results of these experiments,
encouraging from a technical stand¬
point, have nevertheless confirmed
the serious risk of radioactivity.
Among the various possibilities of
using nuclear explosives in civil
engineering excavation of canals or
artificial harbours, opening of mountain
tunnels for roads or railways etc. the
one that is being most seriously
considered is the excavation of a
second Panama Canal. It is expected
that by 1970 the existing canal will
no longer be able to cope with all its
potential traffic, and even now certain
ships, such as mammoth oil-tankers,
are too big to pass through it.
V
16
ARIOUS projects have al¬
ready been put forward for the renova¬
tion of the existing canal. One project
provides for widening it without any
change in its height above sea-level,
but the number of locks would be
reduced. This project would cost
$1,000,000,000.
Another project envisages the
construction of a second canal at
sea-level. This raises the problem of
whether chemical or nuclear explosives
should be used for the excavations.
Using conventional excavation tech¬
niques, the construction at sea-level
of a second canal in the vicinity of
the existing one would cost about
$2,000,000,000 (taking into account the
need for keeping the existing canal in
operation while the new one is being
built). As the new canal would pass
through densely populated areas, there
could be no question of using nuclear
explosives.
A route particularly suitable for the
use of nuclear explosives engineering
exists in a sparsely populated area
about 160 kilometres to the east of
the present Panama Canal. This
route would be about 160 km. long
(the existing canal is 80 km1, long) and
it would pass through a chain of
mountains, some of which rise more
than a thousand feet above sea-level.
According to approximate es¬
timates, about three hundred charges
of nuclear explosives the equivalent
of about 200 million tons of T.N.T.
would be required. The total cost of
the excavation would be approximately
$1,000,000,000. Radioactive waste
from the nuclear explosion would
contaminate a vast area, so that some
25,000 people would have to leave
and settle elsewhere for a few years.
N
UCLEAR explosions con¬
tained underground offer the un¬
doubted advantage of not producing
any radioactive fall-out, and so can
be permitted in places relatively close
to inhabited areas. However, even
these explosions will need to be
confined at least pending further
studies to uninhabited areas, since
they may cause seismic shocks in the
vicinity.
Underground explosions are advan¬
tageous from the commercial stand¬
point, for they enable enormous
quantities of rock to be broken up at
little cost. This would make possible
the cheap exploitation of a low mineral
and natural gas content which it
would be uneconomic to develop with
conventional techniques.
These explosions should take place
at a depth of from 600 to 1,000 metres.
The final result is a cylindrical
funnel with a diameter of about one
hundred metres and a height of a few
hundred metres, filled with shattered
rock.
The volume of the cavity is roughly
proportionate to the force of the
explosion. Around the cavity, huge
clefts extend through the surrounding
rock. If rocks containing natural
gases are blasted, the gases will flow
through the fissures in the central
cavity where they can be contained
and brought to the surface by
conventional methods. The cavity can
also serve as a reservoir for the gas.
If copper-bearing rocks are blasted,
it will be possible to carry out a
lixiviation process on the spot by
circulating a liquid through the crushed
rocks filling the cavity and then
pumping it to the surface.
In the United States, numerous
projects are under study for the
exploitation of natural gas by using
nuclear explosives: Project Gasbuggy,
Project Dragon Tail and Project Ruli-
son. In addition, the Australian Atomic
Energy Commission has expressed in¬
terest in the exploitation, by nuclear
explosions, of its mineral and natural
gas deposits, in co-operation with the
United States.
The Gasbuggy Project in the U.S.A.
is already well advanced; the first
subterranean explosion was detonated
under the Leandro Canyon (New
Mexico) in December, 1967. No
radioactive fallout was detected im¬
mediately after the explosion, and
underground control apparatus has
revealed that the rock funnel that was
formed corresponds almost exactly to
the size and shape that scientists had
predicted. But ¡t will be eight months
(the time needed for short-lived radio¬
active products to decay) before
samples of the gas can be taken so as
to determine its level of radioactivity
and whether gas from the "well" will
flow freely and on a commercially
viable scale.
A,
NOTHER aspect of the
U.S. Plowshare Programme is the
Ketch Project whose purpose is to
investigate the use of nuclear explo¬
sions to create subterranean reservoirs
where natural gas could be stored.
Usually, natural gas is an economic
source of energy only in the region
where gas deposits are found, because
of the high cost of storage. However,
if large underground reservoirs could
be built to stockpile gas in regions
distant from its source, the gas could
be conveyed to these places and
stored.
There are densely populated areas
in the United States without any
natural subterranean areas for stock¬
piling. Project Ketch's first exper¬
iment will probably take place in
the Spraul Forest (Pennsylvania). The
state has authorized the experiment
only after obtaining satisfactory
assurances with regard to the security
of the population of the region.
To sum up, it can be said that
projects for the peaceful uses of
nuclear explosives are undoubtedly
worth-while, notably because of the
relatively low cost of such explosives
in relation to the tremendous quantities
of energy they produce.

uses of atomic energy, arranged by
the United Nations in 1955 and 1958.
These early stations demonstrated
both the feasibility and the safety of
obtaining power from the atom.
A tremendous amount of work has
been going on since that time to
improve the methods and the econo¬
mics of nuclear power production.
Within the last three years the
breakthrough has come and it is now
clear that nuclear power, when used
on a large scale, will be cheaper than
the coal, oil and gas-fired station to
which we have been accustomed in
the past.
Because of the breakthrough there
has been a remarkable surge in the
use of nuclear power. This year will

power stations in 16 countries (1) and
their generating power will be more
than 14,000 megawatts a megawatt

in four years' time just over twice as
many reactors will be producing nearly
five times as much power.
Forecasts for the future are being
continually revised upwards and at the
moment it is expected that by 1980 the
quantity of power being produced will
reach 350,000 megawatts, enough to
run 50,000 large factories or satisfy
the needs of more than 100 cities the
size of Paris or to run 350 million
single bar electric heaters, all burning
at once. They could also, if not under
some control, make enough plutonium
to make about twenty bombs a day.
But the plutonium is much more
valuable as a power producer itself.
All this is happening for two
principal reasons. One is that power
produced in this way is rapidly becom¬
ing cheaper, a trend that will continue
with advances in knowledge and tech¬
nology, and with the continuous growth
in demand for power. The other is
that the elaborate attention to safety
is satisfying the stringent demands
made by governing authorities, and that
operating experience -as well as the
efforts made by these authorities have
done much to reassure the public.

station is very similar to any other
power station. Heat produces steam,
which runs generating equipment,
from which electricity .is passed
through cables. In many conventional
stations the heat is created by burning
coal, oil or gas-, in others energy comes
from fast-running water. In nuclear
stations the energy gained from
splitting atoms of uranium, or in some
cases plutonium, is released as heat.
When the splitting, or fission, occurs,
it also happens that new elements,
some highly radioactive, are created
in the core of the atomic furnace.
If not contained safely, this radio¬
activity could cause great harm, but
fortunately the ways of controlling it
are well known just as well known
as ways of controlling the fires in con¬
ventional furnaces. Nevertheless the
scientists and engineers have not only
readily accepted all conditions impos¬
ed on them, but in all matters where
radiation is concerned have themselves
set much greater restrictions.
Here are some examples of the
meticulous way in which the interests
of the population are considered.
When the discharge of radioactive
wastes into the sea from the Wind-
scale Works in the U.K., was being
considered, it was discovered that a
food product known as "laver bread"
was made from a type of seaweed
harvested in the region. Laver bread
is eaten by a relatively small group
of people living 200 miles away, but
since the seaweed tends to absorb
radioactive ruthenium, the amount of
radioactivity in the discharge had to
be set low enough not to affect those
consumers.
When determining permitted dis¬
charges from the Bradwell nuclear
power plant, also in the U.K., it was
the fact that oysters might absorb
radioactive zinc that influenced the
decisions.
Even more selective was the result
of an investigation when a pipeline
was being prepared to take waste into
the sea from the Winfrith Atomic
Energy Establishment on the south
coast of England. It was learned that
one fisherman on the coast consumed
an average of four ounces of lobster
meat a day, roughly four times the
average in the whole country for all
sea food. When this was discovered
the pipeline was extended at con¬
siderable expense to a point further
out to sea beyond the area of the
lobster beds.
At the Hanford plant in the U.S.A.,
a survey revealed that some local
inhabitants who fished extensively in
the river there, were in the habit of
eating bones as well as flesh of the
fish. Fish tend to absorb radio¬
active phosphorus in their bones, and
since some of this material was includ¬
ed in the low-level discharges of waste,
it was considered necessary not only
to reduce the rate of discharge of this
element but to re-design the effluent
treatment plant.
The examples given above were all
due to the care taken in seeing that
harmful amounts of radioactivity are
prevented from contaminating food.
That is only one of the factors that are
always considered in designing any
type of reactor, in deciding where it
will be built and in operating it. Many
"ologies" have to be called in
meteorology, seismology, geology, bio¬
logy, entomology among them all
over and above the many sciences
concerned with the nuclear and
engineering details of reactors.
Whether it is a power station, a
research reactor or a laboratory, great
care is always taken to remind those
who work there that radiation can be
dangerous. Terms like "maximum
credible accident" are used in discus¬
sing reactors long before they "go
critical", or reach the stage at which
a chain reaction is sustained. Radiation
exposure is in terms of "maximum
permissible dose" and alarm signals
have words like "scram", which has
been interpreted as "run like hell".
To the outsider terms like these
must seem alarming, but what does
the record show? No reactor accident
has yet occurred in a power station
causing any ¡II effects to the public.
There have been a few accidents in.
handling materials and in reactors at
other plants, which have affected a
very few workers, but altogether the
safety record has been better than
nearly all other major industries.
Because of the unremitting study
which has been made, we know far
more about the effects of radiation
than we do about many of the more
common risks run every day, risks
which claim human lives. We are
still appallingly ignorant, for example,
of the dangers arising from pollution
by motorcar exhausts or from other
forms of industrial pollution in the
atmosphere.
In fact, nuclear power plants will
help considerably to relieve the prob¬
lem of air pollution because what
little escapes from them is carefully
filtered and even then only released
at heights which ensure that radio¬
activity is practically unmeasurable by
the time it reaches ground level.
Strangely enough, coal-burning plants
release more biologically significant
radioactivity to the atmosphere than
nuclear power plants.
One of the problems that will grow
with the industry Is how to dispose of
radioactive wastes. The greater
proportion of these are comparatively
easy to handle since they do not
contain "dangerous quantities of radio¬
activity. But there is a very small
percentage which is highly radioactive
and the quantities will of course grow.

methods of growth and storage, breed¬
ing varieties of plants which are resis¬
tant, encouraging populations of bene¬
ficial insects that kill pests, and making
scientific use of diseases that also
kill them.
In most cases, the first line of
defence is the use of insecticides and
this will continue to be so for many
years. Unfortunately, they have
several disadvantages; they kill many
beneficial insects, they raise problems
of potentially hazardous residues in
crops, meat or milk, and eventually
some insect strains become them¬
selves able to resist their effects.
With techniques which have been
developed from atomic energy, control
methods are emerging which are more
precise in their application and seem
to eliminate the disadvantages.
Essentially, atomic energy can be used
in two basic ways in the fight. One
of these is to take advantage of
the effects of radiation in direct
attack. The other is to utilize the
radiation from the radioactive atoms of
elements radioisotopes for marking
insects and materials, thereby gaining
information of their habits, life-cycle,
the structure of their bodies, their food,
the effects on them of radiation and
chemicals, and all the other factors
necessary for planning effective cam¬
paigns.
The International Atomic Energy
Agency (IAEA) and the Food and
Agriculture Organization (FAO) are
actively collaborating to explore and
develop all the highly varied nuclear
methods now available both for waging
the war and for obtaining the intelli¬
gence essential for the "field troops".
They are supported by entomologists
and scientists of many countries and
by other international, regional and
national organizations.
The use of radiation to affect
insects is emerging as a successful
way of control for a number of them.
It has been found that some, when
exposed to the proper amount and
type of radiation at the correct time
during their development, become
incapable of reproducing although
normal in all other respects. The
radiatio»n induces sterility, and when a
sterilized insect mates either with a
normal insect or another which has
been sterilized there is no progeny.
This fact has led to the "sterile male"
method of control or even eradication
of insect pests.
The technique, stated very simply,
is based on the fact that the wild
normal female of a species will mate
with a sterile male as freely as with
a wild normal male. Therefore, if nine
sterile males and one wild male are
present, nine times out of ten the
female will mate with a sterile male
and she will produce no young. The
more sterile males present, the less
the chance of a mating between a
wild male and a wild female. If
sufficient sterile males are present
during several successive generations,
the population of wild insects declines
to zero, provided reinfestation does
not occur.
The first example of the practical
application of the sterile male
technique was in the south-eastern
United States against the screwworm
fly, which lays its eggs in the wounds
of warm-blooded animals. The dev¬
eloping larvae often cause death un¬
less the animal is treated, the result
being great losses of livestock and
wild game animals.
A "fly factory" was constructed in
Florida to rear and sterilize millions

50 million sterilized flies parachuted each week
20
of screwworm flies a week; these
were then released from aircraft over
the entire infested area. The results
were outstanding. This serious live¬
stock pest was completely eradicated
simply because the wild female
screwworm fly mated more often with
sterile laboratory-reared flies than with
other wild flies there were many more
sterile than normal males present.
The cost of the programmes was
about $10 million; but the screwworm
fly was causing an average loss of
about $20 million a year to the live¬
stock industry in the region. This
approach has now extended to the
south-western United States and
northern Mexico.
This success provided a stimulus to
begin research on several other
species of harmful insects. One of
these is the Mediterranean fruit fly
(Medfly for short, Ceratitis capitata to
the entomologist) which attacks many
types of fruit and causes serious
losses. Very much like the common
housefly in appearance, it is spreading
far beyond the Mediterranean and in
recent years has established itself in
the Americas. Research during the
past few years has demonstrated that
the sterile male technique is applicable
in controlling this insect.
At the present time a major
demonstration is being conducted in
Central America. This programme is
being carried out on behalf of the
U.N. Development Programme as a
co-operative undertaking by the IAEA,
FAO, the International Regional Organ¬
ization for Plant and Animal Protec¬
tion (OIRSA), the governments of
Mexico, Guatemala, El Salvador, Hon¬
duras, Nicaragua, Costa Rica and
Panama (all members of OIRSA),
and the U.S.A.
Many of the problems associated
with enlarging a laboratory project to
a large-scale field project have been
solved. At the present time more than
50,000,000 of the flies are being
reared and sterilized each week.
Most of them are released from the
air over two experimental areas. At
the same time research goes on to
achieve more efficient methods of
rearing, handling, releasing, trapping
and transporting.
It is anticipated that upon completion
of this project, methods will have been
developed which can be used for
large-scale eradication or control
programmes against the Medfly.
Additional research for the same
purpose is being conducted In Italy,
where the International Atomic Energy
Agency is co-operating with the Italian
Atomic Energy Commission in demon¬
strating that the sterile male technique
is effective, and experiments during
1967 on the islands of Capri and
Ischia quite conclusively demonstrat¬
ed its potential. This year experiments
on the use of helicopters for releasing
flies, and to determine the minimum
number of sterile flies necessary to
achieve eradication under conditions
in Italy are being made.
The sterile male technique appears
to be particularly promising for control
or eradication of the olive fly. This
insect, also very similar in appearance
to the housefly, attacks, as the name
implies, the olive fruit. Thus its maxi¬
mum distribution is easily determined.
Preliminary work in Greece, partially
supported by the International Atomic
Energy Agency, has shown that the
technique is effective in cages
constructed over olive trees. The
»experiments will be on a wider scale in
the next few years. The one remain-

ing problem to be solved is how to
rear large numbers of flies cheaply,
and research is being carried out by
the IAEA, at its Seibersdorf Labora¬
tory near Vienna, Austria, and in Por¬
tugal and Spain.
Agricultural scientists in Canada and
the United States have proved that the
codling moth, which causes damage to
apples, pears, and certain other fruit
all over the world, can be controlled in
this way. Insecticide sprays are
effective against it but often kill
beneficial insects, causing increased
damage to the fruit by other species
of harmful insects. It is considered
that the sterile male technique can be
used for codling moth control or, under
isolated conditions, eradication.
There are of course great differ¬
ences in utilizing the sterile male
technique for insect control as com¬
pared with insecticides. Insecticides
can be effectively used by an individual
olive producer in his olive grove. If
he were to use the sterile olive flies
they would soon disperse away from
his own trees. The sterile male tech¬
nique is essentially for use by one or
more countries over large areas. The
problem of reinfestation must be
considered If eradication is the goal.
The technique may be particularly
effective against new introductions of
harmful insects into an area or country,
if the proper research has previously
been done. The Medfly was first
found in Central America in the
mid-1950s. If at that time the tech¬
niques had been developed, a relatively
inexpensive programme would have
eradicated the pest.
The same can be said for the few
times that the pest made its way into
the United States and the one time it
was found in Santiago, Chile. On
these occasions, repeated insecticide
sprays have been used to eradicate
the Medfly. The sterile male tech¬
nique would be very useful under
these conditions, and the time may
well come when it will automatically
be put into operation to prevent new
threats from becoming serious.
The insects already mentioned are
only some of those now being studied
as suitable for atomic means of
control. There are many others, some
of them much more dangerous both
to food and health. Discussions at
the most recent international meeting
in Vienna ranged over ticks, aphids,
mosquitos, wasps, locusts, sugar cane
borers, cotton weevils, pine cater¬
pillars, and the tsetse fly again' to
mention only a few. Much information
was also revealed to assist in making
better use of beneficial insects, of
which the bee is a notable example.
A word about the tsetse fly, whose
ravages make large areas of Africa
precarious for men and animals. It is
too early to raise high hopes about
defeating it, but enough has been
learned to indicate that, difficult as
the problem Is, the new nuclear tech¬
niques, linked with other scientific
approaches, might finally bring relief.
Many years of research lie ahead
and much money will have to be
spent if it can be found. Just as an
indication of the task, we still have
to breed in captivity a tsetse fly
vigorous enough to compete with the
wild specimen. Substitute foods have
not yet been as effective as the warm
blood of living animals.
R ADIOISOTOPES have pro¬
vided scientists with ways of probing
secrets of nature on the most minute
scale ever achieved. They have been
widely used during the past 10 to
15 years in research associated with
insect control. "Labelling" insects
with a material such as radioactive
phosphorus, has enabled entomologists
to follow the movement of insects
under natural conditions.
For example, if Medflies tagged in
this way are released in an orange
grove, their movements can be
accurately followed by trapping, and
using a Geiger counter to find if any
are radioactive. In this way it was
found that Medflies do not ordinarily
move more than a few hundred metres
under favourable conditions. This is a
very important fact to take into consi¬
deration in using the sterile male tech¬
nique. Other insects fly several miles.
Another useful application of radio-
labelled insects is in population density
studies. A known number of tagged
insects are released and a few days
later traps are set up. The ratio of
tagged insects to untagged insects
may be used to estimate the wild
insect population in the area.
When no adequate trapping tech¬
nique is available, insects can be
tagged with gamma-emitting radio¬
isotopes such as cobalt-60. These
can be detected by portable instru¬
ments at distances up to several
meters, enabling the precise location
of the insect to be determined at night,
in the soil, in tree trunks, and in other
places where it cannot be seen.
How is this labelling, or tagging,
done? The radioisotope can be
included in the media used to grow
the insects, fed to the adult insects,
or applied to the body surface. In
certain cases a tiny piece of radio¬
active wire is glued onto the insect.
The procedure varies with the insect
and with the information needed.
The use of radioactive materials has
vastly Increased our knowledge of
insecticides. One or more radio¬
isotopes are incorporated into the
molecules of the chemical during its
manufacture. This does not affect
its biological action, but enables
measurements to be made of
extremely small quantities. Entom¬
ologists and chemists have in this
way been able to study what happens
to the material in insects, animals, soil,
plants, etc.
The fate of insecticides in various
biological systems is important for
several reasons. It has been founa
that some are biochemically converted
in plants and animals to compounds
and become less poisonous or even
non-poisonous to insects. Others
become more poisonous. It is
important to know these facts before
the compounds reach the public.
Radio-labelling has been widely used
to study how insecticides kill. The
objective of this research is to make
new insecticides which will kill
selectively without ill effects to man,
animals and beneficial insects. It is
hoped that this work will ultimately
lead to production of efficient selective
insecticides which can be safely and
economically used.
There are many uses for radio¬
isotopes in fundamental studies of
insect physiology. By tagging certain
naturally occurring compounds in
insects, it is possible to study many of
the enzymes and hormones that
control their development and behav¬
iour. Once these physiological pro¬
cesses are understood, it may be
possible to alter them and perhaps to
control the pest.
As can be seen from this brief
description, atomic energy is a valuable
tool in controlling harmful insects. It
will become more valuable in the future
as more entomologists are trained to
take advantage of the exciting possi¬
bilities it opens up.

CARBON
Nuclear clock

Will radiocarbon, a remarkable device for
dating geologic time, show us that the dawn
of man's history was more remote than we
think? Carbon-14 has solved many problems
for archaeologists and historians, but has
also posed quite a few new ones.
about 5,700 years; a good part of the
radiocarbon in our body was produced
before the dawn of history.
So as we see, the material from
which life grows comes from the air
and comes from the carbon dioxide
in the air, and in eight thousand years
the atmosphere will have been very
thoroughly mixed by the winds.
We know now, incidentally, from
our work on radioactive fall-out, that
the mixing process takes only five to
ten years at the most before the
atmosphere is thoroughly mixed. So
even though the radiocarbon is pro¬
duced at greater altitudes than ten
miles, in a matter of a few years it
will have come down to the lowest
levels where it can be incorporated
into plants.
The plants eat the radiocarbon from
the cosmic ray manufacture and then
we eat plants, so all living things
become radioactive with carbon-14.
e are made of three things
in essence carbon dioxide, water
vapour, sunlight and a pinch of salt!
Photosynthesis produces green
plants by the conversion of carbon
dioxide and water to plant materials,
using the energy of sunlight.
Nature produces radiocarbon by the
irradiation of the air by cosmic rays.
Radiocarbon has an average lifetime
of 8,000 years and a half lifetime of
WILLARD F. LIBBY, Nobel Prize Winner
for chemistry, 1960, is a leading inter¬
national authority on radiocarbon dating,
and has been active in the field of atomic
energy and nuclear studies for a quarter
of a century. A member of the U.S.
Academy of Science and many other
scientific institutions both in the U.S.A. and
other countries, he is the author of
numerous articles, appearing principally in
scientific journals. Professor Libby's text
is based on an address he delivered at
the International Atomic Energy Agency
headquarters in Vienna, in 1966.
History is a really very recent matter
in terms of radiocarbon. Our oldest
historical records are less than one
half-life of radiocarbon. In terms of
the age of the earth, however, radio¬
carbon is short-lived. The age of the
earth is something like 5,000 million
years, which is a million half-lives of
radiocarbon. Radiocarbon has little
application to the broad sweep of
geological processes, but it does have
application to human history.
This is how it works. In the to'pmost
layers of the atmosphere, at altitudes
of about 50,000 feet, cosmic rays pro¬
duce radiocarbon by converting the
nitrogen into carbon-14, with a differ¬
ent chemistry. Carbon in air will burn
and the product is mainly carbon
dioxide. Carbon dioxide is our sub¬
stance.
Most important for radiocarbon dat¬
ing is that our contact with cosmic
rays exists only so long as we continue
to eat. As long as we are alive and
continue to eat, we continue to absorb
and ingest radiocarbon.
The carbon-14 atoms in our body,
which are 8,300 years old on the
average, have been many times in the
air as carbo<n dioxide, have been
brought down to the earth as part of
the plants, or more likely have been
dissolved in the great depths of the
ocean. In this great span of time, the
winds blow the radiocarbon around,

Carbon-14 is the best example of a
planetary hour-glass. It has been produced
in the upper atmosphere at a virtually
constant rate for the past 50,000 years.
The C-14 cycle, then, is like an hourglass
in which the sand in the upper part is
replenished as fast as it runs out of the hole
in the waist. Newly produced C-14 is
taken up by all living plants» and animals.
All carbon in living organisms contains
a constant proportion of C-14. When a
plant or animal dies no more new C-14 is
added but the old C-14 continues to run
out, and starts to measure time as an
hourglass should. Ancient objects can be
dated by determining how much C-14
remains and then calculating back to the
time when the radioactivity from the C-14
was» the same as that now found in a
living organism. The processes used are
very complicated, involving the reduction
of the carbon to a gas either by burning,
or chemically (photo left) and counting
the C-14 disintegrations in the gas.

though the cosmic rays vary very
strongly with the geographical latitude
being much more intense in north¬
ern and southern latitudes than in the
equatorial after this great period of
time we should expect the distribution
over the earth to be uniform.
We do indeed find that, in Nature,
living matter such as pieces of wood
and flesh, or other living material from
various species and various locations,
all have the same amount of radio¬
carbon in them (per unit amount per
gramme of carbon). That is, the
composition the concentration of
radiocarbon in the carbon of the living
matter is uniform over the entire world
and in all species, because of this
continuous mixing. As long as we
live, we are part of a giant system
which is continuously stirred. We
belong to the oceans and to the air
and we are all part of the same
system, but our connexion is through
our mouths, through food.
Radiocarbon dating, operates on this
basic principle. Once we die, we stop
eating. Once we die, the ingestion of
radiocarbon is terminated. Of course,
it is a characteristic of all radioactive
materials that they themselves disin¬
tegrate and disappear and transform.
In the case of radiocarbon, the trans¬
formation occurs at the rate of 50 per
cent every 5,700 years, and the result
is the re-formation of the original nitro¬
gen from which the carbon came.
In the course of this transformation,
a radiation is emitted which allows us
to detect the death act of the radio¬
active atom. If we put carbon dioxide
gas (obtained by burning a piece of
wood) in a counter, by listening to
the count-rate we can detect the
disappearance of the carbon atoms
as they are reconverted into nitrogen.
It takes somewhat over 4,000 million
radiocarbon atoms to give one disin¬
tegration per minute, because the
average life of radiocarbon is 8,300
years, or 4,400 million minutes. So
4,400 million radiocarbon atoms are
needed to get a detectable radiation
in the carbon dioxide in a counter.
Although this seems a large number
of radiocarbon atoms, it is not large
percentage-wise. The total number of
atoms in a gramme of carbon is
1012 times this that is, we have only
one radiocarbon atom in a million mil¬
lion ordinary carbon atoms. This is the
standard concentration in living matter.
And at the time of death, all living
things begin with this rate. They will
have a count rate which corresponds
to the occurrence of about 66,000 mil¬
lion radio atoms per gramme of car¬
bon that is a total disintegration rate
of about 15 per minute per gramme.
The first thing in our development
of radiocarbon dating was to prove
that it was indeed so, that radiocarbon
occurred in all living tissues and at
the expected uniform level. This was
done fairly quickly and it was grati¬
fying to find that our rather simple-
minded theorizing was correct.
Now, as the years have gone by and
more accurate measurements have
been made, we find that it wasn't
actually absolutely correct. There are
very tiny differences between species
for example, sea life has just a little
bit less radiation than it should have,
for there seems to be a kind of natural
barrier against carbon dioxide in the
air dissolving in sea water. It doesn't
dissolve rapidly.

Dead Sea Scrolls
In a general way, we went forward
in our innocence finding that every¬
thing worked. I have never been con¬
nected with such a lucky piece of
research. For example, we supposed
that the oceans mixed rapidly, and
that most of the hold-up of radio¬
carbon would take place in the ocean
which has far more carbon dissolved
as sea salts than is contained in all
living matter.
We had to calculate from our
knowledge of the cosmic ray produc¬
tion rate what the expected concentra¬
tion would be. If we only considered
the biosphere [the part of the world
where life can exist] its expected con¬
centration would be thirty times greater
than the level which we actually found.
However, we rightly guessed that the
oceans would mix rapidly and that the
concentration in the biosphere would
be thirty times lower than the rate of
cosmic ray production would seem to
suggest.
There is, in fact, thirty times more
carbon in the ocean than in the whole
of the biosphere. We were lucky
there. We were lucky also in suppos¬
ing that the turnover of humus is rapid,
or rather that the hold-up is not serious
in the terms of the whole inventory,
although we knew full well that coal
and oil and all organic matter of this
sort would be long since purged of
radiocarbon by radioactive decay.
The next stage of the research was
to see if it was really so that
5,700 year-old mummies showed only
half as much radiocarbon as a person
living today. There are no 5,700 year-
old mummies, the oldest ones are
4,800 years o»ld that is, ones whose
ages are relatively well-known, so
that we could use them for a check.
These are the first dynasties of Egypt,
where the oldest recorded history
applies.
When one goes back to the dawn
of history, the certainty with which
the historians know the dates de¬
creases. I would say, from talking with
historians, that they would stake their
lives on 3,750 years, but with anything
older than that, they begin to shake a
little bit. But they can go back to
Sesostris III in the 12th dynasty of
Egypt and argue very firmly.
So we had two periods in which
to check our method one was 3,700
years and the other was about a
thousand years preceding that. We
were very fortunate in that our checks
with one or two exceptions were
excellent. One of the exceptions was
discovered when we worked in colla¬
boration with the distinguished Oriental
Institute of the University of Chicago
with the great collection that James
H. Breasted had made from Egypt.
And our third object from Egypt turn¬
et out to be modern! It was one of
the famous U.S. egyptologist's prize
collections, supposed to be from the
fifth dynasty, as I remember. This was
a dark day.
But having succeeded on the first
two measurements, the people in the
Institute checked their records and
said they thought it was entirely
possible that the U.S. egyptologist
had been hoaxed. The only Inter¬
pretation we have for that measure¬
ment today is that he was "sold a
bill of goods".
But by and large, we have had few
shocks. For example, on Stonehenge
we obtained 3,700 years, which agreed
excellently with the predictions of
WORLD'S
OLDEST
TREE AND
CARBON-14
To find out the age
of a tree, all we
need do is count
the rings in the
trunk (right) since
each ring
represents a year's»
growth. Wood,
which contains
radiocarbon, can be
used for a simple
countercheck of
results obtained by
carbon-14 dating.
The oldest living
organism on earth
is the American
bristle cone pine
(left) which has
lived for 6,000 years
or over. With the
help of this tree it
has been found
that beyond 3,500
years» ago, dates
obtained by
carbon-14 diverge
increasingly from
established
historical dates.
Carbon-14 seems to
"rejuvenate" a
material by
200 years at
3500 B.C. and by
800 years at
4000 B.C.
Professor Stuart Piggott, the great
scholar of Stonehenge.
Throughout Roman and Egyptian
history, we have no disagreements.
We haven't had very many measure¬
ments to make because in general
the archeologists know the dates
better than we can measure them, and
it is usually as a favour that they give
us samples.
We take about an ounce of material
to make a measurement about 20 to
30 grammes of fairly rich carbona¬
ceous material is the normal amount,
and in some of these objects that is
too large an amount to be spared. On
the other hand, we can sometimes
make do with samples which would
otherwise not be useful. For instance,
we dated the Dead Sea scrolls the
manuscript of the book of Isaiah by
using the linen wrapping in which it
was found.
There has been no serious shortage
of materials back to about 3,700 years
with which we could check the accur¬
acy and reliability of dating by car-

bon-14. And the answer is that the
method seems to be reliable to> within
the error of the measurement as it
existed when we began the method
in the early 1950s an error of about
± 100 years or so.
More recently, extremely careful
measurements with very accurate
instruments have shown that there are
systematic deviations, indicating that
the rate of radiocarbon production was
not strictly constant.
A rate had been an implicit assump¬
tion at the outset. When we com¬
pared the radiocarbon in an Egyptian
mummy with that in a modern man,
we assumed that he lived under similar
conditions. This assumed that the
radiocarbon production rate at that
time was the same, that cosmic rays
were the same, and that the amount
of ocean water was the same in
other words, that the amount of carbon
dilution was the same. We have fairly
good evidence that the ocean hasn't
changed much, either in composition or
level, In 5,000 years. This ¡s a very
brief time in geological history.
But the problem of cosmic rays is an
open question. Peo»ple have very little
understanding of the origin of cosmic
rays. We believe that they come from
outside the solar system, and have
very good evidence for that. But
there are various subtleties about even
that because, even if they come from
outside the solar system, they have to
reach the earth.
Cosmic rays are deflected by matter
and particularly by magnetic fields,
and the sun is continuously sending
off ionized matter in clumps, which
carry locked-in magnetic fields capable
of deflecting cosmic rays.
According to a study made by Dr.
Hans Suess, of the University of Cali¬
fornia, San Diego ("The climatic
changes in cosmic ray production rate
of radiocarbon") when there is hot
weather for as long as a century, it
means that the sun is specially active
in sending out lots of plasma, and
therefore the production of radiocar¬
bon Is especially low. In consequence,
during that century radiocarbon dates
are too old.
Conversely, when there is a century
or two of cold weather, the sun is
inactive and the cosmic rays come in
better, so radiocarbon dates are too
young. The errors are about ± 50
years, so it is almost within our exper¬
imental error.
Dr. Suess has been very ener¬
getic in making lots of measurements,
using tree rings for his materials, so
he knows the dates quite accurately,
and I think there is little doubt that he
is right.
We have been doing work on
English manor houses in recent years;
the historical dates are excellently
known for many of these homes and
we find our agreement has improved
if we make Dr. Suess's little correc¬
tions. He has made the point that
there is a deviation which is small but
measurable. But by and large the
agreement has been gratifyingly good.
The consequences of the agreement
are interesting namely that the cosmic
rays, the level of solar plasma and the
earth's magnetic field have remained

LONG-LIVED
NUCLEAR CLOCKS
The time span for dating materials by the carbon-14
method is from 1,000 to 50,000 years. As this is
a relatively short time measured on the geologic
scale, scientists have searched for and have found
in nature other nuclear clocks with far longer lives.
Their dials tell the time not merely in centuries and
thousands of years, but in millions and thousands
of millions. The long-lived clocks measure age in
the same way as carbon-14 by the time taken for
their radioactive atoms to decay, but their rate of
decay is» far slower than that of carbon-14, slow
enough in fact for them to have survived in certain
rock and mineral formations. By studying the natural
decay of uranium to lead, for instance, scientists
have been able to calculate the age of the earth
as 4,500 million years. Other materials present in
rocks have provided a number of nuclear dating
methods. With potassium-argon it is possible to
tell the age of rocks 100,000 to 10,000,000 years
old; calculations based on the natural fission of
uranium-238 permit the dating of materials up to
1,000,000,000 years old; and the rubidium-strontium
method has a time span of over five million years.
Nuclear dating methods, which are constantly being
improved, have already contributed substantially to
man's knowledge of his planet's history.

essentially constant and that the ocean
depth has not changed appreciably.
This is not a very surprising result.
But when we finish with recorded
history, we have not used even half
the radiocarbon. The way radioactive
decay goes, you lose half in one half-
life and then you lose half of the
remainder in another half-life so that
at the end of two half-lives, that is
11,400 years, you still have 25 per cent
left.
It will take ten half-lives 57,000
years to get down to a tenth of one
per cent. Even with our most sensitive
methods of measurement at this time,
we cannot measure a tenth of one
per cent of the natural life.
So radio»carbon will not apply to
things older than about 50,000 years;
in fact when we go back to 40,000
things get a little uncertain. But
between the dawn of history that is
4,800 years and 40,000 years is a
great span of time.
Within the span of radiocarbon there
were three Ice Ages. It appears that
an Ice Age ¡s world-wide at least it
would be surprising if it were not. It
certainly is hemisphere wide. So if
we find a glacial advance occurring
in North America at a certain time,
we ought to find it occurring in Europe
at the same time. This was one of
our critical prehistorical checks.
We took material from a forest in
Wisconsin which had been pushed over
by a southward-moving glacier. We
measured tree trunks, we measured
the soil in which the trees grew, and
we measured all parts of the verdure
of that forest which had been pre¬
served when the glacier pushed some
twenty feet of dirt which covered it.
We got the same answer for all of
these various parts 11,400 years
to within two or three hundred years.
This had several important messages
for us. One was that even the tiniest
fibres on the rootlets, if properly
cleaned, could be used for reliable
dating, because they were of the same
dates as the pieces of wood on the
big trees. And the humus in the soil
was still authentic and reliable.
Then we went to Europe, and in S
England and northern Germany and ~!
northern France found the same dates. ^
Now we have also found limited à
evidence but it looks conclusive in -5
the southern hemisphere. ©
o
Another epoch in human history f
was the advent of man in North,
South and Central America. For rea¬
sons which are not entirely clear, man
came to the Americas after the melting
of the last ice sheet. He came 10,400
years ago, and he came at the same
time to all three continents.
That is in the sharpest contrast to
the European situation. The oldest
Englishman is 10,400 years old because
he was chased out by the glacier and
then the glacier swept all evidence of
previous man away. That is why
Piltdown worried the life out of us
because Piltdown man was presumably
much older than 10,400 years, and it
was therefore with great comfort that
we learned he was a hoax. We contri¬
buted a little bit towards discovering
the hoax (1). However, the oldest
Englishman is 10,400 years old because
that's when the ice sheet left England
and he was able to walk into Eng¬
land because the Channel was dry.
The oldest American is also 10,400
years old.
We can understand why the oldest
Englishman is 10,400 years old, but it
isn't at all easy to understand why
there isn't someone older in the Ameri¬
cas since not all the Americas were
glaciated.
(1) In 1912, a skull, ¡aw and other bone
fragments thought to be those of an ancestral
human type of the Lower Pleistocene (about
500,000 years ago) were discovered at Pilt¬
down (Sussex), southern England. The
reconstructed skull appeared to conflict with
all the theories of human evolution held at
that time, since it represented a creature with
an entirely modern head and a thoroughly
ape-like jaw. Some scientists were sceptical,
but it was not until 40 years later that
fluorine and other tests showed the skull
to be not more than 50,000 years old and the
jaw that of a modern ape, cunningly faked.
Piltdown Man had finally been exposed as an
elaborate archaeological fraud.

What men did in Europe was
to move to the Mediterranean basin
we have abundant evidence of man
around there that goes back way
beyond radiocarbon. We have just
begun a new dig in Israel, near the
Sea of Galilee, which we think is two
million years old. That is-way beyond
radiocarbon, but we are interested in
it as we may be able to help in dating
the later phases.
After we had dated about a dozen
different sites of earliest man, in North
America, Central America and South
America and obtained 10,400 years for
each one, we began to believe that,
unlikely as it seems, our findings were
true.
As far as I know with one possible
exception all the earliest man sites
in all the three Americas are 10,000
years old, within the error of measure¬
ment. This gives us a consistency
check as well as a new result in human
history.
We could rationalize it and say that
for reasons unknown to us, man didn't
come to the Americas until the Behring
Strait was laid bare by the drop in
sea level resulting from the glacial
formation in the last Ice Age. The
amount of ice was such that the sea
level throughout the world fell by
150 feet. If the ocean level drops by
150 feet, a wide stretch is dry between
Siberia and Alaska and down the west
coast of Alaska and then as far as the
State of Washington. It goes pretty
far out into the ocean.
We have never been able to find
10,400 year-old men in Alaska itself.
This also fits, for the simple reason
that the area was covered In ice. Man
didn't come through Alaska. He walk¬
ed across the Behring Strait and then
he came down the coast which is now
submerged, and his trail is now 150

feet underwater. Then he came inland
to about the State of Washington and
he moved south, and we found him at
the southern tip of South America.
Our most recent date was in the
highest level of the Peruvian Andes at
the 10,400 date.
Other consistency checks include
the measurements of various cultures
that the archeologists may not be
precisely able to date, although they
can pick out certain cultural character¬
istics of a given period. I might
mention one or two. Our 10,400 man
was a very sophisticated person in
some ways. He was a six-footer. He
wore clothes the size of those that we
would wear and, as I have said, he
covered the three continents of the
Americas within the measurement of
error of radiocarbon that is within a
couple of centuries.
E were fortunate in finding
a most remarkable cache in eastern
Oregon (U.S.A.). A road was being
dug there in the late 1940s, and an
archeologist at the University of
Oregon, Dr. Cressman, happened to
warn the foreman of this particular road
crew to be on the look-out he knew
that they were going to make a deep
cut in a pumice deposit of Mount
Newbury.
One day, the foreman called Dr.
Cressman to tell him that he had found
something. And in a cave which was
apparently accidentally covered with
pumice like the pumice that preserved
Pompeii was found a collection of
marvellously artistically woven sandals,
which we date at over 9,000 years.
We have actually succeeded in col¬
lecting a few samples from other sites;
we had one in 1965 which we dated at
8,500 years. These are the shoes that
our prehistoric man wore. In the cave
which Dr. Cressman and his crewmen
found, were three hundred pairs of
these shoes, neatly stacked. A shoe
store!
We were very lucky in this research,
which dates from before the radiocar¬
bon dating method was Invented. Dr.
Cressman took his glue pot to lacquer
these shoes but he ran out of glue.
The glue ruined the shoes for radio¬
carbon dating, but there were six pairs
which he didn't shellac and we got
those for dating.
We found the body of a prehistoric
man on Santa Rosa Island, off the
coast of California, a few years ago.
Why these men, of such ability, did
not write is an amazing enigma. It
is hard to imagine that they were not
intelligent enough. The Lascaux caves
in central France, as is well known,
have been dated at 15,000 years, so
Tartaria tablet Jemdet Nasr tablet (Sumer)

THE ENIGMA OF THE TARTARIATABLETS
Dating by Cdrbon-14 of three ¡nscnoed tablets found in Romania has created
a disturbing enigma for archaeologists, who have long accepted as an exact and
scientifically established fact that writing was invented in western Asia. The earliest
known examples of writing were incised on clay tablets uncovered at Uruk, a Sumerian
city that flourished in Mesopotamia during that region's early Bronze Age, and known
as the Jemdet Nasr tablets, from the site of their discovery. These tablets are known
to be a little over 5,000 years old, and the writing on them, part ideographic, part
pictographic, later evolved into the cuneiform system of writing of which numerous
examples have been unearthed on tablets of clay and stone.
Archaeologists and historians concur on the idea that, in the western world, writing
spread from east to west. But in 1961 they were shaken when three small inscribed
tablets were unearthed from the remains of a Neolithic village at Tartaria, in the
Transylvanian region of Romania. Not only did some of the signs appear to be almost
identical with Sumerian ones of 3000 B.C., but in addition the tablets looked much
like written records produced in Crete around 2000 B.C. The idea that here was
additional proof of writing's spread from east to west was soon dispelled when the
ash-filled pit in which the tablets were found was dated by the carbon-14 method.
From this analysis, the tablets appeared to be 6,000 years old, a thousand years older
in fact than the oldest Sumerian ones.
Could writing have been invented, not in the urban and highly developed civilization
of Sumer, but in a rural European culture only just emerging frdm the stone age?
Scientists found this hard to believe, particularly as the Tartaria tablets were the
unique vestiges of a culture which apparently vanished thousands of years ago.
A number of theories have been advanced to explain this i discovery that seemed
to challenge all previous concepts of the birth of writing. Some archaeologists, while
not doubting the scientific principles of carbon-14 dating, suggested that the method
still involves a considerable margin of error due to factors that are not yet understood.
Another theory, advanced by a Czech archaelogist, was that the geological strata at
Tartaria might have been disturbed by underground movements, and that the tablets
are not as old as the stratum they were found in shows.
If rejuvenated in this way, by some 1,500 to 2,000 years, the Tartaria tablets would
no longer challenge Sumer for the fame of having invented writing. But it still remains
to be shown how inscribed tablets came to be hidden in a remote part of Europe.
Their existence Imay be linked with the extensive trade routes that stretched in
Neolithic times between Europe and western Asia and were used by merchants dealing
in gold and the volcanic glass obsidian of which Transylvania had rich deposits.
Syrian merchants notably were active in spreading knowledge of pottery and other
craft techniques and in establishing cultural contacts. As intermediaries between
Sumer and Crete, they ventured deep into Europe by way of the Danube. Perhaps
they carried a form of writing to the peoples of Transylvania. But it is not yet clear
whether the Tartaria inscriptions were actually writing or simply served as conventional
signs (as, for instance, the owner's marks found on ancient pottery), or again whether
or not they had a religious or magical connotation. In any event, the enigma of
Tartaria remains and is likely to occupy the world's archaeologists for years to come.

CARBON-14 (Continued)
Ice Age casts a chill
on Carbon-14
we have proof that beautiful paintings
were executed five thousand years
before our 10,400 man came along.
To me it is quite clear that these
people were as intelligent as modern
man. Maybe they did write. Maybe
we just haven't found the evidence.
But in any case they have left these
remarkable works.
In the prehistoric Paleolithic Era
there are many fine ancient monuments
of unknown age and history even in
Egypt. We did pre-dynastic work in
Egypt and went back as far as 6,500
years in a fairly continuous record.
We worked with Dr. Caton Thompson,
of Cambridge, who furnished us with
some remarkable samples of ancient
Egyptian grain which she had found
in granaries in the hills surrounding
the Nile valley.
The granaries were filled by farmers
nearly 1,500 years before the first dyn¬
asty, and they still had grain in them
when she came upon them 50 years
or so ago. They were holes dug in
the top of the hills and lined with
straw; the grain was put in and then
covered. We dated that grain.
In England, there is a continuous
unbroken record going back to 10,400
man. Some of the sites are truly re¬
markable, as for example, the Star
Carr site excavated by Professor Gra¬
ham Clarke, at Cambridge, and dated
at nearly 8,000 years.
E
30
VEN in the historic period,
there are known sites in lots of areas,
such as the Americas. But we had no
written records at all in the Americas,
apart from the Mayas. This leaves
only the circumstantial records and
about all we have for dating in many
parts of America is radiocarbon. It
fits reasonably into the sociological
evidence of pottery and things like
this, and we are thus building up a
story in the Americas.
But the point is that even in the
historic period of the last 4,000 years,
radiocarbon does have applications in
various parts of the world, as it does
for the prehistoric periods; it is essen¬
tially all we have in absolute dating.
This question of absoluteness is a
difficult one. It isn't possible to say
unequivocally that radiocarbon dates
are correct. It is possible, I think, to
say that in the last 3,700 years, a radio
carbon date is probably accurate to
within one or two per cent.
In the prehistoric periods, we simply
have to hope that we can develop
some auxiliary check to show whether
the variation of the solar magnetic field
is substantial. We already have con¬
siderable evidence in that the first dy¬
nasty of Egypt agrees pretty well.
There is a tendency for the first dyn¬
asty dates to be different from the
historical dates, and the difference is
such that Dr. Suess's conjecture might
fit.' His conjecture and he himself
insists that it is conjecture, because he
is extrapolating is, in effect: "If you
had a really cold period, then it would
be an Ice Age, and then the radiocar¬
bon dates would be different and so
we must correct the radiocarbon dates
by maybe as much as 2,000 years at
11,000."
This is about the biggest catastrophe
that we can imagine at the moment
happening to radiocarbon dates. In
the 4,000 most recent years, they are
probably good to a couple of centuries.
When they are calibrated in the last
2,000 years, they are probably as
accurate as we can measure.
There are more questions in the
measurement than just the counting
error; there are problems like the tree
rings. If we take a piece of wood, we
find it has various rings and each year
has its own radiocarbo»n in it, We have
to determine very carefully how many
rings there are and whether the wood
came from the inside or the outer part
of the trunk.
We find in the old English houses,
for example, that there is considerable
evidence of the re-use of major tim¬
bers. In the pyramid at Teotihuacan
near Mexico City, we have positive
proof that timbers were used in the
central structures which were several
hundred years old when the pyramid
was built. Things like this have to be
taken into account.
We have been re-investigating the
12 first dynasties of Egypt with the
help of the British Museum for that
very reason. All the graves of early
Egypt were robbed and therefore
there is a serious question of authen¬
ticity in any moveable material. We
have recently developed a technique
of removing protein from bone and
dating it. We are going to do this
on the mummies as we think it is very
unlikely that any grave robber would
have stolen them and later replaced
them.

condensation from a comic book,
"Sophie and Bruno in the Land of

ago by the French Commissariat of
Atomic Energy, in Paris, and illustrat¬
ed by Jacques Castan (1).
In simple everyday terms and
amusing drawings the book tells of
a visit to a nuclear power station by
Sophie and Bruno, and their initia¬
tion into the world within the atom
and of some of the peaceful uses
of atomic energy. We are sure our
young and older readers alike will
take pleasure in joining the two

MAN-MADE ATOMS (Continued)
The reincarnation of extinct' nuclei
chemical energy the energy of the
electron clouds of atoms and mole¬
cules.
The atomic nucleus, that inexhaust¬
ible accumulator of the world's energy,
ceased being an indivisible entity only
in the twentieth century. The very first
investigations of it led to the discovery
of vast sources of unheard of power.
The practical applications of nuclear
physics are not, of course, restricted
to power production. They also com¬
prise investigations of the structure of
materials such as metals and alloys,
methods of analysis billions of times
more sensitive than ever before, and
the increasing use of "tracer" atoms
in biology, agriculture and metallurgy;
nuclear physics has in fact become an
essential element in many modern
industries.
And yet, for all its applications, our
knowledge of the structure of the
atomic nucleus is still far from com¬
plete. A penetration into its mysteries
may well yield much in the most unex¬
pected-spheres of science.
Man has long been intrigued by the
history of the origin of the earth, the
sun, the universe. A reflection of this
is the account of the creation of the
world with which the Old Testament
commences. It would seem that man
could hardly hope to draw a definitive
picture, or even a general outline, of
the beginnings of the world, but nuc¬
lear studies in the last, few decades
have contributed substantially to our
knowledge in this field too.
According to present-day concep¬
tions, the chemical elements of the
solar system were synthesised out of
protons the nuclei of galactic oxy¬
gen. The fundamental bricks of mat¬
ter, protons and neutrons, yielded a
great diversity of agglomerations as a
result of the compression of the prim¬
ordial hydrogen and the resulting
nuclear reactions.
Besides the nuclei of isotopes of the
chemical elements which comprise
the earth today or which have been
synthesized in the laboratory, there
were other isotopes and elements
now unknown to us (1).
It has been calculated that, theoret¬
ically, there are some 5,000 proton-
neutron associations that can hold
together long enough to allow them
to be validly considered as atomic
nuclei. Only 1,500 of these have been
studied to a greater or lesser extent.
The number of isotopes of "natural"
nuclei surviving on earth since the
birth of the universe, some 5,000 mil¬
lion years ago or more, is no more
than 450; the lifetime of all the others
is too short for them to have lasted
to our day.
One can imagine the sensation that
would be caused by the resuscitation
of a mammoth or dinosaur in a bio¬
logical laboratory. Yet physics labora¬
tories all over the world have
recreated nuclei that became "extinct"
thousands of millions of years before
the first dinosaur appeared on earth.
So far, some 1,200 have been
produced, and some of these isotopes
are being manufactured on an indus¬
trial scale.
(1) Isotopes are variant forms of one and
the same element. All the isotopes of a
given element have the same atomic number,
that is, the same number of protons in their
nuclei, but they have different numbers of
neutrons in their nuclei. Isotopes thus differ
only in their atomic weight or mass numbers
which express the total of both protons and
neutrons in the nucleus.
Drawing from "L'Energie Nucléaire",
published by the French Commissariat of Atomic Energy, Paris
ATOM AS BIG AS A
FOOTBALL FIELD. If
an atom were enlarged
to the size of a football
field, as in diagram
left, its nucleus would
be no bigger than a
marble! The inside of
an atom between the
nucleus and the
electrons in orbit
around it is all empty
space. In a single
drop of water there
are 60 million million
atoms of hydrogen and
30 million million atoms
of oxygen. Electrons
whirling around the
nucleus, circle it
7,000,000,000,000,000
times a second.
The study and systematization of
the properties of synthetic nuclei have
provided the fundamental empirical
data on which contemporary notions
of nuclear structure are based. But
the synthesis and study of two or
three thousand additional nuclear
"dinosaurs" would substantially contri¬
bute to our knowledge and concep¬
tions In this important scientific
domain, especially as some of the still
unsynthesized nuclei possess highly
interesting properties with an excess
or shortage of neutrons and with high
atomic numbers.
Nuclear matter in such nucleonic
associations must be in unusual, "limit¬
ing" states, investigation of which
usually yields considerable results.
We already know that revolutionary
changes in scientific thinking have
resulted from discoveries made during
studies of the behaviour of matter in
extreme conditions of temperature and
pressure.
Especially dramatic is the history of
the discovery of the isotopes of the
transuranium elements, that is, iso¬
topes with atomic numbers higher than
uranium number 92 in the Periodic
Table (2). None of these isotopes is
stable enough for it to have survived
till our time.
Of all the synthetic elements the
"most important" is plutonium, or
rather its isotope with mass number
239, which is capable of sustaining a
nuclear chain reaction. In fact, pluto¬
nium-239 has proved the most suitable
material for nuclear weapons as well
as for the peaceful production of nuc¬
lear energy.
But though nuclear bombs are today
made of plutonium, it would hardly
be right to say that the only result of
the discovery of this new element
was the creation of one more threat to
humanity. It is plutonium that opens
up the prospects of the peaceful utili¬
zation of the energy of heavy nuclei
on a substantial scale, since plutonium-

uranium isotope which exists in com¬
paratively abundant quantities, but
which cannot be directly used as a
nuclear fuel.

elements, of which 104 some natural, others

Table was established in 1869 by the Russian
chemist, Dmitri I. Mendeleyev. After studying
the chemical and physical properties of
the 63 elements known in 1869, Mendeleyev
was able to show that these properties tend¬
ed to repeat themselves in periodic fashion
as one went up the scale of atomic weights.

ATOM BUSTER. Above the control panel of a synchrotron particle accelerator at the
Institute of Nuclear Physics, in Akademgorodok, Siberia (U.S.S.R.), a diagram shows the
shape of the "race track," along which scientists boost atomic particles to fantastic speeds
(hundreds of thousands of kilometres in a few seconds). The particles then strike atomic
nuclei targets and smash them open, releasing their component parts for scientific analysis.
Accelerators are like "super microscopes" which permit scientists to see the formerly
invisible world within the atom. Increasingly powerful accelerators, now used by scientists
on every continent, are vital for peaceful nuclear research (see "Unesco Courier", Mar. 1966).
be directly used in nuclear reactors,
exists only in very limited quantities,
being 140 times less plentiful than
uranium-238. There would simply not
be enough uranium-235 for the peace¬
ful uses of the atom.
The energy reserves contained in
the nuclei of uranium-238 are suffic¬
ient to supply human needs for tens
of thousands of years, even allowing
for vastly increased demands in the
future. Thus, the production of the
first synthetic elements and the in¬
vestigation of their properties may
play a decisive role In the extremely
important field of providing for the
energy needs of mankind.
The elements from numbers 95 to
100, which do not have the practical
value of plutonium, have been synthe¬
sized. The process of the production
of new elements, which is done by
subjecting heavy atomic nuclei to high
intensity irradiation by neutrons, can
to some extent serve as an indication
of how heavy elements are naturally
synthesized in the universe.
Data thus obtained have served as
the basis for postulating many attrac¬
tive theories of the origin of chemical
elements, and nuclear experiments
tend to confirm that these hypotheses
describe processes not so different
from those that actually take place.
Nuclei with atomic numbers of over
100 must be synthesized by the fusion
of two complex nuclei. Usually, one
of these, the nucleus of the heavy
element, is a component of the target
bombarded by oxygen, neon or argon
nuclei accelerated to one-tenth the
velocity of light. Nuclei colliding at
such speeds overcome the forces of
repulsion existing between them and
produce the nucleus of a new element.
The half-life of the isotopes of ele¬
ments with atomic numbers greater
than 100 is very short, and the quan¬
tity produced in nuclear reactions is
very small. Nevertheless, in 1955, the
101st square in Mendeleyev's Periodic
Table was occupied by a new synthetic
element produced by a team of Amer¬
ican physicists and chemists headed
by Glenn Seaborg, which they named
mendelevium (in honour of Mende¬
leyev).
The next step was the synthesis of
element 102. Within a year, its dis¬
covery was announced in scientific
journals. However, the early works
abounded in errors, and it was ten
more years before the new element
was finally identified.
The difficulties of studying element
102 stem from the small half-life of
its isotopes, which is at best measured
in minutes, and more often lasts sec¬
onds or fractions of a second. That
is why the traditional chemical method
of identifying the element could not
be applied.
New methods based on other phy¬
sical principles were required- They
were developed at the Lawrence
Radiation Laboratory at Berkley, Cali¬
fornia, and the Joint Nuclear Research
Institute, an international scientific
centre of twelve socialist countries
located at Dubna on the Volga, not
far from Moscow.
It was in the Nuclear Reactions
Laboratory at Dubna that in 1966 the
first reliable data on the properties of
five isotopes of elements 102 were
obtained. A year later, the findings
were confirmed by American scientists.
Undaunted by the difficulties they
had to overcome, the scientists follow¬
ed up the synthesis of element 102
with elements 103 and 104. Of special
scientific value was the investigation
of element 104 discovered at the
Nuclear Reactions Laboratory and
named kurchatovium, after the out¬
standing Russian physicist, Igor
Kurchatov.
In initial experiments, physical
methods were used to measure the
half-life of one of the isotopes of
kurchatovium, which was found to be
around 0.5 seconds. In the synthesis,
a nucleus of kurchatovium had to be
detected amongst thousands of mil¬
lions of "ballast" nuclei bred in accom¬
panying reactions. This is something
like the task one would face if one
were given a few moments to locate
a particular grain of wheat in a hundred
sacks of a 100 kilogrammes each.
Then a method was devised for
studying the chemical properties of
individual atoms, taking advantage of
the very fast chemical reactions that
occur in the gaseous state. The devel¬
opment of this method was made

MAN-MADE ATOMS (Continued)

easier by the marked difference be-
twen the chemical properties of kur¬
chatovium and other transuranium
elements.
On an average one nucleus was re¬
gistered in each six hours of experi¬
ments.
The difficulties of studying elements
with such high numbers derive both
from their very short half-life and from
the meagre production of new nuclei.
The difficulties increase with the rise
in atomic numbers, and after element
106 or 107 they may well prove to be
insurmountable by present methods
of nuclear physics. Does this mean
that the problem of studying elements
with high atomic numbers will face an
impasse?
Element number 83, bismuth, is fol¬
lowed by polonium, astatine, radon and
other isotopes with a very short half-
life. Yet isotopes of thorium, uranium
and plutonium have much greater half-
lives Following the sharp drop in
longevity after bismuth, the half-life of
higher elements at first increases
(thorium, uranium, plutonium) before
decreasing again, with americium,
curium, ... nobelium (102), lawrencium
(103), kurchatovium (104), . . . Perhaps
there will be a new rise. Perhaps
durable elements with atomic numbers
above the hundred mark do exist.
E ARLY in the 1930s, at the
_dawn of nuclear physics, a strange
periodicity was observed: atomic
nuclei in which the numbers of protons
or neutrons are 2, 8, 20, 28, 50, 82 or
126 are distinguished by their high
stability. It was found that the abund¬
ance of such elements as tin, with 50
protons in the nucleus, barium, with
82 neutrons, and lead, with 82 protons,
is much greater than that of their neigh¬
bours in the Periodic Table.
No explanation for this was offered
at the time, and physicists began to
call these proton or neutron numbers
"magic numbers". If the proton or
neutron number in a nucleus is a
"magic number", that nucleus is un¬
usually stable. A "doubly magic", nu¬
cleus is the lead isotope 208, which
contains 82 protons and 126 neutrons.
Modern theory has now provided an '
explanation of the law of "magic num¬
bers". It has been found that, just as
the electrons that orbit about the
nucleus form electron shells, the nuc¬
léons within the atomic nucleus form
neutron and proton shells. Their
structure is, of course, quite different
from those of electron shells. But, as
in the case with electron shells, the
more stable nuclei are those of iso¬
topes in which the nucleón shells are
completely filled.
Theoretically, the 114th and 126th
elements should be "super-elements"
with closed proton and neutron shells.
As "doubly magic" nuclei possess
extra stability, in the domain of the
114th and 126th elements there may
be isotopes with a relatively long
half-life.
We cannot be absolutely sure that
the postulated stability will in fact be
found to exist. This, however, does
not detract from the importance of
the quest, for if no new domains of
stability exist then it will be necessary
to revise many concepts of modern
nuclear theory. If, on the other hand,
the prediction of stability domains is
found to be valid, this will open up
new roads for the study of atomic
nuclei.
To reach the domain of the 126th
element, the atomic number of the
target nuclei must be increased by
many units, thus bypassing many
squares of the Periodic Table. An
example of such a reaction which
could yield a nucleus of element 126
is the fusion of thorium and krypton
nuclei with the emission of several
neutrons.
Another possibility is the fusion of
two uranium nuclei. The resultant
nucleonic structure will be unstable
and will decay into nuclear fragments
among which the isotopes of elements
with a high atomic number may occur.
Reactions like this require heavy
nuclei such as uranium to be acceler¬
ated to one-tenth the speed of light.
In this case, their energy will be
sufficient to overcome the electric
repulsion forces of the target nuclei
and form a super-heavy drop of nu¬
clear matter the disintegration of
ATOMIC BUBBLE BATH. To see what happens inside an atom, scientists
place a sort of "nuclear eye" called a bubble chamber to trap high energy
particles discharged from an accelerator. Shooting into a superheated liquid,
each particle forms a trail of bubbles. In this way, particles whose lives-
may be as brief as a hundred million million millionths of a second can be
photographed for identification and analysis (example seen on cover photo).
Bubble chamber shown here is used in laboratory at the European Organization
for Nuclear Research in Geneva.

which would result in the appearance
of new super-elements. It must be
said that technologically this is a
quite feasible task which, furthermore,
does not call for the heavy capital
outlays required for high-energy proton
accelerators.
Such projects are being considered
in many countries. It is hard to say
when the super-elements will be syn¬
thesized, but then it is not so long
since the synthesis of elements 102
or 104 seemed a fantastic undertaking.
How far can we advance in nuclear
synthesis; what are the limits set here
by nature?
The nuclei of kurchatovium were de¬
tected from the tracks of their frag¬
ments produced in spontaneous fis¬
sion. Incidentally, similar tracks
found in components of the earth's
crust can provide interesting informa¬
tion about the changes of temperature
of rocks at the time when the earth
was cooling. These tracks were made
by the fragments resulting from the
disintegration of the unstable elements
which were created at the same time
as all other atomic nuclei when the
universe originated some thousands of
millions of years ago.
The process of spontaneous fission
becomes of growing importance with
the increase in the atomic numbers of
elements, and starting with the 98th
element, californium, it is the main type
of radioactive decay for many iso¬
topes.
It is 'this that sets the limit to our
advance in studying the higher elem¬
ents. All nucleonic structures with
atomic numbers exceeding 126 must
apparently decay so fast as to make
it impossible to investigate them, and
even if some means is devised, it is
hard to designate as an atomic nuc¬
leus a drop of nuclear matter that
disintegrates in, say, a hundredth of
a nanosecond (a nanosecond = one-
thousand millionth of a second).
IHE methods used for
synthesizing and identifying atomic
nuclei are employed in solving a great
many purely applied problems, such as
studying the structure of materials,
mineral prospecting, the detection of
very low concentrations of substances
in mixtures (highly important in the
production of semiconductors used in
electronic equipment), and the use of
"tracer" atoms.
Further prospects of practical appli¬
cations are connected with the de¬
velopment of methods of synthesizing
new elements and isotopes. They
will depend fundamentally on the
creation of accelerators for nuclei of
the heavier elements in the Periodic
Table, up to and including thorium and
uranium.
In all likelihood, such accelerators
will by built in the next few years.
This will make it possible to synthe¬
size, within the coming ten or twenty
years, three or four thousand new nuc¬
lear entities including "super-ele¬
ments", such as numbers 114 and 126-
Will these studies yield discoveries
of an importance comparable to that
of the discovery of plutonium? Un¬
doubtedly. The synthesis and study
of thousands of isotopes possessing
highly significant nuclear properties
will enable scientists to gain a deeper
understanding of the structure of nuc¬
lear matter, and hence, provide broad
possibilities for the practical appli¬
cations of nuclear research.
What destiny awaits the future great
discoveries in nuclear physics? This
will depend on the men in whose
hands they will be placed. Discoveries
as such are neither useful nor harmful.
It is their utilization that brings ethical
problems to the fore. New energies
should serve for strengthening the
social basis and prosperity of mankind,
not for destruction. This is what
ethical scientists have always hoped
for, scientists who fully realize the
value of their research for man, for life
on earth.

NUCLEAR ENERGY
AND OUR FUTURE
by Glenn T. Seaborg
Nobel Prize, 1951
IAN lives by energy. The
more he can put to work, the better
he lives. By harnessing energy, he
can flick a switch to pump water, start
a train, heat a home or light a city.
In the 21st century, most of this
energy will come from the nucleus of
the atom, and by using it wisely man
can Improve the way he produces
food, uses water and raw materials»,
handles waste and builds cities.
The need for improvement is
evident. By the year 2000, experts
predict the earth's population will
double. Some expect an eventual
population of 15 thousand million
people, five times today's total.
But the earth itself will not grow,
and to support these extra thousands
of millions we must learn to use and
reuse our resources with an efficiency
we rarely even approach today.
Energy is a resource, and by far
the most important contribution the
atom will make to the world of
tomorrow will result from the com¬
bination of very cheap electricity and
heat for use in manufacturing proces¬
ses which it can make possible, part¬
icularly with the full development of
breeder reactors which create more
nuclear fuel than they burn.
One must emphasize that having a
large amount of cheap energy is not
a panacea in itself. We must develop
the technology to take advantage of
this energy; it must be applied skil¬
fully, productively and wisely by
people who have the tools and train¬
ing to use it.
Some scientists have considered
42
GLENN T. SEABORG, chairman of the
U.S. Atomic Energy Commission, and
Nobel Prize Winner in chemistry (1951,
with E.M. McMillan) has a distinguished
record in nuclear chemistry and leadership
in scientific and educational affairs.^ He
was co-discoverer of plutonium, of the
isotopes plutonium-239, uranlum-233, nep-
tunium-237; and of the elements 94 (ame-
ricium), 96 (curium), 97 (berkelium), 98
(californium), 99 (einsteinium), 100 (fer-
mium), 101 (mendelevium), and element 102.
Dr. Seaborg and his colleagues have also
identified over 100 isotopes of elements
throughout the Periodic Table. He is the
author of some 200 scientific papers, and
was a member of the U.S. delegation to
Moscow for the signing of the 1964 Test-
Ban Treaty.
the concept of using these huge
amounts of energy in giant nuclear
powered industrial complexes, which
we have called "Nuplexes", the
energy heart of which would be
breeder reactors, with a generating
capacity in the multi-million kilowatt
range.
A variety of industrial plants coupled
to the energy centre would interchange
goods and services through a maze
of underground arteries, conveyor
belts and pipelines.
Iron might be produced by reduc¬
tion methods. Steel, phosphorus or
calcium carbide might be made by
electric furnace methods. Other
plants might produce aluminium, cop¬
per and nitric acid using electrolysis
and electrolytic hydrogen. Synthetic
materials of all kinds would be pro¬
duced in still other plants.
If we can develop the sophisticated
chemical techniques to capitalize on
the cheap power, we might some day
be able to completely recycle all our
materials and water so that we would
have an endless supply of raw mater¬
ials and a virtually junkless civilization.
It should be emphasized, however,
that planning, setting up and success¬
fully operating facilities like this will
be a mammoth undertaking requiring
great advance study, a massive
infusion of capital and, above all, the
devotion and hard work of a great
many talented people.
Yet the prospects are so great that
they have excited the imagination of
many of us.
A study conducted last year at the
U.S. Atomic Energy Commission's
Oak Ridge National Laboratory looked
into the possibility of placing nuclear
agro-industrial complexes in arid areas
such as desert coastal plains.
We know already, for instance, that
the economic use of nuclear energy
to desalt water is not far off. A large
dual purpose nuclear powered electric
generating and water desalination
plant has been planned for construc¬
tion in the United States near the
city of Los Angeles.
A report on energy centres by the
Oak Ridge National Laboratory, which
will be available later this year, in¬
dicates some exciting prospects .for
coupling large dual-purpose plants
located in coastal desert areas with
highly scientific farms or "food
factories."
One study in this report considers
the energy heart as a huge breeder
reactor which could generate 1,000,000
kilowatts of electricty and desalt
400 million gallons of water a day.
At the same time, power from the
plant could be used to make ammonia
fertilizer and phosphorus-bearing fer¬
tilizer. It could be that many other
by-products from the seawater brine
could be produced and used locally
or exported.
Electricity from the plant would be
used for highly mechanized farming
and food processing, as well as to
supply light, air-conditioning and power
for transport and communications for
the personnel operating the complex.
On 200,000 acres, irrigated with the
desalted water and fertilized with
locally manufactured products, crops
would be grown which were spec¬
ifically bred for the area. Hardly any¬
thing would be left to chance or the
whims of nature.
Such a food factory could produce
a thousand million pounds of grain
each year, enough to feed almost
2,500,000 people at a level of 2,400
calories a day. In addition, it could
export enough fertilizer to other agri¬
cultural areas to cultivate another
10,000,000 acres of land.
I N our concern over the
world's food supply we tend to con¬
centrate our thoughts on the produc¬
tion of more food, often forgetting that
one-fifth of the world's entire annual
food crop is lost or destroyed by pests
and spoilage.
By the year 2000, we expect to
have largely perfected the techniques
of food irradiation so as to greatly
reduce such losses. Carefully con¬
trolled doses of radiation from certain
radioactive isotopes can destroy pests,
extend the shelf and storage life of
fresh foods and help create new and
hardier crop strains.
Whenever and wherever man can
benefit from heat and electricity,
nuclear energy in its many forms can
help bring about a better world.
Several other nuclear uses of the
future deserve at least a brief mention.

NUCLEAR ENERGY (Continued)
Far beyond our wildest imagination
Nuclear power could be coupled
with tube-well pumps to tap the vast
water resources which lie deep under¬
ground in many arid areas and which
are being identified by the United
Nations Hydrological Decade studies.
Radioisotopes will power batteries
in weather, navigation and com¬
munications satellites. And they may
even serve as power supplies for
surgically implanted artificial hearts.
Before the end of the century,
nuclear reactors no larger than a small
car will be used to propel space craft
for manned missions to Mars. Life
support systems for space travel will
be nuclear powered and some day
nuclear reactors may help man create
a habitable environment for a future
moon colony.
In the future, it may be primarily
nuclear energy and its associated tech¬
nologies that allow man to explore
and exploit the ocean.
Nuclear-powered deep sea research
vessels are already being developed.
By the 21st century, man may be
harvesting food from the sea, mining
its mineral resources, perhaps even
living for extended periods deep
beneath the surface.
If present development programmes
are successful, engineering with
nuclear explosives could help to
release deeply contained gas and ore
reserves and create underground
reservoirs to hold rainfall in regions
where rapid surface evaporation takes
place.
Peaceful nuclear explosives might
also be used to build a canal, a new
harbour or cut through a mountain
barrier (see article page 14).
Because nuclear fuel is compact
and long-lived, the atom's benefits are
less tied to any accident of geography
which gives one country fuel while
denying it to another.
Once a nuclear power station is
built it can be used economically as
readily in the desert as in an industrial
centre. In fact, as I indicated earlier,
it could turn the desert into an in¬
dustrial centre.
Since real economies in nuclear
reactors are most often in large size
plants, the future may see several
nations joining together, in co¬
operation with the advanced nations
and the International Atomic Energy
Agency, to share large nuclear
generating plants as they now share
research machinery in centres such as
the European Organization for Nuclear
Research (CERN) in Geneva, which
Unesco helped create.
This drawing together of men from
many nations to work together and to
share scientific knowledge and tech¬
nological benefits can be a very
important spin-off of nuclear energy.
It would be naive of me to ignore
how nuclear energy was introduced
to the world. I have not forgotten,
nor should my optimism on the power
of the peaceful 'atom be taken to
indicate that I am not realistic about
the ever present question of nuclear
annihilation. I have lived very close
to this question for more than 20 years.
But I have also seen the birth of
nuclear power to light homes and run
factories, to drive ships across the
ocean, to power satellites in orbit. I
have seen the atom used to study
life, to help create knowledge, to im
prove agriculture, to save lives and to
make living more understandable and
more enjoyable.
There is a cosmic 'glue' that binds
the nucleus of the atom. It is a force
stronger than any other force found
in nature. As that cosmic force is
released to the probing of man, and
as we put it to work for man, perhaps
another force will come into existence
one that will bind men together in
a universal way, matching our human
will with the physical powers we have
learned to wield.
If this comes to pass, we may
expect quite a future, and I think it
might well be one far beyond that
which you or I could dare to imagine
today.

Some of them may have to be
contained and isolated for perhaps
hundreds of years.
This may sound formidable, but
there are ways of reducing their
volume for safe storage and new ways
are continually being found of turning
a number of the elements In them to
good use. Some of their constituents
are in fact placed in machines used
for medical work, for processes linked
with agriculture and for some indus¬
trial work. There Is no doubt that
more and more uses will be found to
relieve the burden of storage. There
are some scientists who claim that
the by-products to be found in the
waste can become the most valuable
boon to man from atomic energy.
So far, I have been dealing mainly
with ways of obtaining power from the
atom to create electricity because
abundant and cheap power will
provide one of the most significant
ways of improving living standards and
reducing tension between nations.
There are, however, many other ways
in which discoveries and techniques
arising from nuclear energy are being
applied for the well-being of the world.
Radioactive materials and devices
linked with them have brought about
notable advances in medical research
and treatment, are assisting in conserv¬
ing and increasing food supplies, are
helping to improve industrial efficiency,
and are contributing to progress in
many branches of science.
This means that in many walks of
life workers are handling such mater¬
ials daily and that many more will
do so in the future. The fact that this
can happen without adding consider¬
ably to the risks of life is due to the
immense amount of research under¬
taken before any project is started and
to the intensive restrictions imposed
by governments and all the authorities
working under them.
Sometimes this super caution is
Irksome to nuclear specialists, who
feel that they have to overcome bigger
obstacles than those engaged in other
industries. There is no doubt that the
development of many promising ideas
is slowed down for this very reason.
Nevertheless, the caution demonstrat¬
ed has had Its effect in proving that
the safety both of populations and of
individuals overrides all other consider¬
ations.
It is for this reason that confidence
will grow and that atomic energy will
steadily expand its role of contributing
to the peace, health and prosperity
desired by the peoples of the world.

The nations
harness the atom
Nuclear power on the high seas
Italy, the Federal Republic of Germany and Japan are
joining the U.S.A. and the U.S.S.R. as nuclear shipbuilders.
The National Nuclear Energy Commission of Italy and the
Italian Navy are building an 18,000 ton merchant vessel
equipped with an 80 MW experimental reactor. At Kiel,
the German bulk carrier, "Otto Hahn" will soon have its
advanced pressure-water reactor installed, and Japan's first
nuclear ship is now being designed. The Japanese expect
that in the next decade, 30-knot nuclear-powered "container"
ships and 500,000 ton nuclear-powered tankers will be
competitive with conventional ships.
Navigational warning devices flashing light beacons
and foghorn on this oil and gas drilling rig in the Gulf
of Mexico are powered by electricity from a nuclear
generator installed 40 feet below the water line.
Inherent reliability of the radioactive heat source (in this
case strontium titanate atoms) and absence of moving
parts to convert heat to electricity makes the system
almost foolproof.
The cup that cheers
The "tracer technique" (when radioisotopes, emitting
detectable radiation, are followed through a process) has
helped improve Soviet beer production. Brewers have
found the lifetime of latic acid bacteria which has allowed
them to reduce the fermentation process from five or six
days to one and a half days. The beer's quality has also
been improved. Different results in British research into
whisky may be bad news for illegal manufacturers. New
techniques can establish a dating method for certains spirits
and can be used to detect illicit stills. Radioactive carbon
in the atmosphere, as a result of its movement through
barley into whisky, can also be measured.
Dating by nuclear tracks
The age of minerals can be found from marks made on
crystals by the natural fission of uranium and thorium
isotopes. Now scientists have found other tracks, made
as a result of normal decay of the elements, which lead
to much greater dating accuracy. In normal decay, an atom
ejects an alpha particle. After throwing out the alpha
particle, the nucleus recoils like a gun firing a shot, and
the recoil atom also makes marks (known as nuclear tracks).
This discovery seems to have improved dating methods by
about three thousand times.
Nuclear medicine in New Zealand
New Zealand appears to have the highest density, in
relation to population, of therapeutic nuclear medical
facilities in the world.
Needles explore for oil
One way of finding oil-bearing geologic formations is to
lower radioactive needles into the ground or into test wells
and measure the changes in their radiation as they pass
through various types of rock. A geologist records the
amount of radiation at several places and draws a "profile"
of the underlying layers of earth. This profile tells him
if drilling would be justified.
Radioisotopes vs. malaria
The Arab countries, in their fight to control mosquito
vectors of malaria, are using radioisotope tracing to check
the flight range, longevity and mortality of mosquitos. The
same technique has been used to study other harmful pests,
like grasshoppers (see article, page 18).
Engine wear and friction
Using radioisotope tracers, Soviet scientists have studied
how dust contributes to wearing out tractor engines.
Studies show that dust particles whose average diameter
is 10-20 millionths of a centimetre cause most wear.
Unesco Courier atom-inspected?
The Unesco Courier like most paper products was
probably atom inspected. For several years, isotope gauges
have been used to "feel" the thickness of paper while it is
rolled out by machines at high speed. As the paper passes

detector, the amount of radiation reaching the detector
varies according to the thickness and density of the paper
that separates it from the radiation source.
Nuclear-powered Northern Lights
Most of Sweden's additional power production in the
1970s and 1980s will come from nuclear plants. Nuclear
power production is expected to increase over seven-fold
between 1975 and 1985: by the late 1970s, at least one
new nuclear-powered unit will be added to the Swedish
power grid annually. In addition, combined production of
heat and electricity, based on nuclear power, may be
carried out in some major cities.
Isotopes on Mars
Radioisotopic tracers may help to find life on Mars.
The American Project Gulliver's space scientists propose an
unmanned device that will land on Mars, shoot out a string
covered with silicone grease, and then pull it back. The
retrieved string, covered with Martian soil, will be soaked
in a culture broth containing radioactive carbon. If bacterial
life is present in the soil, radioactive carbon dioxide gas
will be given off and automatically measured by a radiation
counter. From the counting rate sent to Earth by radio,
scientists will be able to tell whether there is life on Mars
and, if so, something about the kind of life.
Improved wood
Wood may be made harder and therefore more useful
by soaking it in a simple chemical and irradiating the soaked
piece so that the chemical molecules combine between
the wood fibres to make a plastic. The beauty of the wood
is unchanged.
Radioactive beads slow down cancer
Cancer is the runaway growth of cells. The secretions
of the pituitary gland stimulate cell reproduction so surgeons
sometimes remove the gland to slow down growth of a
tumour. Now, tiny yttrium-90 oxide beads, glasslike in
nature, can be implanted directly in the gland with much
less difficulty and risk. The beads destroy the gland with
little damage to its surroundings because yttrium-90 emits
beta rays whose penetrating power is limited to the
immediate area of the implant.
Gamma beam weight machine
In the U.S.S.R., a device has been perfected that
measures the weight of a heavy mass without coming into
contact with it. Operating on the principle that the ability
of material to absorb gamma rays depends on its density
and thickness, such devices have been used to determine
the weight of a loaded, moving train. A gamma source
(cobalt-60) is placed under the railway track and a
scintillation counter above. The gamma beam passing
between source and counter diminishes in intensity, as
the train passes through it, in relation to the weight of the
train's load. The readings are taken and converted
automatically into units of weight.
Labelling oil
Oil is commonly shipped long distances through pipelines.
Several companies often use the same pipeline, just as
ranchers used the same range for their herds. As ranchers
brand their cattle, oilmen use radioisotopes to mark different
oil batches. For example, some of the isotopes precede
company A's oil, and another tracer is carried ahead of
company B's shipment. A radiation monitor detects the
radioisotopes at the distribution point with the result that
A's oil is routed into tank A and B's products into tank B.
Radioactive dirt improves soap
Soap and detergent manufacturers want to know how
effectively their products remove dirt from soiled clothes.
Some manufacturers test new soaps by using them to wash
radioactive "dirt" from clothes; the resultant dirty water
is examined with instruments to measure the number of
radioisotopes that have been removed.

Fresh water through atomic power
A U.N. survey states that about 20 water-short areas in
the world need desalting plants, and 41 others may soon
need them. Nuclear power is already playing an important
part in alleviating this problem. The first Soviet nuclear
power station capable of desalinating 120,000 cubic metres
of sea water a day is under construction at Shevchenko
on the Caspian Sea; the United States is planning a large
electricity-desalination plant near Los Angeles (see article,
page 42) the United Arab Republic is interested in in¬
stalling a nuclear power-desalination plant near the Mediter¬
ranean; Israel is studying the possibilities of a plant to
produce 100 million gallons of water a day and 200 MV
of electricity.

It is possible that Napoleon's death was due to arsenic.
After neutron irradiation analysis of a hair from the French
Emperor's head, scientists have concluded that he had
been given arsenic in large quantities. Neutron Irradiation
of the hair changed some of its atoms to radioactive
isotopes in which elements of arsenic were found.

Director-General
of Unesco
IOR several years now, the
flood-tide of youth has risen irresis¬
tibly, and youth has won an increas¬
ingly important position in society.
Youth represents more than one-third
of the total world population in some
countries nearly half the population
and the role of young people is mount¬
ing because of the increasing call
made upon them by our technological
civilization with its steady demand for
adaptation and inventiveness. Yet the
gulf separating young people from
adults seems to be growing bigger
every day.
SYMBOL OF
INTERNATIONAL YEAR
FOR HUMAN RIGHTS
The design above is the work of
Victor Vasarely and was
commissioned by the International
Association of Art to commemorate
the current International Year for
Human Rights. It has been officially
adopted by the Association (an
organization created and supported
by Unesco) and its member
organizations in 57 countries. The
International Association of Art has
called on artists everywhere to
support world efforts to give force
to the principles adopted 20 years
ago in the Universal Declaration
of Human Rights.
'UNESCO SHOULD BECOME
THE ORGANIZATION FOR YOUTH'
A poignant appeal that the problems of youth cannot be ignored in the
world today, was made on June 24 by René Maheu, Director-General
of Unesco, in a special address to Unesco's European National Commis¬
sions gathered at a regional conference in Monaco. "Unesco should
become the organization for youth," Mr. Maheu declared, "where young
people can put their questions freelyall their questionswithin the
framework of the world perspective." We publish below all the passages
from this address which bear on youth.
Adults were at first surprised, some¬
times amused, and often shocked, by
the tendencies of some young people
to escapist or even withdrawal behav¬
iour, as manifested in the vogue for
certain types of songs, fashions in
clothes and hairstyles, sexual freedom
and, more seriously, the taking of
drugs.
, Just as they were beginning to resign
themselves to these " differences",
adults have again been caught off
guard this time by the revolts which
have struck the most venerable institu¬
tions of society and the strongest of
governments. And the ultimate paradox
is that these revolts have been sparked
by university students who, one would
have thought, had the strongest rea¬
sons to be satisfied with the established
order, since the most promising
careers lay ahead of them.
This revolt is sweeping across vir¬
tually every part of the world, but it
is particularly striking in Europe where,
in many countries, it has taken on the
form of an open dispute, not only with
the university but with society as a
whole.
The situation is very grave. A
society rejected by youth is by defini¬
tion a society without a future, and
therefore condemned, regardless of
the force of authority or constraint that
nrray temporarily be brought to bear on
the protests and aspirations of youth,
by the pride, fears and the interests of
adults already established in life. In
my view, we are now witnessing the
rejection of a certain type of society,
or indeed a certain type of civilization.
It is not, as is often said, just a
matter of giving youth an ideal. For
the most part, young people already
have their own ¡deal. Even if it
is confused and often expressed in a
naive way, this ideal is eminently wor¬
thy, it consists of an idea a dream if
you will of human relations without
violence and without deception.
In contrast to this ideal, the kind of
society we are preparing to bequeath
to them fills them with horror on many
counts (even if it can satisfy their
immediate wishes as no previous
society has) because it profoundly
shocks their demands for justice and
peace. To them it seems to be the
adults who are lacking in ideals.
I believe that this situation confronts
Unesco with a major duty and a unique
opportunity to carry out, with new
vigour and on a wider scale, the ethical
activities which make up its essential
role. In this year, 1968, Unesco must
approach young people as ten years
ago it approached the less-developed
world, with the same openness of heart
and mind. By this I don't mean the
strengthening of just those activities
in Unesco's programme of direct inter¬
est to youth. What I have in mind is
a total change in the whole orientation
of Unesco, affecting the nature and
activities and the methods of our orga¬
nization.
I recall the fundamental change that
took place in Unesco ten years ago
with the mass entry into the organiza¬
tion of the developing countries, which
had just acceded to independence.
Whereas Unesco's work had until
then been almost exclusively con¬
cerned with promoting intellectual co¬
operation between developed countries,
almost overnight, it was converted into
a field operation organization for help¬
ing the under-privileged nations of the
world. These countries quickly found
in Unesco a true understanding and a
dynamic, positive friendship that has
continued with unfailing vigour. For
their part, the developing countries
have shown full confidence in Unesco,
and that confidence has likewise never
wavered, and gave Unesco a new
humanistic dimension as well as
accrued possibilities of action.
A similar change in our thinking and
structure is needed today this time,
deeper and more radical than before.
Unesco should become the organiza¬
tion for youth, the organization where
young people should be able to put
their questions freely all their ques¬
tions in the worldwide perspective;
where they can give form to their
dreams by seeking their contribution
to human co-operation and where they
can bring to bear all their fervour and
the limitless fountain of their skills and
ideas on behalf of disinterested action
for peace.
This is my fervent wish, and the *
appeal I make today, with my mind u/
assailed by anxiety but my heart filled
with hope.

NATIONS HARNESS THE ATOM (Continued from page 46)
48
Better crops through radiation
In 1967, the IAEA and FAO were testing wheat mutants
in 12 countries and started studies in Africa and Latin
America to increase the resistance of wheat to diseases.
A mutant rice, produced by radiation is being put on sale
in Japan. It has a larger yield, a stronger straw and a
better response to fertilizers than existing varieties. In
North Africa and the Middle East, mutant wheats produced
by radiation give higher yields than local or common
varieties. In the Soviet Union, radiation has increased
cabbage crops by 5 to 10 per cent, cucumbers by 15 to
30 per cent, tomatoes by 10 to 15 per cent, carrots by 25 to
30 per cent and radishes by 6 to 11 per cent.
Krypton against smog
Krypton, a radioactive form of inert gas, has been pressed
into service in the battle against smog. In one type of smog
alarm', krypton is "caged" in a crystalline chemical. When
sulphur dioxide, a notorious air pollutant, enters the alarm
device, krypton is released through chemical action. It is
then scanned by a Geiger counter and the number of
radioactive disintegrations recorded show how much
sulphur dioxyde air pollutant displaced the krypton.
Latin America peaceful progress
All atomic work in Latin America is devoted to peaceful
uses, much of it in direct collaboration with the International
Atomic Energy Agency. Argentina, Brazil, Colombia
and Venezuela are operating, and Mexico and Uruguay
are constructing, research reactors; Brazil is working
to improve rice and Argentina is using nuclear radiation
in wheat experimentsboth studies linked with FAO/IAEA
programmes; Costa Rica, El Salvador, Guatemala, Honduras,
Mexico, Nicaragua and Panama are working with the IAEA
and FAO to eradicate the Mediterranean fruit fly; Mexico,
Venezuela, Argentina and Brazil have set up radioisotope
production centres; Guatemala is developing industrial
gamma radiography; a radiological protection service has
been started in Chile; Cuba is establishing a film badge and
dosimetry service for hospitals; investigations of ground
water resources are being made in Chile, Brazil, Uruguay
and Ecuador; Mexico and U.S.A. are examining a nuclear
power-desalination project to serve parts of both countries.
British nuclear electricity
Nuclear power stations in Britain will be able to generate
some 15 per cent of the country's electricity when the
Oldbury station becomes operational later this year.
Britain, a nuclear power plant pioneer, operated its first
station at Calder Hall in 1956. In the next decade, it built
24 nuclear stations whose total capacity exceeded the
combined output of all other riuclear plants in the world.
Earthquake barometer
Geophysicists at the Seismology Institute at Uzbek,
Turkestan, have found a way to forecast earthquakes.
Radioactive radon, one of the heaviest gases known, filters
slowly and steadily upward from beneath the earth's crust,
but its journey is suddenly accelerated if there are sub¬
terranean rock disturbances. Scientists have measured
the radon content of the water in an artesian well,
2,000 metres deep, and when it changed, they could foresee
local earthquakes 15 to 20 hours in advance and get an
idea of their severity.
A SCIENCE OF PEACE
FOR THE ATOMIC AGE
"We can make better and better preparations for war,
our technical progress having given birth to titanic weapons,
but we cannot prepare for peace any better now than in
the age of bows and arrows." These words of Professor
Gaston Bouthoul, of the French Institute of Polemology,
state with sharp clarity why a science of peace is urgently
needed today when the warlike uses of the atom could
destroy civilization.
This science of peace, Peace Research, exists and is
being carried on in many countries of the world. It is still
very young, still somewhat unformed, still woefully under¬
manned and underfunded by comparison with the world's
expenditures of thousands» of millions of dollars annually on
arms research and with the fact that 18 per cent of all the
scientists who ever lived are today at work on arms research1.
It is nonetheless a rapidly growing field of study, a glint of
hope for the future establishment of a stable and permanent
peace.
The latest number of Impact of Science on Society,
Unesco's quarterly which examines the social consequences
of science, is devoted in full to the theme The Scientific
Basis of Peace.
This Impact number brings out why Peace Research is so
fundamental: because treating war and peace as purely
political matters, as is generally done, has resulted in but
limited success in containing wars. Any small war could
be the accidental trigger for nuclear war, because statesmen
and diplomats, the engineers of peace, who strive to pre¬
serve the present fragile structure of peace and eventually
to erect a strong structure, have less basic sound know¬
ledge available to them about the factors involved in war
and peace than have engineers who design buildings and
highways.
in the keynote article, "Peace Research, the Science of
Survival", Professor Bert V.A. Röling, of the University of
Groningen, Netherlands, broadly describes this vitally
important young science and the vast array of subjects it
studies: man himself, the role of the press and of prejudice,
national societies, the international system and the structure
of a stable peace, among a whole host of others.
"Why Is Man Aggressive?" is discussed in a round-table
article by seven British biological and social scientists and
Professor Bouthoul. Is man aggressive by nature? Most of
the Round Table participants say "yes". Mr. Philip Noel-
Baker, Nobel Peace Prize 1959, says. "no". Other factors
that exacerbate aggressiveness such as overpopulation,
the use of language, social deprivation are discussed and
parallels are made with behaviour in animal societies.
In still other articles, Professor Kenneth E. Boulding, of
the University of Colorado, proposes a "Data-Collecting
Network for the Sociosphere", to provide accurate informa¬
tion about the world social, economic and political climate
to national leaders to minimize the miscalculations that can
lead to war; Professor Bouthoul, "Polemology and the
Solution of Conflicts", discusses the scientific objective
study of war (in Greek, "polemos"); Professor Anatol Rapo-
port, of the University of Michigan, shows how "The Appli¬
cation of Game Theory to Peace Research", by dispassion¬
ately and logically showing how war is always an "unpro¬
fitable" activity, in terms of gains and losses, can eventually
help undermine the present legitimacy of war as an instru¬
ment of national policy; and Professor Ignacy Sachs, of the
Peace Research Committee of the Polish Academy of
Sciences, examines "Ethnocentrism Source and Aggravat¬
ing Factor of Conflicts".
(1) This statement is based on the knowledge that 90
per cent of all scientists who ever lived are alive today,
and of these, 20 per cent are at work on arms research

FROM THE UNESCO NEWSROOM...
Europe's poisoned rivers
Europe's lakes and rivers are being
increasingly polluted by dumping of sewage,
detergents, pesticides, metals, phenols,
ammonia, and other chemical and industrial
wastes, reports FAO. Loss of oxygen from
man-made and natural causes and "ageing"
of lakes and ponds through silting and
plant invasion are contributing factors. A
symposium on how these, problems affect
European fisheries will be organized in
1970 by FAO's European Inland Fisheries
Advisory Commission.
Food coins
A series of coins supporting the work
of FAO are being Issued this year by over
20 countries. This is the first time that a
group of nations have used their coinage
as an educational means for raising agri¬
cultural production. India, Nepal, Uganda
and the Republic of Vietnam plan to issue
coins on October 16, the 23rd anniversary
of FAO's foundation. FAO will sell special
sets of the coins and devote proceeds to
regional projects for farm credit.
"THE NUCLEAR
CHALLENGE"
an IAEA film
A 40-minute colour film showing the
increasing use and effects of peace¬
ful atomic energy, and the Interna¬
tional Atomic Energy Agency's role
in promoting its worldwide develop¬
ment, has been available since last
year in English, French, Spanish and
Russian versions. The film was pro¬
duced by the International Atomic
Energy Agency with Kratky Film,
Prague (Czechoslovakia). The En¬
glish version is narrated by Peter
Ustinov. Special attention is foc-
cussed on work in agriculture, medi¬
cine, industry, hydrology, research
and the immense possibilities of nu¬
clear power systems. The film
(16 mm) costs $150.00 U.S. (or equi¬
valent). For further information

In one piece again
Three very different works of art which
had one thing in common were recently
.exhibited at Unesco. They had all pre¬
viously been dismembered. Now, through
the co-operation of different museums, they
have been reconstituted and can be seen
Joy the public as they were originally
conceived by their authors. A unique
16th-century carpet was cut in two in
Poland to fit the altar steps in Cracow
Cathedral, and the, unused part sold in
Paris. One half belongs to the Museum of
the Royal Castle of Wawel in Cracow, the
other, to the Museum of Decorative Arts in
Paris. A 14th-century polyptych by Paolo
Veneziano was dismembered in 1863, but
was reconstituted by the Louvre in 1956
from panels in the Ajaccio and Toulouse
museums. One half of the pen and ink
drawing, "The Battle of Bergen" by Willem
Van de Velde the elder, was acquired by
the Greenwich Museum (U.K.), which in
1958 presented it to the owner of the other
half, the Rijksmuseum in Amsterdam.
More meat on the menu
A sharp rise in meat eating has been
noted in many countries. The U.S.S.R.
increased its meat production and consump¬
tion by about 95 per cent In the 1950s and
early 1960s, reports FAO. Meat eating
in Eastern Europe rose by 65 per cent, in
Western Europe by 84 per cent and in
North America by 44 per cent. But meat
consumption per person in the developing
countries has not improved because pro¬
duction can hardly keep pace with popu¬
lation growth.
Water, water everywhere...
Canada recently marked its participation
in the International Hydrological Decade by
issuing a five-cent commemorative stamp.
Canada has about one-seventh of the
world's fresh water in her lakes and one-
tenth in her rivers, but fully one-half flows
north and is not available to 90 per cent
of the population. Over 97 countries have
joined in the Hydrological Decade, a pro¬
gramme co-ordinated by Unesco to study
the world's water resources and their
management.
U.A.R. centre for exchange
of publications
The United Arab Republic, recently inaug¬
urated a Centre for the Exchange of
Publications. The Centre, at 27 Abdel
Kalek Sarwat St, Cairo, is supervised by
the National Library (U.A.R. Ministry of
Culture).
Flashes...
A carving of a man's head, found
recently in Afghanistan, is the oldest known
sculpture in Asia. It has been radiocar¬
bon-dated at 20,000 B.C.
The first U.N. Conference on the Ex¬
ploration and Peaceful Uses of Outer
Space is being held in Vienna from
August 14 to 27.
WHO, has so far tested 1,249 new
insecticides in its continuing fight against
insect-borne diseases.
An "early-warning" system to speed up
action to meet food shortages is being set
up by FAO and the World Food Programme.
46 new radio stations are being opened
in Spain this year.

Letters to the Editor
WORLD CHARTER
ON HUMAN RIGHTS
Sir,
After reading your remarkable Issue
on International Year for Human
Rights (January 1968), I would like to
know: 1) Which nations approved and
adopted the Universal Declaration of
Human Rights? 2) Which nations
abstained? 3) Which nations, having
adopted the Declaration, also apply
it in practice?
C.J. Grandin
Saint-Martin-de-la-Place, France
48 nations voted in favour of the
Universal Declaration: Burma, Cana¬
da, Chile, Republic of China, Colom¬
bia, Costa Rica, Cuba, Denmark,
Dominican Republic, Ecuador, Egypt,
El Salvador, Ethiopia, France, Greece,
Guatemala, Haiti, Iceland, India, Iran,
Iraq, Lebanon, Liberia, Luxembourg,
Mexico, Netherlands, New Zealand,
Nicaragua, Norway, Pakistan, Panama,
Paraguay, Peru, Philippines, Thailand,
Sweden, Syria, Turkey, U.K., U.S.A.,
Uruguay, Venezuela, Afghanistan,
Argentina, Australia, Belgium, Bolivia,
Brazil.
Eight nations abstained : Byelorus¬
sian S.S.R., Czechoslovakia, Poland,
Saudi Arabia, Ukrainian S.S.R., Union
of South Africa, U.S.S.R., Yugoslavia.
Two nations were absent: Hon¬
duras and Yemen.
As our January 1968 issue on Hu¬
man Rights pointed out, no country
can pride itself on having completely
fulfilled all the Articles of the Decla¬
ration Editor.
WHAT WAR MEANS TODAY
Sir,
Bravo for publishing "The World
We Hope For", Maria Cristina Costa
Diaz's prize-winning essay (Feb. 1968),
and congratulations on all your issues,
notably those on Apartheid, nuclear
perils and the present arms race. All
countries, particularly the industrially-
developed, would do well to devote a
few hours of their radio and television
every month to programmes that bring
home the meaning of nuclear warfare.
And why not set up a special fund
administered by Unesco to provide a
free, world-wide distribution of book¬
lets on the terrible dangers of atomic
conflict. An immense effort will be
needed to shake people from their
present apathy.

'SUBJECTIVE' ARTS
50
'OBJECTIVE' SCIENCE
Sir,
In "Science and the Culture of our
Times" by Lawrence Gould (Feb. 1968).
which, at first sight, appears to be a
useful modern commentary, there are
à number of misleading statements
which detract from its value and indi¬
cate confusion of thought on the
subject.
Whilst not subscribing to the alleged
dualism between facts and human
values, I cannot agree that the postu¬
lates of faith in a religion and hypo¬
theses and theories in science are
analogous. The essence of a religion
is belief in a supernatural being; only
pure faith is required to appreciate
this abstraction. In science, however,
hypotheses and theories are but inter¬
mediate stages between the evaluation
of factual observations and the appli¬
cation of this knowledge. To say that
hypotheses are assumed as a matter
of faith is to completely misunderstand
scientific procedure.
Moreover, no thinking person can
consider that exploration and under¬
standing by the poet, or by any other
type of artist, is similar to that of the
scientist. The specific contribution of
the artist lies in expressing his feel¬
ings about abstract things, in addition
to describing his reaction to material
things. In this work he embodies all
this feeling, and poses many ques¬
tions, but he never answers them.
This is quite different from the work
of the scientist.
Finally, the attempt to merge subjec¬
tive opinions with objective observa¬
tions is quite, misleading. In the
humanistic studies, mostly abstract
values are being considered, and the
statements concerned about them are
largely those of preferences. In scien¬
tific work, however, the basis is that
of measurement and the observation
of processes. Obviously no experi¬
ence can be impersonal, but the two
disciplines under discussion are en¬
tirely different, and as the human
brain finds it necessary to simplify
knowledge by classification, the terms
"subjective" and "objective" are quite
acceptable.

'WHITE' ACHIEVEMENTS
IGNORED
Sir,
I shall not renew the subscription
to your magazine which I took out for
my daughter. In 1967 most of your
issues were biased in many ways in
favour of the developing countries,
one example being that colonialism
should be driven out or suppressed
wherever it exists. The negative
aspects of colonialism were dealt
with, but the positive achievements of
the "whites" in Africa and elsewhere
were systematically disregarded. Many
readers have already expressed
their views on the issue dealing with
South Africa and Apartheid. As I
am opposed to the ideas it presented
I have decided to terminate my
subscription. In my view, articles of
that kind, inspired by hatred and
incomprehension, are not likely to
promote the spread of international
understanding.

POETRY OF LIGHT
AND SHADOWS
Sir,
Long-standing readers of your maga¬
zine, we admired the, Dec. 1967 issue
on "Two Great Epics of Asia". We
were particularly struck by the truly
remarkable photographs of shadow
theatre performances in Cambodia
taken by Luc Ionesco.
Muriel Latscha
Paris, France
TWO GREAT EPICS OF ASIA
Sir,
Congratulations for your issue of
December 1967 with its outstanding
articles on the Mahabharata and the
Ramayana, and on India and South
East Asia, their history, traditions, art
and peoples. It was indeed a window
open on that vast region of the world.
Why not do the same for Africa and
America in future issues.
Francisco Ghisolfo A.
Viña del Mar, Chile
Sir,
Our faculty has a subscription to
the "Unesco Courier" but the Decem¬
ber 1967 issue was so excellent that
I would like to order six copies. My
class in Eastern Literature is now
reading selections of the Ramayana
and the Mahabharata and I would like
these students to have access to
several copies of the December issue.
Sister Marie Pierre
Marian College, Indianapolis, U.S.A.
THE COLOMBO PLAN
Sir,
The article on the Mekong River
development project (Feb. 1968) des¬
cribes the Colombo Plan as "The Bri¬
tish Commonwealth's scheme for
aiding its member countries in South-
East Asia".
Although it true that the Colombo
plan stems from British Commonwealth
countries, the initial members being
the United Kingdom, India, Pakistan,
Ceylon, Australia, and New Zealand,
it was soon expanded to include the
United States, Afghanistan, Burma,
Bhutan, Cambodia, Indonesia, Japan,
the Republic of Korea, Laos, Malay¬
sia, The Maldives, Nepal, North Bor¬
neo, the Philippines, Sarawak, Singa¬
pore, Thailand, and the Republic of
Vietnam. The author himself has
indicated that the Plan is wider than
the British Commonwealth by referring
to the aid given to one of the member
countries the Republic of Vietnam.

NUCLEAR
CLOCKS
FOR DATING
THE PAST
Photo © Paul Almasy. Paris
This prehistoric monster, 3 metres long, its back covered with a rigid carapace, is the
glyptodon which became extinct during the last glacial period on earth, between 100,000
and 1,000,000 years ago. Resembling the present-day armadillo, of which they are a
distant ancestor, glyptodons were to be found in many parts of the Americas. This
one was dug up in Argentina. The recent development of techniques based on radio¬
active phenomena has provided science with a number of nuclear clocks for measuring
geological time. Radioactive substances such as potassium-argon, rubidium-strontium
and uranium are used to date rocks, minerals and human and animal fossil remains in
geological strata (see page 26). A clock with a shorter life, the now famous carbon-14,
has become the mainstay of archaeology and geology for studies of events up to
50,000 years ago. It also has wide applications in climatology, ecology and geography
(see article page 22).
