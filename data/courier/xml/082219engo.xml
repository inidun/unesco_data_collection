Two months ago the Unesco Courier devoted a
special issue to Australia, a young nation celebrating
its bicentennial. This issue is given over to a country
which is heir to one ofthe world's oldest
civilizations.
The second mostpopulous nation on Earth, India
is a vast and multifarious land which encompasses
desert andfertile soil, the towering Himalayas and
tropical lowlands, mighty rivers, great cities and
villages without number. Over 800 million
people perhaps one sixth ofhumanity speak
some 180 languages including 14 major ones.
For many readers India will evoke images of
ancient customs and omnipresent religions: Hindus
bathing en masse in a sacred river, ascetic holy men
praying by the roadside, caparisoned elephants
joining in templefestivals, villages where the gods
are worshipped asfamiliars. But side by side with
these timeless scenes a modern India is growing.
Industrialization has made great strides in a country
which today manufactures her own cars and has her
own steel mills, fertilizerplants, atomicpower
stations and heavy engineering industry. To sustain
her economic development she has one ofthe
world's largest networks ofscientists and
technicians. Yet today, like many nations, India
faces difficultproblems, especially perhaps the risk
that the benefitsfrom her considerable economic
achievements in industry andfoodproduction will
be spread more and more thinly because of
demographicgrowth thepopulation is estimated
to have increased by 18 million in 1986 alone.
In thefour decades since Independence India has
made unsparing efforts to improve living standards
and become a modern democratic nation while
preserving her linguistic, cultural and ethnic wealth
and diversity. Within the limited editorial space at
our disposal, this issue attempts to reflect the many
facets ofthis situation and bring to readers a glimpse
ofwhat is happening in this vast and dynamic
subcontinent.

5,000 YEARS OF
INDIAN CULTURE
BY VISHWANATH S. NARAVANE
THE development of Indian cul¬
ture can be compared to the
progress of a river from its
Himalayan home, through forests and
wastelands, orchards and farms, villages
and cities. The river assimilates the waters
of many tributaries, its environment
changes, yet it remains the same. Indian
culture shows a similar combination of
unity and diversity, continuity and
change. In the course of her long histo¬
ry, India has witnessed many changes,
made many adjustments, and assimilated
elements from many sources, without
breaking the continuity.
India is a land of varied landscapes and
climates, of many races, religions, lan¬
guages and cultures. But they all have an
unmistakably Indian flavour. The source
of this unity is elusive. It can be felt, but
it defies analysis. In his famous book, Dis¬
covery ofIndia, Jawaharlal Nehru gave a
sensitive and fascinating account of his
search for the unity at the root of India's
amazing diversity.
The Indus Valley civilization
(3000-1800 BC) shows anticipations of
ideas and art-forms later regarded as typi¬
cally Indian. This is clear from the ar¬
tefacts yielded during excavations at
Harappa and Mohenjodaro. A statue of
a man in meditation suggests the practice
of Yoga. The smooth surfaces of a male
torso in stone suggests, by its absence of
muscular tension, the classical Indian con¬
cept of inward energy. A deity depicted
on a clay seal is very similar to some later
images of Shiva. And a little copper
dancing-girl wears bangles of a kind that
can be purchased today at a wayside
bazaar in India. Recent research has
shown that the influence of this culture

the Ganges in the Himalayas, is an important

extended to distant regions of northern
and western India, and that the Indus Val¬
ley people had close contacts with the
Dravidian civilization which flourished in
southern India long before the coming of
the Aryans.
Some time between 2000 and 1600
BC, a branch of the vast Aryan family,
usually referred to as Indo-Aryans,
migrated to India. They brought with
them the Sanskrit language, and a religion
based on sacrificial ritual honouring dei¬
ties symbolizing elemental forces of Na¬
ture, such as Indra, god of rain and
thunder, Agni (Fire) and Varuna, lord of
the seas, rivers and seasons. Hymns ad¬
dressed to these and other deities were
collected in the four Vedas. The oldest of
the Vedas is the Rigveda (1500-1200 BC)
in which there is a quest for the Supreme
Reality underlying all multiplicity. This
trend was strengthened in the dialogues
of the Upanishads (900-600 BC). Vedic
poetry is marked by lofty ideas, literary
beauty and a movement from external
ritual to inward experience.
Two religions outside the Vedic tra¬
dition emerged in the sixth century BC.
The Buddha's personality, and his emp.ha-
sis on love, compassion and harmony,
profoundly influenced Indian thought
and culture, though Buddhism as an or¬
ganized religion struck deeper roots out¬
side India. Jainism, founded by Mahavira,
stressed truth and non-violence, and made
significant contributions to Indian art and
philosophy.
In 326 BC, Alexander of Macedón
crossed the Indus and won a decisive bat¬
tle. Although he soon turned back, his
invasion influenced Indian culture by in¬
itiating contacts with the Graeco-Roman
world. Six years later, Chandragupta
Maurya tried to unite the scattered
kingdoms and republics of India in a cen¬
tralized empire, with the capital at
Pataliputra (modern Patna in Bihar). His
grandson, Ashoka (reigned 273-237 BC),
recoiling from the horrors of war, be¬
came an ardent Buddhist. The message of
compassion and gentleness was inscribed
on rocks and highly polished stone
columns. The capitals surmounting the
columns are fine pieces of sculpture.
Kings of the Shunga dynasty (185-149
BC) were orthodox Hindus, but there
was a strong Buddhist revival under
Kanishka, the Kushan king who ruled in
north-western India (78-101 AD). The
Gandhara style of Buddhist sculpture,

strongly influenced by Graeco-Roman
art, developed under the Kushans.
Another centre of Buddhist art was
Mathura (south of Delhi).
Pataliputra again became the centre of
political and cultural activity during the
Gupta Empire (319-540 AD), which has
been described as the golden age of
ancient Indian culture. Some of the
Gupta kings, such as Chandragupta and
Skandagupta, were poets and musicians.
Kalidasa, greatest among Sanskrit poets
and dramatists, lived during the reign of
Chandragupta. The Buddha images of
Sarnath, and the frescoes painted in the
caves of Ajanta in western India, are
among the artistic masterpieces of this
age. The decline of the Gupta Empire was
followed by political fragmentation. King
Harsha of Kannauj tried to stem this
process, but after his death in 648 AD in¬
dependent kingdoms arose in Kashmir,
Bengal, Orissa and many other regions of
southern as well as northern India.
Culturally, this was a very rich peri¬
od. The Cholas, Pallavas and Rashtraku-
tas of south India built the superb temples
at Tanjore, Mamallapuram and Ellora.
The Sun Temple of Konarak in Orissa
and the Shiva Temple at Khajuraho in
Central India were built in the eleventh
century. In all these temples, sculpture is
an integral part of the architecture. In
literature, Sanskrit was gradually being
replaced by regional languages such as
Bengali, Marathi, Hindi and Punjabi. In
the south, Tamil, Telugu and Kannada
had developed their literary traditions.
The Vedanta philosophies of Shankara
(eighth century) and Ramanuja (twelfth
century) exerted a deep influence. There

was, however, a conservative trend in so¬
cial and religious life. The caste system,
originally based on differences of apti¬
tude, became rigid and oppressive.
The establishment of Muslim rule at
the end of the twelfth century was a turn¬
ing point in India's cultural history. An
initial period of conflict was inevitable be¬
cause of the radical differences between
Hinduism and Islam. But a process of ac¬
commodation soon started. Sufi mysti¬
cism, philosophically close to Vedanta,
was one of the meeting points. Many
Muslim kings, at Delhi and in regional
kingdoms, were patrons of Indian litera¬
ture and music, and participated in Hin¬
du festivals. After the foundation of the
Mughal Empire (1526 AD) the trend
towards integration was strengthened.
Under the wise and tolerant rule of Ak-
bar (1556-1605) the foundation of a na¬
tional culture was firmly laid. The Hindu
and Muslim traditions, while retaining
their distinct identities, influenced each
other deeply.
Islamic architecture in India was at
first austere and simple. But the builders

development of the famous Gandhara school
of art. This Gandhara head dates back to the
Kushan period between AD 78 and 144.
soon started adopting decorative ele¬
ments, including the lotus motif, from
Hindu temples. Conversely, many tem¬
ples built in medieval India have Islamic
features, such as the dome, the arch and
screens carved of stone and marble. Indi¬
an architecture reached its apex during
the reign of Shah Jahan (1627-1658), who
built such masterpieces as the Pearl
Mosque at Agra and the Taj Mahal, "the
dream in -marble".
In painting, too, there was a blend of
the two traditions. Inspired by Bihzad
and other great Persian artists, painters
at the Mughal court created a new style
of miniature painting. Combining the
technique and subtlety of this style with
the religious and aesthetic spirit of India,
painters of the Rajput School made their
own distinctive contribution.
One of the greatest geniuses of
medieval India was Amir Khusrau: poet,
musician, linguist. He invented several in¬
struments played in classical Indian
music. His poetical experiments led to the
emergence of Urdu, one of the major
Indian languages. The sixteenth and
seventeenth centuries were exceptional¬
ly rich in devotional poetry in regional
languages. Nanak, the founder of
Sikhism, Tulsidas, whose Hindi version
of the Ramayana epic is recited and read
by millions even today, Kabir, whose
poetry transcended all sectarian
differencesthese and other saint-poets
preached a universal religion based on
tolerance and love.
The Mughal Empire declined rapidly
during the first quarter of the eighteenth
century. Meanwhile, Europeans were
making inroads into India: the Por¬
tuguese, the Dutch, the French, and final¬
ly the British who emerged victorious. By
the end of the eighteenth century, Brit¬
ish authority was firmly established. The
introduction of English education and the
work of Christian missionaries had a deep
impact on the cultural and religious life
of India. Calcutta, the new capital, be¬
came the centre of Western thought, fol¬
lowed by Bombay and Madras. Some
educated Indians, in their excessive zeal
for European culture, turned away from
their own heritage. But a reform move¬
ment, founded by Raja Ram Mohan Roy,

ushered in a spiritual and cultural renais¬
sance. The leaders of this movement,
known as the Brahmo Samaj, stressed the
deeper truths of Hindu and Muslim scrip¬
tures, while accepting progressive ele¬
ments from Western thought. Another
source of inspiration was Shri Rama-
krishna (1836-1886), who regarded differ¬
ent religions as paths leading to the same
goal, and his famous disciple, Swami
Vivekananda (1863-1902), who is remem¬
bered as India's first spiritual and cultur¬
al ambassador to Europe and America.
Though politically subjugated, Indian
culture retained its dynamism. In the lat¬
ter half of the nineteenth century, politi¬
cal, historical and social themes were
taken up by novelists and dramatists.
Ghalib, the great Urdu poet, and Bankim
Chatterji, the Bengali novelist, made rich
contributions to Indian literature. Out¬
standing musicians, many of whom were
Muslims, kept alive the tradition of clas¬
sical Indian music. The katbak school of
dance was developed at Lucknow and Jai¬
pur. Later, there was a renaissance in In¬
dian painting, initiated by Abaanin-
dranath Tagore and other artists of the

was gaining strength. The sense of patri¬
otism thus aroused was reflected in the
literature of that age. When Mahatma
Gandhi returned to India, after his heroic
struggle against racism in South Africa,
a new chapter was opened in India's life.

On 15 August 1947, India became an
independent nation. Thus, in Jawaharlal
Nehru's words, India had "kept her tryst
with destiny" after a century of struggle.
The partition of the country on the ba¬
sis of religion, the bloodshed that fol¬
lowed, and then the assassination of
Mahatma Gandhi, were painful shocks.
But the trauma was soon overcome and
India began building her future as a sover¬
eign country taking her rightful place in
the community of nations.
Since independence, India has made
significant progress in many areas of cul¬
ture. In almost all the fourteen major lan¬
guages of India (fifteen including English),
creative literature of the highest order has
been produced. Satyajit Ray is recognized
as one of the greatest film directors in the
world. In classical music, Ravi Shankar
and Ali Akbar Khan; in painting Jamini
Ray and M.F. Hussain; in classical dance,
Balasarasvatithese are only a few among
the outstanding artists who have enriched
Indian culture in recent decades.
Selectivity, assimilation and adjust¬
ment have characterized Indian culture
throughout its long history. It has con¬
fronted and overcome many periods of
crisis and uncertainty. Today there are
new challenges, demanding new adjust¬
ments. Ours is the age of science and tech¬
nology. How to preserve whatever is of
enduring worth in the spiritual and aes¬
thetic tradition that has stood the test of
fifty centuries, and how to reinterpret
that tradition in the contemporary con¬
text: that is the question which the
thinkers, artists and writers of India have
to deal with. Their ability to handle this
task in a balanced and imaginative man¬
ner will determine the future course of
Indian culture.

MAKERS OF
MODERN INDIA BY SARVEPALLI GOPAL
Mohandas K. Gandhi (1869-1948),
the architect of India's struggle for
independence through non-violent
disobedience to British rule.
MAHATMA Gandhi was the
foremost leader of the Indian
independence movement; and
one of his great qualities was to secure and
retain the devotion of persons of differ¬
ing temperaments but all of very great
distinction. Of these, three leading figures
were Jawaharlal Nehru, Sarvepalli Rad-
hakrishnan and Maulana Abul Kalam
Azad.
Educated in Britain, Nehru was drawn
to Gandhi because he felt that while
others talked Gandhi was primarily a
man of action who was making a dent on
British rule. Nehru accepted Gandhi's
method of non-violence, first as a useful
weapon against the British and then, af¬
ter the atom bombs of 1945, as a means
without an alternative. He saw the valid¬
ity of Marx's analysis of historical change
but did not believe that such change can
only be brought about by force. The class
war could not be denied but it could be
resolved by persuasion. In the freedom
movement, Nehru realized that, while
Gandhi had brought the peasants into the
political campaign, to retain their interest
and support the Indian National Con¬
gress should have an economic
programme. In this sense he is a pioneer
of modern, twentieth-century na¬
tionalism.
Once Gandhi had brought other class¬
es into the independence movement, it
became Nehru's task to hold the various
classes together by taking account of the
basic economic needs of the vast majori¬
ty of the Indian people. So Nehru
promised that, when freedom had been
won, the free government of India would
give priority to economic 'development
and the promotion of social justice. Even
before the departure of the British, Nehru
made the Indian people conscious of the
importance of planning.
Nehru's other great contribution to
the independence movement was that he
gave it an international perspective. He
saw that fascism, militarism and imperi
alism were partners and against them were
ranged popular and national movements
all over the world. So the independence
movement in India was part of a univer¬
sal struggle and its allies were the peoples
fighting for freedom and dignity in Eu¬
rope, Asia and Africa.
Nehru's policies as India's first prime
minister from 1947 till his death in 1964
continued to be influenced by these
ideals. An emphasis on civil liberties and
a search for a socialist pattern of society
inspired all his efforts within India, while
abroad he followed an active policy of
support for anti-colonialism and anti-
racism. He was particularly committed to
Africa which he regarded as India's neigh¬
bour. He supported the national move¬
ments in Kenya, Algeria, Ghana and
Nigeria and never compromised in his
resistance to apartheid. Above all he was
a supporter of the United Nations and its
agencies, sent Indian troops as part of
United Nations contingents to Gaza,
Suez and the Congo and worked to pro¬
mote total disarmament.

hakrishnan to the independence move-

ment was of a different order.
Imperialism damaged the identity of the
Indian people by assuming that Western
civilization was superior. In reply Rad-
hakrishnan turned to the sources and, in
his writings on Indian philosophy,
showed that the thought of his people
was second to none in logic and rational¬
ity. This enabled them to hold up their
heads. But Radhakrishnan did more. He
argued that philosophy was related to life
and, while interpreting Indian thinkers at
their best, also called on Indians to dis¬
card what was outmoded and to rid them¬
selves of obscurantism and superstition.
Their long and rich tradition had been ar¬
rested and required innovation and fur¬
ther evolution. Truth should not be
allowed to be smothered by the dead past.
The speculative and scientific thought of
the West should be incorporated into the
Indian heritage.
Moreover, by expounding Indian
thought in terms which related to the
Western tradition, Radhakrishnan made
Indian culture a part of world civilization.
He, like Nehru, accepted a nationalism
which was a brick in the structure of
internationalism and his philosophical
efforts were intended to build under¬
standing between East and West. A mem¬
ber before the Second World War of the
International Committee for Intellec¬
tual Co-operation, he was active in
Unesco from its foundation in 1945. He
was a member of Unesco's Executive
Board, served as its chairman, was elect¬
ed president of the General Conference
in 1952, and was associated with the
opening of Unesco's Paris Headquarters
in the Place de Fontenoy in 1958. To him
Unesco was, as he described it, "the
priesthood of the spirit".
Radhakrishnan's main activity, after
India became free, was to help in the
reconciliation of mankind on the basis of
the common ground among all the
religions of the world. He believed that
a global community was emerging and
that humanity should be educated to
recognize its purpose and destiny. Ap¬
pointed by Nehru as India's ambassador
to the Soviet Union, Radhakrishnan
stood nearly thirty years ago for negoti¬
ations and peaceful settlements between
the two sides in the cold war. In 1952 he
came back to India and for the next
fifteen years in Delhi, first as Vice-
President for ten years and then for five
years as President, he gave the lead in
Sarvepalli Radhakrishnan (1888-1975) was a
scholar and philosopher of international
repute, noted for his work on Hinduism.
improving the quality of life and promot¬
ing character. Even while holding these
high offices and carrying out his duty to
his own people, Radhakrishnan con¬
tinued to travel round the world, advocat¬
ing the emergence of a new civilization
based on the unity of mankind and
common truths of the spirit and animat¬
ed by a religion founded not on dogma
but on the deepening of the individual's
awareness and compassion for all fellow
beings.
If Radhakrishnan was by birth a Hin¬
du, Abul Kalam Azad was born in Mec¬
ca of pious Muslim parents; but they both
had a strong sense of religion based on
rationalism and the common values of all
humanity transcending creeds and
denominations. Fluent in Arabic and Per¬
sian and a scholar in Islamic studies, Azad
gave a broad and liberal interpretation of
the Qur'an. To him religion was a guide
to proper action and his scholarship led
him into public life. From 1912 his
primary objective was to draw the Mus¬
lims in India into the struggle for free¬
dom. A steadfast follower of Gandhi, he
was elected a number of times President
of the Indian National Congress and
suffered long terms of internment and im¬
prisonment. From 1920 political differ¬
ences between Hindu and Muslim
organizations increased; but the Congress
insisted that nationalism had no connec¬
tion with religion and the presence of
Maulana Azad in the ranks of the nation¬
alist leadership was the highest testimo¬
ny of this. Azad's pride in being an Indian
was strengthened by his commitment to
what he termed the Islamic spirit, and he
never accepted that a good Muslim could
not be a good Indian.
From 1947 till his death in 1958 he
served as India's first minister for educa¬
tion and was a key figure in the formula¬
tion of national policies in all fields. With
his belief that true religion brings all peo¬
ples together, Azad also took much in¬
terest in the promotion of international
understanding and was the president of
the General Conference of Unesco at its
session in Delhi in 1956.
SARVEPALLI GOPAL is Emeritus Professor of
Contemporary History at Jawaharlal Nehru
University, New Delhi, and a Fellow of St. Antony's
College, Oxford (UK). He was a member of the
Executive Board of Unesco from 1976 to 1980.

CLOSE-UP ON
INDIAN CINEMA BY KHALID MOHAMED
CINEMA in India is a ticket to a
world of fantasy, providing an
escape from the harsh reality of
everyday life. Three-quarters of a century
old, it is still eagerly wooing its faithful
audience with stories of virtuous people
battling against the odds and emerging
victorious. At various stages in its history,
Indian cinema has borrowed themes,
ideas and even entire plots from foreign
sources. It has always been heavily
influenced by Hollywood, and costume
Nargis and Raj Kapoor in Kapoor's Awaara

most creative periods in commercial film
making in India. Raj Kapoor and Nargis
became the golden couple of Indian films and
made several box office hits together.
epics, thrillers, love stories and family dra¬
mas from the United States have often
been refashioned to suit Indian taste,
which is demanding and virtually inflexi¬
ble. As a rule, every film must include at
least half a dozen songs and dances
(although in recent years the more adven¬
turous film makers have sought to slash
this number by half), high melodrama
with a strong emotional impact, and a cli¬
mactic sequence in which the hero
usually destroys the villain with fists or
guns.
Traditionally Indian films have a hero,
a heroine and a villain. On the periphery
there are a mother figure, a comedian to

who will appeal to the young people in
the audience, and a Muslim or a Chris¬
tian character. This is the framework
devised by the Bombay movie moguls
and it is followed by other film-producing
centres in Madras, Calcutta and the
Punjab.
The father of Indian cinema was
Dhundiraj Govind Phalke (1870-1944).
Born into a priestly family in Nasik dis¬
trict, not far from Bombay, Phalke was
trained to be a Sanskrit scholar, but his
interests lay more in the direction of
painting, theatre and magic. When he saw
a film about the life of Christ, he was
excited by the possibilities of the new
medium. The outcome was India's first
feature film, Raja Harisbchandra (1913),
whose plot, drawn from Indian mytho¬
logy, was a celebration of the deeds of the
monarch who sacrificed his wealth, king¬
dom and family in his quest for truth.
Phalke became a prolific film produ¬
cer whose work was popular throughout
the country. Other stalwarts of the Indian
silent cinema included Dhiren Ganguly,
who made the satirical comedy England
Returned (1921); Debaki Kumar Bose,
who directed the adventure movie Kana-
mar Aagun (Flames of Flesh; 1928); and
Chandulal Shah who made Typist Girl
(1926) and Gun Sundari (Why Husbands
Go Astray; 1927), both of which evoke
the strength and dignity of the Indian
woman.
Film making became big business as
well as a medium for artistic expression.
Studios and production groups such as
New Theatres of Calcutta, the Prabhat
Film Company of Pune (near Bombay)
and Bombay Talkies were formed by
entrepreneurs and dictated taste during
the 1930s, the first decade of sound. One
particularly active studio, the Imperial
Film Company, produced India's first
talking feature, Alam Ara (Beauty of the
World; 1931, in Hindi), which included
a dozen songs.
By 1940, 100 films a year were being
made in India, a figure which doubled by
1950. Today, India ranks third in the total
number of films produced after the Uni¬
ted States and Japan, but since 1976 has
led the world in annual film output. In
1983, 763 Indian films were made, most
of them in Bombay and Madras. Current
output is over 900 films a year, and des¬
pite keen competition from television and
video, cinema is still India's best-loved
form of entertainment.
Yet Indian cinema has not confined
itself to entertainment. It has made
genuine efforts to portray the Indian
mind and emotions. It has advanced the
theory that the good must triumph over
evil, taken the side of the downtrodden,
stressed the need for respect for one's
elders, and portrayed the quality of
honesty in a largely corrupt world. The
best examples of such cinema date from
the 1950s, which is generally acknow¬
ledged to have been a golden decade when
film makers were not entirely dominat¬
ed by box office considerations and the
national mood was one of optimism and
hope.
The films made in the 1950s by direc¬
tors V. Shantaram, Raj Kapoor, Guru
Dutt and Bimal Roy are today widely
regarded as masterpieces. Plots were then

often taken from indigenous literary
sources and were rooted in Indian soil.
The intention was to combine social
conscience with entertainment, a difficult
blend to achieve. There was also a drive
to use more advanced technology.
After the 1950s, with the advent of
colour, the cinema became more light-
hearted and escapist. The tendency was
to produce sugary love stories set in
Kashmir or picturesque hill-towns such
as Darjeeling. From this background
emerged India's best-known film maker,
Satyajit Ray.
Born in 1921 into a cultivated Bengal
family, Ray was influenced in early life
by the great poet Rabindranath Tagore,
and by his own father Sukumar, a noted
Bengali writer. He became acquainted
with the French director Jean Renoir
when Renoir was making his film The
River in Calcutta. Encouraged by Renoir,
Ray started work on Father Panchali

by the end of the 1960s, starting with
Mrinal Sen's Bhuvan Shome (Mr. Shome;
1969), the story of a tyrannical bureau¬
crat who meets a dynamic farm girl. Two
of the most original talents in Indian
cinema are graduates of the Pune Film
Institute. Both Mani Kaul (Uski Roti; A
Day's Bread, 1970) and Kumar Shahani
(Maya Darpan; "The Mirror of Illusion",
1972) have refused to compromise with
the dictates of the market, and despite
being criticized for not being "accessi¬
ble", they have worked towards the deve¬
lopment of new narrative techniques in
their films.
A trend commonly known as "middle
of the road" cinema has also emerged
through films treating subjects such as
rural oppression and political chicanery.
The leading figures in this movement are

by the Bengali writer Bibhuti Bhushan
Banerji, was completed on a shoestring
budget. At the 1956 Cannes film festival
it was voted the "best human document"
shown.
Ray's work has brought world status
to Indian cinema. The Apu trilogy, Maha-
nagar(The Big City; 1963) and Charulata
(1964) are recognized as masterpieces.
Another Bengal film maker, the late Rit-
wik Ghatak, is also widely considered as
a director of genius. His Ajantrik (The
Mechanical Man; 1958), a fable about a
taxi-driver's relationship with his dilapi¬
dated taxi, and Megbe Dhaka Tara (The
Hidden Star; 1960) are brilliant depictions
of harsh east Bengal reality.
Mrinal Sen, like Ray, is a product of
the Calcutta film society movement.
Inspired by the international classics he
had seen, he made Raat Bhore (Night's
End; 1956) and Neel Akasher Neechey
(Under the Blue Sky; 1958). His Baishey
Shravana (The Wedding Day; 1960) was
well received at the Venice Film Festival.
Changes swept through Indian cinema
in the late 1960s and the 1970s after
Indian film makers had come into in¬
creasing contact with the work of foreign
artists and directors. Both Ray and Bimal
Roy, for example, had been impressed
and influenced by Italian neo-realism.

There was also a growing awareness
of the need to set up an institution where
students could learn the art of film
making, and in response to this the Film
Institute of India was founded in Pune in
1961. Its graduates were taught not to
pander to accepted formulas but to strike
out in new directions. The new move¬
ment in the cinema was supported by the
Film Finance Corporation, later incorpo¬
rated into the National Film Develop¬
ment Corporation (NFDC), which had

A NEW POLICY
FOR EDUCATION BY ANIL BORDIA
EDUCATION was given high
priority after India gained in¬

Constitution called on the State to pro¬
vide free and compulsory primary edu¬
cation and gave the federal government
the responsibility for maintaining stan¬
dards in higher and technical education.

be a concern of the provincial govern¬

my, and each five-year plan indicates the
directions for educational development.
Dramatic expansion of education has
taken place since independence. The
number of primary (including upper
primary) schools has tripled and enrol¬
ment has increased from about 30 per
cent to 80 per cent. The increase in the
enrolment of girls at primary level has
been particularly impressive, from 17.7
per cent in 1950-1951 to 64.6 per cent in
1986-1987.
Increase in enrolments has been even
more spectacular in secondary education,
and the number of schoolteachers has ris¬
en from 750,000 to 3.7 million. In higher
and professional education, the number
of institutions and enrolments has in¬
creased eightfold, and in technical educa¬
tion about tenfold.
In 1964, the Government of India ap-

pointed a commission to advise on the na¬
tional pattern of education and on the
general principles and policies for educa¬
tional development. Four years later, an
education policy formulated on the ba¬
sis of the commission's recommendations
called for a transformation of the educa¬
tion system which would relate it more
closely to the life of the people; a con¬
tinuous effort to expand educational op¬
portunity; a sustained and intensive effort
to raise the quality of education at all
stages; an emphasis on the development
of science and technology; and the culti¬
vation of moral and social values.
The most remarkable change which
took place after the adoption of the 1968
Education Policy was the establishment
of a common structure of education. This
consisted of ten years of common school¬
ing for all children, followed by two years
of higher secondary education and a
three-year degree course.
In 1985, the Central Government
again reviewed the educational situation
and decided to initiate a new National
Policy on Education, which was debated
extensively by students, teachers and peo¬
ple in all walks of life before it was passed
by the two Houses of Parliament in
February 1986. A detailed Programme of
Action was completed a few months later
to ensure that the policy would be im¬
plemented without delay.
The 1986 education policy envisages
a national system which will take deter¬
mined action to bring about universal
primary education and promote the
spread of adult literacy, thereby helping

to reduce inequalities. The education sys¬
tem will be based on a national curricu-
lar framework which contains a common
core as well as components specific to
each region. The core will cut across sub¬
ject areas and will be designed to promote
such values as India's common cultural
heritage, egalitarianism, democracy and
secularism, equality of the sexes, protec¬
tion of the environment, observance of
the small family norm, and the scientific
approach. Pace-setting schools called
Navodaya Vidyalayas will provide quali¬
ty education to particularly gifted chil¬
dren, irrespective of their families' means,
and will promote excellence as well as

equity and social justice. The 1986 policy
also emphasizes the need to raise the level
of investment in education from about
4 per cent of national income in 1986 to
6 per cent by 1990 and even higher
thereafter.
Soon after assuming office in 1984,
Prime Minister Rajiv Gandhi announced
his decision to launch a National Litera¬
cy Mission (NLM) to bring functional
literacy to some 80 million illiterate peo¬
ple in the 15 to 35 age group. The teach¬
ing of functional literacy is designed to
achieve a variety of goals, including self-
reliance in literacy and numeracy; the de¬
velopment of awareness among the poor
and the illiterate of the causes of their
deprivation; the acquisition of skills to
improve economic status and general
well-being; understanding of the values of
national integration; conservation of the
environment; women's equality; and the
small family norm. NLM also stresses the
importance of post-literacy and continu¬
ing education.
A number of important initiatives
have been taken as a result of the new na¬
tional policy on education:
* A nationwide programme for the
improvement of primary education facil¬
ities, including reorganization of teacher
training, is now under way.
* New curricula have been written for
primary and secondary education and
new textbooks and teaching materials
have been prepared.
* Special programmes have been
launched to improve science teaching, in¬
troduce computer literacy and promote
awareness of environmental issues.

INDIA'S
LIFELINE
BY ANEES JUNG

»
INDIA waits for the monsoon each
year the way a child waits for its
mother's breast. But unlike the child
that comes of age and stops waiting, more
than half of India depends on the mon¬
soon for its survival. When it fails the
land broods.
To awaken the monsoon, the peasants
in my mother's village would come sing¬
ing through the dust-filled tracks carry¬
ing a huge basket poised on a wooden
pole. A large bull frog would be seated
in the basket that was padded with neem
leaves. The cry oîHassana Hossana uyalo
would rend the still hot air. Children
would run out of sun-baked huts and
pour drops of precious water on the frog.
And by evening the clouds would roll in,
the heavens would thunder and there
would be rain.
Customs such as these have been part
of every Indian child's heritage. But now
the age of miracles seems to be over. One
child in Rajasthan I met a year ago had
not seen rain. He was six years old. His
mother, a young woman of thirty, had
begun to look like an older woman. She
had lost the lilt of her limbs, walking five
kilometres each day to fetch water for
drinking. Her well was dry, like all the
wells in her area.

The peacock is India's national bird and is
often depicted in the company of
Lord Krishna.
The monsoons had failed Rajasthan
for several years. The grass was brown.
All crops had been lost. Dead guava trees
were being cut for fuel. Even in the city
of Ajmer the taps would come to life only
once every four days, and then only for
a few hours. The Anasager lake looked
like a burning bowl of sand. The washer¬
women had disappeared from its shores.
The beating of their clothes had been si¬
lenced. On the edges of the city, in relief
camps, lean cattle stood with vacant eyes.
The animal most prized by the farmer
had been anointed with kum kum, the
auspicious red powder, and had been
abandoned. There was no fodder.
"We want food not money", said the
women who were hired to work in the
drought relief work programmes. Lack of
rain had killed the crops, aggravated in¬
flation, spiralled prices across the parched
land. In Madras, there were fist fights in
the lines of people waiting at communi¬
ty taps for water. Hordes of elephants
ambled away from the parched forests of
Tamil Nadu into neighbouring Karnata-
ka. In the unrelenting sun farmers in the
country beseeched gods, priests chanted
mantras in good faith, scientists wondered
why their sound vibrations were not stir¬
ring the atmosphere, seeding the clouds
and sending rain. Meteorologists scanned
the skies and put out intricate weather
charts. On the whims of the monsoon
rested major economic decisions. Politi¬
cal fortunes were staked on its success and
failure. On the promise of the monsoon
rested the survival of a vast land.
The Indian monsoon is not just
another word for rain. It is neither a
typhoon nor a spell of roaring winds. It
is a season whose name stems from the
Arabic word mausern. It is not rainfall
that determines and defines the monsoons
but the seasonal winds that shift direction
twice a year. If the wind is from another
direction there is no rain. There is a sum¬
mer monsoon and a winter monsoon.
But it is only the nimbus southwest winds
of summer that make a mausernthe

season of rains. It is preceded by the loo,
hot dry winds, days of intense heat and
a scorching sun.
When the pied-crested African cuck¬
oos fly back and the shrill cries of pea¬
cocks fill the air, people know that the
monsoon is days away. Peasants across
the land have their own ways of predict¬
ing the monsoon. The more intense the
heat, the more rain there will be, they
say. The coming of the rains is also
celebrated with intensity. People run out
and soak themselves in the rain like chil¬
dren. In the words of the famous fifth-
century poet Kalidasa, the clouds advance
"like rutting elephants, enormous and
full of rain. They come forward as kings
among tumultuous armies; their flags are
lightning, the thunder is the drum". It is
as great an event for the farmer as it is
for the singer, the poet. The heavy dark
clouds fill the canvases of miniature
painters. And for the poet, the dark tress¬
es of his beloved are like the waves of the
monsoon clouds. As long ago as the sixth
century the poet Subandhu in his
Vasavadatta welcomed the monsoons in
these words:
"The rainy season had arrived. Rivers
overflowed their banks. Peacocks danced
at eventide. The rain quelled the expanse
of dust as a great ascetic quells the tide
of passion. The chataka birds were hap¬
py. Lightning shone like a bejewelled
boat of love in the pleasure pool of the
sky; it was like a garland for the gate of
the place of paradise; like a lustrous gir¬
dle for some heavenly beauty; like a row
of nail marks left upon the cloud by its
lover, the departing day ... the rain was
like a chess player while yellow and green
frogs were like chessmen jumping in the
enclosures of the irrigated fields. Hail¬
stones flashed like pearls from the neck¬
laces of heavenly birds".
Some of the best evocations of the
monsoons are found in the baramasa
(twelve months), "lovers' calendars"
composed by the poets of north India, in
which feelings are expressed in harmony
with the seasons. In all Indian languages
innumerable proverbs stress the impor¬
tance of rains. Some proverbs instruct
farmers, others warn them of the nature
of rain. Ghagh, the learned Brahmin poet-
astrologer who composed many
proverbs, had this to say: "When water
in the pitcher does not cool, when spar¬
rows bathe in dust and ants take their eggs
to a safer place, you can be sure of a heavy

downpour". His proverbs remain on the
lips of every peasant in the Hindi-
speaking belt of Uttar Pradesh and
Haryana. "Scarcity is only a missed mon¬
soon away", is a saying that lurks in the
mind of every Indian. For the Indian
monsoon remains unpredictable. It can
skip a region, flood another, tease a third.
It can, as the ancient proverb says, "fall
on one horn of a buffalo and not on
another". It can bless a land, but also
deny and destroy. It wears a new face
every season.

VILLAGE WISDOM
An unsung resource for rural development
BY SANJIT BUNKER ROY
WHEN I began working in the
villages in 1967 1 used to think
that India needed trained ur¬
ban professionals to develop the rural
areas. I used to think with the arrogance
that young people acquire in public
schools that rural India had nothing to
offer and that its people needed us. Now,
after twenty years of interaction with
needy villagers, I have totally changed my
position.
I respect the skill of the traditional
midwife and believe she is much more im¬
portant to rural India than the alienated
urban-trained Auxiliary Nurse Midwife.
I value the wisdom and knowledge of the
village priest and marvel at his patience
as a teacher.

those who train the teachers in charge of
these schools is a village priest. Another
priest installs and maintains the sophisti¬

three hours of light in many of the
schools. Neither of them holds a teacher's
diploma and would never obtain a

to learn that there was no electronics en¬

the unused or under-used human
resources which could help villages to
achieve self-reliance, reduce their depen¬
dence on government and reduce the cost
of social and economic services.

primary school dropoutwho drew up
the outlines of a system of hand pump
maintenance which is currently being im¬
plemented, with community support, to
repair over 40,000 hand pumps in Rajas¬
than. This Hand Pump Mechanic (HPM)
scheme, for which the ex-bicycle mechan¬

gineers, and is not accountable to those
who actually use the pumps. The HPM
scheme is the only one of its kind being
encouraged by India's Technology Mis¬

Such cases show that village people
can think and propose solutions that are
practical, inexpensive and widely applica¬

THE PHILOSOPHICAL
TRADITION
Upavarta wood, near the town of Kusinagara,
northern India. This is where the Buddha was
reputedly cremated after his death and his
ashes dispersed.
PHILOSOPHY is an integral part
of the Indian tradition, and reflects
vividly one of the main features of
that tradition: unity underlying diversi¬
ty. When Prince Siddhartha, the histori¬
cal founder of Buddhism, renounced his
palace in search of wisdom in the sixth
century BC, he learnt that there were
forty-eight philosophical schools, from
naturalism and realism at one end to real¬
ism and mysticism at the other. The San
skrit term for philosophy is darshana,
literally "viewing" or "seeing". Truth is
one, but it is multi-faceted and can be
"seen" from different perspectives.
Diverse darshanas or philosophical
schools complement rather than con¬
tradict each other. This implies intellec¬
tual tolerance.
One of the unifying factors underly¬
ing divergent schools is the conviction
that philosophical knowledge is not an

end in itself but a means to inner trans¬
formation leading to liberation (mukti or
Nirvana). Even those who created high¬
ly specialized and technical philosophical
systems accepted the common goal of
liberation. It was assumed that
philosophical insight is only one aspect
of the highest wisdom which includes the
moral purity of the sage and the sensitiv¬
ity of the poet and the artist. A further
point of agreement among philosophers
(except materialists) is the view that liber¬
ation, the goal of wisdom, cannot come
through an external force, such as "Des¬
tiny", but through our own deeds and
thoughts (karmas) spread over a succes¬
sion of lifetimes.
The Jaina philosophical school accepts
the existence of many types of substances
(dravya), the main distinction being that
between inanimate substances (pudgala)
and living substances (jiva). All living be¬

attributes and attain absolute knowledge
(kaivalya). The tirthankaras represent the
highest reality, and there is no place for
God in Jaina philosophy.
Buddhist thought, in its early phase,
was mainly ethical, since the Buddha had
avoided metaphysical issues, devoting his
attention to the problem of Suffering.
However, the Buddha's emphasis on the
universality of the law of causation and
the impermanence of all phenomenal
things opened the way for metaphysics,
particularly after the emergence of the
Mahayana school. Nagarjuna (c. 150-250
AD), the greatest among Buddhist
philosophers, founded Shunyavada (The
Doctrine of Emptiness). If Reality is to
be grasped in its essential nature, all finite
concepts and attributes must be "emptied
out".
Turning to the Hindu tradition, in the
earliest Vedic hymns (c. 1500-1200 BC)
we already find the monistic trend that
has subsequently dominated Indian
thought. There must be, behind all mul-

tiplicity, a single reality which is called
by different names. In the Upanishads,
sacred texts composed many centuries
later, the vision is turned inward and the
one Universal Spirit dwelling in each in¬
dividual (the Atman) is declared to be the
same as the Supreme Reality (Brahman)
at the root of the universe. Still later, in
the Bhagavadgita ("Song of the Lord",
c.200 BC) an attempt was made to syn¬
thesize different philosophical and reli¬
gious perspectives into the "Six
Doctrines".
These six systems of Hindu philo¬

accept the authority of the Vedas,
Upanishads and the Bhagavadgita.
Samkhya is dualistic. It accepts two in¬
dependent realities: Purusha (Spirit) and
Prakriti (Nature). The former is pure
Consciousness, the latter is the principle
of energy. They do not meet, but the
very nearness of Purusha stirs Prakriti.
The balance between the three main in¬
gredients of Prakriti is disturbed, and the
universe evolves. Yoga accepts the
philosophical foundation of Samkhya and
applies it to the practical side of Self-
realization. The aim of Yoga is to undo
the distorsions caused by the mind, so
that the true nature of Spirit may be real¬
ized. This can be achieved through medi¬
tation, for which one has to equip oneself
through bodily and mental control.
The Nyaya ("Analysis") school deals
with logical propositions and fallacies,
and examines the sources of human
knowledge. Vaisheshika discusses differ¬
ent categories of substances. It asserts that
all substances are composed of four types
of atoms which are eternal and in¬
divisible.
The Mimansa ("Enquiry") school
deals with causality and offers a
philosophical justification for the authori¬
ty of the Vedas and Vedic ritual. Vedan-
ta ("the End of the Vedas") represents the
crowning glory of classical Indian
philosophy, the culmination of the Ved¬
ic tradition. Vedanta has many schools,
the most influential being Monism, or
"Non-dualism" (Advaita). Ramanuja (d.
1137) asserts that the world, and the hu¬
man individual, though not identical with
God, are within the Divine Whole. The
great philosopher Shankara (c. 788-820)
offers a more complete and absolute
Monism. Brahman or the Absolute is the
only true reality. The human self (jiva) is
identical with Brahman, while the world
(jagat) is a mere appearance. The self and
the world are seen as separate because of
a mysterious, cosmic power (Maya, "illu¬
sion") which causes ignorance.
Shankara's Advaita Vedanta doctrine has
dominated Indian thought for twelve cen¬
turies. Its prestige can be judged by the
popular saying that no other philosophy
can challenge Advaita, "just as all living
beings in the forest are silent when the
lion roars". V.S.N.

HIGH DAYS
AND
HOLIDAYS
The ratha or temple chariot being taken out in procession, Tamil Nadu, south India. The chariot, which weighs several tons, is pushed by elephants
and devotees.
VISITORS who come to India with the
notion that the Indian outlook on life
is austere and pessimistic are surprised
to see the zest for life which Indians display.
This enthusiasm is seen in a vivid and pic¬
turesque light during the fairs and festivals that
have been held since remote Antiquity.
Festivals afford glimpses of the continuity
and diversity of Indian life. People of differ¬
ent regions, speaking different languages, can
be seen wearing a variety of costumes. There
are farmers and aristocrats, mendicants and
astrologers, poets, preachers and wandering
singers. There is colour and pageantry, faith
and devotion. And, amidst all this diversity,
we feel the living presence of India.
Most of the festivals have a strong religious
basis. There are discourses, hymns, chants, and
readings from scriptures. Many festivals are
associated with specific deities. Rama Navami
(March or April), Shiva Ratri (February or
March) and Krishna Janmashtami (August) are
celebrated in honour of Rama, Shiva and
Krishna respectively. The festival of the god¬
dess Durga comes in October, while Sarasvati,
goddess of learning and the arts, is worshipped
in early spring.
The Indian calendar is lunar. Special sanc¬
tity attaches to festivals held on nights of full
moon or new moon. Apart from the moon,
other phenomena of Nature are commemo¬
rated with affection and reverence. A day is
set aside for expressing gratitude to the banyan
tree, another is devoted to the nagas (serpents).
Seasons are welcomed with festivities. Vasant
Panchmi (early February) is the festival of
spring. The autumn is greeted on the brightest
moonlit night of the year, Sharad Pumima
(usually in late October). Many fairs and
festivals are held on the banks of sacred rivers.
At the confluence of the Ganges and the
Yamuna rivers at Allahabad, a festival is held
throughout the month of Magha (January-
February). Every twelfth year, this religious
fair is known as the Khumba Mela. During the
Kumbha, sometimes more than five million
people come to bathe at the holy confluence
on the day of amavasya (new moon).

The most important Muslim festival is
Id al-Fitr, at the end of the month-long fast
of Ramadan. People wear new clothes and
offer special prayers at mosques. This is fol¬
lowed by a feast. The Parsi new year (Nauroz),
and the Christian festivals of Christmas and
Easter, are celebrated with great enthusiasm.
The birthdays of Buddha, Mahavira and Guru
Nanak (founders of Buddhism, Jainism and
Sikhism respectively) are national holidays.
The majority of festivals, however, belong to
the Hindu tradition.
On these occasions, the religious and secu¬
lar aspects of life are happily blended. Reli¬
gious ritual is combined with cultural
programmes: folk dances, concerts, popular
plays, puppet shows, poetic symposia. Way¬
side shops spring up, and bargaining is a popu¬
lar diversion. In recent years, even politicians
have started addressing the crowds that gather
at festivals.
Dussehra, Diwali and Holi ire the three
major Hindu festivals. The ten-day Dussehra
festival commemorates the victory of Rama,
an incarnation of the Divine, over Ravana,
king of the demons. Episodes from the ancient
epic, Ramayana, are enacted on the stage.
Three weeks after Dussehra, which usual¬
ly occurs in October, comes Diwali, the Fes¬
tival of Light. Houses are cleaned and
illuminated in order to welcome Lakshmi, the
goddess of well-being and prosperity. There
is a display of fireworks, and traditional sweets
are served after the ceremonial worship of
Lakshmi. An interesting feature of Diwali is
the honour paid to the materials used in
various vocations. Goldsmiths and carpenters
polish their tools and place flowers upon
them. Merchants honour their account books.
Artists and writers express their gratitude to
their brushes, pens, pencils and inkpots!

The Hindu festival of Holi is linked to Lord
Krishna, who is often shown throwing colour
on Radha, his beloved. This 18th-
century miniature from Rajasthan depicts a
typical Holi scene, with celebrants throwing
coloured powder on each other.

the god of intelligence.
While Diwali is celebrated on a night of
new moon, Holi, the festival of colour, begins
on the night of the full moon in the month
oiPhalgun (March-April). Bonfires are kindled
at street corners, symbolically cleansing the
atmosphere of all that is evil. The following
morning, people are on the streets, spurting
coloured water over each other. Like the bac-
chanalia of ancient Greece, Holi is a folk fes¬
tival at which inhibitions are shed, women
come out of their seclusion, and caste barriers
are set aside. At mid-day, the shouting, sing¬
ing and colour-pelting all stop. Then, after a
bath, people embrace each other and partake
of sweets.
It is said that Holi was the favourite festival
of the divine Krishna, the pastoral hero whose
beauty enchanted all the cowherd girls of the
village. On the day of Holi, Krishna danced
with themespecially with his beloved
Radhaand drenched them with coloured
water. That is why even today Holi is celebrat¬
ed with special joy and zest at Vrindavan, the
home of Krishna. V.S.N.

THE
SCIENTIFIC
LEGACY
IT has long been wrongly assumed
that the idealisticeven mystical-
predilections of Indian thought must
have hindered the objective observation
and study of Nature. But a metaphysics
which asserts that only the Infinite Di¬
vine has absolute reality can also accept
the relative reality of the material world
seen from a practical, empirical per¬
spective.
The Indian tradition assumes that every¬
thing in the universe is significant to some
degree, and hence deserves careful study.
In recent years India's contribution to the
positive sciences, such as engineering,

metallurgy, chemistry and above all
mathematics, astronomy and medicine,
has gained wide recognition. Some
writers have indulged in uncritical glorifi¬
cation of "ancient wisdom", which is
supposed to have anticipated the most ad¬
vanced research of modern science. But
a more balanced estimate is gradually
emerging.
Indian mathematics go back to the
Vedic age, when the construction of are¬
nas for sacrificial ritual demanded ac¬
curate measurements. Pride of place in
Indian mathematics goes to Aryabhatta
(late fifth century AD) who elaborated
the decimal system which had been de¬
vised by his predecessors. Other famous
names are those of Brahmagupta, Ma-
havira and Bhaskara (of the seventh,
ninth and twelfth centuries respectively).
They understood the significance of posi¬
tive and negative quantities, solved many
complex equations, and evolved methods
of extracting square roots and cube roots.

They showed profound insight into the
implications of zero (shunyà) and of in¬
finity. Bhaskara proved mathematically
that infinity, however divided, remains
infinitea truth which had been accept¬
ed on the metaphysical plane as early as
the 6th century BC in the Upanishads.
The Arabs are widely believed to have
adopted from the Indians the decimal sys¬
tem using the zero, and passed it on to
European scientists. India thus provided
indirectly the mathematical foundation
without which many important advances
in Western science and technology would
not have been possible.
In the field of astronomy, Aryabhat-
ta again emerges as a revolutionary
genius. He determined the length of the

solar year as 365.3596805 days, which is
remarkably close to the modern estimate.
He asserted that the Earth rotates on its
axis and revolves round the Sun, a view
for which Galileo was persecuted by the
Catholic Church a thousand years later.
Another great astronomer was Varahami-
hira, a contemporary of Aryabhatta. He
was thoroughly familiar with Greek and
Roman astronomy, from which he adopt¬
ed many features including the signs of
the zodiac. Indian astronomers described
the procession of equinoxes, forecast
eclipses, and made amazingly accurate cal¬
culations of planetary movements
without the aid of telescopes.
While astronomy and mathematics
grew together, the progress of medicine
involved considerable knowledge of
chemistry and botany. The origin of
Ayurveda ("Science of Longevity") goes
back to the Samaveda. In the writings of
Charaka and Sushruta (first and fourth
centuries AD respectively) almost every
aspect of diagnosis and treatment was dis¬
cussed. The properties of herbs, seeds,
minerals and salts were studied carefully;
the importance of fresh air and water was
stressed; a code of medical conduct was
evolved; surgical instruments and tech¬
niques were developed. Yoga had an im¬
portant therapeutic side and yielded
valuable knowledge about respiration, the
circulation of the blood and the nervous
system, and about the physiological ef¬
fects of emotional and mystical states.
Indian medicine is based on the con¬
cepts of doshas ("humours") and gunas
("ingredients of Nature"). The first in¬
volves the study of the three vital fluids-
wind, gall and mucuswhich must be
balanced for good health. The second
concept presupposes three basic gunas:
sattva, rajas and tamas, associated with pu¬
rity, passion and apathy respectively. For
perfect health, sattva must dominate the
other elements. The physician tries to en¬
sure this by regulating diet, exercise and
medication.
The doctor has always occupied a
prestigious position in Indian society. A
spiritual preceptor or guru was also
looked upon as a healer. The idea of the
sanctity of all life also encouraged the de¬
velopment of veterinary medicine. Many
specialized treatises were written about
the treatment of horses, elephants and
other animals and birds. V.S.N.

PROJECT TIGER
m
*** -^
#---
BY RAHUL SINGH
Atiger in its natural habitat is one
of Nature's most marvellous and
unforgettable sights. Around
3 metres long and weighing about 230 ki¬
los, the adult animal with its beautifully
coloured coat of golden-orange and black
stripes is swift, ferocious and powerful,
yet languid and graceful in its move¬
ments. It is an unmatched hunting
machine. No other animal arouses such
fear, excitement and awe; no other animal
is surrounded with such an air of mys¬
tery.
The tiger, which is afraid of no wild
creature, has one mortal enemyman,
who can not only destroy this magnifi¬
cent animal with guns, poison and traps
but can also destroy its surroundings with
axe and chain-saw.
Half a century ago, there were at least
60,000 tigers in Asia. In Indonesia, the last
known tiger was killed just before the Se¬
cond World War and the Caspian tiger
followed it into oblivion three decades
later. (Attempts are now being made to
re-introduce the tiger to these areas.)
India has become the tiger's last major
haunt in Asia, but here too the species has
been devastated on á monumental scale.
At the turn of the century there were
40,000 tigers in India. By 1972 there were
just 2,000 left. For the maharajahs of In¬
dia, with their lavish privy purses, tiger
shooting was a status symbol. One ma-
harajah proudly claimed to have shot
1,150 tigers during his lifetime. Bags of
500 were quite commonplace.

has given the tiger a new lease of life.

But even the abolition of the prince¬
ly order did not improve matters.
Poachers moved in for the valuable tiger
skins, which two decades ago were worth
$4,000 each. Meanwhile, India's popula¬
tion explosion from 450 million at in¬
dependence in 1947 to over 800 million
today meant that people moved inexora¬
bly into the tiger's habitat.
Jim Corbett. Eight tiger reserves were in¬
itially created as part of Project Tiger, to
which the World Wildlife F\:nd donated
$1 million.
According to Bittu Sehgal, the
founder-editor of India's leading wildlife
magazine, Sanctuary, the idea behind
Project Tiger is basically very simple.
"Each reserve is demarcated into a core
Miniature from Jaipur shows a tiger shoot.
Forests, particularly in the Terai
region bordering India and Nepal, were
cut down to provide land for foodcrops.
Its cover and that of its prey destroyed,
the tiger disappeared from many parts of
India where it had earlier flourished in
large numbers. In other areas tigers
retreated further and further into such
forests as were left, often killing domes¬
tic cattle in their desperate hunger. By the
time alarm bells started to ring in the late
1960s, the tiger was on the verge of ex¬
tinction in India.
The 1969 world congress of the Inter¬
national Union for the Conservation of
Nature and Natural Resources (IUCN),
held in New Delhi, signalled an impor¬
tant turning point. The IUCN put the
tiger on its list of endangered species and
called for a ban on tiger hunting world¬
wide, to which India quickly reacted by
forbidding tiger-shoots. On 1 April 1973
an ambitious "Project Tiger" was official¬
ly launched by the Indian Government
in Corbett National Park (Uttar
Pradesh), named after the legendary Brit¬
ish hunter turned conservationist.
zone and a buffer zone. In the core, no
human activity other than forest protec¬
tion is allowed; here Nature is allowed to
administer itself. In the buffer, human ac¬
tivity is minimized, restricted to the ex¬
ploitation of 'minor' forest produce such
as grass, fruit, seeds, honey, and fallen
wood. The logic is that the core area, left
to its own devices, will quickly become
super-productive and that this productivi¬
ty will spill over to the buffer zone."
The results of the new strategy were
extremely encouraging. Slowly but sure¬
ly, the tiger started to make a comeback
in India. At Corbett Park, there were
only forty-four tigers left sixteen years
ago; today there are nearly 100. At Ran-
thambhor, a forest once owned by the
Maharajah ofJaipur and protected main¬
ly for tiger hunting, the number of tigers
remaining at the start of Project Tiger has
increased from fourteen to forty.
Thanks to Project Tiger, the tiger has
even made a remarkable recovery in the
Sundarbans, the 10,000-square-kilometre
delta partly in Bangladesh and partly in
India, where the Ganges, the Brah
maputra and the Meghna flow into the
Bay of Bengal. Here, in one of the world's
largest tracts of mangroves, an area where
the ecosystem was seriously threatened,
more and more woodcutters, fishermen
and honey-gatherers were being attacked
by tigers, who in the process of evolution
have become excellent swimmers and
whose diet now includes fish.
In 1973 Project Tiger was launched
over an area of 2,500 square kilometres
of the Sundarbans. At first, the authori¬
ties tried to exclude people entirely from
the core reserve, but this proved imprac¬
tical, and fishermen and honey-gatherers
continued to go there despite the risks.
So, in 1981, a new strategy was devised.
Electrified human dummies were placed
at selected points in order to condition
the tigers to fear man. When the dummies
were attacked by the tigers, the latter
received a shock powerful enough to
cause them pain.
The ploy seems to have worked. Since
then, the number of people killed by the
tigers has dropped considerably. At the
same time, since the inner core has been
protected, honey collection and fish har¬
vesting have increased by 300 per cent in
fifteen years.
As Sehgal says, Project Tiger is con¬
cerned not only with saving the tiger but
with ecology, the environment, and "sav¬
ing mankind itself". Today, the numbei
of tigers in India has risen to 4,000 and,
in the process, other creatures which
were on the verge of extinction in India,
such as the elephant, the stag, the one-
horned rhino and the wild buffalo, have
been given a new lease of life.
Above all, the Indian public is now far
more aware of how man's future on this
planet is closely linked with Nature.
Deforestation has certainly threatened the
tiger, but it has also been a cause of the
floods that recently ravaged much of
north and eastern India. The connection
would not have been made twenty years
ago, but it is being made now. That is a
step in the right direction.

ANGER OF THE SEA-GODDESS BY THAKAZHI S. PILLAI
In its 14 major languages and several
hundred other languages or dialects,
modern India has many thriving
literatures. One ofthem is that of
Malayalam, the official language of
Kerala State in southwestern India. The
leading living novelist in Malayalam is
Thakazhi Sivasankara Pillai (born
1914), whose mostfamous novel,
Chemmeen, has been translated into all
the main languages ofIndia, where it
became aphenomenal best-seller, and
into many other languages as well.
Chemmeen tells the story ofthe
relationship between Karuthamma, the
daughterofa Hindufisherman, and
Pareekutti, the son ofa Muslimfish
wholesaler. Wepublish below an extract
from thefinalpages ofPillai's novel. It
opens as Karuthamma and Pareekutti
meet on the seashore while
Karuthamma's husband, Palani the
fisherman, is out at sea. The events
described are inspired by the beliefofthe
Hindupeople that Karuthamma's
defiant behaviour willanger the sea-
goddess Kadalamma. The extract has
been takenfrom an English translation
o/Chemmeen by Narayana Menon
which has been included in the Unesco
Collection ofRepresentative Works
(Gollancz publishers, London/Harper
and Brothers, New York).
WHEN Palani was away at sea, was
it right that she should stand talk¬
ing to a stranger? Karuthamma,
however, was not afraid. She had met him be¬
fore alone in the darkness of night. If she could
give a man whose life she had crushed at least
a moment's happiness, shouldn't she grant it?
They stood face to face looking at each
other. The man that she had ruined stood be¬
fore her. She knew for certain that he would
love her forever. He would always understand
her and forgive her. She could do anything to
him. He would put up with anything from
her.
In those few seconds Karuthamma forgot
all the sorrows of her life. She felt she had not
been vanquished. She had the strength few
had. She was under the protection of a strong
man, life was secure. Palani would see to it
that the world outside wouldn't dare touch
her or hurt her. And she also had something
else which gave her spirit sustenance. A man
loved her as no man had loved a woman. Be¬
tween these two, her life was full. Now the
man who loved her stood in front of her.
She entered his extended arms and her
body became one with his. Their faces met.
He whispered in her ears.
"My Karuthamma"
"Yes!"
He stroked her all over and his hands slow¬
ly moved to where he and the rude young
boatmen of the seafront used to stare.
"Karuthamma"
Again she answered him obediently in that
semiconscious state of ecstasy.
"Yes-"
"What am I to you?"
She took his face in both her hands and
looking at him with half-closed eyes, she said,
"Everything. My pot of gold".
Again they became one. And in that state
he whispered gently in her ears.
She could not break herself away from that
embrace.
Far out at sea Palani baited a shark, a real¬
ly big shark. Until that day so huge a shark
had never swallowed any bait of his or of any¬
one else's. No fisherman had ever caught as
big a fish in that sea.
The moment it was baited, the shark struck
hard. The sea churned and the water splashed
upward into the sky. Then it came charging
up. Palani saw it come above the water. He
could see the line coming out of its mouth.
Palani realized that he had caught the big¬
gest fish of that seacoast. He shouted forth his
happiness at the catch. He must make a quick
decision. Should he hold fast to the line and
stop the fish or should he let it go for some
time? If the bait had gone right into its throat,
one pull of the line would be sufficient to stop
that dangerous beast. But it might charge at
the boat and smash it. But if he let it go, the
boat would speed after it. And it was difficult
to say how far the boat would be dragged
along with it.
Palani couldn't see the shore. He had no
idea in which direction the coast lay. He held
the line with one hand and with the other
guided the boat, and looked toward the sky
to find his bearing by the stars. He couldn't
find the star he looked for. Stray clouds had
covered the sky. The boat was being drawn
along at an unimaginable speed. It furrowed
through the water. There were no waves. The
sea was calm. But the sea had darkened and
assumed an ominous character. He looked
carefully at the water to find the direction of
the current. But he couldn't judge it, however
hard he tried.
The shark was pulling the boat with the
speed of wind. Where was it going? How far
had he gone?
Palani cried out.
"Stop, stop there. Stop before you drag me
to the palace of the sea goddess".
He pulled hard at the line. Suddenly the
boat stopped. Then Palani laughed wildly.
"Ha ha hastop there like that".
A short distance away from the boat the
fish was charging in its death throes. Once
more Palani, excited, pulled the line. The fish
jumped up and fell into the sea again. Though
the boat seemed motionless, Palani realized
that it had been caught up in a current and
was drawing a pattern on the expansive sea.

<![CDATA[
The current was going round and round in
circles. Again Palani watched it carefully. Was
he caught in a whirlpool? He was sure now
that he was going round in a wide circle. But
he held the line firmly. Palani looked up at
the sky. There wasn't a single star to be seen.
He stood in his boat and looked all round
him. He could only see the sea round him.
But now the water was assuming a different
contour. Now it seemed that all around him
was a mountain, a circular mountain of water.
He and his boat were in a depression. The
head of the boat seemed to rise.
The palace of the goddess of the sea was
at the bottom of the deep sea. There the sea
goddess was enshrined. Palani had heard
descriptions of that palace. He had to get there
through a whirlpool, a whirlpool which made
the whole sea churn round in circles, knock¬
ing at the gates of the sea goddess' abode. Pala¬
ni thought that the mountains encircling him
were getting taller and taller. He loosened the
line a little. Again the boat speeded forward.
From somewhere Palani heard a terrifying
roar. He had never heard a noise like that. It
was a storm rising.
The waves rose as high as a mountain.
Close on one after the other the waves rose.
Palani had never seen the like of such waves.
Those waves were not moving in lines. They
were rising all round him in a circle, the two
ends joining and making a pattern. Palani
looked round him and studied in a moment
the nature of that spectacular angry sea. He
knew how to ride his boat over the waves.
And he knew too how to join forces with a
storm. He had sailed a boat on the darkest of
dark nights.
There was a bright flash of lightning, fol¬
lowed by terrifying thunder. Palani let loose
the line. If he held fast the line and the boat
stopped, the boat would be smashed. He let
the fish pull the boat as it liked.
When the head of the boat mounted the
crest of the high waves, he balanced himself
with the aid of his oar and jumped upward
so as to lighten the weight of the boat. When
he reached the top, the boat again suddenly
came down. The boat became almost vertical.
Then there was another huge wave ready to
swallow up the boat with its gaping mouth.
The sea roared. It roared -with its anger
against that poor fisherman. The storm
provided a drone for that roar. The thunder
provided the rhythm. What a terrible devil¬
ish dance it was. A minute human being.
Should the goddess of the sea unleash such a
fury to smash him? How quickly could she
drag him to her depths if she wanted.
Perhaps these huge waves were making
their way to the shore. Perhaps they were rid¬
ing over the houses on the beach. Perhaps
poisonous sea snakes were crawling over the
beach. In the distance something rose very
high. Was it the crest of some spectacular high
wave, or was it some sea monster raising his
head with gaping mouth like a cave? Was it
that poor fisherman's spirit being broken?
Palani tried to jump over the wave. But he
couldn't rise high. That huge gaping wave
went right over him and his boat.
Not only had the clouds covered the sky
with thunder and lightning, the very sky
seemed to split. All the water in the sea seemed
to have gathered in one spot. The storm
roared as if it was going to smash all. Yet the
head of the boat could be seen over the crest
of still another wave. When that had passed,
Palani was clinging to the boat, now turned
upside down. In a second he found his breath
and shouted.
"Karuthamma!"
Palani's cry rose above the roar of the
storm.
Why did he cry out for Karuthamma? The
guardian angel of the fisherman at sea is his
wife at home. He was begging her to pray for
his safety. Didn't the first fisherman come safe¬
ly home in spite of the storm because of the
power of a fisherwoman's prayer? Palani, too,
believed he could be saved. He had a wife. She
would pray for him. Hadn't she given him her
word even the night before?
The fury of the storm increased. Palani
fought it. But it joined forces with the waves.
Another huge wave came rolling. By the time
he could say "Karu" the wave had rolled on.
There was nothing to be seen. The storm
and the thunder and the lightning joined
together in the destruction.
The water churned devilishly and blew up
to the skies.
The whole sea became a kind of cave. The
storm became an entity. The boat reappeared
on top of the waves. Palani was lying on top
of it. He was clinging to it.
Wouldn't that merciless slaughter ever end?
The boat then got caught up in a whirl¬
pool and sank like a stone.
One single star came out and shone. It was
the fisherman's Arundhati , the star which
showed them their way, but that night the star
seemed to lack in lustre.
The next morning day dawned on the calm
sea as if nothing had happened. Some of the
fishermen said that there had been a great
storm in mid-ocean during the night. The
waves came right up to the front of some of
the houses. And there were sea snakes to be
seen on the white sands. Panchami stood on
the seashore, the tears running down her
cheeks. The baby in her arms was crying bit¬
terly for her father and mother. Palani, who
had gone out fishing the evening before, had
not come home. Karuthamma was not to be
seen.
Panchami wept and as she wept she tried
to comfort the baby.
Two days later the bodies of a man and
woman locked in embrace were washed on the
shore. They were the bodies of-Pareekutti and
Karuthamma.
And at the Cheriyazhikkil seafront a dead
shark that had been baited was also cast on
the shore.
Arundhati was the symbol of chastity.
