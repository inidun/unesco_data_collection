With her jaunty air, tip-tilted nose and full lips, this Cretan girl painted 3,500 years ago in a
fresco on a wall of the palace of Knossos exudes youth and vitality. Her lively individuality
of expression has perhaps more than a suggestion of modern woman, intent on claiming
her rightful place in society. She may have been a lady at the court of the Cretan rulers,
whose palace was destroyed by fire around 1400 B.C. Though Cretan civilization then
declined, it had already exercised a powerful influence on ancient Greece, especially in the
field of art. The painting fragment is now in the museum at Iraklion, capital of Crete.

As the world's need for minerals Increases,
man faces a crucial problem of locating and
tapping new deposits of natural
resources such as Iron ore,
manganese, chrome, copper, gold, etc.
Our photo shows a piece of natural gold,
remarkable for its shape and size (enlarged
four times on cover). Discovered in central
Rumania, it is now in the Mineralogy Museum
of the University of Paris VI. The seas and
oceans contain vast reserves of minerals.
Scientists estimate that if all the gold
contained In sea water could be extracted,
there would be more than a ton for each
person in the world. See article page 27.

ARCHITECTURE

Kairouan, a central Tunisian city
founded in 670 A.D. Its cupola Is
typical of Islamic religious
architecture. Elsewhere in Tunisia, such
cupolas are found only on the
island of Djerba (see following

of traditional architecture in
village houses and other buildings.

The timeless art of building
in Tunisia: the first of a series
of Unesco studies on traditional
architecture in Africa and Asia
by Wolf Tochtermann
VERY part of the world has a ,
of architecture which is
rarely mentioned in encyclopaedias or
scholarly works and which is given
only marginal treatment in the history
of building and architecture. And yet
this traditional or indigenous architec¬
ture as it is sometimes called, boasts
an extraordinary wealth of expression,
that differs widely from country to
country.
It is not associated with any archi¬
tects, for the simple reason that archi¬
tects have had nothing to do with It
It Is not a product of the drawing-
WOLF TOCHTERMANN, German architect
and town-planner (Fed. Rep. of Germany) has
been in charge of Unesco's programme of
architecture and the environment in the Dept.
of Culture since 1969. He is concerned in
particular with the education of architects and
town planners and with research into traditional
architecture in the context of development.
board, nor does it follow the rules
and canons laid down and taught by
art schools and universities.
It is not only the fruit of ancient
traditions and the skill of its builder-
occupiers (for It is essentially "do-it-
yourself" building), but in every case
it mirrors the structure and way of life
of a specific society. Architecture of
this kind makes wise and efficient use
of available local materials, and is
perfectly adapted to climatic conditions.
It is only in the last few years per¬
haps since the famous 1964-65 exhi¬
bition organized by the New York
Museum of Modern Art on the theme
"Architecture without Architects" that
architects, weary of the "international
style", sociologists, ethnologists and
geographers have come to recognize
the importance of this hitherto un¬
known, or at least little-known, form
of architectural expression.

The few studies previously devoted
to the subject by a handful of specia¬
lists had had very little influence,' and
some specialists only began to show
an interest in the. conceptual originality
of this vernacular architecture when
they became aware of the dangers
Involved in the indiscriminate use of
an all-purpose style of architecture,
whose enthusiasts advocated its appli¬
cation in every latitude and climate.
It has been noted that buildings that
derive from rural traditions remain
extraordinarily efficient as dwellings,
because they are directly related to
an economy and a way of life still
very much- alive in many rural areas.
It is far easier to see the relationship
between environment and habitat in
these dwellings than In the case of
the big-city architecture of Western
countries.

Rhythm of undulating roofs
The low, flat island of Djerba in the
Gulf of Gabes (south east Tunisia)
has many gardens and orchards that
drink from thousands of wells and
storage tanks. A diversity of mosques,
(above and right) spread their admir¬
able architecture and blindingly white
outlines across its landscape. Vaulted
roofs give a particular rhythm to
Djerba's architecture. Some are
multi-domed, as on the public baths
seen at left. Standing among olive
groves and date palms are 2-storey
white houses also capped by cupolas.
The two small rooms are thus well
protected from heat and cold. The
layout of the traditional-style house
is designed above all to maintain the
intimacy of family life.

pression of these buildings are not
dictated by a striving for aesthetic
effects. They are determined by a
profound though often quite uncon¬
scious understanding of the landscape
and a judicious use of locally available
materials. The builder-occupier's con¬
struction reflects his social and cultural
needs and establishes a balance which,
however precarious, is nevertheless a
real one, between his dwelling and the
natural environment from which he has
to provide a shelter.
Yet today, this indigenous architec¬
ture, an expression of the outstand¬
ingly rich cultural heritage of many
countries in Asia, Africa, Latin Amer¬
ica and Europe, is seriously threaten¬
ed. Over the last few years many
splendid examples have disappeared
or are in the process of doing so.
Since it is basically a rural archi¬
tecture, its disappearance is geared
directly to the speed of urbanization
and the depopulation of rural areas, as
in villages in the valley of Verzasca
in southern Switzerland and Berber
villages in the south of Tunisia, among
many other places.
In 1973 Unesco launched a number
of studies on traditional architecture,
particularly in African countries (Tuni¬
sia, Cameroon, Ghana, Senegal, the
Central African Republic, the People's
Republic of the Congo). Further
studies are to be carried out in Asia.
Missions of architects have been
sent to various countries to carry out
surveys and prepare photographic and
written reports. Unesco intends to
publish all these works in a series
under the general title of Studies on
Traditional Forms of Architecture.
The first study in the series, pre¬
pared by a French architect, Claude
Perron, is devoted to Tunisia.
Situated between the Mediterranean
and the Sahara, Tunisia has been sub¬
jected to a wide variety of outside
influences, through its maritime links
with the countries of the Middle East
and of Europe, and its lines of commu¬
nication with Africa south of the
Sahara across the formidable yet by
no means impassable barrier of desert
wastes.
Tunisia has also known both the ebb
and flow of a nomadic population, at
certain times extending over a large
part of the country, and the growth of
settlements in areas with the most
favourable climatic conditions. The
impressive variety of Tunisian dwell¬
ing-places is thus largely explained by
these contrasting ways of life.
In his study, Claude Perron points
out that the history of North Africa Is
marked "by the struggle of the noma¬
dic peoples of the steppes and desert
against the settled populations of the
wealthy coastal areas and the oases."
This struggle has given birth to the
different types of houses found in
Tunisia.
Today, when nomadism is on the
wane and settlement is more wide¬
spread, the groups of tents that were
once set out so as to form temporary
villages have disappeared, although
the individual tent is still found In
almost every part of the country. In
some cases it serves as a kind of
annexe to the home of a newly-settled
family. The forms of these family
dwellings, like all traditional architec¬
ture, in Tunisia and elsewhere, are
determined by the nature of the local
terrain and the climate, the nature of
farming and animal rearing, historical
events such as occupation and outside
cultural influences, or sociological
factors such as the structure of family
and community life.
The author of the Tunisian study
describes many examples of huts
constructed of branches or reeds, of
circular houses with conical roofs, of
square or rectangular houses with
pointed or flat roofs. Some dwellings >
have attained their purpose to per- 1

Troglodyte
farms
and
herdsmen's
dwellings
One of southern Tunisia's most astonishing
landscapes is in the plain of Matmata which
runs to the foot of .the heights of Djebel
Dahar (above and left). People and animals
come and go across a lunar-like countryside
dotted with palms... and suddenly vanish as
if the earth had swallowed them. There is a
simple explanation. Having no hard and
durable building materials, the local people
have dug out homes (up to 50 metres long)
in the soft alluvial soil. Craters criss-crossing
the countryside are in fact patios around
which the rooms of the underground houses
are set. Round or square, and up to 8 metres
deep, the patios are reached via tunnels along
which stables for animals have been exca¬
vated. Cooking is done in the patio while
the rooms around it, white-washed and
shaped like the hull of a boat turned upside
down, are used as living quarters, store¬
houses or workshops. When the ground, is
suitable, houses also have a granary, with
access through a hole at ground level by means
of a rope or ladder of branches. These houses,
with their many amenities, cool in summer
and warm in winter, are still made by their
inhabitants. Communities of cattle breeders
and shepherds in the nearby mountains have
a different kind of architecture. Right, the
village of Toujane with its houses built of
stones from the rocky soil.

fection: various family-sized defensive
structures and highly functional dwell¬
ings such as the "menzels" on the
island of Djerba. Among the wide
variety of materials used are fabrics,
wood, matting of reeds and straw
and other materials derived from
plants, bricks of mud and earth and
unmortared stone.
The study examines not only indivi¬
dual buildings, but offers examples of
groups of dwellings set in compounds
or of villages each with installations
appropriate to their needs. In almost
every case the author shows that the
forms of traditional architecture are
not an accidental choice but on the
contrary are the logical answer to
certain specific needs, which can vary
from one region to another.
Why then is Unesco carrying out
these studies? They might quite justi¬
fiably have been undertaken to pre¬
pare for later work of preservation.
They might too have been considered
worthwhile from the viewpoint of
10
historical documentation. However,
Unesco's reasons for carrying out
these studies were quite different.
The world's population is likely to
double within the next thirty years if
the present rate of growth continues,
in which case additional housing will
need to be provided for 3 to 3.5 billion
persons. Since urban expansion is
far outpacing that of rural communities,
new technologies will have to be used
in order to meet this unprecedented
demand for housing more efficiently
and economically.
However, the building techniques
habitually used in Western style archi¬
tecture often call for materials which
are difficult to obtain in the developing
countries, and are therefore beyond
these countries' economic means.
Moreover, such materials are rarely
suited to the specific climatic, social
and cultural conditions in these
countries.
In future, therefore, there can be
no question of despising cheap build
ing materials such as clay bricks,
moulded clay or bamboo. Nor is
there any reason to consider traditional
building materials as a mark of under¬
development.
On the contrary, the merits of tradi¬
tional architecture must be made clear
to architects, urban planners and
government officials in order to pro¬
mote the rise of an architecture that
is not merely an imitation of Western
industrial construction. In the same
context, traditional architecture should
occupy an important place in the pro¬
grammes of architectural colleges in
the developing countries. The ren¬
aissance of this type of architecture
would also prevent the appearance of
shanty-towns and other blights of
urban housing.
It is with such needs in mind that
Unesco has launched its studies on
traditional architecture in different
parts of the world.

The citadel
granaries
The unusual structures shown here are
"ghorfas" (granaries) once used as store¬
houses for grain, oil and other produce
by the semi-nomadic peoples of southern
Tunisia farmers or shepherds according
to the season. Left in the care of a few
guardians for part of the year, ghorfas were
often built on rocky mountain spurs and
grouped defensively to form a "ksar" (the
Arabic word for fortress or citadel). Tiers
of ghorfas top the hill at Chenini (photo
left) and below them homes have been
hollowed out in softer ground. These par¬
ticular dwellings blend into and even accen¬
tuate the natural outlines of their setting.'
Fortified granaries are also found in the
plains of southern Tunisia as at Medenine
(below). They consist of small rectangular
cells with barrel vaults on which an identical
unit is often superimposed (right). Designed
for the needs of a semi-nomad way of life,
each cell held the food reserve for a single
family, during whose absence the entrance
was walled up. Buildings of great stylistic
beauty, the storehouses are mostly aban¬
doned nowadays although groups of them
have been converted into hotels.

The nomad builds his dwelling with the produce of his flocks sheep's wool and goat or dromedary
hair woven into long strips and sewn together into a large rectangle. With a few pieces of wood as
tent pegs and brushwood to make it draught-proof around the bottom, this mobile dwelling is quickly
erected and just as quickly taken down. It is easily transported by dromedary or donkey along with the
household utensils and the handsome carpets woven by womenfolk. Above, a traditional Tunisian tent
pitched with its entrance facing Mecca. In harmony with the landscape and solidly anchored to the
ground, the tent shown here is a habitat that serves its purpose to perfection. After crossing vast
windswept desert wastes, a traveller experiences a feeling of relief on reaching the oases of the Djerid
region of southern Tunisia. Below, a street in one of these oases, at Tozeur (12,000 inhabitants) whose
large houses are faced with straw coloured bricks. Openings of ventilation shafts for drying dates
Tozeur's main product are seen at top of photo. Right, aerial view of Thysdrus, an ancient Roman
city lying between Sousse and Sfax, and today called El Djem. Its enormous third century amphitheatre,
which could accommodate 60.000 persons, dominates the present city's typically Tunisian buildings. .

AMADOU MAHTAR
M'BOW
A PROFILE
OF THE
SIXTH DIRECTOR-GENERAL
OF UNESCO
by Pierre Kalfon
NINETEEN fifty-three. Senegal
is still a French colony. In the
village square at Badiana, deep in the
bush of the Casamance region, a man
addresses the villagers.
He speaks of the need to learn to
read and write, to observe simple rules
of hygiene in order to prevent disease;
he explains that green manuring yields
more rice, that animals should be
vaccinated and that infant mortality Is
not inevitable. He tells the villagers
not to be ashamed of Africa's past.
He speaks of dignity and hope. . .
If the assembled villagers listened
so intently, it was not only because
they were fascinated by . his words.
It was because this time it was a black
African, and not a Frenchman from the
town, speaking to them about them¬
selves in clear and simple terms. This
Senegalese, a graduate frpm the Sor¬
bonne, was a school teacher of a new
kind. His name was Amadou, Mahtar
PIERRE KALFON, French teacher and jour¬
nalist, has lived for many years in Latin Ame¬
rica, where between 1968 and 1973 he taught
French language and literature at the University
of Chile. Santiago,: and was also correspondent
of the French daily "Le Monde " and the weekly
" Le trouve! Observateur ". Author of an essay,
" Argentine " (Éditions du Seuil, Paris 1967),
he is currently at work on a thesis on the lit¬
erature of the pampas.
M'Bow. On November 14, 1974, he was
elected Director-General of Unesco
by the representatives of 135
countries assembled in Paris. He
had jumped a century.
Shortly after he was born in Dakar,
in 1921, his parents took him back to
Louga in the Sahel, where the rest
of the family lived, the extended
African family of uncles, aunts, grand¬
parents and cousins. There he grew
up, "learned about life", had brothers
and sisters to whom he was the elder
brother and, above all, first learned
from practical experience and later
from books, as Jean-Jacques Rous¬
seau once proposed. Louga was at
that time a small rural community
With a population of hardly more than
5,000, situated at the cross-roads of
the Wolof, Peul, Toucouleu and
Berber settlements of Senegal.
His father, who came from a village
near the coastal town of St. Louis, was,
like many other villagers, an artisan and
farmer. He worked hide and made
leather goods, cultivated his field, and
kept a few sheep, cattle and horses.
Ä devout and highly esteemed Moslem
who read the Koran and strictly
observed the fast of Ramadan, he
was respected as much for his moral
uprightness as for his imposing
physical stature. Visiting Senegalese
political leaders always stayed at his
house, and as a prominent local
figure, he had been a member of the
Senegalese delegation invited to
Paris for the Universal Exhibition in
1900.
Amadou Mahtar M'Bow spent his
childhood and adolescence in a pro¬
tected yet liberal atmosphere: he
played to his heart's content with the
other children of his age to the
rhythm of Wolof fable-songs, ab¬
sorbing his cultural heritage in this
way: he listened spellbound to the
legends and tales of marvellous hap¬
penings whose animal characters
parodied man, his faults and his
qualities.
He was brought up in the time-
honoured way by his mother and
aunts, until the age of seven or eight,
when the responsibility for his edu¬
cation fell to his father and mat¬
ernal uncle who initiated him in crafts
and farming skills, taught him to raise
animals, build huts, repair tools and,
above all, to discover and to love
nature.
"I knew the names of all the plants
and how to recognize those that
healed and those that killed", he
says, "and even here in Paris, I often

make herbal tea from African plants
which are sent to me." In fact,
years later his knowledge of agricul¬
ture was to astonish many an
agronomist.
The only constraint he knew was
the systematic memory-training, from
the age of five, which consisted of
learning by heart and reciting verses
from the Moslem Holy Book at the
Koranic School. "It is a school of
humility", he wrote. "Whatever his
status or background, the pupil must
be prepared to render such services
as fetching wood and water, working
the land or seeking donations for his
teacher. . ."
Between 1928 and 1930, a terrible
drought hit the Sahel, like the one of
recent years, in which thousands died
from starvation. But without radio or
television, this appalling situation went
unnoticed in the Western world.
Even as an adult, Amadou Mahtar
M'Bow was never to forget what he
had seen as a boy. He still talks
about it: "As a child, I lived with
hunger. I saw men and women die
for lack of food. For me hunger is no
rhetorical expression; one must have
lived through it to understand its
horror."
One day, when he was nearly nine,
"on a morning in November 1929, 1 was
taken by my father, who did not know
a word of French, to the French
regional school at Louga." Wearing
his long African boubou (he did not
exchange it for European dress until
he was seventeen), Amadou Mahtar
M'Bow spoke only Wolof like most
Senegalese. He also knew Pula the
language of the Peul people which
he picked up from his grandmother.
One wonders whether this is where
he became interested in history. Did
he learn it from a typical French
history textbook of the time which
always began, "Our ancestors, the
Gauls. . ."? One thing is certain.
Within his own family, his father and
uncles took it upon themselves to
teach him another history, in the oral
tradition, of the feats of his ancestors.
Louga, where his family lived, had
been part of the ancient kingdom of
Cayor where resistance against col¬
onial penetration had been at its
strongest in the 19th century.
Mr. M'Bow himself has stressed the
vital importance of this aspect of his
upbringing, and it explains his later
deep-rooted need to affirm his identity
as an African. "Many of us were
brought up on tales which were a far
cry from what was taught in the col¬
onial or mission schools."
At fourteen, he was awarded his
certificate of primary studies, no mean
feat considering that nine out of ten
African children dropped out of primary
school. Told that he was too old to
enter secondary school, he changed
to a higher primary school, took a
commercial course and got a job as
a clerk in the Governor of Dakar's
office. He was already organizing
a youth movement.
Then came World War II. He was
eighteen, thirsty for knowledge and
eager to fight oppression. He joined
the French Army as a volunteer. "I
felt I had a duty to accomplish as a free
man", he says. He embarked for
France, where he later witnessed the
horrors of war. He does not like to
talk about this period of his life:
"I am not a pacifist at any price", he
says, "but to me war is utterly absurd.
The next one will mean the end of
mankind."
After the debacle of 1940, he
returned to Senegal until the Allied
Forces landed in North Africa, in
November 1942, when he again joined
the French Forces and was assigned
to the Air Force school at Agadir, in
Morocco. He left there at the top of
his class, and a specialist in electrical .
aviation equipment. At the time, he r

hHHBt ^ was the only black sergeant with
specialized qualifications.
Demobilized in France in 1945, he
was determined to go on studying.
But first he had to find a way to get
into university. For two years, working
alone, he prepared both for his
Baccalauréat and for the entrance
examination to the engineering section
of the Breguet School of Electrical
Engineering, in Paris, where he was
admitted as a first-year student.
There were then few African students
in Paris, In the Latin Quarter. Amadou
Mahtar M'Bow was no run-of-the-mill
student. He was convinced that he
had to fight for the dignity of the
oppressed, and in particular the dignity
of the "black peoples", since they were
among the most oppressed.
It was during this post-war period
that Africans were discovering Aimé
Césaire, of Martinique, who had
coined the word "négritude" and
brandished it like a flag, long before
American blacks proclaimed "black is
beautiful". At that time, the poet
Leopold Sédar Senghor, Senegal's
future head of state, was the most
listened-to apostle of négritude. Jean-
Paul Sartre was writing a brilliant
preface to Senghor's "Anthology of
Black and Malagasy Poetry". Another
Senegalese, Alioune Diop, was de¬
fending Pan-Africanism in the magazine
Présence Africaine. . .
But for an African living abroad, in '
France, there were then three pri¬
orities crying for action: first, to
rediscover Africa's true identity,
second to rescue Africa's past from
colonial disdain, third to proclaim the
rich cultural heritage of the African
people.
Senegal was sorely In need of
technicians but it was even more in
need of people to awaken the African
conscience.
So, Mahtar M'Bow decided to return
to his own cultural roots, though not
empty-handed and not unprepared.
Rather than become an engineer-
technocrat, he chose as a Senegalese,
to become an African geographer and
historian. After taking his Bacca¬
lauréat at the age of 26, he entered
the Sorbonne. "There I learnt rigour
and method", he says, speaking of his
Marxist and non-Marxist mentors.
He quickly established himself in the
African community as an anti-col¬
onialist student leader. With friends
he organized a research group seeking
to reconcile the quest for African
cultural identity with Marx's principles
and the anti-imperialist struggle.
In 1948 he became President of the
Association of African Students in

Fishermen's boats on one of Senegal's vast Atlantic beaches
between Dakar and Saint-Louis.
Paris, and in 1950, President then
Secretary-General of the Federation
of Black African Students in France.
This organization was to be the well-
spring from which emerged the future
"intelligentsia" of all French-speaking
Africa. It was here that Mr. M'Bow
discovered the complex realities of
pressure groups and French political
and trade union movements.
Contrary to what sometimes .hap¬
pens, his militancy stimulated his
academic work. He quickly obtained
his licence degree, and even found
time to marry a geography student,
Raymonde, whom he met at the Sor¬
bonne. She was a Haitian, tall and
beautiful, a diplomat's daughter, and
a descendant of the African slaves
shipped to the Americas centuries ago.
Their marriage was the beginning of
a long and rewarding association: joint
publication of many works, and a close
family life, with three children.
When he left university, M'Bow was
offered a teaching job in France. He
refused and asked to return to his own
country. But because of his political
views, the authorities of French West
Africa preferred to keep him away
from the major centres. He was
appointed to the secondary school at
Rosso, a small isolated town in Mauri¬
tania, then a part of French West
Africa. "I was delighted", he recalls.
"I wanted to make contact with Africa
again and to be with African pupils.
I was just thirty, and the only black
secondary teacher in the Senegal-
Mauritania area. It was quite an
event."
- This. "event" was to last two years.
A singular spark fired the lessons of
this young teacher, but his pupils were
not aware that it came from a man
rediscovering himself.
Amadou Mahtar M'Bow did not
remain unnoticed in isolated Rosso for
very long. At that time, Unesco's
Director-General, Jaime Torres Bodet,
had proposed the setting up by Unesco
member countries of "fundamental
education programmes" to combat
illiteracy. The Rectorate of Dakar
called on Mr. M'Bow, because of his
experience as a teacher and also as
a Senegalese, to head a new depart¬
ment of fundamental education for the
whole of Senegal.
Then began a unique period in the
life of Amadou Mahtar M'Bow, "no
doubt the most inspiring and instruc¬
tive of my whole career", he says.
This was a far cry from the quiet
sinecure of a civil servant sitting
behind . his desk. For five exciting
years, from 1953 to 1957, accompanied
by a small team of African doctors,
veterinary personnel, student teachers,
farming specialists, radio and cinema
technicians, and sometimes even a car¬
penter and a mason, he travelled by
truck throughout the country.
He ate from the calabash pot with
the villagers, whose life he shared for
two or three months at a time. He
acquired a unique and detailed know¬
ledge of daily life in the villages of
Senegal. Under his direction, schools
were built, health centres opened,
midwives and nurses trained, agricul¬
tural co-operatives installed, chemical
fertilizers introduced. Everywhere he
strove to alleviate ignorance, disease
and misery, the afflictions of what was
already beginning to be called under¬
development.
The villagers were illiterate. But
"dignity comes through learning". The
history teacher became a simple pri¬
mary school teacher. Using French
and local dialect, he devised a
reading and writing method specially
adapted to his classes. His pupils,
of both sexes, were "aged from 6 to
60. "In Badiana, for the first time, a
literacy campaign included both men
and women. The villagers helped to
finish the ideographic alphabet; it
was stencilled and roneoed . . . The
simplicity of the method gave them ^
confidence. Those who had learned r

W'to read well were loudly applauded.
Evening sessions sometimes went on
far into the night. .
It is revealing to read the reports
written by Mr. M'Bow, Chief of Mission,
after expeditions to places such as
Badiana, Dembakane, Senoudébou,
Mangaroungou, or Gaya. . . The fifty
close-written pages are not only a
sociological study of life in a Sene¬
galese village twenty years ago, but
also, despite the deliberately im¬
personal style, an adventure story of
a handful of men working together to
bring African villagers into the modern
world.
Between missions, however, Mahtar
M'Bow found time to participate
actively in the political life of his
country. His name became known as
that of an opposition leader whose
views commanded respect. First he
was a member of an independent group
of intellectuals which, in 1955, united
with the Democratic Coalition, led by
Leopold Senghor, to later form, with
the Senegalese Union for Progress,
the Senegalese People's Coalition.
In 1957, France beaan its decol¬
onization process and installed Sene¬
gal's first semi-autonomous govern¬
ment. Mr. M'Bow was appointed the
first Minister of Education and Culture.
Once again, he travelled through the
bush, built additional schools and set
up the first post primary classes, so
that more children could go on to
secondary education.
In 1958, General de Gaulle, on
assuming power, asked the French
African territories if they would
agree to form a Community linked to
France. Some said "Yes". Others,
with M'Bow, replied "No", and called
for immediate independence. When
the views of the former prevailed,
M' Bow, who had resigned to fight his
campaign, returned to secondary
teaching, with his wife, at St. Louis, in
Senegal, at the same Lycée Faidherbe
which had turned him down as a pupil.
This time, it was as an influential
opposition leader in the African Re-
groupment Movement that he patiently
took up the struggle again. His pro¬
gressive nationalism won him esteem
abroad, especially when Senegal
finally gained independence in 1960.
He travelled a lot, made many
contacts, published several books
aimed at making Africa better known
to the world at large and also school
textbooks designed to impress on
African children the richness and
diversity of their continent. But he
remained a teacher at heart.
The new Africa needed highly quali¬
fied personnel. In many countries,
Unesco launched the idea of teacher
training colleges to train such person¬
nel, and M'Bow was called on to teach
in one of these colleges in Dakar.
In 1966, Senegal's economy de¬
pended on one crop, the ground-nut.
An economic crisis loomed; the huge
port of Dakar stood empty. President
Senghor asked the opposition to
collaborate with him. It accepted,
hoping to implement its own proposed
reforms from the inside.
Amadou Mahtar M'Bow once again
became Minister of Education and with
Leopold Senghor's accord began the
"Africanization" of the university. He
himself presided over the commission
which drew up the first Senegalese
alphabet based on the phonetic tran¬
scription of the six Senegalese
languages, including Wolof. From
then on the teacher and the political
leader in M'Bow we're to become one.
When the 1968 wave of student
revolt in the world hit Dakar, M'Bow
tried to avoid a head-on confrontation
and succeeded in keeping the dis¬
cussion open with the student body
whose motives he fully understood.
Following this he was made Minister
of Youth and Culture, a post he held
until 1970, when in a cabinet reshuffle
he again left the Government.
P
| ^mY that time he had come to be
as "elder brother" by
many of his fellow Africans. In 1966
and again in 1968 he headed the
Senegal Delegations to two Unesco
General Conferences. Since 1966 he
had been a member of Unesco's
Executive Board. He also became
chairman of the African group of
Unesco's Member States and of the
group of 77 countries representing the
Third World.
In November 1970, Unesco's Direc¬
tor-General, René Maheu, offered him
the key post of Assistant Director-
General in charge of Education.
This post, calling for administrative
and diplomatic qualities, permitted
Mr. M'Bow to gain a detailed know¬
ledge of the educational developments
in every part of the world.
At Unesco's Paris headquarters and
"in the field", M'Bow's tall, well-built
figure soon became a familiar sight.
He was known for his frank, open
manner, his simple and direct method
of speaking. Possessed of a phenom¬
enal memory, he spoke with an
assurance that comes from knowing
every detail of a project. He came to
be recognized as the man who
preferred to settle questions rapidly by
direct personal contact rather than
through red tape or lengthy bureau¬
cratic procedures.
He owes to his African village back¬
ground and long experience a feeling
for conciliation invaluable for solving
harmoniously the thorniest problems.
"We have never seen him lose his
temper", say his colleagues, "but while
he readily shows confidence in others,
woe betide anyone who lets him
down."
Now a vigorous 53, with a capacity
for work that astonishes everyone,
Amadou Mahtar M'Bow has no illusions
about the job ahead. He knows, it
will be tough, but he also knows
how much Unesco can do to help
countries free themselves from ignor¬
ance and poverty. Knowing Unesco
well and believing wholeheartedly in
its objectives,, he intends to infuse it
with fresh vigour and give it a new style.
"I should be delighted indeed to
listenas we do under the baobab
tree in Africa to all points of view and
to find a solution acceptable to all. . .",
he says. "I am a little wary of a
universalistic humanism which often
masks Eurocentrism. I prefer plural¬
ism, which accepts the distinctive
identity of each people. I was brought
up to accept differences in a spirit of
tolerance. I am the brother of every
human being, whatever his or her race,
whatever his or her belief, and
wherever he or she may live. This is
the first stepping stone for building
true solidarity between all peoples.
With René Maheu, Unesco's former
Director-General, a whole generation
of the early pioneers of the Organ¬
ization is disappearing. They were
dedicated men and women who often
came from the Western world. With
Amadou Mahtar M'Bow, a black
African who stands at the cross-roads
of several civilizations and rejects
neither his past under a colonial
regime nor his European university
background, a new generation of men
and women is emerging in the train
no doubt of the present acceleration
of history.
The path that led the country boy
from the African Sahel to head one
of the most important organizations of
the United Nations system perhaps
marks a turning point in the emergence
of this other world, long oppressed,
despised or disregarded the world of
the disinherited peoples. "I feel that
I am today the symbol of these
peoples", Amadou Mahtar M'Bow said
on taking office, on November 15, 1974.
In choosing him as Director-General
for six years, Unesco has entered the
21st century.

UNESCO 1975-1976
Unesco's General Conference, meeting in Paris from October
17 to November 23, 1974, adopted Unesco's programme and bud¬
get ($169,992,000) for 1975-1976, and elected its new Director-
General, Mr. Amadou Mahtar M'Bow (see profile, page 14).
In this eight-page supplement, the "Unesco Courier" publishes
salient passages from speeches made by Mr. M'Bow on taking
office on November 15, 1974, (below) and at the closing session
of the General Conference on November 23, 1974 (see page 21).
The supplement also presents major new activities which Unesco
will undertake in 1975 and 1976, (see boxes, pages 20-26).
An age of solidarity
or
An age of barbarism ?
by Amadou Mahtar M'Bow
Director-General of Unesco
Q
_^^INCE each of us is marked by the age in which
^a^»^he lives, by the environment into which he was
born and in which he grew up and by the experience
which he has accumulated, it is first of all in the spirit
of the African people, and in their wisdom, that I shall
find guidance for my actions.
When I speak of the people of Africa, this is not
some abstract image, but a reality which I have exper¬
ienced and in which I have fully shared. My presence
at the head of this Organization is merely the conse¬
quence of the profound changes which have taken
place in that vast continent since the present century
began.
Yes, I grew up with Africa, suffering its pains, feeling
its anguish, sharing its aspirations. The lesson I learned
there was the lesson of determination to root oneself
in the traditional environment ; in accepting the funda¬
mental values of that environment, we accepted our
responsibilities as free beings in a dominated society,
for what we had to preserve was freedom of the spirit,
in which lies the true meaning of dignity. We never felt
hatred in our hearts, even in times of conflict, because
we never lost hope in mankind...
The inevitable choice facing mankind is between
entering an age of solidarity or relapsing into an age
of barbarism. Solidarity means firstly the acceptance
of differences, whether they are biological in origin
or the product of geography and history. It means
the renunciation of all notions of hierarchy among peo¬
ples and nations. It means the abandonment, once and
for all, of the view of history long held by those who,
from Ancient Greece and Rome down to the age of
modern imperialisms, have always confused civilization
with power, reducing to the status of "barbarians" the
subjugated peoples as well as those who rejected their
yoke.
But solidarity means something more. It calls for
an effort to rise above our differences in order to
build, on a world-wide scale, a new economic, social
and cultural order which, transcending national self-in¬
terests, will enable man to organize his environment
rationally, so that each of us may live there freely and
happily, in brotherhood with his neighbours, whoever
they may be.
It is to be feared that the only alternative is barbarism,
for the balance of terror and the rising tide of inequal¬
ities may lead to those final confrontations after which
nothing will remain but ruin and desolation: the destruc-

. tion of all that human genius has helped to create over
so many centuries.
Even if peace were assured, failure to make wise
use of the power conferred on us by science would
pose no less a threat. Man's capacity to calculate and
to inquire has today expanded to the point at which
he is able to study both the infinitely small and the
infinitely great. Whether he penetrates the mysteries
of genetics or escapes from gravity to explore outer
space, whether he pursues the study of the microcosm,
dividing particles which only yesterday seemed indivi¬
sible, or sets out in conquest of the universe, man
indeed appears to stand on the threshold of a new
age, as if the combined fruits of two centuries of scien¬
tific progress were on the point of freeing him from all
his bonds.
But were science to be diverted from its highest
goal and placed at the service of evil, it too might well
imperil mankind's very existence, or at any rate enslave
humanity in new forms of bondage, worse perhaps than
any which it has known throughout its history.
It is true that scholars and scientists in many countries
are each face to face with his own conscience reflec¬
ting on the true meaning of their work and on the final
aims of science. Unesco cannot stand aside from
this debate, any more than it can remain indifferent
to whatever bears on the progress and the destiny of
mankind.
Its responsibility is all the greater since no organiza¬
tion is better placed to mobilize the intellectual resour¬
ces which both reflection and action demand. The
ambition of its new Director-General is to stimulate a
vast movement in which scholars from all horizons and
all disciplines may participate in a joint, world-wide
effort of meditation on the problems of the evolution
of our civilizations.
Since its foundation in 1946, Unesco has followed
a long and difficult path, facing countless problems
and passing through a number of world political crises
with their tensions and confrontations. Today its Mem¬
ber States, all its Member States, must endeavour to
understand that Unesco can carry out its mission only
in an atmosphere of serenity, and frank and patient
dialogue.
In the period of unprecedentedly rapid change through
which the world is passing, Unesco must constantly
review its objectives and its methods, in order to meet
the imperatives of new situations. In many spheres, this
sustained effort of renewal and adjustment has made it
possible to deepen and broaden a programme of action
for which, by reason of its universality, there is still no
substitute in the modern world.
Admired by some, criticized by others, at times misun¬
derstood, Unesco exists because of the part taken in
its work by its 135 Member States, whose participation
bears witness to the faith and hope that mankind as a
whole places in it. So a heavy responsibility is invol¬
ved in everything connected with the preparation and
execution of Unesco's programme, which demand an
unremitting effort of self-criticism, evaluation of the
results achieved, and an open-minded, imaginative out¬
look on the future.
Ethical action, the promotion of knowledge, with all
the exchanges it involves, and aid for development,
cannot be considered in isolation from one another
without a risk of divesting Unesco of one of the reasons
for its existence.
While ethical objectives reflect the Organization's
loyalty to one of its foremost tasks, which is to lay
down universal standards applicable to all because
they are freely accepted by all, the promotion and dis¬
semination of knowledge represent the prime source of
progress.
But human destiny cannot be dissociated either from
the development of society of all societies; there
is no society in the world today which is not in some
way having to face development problems. Special
attention must certainly be given to the needs of the
most seriously deprived peoples.
It is shocking and unjust that hundreds of millions
of human beings are suffering the humiliations of disease,
illiteracy and hunger, and are thus being deprived of
what is indispensable to human dignity, when one thinks
of the colossal waste which is a feature of certain
societies.
If it is not to fail in its mission, Unesco must do more,
and do it more effectively, to help the underprivileged.
And so we must make a determined effort to modernize
our methods for planning and carrying out all our acti¬
vities. . .
Each period of history has its underlying trends, its
lines of force, marking its significance and its distinc¬
tive character. Today more than ever, an organiza¬
tion such as Unesco cannot afford to trail world events;
it must resolutely take its proper place in the vanguard
of the double movement of emancipation and unification
of peoples which is the outstanding feature of our time.
I wish to address an appeal to Unesco's Member
States, and, through them, to all men and women in
every country of the world, to redouble their efforts to
encourage all those for whom the happiness and well-
being of others are more than empty words to rally
to Unesco in a great movement of universal solidarity.
Forum for the global exchange of ideas and fraternal
association of peoples, Unesco must continue to be the
ultimate hope for peace and understanding, in a world
which now, for better or worse, possesses tremendous
technical powers.
The task before us is to see to it that each day the
meaning of justice and truth is more clearly perceived,
to combat all that abases man physically and intellec¬
tually poverty, ignorance and inequalities and cons¬
traints in all their forms and to free him from the
often overwhelming pressures of exploitation, alienation
and mechanization which tend to reduce him to the status
of an object.
If the goal at times seems far distant and our quest
an arduous one, it is because the true achievement
of our purpose would mean nothing less than an ethical
revolution through which all mankind may be assured of
full development. I remain convinced and this convic¬
tion will underlie all my work in the service of Unesco,
in the years ahead, and be an unfailing source of hope
and energy that hatred and misunderstanding can be
overcome in the unity which is forged when ideals
freely accepted by all are finally put into practice, and
that man will one day succeed, as we read in the
Vedas, in "overcoming hatred by love, and falsehood
by truth..."

A greater need
than ever
for tolerance
and understanding
WE do not live in an
ideal world and it
would be vain to seek to idealize
it. That the world is often torn by
political, economic and social con¬
flicts is the patent reality of today.
But this reality forces us with¬
out denying any of the contra¬
dictions of our times and without
giving up truth and justice as the
basis for our action to seek to
rise above the tensions and con¬
flicts of today if we genuinely wish
to act in conformity with the prin¬
ciples of our Constitution.
I wish to make another urgent
appeal for tolerance and under¬
standing. In the future we should
try, even if at first it seems impos¬
sible to do so, to achieve through
patient dialogue the consensus
which should be the golden rule
in an institution such as this.
Admittedly, this calls for quiet,
patient and unflagging efforts and
for mutual concessions. It is by
this means that the moral autho¬
rity of our Organization can be
strengthened. I am firmly resolved
to speak out on important inter¬
national questions each time and
whenever I. deem it necessary in
order to reconcile conflicting
points of view and in order to
reach the broadest possible
agreement.
One thing strikes me immedia¬
tely: the importance that the Gen¬
eral Conference as a whole has
given to Unesco's ethical action,
particularly its efforts to contri¬
bute (in its fields of competence)
to the effective application of hu¬
man rights, the maintenance of
peace and the development of
understanding among peoples.
Unesco's action for peace must
be pursued on two fronts : first,
against all forms of oppression
and discrimination which endanger
peace and international security
and are a denial of human dignity;
and second, support for the forces
of progress, freedom, justice and
mutual respect among nations.
In this respect the General Con¬
ference has repeatedly stressed
that justice is directly linked with
the concept of social progress
and that equity must govern rela¬
tions between both individuals and
nations.
With these imperatives in mind,
Unesco will do its utmost, during
the next two years, to ensure that
the combined resources of res¬
earch, education and communi¬
cation make a more effective con¬
tribution to promoting the right to
education, science and culture.
As the United Nations agency
pledged to uphold the highest in¬
tellectual and spiritual values,
Unesco will also see to it that this
vigorous and sustained effort
extends beyond its own spheres
of competence to embrace the
whole range of human rights and
fundamental freedoms.
Unesco's determination to com¬
bat the inequalities which deprive
vast numbers of the world's people
of the right to education has been
the guiding principle for plan¬
ning many of Unesco's activities
in education. Although Unesco
can contribute only indirectly to¬
wards removing the social bar¬
riers which many delegations
have denounced as a major cause
of the inequalities in education,
through its programme for equal
access to education it is directly
attacking specific forms of discri¬
mination against women and girls
(who make up half of humanity), ^
migrant workers and their fami- r

INTERNATIONAL
WOMEN'S
YEAR
Designated as International Women's
Year by the United Nations General
Assembly, 1975 will mark a turning
point in the struggle to end
discrimination against women. The
United Nations has established three
themes for International Women's
Year:
the promotion of equality between
men and women;
the integration of women into
development;
recognition of women's increasing
contribution to strengthening world
peace.
Unesco's contribution to the
achievement of United Nations
objectives for International Women's
Year will include the following
activities:
Education
International meeting, in 1976
(in co-operation with the International
Labour Organization) on educational
and vocational guidance and job
opportunities open to women. It will
study ways of integrating women
into economic, social and cultural
development and of promoting equal
access to education.
Study on working mothers and on
solutions adopted in different
countries to problems of educating
pre-school-age children.
Meeting of women holding major
posts in Unesco Member States on
the theme " Exchange and co-operation
between women in different countries".
Inquiry into recent steps taken by
governments in different parts of the
world for the advancement of women
in such fields as education,
employment, social welfare, family
planning, legal status, etc.
Two major programmes to develop
women's technical education in rural
areas, in the Central African Republic
and Mauritania.
Promotion of equal access for
women to all literacy programmes.
Social sciences
Research on the changing role of
men and women in family and
community life.
Study on the image of women
presented in school text-books.
Study on how women can contribute
to the strengthening of peace.
Information
Study on the effectiveness of mass
communications (radio, television,
etc.) in the education of women.

lies, refugees, and people strug¬
gling for their independence.
In addition, there are other
Unesco activities which can be
said to fall into this same cate¬
gory, aimed at removing obstacles
or changing conditions which
hamper equal access to education
for all. These include educational
programmes for rural develop¬
ment and literacy and adult edu¬
cation programmes, all of which
have been given priority status
by Unesco's General Conference.
In many countries, the econo¬
mic and social inequalities that
exist between urban and rural
areas are tantamount to discrimi¬
nation in education for millions of
rural children and young people.
In the years ahead, therefore, we
must step up our efforts in edu¬
cation for rural development.
Because it is so widespread
and has such profoundly negative
effects on the development of the
individual and the community,
illiteracy remains one of the ma¬
jor evils of the twentieth cen¬
tury. Its persistence its actual
increase, when reckoned in abso¬
lute figures makes it one of the
most formidable challenges that
the international community must
take up if the future of mankind is
not to be seriously compromised.
If Unesco's action in this res¬
pect has perhaps not yet been as
fully effective as one could wish,
this is mainly because the prime
factor in attacking this problem is
national determination, since only
governments are able to bring
about the kind of total mobiliz¬
ation of a country's resources
without which literacy campaigns
are doomed to failure.
Adult education too is a power¬
ful force in the democratization of
education, and one of the main
links in lifelong education. It is for
these reasons that the General
Conference has asked that Unes¬
co's activities aimed at correcting
the imbalance found in many edu¬
cation systems should be con¬
tinued and intensified, in line with
the recommendations of the Third
International Conference on Adult
Education, held in Tokyo, since
this imbalance is detrimental to
adult education which has its own
objectives, content and methods.
In recent years, the idea of life¬
long education has become one
of the key-features of Unesco's
programme... I think it will be pos¬
sible to free the concept of life¬
long education both from the un¬
duly restrictive definitions some
people have tended to give it and
from the equally dangerous risk
of vagueness which all too often
deprives general concepts of any
real content, so that its full scope
and living reality may be clearly
seen.
Unesco's programme for science
and technology has been reinforc¬
ed in the past few years, although
its scope is perhaps not yet as
broad as it should be.
As regards the spread of scien¬
tific knowledge, I welcome the
support given to the UNISIST pro¬
gramme since the exchange of
scientific and technological infor¬
mation is of fundamental impor¬
tance for the progress of both the
industrialized and the developing
countries. But the developing
countries still need to be able to
make use of such knowledge in
ways that they themselves choose.
It is with this in mind that we
shall continue to aid Member
States whenever they ask for as¬
sistance in formulating science and
technology policies appropriate to
their development needs.
Regarding human resources in
science and technology, you have
adopted a recommendation on
the status of scientific research
workers, the application of which
should give positive results. We
shall also try to facilitate contacts
between research workers and
institutes, particularly on a re¬
gional basis.
I also note with satisfaction the
importance accorded to science
and technology training program¬
mes at all levels. Training scien¬
tists, engineers and technicians is
still a crucial problem for most
developing countries. For this
reason, we must step up our
efforts in this field too, giving
special emphasis to the quality of
such training.
Our post-graduate training pro¬
grammes have an important func¬
tion and meet real needs. We
shall try to strengthen this part
of our programme, particularly in
the developing countries; and I
should like to thank those States
which have arranged for their
institutions to provide post-gradu¬
ate courses.
I wish to say a few words about
"transfers of technology" al¬
though, in fact, I prefer the term
"development of appropriate tech¬
nologies". Some countries have
fallen into what may be called
"technological traps". Imitating
others, they have adopted tech¬
niques which call for considerable
capital, costly equipment and fo¬
reign specialists, and which are
not really suited to their needs.
It would nevertheless be absurd
to reject any innovation from ano-

ther country or even to refrain
from using advanced technologies
whenever the right conditions can
be fully met. I think that one of
Unesco's functions should indeed
be to assist Member States which
seek such aid to find the right
path, particularly by promoting the
pooling of ideas, information and
experience and by helping to
launch pilot projects that can be
further developed.
While it is true that many coun¬
tries seeking to further their dev¬
elopment still lack the necessary
scientific and technological know¬
ledge, it is also true that, on a
global scale, we have both the
knowledge and the resources with
which to banish hunger, cure
disease, and remedy poverty and
injustice. What we lack is an ethic
which provides an alternative to
the egoistic or uncontrolled and
intimidating application of science
and technology, a humanitarian
and humanizing ethic which can
guide the thinking and purpose
of men and women towards more
fraternal and more universal aims.
While certain parts of the pro¬
gramme for the social sciences,
humanities and culture, were
approved unanimously, others in
some cases gave rise to widely
diverging opinions. This occurred,
in particular, when ideological
differences brought to light dif¬
ferent interpretations of economic
or social and cultural questions
which the social sciences cannot
as yet analyse objectively, for
want of scientific tools that would
enable us to reach a universal
consensus.
Thus, any action that enables
the social sciences to contribute
to the development of scientific
methods whose usefulness and
objectivity are universally accepted
would be both justified and bene¬
ficial. And at the same time as
such methods are improved,
efforts must be continued to make
better use of them. In saying this
I have in mind both the developed
countries, with their specialists
whose goal will always be to
seek perfection, and the develop¬
ing countries, where the main
emphasis must be placed on basic
training by means provided for in
one of the resolutions adopted by
the General Conference.
However, over and above these
specific activities, the role that
the social sciences play or will
play in Unesco's programme has
been considerably expanded. It
has been rightly pointed out that
the social sciences are at the
crossroads of numerous activities,
of which the problems of peace,
of development or of the estab¬
lishment of a new international
order are only three examples.
The social sciences should provide
the thinking which precedes action
and then enriches it.
Similar observations could be
made concerning culture. Today ^
there is a growing awareness that r

culture is ah integral part of over¬
all development. This situation
is not without its dangers, as I
have already said in speaking of
the relationship between cultures,
which are sometimes fragile, and
technologies which are often reck¬
lessly imported. The only way to
transform this fragility into
strength may be through the plann¬
ing of cultural policies in harmony
with policies for education and
science. If these three compo¬
nents are integrated, each will be
strengthened by the contributions
and support of the others.
I shall not examine in detail the
numerous activities which you
have approved, such as the pres¬
ervation and development of
national cultural heritages, the res¬
titution of cultural property to its
country of origin, the preservation
of historic quarters, towns and
sites in places where moderniza¬
tion is in many cases intrusive, or
man in his environment in con¬
nexion with the Man and the Bio¬
sphere Programme. Yet the fact
that I mention these activities only
briefly in no way detracts from
their importance nor from the
attention I intend to give to them.
It was gratifying to find so many
speakers contributing to the Gen¬
eral Conference discussions on the
programme for free flow of infor¬
mation since access to information
is vital both to the strengthening
of international understanding and
to the development of science and
technology. However, in this field
as in many others, a certain laxity
of language can be harmful.
Information may appear differ¬
ently to those who communicate
it and those who receive it. The
former see it as a service they
are providing, whereas for the
latter it is or it may appear to be
an intrusion upon their environ¬
ment or their privacy. Freedom to
circulate information may become
a pretext for exercising pressure,
and this raises the problem of the
content of information.
You were therefore right in
emphasizing that the free flow of
information, which has its rightful
place in Unesco's Constitution,
must be a two-way flow, and be
regarded as an exchange, if in this
field too we are to avert a division
of the world into producers and
passive consumers. In this respect
the adoption of a code of ethics
for journalists, which has been
proposed, could become the coun¬
ter-balance to an ill-defined free¬
dom of the press. Many other
problems are inextricably bound
up with the free flow of informa¬
tion. One example is the shortage
of newsprint and the control of
its production in a manner pre¬
judicial to certain countries, parti¬
cularly the least developed, as is
the case today.
Intellectual co-operation which
was the very root of Unesco, since
our Organization was in a real
sense the successor to the League
of Nations Institute of Intellectual
Co-operation, remains one of the
principal reasons for Unesco's
existence even if, as a result of
changes in the world, the Organi¬
zation has gradually extended its
activities to new fields. Today,
intellectual co-operation is truly
the source and the fundamental
condition of all international action
for progress.
Without a global exchange of
ideas, human knowledge would
not achieve that universality which
not only puts it in its true perspec¬
tive and enriches it, but at the
same time enables it to be used
for the benefit of the world com¬
munity. To appreciate the true
value of the communication of
knowledge, one need only think
of the injustice caused in the field
of science, for example, by the
monopolization of knowledge for
the benefit of the few, the threats
to international peace and security
to which this may give rise, and
the obstacles to progress which it
creates.
Unesco's record in intellectual
co-operation is outstanding and is
widely known. I shall try to
broaden this basic activity still
further, steering it when neces¬
sary in new direction's.
I think that Unesco, whose vo¬
cation it is to be one of the cen¬
tres of universal thinking, should
call more frequently on the great
figures of the world intellectual
community philosophers, histor¬
ians, men of letters, scientists,
specialists and research workers in
all disciplines and of all schools,
artists and sculptors to reflect
together on certain major prob¬
lems of our time. I intend shortly
to set up a working group of this
type, whose members could give
useful advice on certain aspects
of Unesco's role in the coming
years.
We ought .also to stimulate in¬
ternational co-operation among
the major research institutions by
encouraging the development of
fundamental and applied research
at national level in the various
branches of knowledge. I think,
in fact, that we should get the
]]>

most influential institutions in the
world to participate closely in the
execution of Unesco's programme,
as part of a mobilization of the
world scientific community to
serve mankind and especially the
developing countries.
I should like to emphasize here
the crucial role which Unesco's
National Commissions must play
by initiating .and stimulating in¬
tellectual co-operation among the
various national institutions. Simi¬
larly, I think that the trend which
has developed in recent years
towards entrusting certain pro¬
gramme activities, such as studies
or research, to non-governmental
organizations, deserves to be en¬
couraged as it has frequently pro¬
duced excellent results.
Inter-university co-operation,
which we chiefly promote through
the International Association of
Universities, is of course one of
the fundamental forms of intellec¬
tual co-operation.
In this connexion, we expect a
great deal from the initial work of
the European Centre for Higher
Education in Bucharest and from
the similar centres soon to be
established in Latin America and
the Arab countries. Moreover, the
conclusion of agreements bet¬
ween States, modelled on the
Mexico City Convention on the
recognition of studies, diplomas
and degrees in higher education,
should infuse fresh life into in¬
tellectual co-operation by encou¬
raging the movement of students
and teachers and the pooling of
ideas...
I view with great hope the activi¬
ties of the United Nations Univer¬
sity which will shortly begin. Con¬
ceived as an "international com¬
munity of scholars engaged in
research, post-graduate training
and dissemination of knowledge",
the United Nations University will
study from an interdisciplinary
standpoint the urgent problems
posed by the survival, develop¬
ment and welfare of mankind.
But as well as offering unprece¬
dented opportunities for throwing
light on these problems through
the combined intellectual efforts of
the international community's most
eminent institutions and persona¬
lities, the United Nations Univer¬
sity will also help to strengthen the
solidarity of the world community
and stimulate the flow of ideas, in
particular by endeavouring as
laid down in its Charter to "alle¬
viate the intellectual isolation of
members of academic and scien¬
tific communities in the developing
countries". We may thus hope
that in addition to being a symbol
of the universality of thought and
an international intellectual centre,
the university will be a powerful
force for international rapproche¬
ment and understanding.
Co-operation among the Spe¬
cialized Agencies of the United
Nations system is obviously diffe- .
rent in nature from that which r

information if it is systematically

may develop between the other
organizations I have mentioned,
since it is not only a welcome
source of enrichment of interna¬
tional thought and action, but is
indispensable for the satisfactory
operation of the whole U.N. sys¬
tem, indeed for its very existence...
The United Nations General
Assembly is to examine in 1975
the problem of the overall co-ordi¬
nation of the institutions of the
United Nations system and their
respective roles, with a view to
improving the system's ability to
satisfy the needs of the interna¬
tional community as effectively as
possible.
Having for many years carried
out major programmes in close
collaboration with other U.N. Spe¬
cialized Agencies and organiz¬
ations (1), Unesco will collaborate
fully in all efforts aimed at better
co-ordination between the parallel
activities of these organizations.
I shall do my utmost to increase
Unesco's co-operation with its
sister agencies in every way.
The problems of aid to devel¬
opment, so often associated with
Unesco's operational activities,
are also now taking on new
dimensions. The debate on a new
international economic order, be¬
gun at the sixth special session
of the United Nations General
Assembly, has already led to
extremely interesting discussions
in the Economic and Social
Council, and will be the subject
of the special session of the
United Nations General Assembly
in September 1975, thus gaining
fresh scope and a new quality.
Here we are no longer con¬
cerned with operational action or
aid to development, in the tradi¬
tional meaning of these terms, but
with problems affecting all man¬
kind. It is for this reason that
we should speak of co-operation
for development rather than aid
to development. Indeed, the inter¬
national crisis in energy sources
has demonstrated the vulnerability
of the developed countries and the
interdependence of all countries,
whether regarded as developed
or developing.
Unesco must be able not only
to participate in this .debate,
within the United Nations or
elsewhere, but also to contribute
to it the wealth of experience it
has accumulated over the three
decades of its existence.
Co-operation for development
is a daily fact of the Organiz¬
ation's life and there can be no
question of halting current op¬
erations on the grounds that there
is need for reflection with the
idea of reorganizing the pro¬
gramme. Two parallel and si-
(1) In particular the United Nations
Children's Fund, the Food and Agri¬
culture Organization, the International
Labour Organization, the World Health
Organization, the United Nations Dev-
., elopment Programme and the World
¿0 Food Programme.
multaneous activities are called
for: we must do all we can to
formulate new objectives and new
means of co-operation for devel¬
opment and we must carry out
current projects and programmes
as efficiently as possible...
It is commonly said that devel¬
opment is an integrated process,
a many-faceted enterprise in which
efforts must be brought to bear
on several fronts simultaneously.
But in the past, we have been
unable or unwilling to draw the
logical operational conclusions
from this self-evident fact, namely
that if development is an inte¬
grated process, the financing and
fields of action of programmes of
co-operation for development
should also be integrated.
Among the many fields of action
in development, probably the best
example is that of rural devel¬
opment programmes. For rural
development means the devel¬
opment of education, agriculture,
roads, cottage industries, distri¬
bution networks, water supply
systems, a system of credit, a
health service, etc. Are there in
fact any areas of human activity
that are not part of rural devel¬
opment?
The same is true of financing.
During recent decades, each of
the international or bilateral
financing bodies has painstakingly
established its criteria for
financing and has selected the
types of activities for which it
provides support. This special¬
ization, the at times unduly rigid
choice of criteria and the over-
compartmentalization of different
activities may curb the introduc¬
tion of new approaches and new
procedures for co-operation for
development.
So we should carefully examine
the real content of development
and study the areas in which
co-operation for development is
possible and desirable, dis¬
tinguishing them from those which
should be the responsibility and
the result of national efforts. The
aim is certainly not to establish
new restrictive criteria in addition
to those I have just mentioned;
on the contrary, it is to identify
openings which will yield maximum
results with modest resources.
And here I wish to emphasize
two things: Unesco is not founded
on a theoretical universality; it
also exists to serve its Member
States, each of its Member States.
It is essential that each Member
State rich or poor, industrialized
or aspiring to be so, in northern
or southern hemisphere, in east
or west should be able to find
a place in the Organization and to
receive from it all the services
which it is entitled to expect.
Aid to development, then, in
spite of its importance, is only
one aspect of Unesco's action.
As Assistant Director-General for
Education, it became clear to me
that we could also render useful
services to the industrialized
countries by offering them our
vast experience of the problems
in our fields of competence with
which they are confronted daily.
Moreover as I shall always
emphasize development poses
problems, however different they
may be, to all countries. It is time
that we geared our action ac¬
cordingly and it is also desirable
that the industrialized countries
bring more of their problems to
us so that together we may work
out new forms of co-operation.

MANKIND will need more
mineral resources in the next
half-century than In the whole of its
previous history. This applies to all
types of minerals but particularly to
fuels and to rare metals and elements.
In many of the modern alloys and
materials used in industry and science,
many different constituents are added
to the basic metals, including large
quantities of rare elements.
Many kinds of minerals, occurring
in large deposits, are being rapidly
exhausted or In some cases have
already been exhausted. This is
especially true of iron ores, manganese,
chromium, nickel, copper, lead, zinc,
gold, silver and platinum.
Fewer deposits of metallic and non-
metallic minerals are being discovered
near the surface and at depths of two
or three kilometres. Prospectors are
concentrating more and more onv
deeper levels of the earth's crust. r

. In theory, contemporary science and
technology could make it possible fully
to satisfy the world's material needs.
In practice many social, geographical,
technical and other difficulties will
have to be overcome before these
needs are filled.
Information on world mineral stocks
Is not complete even for the major
metals and minerals used in industry.
Many developing countries recently
freed from colonial rule are only
beginning to prospect and assess
their own mineral wealth while Infor¬
mation on deposits and reserves of
ores, petroleum and gas at depths of
more than three kilometres is also
very inadequate.
According to rough calculations, the
bulk (65 per cent) of known deposits
of various kinds of minerals consists
of low-grade ores, with only a very
small proportion (5 per cent) of high-
grade ores.
The resources of the United States,
Japan, the Federal Republic of Ger¬
many, the United Kingdom, France and
other Western European countries are
not sufficient to meet their require¬
ments.
The United States of America, for
example, has adequate supplies of
coal, gas, phosphates and molybdenum
but is dependent on imports for the
bulk of Its supplies of manganese,
chromium, nickel, mercury, tin, cobalt
and other metals and minerals. Japan
is completely dependent on imports
for Its oil, iron ore, chromites, nickel,
cobalt, molybdenum, bauxite, tin,
potassium salts and phosphates.
The Federal Republic of Germany
Imports 55-85 per cent of Its supplies
of copper, manganese, mercury, lead,
tungsten and zinc, the only minerals
which it is not obliged to import being
coal and potassium salts. The United
Kingdom is able to supply its entire
natural gas needs from domestic
sources and has been supplying 90 per
cent of its own coal requirements.
While France is rich In iron ore,
potassium salts, bauxite and some
other useful minerals, it is obliged to
import many others.
The Soviet Union is better provided
than other countries with mineral
resources, having large deposits of
coal, oil, gas, iron ore and non-ferrous
metals.
Energy Resources. Of all the
possible sources of energy fossil
fuels, atomic power, . solar energy,
hydraulic and wind power, and geo-
thermal energy the most widely used
have hitherto been coal, oil and gas.
What energy resources will mankind
have at its disposal at the beginning
of the twenty-first century and what
TAPPING UNDERSEA OIL
To meet the world's rising demand for oil, man is now prospecting and exploiting
new sources under the sea. Huge concrete structure, below, under.construction
in Stavanger Fjord, Norway, is protective casing of a 160,000 m* deepsea tank
for storing output of a North Sea oil-field. The 100-metre-high structure has
since been towed about 300 kms out to sea close to the drilling site, where
it is now grounded on the sea bed with about 30 metres protruding above
the water, ready to provision tankers anchored nearby. Perforated casing will
blunt the force of heavy seas. Study of fossil microscopic marine organisms
like the one shown above, 0.8 mm in diameter, helps scientists to date
geological layers during oil prospection. Right, three aqualung divers are
lowered from a drilling rig in the Gulf of Gascony, off the French coast, for

scientific and technological progress
Is to be foreseen in the utilization of
these different resources?
World supplies of coal, which is a
very important raw material in the
manufacture of synthetic products, are
assured for the next 150-200 years.
For world reserves of bituminous coal
and brown coal at economically
workable depths (up to 1,800 metres
for coal and 600 metres for brown coal)
the most often quoted estimate is
16 trillion tons (1 trillion = 1012).
Towards the end of this century,
prospecting for further deposits at
great depths, particularly In developing

countries, may well raise this estimate
to one of 30 or 40 trillion tons.
Known world supplies of oil amount
to 85.5 billion tons, including 14.8 billion
tons in sea bed deposits. These
figures could be multiplied by three or
five to allow for deposits which may
be discovered before the turn of the
century.
Known world reserves of natural
gas, according to the same calculations,
amount to over 50 trillion cubic metres,
including almost 7 trillion cubic metres
in sea-bed deposits.
Coal, oil and gas will probably be
the main sources of energy until the
end of this century. But extraction
of oil and gas is increasing very
rapidly and, if present trends continue,
supplies of these extremely important
fuels will be exhausted in a matter of
decades even allowing for the dis¬
covery of new deposits and improved
extraction coefficients. We might
recall that Mendeleev, the formulator
of the periodic table of elements, once
observed that burning oil was like
stoking a furnace with banknotes.
This applies equally to natural gas.
Other Mineral Resources. One of
the most important tasks facing
science and technology In the Im¬
mediate future, therefore, is to discover
ways of using other natural sources
of energy. Nuclear energy, solar
energy, geothermal energy and energy
derived from the wind and water are
bound to become Increasingly import¬
ant In the near future.
It is possible that towards the end
of the century progress will have been
made in harnessing thermonuclear
energy, which will mark an extremely
Important step by science and tech¬
nology towards solving the world's
energy problems. Mankind will then
have millions of years of supplies of
thermonuclear energy based on
hydrogen Isotopes obtained from sea
water.
If world population estimates for the
end of the century (at least 6,000 to
7,000 million) are taken as a basis of
needs, production and consumption of
metals will have to double. With the
development of ferrous and non-
ferrous metallurgy in the developing
countries, the total world production
and consumption of metal may well
Increase more than twofold but prob¬
ably not more than threefold. Rough
calculations indicate that the world's
extraction of Iron could rise to a total
of 1 billion tons. Extraction of other
ferrous and of non-ferrous metals
could increase up to tenfold. "
The Importance of the rare elements
is certain to increase steadily in
consequence of technical progress.
They are essential for the development
of modern processes and industries
which require extremely strong, light-,
weight, acid-, heat- and corrosion-
resistant materials to be made into
articles of small size.
Little in the way of study and
prospection has been carried out on
ores containing rare elements. The
problem of metal ores is therefore
highly important and Indeed acute for
many countries, Its solution involving
geological, technical and sometimes
social factors.
Non-metallic raw materials are more ^
widely used in the economy than r

metals. They are Increasingly Import¬
ant to the construction industry, the
manufacture of products for use in
agriculture, mineral salts, chemical
products and so on. The building
Industry obviously relies on stone and
the ingredients for cement, bricks, tiles
and Insulating materials, while rock
salts, potassium salts, sulphur and
phosphates are basic raw materials
for the chemical industry, and clay,
feldspar, talc and other minerals are
the basic materials for the ceramics
industry. Many minerals and rocks
are used in metallurgy and In the
manufacture of abrasives, insulators
and lubricants.
More than forty kinds of minerals
are used by industry. Among the
most important are diamonds, asbestos,
gypsum, clay, granite, graphite, lime¬
stone, minerals containing potassium,
sodium and lithium, sand, sandstone,
sulphur, mica and phosphates.
It is a curious fact that the world's
annual per capita consumption of
sulphuric acid exceeds that of sugar
and that the' petroleum and petro¬
chemical industries are to a large
extent dependent on barite and
bentom'te clays for use during drilling
and on fluorite, salt, sulphur and
various clays for the refining process.
Future Sources of Mineral Wealth.
There Is a preponderance of low-
grade ores in the earth's crust. The
exploitation of these ores Is likely to
become more important as further
technological advances are made. In
the nineteenth century only copper
ores containing 4 to 6 per cent or more
of copper were regarded as paying
ores. Now ores with a copper content
of as little as 0.4 per cent are con
sidered worth working. Modern
methods make it possible to extract
zinc, lead, silver, copper, nickel,
cobalt, and many other metals from
low-grade ores.
The possibility of using low-grade
ores will greatly increase our mineral
stocks and remove the threat of total
depletion of the world's mineral
resources for decades.
A substantial proportion of the
world's resources of coal, oil, gas,
bauxite, rock salts and potassium
salts, sulphur and phosphorites occurs
in sedimentary deposits. There are
good prospects for extracting these
minerals from depths of 5-7 kilometres
and more.
It has recently been established that
vast reserves of mineral wealth lie
beneath the seas and oceans of our

A SPARKLE
OF DIAMONDS,
A WHORL
OF COPPER
To produce a handful of diamonds
(left) thousands of tons of rocks'
must be processed. Even in rich
deposits, each stone, whether for
industrial use or jewellery, may have
to be extracted from 14 million times
its own weight in rock. Many large
deposits of far less rare minerals,
such as copper, are today being
rapidly exhausted. Right, the whorl-
shaped outline of the largest open-
cut copper mine in North America,
at Bingham Canyon, Utah. From
these workings, two miles across
from rim to rim, which snake down
over 1,000 metres into the earth,
more than 180,000 tons of barren
rock and 90,000 tons of ore are
excavated daily. Some idea of its
size is given by lines of trucks and
excavating machines seen as tiny
dots on different levels.
planet. Surveys carried out by
scientists in recent years indicate that
thousands of millions of tons of
manganese, nickel, cobalt, and copper
are contained ¡n the iron-manganese
nodules which lie on the sea-bed.
The Soviet exploration vessel V/'tyaz,
for example, has discovered large
accumulations of these nodules at
depths of 4-5 kilometres in the central
Indian Ocean, covering whole areas
of the ocean bed in continuous layers.
Reserves of these minerals on the
floor of the Pacific Ocean are esti¬
mated at 1,656 billion tons, including
358 billion tons of manganese, 207
billion tons of iron, 43 billion tons of
aluminium, 25 billion tons of mag¬
nesium, 14.7 billion tons of nickel,
9.9 billion tons of tin, and 7.9 billion
tons of copper.
Furthermore, it has been calculated
that the seas and oceans of our planet
contain more than 20 million cubic
kilometres of salts, a truly colossal
figure. Sea water also contains
varying quantities of iron, gold, copper,
nickel, cobalt, manganese and other
elements.
If all the gold contained in sea
water could be extracted and divided
equally between all the earth's in¬
habitants, there would be more than
a ton for each of usl And there is
twenty times more silver, thirty times
more thorium and molybdenum and a
thousand times more iodine in sea
water than there is gold. The oceans
are Indeed a veritable Eldorado. But
a satisfactory way has yet to be found
of extracting rare elements from sea
water.
In the long run, technical progress
may make it possible to extract the
essential minerals from any kind of
rock. Every 100 tons of ordinary
magmatic rock (granite, for example)
contains on average 8 tons of alumi¬
nium, 5 tons of Iron, 540 kilogrammes
of titanium, 80 kilos of manganese,
80 kilos of chromium, 18 kilos of
nickel, 14 kilos of vanadium, 4,5 kilos
of tungsten, 9 kilos of copper, 1.8 kilos
of lead and a quantity of uranium and
thorium capable of producing as much
energy as 50 tons of coal.
If man could devise a method of
extracting chemical elements from all
the different kinds of rocks, he need
never lack mineral resources. It Is
my belief that in time mankind will
solve this problem and will look on
all rocks as ores.

Niger (1,200,000 km' in area) in all its
aspects: ethnic, cultural, artistic, zoolo¬

museum, held up as a model for other
newly independent countries, enables over
200,000 visitors each year to discover
Niger's national roots and to learn about
the country's diversity through contact
with its rich cultural heritage and facets
of contemporary life. Below left, a

THE young African nations,
whose historical, ethnic and
geographical "fabric" is sometimes far
from homogeneous, for reasons with
which everyone is familiar, feel a
need a strong need to express their
personality and affirm their unity.
Firstly because it is only In the last
few decades that these nations have
emerged on to the international stage.
Secondly because their governments
are well aware that the long and
arduous task which faces them, and to
which they must give the highest
priority, is to melt and unite in the
crucible of a collective consciousness
the ethnic and historic mosaic formed
by their different peoples.
In laying the foundations on which
the new state of Niger has been built,
the government has been employing
every means it could devise, including,
surprisingly enough, the creation of a
national museum.
Four separate yet closely connected
operations are simultaneously being
carried on by the National Museum of
Niger: an ethnological museum; a zoo
and public pleasure gardens; a centre
for the development of traditional
craftsmanship; and an educational and
social work, project.
PABLO TOUCET, Spanish archaeologist and
museologist, was responsible for planning and
building the National Museum of Niger, Niamey,
of which he has been curator since 1958.
He was previously in charge of Punico-Roman
excavations at Uvea, Tunisia. Using a new
method he had developed for handling ancient
mosaics, he succeeded in removing and recons¬
tructing the famous baptistry of Kelibia, a
masterwork now in the Bardo Museum in Tunis.
These four operations, . carefully
planned to interlink, have given the
Museum an original appearance and
made it a dynamic ensemble of
activities.
The buildings of the National Mu¬
seum stand in the very heart of
Niamey, capital of the Republic of the
Niger, on a beautiful site whose
southern section overlooks the broad
and peaceful waters of the river Niger.
The great park had been badly
neglected and eventually became the
city refuse dump because of Its
proximity to what was then Niamey's
only market. Since June 1958 it has
been gradually transformed into a
series of delightful gardens where
today the people of Niamey and
tourists stroll In ever Increasing num¬
bers. In these surroundings stand the
various Museum buildings, whose
diversity is one of their chief attrac¬
tions.
A museum is a means of extending
and completing the basic teaching
given in schools. However, In our
case we were aiming to attract the
interest of both educated people and
those who are illiterate. Thus we
were constantly searching for a highly
elusive compromise: a museum that
would appeal to the first of these
groups without boring the second.
A visit to the ethnological museum
is an opportunity for people to return
to their past, creating in many cases
a new self-awareness.
In Niamey there are many adults
with time on their hands and children
with no opportunity to attend school.
By attracting their interest, the Mu¬
seum is making a real and practical
contribution to the education of
children and adults.
Since its foundation, the National
Museum of Niger has carefully
arranged, a collection of many every¬
day objects used by the people of Y

W Niger. These objects are an ethnolo¬
gical treasure trove, not because of
their Intrinsic value but on account of
their authenticity.
Within the Museum grounds are
modern buildings whose architecture
is inspired by the traditional construc¬
tions of banco (dried mud), buildings
which show that Niger possesses the
essential features of an architectural
style suited to the country and which
can easily be developed and adapted
to meet the needs of modern life (see
also article page 4).
Different types of dwellings from all
over Niger have also been accurately
reconstructed In the Museum grounds,
so that people can see them without
having to travel great distances.
There is a Sorkawa fishermen's
encampment, just like those found on
the banks of the river Niger during
the fishing season. Huts, ovens for
smoking fish, nets, fish-traps, har¬
poons and a canoe give the im¬
pression that the camp is actually
being used.
Not far away tents with lavish
34
furnishings used by Niger's nomadic
tribes have been pitched. There are
tents of Toubbou tribesmen from the
oasis of Bilma, of Tuaregs from the
Air region and from Azaouack in
northwest Niger, as well as those of
Wogos, Kourteys and Fulanl.
The rural homes of the major Hausa,
Songhai and Djerma tribal groups have
been recreated down to the last detail,
comprising buildings, furnishings and
the utensils used by families in daily
life. These recreations of rural Niger
are of great educational value, offering
foreign visitors a broad panorama of
the country's traditional life and at the
same time giving the people of
western Niger an opportunity to get
to know about the way of life of their
fellow-citizens In the distant eastern
countryside.
Elsewhere masons have built a
house with the famous "Hausa" arches
used in a typical type of dwelling of the
Hausa people. This style of building
is urban rather than rural.
There is also a pavilion of Niger
traditional dress, which considerably
enriches the Museum's ethnological
collection. But the Museum has gone
still further by bringing together
craftsmen from all parts of the
country blacksmiths, weavers, cob¬
blers, carvers, leatherworkers and
potters. This has been done partly to
prevent traditional techniques from
dying out, but above all so that
craftsmen from different tribes, the
Djerma and the Tuareg, the Songhai
and the Hausa, the Beriberi and the
Fulanl, can work together, mingling
their laughter and their songs.
When the Visitor has seen the
different traditional costumes and
homes, he can watch the craftsmen
at work and, If he wishes, take away
one of the objects he has seen being
made. We do not think that any
ethnological museum can do more than
this. '
' In another part of the park visitors
listen to traditional songs, legends
and historic tales from Niger's distant
past, all rendered in the native lan¬
guages. We believe that there is no
better way of preserving a song or
story than teaching it to children,

The regional diversity of the Republic
of the Niger is outstandingly displayed
and explained at the country's national
museum in Niamey. All the different
types of traditional dwellings have
been scrupulously reconstructed in the
open air: nomads' tents, fishermen's
huts, and town and village homes from
the mosaic of regions that form Niger.
Left, a "boua", a millet granary of a
kind found in Songhai villages in
western Niger. This highly functional
construction of "banco" (worked clay
and straw) has an opening a metre
above ground level. The grain is poured
through a vent in the dome, which is
covered with an enormous straw hat
known as a "boua bata", affording
protection against sun or rain. Below,
in the museum's zoo, where virtually
all Niger's animal life is represented, a
hippopotamus accepts a little snack
from admiring visitors.
without any kind of compulsion. These
songs, in which the Niger visitors
sometimes join in, are thus being
saved from the oblivion which threat¬
ened them.
In a report written after a tour of
Africa, South America and Asia, M. de
Varine-Bohan, Director of the Interna¬
tional Council of Museums, described
the Niger as the first country to have
made maximum use of a museum to
further government efforts to promote
national unity.
About 300 boys and girls regularly
attend courses given in the Museum's
education centre. These boys and girls
have been pupils in state primary
schools, but at the end of their
schooling some have not yet found an
opening in the country's economy.
And so they have time on their hands,
they forget what they have been
taught, and become a serious social
problem. The school at the Museum
is not modelled on the state schools.
The primary aim Is to encourage the
children to retain what they have
learned, and so they attend revision
classes in languages and mathematics.
At the same time they are given a
broad training in manual skills which
find a ready use in everyday life.
They learn how to build a complete
house in banco: how to prepare the
foundations, make bricks and build
walls and roofs, and also how to paint
It and Install electric wiring, etc.
Among other things they also learn
market gardening, how to rear chick¬
ens and rabbits, basic mechanics (how
to repair light motor-cycles and bicy¬
cles), and traditional pottery.
The girls also attend revision classes
and learn sewing and cooking. The
cookery taught is based on foods
produced locally,' the aim being to
work out nutritionally well-balanced
menus. They also learn hygiene and
child care.
By the end of their time at the
Centre these boys and girls have
learned many useful skills. They also
come to realize the importance of
manual work, unlike some young
people In cities who tend to despise it.
In October 1971, the National Mu¬
seum, using its own resources, began
to work on behalf of the blind and
physically handicapped. Initially these
persons were housed in a straw hut.
Most of the handicapped were
beggars, and the aim was to make
them capable of earning a living.
This meant providing for all their needs,
including food, clothing, transport, and
training, including special exercises in
order for them to acquire manual skills.
Today over a score of blind and
handicapped persons are housed in a
specially constructed building and are
taught by two young instructors who
have graduated from the craft training
school. Each blind person works with
a spastic person, and this teamwork is
producing good results.
We have made no attempt "to Imitate
the fine museums of Europe and else¬
where. Instead, we have planned and
created a museum in keeping with our
resources. It was originally conceived
for the people of Niger, but we have
since found that Europeans enjoy
visiting it as much as Africans.
Several other African states have
expressed their intention of setting up
similar museums. By launching this
pioneering cultural enterprise, we have
shown our fellow African countries
that it Is possible to create a museum
without spending vast sums on
buildings and running costs.

OCTAVIO PAZ, Mexican poet, essayist and
translator, is one of the outstanding writers in
the Spanish language. He has been Mexico's
ambassador to India, and has taught in several
universities, including Cambridge (U.K.) where
he was Simon Bolivar Professor of Latin-Am¬
erican Studies. He has published several volumes
of poetry, including 'Libertad bajo palabra'
(Liberty on parole). English translations of his
essays include 'Labyrinth of Solitude ' (1961),
'Claude Lévi-Strauss: An Introduction' (1972)
and "Alternating Current' (1973). An antho¬
logy of his translations of poetry into Spanish
( Versiones y Diversiones ") was published
in 1973.
LEARNING to speak Implies
learning to translate. When a
child asks his mother what this or that
word means, what he is really asking
her to do is to translate the unknown
term into language that he can under¬
stand. In this sense, translation
within a language does not differ
basically from translation into another
language. The history of every people
re-enacts this childhood experience.
Even the most isolated tribes at one
time or another come up against the
language barrier of some alien group.
The sounds of a foreign language
may cause us wonder, anger, loathing
or amused perplexity, but soon make
us think about our own form of speech.
Language then loses Its universal
character and we become aware of the
existence of other tongues, each of
them strange and unintelligible to the
others.
In the past, translation dispelled any
doubts we might have entertained.
Even if there was no single uni¬
versal language, languages never¬
theless formed a universal society in
which everyone could understand one
another and communicate, once certain
difficulties had been overcome. Com¬
munication was possible because

whatever the language, people every¬
where spoke about the same things.
This universality of the mind was
the answer to the confusion of Babel.
There may be many languages but they
have meaning in common. For Pascal
the very multiplicity of religions
constituted a proof of the truth of
Christianity. Translation offered the
Ideal of universal intelligibility to
counterbalance the diversity of
languages. Thus translation was not
only an additional proof of the unity of
mind but also a guarantee of that unity.
The modern age has destroyed that
security. When man rediscovered the
infinite variety of temperaments and
emotions that existed, and became
conscious of the multiplicity of customs
and institutions in the world, he
stopped seeing himself In other men.
Until that time the savage had been
an exception that had to be eliminated
through conversion or extermination,
by baptism or by the sword. The
savage who made his appearance In
the eighteenth-century salons was a
new type of creature. Even when he
spoke the language of his hosts to
perfection, there was a residual
strangeness about him. He was not
a candidate for conversion but a sub-

kject for dispute and criticism. The
'originality of his judgements, the
simplicity of his customs and the very
violence of his emotions were proof of
the folly and vanity, if not the infamy,
of baptism and conversion.
Then things were reversed. The
religious search for a universal identity
gave way to an intellectual curiosity
anxious to discover differences that
were no less universal. Strangeness
ceased to be a deviation and became
exemplary In a paradoxical and
revealing way: the savage now rep¬
resented civilized man's yearning for
the past, his alter ego, his lost half.
Translation reflects these changes.
It is no longer an operation that tends
to prove the ultimate similarity of men
everywhere, but has become the
vehicle of their individualities. For¬
merly its purpose was to reveal the
likenesses that transcended their
disparities; henceforth it shows that
these disparities are absolute, whether
they reflect the strangeness of the
savage or that of our neighbours.
A remark made by Dr. Samuel John¬
son while on a journey expresses this
new outlook quite cogently. "A blade
of grass is always a blade of grass,
whether in one country or another,"
he said. "Men and women are my
subjects of inquiry; let us see how
these differ from those we have left
behind."
Two meanings are implicit in
Dr. Johnson's observation and they
both foreshadow the twofold path that
the modern age was to take. The first
concerns the separation between man
and Nature, a separation that would
later turn into an antagonistic relation¬
ship and a struggle between them,
with man considering that his mission
was no longer to save himself but to
dominate Nature. The second im¬
plication has to do with the separation
between man and man. The world
ceases to be one world, an indivisible
totality. It Is split into Nature and
Culture, and Culture Is broken up Into
cultures.
So we have a multiplicity of
languages and a multiplicity of
societies. Each language constitutes
a way of looking at the world, and
each civilization is a world in itself.
The sun that the Aztec poem glorifies
Is different from the. sun the Egyptians
worshipped, even though the astro¬
nomical body is the same.
For over two centuries philosophers
and historians, and now anthropol¬
ogists and ' linguists, have been
accumulating proof that the differences
between individuals, societies and
periods are irreducible. The major
division, scarcely less fundamental
than the one established between
Nature and Culture, is that which
separates primitive from civilized
peoples. Then come the variety and
heterogeneity of cultures.
Differences spring up within each
culture. The very languages that
enable us to communicate - between
ourselves also confine us In an in¬
visible network of sounds and mean¬
ings, with the result that nations
become prisoners of the languages
they speak. Each language spawns
Its own divisions in the form of
historical epochs, social classes and
successive generations. Individuals
may belong to the same community,
but each one is isolated, walled up
alive in his own skin.
All this ought to have discouraged
translators, but it has. not done so.
On the contrary, there is a contra¬
dictory and complementary tendency
to translate more and more. The
reason for this paradox is that, on the
one hand, translation does away with
the differences between one language
and another; and, on the other hand,
it brings them into greater prominence,
because through translation we become
more fully aware of the fact that other
people speak and think in ways that
differ from ours.
In one sense the world seems to us
like a collection of differences, and in
another like a pile of texts, each one
slightly different from the one before
it, resembling translations of trans¬
lations of translations.
Each text is unique,, yet at the same
time it is the translation of another
text. No text is entirely original,
because language itself is essentially
a translation. In the first place, it
translates from the non-verbal world.
Then, too, each sign, each sentence,
is the translation of another sign,
another sentence. This reasoning may
even be reversed without losing any
of Its force and we may assert that
all texts are original because every
translation Is different. To a certain
extent every translation Is an original
invention and thus constitutes a
unique text.

Translation and creation,
twin operations in art and literature
Painting as well as literature offers
notable examples of the art of translation.
The famous work by Velazquez, Las Meninas
(Ladies-in-Waiting) painted in 1656 and now
in the Prado Museum, in Madrid (far left)
was used as an original for works by two
equally celebrated artists: Goya and
Picasso. About 1780, Goya "translated " Las
Meninas by transposing it from painting to
engraving. His version (centre) is now in the
Petit Palais Museum, in Paris. Picasso's
"translation" of Velazquez' masterpiece
is a bold departure from the original and
bears the imprint of his own genius.
Left, the first of 45 variations of
aspects of Las Meninas painted by Picasso
in four months during 1957.
Picasso
What the discoveries of anthro¬
pology and linguistics condemn is not
translation itself but a naïve view of
translation, or in other words literal
translation which is significantly re¬
ferred to in English as slavish. It is,
of course, possible to translate literally,
but this is not translation. It is
generally no more than a string of
words intended to help us read a text
in Its original language. As such, it is
more like lexicography than translation.
In any event, even in cases where
it is only necessary to convey the
meaning, as in scientific works, trans¬
lation always implies a transformation
of the original. Such transformation
is necessarily literary because trans¬
lation is an operation that makes use
of the two modes of expression to
which, according to Roman Jakobson,
all literary processes can be reduced,
namely metonymy and metaphor.
The original text never reappears in
the other language: this would be
impossible. Nevertheless, it is always
present because, although the trans¬
lation' does not explicitly state as
much. It refers to the original text
constantly, or else converts It Into a
verbal object that differs from it, yet
reproduces It by metonymy or meta¬
phor. Both of these, as distinct from
explanatory or free translations, are
strict forms that are not incompatible
with exactness. Metonymy is an
indirect description; metaphor is a
verbal equation.
Poetry has always been considered
the form of writing that lends itself
least to translation. This prejudice is
surprising when we stop to think that
many of the best poems in every
Western language are translations, and
that many of these translations have
been made by outstanding poets.
Some years ago Georges Mounin,
the French critic and linguist, pointed
out that it Is usually admitted grudg¬
ingly, to be sure that the denotative
meanings of a text can be rendered
into a foreign language, whereas it Is
almost unanimously held that the
connotative meanings cannot.
Poetry contains overtones, reflec¬
tions and relationships between sound
and sense. It ¡s a tissue of con¬
notations, and these are deemed un¬
translatable. I confess that this view
goes against my grain, not only
because It conflicts with my conception
of the universality of poetry, but
because it is based on a false notion
of what translation really Is.
My ideas are not shared by
everyone, however. . Indeed, many
modern poets assert that poetry
simply cannot be translated. But they
are perhaps moved by an Infatuation
with verbal material and have been
caught In the snare of subjectivity.
Language becomes a landscape and
that landscape in turn Is an invention,
the metaphor of a nation or an
individual. It is a verbal topography
in which everything is communicated
and everything is translation. Sen¬
tences are mountain chains and the
mountains are the signs and ideo¬
grams of a culture.
But the play of resonances and
verbal interrelationships, while Intoxi
cating, conceals a certain danger.
Surrounded as we are by words on
all sides, there comes a time when
we suddenly feel dumbfounded and
alienated by the anguish of living with
names instead of things. Sometimes
it even seems strange to have a name
of one's own. Federico García Lorca
wrote:
Here amid the bulrushes in the late
[afternoon,
How odd that I should be named
[Federico I
This experience too is universal.
Garcia Lorca would have felt just as
strange had he been called Tom or
Pierre or Chuang-Tzu. Losing our
name would be like losing our shadow,
but to be only our name is to be
reduced to being a shadow. The lack
of conformity between things and their
names is doubly unbearable. Either
significance disappears, or the things
themselves seem to vanish. A world
of exclusively abstract meanings Is just
as unappealing as a world of things
devoid of meaning and nameless.
Language is what makes the world
livable. The amazement at being
named Federico or Sô Jl is Immediately
followed by the invention of another
name, a name which in a sense is a
translation of the previous one, the
metaphor or metonymy which, without
pronouncing It, implies it.
In recent years, owing perhaps to
the ascendancy of linguistics, there
has been a tendency to minimize the
eminently literary nature of trans¬
lation. Actually, there is no such .
thing as a science of translation, nor W

>can there be, though translation can
and should be studied scientifically.
Just as literature is a. specialized
function of language, so translation is
a specialized function of literature.
But what about translation machines?
If these devices one day succeed in
really translating, they will then be
performing a literary operation no
different from that which translators
now accomplish. ' They will be turning
out literature. Translation is a task
in which, apart from the requisite
knowledge of languages, what is
decisive Is the translator's initiative,
whether this be taken by a machine
that man has "programmed" or by a
human being surrounded with dic¬
tionaries.
Arthur Waley's words are convincing
here: "A French scholar wrote re¬
cently with regard to translators:
'Qu'ils s'effacent derrière les textes et
ceux-ci, s'ils ont été vraiment compris,
parleront d'eux-mêmes.' [Let them
efface' themselves. The texts, if they
have been properly understood, will
speak for themselves.] Except In the
rather rare case of plain concrete
statements such as The cat chases
the mouse", there are seldom sen¬
tences that have exact word-to-word
equivalents In another language. It
becomes a question of choosing
between various approximations ... I
have always found that it was I, not
the texts, that had to do the talking."
It would be hard to add a single word
to this statement.
Theoretically, poetry should be
translated only by poets, but in point
of fact poets are rarely good trans¬
lators because they almost Invariably
take someone else's poem as the
starting point for a poem of their own.
A good translator does just the
opposite: his aim is to produce a poem
that is similar to, though not identical
with, the original poem. He only
departs from it in order to follow it
more closely. A good translator of
poetry is a translator who Is also a
poet like Arthur Waley or a poet
who is also a good translator such as
Gérard de Nerval when he translated
the first Faust.
The reason why many poets are
unable to translate poetry Is not purely
psychological in naturethough the
cult of self does enter into it but
functional. " Poetic translation, as I
shall try to show, is an operation
similar to poetic creation, except that it
is executed in reverse.
Every word has a certain number of
possible meanings. When a word is
combined with others to form a sen¬
tence, one of its meanings is singled
out and becomes predominant. Mean¬
ing tends to be univocal in prose,
whereas one of the characteristics of
poetry, as has often been noted, and
possibly its chief quality, is that it
retains the several meanings of a word.
In reality, this is a property of
language in general. Poetry accen
tuates it, but It is also to be found In
everyday speech and even in prose.
Critics have lingered over this dis¬
turbing particularity of poetry without
noticing that the mobility and in-
definiteness of its meanings Is paral¬
leled by another equally fascinating
particularity, namely the immobility of
its signs. Poetry transforms language
radically and in a direction opposite to
that of prose. In the one case, the
mobility of signs coincides with a
tendency to establish a single mean¬
ing; in the other, the plurality of mean¬
ings coincides with the Immutability of
the signs.
Language is a- system of mobile
signs which, to some degree, may be
interchangeable. One word may be
replaced by another, and every sen¬
tence can be put In another way
(translated). We may say that the
meaning of -a word is always another
word. If we wish to prove this, we
have only to realize that each time we
ask "What does that sentence mean?"
the answer is always a different
sentence.
Once we enter into the realm of
poetry, however, words lose their
mobility and their interchangeabillty.
A poem has many shifting meanings,
but the words of a given poem are
unique and irreplaceable. To alter
them would be to destroy the poem.
Without ceasing to be a language
poetry transcends language.
The poet, caught up in the whirl of
language which is' a constant verbal
coming and going selects a few
words, or is selected by them. He
fashions his poem by combining them
and It then becomes a verbal object
made up of irreplaceable and irre¬
movable signs.
THE translator's starting point is
not language in motion, which
is the poet's raw material, but the fixed
language of the poem. It is a frozen
language, and yet it is quite alive. His
operation is the opposite of the poet's.
He is not called upon to forge an un¬
changeable text with changing signs,
but to take that text apart, set the
signs in motion again and return them
to the language. Up to this point the
translator's work is similar to that of
a reader or critic, since every reading
is a translation,, and every criticism Is,
or begins by, being, an interpretation.
Reading, however, is a translation
within the same language and criticism
is a free version, or more exactly a
transposition, of the poem. For the
critic a poem Is the jumping-off place
towards another text, his own, whereas
the translator, using another language
and different signs, must compose, a
poem similar to the original.
Thus at the second stage the trans¬
lator's activity Is comparable to that of
the poet, but with this important differ¬
ence: when the poet writes, he does
not know what his poem is going to
be like; when the translator translates,
he knows that his poem must re¬
produce the poem he has before him.
Translation and creation are twin
operations. As the cases of Baude¬
laire and Ezra Pound show, it is often
impossible to distinguish translation
from creation. Moreover, there is a
constant give and take between them,
a continual and mutual creative
influence. The great ages of poetry
In the West, from the time of its origin
with the Provençal troubadours down
to our own day, have been preceded
or accompanied by the interweaving
of various poetic traditions. These
cross-currents have sometimes taken
the form of Imitation and at other times
that of translation.
From this point of view the history
of European poetry may be looked
upon as the history of the mingling
of the many traditions that go to make
up what is known as Western litera¬
ture, not to mention Arabic presence
In Provençal lyricism or that of haiku
and Chinese poetry ¡n modern poetry.
Critics study "influences", but this
term is equivocal. It would be better
to consider Western literature as a
single whole In which the central
figures are not national traditions-
English, French, Portuguese or German
poetrybut styles and trends.
No trend or style has ever been
national, not even the so-called
"artistic nationalism". All styles have
been transllnguistic. John Donne is
closer to the Spanish poet Quevedo
than he is to Wordsworth; there is an
evident affinity between Góngora and
Marino, but there is nothing except
the Spanish language to connect
Góngora with the Archpriest of Hita,
who in turn is sometimes reminiscent
of Chaucer.
Styles are collective and pass from
one language to another; written
works, rooted in their verbal soil, are
unique. They are unique but not
Isolated, for each of them is born and
lives in relation to other works in
different languages.
In every period European poets and
now those of the two Americas as
wellwrite the same poem in their
several languages, and each of these
versions is likewise an original and
different poem.
The synchronization may not be
perfect, but if we withdraw a" bit, we
find that we are listening to a concert
In which the musicians, playing differ¬
ent instruments and without following
any orchestra leader or score, are
composing a collective work in which
improvisation is inseparable from
translation, and Invention is closely
bound up with imitation. Occasionally
one of the musicians launches into an
inspired solo. The others soon take
their cue from him and then go on to
introduce variations, while the original
motif becomes lost in the .new
creation.

Global pattern
of TV traffic
The American share of the world market
for TV programmes is declining while
British, French and German exports are
increasing, according to a recent Unesco
report. "Television traffic a one-way
street?" by two Finnish researchers,
Kaarle Nordenstreng and Tapio Varis,
reveals that American programmes still
take the lion's share with estimated sales
abroad of between 100,00 and 200,000 pro¬
gramme hours per year. However, Amer¬
ican programme exports declined from $100
million in 1970 to $85 million in 1971. The
British are the second largest exporter of
TV programmes.
Folk Tales from Asia
Folk Tales from Asia (Books I and II),
recently published, mark the start of a
co-publishing venture to provide Asian chil¬
dren with reasonably priced illustrated
books. This co-publishing programme is
carried out in co-operation with Unesco by
the Asian Cultural Centre for Unesco-Tokyo
Book Development Centre. Book I of Folk
Tales from Asia presents stories from Ban¬
gladesh, India, Korea, Iran, Laos, Singapore,
Thailand and Viet-Nam. In book II are sto¬
ries from Indonesia, Japan, Khmer Republic,
Malaysia, Pakistan, Sri Lanka, the Philip¬
pines and Nepal. The 18 countries partici¬

character of ancient towns and cities and
for the adaptation of old buildings to
modern uses.
International book award
for Japanese publisher
The first International book award honour¬
ing outstanding services to the cause of
books has been awarded to a leading
Japanese publisher, Shoichi Noma, for his
leadership in the movement to develop
Asian book publishing. The award has
been made by the International Book Com¬
mittee, which groups the principal profes¬
sional organizations concerned with books.
Mr. Noma is the founder of the Toi<yo
Book Development Centre for Asia, set up
following a Unesco conference on book
development in Asia, held in 1966.
The world's
water problems
Man today depletes or pollutes his fresh
water reserves at the rate of 300 cubic
kilometres a year. Ways of easing the
present water shortage were examined
recently by an international hydrological
conference at Unesco's H.Q. in Paris.
The conference, organized jointly by
Unesco and the World Meteorological Or¬
ganization, reviewed the achievements of the
International Hydrological Decade launched
by Unesco In 1965. It adopted an ambitious
international hydrological programme for the
five years ahead, stressing scientific
research into the problems of drought and
the effects of pollution on water resources.
Protecting the monuments

Letters to the Editor
AFRICA'S RAIL PROBLEMS
Sir,
Maaza Bekele suggested worthwhile
ideas for improving living conditions in
Africa (your July-August 1974 issue on
population). Nations on other conti¬
nents probably could benefit by using
some of her thoughts.
Specifically, she suggests, ".. .a move
towards economic co-operation between
and among African nations, which
together can provide a market large
enough to admit of viable trade."
A study of the map of Africa reveals
problems. The typical rail line runs
from the seacoast to the interior and
has few, if any branches. So trade is
favoured with overseas nations as
connexions to adjoining nations are rare.
Even building important connecting
links will not be enough because the
existing lines are built to five or
six different gauges. Remember that
England built the first commercial steam
railroad in 1825, but it wasn't until 1892
that the last wide-gauge line was
converted to the -national standard.
Experience has been the same in
other major industrial nations: A
national uniform gauge is necessary for
speedy and efficient movement of
people and goods. Even better is
where several adjoining nations use the
same gauge.

THE FOUR BILLION
POPULATION QUESTION
Sir,
Your "World Population Year", issue
answers the question Cain asked, "Am
I my brother's keeper?" "Yesl"
That answer raises more questions.
Grant that the population prob¬
lem (current world population nearly
4 billion) in all its ramifications, with
all its implications has been made clear
to every nation, to every community
of man.
One nation forbids birth control.
That nation's population grows faster
than the nation's ability to provide
gainful work or food for its people.
Must other nations support one nation
that will not help itself?
Another nation is rich. Its people
eat more than they need. They waste
while others hunger. Because they can
pay, they use for pleasure resources
which poorer nations could employ to
produce food. Should the better
situated share with those who have not
even the basic necessities?
An underpopulated country claims
that it must have more men and women
to develop its dormant resources. Will
the benefits from the development flow
equally to all? Or is the call for un¬
hindered breeding a device for per¬
petuating present extremes of wealth
and poverty?
A nation regulates its agriculture and
its industry, and its farms and factories
do not pollute the air, the water, the
soil. Can that one nation, or a
consortium of nations take steps to stop
another nation's harmful practices?
Each nation Insists that it must decide
for itself what it can and will do for its
people without interference from others.
Your writers on the population prob¬
lem realize that a nation can hurt itself
when it disregards the welfare of others.
René Dumont says that change, con¬
tinuance of acceptable life on this earth
"will often require as an inescapable
condition the abolition of privileges,
and consequently a genuine social
revolution."
The only effective way to move
nations to act for the common good is
through education, persuasion, appeal
to immediate as well as to long term
self interest. Is there time enough for
education to become effective? What
else can we do?
While making best use of the time
he has, man should think also of the
other life with whom he shares the
world. In all his concern with survival
man acts as if he were creation's most
important product.
All that lives is brother to man.
When man controls his own numbers,
while he encourages the others to
multiply, the world will support, and will
keep man and his brother.

FRIENDS OF UNESCO
Sir,
Recently we organized a youth club
of "Friends of Unesco" whose members
are 17 to 30 years old. Our aim is to
publicize Unesco's work and to get
acquainted with the cultural heritage and
the present state of science and edu¬
cation, literature and art of other
countries. We do not know much
about how similar clubs work in other
countries, and would be glad to hear
more about the organizations that
support the United Nations and Unesco.

BOTANICAL ENIGMAS
OF THE PAMIRS
Sir,
Your article, "Enigmas of the Plant
World of Central Asia" (November
1974), on studies by Soviet scientists
of the paradoxical botanical wealth of
the Pamirs made fascinating reading.
The luxuriance of the vegetation in this
region is quite' astounding.
The author suggested several expla¬
nations: ultra-violet radiation, which in
the Pamirs is 50 per cent higher than
normal; intense solar reaction due to
the transparency and dryness of the air;
enormous fluctuations in temperature,
etc. In my opinion, however, two
fundamental causes were omitted, the
main one being the extremely high
radioactivity of the soil.
Before World War II, French scien¬
tists and researchers discovered that
application of radioactive substances in
carefully controlled doses had Important
stimulating effects, on plant growth. The
soil of the Pamirs plateaux must
contain a high percentage of silica,
and pure silica is extremely radioactive.
The second cause, linked to the first,
must lie in the very small amount of
clay in the soil, for clay and all its
derivatives are effective insulators of
certain currents and rays electrical,
magnetic, radioactive, etc.
M. Thibaudat
Epinal, France
Sir,
As an engineer and scientist, I read
with great pleasure Anatoly V. Pokrov-
sky's article on the plant world of the
Pamirs.
However, I am surprised that the
author did not mention the possible
role of cosmic rays, which may provide
an explanation of these botanical mys¬
teries. Between 2,500 metres and
3,800 metres above sea level, at the
latitude of the Pamirs, there must be
quite a heavy bombardment of protons
and muons, capable of causing other
biological effects than those which may
derive from the intensification of short¬
wave or ultra-violet rays in the solar
spectrum, or from the purity, trans¬
parency and dryness of the air, etc.
In any case, Mr. Petrovsky's absorb¬
ing article clearly demonstrates that the
work of the Pamirs Botanical Institute
is of fundamental importance to the
study of world plant biology.

LITTLE-KNOWN
OCEANIA
Sir,
The "Unesco Courier" has published
a great deal on the cultures of various
countries and peoples, and rightly so.
But what about the peoples of Oceania
and their original culture which still
holds many a mystery and riddle?
The average reader knows much less
about the history and peoples of
Oceania than he does about Africa and
South America, since both these conti¬
nents have been widely discussed in
popular science books and fiction.

CAMPAIGN
AGAINST RACISM
Sir,
I would like to call your attention to
a question of current concern which
I find deeply disturbing: racism in
France today.
Arab workers are the chief victims
of this racism. Although latent until a
few months ago, it erupted through
pressure by certain right wing groups.
The situation reached the point where
a government minister recently announc¬
ed that a public information campaign
is to be launched to highlight and
explain the problem in order to count¬
eract the action of racist groups.
By participating in this campaign and
publishing facts and figures you would
help people like myself who are in
contact with large numbers of workers.

THE TIMELESS ART OF BUILDING
Square constructions of this type, formerly found only on the small islands off the eastern coast of Tunisia,
are today being built in increasing numbers throughout the country (in foreground, wall of house; in rear,
village mosque). Traditional architecture in all parts of the world provides countless examples of buildings
in which beauty and functional qualities have been combined harmoniously for many centuries. Unesco has
launched a series of studies on these forms of architecture, many of which offer an immense untapped
source of inspiration for modern builders. See article page 4.
