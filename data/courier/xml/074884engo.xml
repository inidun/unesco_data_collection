COPERNICUS, A NEW VISION OF THE UNIVERSE
"This man has his place among the stars", it was said of Copernicus, and
here against a fitting backdrop of a chart of the heavens we show a painting
of the great astronomer by an unknown 16th century artist. Based on a
self portrait, which has disappeared, it hangs in the town hall of Torun,
Copernicus' birthplace. The stellar map in colour is novel in that it shows
the position of the stars for the year 2000. Adapted by Werner Merkli and
published by Hallwag (Bern, Switzerland) it measures 1.30 m X 1 m. Back
cover reproduces part of a map of the solar system by the same publisher.
The complete map carries reproductions of Mars, Jupiter and Saturn, and
shows the size of all the planets in comparison to the Sun. The back of
the map ha*TdaJtailed explanations of the solar system.

"History affords few examples of scientific discoveries that have had
such profound repercussions on the spiritual development of mankind
as that of the great Polish astronomer Nicholas Copernicus." It was
with these words that Unesco's Director-General, René Maheu, opened
a ceremony held in Paris on February 19th in honour of the 500th anni¬
versary of the birth of the man who set the earth a-spinning round
the sun and sparked off an unparalleled revolution in scientific method¬
ology and thought. In this issue the Unesco Courier examines Coper¬
nicus' contributions to the progress of science and, exceptionally,
publishes a 16-page supplement for children on the great astronomer.
Unesco Courier photographer Paul Almasy made a special trip to Poland
and elsewhere to follow in the footsteps of Copernicus and brought
back a pictorial record of the life and times of one of the great figures
of science whose guiding principle in life was " to seek the truth in
all things ".
IN THE FOOTSTEPS
OF COPERNICUS
by Jerzy Bukowski
NIICHOLAS COPERNICUS,
the first of the great scientific thinkers
of modern times, was born in the
northern Polish town of Torun on
February 19, 1473. His horoscope,
which still exists, even gives the exact
moment of his birth: 4.48 a.m., though
this detail could be pure imagination
on someone's part.
Copernicus, famous as the originator
of the heliocentric theory of the
universe, Is less well known for his
achievements as a humanist and
classical scholar. With his vast
erudition and profound interest in a
wide range of problems, his Insight as
an investigator and his bold creative
thinking and critical judgement, he was,
in the words of one of his first
biographers, "fired by an ardent
passion for truth". His 'extraordinary
intellect places him among the world's
greatest men of genius, but he was
also a citizen deeply concerned with
his country's problems.
JERZY BUKOWSKI, professor and former
rector of the Warsaw Polytechnical Institute,
Is president of the Nicholas Copernicus Com¬
mittee of the International Union of the
History and Philosophy of Science. A former
president of the Committee of the History
of Sciences and Technology of the Polish
Academy of Sciences, he Is currently vice-
president of the Polish Peace Committee.
No documented historical evidence
exists to tell us about the great
astronomer's childhood and early
youth. His father, also named Nicho¬
las, was a Cracow merchant belonging
to a family of Silesian origin,
whose multiple interests had built
up close links with the towns of
Pomerania.
Nicholas Copernicus the elder be¬
came a burgher of Torun in 1458, and
within a short time occupied a place
of considerable social standing. After
his death in 1483 his children, of whom
the youngest, Nicholas, was ten years
old, were placed under the guardian¬
ship of their maternal uncle, Lucas
Watzenrode, future Bishop of Warmia,
who was at the time a high-ranking
dignitary of the Church and a
distinguished statesman attached to
the Polish royal court in Cracow.
Cracow was at that period the
capital of Poland, which was then at
the height of its power, and of which
one of the great Italian humanists of
the early 16th century was to say,
"of all the lands beyond the Alps none
equals Poland in its love of learning."
Torun was a flourishing town with
prosperous trade and industries. As
an intermediate point for merchandise
routed through the ports of Gdansk
and Elblag, it held a key position in
overseas trade which assured it a
place of considerable importance in
the Polish economic system.
The two towns, which even today
retain their medieval character, are
situated upon the upper and lower
Vistula respectively. Not far from
Elblag, in the eastern part of the valley
of the Vistula, stood the town of
Frombork, where Copernicus was to
spend the latter part of his life and
where he died in 1543.
In the mid-fifteenth century, the
political situation of the towns of the
Baltic coastal province was extremely
complicated. With Gdansk, Elblag
and Torun foremost among them, they
were engaged in a stubborn struggle
to rid themselves once and for all of
the hegemony of the Teutonic Order,
which had settled in the region as far
back as the 13th century. The Treaty
of Torun, signed in 1466, restored
Polish royal sovereignty over the
Baltic coastal region, together with the-
delta of the Vistula, and including the
major towns and the episcopal duchy
of the Diocese of WarmTa.
Both Nicholas Copernicus the elder
and the Watzenrode family played an
active role in achieving this agreement.
To the end of his days, Lucas Watzen¬
rode was to exert a vital influence

IN THE FOOTSTEPS OF COPERNICUS (Continued)

upon the life of young Nicholas
Copernicus, guiding his studies and
setting the course of his future
ecclesiastical and political career.
A second date confirmed by docu¬
ments relating to Copernicus' youth
is that of his registration at Cracow's
Jagiellonian University in the autumn
of 1491.
The Jagiellonian University was then
at the height of its expansion; it was
the only university in Europe to have
two chairs of astronomy, and was
renowned for the exceptionally high
level of its teaching of the mathe¬
matical sciences. Studies there cover¬
ed not only the treatises of the ancient
Greeks, but even those of the scholars
of Islam.
It was at Cracow that the young
Nicholas Copernicus acquired his first
notions of astronomy, and tradition
has it that the famous astronomer and
mathematician Wojciecj Brudzewski
was among his teachers. During his
studies at the Jagiellonian University,
Copernicus obtained a thorough know¬
ledge of Aristotelian and Ptolemaic
astronomy and Euclidian geometry.
Judging from the books he bought at
this period, which are fortunately still
in existence, his main interest lay in
spherical geometry and trigonometry,
and in theoretical astronomy.
.LTHOUGH they differed
on points of detail, Aristotelian and
Ptolemaic theories, which had pre¬
vailed for over a thousand years, con¬
curred upon two major fundamental
postulates: firstly, the position assign¬
ed to the Earth as the immobile
centre of the universe, and secondly,
the attribution of a uniform circular
motion to all the heavenly bodies
fixed stars as well as planets, and
including the Sun and the Moon. The
latter principle, a Platonic axiom, was
to have a weighty influence upon the
form first given by Copernicus to his
heliocentric system of the universe.
Aristotle and those who professed
and perpetuated his philosophy, as
well as the astronomers and, in par¬
ticular, Claudius Ptolemy, in his treatise
known as the Almagest, give a truly
remarkable description of the move¬
ments of the heavenly bodies, based
on the two principles mentioned above,
although a number of contradictions
and anomalies were inevitably em¬
bodied in their theories.
Copernicus became aware of the
discrepancies contained in the systems
generally accepted and taught, and
through mathematical analysis and
geometrical synthesis, followed by
minutely detailed observation of the
sky, he gradually developed the
idea of a heliocentric system of the
universe.
Nicholas Copernicus probably spent
four years in Cracow, and in the
autumn of 1495 he was once again at
the court of his uncle Lucas Watzen¬
rode, who made unfruitful efforts to
have his nephew appointed canon of
the Chapter of Warmia in Frombork.
His failure to do so may have been
the decisive factor in the destiny of
young Nicholas. His uncle sent him
to continue his studies at the Uni¬
versity of Bologna, where he himself
had studied as a youth, strongly
recommending him to obtain the
degree of doctor of canon law, with
a view to pursuing an ecclesiastical
career.
Copernicus left for Italy in the au¬
tumn of 1496, and remained in Bologna
until the spring of the jubilee year
1500, although Bishop Watzenrode had
in the meantime managed to have a
canonry of the Chapter of Warmia
conferred upon his nephew by 1497.
The presence of famous scholars at
the University of Bologna enabled
Copernicus to perfect his knowledge
of astronomy while at the same time
pursuing his canonical studies.
Copernicus' first recorded observa¬
tion dates from this period: that of the
eclipse of the bright star Aldebaran in
the constellation Taurus by the Moon,
on March 9, 1497. The observation
carried out in Bologna contradicted the
Ptolemaic theory of lunar motion, and
although it did not attack the funda¬
mentals of geocentric astronomy, it
nevertheless demonstrates Coperni¬
cus' critical approach to traditionally
accepted theories.
According to Ptolemaic theory, the
Moon should be much nearer the Earth
at the quadratures and during the full
and new Moon, but the careful obser¬
vations made by Copernicus in Bolo¬
gna showed that the Moon's parallax
at quadrature was virtually identical to
the parallax of the full Moon. In other
words, the distance between the Moon
and the Earth remained unchanged in
either of these positions.
Criticism and denial of the old sys¬
tems gave way to positive research,
which led to the construction, upon the
shattered remains of outdated theories,
of a new system much closer to the
actual truth. This is clearly demons¬
trated by the persevering studies car¬
ried out by Copernicus. He was in
Rome during the great Jubilee year of
1500, worked for some time in the
Vatican Chancery and, according to
tradition, gave public lectures in
astronomy.
In the spring of 1501, the young
scholar returned to Poland to take up
officially his post in the Chapter of
Warmia: the Chapter gave him permis¬
sion to go back to Italy, with injunc¬
tions to study medicine at the Univer¬
sity of Padua. Copernicus Jived in
Padua for two years until 1503, apart
from a few weeks spent in Ferrara,
where on May 31, 1503 he obtained
the degree of doctor of canon law.

studies in Padua and his later interest

(1491-1495) the University was ravaged by fire and the original Collegium Maius
was destroyed, to be replaced in 1494 by the present magnificent building.

OF COPERNICUS (Continued)
in this field are indicated by the hea¬
vily annotated works on medicine and
natural sciences found in his personal
library fifteen or so of these books
are still preserved in Uppsala Univer¬
sity Library (Sweden).
At the end of 1503, Copernicus once
again returned to Warmia, where he
joined his influential uncle Lucas Wat¬
zenrode in his residence at the epis¬
copal palace of Lidzbark. As the
Bishop's doctor and secretary, he ac¬
companied him on his frequent travels,
and historical evidence shows that his
office gave him ample opportunity to
practise his medical skills.
Copernicus was consulted by a
great number of important people, and
he treated a wide variety of ailments,
and of particular interest are his later
activities as a specialist in public
health and epidemiology, which he
carried out alongside his administrative
duties in the Chapter of Warmia.
During the ten years he spent with
Bishop Watzenrode, Copernicus was
inevitably drawn into political life. It
is certain that his sense of responsi¬
bility in public affairs, of which he
gave abundant proof during the fol¬
lowing years, derives from this period.
It is most probably from this time too
that he became increasingly interested
in the economic problems with which
he was already familiar through his
observation of the expansion of trade
and industry in the Italian towns he
visited during his years of study.
One thing which should be under¬
lined is that Copernicus' stay in Lidz¬
bark in no way diverted his attention
from his main subject of interest,
astronomy. It was in fact during this
period that he finally and irrevocably
formulated his brilliant thesis deposing
the earth from its central position, and
decided to put into writing the funda¬
mental postulates of the new astro¬
nomy.
This he did, in a treatise which was
not put into print, but was distributed
only in a very limited number of hand¬
written copies under the title Nicolai
Copernici de hypothesibus motuum
coelestium a se constitutis commen-
tariolus. (Nicholas Copernicus' Com¬
mentary on the Hypotheses of tne
Movement of the Celestial Orbs.)
The exact date of the Commentario-
lus is unknown, but it was probably
written shortly before 1509, during
which year a further aspect of Coper¬
nicus as a classical scholar was re¬
vealed In 1509 the letters of the
6th century Byzantine writer Theophy-
lact Simoccata appeared in Cracow in
a translation by Copernicus from
Greek into Latin.
Two dates mark the beginning of a
new phase in the life of Copernicus:
1510, the year of his installation at
Frombork and 1512, with the death of
Bishop Lucas Watzenrode. As he
approached his fortieth year, Coper-

The castle at Olsztyn, Poland, where Copernicus lived for several years. From 1516 to 1519 it was his residence as adminis¬
trator of the properties of the Chapter of Warmia. He returned to Olsztyn in 1520 on the outbreak of hostilities between
Poland and the Teutonic Knights to organize the defence of the fortress against a threatened siege. Despite his many
tasks, Copernicus continued his astronomical studies, using the big, first floor room whose windows are seen in this photo.

Copernicus noted down his first astronomical
observation while studying at the University
of Bologna (Italy) between 1496 and 1500. On the roof
of the university observatory (right) he used his
astronomical quadrant, here silhouetted against the
evening sky, to observe an eclipse of the moon
on March 9, 1497. Alongside the quadrant are the
Alfonsine planetary tables, compiled for Alfonso X
of Castile by Arabic, Jewish and Christian scholars
between 1248 and 1252. Lying beside the
tables is an early printed edition of the Almagest,
the astronomical and mathematical encyclopaedia
written in the 2nd century A.D. by Claudius
Ptolemy, of Alexandria.
The foundation
of modern science
From his 'remote corner of the world'
Copernicus set in motion
not only the Earth,
but the entire spirit of research
by Owen Gingerich

astrophysicist, Is professor of Astronomy and

and has taken part In Harvard astronomical
research expeditions to several countries,
Including Sri Lanka and Lebanon. He Is also

physical Observatory, In Cambridge, Massa¬

O a modern scientist,
science of the 15th century has a
strange and unfamiliar quality. When
Copernicus was born, men believed
that a weightless, crystalline sun
whirled daily around the earth.
Celestial motions were explained in
terms of strivings inherent in matter
itself. Professors of physics said that
a stone thrown from the hand flew
straight until it ran out of "impetus"
and then fell directly down to the
ground.
In 1543 Copernicus' masterpiece,
De revolutionibus ("Concerning the
Revolutions"), was published, and
in the century that followed, the
curious, time-honoured scientific expla¬
nations of antiquity and the Middle
Ages gave way to the ideas that form
the foundations of today's science.
A great change indeed a revolution
took place in that age, with Coper¬
nicus at its forefront. Far more than
political struggles, with their attendant
fleeting changes, the work of Coper¬
nicus and his Intellectual successors
has shaped our contemporary world.
If indeed Copernicus' contributions
triggered off the entire sequence of
ideas that have become modern
science, we may well ask why this is
a phenomenon only 500 years old.
What prevented the appearance of a
Copernicus a century or two before?
Was an earlier great unfolding of
science prevented by bonds of dogma
and ignorance?
Or, in a contrary view, 'should we
consider creative science a delicate
and fragile plant that blossoms forth
only in particularly germinal conditions?

that the great astronomer lived as a

contemporary of Columbus, Dürer,
Leonardo, Erasmus, and Luther. In
that case we can make a fascinating
inquiry: what factors contributed to the
remarkable flowering of science typi¬
fied by Copernicus?
The geocentric astronomy of Coper¬
nicus' day had served well for over
a thousand years; it meshed perfectly
with man's view of himself and with
the primitive physics of Aristotle. To
be sure, learned prelates recognized
that Easter was coming too early in
the calendar year, and a few astrolo¬
gers knew that the planets were some¬
times found several degrees from
positions predicted by tables based on
the venerable Ptolemaic theory. But
if there were a crisis in astronomy,
Astronomía had just as much of a
problem on her hands after Coper¬
nicus as before, for the calendar
remained the same and planetary pre¬
dictions were improved only a little.
No one knows precisely how or
when the Polish astronomer first seized
upon the idea of a sun-centred system;
in any event, by 1515 he was hard at
work on his manuscript of De revolu-
tionibus, a book that encompassed
both his new cosmology and a care¬
ful re-examination of old and new
planetary observations.
Nor do scholars know why he
adopted a heliocentric view of the
cosmos, for the observations of his day
could neither prove nor disprove his
idea. Nevertheless, there is a clue in
his own writings.
A euphoric sense of beauty pervades
the entire composition of the book:
For in this most beautiful temple, who
would place this lamp in another or
better position than that from which it
can light up the whole thing at the
same time?... We thus discover a
marvellous symmetry of the universe
and a fixed harmonious linkage as can
be found in no other way... So vast
is this divine handiwork of the most
excellent Almighty. Surely an
aesthetic vision gripped Copernicus
and guided his analysis of the heavens.
Yet it is a curious and nearly
forgotten fact that the Copernican
Revolution was nearly stillborn. Two
decades after he had begun his book,
Copernicus had run out of steam. By
then in his sixties, he had written the
most profound astronomical treatise in
a millenium, but the small technical
details lacked a final polish and inner
consistency. His manuscript was a
work of beauty, with exquisitely drafted
figures and two-colour tables, but

THE BOOK
THAT MOVED
THE WORLD
The original manuscript of
Copernicus' "On the Revo¬
lutions of the Heavenly
Spheres" is both a major
scientific treatise and a work
of art. Written in cursive and
formal styles of the 16th
century, the text is illustrated
with many astronomical dia¬
grams, inset in certain passa¬
ges or placed in the margins.
As an anniversary tribute to
Copernicus a full colour
fascimile of the manuscript
(now in the Jagiellonian
University Library, in Cracow)
is being published in several
countries. Right, the famous
diagram from the manuscript
in which Copernicus summa¬
rises his conception of the
Universe with the earth plac¬
ed in an orbit around the sun
exactly similar to those of the
other planets. Left, a later
illustration of the Copernican
system published in Amster¬
dam, in 1661, in Harmonía
macrocosmica (or New Uni¬
versal Atlas) by Andreas
Cellarius. Though it appeared
over a century after Coper¬
nicus' death, this work carried
only one illustration of his
theory of the universe.
THE FOUNDATION OF MODERN SCIENCE (Continued)
12
these paper folios had apparently been
designed as the end-product itself.
His post as canon of the Frombork
cathedral in Poland had given him
financial security and time for
contemplation, but it deprived him
of stimulating intellectual companion¬
ship. In short, there was no one to
talk to about his remarkable book,
that had been so long in the making.
Although Copernicus had found
printed works essential in his own
studies, printing was still a comparativ¬
ely new invention, one that had begun
to flourish only during his own lifetime.
There was as yet no printer in From¬
bork, and the aging astronomer
apparently had no intention of publish¬
ing his work elsewhere.
De revolutlonibus seemed destined
to gather dust in the cathedral library,
to be forgotten and ignored. Such a
fate seems incredible to us today yet
it must have overtaken scores of
astronomical achievements of the
Middle Ages.
But in 1539, in Copernicus' last
years, a young mathematician from
Germany appeared in Frombork, eager
to learn the details of the astronomer's
ideas. George Joachim Rheticus,
already a professor at Wittenberg
though just in his mid-twenties, had
heard rumours of the innovative
Copernican astronomy.
Although the young Rheticus came
from the hot-bed of Lutheranism, the
Catholic Copernicus received him with
courage and cordiality. Caught up by
the enthusiasm of his young disciple,
Copernicus made last-minute revisions
to his opus and then entrusted a
manuscript copy to Rheticus for publi¬
cation.
Rheticus took the manuscript to a
printer in Nuremberg, who finished the
production of several hundred copies
in 1543. These were sold to scholars
and libraries throughout all of Europe.
And thus it came about that the new
technology of printing was able to
play an absolutely essential role in
preserving and disseminating the new
astronomy.
The readers of Copernicus' treatise
gladly accepted his new planetary
observations and his careful attention
to the details of planetary orbits, but
the heliocentric world view itself found
little support. In our own age of
space exploration, when men have
looked back upon the spinning earth
suspended in the skies, the Copernican
system seems natural, almost obvious.
But to most astronomers of the late
1500s, imbued with the physics of
Aristotle, a moving earth had little
appeal. Instead, they chose a primi¬
tive form of relativity.
Keeping the earth as their fixed
reference framework, they viewed the
Copernican system as a clever mathe¬
matical model, somewhat more com¬
plicated than the old Ptolemaic system,
but not a true description ' of the
physical world. There was certainly
nothing obvious about a moving earth
and a fixed, central sun; Galileo later
remarked that he could not admire
enough those who had accepted the
Copernican system in spite of the
evidence of their senses.
NI EVERTHELESS, Coperni¬
cus' De revolutionibus acted like a
delayed action bomb. Around 1600
two great scientists, each in his own
individual way, grasped a truth in the
heliocentric system that went beyond
geometrical model-building. Johannes
Kepler saw in the sun-centred spacing
of the planets a harmonious, aesthetic
relation that could be expressed in
mathematical relations. He envisioned
a force emanating from the sun, and
built a "new astronomy or celestial
physics based on causes."
In Italy, Galileo Galilei turned the
newly invented telescope to the
heavens where he found one astonish¬
ing suprise after another. The moon,
filled with mountains and plains,
traversed the skies as another earth¬
like planet. And Jupiter, with its own
retinue of moons, became a miniature
Copernican system. To Galileo the
universe was comprehensible as a
unity only if the earth was a planet
revolving about the distant, fixed sun.
Both Kepler and Galileo differed

tion that had been added to De
revolutionibus when it was printed.
In that introduction the Lutheran
theologian Andreas Ossiander stated
a widely-held philosophical opinion:
astronomical theories were mathe¬
matical models intended for predictions
of astronomical phenomena, and
whether they were ultimately true or
false was irrelevant.
Such a view is logical and self-
consistent, but Kepler and Galileo
were convinced that their astronomy
gave a true picture of the universe.
This claim, plus their opinion that in
matters of science the Bible simply
spoke in the plain terms of common
man so as to be understood, brought
them into conflict with the Catholic
Church, and consequently several of
their works were placed on the Index
of Prohibited Books.
To a 20th century scientist, familiar
with the concept of relativity, it may
seem ultimately irrelevant whether the
earth or sun is the chosen fixed ref¬
erence point. But the 17th century
collision between religious dogma and
an innovative world view has had a
profound impact on mankind's views
concerning the source and nature of
truth about our physical world. And
in the 17th century it did make a
difference whether the universe was
conceived in geocentric or heliocentric
terms, because only a heliocentric
solar system leads onward to New¬
tonian physics.
In turn, Newton's laws of motion and
his law of Universal Gravitation
describe the orbits of satellites and
space probes. Thus there is a direct
line from Copernicus through Kepler,
Galileo and Newton to the marvels
of our own space age.
No doubt Copernicus would have
been astonished to learn that the world
would link his birthday to a celebration
of modern science. An unwitting re¬
volutionary, his goal was to return
science to a purer state, conceived in
terms of the perfect circles of the
ancient Greeks. He sought a view
"pleasing to the mind," and he gave
to the mind's eye a fruitful new way
of looking at the cosmos.
Still, our earlier question comes back
to haunt us. Why did this new view
wait until the early 1500s? The
answer lies not so much in the science
as in the society and in new¬
found patterns of communication. The
invention of printing and the rise of
universities encouraged the flow of
information and new ideas. The
discovery of America, while Copernicus
was a student at Cracow, helped
demonstrate the inadequacy of tradi¬
tional knowledge. A seething intellec¬
tual milieu, absent a century or two
earlier, characterized the age.
Furthermore, Copernicus had a
patron the Frombork cathedral chap¬
ter that enabled him to travel to Italy
for graduate study, and which freed
him from financial worries. More im
portantly, he had the time and freedom
to contemplate and choose innovative
views.
In that age of change, a new mobility
of ideas brought Copernicus fresh
knowledge that he required for building
his system, and at the end of his life
this same combination of travel,
freedom, and printing saved his work
from oblivion.
The new-found freedom of inquiry,
combined with the requisite intellectual
resources and the discipline to work
out the consequences and to test the
data this is without doubt more
important for the rise of modern
science than the specific idea of a sun-
centered cosmology.
We learn more for our own age from
Copernicus' persistence, his eagerness
to seek learning beyond his own
provincial boundaries, his willingness
to share with those outside his own
religion and nation, than we learn from
his formidable astronomical tome or
from his paeans to the heliocentric
cosmology.
From his "remote corner of the
world" Nicholas Copernicus set into
motion not only the earth, but the
entire spirit of inquiry that has so
richly increased our understanding of
the universe. But the ultimate reason
for the anniversary celebration and
indeed its challenge is a re-dedica¬
tion to preserve the fragile freedom of
inquiry and the resources that make
inquiry possible.

The making

Posterity has always been inclined
to regard men like Newton, or Einstein,
or Darwin, as radical innovators who,
all of a sudden and without previous
warning, changed the general course
of science and as a consequence
perturbed the whole attitude of man
towards the universe.
Certainly this has been the fate of
Copernicus who more than any other
scientist has been hailed as the first
harbinger of modern astronomy after
the long scientific somnolence of the
Middle Ages.
That such a view could emerge was
connected with the fact that the basic

principles of Copernican cosmology
were simple enough to be accessible
to a large public.
First, the Earth was set spinning
around its own axis. In Copernicus'
own words: Together with its surround¬
ing elements the Earth during a diurnal
motion performs a complete revolution
round its fixed poles, while the fir¬
mament and the highest heavens
remain motionless.
It is true that this idea was neither
new nor unknown to the late Middle
Ages, but it was so contrary to
ingrained conceptions that very few
had been able to believe in it or
assert it as true.
Next the Earth was removed from
its traditional position: The centre of
the Earth is not the centre of the Uni¬
verse ... All spheres rotate about the
Sun as their central point and therefore
the Sun is the centre of the Universe,
that is, of the planetary system and
the distant sphere of the fixed stars
which still was the outer boundary of
a world that even to Copernicus
remained spherical and of a finite size.
Finally, the Earth was deprived of
its unique character and reduced to a
mere planet among others: That which
to us appears as a movement of the
Sun is not due to any motion of the
latter, but to a motion of the Earth . . .
during which we rotate about the Sun
like any other planet.

NEW UNIVERSE (Continued)
Aristarchus of Samos:
the man forgotten by Antiquity
conceptions of the universe but also
with the belief in man's favoured abode
near the very centre of all creation.
This explains why the inevitable
clash between the rival cosmologies
had to spread far beyond scientific
circles, arousing an ideological combat
on a scale and of a ruthlessness which
the world was not to see again until
the coming of evolutionism challenged
a different, but equally cherished set
of ideas about the uniqueness of man.
Thus the Copernican revolution
became a paramount factor in the
intellectual development of mankind,
and we have sufficient reasons for
honouring the memory of the man who
first inaugurated it.
But along with general or popular
discussions went the more careful
deliberations of professional astro¬
nomers on the more technical implica¬
tions of the new theory. Copernicus
had himself clad it in the well-known
mathematical language of traditional
astronomy.
Consequently his great work, De
revolutionibus orbium coelestium (Con¬
cerning the Revolutions of the Celes¬
tial Spheres), was intelligible to any¬
body who knew and understood Ptol¬
emy's Almagest upon which it was
modelled. This meant that all com
petent scholars were soon forced to
admit that Copernican astronomy was
acceptable as a possible and consis¬
tent mathematical hypothesis.
But this was not the crux of the
matter. Any careful reader of De
revolutionibus would realize that Coper¬
nicus went much further, claiming his
theory to be true in the sense that it
gave a correct picture of the physical
structure of the universe. This claim
was the starting point of the extra¬
ordinary scientific development fol¬
lowing in the wake of Copernican
astronomy.
On the one hand it gave rise to the
attempts at verifying the new theory
by means of observations, first and
foremost through a search for the
annual parallactic motion of the fixed
stars implied by the movement of the
Earth around the Sun. This work
occupied successive generations of
practical astronomers from Tycho
Brahe onwards until in 1838 it was
finally crowned by success when
Bessel succeeded in determining the
parallax of the star 61 Cygni.
On the other hand the claim that
the Copernican system was true in a
physical sense guided Galileo and
many other physicists in their attempts
to create a theory of mechanics compa-

The first European treatise on astro¬
nomy, "Sphaera mundi", was written In
about 1230 by an English cleric John
of Hollywood, or Johannis de Sacro-
bosco as he signed his name in Latin.
His work was based on an elementary
Arab version of Ptolemy's "Almagest".
In it the earth is seen as motionless
at the centre of the universe. Widely
distributed throughout Europe, Sacro-
bosco's work was spreading the doc¬
trine of geocentrism long after the
publication of Copernicus' studies, as

tibie with the new astronomy and able
to remove the obstacles raised by the
traditional, Aristotelian physics, in par¬
ticular the doctrine of natural motion
and natural place, and the conception
of gravity as a force directed towards
the centre of the universe. The maj¬
estic structure of classical, Newtonian
mechanics was the final outcome of
this struggle.
These few remarks will suffice to
justify the opinion that Copernicus is
one of the founders of the modern
world, both in the ideological and
scientific sense. It is no wonder that
both the history of ideas and the his¬
tory of science have found a wealth
of material in the Copernican heritage
and that they are still far from having
exhausted it.
On the other hand we must admit
that Copernicus presents also other
problems of a more intriguing nature.
Certainly, to prove his importance it
is enough to point to the consequen¬
ces of his achievement; but to eval¬
uate his greatness it is also neces¬
sary to examine the background of
his work.
No single event in the intellectual
history of mankind exists in isolation.
It has its antecedents, and although
individual scientists occasionally suc¬
ceed in presenting the world with a
new idea, there will always be certain
conditioning influences for which the
historian has to search not in order
to deprive the real innovator of his
creative genius, but to put it into a
broader perspective and underline the
fundamental continuity of the historical
process.
1 OPERNICUS had his scien¬
tific initiation at the University of
Cracow which was deeply imbued
with the spirit of the Viennese astro¬
nomers Peurbach and Regiomontanus.
As good Humanists they had tried to
reform astronomy through a conscious
return to its classical sources, for
instance by undertaking a new and im¬
proved translation of Ptolemy's Alma¬
gest.
In the preface to De revolutionibus,
Copernicus admits to a similar
Humanist approach; in fact, his search
through classical authors had led him
to two Pythagorean astronomers, Hice-
tas and Ecphantos, who assumed a
moving earth. However, this is practi¬
cally everything we know about them,
and one hesitates to regard such
a slender tradition as the source of
one of the major cosmological revolu¬
tions of all times.
And Copernicus' more aesthetic
reflections on the most suitable posi¬
tion of such an august body as the
sun may be regarded as a mere after¬
thought without real importance to the
establishing of his cosmology.
A much more plausible inspiration
would have been the famous Aris-
tarchus of Samos who in the third
century B.C. devised an heliocentric
cosmology very similar to the Coper¬
nican system. In fact, the original
manuscript of De revolutionibus dev¬
otes a long passage to Aristarchus
who accordingly was well known to
Copernicus who, nevertheless, deleted
this very passage from the printed
version of his book.
This remarkable omission is, indeed,
hard to explain; perhaps Copernicus
was afraid that the memory of how
the heliocentric system was rejected
in Antiquity might prejudice the accep¬
tance of his own theory.
The surmise that Copernicus found
in Aristarchus a point of departure
for his own thought does not answer
the fundamental question why he was
so dissatisfied with the prevailing
astronomical ideas that he had to
seek an alternative description of
celestial phenomena. This is a more
intricate problem which cannot be
illustrated by mere cosmological con¬
siderations without reference to theo¬
retical astronomy and planetary theory.
Here it is evident that Copernicus
was not concerned with renewing the
mathematical tools of traditional astro¬
nomy. Like Hipparchus and Ptolemy
he described the movements of the
planets by constructing geometrico-
kinematical models simulating the
observable phenomena as closely as
possible.
Ultimately everything had to be re¬
duced to an interplay of circular mo¬
tions which must be uniform about
their respective centres, a fundamental
assumption to which Copernicus
adhered even more strictly than Ptol¬
emy. In this respect Copernicus ap¬
pears in a most traditional light and
it was left to Kepler to introduce
fundamentally new conceptions in the
form of elliptical orbits.
Such geometrical models had to be
provided with numerical parameters
derived from observations. Here, too,
Copernicus proceeded exactly in the
same way as many Arabic or Latin
astronomers, relying upon data record¬
ed by Ptolemy or other ancient obser¬
vers, and supplementing them by a
few observations of his own.
Because a long span of time had
elapsed since Antiquity this should
lead to improved values of the various
mean motions; but it is important to
remember that such improvements are
independent of cosmological consid¬
erations. A simple transformation of
co-ordinates from a geocentric to a
heliocentric frame of reference is
unable to increase the accuracy of
astronomical theories.
Accordingly we must conclude that
the desire for more accurate theories
was no argument for the Copernican
system. On the other hand the new
system could not be proved or dis¬
proved until observational astronomy
was accurate enough to decide whe¬
ther the fixed stars have a parallax,
that is, a small, apparent displacement
due to the annual motion of the
Earth. This moved Tycho Brahe and
later astronomers to improve obser¬
vational techniques until finally in 1838
the effect was discovered by Bessel.
new and unexpected light
was shed upon some of the more
technical details of the work of Coper¬
nicus when in 1957 V. Roberts show¬
ed that the beautiful theory of the
moon's motion contained in. De revo¬
lutionibus was in every respect iden¬
tical with the Lunar theory of the 14th
century Damascene astronomer Ibn
ash-Shatir.
Further research by V. Roberts,
E.S. Kennedy, and F. Abbud proved
also that the geometrical structure
of the theory of Mercury was the same
in the two authors. In particular they
both make use of a special kinematical
device for producing rectilinear
motion by combining two circular
motions. This device was invented
by the 13th century Maragha scien¬
tist Nasir al-Din al-Tusi. W. Hartner
has argued in a very convincing way
that this remarkable agreement proves
that Copernicus was influenced by
Moslem astronomy through chan¬
nels which remain to be identified.
These discoveries do not detract
from the originality of Copernicus.
There is not the slightest trace of
heliocentric ideas in any of the Oriental
astronomers mentioned above, and the
credit for the most important break¬
through in the history of astronomy still
goes undiminished to the author of
De revolutionibus orbium coelestium.
Everything considered it seems that
the most plausible motivation for the
new system was Copernicus' earnest
desire for a cosmology which would
give more simplicity and uniformity to
theoretical astronomy than the old,
geocentric view of the universe.
In particular he seems to have
been worried by two obvious short¬
comings of Ptolemaic astronomy. First, .
although Ptolemy had to use a variety 1 7
of geometrical models for the motions
of the different planets, he also had to
provide each model with a component,

circular motion with a period of revolu¬
tion of precisely one year.
Second, Ptolemy was unable to
determine both the absolute as well as
the relative distances of the planets
from the Earth, so that their commonly
accepted order was no more than an
arbitrary convention.
Both these facts had been known
since Antiquity, but no astronomer
seems to have been seriously troubled
by them until Copernicus showed how
they could be overcome by a single
remedy. Here we must admit that the
heliocentric theory was a real stroke
of genius.
Thus the annual period found in all
planetary motions ceased to be a
mysterious coincidence and became a
simple consequence of the annual
motion of the Earth around the Sun.
One of the most enigmatic features of
the motions of the planets had thus
found a rational explanation.
A further consequence was that
Copernicus could dispense with the
five circles usually called epicycles
which in Ptolemaic astronomy had
been responsible for the annual period
in the motions of the five ordinary
planets. As a result the geometry of
the whole planetary system became
somewhat simplified, the role of the
five epicycles being taken over by
the one orbit of the Earth.
The final triumph of the Copernican
system followed directly from this latter
circumstance. Already Ptolemy had
been able to determine (from observa¬
tions) the ratio of the radius of each
epicycle to the mean distance of the
corresponding planet. The Copernican
theory reduced, as it were, all the
epicycles to the same size (viz. that
of the orbit of the Earth). Conse¬
quently the mean distances of all the
planets can be expressed in units of
the radius of the orbit of the Earth.
To the greater clarity and simplicity
of his system' Copernicus was thus
able to add the correct order, and
exact distances of the planets from
the Sun. For the first time in the
history of astronomy the solar system
became an ordered whole instead of
an arbitrary structure.
The Copernican system had a pre¬
history comprising many separate
elements cosmological speculations
of ancient astronomers, mathematical
tools borrowed from Ptolemy and the
Arabs, and a series of observations
ranging from classical times to Coper¬
nicus himself.
The proper genius of Copernicus
lay in the fact that he was the first to
wonder at mysterious coincidences and
arbitrary conventions with which lesser
spirits had long ago come to terms. M
At Torun, birthplace of Nicholas Copernicus, the secondary
school is named in honour of the town's most famous citizen.
Here, children proudly lift a bust of Copernicus to place it on a

IN THE FOOTSTEPS OF COPERNICUS
(Continued from page 8)
nicus was faced with an enormous
scientific task: to define and expound
the heliocentric order of the universe
in a work as wide-ranging and exhaus¬
tive as Ptolemy's Amalgest. Coper¬
nicus was to devote the rest of his
life to this undertaking.
Without going into detail upon Ni¬
cholas Copernicus' duties as a mem¬
ber of the Chapter of Warmia, we
should however note the fact that when
the opening chapters of the great
astronomer's memorable treatise were
written, he was also exercising and
highly efficiently numerous time-
absorbing administrative, economic
and political functions.
U ROM 1516 to 1519, Coper-
pernicus lived In Olsztyn, where he
managed the property of the Chapter.
In spite of these activities he in no
way neglected his astronomy, and the
ingenious observation apparatus built
by Copernicus himself can still be
seen at Olsztyn castle, which is now
a museum.
After the death of Lucas Watzenrode,
Warmia went through extremely diffi¬
cult times, during which the Teutonic
Knights waged undeclared war upon
the region, plaguing the diocesan lands
with their armed incursions.
Olsztyn was in close proximity to
the frontier of the monastic State, and
when in 1520 war again broke out
between Poland and the Teutonic
Order, Copernicus returned there to
organize the defence of the fortress
against the impending siege. When
the subsequent peace treaty was con¬
cluded in 1521, he was able to go
back to Frombork.
There he continued his opposition
to the Teutonic Knights on a different
level: the battle-ground of economics.
The fact was that the Teutonic Order
was striking false coins, and thus
causing the disruption of the Pom¬
eranian currency market. After a num¬
ber of interventions on this matter,
Copernicus published in 1526 his Trea¬
tise on Currency, In which he explained
the mechanism according to which
"bad money drives out good".
The formulation of this principle,
known as the Gresham-Copernicus
Law, (it was also expounded by a 16th-
century English merchant, Sir Thomas
Gresham) is by no means the great
astronomer's sole claim to fame in the
field of political economy. To Coper¬
nicus, "good" money, or currency
which consistently maintains its full
value, is as much the result as the
condition of "enrichment", or In other
words, of a healthy economy based
upon the work of "excellent workers"
and a well-organized system of ex¬
change.
Copernicus gives us a highly accu¬
rate definition of the true stimulants
to economic activity a definition
which has little to do with the moral
imperatives of plain hard work expoun¬
ded by the scholastic philosophers.
During the years following his return
from Olsztyn to Frombork, Copernicus
crystallized the formulation of the plan
for his major work, later known under
the title De revolutionibus orbium coe-
lestium, and written in six sections or
books, which was to be the great
Polish astronomer's immortal contribu¬
tion to world scientific literature.
The revolutionary element of Coper¬
nicus' work lies in his elaboration of
entirely new cosmological principles,
by which he stripped the earth of its
role as the Centre of the Universe,
discovered its daily and annual move¬
ments, and redetermined the planetary
system with the predominant position
now attributed to the sun. The treatise
was put into its final form in the early
1530s, but another ten years were to
go by before it was actually printed.
The publication of the printed edition
of the De revolutionibus has a history
of its own. In 1539, Georg Joachim
Rheticus, a young professor of astro¬
nomy from Wittenburg, arrived in War¬
mia, drawn by the rumours in Europe
about the astounding work being done
by the solitary Frombork astronomer.
It was thanks to Rheticus and
Tiedman Giese, Bishop of Chelmno,
humanist and faithful friend of the
astronomer, that Copernicus eventually
allowed himself to be persuaded to
publish his work, and finally prepared
a copy of the treatise for printing.
Rheticus himself published a volume
entitled De Libris Revolutionum D.
Doctoris Nicolai Copernici Narratio
Prima (Gdansk, 1540), which heralded
the appearance of the great work itself.
Two years later, Rheticus published a
lengthy extract from Copernicus' trea¬
tise, dealing with spherical trigono¬
metry.
Science historians will long be fasci¬
nated by all the events surrounding
the printing of De revolutionibus in
Nuremberg, and the part played by
the astronomer Johannes Schöner and,
especially, the theologian Andreas
Ossiander, who both verified the text.
The prudent anonymous foreword
inserted by the publishers when print¬
ing was already under way, which
puts Copernicus' theory forward as a
purely formal hypothesis, contrasts
sharply with the magnificent letter of
dedication addressed by Copernicus to
Pope Paul III, which is an admirable
eulogy upon astronomy and its cogni¬
tive values.
Tradition has it that the first copy of
the work, printed in Nuremberg,
reached Copernicus only on May 24,
1543, the very day of his death at
the end of a long illness.
More than eighteen centuries lie bet¬
ween Copernicus and Aristotle, the
"Prince of Philosophers" of ancient
times, and for 13 centuries, Ptolemy's
Almagest had invariably been accepted
as the perfect representation of the
system of the Universe. The mere
four hundred years or so since the
beginning of the revolution in modern
thinking set in motion by Copernicus
has to be compared with a period of
almost two thousand years of intellec¬
tual stagnation.
'URING the first century
following the death of Copernicus the
names of the illustrious pioneers of
our own knowledge of the universe
were recorded in the annals of
science. Galileo and Kepler both drew
their inspiration from the work of
Copernicus, and it culminated in the
appearance of Newton's Principles.
In the dedication of De revolutioni¬
bus Copernicus wrote: "If, however,
there be guileful men who, although
they know nothing of mathematics,
nonetheless allow themselves to pass
judgement upon such matters, and
who, on the basis of a cunningly dis¬
torted interpretation of a passage of
the Scriptures, dare to attack and
condemn my work, I dismiss them so
entirely as to despise their judgement
as blindly presumptuous."
Copernicus had the courage to ex¬
pound his innovative ideas in a scien¬
tific work of profound maturity and to
contradict the traditional authority of
the Ancients. This is why today the
world is celebrating the quincentenary
of his birth.
The object of our admiration is not
only the creator of the heliocentric
system: to an even greater extent,
Copernicus should be remembered as
the scholar who opened the way for -i n
the long procession of the creators | q
of modern science.

Roman Empire and a series of econo¬
mic and social revolutions that followed
geographical discoveries and epic
voyages of exploration. It saw the
start of the break up of the European
feudal system and the consolidation of
the great European States.
Copernicus was a contemporary of
the humanist Erasmus of Rotterdam
and the reformer Luther, of King Henry
VIII of England, under whom the English
Church gained its independence from
Rome, of Emperor Charles V, of
Michelangelo and Leonardo da Vinci,
of the Swiss astrologer and doctor
Paracelcus and of Machiavelli the
great Italian theoretician of political
science.
The cultural world around Coper¬
nicus was in ferment and thirsting for
new things. The Protestant Reforma¬
tion claimed the right to interpret the
scriptures freely and was a determi¬
nant factor in the breakaway from the
rigid intellectual discipline that was a
feature of medieval civilization. The
Astronomy class for Leonardo,
Michelangelo and the Pope
After completing his studies at the University of Bologna (Italy)
Copernicus went to Rome where, in the year 1500, he gave a
course of lectures on mathematics and astronomy, in which
he is said to have drawn attention to the faults in Ptolemy's
conception of the universe. In this 19th century painting,
Wojciech Gerson, a Polish artist, shows Copernicus lecturing
in the presence of Pope Alexander VI. The scene is imaginary,
but all the persons depicted are known to have been at the
Papal court of that time. In addition to Pope Alexander (1),
the distinguished audience includes Leonardo da Vinci (2),
Michelangelo (3), Caesar Borgia (4), the painter Pietro Peru-
gino (5), the architect Donato Bramante (6) and Baldassare
Castiglione, diplomat and author (7).
artists and scientists of his time were
also fired with the desire for complete
renewal and an open-minded approach
to nature.
Leonardo da Vinci (1452-1519) pro¬
claimed the need for an honest study
of the reality of nature enabling phe¬
nomena to be accurately described and
measured. Research into nature, he
declared, should use the tools of
mathematics and the analytical capaci¬
ty of human vision and should, above
all, put an end to the simple repetition
of already prevalent ideas.
Those who base their assertions on
quotations from the authorities of the
past and on what is written in the
old books, wrote Leonardo, "are not
using their imagination but their
memory."
No credence should be given to
those philosophers "whose arguments
are not confirmed by experiment."
Leonardo invoked "experiment" and
"reason" at one and the same time;
he preached the need to weld to¬
gether experimental contact with the
world and abstract or mathematical
theories opening the door to the inner¬
most secrets of the universe.
Contesting the culture of university
professors and "men of letters", Leo¬
nardo described himself as an "un¬
lettered man". Typical of his thought
and the thought of his time was
an insatiable curiosity with regard to
nature. Why were shells found on
mountains? How was it that birds
could fly? What caused the wind?
What were the mechanics of walking
in men and in animals?
These were the origins, apart from
his activity as an artist, of Leonardo's
innumerable plans for machines, his
anatomical research, and his pages of
reflections on science and on what
science should be about.
Violent disagreement with the
followers of Aristotle, a burning pas¬
sion for knowledge of the "mysteries
of the sky and the secrets of nature",
and an encyclopaedic mentality thirst¬
ing for information about all branches
of knowledge, also marked some of
the most famous practitioners of the
so-called "natural magic" of the Re¬
naissance: the Italian Girolamo Car-
dano (1501-1576), the Swiss Paracelcus
(1493-1541), the German Heinrich Cor¬
nelius Agrippa (1486-1534) and the
Italian Gian Battista della Porta (1535-
1615).
The "revival of magic", with which
these doctors and astrologers were
concerned, was above all a study of
natural effects. They felt that it would
give man dominion of the world, and
that man could only achieve this result
by becoming the "minister" or servant
of nature.
The miracles of magic, wrote Cor¬
nelius Agrippa in his work De vanitate
scientiarum. (On the Vanity of Science)
are very different from those described
by religions. In the latter there is
violation of the laws of nature whereas

CULTURAL REVOLUTION (Continued)
Medieval beliefs and the new thinking
For a long period of his life
Copernicus was more highly
esteemed as a doctor than as an
astronomer. From 1501 to 1503
he studied medicine at the University
of Padua, the foremost centre of
medical learning of the day. New
approaches were being made to
the study of anatomy but research
on human cadavers had only
recently been authorized and
Copernicus' medical studies were
quite conventional. The anatomy
amphitheatre at Padua, shown
in the engraving above, was not
erected until 1594, more than
50 years after the death
of Copernicus.

operations carried out by man on
nature.
These miracles (in the etymological
sense of the Latin word miracula) are
no more than "things which ought to
arouse wonder", and primarily consist
in the ability to speed up the processes
of nature: by shortening the time that
nature needs to ripen fruit on the trees,
for example, or to modify the rhythm
of the seasons by farming techniques.
Before going further it might be use¬
ful to explain some of the fundamen¬
tal aspects of the age in which Coper¬
nicus lived.
The distinction between magic and
science, so obvious today, was not by
any means evident in the first half of
the sixteenth century. The thirst for
experiment, the study of nature and
the observation of phenomena were
exalted and proclaimed at that time
as part of a vision of the world which
is very different from that held in the
next century by Francis Bacon, René
Descartes and Galileo.
The founders of modern science (and
of modern philosophy) waged a bitter
battle (as did Bacon) against the
"magic" mentality of the preceding
century or regarded that mentality (as
did Descartes and Galileo) as an out¬
dated way of thinking with which a na¬
tural philosopher or a scientist should
not concern himself. Copernicus liv¬
ed in an age in which the distinction
between magic and science was not
as clearcut as it came to be later.
The rebellion against traditional
thinking and above all against Aristote¬
lian philosophy was a key theme of the
Renaissance. The French philosopher
and grammarian, Pierre de La Ramée
(Petrus Ramus) claimed to be able to
demonstrate the falsity of all Aristotle's
doctrines.
This rejection of tradition and this
general desire for innovation also im¬
plied a breakaway by the new culture
from the world of the universities in
which Aristotelian philosophy was still
dominant. A majority of scientists in
the 16th century studied in the uni¬
versities and in many cases taught in
them but there is no doubt that the
liveliest discussion that concerning
scientific and cultural innovation no
longer took place within the walls of
the universities as had happened in
the Middle Ages.
The universities, in the second half
of the 16th century and during the
next century, lacked the ability for the
new thinking necessary in times of
rapid intellectual development. The
new Copernican astronomy was to be
very slow in conquering the academic
world. The old Ptolemaic astronomy
continued to be taught for more than
a century after the publication of De
revolutionibus, and Galileo himself
gave courses in Ptolemaic astronomy.
During the years in which a new
method was evolved based on the
recently-discovered texts of Archime¬
des, Euclid was still read in the uni¬
versities. Mondino's work on anatomy
(which was typically medieval in its
approach) long continued to be the
medical students' textbook even after
the appearance of the first modern
book on anatomy, published by Andrea
Vesalius in 1543.
From this situation stemmed the
need for the renovation of institutions,
closely tied up with the need for new
methods of acquiring and transmitting
learning. The groups of student follow¬
ers of a single master, the aca¬
demies, and the scientific societies
that came into being in Europe in the
16th and 17th centuries tended to meet
these new requirements.
Copernicus' great work triggered
off the scientific revolution which
came to full flower in the writings of
Newton and from which many funda¬
mental aspects of the modern world
are derived. From this revolution were
born new forms of physics, astronomy
and medicine, totally different from
those of the ancient Greeks and
Romans.
The contribution made by Copernicus
to the scientific revolution concerns
astronomy, but we should not regard
Copernicus as an astronomer in the
technical and modern sense of the
word. Copernicus was a man imbued
with the culture of his time and his
training was that of a humanist (in
the meaning this term had in his day).
He was learned in law, medicine,
economics, and administration. In the
universities of Cracow, Bologna, Padua
and Ferrara, he studied in turn mathe¬
matics, astronomy, law, medicine and
philosophy. In Italy he learned Greek
and read Plato. One of his teachers,
the astronomer Domenico Maria da
Novara, was a follower of the Platonic
and Pythagorean philosophy that domi¬
nated Italian Renaissance culture.
As with many humanists, Copernicus
presented his astronomical discoveries
and his new world system, not in the
form of a reasoned refutation of tra¬
ditional theories, but as a revival of
Pythagorean theories. He presented
his theory to the reader as being inti¬
mately bound up with a contemplation
of the world looked upon as a revela¬
tion or manifestation of God.
He set out his discoveries in a reli¬
gious context. The sun, lord and king
of the visible world was a symbol of
God.
This glorification of the sun and the
repeated references to Pythagoras
found in De revolutionibus link the
thinking of Copernicus with one of the
main currents of Renaissance philoso¬
phy.

had begun his translation of Plato's

According to a learned paper published in 1726
by an eminent French scholar of Greek
literature, Jean Boivin, the Greek poet Homer
imagined that Mount Olympus, the home of
the gods, was a mountain which rested
on the sky and whose summit pointed down
towards earth. In a passage from the "Iliad",
illustrated by the engraving, left, Zeus speaks
of suspending the earth in the air from
a golden chain attached to the
highest point of Mount Olympus.

Dialogues. Even before working on
Plato he had translated into Latin the
much famed Corpus hermeticum
a collection of the writings of Greek
authors living between the third and
first centuries before Christ.
These writings, a mixture of Platonic
and Stoic themes and showing the
influence of Hebrew and Persian phi¬
losophy, were attributed by Ficino to
a mythical Egyptian being the god
Thoth identified by the Greeks as
their god Hermes and sometimes
known as Trismegistos (thrice great).
In Platonic philosophy Marsilio Ficino
saw a doctrine of the eternal religious
revelation, made manifest in every age
and finding its highest form of ex¬
pression in Hebraism and Christianity.
This religious philosophy, stated
Ficino, "was born with Zoroaster
among the Persians and with Hermes
among the Egyptians, nurtured with
Orpheus among the Thracians, dev¬
eloped with Pythagoras among the
Greeks and the Italiotes and reached
its zenith in Athens with Plato". To
Ficino and to the Italian Renaissance
Platonists, philosophy and religion
were not two separate things: great
philosophical thought and the sacred
writings of the various religions all
converged towards the same result.
In a passage from De revolutionibus
concerning the central position of the
sun, Copernicus refers explicitly to the
name of Hermes Trismegistos. His new
astronomic doctrine first saw the light
of day in a philosophic and religious
context that was clearly neo-Platonic
in inspiration, and he used a quotation
from a famous work in which Hermes
had described the sun cult of the
ancient Egyptians.
For us Copernicus' book has become
a point of departure, and almost the
symbol of the intellectual revolution
from which modern science has sprung.
As we have seen, this book was
written in an age which hungered for
new things, which was prepared to
question traditional beliefs, and which
struggled in the difficulties arising from
the gap between scientific and schol¬
astic institutions and the real progress
of science.
It was not by chance that all this
happened, and in this sense the book
of Copernicus is one of the charac¬
teristic expressions of the dawn of
modern culture. And yet Copernicus,
deeply imbued with neo-Platonic phi¬
losophy, preferred to present his new
picture of the world as a revival of
old doctrines rather than as a revolu¬
tionary innovation.
He was a timid and cautious man.
Perhaps his interest in the sun
which was one of the main topics of
neo-Platonic philosophy of the 16th
century spurred him to his astro¬
nomic research aimed at proving the
sun to be the centre of the universe.
Perhaps also he was endeavouring to
make what was new in his astronomy
acceptable to his contemporaries by
setting it in a philosophical context
familiar to the intellectuals of his time.
At all events, it is clear that Coper¬
nicus used to the full two great lessons
of 16th century thought: that the dis¬
covery of geometrical and arithmetical
regularity in nature is essential for the
understanding of the world; and that
the truths handed down from antiquity
should be examined critically and, if
necessary, revised.

Three thinkers who dared to challenge

<![CDATA[
I N his famous treatise
Metaphysics, Aristotle says that,
among the mathematical sciences,
astronomy is closest to philosophy
since it deals with the nature of the
stars, and these are eternal even
though perceptible to our senses. In
the order of things, as seen by Aris¬
totle, God was thought of thought
and Prime Mover of the eternal heav¬
ens.
The old, pre-Christian world shrank
from pursuing this line of philosoph¬
ical thought to its ultimate conclusion
which would have led to the separa¬
tion of God from nature. In some
way nature had to be cloaked in
divinity so that metaphysics and reli¬
gion could be reconciled with the
evidence of the senses.
VINCENZO CAPPELLETTI is professor of the
History of Science at the University of Rome.
Director-General of the "Enciclopedia Ita¬
liana", and director of the review "II Veltro",
he is author of many books on the history
of biology, physics and psychology. His
publications on these subjects Include 'Ente-
lechla" (1965), "Helmholtz" (1967), "S. Weil
- Su//a Scienza' (1971) and "Metapsicologia
di Freud" (1972).
Before Copernicus, metaphysics and
the phenomena experienced by the
senses were in agreement on one
point the earth was fixed in the cos¬
mos and it was the stars that moved.
They moved in a circular path, that
is to say with a movement in which
beginning and end were ever joined,
thus reproducing eternity in time.
The important thing for the Ancients,
in the platonists' famous phrase, was
"to preserve the phenomena" (to fit
observed facts into theory), and this
seemed a better way of "preserving"
them than any other.
On this point, in Galileo's Dialogue
of the Two Chief World Systems,
Simplicio makes an enlightening com¬
ment: "The Copernican doctrine means
denying the senses and above all the
sensations. This must be the case if,
though we are aware of the gentlest
breeze, we cannot feel the blast of
a perpetual wind reaching us at a
speed of over 2,559 miles an hour,
for this is the distance that the cen¬
tre of the earth covers in one hour
along the circumference of the great
orb, according to Copernicus' meticu¬
lous calculations."
To commemorate the
achievement of Copernicus,
the authorities of Torun, birth¬
place of the great astronomer,
organized a nationwide design
contest for a monument to be
raised in the town (see also
page 4). Here are two of the
30 or so projects expressing the
Copernican conception of the
solar system submitted by Polish
sculptors. Far left, "Dawn" by
Bronislaw Chromy; left,
"Nicholas Copernicus" by
Gustaw Zemla.
Many things seemed, and would
seem, more simple if the immobility
of the heavenly body on which man
lives were to be accepted. It was
not until Galileo and his intuition of-
the notion of mass that this assertion
could be disproved.
Aristotelian thinking had succeeded
in separating the destructible, imper¬
fect earth, from the indestructible
purity of the heavens in which it set
God the Mover of the world.
In spite of St. Paul and St. Augus¬
tine, early Christian thinkers found
themselves in the blind alley of natu¬
ralistic theology. The fathers of the
Syriac church formulated a literal
interpretation of Genesis (the crea¬
tion of the world in seven days) which
was in many respects at variance
with the Greek scientific tradition;
Cosmas Indicopleustes (a little-known
Greek thinker who visited India)
attempted to replace pagan topogra¬
phy and cosmology by "a Christian n-m
topography of the Universe". For Cos- //
mas, the earth was not in the centre
of the universe but at the lowest
point of the solar system; a rectan-

guiar plane covered by the vault of
the firmament.
The real interest in all this, how¬
ever, lies not in the mistake itself (a
mistake which was to cause Coper¬
nicus serious difficulties and bring
Galileo before his judges), but thev
criterion on which it was based that
science was subservient to religion
and metaphysics.
Copernicus himself believed in an
order, a perfection of the world which
had to be preserved. And it is in
this respect, in spite of the majestic
grandeur of his work which is due
to the unswerving rationality of his
system, that Copernicus still seems
to us to belong to antiquity. In the
dedication of De revolutionibus (On
the Revolutions) to Pope Paul III, he
maintains that in accepting the theory
of eccentrics and epicycles the cham¬
pions of geocentrism have compro¬
mised "the shape of the world and
the undoubted symmetry of its parts".
The first chapter of De revolutioni¬
bus opens with a further profession
of faith in the perfect structure of
nature: "We must first observe that
the world is spherical both because
this shape is the most perfect of all,
forming an unbroken totality, and
because this shape has the greatest
capacity and therefore is the most
suitable for that which is required
to embrace and conserve all things".
The central position of the earth
was finally accepted by the Chris¬
tians of the Middle Ages as it had
been by pagan antiquity. Aristotle
and the Bible, the Ptolemaic universe
and the universe revealed by the
Bible could both agree with Thomas
Aquinas that reason and revelation
were not self-contradictory.
Whether as God's pedestal, accord¬
ing to Cosmas Indicopleustes, the
part of the world opposite to the fir¬
mament-paradise, according to Hono-
rius d'Autun, or the seat of hell, as
Dante saw it, the earth was given
a precise position in the cosmos by
a Christianity as yet not fully aware
of the spiritual revolution brought
about by the Gospels.
In fact, naturalistic metaphysics had
deformed the facts of experience, or
rather it had glossed over the contra¬
dictory aspects of observation. In
its endeavour to reconcile the world
and God it had omitted to reconcile
the world with the mind, with human
thought. In a marvellous passage, in
De revolutionibus, Copernicus speaks
of "thought blown hither and thither".
The original purity of the system
of spheres all with the same centre,
conceived by the Greek mathemati¬
cian Eudoxus of Cnidus early in the
4th century B.C., had undergone gra¬
dual decay, interrupted by moments
of true inventive genius, to culminate
in the tardy synthesis of Claudius
Ptolemy's Almagest in the 2nd cen¬
tury A.D. Although the evidence of
the senses appeared to support the
cause of geocentric astronomy, it
also contained elements which provid¬
ed a basis for the formulation of
various other theories.
In Galileo's Dialogue, Simplicio
asks Salviati: "But from what do you
argue that it is not the earth but
the sun which is the centre of the
movements of the planets?" And
Salviati replies: "This is a matter of
observations which are wholly obvious
and therefore necessarily conclusive;
and of these observations, the most
telling, which allows us to remove
the earth from the centre and put
the sun in its place, is the fact that
all these planets are sometimes close
to the earth and sometimes farther
away. And these variations in dis¬
tance are so great that Venus, for
example, is six times farther away
from us when at her farthest point
than at her closest point, and that
Mars is eight times farther away. You
can clearly see that Aristotle was
somewhat mistaken in thinking that
these planets were always at the
same distance from the earth."
As well as the geocentric princi¬
ple, the ancient world had known the
heliocentric principle devised in the
first half of the 3rd century B.C. by
Aristarchus of Samos. Archimedes,
through whom we know of Aristachus'
heliocentric theory, put forward some
objections but was not unduly shock¬
ed by it.

Copernicus makes many referen¬
ces to the heliocentrism of the
ancients as if needing the hallowed
authority of the classical era as sup¬
port to his own revolutionary proposi¬
tions. In De revolutionibus he
demands the same "freedom to ima¬
gine" that Aristarchus and others had
allowed themselves in their explana¬
tions of astronomical phenomena.
And Copernicus allowed himself to
be carried away by the potency of the
solar symbol, stating that the sun
veritable light of the world was more
worthy than the earth to occupy the
centre of the universe. Thus he too
ended by referring to a divinified
concept of nature such as that which
had led the astronomy of antiquity
into a blind alley.
Yet Copernicus invoked the laws
of reason and not those of a divini¬
fied nature when building his magni¬
ficent theoretical construction, based
in part on original observation, but
mainly on already available data. In
Copernicus, faith in reason takes on
almost mystic overtones. He even
goes so far as to imagine a non¬
existent letter from a Pythagorean in
which truth is regarded as a religious
secret to be communicated only to the
privileged few.
Giordano Bruno in his writings,
forty years after De revolutionibus,
showed the fullest understanding of
the Copernican revolution. Coperni¬
cus had restored the dominion of
reason over the senses and opened
the path to the affirmation of the infi¬
nite and the freedom of thought of
modern man. In Aristotelian and
Ptolemaic astronomy Bruno saw a
codification of the universe based on
partial data supplied by that limited
tool of knowledge, the evidence of
the senses.
Reality grasped by thought and the
understanding is an infinite reality,
whereas that grasped by the senses
is always limited. Bruno brought out
the rationalist and platonist aspects
of Copernicus, the Copernicus who
could not accept thinking that was
"blown hither and thither", but who
based everything on reason, because
for him reason was the divine, the
absolute, the infinite. So bold was
this way of thinking that it had over¬
thrown a thousand-year-old scientific
tradition.
Thus Copernicus, the last fine
flower of the ancient era, was soon
to trigger off a new and historic phase
of human culture. Towards the end
of the 16th century the perennial dia¬
lectic of the finite and the infinite
saw the intuition of the infinite re-
emerge and win the day, thanks to
an astronomy which itself had not
yet dared to postulate the infinity
of the universe.

COPERNICUS, GALILEO, BRUNO (Continued)
The Copernican world, it should be
stressed, was a finite world; the
world was finite, but not reality, since
reality was thought and thought went
beyond all boundaries, all specific
ideas or systems. One of the heret¬
ical propositions that sent Bruno to
the stake on February 17, 1600, con¬
cerned the plurality of worlds. Do
many worlds exist? Or are there many
notions of worlds which might exist?
Perhaps Copernicus had little inkl¬
ing of the dramatic developments that
would result from the repudiation of
the long-established compromise bet¬
ween the senses and reason embodi¬
ed in the Ptolemaic scheme of the uni¬
verse. At the time there were no
immediate repercussions. But later,
in an Italy disturbed and stripped of
its preconceived ideas by the Renais¬
sance, the argument about the infinite
exploded, involving not only the macro¬
cosm but also the human microcosm.
Bruno read Copernicus in literal
and metaphorical terms, just as others,
in the past had read Aristotle and
Genesis. Some interpretations were
erroneous. A theory of the dissolv¬
ing of the solid heavenly spheres
was attributed to Copernicus which
appears, to say the least, doubtful
to anyone reading De revolutionibus
with care. But what was authentic
was the re-affirmation of the infinite
in man's reason and the intuition of
a new path towards the absolute and
towards necessity.
When he died for refusing to recant,
Bruno bore witness to the anguish
that the problem of reality creates
in the minds of men, to the enduring
value of the Socratic plea to question
all things, and to human civilization's
need for the toleration denied it by
Calvin's Geneva and the Rome of
the Inquisition.
Bruno had come to understand that
finite and infinite could become merg¬
ed in the individual. The individual
is finite and limited because he is
not other individuals; but he is infi¬
nite and unlimited because he is
unconditionally himself. The wonder¬
ful precision and clarity of the Coper¬
nican scheme of things were given
new depth and transmuted into this
new dimension of human conscious¬
ness individuality.
Galileo was destined to become
the finest example of this individu¬
ality. What shines out from each of
his pages is the workings of a mind
whose thoughts become precise enun¬
ciations of things, postulates, theo¬
rems, problems. Each time, the limi¬
tations of "the experiences of the
senses" is transcended by the infin¬
ity of reason and converted into the
individuality of affirmation. And this
is why Galileo has for us the intense
fascination of the completely modern
man, the man for all seasons and of
all places.
The Copernicus brought back to
life by Galileo in his Dialogue is the
defender of logical evidence against
authoritarianism, verbalism, and the
surrender of human responsibility.
He is a figure of not only intellectual
but also moral virtue, with a clarity of
mind which is also a kind of courage,
the courage which enabled the new
science to develop its own fertility in
face of "the over-cautious and jea¬
lous protagonists of the immutability
of the heavens."
In short, as seen by Galileo, Coper¬
nicus the rationalist appears as the
father and guarantor of Copernicus
the cosmologist. The astounding,
sensational astronomical revelation
had been preceded by a subjective,
internal revelation. Emerging from
EUREKA ( It Is through the famous 3rd century B.C. mathematician and
inventor, Archimedes of Syracuse, that we have learned about the helio¬
centric theory of the universe advanced at that time by Aristarchus of
Samos. In his book, "Arenarius", Archimedes describes some of the ideas
held by Aristarchus. Below, this 16th century engraving illustrates Archi¬
medes' famous bath-night discovery of the principle of the displacement
of water. Overjoyed by his discovery, Archimedes is said to have leaped
from the bath shouting "Eurekal" ("I have found it"). Near the bath are
gold and silver vessels and a crown used by Archimedes for his experiment
the mind of the canon of Frombork
(Copernicus), it was transmitted to the
Dominican of Ñola (Bruno) to appear
again refined and intensified in the
thinking of the mathematician of the
Medici court (Galileo).
Whilst the ancient world had trans¬
cended its metaphysical naturalism
with the creation by its greatest
thinkers of a theory of knowledge, the
modern era saw Copernicus, Bruno
and Galileo united in an effort to
establish a concept of existence that
would be open to the requirement of
infinity.
Individuality and the individual were
their goal individuality as the reco¬
gnizable origin of everything. Coper¬
nicus' recurrent fears about the conse¬
quences of his own theories, the
stake at which Bruno died, and the
trial of Galileo bear witness to the
liberating power of this revolution
born of man, projected into the hea¬
vens and then embodied in the theory
of existence itself.
Sterile scientific tradition, false
philosophical reasoning, and religious
idolatry may succeed in imposing
themselves by force, but they will
always be condemned by the judgment
of history and the example given by
"the innovators" to succeeding
generations.

TRUTH ON TRIAL. "Noble Copernicus, from my earliest youth your works captured my imagination", wrote the
Italian Renaissance scholar Giordano Bruno (left, in a 19th century drawing). Born in Nola (Italy) in 1548, Bruno studied,
taught and travelled In Italy, France, England and Germany. Challenging the conception of a finite universe, he postulated
its infinity, picturing it as a multitude of worlds (celestial bodies substantially similar to the Earth). Denounced to the Inqui¬
sition for heresy, he was condemned and burned at the stake in Rome, in 1600. No less imprudent for that time were the
ideas defended by the Italian astronomer and mathematician, Galileo (1564-1642). Upholding the Copernican system of the
universe, Galileo made observations with his famous telescope that proved the validity of Copernicus' theories. But
his assertions brought him Into conflict with the beliefs of the Church (still based on the views of Aristotle and Ptolemy).
He was brought before the Inquisition and at the end of a trial lasting 20 days he was forced to abjure his ideas. Below,
Galileo before his judges, a scene depicted by Robert-Fleury, a 19th century French painter.

The text below by the Director-General of
Unesco. René Maheu. has just appeared
in a limited edition monograph published
by the Polish National Commission for
Unesco, in co-operation with Unesco, on
the occasion of the ceremonies organized
in Paris on February 19, 1973. to mark the
500th anniversary of the birth of Copernicus.
The monograph, printed in 2,000 copies
on paper specially hand-made in Poland,
is not on sale. It contains the texts of the
addresses delivered at the Unesco-sponsored
ceremonies by René Maheu, Janusz
Groszkowski, Member of the Polish
Academy of Sciences, Olaf Pedersen,
Member of the International Union of the
History and Philosophy of Science, and
by Umberto Forth science historian.

32
IISTORY affords few examples of scientific
discoveries that have had such profound reper¬
cussions on the spiritual development of mankind
as that of the great Polish astronomer Nicholas
Copernicus. Unlike later discoveries, such as those
of Ampère or Faraday, the replacement of the Ptole¬
maic model of the solar system by the Copernican
conception did not lead to any technological inno¬
vations. It did, however, bring about a veritable
intellectual revolution, which had a profound and
far-reaching effect upon man's conception of his
place in the universe and hence of the human condi¬
tion itself.
Man now realized that he was living on a planet
which was spinning through the immensity of a
universe whose dimensions were beyond his ima¬
gining; but at the same time he became convinced
that human thought was capable of grasping the
laws which govern that universe and of predicting
the motions of the heavenly bodies. Before he could
arrive at such a conviction, however, he had to
discard many preconceived ideas which had hardly
changed since the days of Aristotle, and to cease
regarding himself as the centre of the universe.
This liberating experience opened the way for
other discoveries which have gradually shaped our
present view of man's place and purpose in nature,
for it is through the realization of his own physical
insignificance in relation to the universe around him
that man has come to appreciate his true greatness,
which is spiritual.
Astronomers today have at their disposal instru¬
ments that are infinitely more powerful and accurate
than the simple armillary sphere and astrolabe with
which Copernicus and his contemporaries worked.
Giant radio-telescopes and spacecraft supply them
with information about phenomena previously beyond
their ken; but in the last analysis creative imagination,
stimulated by insatiable curiosity, remains the deci¬
sive factor In intellectual progress.
Thus, despite the five hundred years that separate
us from him, the force of his genius still keeps
Nicholas Copernicus close to us. In paying tribute
to him, we reaffirm our faith in man and In man's
constantly renewed ability to master, by the sheer
power of rational thought, a universe whose outlines
forever elude him and whose scale and complexity
offer an unending challenge to human intelligence.

Letters to the Editor
THE ORIGINS OF MAN
300-PERSON PROTEST
OTHER VIEWS
Sir,
I am not a professional anthropologist,
but I would like to reply to Dr. J. Hilde-
shelmer's letter in your January 1973
issue. Writing on behalf of over 300
other persons, she complains that your
issue, "The Emergence of Man" (August-
September 1972), neglects the question
of man's spiritual origins.
I see no reason for the protest since
the presentation of non-scientific theo¬
ries was outside the scope of the
issue. Dr. Hildesheimer writes that
man has questioned himself about his
origins during thousands of years, and
has come up with a wide range of
answers. Man has asked himself many
other questions about the solar sys¬
tem for example and these resulted
in many replies too. Yet most of them
are now only of historical interest, and
it is the Copernican answer that has
remained as a true account of reality.
I am against the practice of referring
to the views of prominent scientists in
fields other than their own in support
of a particular point of view. Einstein's
views on the origins of man are of
great interest as the opinions of a
great man, but they can hardly be
considered as a contribution to palaeon¬
tology.
Although I am not against the religious
attitude expressed in the letter, I do
deplore the situation in which an ideo¬
logy blinds critical judgement. I count
many believers among my friends, but
our differences of view do not affect
our friendship, perhaps because we rea¬
lize that acceptance or rejection of the
existence of a "higher wisdom" is not
subject to evident proof, but is a matter
of convictions and inner needs.
Dr. Ludwik Czaja
Warsaw, Poland
Sir,
Dr. J. Hildesheimer and 311 co-signa¬
tories protest against the fact that your
issue on the emergence of Man dealt
with the question solely from the biolo¬
gical and evolutionist point of view,
and that no mention was made of the
concept of a creation directed by higher
powers. "In the records of great reli¬
gions and nations", says the letter,
"as well as in modern spiritual research,
may be found a host of references to
and proofs for the physical-soulful-
spiritual origin of mankind."
Unesco, however, is one of the few
organizations that is truly universal in
character, but this universality, can only
be maintained if Unesco deliberately
refrains from adopting a particular stand
on religious or ideological matters.
Unesco's objective is to bring the
peoples of the world closer together
through the common study of the phe¬
nomena and laws of nature and of
human relations, and to seek a general,
world-wide philosophy without identi¬
fying itself with or making judgements
about the beliefs and teachings of the
world's many religions and ideologies.
This is an essential condition of the
universality of Unesco and of the ser¬
vices it provides and can provide. The
fact that the issue of the "Unesco
Courier" criticized by your correspon¬
dents abstains from raising the problem
of man's divine inspiration is in accor¬
dance with this principle and should
be taken as a mark of deference to the
world's religions.

UNDERWATER VANDALS
Sir,
I am preparing a book on under¬
water archaeology, with emphasis on
damage done by treasure-hunters who
loot wrecks. If any readers can fur¬
nish information on this I should be
grateful to receive it. I'm particularly inte¬
rested in hearing about Latin America
and the Pacific, for which little infor¬
mation seems available at present.
However, information from any area is
more than welcome.

VANISHING CULTURES
Sir,
One problem that worries me is the
fate of the world's primitive cultures,
in particular Indians of the Amazon.
International campaigns have been
launched to safeguard animals threa¬
tened with extinction. Surely it is more
important to save human beings and
their cultures from being wiped out.
Cannot Unesco co-ordinate the so far
dispersed and fragmentary efforts that
have been made to protect the world's
primitive cultures?

STOCKHOLM FOLLOW-UP
Sir,
Congratulations on your excellent
issue on man and the environment
(January 1973). Although human sett¬
lements were one of the themes of
the agenda paper, they were little dis¬
cussed at The U.N. Conference on the
Human Environment, in Stockholm.
Unesco should not propagate the
image of environmental concern as
concentrated on the disappearing spe¬
cies of animals and wilderness forests.
"The human environment" encom¬
passes the urban slums, the favellas,
barrios, freetowns, Wildsiedlungen on
every continent. The United Nations
has accepted the invitation of the
Government of Canada to convene an
exhibition-conference in Vancouver, in
September, 1975, to concentrate on
the issues neglected at Stockholm.
The Secretary-General of the Stock¬
holm Conference, Mr. Maurice Strong,
adduced a statistic that is frightening.
Of the pollution in the oceans, one
quarter derives from oil spills, dis¬
charges from vessels, the effluent of
polluted rivers. But three-quarters
begins as the exhaust from automo¬
biles, mostly in cities, carried into the
clouds and dropped in the oceans in
rain.
It is for this reason that the Inter¬
national Union of Local Authorities,
which has long enjoyed fruitful rela¬
tions with Unesco, convened a meeting
of municipal officials in Vienna in
November, 1972: "After Stockholm
What?".

RECIPE FOR HEALTHY SOIL
Sir,
I was astonished by Mr. Metrallet's
letter in praise of organic farming
published in the your October 1972
issue. This matter deserves to be
examined more seriously; the systema¬
tic opposition of chemical and organic
farming methods simply does not con¬
form to the facts since everyone knows
that soil must be treated with both
minerals and humus if its fertility is
to be maintained.
It is intellectually dishonest to speak
of record crops achieved by the use
of vegetable compost alone, without
making it clear that such composts
are derived from vast quantities of
vegetable matter gathered from forests,
dunes and fallow land, involving a
great deal of labour and resulting in¬
evitably in the impoverishment of the
land from which it was taken.
Mr. Metrallet sings the merits of
"food obtained from a balanced soil".
But who wants the soil to be unba¬
lanced? Everyone knows that most
soils, naturally or as the result of pro¬
longed agricultural use, are impoverish¬
ed and unbalanced. Compost alone
cannot replace the elements extracted
by the growth of crops and whose
absence gives lower yield and quality.

MODELLED
ON NATURE 7
Sir,
I was particularly struck by the pho¬
tograph at the bottom of page 19 in
your February 1973 issue, illustrating
the article on the ancient Thracians
in Bulgaria. The photo showed a
decorated libation bowl originating from
Lampsakos on the coast of the Sea
of Marmara (photo left).
There seems to me to be little doubt
that the craftsman who made this bowl
drew his inspiration from fossilized
Echmida (sea-urchins) such as are also
found in Bulgaria. I am thinking par¬
ticularly of the Porosoma (photo right)
or Phymotaxis varieties, though many
others, very similar in appearance,
have been found in outcrops of ter- S
tiary and cretaceous rock. a

in Geneva in 1952) literary, scientific and
artistic works are protected for at least
25 years and signatory countries undertake
to extend to foreign writers the protection
they give to their own nationals. The
convention was revised in Paris in 1971 to
give developing countries easier access to
books written and published in the
industrially developed countries. The revis¬
ed convention will enter into force when
ratified by 12 countries. So far six have
done so. (See article "New copyright revi¬
sion means more books for the Third
World" by Georges Ravelonanosy, "Unesco
Courier", July 1972.)
Unesco education centre
opens in Beirut
A Unesco Regional Office for Education
in the Arab States has been opened in
Beirut under an agreement between
Unesco and Lebanon. The Beirut centre
Unesco's fourth regional office of this
kind will help Arab countries to improve
and expand their educational systems.
Other offices are situated in Dakar (to
serve Africa), in Bangkok (for Asia) and
in Santiago de Chile (for Latin America).
Museums on the move
A wide sampling of ways in which go-
ahead museums reach the public and
"educate" in the widest sense is given
in "Museums, Imagination and Education",
just published by Unesco (148 pp., $6,
£2). Using mobile exhibitions museums
are now on the move. Some examples :
Nigeria's travelling museum, set up with
Unesco aid, teaches modern farming tech¬
niques in the countryside ; Moscow's Poly-
technique Museum explains science and
technology through some 20 exhibitions a
year, including a river boat that has visited
towns along the Volga. Youth participation
is promoted by centres such as the Bal
Dhavan, in New Dehli, and the "Muse",
a children's centre in Brooklyn, New York,
which organizes workshops in poetry, pain¬
ting, thea.tre, music and dancing.
Montaigne Prize
for René Maheu
The 1973 Montaigne Prize was recently
presented, at a ceremony in Paris, to
Unesco's Director-General, Mr. René
Maheu. The prize is awarded annually by
the F.V.S. Foundation of Hamburg (German
Fed. Rep.) to "recognize the role of eminent
representatives of European countries of
Romance languages in the maintenance of
the spiritual values of Europe and its open¬
ing to the world". Mr. Maheu was honour¬
ed for presiding over "the destiny of an
institution devoted to co-operation between
peoples" and as an outstanding philoso¬
pher, humanist and European.
International aid
to save Carthage-
Several countries are sending archaeo¬
logical teams to Carthage in response to
the international appeal launched last year
by Unesco's Director-General, Mr. René
Maheu, for universities, scientific instit¬
utions and foundations to take part in the
campaign to explore and protect the site.
(See also "Unesco Courier", December
1970 "Carthage Must Not be Destroyed".)
Polish archaeologists have been at work
on the site since last year, and teams from
Bulgaria, France, Italy and Britain, among
other countries, are to join them. Donations
for the campaign can be sent directly to
the Special Fund for Carthage, Unesco,
Place de Fontenoy, Paris-7e.
...and deadline for saving
Borobudur
About $1.5 million must be raised by
the end of June, 1973, if the 8th century
Buddhist temples of Borobudur (Indonesia)
are to be saved, declared Unesco's Direc¬
tor-General Mr. René Maheu in a recent
urgent appeal. The cost of preserving the
temples is estimated at $7,750,000. The
Indonesian Government is to provide
$2,750,000, and will start the work of rest¬
oration if $3,000,000 of the balance is
pledged by Unesco Member States by
June 30. Contributions thus far total about
$1,500,000.
World guide
to malaria hazards
The World Health Organization has just
published the first comprehensive world
guide to malaria hazards. From it, a doc¬
tor or traveller can learn just where mala¬
ria exists in any country on a proposed
itinerary. Among other facts, the guide
indicates the times of the year when the
traveller is at risk from malaria and the
altitude levels below which the risk exists,
and pinpoints urban areas where the tou¬
rist can spend a night without the threat
of getting malaria. Each year several
thousand persons become ill from malaria
after travelling abroad, and the disease is
responsible for a small but increasing
number of avoidable deaths among jet age
tourists and businessmen.
Flashes
M Countries providing development assis¬
tance spent 25 times more money on arms
than on aid during 1970, according to a
U.N. study.
Postage stamps issued by Monaco to
help save Venice have raised $10,000 for
the Unesco-sponsored international cam¬
paign.
Kiev, capital of the Ukraine, has opened
a museum dedicated to books and the his¬
tory of printing.
A new way to deal with lake pollution
has been found in Sweden where special¬
ists are pumping compressed air Into a
heavily-polluted lake near Stockholm to
revitalize and cleanse its waters.
