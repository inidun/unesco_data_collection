TRADING BLOWS TO MUSIC

One of the most entertaining spectacles to be seen in Brazil ¡s the
capoeira in which two men engage in a strange bout to the rhythm of
music. These performances, greatly beloved by the people of the
Northeast, are usually staged as a Sunday distraction. The music is
played by three men on instruments called berlmbau long, musical
bows fitted at one end with a calabash which acts as a sound-box (left).
Sometimes the musician playing this primitive harp holds in his other
hand a wicker rattle which he shakes each time he plucks at his instru¬
ment, while the spectators sing. The contestants crouch for a moment
or two before the orchestra as if to collect themselves and prepare for
the bout. Then they go for one another, lashing out blows and throw¬
ing themselves on the ground, and go through the motions of a violent
struggle in which every action in reality is feigned and carefully timed
to the rhythm of the music. Sometimes the "fighters" break off the
contest and do a march in dance time or a series of acrobatic feats.

(Ç) Pierre Verger 19 57
No era in history perhaps has ever afforded more
extreme contrasts than our own. Side by side with
the modern towns now springing up throughout the
immense continent of Africa, for example, the traditional
Africa, little different from the one our grandparents pic¬
tured a century ago, continues to exist. Both live almost
side by side and are different facets of the same reality
of today.
In no way is Negro Africa's modernization more strik¬
ingly revealed than by the swift growth of an élite
amongst women. These women are taking their place
alongside a male élite, each year more numerous and
more active. It is particularly in West Africa that the
status of African women has changed most profoundly.
On the Gold Coast, for example, women are today to be
found in a great variety of professions. Considering that
education 'for African women is such a recent thing, it is
all the more remarkable to see them holding important
positions as judges, lawyers, journalists and in the Civil
Service.
The entry of women into so many new professions now
has sociologists wondering what the consequences will
ultimately be. In our society there are certain jobs which
have now come to be associated with women rather than
men (secretarial posts are an example).
In West Africa today some of these roles are being
reversed. Up until now at any rate, men, not women,
have been secretaries and typists, the girls apparently
finding the door to these careers closed to them. On the
other hand, they have found no difficulty in becoming
printers or journalists, and even monopolize certain fields
of medicine.
Of course the women of Africa have not waited to be
"educated" in order to play a role in society. They have
always been extremely influential, and in some regions
enjoyed the greatest independence. In West Africa,
married women have been traders in their own right for
many centuries, and have disposed of their earnings as
they pleased.
The present industrialization of Africa has been an
opportunity for some enterprising women even though
illiterateto go into business on a big scale. Thus, in
Nigeria there are business women who run chains of
shops and are rich enough to build modern homes and to
send their children to England or the United States. Some
cities have a growing "smart set" of elegant women who
set the fashion.
But behind this new A'frica there is still the old one
with its polygamous families, its minor rulers and its sor¬
cerers. Between the two Áfricas there is no hostility. The
women who have grown up according to the traditional
customs point to the girl "intellectuals" and say: "Now
our daughters are showing us the way."

A WOMAN'S LIFE

frétillions of women in France's African territories
" ~ * went to the polls for the first time last year, thus
marking another important step forward in the progress
of women's rights. On November 18, 1956, nearly half
a century afterthe first women in Europe won the suffrage,
millions of those in Africa reached the same milestone on
the road to emancipation. Yet African women in these
territories are not newcomers to politics. Widows and
mothers of not less than two children have had the vote
for the past ten years. They made up about one-third of
the electorate at the previous elections in January 1956.
Then, on June 23, 1956, without any protest marches,
suffragettes in action or serious political discussions
disturbing the peace of African homes, the right to vote
was extended to all women in these African territories on
exactly the same basis as for women in France. This
right became a reality on November 18 when the women
cast their votes in elections for the municipal councils of
African communes, to which they themselves are
eligible for election.
It is still too early to analyse the results and to comment
57
on the response the women made to their first chance
of voting. One thing we do know is that the vast
majority were villagers and that most were illiterate.
Candidates met this problem by identifying their parties
with a colour or a picture. One party used an emblem;
another outlined its programme in picture words; people
voted "palm tree" or "elephant."
Even in a country like Dahomey where French has been
taught for many yearsthe first schools were opened by
missionaries as long ago as 1861there are still very few
educated women. In today's schools boys still far out¬
number the girls. Women, therefore, are the guardians of
traditions and cling, in far greater numbers than men,
to ancestral rites and customs. Only a small proportion
of women voters live in modern towns, lead the life of a
modern woman or experience her problems. What is
she like then, this African woman of tradition who is
typical of the vast majority? How does she live? The
author of the following article, who spent two years
among the women of Dahomey and came to know them
well, has attempted to answer these questions.

The Unesco Courier. March 1957
Until that warm January morning when I arrived
there, Dahomey to me was only a narrow pink
or mauve strip squeezed in between Nigeria and
Togoland on the patchwork that West Africa
makes on the map. Now I know it as a landscape of
alternate greens and reds, of green palm trees and fields
contrasting with the red tracks and mud villages through
which I drove from the coast to join my husband who was
on a two-year sociological mission for Unesco.
I expected a jungle; I found a garden. South
Dahomey is a vast palm grove shielding long, straight
rows of maize, bean, peanut and manioc fields.
"Dahomey", my travelling companion said to me, "has
something of Asia about it. Its population is as cramped
as in some of the delta regions of India." Then he added,
"Did you know that three to four hundred people are
crowded together into one square kilometre in some parts
of the country?"
I expressed surprise and asked, "How do they manage
to five?"
The answer came forth with a chuckle, "Everything
here runs on oil, palm oil. Dahomey's great wealth is its
palm trees. When the year is good there's prosperity: the
men buy bicycles, get married, have big ceremonies for the
dead; the women get new skirts and new jewellery. When
the year is bad, no tax money comes in and then there's
trouble. Everyone is tied to the palm grove: the men are
the owners, do the planting and transporting; the women
make the oil and sell it. The future of Dahomey depends
almost entirely on its palm trees. As soon as new trees
are planted in the bush up spring the country's only
factories its oil works."
Jeweller's window in
a Garden of Eden
And so I reached my new home. It was just over
30 miles from the coast, a little outside a village on
the edge of a plateau overlooking the immense
delta of the Ouémé, the great river .that cuts across Daho¬
mey from north to south for several hundred miles. On
one side was the palm grove, on the other, at the foot of
the cliff, six miles of swamp through which the river twists
and winds. During half the year it overflows its banks so
that the houses have to be built on stilts.
The house stood inside a circle of trees palm trees,
banana trees and papaw trees. There was even a
pineapple patch. And then I realized where I really was
in the middle of the Garden of Eden, exactly as I had
seen it depicted in so many old prints. "Nothing is
missing", said my husband pointing to a ditch. There,
lined up in a row, I saw 32 snakes' heads, a glitter of
green, yellow and black, like in a jeweller's window.
They had been killed the day before by the men clearing
underbrush around the house.
It was at Mitro, the nearest village, that I began my
career as an ethnologist's wife. Mitro lies at the foot of
the cliff bordering the marsh, and is reached by a red
earth track. African villages are often so well hidden
that it takes a stranger a long time to find
them. Mitro is at the junction of two I
tracks, one leading down to the swamp, the I
other skirting it. They link together all the I next°n
villages located at the foot of the hill, j

A wife's household in Dahomey:
husband plus 20, 30 or 40 in-laws
Where the tracks meet, the market place is set up.
The thousand or so inhabitants of Mitro live hidden
away behind the thick screen of banana and palm trees,
coco-nut palms and silk-cotton trees that line all the paths.
There is nothing to guide the stranger except the rhythmic
tappings that can be heard through the greenery the
tapping of drums, gongs, bells, rattles and sometimes even
of pieces of broken pottery. The presence of a house is
revealed, not by a curl of smoke, hardly even by a path,
but by the noise of rhythmic tapping. The impact of
Africa is on the ears rather than the eyes.
Special veneration
for mothers of twins
My first visit to the village was paid to the wife of the
schoolteacher who had once been a teacher herself.
She spoke excellent French with just a slight
trace of what might easily pass for a southern French
accent. She wore a Dahoman dress a full, flowered
cotton skirt tied under the bosom, and a broad-sleeved,
round-necked jacket. Her hair was done up in little tight
coils drawn back over the nape of the neck with a thread.
She was an important figure at Mitro. In Dahomey,
the teacher and his wife command a good deal of respect,
exactly the same as they do in France. But there was
something even more important than that about her. The
year before she had given birth to twins, and in Dahomey
twins are an object of special veneration. Here, Madame
Dionne would have received the honours paid to a king!
"First, we must go and see the chief of the village", she
said to me. A few minutes' walk brought us to the mud
wall encircling the houses where the headman's family
lived. Nearly all families live in enclosures shut off from
prying eyes not only by the bush but also by a circle of
thick walls. This is the home of the ten, twenty, thirty
or more persons who make up a big African family. It
is called in Dahomey the houeta, but Europeans call it
simply the tata.
Discreetly informed of our arrival, Akadjamé, the
headman, was waiting for us. He sat in front of his mud
house surrounded by the village notables. They all rose
as we arrived and the headman welcomed us with the
traditional bowl of water. After making his introductions
the headman took me over his home. There were
separate houses for his six wives, and others for his mother,
his old uncle, his aunt and his brothers. They were all
built in the same style fed mud cabins roofed with dried
palm branches, clustered together in groups of three or
four and connected by paths where goats were frisking
about. A little to one side I noticed a building on stilts
the family store-house.
"There was a time", Akadjamé said, "when the fields
and palm groves were common property and all members
of the family tilled the earth together. Every day or
second day the head of the tata distributed to the women
the maize and yams needed by each household. But now
the men want to divide up the land as soon as their parents
have died. Nobody works together any more and if you
need help you've got to pay your neighbours and even your
friends. If the men have no more land or not enough
money to support their family they leave the village and
look for work at Cotonou and Porto-Novo. The country
is changing", the chief concluded rather heavily.
Sé Kandé, one of the headman's wives, no doubt sensed
my curiosity for she invited me into her house. It
consisted of a big room divided into two by a mud
partition. One side was the bedroom, furnished with a
bamboo bed which Sé Kandé shared with her two children,
and a wooden chest containing her clothes. The other
half of the room was a smoke-blackened kitchen, the
lower half of its walls painted with white kaolin. The
floor was strewn with dried cow-dung trampled down to
form a smooth, hard surface. A stew was simmering on
a hearth formed of four up-turned pots.
My greetings in Gun
raised a laugh
At the end of our visit, Akadjamé saw us to the gate
where a pile of corrugated zinc gleamed in the sun¬
light. "I am getting my roof redone", he remarked
in a feigned casual tone. I nodded gravely. Next to a
bicycle, a zinc roof is one of the most coveted signs of
wealth in Dahoman villages. It stands up to hurricanes
and, above all, puts an end to the irksome task of

repairing the thatch periodically. But
a zinc roof costs a small fortune and
only the well-to-do can afford one.
By now we were surrounded by the
villagers. They came from everywhere.
The schoolteacher's wife answered
their eager questions. No, I wasn't
the wife of the administrative officer.
I asked her to tell them that I would
like to visit the womenfolk. I read
their invitations in the expressions of
mingled amusement and surprise on
their faces which seemed to say, "Now
that's strange: we'll see if she really
comes. ':
After a few weeks I began to know
Mitro fairly well and greeted the
people in Gun, the local language,
which never failed to provoke mirth
and amazement. At first the women
regarded me with some suspicion.
But before long the village grew used
to my curiosity. After two or three
months some of the women were
openly jealous because I hadn't visited
them more often or because I had not
yet returned their call.
My days were usually spent with
three women: Bosi, a young Protes¬
tant, Vidéhou, the old fetish woman
and Henriette, who was soon to be
married. But it was Tavi, a follower
of the thunder cult, and a staunch
defender of tradition, who initiated me
into the joys of African family life.
Tavi was well known in the village
since she had had twins. Unfortu¬
nately one of them had died.
Tavi turned up at the market one
morning wearing a claret-coloured
skirt hemmed with cowries, the shells
which used to be brought by ship from
the Indian Ocean and were long used
as money in Africa. "This is the
special dress for mothers of twins and
for twin children", she explained.
"Women wear it on the days they go
to market to buy the food to be offered to the twin deities."
Curious to see what happened, I couldn't resist following
her home. She laid out a little food in front of a wooden
doll which she then washed and put to bed on a stool.
"This is my child who has gone to fetch wood", she said
(for you never say that a twin is dead). "I look after
(g Pierre Verger 19 57
SHELL-MONEY made from cowries was the most usual form of currency in Western Africa until
the middle of the 19th century. Particularly abundant in the Indian Ocean, cowrie shells were
first brought by traders to West Africa where they were fastened together in long strings of 40
or 50. Today, women of Dahomey use them for decorating head-dresses (above). A claret-coloured
skirt hemmed with cowries is a distinctive dress worn only by mothers of twins and the twin chil¬
dren. To be the mother of twins is considered a special honour in Dahomey, ensuring great respect.
him in the same way as I do his brother Maca, and when
Maca grows up he will look after him himself."
That is how I came to know Tavi's family. Like all
the women in the village, she came to live here after her
marriage. Seated in the courtyard, she pointed out her
husband's house, then her brother-in-law's, the two houses
of her mothers-in-law (those of the wives of her husband's
father), then the houses of two uncles, a widowed aunt
who had come back home to live with the family, and
finally, four brothers-in-law and their wives. I added them
all up; there were at least sixteen persons she couldn't
afford not to get along well with. ..not counting her hus¬
band's first wife.
I began to understand the meaning of the saying,
"Marriage is a family affair" and the wealth of diplomacy
that tradition sometimes attributes to African women.
Later, at Abomay, I even met a family in which the wives,
tired of the quarrels between their hus¬
bands, brothers-in-law, fathers-in-law and
uncles-in-law, had formed a small drum
orchestra to show the men that it was not
so difficult to get on together. To follow

WOMAN'S
LIFE
(Continued)
A hair-do that spelled a quarrel:
curls swept over the forehead
one's husband is nothing, but to marry a whole family of
in-laws that is a real art.
Tavi, like any new wife in a Dahoman family, was in a
way the "Cinderella" of the household. She it was her
father-in-law called on to draw the water, she it was her
mother-in-law asked to grind the pepper for dinner.
Whenever I visited her, I would find her either sweeping
her aunt's house or returning from an errand for her uncle
or another relation. So Tavi will certainly not object when
her husband takes a third wife since all the work to be
done for the in-laws will be passed on to the newcomer.
Now I understand why the women of Dahomey go to such
lengths to introduce their best friends to their husbands
"with a view to marriage".
Polygamy on the grand scale, however, is rare at Mitro.
Seventy-five per cent of the marriages are monogamous,
and in thirty-two out of forty-three polygamous ones, there
are only two wives. The headman alone, who is the
biggest landowner at Mitro, has six.
Bosi, the young Protestant, was her husband's only wife,
but she didn't find the work in the tata too trying. Unlike
most Mitro women, she would not have liked her husband
to take other wives even if it had meant their taking over
part of the household chores. "Women are jealous
creatures", she said to me, "and you seldom find two
wives of the same husband getting on well together." As
if to confirm what she had just said, a quarrel broke out
in the house next door. A woman began to sing:
A bird has fine feathers,
Feathers made for the bird.
A beast has but its hide,
And never can it wear the feathers made for the bird.
"That's the wife of my husband's younger brother", said
Bosi with a smile. "She's having a quarrel with her
husband's other wife." The other wife was sitting in front
of her house crushing palm nuts; without even raising
her head she immediately started to sing her reply :
She's got a big belly,
Big as a boat with too much cargo aboard,
Shoulders like bicycle handlebars,
And she has the nerve to insult me.
"You can say anything you like with a song", said Bosi.
She also explained to me that women once went in for a
"quarrel" hair-style known as "turn your back on the
other wife". It was the ordinary hair-do in curls, but the
curls were brought over the forehead instead of the neck!
In the United States you can buy postcards for all
likely and unlikely occasions, even the teething of a
red-haired baby. In Dahomey, they "say it with a song"
-and have a repertoire of allusive songs and couplets to fit
every event. In one, the family of a young man who has
just been married jeers at the parents of an unsuccessful
rival; another mocks a shy fiancée; and there is a song for
the reconciliation of two feuding families. This does not
mean that in Dahomey everything ends in a song. At
Porto-Novo songs once led to such violent incidents
between one quarter and another that they were prohibited.
Going back to father =
going home to mother
Bosi went on to tell me that she thought her sister-in-
law would go back to her father the African variant
of our, "it's all over between us and I'm going back
to Mother".
Although true polygamy is dying out, it is giving way to
what the Africans, with a wink, describe as successive
polygamy, which was much frowned on in the past.

DOUBLE -AXED
THUNDER GOD
Woman of Dahomey marching in
religious procession carries the dou¬
ble axe-head emblem of the Nige¬
rian god of thunder, Shango (3).
Emblem is mounted on head of
wooden statuette depicting a
woman leaning on heads of two
kneeling servants. Double axe-head,
anancient religious symbol of the
the thunder god, is also found in the
Minoan civilization of Crete and
Asia Minor. Greek god Zeus is
often represented with same double
axe-head. In traditional Dahomey
dance, gaily clad woman (I) bows to
partner (unseen in photo). Many
popular modern dances of West
Indies are partly derived from tribal
dances of Dahomey and Nigeria.
Dancers are watched by grave-faced
teen-age girls (2). In Dahomey,
girls usually marry at 1 6 or 17.
Bosi's husband had had three wives, and though it was
Bosi's first marriage, her friend, Tavi, had had two
husbands. Vidéhou, the old fetish woman, seemed to me
to be the champion of divorce; she was living with her
seventh husband. Husbands seldom repudiate their
wives. Usually it is the wife who leaves her husband. "He
didn't give me any children", one of the women told me.
Another complained that her husband didn't give her
enough to eat, and Tavi confided to me that her husband
spoke slightingly of her family.
Divorce is not a long-drawn-out process. The wife
goes back to her father's house until she remarries, which
usually does not take long. The new husband may be said
to pay for the divorce since he refunds to the first husband
the dowry he had originally provided.
"When I was young", an old woman said to me in a
those-were-the-good-old-days tone, "it was the family
that picked the husband and there were fewer divorces than
now." Today a girl marries at 16 or 17 and chooses the
husband she likes.
,<? Pierre Verger 19 57
In the past, Europeans who often did not hesitate to
criticize and denigrate African society, picked on one
shortcoming which seemed undeniable. African families
married off young people without their consent and often
against their will. They pointed to many cases of girls
promised in marriage from early childhood, or of widows
forced to marry one of the brothers of their deceased
husbands. Viewed in the light of European morals and
manners, the reproach was justified, but it was directed at
one of the bases of African family life, where women are
'the means for creating or renewing firm family alliances.
An agreement between families was regarded in the light
of African wisdom as far more important than transient
charms or a passing infatuation. The effect of this, there¬
fore, was that family considerations overruled all else.
For the women themselves, the para¬
mount aim of marriage was and still is
to have children. The Mitro women have
an average of four children, of which only
two usually survive. 1 met one old woman

WOMAN'S
LIFE
(Continued)
Hubby brings the bride her dowry;
it takes him six months to earn it
who was the mother of twelve. Childless women divorce
their husbands. Vidéhou, who had had seven husbands,
explained: "They didn't give me any children, so I left
them. Now I have a son." For a woman will always
blame her husband if she is childless. "A woman can
always have children", asserted one old woman, and the
opinion of elders is always treated with respect in Africa,
where old age and wisdom are practically synonymous.
It would however be quite wrong to imagine that the
feelings of the young people had no outlet. Bosi told me
tales of unhappy marriages and sensational abductions.
Of the hundred or so songs I collected only one is about
a lover's feelings in which the admirer avows his passion:
/ shall walk beside you
To see what you will say.
I shall walk beside you
To see what your father will say.
I shall take your pitcher of water
And place it on your head;
When lifting your pitcher of water
My hand will touch you.
A recent law that appeared to affect only a private
sphere of life was to shake traditional African society to
its very core. This was the Mandel Law of June 1939,
giving the African girl the right to refuse a husband she
did not wish to marry. Not only did it bring about the
rupture of old alliances between families in many different
walks of life; it also gave women an effective means of
resisting their parents' wishes. Aged fathers were hauled
one after another before the authorities by their children.
Cupid now had poisoned darts for those who crossed him.
The marriage system was changing, but the old forms
and procedures subsisted in their entirety.
Lovers clasp hands
¿-"i but never kiss
When Henriette and Paul found that they were in
love, Paul announced the news to his family.
Uncles and aunts of the young man went off one
morning to visit Henriette's family. A thousand and one
subjects were touched on news of the two families, the
state of the crops, the weather omens. A few allusions
were thrown out to a possible marriage. Henriette's
family had no objection and returned the visit a few days
later. Paul's uncles and aunts then came back with the
first presents, which make up the "little dowry" a few
bottles of gin, apéritifs and a little money to express their
gratitude to Henriette's family for giving its assent. The
figure of the "big dowry" was fought out by both parties
stubbornly but with imperturbable dignity. From that day
on, the young people were considered to be engaged; in
other words Paul was authorized to pay court to Henriette.
Courtship is always discreet and chaste. When Paul
wanted to give Henriette a little money for her to buy
something she wanted, he would never hand it to her
directly, but would slip it under a mat though he would

Lovers in Africa clasp hands and engirdle each other's
waists, but they never kiss. The old fashioned type of
African never kisses on the mouth, and the big love scenes

among the audience. Movie manners may be gradually
invading the town but have not yet reached the country.

£*7 a dressy occasion
Paul and Henriette's engagement lasted over a year
for they could not marry until Paul had got together
enough money for the "big dowry". It amounted to
quite a sum. At Mitro, where a farmer's average income
seldom comes to more than 3,000 francs a month, as much
as 15 to 20,000 francs is paid out as dowry in the form
of money, bottles of rum, gin, apéritifs, skirts, jewellery
and cooking utensils.
Quite apart from the question of the dowry, the period
of betrothal is very expensive. The fiancé is expected to
give presents on all occasions, and they are at least as
frequent as in France. Presents do not yet have to be
given for birthdays, namedays, Christmas and the New
Year, but there are ceremonies in honour of the dead or
the birth of a child in the fiancee's family (as African
families run to hundreds and even thousands of members,
births and deaths are pretty frequent occurrences),
ceremonies in honour of ancestors and vodun rites. On
all these occasions Paul had to remember not only his
fiancée but also, and more especially, his future in-laws.
Paul and Henriette were married while I was at Mitro.
He first let his fiancee's family know that the dowry was
ready. That evening the womenfolk of the family
conducted Henriette to Paul's tata. All present were
dressed up in their Sunday best. The richest women wore
skirts of satin brocade, nylon, broderie anglaise or velvet.
Paul, as a good host, saw that everyone had something to
drink, and when a drummer beat out a compliment, a sing¬
er sang his praises or a dancer performed some specially
brilliant feat, he rewarded the artist by sticking bank notes
on his forehead.
For ten or so days after the wedding I found Henriette
dressed in her best clothes, continuing to receive
congratulatory visits. When I called on her she set
before me, in accordance with Dahomey good manners, a
simple flower-patterned bowl with a lid, containing bananas
and a packet of cigarettes. People never forget to thank
their visitors for coming and present them with something
commensurate with the visitor's importance and the host's
means. Is this due to a desire not to be outdone, or not
to remain indebted to one's friends?
Some days later, Henriette came wearing her best
clothes to return my visit, and I thanked her with a gift of
money. Etiquette demands that the affection or esteem
that one has for persons be shown by the extent to which
one dresses up when visiting them. Whether the visit is
to a close friend or an important personage, formal dress
is always de rigueur. When we pay a visit to a close
friend, however, we are more likely to dress informally.

THE VILLA OF
A ROMAN
HERCULES
by Lucio and Giuseppe
Attinelli
Soaring skywards like some Gothic cathedral, the small
village of Piazza Armerina crowns a hilltop in the inter¬
ior of Sicily. Clustered around the summit, the houses
seem to cling to the steep slopes like gnarled carob-trees
whose long, tenacious roots reach deeply into the soil. Here,
paradoxically, the green vegetation seems to harmonize with
the almost unbearable brilliance of a scorching sun. There
is not a breath of wind and the air, vibrating in the intense
heat, gives the little place an aspect of unreality.
In this setting, like a desert mirage, a magnificent Roman
villa has awoken from a long sleep and has stretched itself
in the sun like some fabled Sleeping Beauty. As it has been
freed from the earth accumulated through the centuries, little
by little new details of its construction have became apparent
and, though the main building has been completely revealed,
the annexes have yet to be uncovered.
Before the villa was discovered, placid cows wandered here
and ruminated to the sound of the carefree shepherd's flute,
while, only a few feet beneath the ground on which they
grazed, lay a wealth of treasures.
Archaeologists in charge of the excavations say that the
still-uncovered buildings are spread over a very wide area, as
well they may be, judging by other great houses like the villa
of Tiberius at Capri and the huge Villa of the Papyrus at
Herculaneum, the city which was destroyed by the eruption of
Vesuvius in 79 A.D.
The buildings at Piazza Armerina follow the natural curve

VILLA

villa is matched by the
of the hill and spread out in a series of terraces. Experts
say that the Roman Emperor Maximian, called "Hercules"
by his subjects, built the villa in the third century A.D. as a
hunting lodge and a comfortable "retreat" in which to prac¬
tise otiuin (the Latin word for "leisure" or "ease"). This
was the ancient form of "rest cure" which though later consi¬
dered as unfitting for a man, has today been reinstated under
the name of "relaxation" as a way of counteracting the wear
and tear of modern life. There seems to be nothing new in
this world as other features of the villa show. One of these
is a central heating system using the walls to radiate heat
often thought of as an achievement of modern technology
and there are two rooms for bathers a frigidarium (cooling
room) and a tepidarium (a warm room between the hot baths
and the cooling room).
The architectural beauty of t
richness of its interior decoration
. .both testifying to an art in full
flower. The splendid mosaics
reveal many aspects of Roman
life in the third century and illus¬
trate the new forms of artistic
expression of this period.
One of the mosaics shows ten
beautiful women wearing "bikinis"
similar in cut and size to the
modern two-piece bathing suits
which caused such an outcry when
they first appeared on European
beaches a few years ago.
These pretty bathers dance in a
circle shaking cymbals and other
musical instruments which strong¬
ly recall the picturesque rhythmic
equipment featured by South-
American bands. This mosaic is
the only existing example of this
particular type of entertainment
(of which the Romans were past
masters) which closely resembles
our modern revues.
A first impression had suggested
that these extremely modern-
looking girls were doing gym¬
nastics, Professor Biagio Pace
tells us in his study The Mosaics
of Piazza Armerina, published
in 1955, the year before his
death. But, he points out, apart
from the one certain element oí
water (depicted by blue mosaics)
at the feet of the girls, there is no other definite indication,
and their positions do not really fit a display of women's
gymnastics. Their actions can best be described as a
choreographic display, in which balls are thrown and palm
branches and tambourines waved to the accompaniment of
graceful movements. Professor Pace considers that the
mosaic represents a "water ballet" similar to our modern
aquacade revues.
Ignoring previously sacred laws of proportion and purity
of line, the artist deliberately distorts the hips of the dancers,
thus expressing most strikingly the movement. The choice
of colours and tones also adds to the expressive vitality of
the scene.
The techniques used by the artists immediately suggest
modern painting trends; we might well use the terms
"Primitive" and "Impressionist" in talking of these works.
In any case here we see a "dynamic" conception of mosaics

for the first time. Every previously known example had rein¬
forced the belief that the special techniques of this art pre¬
vented it from effectively portraying motion. In most mosaics
action only emerges symbolically, the figures always appear¬
ing to be in suspended animation, even where the artist wishes
to depict movement. In this respect, therefore, the many
mosaics of Piazza Armerina constitute a revolution in graphic
expression.
Inspired by the public games of the time the artist has
created a kaleidoscope of glittering pictures, superb pagan
songs of beauty, physical skill, strength and youth. Of these
one of the most significant represents a chariot race. Skil¬
fully caught in full élan, the athletes and horses come alive in
a pictorial composition of exceptional force.
At times this particular way of treating mosaics, this
strength of expression makes one
feel that the Roman artist was
more a sculptor than a painter.
This feeling is confirmed by the
large mosaic decorating the room
dedicated to the hunt. Between
two women's faces, one of
which symbolizes Africa, and the
other Armenia, the theme, de¬
veloped on a grand scale, illus¬
trates the different episodes of the
venationes, the great hunts or¬
ganized to track down and
capture wild animals destined for
the arena.
Outstanding effects of relief
and realism have been achieved
through a skilful choice of con¬
trasting colours. The bodies of
the wild animals seem to be
writhing in pain; one can sense
the straining muscles of the
hunters. Each episode is a separ¬
ate scene but the artist has
attained a unity and a harmony of
composition by a deft use of
proportions. These mosaics also
throw interesting light on the
ingenious methods used by the
hunter to get the wild animals on
board the boats which were to
take them to Rome, and also to
land them on arrival.
Capturing the wild beasts
without wounding them severely
was a hazardous business. So great was the demand for lions
that they eventually disappeared from North Africa. The
hunters were obliged to go further and further south for them.
In another room the decorative theme chosen by the artist
illustrates the legendary labours of Hercules, doubtless as a
tribute to the imperial owner of the villa. Here the sculptur¬
al quality of the mosaics is still more accentuated. The
extraordinary relief of certain scenes, the proportions of the
bodies and the great attention to detail recall the "monu¬
mental" technique of Michelangelo's famous paintings.
The discovery of the imperial residence of Piazza Arme¬
rina is of incalculable value for the study of Roman mosaics.
It is also a reminder to archaeologists throughout the world
of the extraordinary research possibilities offered by Sicily.
The many civilizations which followed one another have made
Sicily a veritable storehouse of archaeological treasures and
immense riches are still hidden in this "Island of the Sun".

Unesco tackles a world problem :
THE PARADOX OF THE JUNGLE
by Gerald Wendt
One-third of the world's usable land 15 million square
miles is warm and rainy. In what is called the humid
tropics the average temperature during the coldest month
does not fall below 64° Fahrenheit and the minimum
annual rainfall is 27.5 inches. Some parts of this vast area
are almost uninhabited, others are among the most densely
populated regions of the earth.
In the 12 million square miles of the hot and humid parts of
America, Africa, Australia and New Guinea the population
does not exceed ten per¬
sons per square mile, but
the three million square
miles of tropical Asia
are populous. The valley
of the Ganges and the
plains of Orissa in India
have 1,200 people to the
square mile. The densest
populations in the world
are in the Bengal Delta,
Cochin and Travancore
in India, the Adiwerno
district of Java and the
delta of the Red River
in Tonkin, where the
population reaches nearly
4,000 per square mile.
In spite of weather
conditions that promote
plant growth, the stand¬
ard of living is low in
these areas because the
land available per family
is too small, because the
heavy rains wash the fer¬
tility from the soil, be¬
cause bacterial decay is
so rapid that little humus
is formed, sometimes
because heavy floods
alternate with dry peri¬
ods, and because of the
prevalence of bacterial
and insect-born disease.
Like all human priva¬
tion, this is a matter
of world import. The
humid tropics, like the
arid and desert lands,
extend all round the
globe; they are not limit¬
ed by national boun¬
daries and their problems
are essentially scientific
ones of understanding
and mastering nature in
which not only many
nations but many sciences must co-operate. Experts in
climate and weather, in geology and soils, in water control
and irrigation, in plant and animal life, in bacteria and insects,
in diseases, psychology and education, must put their heads
together and work together.
The pattern for such co-operation has already been establish¬
ed by Unesco in the five years that its Advisory Committee on
Arid Lands Research has been at work. Now, the rain forest

THE HUMID TROPICS, like the arid and desert lands, extend all around
the globe; they are not limited by national boundaries and their problems
cannot be solved solely by national action. Today, Unesco and other U.N.
agencies are co-operating with governments to find solutions for the many
problems of life in the tropics. High disease rate, for example, is a major
obstacle to greater food production and improved living conditions. Above,

and the rice paddy, the fisheries and the milk supply, over¬
population and malnutrition, insect control and tropical
diseases, eroded soil and the use of fertilizers, flood control and
irrigation, and other aspects of life in the humid tropics are
also being included in the new scientific research programme
being undertaken by Unesco.
They were discussed at a meeting sponsored by Unesco at
Kandy, Ceylon, last year, which was attended by specialists in
tropical research from ten countries (Brazil, Ceylon, France,
India, Indonesia, the Ne¬
therlands, Pakistan, the
Philippines, the United
Kingdom and the United
States), by observers
from four international
scientific organizations
(the International Geo¬
graphical Union, the In¬
ternational Union for the
Protection of Nature, the
Pacific Science Associa¬
tion and the Pan-Indian
Ocean Science Associa¬
tion), and representatives
from four Specialized
Agencies of the United
Nations (the Food and
Agriculture Organization,
the World Health Organ¬
ization, the World Mere-
orological Organization,
and Unesco).
A general discussion
on tropical vegetation
opened the meeting,
which closed with specific
recommendations for
Unesco's programme of
research on the improve¬
ment of humid tropical
life. According to the
recommendations of the
Preparatory Committee
at Kandy, the same pat¬
tern as was used for the
Arid Zones will be fol¬
lowed with regard to the
humid tropical zones in
the expectation of similar
success.
The first step will be
the organization of a
permanent Advisory
Committee on Humid
Tropics Research. From
Brazil, Unesco received
an invitation to hold the
first meeting of the new committee next July in the city of
Manaus, in the heart of the Amazon jungle. In conjunction
with this meeting, an international symposium is to take place
on the various chemicals that can be derived from tropical
plants. Another international symposium, on climate, vege¬
tation and land utilization in the humid tropics, is scheduled
to be held in conjunction with the Ninth Pacific Science
Congress when this opens in Bangkok next December.

The Unesco Courier. March 1957
The committee at Kandy
submitted a list of 19 recommen¬
dations for action by Unesco in
the humid tropics programme.
One called for a special effort
to identify and classify the
enormous number of tropical
insects that play so large a part in
tropical life, many of which are
still largely unknown. Another
indicated that priority should be
given to a classification of tropical
soils, with a reference collection of
soil types and a study of the role
of organic matter and nitrogen
compounds in soils of humid
regions. A third recommendation
was for the establishment of a
system of fellowships to enable
research workers in humid tropical
sciences to study abroad. The
committee also proposed to
Unesco that some financial assis¬
tance be given for the publication
of a map of the main vegetation
regions of Africa and for the
publication of bibliographies on
the plant families of Indonesia, the
tropical Pacific Islands, and of
Africa south of the Sahara.
Man's use of tropical vegetation
differs widely in various parts of
the world. The Kandy meeting
recognized rice culture as probably
the most valuable since the flooded
fields do not allow the nutrient
elements in the soil to be washed
away. But both the varieties of
rice and the methods of cultivation
can be improved. One expert,
Dr. Camargo, Director of the Na¬
tional Agricultural Research Ser¬
vice, of Brazil, strongly condemn¬
ed the "extractivist mentality"
which extracts and exploits the
wild wealth of the forest with no
effort at permanent cultivation or
the growing of food. "Today",
he said, "the Amazon territory,
with everything necessary to grow
abundant food, is still importing
milk, rice, beans, meat and fats."
Malnutrition in tropical countries
is usually due to a lack of proteins
in the diet. Dr. F.R. Barucha,
Director of the Institute of Science
at Bombay, pointed out that in
India there is an average of one
bullock to each person, but that
.they do not contribute to the meat
supply, and even the milk yield of
the cows and the buffaloes is small
in quantity and poor in protein content because the grass on
which the cattle feed is itself low in protein. One of the chief
needs for tropical peoples is the development of a high-protein
grass that grows well under humid conditions, if only to
improve the milk supply.
Comprehensive reports were submitted to the symposium on
Java and other Indonesian islands, on conditions in Ceylon, on
the Caribbean region, the Philippines, the Amazon basin and
the tropical zone of Africa.
One report pointed out that Africa is probably a unique
test tube in which to evaluate the various physiological and
psychological elements of "tropical inanition or fatigue" in
indigenous peoples. It suggested carrying out comparative
studies and tests among sample groups from Africa's hot
tropical, hot desert, and temperate regions to evaluate the
relative mental and physical capabilities of groups in each

An impressive panel of consultants who will be available for
special reports or committee work has already been listed by
Unesco as a result of invitations from the Director-General to
the member states. Twenty-three countries named 120 experts
who will thus co-operate in the humid tropics research pro¬
gramme. They are: Australia, Austria, Belgium, Brazil,
Burma, Ceylon, France, Haiti, India, Indonesia, Italy, Japan,
Mexico, Netherlands, Pakistan, Philippines, Spain, Switzerland,
Syria, Union of South Africa, United Kingdom, United States
and Viet Nam.
Unesco is also compiling a list of all research institutions
that deal with humid tropical questions, which already shows
87 institutions in 22 countries. More will be added in the
coming campaign for complete international co-operation.

Japan's sausage stove'
for mountain climbers
by Mafsukata Saburo
The daily press recently reported the tragic
story of two young alpinists trapped on Mt.
Blanc in the French Alps, who froze to death
despite all efforts to rescue them. The article
below, reproduced from Japan Quarterly (Vol. Ill
No. 4, 1956) tells of a simple body-warming
apparatus used last May by a Japanese expedi¬
tion which for the first time scaled Mt. Manaslu
(26,658 ft.) in the Nepalese Himalayas. The
apparatus dates back some 300 years and was
described by one of Japan's greatest authors, lhara Saikaku (1642-1693) a
number of whose works are now being translated into English and French for
the first time as part of the UNESCO Collection of Representative Works.
Together with their modern scien¬
tific equipment the Japanese
expedition which made the as¬
cent of Mt. Manaslu carried along a
very old and simple apparatus that
performed an important function and
performed it well. The device in ques¬
tion is a little heater called a kairo,
or literally "'chest-warmer". It is so
small and simple that one hesitates-to
speak of it as an "apparatus", though
it protected the climbers from tempera¬
tures as low as thirty degrees below
zero while they were camped at an
altitude of 23,600 feet.
The kairo consists of nothing more
than powdered charcoal wrapped in
paper and placed in a simple metal
container. The charcoal itself is made
by baking waste hemp reeds in the
earth. It is packed, rather like a
sausage, into a paper tube about three
quarters of an inch in diameter and
four inches long, which is then tied
at the ends. All one has to do to use
the "sausage" is to light one end of
it and place it in the metal container.
A child can do this with no trouble.
When the fire is lit, the container,
which is about the size of a small
sardine tin, can be wrapped in cloth
and put inside one's clothing next to
any part of the body one wishes to
keep warm. The charcoal burns
several hours, but the temperature is
not high enough even to scorch the
cloth around the container, and one
can sleep with the device in one's
clothing with perfect safety.
The kairo heaters carried by the
Manaslu expeditioners were of a very
ordinary type often used by modern
city dwellers. A newer type of kairo,
containing platinum wires which are
oxidized with benzine fumes, threat¬
ens to drive the old-fashioned type
out of common use, but it would have
been useless to the Manaslu climbers
since it does not work when the sur¬
rounding temperature and air pressure
are exceedingly low, as in the lofty
Himalayas.
So far science does not seem to
have offered an explanation for the
effectiveness of the charcoal kairo at
great heights, where oxygen is thin.
Presumably the secret is that, since
the charcoal is powdered, the surface
area (that is, the area absorbing
oxygen) is relatively large. At the
same time the fact that the fuel is
composed of many small particles pre¬
vents the heat from permeating ra¬
pidly. When the tube of charcoal is
lit at one end, the fire first moves
down the centre and then spreads out¬
ward.
Aside from small kairo carried in
stomach wrappers, the Manaslu climb¬
ers also used larger ones in their
sleeping bags to keep their feet warm.
In this case too the simple heater
proved effective.
As is true of so many of the fur¬
nishings and implements that we use
all the time, the history of the kairo
has not been adequately studied.
Mr. T. Yamamoto, himself a manu¬
facturer of charcoal for kairo, once
contributed an essay on the subject in
a magazine devoted primarily to Japa¬
nese poetry. Mr. Yamamoto points
out that the kairo was mentioned by
the great Edo-period novelist lhara
Saikaku in his Oritome, a series of
stories published in 1694. Saikaku 's
kairo apparently differed little in form
from the type we have been discussing.
In those times, however, the container
was made of copper rather than tin,
and the charcoal from knotgrass or
the stems of eggplants.
No mention of the kairo has been
found in sources earlier than 1690,
nor is there any information as to the
stages through which it has evolved
since. One reason for the modern use
of hemp reed charcoal is simply that
hemp reed is plentiful and cheap, but
it is uncertain when this material was
adopted. Aside from posing a rather
quaint problem to scientists, this little
tube of charcoal packed in paper
presents questions of interest to histor¬
ians and particularly those who are
concerned with life among the com¬
mon people.
DR. Alfred North Whitehead,
the distinguished British-
American philosopher and
educationist, once remarked
that "Every major advance
in civilization all but wrecks the
society in which it takes place." I
suggest this to be no academic
truism, but a truth we see in
operation before our very eyes.
Many countries in the world today
have an age-old culture of their own
which is suffering severe strains and
maladjustments because of their
need to fit an alien element into
their own cultural patterns. That
alien element is, in brie'i, the tech¬
nological culture of the Atlantic
countries. Every society into which
it has been introduced has suffered
radical change. The society of
Western Europe, in the century
following the Industrial Revolution,
changed almost out of recognition, as
the forms and patterns of thought
and behaviour were swept away or
were deeply modified.
Yet, in Western Europe the new
element grew slowly and the process
of adjustment was gradual so that
in time those societies came to realize
that Mankind was in the presence of
a tremendous problem and began to
grope towards some solutions to it.
What are these solutions whereby
men and women in the Western
countries sought to make Technology
their servant instead of their master?
One of them is Education the need
for a high level of public knowledge.
Another is a wide diffusion of tech¬
nical skill and expertise, so that every
schoolchild knows something of the
workings of the machine-made tra¬
ditions in which he is being brought
up. Another is the gradual develop¬
ment o'f social institutions, the Trade
Union, the professional association,
and so on all operating within a
framework which still embodies a
traditional culture.
But what of the societies where
this Technology which originat¬
ed in the West has been intro¬
duced as an alien element? Such a
society may have none of the antidotes
I have just described and so the
results of an industrial revolution may
be terrible. Slums grow up, workers
are ruthlessly exploited, the checks
and safeguards of the old culture no
longer operate and soon the peasant
who at least had a place in the old
culture and could share in its cha¬
racteristic ways of thought and
feeling, finds himself a dispossessed
proletarian, dismayed and bewildered
in the grip of a ruthless system over
which he has no control.
Knowing there has come to his
country a power which can perform
miracles of production, which can
create wealth where once there was
but swamp and jungle, he may yet
be unready to absorb its spiritual
implications. The West has had
decades to adjust itself to the new
way of life. Today the processes of
technological infiltration are being

FUTURE MECHANICS use Unesco-supplied equipment in automotive shop of Afghan Institute
of Technology, Kabul. Today, more than 200 scientists and educators are carrying out Unesco
technical assistance projects in nearly 50 countries. Projects range from scientific research and
technical training to fundamental education to eliminate illiteracy and raise living standards.
and technical assistance is being
given to under-developed countries
on a more systematic scale than ever
before. The United States Point Four
programme, the Colombo Plan, the
agreements made by the Government
of the U.S.S.R. with the governments
of the East, the United Nations
Technical Assistance schemes all
speak for themselves. They all
embody a bold and challenging plan
for economic development.
At the same time is there not an
urgent need to develop new social
forms, new institutions, new skills,
which will nurture and cherish the

which the world industrial revolution
is bringing about.
Every time Unesco sends an edu-
All the activities of Unesco can
be and should be related to this
great global responsibility. I
believe today that most of them are.
It is right that this should be so for
the re-adjustment of cultures is
the predominant feature of our time.
It will happen whether we like it or
not. It is Unesco's job to make sure
that It is a triumph and not a disaster
for Humanity.
Even in the so-called highly deve¬
loped countries Unesco is concerned
with the same question. Highly
developed countries have by no
means fully mastered applied science
or the machine. In these countries,
the problems are the same in prin¬
ciple but different in degree and
content. The effects of automation,
the as yet unrivalled power of atomic
energy to serve or obliterate the
peoples of the earth, human relations
in factory and workshop, the failure
of the industrial civilization to create
its own distinct culture these are all
pressing problems in the most
advanced industrial countries of the
world. Here Unesco's constant
reminder to governments of the
immense importance of the Rights of
Man even among nations with a high
standard of living is necessary and
indefatigable. Here Unesco's in¬
sistence upon the need for untiring
research, the keeping up of standards
in knowledge and its dissemination
among the technically under-deve¬
loped peoples is a contribution to the
common weal.
The highly developed countries are
thus subject to strains themselves.
At the same time, they must spare
some of their best minds and they
must divert some of their resources
to the job of helping those countries
which need help. This is a call they
cannot refuse. It is a call to rise
above their own national interests.
It is the call which Unesco has put
before them and which Unesco has
made easier for them to answer.
Unesco has grown in prestige be¬
cause it has shown how technology
can come to a nation as à blessing and
not as an evil; because it has ensured
that the developed countries play
their part in maintaining their own
social health, so that they may help
others. What Unesco's role in these
times of technical change has been is
international co-operation in practice
words and pious exhortations,
but action.

I hough little more than 250 miles separate
I Cairo from the St. Catherine Monastery in
the Sinai Peninsula this distance adds up to a
two-day journey by automobile. In the pre-
automobile era, pilgrims spent 15 days on
camel's back on the same trip.
From Cairo to Suez there is a fine highway,
but once across the Canal, the road becomes
little more than a track on which vehicles
have to move slowly, grinding through the
sand or bouncing over loose stones. But the
traveller becomes so absorbed in the majestic
beauty of the scenery and in the monastery
when he reaches it that he hardly notices the
rigours of the journey.
In the first centuries of the Christian era the
Sinai Peninsula became a centre of refuge for
monks and Anchorites (the early Christian
recluses and hermits). About the beginning
of the 4th century they sent a delegation to
St. Helena, mother of Constantine the Great,
asking her protection. She ordered the
erection of a small fortress with a church
built inside.
We still have a descriptive picture of the
area as it appeared to a nun of noble birth
named Sylvia (also .known as Etheria) from
Spanish Galicia, who went to visit the Holy
Places of the Sinai early in the 4th century.
Apart from her pious virtues, Etheria had
also the makings of an excellent reporter.
She recounts the journey she made to the Sinai
in great detail, with a wealth of
facts on the history of each site
(facts which have hardly changed
in 16 centuries). At the foot of

Uoth the St. Catherine Monastery (one of the
oldest known in the Christian world) and the
priceless treasures it contains have been pro¬
nounced "intact" following the recent hostilities
on the Sinai peninsula, where the monastery is
situated.
The statement was made by a Belgian specialist,
Professor Gerard Garitte, who was sent by
Unesco to investigate the condition of the
monastery and its collections, at the request of the
Governments of Egypt and Israel.
Professor Garitte was also a member of a three-
man team who microfilmed almost 2,000,000
pages of manuscripts of the St. Catherine collec¬
tion in 1950 for the U. S. Library of Congress.

Mount Moses (The Mountain of the
Decalogue) she found a community of
monks living on the reputed site of
the Burning Bush, where according to
the Bible, God appeared to Moses,
telling him to ascend the mountain
to receive the Ten Commandments.
On the accession of the Emperor
Justinian in 527 A.D. these monks
asked the ruler to build them a mon¬
astery behind whose walls they would
be safe from bandits and other mar¬
auders.
Justinian agreed, and on his orders
the present monastery was built.
With its towers and high walls it was
more like a castle than a home
of monks, but, fearing that even
these walls would not be sufficient
protection, Justinian also sent 200
slaves with their families to defend it
in case of attack. The monastery
gained its name from the fact that
relics of St. Catherine of Alexandria,
found on the Sinai Peninsula, were
brought there and may still be seen
by pilgrims.

stepping into the past, into a fortified
castle of the Middle Ages. Looking
down from the ramparts and towers
one sees narrow winding alleys which
separate the quarters of the monks.
But this is an almost deserted for¬
tress. Instead of the hundreds of
religious men it once housed, there
are today only a dozen or so monks
who spend their lives in their ce1' or
in the chapels. They follow, as hi ihe
past, the Greek Orthodox rite.
Despite all the sieges and pillaging,
the treasures which have accumulated
there during 14 centuries are consider¬
ed priceless. The walls of the Basilica
are covered with ancient icons of
great artistic value. On each side of
the altar are two reliquaries offer¬
ings to St. Catherine decorated with
precious stones.
One, dating from the 18th century,
was the gift of the Russian Empress,
Catherine the Great. Nearby on a
small table is a golden chalice and a
tiara enhanced by rubies and emer¬
alds. It would require a catalogue of
many pages to enumerate all the
riches that exist here.
Behind the altar is the Chapel of
the Burning Bush. All who enter are
asked to remove their shoes in com¬
memoration of the words God spoke
to Moses: "'Put off thy shoes from
off thy feet, for the place whereon
thou standest is holy ground." Here,
too, the walls are almost completely
covered by icons.
For many years the monks had no
idea of the real value of their posses¬
sions, but since the discovery of the
Codex Sinaiticus, they have watched
over their treasures., jealously. The
Codex Sinaiticus, one of the three or
four oldest texts of the New Testa¬
ment, was discovered in 1844 by the
German biblical critic, Tischendorf,
who visited the monastery library,
hoping to come across some interest¬
ing manuscripts to use in his studies.
In the middle of the room he found a
wastepaper basket full of parchment
sheets due to be burned. Examining
one of them, he recognized it as a
fragment of a very ancient biblical
manuscript, as, he also found, were
the other 129 sheets he rescued from
the same waste basket.
He obtained 43 of the sheets and
impressed on the monks that they
should carefully preserve the rest.
Later the Czar of Russia bought the
manuscript from the monks for the
equivalent of just over £1,000.
In 1933 the Soviet Union sold the
Codex Sinaiticus to the British
Museum for £100,000 said to have
been the highest price ever paid until
then for a book. The monks' regret
at having disposed of the manuscript
some eighty years earlier can easily be
imagined.
Today a new building houses the
library which is the pride of the
monastery. With around 3,500 Byzan¬
tine, Greek, Arab and Russian docu¬
ments it is regarded as the second
most important collection of manu¬
scripts in the world. (The most im¬
portant is in the Vatican.) St. Cather¬
ine's has also a number of gospel
books, some of them bound and others
illuminated with delightful miniatures.
In 1950 a three-man team microfilmed
most of the contents of the St. Cather¬
ine collection for the United States
Library of Congress, taking nearly
2,000,000 photos of the manuscripts
page by page.

exact spot where Moses beheld the burning
bush which was not consumed, and heard the

A LEGENDARY
CITY IS ABOUT
TO DIE
FOR THE
SECOND TIME
by A.D. Tavares Bastos
FALL OF CANUDOS. Historic photo on right is one
of the rare documents available today of the great
"Rebellion in the Backlands". It was taken almost
immediately after the fall of Canudos on October 5,
A legendary city is about to die.
The scene of an incredible drama of violence, fana¬
ticism and misery, of indomitable courage and
endurance that took place some sixty years ago, it was
born condemned and has lived condemned. In a few
months' time it will disappear forever, submerged under
millions of tons of water. In this supreme sacrifice it
will serve to redeem one of the most parched and dis¬
inherited regions of northeastern Brazil's "Polygon of
Drought".
The town is named Canudos. Though it is almost totally
unknown outside of Brazil, there is hardly a Brazilian for
whom it does not evoke deep stirrings and recall one of
the great epics of Brazil's past.
Canudos lies in the far interior of the arid sertao in the
state of Bahia, where a backland people have lived for
centuries practically isolated from the life of the seaboard
and the rest of the country. Year after year they have
waged a terribly unequal struggle against a hostile environ¬
ment, against the double spectre of drought and famine.
This is the region of the caatinga, the gnarled dwarf
bushes bristling with spiny thorns, the no-man's-land of
xique-xique and mandacaru cactuses, of parched earth
and sun-baked rock hills, of leather-clad vaqueiros (cow¬
boys), one-time jagungos (outlaws) and former religious
fanatics.
It was a religious visionary, Antonio Conselheiro (the
"Counsellor") who in 1893, with a handful of miserable,
ragged followers, founded the tiny citadel of Canudos in
Antonio Dias Tavares Bastos, Brazilian poet and man of letters, has been
a member of the Permanent Delegation of Brazil to Unesco since 1947.
His major works have been written in French and have helped to make
Brazilian poetry better known to the French-speaking world. They include :
Introduction â la poésie ibéro-américaine, published in 1947 in collaboration
with Pierre Darmangeat, and Anthologie de la poésie brésilienne contempo¬
raine (1954).

the wilderness, defied the Federal government, and
touched off the biggest war of the sertao Brazil has known.
It was Canudos that for one full year (from 1896 to 1897)
held out against four fully equipped military expeditions
sent to subdue it, refused to surrender, and fought on
to the last man until the whole town was no more than
a heap of ruins. It was Canudos that shook the young
Republic of Brazil to its moral foundations, its very name
provoking terror throughout the country. It was Canudos
that inspired what is commonly regarded as the greatest
of Brazilian classics, Os Sertoes by Euclides da Cunha.
Rebellion in the Backlands, as the work is known in
English translation, has been described as "one of the
most remarkable books ever written," and "the Bible
of Brazilian nationality." The late Stefan Zweig termed
it "a great national epic... a complete psychological pic¬
ture of the Brazilian soil, the people, and the country
such as has never been achieved with equal insight and
psychological comprehension."
In his history of Brazilian literature entitled Marvellous
Journey, Samuel Putnam (translator of Os Sertoes)
writes : "In the place that it holds in the esteem and
affections of an entire people, it can only be compared
to the Divine Comedy or Don Quixote. Like these great
classics it is the expression of the very soul of a race in
all its strength and all its unconcealed weakness... No
other book ever laid hold of a nation in the same way
and to the same degree as this one." And the Brazilian
novelist Erico Verissimo has written : "If I had to choose
just one book in Brazilian literature to be translated into
other languages as representative of my country and of
my people, I would certainly pick Os Sertoes."
The story of Canudos begins north of the states of
Bahia and Pernambuco, in Ceará, a vast tract of land
scourged by periodic drought and famine. Antonio Mendes
Maciel the Counsellor came from Ceará. His family
were farmers and cattle grazers, copper-skinned sertanejos

1897 and shows Federal troops occupying the devas¬
tated town. It took four Brazilian military expedi¬
tions one full year to defeat a bearded mystic surround¬
ed by a horde of fanatic believers and fugitives from
justice. Final expedition comprising 5,000 men re¬

(inhabitants of the sertao), proud, courageous and inde¬
pendent. They got on well with their neighbours except
for the Araujos, a rich landowner with powerful family
connexions in the Nordeste, with whom they had been
feuding fiercely for years. Murder and cruel vendettas
marked their relations, decimated the two families, and
left an imprint of tragedy on Antonio Maciel's childhood.
Later, an unhappy marriage added a further note of calam¬
ity to his life, and his true vocation began to take shape.
One day, he set out on foot across the land. His wan¬
derings took him over enormous stretches of territory. He
crossed the whole state of Pernambuco, the state of
Sergipe, then Bahia where we find traces of him as early
as 1876. During these endless peregrinations he endured
every hardship hunger, thirst, exhaustion but remained
imperturbable and remote. He seemed to float above such
material contingencies. He addressed his listeners with
the announcement of the end of the world, promising a
better life in heaven and preaching contempt 'for this
wicked earthly existence. Soon he was being credited
with miracles and people began to call him "Counsellor".
A document published in Rio de Janeiro describes him
during this period as "having a great influence on the
minds of the ordinary people, using his strange appearance
and his austere, ascetic habits to impress the simple and
the ignorant. He looks almost like a mummy. Under the
cloak of religious sentiment, he gathers the people around
him and leads them where he lists. He appears intelligent,
though lacking in culture."
Then the number of his disciples began to grow, and
more people began to flock around him. For ten years
they went from village to village, from town to hamlet,
erecting chapels wherever they went. And the people
from the surrounding countryside who came to listen to
the Conselheiro preach, begged him to perform miracles.
In 1882, however, the Archbishop of Bahia, alarmed at
reports about this independent and superstitious lay
prophet who was troubling people's minds, asked the
clergymen in his diocese to forbid him to preach. His
efforts were of no avail.
Five years later the same archbishop appealed to the
President of the Province to take steps against the Consel¬
heiro. The president wrote to the Minister of the Empire
(Brazil did not become a republic until two years after¬
wards, in 1889) requesting that the mystic be placed in an
insane asylum in Rio de Janeiro. The reply came that
there was no room available at the asylum. This simple
refusal by the authorities was to open the way to the
tragedy of Canudos.
In 1893 the Counsellor found himself in the community
of Bom Conselho (state of Bahia). It was there that for
the first time he preached open rebellion against the law,
haranguing the crowds to refuse to pay the taxes then
being collected, and ordering a bonfire built of tax forms.
Realizing the gravity of his act, he assembled his fol¬
lowers and headed north into the wild sertao desert which
he knew like a book having crossed it in every direction
on foot. He had good reason to be uneasy, for a posse
of 200 police was on his trail. Yet, incredible though it
may seem, the police force was thrown back and complete¬
ly put to rout by the Conselheiro's band of fanatics.
The rebels continued their advance deep into the rugged
sertao until they came to Canudos where they established
themselves. The year was 1893. At the time, Canudos
consisted of nothing more than a few wretched, tumble¬
down shacks housing a collection of rough, gun-toting
frontiersmen who spent their time drinking
and smoking curious-looking pipes. These
pipes gave Canudos its name, for their
stems, about a yard long, were made from
sturdy reeds (called canudos de pito) which
are found growing along the river banks.

LEGENDARY
CITY (Cont'd)
ore than the outlaws, it is the desert
that must be vanquished'
The Counsellor had picked his hide-away well. Canudos
was a natural stronghold. It was deeply ensconced within
an elliptical circle of mountains (one had the fitting name,
Monte Santo) and it was almost entirely surrounded by
the river Vasa-Barris which made two hairpin twists before
it (see the map on opposite page). Its southern edge
was backed by a steep slope; its western flank protected by
a sharp, towering escarpment. All the trails leading to
Canudos passed through narrow gorges and defiles or over
rough, spiny cactus-ridden terrain. It was miles from the
nearest settlement. Canudos was safe from surprise attack.
Conselheiro and his followers set about building their
town. In a few weeks houses had been constructed, not
in simple rows along straight streets "but in a jumbled
labyrinth of closely packed, narrow tortuous alleys. In
the central square, a church was built. At amazing speed,
the village grew and expanded as new followers abandoned
their distant homesteads, and made their way to Canudos.
Soon outlaws and ex-convicts joined their ranks.
Feeding this growing population soon became an alarm¬
ing problem that inevitably led to foraging expeditions
and even to murder. Ranches and villages were plundered
for food as well as other materials. The Conselheiro, his
head more than ever in the clouds, appeared to ignore
such details and busied himself with the celebration of
marriages and baptisms, and matters of government.
In November 1896, the first army troops were dispatched
from the state capital of Bahia to "polish off" the outlaw-
fanatics, or jagungos as they were now commonly called.
After a long and weary trek inland, suffering all the way
from thirst and heat, a hundred soldiers and three offi¬
cers of this expedition were surprised by the Conselheiro's
men at a town called Uauá some 20 miles from Canudos.
Though armed only with old rifles, scythes and clubs, the
jagungos took advantage of their knowledge of the back-
land country and its ambush possibilities. They attacked
at dawn in superior numbers, contented themselves with
a partial victory and withdrew. The survivors of the army
force retreated in such disorder that the people of Uauá
started to panic and began a mass exodus from the town.
The war of the sertao had begun in earnest.
The news of the defeat spread across all of Brazil like
wildfire. The most fantastic rumours passed 'from mouth
to mouth. Almost overnight Antonio Conselheiro had
become Brazil's Public Enemy Number One.
A better organized expedition of 500 men now took the
road for Canudos. The battle was soon joined and quickly
developed into a series of confused encounters. At one
point the jagungos were certain they were on the verge of
defeat, but in the turmoil of battle the government troops
failed to grasp the fact that victory was theirs and instead
withdrew. This sudden change of fortune was hailed at
Canudos as a new miracle of the Prophet.
After this, the population of Canudos continued to grow.
Newcomers included the blind, the paralyzed and lepers,
who all hoped for a miracle. Canudos was now an
organized military camp under the command of the Coun¬
sellor's chief bodyguard.
On February 8, 1897, a 'full colonel of the Brazilian
Army, Antonio Moreira Cesar, set sail from Rio de Janeiro
for Bahia to lead an expedition of three armies against
the small collection of jagungos at Canudos. The main
corps of the expedition included an infantry battalion, a
regiment of artillery and a squadron of cavalry. A few
days after Moreira Cesar's arrival at Bahia, 1,300 'fighting
men, armed with fifteen million rounds of ammunition
and seventy shells for their artillery, had been assembled.
To the music of an army band they marched off in full
regalia into the wilderness.
On February 20th the expedition reached Monte Santo,
south of the Conselheiro's stronghold. With not even the
inkling of a doubt about his victory, Moreira Cesar spoke
of "having lunch at Canudos". His forces were actually
the first to reach the citadel, but the commanding officer
committed one serious military blunder after another.
NO
COMBATTANT
SURVIVED
This poignant document
shows the only survi¬
vors of the bitter drama
of Canudos: a handful
of gaunt, derelict wom¬
en and a few children.
In the final stages of
the siege of Canudos
they were allowed to
leave the town along
with one or two old
men who could not
bear arms. No able-
bodied man ever sur¬
rendered. The citadel
had to be conquered
inch by inch until the
last defender was dead.

Instead of reducing Canudos with his artillery, he ordered
a series of direct assaults cavalry charges, infantry
charges, bayonet attacks. His forces were cut to ribbons.
On March 3, Moreira Cesar, severely wounded the previous
day, died along with two of his staff officers. The attack
collapsed, and the army now completely disorganized
began a retreat which quickly became a rout.
This utter defeat left the nation dumbfounded.
Consternation gripped the people; the government was vio¬
lently attacked by the opposition and the Republic itself
tottered. "Save the Republic !" became the anguished cry
in the face of the growing despondency and despair, and
a multiplicity of legends about Canudos which were
sprouting up from every side.
The government had to act promptly. Mobilization was
ordered of battalions from each of the States of the Union.
The commander of Brazil's second military district, Gen¬
eral Arthur Oscar de Andrade Guimaraes, was placed in
charge of the Fourth Expedition comprising six army bri¬
gades forming two columns, each headed by a general.
Though this force was much stronger than all previous
expeditions, the plan of operations was no different. It
was essentially, as before, a frontal attack by marching
columns (two this time instead of one) instead of a plan
to encircle Canudos from a distance to prevent all escape,
and then to tighten the circle, bring artillery into firing
range and destroy the citadel by bombardment.
The expedition had been formed in April of 1897, but
it was only on June 16 that the first division got under
way. The first communiques announcing victory were
quickly followed by the news oí unexpected reverses and
heavy casualties. Canudos still held out. The arrival of
the first survivors soon confirmed the real truth: the
column had met with total disaster. The ferociousness of
the jagungos, their sniping attacks and raids, the diffi¬
culty of the desert terrain, the lack of water, the intricate
trenchwork defenses constructed around Canudos, and the
impossibility of determining even roughly how many men
the "Prophet of the Backlands" had at his disposal to
defend the citadel, all went to swell the stories that were
told to explain away the latest catastrophe.
Marshal Carlos Machado de Bittencourt, the Secretary
of State at the War Office himself, now took over
command. "More than the jagungos," he declared, "it is
the desert that we must conquer." This time Canudos was
to be crushed. Additional troops were poured into the
area and soon columns were converging on Canudos from
every direction with plenty of artillery and shells.
On August 24, a heavy mortar weighing over a ton and
a half opened fire on the church tower and toppled it.
The artillery pounding continued during the entire month
of September. On October 1 the 'final assault was sounded
and what little remained standing was dynamited.
Then all was still.
Canudos never surrendered. It held out to the very last
man. Conquered, literally, inch by inch it fell on October 5,
toward dusk, when its last four defenders died facing a
furiously raging army of thousands of soldiers. The four
defenders were an old man, two younger men and a child.
A number of women and children and a few old men
had been permitted to leave the citadel during the siege.
They were the only survivors. Over 5,000 destroyed houses
were counted at Canudos. Among them lay the body of
the "Prophet of the Backlands".
Of old Canudos nothing remains today except a collec¬
tion of bullet-marked ruins, and a cross bearing the in¬
scription "Erected in 1893 by A.M.M.C."
(Antonio Mendes Maciel Conselheiro). New
houses were built there in 1909 and a few
thousand inhabitants still live there. Today,
they are preparing for the day when
Canudos will vanish.

LEGENDARY CITY (Continued)
Canudos is located in the heart of Brazil's Polygon of
Drought300,000 square miles of dust bowl ranging
over eight states.
Because they obstinately remain on this hostile land,
the people have been called os flagelados (scourged ones).
Periodically terrible droughts descend upon the region.
When they are so severe that neither man nor beast can
live, the "scourged ones" reluctantly pack their few belong¬
ings and abandon their homes. Then sad processions of
retirantes (the Oakies of Brazil) can be seen making for
the coast or the south or even the Amazon region in search
of a more hospitable climate. Over 1,500,000 retirantes
abandoned the region between 1940 and 1950. Some
return once the rains come, most never do.
To halt this mass exodus, the National Anti-Drought
Department and other government agencies have em¬
barked on an ambitious programme of dam construction
and water development with the aid of Unesco experts.
Rain water and flood waters are now being stored pains¬
takingly behind dams throughout the area (some 600 have
been built so far). The country is studded with reservoirs,
large and small, and at many points they have enabled
the sertanejo to raise crops on irrigated land.
Early in 1955, government engineers began construction
of a new dam in the canton of Euclides da Cunha (so
named in honour of the author of Os Sertoes). Canudos,
located in a valley surrounded by a chain of mountains
EUCLIDES
DA CUNHA
When the campaign
against Canudos was
undertaken, Euclides da
Cunha accompanied the
Sao Paulo battalion to
the front to cover the
expedition for a news¬
paper. His work is thus
a superb piece of
journalism, though he
wrote it some years later at his leisure. Da Cunha
has become a cult in Brazil. Each year the nation
pays homage to him during "Euclides .week", and
its leading men of letters make a pilgrimage to the
little town of Sao José do Rio Pardo in the state
of Sao Paulo where the book was written. The
shack in which da Cunha laboured on the manu¬
script after his day's work as a civil engineer has
b.en preserved as a shrine. In 1909, at the age
of 43 he was killed by an assassin's bullet in Rio.
Many readers skip the first two chapters of Os
Sertoes because it is rather overloaded with
technical terms, and start with the third chapter
where "The Rebellion" takes on the flavour of an
exciting novel, full of plots, pathos and drama. The
book was recently included in a list of 100 of the
world's best novels. English readers may also wish
to read R.B. Cunninghame-Graham's account ot
Antonio Conselheiro, entitled A Brazilian Mystic.
finds itself in the centre of the future reservoir. The bar¬
rage itself is being built seven miles 'from Canudos on the
Rio Vasa Barris at a village named Cocorobó.
A Unesco mission, headed by a French hydrogeologist,
Pierre Taltasse, surveyed the area in July 1955 at the
request of the Brazilian Government, and has been ad¬
vising Brazilian engineers on various technical problems
since then. The barrage will collect all the water accu¬
mulated during the rainy period in an area extending
over 180,000 square yards. The dam will have a height of
32 metres and a length of 1,200 metres. Near Cocorobó, a
new modern city is being constructed for the present
inhabitants of Canudos who will be among the first to
benefit from the newly-created irrigation zone.
When the Cocorobó dam is completed next year, Canu¬
dos will be submerged under 250 million cubic metres of
water. But as the legendary city disappears forever,
37,000 acres of now barren land will help to prove that
man can turn the sertao green.
BATTLE AGAINST
THE DUST BOWL
SINCE June 1953, a Unesco technical assistance mission has
been in northeastern Brazil working closely with the Brazilian
Government in a vast battle against the greatest dust bowl of
the nation. (View of arid sertao or bushland is shown above.) Two
Unesco hydrogeologists, Pierre Taltasse and Etienne Stretta, have
been working not only at the dam going up near Canudos but at
several others: a 500 million cubic metre barrage at Poco da Cruz
in the state of Pernambuco (photo below), due for completion this
year; a 1,000 million cubic metre reservoir at Bico de Pedra in the
state of Minas Gerais; another of the same capacity at Vereda Grande
(state of Piaui); and a dam at Santa Lucia, to be inaugurated this
month near Beto Horizonte, capital of Minas Gerais. On all these
sites the Unesco mission has made soil and water studies and given
advice on dam construction and other problems.
The mission's important training programme includes special courses
for local engineers and technicians both in the field and in the class¬
room; and the selection of promising candidates for Unesco
fellowships (several have now returned from their study abroad and
are at work in the region). As a result of the Unesco team's
efforts, geology has now been accepted as a recognized profession
for the first time in Brazil, and schools of applied geology are
to open shortly in Recife, Sao Paulo, Belo Horizonte and Porto Alegre.
A Hydrogeological Research and Documentation Centre is also
being set up at Recife, at Unesco's instigation. Working under
the auspices of the National Anti-Drought Department, it will
undertake field and laboratory research on soil and rock structure
of the Polygon of Drought, make an inventory of water resources,
and will serve as a clearing house for hydrogeological documentation.

The Unesco Courier. March 1957
i
The first thing most people do when they get a new
passport is to look at the photograph. "Don't I look
awful", they say, "'it doesn't look a bit like me; it
might easily be someone else."
This isn't always a case of injured pride, for most passport
photographs do "look like someone else" or, rather, they
look like a number of people. They are unreliable because,
generally, they are taken without observing certain special
rules and reveal none of the specific characteristics which
make it possible to identify a person, whether he be a
dangerous criminal or an ordinary tourist.
In fact for purposes of identification a photograph is not
really important; it is enough to note down the facial
characteristics so as to be able to pick out a person in a
crowd. These facial characteristics, arranged in a given
order according to a set code, make up the portrait parlé
("speaking portrait"), a system of visual identification deve¬
loped about 60 years ago and still taught in most police
forces.
This system, which is practically irreplaceable, was one of
the most important discoveries of Alphonse Bertillon (1853-
1914), "'the father of scientific detection", whose life and
work are described in a recent issue of Unesco's scientific
quarterly "Impact" (1) by Charles Sannié, a professor of
organic chemistry and director of the French Criminal
Records Department.
The story of Bertillon's life makes fascinating reading, for
he was truly a paradoxical
character, and his career, like
that of many public figures,
was due in a great measure to
chance.
If he had not been an unruly
youngster, a dunce who was
expelled from one school after
another and who reached the
age of 20 having failed every
exam, he would probably have
ended his days as an obscure
laboratory assistant at the
Museum of Natural History,
with an annual salary of
some 1,200 francs.
But as he had none of the
necessary exams to realize this
early ambition, there was
nothing else to do but pack
young Alphonse off to England
where he would at least learn a
foreign language and, since he
was given hardly any money,
learn to face life the hard way and show what he was made
of. This trip to England was Bertillon's first stroke of luck
and influenced his whole life. Not only did he adapt himself
thoroughly to the English outlook and way of life, but he
learned to write and speak English fluently, which later
proved very useful.
His next stroke of luck, strangely enough, was his military
service at Clermont-Ferrand in the centre of France, which
seems to have left him plenty of leisure. So much so that
Bertillon was able to attend courses at the faculty of medicine
and work in the anatomical theatre measuring and comparing
the length of human bones. A strange way, indeed, for a
young soldier to spend his spare time, but perhaps not so
strange after all since Bertillon was merely following a family
tradition, playing over once again the games of his childhood.
Bertillon's father, Louis-Adolphe, a doctor by profession,
was one of the founders of the internationally-known School
and Society of Anthropology of Broca. AU his children,
including Alphonse, were used to hearing their father,
grandfather and their friends holding lengthy discussions on
statistical and anthropological problems and the instruments
for measuring the human body; and soon they learned to
use these instruments.
This explains young Alphonse's bent for anatomy. But
ifter several happy years in the army he had to face up to
the hard realities of life and find himself a job. His first
experience as a clerk in a bank was short-lived since he was
scon dismissed for his untidy handwriting and unruly conduct.
In desperation, he took a job as clerk at the Paris police
headquarters where his father had influential friends.
This proved to be his third stroke of luck and the turning
point in his career. By chance he was assigned to the office
responsible for copying out the index cards of the offenders
committed to the cells each day, where the records of habitual
offenders had to be sorted out from among the others. And
as Bertillon was of an independent disposition and hated
routine work, he could not bring himself to accept the stupid
procedure of his office and set out to improve it by the only
means at his disposal, the only scientific methods within his
range of knowledge.
Thus, between 1878 and 1882, was born the science of
anthropometry. It cost Bertillon an amazing amount of
effort to work out his methods. As Prof. Sannié writes:
"He made up for the gaps in his knowledge by tenacity and
unremitting efforts... the saying that 'Genius is an infinite
capacity for taking pains' is pre-eminently applicable to him."
The trait of obstinacy in Bertillon's character was probably
at the root of his life-long distrust of fingerprints as a method
of identification, though many people today still believe him
to be the "inventor" of this method. In spite of the opinion
of experts in this field, Bertillon maintained that it was
impossible even to begin to classify people especially large
groups of people on the basis of their fingerprints.
Yet in 1902 Bertillon was the first to identify a criminal
who was entirely unknown to the police except by the marks
of his fingers on the glass panel of a piece of furniture which
had been broken open after a
murder. "With the help ol
these marks", writes Prof. San¬
nié in "'Impact", "Bertillon
reconstructed the murderer's
fingerprints and then, with infi¬
nite patience, worked systemati¬
cally through his cards, on
which fingerprints served mere¬
ly as a basis for subdivisions.
He finally discovered a previous
offender whose fingerprints were
identical with those found at the
scene of the crime." The man
was subsequently arrested and
confessed.
The father
of scientific
detectives'
But stubbornness and tho¬
roughness often go hand in
hand, and it was probably these
:haracteristics allied to brilliance
which made Bertillon a pioneei
in his field. "He undoubtedly
invented the art of criminal
identification", writes Prof. San¬
nié, "introducing into police methods the techniques and
reasoning of a real science, namely anthropology."
Long before Bertillon's time, people had thought of making
a plan of the scene of a crime and then photographing it,
but the process was still too complicated to form part of a
policeman's everyday duties. Similarly, though specialists
had thought of collecting material evidence and studying it
in a laboratory, no one before Bertillon had had (he idea of
setting up a special body for this purpose. In both these
fields, the work done by Bertillon represented the
establishment of a full-scale laboratory for scientific detection.
But it is the portrait parlé which remains his most important
discovery and one which has stood the test of time. Scarcely
anything is left of the system of anthropometry, for Bertillon's
photographic methods and apparatus have now been super¬
seded by more advanced techniques. But visual identification
is still, and will continue to be, what it was when invented
by the genius of Bertillon.
"His work", writes Prof. Sannié, "opened up a new era in
criminal investigation... He brought to Ihe police, which had
previously worked on a purely empirical basis, the attitude
and methods of the experimental scientist... The impetus
which he gave to accurate research on evidence and the
attitude of mind he introduced into the police force have
continued to make steady progress ever since."

OLDEST
PERSIAN
MINIATURES
YET FOUND
\j&^^
An honest shepherd is shocked to see his
master adding water to the milk of the ewes.
Q̂
ince the publication of its January issue
\J in colour, devoted in part to Persian
miniatures, the unesco courier has
received a report of the recent discovery
of 109 Persian miniatures which represent
the oldest yet found. The miniatures
decorate the original manuscript (or a con¬
temporary copy) of the Andarz Nameh, a
collection of sage counsels, admonitions and
tales written by Kabus Vushmgir, a Persian
ruler on the shores of the Caspian Sea in
the 11th century. Until this discovery it
had hitherto been believed that the earli¬
est extant Persian miniatures dated from
the end of the 13th century following the
Mongol invasions, when Iran was thorough¬
ly ravaged, its cities were sacked and its
great libraries containing thousands of ma¬
nuscripts or miniatures were destroyed. This
recently discovered manuscript is consider¬
ed of tremendous importance both for the
miniatures it contains and its literary value.

From the Unesco Newsroom...
Jb IGIITING THE 8TII PLAGUE:
Since the start of the autumn migration of
locusts from breeding grounds in the Sudan
and French Equatorial Africa to countries
further north, the U.N. Food and
Agriculture Organization (fao) has been
aiding governments to extend counter¬
attacks against these destructive pests. A
new research centre is linking up control
measures in the seven African territories
most frequently infested by desert locusts,
and operations on the Arabian peninsula
are directed from an fao centre at Jeddah.
After reports of locust movement are
received, units of the control network
locate and attack the swarms. Nine
countries are to provide teams and eight
others funds or supplies, while fao
contributes staff and equipment.
UNICEF IS TEN: When Unicef
(United Nations Children's Fund) came
into being in December 1946 an entire
generation of children was threatened
by the effects of war and its aftermath.
During its first four years Unicef
supplied millions of pounds of powdered
milk and other foodstuffs and tons of
woollens, cottons and leather to be made
into clothes and shoes for needy
European children. Since 1950 the
Fund has been helping the 600,000,000
children in the less developed regions
of the world who are threatened by what
are both preventable and curable
diseases. In 1955, 32 } million mothers
and children were given help and in
1956 more than 36 millions. Over
60 million children have been protected
against tuberculosis. Today, ten years
after its foundation, Unicef is supported
by 101 countries contributing nearly
519 million for its work.
II,LUMAN RIGHTS MUSEUM: In
the little town of Meaux, near Paris, a
museum in the children's amusement park
traces the struggle for human rights in a
lively, visual form, through events in
French history. The work of a Paris
theatrical designer, it comprises 32 dioramas
of historical scenes, such as the setting up
of schools by Charlemagne and the
creation of libraries by King Louis XI.
Added interest is given by the authentic
documents, seals and other historical relics
loaned to the museum by the French
National Archives in Paris.
SCIENTISTS IN EMBRYO: There
are now some 16,000 high school
science clubs with a total membership
of about 350,000 students in the United
States. Activities are often organized
on a nation-wide scale, one example
being the National Science Youth
Month, during which science fairs are
organized by students and a science
talent contest is held. Last October, 40
scholarships were awarded as prizes to
potential research scientists selected from
senior high school pupils.
s,OVIET LIBRARY EXCHANGES:
The international exchange of books,
journals and other publications has become
an important activity of the U.S.S.R.
Academy of Sciences Library in recent
years, and is carried on regularly with
1,500 scientific institutions in 19 countries.
During 1955, for example, the Library sent
257,342 books to libraries abroad and
received 121,198 in return. Founded by
Peter the Great at St.Petersburg in 1714,
the Academy of Sciences Library has
amassed a rich collection of some 7,500,000
scientific works over the past two and a
half centuries.
ATOMS AT WORK 'DOWN
UNDER' : New Zealand (population
2,200,000) is showing how small coun¬
tries can take a share in developing
atomic energy for peaceful uses through
its research and use of radioactive iso¬
topes for agriculture, medicine and in¬
dustry. The Dominion Laboratory in
Wellington has also built a unit for
determining the age of Maori weapons,
tools and other specimens by "dating"
the radioactive carbon in them, and is
thus tracing the history of the country's
Polynesian settlements scientifically for
the first time. A New Zealand physicist
said recently: "Since we are not a big
industrial country, we cannot contribute
on our own to the complicated techno¬
logy of atomic power. But we can use
nuclear techniques more widely to attack
general and local problems. We should
try to do something different from other
countries, instead of plodding behind in
the stock fields."
W(ORLD ART AWARD: The In¬
ternational Art Prize of $10,000 offered
every two years by the Solomon Guggenheim
Foundation of New York for an outstanding
contemporary painting was awarded for
1956/57 to a work by the British artist
Ben Nicholson. Nineteen other prizes of
$1,000 were given by the Foundation,
sixteen of them for works from different
lands and three as continental awards for
paintings from Africa, Europe and the
Americas. Judging was carried out in
accordance with suggestions of three
international organizations closely linked
with Unesco the International Council of
Museums, the International Association
of Plastic Arts and the International
Association of Art Critics.
'BOOKS FOR ASIAN CHILDREN':
A small but useful contribution to East-
West understanding has been made by
a recent Unesco publication, "Books for
Asian Children" (1) which lists 500
publications from world literature, in
the original or in translated or adapted
versions, suitable for youngsters in Asian
countries. Compiled by Mrs. Shakuntala
Bhatawdekar, formerly Children's Li¬
