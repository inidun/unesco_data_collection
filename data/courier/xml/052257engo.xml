A YEAR
UNDER THE SIGN
OF THE BOOK
"All that Mankind has done,
thought, gained or been; it is
lying as in magic preservation in
the pages of books." Thomas
Carlyle. Right, "The Librarian",
by the Italian painter Giuseppe
Arcimboldo (1527-1593).
by Julian Behrstock
f%S it passed the mid-point
there was evidence that International
Book Year was catching hold all over
the world. Upwards of 100 countries
were carrying out national plans. Pub¬
lishers, authors, librarians, book¬
sellers and their national and inter¬
national organizations were united in
unprecedented fashion behind the ob¬
jectives of the Year. Trade unions,
welfare groups, churches and youth
organizations were enlisting their mem¬
bers in special book activities. Press,
radio and television were focussed on
books. Mail pouring in to the Unesco
Secretariat signalled a great ground-
swell of public support.
What are the main issues of Inter¬
national Book Year? First, there is a
book shortage so acute in many parts
of the world as to be called a "book
famine". Second, there are not
enough authors to meet the immense
hunger for reading matter. Thirdly,
until the reading habit becomes in¬
grained, books cannot play their full
role in promoting social and economic
development. Finally, there is growing
concern about the content of books in
relation to educational advancement
and international understanding.
It is precisely these four issues that
were singled out by Unesco's General
Conference when it decided by
acclamation to proclaim 1972 as Inter¬
national Book Year. These are like¬
wise the main subjects of this issue of
the "Unesco Courier".

JULIAN BEHRSTOCK la Director of Unesco's
Office of Free Flow of Information, which is
responsible for International Book Year.
He organized the series of Unesco book
development meetings for Asia (1966), Africa
(1968), Latin America (1969), and the Arab
States (1972). Before joining Unesco, he
was an editor on current history for a U.S.
encyclopaedia.
Examples abound of action taken
throughout the world in response to
this Unesco initiative:
Thailand has initiated free distribu¬
tion of textbooks to students in rural
areas. Malaysia and Rwanda are build¬
ing national libraries. Brazil is install¬
ing public libraries in all commu¬
nities. Dahomey, Ethiopia, Indonesia,
Kenya and Nepal are setting up natio¬
nal book development councils. Japan
and the Arab Republic of Egypt are
convening regional book development
conferences.
International Pen, the well-known
writers' organization, has launched a
programme for multi-national publica¬
tion of children's books. The Tokyo
Book Development Centre has start¬
ed a "reading materials project" involv¬
ing joint publication of books for chil¬
dren in Asian languages. More than a
score of countries are offering special
literary and translation prizes.
The French Government is present¬
ing six literary classics as a gift to
each couple who get married this year.
A foundation in the United States is
offering one million books for students
and libraries in Asia in 1972. The
Federal Republic of Germany is en¬
couraging the reading habit among
students by placing posters in every
classroom in the country.
The U.S.S.R. is convening a Unesco
symposium in Moscow on "Books in
the Service of Peace, Humanism and
Progress". Canada will hold a meeting
for the establishment of an Interna¬
tional Association of University Pres¬
ses. India, as part of national book
celebrations, has launched a nation¬
wide campaign for "books for the mil¬
lions".

BRADBURY, whose
science fiction predictions have often
proved uncannily accurate (one of his
characters was walking through a
park carrying a transistor many years
before that mini-radio was invented),
has given us the picture of a night¬
mare world in which a police state
passes sentence of death on books.
More recently, some sociologists,
humanists and technologists, interpret¬
ing certain statistics far removed from
the realm of science fiction and
literature, have also prophesied the
disappearance of books owing to the
large-scale development of modern
mass media.
There is nothing new in this ; every
age has been fearful of inventions and
technical innovations which might
endanger the survival of its existing
culture, without understanding that
such innovations were the products
of a continually evolving culture.
When the gramophone was invented,
it was said that the concert halls would
have to close; but the result was that
the works of great composers were
brought into the home and the gramo¬
phone thus helped to make music-
lovers of people who otherwise would
never have gone to a concert.
When the cinema became some¬
thing of a ritual meeting-place for
urban man, it was thought that this
would mean the end of the theatre;
but after nearly a century of this
"twentieth century art", the theatre has
developed along new lines, partly
by adopting cinematographic tech¬
niques which have also had an
influence on literature, as can be seen
in the novels of John Dos Passos.
Sound radio, after starting by
adapting literary works, created a new

(Continued from page 4)
the almost emotional overtone of much
of the reaction? After all, books have
existed for many hundreds of years.
International Years are enterprises so
vast in scope that they almost inevita¬
bly tend to be impersonal in character.
It is difficult to single out any one
reason. The overriding impression,
however, is that International Book
Year has evoked a latent feeling, far
more widespread and profound than
anyone ever realized, of the impor¬
tance of books. In a world in wh?:h
books have come to be taken for
granted, there is a sudden realization
of what reading could mean.
As' one legislator put it when h.s
country's Parliament proclaimed Inter¬
national Book Year: "Scarcely a lit¬
erate man or woman lives today who
cannot point to at least one book
which has influenced his life in some
way". This personal reaction is the
recurring theme in a host of state¬
ments ranging from newpaper edit¬
orials to messages from national
leaders. Monarchs, presidents, prime
ministers, ministers of education and
culture have noted the effects of read¬
ing on their own development.
The celebrations have a festive note.
Book fairs are being held in all con¬
tinents. Brightly illustrated book pos¬
ters adorn shop windows, kiosks and
libraries, and find an unaccustomed
place on public billboards. Special
commemorative stamps are being issu¬
ed in a sizeable number of countries,
while other countries are post-marking
all letters with IBY slogans. Postage
stamps and posters alike, no less than
book jackets, letter-heads, book mar¬
kers and shopping bags, are making
use of the IBY symbol: two jaunty
figures linking arms within bookcovers,
which has become the hallmark of
Book Year throughout the world.
International non-governmental org¬
anizations were Unesco's allies at the
planning stage of Book Year and this
link has been maintained by the crea¬
tion of an international Support Com¬
mittee made up of representatives of
authors, publishers, booksellers, libra¬
rians and documentalists. One of its
first activities was the adoption of a
statement setting forth in ten articles
the principles that should apply to
books. This Charter of the Book,
which has been placed on the agenda
of meetings all over the world, pro¬
mises to be one of the lasting accom¬
plishments of International Book Year.
1972 may indeed mark a turning
point in the long history of the book
by helping to translate into reality the
IBY slogan "Books for AN". If that hap¬
pens, it will be in large part because
1972 was "International Book Year
for All".
BOOK, DEAR FRIEND (Continued from page 5)

genre which the poet Dylan Thomas,
for Instance, used with great poetic
skill. Television was expected to harm
the cinema, but the relative decline
in film production is in no way com¬
mensurate with the extraordinary
increase in the number of television
sets throughout the world.
Tape recordings supplied the raw
material for the classic works of Oscar
Lewis on the culture of poverty, for
a Truman Capote novel and for some
sociological studies of the Cuban
writer Miguel Barnet. And it is not
too much to expect that with the
development of electronics poetry will
once again become the song which
it originally was by definition and
which printing and our civilization
transformed into a written text thus
obliging Mallarmé and other poets to
replace silences by large blank
spaces and the intonations of the
voice by different typographical
characters.
Fear for the future of books derives
from the fact that films, radio, tele¬
vision, comic strips and periodicals
take up most of one's leisure. But
there were always diversions of some
kind, differing according to class,
place and time sport, story-telling
round the fire, visits, card-playing,
games of chance, time spent at the
club.

Book and film call to mind the burning of such famous libraries as those of Padua, Ferrara,
Cordova, Amsterdam, Brussels and other more recent episodes in the long and sinister series
of book-burnings going back at least as far as 600 B.C., as these words from Maccabees I testify:
"They have destroyed the Book of the Law and have cast its leaves into the flames."

make books familiar to a wider public.
Consider how many novels whatever
their . quality have become world
bestsellers after the commercial
success of the film based on them.
Think of Kafka's The Trial, Emily
Bronte's Wuthering Heights, Paster¬
nak's Dr. Jivago, Norman Mailer's
The Naked and the Dead, and the
worldwide popularity of Shakespeare.
In France a television version of
Galsworthy's Forsyte Saga created a
demand for a paperback edition of
the work, and a series on surrealism
trebled the sales of works on that
movement. Many years ago, when
Orson Welles was still the enfant
terrible of Hollywood, his alarm¬
ingly imaginative radio adaptation
of The War of the Worlds pushed the
sales of works by his English near
namesake H. G. Wells up to the level
of daily newspaper circulation.
Despite gloomy predictions, there¬
fore, the fact remains that in 1970 alone
over half a million titles were publish¬
ed, most of them in Europe, the Soviet
Union and the United States pre¬
cisely where mass media, indicators
of economic and cultural development,
are most widely established. In Latin
America, however, barely 15,000 titles
were published in 1970, for a popu¬
lation of nearly 280 million.
Despite the aggravation of various
community problems and conflicts, our
age is no worse than previous ones.
In the last twenty years 800 million
persons have become literate, and for
them the book, once an inaccessible
object, is beginning to be the object of
veneration which it was originally In
any civilization.
The Jewish Torah, the Christian
Bible, the Moslem Koran, the Maya
Quiche Indian Popol Vuh, Book of
Chilam-Balam and Annals of the Cak-
chiqueles, were all unique objects for
handing down something sacred which
had to be conserved from generation
to generation.
Even today the book still has the
same function. The Egyptians who
strove tenaciously to protect their pap¬
yrus from damage by insect pests and
humidity were perhaps thinking of us,
just as the countries which generously
co-operated In the task of saving and
restoring documents damaged a few
years ago in the Florence floods were
thinking of the men of tomorrow.
A book was sacred both for its con¬
tent and as an object; a moral treatise
entitled "Table of Merits and De¬
merits" of the Yuan dynasty (1297-
1367) counts 5 minus points for throw¬
ing away a paper with writing on it
and 3 for reading a book with dirty
hands (causing the death of a human

being and offending the gods rated
1,000 minus points, and drinking to in¬
toxication, minus one).
Even without its religious content the
book is still a sacred object. The
older peasants of Paraguay still keep
their books in the corner of the room
alongside a statue of the Virgin.
Aldous Huxley has explained in "If My
Library Burned" the reasons why he
would repurchase the books which he
could not live without, and while each
of us would perhaps compile a differ¬
ent list, the attitude to the object
would still be the same.
Today, the burning or destruction of
books is the crime which, next to geno¬
cide perhaps, provokes the greatest
repugnance. But unfortunately, it was
only too common in the past. In the
year 213 B.C. the Emperor Ts'in Shi-
huaugti ordered the burning of all
wooden tablets the books of the time
to punish the writers who had criti¬
cized his policy or, according to
legend, so that people should speak
only of him and his two almost incred¬
ible deeds the destruction of books
and the construction of the Great Wall
of China. But some tablets were saved
and were surely the earliest clandes¬
tine literature, while the persons who
kept them were the first men to risk
their lives for a book.
The Medes destroyed the library of
Asurbanipal, the Christians the library
of Alexandria, King Edward the Sixth's
commissioners the famous Oxford Uni¬
versity library dating from the four¬
teenth century, the Reformation
brought the destruction of the monas¬
tic libraries, and the deplorable "autos
da fé" symbolized the Middle Ages
and the medieval mentality. "La Car¬
magnole" reminds us that the books of
Jean-Jacques Rousseau were burned,
and the Spanish colonial authorities
burned the "Declaration of the Rights
of Man and the Citizen".
But as it is impossible since the in¬
vention of printing to get rid of a book
completely, a more practical method
was to burn the authors. Luther ad¬
vised all town councillors to spare
neither effort nor expense in establish¬
ing good bookshops and libraries.
But Calvin had Michel Servet sent to
the stake. The Vatican libraries con¬
tained treasures of human knowledge,
but a Papal Council condemned Gior¬
dano Bruno and John Huss to the fire.
Today in many "underdeveloped-
countries which are carrying out litera¬
cy campaigns, the burning of books in
public has been replaced by small fires
in post offices and Customs houses
and by the confiscation of books in
private libraries. Excess of zeal on
the part of some officials ordered to
destroy all "red" literature they find
has led them in some cases to burn
Louis Baudln's Socialist Empire of the
Incas, Stephen Crane's Red Badge of
Courage and even Baroness Orczy's
Scarlet Pimpernel.
And Don Quixote's maidservant who
said that all the books in her master's
An engraving by Cornelis Woudhanus of the library of the famous
University of Leyden (Netherlands) in 1610. As in other librarías of
the day, books were chained to the shelves. At that time the Leyden
University library consisted of twenty-two bookcases of about 40
books each. The relative importance attached to the various disciplines
can be judged from the fact that there were six bookcases of
library should be burned, without ex¬
ception, since they were all to blame
for his lucid "madness", already fore¬
shadows the mother who blames books
in general for her son's revolt against
the consumer society which offers him
little indeed apart from the absolute
tyranny exerted by "things".
In essence, the publisher's function
is similar to that of the orchestra con¬
ductor or the theatrical producer: to
bring the individual creative work to
other people; but his range is even
greater than theirs. It may span the
oceans and the centuries. Horace
prided himself that his poems were
read from the coasts of the Black Sea
to the banks of the Rhone and the
Ebro; and today there are pocket edi¬
tions of the Vedas and the Uppanis-
hads which before the Second World
War were known in the West only
to somewhat esoteric societies in
England.
WiITH the advent of printing,
the .art of calligraphy, which has such
significance in Eastern cultures reli¬
gious significance in Persia, decorative
significance on a level with painting in
China where the name of the calligra-
phist is sometimes known when the
name of the author of the poem has
been forgotten was replaced by the
art of typography, and Gothic illumina¬
tion by woodcuts and etchings. Paint¬
ing and even architecture were drawn
into its field, bindings were decorated
with gold and silver and glass. Today
the "object-book" is beginning to be
turned into the "book-object", akin to
sculpture. The graphic arts have
reached full maturity and a special sec¬
tion of the New York Museum of
Modern Art is devoted to them.
Like all creations of the human spirit,
books were converted into merchan¬
dise almost from the outset. Egypt
carried on a trade in the Book of the
Dead (which had to accompany the
mummy on its journey to the shades);.
Xenophon refers in the Anabasis to
the book trade between Greece and its
colonies ; it is said that Alexander pre¬
sented Cleopatra with 200,000 manu¬
scripts from the library of Pergamum
and books were treasured by the
Romans as spoils of war. In the 16th
century, German pirate editions (pro¬
duced mainly at the expense of the
Danes) founded many a fortune.
Luxury collections have now estab¬
lished a category of privileged per¬
sons within an already privileged class.
The opulent customer asking for
"bound books" (not caring whether he
gets Testut's Anatomy or the memoirs
of some statesman) has his precursors
in the wealthy Romans who thought it
good tone to own a library, but who
were described by Seneca as being far
more ignorant than the slaves they
bought to copy the books.
Printing brought the written work to
a greater number of persons, but it
also meant that more people had an
opportunity to write books. Later this
grew Into an industry, involving the
calculation of costs, market prospects
and utility margins, and so it is pos¬
sible and indeed necessary for com-

theology, five of law, four of history, two each of philosophy,
literature and medicine, and one of mathematics and science. ' A
worldwide survey undertaken by Unesco (see page 12) shows that,
among books published today, literature holds first place, technology
and industry second place, and political science third, clear evidence
of the way our civilization has changed in the course of four centuries.

mercial interests to impose a work in
the same way as a brand of toothpaste.
The North American writer Saul Bel¬
low has said that it is possible to write
a good book on poverty in the United
States and become a millionaire to
say nothing of the publisher's profits.
Of course other books as harmful as
drugs or poison are also put on the
market (a book published in Germany
in 1925 caused the death of 40 million
people) and there are writers who have
far more talent for making money out
of seamy literature than for writing a
good book.
Certainly there have always been
good writers and bad writers. Sven
Dahl, in his History of the Book, rela¬
tes that it was customary for writers
to read their recent works to a group
of friends, as Herodotus did with his
historical works. But this practice de¬
generated Into a nuisance, as the
worst writers were also the most
anxious to seize any opportunity to
read their works.
The publishing industry, when back¬
ed by adequate publicity and prompt¬
ed solely by the desire to make money,
has contributed, together with the
other media, to a depreciation of lit¬
erature and has converted the dissem¬
ination of knowledge into a low-
grade popularization.
Being consumer oriented, it follows
the preferences of the "public". But
of course there is no single public,
merely readers who, as countless sur¬
veys show, choose a book because it
has been recommended by a critic or
a friend, because of the author's name,
or because of its title or its cover.
The diversity of public "taste" is
reflected in the world statistics of the
authors and works most translated in
1969: Lenin, Jules Verne, Shakespeare
and Simenon (the first victory of Mai¬
gret over James Bond).
The Assyrians made roads or floors
with clay tablets whose contents were
no longer of interest; nowadays the
housewife uses out-of-date or trashy
publications to wedge an unsteady
table or to light a fire. But when we
see, in the "Third World" countries, a
saleswoman reading a romance or a
liftboy with a Western, we feel they
have at least taken the first step and
that perhaps they may manage to take
the second from liking reading to
seeking good books.
I HE terms "daily", or
"weekly", which refer to the frequency
of publication, also indicate how long
the interest lasts; such publications
provide news and news changes even
before the ink on them has dried.
The medium is not the message, but
it determines its duration. A couple
carving the symbol of their love on a
tree (the Greek and Latin words
byblos and liber meaning "book",
something lasting, originally meant
tree-bark) are not only, like the writer,
obeying the impulse to communicate
something to other people, but also
sharing his secret longing that it should
last forever. On the other hand, the au¬
thor of "graffiti" on city walls knows
that the slogan will pass from mouth
to mouth and may endure, even though
the writing and symbols are effaced
within the day.
It is not the new media which threaten
the life of the book, but the use made
of them. Some modern European re¬
views are the equivalent of books of
essays. Stories in pictures were known
in Mexico before the arrival of the
Spaniards; in China they are used
for recounting the lives of heroes
and in Ecuador they have been used
for teaching national history.
If the danger lay in the media them¬
selves, planned societies would have
managed to limit their growth and
Influence. For there is no doubt that
while the cinema, radio, press and tele¬
vision are not Culture neither are
books they nevertheless are part of
culture.
It is not just by chance that the big¬
gest libraries in the world are in Wash¬
ington, London, Moscow and Paris.
Nor is it mere chance that in the thea¬
tres of the Soviet Union books are
sold where in Western theatres ices
and sweets are the rule; that it is prac¬
tically Impossible to find a passenger
in an English train who is not reading;
and that nearly all works' committees
¡n French industry run a library.
Unesco's intention in proclaiming
1972 International Book Year is not to
save the book's life: its objective is
clearly expressed in the theme of the
campaign: "Books for AN". For as
all the institutions taking part ¡n this
crusade realize, ¡t is not that the hab¬
it of reading is going to disappear but
that it has not yet become to many

peoples of the world a daily need that
must be satisfied.
That is due to illiteracy, to the lack
of funds for buying books, to the dis¬
like of reading instilled in many
schools which still retain a mania for
chronological teaching and force
youngsters to begin by reading the
Iliad, the Odyssey, the Divine Comedy
or the Aeneid. For if the definition of
a classic as "the mature work of a
mature age" holds for the author, it
also applies to the reader.
The cultural leaders of certain so¬
cieties aspire to the marvellous utopia
of making every factory or farm wor¬
ker an artist, a writer or a scholar;
at the opposite pole of historical dev¬
elopment the aim is that everyone
should read what others have written.
In Cuba, since 1959 and following a
nation-wide literacy campaign under
the slogan "We do not tell the people
to believe, but to read", the Nation¬
al Institute of the Book has produced
an average of 13i million copies of
books each year for a population of
8è million. Yet in my country, Ecua¬
dor, barefoot boys pay 20 cents to
read old dog-eared magazines in a
yard used as a "reading room".
Technological progress will bring
easier access to books and they will
take up less space, but they will still
be "writing", in the form of microfilms,
micro-size books or microfiches.
But what if the book were to disap¬
pear after five thousand years of his¬
tory, and ¡f the dreadful vision of
Bradbury's inhuman mechanized world
were to come true. This would hap¬
pen if we had ceased to deserve that
object to which we can always turn,
which transports us to other places
and other times and introduces us to
extraordinary beings whom we would
otherwise never have known, ideas
which we should never have discover¬
ed for ourselves; to the dictionary
whose pages we turn eagerly plung¬
ing into the intriguing labyrinth of lan¬
guage that "work of art" which we
would never lend to anyone, in whose
margins we do not dare to scribble
notes, that book which in our youth
cost us three weeks'walking to school
or for which we gave up two visits to
the cinema or even went without cig¬
arettes.
If that day comes, we shall surely
hear a voice on the public loud¬
speakers intoning "E = mc2". But
knowing the human spirit and its ten¬
acious striving for freedom and cul¬
ture, there will undoubtedly be under¬
ground radio stations which will con¬
tinue to proclaim from somewhere or
other, at least as an oral tradition, the
thoughts of the great writers of the
"past": "Life is a tale told by an
idiot, full 'of sound and fury, signifying
nothing", or "Happiness is the belat¬
ed realization of a prehistoric longing;
that is why wealth brings so little hap¬
piness: money is not a childhood
desire", or perhaps even more aptly:
"Until now we have lived only the pre¬
history of man." :

Medieval birch bark manuscripts unearthed in the Soviet Union
are one of the most important archaeological finds of recent years.
The first document came to light In 1951, at Novgorod, Russia's most
ancient city (100 miles south of Leningrad). Since then more than
500 other specimens, dating from the 11th to the 15th century, have
been recovered from archaeological sites. The first known book written
on birch bark (above) was found at Novgorod in 1963. A 13th cen¬
tury prayer book, it consists of three double leaves. In medieval
Russia, birch bark was the least costly writing material and was
still in use more than a century after the appearance of paper. The
high moisture content of Novgorod's soil preserved the bark on
which writing had been cut or scratched with a sharp instrument.
Ink would have been destroyed by the moisture. The birch bark
writings relate mostly to personal matters, and thus throw new light
on many aspects of medieval life not mentioned in official chronicles.
Top left, Soviet archaeologist examines one of the Novgorod bark
fragments. He has adopted the typical beard and hair-style of medi¬
eval Novgorod. Archaeologists have managed to decipher fragments
of the old Slavonic script on the birch bark document at top of page.
They read: "...for a while to Moses. Come and help... though you
lose... my being in this. At home meanwhile...". Left, excavations
at the site of an ancient market in Novgorod where a 15th century
bark manuscript of the Psalms of David written in Latin was found
in 1971. Prof. Valentin Yanin, Assistant Director of the Novgorod
Archaeological Expedition, hopes that the search for bark manuscripts
will soon extend to other northern European countries where birch
bark writing was also mentioned by medieval chroniclers.

A Unesco inquiry
THE BOOKS
PEOPLE READ
by Edward Wegman
IN 1970, every minute of
every day, a book was published
somewhere in the world: 546,000 titles
in all, double the output of 20 years
earlier.
Four out of five of the titles come
from a handful of nations. Europe
alone ¡s responsible for almost half
the world's production. If the output
of Japan, the United States and the
U.S.S.R. is added, you have virtually
eighty per cent of all the titles
Issued in any one year. The rest of
the world, two-thirds of humanity, thus
has comparatively little say in the
books that are available for reading.
For the most part, ¡t ¡s a foreign
publisher who makes the decision
regarding their needs and tastes.
What do people read? More often
than not, they read the books that are
readily available, and when the books
they want are not there, they sometimes
do not read at all. It is therefore
apparent that the kind of books
produced is as vital as the mere pro¬
duction of more and more books.
Subject matter has equal, or perhaps
even greater importance in meeting
the world's hunger for reading
materials.
Since books are published to be
read, an examination of the titles
selected for publication can offer an
insight into the subjects which national
publishers believe will interest their
readers. This information is available
through the answers Unesco's Member
12 EDWARD WEGMAN is Head of Unesco's
International Book Year Unit. A former
journalist (New York Times, AP. UPI) and
radio commentator, he was promotion man¬
ager of a book distributing firm before join¬
ing Unesco.
States supply to Unesco annually in
response to questionnaires on the
quantities and subject matter of books
produced. The most recent data,
relating to 1970, are contained in the
latest Unesco Statistical Yearbook (to
be published ¡n October 1972).
The Unesco questionnaire classifies
the subjects of books in 23 categories.
There is no separate classification for
textbooks, which in most cases are
included in the main subject-headings;
i.e. a geography textbook would be
found under "Geography, travel", while
an arithmetic book would be under
"Mathematics".
The most popular subject among
the world's book producers is litera¬
ture, which includes not only fiction
and poetry but also literary criticism.
More than fourteen per cent of all the
books and pamphlets issued in 1970
were concerned with literature. That
was almost double the number
published ¡n the second most popular
category, Industries. In third place
come publications in Political Science.
There is a decided drop in numbers
before we come to the next subjects,
Natural Sciences, Education, History
and Biography, Law and Arts.
Eight of the ten most important book
producers are on the list of those who
put literature first (in order of
importance as producers): United
States, Federal Republic of Ger¬
many, United Kingdom, Japan, Fran¬
ce, Spain, India and the Netherlands.
The two other major producers:
U.S.S.R. and Poland place books on
industry at the top of their production.
Although ¡n the second rank of pro¬
ducers, Mexico, one of the largest
publishers in Latin America, also puts
Industries in first place.
The countries most interested in
legal affairs are Botswana, Ceylon,
Chile, Hong Kong, Luxembourg, Peru
and Turkey, while Jamaica produces
equal numbers of titles on law and on
political science. This last subject is
the first choice of Bolivia and Ireland.
Religious books hold pride of place in
Ghana, Lebanon, Madagascar, and
Mauritius, while they share first place
with education in Kenya. Thailand
produces more books on education
than on any other subject; Jordan and
Tanzania prefer mathematics; Cam¬
eroon, Panama and Kuwait give first,
place to generalities (which Includes
government publications) while New
Zealand publishers favour agriculture.
One quarter of the books and
pamphlets published by Qatar deal
with linguistics, which also occupies
first place in Malaysia.
more detailed look at the
production of individual states is even
more enlightening. Taking the largest
and the smallest producers in each
region, one quickly runs into striking
differences in emphasis.
Of the 23 countries that participated
in the Unesco meeting of experts on
book development in Africa, at Accra
(Ghana) in 1968, only six have present¬
ed the detailed reports on which this
analysis ¡s based. While earlier data
showed that ¡n 1969 Nigeria was by
far the largest producer, Kenya had
in 1970 the most important output
among those who answered the
Unesco questionnaire. Nigeria's pro¬
duction in 1969 was over 1,000 titles,
while Kenya's was only one-tenth of
that figure. In all cases in Africa, the

number of titles was comparatively
small, corresponding to. the con¬
clusions of the Accra meeting that a
virtual book famine existed ¡n the
continent.
Kenya published 43 books and
pamphlets on religion and theology
and another 43 on education. It is
perhaps significant that throughout
English-speaking Africa, missionary
societies were among the first to install
local publishing houses, which might
account for the important place
assigned to religion.
Following well behind these subjects
come games and sports, in a country
that has a certain world reputation for
its runners: 20 titles issued. Next
come history and biography (16 titles)
and then political science (8), both
subjects of major interest to newly-
independent nations. Literature also
was picked 8 times by Kenyan pub¬
lishers, while natural sciences drew
6 titles. As indicative as the titles
selected are those in which nothing
was published: philosophy, trade,
ethnography, linguistics, commercial
techniques and arts.
Among the smallest African book
producers is Botswana. Almost half
of the 20 titles published in that
country dealt with law: four books and
four pamphlets. Four pamphlets were
concerned with generalities, while one
book and one pamphlet dealt with
political science. Geography also
drew two titles, as did agriculture.
History, biography .and commercial
techniques each resulted in one title.
While a certain amount of the book
production in both countries cited as
examples for Africa is in local lan¬
guages, a decided influence on pro
duction is undoubtedly the fact that
much of education is in English. As
a result, book Imports meet many of
their primary needs.
A somewhat similar situation exists
in French-speaking Africa, where Mad¬
agascar was one of the most prolific
publishers, with 158 titles. Religion
and theology accounted for 33 titles,
while second place went to literature,
with 31. This was followed by
political science, education and agri¬
culture.
Interest in ethnography and folklore
was comparatively high, since books
on this subject share sixth place with
publications on law. Once again, as
is the case in English-speaking Africa,
the principal textbook needs, as well
as demand for general reading
material, are met by imports.
* 1VE of the Arab States
have sent in information on book
production in 1970, according to the
Unesco recommendation. While Egypt
producted 1,872 titles ¡n 1969, the
answers to Unesco's questionnaire on
production in 1970 do not contain
statistics for that country.
In 1970, of the 594 titles published
in Lebanon, the second most important
producer in 1969, 135 dealt with
religious or theological themes.
Qatar, the smallest producer in the
region, published 99 books on 14 sub¬
jects in 1970 (see article page 22).
Asia, despite an over-all situation of
book hunger, contains two of the
giants of the publishing world: Japan,
which issued 31,249 titles in 1970, and
India, which published 14,141. There
are a number of similarities' in their
production, as well as significant dif¬
ferences. For example, both put litera¬
ture at the head of their list, and both
assign political science to second
place. In Japan, however, books on
the arts run on the heels of political
science: 2,186 titles to 2,752. In India,
not surprisingly, third place goes to
books on religion and theology, which
are far behind political science (942 to
2,717).
At the other end of the publishing
scale i.n Asia is the island State of
Singapore with 520 books and pam¬
phlets issued in 1970. While literature
is in first place, linguistics follows
closely (68 to 78 titles) which is not
surprising for a country which has
Malay, Chinese and English-speaking
populations. Natural sciences draw
the next largest group of publications
with forty-five titles, while religion was
selected forty-three times and geo¬
graphy forty. Ethnography and folklore
share last place with philosophy: three
titles each.
While book shortages exist in Latin
America, the situation is somewhat
different from the regions previously
mentioned. The problem, speaking
generally, is not so much one of
producing enough books for the region
as it ¡s of developing internal ex¬
changes that can relieve the Latin
American nations of their dependency
upon imported works.
That having being said, it becomes
apparent once one begins to look
.at the individual publication stat¬
istics of the countries of Latin Amer¬
ica that there are some, such as
Mexico and Argentina, which are
highly active publishers, others which
come close to meeting their minimal

needs and finally, a number particu¬
larly those that are geographically
small which are unable to support
economically a functioning publishing
industry. For that reason, the Unesco
meeting at Bogota in 1969 called for
major emphasis on efforts to make
available to each of the countries the
books published by the other countries
of the region.
Of the countries that participated in
the Bogota meeting, Mexico ¡s the
dominant publisher among those who
have reported their 1970 statistics
according to the Unesco recommen¬
dations, although 1969 data showed
that Brazil, with almost 6,400 titles, was
then the most important book pro¬
ducer, with Argentina in second place.
Mexico published some 5,000 titles
in 1970, of which 857 were concerned
with industry. One can almost see in
all the book statistics of this country
the concentration on development.
Medical science was in second place
with 401 titles, while third place was
devoted to education. Law books and
political science follow, with just under
300 titles each, and then commercial
techniques. Literature, history and bio¬
graphy, and the arts are next in popu¬
larity. As in most of the developing
countries, suggestions for the house¬
wife, incorporated under the heading of
domestic science, come last.
The English-speaking island of
Jamaica is at the bottom of the Latin
American list. In view of its limited
population, its production of 159 books
and pamphlets is a not inconsiderable
achievement. First place is shared by
law and political science with 21 titles
each, followed by history and bio¬
graphy with 13. Literature, philosophy
and commercial techniques make
uneasy bedfellows in next place with
12 titles each. Perhaps even more
interesting are the categories which
are not represented no books were
published on philosophy, psychology,
linguistics, philology, or mathematics.
Among the other countries in the
world, the production of the United
States, of the United Kingdom and of
the U.S.S.R. are among the most im¬
portant. The statistics from the United
States are somewhat difficult to eval¬
uate since the subject matter break¬
down is confined to non-governmen¬
tal publications, which amount to just
about one half the total output of
titles.
These tend to follow more or
less the pattern of the other ad¬
vanced publishing countries of Europe,
with first place reserved to literature
(8,246) followed by political science
(3,121) and then history and biography,
religion, natural sciences, socio¬
logy, geography, medical scien¬
ces and philosophy and psychology.
Education comes in eleventh place,
with some 1,273 titles. Books on
industry are in twelfth position. From
then on, the number of titles dips

below the 1,000 mark. Agriculture,
trade and transport are at the bottom
of the list.
In the United Kingdom, literature is
again in the lead, with almost
9,000 titles out of a total production
of 33,441. History and biography are
in second place, with almost the same
number of titles as political science:
just under 3,000. Next on the list is
natural science. The arts are in a
surprisingly strong fifth position, with
almost 2,000 titles. At the other end
of the scale, the least popular titles
are agriculture, domestic science,
trade and transport, military art and
ethnography and folklore in that order.
The production of France is very
similar to that of the United States
and United Kingdom, as is the selec¬
tion of subjects in the Federal Repub¬
lic of Germany, although in the latter
country, education is in second place.
The Soviet Union publishes almost
as many titles as does the United
States with 78,899 as opposed to
79,530. The choice of subjects is quite
different. Two out of every seven
books deal with industry. The next
most important subject, with one out
of seven titles, is political science.
Literature is an important third, with
almost eight thousand titles. Then
come natural sciences, commercial
techniques, agriculture, medical scien¬
ces, education and generalities. This
is followed by linguistics. The least
popular title is ethnography, in which
no books were published. There were
170 works of religion, 375 in domestic
science and 548 in geography and
travel.
There are a number of differences
between the Soviet Union and Poland,
although both put industry ¡n first
place. Poland follows that subject
very closely with literature and then
political science. At 'the bottom of
the ladder are trade and transport,
philosophy and psychology, games
and sports, domestic science, with
ethnography and folklore again bring¬
ing up the rear.
In Oceania, Australia ¡s a medium-
sized publishing country. In 1970, it
published some 5,000 books and
pamphlets. While it is a developed
nation, it is gradually shifting from
largely agricultural production toward
industrialization. The most popular
subject for publication is literature,
which occupies one tenth of its annual
book production. In second place are
books on industry, while third place
is shared by political science and law.
Suprisingly for a country noted for its
athletes, only 55 titles were concerned
with games and sports.
What does all this prove? Perhaps
nothing. And yet a social scientist
wrote recently: "You can't always tell
a book by its cover, but you can almost
always tell a person by his books."
What is true for individuals, may well
be true also for nations.

A Tunisian school experiment
NEW WAYS
TO PROMOTE
READING
Reading habits are often
made or marred in the class¬
room. Specialists at the Ins¬
titute of Educational Sci¬
ences in Tunis have recently
developed reading motiva¬
tion techniques for Tunisian
schools, designed not only
to build a lifetime reading
habit, but also to improve
the way childen express
themselves orally and on
paper. Right, a general view
of Tunis; in the foreground,

^kDULTS nowadays seem to
be outspokenly critical of the way young
people express themselves. Modern
youth, in their view, are inarticulate,
hesitant, even tongue-tied, and adults
regard this ¡nartlculacy as a reflection
of the superficial lives they lead. In
their noisy demonstrations, ¡n their
songs and music, in their art and mod
expressions, it is the catch-phrase,
the cliché, the chanted slogan and the
short-lived idea which predominate.
Educators, for their part, seem to
have found only one explanation for
this decline in the level of expression:
a disinclination on the part of young
people to read.
Should we regard this an inevitable
malady of our time? Are we to hold
the mass media solely responsible
for this decline in the level of
expression among young people?
This would be too simple an explan¬
ation. Nor should we try to explain
away the opinion of adults concerning
modern youth as just another aspect
of the generation gap. It would,
perhaps, be more realistic to argue
CHADLY FITOURI is the founder of the
Institute of Educational Sciences In Tunis.
Professor at the Faculty of Letters of Tunis
University, he has written a number of stu¬
dies in Arabic and French on educational
problems in Tunisia, and has served as an
educational consultant to Unesco on several
occasions. Since 1971, he has been head
of the Division of Documentation, Studies
and Research at Unesco's International
Bureau of Education in Geneva.
that the deterioration in the ability of
young people to express themselves
is due to a general lowering in the
standard of education.
The fact is that when adults compare
the schoolchildren of their own
generation to those of today, they
apparently forget that in many coun¬
tries, yesterday's schools, and the
schools of the day before yesterday,
were much more selective than they
are now. Today the majority of pupils
are drawn from the most under¬
privileged social strata in which the
only cultural tradition is an oral "folk"
tradition.
To say that children from an under¬
privileged environment do not like
reading is therefore in no way a value
judgement, but rather a simple state¬
ment of fact.. If they do not read, if
they do not like reading, it is because
their background has never given them
any encouragement to read.
A survey carried out in Tunisia in
1967-68, for example, showed that
school libraries were either excessively
poor (even non-existent in newly
opened lycées) or useless because
the books they contained had not
been selected according to any logical
pedagogical or educational criteria.
Far from counter-balancing the short¬
comings of the pupils' social back¬
ground, schools seem generally to
aggravate them by making reading part
of the syllabus. Pupils and teachers
alike find the bi-weekly "séance de
lecture", or reading period, restrictive,
artificial and boring.
Yet facility of expression can only
be acquired through examination of
models found in written works. Becom¬
ing acquainted with the works of worth¬
while authors offers an opportunity of
experiencing many facets of the human
adventure; but more than this, on
every page the reader can see how
a skilled writer manipulates words and
builds up phrases to express emotions
or ideas in such a way that not only
is the emotion or idea made clear but
is also endowed with greater depth
and intensity.
Once reading becomes a habit, fami¬
liarity with the works of an author
leads to the participation-reading that
Henry Miller had in mind when he said
that everyone hopes when picking up
a book to meet a man after his own
heart, to experience tragedies and joys
we are too timid to elicit ourselves, to
dream dreams which make life more
enthralling and perhaps to discover a
philosophy of life which will make us
more capable of facing the trials and
problems that beset us. Participation
such as this is never passive.
Adolescence is the age of romanti¬
cism and enthusiasm; it is also, above
all, the time for reading. Few cultivat¬
ed adults fail to retain a vivid recol¬
lection of what they read during adol¬
escence; an individual's career, even
his whole personality, is often largely
determined by his reading during this
period of his life.

At a time when the human element
in daily life is being eroded, it is to
be regretted that the school, whose
basic task is to help children to
develop their full human potential for
learning and living, still overlooks the
riches that intelligent reading has to
offer and the meeting point it provides
for ieacher, pupil and author.
Reading is only a means to an end,
and in devising techniques for motivat¬
ing pupils towards reading we were
guided by three key questions:
Why should we read? What should
we read? How should we read?
Our Reading Motivation Project in
Tunisia grew out of considerations
such as these. Might it not be pos
sible, we asked ourselves, to use those
same audio-visual media that are said
to discourage young people from read¬
ing to stimulate a need for reading
among pupils? In other words, on the
basis of something towards which
young people are strongly motivated,
could we not motivate them towards
other activities and in particular
towards the reading of good literature?
This was the first step.
The second stage was to make use
of the same media to stimulate reflec¬
tion, research, discussion and exchan¬
ge of ideas among young people about
what they had read, thus enabling them
to discover for themselves new hori¬
zons in reading.
In 1968, we decided to submit this
working hypothesis to the education
authorities in Tunisia, the school In¬
spectors and pedagogic advisers, and
to define the educational problem
more precisely we based our recom¬
mendations on the three questions
mentioned above.
WHY READ? Recommending a
course of reading does not necessarily
mean that the pupils will follow it,
whether the recommendation is in the
form of an order or just friendly advice.
Even the threat of examinations gives
no guarantee. We therefore decided
that we would have to break with school
tradition so as to make the pupil feel
that he himself had made the choice

For the
eager eyes
of children
In an introduction to a special issue of the Swiss magazine "Graphis", entirely
devoted to children's book illustration, the artist-illustrator Henri Steiner of
Zurich describes some of the difficulties of this form of graphic art. "Why is it",
he writes in English, "that a child likes one book and leaves another lying around
unread or un-looked-at? Is it the story it tells? Is it the colours, the drawings,
the nice shape or design? Is there perhaps even a secret here? We illustrators,
at any rate, know that there is no means of knowing. There is no recipe for making
a successful children's book, no rules that you can feel safe in sticking to. . .
When a picture turns out a success and lies before us on the table or desk, looking
at us, we hardly know how it happened and how it came to have eyes. Just as
if even though aided by the skill of our hands it had come alive all by itself,
expressed itself in visible form, had joined us from a land that we know very well
and have known since our childhood, but a world that can only be seen in pictures,
and nowhere else. Children feel that. It is the land in which they still feel wholly
at home, the " children of three years old and upwards." Left, the cover of this spe¬

NEW WAYS TO PROMOTE READING
(Continued from page 17)
A statuette from Tanzania symbolizing the opening-up of the world of
books to the peoples of Africa. It was given to Unesco's Director-
General, Mr René Maheu, by students of the Girls Secondary School
at Tabora, Tanzania, who received the first Mohammed Reza Pahlavi
Literacy Prize, in 1967, for their work as volunteer literacy teachers.

and was impelled by a genuine, per¬
sonal need to read a particular work.
Assuming the worst possible start¬
ing-point the weak, lazy pupil who had
never read a book of 150-200 pages
to the end we worked out the follow¬
ing method.
The exercise should be as far remov¬
ed as possible from the traditional
school background. We would have
liked it to be carried out completely
away from the school, but had to
abandon this idea for lack of facilities.
In the end we decided to work in a
classroom, but to change its physical
layout by replacing school desks with
stools and chairs which could be mov¬
ed around as required. The room was
also equipped with display panels, a
projector, a portable screen and a
tape-recorder.
Attendance at the sessions was en¬
tirely voluntary. The only stipulation
was that the pupils should be of the
same educational level and therefore
of more or less the same age. The
reading motivation sessions were held
outside school hours and lasted as
long as the majority of the group
wished. The groups were not allowed
to exceed 25 to 30 pupils.
WHAT TO READ? We began by
setting up a small committee to choose
a level of presentation (in this case for
a third-year secondary class) and a
book title. We had to adopt this
makeshift solution because no Inves¬
tigation had ever been carried out in
Tunisia into the real reading interests
of schoolchildren. Later, as we carried
out more experiments, using books
such as The Diary of Anne Frank, we
began to discover for ourselves what
the pupils were interested in.
The Institute of Educational Studies
¡n Tunis has since made several sur¬
veys on reading among schoolchildren
and has used the findings as a guide
in selecting titles for children to read.
For it is this choice that not only
gives children a real motivation to read
but also determines their whole intel¬
lectual, moral and social make-up.
HOW TO READ? Henry Miller has
rightly pointed out that a book, like
anything else, is often used as a
pretext to conceal what we are really
in search of. Reading may thus be
merely a form of recreation (maga¬
zines and detective stories), or a
source of quickly assimilated inform¬
ation (newspapers and popularized
texts relating to one's work) or an
opportunity for learning, self-education
and logical reasoning.
All the activities devised for the

Classical music to guide the reader along
Reading Motivation Techniques project
relate to the last type of reading.
A complete session comprises two
phases at intervals of one or two
weeks so that pupils have time to read
the book proposed to them.
After choosing the book we begin
to make what we call a selection and
a montage. Selection consists in pick¬
ing out the key passages, the passages
that are outstanding in style and con¬
tent and passages to which children
of the age and educational level we
are dealing with will be most receptive.
We then make a sound montage
from tape recordings of the voices of
several men and women reading pas¬
sages from the book, though not
necessarily ¡n the order in which the
passages occur in the book. The
sound montage is used simply to
create an ambiance which stimulates
interest without revealing the sub¬
stance of the work. To present a
summary of the book would be a con¬
tradiction of the aims we set at the
start of the project. Our purpose is
merely to whet the listener's appetite.
We decided that the sound montage
would be more effective if we linked
the spoken passages with short pieces
of classical music appropriate to the
theme of the book, and that this would
also help children to understand the
text. Since music can convey certain
feelings and emotions, it may reveal
things which a child of low linguistic
ability would not grasp as quickly from
a written text.
Our pupils, of course, are bilingual
(Arabic and French). They begin learn¬
ing French in the third year of primary
school, and their level of expression
is equally low in French and Arabic.
Our Reading Motivation Techniques
project thus comprises reading in both
' languages. The special report on the
project which the Institute of Educ¬
ational Sciences plans to publish, will
Include a complete list of the authors
and works in Arabic and French used
in the experiments and data on the
pedagogical and audio-visual kits that
were compiled.
We also use visual aids such as
display boards and slides to introduce
and enhance the effect of the sound
montage. Boards are used to display
photographs of the author and his life,
illustrations from the book and copies
of the book itself.
As a session opens, a group leader
(usually a member of the Institute of
Educational Sciences or a teacher
trained by the Institute) welcomes the
children and suggests that they inspect
the displays. He then gives a brief
Introduction, lasting about five minutes,
when he presents the" book (title,
number of pages etc.) and a number
of slides picturing the author are
shown. After this, the tape recording
montage is played.
During the 25 or 30 minutes that
the tape is played, other slides are
shown to stimulate additional interest.
In the session dealing with the book
Poll de Carotte (Carrots), [a bitterly
ironical account by the French writer
Jules Renard of his own childhood
Editor] we projected a picture of
a teenager in an attitude of defiance
while the children were listening to an
extract from the last chapter entitled
"Revolt".
After the recording, the group leader
uses the question and answer tech¬
nique to set off a discussion among
the children. He sees to it that the
discussion does not reveal the content
of the book, but helps to increase the
children's eagerness to read it for
themselves. As this first phase ends,
the children are told that they can take
away a copy of the book if they wish,
and a date is fixed for a discussion of
its key themes with the group leader.
I HE second phase takes
place a week or two later. This time,
it is the children who run the discus¬
sion, after electing a chairman, a
secretary and several observers. As
the experiment proceeds, the part
played by the group leader steadily
diminishes in importance, as the
children learn to abide by the rules
of self discipline, democracy and
responsibility.
During the sessions dealing with
Poil de Carotte and The Diary of Anne
Frank, for instance, children spon¬
taneously formed groups to undertake
studies and surveys of problems relat¬
ing to adolescence, war and peace,
co-education, marriage, divorce,
money, keeping a diary, etc. In this
way, reading becomes an "adventure".
The children themselves decide how
long a discussion should last. These
discussions and study groups offer
bilingual children (who are chiefly from
Arabic-speaking homes) an excellent
opportunity to practice spoken and
written French.
But perhaps the most significant
prospect opened up by the project is
through the discussions and studies
that- create new reading needs and
direct children towards the choice of
new books. In this way, one act of
reading begets another, and each book
becomes a starting "point for studies,
lively discussions, new contacts and
creative activities.
I recall one discussion among fifth-
year primary children that I attended.
It dealt with an extract from Victor
Hugo's Les Misérables (the sad story
of "Cosette"). It sparked off a keen
and continuous discussion lasting for
an hour and a half, between children
who had been taught French for less
than two years. . It showed that when
children aged ten or eleven have
sufficient motivation, they can not only
remain attentive for more than an hour,
but also express themselves in a
language which they have only just
learned to speak.
Reading books also inspires some
children to use painting as a means
of expression in order to portray one
or another of the characters or situa¬
tions as these have impressed them
in the course of their reading or dis¬
cussions. Many such paintings have
been added to the visual kits and have
enriched the display panels to the
benefit of other children.
We feel we have gone a long way
from the tedious setting and dreary
ambiance (well remembered from our
own youth and, unhappily, still too
familiar to many present-day children) ,
which mark the "reading to order" and
"book reports" of official syllabuses.
The kind of motivation for reading
we have described enables teaching
programmes to be adapted to lively
and effective teaching methods, in¬
stead of the other way round, as is
still too often the case.

RENAISSANCE
OF ARAB THOUGHT
AND LITERATURE
by Philippe Ouannès
I HE Arab world today num¬
bers some 130 million men and wo¬
men, the great majority of whom speak
.the same language, share the same
religious practices and have the same
traditions. Books hold a central place
in Arab culture; Islam in fact started
with a book, the Koran, which in Ara¬
bic originally meant "recitation" but
has now come to mean "reading".
From the shores of the Atlantic to the
Persian Gulf stretches one of the rare
geographical areas of the world ¡n
which linguistic unity and the same
culture and religion make it possible
for almost all the inhabitants to un¬
derstand each other without difficulty.
Arab civilization flowed through the
civilizations of the Mediterranean and
the west, making an original contribu¬
tion to their development and stimulat¬
ing a wealth of literary and scientific
creation. From the 8th century on¬
wards literature of every kind, from
poetry to astronomy, spread through¬
out the entire Arab-Islamic world from
the Indus to the Pyrenees. Over and
above the honoured names which are
the pride of Arabic literary tradition,
mention should be made of those en¬
quiring scholars, both famous and
anonymous, who "went in search of
science" and spread the inventions
and literature of eastern cultures
throughout the world.
It was through the Arabs, their books
and their translations that the world,
particularly the west, became ac¬
quainted with Greek philosophy and
cosmology, the compass, the invention
of paper in China, Arabic numerals,
etc.
But for the influence of the Anda-

and former professor of sociology and Arab
literature at the University of Paris (Vlncen-
nes), is assistant editor of the French edition
of the Unesco Courier.
lusian Arab civilization and its poets,
such as Ibn Hazm (the author of "The
Ring of the Dove"), medieval Europe
would not have had the same concep¬
tion of courtly love and would not have
explored Its themes and myths in
works such as "Tristan and Iseult".
Writers such as Ibn Muqaffa (author
of Kalilah wa Dimnah), Avicenna and
Ibn Khaldun for the humanities and
scholars such as Khwarizmi, Blruni,
Rhazes and Farabi for the natural
sciences, helped spread or presided
over the creation of works, scientific
theories and discoveries which were
disseminated through books and
manuscripts circulating to the ends of
the Arab Empire and as far as Europe.
It is not the purpose of this article
to draw up a balance-sheet of the cul¬
tural heritage or the rôle of the Arab
world in the flowering of the different
civilizations of the Middle Ages.
Nevertheless this role, and its accom¬
panying traditions, made their imprint
and have left behind social and cul¬
tural features that continue to find ex¬
pression in a vigorous intellectual life
and in works by writers known the
world over, such as Taha Hussein of
Egypt, for example.
But these writers and scholars are
seriously handicapped by the various
problems now posed by book devel¬
opment and production.
Arabic literature in fact does not
occupy its rightful cultural and linguis¬
tic place in the world today for a num¬
ber of reasons. In order to analyse
and find answers to these problems,
the governments of the countries con¬
cerned decided to work out, with
Unesco's assistance, a common policy
for book production in Arab countries.
The work of co-ordinating this policy
was completed by a Unesco-sponsored
conference held in Cairo in May 1972,
attended by experts and representa¬
tives from 15 Arab countries. The
conference agreed to the setting up of
a regional book development centre
in Cairo which would play a decisive
part in formulating a policy for books
and printed matter and in speeding up
their circulation throughout the entire
Arabic-speaking world.
This task is made easier by the
long-established intellectual tradition
of the Arab-Islamic world, the con¬
venience of a common language and
above all, recent massive school enrol¬
ment campaigns. The promotion of
book development will also take into
account the special problems of writing
and book production, and will be based
on a detailed and realistic analysis of
present-day conditions.
*r\ preliminary assessment
based on statistics collected by
Unesco gives a total production in the
Arab world of some, 5,000 titles a
year, or about 1 per cent of world
production, which in 1969 was in the
neighbourhood of 500,000 titles.
Estimates by Dr. M. I. Shoush, Chair¬
man and Director of Khartoum Univer¬
sity Press (Sudan), put the total num¬
ber of copies of school textbooks pro¬
duced ¡n the Arab world at roughly
50,000 per title, as against 3,000 to
5,000 copies per title of books for
general reading. According to another
specialist, Mr. S. Mahmud Shenitl,
Egyptian Under-Secretary of State for
Culture, more copies are printed of
novels, particularly popular tales in
serial form, religious works and best¬
sellers. It would thus not be unreason¬
able to estimate an average of 10,000
copies per title, an overall yearly pro¬
duction of some 50,000 million copies.
This average of 10,000 copies per
title is, of course, considerably
exceeded by certain books such as
the Egyptian author Nagib Mahfuz's
famous Trilogy, each book of which

bears the name of a district of Cairo,
and which traces the lives of three
generations of a Cairo family against
the background of their country's
political vicissitudes from 1917 to
1944. Many of this author's books,
his Zuqaq al Midaqq for example,
enjoy a wider than average circulation.
Book production ¡n the Arab coun¬
tries has however two weaknesses
which create an imbalance. Firstly,
the book industry is still mainly con¬
centrated in Cairo and Beirut, where
most of the printing and publishing is
done. Secondly, production fluctuates
from one year to the next. The
Lebanon for example published
427 titles in 1967 and 685 in 1969;
Kuwait published 153 titles in 1967
but only 80 in 1969.
Another important factor is the num¬
ber of books published by category.
While the social sciences represent
24 per cent of total production, litera¬
ture 20 per cent and religion 11.5 per
cent, the pure and applied sciences
account for only 15.5 per cent, though
it is generally considered that they
should be on the same level as
literature (20 per cent).
There is thus a gap here which
should be filled, particularly since
scientific book output, at some 400
technical works a year, is inadequate
to meet the needs of countries faced
with the problems of an Increased rate
of development and where the needs
of education are becoming increasingly
urgent.»
Annual production in the Arab world
is thus 40 titles per million inhabitants,
as against a world average of 140,
and the number of copies is 0.4 per
inhabitant as against the world average
of 2.3.
All these facts and figures point to
the fact that it is less in the produc¬
tion of titles than for the production of
copies that the Arab world lags be¬
hind. This accurately reflects the situ¬
ation in countries where an active
intellectual life and a vigorous cultural
tradition have existed for many
centuries. On the other hand, the
changing fortunes of history, economic
difficulties and the consequent high
rate of illiteracy today act as a con¬
siderable brake on book development
and circulation.
But what about the reading public
and its needs? Since this public can
be divided broadly into adults and chil¬
dren of school age, the answers can
best be given in terms of three partic¬
ularly important kinds of books: books
for general reading, school and uni¬
versity textbooks and children's
books.
As regards books for general read¬
ing, specialists have assessed minimum
needs as one book for each potential
reader a year, and six titles for each
group of 30,000 readers. In 1970 the
Arab world had 18 million literate
adults, a figure which has been large¬
ly exceeded today as a result of ex¬
tensive literacy campaigns launch¬
ed in all the Arab countries, and the

RENAISSANCE OF ARAB LITERATURE (Continued)

number of children now completing
their studies.
Novels, poetry and plays are all
classified under the heading of
general reading. Tawflq al-Hakim, one
of the most widely read of Arab play¬
wrights, arouses unflagging public
interest with plays rich in a symbolism
which is an amalgam of fatalism and
despair (Ahl al-Kahf), or in which his
characters struggle against their own
destiny (Rihla ila-l Ghad).
Among Arab poets we could mention
the names of Adonis, Nizar Qabbani,
al-Chabbi, etc. Poetry and the ability
to memorize verse have always been
highly prized in the Arab world.
Public poetry recitals are common
and, even among the illiterate, it would
be hard to find a person who was
unable to recite a verse or two, an
eloquent reminder of the importance
of the oral tradition.
As already stated, 1970 book pro¬
duction in the category of literature and
general reading represented 20 per
cent of the total, or nearly one thous¬
and titles, of which 3 million copies
were printed. On the basis of the
minimum needs quoted above, it
should have totalled some 4,000 titles
and 18 million copies.
The Arab governments . are fully
aware of the gap between actual pro¬
duction and requirements, and are
making a considerable effort to bridge
it by a policy of long-term planning
of which the decision to set up a re
gional book development centre ¡n
Cairo is a notable example.
Educational books are a -special
case since production is more or less
adequate to needs. The problems are
the same as in other parts of the
world: planning production in order
to keep pace with the increasing
school population, making textbooks
more attractive and above all, suffi¬
ciently varied and adapted to different
regions of each country so that chil¬
dren in remote villages do not have to
use textbooks that talk only of city
life, of pavements, blocks of flats, cars,
and so on.
The fact that Egypt, for example,
published 370 textbooks in 1968 and
distributed nearly 26 million copies in
schools gives some idea of the scope
of the problems involved.
I,IN 1970 there were 54 mil¬
lion children aged under 15" in the
Arab world, representing 45 per cent
of the total population. Of these
children 32 million were potential
readers in the 5 to 14 age-group,
whose minimum book needs called for
an annual production of 1,500 titles
and 32 million copies.
The importance of children's books
has long since been demonstrated.
They stimulate and establish lasting
reading habits and accustom the child
to the printed word, opening up to him
the realms of pictures, drawing and
graphic representation, developing his
powers of imagination as he discovers
the universe, so psychologists, artists
and educators should all co-operate in
producing them.
This question is of special impor¬
tance to the Arab world which has no
publishers specialising exclusively in
children's books. Virtually all large
publishing houses have a youth depart-*
ment, but their publications, though
well produced, do not always corres¬
pond to the needs of the young reader.
No overall figures are available for
this category but one example is that
of the well-known Cairo publishing
firm, Dar al-Ma'arif, the largest produ¬
cer of children's books in the Arab
world, which publishes 58 series of
books for the 6 to 15 age-group, com¬
prising 566 titles of which 136, nearly
a quarter, are for children under 8.
Thus there are no problems of lack
of creativity or ideas to obstruct book
production in the Arab world, which
has a sufficiently rich and ancient cul¬
tural tradition to stimulate writers and
creative artists. One of the chief
obstacles however is in the lac'< of
professional incentive. A career as
a writer does not pay because the
limited number of copies printed does
not provide a livelihood or enable the
author to write full-time.
Another major problem is copyright
protection. Though countries in the re¬
gion have taken the first steps to
adhering to international copyright
conventions, most Arab countries have
]]>
</page>
<page number="24">
<![CDATA[
no national legislation for copyright
protection. Pirate editions flourish and
are the bane of authors and publishers.
It is to be hoped that a revision of the
Universal Copyright Convention and
the Berne Convention that would
favour the developing countries will
be adopted without delay.
Outside Cairo and Beirut, publishers
in the Arab world are few and far
between. Publishing houses are often
bookshops or printing firms which
originally were to be found grouped
together round the mosques and law
courts and which have gradually taken
on other activities. Morocco has given
a lead in setting up modern publishing
houses, both publicly and privately
financed, in the main centres of
modern intellectual life, (Fez, Casa¬
blanca, Rabat). Morocco's initiative
is an example which should be follow¬
ed not only by the main book-
publishers such as Egypt and Lebanon,
but also by the other Arab book-
producing countries.
The existence of such publishing
houses and their reorganization into
associations, first on a national and
then on a regional level, would make
it easier to adopt joint solutions for
common problems such as the choice
of manuscripts, the planning of mat¬
erial requirements and production,
financial backing, etc.
As regards actual printing works, the
Arab countries have two considerable
achievements to their credit. The first
is the Moroccan Ecole du Livre, unique
of its kind in the Arab world, which is
helping to solve the acute problem of
training qualified personnel. Else¬
where such training is acquired either
from experience on the job or through
courses abroad, though this inevitably
has some drawbacks.
The second achievement is the Al-
Ahram press in Cairo, the most
modern in Africa, equipped with up-to-
date machinery and employing most
of the printing processes in use today.
Both achievements show the efforts
made for book development by coun¬
tries anxious to equip themselves with
the means to follow up their immense
drive for literacy and school enrolment,
by providing books and other reading
matter which readers need to consoli¬
date and extend what they have
learned.
\ptNE of the most complex
and delicate problems faced by the
governments of the Arab countries is
that of costs. The decision of the
Arab Postal Union in March 1971 to
consider the whole region as a single
postal unit is a first step towards
lowering postage rates. These rates,
however, are still high, and .a reduction
for books from the present prohibitive
charges would ease the circulation of
reading matter considerably.
Prices block distribution. High pri¬
ces, whether due to production costs
or those of transport and distribution,
put books beyond the reach of many
potential readers. 4 Distribution goes
hand in hand with book promotion
since it involves the use of varied me¬
thods and channels and the prospect¬
ing of an ever wider public. A variety
of methods are used, ranging from tra¬
velling libraries to sales-points in
highly-populated areas and village mar¬
kets and even in cafés which bring
books to an entirely new reading
public.
As history has taught us and modern
times now demonstrate, the Arab coun¬
tries have a major role to play in
world cultural development. Hitherto,
political events tended to isolate them
from the main highways of commu¬
nication, and their culture and literary
works were thus deprived of the
means of dissemination offered by
modern mass media. These circum¬
stances no longer exist, and the renais¬
sance, or Nahda, of Arab thought and
literature, begun in the middle of the
XlXth century, is today attaining its full
significance.
The book development campaign
will, first of all, enable the Arabs them¬
selves to become aware of the scope
and quality of the creative works pro¬
duced on their own soil. It is to be hop¬
ed that these works will then be made
available to other world cultures,
through an equally ambitious campaign
for their translation into the most
widely spoken languages, so that a
world-wide public can have access to
the literary masterpieces of contem¬
porary Arab scholars, writers and
poets.

pioneering work of two Channel Island

way to becoming reality.
The basic idea of reducing the
contents of a book, magazine or news¬
paper, or bulky reference records is
not new. Hospitals have long been
using microfilming methods as a
means of storing ex-patients medical
case histories, and as early as 1930
microfilmed reprints of items from
American newspapers were available.
After the Second World War,
libraries made use of microfilm
editions to complete their collections
of out of print or rare books. At present
the motor car industry is making great
use of micro-catalogues and main¬
tenance manuals which they issue to
their dealers and agents. Many
magazines, particularly technical ones,
can now be published in microfiche
form with up to 70 pages available on
a microfiche (a sheet of film) no bigger
than a postcard.

is required to reproduce the micro¬

the average book-lover would want
to curl up with by the fire on a cold
winter's evening.
It was at this point that George
Davies and Hedda Wertheimer of the
Channel Islands came on the scene.
They decided that the answer to pro¬
ducing an easily handled micro-size
book (*) was to be found in micro-prin¬
ting rather than in photographic minia¬
turisation of books printed in the nor¬
mal way. Their experiments showed
that micro-printing, at a 10 to I reduc¬
tion on normal print size was feasible
on standard offset litho presses.
For their books they decided to use
polypropylene paper which, although
only a third the thickness of a micro¬
fiche, can take printing on both sides
and results, for an average size book,
¡n a micro version of ten 5 in. by
5 1/2 in. double-sided pages. A micro-
library unit of ten books, including
a somewhat thicker cover, would be
about the same bulk as an average
paperback.
To read the book a pair of binocular
lenses is required. These fold flat
when not in use to the size of a
slightly thicker than usual bookmark.
In use they are held in place by a
magnetized strip t>f steel placed
behind the page being read.
Since binocular lenses are used.
double images have to be printed.
Though this takes additional space
it has the advantage that three dimen¬
sional illustrations can be used.
Furthermore, since the lenses are
adjustable, people of all ages can read
micro-print without strain.
The biggest problem that remains
is to get general acceptance of the
idea. People are naturally unwilling to
buy the readers until they are sure that
there will be micro-size books to read;
on the ' other hand, publishers want
to be sure of a reading public before
they plunge into micro-printing.

THE UNIVERSITY PRESS
in the service of scholarship
28
by Maurice English
WhEN Professor Peter Vor¬
zimmer returned to America from
Cambridge, England, in 1966, it was
with a feeling of confidence about the
manuscript he was bringing back with
him. A specialist in the history of
science, Vorzimmer had spent much
of his six years' residency in Cam¬
bridge exploring the origins of The
Origin of Species, by Charles Darwin.
MAURICE ENGLISH, American author, jour¬
nalist, editor and publisher, has had wide
experience in the field of scholarly publish¬
ing. He is director of Temple University
Press, Philadelphia, and from 1961 to 1969
was managing editor of the University of
Chicago Press. He Is the author of "The
Testament of Stone", an anthology of the
writings of Louis Sullivan, one of the great
pioneers of modern architecture (1963),
"Midnight in the Century', a collection of
poems (1964), "The Saints In Illinois", a play
(1969), and a translation from the Italian
of selected poems of Eugenio Móntale (1966).
In doing so, Vorzimmer had examined
in detail problems which evolutionists
knew had to be settled, but which had
been ignored since Darwin's death.
True, Vorzimmer's confidence in his
work was somewhat troubled by his
impression that no British publisher
would issue it as a book. However,
it could stand one more revision, and
then, no doubt, one or another of the
enterprising publishers in America
would be Interested.
Three or four discouraging years
after returning to the United States,
Vorzimmer had learned otherwise.
Not a single commercial publisher, in
or out of New York, was even
prepared to read the manuscript. Its
title alone: Charles Darwin: The Years
of Controversy, followed by its sub¬
title: The Origin of Species and its
Critics 1859-1882 implied a thorough¬
ness of research which discouraged
sales-conscious editors. They raised
no question about the importance of
the work, but assumed that it could
not be published at a profit.
And at this point, the reader of this
article already knows why, along with
the growth of a flourishing book
industry in the United States, we have
seen, concurrently, the growth of a
wholly non-commercial kind of book
publishing. This is known as univer¬
sity press publishing. Though in the
service of scholarship it defies some
of the tenets of capitalism, it has
developed with amazing vigour. Parti¬
cularly in the last decade it has come
to fill an irreplaceable role in the
dissemination of learning.
As a result, despite the effects of
the current recession in America, the
university presses continue to Increase
in numbers, and in the number and
quality of their publications. And in
]]>

recent years, other countries too have
begun to see the advantage of
publishing houses which are free to
publish the fruits of scholarship
and scientific research, without any
form of social, political or economic
pressure.
Here let me pause for two essential
clarifications. The term "university
press" ¡s not of American origin, and
it has sometimes been stretched to
include kinds of publishing which are
essentially commercial (though they
often serve an educational market).
A glance backward in time will show
how the term began.
Like other American phenomena,
this one is a transformation of
something of English origin. The first
university presses were those of
Oxford (1478) and Cambridge (1521).
These were set up originally to publish
works of piety and of learning as it
was then understood. But in addition,
they benefited from the patronage of
the state, including a monopoly on
certain kinds of publishing and printing
(Bibles, grammars, editions of the
classics and over the course of time,
various kinds of educational material).
Nowadays, these two presses are
essentially among the most distin¬
guished "trade houses", whose schol¬
arly and educational publications are
only a small part of diversified lists.
However, their example has embol¬
dened other commercial publishers,
without their historic justification, to
use the word "university" in their
titles, even when they have no
connexion with any institution of
learning. It is simply a means of
appealing to the profitable market in
which they wish to sell their textbooks
and other educational publications.
Although there are exceptions, such
publishers are not, in principle,
interested in bringing out works of
pure scholarship, of basic scientific
research, for which the readership,
over a period of years, may be very
small.
But universities, apart from their role
in teaching, exist to foster just that
spirit of disinterested inquiry which,
in the course of time, often changes
the way in which people think, or feel
or act. Universities exist also to foster
a world-wide exchange of specialized
knowledge not only between scholars
in different nations, but between those
in different disciplines.
"Disinterested Inquiry," in short,
leads nowhere unless its results take
some tangible form. In our society,
the form is usually that of a book.
The challenge has been: how to publish
books whose circulation is likely to
be limited, because their subject
matter is too specialized.
In the United States, this challenge
has been met by the universities
themselves, the most enterprising of
which are undertaking to subsidize
their own presses, so that, first, the
most productive members of their own
faculties will be sure of obtaining
publication of the results of their
research; and an important second
consideration whole fields of know
ledge can be covered by programmes
and series of publications, many of
them written by scholars in other
universities than that of a given press.
The fate of Professor Vorzimmer's
study is again relevant. It was brought
out in 1970 by the press of Temple
University, where he teaches but
only after five of the most distinguished
evolutionists in the country had
recommended publication, and stated
their reasons in writing. And a fact
of possible interest to the trade houses
which refused the work the right to
publish the work in the British
Commonwealth was promptly bought
by a London publisher. Since publica¬
tion, Charles Darwin: The Years of
Controversy has received only favour¬
able reviews, some of them, surpris¬
ingly, in daily newspapers.
When Vorzimmer's book was pub¬
lished, the assumption was that the
university would not recover the money
spent on its manufacture and dis¬
tribution. That is no longer so certain,
in this particular case. The basic
decision to publish, however, was a
completely non-commercial one. And
that is necessarily true of most of the
decisions to publish a manuscript,
made every day by the directors of
university presses in America.
They are subsidized by the univer¬
sities whose names they bear. Some¬
times, though by no means always, the
subsidies ultimately come in part from
some public source (perhaps one of
the fifty states which, along with
the Federal government, increasingly

UNIVERSITY PRESSES (Continued)

support higher education in the United
States). Many of the university
presses, however, derive much of
their revenue from their own backlists
of books that remain in print, selling
modestly, over the years; others from
a university printing office or book¬
store whose income goes to the
press; yet others from endowments by
private benefactors.
Whatever the source of the subsidy,
the sponsor-university makes one
stipulation: its press must publish
works on merit alone: the merit of
original scholarship, as judged by
qualified (and anonymousl) specialists
and attested by a "Board of Review"
of " the university's own published
scholars. And finally, of course, uni¬
versity press books are reviewed and
criticized, in the learned journals that
cover the same field.
To see how this system developed,
one must skip almost four centuries
and move from Oxford to Ithaca, New
York, where Cornell University began
its own academic press in 1869. It
was followed by Johns Hopkins in
Baltimore in 1878, and much later, but
still before the 19th century ended,
by Chicago.
Since the dates cited above,
American university presses have gone
through three phases. Until about
1930, they were often launched by an
energetic individual, a university
president, a scholar with a bent for
publishing, or some other academic
entrepreneur. Then, in the 1930s and
1940s, responding to the expansion of
what has been called "the knowledge
industry", the university presses began
to be organized on a more professional
basis, with emphasis on careful editing
and design, sales programmes based
chiefly on mailing advertising "fliers"
to members of scholarly or profession¬
al associations, and sounder business
procedures.
In the United States though this
need not necessarily be true elsewhere
university presses are discouraged
(by tax laws) from entering the field
of textbook publishing, where they
could try to make a modest profit, or
at least recoup their losses on genuine
scholarly monographs.
These problems and the continuing
starting up of new presses led to the
formation in 1937 of the Association
of American University Presses. The
scattered enterprises henceforth had
a clearing house through which they
could agree on standards, share
knowledge of publishing procedures,
and set up training programmes for
editors, book designers and the other
specialists who had now entered the
world of academic publishing.
These new arrivals have included a
number of top editors and publishers
from the New York "trade houses",
who found the atmosphere of the
campus congenial; and congenial, too,
the opportunity to deal with books and
the men and women who write them,
on the basis of their inherent value, not
their marketability.
By 1948, there were 35 member-
presses in the AAUP, which in that
year issued 727 new books. At this
writing, there are over 70 members of
the Association, including a few located
outside the United States, with
associate status. In size, they range
from seven new publications yearly to
almost 200. According to book
industry records, university presses
published 2,700 titles in 1970, the last
year for which official figures have
been compiled; this was 7.5 per cent
of the U.S. total of 36,000 non-govern¬
mental titles; these achieved sales of
$37,000,000, or 1.3 per cent of the total
of $2,750,00,000 . spent for books in
that year by the U.S. reading public.
(Since colleges and universities in
the U.S. now total more than 1,500,
it can be seen that university presses
are not a routine campus phenomenon.
Characteristically, they are associated
with the major universities of the
"Ivy League", world-famous centres of
research like Chicago and Berkeley,
and the larger state and urban uni¬
versities, many of which have student
populations of 40,000 or more. For an
American university to have a press of
its own, especially one. of recognized
quality, is very much a mark of
academic prestige.)
I HE maturing of scholarly
publishing can be tested in various
ways. There is the fact that, of the
100-plus presses which have been
established, although many, due to the
recession, have reduced the total
number of books they publish yearly,
others have continued publishing a
fixed number, and even report no
decline in sales. Only a few of the
weaker presses have been forced to
suspend their activity.
There is another way of measuring
the quality of these presses. At the
present time it is said that, of all the
non-fiction titles published in the
United States in a given year, 10 per
cent are published under the imprint
of a university press. But this statistic
only takes on life in the light of
another: of the non-fiction titles that
remain in print (because there is a
demand for them that sustains itself
from year to year), 15 per cent are
published under the imprint of a
university press.
That difference in percentage is an
indication of the degree of success
with which the editors of university
presses seek out manuscripts on sub
jects of importance, which express
original ideas or organize fresh
information, in clear (and if possible,
vigorousl) language, rather than
publishing books which display more
ephemeral qualities.-
Ât this point, it would show a lack
of candour not to admit that some
American university presses have had
a hard time of it financially. This is
easy to understand. Discouraged
from publishing the kind of educational
books (textbooks, especially) which
find large markets, they are committed
to works which by their very nature
are costly to produce and costly to sell.
Then, too, they are supported by
universities which, themselves, always
feel hard-pressed for funds for all
sorts of worthy educational program¬
mes. And whether profitably or not,
the university presses are selling a
product a fact which in itself makes
them the odd man out on the univer¬
sity scene.
Nevertheless, as we have said, they
not only survive, but have increased
in number, even during the difficult
years through which America is still
living. And there is an encouraging
aspect of the picture for university
presses elsewhere: not all countries
have a tax structure which, like the
American one, discourages university
presses from issuing textbooks and
other educational works which can
help to support the monographs of the
scholars. The reason for this, by the
way, is that in the U.S., educational
institutions are always exempt from
taxation.
A corollary of this exemption is that
they are not supposed to compete
with businesses including publishing
houses which do pay taxes. There
is presumably no reason why an
academic publishing house in a
country with a different tax structure
should not have the best of both
worlds: pay its bills, even return some
income to its parent institution, while
remaining faithful to its basic aim, to
publish excellent works of the mind,
regardless of any other consideration.
In any event, it is notable that
adaptations of this form of scholarly
publishing have already begun in
other countries, including Great Britain,
where the university-connected com¬
mercial publishers of Oxford and Cam¬
bridge have been joined by smaller,
American-style presses. These are
currently in existence at the Univer¬
sities of Wales, Edinburgh, Manchester,
Liverpool, Leicester and London
(whose imprint is that of the Athlone
Press, because the name "University
of London Press" was pre-empted by
a trade house which specializes in
educational books, but ¡s not connect¬
ed with the university Itself.)
In Canada four such presses now
exist, those of Montreal (McGill-

Queens), Toronto, Laval and British
Columbia. In Japan, the University
of Tokyo Press is the best-known of
ten; in Australia, the Australian
National Press, in Canberra, despite
its ambitious name, is one of six.
Elsewhere, there are the presses
of the National University of Mexico,
the Universitetsforlaget of Norway and
in Belgium, the Editions de l'Institut de
Sociologie de l'Université Libre de
Bruxelles. Korea has five university
presses, grouped in an association;
and the University of Malaysia Press
is in operation in Kuala Lumpur,
Malaysia as are the Hongkong
University Press, and that of Singa¬
pore University in their respective
territories.
Meanwhile, the African nations have
made a vigorous start with the Haile
Selassie University Press in Ethiopia;
the Ghana University Press in Ghana,
two in Nigeria, one at the University
of Ibadan, another at the University of
Ife. And there is also the Press of
the University of Witwatersrand in
South Africa.
Regularly, the officers of the
Association of American University
Presses (1000 Park Avenue, New York,
NY) receive inquiries from all conti¬
nents, seeking information about the
steps to be taken to provide publishing
outlets for the work of scholars ¡n
scores of old and new nations.
And the Association has taken
initiatives of its own to get in touch
with those scholars, and the univer¬
sities which shelter them. Recently a
delegation visited Moscow and Lenin¬
grad, and was able to bring back a
preliminary, but encouraging, report on
the development of scholarly presses
in the Soviet Union. Some of these
are attached to universities, but others
to the scientific and scholarly research
institutes, now 50 in number, located
in Moscow. It seems possible that an
era of interchange, and even co-
publication, may develop between the
scholarly publishers of the two
countries.
/ANOTHER aspect of aca¬
demic publishing exists which might,
elsewhere, have the same value it has
had in the United States. This ¡s
"regional" publishing, bringing out
works which record or celebrate the
cultures of ethnic and other minorities,
or old customs or cultures, so many
of which are vanishing under the
impact of industrialization.
Thus, the University of Oklahoma
Press has long been distinguished for
the series of books ¡t has published
on the American West, its Indians and
frontier history. The University of
California Press found itself with a
best-seller when it brought out Ishi in
Two Worlds: A Biography of the Last
Wild Indian in North America, by
Theodora Kroeber. (See "Unesco
Courier", February 1963.) The Univer¬
sity of New Mexico Press has done a
service to history, as have many other
regional presses, with such titles as:
First Mail West: Stagecoach Lines on
the Santa Fe Trail (by Morris F. Taylor.
Albuquerque, New Mexico, 1971).
In this field, the opportunity for
university publishers lies in the fact
that major publishing enterprises tend
to be concentrated in the capital cities.
The rich life of the nation, lived in its
provinces and remote areas, and often
expressed in tribal forms and tribal
tongues, can readily be overlooked as
a result. Universities which are
located, as is usually the case in the
United States, in areas remote from
the two or three major cities, have a
role to play in saving the cultural
heritage of the human race, before it
is gone forever.
As knowledge grows in any field, it
becomes more specialized. But this
very specialization makes it more
urgent that different disciplines should
remain in touch, and that the learned
in different nations should keep
abreast of what their colleagues are
doing elsewhere.
The American experience suggests
that the publishers of these men of
learning are best off in the sheltering
arms of a parent institution. Yes, of
course, it provides the all-Important
office space, light and heat, and funds
to pay salaries and the bills of the
printers and binders. But it provides
also the humane skills and attitudes
publishing needs, and the company of
the men and women who provide its
product, and share its ideals.
This may be a unique companionship
in contemporary life, and suggests an
¡deal all university presses might keep
in mind for the future. Up to now,
the great seminal works of the mind
have in most cases been published,
perforce, by commercial houses. But
some of these works have appeared
under the imprint of university presses,
from the time of John Dewey on, and
their number ¡s increasing.
Herbert Bailey, director of Princeton
University Press, recently pointed out
that the great masterpiece of Henry
David Thoreau, Waiden, when it was
published in 1854 by the distinguished
house of Ticknor and Fields, in Boston,
was ignored by the public. The
publishers returned 700 unsold copies
to the author.
As businessmen, they had no
choice; but, Mr. Bailey points out, a
university press, if one had existed at
the time, would have kept those
700 copies on its back list, and
continued to promote them, so that the
appreciation and influence Thoreau
lacked, might have been his much
earlier, perhaps during his own life¬
time.
If they maintain high standards, as
the quality of their books becomes
widely known, who can say that it
will not be the university presses of
various countries which will be the
publishers of the Thoreaus and the
Deweys of the future?

I HE developing countries can
expect to enjoy easier access to books
written and published in the industrially
developed countries thanks to a revision
of the Universal Copyright Convention
worked out at Unesco's headquarters in
Paris last year. Application of the revised
Convention should lead to an increase in
the production and distribution of books
In the Third World.
The Unesco conference for revision of
the Convention, held in July 1971, brought
together representatives of 45 of the 60
countries adhering to the Universal Con¬
vention as well as observers from 30 other
countries and from inter-governmental and
non-governmental organizations specially
concerned with copyright questions.
Essentially, the purpose of the con¬
ference was to satisfy the practical needs
of the developing countries by making it
easier for them to acquire educational,
scientific and technical books, without
weakening the structure and scope of the
copyright protection afforded by the Uni¬
versal Copyright Convention (adopted in
Geneva in 1952) and the Berne Convention
(dating from 1886 and already revised four
times between 1908 and 1967).
Simultaneously, a parallel conference
grouped countries belonging to the Berne
Convention to consider amendments that
give developing countries the same advan¬
tages as those provided by the Universal
Copyright Convention. Although the meet¬
ings of the two conference were held
separately, there was a striking degree of
unanimity on the basic problem.
In the production of books, an
enormous imbalance exists between the
developing countries and the industrialized
world. Though 70 per cent of the world's
population lives in Asia, Africa and Latin
America, these regions represent only a
very small proportion of the annual world
production of five thousand million books.
Asia produces about 21 per cent of this
total and Africa less than 0.15 per cent.
The position is slightly better in Latin
America, but the gap between production
and needs is still very large. The Arab
countries too suffer from a shortage of
books (see page 22).
The same is true for the number of
new titles published. The 18 developing
countries of Asia, representing 28 per cent
of world population, publish only 7.3 per
cent of total new titles; Africa with 9.6 per
cent of world population publishes 1.7 per
cent, and Latin America with 6.1 per cent
of world population publishes 3.8 per cent
It is also apparent that the subject
matter of the books published does not
always correspond to the needs of devel¬
opment In Asia, for example, scientific
GEORGES RAVELONANOSY, of Madagas¬
car, was the first editor of the Courrier de
Madagascar, a French-language daily news¬
paper, which began publication in Tanana¬
rive, in 1962. He is the author of a study
on Malagasy poetry. Since 1970 he has
been a staff member of Unesco's Press
Division.

Georges Ravelonanosy
and technical books amount to only 10.6
per cent of the titles published less than
half the equivalent percentage in the
industrially developed countries.
To make up for this inadequate pro¬
duction, the developing countries are
obliged to import books; in Africa three
books out of four come from abroad.
The agreements reached at the con¬
ferences provide a legal system of inter¬
national copyright that is flexible, practical
and effective. Three new articles were
drawn up. The first defines what is meant
by a developing country. Under the
second, developing countries no longer
have to wait seven years after the original
publication of a work to translate it into
their national languages for use in schools
and universities or for research. The new
regulations provide for a one year delay
before translation into local languages. For
translation into "languages in general use",
such as English, French and Spanish, the
period is reduced to three years.
Under the third new article, licences to
reproduce works for school, university or
research use may be obtained by any
national of a country that ratifies the Paris
agreement when the original publisher has
not sold the rights within five years of
first publication. For works in the fields
of science and technology, the period is
three years, while for fiction, drama, poetry,
music and art books it is seven years.
Two obligations are imposed on those
taking up translation and reproduction
rights; the translated and reproduced works
may not be exported to another country
and the author must receive just compen¬
sation. In addition to the prescribed num¬
ber of years before the various rights to
translate and reproduce become available,
the Paris agreement provides an additional
six or nine-month period for negotiations
between the original copyright holders in
industrialized countries and publishers in
developing countries.
A number of similar arrangements are
allowed for with regard to audio-visual
material such as television films and sound
recordings intended exclusively for educa¬
tional purposes. Such arrangements apply
strictly within the territory of the country
that has obtained a licence to use material
in conjunction with audio-visual media.
The increasing use of educational broad¬
casts, in the broadest sense of the term,
as a method of teaching in many develop¬
ing countries further underlines the im¬
portance of the new regulations.
Finally, the conference eased the regul¬
ation under which any member State leaving
the Berne Convention cannot subsequently
enjoy protection under the Universal Copy¬
right Convention in countries which are
members of both conventions. Developing
countries were exempted from this "safe¬
guard clause" because of their need to
"adjust the degree of copyright protection
they provide to the level of their cultural,
social and economic development."
AtL N Intergovernmental Copy¬
right Committee was set up at the Paris
conference. Its members were chosen on
the basis of "a fair balance between national
interests bearing in mind the geographical
situation of the population, languages used
and degree of development."
This committee, to be responsible for
dealing with problems relating to the
application and functioning of the revised
convention, will be established as soon
as the revised convention comes into force.
It will consist of the 12 member states
of the 1952 Convention Committee: Argen¬
tina, Brazil, France, Fed. Rep. of Germany,
India, Israel, Italy, Kenya, Spain, Tunisia,
United Kingdom, U.S.A., and the following
countries elected by the conference:
Algeria, Australia, Japan, Mexico, Sene¬
gal and Yugoslavia.
The conference thus achieved a care¬
fully balanced compromise. While safe¬
guarding the moral and material rights of
the author, the new legislation should pro¬
mote the development of letters, the arts
and sciences and contribute to better inter¬
national understanding.
The goals have been set and a broad
field of action foreseen. But the revised
Convention will not become a truly effective
legal instrument until it has been widely
ratified and applied.

Letters to the Editor
NORMAN E. BORLAUG'S
DEFENCE OF DPT
Sir,
It is most surprising to find a scientist
(Dr. Norman Borlaug, in your Feb. 1972
issue) condemning as "hysterical" those
who prefer natural methods of pest con¬
trol that respect the biological balance
(methods that have stood thé test of
time) to more recent methods that
respect nothing, except perhaps the
powerful financial interests behind
them, and which blindly recommend
the massive use of pesticides and
chemical fertilizers. The use of such
terms is hardly compatible with the
scientific spirit, and if anyone is
hysterical It Is surely those who claim
to have changed everything with their
' revolutionary methods rather than those
deliberate minds that demand proof be¬
fore adopting new and untried methods.
Dr. Comet touched on the heart of
the matter when he spoke of the "rapid
development of new agricultural meth¬
ods in which chemistry has displaced
the long-established procedures, giving
the farmer the means of increasing the
yield of his crops to the detriment of
their food value. Fertilizers have upset
the ecological balance of the soil to
such an extent that hitherto unknown
pests have flourished, offering the
chemical industry new markets for
insecticides and pesticides."
The result has been the wholesale
poisoning of all living creatures, since
"this flood of poisonous products kills
flora and fauna and, permeating under¬
ground water supplies, is drawn up by
vegetation of all kinds."
In face of such facts, Dr. Borlaug's
defence of DDT seems wordy and
unconvincing.
Prof. Georges Moureaux
Oyonnax, France
WE ARE NOT
REACTIONARIES
Sir,
As young persons concerned with
the protection of nature, may we correct
the somewhat hasty definition of our
viewpoint as given by Norman Borlaug.
We are not reactionaries, nor do we
demand a total ban on chemical fertili¬
zers and other agricultural chemicals.
They are essential in the developing
countries, but in our own countryside
they are often used haphazardly and
without due precautions. They produce
bumper harvests that are stored away
for years on end and benefit no one
not even the countries that have
greatest need of them. Excess ferti¬
lizer is washed into rivers where it
promotes the growth of aquatic plants
which use up the oxygen, thus killing
the fish.
We need not re-emphasize the part
played by DDT In the destruction of
some animal species. More serious, as
recent studies show, is that DDT inhibits
the process of photosynthesis In marine
algae, and this in the long run is liable
to reduce fish stock an Important food
reserve.
We still believe that the use of agri¬
cultural chemicals should, be controlled
in industrially developed countries where
crop surpluses remain unused and health
problems are less acute.

REARGUARD ACTION
Sir,
Perhaps Norman Borlaug failed to
realize that he was merely fighting a
rearguard action. That, at least, Is the
Impression one gets from some of the
photographs published with his article.
On page 8 we see a malaria-carrying
mosquito against which, we are told,
DDT must be used to protect millions
of persons. Yet on page 13, a photo
shows gambusla fish which gobble up
mosquito larvae being released Into
ponds and rivers In areas where mos¬
quitos have become resistant to DDT.
Let us admit that "environmentalists"
may sometimes tend to be too rigid in
their views, but let us also concede that
it is they who pioneered the way to
real progress in the protection of nature.
M. Joubert
Angers, France
IMPACT OF THE CINEMA
ON TELEVISION
Sir,
The article on TV In your February
1971 issue does not elaborate on the
impact of the cinema on television. May
I therefore suggest that the "Unesco
Courier" devote part of a forthcoming
issue to this subject.
It will soon be 50 years since the
first public demonstration of the sound
recording on and the reproduction from
a film took place. This event, which
revolutionized the silent cinema, pro¬
viding It with voice, was demonstrated
on June 9, 1922 at the Electrical
Experimental Station of the State Uni¬
versity of Illinois in Urbana, Illinois by
J. T. Tykociner, Research Professor of
that University.
I think that this 1972 50th anniver¬
sary should be of interest to your
readers.

EUROPE'S FIRST PAPER-MAKERS
Sir,
Your admirable January 1971 issue
devoted to International Book Year
reproduces the map of "Paper's thou¬
sand year journey from China west¬
ward", drawn up by Thomas F. Carter
in 1925 (page 18). Though I have no
comment to make on the part of the
map dealing with the Far East, the part
concerning early European paper-mak¬
ing calls for some corrections. The
indication "Hérault 1189" refers to a
so-called paper-mill at Lodève; yet
since the publication in 1906 of an
authoritative work by M.J. Berthelé, it
is known that the document cited as
proof of the existence of a paper fac¬
tory was dated 1269, and not 1169, and
in addition, a copyist's error had substi¬
tuted the word "paperias" for "paxe-
riam" (roadway). Despite this clear
refutation, the "paper-mill of Lodève"
has frequently been referred to since
it was first mentioned in 1840. Perhaps
the "Unesco Courier" could now help
finally to demolish this myth. As
regards Italy, the famous paper-making
city of Fabrlano, near Ancona, where
high-quality paper Is still made, should
be cited in connexion with the date
1276 rather than Venice and Montefano.
Furthermore, even though followed by
a question-mark, the date 1320 beside
Cologne has no basis in fact and the
date for Nuremberg should be 1390,
not 1391. Finally, the oldest French
paper-mill mentioned in the archives is
that at La Plelle, near Troyes, which
is known to have been ¡n operation as
far back as 1338.

'NAKED KINGS'
OF MODERN ART
Sir,
I read with great interest your articles
on the inquiry into "Public Attitudes
to Modern Art" (March 1971) and the
letters on this subject published in
your beautifully illustrated Issue on
Angkor (Dec. 1971).
I have been a painter since 1920,
but it was only after much effort that
I learned to understand modern art. It
is hardly surprising that the average
person, whose home Is often filled with
reproduction period furniture, and who
never visits museums, finds it difficult
to comprehend modern art forms,
except perhaps for some aspects of
modern décor that are foisted on him
and of which he says: "Yes, not bad;
it's modern."
Art is the field of an "aristocracy of
the mind", the good taste of traditional
civilizations being maintained by an
intellectual élite. Once deprived of
guidance, the masses lose this taste.
Look, for instance, at the art produced
In Europeanized Africa. In the West,
the tradition was carried on to the
19th century by a misunderstood few,
in the face of an anti-traditional aca¬
demism, until it became enfeebled and
then disappeared. Caught between two
fires, the public threw up its hands
in despair.
On the other hand, should we not
ask the art connoisseurs to think
again: Are you really so sure that
you're always right? How many
"famous" names have vanished into
oblivion in the past fifty years?
And what if the Man-in-the-street was
sometimes right? Remember the child
in Andersen's fairy-tale who alone cried
out: "Look the king is naked." I fear
that nowadays many "naked kings" are
admired by the artistic snob.

BOOKS FOR ALL
Every minute of every day a book is published somewhere in the world : about 550,000
titles a year, double the output of 20 years ago. But four out of five of the titles still
come from a handful of nations (see page 12). International Book Year 1972, with its
slogan "Books for AM", has focused world attention on the serious imbalance in book
production and distribution. Here, a technician at a book-printing plant checks the
quality of cellophane proofs used in photo-offset printing.
