Unesco Pays Tribute to Albert Einstein
On His 70t Birthday
Special Unesco
Programme
A LBERT EINSTEIN was born
seventy years ago, on 14 March
 1879, in Germany. When he was
still a boy, his family moved first
to Switzerland and then to Italy. He
wasn't a. very bright boy. He didn't care
for any school subjects, except mathe-
matics ; and he disliked the disciplines
of German schools enough to run away
at least once. He had some difficulty in
qualifying to take a degree. And the best
job he could get was as a minor official
in the Swiss Patent Office.
That is what E. nstetn was in 1905 : a
junior Swiss patent official. But that year,
1905, was his anDUs mirabilis, his wonder-
ful year. In that year, at the age of 26, he
published a series of papers which made
outstanding advances in three qtr.'te
separate branches of physics. The most
famous of these was his first paper on
Relativity. In ten years from 1905,
Einstein created a revolution in physics.
He became at the same time a recognized
leader and the enfant terrible of science.
11= OR the seventieth birthday of Albert. Einst in, the greatest scientist of
our generation, and one of the great
men of our time, Unesco prepared a
special radio programme for its"World
Review".
The persons whom Unesco invited to
pay this Tribute to Albert Einstein, the
man, the scientist and p ; sneer of the
human spirit, are themselves leaders of
sc : ence in our day : the famous American
scientist and educator, Dr. Arthur Comp-
ten ; the distingu : shed French mathema-
tician, Professor Jacques Hadamard ; and
the great Danish physicist, Niels Bohr.
But they speak not for science alone but
for all humanity. The homage they pay
is to the man and the pioneer rather than
the specialist. And they speak of Einstein,
and to E. nstgin. not as specialists but as
friends.
EINSTEIN has always Been aninternat'onal man. He was inter-
national by temperament, and like
every scientist he was international bll
training ; because science is the oldest
of all international brotherhood.
Science speaks a universal language,
which is built up of the contributions
of men of all ages and of all nations.
.-Einstein's work is unthinkable without
that oJ his predecessors, ancient and
modern, German and Russian, Euro-
pean and American.
Unesco has asked Professor Niels
Bohr of Denmark, tó'Put his work
into this international perspective.
Neils Bohr won the Nobel Pr : ze in 1922,
the year after Einstein. He is with
Einstein the greatest physicist living,
and it is characteristic of him that
his work has been done in many parts
of the world and with men of many
nationalities.
The above photograph, taken on the day preceeding Albert Einstein's 70th birthday,
shows the expounder of the theory of relativity relaxing in his home, at Princeton,
New Jersey. Since 1933, Einstein has been at the Institute for Advanced Studies
in Princeton.
THE INTERNATIONALIST
"it T is most natural and appropriatethat the United Nations Educa-
tional, Scientific and Cultural
Organization should pay a tribute to
Albert Einstein. z on the occasion of his
seventieth birthday. Indeed, for the
whole of humanity Einstein's name
stands pre-eminently for that search to
extend our knowledge and deepen our
understanding which is not only the
spirit and object of science, but which
forms the very foundation of ail human
civilization.
Through Albert Einstein's work the
horizon of mankind has been immeasur-
ably widened, at the same time as our
world picture has attained a uaity and
harmony never dreamed of before. The
background for such achievement is
created by preceding generation of the
world-wide community of scientists and
its full consequences. will only be revealed
to coming generations.
Man's endeavours to orient himself in
his existence beyond the immediate neces-
sities of life may be traced back to the
widely spread birth-places of our civiliza-
tion like Mesopotamia, Egypt, India and
China and, above all. to the small free
communities in Greece, where arts and
science rose to a height unsurpassed for
long ages. During the Renaissance, when
all aspects of human culture again
flourished, most intense and fruitfui con-
tacts between scientific endeavours all
over Europe took place, as we are remind-
ed by the names of Copernicus, Tycho
Brahe, Kepler, Galileo. Descartes. Pascal
and Huygens, men of many countries
whose achievements created the basis of
By
Professor Niels BOHR
the edifice of which Newton's genius is
the pinnacle.
New Insight
lr HE great. advance of natural phi-losophy at th t time, which came
to exert a deep influence on all
human thinking, consisted above all in
the attaiament of a rational description
of mechanical phenomena based on well-
defined principles. It must, however, not
be forgotten that the idea of absolute
space and time formed an inherent
part of the basis of Newton's work and
that also his well-known coacept of
universal gravid. 1tin constitutes an ele-
ment so far not further explainable.
It was just at these points that Einstein
initiated quite a new development, which,
in an unforeseen manner, has deepened
and rounded our views and given us new
insight and power of comprehension.
The way leading to this turning point
was paved by the development during the
nineteenth century, of our knowledge of
the electromagnetic phenomena which
has brought such a great increase in
human facilities and created the modern
means of, world-wide communication.
This development was furthered by an
ever more active international co-opera-
tion, the extent of which is recalled by
such names of many nations as Volta,
Cersted, Faraday, Maxwell. Hertz, Lo-
rentz and-Michelson. Gradually, however,
the growth of knowledge in this new field
disclosed more and more clearly the
difficulties and paradoxes inherent in
absolute space-time description.
A quite new outlook was here opened
by the genius of Einstein, who changed
the whole approach t the problems by
exploring the very foundation for the
description of our experience. Thus,
Einstein taught us that the concept of
simultaneity of events occurring at
different places was inherently relative,
in the sense that two such events which
to one observer appear simultaneous, may
seem to follow each other in time from
the standpoint of another observer.
This recognition of the extent to which
the account of'phenomena depends
essentially on the motion of the observer
proved, in the. hands of Einstein, a most
powerful means of tracing general phy-
sical laws valid for all observers.
In the following years, Einstein even
succeeded in attaining a viewpoint wide
enough to embrace the gravitational
phenomena, by extendin his considera-
tions to the comparison of the effects
experienced by observers with accelerated
movement relatively to each other. Out
of Einstein's novel approach to the use
of space and time concepts grew gra-
dually a wholly new attitude towards
cosmological problems, which has given
most fertile inspiration for the explora-
tion of the structure of the universe.
Although simplicity and beauty are
the principal marks of Einstein's fU : : 1-
damental ideas, the detailed treatment
of complex problems often demands the
use of abstract mathematical methods
like non-Euclidean geometry. As often
before, it has here been most fortunate
that such tools were ready as the fruit
of the work of older mathematician) *.

IS A WORLD
of Philosophy
Really Necessary ?By Robert FAWTIER
Professor at the Sorbonne.
N January 18, an Intemaiona ! Council for Philosophy
it) and Humanistic Studies was founded in Brussels.
Sceptics may smile on hearing of the creation, of
pother organization and of the forming of a new inter-
1.. 1tional council and may ask themselves what good all
zits will do. They may even smile at the mention of
L'lmanistic sciences. For to many of them the human
fences, which study Man, his moral behaviour and the
\ : : pious manifestations of his mind, are not sciences at aiL
And then, too, they may probably say that in our age of
the practical application of science and of the mastery
. oi matter over mind. the human sciences are of no impor-
trance or interest whatever.
It is, of course, true that the natural sciences have for
more than a century made unquestionable advances, and
have pursued their research and practical applications to
ach a-point that we are sometimes tempted to believe
that their potentialities are unlimited and their work in
the world unique. But what is not always realized is that
ti, e results of these sciences, and indeed the sciences
themselves, are in the last resort only manifestations and
products of the human mind.
If we examine the matter, we are forced to admit that
it is man himself, either individually or collectively, who
has the command of these sciences and of their results.
and that upon him, and him alone, depends the use that
is made of them ; that it is through him, and him alone,
that their discoveries will prove a blessing to mankind or,
alternatively, its utter destruction.
We see, therefore, that there is after all a certain value
In knowing about Man, on whom the natural sciences
have conferred powers which primitive times reserved for
the Divmity alone.
Now, it is this Man which the human sciences study.
Little by little, these sciences have revealed to us the secret
springs of human action. It is through them that we can
discover how individuals aid human communities react.
Finally, they are the means by which. we can, if not
establish certainties, at least determine with a fair
measure of preciseness, Man's potentialities of action,
either as an individual or as a member of a community.
The physicist, in spotting the atom, suddenly unleashes
forces the powers of which frighten even those who have
discovered them. However, if we allow ourselves to be
impressed by these immediate practical results, what shall
we say of the thinker or worker in the human sciences
who elaborates a theory the social application of which
is ignored or even despised, but which may one day
transform man ?
The answer will no doubt be that a meeting of phi-
lologists or linguists, of historians or folklorists has only
a very relative immediate interest, and that the results
these research workers obtain will be applied only in a
more or less distant future.
Outmoded View of Life
Such an attitude is simply the survival of a largely
outmoded view of life. The means of spreading knowledge
have become so rapid that we cannot say how IO : 1g it will
be before a particular theory discovered by the study of
human sciences will take effect.
In the past, and not a very remote past, it took weeks
and months to travel a few thousand miles. Now it takes
a single day. Formerly it took months, years, centuries
almost, for an idea conceived and formulated at one end
of the world to reach the other end ; now it takes a second.
That is a point of some importance.
Should we expect the scholars emerging from their
recent meeting in Brussels to solve all the problems of the
human sciences over night ? They would be the first to
laugh at such a suggestion. What they want'to do first
of all is to learn to work together.
The human sciences have as their subject Man, a
ceature of infinite diversity. But they are studied by men
\\ho, perhaps because of the very nature of their studies
[2nd to work in isolation. Teamwork may be perfectly
r. atural to chemists and physicists and to all natural
scientists, but for the human scientist it represents
something against which he has a tendency to revolt.
Thus, too, work in the human sciences is often carried
can, with the idea that it will be linked up only in infinity.
And yet how often, during research in a specific field,
ae we not obliged to cast a glance at what is happening
in parallel disciplines ? The truth is that at the present
time there is no way of knowing what is being done
j'1 related fields of the'social sciences without much waste
cf time and effort.
Each of the humeri sciences has its own separate
Anthropologists Plan'
International Body
anthropologists and ethnologists are panning to set up
.,'heir own international ! organization so that they can

nistic Studies, which was created in Brusse) s on January
] 8th, under the auspices of Unesco.
.'\. small working committee whose members come from
'1. ustria, RI'Igium, Denmark, Great Britain, Holland, Italy,
Switzerland and the United States, is to meet at Unesco
'loose from March 24th to 26th, to draw up the terms of
t he organization's constitution.
When formed, it will replace the International Congress
, ( 1\nthrQPologica and Ethnological Sciences, which has
50 far arranged the meetings of experts in these fields
of the Human Sciences.
Unesco is encouraging and assisting the establishment
of the new organization so that the scientists it will group
can work more closely with other human scientists
already conaborating through the International Council
for Philosophy and Humanistic Studies.
COUNCIL
At the Palais des Académies in Brussels, M. Camille Huysmans (standing), Belgian Minister of Public Educa-
tion, is seen addressing an audience attending the inaugural session of the International Council for Philosophy
and Humanistic Studies. At extreme right of table, M. Jean Thomas, Assistant Director-General of Unesco

method and rarely troubles about the methods used in
the other human sciences. Thus one finds that human
scientists very often"re-discover"things which have
already been discovered in neighbouring fields.
The first goal of the newly created Council for Phi-
) osophy. and Huma7istic Studies is therefore to establish
contacts between scientists working in different fields
and to inform them of what is being done in similar or
related fields devoted to the study of Man. If in this way
we could break down the water-tight compartments be-
tween the different disciplines, research. work in the
humanities would be made considerably easier. An
observation made by an anthropologist is often valuable
to a linguist ; a discovery by a linguist may teach the
historian that his enquiries are along the right lines ; a
particular feature in folklore throws light on the literary
heritage of mankind.
In order to make serious progress, the human sciences
need crossfertilization. Up to the present there has been
little or none of it, and for that reason a clearing-house
of information on all that is being done in this enormous
field of world-wide intellectual activity cannot fail to be
of value.
Finally, the human sciences-precisely because of the
difficulty they have in discovering truth-offer another
advantage for the human mind. The materials they use
can7ot be isolated in a test-tube, or be subjected to
chemical analysis, or broken up or bombarded by elec-
trons. Their great merit-we might almost say their
superiority over the natural sciences-is that even if
they arrive at the truth they are never sure of possessing
it. Hence that constant intellectual research, that
ceaseless criticism of work already done, that constant
criticism of the materials to hand.
1 : : 1 those who practise these sciences all this develops
a mentality which is sometimes exasperating, but which
is none the less essential. The critical spirit is a product
of the human sciences, and it is the critical spirit which
makes of man what he must be if he is to be. worthy of
that high title : a being who does not accept all that he
is told, who does not do everything that he is ordered,
and who reflects before he acts-in a word, a being who
is free.
That is why those systems which want to reduce ma : : 1
to the function of a machine or animal do not encourage
the development of the human sciences. What they want
is human material which does not think, because-if it
did-it might come to see that those in command are not
so much to be feared as they imagine. The critical spirit
and liberty are indissolubly bound together. For that
reason it is possible that, by encouraging the establish-
ment of a Council on Humanistic Sciences which hopes to
give these sciences a fresh impulse and unite in common
action all those who make moral man the subject of
their studies, Unesco may have done the best service to
its own cause, namely, to give man his intellectual
freedom, his only true freedom, and the only possible
basis of peace.

UTLesco Reports Educational
Needs'oj M. E. Rejugees
THE educational and culturalneeds of over 800. 000 war
refugees in the Middle East are
described in a report by Mr. P. N.
Kirpal, Deputy Secretary at the
Indian Ministry of Education,
just issued by Unesco. Mr. Kirpal
recently completed a survey for
Unesco on conditions in the ref-
ugee camps in Egypt, Iraq,
Transjordan, Syria, Lebanon, Pa-
lestine and Israel.
"The most urgent task". Mr.
Kirpal states in his report,"is the
fight against hunger, co1d and
diseas and, in the midst of this
suffering, it may seem fantastic
to think of introducing a plan
for education and culture. Yet
there is no doubt that an educa-
tional programme should be
planned and implemented at
once. Very little is being done at
present."
Mr. Kirpal adds :"A well-
designed programme can raise
the refugees'morale... ond mor-
ale is the most important factor
in the present situation... all the
teachers required can be found
among the refugees."
Unesco has already allocated
15, 000 dollars to finance a limited
educational programme and
hopes to obtain 40, 000 dollars in
cash or educational materials
from ether organizations. In co-
operation. with the United Na-
tions Relief for Palestine Refu-
gees and other voluntary organ-
izations, Unesco is seeking to
provide education for the 200, 000
school age refugees and to fill
the educational needs of the
adults.
Unesco Essay Contest
Deadline Extended
The closing date of Unesco's
two essay and poster competi-
tions, launched Jast September
for school-children, has been
extended from July 1 to Septem-
ber 1, 19f9,
The first is open to students
between 15 and 18 years of age
and the second to those from 12-
up to 15. Entries may be submitt-
ed in either of two forms-an
essay between 1, 000 and 2, 000
words, or a poster not exceeding
48 x 66 cms.
The essays and the posters
submitted should be sent to the
Ministry of Education in each
country or to any other address
specified by the Member State
concerned.
Results of the competitions will
be announced at Unesco's Gene-
ral Conference in the Spring if
1950. An exhibition of the
wtnning entries will also be ar-
ranged at the same time.

March 1949 UNESCO COURIER
BOOK COUPON SCHEME PROBING
A SUCCESS
First Coupons Customer
A few weeks ago the American
A'Booksellers'Association re-
ceived the first Unesco Book
Coupon as payment for an order
from Mr. MacBean, a student at
St. Andrews'University, Scot-
land. He wanted and had await-
ed in vain for some time a copy
of a scientific work called"Har-
nessing the Earthworm".
He wasn't sure of the title and
didn't know the price but, as the
author was given correctly, the
American bcoksellers managed to
track down the book and send it
on to Mr. MacBean. He paid for
his coupon in shillings and pence
but the American books211er sup-
plying the book received payment
in dollars and cents, without any
assistance from a bank or ex-
change office.
But. why was this necessary ?
Currency has been the difficulty.
Even if there. were any rich
scholars and libraries in coun-
cultural life, they must take their
place in the long queue of appli-
cants for slices of the foreign
currency available. In most coun-
tries this total is now very small
indeed and scientists and scholars
must compete with the general
demand for food-stuffs and con-
sumer goods, and with industry's
need for machinery and raw
materials.
An International.
Publications Bank
FROM its very first days Unescohas been aware of this prob-
lem-the key to educational re-
construction and cultural inter-
change. Plans for some kind of
international publications bank
were brought forward, and these
ripened, in 1948, into the Unesco
Book Coupon Scheme, through
which individuals and institu-
tions can now buy, in their own
currencies, required foreign pub-
Mr. D. G. MacBean, a student of St. Andrews University in
Scotland, became the first Book Coupon customer to pay for
a book ordered from the American Booksellers'Association. We
publish, above, part of a letter Mr. MacBean wrote to a Unesco
staff member explaining how he ordered his book and expressing
the hope that the Book Coupon Scheme will be continued.
Readers in England who encounter difficulties in obtaining
foreign books and periodicals are advised to apply immediately

tries wnn. weak currencies, they
would find it very difficult to buy
publications from abroad. It's not
a question of price. For a uni-
versity library in Poland it has
been at least as hard to get a
scientific paper priced fifty cents
from the United States as the
last edition of the expensive
Encyclopaedia Britannica.
Although books and periodicals
are the life-blood of a country's
Canada, United States Set Up
Book Exchange Centres
NESCO has stressed for along time that surplus
books and periodicals,
which normally go to paper-mill
for re-pulping, should be made
available to libraries and other
institutions in other countries
through a system of exchanges
and gifts.
During a trip last January and
February to the United States
and Canada, for Unesco, I was
able to see that this system has
now become a reality. In the past
few months, two book centres
have been set up in WashingtOn
and Halifax to carry out this
work.
The first, the United States
Book Exchange Inc. (U. S. B. E.) was
established through a grant from
the Rockfeller Foundation, to
carry on the work formerly done
by the American Book Centre.
In additton to exchanging public-
cations with other countries on
the basis of two U. S. items fo :
one from overseas, it will send
free publications to needy inset !-
tutiQns in war-damaged countries.
When I visited Washington in
February, only a few weeks after
the U. S. B. E. had asked American
libraries for their surplus publi-
cations, over half a million
volumes had already been re-
ceived.
In collaboration with Miss A. D.
Ball, U. S. B. E.'s Administrative
Director, I was able to draw up
a plan for the distribution of
publications and the co-ordina-
tion of the Centre's work with
that of Unesco. Under this plan,
still to be approved by U. S. B. E.,
publications will be listed accord-
ing to subject matter and sent
to libraries interested in a parts-
cWQJ'field. The allocation will

be made on a rotating scale so
that a different library will have
priority on items in each new
list sent out.
I realized the considerable
progress made in the past 15
months when Unesco was still
quite inexperienced in all matters

Centre, established on February 1

concerning large-scale distribu-
tion of books. Now, it is able to
give guidance and up-to-date
information on such questions
as needs and shipping facilities,
etc.
Prior to my visit to Wa3h-
ington, I attended the opening
of the Canadian Book Centre,
which lWas set up in Halifax
jointly by the Canadian Library
Association and the Canadian
Council of Reconstruction,
through Unesco. It will supply
free publications to war-damaged
countries, and when it opened own
February 4th had already collect-
ed 30, 000 books and periodicals.
By the end of 1949 it hopes to
have dealt with 500, 000 volumes.
In co-operation with Mrs M. N.
Reynolds, Director of the Centre,
I drew up a distribution plan
which is being considered by the
Book Committee in Ottawa,
similar to that for the Wash-
ington Centre. This provides for
lists of publications to be sent
to institutions whose names have
been supplied by Unesco. From
requests received, Unesco wou : d
then submit a tentative alloca-
tion _list to the Centre.
Although the Centre was set
up as a short-term reconstruction
service, it is hoped that Cana-
dian librarians will decide to
maintain it as a permanent cen-
tre for book exchange and dis-
tribution.
A good example of the way it
could help Canadian Libraries
was given at the opening cere-
mony, when a librarian of the
Canadian National Research
Council came across some tech-
nical periodicals which her lib :' ; l-
ry had been trying in vain to
obtain for years. *
lications in the fields of educa-
tion, science and culture.
In December 1948 Unesco dis-
tributed about one hundred and
fifty thousand dollars worth of
book coupons to thirteen coun-
tries. Part of this distribution
was a gift for reconstruction, but
most of it was paid for by the
receiving countries in sterling or
French francs. The coupons are
then sold in each country to
deserving book-users, and paid
for, by them, in the national
currency. Thus purchasers are
able to order the books they need
from hard currency countries, like
the United States.
Mr. MacBean, the system's
first client, bought a coupon
from the British distributing
body and sent it on to the cen-
tral selling organization in the
United States. Unesco paid the
American bookseller in dollars
and will, itself, receive sterling to
th same amount.
Who then, you might ask, is
the loser ? Nobody, although
Unesco backs the scheme with a

hundred thousand dollars. Unesco
plays the role of clearing-house
and doesn't even have any over-
head expenses as the personnel
needed to operate the scheme are
paid out of a five per cent sur-
charge on coupons sold.
By-Passing the Barriers
THE National Central Libraryin Florence, Italy, which suf-
fered heavy losses during the
war, has sent in an order of more
than three thousand dollars for
French books, otherwise un-
obtainable.
A few weeks after the first issue
of the coupons American book-
sellers received orders for about
eight thousand dollars, of which
ninety-five per cent are for scien-
tific and technical periodicals,
indispensable tools for the re-
searcher.
It is being realized more and
more that the main hindrance to
what is generally called the free
flow of ideas and the interchange
of culture is an economic one. In
their way the Unesco book cou-
pons by-pass this barrier and give
the student in Bombay a chance
to get the latest work on soil ero-
sion from Harvard, enable the
scientist in Budapest to receive a
newly published paper on nuclear
physics from Paris. Now a hu-
manist in Czechoslovakia can
follow the latest developments in
Shakespearian research and criti-
cism in England.
Unesco's book coupon scheme,
although only run as an expert-
ment in 1949, has already been
acclaimed a success in many
countries as a practical and effi-
cient means of breaking through
one of the highest barriers to the
free flow of books. Unesco now
has it in mind to develop and
broaden the scope of the scheme,
and to include other educational
aids in the operation.
fThe above article was take"from
the new weekly radio programmes,
"Uní ! SCO IVorld Review". l
Book Coupon Echoes
Unesco proposes to continue its book coupon scheme by making a
further 250, 000 dollars available as"hard"currency backing when the
present experimental period ends this year. It is also hoped to find
other sources of"hard"currency, so that the scheme can be extended
still further.
* * * *
Switzerland has just agreed to participate in the scheme as a book-
selling country. This brings to five the number of"booksellers". The
other"bookselling"countries already taking part are the United
States, Great Britain, France and Czechoslovakia.
*"* * *
Unesco is planning to use its four Science Cho operation Offices at
IUontevideo (Latin America), Shanghai (Far East), New Delhi (South
Asia) and Cairo (Middle East) as distribution centres for the Book
Coupon Scheme. A supply of coupons for sale will be allocated to each
Office.
* * * *
Hungary, which has been granted a supply of coupons for free
distribution, has now made an official request for an allocation of
coupons to be placed on sale in the country.
* * * *
The Pan American Union is considering a plan suggested by Unesco
for extending the book coupon scheme to Latin American countries.
These would pay for the coupons in local currencies which the Pan
American Union could then use for travel and other needs in Latin
America. Under this plan, Unesco would receive dollars for the
coupons sold.
* * * *
Unesco is studying a plan whereby American libraries would use bJ1) k
coupons to buy publications abroad. Unesco would be paid in dollar :.
thus pecmittin : more book coupons to be issued.

lerence in Mexico City the following year, may soon become a reality.
Meeting in Nice last month at the invitation of the French National Broadcasting
Service, representatives of radio organizatio ns from twelve countries approved plans
for a series of World University programmes to be started is October. Representatives
from Unesco,"The Voice of America'. and the International Broadcasting Organization
were also present.
AT PARIS HEADQUARTERS
Unesco Initiates Fortnightly
Student Evenings Discussions
As part of its 1949 plans to
interest youth in its aims and
work, Unesco has organized a
series of"Student Evenings"in
the form of lecture-discussions
for the benefit of young people
of all nationalit : es who are
studying in Paris.
With the backing of French
universe : try authorities and the
co-operation of student organ-
izations in Paris, the first of
these gatherings was held at
Unesco House on March 9,
when Unesco welcomed about
250 students to a discussion of
the question :"Should There
Be a World University ?"
Before the opening of a gen-
eral discussions, short state-
ments on the subject were
made by Professor Georges
Scelle, Professor at the Faculty
of Law in Paris, M. Roger Lu-
tigneaux, Director of French
Educational Broadcasts. and !
two students from the Insti-
tute of Political Studies.
Other subjects to be dis-
cussed at"Student Evenings"
own March 23 and April 6, and
which were voted by the mem-
bers themselves, are"Orient
and Occ : dent-unity or diver-
say of cultures"and"The
effect of Illiteracy on Inter-
national Relations"respec-
tively.
Unesco hopes that these
"Student Evenings"will serve
to stimulate similar student
activities and interest in inter-
national affairs, through Na-
tional Commissions in its other
Member States.
New Indian
Radio Stations
Three new broadcasting sta-
tions are to be opened in
India during the month of
March 1949. They are situated
at Admedahad, Hubli and
Calicut, all of which are on,
or near, the West Coast. This
will mean that ten new trans-
mitters have been put into
operation in India during the
last eighteen months.
In a message to the delegates Dr. Torres
Bodet, Unesco's Director-General, said"no thine
could come closer to Unesco's
aims than the initiative you have
taken... the words'University of
the Air'embody our most im-
portant concepts while illustrat-
ing the means we have to bring
them to life".
Three members of Unesco's Natural Sciences Department speak to American
listeners from Paris during spccial"Science Service"radio programme organized
by Mr. Watson Davis (left) for Columbia Broadcasting System.
"We are convinced", he said,
"and your meeting demonstrates
an identity of views, that know-
ledge is as vital to man as food.
"This University of the'Air you
wish to create will be available
to all list2ners. What is even
more important is that they
should wish. to listen, for what is
needed to-day is that the most
ordinary people should have
access to the knowl-
edge which is their
right. We'mustnot
be afraid to use the
word popularization."
The French Radio
Network has already
given a lead to other
countries in this field
by organizing 60-
minute international
broadcasts, each com-
prising four or five
talks.
In these pro-
grammes, w h i c h

67 NATIONS DISCUSS FUTURE
OF SHOR1-'. W AVE FREQUENCIES
If OR the past five months,repres ntatives of 67 coun-
tries have been meeting ill
Mexico City to discuss a question
that concerns radio listeners all
over the world-the future of
short wave broadcasting.
Since 1938, when short waves.
or high frequencies, were last
allocated at an international Con-
ference in Cairo, the number of
countries actively engaged in
short wave broadcasting has in-
creased from 20 to 80, and the
number of short wave stations
from 250 to 800. But, while the
needs of modern radio are cons-
tantly increasing, the number of
frequencies remains stationary.
The resulting competition, in
which many stations operated out-
side their assigned frequencies.
has cluttered up the air waves
with a great deal of unnecessary
interference. The victim has been
the radio listener all over the
world, who has had to struggle for
good reception out of the conflict-
ing voices bidding for his atten-
tion.
To make a more efficient, more
orderly use of frequencies, in the
interests of all, the International
Telecommunications Union, a
Specialized Agency of the Unit : yod
Nations, has convoked the In-
ternational High Frequency
Broadcasting Conference in Mexi-
co. An earlier world conference,
in Atlantic City in 1947, set aside
a bloc of some 2, 150 kilocycles for
this purpose. The job of the
Mexico Conference is to establish
& plan for allocating these fre-
quencies among the broadcasting
services of the world.
Dividing up the frequencies is
very much like cutting up a cake
when there is not enough to go
around. Requests put before the
Mexico Conference are far in
excess of the frequencies available.
How does one decide who gets
how much ? Should it be according
to the size of a country's popula-
tion ? Should large countries that
need high frequencies for aomes-
tic broadcasts to encompass their
vast rtrea take priority over those
who claim them for broadcasts to
foreign countries ? Which coun-
Television
ill the U. S. Á.
The recent progress of tele-
vision in the United States
was commented on by M. Bor-
ge Michetsen, of Unesco's
Popularization of Science Di-
vision, following his return
early this month from a mis-
sion to that country.
"At the beginning of 19<18",
1\1. Michelsen said,"there were
only 17 television stations on
the air and some 200, 000
receiving sets in use. While I
was in America, the Mid-
western network was hooked
up, through a co-axial cable,
with the Eastern network, and
it is estimated that at least
<100 stations will be on the air
within two years and that by
the end of 1953. 18 million

tries have a right to the most
frequencies for foreign broad-
casting ? _
These are but a few of the
difficult questions that have kept
delegates at Mexico debating far
into the night. At one point, when
the conference was threatened
with adjournment without adop-
tion of a plan, delegates from the
United States, the Soviet Union.
the United Kingdom and France
rose to say that they were con-
vinced that agreement could be
reached. The conference by an
overwhelming majority headed off
the move to interrupt its work.
Unesco has followed the confer-
ence with the keenest interest.
In response to a suggestion from
its Director-General, in a message
to the conference, the plenary
session adopted a solemn pledge
that the frequencies assigned at
Mexico would not be used for
purposes contrary to mutual
understanding and tolerance
The resolution further declares
that practical measures will be
taken to ensure that short wave
broadcasting contributes to the
development of international
cooperation and peace, and that
such measures will be communi-
cated to the United Nations, in-
cluding Unesco.
Thus, quietly, almost unnoticed
amid the stories of conflict in
today's newspapers, the nations of
the world have joined together in
a code of conduct that would
make radio, not an instrument of
psychological warfare, but a voice
in the service of peace. I
ic energy and the literature
of different countries.
The Nice Conference agreed
that the international program-
mes to be broadcast should be on
similar lines to the French ones,
dealing with discussions on scien-.
tific and social questions, art and
literature. For the initial pro-
grammes it chose the subjects of
cancer, food, child development
and education and a comparative
study of how the characters of
Faust and Don Juan have ap-
peared in the literature of differ-
ent countries.
Unesco to Aid in Preparing
Programmes
Unesco and other specialized
organizations are to co-opera'e
in the preparation of the pro-
grammes by supplying materia,
and suggesting subjects and
speakers to the secretariat, for
whose work the French Radio
Service has agreed to be respon-
sible during the University of the
Air's first year of activity.
Materials, texts and recordings
will normally be sent out in
English and French but also,
when specially requested, m
other languages.
Radio-organizations will be
able to choose the programmes
they wish to broadcast and are
expected to inform the secre-
tariat of their agreement or
comments on the plans before
June 1. and also to make their
requests for programmes before
this date.
The Nice Conference referred
to Unesco's production of special
recordings and scripts of the type
suitable for University of the Air
broadcasts and congratulated the
Organization on its initiative in
preparing the 30-minute Einstein
programme, which has now been
broadcast in the Unesco World
Review service, and which is
presented in this issue of the
Courier.

THE VOLUNTARY rT/ORI (LAMP
A Rewarding Adventure for Pease fit
With Youngsters from Many Lands
HEN, in 1920, a Swiss
yv engineer named Pierre
Ceresole thought up the
idea of the International Volun-
tary Work Camps and created
the Voluntary Service for Peace,
he could hardly have foreseen
how his idea would gather
strength and grow into a world-
wide movement.
Little by little, the new asso-
ciation gathered forces in Swit-
zerland, England, France and
other countries in Europe and
even in far-off India. Soon other
groups-such as students and
Quakers and Youth. Hostellers-
became interested and organized
work camps in France, in mining
areas in England and in Nor-
thern Norway :
They did everything : construct-
ing, helping poor communities,
cleaning up flooded areas.
From the Arctic to
North Africa
J, INCE Pierre Ceresole died inOctober, 1945 the Interna-
tional Voluntary Work Camp
movement has spread from the
Arctic Circle to North Africa and
from the Atlantic to the Black
Sea.
In 1948 alone, over 135 Volun-
tary Work Camps were organiz-
ed, and have been helping in the
reconstruction of Europe. With
volunteers enlisting in increasing
numbers, a total of 950 camps
has already been announced for
1949.
Volunteering their summer
vacation each year, thousands of
young men and women have
assembled in large and small
groups to join hands in a com-
mon project of construction or
reconstruction, erecting schools
and hospitals, building Youth
Hostels, roads and railways.
The Y ugo8lav Railway

tria, for example twenty-
five work camp volunteers,
of eight nationalities, under the
leadership of a 23-year-old
Swede and an English girl of Its.
transformed an old castle into a
training centre'for school
teachers.
During 1947 in Yugoslavia.
5000 volunteers constructed 247
kilometres of railroad from Sa-
mac to Sarajevo in 228 days.
moved over 5. 000. 000 cubic yards
of earth, built 17 bridges and
dug nine tunnels.
In the same camp 20. 000 illite-
rates were taught to read and
write by holding one-hour classes
every day after work.
In the State of Utah (U. S. A.),
camp Workers built school dor-
mitories and organized a recrea-
tional programme for the Navaho
Indians living in the region.
Last year, other volunteers
from the U. S. A.. England, France,
Finland. Australia and Austria
all worked together to repair a
dyke is Holland. They set up
their"camp"on a houseboat.
Rapidly they came to understand
that differences in cultures can
be reconciled and that similari-
ties among people are far stron-
Jer than the differences.
The common aim of the Work
Camp movement is to help build
the peace, or as some of the
camps themselves have expressed
it,"build peace through small
international groups of volun-
teers working, living and learn-
ing together".
Work Camps vary in size and
type of work. Some are large.
with thousands of volunteers
pooling their efforts for some
important job. such as the Youth
Railway in'Yugoslavia referred
to above.
Numerous examples are how-
ever provided by the smaller
groups of 30 to 100 volunteers,
working on a project of some
months with a rotating scheme
for volunteers who offer up to
four weeks or more of their
holidays.
On March 2 and 3, Unesco held
a conference in Paris of the
organizers of these Voluntary
Work Camps. Representatives'it
international conferences are
usually people of mature years.
It was quite refreshing, therefore.
to see that at this Unesco meeting
most of the delegates were in
their twenties.
sprinkling of young girls among
them."They came from all pa :. ts
of Europe and America, repre-
senting 27 organizations. And
they reported on the past year's
work of almost 150 international
work camps, manned by some
50, 000 volunteers.
One association, for example,
'xplained how it had solved its
camp financing problem. Another
described results of the first
meeting of camp volunteers at
the end of the season last year.
Another told of the first work
camp project in North Africa :
canalizing a water supply.
Education Emphasized
1MT HE Unesco conference laidspecial tress on the edu-
cational aspect of. work-
camps. As the young organizers
themselves unanimously agreed,
the importance of work camps ìies
not only in the"very important
material contributions to recons-
truction and construction work
of public interest", but also : n
the unique possibilities for"edu-
cation of individual volunteers
through community life and com-
mon work and through contacts
made possible between indivi-
duals nf varied origin and
background", both within the
camps and outside.
Addressing the group of work
camp organizers, a member of
Unesco's Education Department
outlined how adult educat : on
methods, making use of round-
table discussions. newspapers,
folklore dances and music, could
be applied to the camps. Later
many of the young deegates
declared that their association
intended to place greater stress
on organized educational activity
during 1949. Some plan a week's
seminar just before opening the
camps, to form the basis for
further discussions during the
work period. Other organizations
intend to set aside one or two
afternoons each week for educa-
tional activities in their camps.
Handbook For Work Camps
T the present time, Unesco
A'-its preparing a handbook
on camp organization de-
signed to assist inexperienced
associations and camp leaders.
It will give the results of expe-
riences gained in planning and
running different types of camps
and will be ready for. distribution
before the 1949 camp season
begins. On the opening day of
the conference, Unesc was able
to distribute a little pamphlet,
just off the press, entitled"In
Work Camps For Peace".
Speaking into a Unesco micro-
phone on the afternoon of March
2, Miss Susan Fleisher, an Ame-
rican girl from Philadelphia,
summed up her impressions as
a delegate to the conference.
"I think that this conference
of many groups, working through
different methods towards the
same idea, is an excellent exam-
ple of people of the world work-
ing together, and I personally
find it very exciting.
"... (It) has given all of us an
opportunity to meet one another,
to exchange ideas
about our program-
mes, and especially
to profit from one
another's experien-
ce. We are finding
ways in which we
can help each other
through an exchan-
ge of information
and persons.
"We are : toping
that Unesco will
help us by organiz-
ing a study camp
for work camp
leaders somewhere
in Europe. as well
as a post-camp con-
ference of volun-
teers to discuss the
results of our work
and experience
while they are
fresh in our minds.
What we would
most like to do,
sometime in the
future, is a

and construction of bridge
project, we have been di3cusslng
this morning. It is called a"Pilot
Project". Each organization would
set up, in a selected area, its own
work camp as part of an enor-
mous work camp project. In this
way we could all contribute to 1\
common project and yet retain
our own particular methods of
work and organization."
A few minutes later, a DUtCh
camp organizer. Mr. MeiUnk,
spoke into the same microphone
in his native language.
"I sincerely hope", he said,
"that this conference and its
relationship to Unesco will further
the idea of international work
camps and will make an appeal
to the youth of the world to join
hands in an international work
camp for peace."
In 1948 alone, International Voluntary Work Camps chalked up
an impressive list of concrete achievements on three continents :
32 camps  built playgrounds, youth centres, youth hOfids ;
48 camps""built or repaired schools and hospitals-15 camps
built railways and roads ; Ii ; mróò. undertook farm woJ : k ;
18 camps * did social work. This year, at least 950 work camps
will welcome young volunteers from all countries. D. taiied infor-
mation on the camps may be obtained from the Recon-tructMn
Department of Unesco, 19 Avenue Kieber, Paris, 16, France.
Fundamental Education
Echoes
On Marsh 17th an educationist appointed
by Unesco will arrive in Mexico City to
make a three months'study of Mexico's
fundamental education programme. This is
in response to interest shown by Fund-
amental Education circles in the rest of
the world in the way that the Mexican Cul-
tural Missions attempt to raise the cultural,
economic and educational level of the rural
people. Unesco's expert, Mr. Lloyd Hughes,
will study this work and will make a rep0 ! t
to educators"abroad".
The Colombian Government set up last
year a model programme in fundamental
education at Viani in the Andes and has
asked Unesco to send an expert to assist
in this work. Mr. Patricio Sanchez arrived
in Colombia in February 1949.

w. F. 0. Stresses Importance
Of Joint Action With Unescô
or the year 1919 finds the human race at grips with the gravest and the most desperate task it everhas h d to tackle. What is at stake today is, quite simply, humanity's survival. On all of us
wherever we live, whatever we are doing, from wherever we come, will depend the answer to this ques-
tion : wU) the weapons put at our disposal by modern science spell the end of the human race or the
beginning of an era of lasting peace and greater happiness ?
The spotlight of the news continues to be focused on various-so far mostly unsuccessful-attempts
made in the last three years to unite the world politically.
Acceptance of such a joint un-
divided responsibility presup-
poses, however, the emergence of
a true feeling of world citizenship,
the willingness of all men to live
together as citizens in a world
community in which local and
national loyalties are compatible
with the higher loyalty to hu-
manity as a whole. In order to
attain this goal nothing less than
a radical transformation of the
traditional patterns of both in-
dividual and collective human
behaviour is needed. In short,
fear and insecurity must be radi-
cated as predominant elements
in human relationships.
Such a task obviously will be
long and very arduous. To ac-
complish it we :- shalt have to eli-
minate belief in the superiority
of one national or racial group
over such-a belief which always
goes hand in hand with con-
tempt and hatred of others. We
shall have to correct the distort-
ed picture which the majority of
people have of the world outside
their own little spheres. We shan
have to put and end to attitudes
which unavoidably lead to re-
sentment, aggresiveness and ten-
sions.
Viewed against this appraisal
of our problems today, the con-
tribution which such agencies as
Unesco and W. H. O. can make to
the solution of these problems
can hardly be overestimated.
Unesco, which from its inception
has recognized that war starts In
the minds of men, is devoting all
its resources to the use of educa-
tion, science and all branches of
culture as a means for establish-
ing understanding among the
peoples of the world and for free-
ing men from the slavery engen-
dered by insecurity and fear.
W. H. O. considers as its specific
task to give to all peoples"the
highest possible level of health".
It also aims at enabling men"to
THE second number of Museum,Unesc 's q arterly magazine

cational aspect of museums, the

articles in English and French
"on important, unusual, little-
known or unusually successful and
suggestive developments in cos-
nection with museums'contempo-
rary role as centres of instruction
for the ordinary man."
The present number, which is
abundantly illustrated, is divided
into four main sections :"Mu-

sections, leading specialists from
different parts of the world con-

place where one learns by seeing"
and as a living expression of
man's activities down through the
ages to the present day.

Benefits to Man-in-Street Seen
In World Medical Council
......, XT April 4, scientists representing over 50 international
medical organizations will gather at the Palais des Academies
in Brussels to set up what, to the layman, may sound like : : I.
forbidding body : a Permanent Council For the Co-ordination of Inter-
national Congresses of Medical Sciences.
In reality, this new council may play an important role in making
the latest results for treating tuberculosis, cancer, heart troubl,
rheumati1jm and other prevalent diseases more widely known to
medical men in different corners of the globe.
WHAT does the Medical Science"Congress hope to accom-
plish ? Perhaps the following
story may explain its proposed
function, in part :
In the summer of 1947, several
important international meetings,
all devoted to related fields of
medicine, were held simultane-
ously in widely separated cities
of the globe. One was a congress
on cancer meeting in St. Louis,
in the United States. The second
was on microbiology in Copen-
hagen, another on physiology was
held at Oxford, and the fourth
on cytology at Stockholm. These
were all meetings dealing with _
medical subjects in closely asso-
ciated fields, and many of the
scientists attending one of the
congresses keenly desired taking
part in several of the others.
Obviously, however, they could
not be in different parts of the
world at the same time.
Through the new Medical Con-
gress Council it is hoped that
future international meetings sun
related fields of medicine can be
so arranged for time and place
as to present no conflict for me-
dical scientists wishing to attend
various congresses.
Medical Council will include ma-
terial assistance to congresses by
helping in the transfer of funds,
facilitating international travel
of their members and by support-
ing the publication of their
proceedings.
Professor J. Maisin, General
Secretary of the International
Union against Cancer, will be
chairman of the new co-ordina-
tion committee.
01 ficial Bulletin
Unesco has begun publica-
tion of an Official Bulletin, ; OK o/fttt 0//tc : a ! BMetw,
which will henceforth appear
every two months in English
and French editions.
Th's new periodical will give
an account of the importalt
official decisions and activities
of Unesco.
Unesco Aid Sought
On W orld-Wide Scince
Teaching Policies
Art appeal to Unesco for leader-
ship in establishing worldwide po-
licies on teaching natural sciences
has been voiced by the Natural
Science Teachers Association of
the United States.
The apeal called for a"more
adequate programme of science in
general education"and suggested
that Unesco gather information
and prepare a booklet containing
a statement of the policies and
activities of the Natural Sciences
Department of Unesco.
The organization of Science
Teachers, representing all parts of
the United States, also suggested
the formation of an international
organization of science teachers
and strssed the importance of
maintaining freedom of inquiry in
all fields of science.
Over 3. 000 to Attend Unesco
Conference in US This month ,
OVER 3, 000 delegates represent-. ing some 800 United States
organizations and communities
are due to arrive in Cleveland,
Odlio, at the end of the month to
attend the second nation-wide
conference of the U. S. National
Commission for Unesco.
Details of the results of the
conference, which is meeting from
March 31st to April 2nd, will be
published in the next issue of
the"Courier".
The purpose of the conference.
whose theme"Nations will come
together not to destroy but to
construct'was inspired by the
words of Louis Faster, is to
discuss and demonstrate prac-
tical ways in which individuals
and communities can share in
Unesco's work.
One of the principal speakers
will be Dr. Jaime Torres Bodet,
Unesco's Director-General. who
will give expression to his per-
sonal faith in Unesco at a public
meeting in Cleveland's audito-
rium, which seats 10, 000 people.
Among the other distinguished
persons due to speak are Mrs.
Franklin D. Roosevelt, who will
discuss the Dec) aration of Human

Museums of Australia ha*'e
offered to help war-wreck, d
museums overseas to rephce
items of minerals, fauna and
flora used in teaching. In com-
municating this offer, the Austra-
lian Government asked Unesco to
obtain lists of items urgently
needed by devastated museums.

tralian authorities with lists

live harmoniously in a changing
total environment"and at foster-
in"activities in the field of men-
tal health, especially those effect-
ing the harmony of human rela-
tions.
THE"TenSIOns Project"startedby Unesco in 1948 is probably
one of the best examples of how
the two agencies can work joint-
ly for international co-operation.
The value of the project for our
time is clear from the very defi-
nition of its general purpose : to
provide a means by which social
scientists in all countries may
contribute the knowledge and
experience of their respective dis-
ciplines to the advancement of
international understanding. In
1949 and succeeding years Unesco
will prepare a series of mono-
graphs on the"Way of Life"of
the principal nations of the
world. It is hoped that the result
of such an enquiry will stimulate
the sympathy and respect of na-
tions for each others'ideas and
aspirations and the appreciation
of national problems. Another
essential teature of the same
project is a combined effort by
experts in the fields of sociology,
psychology, psychiatry, econo-
mics and philosophy to explore
the conditions which must be
created if attitudes leading to
international aggression are to be
replaced by those leading to co-
operation among the people. The
phrase"Tensions project"sounds
rather cold, technical and aca-
demic. But behind it is nothing
less than the mapping out of a
concentrated and integrated at-
tack on the cause of the ten-
sions now standing in the way
of international understanding.
ANOTHER example of planswhich Unesco intends to de-
velop in 1949, with the active
support of W. H. O., can be found
in the effort to enable Universi-
ties and other institutions of
higher learning to adapt them-
selves to the needs of modern so-
ciety and thus to play their part
in the formation of a spirit of
true world citizenship in all coun-
tries. The foundation for this
work was laid in discussions held
in Utrecht in the summer of
1948, when University professors
from 32 nations studied such
vital issues as the changing role
of the university","the univer-
sity as a force in world co-oper-
ation","Relations between higher
education and the State", etc.
In the beginning of April 1949
an international conference joint-
ly sponsored by Unesco and
W. H. O. will meet in Brussels to
take concrete steps for the co-
ordination of Medical Science
Congresses. For the first time in
history a permanent Council will
be established for that purpose
which will see to it that, through
the channel of medical con-
gresses (mankind as a whole may
benefit from the progress achiev-
ed by physicians in individual
countries of individual branches
of their science.
It is through projects like all
of these that Unesco, W. H. O. and
their s ; ster U. N. agencies intend
to serve the cause which must
transcend all our other concerns :
the building of a physically and
mentally healthy and stable One
World.
6
Meanwhile, there is in all countries a growing awareness that the
challenge will be met only if governments and peoples live up to their
responsibility to ensure, through effective international co-operation,
a decent standard of living to every human being regardless of race,
religion or political belief.
The new medical organization
will be sponsored jointly hy
Unesco and the World Health
Organization, both of which will
contribute an equal amount for
its operation.
The Permanent Council is
however planned as an indepen-
dent non-governmental body.
In addition to co-ordinating
congresses as to dates and places,
the Council will provide informa-
tion to and on medical congressês
both on their programmes and
on the technique of holding con-
gresses.

The names of Gauss. Lobachevsky,
Bolyai. Rietnann, Rieci and Minkowski
here again remind us of the fertility of
international co-operation in all fields of
science. And the same may be said of
Einstein's other outstanding work.
For example, his explanation of the
irregular motion of small bodies in
liquids, ba. sed on the ideas of Maxwell,
Boltzmann, Smoluchowski and Gibbs,
made it possible for Jean Perrin accu-
rately to count the atoms of which
substances are built.
We find our-
se ! vestodayina
new epoch in
physical science.
in which exper-
imental discov-
eries and theoric-
al methods have
led to a rapidity
and fecundity of
progress made
possible only by
international co-
operation of an
unprecedented ac-
tivity and extent.
It is not possible
in this occasion
to disentangle theDr. Bohr
contributions of individual workers, but
mention must be made of the guidance,
at almost every step, which Einstein has
given us by his Relativity theory and
by his analysis of elementary quantum
phenomena.
Altogether, this short exposition of
Einstein's scientific achievements aims at
giving an impression of the extent to
which his originality of outlook has made
him an innovator i : 1 science. At the same
time, I have attempted to remind you
that all scientific endeavours are parts
of a great common human enterprise.
The gifts of Einstein to humanity are
in no way confined to the sphere of
science. Indeed, his recognition of hith-
erto unheeded assumptions in even our
most elementary and accustomed con-
cepts means to all people a new en-
couragement in tracing and combating
the deeprooted prejudices and com-
placencies inhtrent in every national
culture.
With his human and noble personality,
characterized equally by wisdom and
humour, Einstein himself has through all
his life, and not least in these latter
years, worked for the promotion of inter-
national understanding. On his seven-
tieth birthday evidence of the veneration
and'gratitude our whole generation owes
to him will reach Einstein from many
sides, and we all want to express the
wish that the hopes for which he has
lived and, worked may be fulfilled to the
benefit of all mankind..
SEEKER AFTER PEACE
By
Prof. Jacques HADAMARD
Noted French Mathematician
For ten years now, Einstein has sought
by every means in his power to cement
the world into Ol', ! international com-
unity. He has fought what divides
the world. and he ha"fought towards
an undiv : ded worlP-. He has been the
proudest member in the ancient and
international brotherhood of science ;
and his one wish remains to be as
proud a member of the new interna-
tional brotherhood of man.
Professor Jacques Hadamard, recalls
some of Einstein's struggles jor peace.
II shall not sDeak of Einstein's greatcontribution to the development of
modern physics. I shall not speak
either of his mathematical methods, in-
teresting as they are, or of the powerful
way in which Einstein uses them in his
theory of relativity.
Of all his discoveries, this is the theory
which has caused the greatest sensation.
However, the theory of Relativity was
known only to scientists at the time that
the war broke out in 1914. Two ideas of
the world then stood face to face. That
which inspired the Germans was ex-
pressed in the manifesto of the ninety-
three intellectuals, which. has remained
infamous from that day.
A Manifesto Signed by Three
IT UT the human conscience replied. Acounter anifesto was signed by
Einstein and only two others. By
this gesture, the man whom scientists
already knew to be great, showed himself
no less so in his humanity.
Neither of these two characteristics of
Einstein-his scientific genius and his
high moral vision-. was then known to
the general public. That did not happen
until 1919, when the Royal Society pub-
lished the astronomaticàl findings which
strikingly confirmed Einstein's prediction.
Then his scientific fame at once became
universal : but at the same time it exposed
him to the most violent attacks.
There were scientists, even d : stinguished
scientists, who believed that his theory
ccntradicted commonsense. And non-
scientIsts spoke a more violent language.
Einstein was a Jew. He had also chosen
Swiss nationality as a youth (for he had
already disliked the moral climate of
Germany), And that was enough to have
his theories called"un-German"and to
make him unpopular in Germany.
I\t this very time, his theories were
being attacked in France because their
author was called a German. And
elsewhere, so-called philosophical and
political attacks joined forces : Relativity
was called"Bolshevism in physics",
A Turning Point in his Life
IF INSTEIN has never ceased to doL important scie tific work, but from
that time this was no longer his
only work. Indeed, his courageous counter
manifesto of 1914 marks a turning point
in his thought and his life. From that
moment his mind was filled with a
horror against war.
"My pacificism is not based on any
intellectual theory,"he said,"but on a
THE
SCIENTIST
By
Dr. Arthur COMPTON
Nobel Prize-winner in Physics 1927
II ; o ; ant o say a word about Albertt Einstein as a scientist, for it is as
one who has greatly clarified man's
vim. w of his world that Einstein will always
be remembered.
Einstein's great contributions to science
are his"Principle of Relativity"and his
theory of particles or"quanta"of light.
These are fields of knowledge so special-
ized that most persons consider them too
abstruse to understand and too theoretical
to affect human life. It would be possible
to tell how these theories have indeed
aided the advance of practical physics
and chemistry, and how they affected the
outcome of the recent war. But this wou) d
put the emphasis in the wrong place.
Einstein is great, not because of any
effect he may have had on our habits of
life, but because he has shown us our
world in truer perspective, and has helped
us to understand a little more clearly
how we are related to the universe around
us.
In 1921 the Nobel Physics Prize was
given to Albert Einstein"for his discovery
of the law of the photoelectric effect".
This was selected as an aspect of his
theoretical study that was subject to
precise test and had been thoroughly
verified by experiment. It is. however, his
"Principle of Relativity.'that has properly
brought to Einstein his great fame.
"The Principle of Relativity"

or hatred."
At one time he was ejected a member
of one of the Commissions of the League
of Nations. Fee1i : 1g that the League did
not take a strong enough stand against
the mUitarily powerful states, he resigned.
But he returned, because he decided that
what is good must
be supported even
though it makes
mistakes.
It was about
this time that
Einstein came to
Paris, in 1922, at
the invitation of
the COllège de
France. We in the
college were still
afraid that there
might be demon-
strations against
him by national
fanatics-the ve-ry
men who later in
1940 collaborated
with the invaders
of our country. So
we even kept his
address in Paris a
secret.
But our peaceful discussions were not
interrupted, however, violent were the
polemics outside the college. And though
peaceful, our discussions did not lack
loveliness : there were still sceptics who
thought the new theory self-contradictory,
and who did not understand that the
contradiction was only between Relativity
and their own deep-seated habits of
thought. I am proud to have taken part
in these discussions, and there to have
argued with my dear and illustrious fried
Painleve.
.'"Simplicity and Music
IIì UT I also had the pleasure of more: intimate conversations and closer
contacts, in which I learned to
know Einstein in yet another light ; the
youthfulness, the almost disingenuous
youthfulness of his look, and that great
simplicity which marked even his deepest
and most fruitful ideas.
To this pleasure was added that or a
common love of music. It was a delight
to have that great scientist reveal him-
self in my home as a first-class violinist
. with a rare musical gift, and to see the
pleasure which he took in taking part
in our musical reunions.
of these properties. was that the mass of
an electron was found to increase greatly
if it was set in motion at very high speed.
One special assumption after another had
been introduced to account for such
effects, but these special assumptions
themselves had no justification.
Then, in 1905, E : ru ; tein sugested that
the laws of physics as we observe them
may be in no way dependent upon how
fast we a, rue mov. ng through space. It is
only how fast an object is moving relative
to us that, on his view. can affect the
way things on this object appear to act.
The mathematical consequences of this
simple assumption were found to fit with
the changes is the prOperties of objects
moving at very high speeds. No further
special hypotheses were needed.
Accordingly, since Einstein, science has
given up the idea of any framework of
space, such as a fixed"ether", relative to
which we might think of ourselves as
moving. The only motion that has any
meaning, according to the"Special Theory
of Relativity", is the motion of one object
relative to another.
Among the unexpected consequences of
this theory is that the mass of anything
is proportional to its energy, a result now
well verified by experiment. It was this
principle, which led Lise Meitner to find
the enormous energy associated with
at. omic fission.
A New Concept of Weight
11-1 ARDLY was the scientific worldI btccoming accustomed o think in
terms of this"special"relativity
when, in 1915, Einstein introduced a
"general theory of relativity". This took
into account not only the speeds, but also
the changes in speed, or"accelerations".
of objects relative to each other.
It introduced a
new concept of
weight : according
to Einstein now,
the weight of
anything, that is,
the pull on it by
gravity, was itself
nothing but the
reaction against
an enforced chan-
ge of motion.
This concept
meant that in, the
neighbourhood of
a massive body,
such as the earth,
toward which ob-
jects fan if left to
themselves, there
must be a natural
state of motion
that is different
from that at dis-
tances far away
from such masses.
ThL natural state
of motion near the earth Einstein found
could be described by modifications of
space and time in its neighbourhood,
modifications that correspond roughly to
the curvature of the"parallels"of lon-
gitude on a globe.
The most celebrated consequence of thiS
was that tested by thi* British expedition
to observe the solar eclipse of 1918 :-
namely, the effect of the sun's attraction
on a rav of light passin I ? ; near it. The
delicate astronomical studies made then
and since have confirmed these and other
predictions of Einstein's General Theory.
This General Theory of Relativity also
has its remarkable consequences. One of
these is that there cannot be an'endless
amount of matter in the universe. Not
only is the space near the earth and sun
curved ; the space including the whole
system of stars is also curved, and this
curvature puts a definite limit on how
many stars can be in the universe and

THUS Albert Einae_n has made Kpossible for man to see hi self in

light quanta has helped us understand the
atoms that make up the world of which
owe are a part. In his special theory of
relativity he has taught us that we must
think in terms of objects that we see, not
in terms of some imagined framework of
space.
By his general theory of relativity he
has unif. ed our laws of motion and out
law of gravitation, and has opened the
way for us to see with new clarity out

far than had been dreamed before his
thoughts stimulated the imagination of
the scientific world.
Einstein continues his studies. He stiD

knows, gravitational, electrical, and

that goal is not achieved ; but in his
progress towards the goal he has greaUl
expanded our horizons.

IS' :"LITERACY can be sweptout of China. Madame S : m
Yat-sen's China Welfare Fund
(C. W. F.) is adding to the proof
every day, in the slums of
Shanghai.
He-burden of the proof rests
on the shoulders of the very
children who come to the three
centres the C. W. F. has in strategic
spots in the city. For these
youngsters are groomed in the
principles of the"little teachers''
system and their success is de-
monstrating that this is a teach-

be adopted over all of China.

Six Difficulties

11= XPERIENCE has shown tha. tL the"little te chers"meet
six main difficulties. The
first is that most people do not
can sometimes be easily discou-
raged by severe criticism. C. W. F.
learned this early in its work,
therefore"setting a good exam-
ple"is stressed as the corrective
to be used by the"little teachers".
This takes some time to get
across to a few of the children,
especially those who come from
homes where the cuff and the
kick are used to"keep kids in
line". In such cases, the conduct
of the adult supervisors is
extremely important since they
set the example for their young
charges.
Fifth"Trouble-Maker"
, -HE fifth trouble-maker forthe C. W. F. literacy pro-
gramme is lack of space.
The centres are much too confin-
ing, therefore the main work is
being done outside, in the homes
and alleyways of Shanghai's
poorest districts. But this pre-
sents its own problems.
Most of the hosts and hostesses
of the home literacy classes are
the parents of the children who
trances, beside a grave or next
to the local barber-shop.
The sixth difficulty the home
literacy teachers face is how to
find class time that will please
everyone at once. They cannot
hold the class too early because
usually one or two members of
the family get up late. They
cannot hold the class too late
because so many of the homes do
not have light. Consequently.
class must be held sometime in
the afternoon, sandwiched in be-
tween work, study and family
duties.
The element of time enters into
the problem in yet another sway.
It is hard to hold the classes
punctually. Most families are too
poor to own a clock. What usually
happens is that the"little teacher"
dashes to some nearby place
where they do have a clock, gets
the time and hurries back to
start class.
Two Little Teachers
A S can be gathered, these
/"little teachers"are people
with a great deal of heart.
A closer view of the lives of two
of them will prove this more con-
clusively.
Chen Lih-tsun, whose family
originally came from Kwangi-ung,
is one of six children. Their main
support is procuring cigarettes
for two vendors and Lih-tsun is

that this system it really a
workable one. It can uproot and
clean out illiteracy.
When the China Welfare Fund
adopted the late Dr. H. C. Tao's
"little teacher"system, it did so
with great flexibility. This was
because the method was origi-
nally conceived for use in the
countryside and the C. W. F. cen-
tres are in the city. The living
and pace of life are different.
The necessity for learning is
sharper. Therefore, the approach
and even the contents of : he
text-books had to be revised.
Selection and Training
rINCE the children are theJ most important element : n
this system, their selection
must be done carefully. A short
cut to finding and training effec-
tive"little teachers"is to choose
the brightest and most suitable
children available, those who
want to serve and help their
neighbours. This works many
different ways in practice. At
the first C. W. F. centre in the
western factory district, for
instance, such youngsters were in
evidence at a nearby municipal
primary school. In order to mi-
tiate this work, the CWF took
its first"little teachers"from
this school.
Those who were doing well in
their lessons and who showed
signs of understanding the idea
of rendering service were chosen.
They were taught teaching
methods. Since they came from
poor families, the C. W F. also
helped them with their tuition
so they could carry on with their
education. These youngsters th'2n
taught the first children register-
ed in the C. W. F. literacy classes
who were picked right off the
streets of Shanghai.
The"little teachers"at the
second and third centres, how-
ever, were selected differently and
now that the whole project has
gathered momentum, this is the
pattern of selection which is
basic policy for the programme.
The same qualifications of
brightness in class and will-
ingne3S to serve were sought,
only this time within the centre
literacy classes. These children
were given teacher's, training
and put to work among their
own people. Although their edu-
cation level was slower. the
understanding of their pupil's
living conditions was much better.
This aided them in getting
acceptance, especially as they
understand the"little teachers"
system.
Secondly, many parents'fear
that once their youngsters tak
up"little teacher"work, they
will neglect their own studies.
This is not the case, however.
according to C. W. F. records. The
"teachers"must prepare their own
very well. They must thorough-
ly understand every character
before they can teach it to others.
As a result, the"little teachers"
retain their lessons much more
effectively than ordinary pupils
in the literacy classes.
In fact, the children mention-
ed above in connection with first
centre have proved themselves
so proficient in their own
schooling that the municipal pri-
mary school wishes to send more
of their students to the C. W. F.
centres for this valuable training.
Thirdly, since all of these
children come from exceedingly
poor homes, they are expected to
do some of the household chores,
and their parents are afraid their
teaching work will prevent them
from doing this. The C. W. F. must

teach those very classes. The
biggest job is to obtain the
acceptance of the parents to this
idea. Once this is accomplished,
time after time, it has been
witnessed that reluctance turns
to co-operation, especially when
the parents begin to take pride
in their child's new work. What

win and hold the confidence of
the smothers and fathers since
their recognition of the literacy
work is important to its success.
Therefore, the policy followed is
to emphasize the need for doing
the work at home quickly and
efficiently so freedom can be ! Won
for the school-both to learn and
to teach.
The fourth difficulty is centre
about the fact that youngsters
As the word spreads that literacy
is available for those who are
willing to help themselves, the
applicants increase in numbers.

and more home literacy classes
are formed to meet the need and

four every morning and squeeze
into a long queue to buy a few
packages of this commodity. He
buzzes around from one line to
the other, buying as much as he
can. These he sells at a profit to
the vendors, who are located near
a row of bars at the foot of Gar-
den Bridge. He works for the
vendors and the bars until 3
o'clock in the afternoon, when he
is relieved by an elder brother.
Then he comes to the CWF
centre where he teaches. He stays
until evening, as he is now in the
junior class and has his own
studying to do. After this he
tackles another class of his own
in his neighbourhood. The centre
personnel have tried to hold
young Ohen down, for his health
might be impaired. But he drives
on, learning as much as he can
and passing it out as fast as he
gets it. He is an example to all
the"little teachers"and to the
adults as well.
Another typical CWF youngster
is Hsu Yung-hai, age 14, a native
of Kiangsu and the son of a
pedicab man. He was not in the
centre literacy class long before
he caught the fever tao be a.
"little teacher". He was indus-
trious and studied hard. When
the first home literacy class was
set up in a back street lane, tit
seemed only natural that thins
boy should be the teacher. He
went after his job with great
earnestness and soon convinced
all the neighbourhood people that
he was an efficient and excellent

said Yung-hai taught better than
an adult.
Becomes Trouble Shooter
E became the centre trouble-) M shooter. When ver a. tough
job came up, the adult super-
visors looked around for Yung-
hai. Consequently, in early Sept-
ember when the CWF was re-
quested by people living in a
slun a short distance from the
centre to set up home literacy
classes, Yung-hai was called to
take over the task. He walkxi
into a locale of makeshift matsh-
ed huts and shacks surrounded
by stagnant pools of water. It
would have turned the stomachs
of most kids not toughened by
their own hard life. But this
child went to work with a will.
Not only has he taught his pupils
over fifty characters to date, but
he has the parents educated to
the point of cleaning up those
nasty ponds breeding malaria.
It can be seen that the children
reached by the China Welfare
Fund programme live lives mark-
ed by hard fact. In order to
teach them to understand, they
must be taught useful knowledge.
As a result, most of the text-
books that can be bought in
shops are unsuitable for this
kind of work. They are meant
for pupils in regular schools, not
for child labourers, garbage
pickers, shoe-shine boys, orphans
and refugee children. These
youngsters need their lessons
down to earth and concentrated,
for they never know when their
education will be abruptly stopped.
Text-book Problems
O meet this situation, theCWF adult teachers have
prepared four text-books to
cover a two-year period, one book
covering one semester of work.
These books are packed with
practical knowledge, especially
relating to health and sanitation
measures. The set of four are
called"Books for All Ages", and
can therefore be used for adult
illiterates as we
Since it is impossible to write
a perfect text-book, these will
undergo constant changes as the
centre personnel learn more about
the people_they are serving. None
the less, at present the set of
four serves to teach the pupils to
read and write Chinese, some
practical arithmetic and simple
folk songs. In addition, the
"little teachers"and pupils of
:. he higher grades in the centre
classes get lessons on the abacus,
advanced hygiene and English
once or twice a week, depending
upon how advanced they are.
This programme the China
Welfare Fund is operating, com-
plemented by a medical and nu-
tritional aid project, illustrates
many important points in social
welfare work. It demonstrates
that only the poor really under-
stand the poor, and can do the
best work among them ; that illi-
terates best understand the dif-
ficulties of illiterates ; that chil-
dren in these circunstances
understand that this is their
chance to serve their country
and to cultivate their own
talents ; and that the basic prin-
ciple underlying all of Mada-
me Sun Yat-seu's work,"Help
the people to help themselves".
is without question the hope of
the future China.

Courier Supplement
II rejoice that my first official
journey as Director-General of
Unesco should be to your country.
The nearness of our headquarters in
Paris was not the sole factor which
guided my choice. To my mind there
are spiritual considerations which
outweigh mere geographical proxi-
mity. The first of these is the in-
terest which Belgium has always
shown in the international work of
intellectual cho-operation and which
has already taken the form of a
major contribution to Unesco's ac-
tivities.
Even before the 1945 Conference.
the Belgian Government, established
throughout the war in London, took
part with disinterested zeal in the
meetings of the Allied Ministers of
Education, whose labours were to
provide an excellent basis for the
United Nations Educational, Scienti-
fic and Cultural Organization. At the
Conference of 1945, where I had the
honour to represent Mexico, I was
able to appreciate the full value of
the assistance given us by the Belgian
delegation under M. Buisseret and to
note that intense vitality which,
despite the sacrifices demanded by
the war, remains the outstanding
quality of the Belgian people. Later.
in Mexico in November 1947, and at
Beirut in 1948, the delegations chair-
ed with such distinction by M. Camille
Huysmans, deeply impressed the Con-
ferences by the vigour of their con-
tributions and by the'r manifest and
entirely logical conviction of the
noble task that is Unesco's.
Worth of the SiÛrit
it 0 the support which Belgium hasever given to Unesco I would
add two other factors in explana-
tion of my eagerness to make this
particular visit, one of them his-
torical and the other intimate and
personal. The historical factor IS
this : if there be a people in all
Europe which may be deemed to
have reached a degree of maturity
sufficient to attain Unesco's goal, it
is the Belgian :
Their position on the map has
made them the predestined victims
of a succession of war-like adven-
tures which they endured heroically
without ever in their turn seeking to
subject others to their own ambi-
tions. All Belgium sought was to
save the honour of its flag. There
are few countries in the world
which have proved as thoroughly as
Belgium the wo. rth of the spirit in
the face of force or how justice over-
tops the invader's lust for domina-
tion. The shells which more than
once have torn Belgium's soil could
not breach the virtues of its people,
its love of work, its compassion for
the humble, its concept of impartial-
ity and honour. That is a noble
exemple, to which I am glad to do
reverence, and in itself is a source
of living hope for Unesco.
Personal Factor
II mentioneq an intimate personal! t fact r. It is my full appreciation
of your ideals and your anxieties.
From my earliest years, in the far-
off country of my birth, beneath a
sun which every evening gilds the
pyramids of Teotihuacan and every
morning brings back the emory of
Queltzalcoatl, I have felt drawn
towards your hard-working and
poetic land, mystical and practical at
once, able to enjoy realism even in
th opulent mythology of a Rubens,
but able also to escape from it in the
dreamboat of a Rodenbach along the
moonlit canals of Bruges.
In 1937, I came to live among you
as the diplomatic representative of
the United States of Mexico. On 26'November. 1948, the General Confer-
ence of Unesco, meeting in Beirut,
did me the honour to appoint me
Director-General in the place of my
illustr : ous friend, Dr. Huxley, and on
11 December I assumed my present
office. Since that day I have not
ceased to meditate on the great
THE MISSION
--. d
OF UNESCO
, ,.",
By J. TORRES BODES'
On February 21, at the magnificent Palais des Académies
in Brussels, the Belgian National Commission for Unesco
was officially installed in the presence of many of the
most distinguished representatives of Belgian education,
science and culture.
Impressive ceremonies and various other celebrations.
both in Brussels and at the university centres of Louvain,
Liège and Ghent, marked the occasion and testify to the
growing importance which public opinion attaches tq the
National Commission as the active arm of Unesco in each
country.
Making his first trip abroad for this occasion since hi'
took over his post in Paris, Dr. J. Torres Bodet spoke to
the Commission and the people of Belgium on"The
Mission of Unesco". In view of its major importance and
its fundamental probings into the meaning of Unesco, t, he
Courer is reproducing the full text of this address in this
spec : a7 Supplemen't.
difficulties Unesco has met in its
course. Some of them are temporary
and internal, their source a kind of
growing pains. Two years ago Unesco,
to all intents and purposes, did not
exist ; today it is a great international
institution. What wonder then if
everything is not yet exactly right
in a machine put together in such
haste and in charge of so complex,
so vast and to diversified a pro-
gramme ?
Time and Experience
) t N face of a new internationalmechanism, our first impression
resembles what Saint-Exupery felt
when he compared an aeroplane of
Bleriot's time with a modern stream-
lined aircraft. Disheartened by the
difficulties of detail and the complica-
tions of the structure, dazed by the
innumerable springs, levers and
brakes, we stand perplexed in front
of a collection of parts which do
not yet make up a living whole. Let
us not despair on that account. There
is no success which does not follow
on time and experience. Unesco will
gradually acquire the organic flexi-
bility it now lacks,. and, the simpler
it becomes, the better it will fulfil
its functions.
"It appears :' Saint-Exupéry sa : d
in speaking of his aircraft,"that the
whole industrial effort of man, all
his calculations, all his nightly toil-
ing rover plans had their visible con-
clusion in sheer simplicity, as though
it needed the experience of genera-
tions to arrive little by little at the
curve of a column, a hull or fuselage
of a plane, and give to them the
elemental purity of a breast or
shoulder. It appears that perfect : on
is reached, not when there is nothing
more to add, but when there is
nothing more to take away. When
it is finally completed, the-machine
is hidden".
That is how we must go to work
with the administration of Unesco :
simplify it as much as is necessary
in order that the machinery may be
concealed and the Organ ; ration be-
come humanized as we intend it
shall.
&commat; &commat; &commat;
Such internal difficulties can and
will-be overcome by the Executive
Board and backed by the support
and goodwill of the General Confer-
ence. There are, however, other dif-
ficulties inherent not in Unesco as
a Spec : alized Agency of the United
Nations, but in the United Nations
2themselves and, through the United
Nations, in every government and
every people. I mean the difficulties
arising in every country from the
clash between the imperative of the
national will and those of a construc-
tive internationalism. This is a dif-
ficulty which is not peculiar to
Unesco ; the same state of affairs is
found, in the transitional period
through which we are passing, at all
levels of world co-operation.
HE peoples yearn for collectiveagre ment, but fear that if that
agreement is arrived at it may not
take account enough of the legitimate
interests of each individual commun-
ity. With their lips they declare that
no practical international work can
be accomplished unless States agree
to a limitation of their sovereignty.
But each of them asks in his heart :
"Who will agree to surrender part of
his sovereign rights ? All of us ? Then
how much ? Some of us only ? Who ?
Only the weak ?"
Economic and political agreements
alike justify such doubts. Those
doubts are still more justified in
Unesco's case for, if there is any-
thing which governments are not
entitled to surrender, it is the cul-
2urge of their peoples. Their culture
is the very soul which gives them
life, the secret of their individuality
as units in civilization. That indivi-
duality is the fruit of their history,
fashioned through long centuries by
tradition and custom, by suffering
and conquest, and to seek to assail it
would be to outrage in peace a sanc-
tuary which the most ambitions ag-
gressors have seldom dared to violate
in war.
Unesco did not come into existence
to plot that assault. Far otherwise ;
its task is to work towards better
understanding between the peoples
by showing each of them all it has
to gain by knowing and respecting
foreign cultures, so true is it that
foreign cultures serve to broaden our
own concept of life and our own idea
of civilization. Public opinion must be
warned against the mistake of think-
ing Unesco capable of conceiving a
civilization where unity would result
automatically from the application
of uniform rules and purely mechan-
ical adjustment.
. Intellectual Path to Peace
HE intellectual path to peaceand human brother ood does
not lie through any doctrinaire sim-
plification of historic cultures. In
any case such a simplification-
where each culture would lose its
special savour-would bring with it
immeasurable impoverishment. It
would be rather like the artificial
language offered to us from time to
time as a universal vehicle of
thought.
However useful they may be for
that purpose, they are never more
than a collection of bloodless convey-
tions, and only blind optimism could
imagine their ultimately replacing
the real languages, whose vocabulary
has slowly gathered treasure from the
lived experience of a people, from the
joy and grief of its poets and the
thought of its philosophers, and
which have been given their folk
and colour by the innumerable thicks
making up daily life, a particular
kind of daily life. a particular way
of living, in a word, a unique civiliza-
tion.
It would be perilous for Universal
culture to become a kind of vc. 3t
haberdashery counter, where dilet-
tantes could choose at will wht
seemed to them rarest, most curious,
most exotic. And there is Another
kind of uni"ersalism whose victors
would be no less fatal, one in which
the impossible came to pass and all
became interchangeable. There world
be little profit in that save for tea
slothful minds which had created it
by selecting everywhere the items
they thought best calculated to sa-
tisfy the most people most quickly.
and which would necessarily be the
crudest and the worst,
Universalism
j f\ UR heritage is marvellous in itsdiversity and we must lose
none of it. Nevertheless, we must
make it the possession of the whole
world or, at the least, make possible
the interpenetration of cultures

one of another. The first goal to be
attained is sympathy, and, after that.
mutual enrichment ; not a collection
of samples, nor a catalogue, nor an
amalgam of mediocrities, nor some
sort of highest common factor. lit is
not, of course, impossible to break
down the different civilizations into
their prime factors, but it may be
neither so easy nor so quick to re-
build anything strong and viable
from those prime factors, once am-
putated from the living and life-
giving body.
Unesco's object in this field is in
very truth to breathe into each cul-
ture the spirit of universalism, by
inspiring it with the desire for un-
derstanding and exchange ; by pre-
senting to its gaze the peculiar qua-
lities of other cultures in brotherly
emulation, to lead it to awareness of
its own, and to an effort to pro-
claim and to perfect those special
qualities, avoiding both aggressive'
rivalry with others and the sacrifice
of its own values to an idol made by
many hands.
Classics and Culture.
IH OWEVER difficult this task mybe, it is not beyond our chiev. -
ment, for every culture, national or
regional, has its roots in Man, a ;.. act
no better medium can be found for
the fellowship of men than the fel-
lowship of cultures. To become ccn-
vinced of this, it is enough to glare
at the classics most typical of each
culture.
What could be more typically Spa n-
ish than the character of : CJ ! 1
Quixote, what more Russian tt,) n
Dostoiewski's characters, more !'-
gentine than Martin Fierro, m :,'

the most completely national ty : ? s
of each literature, are also those b : sot
known beyond the borders of the la-id
that gave them birth, those who, ; ?
universal value is most readily per-
ceived. And the explanation ? Simply
this : it was by seeking out all than
was most original in their tongue
and in the traditions of their ra Je.
by rummaging in the national store,
that the creators of these charac-
ters managed to attain to term :

may be at variance on the surface

B UNESCO COURIER SUPPLEMENT March 1949
the similarity of their ultimate ob-
jec-ive impels them af'least as
strongly to come together.
L'quilibrium Between Symbols
II N wartime everything becomes thesymbol of conflict, right down to
the best-known characters of a na-
tic i's classics. Yet not all the symbols
figit for the regime in power in
their motherlands. An example I
have in mind is how in the last war
the first bars of the Fifth Symphony
acquired the status of the anthem
of democracy. Beethoven against
Hitler !'
Can the sight of such protagonists
fall to teach us faith in the incorrup-
tib'e power of culture ? Above-and
bel,) w-the governments there are
two forces whose conjunction is ever
possible : they are, firstly, the peoples
themselves and, secondly, the heroes
in whom the peoples see the in-
cat nation of their race.
Thus it was that Paul Valery's
luc d genius led him to say that peace
is primarily a state of equilibrium
between symbols. It ii the reason,
too, why, at the war's end, the United
Nations resolved to set up an
organization"for the purpose of ad-
vancing, through the educational
and scientific and cultural relations
of the peoples of the world, the ob-
jectives of international peace and of
the common welfare of mankind..."
It is interesting to read again the
preamble to the Constitution signed
in London on 16 November, 1945. This
preamble says, among other things :
That ignorance of eaWL other's
ways and lives has been a com-
mon cause, throughout the his-
tory of mankind, of that suspi-
cion and mistrust between the
peoples of the world through which
their differences have all too often
broken into war ;
That a peace based exclusively
upon the political and economic
arrangements or governments
would now be a peace which could
secure the unanimous, lasting and
sincere support of tie peoples of
the world, and that the peace must
therefore be founded upon the in-
tellectual and moral solidarity of
mankind ;
That the wide diffusion of cul-
ture, and the education of Human-
ity for justice and liberty and
peace are indispensable to the
dignity of man and constitute a
sacred duty which all the nations
must fulfil in a sp : rit of mutual
assistance and concern.
For these reason-the text goes
on-the States parties to this
Constitution, believing in full and
equal opportunities for education
for all, an unrestricted pursuit of
objective truth, and in the free
exchange of ideas and knowledge,
are agreed and determined to
develop and increase the means of
communication between their
peoples and to employ these means
for the purposes of mutual under-
standing and a truer and more
perfect knowledge of each other's
lives.
Unesco's Ac1lÏevements
HAT then, has Unesco done
V two translate so rich a pro-
gramme into acts ? I will try to tell
you briefly.
In the field of Reconstruction,
Unesco has first sought to establish
the educational, scientific and cul-
tural needs of the war-devastated
countries ; The Secretariat keeps im-
portant information on this subject
regularly up to date and disseminates
it through various publications, such
as the monthly"Bulletin of Recons-
truction", which appears in English,
French and Spanish, and the"Book
of Needs", of which two volumes
have been issued. Illustrated booklets
have been published on special sub-
jects, for example"Universities in
Need", and"Suggestions for Science
Teachers in War-Devastated Coun-
tries". The last in particular has prov-
ed extremely valuable even in coun-
tries not devastated by the war, but
where public educatior still possesses
only rudimentary equipment. It is at
the request of those countries that
we are now undertaking to issue
Spanish. Chinese and Arabic editions
of this pamphlet. Other pamphlets
are being prepared on devastated
libraries, laboratories and art gal-
leries. A documentary film has been
made on university reconstruction,
and a very moving exhibition of
photographs of children in Europe
has just been sent to America.
g-\ N the basis of all this informa-tion Unesco has helped to
launch and co-ordinate nation-
al and international campaigns to
collect the money for meeting such
enormous needs. It has promoted the
establishment of, and furnished the
Secretariat for the Temporary Inter-
national Council for Educational Re-
construction, which groups together
the chief private organizations con-
cerned in this b : g task.
We owe thanks to Belgium for
having found 10 % of the funds
placed at our disposal, as the result
of the campaign by the Belgian Com-
mittee of U. N. A. C.
From its own budget Unesco finds
the means of providing emergency
aid : in 1948 $395, 000 and in 1949
$175, 000 were devoted to the purchase
of teach ; ing equipment. This year a
special effort will be made on be-
half of the 200, 000 children among
the 800, 000 refugees from the Middle
East.
However, the problem cannot be
solved simply by sending material,
however necessary. The havoc
wrought by the war in people's minds,
and especially in children's minds, is
even more serious than the material
destruction. The problem of the re-
education of child victims of the war
is one of those to which Unesco in-
tends to devote closest concern.
In the first place we have to res-
tore to these children and young
people, whose minds are obsessed by
so much violence and poisoned by
so much hatred, the desire to re-
construct and to share the experience
of human brotherhood. In 1947
Unesco sponsored four international
volunteer work camps in Belgium.
France, Czechoslovakia and Poland.
In 1948, it called a conference of or-
ganizations interested in the work
of these camps, to co-ordinate and
back up what they were doing. Books
were collected and distributed among
thirty work camps. In 1948 more than
50, 000 volunteers furnished 3, 000, 000
hours of work in 135 camps.
Further, Unesco sponsored in 1948
a conference of Directors of Chil-
dren's Villages, which met at Trogen
in Switzerland and ended in the
establishment of a special Federation
for the development of this undertak-
ing. The vice-president of the Fe-
deration's governing body is a coun-
tryman of yours, M. de Cooman.
Jr OME other countries escaped de-vastation by the war, but have
for centuries been denied their birth-
right or otherwise victimized by the
facts of History. It is to those coun-
tries that we are applying our pro-
gramme of Fundamental Education.
In the valley of Marbial, in Haiti, a
pilot project is now being carried out
in co-operation with other Specializ-
ed Agencies of the United Nations,
like the Food and Agriculture Organ-
ization and the World Health Or-
ganization. Begun last year, this ex-
periment quickly stirred the en-
thusiasm of the local inhabitants, it
is in full swing and has already fur-
nished valuable lessons.
That is only one example and, in
this and in all the other fields Unes-
co's activity is not confined to under-
takings for which it assumes direct
responsibility. It has made it its
business to stimulate, aid and ad-
vise a whole series of experiments
and kindred projects organized by
others, if it is only by ensuring the
exchange of information and special-
ized knowledge.
In countries where education is
well developed, practical study
courses, also known as seminars,
have proved an excellent method of
joint comparison and research. The
first course was held at Sevres, out-
side Paris, in 1947. Its subject was
the examination of studies best
adapted for developing international
understanding, and its success en-
couraged Unesco to repeat and ex-
tend the experiment.
Last year four seminars were ar-
ranged simultaneously at Ashridge
(England), on the training of teach-
ers, at Adelphi College (United States)
on teaching about the United Nations
at Caracas (Venezuela) on certain
educational problems peculiar to
Latin America, and at Podebrady
(Czechoslovakia). For this year two
such courses are being prepared, one
will be at New Delhi and will be
devoted to adult education in rural
areas, the other in Brazil where the
subject will be the campaign against
illiteracy. These international courses
are not only useful for the perfecting
of educational methods, but also
constitute highly encouraging ex-
periments in international under-
standing.
Educational Missions
A POTHER technique characterlz-
A ing Unesco's educational work
is that of educational missions. Up
to now we had not been able to make
a start, but I am glad to tell you
that this year four countries have
already asked for our help. The first
mission has begun its work in ! she
Philippines where, under the direc-
tion of an American expert it is res-
ponsible for the study of primary
and secondary education. The second
mission, headed by an Englishman,
has just arrived in Bangkok. It is to
advise the Siamese Government in its*
campaign against illiteracy. The
other two missions are now being
fitted up and will proceed, one to
Afghanatan and the other to Syria.
All these missions are sent at the
request of the countries concerned,
which share the expenses with Unes-
co. They are made up of experts
chosen by Unesco from the most
highly qualified specialists in that
field in which they are asked by the
inviting governments for their ad-
vice. Here again international soli-
darity marches side by side with
social advancement.
Certain other achievements or
projects now in the course of plan-
ning I must pass over rapidly, in-
teresting though many of them are.
Thus I can only mention in passing
the establishment of an interna-
tional Universities Office, set up as
a result of the Congress summoned
by Unesco last year at Utrecht in
conjunction with the government
of the Netherlands and which was at-
tended by two hundred universities
from thirty-two countries. Nor can I
do more than name the forthcom-
ing Conference on Adult Education,
which Unesco is arranging in co-
operation with the Danish Govern-
ment to meet in June at Copenhagen.
Belter Textbooks
II j MUST, however, dwell for onemoment on a project particularly
close to my heart. That is the im-
provement of school textbooks, and
when I say improvement I am speak-
ing of a juster presentation of hu-
manity's profound solidarity, both in
time and space.
This is a task which has been long
under contemplation but has been
constantly postponed ; the present
state of the world, however, gives it
an urgency to whic h we can no longer
close our eyes. That is especially true
of history and and geography text-
books, whose authors too often
emphasize the differences between
men far more than their points of
resemblance ; the grandeur of their
common destiny is wantonly distorted
by the weight attached to their con-
flicts.
Let me not be misunderstood. We
are not trying to establish, still less
to impose, uniform textbooks for all
the world. We acknowledge and res-
pect the diversity of national condi-
tions and traditions. All we want to
do is to stimulate and help the res-
ponsible authorities in each country
to undertake on their own account a
revision of school books in the direc-
tion of that international understand-
ing I have just defined. For this
purpose the Secretariat, after very
careful work, is now completing the
formulation of objective criteria and
general advice, from which, we be-
lieve, all may benefit. It is, in the
last resort, for each to undertake his
own reform.
Field Science Offices.
IN the field of the Natural SciencesUnesco has already accomplished
a remarkable task of international
organization.
Since 1947 it has established four
regional offices for international
co-operation-at Cairo, Shanghai,
Delhi and Montevideo-in order to
create closer contacts between scien-
tists and scholars who sometimes work
far from their main centres of re-
search. The functions of these offices
vary with the conditions in each
region : contacts with government
ser. vices, scientific societies and insti-
tutions and individual scientists ;
technical advice, co-ordination of
research work and the mutual com-
munication of results obtained, in-
formation about documentation and
scientific equipment ; census of needs
and the search for the means of
satisfying them, exchanges of inform-
ation and surveys, etc. Now with-
drawn to Shanghai, the East Asia
Office is completing the scheme of
scientific and industrial equipment
left behind by U. N. R. R. A. ; it is dis-
tributing laboratory material among
Chinese institutes. In Southern Asia
the Delhi Office is studying the pos-
sibilities of manufacturing rubber and
penicillin, not for commercial but for
scientific and social purposes. The
Cairo Office has been equally pro-
ductive in the fields of both pure and
applied science.
The Montevideo Office has spent
most of its time on the setting up
of the International Institute of the
Hylean Amazon and its Constitution,
which was signed by the founder
states at the Iquitos Conference held
last August under Unesco's auspices,
is now in course of ratification. This
damp and marshy tropical forest,
rich in raw materials, oilfields, hevea,
medicinal and nutritional plants and
broken up by big rivers, extends over
more than 5, 000 kilometres in length
and covers more than 7, 000, 000 square
kilometres between the Andes and the
Atlantic.
While respecting the customs of the
natives, who are struggling for sur-
vival in these deadly areas, the Ins-
titute's aim is to open up these in-
comparable reserves to the work of
man. There is a host of problems to
be faced, ethnological'and sociolo-
gical, zoological, botanical and clima-
tological, health problems, agricultu-
ral and hydrobiological problems, not
to mention the political difficulties
in the way of essential international
co-operation. Through the Institute
and helped by the enthusiastic aid of
several countries and specialized
organizations, Unesco's business is to
solve these problems. Upon the suc-
cess of its efforts depend in great
measure the opening up and the ra-
tional development of a vast stretch
of territory.
Conservation of Natural Resources
II N a similar connexion I mustrefer to the efforts of Unesco
towards the protection of nature and
the conservation of natural resources.
Last year's conference at Fontaine-
bleau led to the establishment of an
International Union for the Protec-
tion of Nature, to which our help Is
promised. At present we are actively
engaged, in conjunction with the
E. C. O. S. O. C., in preparing for a very
important conference to be held next
August on the conservation of natu-
ral resources, this being one of the
most burning and also most difficult
problems of our time. Lastly. I must
not fail to mention the Congress
which, thanks to the hospitality of
the Belgian Government, will meet
in April in your capital and which,
jointly organized by Unesco and the
World Health Organization, aims at
preparing for the establishment of a
permanent Council for the co-ordina-
tion of international congresses of
the medical sciences. If there is one
field in which humanity should
affirm its solidarity, it is surely in
the campaign against disease.
Social Sciences
ITH regard to the Social
V {f Sciences, we have experienced
much dificulty in framing a pro-
gramme and putting it into execution.
Besides, the problems here are more
complex, the methods less approved
and the collaboration of specialists is

of more recent date. Nevertheless,
here also our work is beginning to
bear fruit.
Economists, sociolog ; sts and special-
ists in political science and compa-
rative law, invited from the different
countries, are organizing themselves
in response to our appeal and with
our aid. The Secretariat in its turn,
helped by many outside consultants,
is undertaking various surveys which
before the year is out, will result in
publications of a quality which I
hope will do us credit.
Among these studies I will mention
two on the state and the method-
ology of the political sciences ; a vol-
ume on"Aggressive Nationalism"
(with chapters written by eight
savants representing five countries) ;
a series of monographs on the"Way
of Life" (from eight countries), on
the ideas which people of one coun-
try hold concerning their own and
other nations (in nine countries), *and
finally on the methods for changing
the mental attitudes of communities
in their relations with one another.
All these very concrete studies will go
beyond purely scientific investiga-
tion ; they wil aim at developing a
rational understanding of human
groups such as may lead to better
inspired work in the cause of closer
international understanding, toler-
ance and peace.
Translation of classics
IN the kindred field of philosophyand associated sciences, interna-
tional organization is still farther
advanced. Last month, on Unesco's
initiative, an international council of
philosophy and humanistic sciences
was set up. That success I am glad
to be able to associate with the name
of this city, which has once again
manifested its concern for enterpr ; ses
serving the cause of international
co-operation.
In the field of the Arts, the Inter-
national Theatre Institute, a creation
of Unesco, began its life on 1 January
of this year with a detailed pro-
gramme of work.
A great deal of work is being done
as regards translations. A list of
translations and translators has been
methodically prepared and put at the
disposal of Member States, and
Unesco also has in hand a programme
of translations on its own account.
These are translations of the clas-
sics and of important classical works
which, whilst being truly representa-
tive of the culture from which they
originate have also, by reason of their
value and wide appeal, attained uni-
versal interest. These books must be
made accessible to all men in all lan-
guages, for they are a common treas-
ury of culture and spiraual libera-
tion. Unesco has initiated a two-fold
programme which will be spread over
several years, beginning in 1949.
One part of this programme, which
concerns the Arab world, will include
the translation into Arabic of world
classics and the translation of Arabic
classics into several well known lan-
guages. The other part is more parti-
cularly concerned with the transla-
tion into English and French of the
most important works of Latin Amer-
ican literature. Both will provide
plenty of material for fruitful intel-
lectual relations.
.-The same may be said with regard
to the visual arts and music, thanks
to the collections of reproductions
and recordings for which Unesco is
organizing dissemination and ex-
changes on a large scale.
In the field of museums, where we
work in close collaboration with the
International Council of Museums,
Unesco has made a notable contri-
bution in the publication of a quarter-
ly review entitled"Museum", of
which the second number has just
been issued.
In this connexion the programme
adopted at Beirut includes an simper-
tant resolution regarding measures
to be taken for ensuring the preserva-
tion, and possibly the restoration, of
historical sites and monuments. Thins
seems to me to be a duty which is
incumbent upon all civilized nations
- a duty involving both respect for
the past, to which we owe all that
we are, and the education of future
generations to whom we must pass
on the precious heritage of civiliza-
tion, of which we are the trustees.
Books and Libraries
() UR Organization has from thebeginning taken a particular
interest in libraries. For nearly two
years the Libraries Division has
published each month a Bulletin for
Libraries which is sent free of charge
to 6, 500 libraries. This Bulletin has
been most useful in connexion with
the re-establishment of contacts in-
terrupted by the war. A very success-
ful Summer School for Librarians was
organized last year in Manchester
and London. Twenty countries were
represented.
The most interesting of the projects
that should be mentioned is, however,
the institution of an international
Book Coupons Scheme, which enables
buyers in"soft currency"countries to
pay in their own currency for orders
placed with booksellers in"hard cur-
rency"countries, through the inter-
mediary of Unesco acting as a clear-
ing house thanks to its own resources.
The scheme began to work on an
experimental basis at the beginning
of December ; it concerns thirteen
countries and has a ceiling of $150,-
000, of which $50, 000 have been re-
mitted in the form of coupons to ten
countries. Its success was immediate
and striking. France's share, for
example, was absorbed at once. In
Czechoslovakia, the distribution of
coupons gave rise to official demon-
strations. The effect was the same
in the United States of America ;
numerous orders for. foreign books
were placed at once.
As regards copyright-in which
Belgium has always taken an active
interest-a methodical enquiry has
been carried out during the last two
years. A great many documents have
been collected. We have just pub-
lished the second number of an In-
formation Bulletin which will form a
link between specialists on this sub-
ject and the numerous professional
associations concerned. Once the
work of collecting documents and
making contacts is finished, we shall
have arrived at the stage when the
question of a Universal Convention on
Copyright should be considered-and
it will be considered.
The Department of Exchange of
Persons published last month an
International Handbook of Fellow-
ships, which concerns twenty coun-
tries and in which more than 10, 000
fellowships and other facilities for
studies abroad are listed. Unesco now
has its own programme of fellow-
ships, however, paid for either by our
Budget or by endowments whose
administration is entrusted to us. The
number of fellowships for which
Unesco is directly responsible is now
220. They were at first reserved for
war-devastated countries but will be
extended this year to economicalìy
backward countries and trustee terri-
tories.
II') UT our greatest efforts must beHe devoted to mass communication
- by press, radio and films-if we are
to : fulfil our task of promot : ng inter-
national understanding and better
social conditions.
Work in this domain was begun by
a far-reaching enquiry into the tech-
nical needs of the press, radio and
cinema. This enquiry was carried out
in 1947 in twelve war-devastated
countries of Europe and the Far East
and has since been steadily extended
to other parts of the world. Seventeen
countries in Europe, Asia and Amer-
ica were covered in 1948. Fifteen
others will be covered this year, in-
cluding some in Africa. The results
of this enquiry have been published
in two volumes which constitute a
mine of information such as has
rarely been collected hitherto.
On the basis of this information, a
Committee of Experts which meets
annually has recommended a series of
measures designed to remedy the lack
both of equipment and of trained
personnel which appears to be gen-
eral. It must be admitted that our
efforts have not so far produced any
tangible results.
An Organization like ours is in
fact somewhat poorly equipped for
overcoming the economic, financial,
and even political, obstacles with
which this problem bristles. But we
do not despair of making ourselves
heard, once it has been realized by
the professionals and by public opin-
ion that our cause is also theirs.
This is the spirit in which we are
now busily preparing a series of
pamphlets on special subjects, special
that is as regards their technical
terms, but of very wide range, such as
the professional training of journal-
ists, the production and distribution
of newsprint, the use of radio in edu-
cation and the manufacture of cheap
receiving sets and cinema projectors.
And this is the spirit in which Unesco
is preparing to take part in the Con-
ference on Wood and Wood Products
convened by the Food and Agricul-
ture Organization next April in Mont-
real, at which we intend to put for-
ward the extremely important ques-
tion of the production and distribu-
tion of paper.
Press, Radio and Film
A S regards the free flow of infor-
, 4` mation, the Conference at
Beirut adopted the text of a Conven-
tion whereby visual and auditory
material (gramophone records and
films) of an educational, scientific or
cultural nature may henceforth be
imported free of customs duty. This
is the first international agreement
to be drawn up by Unesco. Other
'agreements are already under con-
sideration, for it seems to me that
an inter-governmental Organization
like ours possesses here a legal tool
which has perhaps not been suffi-
ciently used in the past. We are
engaged, in particular, on a draft
convention concerning the duty-free
importation of books, newspapers and
periodicals, which has been drawn up
by a Belgian expert and is sure of a
welcome in this stronghold of free
exchange.
Finally, a special service has been
set up to ensure a fuller use of the
immense informative and persuasive
possibilities of the press, radio and
cinema for the promotion of the
ideals which Unesco was created to
serve. After a long, hard preparatory
period, this service has at last
reached the productive stage. A week-
ly bulletin of information suitable for
broadcasting on educational, scien-
tific and cultural events and topics-
the most important events and top : cs
of mankind's real mission, and yet
the least known, the least appreciated
- has recently been published. It is
sent free of charge to some hundreds
of broadcasting stations throughout
the world and we hope that a good
deal of its contents will be dissemin-
ated. I should like to mention that
this bulletin is the result of recom-
mendations made to Unesco by
broadcasting directors from seven-
teeQ countries who met in Paris, in
October 1948, under the chairmanship
of M. Fleischmann.
We mean to concentrate this year
on two main subjects :
1. Food and People ;
2. Human Rights.
I have already touched on the first
of these subjects in connexion with
the conservation of natural resources.
The second sums up, justifies and
'conditions all the rest.
Human Rights
I N 10 December 1948, the GeneralAssembly of the United Nations
approved, in Paris, the Universal De-
claration of Human Rights. Unesco
was bound to welcome with enthu-
siasm a document of such scope. The
General Conference at Beirut ins-
tructed me, by acclamation, to stimu-
late the dissemination of information
about this declaration and to advo-
cate its inclusion in the teaching
regarding the United Nations given
in schools.
In accordance with this decision, I
suggested to the governments of
Member States and the National
Commissions that, in order to impress
on the minds and hearts of young
people the memory of the historic
moment when the value of the
human person was universally pro-
claimed, the 10th December should be
observed each year in all school as a
day of recognition of the principles of
the liberty and dignity of Man.
I added, in particular, in my com-
munication that the world was long-
ing for an era of peace which would
enable every man to develop his
creative powers to the full for the
benefit of all and in the cause of
progress. Peace and justice require,
Indeed, above all things the streng-
thening of that intellectual and
moral solidarity without which, as
Unesco's Constitution states, the eco-
nomic and political arrangements of
governments would not secure the
unanimous, lasting and sincere sup-
port of the peoples of the world. One
thing is needful if this solidarity is
to spring from a real harmony of
minds and not from a passive inter-
dependence of wishes : respect for the
human being in his essential integ-
rity and his multiple diversity.
Unesco therefore finds support and
encouragement in the Universal De-
claration of Human Rights. The
recognition of the principles affirmed
in the Declaration and the dissemi-
nation of those principles through
teaching will help to strengthen the
faith of every human being in the
dignity of his existence and to foster
the fraternal impulse which bids him
join with all his fellows to save by
united action the heritage of civiliza-
tion.
I have given a rough outline of
Unesco's task. It will be difficult, no
doubt, for obstacles arise in our path
at every step. But if we succeed, our
success, important enough in itself,
will also be a pledge of the success
of the entire international system
which originated in the Charter of
San Francisco.
Fellowship Between Nations
"HEN we met in London, in 1945,
"<'''f to establish Unesco, I ex-
plained what I thought was the most
burning problem of our time : how to
raise the standard of the masses
without lowering the dignity of the
individual. May I recall the words I
used on that occasion ? Never have
we been so deeply indebted to the
ordinary people, whose mute heroism
has once again been the means of
saving the human race ; and never
have the ordinary people been so in-
debted to their leaders. Without the
General Staffs of engineering and
science, how could they have secured
the triumph of their ideal ? This two-
fold debt now owed by the world
(both to the general public and to the
men who forged the very instruments
of victory) lays upon us the duty of
trying to construct some form of so-
ciety in which the masses will not
be neglected in favour of exceptional
figures which may arise, any more
than individuality will be smothered
by the progress of the masses. The
only solution is perhaps to reconcile
these rival claims, keeping in mind
the need to replace the conflict be-
tween the Rights of the individual
and the Rights of the community by
a social structure in which the best
citizen is also the most complete man.
I see that I have given there a defi-
nition of the ultimate aim of Uneseo
That aim is to promote, through edu-
cation, science and culture, such
fellowship between the nations of the
world that each country will give its
highest esteem to those of its sons
who best serve the cause of humanity.
Today, when the Belgian Commis-
sion for Co-operation with Unesco has
honoured me by its welcome, what
else could I wish for than to see all
its members working, each in his own
sphere, to hasten the advent of that
new man, the perfect citizen of his
own country and perfect citizen of
the world ?
Belgium has always advocated
peaceful settlement in times of strife.
This country, so heroic in its resis-
tance, has nevertheless always been
prompt to lend its voice to counsels
of wisdom and persuasion. Unesco
therefore has every reason to expect
from it most valuable assistance. Your
help will encourage us to persevere.
In conclusion, I would like to quote
the noble words of one of your great
poets who said, forty years ago :
"If, in the evening, you climb a
fountain, you see the trees, houses,
village church, meadows, orchards,
the highroad, even the river, getting
smaller and smaller until at last they
are swallowed up in the encroaching
shades of the valley. But the tiny
points of light which twinkle in the
blackest night, wherever there are
human habitations, do not grow
dimmer as you climb. With every step
that brings you nearer to the summit,
you discern more and more lights in
the villages sleeping below. So it is
with our spiritual lights when we look
at life from a higher plane."
In our day, so full of encroaching
shadows, we have come to realize
how precious are those spiritual
lights. Let us see to it that they are
kept burning : this is our most im-
perative task.

D UNESCO COURIER SUPPLEMENT March 1949
Torres Bodet's Sorbonne Address
On Declaration of Human Rights
We publish below the full text
of the address delivered on
February 24, 1949, by Dr. Jaime
Torres Bodet, in the large
amphitheatre of ttz, e Sorbonne
on the occasion of the solemn
consecration of the Universal
Declaration of Human Rights,
in the presenc. e of the President
of the French Republic, M. Vin-
cent Auriol, M. Yvon Delbos,
French Minister of National
Education, M. Paul-Boncour,
/orTfter Prime Minister, and M.
René Cassin, Vice-President of
the Conseil d'Etat.
AY I begin by saying how
...., proud I feel to be here
among you on such an oc-
casion.
Within the walls of the University
of Paris, the League of the Rights of
Man and of the Citizen today pays
tribute to what the United Nations
have achieved in their determination
to frame a Universal Declaration of
Human R : ghts. Unesco wholeheart-
edly joins them in that tribute. The
day when our Beirut Conference
learned that the United Nations As-
sembly had adopted this Declaration
the delegates with one voice express-
ed their w'sh that Unesco should
bend its efforts towards publicizing
among all classes of society a docu-
ment which holds out such bright
hopes for humanity. On 29 December
I called upon the Member States of
the Organization, to participate in
this work of disseminatlon. Of all
the answers to my appeal, today's
demonstration is one of the most
significant. In saying that, I am
thinking of the enhanced value
which attaches to the voice of France
by v. rtue of its history, a history that
has been wholly devoted to the ser-
vice of a civilization in which man
shall be able to express himself both
individually and collectively.
Nothing in your country clams to
lie outside the domain of man, neither
the beauty of your monuments, nor
the ordering of your institutions, nor
the clarity of the most famous among
your written works. It would be dif-
ficult to offer mankind a body of
contributions to humanity better cal-
culated than the sum of yours to.
meet the call for freedom and inte-
grity.
Other cultures have attained in
philosophy, in the arts and in litera-
ture, heights which command our ad-
miration. But in that mental atmo-
sphere, lucid yet not frigid and ima-
ginative without being Utopian.. which
is the climate of France, there is
never the feeling that other, cultures
are fore. gn. The realization is ever
present that there can be no health-
ier or more solid foundation for the
peace of the world than agreement
among men in the spirit of justice
and truth. In that spirit of justice
and truth I recognize alike the most
enduring aspect of your striv. ngs
and Unesco's essential goal.
Rights and Dllties
lr HE League of the Rights df Manand of the Citizen as always
been an active force in assuring, the
triumph of that spirit. Its vigilance
has never relaxed ; it has never lack-
ed courage or resolution in denounc-
ing injustice and demanding redress
tor the innocent.
The Universal Declaration of the
Rights of Man has focussed your
labours and our own efforts in their
true perspective, which is the wish
for universal progress. I do not claim
to pass judgment on this Declara-
tion in its details. I am not unaware
of the reservations and even the cri-
ticams that have been made about
it. Moreover, every right connotes a
corresponding duty. Perhaps, from
this standpoint, not enough import-
ance has been attached to the sug-
gestion made by Mahatma Gandhi
on 5 May, 1947, to my predecessor :
"I learned from my illiterate but
very wise mother", wrote the apostle
of non-violence,"that the rights
worth preserving are those which re-
sult from duty done. Thus the very
right to live only becomes ours when
we fulfil our duty as citizens of the
world".
Two Decisive Questions
IH ERE I wish only to put twoquestions, but they are decisive
ones, and ones which each of us no
doubt asks himself. The first is this :
What will be the practical value of
a. Declarat : on which makes no pro-
vision for legal sanctions ? Would it
not have been better to bind the
signatory States by a Convention
which would have had the force of
a contract ? And the other is this :
What interpretation will each people
put on the Declaration-What. mean-
ing will be given in each country to
such general concepts as freedom of
expression and information ?
Do we not run the risk of seeing
the political security of the State in-
voked to justify curtailment of that
freedom ? Worse still, have we not
cause to fear lest certain men, with : n
a political party or government ad-
ministration may take it on them-
selves to decide of their own author-
ity where the polit : cal security of the
State beg : ns and ends ? And. at the
opposite pole, do we not also run
the risk of seeing the masses of the
people acknowledge that freedom of
expression and information is effec-
tively secured in a society in which
news, even though it escapes govern-
ment censorship, rema : ns the raw
material of an industry and trade
which are often subordinated to the
interests of what are in fact mono-
polies ?
These few remarks are by no means
intended to detract from the im-
portance of the Declaration, but
rather to make it clear how closely
Unesco's very future is bound up
with its application. In the absence
of a certain unity in the conceptions
which the various peoples form of the
principles of culture, the practical
results of any international declara-
tion can at best be only uncertain
and precar : ous. That is why, at the
moment, I am not unduly perturbed
by some of its shortcomings.
In the present state of the world,
a more coherent and ambitious mani-
festo would have been no more than
a hypothetical forecast without any
grip on reality. The very thought of
reinforcing the Declaration by a list
of penalties or of g : ving it the legal
character of a convention is a for-
cible reminder to us of the use which
the more favoured countries could
make of the decree of an interna-
tional tribunal, always ready to sum-
mon before it States which are eco-
nomically and milltarity weak, but
usually much less ready to put strong-
er States in the dock.
Á Proclamation of honour
im* HE Universal Declaration of theRights of Man is, in my opinion,
the richest in promise of all the in-
ternational texts to which the govern-
ments have subscribed since 1945 in
order to give life to the San Fran-
cisco Charter and to create a firm
bond between that Charter and the
Constitution of Unesco. It is the first
international manifesto which lists
the rights of the individual and
clearly states the conditions which
all States claiming to respect the
freedom and dignity of the human
personality are required to observe.
It is a proclamation of man's honour.
It comes at the right time to a world
where in all spheres collective forces
are uniting to destroy the human
being, whether with the object of
propagating the creed of a regime or
of preserving a state of society favour-
able to the minorities possessing
power and wealth. It is an urgent
appeal to remind governments that
man exists, that he is not an auto-
maton at'the beck of systems of
political or financial domination, and
that he must be considered as an
end and not as a means, as the one
end which interests each of us to the
same degree.
Such an alarm call brings us a
message from all our brothers, white
and black, Asiatic and Indian, learn-
ed and ignorant, rich and poor. It
must resound in all such precincts
as these, which have been built to
house intelligence, to safeguard man's
creative power, his frail destiny as
a"thinking reed", free and respon-
sible.
T he Seed of Progress
II T is not by chance that the Uni-versity of Paris placed at the
disposal of the League of the Rights
of Man the famous building from
which she dispenses education so
conducive to strengthening the work
of Unesco. We, too, feel in a measure
the beneficiaries of its activity, se-
cure in the knowledge that we also
are pledged to the course which will
help to shed light in that most vul-
nerable, and for that reason often
most inaccessible of citadels, the
heart of man.
But let us be quite clear. Man's
assent to what is best in men-their
capacity for compassion and under-
standing-unfortunately does not
depend solely on intelligence. That ; t
assent is innate in Man and is, as
it were, the seed of his progress. If it
is true that science and culture form
the most favourable climate for the
growth of this seed, it must not be
forgotten that science and culture
are, by nature and vocation, instru-
ments of peace. They must there-
fore dedicate themselves, selfessly
and without reserve, to improving the
lot of the masses. Today, when the
world is passing through a material
and moral crisis, an inner circle of
intellectual Brahmins might open a
dark gulf between man and men, be-
tween peace and justice, between the
intellect and civilization.
A Boy and A Map
AL.'AY I repeat to you a story
which was popular among
diplomats before the war ? An Eng-
lish university don had invited to
his home a few of his intellectual
friends. But their conversation was
continually interrupted by one of the
host's sons, a boy of six or seven,
who kept on pestering the guests
with questions. In order to get rid
of him, his father thought he would
set him a game taking some time.
He tore up a large map of the world
which was lying on the table and
told the boy not to come back until
he had stuck the map together again.
He thought he would get rid of him
in this easy way for some consider-
able time.
He was greatly surprised when the
child returned a few minutes later
with the work completed.
They were not long in discovering
the secret of the young cartographer.
The map had been printed on paper,
on the other side off'which was the
silhouette of a man standing erect.
To put the pieces in order, the child
had no had to rely on his knowledge
of geography, no doubt very inade-
quate. but on something much more
tangible, the visible structure of
human beings. Thus, by reassembling
the picture of the man. he had reas-
sembled the map of the world.
Is there not an important lesson
for us in this story ?
It is only by thinking of Man and
by endeavouring to refashion him (to
refashion his conscious mind, his
love of good) that we shall succeed
one day, without too many hesita-
tions and errors, in giving a new
political contour to the earth, and
in remaking the social and economic
map of the contemporary world.
Towards'If'orld Citizenship
HAT is the duty of, Those who,like you in this University and
ourselves of Unesco, are devoting
their efforts to winning Man, through
culture for the common adventure
of humanity. Unesco's main task is
to find men, individuals, among the
citizens of all nations, among the in-
habitants of all countries. Individuals
speaking different languages, sing-
ing different anthems, rallying to
different banners, but all of whom,
despite the unfortunate disparity of
their resources, endeavour to over-
come the same anxieties : poverty.
fear, ignorance and disease, to the
end that economic and cultural con-
ditions more equitable for all may
enable them to reach self-expression.
Yes, we are looking for individuals.
But amid so many threats and com-
promises, where are they to be found ?
During the war they disappeared,
swallowed up by the Moloch of the
Army. Today, after the signinf of
armistices, when'peace should be
established, we still hear the groans
of the individual behind the ram-
parts of narrow nationalisms.
That voice is drowned by the din
of every kind of propaganda. Often
it reaches us distorted by those who
should be most concerned to trans-
mit it to us faithfully. And, what is
most appalling, the absence of the
individual, his submission to the
dictates of factions, endangers the
working of an international system
whose final end is indeed a universal
policy and economy, but which must
nevertheless rely on local, national or
even regional realities.
Unesco has entered the lists against
the perils of this disappearance, this
submission of'the Individual and has
engaged all its resources in the task
of awakening in the conscience of
the peoples the inner summons to
world citizenship. In such a task the
help of the intellectuals of France
will be of great value to us.
A Solemn Responsibility
The Universal Declaration of Hu-
man Rights confronts us with'a
solemn responsibility which we can-
not evade : it is for all of us to ensure
that each of these rights becomes a
reality in all circumstances and in
all places. It is not by decrees that
we shall succeed, but by a common
effort, in which each will contribute
his part, whether by understandin
or by persuasion. For, in the words of
one of the greatest poets of our time,
"the individuality of Man is price-
less, for it is that alone which enables
us to realize the universal".
Monsieur Ie President de la Reps-
blique :
My last words are addressed to
you, whose presence today, in the
amphitheatre of a University so dear
to us all, has the significance of 3-
testimony of which the world has
never been unheedful.
You show us that France is proud
to acknowledge Man's creative
mission.
Nothing could be in closer har-
mony with the traditions of the
people to whom the world owes the
glorious principles of  789. And the
Universal Declaration of the United
Nations is inspired in many of its
clauses by those principles.
Testimony of such authority is to
Unesco both an encouragement and
a promise. I am grateful for that en-
couragement and deeply stirred by
that prrunisa
