/Tmay be asked why it is necessary to
pay constant andperiodically renew¬
ed attention to such an evident form
ofbarbarity as racism. The answer is that,
throughout the world, racism is forever
appearing in new guises, adding new
forms of oppression to the long tally that
already exists and adopting new strategies,
each more violent than its predecessors;
we have a duty to analyse and stand firm
against each of these new manifestations.
The "Other", the outsider, is usually
perceived as a strange being, either
because of his appearance (which is at¬
tributed to his race) or because of his
social position, his poverty, his way of
life, his privileges or his potential. But we
are also coming to learn that the "Other"
offers us, as though through a mirror, a
vision of ourselves which frightens us.
Only by overcoming this aggressive fear
can we help to conquer the racism it
engenders.
Studies show that this fear of the
"Other" is acquired and is the result of
the interplay of social structures. But it
must be stressed that racism in its contem¬
poraryforms did not appearfortuitously.
It is the product of- a historical
phenomenon: the economic exploitation
(and its ideological justification) of the
labour of colonized peoples.
Pushed to the extreme and institu¬
tionalized, this colonial racism has reach¬
ed its ultimate stage in apartheid, a doc¬
trine which constitutes a danger not only
for the peoples ofsouthern Africa butfor
thepeace ofthe whole world. It is in every
sense a crime against humanity.
This is why the struggle against racism
is one of the major concerns of liberation
movements throughout the world. The
emancipation of dominated peoples in¬
volves the defence of their cultural identi¬
ty, which in turn is indissociable from
their political, economic and social
freedom. Fostering the cultures of the
world, respecting their diversity and their
equal right to development, is to speed up
the spread and interplay of knowledge
which will turn back the infamous tide of
racism.
In this struggle science cannot remain
neutral. Scientists categorically reject any
claim that "races" can be defined on the
basis of conclusive genetic data. As a
result of thousands of years of cross¬
breeding, genetic differences between in¬
dividuals or groups of individuals can be
much greater than those between the so-
called "races", which have been classified
as such on the basis of meaningless
criteria. And science refutes even more
strongly the notion that there is any link
between "racial" hereditary
characteristics and cultural traits.
Unesco plays a leading role in this
struggle to defend the truth against op¬
pression and prejudice, as it is une¬
quivocally required to do by the terms of
the Preamble to and Article 1 of its con¬
stitution, adopted in London on 16
November 1945, which solemnly declares
that: "Thepurpose of the Organization is
to contribute to peace andsecurity bypro¬
moting collaboration among the nations
through education, science and culture in
order to further universal respect for
justice, the rule of law andfor the human
rights and fundamental freedoms..." of
all "... the peoples of the world, without
distinction of race, sex, language or
religion. "

RACE, PREJUDICE
AND MYTH
by Michel Leiris
IT may be asked what is the origin
of the prejudice behind the at¬
tempt to classify certain human
groups as inferior on the ground that
their racial composition is an ir¬
remediable handicap.
The first point which emerges from
any examination of the data of
ethnography and history is that race
prejudice is not universal and is of re¬
cent origin. Many of the societies in-
MICHEL LEIRIS, French poet, essayist and
anthropologist, was formerly Senior Research
Fellow at the Centre National de la Recherche
Scientifique, Paris. His many published works
include an autobiographical tetralogy La Règle
du Jeu, Haut Mal, a collection of poems, and
an ethnological study Afrique Noire. The pre¬
sent text is an extract from his study "Race
and Culture" which appeared in Race, Science
and Society, a collective work published in
1975 by Unesco and George Allen & Unwin.
vestigated by anthropologists do in¬
deed display group pride, but while
the group regards itself as privileged
compared with other groups, it
makes no "racist" claims and, for in¬
stance, is not above entering into
temporary alliances with other
groups or providing itself with
women from them.
Much more than "blood", the uni¬
fying elements are common interests
and a variety of activities conducted
in association. In the majority of
cases such groups are not in fact
"races" if very isolated, they may
at most be homogeneous offshoots
of a race but are merely societies
whose antagonism to other
societies, whether traditional or aris¬
ing from specific questions of in¬
terest, is not biological but purely
cultural.
The peoples whom the Greeks
described as "barbarians" were hot
regarded by them as racially inferior
but as not having attained the same
level of civilization as themselves;
Alexander himself married two Per¬
sian princesses and 10,000 of his
soldiers married Hindus. The main in¬
terest her subject peoples had for
Rome was as a source of tribute and,
since she did not pursue the same
ends of systematic exploitation of
the earth and its population as more
recent imperialisms, she had ho
reason to practise racial discrimina¬
tion against them.
The Christian faith preached the
brotherhood of man arid, while all too
often it fell short of its own principle
in practice, it never evolved a racist
ideology. The Crusades were launch-
"Although there are differences of varying
degrees between contemporary human
societies, the explanation must not be sought in
the racial evolution of mankind (...) which has
produced variations from what was probably
an ancestral stock common to all humanity.
The differences in question are cultural varia¬
tions and cannot be explained either in terms of
biological background or even of the influence
of geographical setting, impossible though it is
to overlook the. importance of this last fac¬
tor..." (Michel Leiris). A superficial reaction to
the sight of these four new born babies (right)
might well be to describe them as being of dif¬
ferent races simply because each has different
colour skin; in fact, this criterion has very little
biological significance (see caption page 26).

ed against the "infidels", the Inquisi¬
tion persecuted heretics and Jews,
and Catholics and Protestants exter¬
minated each other, but in every
case the motives alleged were
religious and not racial.
The picture only begins to change
with the opening of the period of col¬
onial expansion by the European
peoples, when it becomes necessary
to excuse violence and oppression
by decreeing the inferiority of those
enslaved or robbed of their own land
and denying the title of men to the
cheated peoples. (Differences in
customs and the physical stigma of
colour made the task an easy one.)
That the origins of race prejudice
are economic and social becomes
perfectly clear, if we bear in mind
that the first great apostle of racism,
Count de Gobineau, said himself that
he wrote his two notorious Essays to
combat liberalism: the better to de¬
fend the threatened interest of the
aristocratic caste of Europe, against
the rising tide of democracy, he
postulated their descent from a so-
called superior race which he labelled
"Aryan", and for which he
postulated a civilizing mission.
We find the same motive yet again
in the attempt by anthropologists
such as Broca and Vacher de
Lapouge of France and the German
Ammon to demonstrate by an¬
thropometry that class distinctions
reflect differences in race (and hence
are part of the natural order).
However, the amazing intermingling
of human groups which has taken
place in Europe as in the rest of the
The 1978 Declaration on Race
and Racial Prejudice was
adopted by the General Con¬
ference of Unesco at its twen¬
tieth session. It defines racism
as "any theory which involves
the claim that racial or ethnic
groups are inherently superior
or inferior, thus implying that
some would be entitled to
dominate or eliminate others,
presumed to be inferior, or
which bases value judgements
on racial differentiation." The
definition is a broad one since it
continues: "racism includes
racist ideologies, prejudiced at¬
titudes, discriminatory beha¬
viour, structural arrangements
and institutionalized practices
resulting in racial inequality as
well as the fallacious notion
that discriminatory relations
between groups are morally
and scientifically justifiable."

earliest, more loosely struc¬
tured societies? Left, ancient

world since prehistoric times, and
the unceasing movements of popula¬
tion occurring in the countries of
modern Europe are enough to
demonstrate the fatuity of the
attempt.
Later, racism took on the virulent
quality we know so well and, more
particularly in Nazi Germany, ap¬
peared in nationalist guise, though
still remaining in essence an ideology
designed to introduce or perpetuate
a system of caste economically and
politically favourable to a minority,
e.g. by cementing a nation's unity by
the idea of itself as a master race, by
inculcating in colonial populations
the feeling that they are irremediably
inferior to the colonizers, by preven¬

country from rising in the social

mission to combat racism is set
forth in its Constitution, which
was adopted in 1945 and declares
that "the great and terrible war"
which humanity had just endured
had been "made possible by the
denial of the democratic principles
of the dignity, equality and mutual
respect of men, and by the pro¬
pagation, in their place, through ig¬
norance and injustice, of the doc¬
trine of the inequality of men and
races".

iv scale, by eliminating competition in
employment or by neutralizing
popular discontent by supplying the
people with a scapegoat which is
also a profitable source of loot.
There is bitter irony in the fact that
racism developed parallel with the
growth of democracy, which made
an appeal to the new-born prestige of
science necessary for the calming of
consciences uneasy over flagrant
violation of the rights of a section of
mankind or refusal to recognize
those rights.
Racial prejudice is not innate. As
Ashley Montagu has noted: "In
America, where white and black
populations frequently live side by
side, it is an indisputable fact that
white children do not learn to con¬
sider themselves superior to Negro
children until they are told that they
are so." When a tendency to racism
(in the form either of voluntary en¬
dogamy or the more or less ag¬
gressive assertion of one's own
"race's" virtue) is found in an "out¬
cast" group, it should be regarded as
no more than the normal reaction of
the "insulted and injured" against
the ostracism or persecution of
which they are the victims and not as
indicating the universality of racial
prejudice.
There are no races of masters as
opposed to races of slaves: slavery is
not coeval with mankind and only ap¬
peared in societies whose technology
was sufficiently developed to make
slave-owning profitable.
From the sexual point of view,
there appears no evidence of any
repulsion between race and race,
and indeed all the facts so far col
lected demonstrate that there has
been continual cross-breeding bet¬
ween races since the most ancient
times.
Race prejudice is no more
hereditary than it is spontaneous: it
is in the strictest sense a "pre¬
judice", that is, a cultural value
judgement with no objective basis.
Far from being in the order of things
or innate in human nature, it is one of
the myths whose origin is much more
propaganda by special interests than
the tradition of centuries. Since there
is an essential connexion between it
and the antagonisms arising out of
the economic structure of modern
societies, its disappearance will go
hand in hand with the transformation
of their economic structure by the
peoples.

THE
HISTORICAL
ROOTS
by Mikhail Vasilyevkh Kriukov
THROUGHOUT the period of history preceding the
division of society into classes, men had no idea
of the possible innate differences, determined by
nature herself, between ethnic groups. In a society in
which social inequality and oppression were unknown,
conditions did not favour the growth of ideas of ethnic in¬
equality. Besides, primitive man was incapable of imagin¬
ing the cultural and racial differences that exist within the
human race. His "ethnic horizon" was too narrow,
limited as it was to a few neighbouring groups who, more
often than not, displayed similar economic and cultural
patterns and were not notably different in their an¬
thropological appearance.
The main ethnic groups were formed when tribes
merged. They appeared in the last stage of the evolution
of prehistoric society. It was then that for the first time
men's horizons began to extend beyond their former or-
bis terrarum. Their self-awareness was influenced by the
existence outside "their" group of many others who
were foreign and in most cases differed in language, in
their cultural and other peculiarities.
Nevertheless, at this stage of man's history, the pre¬
dominant criterion in the confrontation between "them"
MIKHAIL VASILYEVICH KRIUKOV, Soviet ethnographer, is a staff
member of the Ethnographical Institute of the Academy of Science of
the USSR. He has published many scientific studies including The An¬
cient Chinese Language and The Chinese Kinship System. The article
published here has been extracted from his contribution to a collective
work, Races and Society published in Moscow in 1982.

and "us" was the tribal, not the cultural, one. Provided
it recognized the paramount unity of "our" group, any
tribe could join it and vice-versa. Moreover, at this period
all "foreign" groups taken together were not regarded as
a coherent entity, fundamentally opposed to "us".
The emergence of the first class societies, based on
slavery and the exploitation of slave labour, led to a
notable change in the ethnic awareness of peoples and in
their vision of the world. Slavery by its very nature is con¬
ducive to the transposition of the idea of social inequality
to relations between peoples, and for the first time in
human history, society found itself divided into opposing
groups. Henceforth, people of unusual physical ap¬
pearance and strange culture whom one constantly met
face to face during expeditions of conquest were con¬
sidered as de facto or potential slaves, that is to say, as
inferior beings. Ancient Egyptian wall-paintings and
reliefs often depict foreigners whose appearance differs
from that of the other inhabitants of the Nile valley and
whose postures or positions reflect their status of sub¬
jection, with limited rights.
This contrast introduced by the Egyptians between
themselves, the chosen ones of the gods, and all other
peoples, was directly reflected in their habit of referring
to their neighbours as "barbarians".
Herodotus says that "the Egyptians call all those who
do not speak their language 'barbarians' ". This may
have been true, but it is not impossible that the father of

history was attributing to the Egyptians something which
was, in fact, of Greek origin.
In Greek, the word "barbarian" originally meant "he
who speaks an incomprehensible language". The ap¬
pearance of new meanings for the word (barbarian in the
sense of "rough", "bestial", "uncouth", etc.) is con¬
nected with the idea which emerged of fundamental dif¬
ferences between the Greeks and other peoples.
In the fifth century BC, it was already becoming very
common for the Greeks to regard the "barbarians " as in¬
ferior beings. Euripides for example asserted that här
terem from that worn in the Middle Empire, their
customs, food and drink are different, they speak an in¬
comprehensible language... Consequently a wise
government treats barbarians as wild animals".
The Confucians believed that the territory on which the
Chinese lived was at the centre of the Celestial Empire,
a fact which corresponded to a quite definite arrange¬
ment of the heavenly bodies. These determined the
cosmic forces of "yin" and "yang" which, in turn, gave
birth to the qualities and characteristics of human nature.
In the treatise Discussion about Salt and Iron, dating
13,
This "exotic" tree whose fruit turns
into birds and fish is an illustration
from a botanical treatise published in
France in 1605. The author, who in¬
tended to write a serious scientific
study, mistakenly believed far¬
fetched travellers' tales from distant
countries. Perceptions of peoples
from distant lands have often been
glibly distorted by ethnocentrism,
from which no people in history
seems to have been exempt. In many
geographical works, in the West and
elsewhere, the "foreigner" is
presented as a peculiar, inferior,
scarcely human creature.

barians were incapable of understanding the meaning of
justice "because their intelligence is inferior to that of the
Greeks". This concept achieved its most sophisticated
form in the philosophical system of Aristotle.
As the ideologist of a State founded on slavery, Aristo¬
tle regarded inequality in social rights as a constituent
law of the human being. He assumed man to have two
parts, the divine and the animal. Depending on whichever
of these predominated in him, a man was destined by
nature either to command or to obey.
Contrasting those whose vocation was to rule and
think to the slaves who were there to carry out orders and
to work, Aristotle at the same time assimilated the con¬
cepts of "slave" and "barbarian". He declared that
"barbarians are accustomed to thinking as little as possi¬
ble because they are in a permanent state of servitude".
For the Greek philosopher, the difference between bar¬
barians and Greeks lay in the fact that "from birth the
barbarians are of a more servile nature than the Greeks".
Quite consistently with his own ideas, Aristotle recom¬
mended his disciple Alexander of Macedón to care for the
Greeks as close relations and to treat barbarians like
animals or plants.
This attitude to the question of the "barbarians" had
its equivalent in the ideas which prevailed in ancient
China. In the first century AD, the Han historian Ban Gu
wrote: "the barbarians wear their hair loose and fold their
coats on the left side. They have human faces, and
hearts like those of wild animals. Their costume is dif-
from the first century BC, we read: "In the border pro¬
vinces men live in mountains and gorges, the cosmic
forces in these places are in a state of disharmony, the
land cracks because of the cold and a terrible wind
sweeps across the salt deserts. There, sand and stone
follow each other. The land remains untilled". In another
text the Celestial Empire is described as being "at the
centre of Heaven and Earth, where the cosmic forces are
in complete harmony. The sun and the moon pass to the
South and the Polar Star appears in the North. Because
of the harmonious breathing of the land, everything here
is more true". Hence, the inhabitants of the Celestial Em¬
pire and the "barbarians of the world's four regions"
have "characteristics which it is impossible to change".
An equally egocentric theory of the oikumene (the in¬
habited world) was, as we know, current amongst the
Greeks. They imagined the inhabited world to be like a
circle at whose centre, "half way between the rising and
the setting of the sun", lay Greece. Delphi, which was
situated in the centre of Greece, was "the world's navel".
The idea that "our" people occupied the centre of the
inhabited world and that the surrounding peoples were
inevitably inferior in some way was also widely held
amongst Persians.
According to Herodotus, "the Persians esteem their
immediate neighbours the most highly, then come the
people who live farther away, and so on. Their esteem for
other peoples is a function of distance, the peoples for
whom they have the lowest esteem being those who live
7

the farthest away from them". This attitude to the
classification of ethnic groups implies that somewhere
far away, on the outskirts of the oikumene, people may
resemble animals not only internally but in their outer ap¬
pearance or indeed may differ from normal human beings
because of a peculiar arrangement of the various parts of
the body.
The conviction that distant lands were inhabited by be¬
ings who did not look quite human was shared by the
authors of a number of geographical works in ancient
China. But the introduction of Buddhism changed the
idea which the Chinese had of the rest of the world. In the
minds of Buddha's disciples, the idea of Chinese racial
supremacy was toned down in favour of the idea of a
common religion. Since the religious capital of Buddhism
was very far from the frontiers of China, the scale of
values applied to evaluation of the overall picture of the
inhabited world was, as it were, revised.
The episode reported by the Chinese pilgrim Fa-xian in
his account of his travels in India in 412-425 is quite il¬
luminating. When asked where he came from, Fa-xian
replied that he came "from the land of the Han". This
In his City of God, Saint Augustine (354-430)
categorically rejects the theory that the monsters who
were believed to inhabit the limits of the earth were
descended from Noah's sons: "Either the stories about
these monsters are pure invention or, if they do exist,
they are not men. If they are really men, then they are
descended from Adam". With Saint Augustine the idea
of the unity of the human race is based upon acceptance
of biblical teaching concerning the creation of man.
As a matter of fact, medieval European writers admit¬
ted only one fundamental difference between men-
there were the Christians and, confronting them, the
pagans. It should not, however, be thought that the reign
of religious ideology necessarily meant that the peoples
of Christendom considered themselves to be fully equal
amongst each other.
It is rightly said of the Renaissance that it was the
period when man discovered Humanity. Interest in the
Greco-Roman scientific heritage led to the spread of
many of the ideas expressed by ancient writers. The
ethnic horizon of Europeans was also considerably en¬
larged by the great geographical discoveries. It became

turies involved, according to some
experts, the export of not less than

slave trade may be it can give only

statement astonished the Buddhist monks who exclaim¬
ed: "How have people from such a distant land been able
to come as far as here?" Thus the Middle Empire was
situated on the outskirts of the Buddhist world. And it
was not by chance that Fa-xien did not use this term to
designate China. For him, the Middle Empire was India.
One of the factors which most influenced the ethnic
awareness of the European peoples in the Early Middle
Ages was the spread of Christianity. The position of or¬
thodox Christian doctrine regarding differentiation bet¬
ween races and cultures is based on two postulates the
fact that the human race is descended from Adam, and
the idea that degeneration was a result of original sin.
The banishment of Adam and Eve from the Garden of
Eden and Abel's murder were followed by the wander¬
ings of Cain, who left his parents in order to found a fami¬
ly of his own. But Adam's younger son continued his
father's line. One of the representatives of this line was
Noah. He fathered three sons who, after the Flood,
founded three separate branches of the human race.
From Ham were descended the peoples of Egypt,
Ethiopia and Canaan; from Japheth: the Cimmerians, the
peoples of Magog, the lonians and others; from Shem the
Elamites, Assyrians, Lydians, Hebrews and others. The
peoples who participated in the building of the Tower of
Babel were already so different from each other that they
were unable to understand each other. At this point in the
history of the human race, changes also appeared in the
physical types which became less and less like the ¡deal
type, who was Adam.
8
evident that the differences between human groups
were infinitely greater than was hitherto supposed.
The origin of the American Indians, of which not the
slightest mention could be found in Holy Scripture, prov¬
ed to be a particularly difficult question. The desire to
reconcile Old Testament teaching and new ethnographic
information led to the elaboration of a large number of
theories according to which the American Indians were
a branch of one or other of the European peoples Greek,
Roman, Carthaginian or even Welsh. This solution to the
problem was officially sanctioned by Pope Julius II, who
proclaimed in a Bull of 1512 that American Indians, like
the rest of mankind, were descended from Adam.
The opinion advanced by the French scholar Isaac de
la Peyrère (1594-1676) was radically different. In his
treatise, Praeadamitiae, which was published in 1655
and created quite a stir, he cast doubts on the explana¬
tion of the origin of all the peoples of the world derived
from the Old Testament version of man's origin. He did
not question the accuracy of the biblical story, but main¬
tained that it reflected events which related only to a
limited area. If this point of view were accepted, Adam
could be regarded as the ancestor of the Jews, but the
American Indians, for example, must have had their own
Adam. Thus, the creation of man was not a single,
isolated act. Several different places existed on the earth
where man appeared. This idea finally gave rise to anti-
scientific theories of all kinds which transformed racial
differentiation into an absolute.

ETHNOCIDE
For the past few years, increasing concern has been ex¬
pressed at various international forums over the problem of
the loss of cultural identity. This complex process, which
has historical, social, political and economic roots, has been
termed "ethnocide".
Ethnocide means that an ethnic group is denied the right
to enjoy, develop and transmit its own culture and its own
language, whether collectively or individually. This involves
an extreme form of massive violation of human rights and,
in particular, the right of ethnic groups to respect for their
cultural identity and the right of all individuals and peoples
to be different, to consider themselves as different and to be
regarded as such, a right recognized in the Declaration on
Race and Racial Prejudice adopted by the Unesco General
Conference in 1978.
We publish below the conclusions of a meeting of experts
on the study of ethno-development and ethnocide in Africa,
convened by Unesco and held in Ouagadougou, Upper
Volta, from 31 January to 4 February 1983.
AFRICA is becoming increasingly
aware of the danger of rapid
extinction facing cultures and
collective identity throughout the con¬
tinent, a danger that is particularly
acute in the case of certain peoples.
This danger, in the broadest sense,
consists in a general encroachment
upon the common African substratum.
In southern Africa, this onslaught is
of particularly menacing proportions as
a result of apartheid and the establish¬
ment of Bantustans; the concept of
ethnic groups is used to paralyse,
divide and destroy the personality and
basic structures of an entire people.
In addition, some peoples, most of
them nomadic herdsmen or hunters
and gatherers, are being subjected to
an insidious process that seeks to deny
their cultural identity and ultimately
their existence as peoples.
These various forms of aggression
should be analysed in terms of
ethnocide, and an in-depth study of
their causes and consequences is
needed.
Although most African societies
tolerated pluralism, certain outside in¬
fluences have contributed to the in¬
troduction of practices of economic
domination and cultural alienation
which continue to this day.
One of these influences was the
slave-trade, especially the trans¬
atlantic slave-trade, which resulted in
the decline of certain peoples or the
permanent vitiation of their structures.
Colonialism developed throughout
virtually the entire continent of Africa
an integral, generalized system of
ethnocide which struck at every
aspect of Africans' daily lives.
Political and legal structures, for ex¬
ample, were superimposed on the ex¬
isting structures, shattering Africans'
traditional organization in order to sub¬
ject them more completely to outside
interests.
Economic organization and the
social and human fabric of life, towns
and countryside alike, were thus
redirected in response to external
factors.
These various processes were ac¬
companied by far-reaching changes in
value systems, patterns of thought
and of transmission of knowledge
which give the full measure of colonial
ethnocide.
These phenomena subsist in various
political, legal, economic, social and
cultural forms.
The maintenance of certain political
and administrative structures, the per¬
sistence of mimesis, and the introduc¬
tion of institutions and ideologies that
are inappropriate to the African situa¬
tion have hampered the African
peoples in assuming control of their
lives in any meaningful sense.
Imported systems of law, displacing
customary law, have seriously disturb¬
ed human, economic and social
relationships.
Economic relations, for example,
both within communities and with the
outside world, have generally been
based exclusively on the profit motive,
and have thus been destructive of the
former social cohesiveness and
solidarity.
Education has borrowed extensively
from foreign models, thereby helping
to reproduce those models and spread
their effects around, in a way that is
totally at variance with traditional
education.
Modernization based exclusively on
Western science and technology has
eclipsed and discredited the African
scientific and technological heritage,
especially in the areas in which it is par¬
ticularly rich, such as art, agriculture,
housing, medicine and pharmacology.
The universalist pretensions of this
approach also rule out any utilization of
the extensive knowledge of the
peoples concerned about the en¬
vironments in which they live.
In an effort to resist this ongoing
ethnocide, the international communi¬
ty has adopted legal instruments and
structures which time has shown to be
inadequate to deal with the
seriousness of certain situations.

Similarly, within the various coun¬
tries, legislative measures have not
always yielded the hoped-for results.
It is thus essential to address the
issue of the protection of human rights
at both the international and national
levels with a view to checking the
violation of the rights and cultural iden¬
tities of peoples and securing more ef¬
fective protection for minorities.
In order for this effort to be fully
meaningful, it should be incorporated
into comprehensive political,
economic, social and cultural
strategies.
The restitution of certain powers to
communities at the grassroots level, in
order inter alia to enable them to
organize themselves and manage their
own environments, is the primary pre¬
condition.
In economic and social matters,
those communities should also be
allowed the possibility to develop their
own blueprints for society integrating,
among other things, production and
consumption processes while fitting
harmoniously into the national and
inter-African context.
In this connexion, mixed
technologies with inputs from African
creativity, both traditional and contem¬
porary, have an important role to play.
The use of African languages should
be encouraged, especially within the
framework of an appropriate educa¬
tional system to be designed in close
liaison with the productive sectors.
Similarly, renewed recognition of the
validity of traditional medicine and
pharmacology would not only improve
the general level of health but would
facilitate the reintegration of com¬
munities into their own cultures.
These efforts and these prospects
for organic development should enable
African communities and peoples,
while resisting ethnocidal processes,
to participate in and contribute to
human progress in general and also to
preserve their own values and
aspirations.
The African and international in¬
tellectual and scientific community is
invited to give priority to research and
studies that might contribute to those
aims for the future.
Political and administrative leaders,
international institutions, worldwide
and regional, and non-governmental
organizations are urged to facilitate, in
so far as possible, such strategies and
projects as might help to release the
creative genius of the African peoples.
For all practical social purposes "race" is not so much a biological
phenomenon as a social myth. The myth of ' 'race ' ' has created an enor¬
mous amount of human and social damage. In recent years it has taken
a heavy toll in human lives and caused untold suffering. It still prevents
the normal development of millions of human beings and deprives
civilization of the effective co-operation ofproductive minds.

O Racism today
(US' AND THEM'
by Albert Memmi
AFTER twenty years of observation, reflection, research and
studies "in the field", I am convinced that racism is a
rotten plank. I am not speaking only of its moral aspect,
but of its very logic. No aspect of racism stands up to examination.
The ideas are inconsistent, the arguments dishonest, and the con¬
clusions either doubtful or crazy.
If the enormous quantity of writings in support of racism were
to be summarized, they would be found to consist broadly of three
assertions firstly that there are pure races; secondly, that these
pure races are biologically superior and consequently
psychologically and culturally superior; and thirdly, that these
forms of superiority explain and justify their predominance and
their socio-historical privileges.
Now, even a cursory examination reveals how fragile each of
these propositions is. Man's present biological nature developed,
and is still developing, in the course of continuous cross-breeding
processes. In this context, therefore, the concept of purity is no
more than a metaphor, wishful thinking, fantasy. This is not to say
that men do not differ from each other. They do, both culturally
and even biologically. But, surprisingly, the most recent scientific
research reveals on the contrary that the differences are so
fragmented that it is impossible to make a given social group co¬
incide with any one biological profile. Nor is the concept of
superiority any more sustainable on a functional level. There is
nothing to prove that biological superiority, assuming that it exists,
leads to psychological or cultural superiority. Finally, it is difficult
to see why any form of natural superiority should involve economic
or social advantages. One may so decide, but that is what is called
a privilege. In short, contrary to a widely held opinion, there is no
scientific theory nor even a clear distinct concept of racism.
However, although it should have been disposed of long ago, the
issue continues to provide a subject for endless debate. Why?
It is precisely because racism, being a pseudo-theory and a
pseudo-concept, has nothing to do with reason but is a mythical,
rationalized projection of a lived, emotional, confused experience.
This happens whenever an individual or group comes into contact
with another individual or group that is different or unfamiliar;
there is a reaction of uneasiness or distrust, with an aggressive
gesture of rejection all of which, incidentally, does not exclude an
ambiguous feeling of hope that the encounter may bring some
reciprocal advantage.
This is not the place to engage in a detailed description of this
very ancient mode of behaviour, which is inscribed in the history
of man. Suffice it to say simply that it is based on a combination
of fear and competition for survival. In order to survive, man seeks
to defend his integrity and his possessions and, on occasions, to ap¬
propriate those of his neighbour, whether they be movable or im-
ALBERT MEMMI, whose works have been published in some 20
countries, has many qualifications to describe the different manifesta¬
tions of racism. Notable among his works published in English are The
Colonizer and the Colonized (Souvenir Press, London, 1974) with a
preface by Jean-Paul Sartre, and The Pillar of Salt ( 1 955) with a preface
by Albert Camus. His most recent book is Le Racisme (Gallimard
publishers, Paris, 1982).
movable property, food, raw materials, territory, women, real or
imaginary religious, cultural or symbolical assets. Man is both ag¬
gressor and the object of aggression, both terrifying and terrified.
However, this aggressive rejection of another is not yet exactly
racism. The racist way of thinking is based on this rejection, and
on pre-existing cultural and social facts. It is a pseudo-justification
for aggression and profit in the name of differences which are sup¬
posed to confer a superiority on the accuser and to render his victim
inferior. It is good and beautiful to be white and conversely, it is
bad and ugly to be black hence the rightful privileges.
It is evident that on the one hand racism or, in other words, alleg¬
ed racial superiority based on alleged biological purity, is no more
than an ideological apparatus, one amongst many alibis for
domination and expropriation, and that on the other hand it forms
part of a more general mechanism which embraces it as a special
case.
For this reason, I think it is necessary to point out both this
general character of a form of human behaviour which is unfor¬
tunately only too common, and the specific character of racism.
Otherwise the false problems associated with racism will continue
to obscure the permanent drama represented by the aggressive re¬
jection of others. To make the distinction more clear, I have pro¬
posed that this terrified, aggressive rejection be designated by a new
word, heterophobia, and that the term racism be henceforth reserv¬
ed for that variety of heterophobia which exploits the fear
engendered by biological and racial difference in order to justify ag¬
gression and privilege. Similarly any operational definition should
cover both this wider meaning and this strict meaning of the same
form of behaviour. I therefore suggested the following formula¬
tion, which has been adopted by the Encyclopedia Universalis and
which Unesco has done me the honour of using as a basis for its
own definition: Racism is the generalized, permanent exploitation
of real or imaginary biological differences, to the advantage of the
accuser and to the detriment ofhis victim, for the purpose ofjusti¬
fying aggression.
As will be seen, it is sufficient to delete the term "biological" in
order to get a definition of heterophobia. Racist attitudes and
behaviour are like "swing-wing", or variable geometry aircraft:
any kind of difference can be exploited provided it appears to
justify the rejection of others and to legitimize any form of
advantage.
At the same time, we can perceive what could constitute a single
criterion for replying to those closely related questions which em¬
barrass contemporary consciences what connexion is there bet¬
ween anti-semitism and the slave trade? Can one speak of prejudice
against women or young people as forms of racism? Is there also
a form of racism affecting the poor and oppressed? etc. To
establish the connexion between these forms of behaviour, one has
only to ask oneself what advantage a particular aggressor could
derive from them at the expense of a particular victim.
Incidentally each of these forms of behaviour could be
designated by a term which would indicate its specificity within the
general scheme of heterophobia. Thus, negrophobia would mean
racism with specific reference to black people, judaeophobia the

Available scientific knowledge provides no basis for believing that the groups
of mankind differ in their innate capacity for intellectual and emotional
development.
Some biological differences between human beings within a single race may be
as great as, or greater than, the same biological differences between races.
Vast social changes have occurred that have not been connected in any way with
changes in racial type. Historical and sociological studies thus support the view
that genetic differences are of little significance in determining the social anc
cultural differences between different groups of men.
Statement on the Nature of Race and Race Differences,
Unesco, Paris, June 1951
aggressive rejection of Jews (anti-semitism, which is an excessively
broad term, would have to be dropped), arabophobia the rejection
of Arabs (today resurgent and based, paradoxically, both on the
wretched condition of immigrant workers and on fears aroused by
the oil crisis).
The lessons of history provide us with the best confirmation. The
main characteristics of the victims of present-day racism are suffi¬
ciently well dated and sociologically legible. It is clear that racism
as a doctrine is of recent origin and that it still has practical applica¬
tions. In the sixteenth century the Spaniards contrasted Spain's
"civilizing mission" in America to the "natural inferiority" and
even "perversity" of the Indians, hence the legitimacy of the Euro¬
pean conquest and settlement. Thus, the systematic attempt to
justify aggression against, and domination of, one group, describ¬
ed as biologically (and psychologically) inferior, by another group,
held to be superior, is contemporaneous with the beginnings of
colonization.
There is an obvious correlation between the black slave trade,
which reached its climax in the seventeenth century, and the first
arguments used in support of biological racism. True, the first ele¬
ment of such a demonstration can be found in certain ancient
writers. Aristotle favoured a social order based upon slavery, which
The ancient myth of the "noble savage"
popularized in the 18th century by Jean-Jacques
Rousseau presents a Utopian image of the
Amerindian as "primitive man" living in a state of
nature. Such a conception has clearly inspired
this 16th-century depiction of a South American
Indian chief who is shown half naked yet with the
undeniable air of a "gentleman".
he attempted to justify by reason of the natural inferiority of the
Barbarians, who were to act as slaves to the Greeks. But these are
isolated cases, and where it was present at all, biological stigmatiza-
tion played only a very secondary rôle. This latter system of argu¬
ment, which obviously had mercantile advantages, came into its
own with the growth of the slave trade.
Anti-semitism is of course very ancient, but it was originally a
religious or national issue. It appeared as a racist doctrine only
much later, simultaneously with the relative social emancipation of
the Jews and their consequent emergence as economic competitors.
It is interesting to observe an additional confirmation here.
Whenever difficulties of a social nature emerge or become ag¬
gravated, there is a reawakening of anti-semitism, as though the
anxieties of the peoples among whom they live were crystallized in
the Jews. The fact is that they are particularly convenient victims.
As negative stereotypes who are already widely scattered and
familiar, they can easily be used as scapegoats.
In short, then, it is only relatively recently that attempts have
been made to provide a systematic explanation of racism based on
an alleged science. Joseph-Arthur Gobineau, who was one of the
initiators of racism, already based himself on a comparative
analysis of the brain in order to assert that that of the Huron could
not contain, even in embryonic form, a mind similar to that of a
European. Even scientists of excellent reputation were not far from
sharing these opinions. Linnaeus and Georges-Louis Buffon were
not free from prejudices which paved the way for a self-styled scien¬
tific racism. The authority of Darwin was also invoked, and at the
end of the nineteenth century educated Europe was convinced that
the human species was divided into superior and inferior races (see
Ernest Renan and the anthropologist Paul Broca).
The soil thus prepared was destined to produce some extraor¬
dinary harvests. Gobineau was to produce violently anti-Jewish
successors in France, but it was in Germany above all that his ideas,
combined with a tradition of anti-semitism, led to concentrations,
deportations and genocidal extermination of entité populations. In
Italy, Fascism sought to justify Italian hegemony over other
peoples judged inferior (the Ethiopian campaign). In the Slav coun¬
tries, pan-slavist movements sought in literature, customs and
language alleged proofs of a superiority which led them to approve
or even promote bloody actions. The Anglo-Saxon countries did
not escape the contagion. As a result of research conducted by the
Englishman Francis Galton, experts seriously considered ways to
combat the proliferation of other races. In the United States, some
people tried to promote a veritable "ethnological crusade", and
South Africa based its institutions on Apartheid. (A manner of ex¬
pressing their "difference" adopted recently, for example, by cer¬
tain regionalists and certain young nations is not at times without
undertones of intolerance and sectarianism).
A comparison of these various doctrines social and cultural as
well as biological clearly reveals a constant factor, irrespective of
their specific characteristics or local circumstances: in the name of
a biological or other form of superiority, one human group believes
itself entitled to assert itself over another and to have recourse for
that purpose even to violence and murder.
Thus we find at the same time the answer to the most recent ques¬
tions with which people are concerned. Racism was a convenient
ideology for rising colonialism, for the black slave trade and for
anti-semitism. It can still be useful on a wide scale. The Algerian
war, followed by the presence of millions of immigrant workers in
France and throughout Europe provided and still provides.

favourable ground for arabophobia, renewed negrophobia and,
more generally, the aggressive rejection of.immigrants, which I also
suggest be included in the general concept of heterophobiathe
complex of fear of others and aggressiveness towards them.
Is there such a thing as "racism" against women? Strictly speak¬
ing, obviously no, since women do not constitute either a race or
people or even a definite socio-economic group. But heterophobia
towards women does exist, and it is more widespread than one
might think fears and aggressive impulses and justification of
these forms of behaviour by means of disparaging ideologies which
possess the twofold advantage of exorcizing these fears and confir¬
ming men in their alleged superiority and their real advantages. Can
we also apply the term "racism" to the ostracism of which young
people are often victims? It is easy to follow the same line of reason¬
ing and to include this phenomenon under the heading of
heterophobia. Young people, especially young men, are probably
felt as an obscurely dangerous force capable of destabilizing socie¬
ty. It is amusing to observe that here as in the case of women, the
biological dimension is not entirely absent. A young man or an
adolescent can inspire physical apprehension. To a questionnaire
sent to me by specialist educators, I felt obliged to reply that per¬
sons with motor or mental handicaps could inspire such apprehen¬
sions and provide pretexts both for rejections and "assertions" by
healthy people. Finally, yes, racism or heterophobia can and does
exist amongst deprived persons and former victims, in all groups,
including all social classes.
I do not propose to conclude by broaching the subject of possible
practical applications. Nevertheless, it is well realized that, unless
account is taken of the tenacity and complexity of heterophobia,
the fight against racism will, I fear, remain in the realm of pious
wishes and good conscience cheaply purchased.

Action against prejudice, intolerance and
racism in the field of education
As part of its Major Programme XII, Unesco aims to:
make individuals, communities and nations aware of
the manifestations of intolerance and racism and to
rally them against such things;
help change the attitudes and behaviour of in¬
dividuals, groups and nations towards one another by
providing them with the means of understanding
other cultures better.
Action in the field of education will be carried out on three
levels:
1. education policies, planning and structures, in order
to prevent discriminatory treatment and the
transmission ofprejudices, intolerance and spirit of
discrimination (racial or ethnic);
2. the training of teachers, in order to make them both
more aware of the importance of their role and more
alert to prejudice, intolerance and racism. Exchanges
of teachers to familiarize them with different cultural
backgrounds might, for example, be organized;
3. textbooks and teaching materials, which sometimes
glorify heroes and events in racist terms or, converse¬
ly, do not give sufficient prominence to historical
figures who have worked in the cause of tolerance
and respect for all cultures. Within this context, ex¬
changes of textbooks and teaching material will be
encouraged in order to facilitate the revision of their
contents and sharpen the criticalfaculties of teachers
and of students.
In this way Unesco is emphasizing the need to inculcate
new mental attitudes and thus to counter the evils of racism,
since many negative attitudes and prejudices are formed in
the early years of childhood and are reinforced during the
educational process.

ACCUSED
TREASON TRIAL
DECEMBER
Throughout 1955 and 1956, the South African police conducted a series of raids on the offices and private homes of hundreds
of opponents of apartheid. Documents, letters, pamphlets, even pieces of clothing were seized in preparation for a show trial.
Then, early on the morning of 5 December 1 956, police descended on the homes of leaders of the Congress Alliance and arrested
them. One hundred and fifty-six people 104 Africans, 23 Whites, 21 Indians and 8 Coloureds were charged with high treason,
a capital offence in South Africa. Although the majority of the accused were soon released, almost every day for the next four
and a half years, thirty of them had to sit in court and listen to an endless recital of long documents, garbled versions of meetings
of the African National Congress and the fabrications of paid informers. The Treason Trial finally ended with the acquittal and
discharge of all the accused, a rare event in South Africa where such trials usually result in the imposition of the death penalty,
life sentences, or long periods of imprisonment. Above, a group photograph of all the accused. Nelson Mandela, the African Na¬

© Apartheid:
the doctrine of
a racist State
THE
SHAMEFUL
RECORD
by Basil Davidson
THE history of apartheid is the record of a racism con¬
ceived and used by small white minorities in South
Africa in order to dominate a large black majority,
deprive this majority of its land, and maximize the exploita¬
tion of its labour for the benefit of the whites and their
foreign partners. As such, it is a record which begins very
soon after the arrival of the earliest Dutch settlers at the
Cape of Good Hope in 1652: almost from the first, these
settlers and all other settlers who followed them from
Holland, Britain, France or elsewhere, considered that they
had the right to dispossess the African inhabitants in any
way and to any degree that could be profitable and
convenient.
In no essentials, since those early years, has anything
changed in the relationship between "whites" and
"blacks" (the latter being taken to include Asians and Col¬
oured of a mixed origin) except the "language of legality"
and a vast increase of actual dispossession. Crude forms of
outright enslavement have developed, step by step, into the
sophisticated laws and regulations of a racism whose in¬
strumental force, for those who apply it and those who have
to suffer it, is in everyday reality no different from a legalized
servitude.
The squalid politics of an "inter-white" rivalry for the
fruits of this instrumental racism may often fill our
newspapers, as the Afrikaans-speaking minority plays out a
charade of parliamentary conflict with the English-speaking
minority; they remain, as in the past, only a mask for the
solid unity of interest and intention, between these two
white minorities, that joins them in exploitation of the black
majority.
There are other masks to be thrust aside. Apartheid is
sometimes portrayed, up and down the world, as an inven¬
tion of the Afrikaans-speaking minority or by its first
elected parliamentary majority of 1948 as a means of
realizing its own peculiar doctrine of Calvinist belief. But
that is to misrepresent the meaning of the system, or,
rather, to "theorize" that meaning in terms of a subjectivity
BASIL DAVIDSON, British writer and historian, is an authority on
African history and current affairs and is at present preparing a series
of eight one-hour programmes on African history for British and other
national television networks. His many books on Africa include Libera¬
tion of Guiñé (1969), with a preface by Amilcar Cabrai, and In the Eye
of the Storm: Angola's People (1972).
which certainly exists, but which covers an objective mean¬
ing of infinitely greater force. This objective meaning differs,
in truth, only in degree from any other form of colonial
racism, always the instrument of a mise en valeur, of "get¬
ting out the profits", whether in the British, French or any
other colonial system. Apartheid is colonial racism carried to
an extreme.
These may sound harsh conclusions, but they are what
the history of South Africa has to teach us.
Up to 1 899 the white politics of all the lands south of the
Limpopo river the lands that form modern South Africa-
were largely those of military power used to defeat black
resistance. Broadly, those politics were contained within
two areas of competition. As soon as the British were
established securely at the Cape of Good Hope, following
victory over the French fleet at Trafalgar in 1 805, they em¬
barked on a long series of what were euphemistically called
"frontier wars". Against continuous black resistance, not
always defeated, British forces pushed east and north¬
eastward from their little colony at the Cape, invading and
dispossessing one African community after another until
their final conquest of the Zulu kingdom in 1879.
The descendants of the Dutch settlers (enlarged by im¬
migration from Holland but still more by unadmitted unions
with black women) had meanwhile gone some way towards
forming themselves into a distinctive nation, the Afrikaner
volk, and by this time spoke a variant of Dutch which was
already beginning to be a distinctive language, Afrikaans.
They were far too weak in numbers and technology to tackle
strong African communities such as the Xhosa and the Zulu,
whose destruction as independent entities was left to the
British, but were strong enough to dispossess a wide range
of small African communities. These lived to the west of the
areas of British conquest, and were duly enclosed in the
Afrikaner (or Boer, a term simply meaning "farmer")
republics of the Orange Free State and the Transvaal.
By the 1 880s, accordingly, there were four white political
units: the two British colonies of the Cape and of Natal, and
the two Afrikaner republics in the north and west. All were
farming communities, each of them practically without the
beginnings of any industrial production, living in a typical
colonial fashion by exporting wool and other products of the
land in exchange for such manufactured imports as they
could afford. Diamonds had been discovered in quantity at^

Kimberley as early as 1 867, and in 1871 the British duly an¬
nexed these diamond fields which became, a little later, the
scene of a veritable "diamond rush", with a railway com¬
pleted from the Cape to Kimberley in 1885. But even this
new source of wealth could change little in the general pic¬
ture. What changed, everything, and soon with violent
drama, was the proving in 1 884-6 of the great goldfields of
the Witwatersrand in the Transvaal Republic.
These goldfields promised the wealth of Croesus to those
who could exploit them, but, being deep seams with a
relatively low gold content per ton of ore, they demanded an
intensive capitalization. For reasons imperialist and narrow¬
ly economic, major British interests now saw that they must
secure political control of a Transvaal governed by farmers
who had little or no interest in large-scale capitalist develop¬
ment. After many skirmishes there followed the Anglo-
Afrikaner war of 1899, provoked by the British and won by
the British, though at a sorry cost in lives, two years later.
This victory marked the beginning of modern South Africa.
Having won the war, the British .were quick to reassure
their Afrikaner opponents that systematic discrimination
against the black majority would be written into the founda¬
tion of the Union of South Africa (that is, the union of Cape
Colony, Natal, Transvaal, and the Orange Free State) which
followed in 1910. For thirty-eight years after that, the
English-speaking minority generally dominated the all-white
parliament of a now-independent Union, but invariably on
apartheid lines.
This new parliament lost no time in guaranteeing a
systematic racism. In 1 91 1 , a Native Labour Regulation Act
provided for the legalization much elaborated and tighten¬
ed up in later years of an all-embracing discrimination
against black wage-earners. In 1913 the parliament went
much further. It passed a Land Act which reserved some
ninety per cent of the total land surface of the Union for
white ownership, and reduced the area available for black
ownership to the remaining ten per cent (less at the beginn¬
ing, today about thirteen per cent). These small areas where
Africans could own land were named Native Reserves, and
rapidly became what they were intended to be: destitute
reservoirs of black labour for the "white areas". Within the
latter, some ninety per cent of the land surface, new laws
restricted black rights of residence, movement, employ¬
ment, and even leisure.
In 1923 came the Natives (Urban Areas) Act which was
to remain, with the Land Act of 1913, the foundation of all
white policy towards blacks, and so remains to this day.
Essentially, it was a weapon of physical segregation within
the "white areas"; and the policy which was held to justify
it was called "separate development". The effective mean¬
ing of this policy was defined by the African scholar Z.K.
Matthews in 1 944, when he described this Act of 1 923 as
providing for "the separation of black and white, not with
the idea of protecting each group in regard to its basic in¬
terests, but the separation of the groups in order to facilitate
the subordination of one group to the other the exploita¬
tion of one group by the other".
But an official and of course all-white government com¬
mission of 1 921 , two years before the Act became law, had
already put the matter more clearly. It laid down the basic
principle of white supremacy. This was that "the native [a
term invariably meaning the black or non-white inhabitant]
should only be allowed to enter urban areas, which are
essentially the white'man's creation, when he is willing to
enter and to minister to the needs of the white man, and he
should depart therefrom when he ceases so to minister".
What "minister" meant, very precisely, was that the black
man should work for the white man at whatever level of
wages, and under whatever conditions of work, that the
white man might concede. George Bernard Shaw, visiting
South Africa soon after, called that country a slave State;
and it is really quite hard to think that he was wrong.
This dispensation, ensuring cheap and captive black
labour in ninety per cent of the land surface, was further pro¬
tected by "pass laws" which required and require
today detailed police supervision of any black employment
or shift of residence, and much else besides, and, beyond
these "pass laws", by customs and regulations designed to
16
prevent or punish any black-white "commingling"
except, naturally, whenever convenient to whites, as in the
case of black nannies for white children, or black cooks for
white ladies.
Such was the system by which the parliament of South
Africa ruled the country so long as the English-speaking
minority retained control of the laws. In erecting it the
British had fully realized their aims in conquering the
Afrikaner republics: they had provided an "¡deal structure"
for the development of a specific capitalism fuelled by
British capital, which entered the country increasingly after
1920, and which ensured the English-speaking majority of
a uniquely high standard of living while, at the same time,
providing a uniquely high rate of profit for investors in
Britain.

UNESCO,
THE UNITED NATIONS
AND SOUTH AFRICA
THE racial policies of the Government of South Africa
have been before the United Nations since the first
session of the General Assembly in 1946. India, in
that year, brought before the Assembly a complaint that the
Government of what was then the Union of South Africa
had enacted legislation which discriminated against South
Africans of Indian origin. The two Acts specifically aimed at
Indians were the so-called Pegging Act which froze Indian
land transactions in parts of Natal and the Transvaal and the
Asiatic Land Tenure and Indian Representation Act (1946)
which extended the provisions of the Pegging Act to the
whole of Natal and the Transvaal and which introduced
communal and separate political rights.
UN protests were ignored by the South African Govern¬
ment. Not only was the Asian Land Tenure Act enforced, in
1 948 the National Party came to power with a political plat¬
form based on "apartheid" or the separation of races. The
Group Areas Act No. 41 of 1950 was designed to enforce
this separation in urban areas.
In conformity with its terms, Africans were concentrated
in townships at the edge of "white" cities, while Indians
were further restricted to specific urban areas. Separation
was accompanied by a major campaign of racial classifica¬
tion. The Population Registration Act of 1 950, with its later
amendments, provided for the classification of the South
African population into three main groups: whites, coloured
and Africans with the Asians constituting a sub-group in the
coloured group.
In the same year two other acts were enacted which were
basic to South Africa's apartheid policy: the abolition of the
Native Representative Council (created in 1936 by the
South African Government and composed of whites and
Africans), the Suppression of Communism Act with its far-
reaching powers to restrict individuals and organizations
and the first stages of a statute designed to deprive the col¬
oured people of the Cape of the common roll franchise they
had enjoyed for nearly a century.
The General Assembly of the United Nations replied with
Resolution 395 (V) of 2 December 1 950. This stated that "a
policy of racial segregation (apartheid) is necessarily based
on doctrines of racial discrimination". Resolution 395 (V)
was followed by Resolution 551 (VI) of 12 January 1952,
615 (VII) of 5 December 1952, and 719 (VIII) of 11
November 1 953. These resolutions were principally design¬
ed to obtain from the South African Government a reversal
of its Urban Areas Acts as well as an extension of its fran¬
chise beyond the white population.
In 1953 the National Party again won the election con¬
siderably increasing its majority. The extent of this victory
practically destroyed the traditional white opposition parties
and groups. The election results also proved that the policy
of apartheid had wide support among the white population
going beyond the confines of the Afrikaner population.
In 1953 the Bantu Education Act of 1953 was passed.
This empowered the Minister to prescribe the medium of in¬
struction in government Bantu schools. This Act marked the
collapse of English as the principal medium in some African
schools and the introduction of Bantu education as part of
the Government's enforced tribalism.
In 1954, the General Assembly "invited" the Govern¬
ment of South Africa to reconsider its position in the light of
the principles of the Charter. In 1955, the Assembly "ex¬
pressed its concern" about the policies of the South African
Government. In 1 957, the General Assembly "appealed" to
the Government to revise its policy.
After the introduction of the Bantu Education Act of
1953, the Government introduced a ceiling on its financial
contributions from the general revenues. In 1955/56 this
was fixed at an annual amount which was insufficient and
substantially undermined the financial basis for the expan¬
sion of African education. Taxation was increased for
Africans worsening an already unjust tax system. The
Native (Urban Areas) Consolidation Act was further amend¬
ed in 1956 and 1957, the Native Administration Act of
1 927 was further amended in 1 956. This gave wide powers
to the State President with regard to the removal of Africans
or their banishment to specific parts of the territory. The In¬
dustrial Conciliation Act, 1956, permitted the government
to prohibit the replacement of employees of one race by
those of another race, to reserve certain types of jobs to per¬
sons of a specified race and to fix the number or percentage
of persons of a particular race to be employed in particular
industries.

The reaction to General Assembly resolutions was a
denial of the right in terms" of Article 2 (7) of the General
Assembly to discuss the issue. This position of South Africa
was coupled with certain proposals as South Africa faced
the beginning of the modern period of the anti-colonial
revolution in Africa. In 1953, Dr. Malan argued that the
removal of Western control would open the way for Com¬
munist influence in Africa and objected to any idea of admit¬
ting black African States to the British Commonwealth.
Instead, he proposed an "African Charter" which would
elaborate a common policy between the Western colonial
powers and South Africa with regard to the whole of Africa.
Meanwhile in 1950 Unesco had launched its race pro¬
gramme and begun to publish and disseminate Statements
on Race which struck at the heart of South Africa's ideology
of apartheid. The Statements, signed by leading scientists,
affirmed the equality of races and in particular that inter¬
marriage had no negative results. In South Africa inter¬
marriage was specifically prohibited by the Prevention of
Immorality Act which was an extension of the Prohibition of
Mixed Marriages Act of 1949.
Unesco also published a number of scientific studies on
racism. These were widely circulated in a number of coun¬
tries. Within South Africa, the Institute of Race Relations
was reorganized and expanded in 1 955-1 956. The Institute
gave publicity to and circulated Unesco's statements and
booklets. This was in a situation where, as we have seen
before, the white opposition had practically collapsed after
the 1953 elections. On 5 April 1955 South Africa gave
notice of its withdrawal from the Organization giving as its
reason "the interference in South African racial problems by
means of Unesco publications which are being advertised
and distributed in the Union by the South African Institute
of Race Relations".
In 1960, a non-violent protest against, in particular, the
introduction of compulsory pass laws for women resulted in
the massacre at Sharpeville of Africans by the South African
police. This action, which shocked the world, occurred in
the same year that sixteen newly independent African
States were admitted to the United Nations. The UN Securi¬
ty Council, for the first time, considered the apartheid ques¬
tion as a threat to world peace. "Threat to world peace",
which implied actions under the Charter, was not passed by
the Security Council. However, the Council's resolution of
1 April 1 960 deplored the Government's policies and called
on it to take steps to bring about racial harmony based on
equality.
The UN General Assembly, meeting at the end of 1960,
considered a draft resolution which would have introduced
sanctions against South Africa. This received a majority of
votes but not the two-thirds required for important
questions.
There was, however, a change in the attitudes of
"Western" countries. These had so far supported the South
African arguments of non-interference supposedly based on
Article 2 (7) and which had refused the General Assembly's
right to discuss the South African question.
White South Africans voted to become a Republic on 31
May 1961. Until then the Queen of the United Kingdom of
Great Britain and Northern Ireland was also the Queen of the
then Union of South Africa. Sharpeville had, however,
sharpened the opposition of African members of the Com¬
monwealth to the maintenance of South Africa within the
Commonwealth. The crisis threatened the continuing ex¬
istence of the Commonwealth itself. In early 1961, at a
crucial meeting in London, South Africa was faced with
either expulsion or withdrawal. Dr. Verwoerd, then Prime
Minister, decided on withdrawal charging Commonwealth
interference in South Africa's domestic affairs.
Sharpeville was followed by a veritable reign of terror
within South Africa. In reply to a day of mourning called by
the African National Congress, the Government arrested
some 1 ,900 of all races and from the African National Con¬
gress, the Pan African Congress, the Liberal Party and the
Congress Alliance. An additional 20,000 Africans were de¬
tained on charges of vagrancy. Chief Luthuli of the African
The anti-apartheid posters above, by the French ar¬
tists Paul Rebeyrolle (left) and Ernest Pignon-Ernest
(right), formed part of the exhibition Artists Against
Apartheid, held at the Galerie Maeght, Paris, in March
1983 and organized by the UN and the Committee of
Artists of the World Against Apartheid. Founded in
November 1981, the Committee consists of artists
from all over the world who support the efforts of the
international community to eliminate apartheid. The
National Congress was jailed and then placed under a bann¬
ing order under the suppression of Communism Act. Both
the ANC and the PAC were banned within the country and
their principal leaders sent to prison.
After 1960, therefore, on the one hand the international
community had increased its condemnation of apartheid
and its pressure for change, on the other hand South Africa
had embarked on a series of "treason trials" massive ar¬
rests, particularly of Africans, and the interdiction of the
two major African political parties with the banning and ar¬
rest of their principal leaders. 1 960 also marked a trek out
of South Africa by refugees in order to escape arrest. These
refugees, as well as the ANC and PAC, in line with their then
position of non-violent protest modelled after Mahatma
Gandhi reiterated the call for an external boycott of South
Africa as a support to internal non-violent action.
At the end of 1962, the UN General Assembly passed a
resolution (Resolution 1761 XVII) which received the re¬
quired two-thirds majority. This resolution contained a list of
actions which Member States should take against South
Africa and was designed to bring about peaceful change
within that country. The list of actions included the breaking
off of diplomatic relations, the closing of ports to South
African vessels, the boycotting of all South African goods
and an embargo on exports to South Africa including all

Committee is organizing another anti-apartheid ex¬
hibition to be held in Paris at the Fondation Nationale
des Arts Plastiques, from 22 November to 31
December 1983, with the participation of 85 world-
renowned painters and sculptors. The exhibition will
travel the world and will ultimately form the basis of
the Museum of the Artists of the World Against Apar¬
theid which will be presented to the first democratic
government to be established in South Africa.
arms and ammunition. In addition, the Security Council was
requested to take all appropriate measures, including sanc¬
tions, to secure South Africa's compliance with United Na¬
tions resolutions. At the same time, a special UN Committee
on the Policies of Apartheid was established to review and
report on South African developments between General
Assembly sessions.
The General Assembly resolution did not however receive
the support of South Africa's major trading partners. The
question was referred to the Security Council who could
alone order mandatory sanctions in terms of Chapter VII of
the Charter.
In August 1 963, the Security Council met to consider the
proposal for sanctions against South Africa. The proposal
was not adopted principally because of the position of
South Africa's major trading partners when these were
members of the Security Council. However, the Security
Council called upon Member States to cease the sale of
arms and military equipment to South Africa. Since two
Western countries abstained, even this selective boycott
could not be adopted under Chapter VII of the Charter. It re¬
mained a recommendation. While, however, some coun¬
tries ceased arms sales to South Africa, and others, those
which in their opinion "could be used for enforcing apart¬
heid legislation", the manufacture of arms within South
Africa increased, including in co-operation with public and
private firms and with the technical co-operation of some
countries. Indeed, by 1982, South Africa announced that it
would now become a major arms exporter, while in the
nuclear field strategic studies from a number of countries
suggest that South Africa may already be an atomic power
in spite of the Non-Proliferation Treaty which in any case
South Africa has never signed. UN action therefore has fail¬
ed with regard to the arming of the apartheid State.
From 1960 to 1966 attention also focused on Namibia.
On 7 May 1919, South Africa was designated the Man¬
datory Power in South West Africa following the revelation
after 1914 of certain atrocities linked with German col¬
onialism. With the elaboration of the apartheid system.
South Africa interpreted certain articles of the League Cove¬
nant which regulated the Mandate, as requiring apartheid. In
addition, when the Charter of the United Nations was being
drafted at the San Francisco Conference in 1945, South
Africa had already presented her case for the incorporation
of South West Africa with South Africa.
In 1946, the South African Government had requested
permission to incorporate Namibia into South Africa. This
was rejected by the UN General Assembly on 1 4 December
1 946 in resolution 65(1). South Africa, however, continued
policies of incorporation. In December 1 949, the United Na¬
tions General Assembly, through resolution 338 (IV) decid¬
ed to clarify the legal status of Namibia and sought an Ad¬
visory Opinion from the International Court of Justice at the
Hague. The Court's opinion, handed down on 1 1 July 1 950,
unanimously concluded that (a) the Territory was under in¬
ternational mandate and that (b) Chapter XII of the Charter
was applicable "in the sense that they provide a means by
which the Territory may be brought under the Trusteeship
system".
As a result of this the General Assembly reiterated its re¬
quest that Namibia then the Territory of South West
Africa be placed under the International Trusteeship
System. South Africa refused to comply. In 1 953, a perma¬
nent UN Committee on South West Africa was established
by General Assembly resolution 749 A (VIM).
In 1961 after years of calling upon South Africa, the
General Assembly decided "to call the attention of the
Security Council to the situation in respect of South West
Africa which, if allowed to continue, will in the General
Assembly's view endanger international peace and securi¬
ty". In addition resolution 1705 (XVI) established a special
training programme for indigenous inhabitants of South
West Africa.
In 1960, Ethiopia and Liberia instituted proceedings
against South Africa in the International Court of the Hague.
Both countries argued that South Africa was imposing apar¬
theid within Namibia contrary to responsibilities under the
Mandate. The legal arguments lasted from 1960 to 1966.
In a surprise decision in 1966 the International Court judged
that, while not pronouncing on the substance of the case,
Ethopia and Liberia had no legal right or interest in the ques¬
tion of South Africa's Mandate.
The Court's decision had three results. First it served to
boost South African morale. Second, and more important,
it confirmed the views of SWAPOthe African liberation
movement within Namibia that armed confrontation with
South Africa was now inescapable. Thirdly, it threw the
question back to the United Nations.
By 27 October 1 966, by 1 1 4 votes to 2 (Portugal, South
Africa) and with 3 abstentions (France, Malawi,' United
Kingdom), the General Assembly adopted resolution 2145
(XXI). This resolution declared that South Africa had failed
to fulfil its obligations in respect of the Mandated Territory.
The resolution decided "that the Mandate conferred upon
His Britannic Majesty to be exercised on his behalf by the
Government of the Union of South Africa is therefore ter¬
minated, that South Africa has no right to administer the
Territory, and that henceforth South West Africa comes
under the direct responsibility of the United Nations".
Security Council resolution 269 ( 1 969) by 1 3 votes to nil
and 2 abstentions (France and the United Kingdom), took
note and accepted the General Assembly resolution. It: J

"Called upon the Government of South Africa to withdraw

case before 4 October 1969;
Called upon all States to refrain from all dealings with the
Government of South Africa purporting to act on behalf of
the territory of Namibia;
Requested all States to increase their moral and material
assistance to the people of Namibia in their struggle against
foreign occupation."
South Africa refused the legitimacy of UN supervision.
Security Council resolutions increased. In the meantime
however the Namibian case was again taken to the Interna¬
tional Court. On 21 June 1971, the International Court
decided that the continued presence of South Africa in
Namibia being illegal, South Africa was under an obligation
to withdraw its administration from Namibia. While UN ac¬
tion was continuing the Specialized Agencies were not im¬
mune to the effects of the apartheid question. In some cases
conflict was the result of the very presence of South Africa
in these organizations: i.e. International Labour Organisa¬
tion (ILO), World Health Organization (WHO), Food and
Agriculture Organization (FAO). African regional co¬
operation, for example, could not be completely regional
where South Africa was in open confrontation with the free
countries of the continent and in an alliance with Portugal-
then engaged in a colonial war in Angola, Guinea-Bissau,
and Mozambique as well as with White-dominated then
Rhodesia.
NAMIBIA
The struggle of the Namibian people against the regime of
apartheid is a shining example to us all. That struggle is
mustering all its energy and is creating around it a great
movement of solidarity, in Africa and worldwide, which
broadly reflects its aspirations and is enlisting many dif¬
ferent forms of moral and material support.
It has culminated in the international consensus which is
now taking shape around the objective of Namibian self-
determination, and which has, in particular, found expres¬
sion in the resolutions of the General Assembly and of the
Security Council of the United Nations, concerning the right
to independence of the people of Namibia, the procedures
for its access to national sovereignty and the recognized in¬
ternational legitimacy of SWAPO [South West African
Peoples Organization] as the authentic representative of the
Namibian people.
Unesco wishes once again to pledge itsfull support for the
struggle of the Namibian people, led by SWAPO, until all its
fundamental objectives have been achieved.
Unesco has been one of the most active agencies of the
United Nations system in organizing campaigns against
racism and apartheid, and one of the very first to give prac¬
tical support to the liberation movements of southern
Africa. As such, it first of all admitted Namibia as an
Associate Member, and later, in 1978, as a full Member, en¬
joying the same rights as all the States that have already ac¬
quired their sovereignty. The Organization is at the same
time continuing to co-operate fruitfully with SWAPO, and
is implementing several programmes connected with educa¬
tion, communication and the promotion of human rights.
Amadou-Mahtar M'Bow
Director-General of Unesco
(Extract from address at the opening of the International Conference in
Solidarity with the Struggle of the People of Namibia, Paris, 1 1
September 1980)
This alliance was not simply a passive one. It included a
fair amount of at least logistic military support, as well as at¬
tempts to establish a White-ruled Southern African "Con¬
federation" and common market. Worse, apartheid directly
affected wide areas under the concern of the specialized
agencies: lack of bargaining powers for African trade unions
affected ILO as did job reservation policies; separate and
gravely unequal medical services and widespread African
nutritional diseases affected WHO; the deliberate sabotage
of African agriculture affected FAO.
As we have seen, South Africa left Unesco in 1955.
Unesco therefore escaped the conflict caused by the very
presence of South Africa. It did not however remain unaf¬
fected by apartheid policies.
In 1963, the General Assembly invited the Specialized
Agencies to assist the Special Committee set up to report on
apartheid, in the fulfilment of its mandate. In conformity
with this, the Secretary-General of the United Nations, on
20 April 1 965, requested Unesco "to prepare a study on the
effects of apartheid in the fields of education, science and
culture". This request was accepted by the Executive Board
of Unesco which further accepted that this study should be
extended to information.
The report, completed in 1 966 and revised in 1 970 (again
in the course of revision) showed that apartheid had far-
reaching efects in education, science, culture and informa¬
tion. Not only were the United Nations Charter, the Con¬
stitution of Unesco and the United Nations' Universal
Declaration of Human Rights violated, apartheid had grave
consequences that went beyond simple violation. "It is a
policy of deliberate inequality built into the educational
system, expressed in scientific and cultural activities, and
underlined in the regulations governing access to informa¬
tion". Apartheid was not only an inadmissible answer to
racial and group conflict but was itself the major source of
this conflict. "This is most serious in relationships between
whites and non-whites, but the very heightening of group
awareness, which is part of the aims of the apartheid
system, should per se intensify hostilities between
Afrikaans and English-speaking South Africans, and, by the
separation of Africans into self-contained tribal units, create
a tribal nationalism leading to increased inter-tribal rivalry.
The Government of South Africa moved quickly. It
prepared a "reply" and after some legislative debate bann¬
ed the Unesco Report specifically.
Action has continued and indeed intensified. This is not
surprising. Apartheid struck at the roots of all that Unesco
stood for. Each study commissioned by Unesco illustrated
this. History had been deliberately falsified: this was the
conclusions of Cornevin's L'apartheid: pouvoir et falsifica¬
tion historique. Textbooks became the means whereby
racism was deliberately and often subtly «conveyed. This
was the conclusion of History in Black and White: an
analysis of South African textbooks. Social science
research was perverted, field notes confiscated, social
scientists banned. These were the conclusions of Apartheid
and Social Research. The mass media at home and abroad
was subverted. This was the conclusion of a look at news
agencies and South Africa. Academics were hunted outside
the borders of the Republic this was the conclusion of a
meeting at Maputo, Mozambique, three days after which
the distinguished social scientist Ruth First was
assassinated by a letter bomb.
There was no way Unesco could escape the struggle. In
speech after speech the Director-General has warned of the
enormity of a situation which is no longer simple racial
discrimination. It is a policy of deliberate oppression geared
to reinforcing white political domination, increasing white
profits by the use of cheap, mobile, directed African labour,
establishing an ideology in which racism is used to refuse
education, to deny Africans, Asians and coloureds access
to science and technology, an ideology which subverts,
constrains and fabricates so-called African cultures.
Unesco, with its mission of constructing peace in the
minds of men and constructing a world in which the co¬
operation of all peoples releases the best of man's spirit of
tolerance and of creation remains in direct opposition to
apartheid, and to its new name "separate development".

CONTINUED FROM PAGE 16
In 1948 the JEnglish-speaking minority lost control of
parliament, and were never to regain it. That control passed
to the Purified Afrikaner National Party then led by Dr. D.F.
Malan; and "separate development" was followed by apar¬
theid. The complexities behind this change were many, but
a few central points may be useful.
The Afrikaners had remained, substantially, a farming
community for whom the burgeoning towns had long
become an object both of hatred and of envy: of understan¬
dable hatred in that large numbers of "poor whites" from
the rural and largely Afrikaner areas were driven into the
towns by their poverty, and there subjected to low wages,
bad conditions of work, and English-speaking contempt;
and of equally understandable envy in that the towns were
the manifest and rapidly growing sources of white wealth,
command of which was in English-speaking hands.
Meanwhile the Second World War had done much to ex¬
acerbate English-Afrikaner hostility. Nearly all the leaders of
the Purified National Party had openly hoped and worked for
a Nazi victory; and some of them had been gaoled for pro-
Nazi sabotage. Their electoral triumph of 1948 was
therefore accompanied by a determination to succeed
where Hitler had failed: and put an end, once and for all, to
English-speaking supremacy.
Yet the Second World War had another effect. It unleash¬
ed new currents of black liberation: or, at least, of black
hopes that the anti-racist nature developed by the War
might be made to have its influence here as well. And at that
time, even if the tides of black nationalism elsewhere had
still to reveal their strength, such hopes could seem by no
means unrealistic. Apartheid was therefore introduced,
after 1 948, as a means of reinforcing the discrimination of
earlier years.
The blacks were to be kept as subservient labour while
the long boom of the white economy, begun in the 1930s,
vastly enlarged during the Second World War, and prolong¬
ed thereafter, was further strengthened by methods of
State-capitalism which, at the same time, gave Afrikaner
businessmen and politicians their entrée to economic power
and personal wealth. And this was when, during the 1 950s,
the old dominance of British investment gave way to much
greater new investment from the USA, the Federal Republic
of Germany, France, and later Japan, and when South
Africa, from being a merely British investors' fief, became a
"honey-pot" of international dimensions.
The system in substance in no way changed because
apartheid followed "separate development". Apart from
cosmetic improvements to the face that the régime tries to
show a critical world, it has become clearer than ever that
racist discrimination has in fact evolved into an inseparable
feature of this particular form of capitalism. Well-
intentioned persons may still wish to believe that apartheid
will gradually "eliminate itself" as the economy continues
to expand, and as the demand for skilled black labour comes
increasingly into conflict with the "colour bars" of
discrimination. The history of this State has proved the
contrary.
With every fresh expansion of the white economy since
the 1 930s, the screws of discrimination have been tighten¬
ed further. The wage-payment level of "colour bars" has
been raised: these "bars" still remain potently in force. And
this, again, is the lesson of everything that has happened
during the 1970s and early 1980s: all too tragically, the
system has shown that it contains within itself no essential
self-correcting mechanism. Without its racism, it cannot
function.
The non-white communities African, Asian, and Col¬
oured by origin or definition had long hoped and worked
for peaceful change, and were influenced in this by the Gan-
dhian Congress tradition as well as by a belief that the sheer
injustice of the system even, in some respects, the sheer
absurdity of the system must eventually bring it to an end.
This hope of change by passive resistance, as noted above,
flourished after the victory of 1 945 over Nazi-Fascism, tan¬
tamount as this was, or was thought to be, to a victory over
racism everywhere.
Even the advent to power of the Afrikaner "Nationalists"
(of the Purified National Party) in 1 948 failed to quench this
optimism. It culminated early in the 1950s with a coun¬
trywide campaign of passive resistance to the pass laws
undertaken by all the non-white communities, with the
African National Congress in the van. But then all hope of
peaceful change died, and died violently.
Laws were at once passed by the "Nationalist" govern¬
ment to punish any such passive resistance by lashing with
whips, imprisonment, or both. Laws were passed to identify
any black protest, however peaceful or otherwise legal in
nature, with a "Communism" which was equated,
however ludicrously, with some kind of foreign-promoted
attempt to overturn the State. Laws were passed to give the
police a free hand in arrest, detention without trial, and
behaviour towards all "suspected persons"; and death in
prison of such persons has become almost a common
feature of the system.
Laws were passed to enlarge the provisions of the 1923
Act on physical segregation into a veritable juggernaut of
persecution: by the early 1980s, more than three million
black persons men, women and children had been
uprooted from their homes often the homes of their
remote ancestors and "re-settled" in areas designated for
"black residence". By no means rarely, such areas were or
are empty bush devoid of the least urban facility or means
of employment. Laws were passed to "elevate" the old
Native Reserves overcrowded, overgrazed, mere rural
slums into "Bantu Homelands", and to label these as "in¬
dependent States": another mockery of words which,
however, failed to fool even those who applied them.
With all this, South Africa appeared to have reached the
ultimate possible extension of the laws of discrimination
which had brought the Union of South Africa to birth in
1910. In this Republic of South Africa, all "safety valves"
were now sealed off, so that explosion had become the only
possible alternative to continued submission. And in 1980,
through its action-wing, Umkonto wa Sizwe, the African
National Congress of South Africa duly embarked on the
beginnings of a war of resistance.
It had taken long to mature. Only at the outset of the
1960s, despairing of any good result from non-violent
resistance and with all passive resisters facing severe
penalties or even death, had black leaders such as Nelson
Mandela and a handful of white sympathizers turned to a
campaign of sabotage; but this failed through intimidation
and betrayal. Mandela and his companions were sent to
prison for life; others took refuge abroad.
But into the silence that followed, onwards from 1970,
there came new pressures for change: effective organiza¬
tion by black workers in the manufacturing industries; a
renewal of anti-aparthe/d agitation by black students
segregated within "tribal colleges" (for Zulu, Sotho, Xhosa,
and so on); the rise of a movement of self-encouragement
named Black Consciousness (whose best-known
spokesman, Steve Biko, rapidly met his death in a white
prison); and finally, taking fire from the victories of black
liberation in Mozambique and Angola, the massive and
heroic "school strikes" of 1976 in Soweto and other black
towns.
All these initiatives have been met by the same repression
as before (save that some small concessions have been
made to black trade unionism, in the hope that these may
weaken or confuse black political understanding and
organization). Reckless police shooting into unarmed
crowds is now a common practice; and the number of
school students shot dead by the police during 1976 was
certainly not less than three hundred, and possibly many
more. Polite words to the outside world are accompanied,
by the régime, with a militarization of the State and an ever
greater ruthlessness towards all persons, of whatever com¬
munity, who may threaten effective protest.
By 1981 the South African régime was virtually at war
with Angola and Mozambique as well as in its colony of
Namibia, and was threatening invasive action against the
newly-independent republic of Zimbabwe. But this régime
was also at war, in everything save the name of war and its
formal declaration, within its own frontiers.
Today, that war continues.

NATURE has created differences;
society has turned them into in¬
equalities. A comprehensive ap¬
paratus of justification has been fashion¬
ed in the course of time and brandished
like a shield against the truth of nature
and culture. Its constant feature has been
and still is the evaluation of other people
according to their skin; the conclusion is
drawn from the skin, which clothes and
covers the human being, not that there is
a diversity of values but that there is a
hierarchy in the quality of beings. In
other words, an attempt is made to reach
their innermost being and degrade it with
a look if not to reject them outright.
Slavery has often functioned on this
negation. But if this domination of man
by man has been abolished in law (and
some States did not abolish slavery until
the 1960s!), feeling contempt for others
on the grounds that they belong to a cer¬
tain group or religion, the subjective
basis and foundation of racism, is still
very much a part of the mental land¬
scape. Thanks to the economic crisis, it is
even making increasing headway. It con¬
tinues and diversifies its operations. Thus
colonial dispossession succeeded the
slave trade, and today, long after in¬
dependence, it still continues "at
home", as Sartre said. Migration was a
corollary of colonial occupation of which
it is now the sequel, if not its ambiguous
and less manifest form.
In addition to the political and
economic problems raised by immigra¬
tion in Europe, there is the less visible but
cardinal cultural problem. It arises both
in the host society, which avoids it, and in
the immigrant community which does

and journalist, has divided his time between

not know how to express, preserve, and
above all transmit its culture to its
children.
Everyday racism, which militates on
behalf of hatred with words and
sometimes with weapons, is characteriz¬
ed by an attitude of systematic rejection
rooted not so much in irrational impulse
as in a profound uneasiness caused by the
presence of another person who cannot
be reduced to the condition of a mute,
resigned and invisible unit of labour.
Ultimately, this vision is paradoxical: the
other person is not seen, there is no desire
to see him, still less to look at him; and
yet it is accepted that he is there a
nuisance who bears the responsibility for
everything that goes wrong. Absent or
present, he will be suspect.
When racism is not an ideology, as in
South Africa or Nazi Germany, it is a
habit, a kind of blind tradition which
ranges from Jew to Black, from Asian to
Arab. It is behaviour which may be en¬
capsulated in a paradox: it is profoundly
skin-deep. It is deeply rooted in mental
attitudes, yet superficial where attempts
to justify it are concerned. The racist in¬
dividual is conditioned; he reacts to the
very presence of the foreign body, which
is immediately noticed because it is dif¬
ferent. But behind this physical reaction
a mass of more or less confused ideas,
images and stereotypes lurks in the un¬
conscious of the racist, ready to pour out
in order to justify the act of rejection.
In April 1981, Unesco held a meeting
in Athens at which scientists from dif¬
ferent disciplines and countries came to
"scientifically ruin" racism. An "Ap¬
peal to the peoples of the world and to all
individuals everywhere" was issued by
the participants. The Appeal affirms that
"the difference between the genetic
structures of two individuals belonging
to the same race can be far greater than
the differences between the average
genetic structures of two population
groups. This finding makes it impossible

however, is the scale on which

too often leads to a hardening
of prejudice and to actual
discrimination.

definition of the different races... Those
engaged in scientific activity bear a major
responsibility for the social future of
their contemporaries. Where racism is
concerned, this responsibility involves
political and ethical choices."
Anti-racist vigilance should not
underestimate or ignore any sphere:
racism smoulders in the mind of the
aristocrat as well as in the habits of the
workman. Wherever it may be found, the
racism which feeds certain mentalities is,
fundamentally, a mirror that disturbs:
the Other person, the foreigner,
transmits back to the host society an im¬
age in which that society recognizes itself
but which it rejects because it is an image
which highlights its contradictions and
underscores its malaise and its
inadequacies.
Thus racism is primarily the expression
of one's own inadequacies which one
projects onto someone else who belongs
to a different category (class, race, na¬
tionality, age-group, social situation,
etc.). When fragments of images com¬
posed of the foreigner's everyday culture
(his language, his skin, his style of cook¬
ing, his music, and his religion) strike this
mirror, the person at the receiving end
feels dispossessed or at least threatened
as to his status and identity.
Hatred of others begins with self-
hatred. Racism, whether virulent or la¬
tent, is a procession of misfortune.
The second point concerns the com¬
munity which is the victim of exclusion.
There, the image of the self has been
devalued. It is ailing; it has been so far re¬
jected and dismantled that it is difficult
to live with, it is ill accepted.
A person who has been obliged to leave
his land and family in order to earn his
living and provide for the future of his
children is generally a fragile being. He
feels insecure, for he knows that he is not
fully accepted in terms of his own culture
and his own difference. The prevailing
hostility saps his confidence and leads
him to doubt the perception of his own
image. The working being is amputated
of his other, essential, cultural dimen¬
sion. For him exile is a form of mutila¬
tion, a violent experience which reduces
him to an economic mode of expression
and deprives him of the fundamental
values woven into his history and
civilization.
This disturbing experience causes the
immigrant to interiorize the gloomy,
troubled image transmitted to him by
racism. In this situation, how can he live
in terms of his own culture which has
been reduced to half- formed .bits and
pieces? It tends to become a desiccated
caricature of the culture from which it
springs, and this opens the door to
another form of fanaticism and in¬
tolerance. He retreats into himself and
cultivates a nostalgic, quasi-neurotic at¬
tachment to his original culture which
has not travelled well. He is faced with a
problem which he did not encounter in
his own country: the problem of roots.
This question of identity is brutally raised
by the children who are born in the land
of exile; this is a serious existential
problem for if it is not answered it may I

alienate these children from their
parents. They will be removed from their
families and will seek other landmarks,
elsewhere.
The children in turn reject the image of
the father who has been devalued, bat¬
tered by hostility and poverty. They
neither want to be like him nor to follow
the path he has taken. They also know
that they belong to the blocked genera¬
tion whose future is uncertain and whose
identity is troubled and confused. They
are victims of a twofold racism: that
which strikes the whole community and
that which closes the doors of life against
them because no one was expecting,them
and they fit into no one's plans. They are
absent from the land of their fathers
the mother who forgets her grand¬
children; they are unwelcome in the place
where they were born. These adolescents
do not know where to go nor what image
to create for themselves to escape from
poverty and exclusion. They improvise a
culture with whatever is at hand.
Although they are citizens of the host
country, they are scarcely accepted. The
identity card does not obliterate the face.
This clouding of the identity, this
dislocation of selfhood would be less
serious, or at any rate could be over¬
come, if other events and ways of think¬
ing were not becoming prevalent in the
Western world. In the 1980s denigration
of the Third World, its cultures and
religions, especially Islam, is in the air.
For some a hotchpotch of ideas and im¬
pressions takes the place of structured
thought: Arab, Muslim, African, etc. are
all shunted into the same siding of con¬
tempt. This racism immediately rejects,
without analys^ and without reason,
everything that originates from or bears
traces of this wretched, ill-developed and
above all ill-loved Third World.
The Argentine writer Jorge Luis
Borges wrote in Fictions: "I thought that
a man could perhaps be the enemy of
other men, of other moments of other
men, but not of a country; not of the
fireflies, the words, the gardens, the
streams and the sunsets." This is a
perverse and widespread form of
violence. It only takes a few TV images,
a few prejudices softened by laughter, a
few pseudo-scientific untruths uttered
with gravity and underwritten by well-
known people for this vision of the world
to become accepted and for racism to
become an unconscious, natural and
everyday practice.
At the end of his book Au Péril de la.
Science, the French geneticist Albert Jac¬
quard notes that "our society secretes
racism. Most often unconsciously we
make this poison which destroys our very
selves; we insist 'I am not a racist,
but...' "
A civilization which does not take a
hard look at Xhose of its mechanisms
which are left to the vicissitudes of
brutality is a waning civilization which in
the course of time mingles with the bar¬
barism of this poison it has allowed to
spread, either through lack of vigilance
or through arrogance and a feeling of
superiority.
"The other person, the foreigner, transmits back to the host society an
image in which that society recognizes itself but which it rejects
because it is an image which highlights its contradictions and
underscores its malaise and its inadequacies", writes Tahar Ben
Jelloun. But racism, like this distorting mirror in a Paris children's
playground, is not only a phenomenon which disturbs, it caricatures all
perception of what is foreign or simply different.

MYTHS UNDER
THE MICROSCOPE
by Albert Jacquard
MAN is a creature endowed with the fabulous power
of self-construction, the ability to participate
in his own creation; but the price of this capacity
is investment with its opposite: that of self-destruction. The
latter may take violent forms even the collective suicide of
the species has now become possible, because of the ex¬
istence of nuclear weapons. But it also manifests itself in
mean, shifty, surreptitious types of behaviour, among
which racism is surely the most widespread.
Scorn for others because they belong to a different group
is by no means a recent phenomenon, but it is one which
during the present century has developed along new lines,
with the assertion that "recent discoveries of modern
science" and "biologically proven models" justify the
classification of human populations in hierarchical order.
If scientific progress had indeed led to such conclusions,
we would be obliged to take them into account, irrespective
of our moral, philosophical or religious opinions. But what
science tells us today, notably where the most relevant
disciplinegenetics is concerned, is the exact opposite:
to claim, on biological grounds, that certain individuals
within a given group, or certain groups, naturally constitute
an élite is totally to misunderstand the message of biology.
Awareness that scientists should be given the opportuni¬
ty of stating their views on the subject, unequivocally and
before the widest possible audience, led Unesco to organize
in Athens, in the spring of 1981, a symposium where
ALBERT JACQUARD is a French geneticist who teaches at the
Universities of Paris VI and Geneva. He is head of the genetics depart¬
ment of France's National Institute of Demographic Studies (INED) in
Paris. He is the author of a number of works including Genetics of
Human Populations, 7978.
representatives of various disciplines could set out their
most recent findings, and where racist arguments could be
countered in a reasoned, dispassionate manner.
Twenty-two scientists were thus able to spend a week
discussing the issues involved in a totally frank and open at¬
mosphere, bringing from a wide spectrum of countries that
included Lebanon, Tunisia, Morocco, Israel, Mexico,
France, Ivory Coast, Norway, the USA and the USSR, con¬
tributions in the fields of anthropology, ethnology,
psychology, genetics, sociology, history, mathematics, law
and philosophy.
The diversity of cultures and disciplines represented
strengthened, rather than weakened, the intensity of the
debates; the genuine interdisciplinarity which characterized
the exchange of views enabled each participant to under¬
stand the ideas communicated by the others and to share
with them his own questionings and commentaries.
Racism was successively examined in relation to the
following branches of learning: genetics; psychology and
neurobiology; sociology; anthropology and ethnology;
history and prehistory.
At the conclusion of the Symposium, the participating
scientists, together with the representatives of Unesco,
drew up a joint Appeal, the terms of which were discussed
at length and unanimously approved (see the Unesco
Courier, May 1981).
Genetics and racism. Advances in the field of genetics
have made it possible to determine with accuracy the con¬
tent of the biological heritage of human populations;
whereas, during the past centuries, attempts at racial defini¬
tion were based on observable, external features such as
skin colour, hair texture, and cranial structure, examination
Racism has historical roots. It has not been a universal pheno
menon. Many contemporary societies and cultures show little trace of
it. It was not evident for long periods in world history. Many forms
of racism have arisen out of the conditions of conquest, out of the
justification ofNegro slavery and its aftermath of racial inequality in
the West, and out of the colonial relationship. Among other examples
is that ofanti-semitism, which has played a particular role in history,
with Jews being the chosen scapegoat to take the blame for problems
and crises met by many societies.

i> of these characteristics has now been replaced by the in¬
vestigation of the genetic structures which determine them.
The overall frequency with which various genes are en¬
countered in the members of a given group constitutes the
genetic structure of that group. The differences between
the structures of two populations can be synthesiz'ed by
establishing a "distance" calculated from frequencies
observed in each group. The definition of races thus in¬
volves grouping together populations between which
genetic distances are small, and attributing to different
races populations between which genetic distances are
wide. '.
Where the human species is concerned, however, this
procedure proves fruitless. Migratory movements have
taken place on such a scale, and the isolation of individual
groups has been so short-lived that differentiations between
groups have not reached a level which makes it possible to
trace boundaries between separate, relatively
homogeneous populations. The variability of the human
species, which is considerable, is not to be explained in
terms of the differences between the average genetic
distances between various groups, but in terms of the dif¬
ferences to be found in individual members of the same
group. According to findings published by Richard Lewontin
in 1974, the average genetic distance between two in¬
dividuals increases by only 7 or 8 per cent when they belong
to two different nations, and by only 1 5 per cent when they
belong to two different "races".
Consequently, the type of grouping described above can
only be arbitrary. For the geneticist the concept of race cor¬
responds to no stable or objective reality where humankind
is concerned.
Genetics also provides us with an argument to set against
the second proposition of racist theory: that races can not
only be defined, but can also be classified by order of
superiority.
In fact, investigation of mechanisms of selection reveals
that their effect is not to retain the "best" and to eliminate
what is less satisfactory, but rather to preserve the coex¬
istence of a great variety of characteristics. Wealth, in
biological terms, is not synonymous with "good" genes,
but with genetic diversity: the "best" group is that which
has conserved the widest variety of genes, irrespective of
the composition of that variety.
From this point of view, therefore, it is obviously impossi¬
ble to invoke- biological arguments to justify some sort of
"natural" hierarchy of individuals or populations.
Psychology, neurology and racism. When psychology
became "scientific" in the mid-nineteenth century, it set
itself the task of comparing the intellectual performances of
individuals and groups. This analysis of differences was
quickly replaced by attempts to establish relationships of
superiority and inferiority. Techniques of testing were devis¬
ed whereby human beings were classified in relation to an
implicitly accepted norm, the average behaviour of modern
Western society. As a general rule, the results of such tests
are presented in numerical form, as the Intelligence Quo¬
tient, or IQ. This measurement is widely used, but it is rarely
interpreted in a way which takes into account the limits of
its significance.
The mere fact of expressing the IQ in numerical form
creates the illusion that it measures a magnitude with an in¬
dependent existence. In reality, however, comparisons bet¬
ween individuals of different cultures or between groups
which are made using IQ are, by virtue of the definition of
IQ itself, devoid of any real meaning.
Misunderstandings about the IQ are particularly
dangerous when they are related to the problem of "innate
and acquired" characteristics. Abuse of the concept of
heritability, devised by geneticists, has led certain
psychologists to attribute variations in IQ between in¬
dividuals or groups to a combination of genetic and en¬
vironmental factors (the ratio being generally of the order of
80 per cent for the former and 20 per cent for the latter). In
fact, none of the conditions necessary to validate the
measurements of heritability are here present; the figures
advanced are thus not even inaccurate, they are
meaningless.
26
Sociology and racism. Racism should not be considered
as the inevitable product of a necessary sequence of cause
and effect. More particularly, it is false to see racism as a
mere consequence of economic phenomena, when it is in
fact an interaction in which racial animosity and the quest
for a scapegoat combine and focus on a minority the ag-
gressivity engendered by failures and setbacks of all kinds,
notably economic.
It is not objective economic situations that encourage
racism, but the subjective interpretations of those situa¬
tions. The manner in which a situation is perceived is of
greater consequence than the situation itself. The process
is thus one in which political action plays a decisive role, and
where the media, by virtue of the notions to which they give
currency and the manner in which they present the facts,
also play a decisive part. The invocation of a "threshold of
tolerance" is a good example of the use of a mechanism
presented as natural, in order to justify the rejection of
minorities. In fact, such thresholds cannot be measured,
and correspond to nothing that can be objectively defined.
The situation of those who are oppressed because of their
"race" is not the outcome of an inevitable malediction; it is
In the last thirty years the classification of the human species
into a small number of major "races" has been increasingly
contested by scientists as imprecise, arbitrary, and of little or
no biological significance. One obstacle to the establishment of
such a classification is revealed by the inconsistencies that
arise when different kinds of criteria are used, such as blood
group systems on the one hand, and anthropometric data on
the other. The Ainus of northern Japan (top right) have a white

simply an observable state of affairs which cannot be
justified in any way.
The often distorted propagation of certain arguments ad¬
vanced by sociobiologists can prove extremely dangerous.
Sociobiology deals with the causesand circumstances, in¬
cluding those of a genetic nature, which determine the
organization of animal societies, ranging from termites to
primates. The extrapolation of its findings to humankind is
obviously risky and should only be undertaken with the
greatest care. For example, the assertion that most human
behaviour is genetically conditioned rests on no serious
evidence. Little caution is shown by certain journalists who
claim that theories which are still the subject of debate are
"scientifically proved"; other writers conceal dogmatic at¬
titudes behind what they claim is scientific evidence.
Anthropology, ethnology and racism. Anthropology sets
out to make a global study of man, integrating the physical,
genetic, cultural and historical points of view. In all these do¬
mains, individuals differ from each other, and anthropology
endeavoured, over a long period, to take these differences
into account in preparing classifications and where possible
in tracing the outlines of more or less homogeneous groups,
sidered to belong to the white race. In terms of blood grouping,
however, they are much closer to the so-called "yellow" Orien¬
tal populations. Many "scientific" race classifications have
given rise to a misleading idea of "physical types". Blond-
haired "blacks", above right, frequently found among
Australian aboriginal groups are one example of the futility of
racial archetypes of this kind. Vogul populations of Siberia,
above left, differ in many ways from the "yellow" or Mongoloid
races to which they were assigned by classical anthropology.
or "races". The latter were thus defined as the product of
a division of humanity according to transmissible physical
characteristics. But this analysis is of doubtful value
because of the importance of the genetic exchanges occurr¬
ing between groups, the intensity of which has varied in dif¬
ferent ages and regions. Such exchanges have increased
during the past few centuries, and consequently groups
which might have been defined as "races" in the past have
disappeared, giving place to other, provisional regroupings.
But the essential contribution of anthropology is to show
that the feelings of superiority found in most human groups
is related to their culture, and not to their biological heritage;
their sentiments are ethnocentric, and not racist. Racism, as
a belief in the natural superiority of a given group, is of com¬
paratively recent origin. It developed parallel to the colonial
expansion of the European powers, finding scientific
justification in a mistaken extrapolation of the theories of
Darwin, social Darwinism. Reaching its height during the
period of Nazism, it has subsequently declined appreciably,
despite the rearguard actions of certain groups (which ap¬
pear notably in The Mankind Quarterly), or individuals, such
as the psychologist Arthur Jensen.
Anthropologists have reacted forcefully; for example, an
important study by R. Sinha, of India, has shown that "there
is no innate difference in intellectual capacities between the
different racial groups".
In the last analysis, the problem with which we are con¬
fronted is not one of justifying or invalidating racist at¬
titudes, but rather that of understanding why such attitudes
persist, despite a total absence of justification.
History, prehistory and racism. Over the centuries, racist
theories have developed in response to the requirements of
dominant groups. Not infrequently, they have embodied
contradictory premisses. The eighteenth century, for exam¬
ple, saw the simultaneous adoption of the myth of the
"noble savage" as opposed to the "wicked sophisticate",
and the uninhibited practice of slavery, while, at the present
time, when the findings of science are demolishing the very
foundations of racism, there are those who consistently in¬
voke science in their attempts to promote its resurgence.
Historical studies enable us to compare the mechanisms
which determine the evolution of a racist society (which in¬
evitably drifts into a state of tension between dominant and
dominated groups and in which the range of alternatives
grows steadily smaller), and those which govern the
development of a progressive, pluralist society (open to in¬
terchange and to all the different forms of creativity which
become possible thanks to a permanent ferment of ideas
and action).
The resurgence of racism presents a challenge to which
we must respond by a steadfast call for the social diver¬
sification which it is in our power to achieve: diversification
through science and technology, through culture, through
recourse to our origins and through freedom available to all.

THE logic of the relations between
societies, whether they are con-
flictual or complementary, is
governed by the interests of the societies
concerned. When these encounters bet¬
ween societies are determined by the need
to dominate, resulting in social inequality,
exploitation, and war, the social practices
and ideological theories set forth and
ritualized by those in power assume a racist
character. The extent of the phenomenon
is determined by historical circumstances.

modern times has given the ideology of
racism an overriding legitimacy, whilst
simultaneously creating the conditions for
its negation.
The earliest reactions against racism,
still only fragmentary and unilateral, occur
within the context of ethnological reflec¬
tions on other peoples who are viewed as
"exotic". Such attitudes were expressed by
the eighteenth-century French school of
political philosophy of which Montesquieu
and Diderot were leading figures, and in
which the foundations of a critical
ethnology can be perceived. At the end of
the nineteenth century and the beginning
of the twentieth, along with the first stirr¬
ings of nationalist movements came
demands from black peoples which found
their fullest expression in a profusion of
universalist movements of political
thought such as pan-Africanism and
cultural movements such as négritude. But
it was not until the end of the Second
World War that the struggle against racism
became universal both in theory and in
practice. This was due to the convergence
of a number of factors.
The self-proclaimed "civilized" West
was astonished by its own barbarity:
Nazism and Jewish genocide raised the
question of racism in deeper and wider
terms than before. The colonized peoples
considered the right to independence the
central factor of the historical process.
Soon Black Americans were claiming a na¬
tional identity on the basis of their ethno-
historical difference. As a result of this
dynamic process, social practices have
emerged, have achieved at certain times
and in certain places an organic unity bet¬
ween "the criticism of arms" and "the
arms of criticism", and have revealed the
full significance of the struggle against
racism.

The West, which had just emerged from
a devastating war, was primarily concern¬
ed with the problems of social and
economic reconstruction and above all
with the problem of peace. One important
task that lay ahead was that of establishing
institutions which would enable culture,
science, education and the dialogue bet¬
ween nations to play their proper role in a
quest for world-wide coexistence which
would spring from the unity and
multiplicity of cultures. Organizations with
a universal mission such as Unesco were
created. Over the years Unesco has set
forth telling analyses of racism on the basis
of scientific propositions and in the name
of culture. These include the "Statement
on Race" (1950), the "Statement on the
Nature of Race and Race Differences"
(1951), the "Statement on Race and Racial
Prejudice" of 1967, and a Declaration on
Race and Racial Prejudice which was set
forth in 1978. Unesco thus provided tools
for the shaping of polices which could
bring this social evil to an end.
The dynamic of the struggle against
racism was not linear. Changes were in¬
deed taking place in Western societies, but
these societies first had to face the loss of
their vast colonial empires, then far-
reaching social movements (the alternative
culture in the United States, feminist
movements in different parts of the world)
which would raise in both theoretical and
practical terms the question of the complex
and hidden content of racism. The rejec¬
tion of all that is different (ethnic
minorities, women, the old, the young)
stimulated these movements to ask ques¬
tions about the role of culture and of cer¬
tain components of the social fabric which,
in a sense, structure the patterns of think¬
ing, the habits and the behaviour in which
social practices are rooted. These questions
have largely focused on socialization. As a
dynamic means of transmitting cultural
values, education has a prominent role in
this uninterrupted process whereby the in¬
dividual becomes a social being.
In all societies this transmission, far
from being an innocuous process, obeys a
logic according to which the social
mechanisms necessary for preserving the
status quo are reproduced. To examine the
question of education is to examine its
functions and goals, to analyse how it
functions, and to define how it meets its
objectives. It also means contributing to
the process whereby political action and
scientific reflection are brought closer
together. But in addition it means trying to
understand how the individual becomes an
actor in the racist drama not only in terms
of economic and social conditions but in
terms of the psychological and historical
conditions in which his ego is structured.

By widening the critical field of racism,
social movements have underscored the
fact that, within the boundaries of a single
nation, cultural unity is actually cultural
multiplicity and that consequently the pro¬
cesses whereby people identify with a
culture are neither homogeneous nor
monolithic. They have also stressed the
fact that in certain historical conditions
identity often conceals a desire to dominate
(as, for example, in the institutional
framework of the relations between men
and women). In these cases the logic of
protest highlights difference and makes it a
necessary element in new cultural forms.
In this context the struggle against racism
makes a specific demand: it takes the form
of the assertion of the right to be different.
National independence movements have
set the concept of culture against the con¬
cept of race. This approach has become a
fundamental element in resistance to col¬
onialism, taking a variety of forms
(political, economic, or armed) depending
on ' the interplay of historical cir¬
cumstances. Analysis of contemporary
texts and documents is illuminating. Thus
Amilcar Cabrai (1921-1973), leader of the'
African Party for the Independence of
Guinea and Cape Verde, analysed in these
terms the problem of cultural resistance in
a changing society which is becoming the
subject of its own history:
"A people which liberates itself from
foreign domination will only be really free
if, without complexes and without
underestimating the importance of the
positive contributions of the oppressor's
culture and of other cultures, it takes the
high road of its own culture which draws
sustenance from the living reality of its en¬
vironment and rejects harmful influences
and any kind of subjection to foreign
cultures. Therefore, it can be seen that if
imperialist domination has a vital need for
practices of cultural oppression, national
liberation is necessarily an act of culture."
In China, Mao Ze Dong defined the im¬
portance of the "cultural front" in this
passage on "fronts of combat":
"We are struggling for the liberation of
the Chinese people on many different
fronts; two of them are the front of the pen
and the front of the sword, in other words
the cultural front and the military front.
To vanquish the enemy, we must first of all
rely on the army which carries the gun. But
this army alone is insufficient; we also need
an army of culture, indispensable to unite
our ranks and to conquer the enemy."
In Algeria, the Congress of La Soum-
mam (1956), in embryonic and deliberately
reticent form, and the Tripoli Programme
(1962) more explicitly, both treated the
question of culture and the role of intellec¬
tuals in the framework of an Islamic
language and thought. The Tripoli Pro¬
gramme went so far as to define the new
culture which should be, it says, "national,
revolutionary and scientific".
Whatever turns these revolutions have
taken, it must be noted that these analyses
all share an acceptance of culture as a key
element in the liberation process which
30
transcends the different presuppositions
underlying them, the different battle¬
grounds from which they came, and any
possible contradictions between the goals
at which they aim. They also introduce a
new set of problems, those of cultural
identity.
Individuals, groups and societies are
producers of works and cultural values
through which they recognize themselves;
this gives them an awareness of belonging
to a culture and of attachment to it. The
link thus forged between the individual
and the group is expressed in language, in
what is held to be sacred, in techniques, in
In this way it is proved that beings con¬
sidered inferior from a racial point of view
are capable of making history, in other
words of thinking and acting on the real
world by transforming it; building new na¬
tions, creating new States, weaving new
social relationships, acting on the world
stage. This has been the practical response
to theories of race and racial inequality. It
is a response which shows that, in the con¬
text of the independence struggle, the com¬
bat against racism is waged through the af¬
firmation of the right to identity.
If in different times and places the strug¬
gle against racism enhances the recognition
All peoples of the world possess equal faculties for attaining the
highest level in intellectual, technical, social, economic, cultural and
political development.
The differences between the achievements of the different peoples are
entirely attributable to geographical, historical, political, economic,
social and cultural factors. Such differences can in fio case serve as a
pretext for any rank-ordered classification of nations or peoples.
Declaration on Race and Racial Prejudice, Unesco, Paris, 1978
social organization, in oral and written
traditions, etc. Each society communicates
with others through this set of cultural
characteristics which makes it unique.
Thus it is through the affirmation of a
cultural identity that the individual can
achieve a better understanding of the
denial of racism by the struggle for in¬
dependence. "The cultural formulation of
nationalism", in this struggle, is expressed
in the affirmation of a form of identity
which restores to the members of the socie¬
ty their role as producers of cultural works.
Their products will take many forms,
depending on the historical context. Here
are some of these forms: the mustering of
men for a parting of the ways which ap¬
peals to the historical memory but which
above all restructures the social arena (the
community dissolved by colonization
rebuilds itself in a different fashion) and
the political arena (the individual becomes
a citizen again and challenges the domi¬
nant power through the organization); the
emergence of a new intellectual whose
work contributes to an understanding of
the contradictions of history (through
political texts, speeches which incite to ac¬
tion, the theorization of revolutionary
practice, the implementation of revolu¬
tionary theories); the creation of new social
relationships in which individuals and
groups take creativity and sociability as the
yardstick of the effectiveness of political
action (the conjunction of human
capacities, desires and needs); and the
establishment of new networks of com¬
munication in which the language despised
by the colonizer again becomes the
favoured medium of social and political
intercourse.
of cultural identity and/or cultural dif¬
ference, and counts on different kinds of
political, social and institutional support, it
nevertheless always appeals to a single con¬
stant: culture and its paradigm, cultural
identity.
Consequently, to reflect on the meaning
of the struggle against racism is, on the one
hand, to note the upheavals it has caused
in patterns of thought, in symbols and
practices of social criticism, and on the
other to ask new questions.
Since each of these struggles is an un¬
folding truth, in a given time and a given
place, account must be taken of each
specific society. Every society always har¬
bours conflicts between hierarchies
because it is differentiated in its economic,
political and social structure. Furthermore,
it often expresses a political culture which
generates systems of power in which the
State dominates the social body, and in
which the civil society cannot assert itself
as a subject of creativity.
History teaches us that theory and prac¬
tice of whatever kind are not consumed in
the arena of a revolution, and that behind
each ruling unit and manipulated by it are
concealed symbols, codes and myths which
attribute to the individual (the leader) and
to the function a nature which is more than
human.
In this context it is impossible .to
dissociate the struggle against racism from
the combat for power and cultural
democracy. This means that in their think¬
ing and in their action individuals and
groups involved in change must challenge
"blind necessity".

MIXED
METAMORPHOSIS
by Roberto Fernández Retamar
ROBERTO FERNANDEZ RETAMAR,
Cuban poet and essayist, is a professor at
Havana University and directo/ of the
magazine Casa de las Americas. His essays
and anthologies of his poems have been
translated into a number of languages.
IN an article published in the August/
September 1977 issue of the Unesco
Courier, the great Brazilian novelist
Jorge Amado wrote :
"Brazil is a country of racial mix¬
ture. This is an obvious and incon¬
trovertible fact. The Brazilian experi¬
ment is of immense importance in the
search for a solution to the terrible
racial problem that afflicts the world.
For in Brazil the most diverse races
have constantly been mingled. What
Brazilian could honestly claim to be of
'pure' descent in a country where
Iberians, Slavs, Anglo-Saxons and
others have become inextricably mixed
with black and Amerindian peoples
and with Arabs, Jews and Japanese?"
These remarks are equally valid for
the Antilles (with the important addi¬
tion of the Chinese and Indian input)
whose societies developed upon the
framework of the plantation economy
and slave labour. In neither case is mix¬
ing primarily racial; it is above all a
cultural mixing which, going much
deeper than the linguistic pluralism in¬
troduced by the various colonial
powers, includes a lingua franca of
joyful music, convergent mythologies,
and a rhythm and a style of life spring¬
ing from many sources yet with a
character all its own. We Brazilians and
Antilleans, therefore, can and must
present ourselves to the world as ex¬
amples of the integration of mixed
cultures. This is what prompted the
Brazilian scholar Gilberto Freyre to
quip that in his country football was
"more 'Brazilianly' dionysian than
'Britishly' apollonian".
The rich, dramatic history of the
region from the time when, at the end
of the fifteenth century, the Europeans
began to arrive and make it, in the
words of the Dominican writer Juan
Bosch, "a frontier of empire", until to¬
day, has formed the substratum of this
mixing of the peoples who settled there
voluntarily or, more often, under
duress and in widely varying
conditions.
Can it be assumed, then, that
cultural syncretism, so widespread and
indeed so inevitable between us, will
result in the disappearance of racism?
It would be wonderful if we could
answer yes to this question, but we can¬
not. It has been said that, apart from
some very isolated communities such as
certain Inuit (Eskimo) groups in the ex¬
treme north and certain Amazonian In¬
dian tribes, there are no really "pure"
races or cultures in the western
hemisphere. In other words, here, as in
almost every part of the globe today,
intermingling of peoples is the norm;
yet racism has until now survived, in
some notorious cases at a level which is
an affront to human dignity.
The extremely dubious concept of
"race" emerged in the early days of
capitalism as a justification for the col¬
onial depredations without which, and
above all without the terrible scourge
of slavery, as the Trinidadian Eric
Williams has pointed out, capitalism as
we know it would not exist. The word
"race" itself, with the meaning it took
on at that time, did not exist in, any
language and, significantly, had to be
borrowed from zoological ter¬
minology. In its new meaning, cultural
differences, often enormous, were ig¬
nored and an artificial homogeneity
was proclaimed, which caused the
Cuban writer José Martí to declare ir¬
ritably that "there is no racial hatred
because there are no races", and the
Martinican Frantz Fanon to assert that
"the negro" was invented by the
colonizers.
Of course, there are somatic dif¬
ferences of genetic origin which
manifest themselves, either visibly or
not, in a predisposition of resistance to

certain diseases, etc. But that is all.
Race does not determine culture,
because it does not determine anything
fundamental. Cultures are created by
man irrespective of race, and if, as
sometimes happens, there is a relation¬
ship between them, what this relation¬
ship implies is that cultures modify
races and not the other way round.
According to the French anthropolo¬
gist, Claude Lévi-Strauss, "all cultures
leave their mark on the body". There is
daily proof of this. One need only walk
through the cities of a still lively
prestigious culture to see that women,
who are much more imaginative than
men in this as in many other matters,
have a habit of piercing their ears in
order to hang all kinds of objects from
them, of painting their lips, cheeks,
eyelashes and fingernails ("they paint
themselves in order to hide
themselves", said the French poet,
Paul Eluard), dress their hair in a varie¬
ty of shapes, remove the hair from
various parts of their bodies, etc. Of
course these cities may be New York,
Paris or London, and the culture in
question is Western culture a syn¬
cretic culture if ever there was one.
Facts of this kind show that one can be
of mixed culture quite apart from racial
integration. The process by which one
arrives at this give-and-take which is an
essential element of all cultural cross-
fertilizations has been felicitously
described by the Cuban writer Fernan¬
do Ortiz as transculturation.
If racial prejudice began as an alleg¬
ed justification for colonialism, then
the intermingling of races or cultures
alone will not put an end to it; what is
required is the eradication of its
original cause, namely, all forms of
colonialism, neo-colonialism, im¬
perialism, and oppression. As long as
one country "belongs" to another, as
long as some men exploit others, no
matter how intense the cross-breeding
or how entertaining the carnival in Rio
or Trinidad, the living humus of racial
prejudice will continue to reproduce
itself.
There are even certain dangers in the
idea that cultural cross-fertilization will
of itself cause racial prejudice to disap¬
pear. We should like to underline two
of these dangers. First of all, there is
the danger of creating, in one way or
another, the impression that, paradox¬
ically, race can be identified with
culture. This implies acceptance of the
theory that, apart from its relatively
unimportant biological condition, race
also has an historical incidence a
theory which prevailed from the days
of Gobineau to those of Hitler.
Secondly, to propose racial integra¬
tion as a solution for racial prejudice
belongs, in the final analysis, to the
realm of illusions like négritude. We
know that this term, whose success is
due to a famous poem written by Aimé
Césaire of Martinique, ended by
creating a new mystification. However,
before it was called by this name,
négritude had a number of undeniably
positive aspects, such as the exaltation
of the negro by men like the Jamaican
Marcus Garvey. It would therefore be
unfair to deny all that we owe to claims
of this kind, insofar as they imposed
respect and admiration for one of our
essential roots. But because of its
subsequent adulteration, the concept
finally lost authority. The vicissitudes
of what started as a noble purpose and
finally became a hostile weapon were
accurately recounted in a recent book,
Bonjour et Adieu à la Négritude, by the
Haitian poet René Depestre.
What really halts racial prejudice is
the frankly anticolonialist and anti-
oppressive attitude of men like the
Puerto Rican Ramón E. Betances, who
has made the great figures of Haiti's
history known to a wider public and is
an apostle of his country's in¬
dependence; Anténor Firmin of Haiti,
who in his work, De l'Egalité des Races
Humaines, published in 1885, declared
that "the anti-philosophical, pseudo-
scientific doctrine of racial inequality
rests exclusively on the idea of the ex¬
ploitation of man by man"; the Cuban
José Martí, whose struggle is well
known and who wrote in 1894 that
"man has no special rights because he
belongs to one race or another. Let us
speak of man, and already we speak of
all rights. Man is more than white,
more than mulatto, more than negro",
or Frantz Fanon of Martinique who
twenty years after his death, is still in
the vanguard of a struggle.
Integration, both racial and cultural,
is certainly an indispensable step on the
road to the eradication of racialism,
but it is not enough. We do not deny
the enormous importance of integra¬
tion. What we do deny is that it can be
regarded as a deus ex machina for
achieving this eradication. Decisive
steps towards putting an end to
racialism can be seen above all in events
such as the extraordinary Haitian
Revolution, which opened the way for
the independence of our America; or
the constitution of nations in the strug¬
gle for independence, as in the case of
Cuba and the Dominican Republic dur¬
ing the second half of the 19th century,
from which emerged leaders like
Gregorio Luperón and Antonio Maceo
who were senior citizens of their respec¬
tive countries and of the world before
they were white, negro or mulatto.
This vital aim has rarely been given
more beautiful expression than in the
immortal poem Madera de Ébano
("Ebony"), by the Haitian Jacques
Roumain:
Africa I have remembered you,
Africa, you are within me
like the splinter in the wound
like the protective fetish in the heart
of the village... However,
I only want to belong to your race
peasant workers of all lands.
It is in this spirit of fraternal struggle
that man (in the Antilles and
throughout the world) is moving for¬
ward towards unity without losing his
plurality, which we prefer to call his
richness and which will express itself in
the most varied colours, rhythms,
music and dreams. By force of habit,
the term "white" is applied in¬
discriminately to pale-skinned, blonde-
haired, clear-eyed Nordics and to olive-
skinned, black-haired, dark-eyed
Mediterranean men. A superior stage
will be reached when even the very
word "race" will be forgotten or
restored to its zoological origin, and
from one end of the world to the other,
as if it were the most natural thing, we
shall repeat the still arresting words of
José Martí: "Our fatherland is
humanity."
Roberto Fernández Retamar
The paradox of the human race is that its unity and its progress
are dependent upon the diversity of the individuals and groups of
which it is composed. The cord that binds all branches of mankind
together, our common humanity, is too strong to be broken yet
yielding enough to allow each group or culture the liberty to make
its own contribution to the universal edifice. Right, the central
pillar and framework of a house of the Djerma people of western
Niger.

The Second World Conference
to Combat Racism
In accordance with a decision taken by
the General Assembly of the United Na¬
tions at its 35th session, the Second
World Conference to Combat Racism
and Racial Discrimination was held in
Geneva from 1 to 13 August 1983. The
work of the Conference centred on the
adoption of ways and means of ensuring
complete and universal application of
United Nations resolutions relating to
racism, racial discrimination and apar¬
theid. The Conference adopted a
Declaration recommending the pro¬
clamation of a 2nd Decade for Action to
Combat Racism and Racial Discrimina¬
tion, as well as a Programme of Action.
The Declaration was adopted by a vote
of 101 in favour to 12 against, with 3
abstentions; the Programme of Action by
a vote of 104 in favour to none against,
with 10 abstentions. The Declaration
reaffirms that "any doctrine of racial
superiority is scientifically false, morally
condemnable, socially unjust and
dangerous, and has no justification
whatsoever..."; that apartheid, as "an
institutionalized form of racism is a total¬
ly abhorrent affront to the conscience
and dignity of mankind, a crime against
humanity and a threat to international
peace and security"; and that "in South
Africa the most extreme form of racism
has led to a form of exploitation and
degradation which is in clear contradic¬
tion to the principle of human rights and
fundamental freedoms for all without
distinction as provided for in the Charter
of the United Nations."
Unesco and the World Food
Programme mark two decades
of cooperation
This year marks the 20th anniversary of
the establishment of the World Food Pro¬
gramme (WFP) by the UN and the Food
and Agriculture Organization of the UN.
Initially created to provide aid using
surplus food stocks in some of the richer
countries, the WFP today devotes the
bulk of its efforts (commitments
amounted to some $800 million in 1 982)
to using food for development through
food-for-work projects in the rural areas
of the developing world. Unesco has
been cooperating with the WFP ever
since its inception, notably on school
feeding programmes, food-for-work
school construction programmes, and
food-for-work projects which support
the rescue or restoration of cultural
monuments and sites.
A World Competition
for Young Architects
On the occasion of International Youth
Year, proclaimed by the United Nations
for 1985, Unesco, in collaboration with
the International Union of Architects and
with the assistance of Japan Airlines, is
organizing a world competition on the
theme "Tomorrow's Habitat" in which
students in schools of architecture and
young architects under the age of 35 are
invited to participate. Preliminary na¬
tional competitions are being held as of
September 1983, with candidates being
required to submit projects in the form of
drawings, photographs and diagrams, on
two boards each measuring 700 mm by
1000 mm. National competition orga¬
nizers will send 5 selected entries from
their country to Unesco HQ before 30
April 1984. An international jury will
meet in May 1 984 to choose the 1 0 best
projects. Each of the 1 0 prizewinners will
be required to build a model of his or her
project to be exhibited at the Unesco
stand at the International Exposition
Tsukuba '85 in Japan which is expected
to receive some 20 million visitors in 6
months. A two-week trip to Tokyo and
Tsukuba Expo '85 will be awarded to the
prizewinners. The competition will
receive coverage in a forthcoming issue
of the Unesco Courier. For further details
please contact your Unesco National
Commission or 'World Competition for
Young Architects', Unesco, Office of
Public Information, 7 Place de Fontenoy,
75700 Paris, France.
Unesco celebrates
Karl Jaspers centenary
The centenary of the birth of the
philosopher Karl Jaspers was celebrated
at a ceremony held at Unesco's Paris HQ
on 17 June 1983 and attended by in¬
tellectuals representing all the world
regions. In an address, the Director-
General of Unesco, Mr. Amadou-Mahtar
M'Bow pointed out that in the 1950s
Jaspers had clearly seen that the world
faced a choice between the extinction of
all life on earth and the moral and political
conversion of humanity to a new way of
thinking, acting and living together. He
also cited the admirable statement by
Jaspers which echoes the underlying
premise of Unesco's Constitution: "To
make oneself accessible to all that is
historically different, without becoming
unfaithful to one's own historicity... To
accept the inevitable combat with what
is historically different, but constantly to
elevate this combat to a level at which it
becomes fraternal, one in which the
adversaries join together in the truth
which arises in community." Is not this
the secret of all true solidarity? Mr.
M'Bow asked. M. Franz Blankart of the
International Council for Philosophy and
Humanistic Studies, Professor H.G.
Gadamer of the University of Heidelberg,
and Madame Jeanne Hirsch, president of
the Karl Jaspers Foundation, also took
part in the ceremony.
Correction
A reader from the People's Republic of
China has written to draw our attention
to an error in the caption on the back
cover of our December 1 982 issue which
featured portraits of women belonging to
1 6 of China's 55 national minorities. The
portrait bottom right showed a woman of
the Kazak and not, as indicated in the
caption, the Uighur group. Many thanks
to our reader for spotting this mistake.

<![CDATA[
The great Cuban painter Wifredo Lam (1902-1982)
was bom in the heart of a region with a long history
of mtermingling of peoples and cuitares. By his birth
Lam inherited the four basic elements of the Carib¬
bean ethnic mtermix (African, Indian, European and
Chinese) and in his work he succeeded in combin¬
ing his Antillean artistic heritage with cubism, sur¬
realism and the best of the European avant-garde.
Wifredo Lam played his part in the struggle against
racism by illustrating, in his life and in his art, the fer¬
tile contributions peoples and cultures can bring to
each other.
