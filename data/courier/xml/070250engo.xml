BOOKS WITHOUT CHAINS
In the same way as they arrange for the cleaning of street,
collection of reuse, maintenance of road, local authors-

citizen, old and young. Nearly every library has its
own special children's section. (Photo J. Allan Cash.)

THE PUBLIC LIBRARY...
P HOBABL Y fO\'most of usbooks and magazines are
such a common part of our
liyes that we have lost all sense of
wonder that we should hay daily
in our hands one of the most
amazing tools invented by civiliz-
ed man for his service. woe cannot
easily stand back and see in per-
spectin all the varied contribu-
tions which books make to our
enjoyment, our daily business,
our scientific and cultural ad-
vancement and our education
- nor is it easy, even for Unesco
which has a duty to do this, to
understand all the problems
which the making and distribu-
tion of books pose to the modern
world.
If we are lucky enough to live
in one of the countries where
books are abundant, it is difficult
to realize that in most countries
there is still a book famine, par-
ticularly at the two extremes of
book use, by children in schools
and by the scientists in their
research stations and laboratories.
If we live in these famine areas
it is equally hard to understand
that in many countries the most
difficult problems come not from
scarcity of books but from their
abundance. In these places the
daily problem for the scientist,
particuiarty, is not to find some-
thing to read but to find exactly
what he needs in the bewildering
mass of scientific literature.
To meet both the problems ofscarcity and abundance, one
of the simplest, most in-
genious and most universally
useful of all social institutions,
the library, has been invented.
Many thousands of years ago,
libraries were made, obviously
enough, to meet only a problem
of scarcity. They, were the
strongly defended fortresses of
recorded knowledge and even
now this characteristic of a great
historical library still survives.
But ever since the Renaissance,
libraries and the users af libraries
have been opening doors and
windows, letting light into the
dark storehouses, devising new
techniques not to preserve only
but to diffuse the knowledge
hidden in the pages of their mil-
lions of books and periodicals.
New kinds of libraries have
been created ; popular libraries
for ordinary men, women and
children to give them free access
to ever kind of literature for
entertainment, study and infor-
mation, and scientific libraries
with complex documentation
services so that everything-that a
research worker wants can be
instantaneously found for him
however old or however new.
'\7'ET, despite the wide accept-ance in theory of the impor-
tance of the public library
for education and recreation, the
fact is that almost nowhere in the
world is adequate library service
freely available to all the people.
In the United States, for
example, a searching public li-
brary enquiry completed in 1950
showed that while 20, 000, 000
people were library card holders,
5, 000, 000 (or approximately one-
fourth of the national population)
were without library services of
any kind. Even so, the United
States is well-on'for library ser-
vice as compared to most other
countries, with notable exceptions
such as Denmark, Sweden and
Great Britain.
If public libraries are essential
in technically advanced countries,
it seems that they would be a
hundred times more necessary in
under-developed regions-where
books and money to buy them are
extremelv scarce. In these re-
gions many people are learning
to read and write in vast pro-
grammes of fundamental edu-
cation. What use is it to teach
people to read if being literate
they have nothing to read or only
the strip cartoons and the trivial
but dangerous trash that can be
found even where there are no
good books at all ? Without libra-
ries, it is likely that much of the
good effect of mass education
programmes will be only ephe-
meral.
Why are so many areas
throughout the world'without
library service and why are the
existing libraries so poor ? The
elements of the problem are not
far to seek and are almost uni-
versally constant : (1) public apa-
thy. Most of the people have
never seen a library and conse-
quently do not know'wheat they
are missing. (2) Inadequate
financial support. In many
countries public libraries have
not yet found a place in the bud-
getary sun. (3) Lack of trained
librarians and an association of
librarians to promote library
development (4) A great short-
age of publications in locally
yvritten languages so the average
person can understand them.
No quick and easy solutions pf
these problems exist. However
there is evidence that govern-
ments are becoming increasingly
aware of the need for including
public libraries in plans for
educational development. The
tremendous public response to
demonstration projects in various
places has revealed a great and
unexpected latent demand for
public library services which
needs only to be awakened.
Some librarians who can in turn
train others are being developed
in countries'without library
schools. A few have received
fellowships for observation of
library practices abroad, others
are receiving on-the-job training
in demonstration projects, and a
fair number have participated in
seminars and conferences.
Finally, large-scale efforts are
being made in various parts of
the world to teach people to
read, and to produce publications
which they can read. All of this
adds up to something more than
the proverbial drop in the bucket,
but the pail is still far from full.
A NY government which plansto establish public library
services fortunately has a
century of experience at its dis-
posal. A vast literature on the
subject exists, and there are many
specialists willing to help with
advice. Consequently it is pos-
sible to avoid major mistakes.
For one thing, it should be
apparent that the creation of pub-
lic libraries cannot be left entire-
ly to local initiative. Needed are
national and regional plans,.
national and state library legisla-
tion and a system of grants-in-
aid to local units. All of this
clearly requires a fair amount of
money, and it is hardly likely
that libraries will be constructed
for a whole country at once.
However once a nation-wide plan
is drafted, a start can be made
with one unit designed to allow
for gradual extension of library
services in the future.
... A FORCE FOR POPULAR EDUCATION
UNESCO, the United Nationstj Educational, Scientific and
Cultural Organization, has
been created by the'will of
46 countries. Its aim is to promote
peace, and social and spiritual
welfare by working through the
minds of men. The creative
power of Unesco is the force of
knowledge and international un-
derstanding.
This manifesto, by describing
the potentialities of the public
library, proclaims Unesco's belief
in the public library as a living
force for popular education and for
the growth of international under-
standing, and thereby for the pro-
motion of peace.
A democratic agency
The public library is a product
of modern democracy and a prac-
tical demonstration of democracv's
faith in universal education as a
life-long process. Though pri-
ffiarily intended to serve the edu-
cational needs of adults, the public
library should also supplement the
work of the schools in developlllg
the reading tastes of children and
young people, helping them to
become adults who can use books
with appreciation and profit. As a
democratic institution, operated by
the people for the people, the
public library should be :
Established and maintained
under clear authority of law.
Supported wholly or mainly
from public funds.
Open for free use on equal terms
to all members of the community,
regardless of occupation, creed,
class or race.
The complete public library
should provide-books, pamphlets,
magazines, newspapers, maps, pic-
tures, films, music scores and re-
cordings-and give guidance in
their use. The public library
should offer children, young peo-
ple. men and women opportunity
and encouragement :
To educate themselves conti-
nuously.
To keep abreast of progress in all
fields of knowledge.
To maintain freedom of expres-
sion and a constructively critical
attitude toward all public issues.
To be better social and political
citizens of their country and of the
world.
To be more efficient in their day-
to-day activities.
To develop their creative capa-
cities and powers of appreciation
in arts and letters.
To aid generally in the advance-
ment of knowledge,
To use their leisure time to pro-
mote personal happiness and social
well-being.
The people's university
The public library should be
active and positive in its policy
and a dynamic part of community
life. It should not tell people
what to think, but it should help
them decide what to think about.
The spotlight should be thrown
on significant issues by exhibi-
tions, booklists, discussions, leo-
tures, courses, films and individual
reading guidance. Reading inter-
est should be stimulated and the
library's services publicized
through a well-planned continuous
public relations programme. The
public library should link its ac-
tivities with the work of other
educational, cultural and social
agencies-the schools, universities,
museums, labour unions, study
clubs, adult education groups, etc.
H should also co-operate with
other libraries in the loan of pub-
lications and with library asso-
ciations for the advancement of
public librarianship. The books in
the library should be made acces-
sible on open shelves and by use
of efficient technical processes ;
and the library's services should be
brought close to the homes and
work places of the people by
means of branches and mobile
units.
With a well-trained, resourceful
and imaninative staff, and ade-
quate budget and public support, a
public library can become what it
should be-a university of the
people offering a liberal education
to all comers. Citizens of a demo-
cracy have need of such opportuni-
ties for self-education at all times.
The complexity and instability of
life today make the need an
urgent one.

Excavations of ancient cities in Egypt have uncovered some of the early temple and palace libraries dating back some 2000 years B. C. In the ruins of Karnak Temple
at Thebes archeologists found an inscription for a"House of Books". At Idfu, 50 miles away, a well-preserved library building was uncovered which was known as
"The House of Papyrus". A catalogue inscribed on a stone wall of the building reveals that the library contained books on religion, hunting, astrology, astrono-
my and many other subjects. Here, Egyptian scribes are seen writing on papyrus during the 17th century B. C. (Photo Florence Archeological Museum.)
BOOKS WITHOUT CHAINS
SINCE man first set down histhoughts in writing-on clay
tablets or papyrus, on bamboo
or silk scrolls-he has sought to
collect and preserve his writings
for posterity. The idea of a library
must be almost as old as civil-
ization itself, and the story of
libraries is the story of thought
and knowledge recorded, preserved
and made available for use.
It was in Western Asia and
Egypt that man first learned the
art of writing. He seems first to
have produced what we should
now call documents or archives-
such as laws and tribute lists-
together with religious and magic
texts and epic poems. Collections
of such writings were stored in
palaces and temples and formed
the first libraries : and since refer-
ences have been found to official
scribes in Egypt more than 0, 000
years ago, we may safely conclude
that there were libraries at that
date. At Idfu, near Thebes, a
well-preserved library building
was found, with a catalogue cut
into one of its stone walls. A
Greek writer tells us that the
library of King Osymandyas,
dating perhaps from about 1300
B. C., was called"The Dispensary
of the Soul".
The greatest of the ancient
Iesopotamian libraries was that
of King Assurbanipal at Nineveh,
dating from about fi50 B. C.. where
some 30, 000 clay tablets were
discovered by Sir Henry Layard in
1850. Some of these bear marks
of ownership, or classification or
arrangement indications, and the
THE STORY OF LIBRARIES
By Francis L. Kent, Head, Unesco Library,
library is believed to have been
thrown open for the general use of
the King's subjects. This col-
lection is now in the British
Museum in London and is our most
valuable source of information
about the civilizations of Mesopo-
tamia.
No ancient people loved learning
more than the Greeks. Aristotle
had a large collection of books
which served as a sort of university
library for his school of philos-
ophy : and it was one of the
students of this school who, as a
political refugee from Athens,
inlluenced and helped King Pto-
lemy I of Egypt to found the most
famous of all the libraries of
antiquity-that of Alexandria.
The Alexandrine library rapidly
became the centre of a continuing
Greek tradition, and is said to have
contained at one time 700, 000
volumes-a figure we need not
perhaps take too seriously. It is
indeed ironical that Julius Caesar,
who is himself credited with
planning the establishment of
public libraries in Rome, was
responsible for its partial des-
truction during the fighting in
Egypt in 47 B. C. In the declining
years of the Roman Empire all
Libraries in Roman territory, in-
cluding what remained of the
Alexandrine library, were closed bv
the Emperor Theodosius and their
contents destroyed or scattered.
Let us here leave the Western
world, at a point in history when
culture must indeed have seemed
to have disappeared for ever, and
look for a moment at the libraries
of China. An imperial library
existed at the time of the Chou
dynasty (1122-2W B. C.) ; but the
so-called"First Emperor", in 221
B. C., decreed that all books save
those on magic, medicine and
agriculture should be burnt, and
himself took charge of the'work
of censorship. Many treasures of
learning, including the work of
Confucius, were preserved only
through concealment, and it was a
hundred years before Hsiao Wu re-
established libraries and began to
collect and transcribe the surviving
masterpieces of Chinese literature.
During the Sung Yuan and l\1ing
dynasties (060-1C44) some of the
imperial libraries were opened to
students. Like the early libraries
of India, Japan and other Asiatic
countries, those of China are
especially noteworthy for their
magnificent collections of philos-
ophical, religious and literary
manuscripts, many of which are
even now only partially known to
Western scholars.
In the West, the gap left by the
complete cessation of all Greek and
Roman culture at the end of the
fourth century was gradually and
at first unobtrusively filled by a
rising power-the Christian
history. In the course
of military operations

the illuminated manuscript Bible,

We owe the monastic library to
St. Benedict, who in the sixth cen-
tury enjoined reading and study
upon his monks, and to monastic
libraries we owe many features of
library administration as we know
it to-day. The Carthusians and
Cistercians even had a system of
loans. Intellectual horizons began
again to widen, and contacts
between man and man to increase.

them to desks set in the bays, with
some kind of central corridor
giving access to all bays-an
arrangement still much used in
modern libraries, since it places
the maximum number of readers
close to the books they require and
at the same time affords a degree
of privacy and quiet.

of the fifteenth century, occurred

"SOME LIBRARIANS TRY HARD TO
BE GOOD CUSTODIANS OF BOOKS ;
A FEW UNFORTUNATELY SUCCEED"
(continued from previous Page)
met his death at Constantinople in
1453, when the city was captured.
The resulting migration of scho-
lars and students westwards
towards Rome recalls the migration
of a former generation of scholars
to Alexandria. But in this second
Renaissance there was a difference.
Within a year or two of the fall
of Constantinople, there was dis-
covered far off in the Rhineland the
art of printing, one of the most
revolutionary inventions of all
time. How, without printing and
the almost equally miraculous
discovery in Europe at about the
same time of the craft of paper-
making, already long known in
Asia, could the vast intellectual
potential of the European monas-
teries and universities and of
the migrating scholars from the
East have found expression and
achieved synthesis ? Even scribes
turned printers to cope with the
flood of work-the English
Caxton among them. And the
revival'of Greek and Roman
learning, with all the philosophical
and scientific advances which it
inspired, had a profound effect on
libraries.
The mediaeval arrangement of a
library in bays was now felt to be
insufficiently expressive of the
universality of knowledge, and
new libraries began to be built of
which the principal feature was a
large general reading hall with
book-cases round the walls and
readers'desks in the middle. The
first of these was the Royal Library
in the Escorial near Madrid, built
in 1584 ; it was the forerunner of
the reading rooms of the Vatican
in Rome, the Bibliothèque Natio-
nale in Paris, and, by a further
development, the great circular
rooms of the British Museum in
London and the Library of Con-
gress in Washington.
Some of these libraries, with
their high rooms, book-lined to the
cornice, are quite incredibly incon-
venient from the modern point of
view, and many have risked their
necks on wavering ladders only to
find the wanted book still just out
of reach-but they were of the
very spirit of the Renaissance :
classical and not Gothic, compre-
hensive and not divided into separ-
ate compartments. The only really
continuous thread connecting the
intellectual life of ancient Rome,
the mediaeval Church and the
Renaissance was, of course, the
Latin language.
For four centuries from the
Renaissance, libraries grew and
multiplied rapidly, and the great
libraries of the modern world
began to take their present shape.
Various forms of copyright law
ensured the growth of their collec-
tions, and if access to some was
restricted, they were in general
open to all students.
There was one more great
change still to come, and it was
that which was brought about by
the extension of education, with its
related demand for"recreational"
reading available for all. Author-
ities may still be trying to settle
whether England or the United
States of America possessed the
first modern public library ; what
is undeniably true is that the
public library movement began in
both countries about 1850, and has
been spreading to almost every
country in the world ever since.
The public library movement
was an old idea in a new form.
As we have seen, the library of
King Assurbanipal at Nineveh was
probably open to the public, and
there were certainly public librar-
To prevent theft, the old libraries used to chain the books to the cases. This

in 1575. It soon became one of the foremost universities of Europe.
ies in ancient Rome. A number
of town or communal libraries,
open to all who could read, arose
in various countries soon after the
Renaissance, while the contents
of many others were thrown open
to public use in consequence of the
great European revolutionary
movements of the late eighteenth
and early nineteenth centuries-
even though it frequently happen-
ed that no provision was subse-
quently made for their upkeep.
But the modern movement is
based on several new assumptions.
Firstly, the present-day public
library is in general supported
from national or local taxes spec-
ially set'-aside for its upkeep ;
secondly, it acts on the supposition
that all citizens of all ages, in all
walks of life, either can read or
are being taught to do so. From
this has followed a new conception
of the function of the librarian,
who is no longer a"keeper", res-
trictive in outlook and fearful of
losses, but a man actively concern-
ed to get the right book to the right
reader at the right time-a man
who takes delight in seeing his
shelves half-empty because he
knows his books are well and
frequently used.
As one librarian recently put it,
"Some librarians try hard to be
The Melbourne Public Library in Australia is regarded by experts as being in the highest world class. With more than
600, 000 books, it provides information on all subjects required by research students and business men. This picture of
the reading room was taken from one of the galleries on the fourth floor of the library. (Australian Official Photo.)
good custodians of books ; a few of
them unfortunately succeed."
Moreover, the librarian no longer
contents himself with supplying
what is asked for ; he now strives
to anticipate demands and even to
create them. Not only do books
go out for home reading from
libraries in the large towns ; there
are also rural libraries, libraries
carried by motor vehicle or on
horseback to remote villages or
sent by train or air in boxes ; there
are libraries in hospitals, schools
and prisons, there are libraries dis-
tributed by boat to seamen.
And with all this has come a
growing awareness of the essential
unity of librarianship. In many
countries the popular libraries have
stimulated a demand among their
own readers for books for study as
well as for recreation, and inter-
library loan systems have arisen to
make the best possible use of
available resources. In these sys-
tems the learned libraries too have
played a most important part, and
it is no uncommon thing for a
library van to call at a remote farm
bringing a book on veterinary
science, borrowed perhaps from
some university, for the farmer, a
book on some aspect of household
management for his wife, and
fiction, magazines or other reading
matter for both the grown-ups and
the children. The ideal inter-
library loan system would provide
any book on any subject for
anyone at any place and at any
time-and some systems are not
far from achieving this ideal.
As long ago as R77 Dr. Poole,
librarian of the Chicago Public
Library, said that he could see no
more valid reason for excluding
children from a library than from
a church. Forty years earlier,
indeed, a juvenile library had been
established at West Cambridge,
Massachusetts, but the children's
library movement really dates
from about 100, when children's
sections began to be considered as
normal as reference and loan col-
lections.
Some of the more modern
children's rooms, attractively decor-
ated and with small tables and
chairs, under the supervision of a
specially trained assistant, are
most inviting and have met with
well-deserved success. The un-
derlying value of the children's
library resides in the opportunities
it gives for early lessons in good
citizenship, care of public property
and independent thought and
judgment. The library becomes
part of each citizen's heritage fpom
childhood onwards.
The latest chapters in this long
history concern such developments
as film and gramophone record
libraries, and improvements in
library techniques. Even the use
of automatic machinery for library
purposes is being studied. But all
take their place within the main
framework of service to the com-
munity-a service which has now
become international, not merely
local or national, and is one of the
most potent forces for international
understanding in the world to-day.

MORE BOOKS FOR AFRICANS
ik T EXT month at the University College in Ibaden, Nigeria,a group of educators and libran : wins from all parts of
Africa will meet to chart a course in an experiment to
satisfy African demand that literates get a better chance to
find the books they need. The seminar, organized under the
auspices of Unesco, will focus discussions on getting more
public library services to African rural areas on a regional
or national scale... It will treat such questions as the
expansion of mobile library units for the"hinterland", the
use of films and other audio-visual techniques in mass
education campaigns, and the steps to be taken for the
professional training of a greater number of librarians.
The problems in British West Africa, discussed in the article
below, are typical of those in many parts of Africa, where
library development has followed a historic pattern-reading
rooms begun by private or semi-official bodies expand into a
library system and then become an accepted responsibility of
government.
f iBRARY service began in the four West African capitalsin the early 1940's, under the direction of British
Council representatives. European librarians were
appointed for the Gold Coast and Nigeria, and Africans
were trained to help them or replace them.
In ten years the service in the Gold Coast has come of
age and is independent of the Counril, despite all the ini-
tial difficulties : for example, the acute shortage of books
in the early years.
Certain things became clear quickly in the Gold Coast.
For one thing, the main difficulty for a targe and under-
developed area is the selection of books. There are insuf-
ficient books of the right type published. Although the
borrowers are adult and often require books on advanced
subjects, these must be simply written to be readily
understood. There are few books written in the West
African vernaculars, so English-a foreign language to
the majority of the population-has to be learned before
books can be readily used.
Books go to the people
ONE other fact became clear from the very beginning.Most of the Africans using the library services con-
centrated on reading for examinations. There was
very little reading for pleasure, and yet the library was not
designed solely to provide textbooks. This is being offset
by the provision of books for children who are being taught
the delight and pleasure to be found in literature.
Then again, there is a question of helping people to pick
books to read. This is not so difficult when the people
come to the library itself. The staff is always on hand to
help and advise.
But in the ninety-three thousand square miles of the
Gold Coast, this is not always the answer. There are two
other methods of bringing book and reader together. One
is the book box system where a box of some fifty books
is made available to schools, ('colleges, community and
social centres, and hospitals. Each box has a shelf inside
and when stood on end it can be used as a small book
case. Today, some ten thousand volumes are on issue
through this service.
The third approach is that of bringing the library to the
people when they cannot come to the library.
The motorised librarian
A TRAVELLING library was designed and put on the road.It consisted of a truck which contained shelves on the
outside so that when the van was opened up twenty
or more people could stand around choosing books.
The van holds about one thousand volumes and the
interior is used for carrying fuel and camp equipment. As
an added protection against rain, a hood-cloth Was fixed to
let down over the lockers.
The van enables a selection of the library's stock to be
sent around the country, and as often as possible the
librarian travels with it. In this'way, he is able \to advise
readers on their choice of books. This system has the
added advantage that the personal contact between the
librarian and the reading public makes the borrowers more
ready to ask for help. Advice and help are also given in
connection'with the building up of book stocks in school
libraries, methods of dealing with bookworm and simple
library practice.
The library also offers service to school teachers. Books
on teaching methods and allied subjects are provided gra-
tis and post free to bona fide teachers. This service was
made available when the library of the Education Depart-
ment was taken over. As often as possible, personal
contact is made with the teachers, and whenever the library
van is on trek schools are invited.
Plans are under way for building regional libraries in
various parts of the Gold Coast. As each of these is open-
ed, a library van will be attached to it. thus decentralizing
the book box scheme and making visits to the surrounding
districts more frequent. The Regional Library will be
begun by a European, but it is hoped that at the end of a
year one of the African staff will be able to take over.

THEY PUSHED OUT THE WALLS
Equipment in control room of radio station run by Louisville Library. Fourteen hours a day it offers good music, condensed versions of
books and plays, significant speeches and open forums and other programmes for the enjoyment and enlightenment of listeners.
A LOUISVILLE, Kentucky, housewife one daylast spring finished an afternoon's shop-
ping, then hurried into her city's astound-
ing Free Public Library. Inside the door she
dropped her bundles into a wire basket on
wheels, pushed it to the reservations desk, and
announced :"I want a framed picture for my
living room."
She was told that there were few to choose
from ; most of the 100 originals and fine repro-
ductions in the library's gallery were already
out on loan. But she did find a water colour
by a Kentucky artist, which she decided would
be just right for her « all. A librarian stamped
her card, and the picture was hers for a month
free.
Next she said she'd like to hear some Beet-
hoven. Through earphones she listened to pass-
ages from a dozen records, at last borrowed five
for a Week-also on her library card. At the
book desk she picked up a light novel and a
heavy volume on race relations-one of the
subjects most in demand in Louisville-then
hurried downstairs to a darkened room where
a score of other taxpayers were enjoying tele-
vision, another free library service. On her
way she put a nickel into a dispensing machine
for a soft drink which she sipped while she
rested her feet and watched the show.
Not for long, however. It was nearly five
o'clock and she had to get home. There at
home, along with thousands of other Louisville
citizens, she would tune her FM radio to Station
WFPL to hear the Chicago Round Table, fol-
lowed by a half hour of Mexican folk songs and
another thirty minutes of Brahms. This radio
station, a 250-watt transmitter, is run by the
library from studios in the basement of the
main library building.
THE public schools give a helping hand, too,and use it as one of the city's most versatile
educational tools. Fourteen hours a day it
broadcasts good music, significant speeches,
open forums, condensed versions of current
books and plays, and transcriptions of the best
network shows-each of the latter by special
permission from the networks-and it also
transmits hundreds of other programmes each
week over a citywide system of leased telephone
wires.
by Karl Detzer
These lines connect the library with all Louis-
ville's junior and senior high schools, such
parochial schools as want them, the municipal
university, the school for the blind, children's
wards in the hospitals, the city's psychopathic
ward, and all branch libraries. Each of the
thirty-five outlets can get any programme it
desires at any hour of the day merely by asking
for it. The library's collection of recordings,
although less than five years old, now numbers
thousands of records and wire-and tape-re-
cordings, including opera, folk songs, sympho-
nies, language lessons, poetry, Broadway plays,
aud transcriptions of network programmes.
Teachers need only call the library to bring
into their classrooms exciting radio programmes
on whatever subject their pupils are studying.
Sitting at their desks the youngsters explore
with Marco Polo, ride the Oregon Trail, gallop
with Paul Revere, hunt birds with Audubon, or
float down the Mississippi with Huckleberry
Finn. They hear masterpieces of prose and
poetry read by famous actors. They hear, too,
the actual voices of Jane Addams, Amelia
Earhart, Woodrow Wilson, Marconi, Edison,
and many others.
Schools, clubs, or just plain citizens may
borrow from their library's impressive collec-
tion of 550 motion-picture films. Last summer
a neighbourhood grocer who was worried about
idle youngsters on the streets borrowed a film
from the library, set up a screen and a sound-
box in the vacant lot beside his store. Each
evening fifty to one hundred and fifty children
sat on the ground, got excellent free movie fare,
stayed off the streets. And in three years 3, 000
adults were enrolled in the library's"neigh-
bourhood universities", with classes held four
evenings a week in four branch libraries. Pro-
fessors from the municipal university teach
subjects which range from music appreciation
to the natural sciences. Instruction is free
except for students working on college credits.
Of course the library also has books-half a
million of them. In two years their circulation
has risen 40 per cent, in spite of television,
from 1, 200. 000 to 1, 7fit, 000 a year. The"trans-
action cost"-the cost of lending a book, film,
picture, or recording-is slightly under ten
cents compared *with a national average of
twenty-five cents. Louisville has done this by
streamlining methods and introducing business-
like techniques. Cost of aJI the library's extra
services, including radio, all salaries, purchases
of films and records, and rental of leased wires,
was $4i, 541-about twelve cents for each of the
city's 386, 000 inhabitants.
if) EHiND the plan to take the library to thepeople who pay for it are two energetic 46-
year-old officials known to most of their
fellow citizens as Skip and Charlie. Skip is Pub-
lic Librarian Clarence Reginald Graham, who,
depending on his mood, can talk like a philo-
sophy professor, an evangelist, or an irate
teamster. Charlie is Mayor Charles F. Farns-
ley, a big, blond man equally at home in a
rough-and-tumble argument on garbage collec-
tions or a discussion of Chinese culture. Both
are native sons. It was Farnsley'who started
it all. Graham makes it tick.
The library has a checkered past. A group
of citizens more than seventy-five years ago
decided that the town needed a library that'was
free. They bought a collection of books, lent
them at no cost, and supported the project with
a lottery ; eventually they bought a big business
block in the middle of town'where the library
was housed until forty-five years ago. Then
Andrew Carnegie gave a building which the
institution still occupies, and the original quar-
ters were leased to a department store-the ren-
tals paying a large part of the annual expense.
The library still is not city-owned ; the board of
trustees, appointed by the mayor and city
council, holds the title as a non-profit corpora-
tion. About twenty-five years ago Louisville
built a bridge across the Ohio River, bonded
the city to pay for it by charging tolls. Under
a law passed at that time any money left over
in the toll fund after the honds were retired
could be spent by the mayor as he saw fit.
Farnsley happened to be mayor five years
ago when the last bond was paid-and he found
$ ;) 0, 00 left over. He had served on the libra-
ry's board of trustees, kne\v the institution's
need for cash. Many department heads at the
City Hall came forward with ideas about how
to use the money-to improve everything from
parks to parking lots. But Farnsley walked

into the office of startled Librarian Graham,
laid a cheque for $ : : >0, 000on the desk.
"Here's some money, Skip,"he said."Tear
down the walls. Take the library out to the
people."
It was not the first time in Farnsley's regime
that the library had broken with tradition. The
free library had been free only to white citi-
zens. After he became mayor Farnsley and the
board quickly agreed that the"White Only"
signs must come down. There were some
dissenting rumblings but now Negroes and
Whites use the library together in perfect
amity.
The radio transmitter itself costs Louisville
only $5, 000. The station is one of the World's
busiest, for in addition to the programmes that
go on the air as many as twelve may be going
out over the leased wires. Because the ope-
rating budget is small only a handful of
employees man the intricate network. There
are times when a single young operator-
announcer-engineer-a girl, at that-juggles
all twelve programmes running simultaneously.
But WFPL gives the people what they want,
whether it's a dissertation on flower culture, or
a symphony orchestra. The listener-owner is
assured of one thing. He can turn on his radio
without being assailed by jazz, by give-away
shows, by commercials. Over the leased wires
special music is piped twelve hours a day to
the city's psychopathic ward, music chosen by
the doctors for its soothing effect.
In the schools teachers build their classes
around the programmes. Thus,'when a history
class is probing the American Civil War the
teacher divides the time between textbooks and
radio. The youngsters hear a dramatization of
the life of John Bro'wn, which points up the
stresses that led to the war. They hear Henry
Fonda as"Young Mr. Lincoln"and Raymond
Supermarket carts are placed at convenience of library users for carrying books, gramophone records, maga-
zines, pamphlets and paintings. (Photos on this page copyright"Courier-Journal and Louisville Times".)
Massey as Sherwood's"Lincoln in Illinois".
Excitement mounts as the children hear the fir-
ing of the first gun at Fort Sumter, then the
battle between the tllonilor and the AI en'Ímac
described by professional radio announcers in
the present tense as if by actual observers.
Classes sit on the sidelines at Bull Run and
Appomatox. They hear the murmur of the
crowd as Lincoln talks at Gettysburg, are pre-
sent in Ford's Theatre on the dreadful night
when the shots rang out and the President
slumped in his box. They ride with the pur-
suers of assassin John Wilkes Booth, are in
on the capture.
No matter'what the topic-the coronation of
Charlemagne, the discovery of oil in Texas, or
a historic session at the United Nations-it's in
the library in dramatic form'waisting to live
again in any classroom that needs it. Sixteen
public school teachers form the"evaluation
committee"'which picks the recordings for
school use, prepares the printed material for
classroom use with the records-a summer-
long job. Department heads at the municipal
university serve as consultants. Local radio
stations give technical advice when needed.
TELEVISION in the libraries caused several ofLouisville's cultural eyebrows to lift
sharply. Statistics prove that in each
branch the advent of television stepped up
book borrowing. It's easy to stop at the desk
after watching a free show and pick up a book
to take home. When a local educator com-
plained about the cultural level of the average
television. programme Mayor Farnsley quickly
replied :"I'd rather the people came to their
corner branch libraries to watch the shows than
go to the corner saloons. Women can take
their kids and their knitting there, have a good
time-without having to buy a drink."
Farnsley backs Graham in his efforts to dis-
tribute the services of the library in ever-
widening circles, often prods him to step up the
process. It was he who talked the Art League
into turning over its fine collection to the library
for distribution to Louisville's living rooms.
Art dealers greeted the innovation coldly but
soon found that it paid off in dollars and
cents. When a citizen after living with a pic-
ture for a month decides that he'd like to live
with it always Librarian Graham puts him in
touch with a local dealer, arranges a pay-as-
you-go plan.
Mayor Farnsley recently walked into the
librarian's office, brandished his card, and
challenged,"Skip-try putting this thing into
your pallet ! See, it can't be done. Fits into
a woman's handbag-but don't you want men
to borrow books too ?" Graham quickly
agreed. Hereafter Louisville's library cards
will be convenient wallet size.
Thus in big and little innovations the librarian
and the mayor have"pushed out the walls"and
taken books, music, art, and education to the
people. Graham, who several years ago was
president of the American Library Association,
stated his credo in a message to that organiza-
tion."The librarian,"he said,"must not only
be a scholar and educator, he must be a shrewd
advertiser of his library's goods. He must buy
his materials, display them, and promote them
with all the skill of a salesman."
That may be heresy in some library quarters,
but in Louisville it's working out fine.

BLIOTECA INFANTIL :
A PARADISE FOR
SAO PAULO'S CHILDREN
by S. M. KOFFLER
VERY WEDNESDAY and Friday morning a special
bus, crowded with shouting children, rolls
through the heart of the skyscraper city of Sao
Paulo, Brazil, and heads for a little street-the
eneral Jardim-in one of the densely populated
rs'sections of town. At number 485 it pulls to a
efore an ultra ultra-modern two-storey building
by a beautifully laid out garden. From the bus,
, 0 blind children descend rapidly and impatiently
arch off into what has been called"0 Paraiso da
ndia"-Kiddies'Paradise.
lies'Paradise-or Biblioteca Infantil as it is
lly known-is no special institution just for the
it is the headquarters of one of the most
,-able movements in children's libraries created in
, indeed, in the whole of Latin America. The Sao
Biblioteca Infantil leads the way not only with
j conception of architecture but with its advanced
'methods and techniques, and the variety of
unities for development and expression it offers
i as well as blind children.
ay, over 35, 000 children registered in the main

IN MUNICH PINOCCHIO
AND B A B A R ARE
LANGUAGE TEACHERS
TODAY some of the oldest publiclibraries can look back on
more than a century of service
to the community. The children's
library movement, however, dates
back barely more than 50 years
when recognition of the many ser-
vices that a children's library can
offer was marked by the opening
of special children's corners in sev-
eral of the world's libraries.In this development the libraries
of the United States played an
important role, offering an example
for other countries to follow. In
1911, after a visit to the children's
room of the New York Public
Library, a distinguished Danish
author remarked :"I was prepared
for everything else I have seen in
America, but these children's libra-
ries are amazing. They surprise
and delight me... I should like to
spend a long time in this beautiful
room just reading in the company
of children. It is to become a
child again-a child with a new
freedom."
Today the idea is commonly
accepted and children's libraries
have become an. integral part of
the library system, their develop-
ment having gone hand in hand
with the rapid expansion of branch
libraries in the cities of many coun-
tries.
Many of the early ones were
inspired by the American example.
Thus, in 1911, after touring Ameri-
can libraries, Dr. Valfrid Palmgren
founded the Children's Library of
Stockholm, the first of its kind in
Europe.
In Paris and Brussels, children's
libraries under the name of
L'Heure Joyeuse were equipped by
Americans with assurance of main-
tenance by the municipalities. And
in London in 1920, a children's
library was created in the former
home of Charles Dickens. A staff
of boys and girls administered this
service under the direction of a
young American clergyman who
had discovered this"'Tiny Tim of a
House", and had seen in it a chil-
dren's library of unique possibili-
ties.
young in heart
SEPARATE buildings solely for theuse of children are, however,
still few even today. Of those
that do exist probably one of the
most unusual is the International
Youth Library in Munich, Germany,
which is dedicated to the task of
"furthering sincere understanding
among the young generations of
the world through children's and
youth books."
It might well use for its motto
the idea expressed by Jean Coc-
teau, who once said that all adults
must keep something of youth in
their hearts for only in this way
could they hope to understand
their own children. To this the
International Youth Library adds,
"And only if the children of the
world understand one another, can
we hope for a peaceful and undi-
vided world."
The idea of starting the Library
came from Mrs. Jella Lepmann,
who had organized an Inter-
national Youth Book Exhibition
in Germany in 1946-47.
Today, in the building on the
Kaulbachstrasse in Munich, which
was given and repaired by the Ba-
varian Government, there exists a
remarkable collection of the world's
"best youth books". Since 1949,
when the library was opened, this
collection has grown from 8, 000
volumes, coming from 23 countries,
to over 18, 000, representing the
gifts of publishers, official organi-
zations, libraries, schools and indi-
viduals in 35 countries.
What does such a library offer ?
In the first place it serves as a
point of contact for libraries,
schools and children in all parts of
the world, and not only for Ger-
man children and young people,
but also for German schools, li-
brarians, publishers and authors.
Within a year of its opening it
had already been visited by classes
from 40 different schools, and these
included not only Germans, but
Americans, English, French, Scan-
dinavians, Italians and the children
from displaced persons camps.
These refugee children were always
thrilled when they found books in
their native languages there.
Childrcn's paintings
BECAUSE of the accent laid onlanguage teaching in their
schools'curriculum, many
German children are able to read
books in English and French by
the age of 12 and 13. So the
Library organizes special study
groups with the books it posses-
ses... Winnie the Pooh, Ferdinand
the Bull, Pinocchio, Little Nils
Holgerson and the Elephant Babar
become the language teachers of
their nations. And, more impor-
tant still, the children are not
only learning the actual language,
but something about the mentality
of the different countries, about
their way of life and thought.
Another outstanding activity has
been the book discussion groups in
which boys and girls aged from 11
to 17 years take part regularly.
The guidance and evaluation of
these discussions are in the hands
of experienced librarians and other
specialists.
Children's paintings, which speak
an international language, are
another special feature of the
Library's work. The Library open-
ed with an International Exhibi-
tion showing the work of children
in 24 countries, which later toured
many German and other European
cities. Since then many schools
have held monthly exhibitions in
the Library, which has organized
an active children's painting group.
The Library is also doing in-
valuable work in developing a basic
international list of the world's
best books for children and young
people. In this connection it works
with publishers, writers, illustrators
and-most important of all-
with the educators of the new
generation. Specialists in all
these fields-a total of 250 people
from 9 countries,-met at the
Library in 1951 to discuss how
international understanding can be
aided by children's books.
Wo"'d pattcrn
WITH the help of scholarshipand exchange funds which
it is hoped will be estab-
lished by all library associations,
it can offer excellent exchange
possibilities. During 1951, for the
first time since its creation,
foreign guest librarians from
Sweden, England and Switzerland
did practical work in the Munich
Library. Their temporary co-ope-
ration helped it to supplement its
collection from their countries and
the visits enabled the librarians to
study the Library methods and to
consider how these could be applied
in the libraries of their own coun-
tries. This also highlights the
possibilities of using the Interna-
tional Youth Library to develop a
basic pattern for similar centres
throughout the world.
"Snow White and the Seven Dwarfs"played by youngsters at the
Children's Theatre annexed to the Sao Paulo Biblioteca Infantil.
The Story Hour comes twice a week. Well-known children's writers
as well as the library staff and the children take an active part.
Some remarkable results have been achieved by the children of Sao
Paulo in puppet making and in the production of puppet plays.

MORE CHILDREN'S V1/RITERS,
BETTER CHILDREN'S BOOKS
(Continued from page 9.)
"There is a vertical file with
pictures concerning-history, geo-
graphy, art and science, and also
coin and stamp collections. Books
in Braille for blind children are
provided too. Among the young-
sters one sees all kinds of races
and nationalities, Negroes, Mu-
lattoes, Japanese, Italian, English,
American ; German, French, etc.
The librarv therefore has on its
shelves not only books in Por-
tuguese, but also in French, Ger-
man, English and Spanish."
Root of Brazil's evils
THE central branch of theBiblioteca Infantil first opened
its doors in 1936 with a small
reference and lending section in a
small building. This has now
been replaced by the modern
two-storey structure offering all
facilities and the Children's Thea-
tre alongside it now stands on the
site of the old children's library.
With each book borrowed, a small
card is added on which children
are asked to answer four questions,
describing what they read, how
they liked the book, which char-
acter they liked most, and why.
This, says Dona Lenira, not only
helps the library to determine the
most popular books in a given
period and to gauge differences in
children's reading taste, but also
to sharpen the youngster's'interest
in what they are reading.
In a country like Brazil, where
literacy is a serious problem which
the government has been fighting
to overcome for years, Dona Lenira
sees the children's library as one
of the best ways of ultimately
solving the problem by interesting
the very young in the pleasures as
well as the benefits that come from
reading and general cultural devel-
opment.
Her work has been inspired by
a statement made by Monteiro
Lobato, the greatest writer of
children's books in Brazil, who
once said :"The day when every
city in Brazil'has its children's
library, Brazil will be safe from
all evil. For all the evils of Brazil
have one single cause : ignorance ;
the ignorance of adults who were
never inspired with a love of
reading when they were children."
Ever since she heard Monteiro
Lobato utter this phrase, Lenira
Fraccaroli has repeated it again and
again in her speeches and writings
to win local'and government
support for the children's library
movement.
Yellow Woodpecker Farm
LIKE many Brazilians, DonaLenira sees in Monteiro Lo-
bato the"Himalaya"of her
country's children's literature. His
stories of Little Pug Nose, Viscount
of Corncob, Emilia, the talking rag
doll, and Mammy Nastacia on
"Yellow Woodpecker Farm"have
delighted millions of Brazilian
children for many years. His
works would probably delight
many more millions in other
countries if they were trans-
lated into other languages. Un-
fortunately his name is almost
completely unknown abroad.
Despite this, Dona Fraccaroli
believes that the day will come
when Monteiro Lobato's"Wood-
pecker Farm"characters will
be known and loved by children
in every corner of the globe ant
that"he will rank as one of the
greatest authors of children's books
in the world."
Although Brazil can today boast
a number of other first-rate writers
of children's books, the need for
more good books in this field is
still great. This was well brought
out at a. Unesco seminar on the
development of public libraries in
Latin America held in Sao Paulo
in t951.
A section of this seminar, headed
by Lenira Fraccaroli, was devoted
to children's libraries. Surveying
the book production picture in all
the Latin American Republics, it
revealed that little was being done
in most of them. Brazil, Argentina
and Mexico lead in the publication
of children's books but a much
greater effort is still needed in all
the countries. The seminar called
for the co-operation of writers,
publishers, librarians, teachers,
illustrators and book trade organi-
zations"to increase and improve
the production of books and maga-
zines for children and adolescents."
Since then, Lenira Fraccaroli and
many of her colleagues in Rio de
Janeiro, Bahia, Pernambuco and
other parts of Brazil, have been
campaigning on a four-point plat-
form for more children's writers,
more children's books, more chil-
dren's libraries and more training
courses for children's librarians.
Last July, under the auspices of
the young editorial staff of the
Biblioteca Infantil's newspaper,
"A Voz da Infancia" (Youth's
Voice), Dona Lenira organized a
Congress of Children's Writers at
which some 20 authors-some of
them outstanding in their field-as
well as 150 adolescents from differ-
ent regions of Brazil attended. They
discussed ways to provide better
books for children, how to
eliminate pulp publications and
increase the circulation of better
books and magazines, and asked
for increased government and
local support for the establishment
of children's libraries in all of the
cities of Brazil.
A children's library in every city
of Brazil, however is probably still
a long long way on. But the Sao
Paulo Biblioteca Infantil is pointing
the way. In Bahia to the north, a
children's library"Monteiro Loba-
to"resembling the main branch on
the Rua General Jardim, was re-
cently inaugurated after a Bahian
librarian had spent two months
studying the Sao Paulo installations
and techniques. Other children's
libraries along similar lines are
also planned for the city.
In Rio de Janeiro, where until
recently a single room for children

in the history of art accompanied by reproductions of the great masters.
was attached to the existing public
libraries, the Chamber of Deputies
is now considering a proj ect for the
creation of 10 children's libraries in
separate buildings. The coffee
city of Santos is completing two
ultra-modern structures equipped
with open-air reading terraces, arts
and crafts facilities, a cinema and
a children's theatre. In these and
other cities special courses to train
library staff have been organized
and library courses are now plan-
ned as a regular part of all normal
schools as a means of stimulating
the creation of children's libraries
throughout Brazil.
All in all, it looks as if the Biblio-
teca Infantil of Sao Paulo has
reaìlv started something. With its
accent on combined libraries and
play centres where children have
found delight and inspiration
through access both to books and
creative activities, with its five
branch libraries and two children's
theatres already in operation, with
its 20 new children's libraries now
planned or under construction, the
Biblioteca Infantil of Sao Paulo
stands as a brilliant and inspiring
example for the rest of Brazil and
for other countries elsewhere in the
world.
in July 1952, the Children's Library of Sao Paulo convened a Congress. of Brazilian children's writers. Here young-
sters take part in a lively discussion on the need for more children's libraries and more writers of children's books.

is out
on loam
by A. J. Branston
AN ingenious uggestion by a libra-rian in Britain's Walthamstow
Pubic Library a few years ago has
given joy and inspiration to tens of
thousands of British music lovers, who
had hitherto been sharply restricted in
their choice of music.
The idea-that gramophone records
should be made available on free loan
from public libraries in the some way
that books are lent to borrowers-has
spread so rapidly that nearly all the
larger public libraries in Britain's cities
now have a record library.
The City Librarian at Westminster
Public library, in the heart of London
was one of the first to organize a record
library for his public. But neither he
nor his staff anticipated the result.
Opening in August 1948, within a week
every one of the 5, 000 records in the
new) y-acquired stock was"out on loan"
and newcomers had nothing from which
to make a selection.
So popular has the idea proved itself
that, today, Westminster has over 11, 000
records and some 4, 000 regular borrow-
ers, and both numbers are growing
larger week by week. On an average
100 peop) e a day visit the record
library, taking away with them as many
as six records each.
Providing they fulfil one of two special
conditions, anybody may borrow records
from these public record libraries. These
conditions are that the borrower must
either reside or work within the boundar-
ies of the borough concerned. Young
people (under 21) and residents who
are not rate-payers are usually asked
to obtain a guarantor's signature on
their membership-proposal card, but
some libraries dispense even with this
precaution.
Operation of the scheme proved to be
less expensive than had been feared.
Westminster Public Library puts its
expenses thus : cost of 5, 000 new records
f2, 000 ($5, 600) ; boxes and covers for
the records H5 ($210) ; annual cata-
logue (printed) abut £350 ($980) ;
annual replacements ; records f1, 650
($4, 620), boxes, covers and stationery
JE100 ($280). Though some additional
staff was required to help to run the
record library, no extra space was
needed.
For comparison purposes the expenses
of the record library at Lewisham (be-
lieved to be Britain's second longest)
may be given. The initial cost, including
additional furniture, 1, 000 records,
covers, stationery, etc., was abut £1, 000
($2, 800). An annual grant of f1, 000 is
made to cover replacements, new records
and so on. Except during rush periods,
only one person is needed to run the
record Library, doing all the clerical
work, renewing covers, indexing and cat-
aloguing new records and so on.
It is an obvious necessity, of course,
that borrowers hould take care of their
records and see that they are returned
undamaged. Some librarians foresaw a
great deal of carelessness with records
on loan. They expected to find that
returned records would be badly scratch-
ed, chipped or crocked, while some
borrowers, they thought, would either
keep the records or sell them !
Astonishingly, none of these things
happened except to a very minor degree.
Music lovers, it was found, almost in-
variably handle the records with loving
care.
Occasionally, of course, a record is
damaged, and the borrower is asked to
pay a fine according to the extent of
the damage. For a slight scratch or
chip, the fine is one shilling ($0. 14).
To some observers, this ever-increasing
demand for music by peoples of all
classes is all the more extraordinary
because it is all for classical music. No
joz- or swing, none of the latest.. hot"
numbers, or even what is commonly
known as.. right popular music", is
included. But all the major forms-
operas, ballet music, symphonies, concer-
tos, chamber music-are available.
young folk, to sit and listen to the
world's finest music-free.
Humanity's need for good music has

monthly recitals, using their own records.

opposition has been expressed against he
idea of music as a free public service.
THE BOOKMOB) LE
COMES TO TOWN
I WAS very lucky one year when Itaught in a rural school in Iowa.
Not far away was a town library,
and every two weeks I trudged back
and forth-with a big armload of
books for my pupils. The other six
years of my teaching in country
schools neither I nor my pupils were
so fortunate. No library was within
reach of horse and buggy or Model
T, and we had to be content with
the dog-eared, age-yellowed reading
material that youngsters had read
for several generations. It was
indeed a red-letter day when funds
from a money box social added new
books to the school"library".
That was twenty-odd years ago.
Memories of those days came back
poignantly tame nat lang agO'when
I took a one-day trip in a bookmobile
in Woodford County, Illinois.
I met the librarian-whom all
the children call the Bookmobile
Lady-and the driver at Metamora,
the headquarters of the Illinois
Prairie District Library. They told
me that the working book collection
of the district is more than 35, 000
volumes. In the bookmobile we had
4, 000 books from which youngsters
and adults could select reading for
one month.
This bookmobile visits twenty-one
schools, thirteen of which are one-
room schools. The teacher receives
a notice of a visit one week in
by Gladys Skelley
advance. Then the children start
their anxious wait for the day, which
they encircle in red on their big
schoolroom calendar.
As we journeyed over the country
roads to the six one-room schools
we were to visit on that first day of
bookmobile trips for the school
year, I learned how this library
district was established.
Teachers and principals, the local
banker, a former school-teacher, a
local clergyman, and farm folk in
the area saw the need for bringing
public-library service to Woodford
County.
Seven townships of the county
were vitally interested in the de-
monstration service that the Illinois
State library provided. They held
an election and formed the Illinois
Prairie District Library. The book-
mobile is on loan from the Illinois
State Library. Within a few years
the district will purchase its own
bookmobile, and build up its own
collection of library materials, sup-
plemented by State library material.
The district finances the library
by a maximum library tax of six
cents on every $ 100 of assessed
property valuation.
Five collections of books, besides
the one at Metamora, are maintain-
ed in the district. These branch
libraries have collections of different
sizes, depending on the number of
book borrowers in the community.
Before the formation of the district
library, there was only one small
library in the seventownship area.
It is now co-operating with the
district library.
Usually each pupil or adult
borrows six books a month. He is
responsible for their return. The
youngsters'books are placed on a
school bookshelf for use by all the
pupils.
That shelf of books holds a variety
of interests, too, as the year swings
into its seasons. In spring, it's bird
and flower books, SO the children can
identify the birds and flowers they
see on the way to school. During
the winter there are volumes on
games to play indoors, things to make
for parents for Christmas, or books
on plays and"pieces", to help out on
the school programme. Maybe it's
a book about how to identify the
different animal tracks for the
hunters in the group. The teacher
can be expected to ask for just about
anything which will help her in her
daily work.
The bookmobile librarian also
drives a jeep, which carries a
thousand books. Those she takes
to sections of three nearby counties.
They are serviced on contract by the
Illinois Prairie District Library.
After travelling in the bookmobile
for some miles, we came to our first
stop of the day. It was an honest-
to-goodness one-room, little red
schoolhouse. There was a royal
welcome there, for, besides the
youngsters who came bounding out
to the bookmobile when it rolled into
the yard, two mothers and their
small children were on hand for the
event.
The genial bookmobile driver
immediately took a new job. He
pulled down a table top from the
wall, got library cards in order, and
whirled his seat around. He was
now the clerk for those book-hungry
friends. He helped the youngsters,
some of whom could only print their
names, to fill in the library card
which held them responsible for the
books selected.
A busy woman was the Bookmobile
Lady. Animal stories seemed pop-
ular for all ages. The tiny folk,
with mouths open as they entered
the bookmobile for the first time,
asked their teacher or the Lady for
stories about dogs, kitties, or cow-
boys. They. had a hard time select-
ing books, for everything was so very
wonderful to them-so many
beautiful books in one little room !
The mothers, with tiny babies in
their arms, chose several books
about homemaking, cooking, and
sewing. They also asked the Lady's
advice on the newest books of
fiction. The eagerness with which
they took their books from the book-
mobile revealed that they were as
happy as the children because of the

THE REGULAR VISIT OF THE BOOKMOBILE IS AN EXCITING EVENT IN THE LIFE OF A TWO-ROOM COUNTRY SCHOOL. (Unesco photo)
"R EADING,"said the American writer andpublisher Bennett Cerf,"is like
eating peanuts : once you begin you tend to
go on and on."But many people are appar-
ently missing the rich rewards and
pleasures that come from a good bite into
tile'''peanut bag."
Recent statistics show that while practic-
ally every adult American listens to the
radio at least 15 minutes a day, and about
80 or 90 per cent read newspapers more or
less regularly, half the population of the
United States does not read even one book
a year. Less than 25 per cent read a book
a month.
With figures such as these before them,
a hundred or so librarians, teachers, writers,
puhlisherð, editors and booksellers came
together at a symposium in Washington,
D. C. in 1951, to talk about reading, and after
talking, to do something to encourage more
people to read. One of the important
things they did was inspire the publication
or. a volume, just published, entitled"Thewonderful world of Books."
Dedicated"to those who bend twigs-the
librarians of America, teachers, extension
workers, leaders-and to the twigs them-
selves,"the new book offers a delightfullv
varied and helpful guide to the joys and
benefits of reading."Books as Friends,"

bookmobile's visit to the neigh-
bourhood.
At the second school we visited
there were two circles around the
date for the bookmobile visit. It
was an extra-special event : the
schoolhouse is located on a road
that is almost impassable in winter.
Thus, the bookmobile makes only
two visits-in spring and fall. The
jeep delivers and collects
the books at other times.
The Oak Dell school
was our last stop for the
morning. Here we ate our
lunch on the school
grounds with the pupils
and their teacher.
Between bites of food,
they talked to their
teacher and the Lady and
driver about books they
could get on the next trip.
Before we left, the boys
got the driver to pitch in
their softball game.
At the first school in the
afternoon, a man was
waiting at the gate for us.
He was a busy farmer,
eager to borrow the new
books in the travelling
library. His enthusiasm
was as great as the
youngsters'.
"You got any books on
railroading or poetry I
haven't read ?"he asked
the Lady. They plunged
into animated conver-
sation on authors and
railroads and writing. She
had for him this time
Robert Frost's Collected
Poems and Cowboy songs
and Other Frontier Ballads
by John and Alan Lomax. Next
time she promised to bring Archie
Robertson's Slow Train to Yesterday.
"This is a wonderful thing-this
bookmobile,"he remarked to the
driver as he signed his card at the
desk. A quiet, serious man, he real-
izes (I gathered from my talk with
him) what treasures the bookmobile
is bringing to his daily living and
to the life of his community.
We stopped at a fourth school.
There sixteen excited children came
to the road to choose their books for
the month. Some of the girls asked
for"true stories,"which they like so
well-biographies of famous persons.
They also enjoy the new teen-age
romance stories, mysteries, and
"funny"stories, as do all the girls
'The Wonderful. World of Books'
on the bookmobile route. Boys
from fourth grade up enjoy sports,
mystery and cowboy stories and
science fiction.
Our last visit of the day was to
the largest school on the route. The
older children came out to the book-
mobile First. They selected their
books in orderly fashion. Then the
little folk came with their teacher
and hovered around her
in expectancy and wonder ;
a new, strange, wonderful
experience was unfolding
for them. As I watched
these children it struck me
with force ; you cannot
measure the value of the
bookmobile, in dollars and
cents, any more than you
can so measure the value
of a new scientific disco-
very, or a new system of
philosophy, or the life of
a good man and a good
woman. These good, new,
attractive, interesting
books that these little ones
were picking out for the
first time and these eager,
smart minds-they would
fuse, strike fire, open a
new vista, and bring deeper
ambition and awareness of
life and people.
How I wished my pupils
in my rural Iowa schools
could have had a book-
mobile-that all school-
children could have them !

LE PARISIEN L I K E S
TRAVEL BOOKS
LA PARISIENNE PREFERS
BIOGRAPHIES
LOOK in the guidebook to Paris
and and among the monuments
and public bui) dings you
will find listed the city's famous
libraries : celebrated names like
the Bibliothèque Nationale, the
Sainte-Geneviève, the Mazarine,
the Bibliothèque de l'Arsenal.
But these are not the libraries
of the people of Paris. They are
mostly reference libraries from
which books can only be borrowed
on rare occasions by specialists,
research workers and students.
The gas company employee and
the typist, the bank messenger
and the mechanic, the young
worker and his romantically
inclined sister, therefore, do not
go to these places to borrow
books. These people, the average
readers, never need to go any
further than the local librarv in
their arrondissement to find the
books thev need.
Despite appearances, no large
city is a single, massive entity of
people and buildings. To the
people who live there it often
becomes a nation whose provinces
are the neighbourhoods in which
they dwell. And though the city
has its illustrious institutions
these are not always as alive and
as close to the people as the more,
humble ones : the parish church,
the local cinema, the grocer's shop
on the corner. It is into this
category of accepted, familiar
institutions that the local branch
library fits.
A century ago people had to do
without them, for as late as the
year 1866 Paris possessed only one
municipal library. Then with the
development of compulsory pri-
mary education, the situation
began to change. By 1882, each
of the twenty Paris districts had
its library, and today the city has
a total of seventy-seven.
A family affair
THEY are modest places theseseventy-seven libraries. Gen-
erallv thev are housed in
the local town hall or in schools
where accommodation is limited
because of the need to make room
for an ever-increasing school
age population. So, because they
cannot accommodate many readers
within their premises, most of
them function primarily as
lending libraries.
Their share of the municipal
budget does not allow the
librarians to purchase all the
modern equipment they would
like to see installed, but has to be
uaed to meet the basic need of
book buying. Even so the budget
is now reaching encouraging pro-
portions, having risen from about
f22, 000 in 1950 to f40, 000 for the
current year.
What sort of books make up
the total collection of 769, 000
volumes on the shelves of the
Paris libraries' ? As might be
expected, a high proportion are
either French classical or modern
novels or translations of foreign
ones. But historical works make
up 21. 2% of the total and, not
counting works of fiction, books on
literature and philology represent
13. 3%. The remaining books are
devoted to geography, the fine
arts, the social sciences, philo-
sophy, religion and to musical
scores.
Last year, for example, 2, 929. 000
books were given out on loan and
more than 25, 000 new borrowers
were registered in the various
districts.
While the people of Paris who
use the libraries come from every
age group, it was especially noted
that the proportion of young
people who take out books is
becoming greater and greater.
Interesting, too, were the figures
recorded last year in terms of the
oecupations followed by library
users. Employees and officials
of various sorts made up 21 % of
the total : students, 17'% ; school-
children and apprentices, 14% ;
those with no occupation (chiefly
women), 13% ; workers and crafts-
men, 11. 5% ; primary and second-
ary school teachers, 6% ; profes-
sional people (lawyers, doctors,
engineers, etc.) 3 % ; tradesmen,
4. 7%.
A really important fact recorded
was that the majority of these
readers made regular visits to the
library and, on the average, read
between one and three books each
week. It was also noticed that
not only the card holder, but all
the members of a family made
use of the books that were
borrowed.
Best sellers
01TRAY, to what one mightexpect it is not always the
best selling novel that meets
the greatest popularity among
book borrowers. According to a
report recently published in the
"Official Municipal Bulletin of
the City of Paris", sixty per cent
of the people who take out novels
like to borrow at the same time
serious non-fiction on a subject
which particularly interests them
or on topical questions.
Choice, by the way, is not just
a haphazard affair. Many people
are strongly influenced by the
opinions of literary critics whose
articles they read in their daily
papers or magazines. Similarly
the radio and the cinema are also
having their effect. As soon as
a book, no matter what kind it
may be, has been made into a
film, it is immediately in great
demand.
Libraries have to exercise a
great variety of choice in their
book purchases so as to meet the
extremely diverse requests for
works of a general cultural
character. Men, for instance, are
attracted by books on travel, by
scientific and technical works and
those dealing with contemporary
history. Women show a predilec-
tion for plays, biographies and
poetry. Books on philosophy and
the social sciences are especially
popular with young people while
biographies and historical works
are sought after by elderly
persons.
A book a year
UNFORTUNATELY, say the libra-rians, echoed by education-
ists, neither the present
facilities offered by libraries nor
the use made of them is satis-
factory. Paris, a city of over
four million inhabitants, needs
more than seventy-seven libra-
ries. To be satisfied with the
present achievements would be to
admit that each Parisian only
needs to read one book each year.
There are, of course, many
people who buy books. But the
important point to remember is
that those who visit local libra-
ries are, in the main, people who
cannot afford to buy the books
they need. Therefore, the figure
which count-is the one which
shows the number of volumes
loaned by the municipal libraries
- three million ; three million
books which had it not been for
the libraries would not have been
made use of.
When library officials approach
the city authorities for funds to
expand the existing Parisian
libraries they might well use as a
justification the words of the
Fresh'h statesll1an who organized
the country's educational system.
"One may'do everything for the
primary school, for the secondary
school and for the university,"
said Jules Ferrv,.'but if, after all
this, there are no libraries,
nothing will have been achieved."
The narrow street, in the heart of Bombay, had no lighting, no sidewalks.
THE narrow street, deep in the
heart of the slums of Bombay,
had no lighting, no sidewalks,
and its dusty surface did not make
a comfortable resting-place. It was
far from one's conception of a
suitable classroom. Nevertheless, a
few yards from where our car
stopped, a class was in progress. By
the flickering light of kerosene
lamps, about twenty adults were
painfully learning to read and write
their own language. Each had a
small primer and a notebook in
which to write down the symbols the
teacher outlined on the blackboard,
and that about summed up the
equipment.
This class was typical of the many
organized by the Bombay Social
Education Department. Every night
at least a hundred such classes are
being held in the street, in unused
shops, in trade union halls, in
schools, in temple courtyards. It is
a principle that the class must be
held near where a group lives, and
that the accommodation must be
free, so that where none is available
the class is held in the street.
In a two-day tour, I saw many
facets of the work of the Bombay
Social Education Department-com-
munal radio sets and loudspeakers,
film vans for the showing of films on
health, hygiene, and similar subjects,
a superb display of gymnastics
presented by one of the athletic
clubs, but always the emphasis was
on the problem of overcoming
illiteracy.
My own personal interest was in
one particular aspect of the problem
- the provision of public libraries
and the use of books. As Unesco
Consultant to Delhi Public Library, I
had come to see what was being done
to help the illiterate use this new-
found knowledge and increase it by
practice. It is not difficult, given
the right methods, to teach an adult
to read and write. But what comes
after ? What facilities should there
be to enable him to progress further ?
The Bombay Committee was trying
to help by providing boxes of books
at Social Education Centres. But
book boxes are not libraries, and a
complete public library system for
Bombay appeared to be very far in
the future.
Later, I had the opportunity to see
something of the rural problem when
I was invited by the State of Madhya

THE ROAD TO THE LIBRARY
Bharat, in Central India, to tour the
province and report on the possibility
of an integrated public library ser-

of several Princely States, with a
population of over nine million
people, and an area of some 30, 000
square miles. It has three large
towns, Gwalior, Indore, Ujjain (one
of the holy cities of India), several
small ones, and innumerable villages.
Like all Indian States, it has many
problems. Roads, education, public
health services, agriculture, irrigation
- all need improvement, and that
Madhya Bharat should be thinking
of library services at all showed some
courage and vision. But someone
had realized that literacy and
libraries went together, and the
Rural Development Service had the
establishment of village libraries in
its programme. Sometimes it pro-
vides a box of books. Sometimes,
it supplements existing libraries.
A small beginning
WE saw one such library atBhitarwar, a typical enough
Indian village, more prosper-
ous than most perhaps, for it lies in
an irrigated area suited to sugar
cane, and it has a pleasant school, a
dispensary, and, accidently, some
claims to the picturesque. It lies on
a bend of a river, and on the far side
the ruins of a fort command the
plain from an outcrop of rock. India
is littered with such ruins. The forts
and tombs and temples decay, but
the villages remain. In a sacred pool
of the river by the Panchayat House
huge fish swim in contented im-
munity.
Greeted, garlanded, and refreshed
with sweet milky tea, nuts and fruit,
we entered the Panchayat House and
mounted a narrow stair. Here, in a
small room about 12 feet by 12, was
the village library. Some 500 books,
neatly classified, and very clean. I
made enquiries about use, and about
other books in the village. Of a
population of 1, 600 some 200 people
used the library from time to time.
One or two people had a few books
of their own. The schoolmaster had
several. Two or three people sub-
scribed to newspapers. There was
only one radio set in the village.
Here, in this small room was the
centre of culture in the village, it
was evident that the village council
was very proud of it. They had
founded it, levied a tax to pay for it,
and now it was to be enlarged as a
library for other villages in the area.
It was, of course, a very small
beginning. Bhitarwar is the centre
of a Kendra Panchayat, or rural
council, of about 100 square miles,
consisting of 70 villages and over
30, 000 people. Would the movement
thus started spread, or would it falter
for lack of funds, until the ideals
became a memory, and the clean
books a pile of tattered rubbish ?
Such daunting thoughts were
inspired by inspection of many
libraries in India, and by knowledge
of the previous history of the Public
Library movement.
"Gentlemen's club"
THERE have been Public Librar-ies in India for almost as long
as there has been Indian civil-
ization, and particularly in the 19th
and early 20th centuries. Public
Libraries were founded in most
Indian cities. But they were libraries
founded as memorials, or cultural
efforts by social service or charitable
foundations, and Western experience
has shown that the Public Library
can only flourish with sustained and
communal assistance-a basis of
taxation rather than subscription or
donation.
In India, the legislative basis has
always been lacking, and as a result
much effort has gone to waste. I
saw in India many libraries, good in
conception, inspired by high ideals,
that had become almost derelict
through lack of continuous support,
or were eking out a precarious
existence by subscription and do-
nation. In one large Indian city, a
most commodious building housed an
almost valueless collection of books,
and was used by a hundred or to
elderly gentlemen for its periodicals
and newspapers. It may have been
a quite'pleasant gentleman's club,
by Frank M. Gardner
but its original function as a public
library had disappeared.
In another city, two public libraries
existed within two hundred yards of
each other, one supported partially
by government grant, the other by a
social service group, with little or no
co-operation. In one of the largest
cities of India, a most beautiful
building bearing a famous name, has
become an almost derelict library
through lack of financial support.
Its shelves are crammed with 19th
century classics, with a number of
rarities, but classification and cata-
loguing are rudimentary, readers are
almost non-existent, and not only is
there no money for new books, but
the salary of the librarian is usually
in arrear.
The problem is not entirely a
financial one. In terms of use, it is
actually more expensive to maintain
a poor library than a good one. In-
variably, judging any library by the
rough and ready criterion of annual
cost per member, I found that the
cost was higher than similar cost in
England for a far superior service.
then progress has been continuous.
In two years, a complete modern
library service has been established,
with adult lending library, reading
rooms, children's library, and ex-
tension department for lectures,
discussions, and film shows. A
mobile library for outlying districts
is nearing completion, and with the
co-operation of the Ministry of
Rehabilitation, branches in the new
housing colonies for refugees are
being established. And to aid in the
conquest of illiteracy, small col-
lections in Social Education Centres
are maintained, and close con-
tact between the two departments
ensures that new-literates are pro-
perly introduced to the public library.
It has been a remarkable ex-
periment, and even more remarkable
has been the response of the public.
In the first year that the library has
been open, it has registered over
14, 000 members, loaned over 180, 000
books, and recorded 580, 000 atten-
dances. From the children's library
- one of the few actually lending
books to children for home reading
For practical reading-books on
engineering, radio, carpentry, re-
creations-it was impossible to gauge
the demand, because there were few
if any books available. The English
bookstock must remedy any deficien-
cies in technical books, any.. this was
deliberately limited at first, since the
library was intended primarily for
the ordinary reader. The Indian
Public Library has a double role-it
must not only provide books, it must
encourage their production.
Chester Bowles has said wisely
that India is not a poor country, it
is a country with many poor people.
In the pressing problem of de-
veloping Indian resources, where
does a Public Library fit in ? How
far is it worthwhile compared with
the demand of health, agriculture,
industrial production ? The most
obvious answer is that all progress
depends on a literate, socially
conscious community. New ideas
cannot be accepted unless un-
derstood, new techniques practised
unless learned.
The Delhi Public Library is a small
beginning, though it is on the way,
if allowed to develop, to providing an
adequate library service for the
To sit in a bus or tram one day and see a man in front, a very ordinary-looking fellow, pull a book from his pocket...
One is brought sharply to the
conclusion by this object lesson that
the public library can only fulfil its
function as an instrument of culture
and education if it is organized on
the basis of support from taxation,
free and unrestricted membership,
and access to the shelves. The
librarian of a library supported by
subscription looks on himself as a
custodian rather than an interpreter,
and comes to look on use as leading
to theft. Locked bookcases and
public libraries are a contradiction
in terms.
There is no lack of realization of
these facts in Indian librarianship.
A growing movement is agitating for
library legislation and modern
libraries, and is making progress.
To provide a focus for this growing
interest, the foundation of the Delhi
Public Library in 1951 as a de-
monstration project under the joint
auspices of Unesco and the Indian
Government was most opportune,
and its immediate and tremendous
success has shown that the con-
ception of the modern public library
is eagerly grasped by the Indian
public. The first director on behalf
of Unesco was Edward Sydney, well-
known for his work in furthering the
wider purposes of libraries, and he
did the foundation work on the
project. I acted as Unesco Con-
sultant from the opening of the
library to its firm and nourishing
state in the middle of 1952. Since
in India-200 books a day are issued,
and extension is only hampered by
the great difficulty in finding
suitable books in Hindi for children.
In the extension department, self-
governing groups sprang up with
very little nursing, covering theatre,
music, debating, music, Hindi litera-
ture, and a group for old people.
Lectures sponsored by the library
were always crowded, and film
shows had to be run in triplicate to
accommodate the crowds.
Accustomed to unresponsive lecture
audiences, I was surprised to see
large crowds for severely factual
talks on Indian affairs, and even
more to hear the knowledgeable
questions showered on the 1 : speaker
at the end. It was also pleasant to
see the readiness of eminent men to
come and talk to the public and the
immediate contact they made with
an audience. Democracy in India
may be new, but it is a vigorous, man
to man affair
The Delhi Library has emphasized
the existence of a very obvious need,
and it is well-used not only in
numbers but in quality. Most of the
stock is in Hindi, and much of it is
elementary and crude, but the
proportion of purely recreative read-
ing is no higher than in the West,
despite a generally lower educational
standard. For contemplative read-
ing, philosophy, religion, sociology,
the demand is much higher.
people of Delhi. But that was not
the object behind its foundation. To
succeed, it must act as a pilot for the
creation of similar services in other
parts of India, backed by legislation
and taxation. Beyond India lies
South-East Asia, with many countries
facing the same problems. The
Delhi Public Library can bring the
conception of Public Library service
in a practical way, as no text-book
ever could. Next year, when
Unesco's participation in the project
ends, assessment will be made of
what has been so far achieved, and
a seminar may be held attended by
librarians and educationists from
India and other countries. In
showing how a library should open
its doors and its shelves to all,
Unesco has started a whole series of
new ideas..

frustrations but many heart-warming

that here is a practical experiment
eagerly accepted and approved by
the people.

THEY SPENT THEIR SUMMER
VACATION IN A LIBRARY
The Municipal Library of Valognes, a small town in Normandy, was one
of many similar institutions which suffered damage through the war (total
library war losses in France have been estimated at more than S6, 000, 000).
Until three years ago it remained in the same condition in which a near miss
from a bomb had left it in 1944-floors and bookshelves covered with plaster
and rubble ; its books, many of them valuable medieval manuscripts and
incunabula, littering the floors.
Then, in April 1950, its sad state came to the notice of Unesco which issued
an appeal asking for a team of volunteers to come and work at Valognes to
save the library's valuable collection of books from further damage and
decay. Soon the Danish International Student Committee,.. Interstud",
offered to send a team of 35 Danish and Swedish student volunteers, and a
few weeks later this team, accompanied by two book-binders, arrived from
Copenhagen and set to work with a will. Some students repaired torn and
damaged volumes, cleaned those in good condition (photo above) and treated
the leather and parchment bindings with special soaps and preservatives.
Others scoured the emptied shelves, coated them with wax and made paper
covers for the books. The young Swedes and Danes spent their summer
vacations on this task and when they left Valognes, order and cleanliness
had been restored to one of the richest of France's small provincial libraries.
Their efforts brought to light many precious works dating from the 1400's
and 1500's. Similar efforts to help restore other war-damaged libraries in
France have also been made by students from Great Britain. Groups of them
came over and did valuable work in libraries at Dunkirk and Strasbourg.
