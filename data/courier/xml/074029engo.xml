THE LAST PRINCE OF POETS :
-
THE Courier ts happy to associate irselj with the world celebrationof the bicentenary of Goethe, who was born at Frankfort-on-Main
on August 28, 1749.
As its special tribute to the great German and European poet and
thinker, Unesco has asked men of letters OJ several countries to con-
tribute chapters, wr'tten for the occasion. to a volume entitled"Unesco's
Homage to Goethe on the. Second Centenary of his Birth", which will
be published on his birthday,
Limitat'ons oj space prevent the Courier from quoting from all of
these contributions, but extracts from some of therm are given in this
issue. Th ? memorial volume will be publ'shed simultaneously in English,
French and Spanish editions, each containing numerous illustrations.
We also prvzt on this page part of the letter in which Dr. Jaime
Torr, ? s Bodet. Director-General of Unesco, asked for contributions to
the memoria'volume, and an extract from the translation of the first
part of Goethe's Faust by the poet Shelley, which though only a frag-
ment is perhaps the finest rendering into English of any of Goethe's
world.
The portrait medallion of Goethe reproduced on this page was
executed by the French sculptor, David d'Angers, at Weimar in 1829.
On page 11 is a curious reproduction of a water-colour sketch made by
Goethe at the lirench frontier after the Battle of Val my, in 1792.
Ulleseo SalutesIJitcsc Satuts
HE world is celebratingthis year the bicentenary
of Goethe's birth. In such a
celebration, Unesco sees cogent
reasons for persevering in the
work of promotin under-
standing between cultures
which has been entrusted to
it. It is proud to salute
Goethe's memory and to re-
cognize in it an imperishable
testimony to what the human
mind can accomplish when its
desire for knowledge, that is
for analysis and awareness, is
combined with the power of
understanding, that is to say,
of harmonizing and reconcil-
ing. That, exactly, is the spirit
which animates Unescn
Unesco wishes to demon-
strate its profound respec :' for
a creative writer whose thirst
for knowledge remained un-
quenched until his death, and
whose whole existence was an
heroic effort to achieve that
inner balance, at the same time
noble and constructive, which
men and nations attain only
by vigilant insistence upon
clear thinking and by seeking
a culture that shall free them
from their prejudices. Accord-
ingly, Unesco has decided to
publish a volume in which a
number of distinguished think-
ers, artists and writers will pay
homage tao the author of Faust
and Wilhelm Meister.
Goethe was a great Euro-
pean. He was also a great uni-
versalist. He sought out extre-
mes, not in order to delight in
their opposition but to mea-
sure the distance between
them and, as often as he
could, to endeavour to span it
with his genius. He cared pas-
sionately for every form of
culture and his curiosity ex-
tended to every kind of scien-
tific investigation. His human
apprenticeship lasted l. ntiì he
was eighty. He never ceased to
feel strongly that the essence
of science and cultuie consists
in the fact that they are bene-
fits wh : ch exist only in so far
as they are transmitted. Hence
his determination to be an'
educator and hence his mar-
vellous fitness for the role.
- A REMINDER
"The General Confer-
enc instructs the Direc-
tour-General to negotiate
with Member States and
National Commissions in
order to develop plans for
wider circulation of the
"Courier" ; such plans
should include proposals
for facilitating the repro-
duction of the"Courier"
by Member States or
National Commissions,
either in the present
working languages or in
translations provided by
them."
Resolution adopted by
the General Conference of
Unesco at Beirut, Noventr
ber 1948.
if HERE is a very complete fusion in Goethe's own mind of his life as living experience andhis poetry as an expression of that experience. This idea is conveyed in the title he
gave to his autobiography, Dichtunu und Wahrheit. It is admirably summed up by
Eckermann in words which may seem today to confuse the role of public man with that 01
ooet striving towards a kind of public objecti vity.

BY
STEPHEN
SPENDER
HOEVER's task it may be to
We have charge of many ac-tivities. to judge, to lead, he
must also endeavour to gain as many
insights as possible into these many
tasks. Thus a prince and a rising states-
man can never make himself sufficiently
many-sided : many-sidedness appertains
to his craft.
"Likewise the poet must strive for a
multifold awareness. For the whole world
is his material, which he must hold urn-
der his hand and learn to create in
speech."
We must squarely confront ourselves
with the fact that Goethe was a poet
of the world. This is the fact above all
that puts him among those princes of,
poets. Dante and Shakespeare and Ra-,."'.'.,..,  :'cine. who used for their poetry
the material of the whole world
of their time. and which dis-tingu'shes him from the poets
 T E P H E N who followed him.A very wi e experience of what
it meant to rule, to be at the apex
of the learning of a cultivated
aristocratic class in Europe, was
the da : ly experience which flowed
through Goethe's mind and body ; and it was out of this
that he made his poetry.
Now it is scarcely too much to say that in his own time,
and ever since, people have hated Goethe for beir. g in tihs
position. The revolutionaries hate him because they consider
him counter-revolutionary : the democrats because they con-
sider him a snob ; the devout because they consider him
worldly ; the romanic because they consider him bourgeois ;
the sick because they consider him well ; the partial because
they consider him impartial ; the aesthetically minded"art-
for-art's-sakers". because they consider him a philistine.
It is doubtless the fault of society that no poet since
Goethe has been at the centre of the experience of his time
m the way that he was. But the impossibility of being like
him should not detract from our appreciation of his posi-
tion. Looked at in this way, Goethe was the last of the poets
into whose minds their whole time flowed : its power, its
knowledge, its faith. The tormenting struggle and anguish
by which an age orders men's lives and prepares the mind
of a whole generation of men to create and build and
believe and then pass on into death, seemed to stir in the
(works of these poets like motes of dust in a beam of light.
Since then we have had greater poetry than Goethe. But
it has expressed other, more peripheral attitudes : rebellious-
nests. sickness, renunciation, resignation, disgust, quietism,
nightmare, mystical belief.
Goethe's acceptance of the social forms ot his time went
beyond his being a nationalist or even a defender of the
aristocracy. He did not like the French revolution-but he
cared for the attempts to restore the monarchy still less.
He did not like the invasion of Germany by Napoleon, but
nevertheless he wrote no nationalist diatribes against it, and
he accepted the invitation to the famous meeting with
Napoleon.

PUBLIC EDUCATION CONFERENCE
The twelfth International Con-
ference on Public Education,
meeting at Genet'a from Jul"4
to July 12, considered reports by
the Ministries of Education on
developments in Public Educe-
tion during the school year 1948
to 1949 and gave special attention
'0 the introduction to lVntural
Science in the Primary School,
, he teaching of rending and the
teaching of geography as a means
of encouraging internatiønal un-
derstanding.
Prof. de BerreJo Carnf. ; rø. per-
manent delegate of Brail'0
Unesco, presided.
In an address 10 he Con-
ference, Dr. Jaime Torres Bodet,
Director-Generøl of Unesco, paid
in port :.
lr HE 19th century can boast of havingM abolished slavery by law, and the
20th century should devote its
efforts to the abolition of another form
of slavery-illiteracy. We are all aware of
the need for removing that fundamental
ignorance, but our task is not so much
to formulate our moral duty as to study
the various campaigns which have al-
ready been carried on in various parts
of the world, and so to develop definite,
practical and efficient methods which
will, so to speak, be the tactics to be
adopted in our struggle.
You savant the teaching of geography
- which should demonstrate the unity of
the world in its marvellous diversity-
tn be a more effective means of develop-
ing international understanding. We
have been told of some very interesting
experiments. Hitherto, you had drawn
mainly on history for instances of the
community of interests among men. You
were right. We must still emphasize that
point. We should sadly deceive ourselves
if we thought that present achievements
in this field were enough to Quieten all
anxiety. We shall not cease our efforts
to improve the teaching given and to
secure the revison of history textbooks,
which, for more or less nationalistic
reasons, often endanger, if not truth, at
least the spirit of international co-opera-
tion. While we shall not forget these
still unfinished tasks, we shall, at this
Twelfth Conference, pay special atten-
tion to the teaching of geography. Can : ot
we find in geography lessons, from the
study of climate to the d's ribution of
natural wealth, excellent opportunities
to awaken and develop in pupils an
appreciation of the interdependence of
humanity ?
I am glad to be able to tcll you that
Unesco, well aware of their importance,
is helping to arrange several internatio-
nal seminars. One of these, dealing with
the problem of illiteracy on the continent
of America, has been organized jointly
by the Brazilian Government, the Organ-
ization óf American States and Unesco ;
it will be held at Niteroi (Brazil) from
27 July to 2 September. Another semi-
nar nvill be held this year, with the as-
sistance of the Indian Government, i. far
Mysore, between 2 Novembr and 14 De-
ctmber ; this one will deal with adult
education in rural communities in Asia.
Preparations are already m hand for
two seminars to be held next year : one,
on the improvement of school textbooks
and in particular of history textbooks,
will be a sequel to a series of surveys
and recommendations begun some time
ago ; the other will deal with the teach-
ing of geography as a means of deveiop-
1n international understanding.
Natural Science
Another item on our agenda, the tenth-
ing of natural science in primary schools,
has been included because of the grow-
ing curiosity of teachers and pupils and
the requirements of the modern world.
We have to discover potential scientists,
and the development of teclmical pro-
cesses in both agriculture and industry
makes it necessary for the workers of
the future to be trained to understand
and overcome the difficult :. As of their
trade. We must be sure to instil not
only knowledge but respect for natural
resources, the waste of which paradoxi-
cally makes the very increase of popula-
tion a menace. Such teaching will illus-
trate the old maxim that"we can com-
snand nature only when we obey her".
In the space of less than tilirty years,
the world has been torn by two great
wars which, in the number of deaths
and the precision of the means of des-
truction used, have surpassed all men's
effort 3n past centuries to slay and de-
base one another. Everything which man
had come to took upon as the triumph
of civilization-the it. ost marvellous dis-
MEETS AT GENEVA
eoveries in engineering and chemistry,
'she utmost refinements of dialectic and
eloquence-all these things became sus-
pect to him when they combined to foster
hatred, evil and negation instead of
glorifying life.
We had been taught to revere in-
telligence, and intelligence sometimes
proved a dread enemy. Whe had
learned to respect science, and science
was converted into a weapon of
aggression. What did this tragic spec-
tacle signify ? The failure of spiritual
values, a sharp reversal of all that'pro-
gress had achieved ? No, most certainly
not. Philosophy, Science and art can
none of them be held guilty of the abuses
to which they were put by those respon-
sible for the vast holocaust in which the
whole civilization of our time so nearly
perisher. ;
Liberation not Complete
t) T is not of intelligence that We mustM beware but of its secret adversary,
intelligence without a moral sense. In
1933 a European th : nker, questioned
about the future of civilization, replied'
"The process of liberation (begun in
the 16th century) reached completion
with the French Revolution and the
establishment of the democratic polit. ical
regime. Humanity had for centuries
something to do : to break free from its
mediaeval bonds. We have now reached
the end of this stage of development, and
civilization does not qu : te know what to
do. It needs some great task to carry
out".
We have a supreme duty-to help, as
teachers, to organize a society in which
every man will be able to shake hands,
in brotherly trust and friendship, with
his kinsman from Europe or Asia, with
the b ; ack man from Africa and the red
man from America, All races, all peoples,
all national aspirations must have scope
for expression in th : s post-war world. If
a single voice were to be silent, if a
single right were to be trodden under
foot, humanity would have shed its blood
in vain in those great battles, The pe-
riod of crisis through which we are pass-
ing will never find a solution in an
arbitrary distinction between victors and
vanquished. A peace founded solely upon
an improvised balance of power could be,
at best. only an uncertain truce.
Life is a Problem \.
"vat we need then, in education,
\'Y are teachers who are men first
and foremost, and not mere store-
houses of educational formulae. We be-
Eeve that educating man does not mean
merely imparting the essentials of tra-
dition and culture. It means instiJIing
an effective confidence in his original
and creative power ; it means providing
him, from early childhood, with teaching
"You need the teaching of Geography..."
in which he may recognize life for what
it is : a problem, a constant process of
discovery, a perpetual seeking of private
and communal responsibilities. Then,
overwhelmed as it were, bv the mounting
wealth of knowledge in the world, he
will convert it into a personal capacity
for renewal, which will endure as long
as I : fe itself.
Human personality does not find fulfil-
ment in the triumph of individualism.
Freedom is only an instrument for a
richer development of man, for which
he must be a member of a community ;
and that membership itself is worthy of
man only if it is freely chosen. The se-
cond paragraph of Article 25 of the
Universal Declaration of Human Rights
expresses that synthesis of the individual
and the community which the true right
t't education helps to promote :"Educa-
t'on shall be directed to the full develop--
ment of human personality and to the
strenl/ ; thening of respect for human rights
and fundamental freedoms. It shall pro-
mote understanding, tolerance and friend-
ship among all nations, racial or reli-
gious groups, and sha1l further the activ-
sties of the United Nations for the main-
tenance of peace". This brings to my
mind the noble motto which I once saw
inscribed on the pediment of the Town
Hall of LuEano : libertas in leg : bus,
liberty in law.
The Soul of the People
UCH liberty within a community canonly be fully exercised, as Article 27
goes on to say, by participation in
the Cultural. artistic and scientific life 0f
the group :"Everyone has the right freely
to participate in the cultural life of the
community, to enjoy the arts and to
share in scientific advancement and its
benefit". There must be no esoteric
culture, the monopoly of a favoured few
The strength and the very survival of a
culture depend upon its being rooted in
the soul of the people,
Unesco is so fwe) I aware that freedom
should increase concurrently with the
sense of civic obligations, and that the
simultaneous development of both should
be the aim of education, that the Organ-
ization's Code of Directives, which has
been drawn up to guide the preparation
of its practical programme, and which
was approved last month bv the Execu-
tive Board, stipulates that :"In Education.
Unesco will act as a centre for the ex-
change and dissemination of ideas and
practices, in order to entourage the
growth of effective systems of education,
seeking spec : ally to bring people to un-
derstand one another, to train good
citizens and to give every person, rich
or poor, in town or country, without dis-
tbction of colour, race, sex, or creed,
the opportunity for an education which
best assures him the possibility to develop
his personality and carry out his social
responsibilities".
Without doubt the two most difficult
things for humanity to learn are the
art of ruling men and the art of educat-
instead of feeling himself outstripped,
ing them. For my part, I am inclined
to bet'eve that if we had mastered the
second, the difficulties of the first would
be appreciably reduced. We must not
forget that when we are training men
we are building the city of the future.
We who are educationist, and those we
have to guide, must all be the architect
of that society in which, if we have well
fuJfllled our task, human rights and
human liberties will flourish.
Prof. CARNEIRO
President
of Education Conference
Professor Paulo de Berrdo Carnei-
ro, member of the Unesco Executive
Board and Permanent Delegate of
Brazil to Unesco, was elected President
of the Public Education Conference
for the current year at the opening
of the 12th Annual Session on July 4.
Professor Carneiro has reprsented
the Government of Brazil at many
international conferences, notably
those of the I. L. O., the Institute cil
Intellectual Co-operation and the
United Nations (first part of the
General Assembly in London, 1946). He
was Brazilian Delegate of I. BE.} n
1948 and has been appointed as de-
legate to the 1949 meeting.
Professor Carneiro has) long ben
associated with the work of Unesco.
He was a delegate to the Conference
in London in 1945, where the Constitu-
tion of Unesco was drawn up ; he was
concerned with the work of the Pre-
paratory Commission during 1946, and
was a delegate to the First, Second
and Third Sessions of the Unesco
General Conference in Paris, Mexico
and Beirut. At the Paris Conference
he was elected for a three-year term
to the Executive Board of Unesco.
On Ju) y 23, when visiting Athens,
Prof. Carniro handed to M. Tatsos,
the Greek Minister of Education, a
cheque for 10, 850 dollars sent by
Unesco"as a symbolic gift"to the
Greek schools which had suffered
most damage from the War. The pres-
entation was mad in the conference
hall of the University of Athens in
the presence of the University Senate,
the Ministers of Education and of the
Press, delegates from women's organ-
izations and other official representa-
tives.

August 1949 UNESCO COURIER 3
FILM STAR WITH UNESCAN
A model set for" ; Uurda in the Cathedral", by T. S. Eliot.
I. T. I. CONGRESS MEETS
"The Theatre is a living force...
,,
THE theatre is a form of inter-nation l co-operat'on which
has existed for centuries. Plays
by Shakespeare tour the rural
regions of India ; the French
classics are staged in Rio de
Janeiro ; an American comedy is
adapted for Czechoslovakian au-
diences... and these are only a
few of the hundreds of examples
of our times.
The theatre is a living force for
international cultural exchange,
which merely means giving the
peop : e of one country a chance
to learn how others I've and
think. The world wants to see
the theatrical works of all na-
tions, but then the question
arises :"How to help the move-
ment of plays and actors from
one part of the world to the
other?"
This question was foremost in
the minds of theatre people from
all parts of the world who came
to Zurich. Switzer : and, I a s t
month, for the Second Congress
of the Internationa. l Theatre Ins-
t'tute (IT I) which has estao-
lished 19 national centres. s'nce it
was set up in Pra'gue. just over a
year ago.
International Tours
The Congress was opened in
Zurich's City Hail, the historic
"RathaMS", by Mr. Llewellyn Rees,
head of the British delegat : own,
and held its business sessions in
the Zurich Museum of Modern
Art.. 4/ter considertng the pro-
blems raised bey customs and en-
tertainmeñt ta. res, transport costs
and visa regulat'ons. the Congress
approved a number of"model"
c. auses concerning international
tours of theatrical companies, in-
tended for eventual incorporation
in international cultural agree-
ments.
These cla2cses cover the promo-
t'on of theatrical tours, exemption
. from entertainment taxes on non-
commercial tours, the provision
of simplified customs regulations
and the granting of reduced
transport rates on international
tors,
In addit"on, the ITI delegates
urged all countries to set up na-
tional theatre organbations on
the lines of Great Britain's Arts
Council and France's Action
Artistique.
The development of nat'onal
theatre organizations and the
granting of the facilities covered
by the model cla. uses will help to
make the theatre a still greater
force for international co-opera-
tion and will ensure a constant
transfus'on of ideas from one
country to another.
International Theatre Week
How to"mobilize"the theatrein the campaign to spread
understanding of the Universal
Declaration oj Human Rights was
another major question discussed
by the Congress.
M. Jaime Torres Bodet, Di-
rector-General of Unesco. recalled,
in a message to the Congress,
that the United State ITI Cen-
tre had already suggested hold-
ing an international theatre week
devoted to the themes of human
rights and world peace.
It M) ou d not indeed be hard to
find among all the plays of the
world, masterpieces on the eter-
nal subject of the liberation of
man and, to use Tolstoy's words,
his victory over the', powers of
darkness', said M. Torres Bodet.
"From Sophocles to Goethe and
Schiller, from Aristophanes to
Molière, from Shakespeare to
Ibsen-zchat great dramat'c poet
is there who has not immortalized
humanity's struggle against des-
potism, into : erance, injustice,
ignorance and year ? Such works
have lost nothing of their 1) rtue,
and appeal to the imagination
of the masses as powerfully as
they ever did.
"But ice can do more than this.
We can appeal to the creative
genius of the dramat'sts of to-
day. Do not the Universal De-
claration of Human Rights and
the principles and deeds that it
implies provide authors, producers
and actors with an inexhaust'ð'ze
source oj inspiration ?
"There is no questions. of
course", M. Torres Bodet con-
tinued,"of imposing subjects or
reviving the'propaganda'pay.
But such an appeal1aunched by
you would show that the con-
temporary theatre had a how
and compelling conception of the
part it could play in the life of
nations and on behalf of inter-
national understanding."
Following M. Torres Bodet's ap-
peal, the Congress adopted the
idea of an International Theatre
Week to be he : d dur : ng 1950.
Theatres in every country will be
aslced to devote this week to the
themes of world peace and the
Universal Declaration of Human
Right.
U. N. U. T. O.
MANY contemporary dramatistshave alr ady embodied these
two themes it their works. Last
year, for example, J, B, Priestley,
the End. fish author and playwright,
created an imaginary organiza-
tion,"The United Nations Under-
developed Territories Organiza-
tion (UNUTO)"in h's play"Home
is Tomorrow". To-day, this p : ay
takes our a new and topical in-
terest as the United Nations
draws up a plan to assist the urn-
deer-developed areas of the world.
One way in which the ITI tries
to break down the national bar-
riers of the theatre world is by
making know the latest develop-
ments in theatre design, stage
technique and production me-
thods in all countries. Because of
war damage, suffered by many
theatres, information on construc-
t on is especially important today.
To enable the de : egates to
follow the trend or theatre archi-
tecture in various countries, lead-
ins architects reported to the
Congress on developments in
France. Poland, Sweden, Switzer-
land and the United States.
Theatre Architecture
Recognising the importance of
theatre reconstruction problems,
the Congress decided to calm an
international conference on thea-
tre architecture and stage techni-
ques next year, in conjunction
with the Th : rd ITI Congress. An-
mother. plan for 1950 provides funds
for eight theatre fel : owships, to
enable young theatre artists pro-
posed by ITI National Centres to
study or be trained abroad.
THE Congress also decided toreduce the scope of its pre-
sent monthly publication, the
ITI Bullet'n, which has provided
a forum for countries to make
known their current theatr : cal
productions and activities. In
future its coverage will be res-
tricted to the world premiers of
, p : ays. opera and ballet. General
theatre activities 10 11 be dealt
with in a new publication, a hall-
yearly World Review of the
Theatre.
Amateur Theatres
In order to associate amateur
theatre movements more closely
with the work of the ITI, the
Congress recommended that Na-
tional Centres should have ama-
teur theatre representation and
that one representaLve should be
included in each Congress de : e-
nation,
During the Congress, Mr. Mau-
rice Kurtz, the author and play-
wright, who has been General
Secretary of the ITI since its
foundation, succeeded in this
post by M. André Josset, the
French playwright.
Although it is only just over a
year told. the ITI has already
made great progress towards the
achievement of its broad objec-
tives, Mr. J. B, Priestley, one of
its founders, summed these up in
the early days oj the Institute
when he said :"A well-written
rp : ay may do more than fifty
speeches by well meaning polit :-
clans. A world in which an Inter-
national Theatre Institute is se-
curely estabtished is a far sater
and mOTe civil'zed world than
one in which the art of drama is
imprisoned between high na-
tional barriers".
OUTLOOK VISITS THE COURIER
mm MY MY
f'AN any good thing come
'--"out of Hollyu ; ood ? Can any
good t h i 11 g come out
or Unesco ? To both of tlzese ques-
tions, which the public at large
may ask itself sometimes without
being too sure of ! e answers,
Myrna Loy, who paid a visit to
the Courier office the other day,
returns an emphat'c Yes.
Miss L0 was among the
earl east devotees in the United
States of the Unescan ideal 0/
i n t ern a t i onal understanding
through education, science ant
cu ; ture. (She was, incidentaltv,
one of the earZ : est regular sub-
scribers to the Courier, her sub-
scriber's card being No. 87.) She
represented the Motion Picture
Industry at the Pacific Regional
Conference art San Francisco'171
1948. She is a member or the
Count'1 for Unesco of South Ca-
lifornia and is Chairman of its
Committee to explore ! problems of
education by films, All of which
indicates that Miss LOll has her
own op'nions in these matters
and that her or neons are worth
listening to. Miss LOll speakino :
I think maybe a lot of people
don't realize how hard the motion
pict, pre industry is trying to im-
prove itself culturally, just as they
don't realize what Unesco is doing
and how much the ideals it stands
for mean to everybody, all over
the world. People-especially in
Europe-see gangster films and
knockabout comedy and thinK
that's all that Hollywood can do.
But Hollywood does a lot bzsides
that. and it's trying to do mare
all the time.
In films as in newspapers, there's
a tendency to play up crime and
sensation, death and destruction,
just because those are the things
easiest to make excitin without
making any special effort of in-
telligence. From that it's an easy
step to the idea that cheap sensa-
tion is"what the public wants".
Really there's no reason to think
that the public prefers bad enter-
tair : ment. It prefers the entertain-
ment that moves, stimulates, or
amuses it most. But it often has
to be content with second-ratf
stuff because the firstaate stuff
needs the very best writers to turn
it out and the very best actors
and producers to make it effec-
tive
We know that in Hollywood ann
we know that constructive ideas
can be made dramatic, but we
know also that before we can edu-
cate the public we must educatP
ourselves. When I think of edu-
cation I don't mean just book-
learning ; I mean learning to va-
lue the best interests of humanity
and the big constructive ideas
that will secure them. That's why
I personally and many other
people in Hollywood-many more
than most people think, perhaps
- believe that the work of Unesco
and the ideals it serves are so im-
portant for all of us today.
It's not very easy to make that
work and those ideals seem real
and concrete to ordinary, busy
people, and it is very easy for
them to get the idea that people
who work for the United Nations,
Unesco and other organizations
I. ke them are a bunch of un-
practical dreamers with their
heads in the clouds. It's always
easy for the"hard-headed"-or
thick-headed ?-citizen to poke fun
at the idealist. What he does'6
realize is that there's no essential
contradiction between the ideal
and the practical. The ideal thing
is the best thing possible, and the
most) practical thinz in the lon
run.
I think there's no doubt that all
worth-while work in films oc any
other medium means the expres-
sion of ideas, and that at Holly-
wood, just like any other place
where people work together, the
new idea leads the way. Hollywood
instructs through the medium of
entertainment, and Unesco can
entertain while ir. structing. It
must do so if the education it
tcies to promote is to be accepted
readily and retained in people's
minds.
There's no limit to what the
films can do for people if they x"
about it the right way, just as
there's no limit to the interest
and excitement of education if it's
made to be alive, not dead. Films
can make war on prejudices-sev-
eral recent films on the negro pro-
blem have done just that. All
drama is conflict. Some of the
most exciting films represent con-
Tentative model of Frank Lloyd Wright's"New Theatre", the first

flicts of ideas rather than fights
between gangsters. The first are
just as excising as the'second,
and more so when their quality
is first-class, as it ought to be.
There's no reason why the lives
of good men shouldn't be as excit-
ing and as good entertainment as
the lives of bad ones. A good film
on the life of Gandhi or Saint
Francis would be just as enthrall-
ing and would appeal to a much
wider audience than a film on
the life of Al Capone.
Films can solve personal pro-
blems, too, or help people to solve
them foe themselves, without los-
ing anything in entertainment
value. Or. e of my own films,"The
Best Years of our Lives", certain-
ly helped a lot of people that way.
After it appeared a woman said
to me :"I wish I could have seen
that film a year ago. Then I
shouldn't have divorced my hus-
band".
So you see, we in Hollywood
have just the same problems as
you here in Paris. We're both
handling human material and
trying to do our best with it and
for it. It's our mission to make
people happier by opening and
broadening their minds just as it's
yours to fight against ignorance
and to teach co-operation.
The m : ssion of women ? Why, to
civilize men, of course ! We want
healthy babies, not bloody battles.
At least we have to practise hus-
band-tolerance, and we think it's
time men learnt to practise the
same tolerance among themselves.

UNESCO COURIER Augml ] 9"1-9
"We rely on Unesco but we
know that Unesco, with it limited
means. gives preference to those
who show that they can help
themselves, so we have decided
to show what we can do with the
limited means at our disposal, and
we have agreed on a programme
of international exchange of
youngsters.
"Next summer, boys and girls
from Finnish, Danish, Dutch,
French and Swiss science clubs
will visit each other and make
personal contacts with the friends
across the borders with whom,
thanks to Unesco, they have al-
ready begun to correspond."
It was a young Dutchman,
22-year old Kees Meijers who,
after the meeting of Science Club
leaders, made these remarks,
without any flourishes and even
with a certain shyness, when he
came to say good-bye to his
host-s at Unesco.

Unesco, ever since its founda-
tion, has been making efforts to
improve international copyright
relations throughout the world.
One. of its ma'n tasks has been
to carry out a comparative study
of copyright throughout the world
so as to brMfy OMt MS'M :/ ! ca7 ! t !as to bring out significant
similarities and differences in na-
tional copyright lawns.
When the surrey was sufficient-
ly advanced last month Unesco
called a meeting of experts on
copyright to study the resuits and
to suggest the best means of

were stressed by Dr. Jaime Torres
Bode, Director-General of
Unesco, in a message to the com-
Mtttee.
"The world's need, and our de-
sire", said Dr. Torres Bodet,"is
that thought with all its power to
promote peace and well-doing,
shall regain its right.
"It is in that l'ght, and not in
terms of a narrow legalism, that !
Unesco regards copyright. Wheat I
we seek is some means whereby
thought, too, may recover free-
oom of action, without which it
can have no true blossoming."
On the suggest'on of Mr, B, G.
Crewe, Board of Trade, London,
the ej-perts/ormaHy recommena-
ed the drawing up of a new
Universal Convention on Copy-
right based on the principle that
each country must grant to for-
eign authors the same protection
it grants to its own cit'zens.
Universality being the primarj/
pool, the experts also adopted the
suggestion of M. V. de Sanctis, of
Rose. that the Convention
should contain any other mini-
mum standards of protection
tc which all countries are pre-
flared to agree.
Work"were opened by the Direc-
tor-General of Unesco, who said :
Though a discovery is not the
more meritorious for beinll made
by a young inventor, we cannot
help a special feeling of admira-
tion at the thought that before
the age off 30, Joseph Black was
carrying out his famous investiga-
tions into carbon diox'de, Einstein
was formulating hits theory of re-
lativity, Dirac was revolutionizing
the mechanism of quanta, W. H.
Perkin tOO.' ! producing tM first

of the American Science Talent
Search was only 15 and he
had already discovered a very
important method of synthes-
izing certain organic compounds.
All these examtples may fire the
imagination of young people and
draw them into your clubs.
Gentlemen, yours is the rare
pr ivilege of disseminating, hu-
manizing and advancing the
cause of science. It enables you to
help train men who will be not
mere scientists, but citizens with
deeper insight intro the possibili-
ties and dangers of the world
toddy. Whether they make a name
for themselves through far-famed
discoveries or merely perform a
humble yet necessary task, the
members of your clubs wili have
this in common : they will
together have fought against

You know, gentlemen, that Une.' :-
co is ready to assist you in a mis-
sion where our purposes and
yours are the same.
Spirit of the Young
People Backing Unesco
During the meeting, delegates
from nine countries heard how
youthful scientists are working,
from Korea to Copenhagen, from
Prague to Paraguay. They heard
about the young cave explorers.
the speleologists of France, about
the young astronomers of Brazil,
the young agriculturalists-ttie
4-H'ers-of the U. S. A.. and
many other groups.
They discussed how the"prize'
questions''of the Finnish science
clubs, the"annual talent search"
conducted by the Science Clubs
of America, and the"Science
Fairs"arranged by clubs in Den-
mark and elsewhere, could be
duplicated. They passed on to
Unesco a set of recommendations, !
the most important of which asks
for a revision of the whole quss- !
tion of sc : ence in education..
Another recommendation deal-
ing with the movement originally
started by the young Dutchman,

as follows :

Science Club Leaders recom-
mends that Unesco approach at)
societies and associations for the
protection of nature and retard
organizations, and draw then
attention to the successful at-
tempts in forming special Nature
Protection Clubs for young peoples
which have been made in Hot-
land and Sweden and which
could probably be started wheres
er Associations and Societies tor
the Protection of Nature exist
In so doing, it should be stressrd
that the Meeting consider It of
paramount importanee for the
future work In connection with
nature protection and the wise
utilization of resources that the
interest of youth in these
matters of vital importance be
aroused as quickly as possible.
This recommendation should
be brought to the notice of the
International Technical Confer-
ence on the Protection of Nature
and the United Nations Scientific
Conference on the Conservation
and Utilization of Resources I
(UNSCCUR),
As soon as It was adopted, Kees
Meijers rushed out of the con-
ference room. On his return, he
explained :"I sent an airmail
letter to the Dutch Minister of
Education to be quite sure that
a Dutch delegation would o to

rence".
To this remark : one of the
visitors at the conference said :
"As long as the work and the
ideals of Unesco are backed by
the spirit and enthusiasm of peo-

Unesco is wen off."
EDUCATION
AND NATURAL
RESOURCES
By DAVID SCOTT
It is now fairly common know-
ledge that while world popu1a-
tion increases and world food
population tends rather to de-
cline, only a small part of the
world's potential food resources
are actually being used. The pro-
portion of the world's surface
which could be made to produce
food is about 30 per cent. At the
present time, only 10 per cent is
under cultivation. If even the
whole 30 per cent could be
brought into production, without
any tapping of fresh resources or
reclamation of land now unfit
for agriculture, the world food
shortage that threatens us could
be staved off for many years-
always provided that the food
was fairly distributed.
Not only have men failed until
nOiW to make full use of the
available soil for food produc-
tion ; they have actually des-
troyed the productivity of large
areas by wasteful or short-
sighted agricultural m et h o d s
and they are still wasting a
quite unnecessary proportion of
the resources that remain. Worst
of all, it its in the areas where
production is least abundant and
where the people who depend on
it can least afford to be careless
in this respect, that waste is most
rampant, because up-to-date
equipment is most lacking and
ignorance is most profound.
A Vicious Circle
Thus a vioious circle is set up
and conditions worsen most
rapidly in the very places where
improvement is most needed.
Gradually the poorer areas en-
croach upon those which are
most favoured by nature, and
their populations come to depend
more and more on supplies ob-
t\.'ned from their more fortunate
neighbours, with the result that,
if these conditions are not reme-
died, there will be eventually no
"rich"areas left in the world at
all.
The world's cultivated zones
vary enol'mo\Jsly in productivity,
but they can be divided roughly
into two categories :"technically
advanced"areas, where favoura-
ble conditions have produced a
reasonable degree of prosperity
for their urban and their rural
inhabitants, and''problem''areas,
where the masses live on the
verge of 5starvation. Western Eu-
rope and North America may be
taken as examples of advanced
areas ; India, China, and the
greater part of Africa and South
America as examples of problem
areas. Unfortunately the problem
areas account for most of the
habitable globe. In these igno-
race is the curse and funda. men-
tal education is the cure. It may
have to begin by combating
illiteracy ; in any case it has to
be established at the lowest social
level and at the earlie6t possible
age, since the best hope lies in a
ne. w generation, emancipated
from the ewors and limitations of
the past..'II.
City versus Country
Even in advanced areas, how-
ever, education has its part to
play. Here the commonest probl-
em is that of the urban population,
which lives on the products of
the land but knows little and
cares less about the mea. ns by
which they are produced. Cities
, are among the greatest wasters
of natural resources, from the
ba.'i. Îc foOdstuffs to such necks-
sities as fuel and water. They
also tend to destroy the produc-
tivity of surrounding agricultural
areas by polluting streams, by
dumping waste on cultivated
land, by poisoning the air with
factory smoke and petrol fumes
and simply by spreading outwards
as their populations grow. Here,
also, education is called for, but
it need not be applied, as in the
problem areas, at the elementary
level. It must be devised to train
technicians and to enlighten
adults, rather than to implant
elementary knowledge in virgin
minds.
Whatever the local conditions
and the intellectual level of the
peop'e, any programme for train-
ing in the use and conservat : on
of natural resources must depend
on three elements : research,
legistalive and administrative
action and, finally educa-
tion. Research into local con-
ditions and requirements-the
state and composition of the soil,
the most suitable crops, the best
methods of cultivation for a
particular area, the need of'
drainage or irrigation, land clear-
ance or afforestation, fertilizers
or pest destroyers, and so on-is
necessary before legislation can
be planned. But legislation and
administrative action alone will
be ineffective unless they are ac-
companied by education, which
alone will produce lasting
resulth. The whole populat : on
must be induced to cooperate in
the programme and have master-
ed the basic facts on which it
rests. Experience has shown that
attempts to implant naw techni-
cal methods and ways of living
among primitive populations
without fundamental education : s
their basis are fore-doomed to
failure. In one colonial area, for
instance, after considerable ef-
forts in this field, the authori-
ties reported before the war that
"the native population showed
little interest and progress was
slight".
This is not to be wonder-
ed at if the case of another
colony in the same part of the
world was typical. Here, accord-
ing to an independent survey
made in 1937, the troops of the
European garrison (who were the
only executive agents on the
spot) were ordered to see that
the natives adopted more up-to-
date methods of agriculture. But
the troops themselves were given
no preliminary training in such
matters, and they had no idea
how to set about their duties
with the natural result that the
programme got nowhere. This was
a perfect example of how not to do
it : the blind led the blind, and
both fell into the ditch.

THE CHOICE FOR MAN : A GOOD
LIFE OR AN UNHAPPY DEA TH
time and time
again, through the
activities of press and
radio, a life is savcd
through a newly-report-
ed treatment, a novel
industry or process is
introduced in a new
location, or an old
idea is shown to have
a new application.
IN fact, the under-standing of science
by the people is much
more than the practice
of devotion to truth
or the satisfaction
of intellectual curiosity
and thirst for knowledge.
It is the difference between a good
life and an unhappy death-often for
individual men, women and children,
and, in all probability, for the modern
world and civilization itself.
In the three decades subsequent to
the first World War, great discoveries
have become part of daily life. We are
often, however, to forget the part
that simple explanations of great ideas
have played in moulding the physical
world and the way we think.
Influence of, ;
Einstein-
Einstein's theory of relativity and the
strange ideas of quantum theory have
trickled dramatically into the philosophy
of living, aIthougtJ. the circle of mathe-
matical physicists Is still a small one.
Healthiness as contrasted to illness of
mind-the positive side Of psychiatry-
has received an impetus from those who
brought sanity to the treatment of
insanity and the unshackling of sex by
Freud.
Mechanf. cal and electrical wonders
have been developed-airptanes, automo-
biles. diesels, radio, television, and a
dozen other specialities that after a few
months become so much a !) art of our
mores that we forget how young they
are. We forget that when new-and
therefore strange-these commonp ! aces of
today needed explanation that would
make them plausible.
Diabetes, pneumonia, the venereal
diseases. and a host of other ills with'n
the space of a few years have been
deprived of their ability to sign death
warrants or cause broken lives. No
physician in the early days of our new
era of science understanding would have
dared to hope that a single drug would
by
Watson DAVIS
conquer two-score diseases. Yet the sulfa
drugs and the antibiotics-penicillin.
streptomycin, chloromyctin, aureomycin
- do make these deadly diseases less
troublesome than the common cold.
To the food of the world and the farms
of the earth, new aids and supplements
have come-nitrogen from the air, che-
mical insecticides, better management of
the soil, frozen foods, etc. Vitamins have
been discovered and so have protein
quality and the need of seven classes
of food which will build better minds
and bodies of a better-fed population.
The my-fed third of the world have
at least been recognized. The spotlight
of publicity is playing on the weak and
hungry. Starvation, partial or complete,
is not condoned with hopelessness.
The means of reaching the millions
- the daily newspaper, the popu : ar ma-
gazine, the voices of the radio, the film.
the books of fact and fiction, the
measured cadences of information circu-
lating through official channels, and the
blaring insistence of advertising-all of
these are closing the gap between dis-
covery and application.
Often the public hears through the
press about a new medical discovery and
about the availability of a new drug
before the average doctor has a chance
to study his medical journal.
importance of
Science-W riter
The science writer is often a catalyser
as well as a reporter. When th* fission of
uranium, bas'c to atomic energy, was
discovered in Germany, in 1939. Science
Service, the American non-profit orga-
nization for the Popularization of
Science, called the scientific report to
the attention of scientists : and also told
the public through the press about its
significance, including the vital fact that
an atomic bomb was probable, as energy
for industry could be extraetl'd from the
atomic nucleus-and an uncontrolled
chain reaction would not get started and
wipe out the world.
Insulin for diabetes, livr for anaemia,
sulfanimide tor child-birth fever, strep-
tomycin for tuberculosis-these were
great life-saving stories when they were
new. They are a continuing opportunity
to explain the possibilities of modern
medicine to the people.
Great Stories.
to Come
What has been is only the beginning.
There are great stories of scientific dis-
covery and application in the making.
If such things happen.. it will be
because the people continu to support the
advance of science, spiritually and finan-
ciauy, a. nd the talented have a chance
to do research. We must be confident
that the people will do this if they are
allowed to know the facts and implica-
tions of the most thrilling area of human
advance-modern science-
THE MAYOR
who changed
his mind
This is the story of the mayor of a
small South American town who was
forced to change his mind by his
feilow-citizens.
To this mayor went a letter from
the Department of Health asking if
he had money available for spraying
houses with DDT.
He replied : no funds available.
Two days later, followed an urgent
cable. It said that money had been
obtained, and asked when the spray-
ing could begin.
What had happened was that the
local inhab : tants had lea. rned of the
mayor reply. They had disagreed
violently, because popular science
articles had informed them of the
benefits of DDT.
A meeting of the town council was
summoned hurriedly, and the mayor
was persuaded to change his mind.
THE same exhibition,which was later
shown in the capital
of a province, 400 kilo-
metres distant, was
visited by half the
local population.
'M7 HE T does thismean ? That the
masses want to know
what is happening.
To inform them is a
tremendous task.
The Latin American
people have a more
or less develpped ge-
neral culture, but
there is an insufficient
"dose"of science. This
insufficiency of scien-
tific culture applies to all classes, even in
the most advanced centres. The inevitable
accompaniments of this are the poverty
of native science, the scarcity of
scientists, the lack of encouragement for
research, limited credits, a certain gene-
ral indifference, and resistance on the
part of the lower classes to the changes
which the new developments impose on
modern life.
But, clearly, the blame cannot be
placed on the shoulders of the people.
Government and political leaders often
speak of social problems, which they
study and try to solve ; usually scientific
principles are completely absent from
their investigations.
In universities, scientific activity takes
second place : instruction in the main
is for professional training. During the
past few years, there has been some
progress, but each step forward Is the
result of a struggle amon university
directors or in parliament.
Scientific work continues to be the
result of isolated, individual effort
accompanied by sacrifices and often by
some heroism.
This disregard for scientific activity
exists generally. The professional man
who devotes himself to research instead
of practising his profession, is he'd to
be a failure. Donations from rich people
for scientific research are the exception
in Latin America.
The objective, scientific education
given to young people leaves much to
be desired. It should be added that in
speaking of science, what is usually
meant is the science of observation and
not of experiment and research.
Finally, when science is considerered at
all, it is spoken of as something harmful.
But there is a favourable side. The
lack of tradition allows of Quick changes
in public opinion, Generally, people
are willing to absorb information if it
is presented in an acceptable way. There
is widespread curiosity, for example,
about new techniques.
There is. I believe, a great need for
scientific information, but necessarily, it
must come in large part from abroad.
Unesco has a tremendous favourable field
in which to work on the popularization
of science.

..
Lord Boyd-Orr He) ped To
Make An A1 Nation
SCIENCE correspondents, like all jour-nalists, are interested in scoops-the
new discoverv or development which
"makes the headline". But this is an
account of a"scoop"which took four
patient years to achieve.
IN 1932, I was doing a series of sc : en-- *-tific articles on what was happening
in British laboratories, and, without
much enthusiasm, visited the Rowett
Research Institute, Aberdeen, to discuss
animal nutrition-"menus for pogs", as
I irreverently called it.
NOR was the Director very enthusiasticabout my visit. Indeed, his attitude
made me curious and over a reluctant
cup of coffee I remarked,"Dr, Boyd Orr,
you seem to be a man with a chip on
your shoulder". And discovering that he
had a sympathetic listener, he told me
what that"chip"was..
IMPORTANCE OF
NUTRITION
zit can persuade farmers to take an in-terest in nutrition,"he said,"because I
can prove to them that it pays dividends
in terms of their stocks and herds. But I
cannot get them interested in the nutri-
tion of their own children, let alone the
children of other people. Yet I can prove
as a. scientist and as a doctor that
that would pay incomparably gaeater
dividends'"
Science Through Film

Science Offices in China, Egypt and
Uruguay with news on scientific and
popular scientific films. It has pro-
cured films for China, Denmark and
several Latin American countries. It

He told me of his rankling frustration.
He had fed 200 children, of underpaid
miners in Lanarkshire, on milk for a
year. He had a control group of similar
children, who did not receive supple-
mentary diet.
The contrast between the two groups
conclusively proved his argument. The
milk-fed children"blossomed before his
eyes". But in the depression years, when
the lesson was even more important, the
scientific surveY had been"lost". Dr.
John Boyd Orr was an unhappy man,
Why couldn't be get the public to listen ?
As I told him, that was my job. The
immediate article on"The AI Nation of
Tomorrow"put his argument before two

awakened popular interest in nutrition,

In 1935. I"got my scoop". Dr. Boyd Orr
announced his results at the British
Association. As his confidant I acquired
journalistic merit by the fullv informed
account, with all the significance that
others missed, and with social repercus-
sions which are still reverberating.
A MAY-NOURISHED
. POPULATION
THE"Food, Health and Income"survey.- scientifically documented, showed
that in Britain half the people did not
then have incomes which would gua-
rantee them the diet necessary for
health and well being, and that one-
tenth of the population was definitely
under-nourished.
The impact on Britain was immediate.
Committees Against Malnutrition sup-
ported by eminent scientists and public
figures began a drive which had political
effect. The international outcome was
the Mixed Commission of the League of
Nations, which"married"health and
agriculture, and in : tiated in Member
States a series of similar survey.
That in the United States of America,
the richest country in the world, paral-
leled Orr's results. Elsewhere the evi-
dence was even more disturbing.
In Britain, this investigation and the
popular interest it created prepared the
"climate"for the painless and specta-
cularly successful rationing system which
brought Britain out of six years of war
a healthier nation than when it had
entered it.
RESULTS FINALLY
SEEN
THEN international results were seenin the Hot Springs Conference and in
the foundation of the Food and Agri-
culture Organization of U. N. at Quebec,
where Sir John Boyd Orr was elected
the first Director-General.
When, at the Famine Conference in
Washington, Sir John Boyd Orr made
his final speech which roused the weary
delegates to enthusiasm and acclamation,
Sir John asked me what I thought of
his speech. My reply was,"I have liked
it better every time I have heard it for
the last fourteen years".
With that remarkable constancy which
has made Lord Bovd Orr a world
scientist-statesman, he was saying in
that vital assembly (which delivered
70. 000, 00 people from the threat of
privation), with more-facts but DO more
emphasis, what he had said to me at
the Rowett Institute when I arrived in
quest of"menus for pigs".
'I Am Grateful
To Scientific
4 Boswells'
To more than the art of printing, how-
ever, do we owe the successes and
pleasures of our vicario14$ adventures in
science. We are also greatly indebted
to those who can write and will write
in terms of our limited comprehension.
Not all the scientists have the facility.
Sometimes the talk is too tough for us,
or too curt, They have not the time to
be lucid on our level and within our vo-
Jabulary, or perhaps their mental inten-
sity has stunted the faculty of sym-
pathetic explanation.
When such technical barriers exclude
from the scientific workshop, it is then
we like to consult with a clear-spoken
and understanding interpreter.
We sit on the back porch of the labora-
tory, while he, as middleman, Eoes inside
to the obscurities and mysteries, to re-
turn occasionally with comprehensible
reports. In listening to him we hear not
only his voice, but the overtones of the
master he interprets.
I like these men of understanding who
play Boawell to the specialist. They
often have a gift greater than that of
the concentrated workers whom they
soften up for us.
For they have breadth and perspective,
which help us to get at the essence of a
problem more objectively than we could
even if we were fully equipped with the
language and knowledge of the fact-
bent explorer and analyst.
The scientific interpreters frequently
enhance our enjoyment in that they give
us of themselves, as well as of the dis-
coverers whose exploits they recount. We
are always grateful to them, moreover,
for having spared us labor and possibly
discouragement.

There are now more leading men oj
science capable of presenting their e-

than ever there were ; as is evidenced by
B. B. C."feature broadcasts"from time
to time. On account of the expansion of
science teaching in schools and colleges
and the everyday USe of products of
a. pplied science, many more peaple have
their minds directed to the implication,
technical and social, of scientific know-
ledge. There are plenty of expositors of
science capable of constructing stories of
informative value to the general public
in readable language, but few opportu-
nities are available for the ! publication
of such articles in the general Press.
The"Sunday Times"has recently in-

The Role Of
Cheap Books
IN planning to use books to spreadinformation about Science we have to
think realistically, quantitatively, in de-
tail-
What sorts of people, and how many
of them, are reading books on science
now ? Does the price of a book in actual
fact stop some from reading it ?
What is our aim in spreading scientific
enlightenment ? A statement of our
ideals indicates for whom our cheap
books must be written, and what book-
lists we should develop as publishers.
. bY
J. L. CRAMMER
Editor of pengu'n Science News
Finally, why do books cost so much ?
The answer to this may help us to pro-
duce them more cheaply,
I am going to discuss these questions
in turn. using British experience.
The first group of questions is unfor-
tunately difficult to answer because very
little research has been done on reading
habits, and little is known about the
sort of people who buv books and why
they buy them. But something of the
situation can be gathered by collecting
a few statistics from publishers and
comparing their sales with the size of
the population (see Tab ! e I).
Fven from the few figures of this
table one or two conclusions are indicat-
ed. Firstly, price is not in itself a deter-
mining factor : the book with a record
sale is the most expensive of the three,
while the medium-priced one sold more
than a cheaper book by the same author
(Sir Arthur Eddington) until the latter
was published by Penguins. Most scion-
tific Penguin books sell editions of
50. 0M to 100. 000 copies, so it did well.
The instruments for the
Popularization of Science are
many. They include the Asso-
ciations for the Advancement
of Science, Sc : enc Clubs, the
science writer, radio, the films,
the museum, the mobile exhi-
bits, the book, television, and
the comic strip.
The Section for the Populari-
zation of Sc'ence is concerned
with fostering their develop-
ment, and where necessary,
initiating their growth.
Only a few exampls of how
these instruments can be used
are mentioned in these pages.
More can be teamed about
them by writing to Unesco. Do
not hesitate to do so.
Secondly, it looks as though we are
doing we) ! if 1 in 500 of our population
buys a book. Is this good enough ?
Another way of trying to gauge pubEc
interest in Science is to study what
kinds of books are borrowed from free
Public Lending Libraries. Table 2 gives
a few figures for a city I happen to
know Quite well, one which is industrial,
with a University Cohere, a technical
school, and many ordinarv schools.
The issue of science books actually
includes a certain number of textbooks
borrowed by students for their academic
work. But, ilmoring this. we see that
under conditions where the books are
free. only 5, 6 0/0 of those taken for
reading are on science, and the number
of these could be accounted for entirely
if the educated groups separately listed
in the table drew five books each in the
year.
Or take it on a national scale. If a
Penguin book of a medical interest sells
50, 000 copies, how do we know that it
has not been entirely bought up by the
doctors of the country, just to see what
it is like ? If this is really what happens
the effectiveness of our popularization
leaves something to be desired.
So we come to the question who are
these popular books for, who are the
people we want to reach ? Insofar as a

tainly brinj ? : this high standard of using.
To do so, in an undeveloped country,
more than a few scientists are needed.
The political leaders must be aware of
what science can dO for their country,
and there must also be a nucleus of
trained technicians to work the factory
processes and the new agriculture.

SOME years ago a small countryentered into a contract with
a foreign oil company, selling the
right to utilize all minerals that
might òe found in its under--
aground.
Nobody protested and the com-
pany started work ; but when in-
dications of the presence of oil
were found. the government was
, everely attacked.
It was stated that native scion-
tists long ago had predicted the
presence of valuab : e minerals,
such as soil,
Why, it was asked, had the gov-
ernment not paid attention to
them and thus kept the minerals
for itself. that is to sax. for the
citizens of the country ?
From the debate which followed
it appeared that some of the
persons responsible for the bar-
gain had heard about the seismo-
log."cal,. gravimetric and magnetic
investigations upon which the
scientists had based their views
but none had reallll understood
what it was all about.
None of them, as they frank ; y
admitted, understood the lan-
gunge of the scientists. the way
in which they expressed them-
lIelDes.
Public opinion required a scape-
gnat, It was found by a journaLst,
who wrote an article saying :
"I am the scale. pegoat in this
a/fair, and so are you ! In a demo-
cratic society like ours we are all
responsible for the slips made by
our representatives in n Parf ament.
We could have stopped them but
did not do so. Let us watch them
more closely in the future. Let us
learn more about science !"
Government officials time and
again need a knowledge of
science to make intelligent dec :-
sions. If the decisions are wrong,
not only are the government offi-
cials to blame, but àlso the voters
backing them.
As the language of science to-
day is made u. p of symbols and
dialects that are us'intelligible to
the public (and sometimes even
to those specialists working in
adjacent fie : dsJ. a new profession
has been created : journalists who
are s. pecialists in interpreting the
language of the scientists, the
science writers.
The need for such specialists
was clearly felt in the country
mentioned above when the"oil
affair"came WP. But too many
countries are still waiting for
such an"affair"to hit them.
UNESCO must make knownto the greatest possible
number of people, not only the
scientific achievements and
their applications, but the
trend of Scientific progress.
The public must be constantly
informed of living science,
that is of science under con-
struction. The public must
expect new and important
scientific progress in the fu-
ture. It must not lose its head
over new developments to
come.

SCIENCE THROUGH
TELEVISION OPENS
A NEW FIELD
rpELEVIStOX, the most-talkedof means of com unication
today, is b°ing used as an instru-
ment for the Popularization of
Science in the USA, England and
France.
In England, science and scien-
tific topics are gradualIy entering
the world of television in thre
ways : first, by talks and demon-
strations in the studio ; secondly,
by outside broadcasts ; and, third-
ly, by the use of films.
Since television with its marked
sense of immediacy, reality and
intimacy is quite different from
the recorded material of film, the
BBC has naturally tended to res-
trict its presentation of scientific
material to the first two methods
whenever possible.
Sudio programmes have covered
a wide range of topics and have
included eminent scientists such
as the Astronomer Royal, and also
demonstrations of various medical
subjects such as Blood Transfu-
sion, Physiotherapy and Mass Ra-
diography.
W ide Range
0/tropics.
A recent series of programmes
was the outcome of a demonstra-
tion by Jean Painleve, at the end
of 1948, that it was possible to,
televise small living organisms
direct with the microscope and
without the use of an intermediate
film. I
The"Under the Microscope"
programmes were used very suc-
cessfully to show audiences some
of the methods of biological re-
search, and to indicate the im-
portance and usefulness of scien-
tific research.
Demonstrations of this kind
have been given by Dr. M. Aber-
crombie of University College.
London, and also by Dr. A. F. W.
Hughes of the Strar : geways Labo-
ratory, Cambridge, who demons-
strated the recently developed
Phase-Contrast microscope.
The use of the microscope di-
rectly with the television camera
is, however, subject to Several
disadvantages of an optical na-
ture, but these could probably be
minimized with improved televi-
sion cameras or, in certain cases.
almost overcome by the use of
an intermediate film.
Visit to the
Royal Mint
A smaller number of outside
broadcasts of a scientific and tech-
nical nature have also been given.
notably a visit to the National
Physical Laboratory at Tedding-
ton, where the Wind Tunnel was
demor. strated, and also a visit to
the Royal Mint. It is believed that
programmes of this kind will be-
come more frequent.
Scientific film programmes have
been used rather less, but there
was a special presentation of
scientific films in the autumn of
1948 on the occas : on of the Inter-
national Scientific Film Congress
in London.
It may be, however, that a re-
by
R. Me V. WESTON
BBC television science adviser
gular science film magazine will
be started before very long.
Although films are not used
when a direct, living programme
is possible, the film still remains
superior to television-and in fact
unique-when it becomes essential
to change the time-scale. This is
not possible with television and
film must be used in cases where
motion is ether too rapid or too
slow to be appreciated by the eye.
Accelerated motion by means of
time-lapse films taken in conjunc-
tion witch the microscope have
been used by Dr. A. F. W. Hughes,
and super slow motion has been
used in some scientific films made
by the Shell Film Unit.
While all the above programmes
were transmitted to the public,
mention must also be made of the
use of television equipment with
closed circuits for special purposes,
such as the transmission of images
of surgical operations for study b
students outside the operating
theatre as now done at Guy's Hos-
pital, and the use of the television
camera in the Maternity Wards of
University College Hospital.
COMIC STRIPS
Teach Science
New development in popularization of science is the use of the
comic strip. This has been done in the main in the U. S. A. and thc
above secion of a strip is taken from a comic book prepared by the
General Electric Cho.
lit. is b-lieved that cartoons are particulary useful, not only for
lower school education, but also for illiterate groups. Techniques for
their use are being develop-d, especially in relation to underdeveloped
areas.
The Role Of
Cheap Books
(Continued from p. 7)-
Popularization has. therefore, an im-
portant jOb to do in attracting recruits
for training as technicians and scientists.
A target we must always have in mind.
therefore, is the older boys and girls at
school, and the students in collpges and
universities.
The older the man the harder he is
to convert to a new idea. Our popular
books are therefore often better aimed
direct at the senior schoolboy, rather
than at the master who teaches him.
It is an interesting fact that many
popular scientific books are read by pro-
fessional scientists. The reason is that
modern science has become so vast and
specialized that an expert in one field
is often completely ignorant in twenty-
nine others, and quite unable to follow
developments in subjects which would
not only interest him but quite possibly
influence his own scientific work if he
: was aware of them.
Popularization has ft role of growing
importance to play here in preventing
the threatened fragmentation and col-
lapse of the scientific world through
extreme specialization. I know from
experience that a periodical such as
"Penguin Science News"serves this func-
tion. though it was not started with that
intention-in fact, when we began we
were ignorant of the need.
Soon we begin to see that the purposes
of popularization may be well served
without our reaching the major part of
the population. Because we refer casually
to"the people"of a country we must
not be footed into thinking of them as
all equal units of individuality.
Some are housewives, some are sailors.
or greengrocers, or schoolboys, or nurses.
or lawyers, or bankclerks, and each
group within the democratic community
has a different education, a differer. t
experience of life, different interests and
different influence in society. Some are
not interested in science and never will
be. or are even antagonistic to it because
it makes more fearful war weapons, or
is complicated and difficult to under-
stand, or upsets cherished beliefs.
But we do not need to worry unduly
over these antagonisms, which it will
take more than cheap books to alter in
any case. If we can reach the young
and the administrators and the scientists.
we shall be going a long way to achieve
our aims.
Finally, finance. Publishing as a
business is beset with difficulties. The
bookseller takes one-third (in some
countries, half) of the selling price of
a book for himself, whatever the size
of the selling price. In consequence, he
is not interested in selling cheap books
it he can sell expensive ones, and som
booksellers refuse to stock the cheap
ones altogether.
Of they money the publisher receives,
a great deal goes for printing and paper,
and the author gets very little, quite
possibly less than he would if his book
had appeared more expensively and sold
fewer copies. In periods of unstable pri-
ces and inflation the cheap book with
its de : icate costing and verv marrow
profit margins is likelv to turn into a
liability overnight, where a more expen-
sive volume can weather the financial
storm.
Then there are all kinds of interna-
tional difficulties : tariff barriers to the
importat : on of foreign-printed books in
some countries ; difficulties of exchange,
where dollars are scarce ; extravagantly
high local labour or printing costs. There
is work here for Unesco : to smooth out
some of the barriers.
We Must tncrease
the Dosa ge of Science
(Continued from p. 5)
The idea of a mobile scientific exhibi-
tion, which is being spoken of. is magni-
ficent. Its success will be certain, prov : d-
ing that the subjects are well chosc ! tl.
and the exhibition allows the viewers to
take part. Visitors will be attracted by
practical demonstrations and films, and
not only by lectures.
An excellent subject is biology in all
its forms. In addition, in Pach country
! the Unesco exhibition should include
a section on native science
Finally it is to be hoped that some of
the specialists accompanying the mobi : e
exhibition can stay for a period long
enough to ensure the formation of
science clubs, which will stimulate and
develop the newly awakened local interest
in science.
I know that my country could be
transformed if full use were made of
science and technology. To do that
requires a major development in mass
popularization of science at all levels.
The immediate road ahead is difficult
but it is well worth treading.

lice at Lank ; arno and locked in the

Making his way to the barracks.
Don Guido pushed open the door
and was met by a chorus of jeers
and catcalls from the boys who.
ragged and flea-bitten, lay shiver-
ing on the bare stone floor.
You can help the child-
ren of the"Villagio del

Don Guido, who had been a
chaplain to the Italian troops and
a prisoner in Germany, was a
cultured man who could eas : ly
have found a quiet post in a
sem : nary,, ßUt the boys were a
challenge to him. He went to the
town hall and persuaded the coun-
cil to remove their guards and
cnams ana leL
him take over
the care of
the boys.
Don Guido
realized that
he must gain
their confi-
dence before
he could hope
to improve the
material and
spiritual con-
ditions under
which they
were living.
He began by
sharing their
miserable exis-
tence and liv-
ing quarters.
First of all
he showed
them how to
clean up the stable and one
day he began to plaster the broken
wanes. The boys watched him
suhenly for a white and then they
too began to work. Very soon he
had them decorating the wa ! Is of
their one-time prison with painted
figures.
Other young orphans heard
about the community at Lanciano
and came to join it. They were
accepted without question, shown
the rules they must obey and told
they were free to come and go as
they please.
The Little Clown
Under the conditions of poverty
and want suffered by the com-
munity at that time. it was only
the faith of Don Guido and the
spirit of hope among the boys that
kept it a1ive, One of the best i1Jus-
trations of this spirit is the story
of a little boy named Romano,
who came to join the group.
Romano belonged to a circus
family. His father and two
brothers were killed during the war
and his mother died later of a
brain tumour. Orphaned and liens-
titute, Romano wandered rimless-
]y across Italy
until one day
when he arrived
at Lanciano.
"What can you
do ?", he was ask-
ed."Well", he
replied,"I cared
for my mother
when she was ill.
If you have sick
boys I could look
after them",
Soon there
were e : ghty boys aged between 5
and 18 at Lanciano and the com-
munity was forced to take over
the entire ground f100r of the
barracks. But the boys remain-

and some of
them even went
out at night to
rob nearby
houses.
Thceatened by
the police and
angry citizens.
Don Guido call-
ed the boys to-
gether and
made them a
proposal."I must
be free to try
and get the food
and clothes and
other things you
need", he told
them."In future
you must be
responsible for
the discipline
among yoursel-
ves. Otherwise I
shall leave you".
After this thece were no more
complaints from the local people,
and inside the community, a strik-
ing change took place. The boys
worked out a"constitution", estab-
lished a bank and a court of
justice and elected a mayor and
storekeepers.
The Cross and the Pine
This, then, was how the Vi ! Iag :o
del Fanciullo-the Vl1lage of the
Child-came into being. Outside
the bart'acks stood an old pine
tree from which the boys had cut
branches for fuel. The top remain-
ing branches were roughly in the
shape'off a cross. This gave the
boys the idea of a symbol for
their community-a green pine
sumounted by a cross,
Gradually the Vlllagio's activi-
ties expanded to include carpentry
and shoemaking. Gifts began to
arrive from other countries, in-
cluèing funds from the Don Suisse
and the Swiss Red Cross, from
the American Friends'Service
Committee and from Father end-
ward Flana-
gan, founder öf

By the end
of 1947, a full
programme of
education and

struction for
the boys was
in operation.

lagio"currency". Some of this
they used to pay for their
daily needs or for extras in the
store or restaurant and the rest
was put aside as insurance against
illness or injury.
By March of last year the Lan-
ciano barracks were no longer
large enough to accommodate the
135 boys who made up the com-
munity and offered Don Guide A
piece of land on the nearby hills
of Silvi, overlooking the Adriatic
Sea.
The boys visited this land but
finally decided to build their new
community on the beach below
the hills near the village of Silvi
Marina. This beach was State pro-
perty but a month after he had
opened negotiations, Don Guido
received it as a gift from Signor
Giuseppe Saragat, Minister of the
Merchant Navy.
Then it was the people and
children of Ge-
neva, Switzer-
land, who came
to the help of
theViIIagio.
They raised 115,-
000 Swiss francs
($29, 000) towards
the cost of build-
ing the new
community and
Signor Antonio
Bandarin. an af-
shitectfromVe-
slice, undertook
to plan the new
Villagio a. nd to
train the boys
in designing and
construction.
In July 1948
the community
moved fromLan-
ciano to the
coast, where the
: >oys slept on the
open beach or in pre-fabricated
huts sent by the Don Suisse.
Work was held up, however, when
it was found that the Germans
had mined the beach during their
retreat in 1944, but once the mi-
nes had been lifted, the work went
steadily ahead.
To-day, a hots ! accommodating
150 boys is almost completed.
Good progress is being made with
the refectory, school chapel, hos-
pital, workshops, streets and re-
creation grounds. The boys have
also formed a co-operative cons-
truction company called the Cos-
truziono Ediiizie Piccolo Pino
d'Oro (little Golden Pine Cons-
truction Company) which will un-
dertake outside building and de-
corat : ng work after the Silvi Ma-'
rina community is completed.
MallY Problems Remain
But there are still many pro-
blems to be solved, the ma : n one
being to find the $75. 000 required
to finish the ViHagio. Meanwhile
the boys still lack furniture and
bedding. Many sleep on wire
netting, with a single blanket. The
village has no electricity and the
nearest fresh water is over a kilo-
metre away.
Yet, despite all these problems,
Don Guido has maintained his
education programme tor the
boys. When he arrived at Lan-
ciano all the boys were illiterate.
To-day nearly 100 have passed
through elementary school and 15
are attendmg high schools. Two
senior boys, Giuseppe de Loreto I
and Giuseppe Torosantucci, have
won scholarships and are study-
ing in Switzerland.
The Village of the Cross and-
the Pine, which is a fine example i
for Italy and the rest of the

problem in its three and a half
years'existence. It would be a
tragedy if the efforts of its foun-
der and citizens should be thrown
away because of failure through
lack of helo.
CZECH
Five-Year Plan
for Culture
Czechoslovakia is putting into operation a big cultural develop-
ment scheme as part of its Five Year Plan for improving the living
standard of the Czech people.
Recognizing that to obtain this higher standard of living
requires not only an improvement in economic conditions but also
an extension of existing cultural activities, the Law on the Five-
Year Flan, enacted last year, laid down that"the material and cul-
tural level of the people must be increased in such a way as to
develop to the full their mental and physical abilities".
Details of the cultural side of the Five-Year Plan were given by
"Prague News Letter", a Czechoslovak review, in its issue of
May 19 last.
It reports that 5, 386 million kopecs-over half of the total in-
vestments ear-marked for the cultural plan-will be spent on the
development of educational facilities, including the erection of
3, 700 new schools by 1953-an increase of 12 00 compared with 1948.
The construction of nursery, kindergarten, technical and me-
dical schools ha6 already begun in Bratislava and Kosice.
Basis changes have also been made more class rooms will be pro-
are now divided into four grades and more class rooms will be pro-
vided to house the increa4>ing number of pupils.
The plan also aims at the establishment of a new scientific
library research institutes and the construction or maintenance of
theatres, art galleries, museums and philharmonic rehearsal rooms.
The plan provides for the construction by 1953 of 18 Houses of
Culture and two Halls of Culture in the Czech Lands, while in Slo-
vakia, 72 Houses of Culture are to be built during the same periods.
All the cultural education of the people will be concentrated in these
institutions.
Mobilm libra. rises-some of which a. rue already operating-will
circulate literary works in all parts of the country, plams having
been made for the purchase of 150 motor cars and 30 buses for this
purpose.
New physièa1 culture facilitift, will include 1. 000 gymnasiums,
2. 700 training grounds and playing fields, 40 swimming pools and
15 physical culture centres.
In order to give people a better chance of education and recrea-
tion after working hours th Five-Year Plan'also provides for the
installation of cultural equipment directly in the factories. This will
include factory shools, libraries, cinemas and physical culture centres.
Education and Natural Resources
(Continued from page 4)
It has been found in practice
that informal adult education
through films, radio and the
press and simply presented read-
ing matter gives good results in
the advanced type of community.
while the teaching of natural
history, gardening and forestry
in schools (if there are any) or
on selected outdoor sites is ef-
ffdive among the more primi-
tive groups. In bo : h cases de-
monstration, rather than precept,
is the method that has the most
powerful appeal. Field workers
get the best results by establish-
ing themselves in a definite area,
small enough to be covered ef-
fectively, and staying there tor
at least a year-long enough,
that is, for their teaching to bear
visible fruits.
Children are easily and keenly
interested in gardens, small cul-
tivated areas and stock-raising
establishments attached to their
schools. In Poland and Holland
remarkable results have followed
the inclusion of natural history
and simple agrieulture in school
and university programmes. Both
of these countries now have pe-
riooicaì"forest festivals"ac-
companied by tree-planting on
a big scale. Children and young
people take part enthusiastically
In these festivals, and their in-
terest In them spreads to their
elders In time. In a general way,
youth groups have proved to be
among the most effective agen-
cies of popular education of this
kind.
Whatever the angle of attack, one
condition 15 essential for success :
the programme must be coopera-
tive, it must embrace the whole
community and every one who
takes part in it, whatever his or
her age or social status, must
understand clearly what is being
done and why. For this, some
knowledge of fundamental is ne-
cessary ; therefore, education is
the key. Knowledge, in agricul-
ture as In every form of activity.
is the foundation of progress.
Whithout the systematic propaga-
tion of knowledge in the first
place, every attempt to II1JJXO'e
the oommon lot must fail.

thods, but would like to indicate
the main lines along which our
activities are developing,
Cooperation
First, co-operation between the
Secretariat and our Member
States. This is twofold : co-opera-
tion with Governments, and with
National Commissions. With. re-
gard to Governments, the action
of the Secretariat has hitherto
Sometimes we aim at the estab-
lishment of contractual rules
consonant with our aims. A first
convention, to facilitate the
international circulation of visual
and auditory material of an edu-
cational, scientific and cultural
character, was adopted at the last
wssion of our General Confer-
ence and is now open to ratifica-
tion.
Others are in preparation. A
draft agreement on the import-
concern Unesco. But they can
also serve as valuable liaison
between the Secretariat and the
intellectual leaders in the dif-
ferent countries whose co-opera-
tion is indispensable to Unesco.
The second direction in which
our efforts are proceeding con-
cerns collaboration with non-
governmental international orga-
nizations. These bodies. offer us
the aid of communities already
established and organized for pur-
tM) NESCO in my view is inthe process of emerging
from its first phase, which
I would describe as exploratory
or experimental. During that
phase the prime objec'ive, as
was natural and indeed neces-
sary, was to survey the field and
try out methods.
As, moreover, Unesco's field of
activity was that of the workings
and fruits of the human mind,
it is understandable that diver-
sity should also have been the
dominating feature of Unesco's
first endeavours. It is only
thanks to the experience gained
in those early explorations that
Unesco has today a clearer view
of its aims and the means to
attain them.
This better understanding of
our ends and means, coupled
with a growing stability in our
internal administrative structure,
appear to me to open the door
to a second phase which shall
be vigorously constructive. If
Unesco is to succeed in the path
of practical achievement it must
now carefully eschew a dispersion
of effort. Our resources in terms
both of money and manpower
are slight, compared with our
responsibilities, and concentration
must bcome our law.

Economic and Social Council
Approves Unesco Report
DR. JAINE TORRES BODET, Director-General of r. rnesco, submitted the Rport to theUnitecl Nations on the work of Unesco during 1948 tc the United Nations Economic
and Social Cuuncil, meeting in the Palais des Nations at Geneva, on July 18.
On this occasion Dr. Torres Bodet made an important statement on the activities of
Unesco of t"hich the main points are given below. He also paid a tribute to his predeces-
sor, Dr. Julian Huxley, whose work as the first Director-General of Unesco laid the
foundation of its success.
After a discussion in the course of which the delegate, expressed their general appre-
ciation of t ! IC work of Unesco during the year under review, a resolution approving the
Report was passed by fourteen votes to none, with jour G. bstentions.
Acllires : : inç the Council at the opening of the day's proceedings Dr. Torres-Bodet said :
Eighteen Directives
In February last our Executive
Board adopted a scale of pr : o-
rities under which the various
projects in our programme have
been assigned budgetary means
corresponding to varying rates of
performance. These steps will
pave the way for a concentration
of our programme whictl will,
I hope. become effective in 1950,
The General Conference at Bei-
rut itself expressed a desire for
some order of precedence In the
programme. tt requested the
Director-General and the Execu-
tive Board to prepare a code of
directives which will later appear
at the head of our list of projects,
and the purpose of which is to
extract the essential purpose of
those projects.
A first set of eighteen directives
has been drawn up. Lying half-
way between the necessarily
broad objectives laid dbwn in our
Constitution and the very precise
purposes of individual projects,
tbese directives lay down a gene-
ral approach which bears witness
to Unesco's desire for greater
cohesion. Parallel progress can be
noted in our methods of work.
I cannot here review those me-
been largely of an informative
character. We have called upon1
Governments to help us gather
the data we needed and to
organize the international ex-
change of information which is
one of our most useful perma-
nent functions. I would refer in
this context to our work in the
field of exchange of persons, and
particularly to the handbook
which lists over 16, 000 fellowships
'and other opportunities for study
abroad, offered in 37 different
countries. Such information is
sometimes collected by means of
enqu : ries, not necessarilv confined
to official sources, such as that
on technical needs of press, radio
and film, covering to date 43
countries.
The Secretariat's activity, how-
ever, is also-and is increasingly
becoming-stimulative and crea-
tive. Sometimes we use a method
which I might describe as per-
suasion by example, such as the
revision of school textbooks, and
our work on teaching for bet-
ter international understanding.
Dr. Torres Bodet and Prof. Laugier, United Nations Secretary-General
of the E. C. O. S. OC.
tion of books, newspapers and
periodicals has been circulated to
Member States for first conside-
ration, and has also been sub-
mitted for comment to the Con-
ference of Contracting Parties
to the General Agreempnt on
Tariffs and Trade. We are activ-
ely engaged in consultations with
a view to drawing up a draft
universal convention on Copy-
right. We have also undertaken
a systematic analysis of all exist-
ing cultural conventions, or
clauses dealing with cultural
matters in other types of inter-
national agreements, with a view
to. the preparation of model
clauses concprning cultural ex-
changes.
Finally, co-operation with gov-
ernments has in some cases taken
the form of co-operative assis-
tance. Such assistance may be of
a material or a technical nature.
It has been material, for exam-
ple, in our programme of re-
construction of war-devastated
countries, whom Unesco has
sought to aid in two ways : first
by direct emergency supplies,
paid for out of the Organiza-
tion's unfortunately modest re-
sources ; secondly, bv stimulating
private gifts. As to technical as-
sistance, we have provided it this
year in the education field in
the form of consultative missions.
sent at the reauest of govern-
ments and paid for in part by
those governments, to studv for
their benefit problems formulated
by themselves. Two such missions
have been at work in recent
months, in the Philippines and
in Thailand ; and one is about
to leave for Afghanistan.
National Commissions
As regards the National Com-
missions, you are aware that the
very idea of them was originated
by our Organization. They are
intended to serve a twofold pur-
pose. Consisting of exceptionally
qualified or representative indivi-
duals, they are designed as con-
sultative bodies for advising the
government on questions which
poses of international co-opera-
tion. In their respective fields
they give practical expression to
that understanding and agree-
ment beyond the closed walls of
political units to which Unesco
is dedicated. Eighty-two of these
organizations have been granted
consultative status and eighteen
further applications are now
being examined. To my mind
this represents a source of great
strength for us, and one on
which we should draw for joint
constructive effort.
That is what we try to do
whenever the need for restoring
international relations between
intellectual and professional cir-
cles has caused Unesco to initiate
action and assume specific res-
ponsibilities. The relations with
the International Council of
Scientific Unions in the domain
of natural science are a typical
instance of this kind of work,
which in the last few months has
extended to fresh fields. In
January the International Coun-
cil of Philosophy and Humanistic
studies was set up, under Unesco'3
auspices. Unesco has joined hand
with the World Health Organiza-
tion to establish a Council for
the Co-ordination of Internatio-
nal Congresses of the Medical
Sciences. Finally, the Internatio-
nal Theatre Institute. created last
year. is growing steadily.
Thus. followin&, the upheavals
of the war, the international
community of research worker.
and creators, who form the van-
guard of progress, is ! n course of
reestablishment. Numerous con-
ferences and other meetings, an
ever closer network of contacts,
by ensuring the exchange uf
knowledge and comparison bet-
ween ideas. maintain and develop
this association of minds.
The third type of collaboration
in which Unesco participates IS
collaboration with the United
Nations and with the other Spec-
ialized Agencies. I need not enu-
merate the almost daily occa-
sions on wh : ch, in 1949 as in 1948,
we have been associated with
their work. I will onlv refer to
the most recent instance, namely,
the plan for technical aid to
under-developed countries.
A Call To Action b.
In order that those unfavoured
by history and geography may
catch up with the more fortunate,
it is not enou to furnish them
with the means of progress. They
must be made capable and desire
ous of using them and, for that
purpose, it must be"their"prog-
ress which is involved, and they
must know it. It is therefore
essential that technical assistance
be closely linked with a cor-
responding effort to guide peoples
towards an active and intelligent
participation in the shaping of
their own destiny as they them-
selves see it.
The work of peace to which
the United Nations as a whole
is dedicated requires that the
synthesis of forces and special
skills, and especially the alliance
between the intellectual and the
technical, the economic and the
social shall be built up again in
the light of real problems viewed
in all their complexity. That
synthesis can only take place and
is even only conceivable in terms
of the concrete. The problem of
co-ordination must be posed and
solved in and through action.
"It would be dangerous to believe that con-
centration of effort necessarily means reduc-
tion of expenditure. Any programme, no
matter how modest, that aims at obtaining
tangible results, is more costly than a policy
that does not succeed in going beyond the
administration stage...
"Jf Unesco were simply to give a list of
promises without possessing the means of
fulfilling them, it would be in danger of
deceiving the people. By its very vocation, the
Organization must serve the truth...
"The tendency to universality should not
prejudice respect for the genius of each na-
tion. The aim in view should be not stand-
ardization but an attempt to'enrich ourselves
by our differences'. All cultures should be of
mutual help without seeking to dominate one
over the other..."

and Germany
IT has been shrewdly observed that great poets, far frombeing th  interpreters and representatives of their own
peoples, are their critics, correctors and integrators. Remember
Dante and the Florentines, as he saw them ; Cervantes and his
Spanish contemporaries, crazy about knight-errantry ; Shakes-
peare and the English-proverbially correct and c01d, which his
dramas certainly are not ; and Goethe, serene, well-balanced
and thoroughly human, in contrast to his Germans-a warlike
and fanatical race, serious and hard-working, admittedly, but
with a considerable share of pedantry.
GOETHE was not to the tasteof the politically-minded
among his people, who more than
once showed that to his supreme
genius they preferred a poet of
the second rank, such as Schi'ter.
And when the German national
tradition was intensified to the
point of delirium, and the first
cf'ntenary of Goethe's death ar-
rived, in 1932 ; the demonstrations
were prepared with a lack of
enthusiasm which clearly re-
pealed the gulf, the ostrangement
that separated him from what
had then become Hitter's Ger-
many.
Now that misfortune has
smitten his great nation-great
in its many virtues, its talents
and its energy-and at the same
time has smitten Europe, thus
deprived of a ferce essential to
its balance and situated in its
geographical centre, what better
can Germany do, at this bicen-
tenary of the birth of her
mighty poet, than to raise herself
towards him in spirit, accept his
message and'reflect on it anew,

with such devotion and sincerity
that it shall restore tight to the
minds and human feeling to the
hearts of his countrymen ?
I did not accept the invitation
to participate in the honoursshown to Goethe in Germany in
1932, for they seemed to me to
be insincere. But I turned again
to his books and re-read them,
and continued to write critical
studies about them, as I had
done during the first World War,
when Germany was ughiing
against Italy, as I did again dur-
ing the second war when Italy,
having become Fascist, was allied
to a Germany that had become
Nazi ; and as I continued to do
at the end of the war, amid the
political tasks that I had ac-
cepted. And a) ways there came
to me from Goethe comfort and
serenity and courage, because he
always carried me beyond and
above the things of the day-
which is the only way of achiev-
ing real union with them, of
loving and serving them.
But it was no longer possible
for me to speak openly and
drectly with the Germans-1
mean with those Germans who,
like myself, were concerned with
philosophY and history and
poetry-as I had been used to
do in the pre-1914 days, exchang-
ing ideas and suggestions and
forming precious and unforget-
table friendships with them. And
when, in 1936, a Swiss paper asked
me to express my opinion about
the Germany of that day-which
had recently caused a great scan.
dal by having, among other
things, altered the names of its
cultural publications (for ins-
tance, transforming the Review
of Cultural Philosophy into the
Review of German Cultural Phi-
losophy), and had removed from
the pediment of HeidelberJ Un -
versity the inscription, To the
Living Spirit, replacing it by : To
the German Spint-I sent that
Swiss paper an article inspired by
the feeling of Goethe, who always
detested the idea and the express-
sion Deutschtum, and to which
I gave the title of"The Germany
we used to love". This article
could not be published in Ger-
many, or even discussed by my
friends there.
The period in which Germany
should take most pride is that
in which she possessed such a
poet as WOlfgang Goethe, who
belongs to the small company
that is headed by Homer, toge-
ther with thinkers who to this
very day are still masterly and
up-to-date-Kant and Hegel and
a few others, such as Jacobi, that
very noble genius, who deserve
to share their high place, and
historians and philologists who
put fresh life into the study of
language and history ; not to
mention scientists, physicists and
mathematicians. Certainly-you
will say-the Germans take great
pride in that period when their
country was centred on Weimar,
even if they are unable to cease
loving the other extreme of
Potsdam, to which their souls
are secretly attracted. Yes, they
do take pride in it. But even
when they do so with complete
sincerity, they do not-if I may

be permitted to say so-properly
understand its origin and pur-
pose. They regard it as belonging
entirely to Germany, or as a
specifically German reaction to
and rebellion against the culture
of Europe as a whole.
What was peculiar to Germany
in the age of Weimar was a
galaxy of outstanding mmds,
such as can only be entirely
equalled, perhaps, in the Greece
of Pericles'day. Germany was
thus able to exert in the world
of ideas a hegemony which was
conferred upon her, not by her
Deutschtum. her Germanism, but
by her Europeatum, or rather by
that world-spirit which, at other
periods of modern history, had
conferred the same hegemony
upon Renaissance Italy or upon
the France of Descartes and
Louis XIV, and without which it
would have been valueless or
inexistent.
The Germany of those days
was the legitimate daughter of
Europe, taking over the manage-
ment of the ancient house-not
a daughter shut out like a foundt-
ling, and filled with rancour,
desire for revenge, and the spirit
of destruction and self-assertion.
And now this well-deserved and
much-desired hegemony returns
to her, in conformity with the
new feelings and necds of the
human race, for the good of us
all ; and all of us will greet her
with emotion and admiration ;
and our gratitude will perhaps
be so great as to make us forget
how much of our own strength
we have had to give out, in order
to revive her and support her
so that she should completely
fulfil her mission and not, in hcr
turn, yield up the hegemony to
another nation which has mean-
while been preparing for the call,
as is required by the vicissitudes
of things human.

The Complete man
by Jules ROMAINS
THE complete man will not behe who learns out of books
everything that the special-
ists know (besides, this is a child-
ish and ridiculous ambition-in-
creasingly so). It will be he who.
within himself, succeeds in reviv-
ing the various powers and apti-
tudes of man ; he who. by inward
exercise, gains control of man's
various ways of listening, ques-
tioning, feeling nature, and res-
ponding to her.
The complete man-or his
not all-unworthy approximation
- must be able himself to assume
the attitude that forms the start-
ing-point of a poem, a tragedy,
a work of historical research, a.
scientific discovery, a philosophic-
al meditation... in short, not
all the individual attitudes. but
each of the main attitudes of the
human mind.
That is not all. He must also, if
he can, learn by experience how
a State is governed. Neither will
he be satisfied with looking on
at the daily round of life. He
must enter fully into life itself,
experience the pass : ons. arouse
them in others, discover how they
may be made to benefit the spirit
or how they can be controlled.
For the art of living-one
of the greatest and most exact-
ing of all arts-must include
an understanding of all the con-
ditions to which life is subject,
an estimation of the opposing
forces, the skill to manoeuvre
among them, utilizing or evading
them turn by turn, as the sailor
does.
Count up the men who, since
the dawn of civilization, have
been bold enough to conceive of
tbeir work as Goethe saw his,
were h : ghly conscious of their
resources, and even at periods
when the undertak : ng was less
wildly excessive. And not merely
to conceive it, in a fit of boyish
lyricism, but to remain faithful
to it throughout a very long life-
time, to carry it out with the pa-
tience of a labouring I can
think of only one precedent-
that of Leonardo da Vinci. By
comparison-let us have the
courage to admit it-Aristotle,
Dante, Shakespeare were special-
ists. Of course the comparison
would lose some of its value were
it not that in a few at least of
their supreme ach : evements, Leo-
nardo and Goethe rose to heights
that no one has surpassed. I am
not suggesting that the men of
specialized gfnius be less honour-
ed because of this. But we may
admit, all the same, that if Leo-
nardo and Goethe had never exist-
ed, our conception of man would
be lesser than it is.

Whatever their technical ! perfec-
tion-towards which new strides
are being made every day-
colour reproductions can never,
of course, take the place of the
original work. They can never
be more than closer and closer
likenesses. But they are a very
valuable medium for the infer-
mation and instruction Of stu-
dents, teachers and the general
public. They make known in the
remotest corners of the earth the
most varied, even the most con-
tradictOry, forms of art, thu :

in all its rich diversity, through-

of art and hence of the dif-
/ereMt ctt) ! Hsat : o ? ts rom M) 7t : chf nt civilizations fr m which
those forms have sprung.
That is why Unesco is organ'zing
a series of travelling exhibitions
of colour reproductions. The first
of these exhibitions was inaugu-
rated at Unesco House in June.
It comprises about fifty repro-
ductions, chosen with a dew to
giving as accurate an idea as pos-
sible of the period from 1860 (the
impressionists) to the present
day-a very rich and important
period from the pictorial point of
view. The main pictorial tenden-
cies and the principal painters of
that period are represented. The
reproductions were chosen by a
committee of art experts from
among the best available. having
regard both to the technical
quality of the reproduction and
to the artistic ralue of the ori
ginal from which it was copieà
This exhibition will be sent
mainly to countr : es that have nc
important collections of original
works of that period,

the same reproductions have been
prepared, and offered by Unesco
to certain Member States, which
will exhibit them. A catalogue

IS T is difficult to give an ap-M preciation in a few lines or
even pages of the complex
utput of a life of research and
experiment. While taking its ap-
pointed place in history, a living
work also contains within itself
the seeds of new meanings. We
may ask whether it is the work
its : f that reveals new facets in
terms of new modes of cultural
expression, ever creating for it-
self a vast public, or whether it
is ourselves who read into the
work, now a part of history, new
meanings by continual re-inter-
pretation in our minds and our
imaginations.
The Munch exhibition at Unes-
co House raisers this question yet
again.
The revelation of modern
French Art came to Munch as
early as 1889 when Impressionism
had already formulated its major
dogmas, set its ripples circling
outwards, and was beginning to
crystallize into a new convention.
Hence Munch's quest for poetry
was to follow other lines. Moreo-
ver his cbse spiritual links with
the dramatic and literary vision
of the northern world led him
instinctively to give each symbol
a significance transcending that
of the form alone. The symbol
becomes expressive in itself. Ac-
cordingly it is the drawing which
is the dominant factor in the
whole of his extensive and care-
ful work, and which leads him
to welcome every occasion of giv-
ing it play ; faces, things, street
and domestic scenes, and even
1die experiments of other artists...
Echoes of the new possibilities
of expression evolved by such
artists as Forain, Toulouse Lau-
trec, or Van Gogh. are easily re-
cognizable in Munch's drawings ;
but Munch himself so dominates
the whole that each such echo
becomes, more than a face. a
thing or a scene from a life of
the century's end, a visual poem-
whose innermost and most secret
trend the artist has tried to
grasp.
The challenge of that other
great northerner, Van Gogh. is
echoed and converted into a.
more clear-cut. almost social af-
firmation which is at the root of
an occasionally morbid and
bookish aspect of express : onism.
It was in Germany principally.
at the begins : nag of the present
century, that that affirmation
was taken up and clarified.
foreshadowing already the sor-
rows and ruins which were to be.
Schmitt-Rottluff, F. Marc, Ko-
koschka. Hofer. etc... in the first
twenty years of the century re-
ceived indeed from Munch a mes-
sage twhich, in the expressive vio-
lence of a symbol, formulated one
of the most agonizing aspects of
the modern world and its pro-
blems.

ART CRITICS MEET
" : :' :'""" AT UNESCO HOUSE
The Second International
Congress of Art Critics was held
at Unesco House, Paris, from
June 27 to J'y 1. Dr. Jaime

operation between Unesco and
art critics.
More than 200 art critics
belonging to about 35 countries
were present. The importance of
the Congress was marked by the
presence of 13 delegations re-
presenting the Art C r i t i c s*
Associations of the following
countries : Belgium, Brazil, Cze-
choslovakia, Denmark. France,
Greece, the Irish Free State,
Italy, Mexico, Poland, Switzer-
land, the United Kingdom and
the United States.
The main business of the
Congress was to set up the Inter-
national Association of Art
Critics. whose executive com-
mittee was formed as follows :
PRESIDENT : M. Paul Fierens
(Belgium).
VICE-PRESIDENTS : Sr. Lio-
nello Venturi (Italy) ; Mr. James
Johnson Sweeny (U. S. A.)
M. Raymond Cogniat (France
Mr. Eric Newton (Great Brita : n) ;
Sr. Crespo de 1 : 1 Serna (Mexico) ;
M. G. Knuttel (Holland).
GENERAL SECRETARY
Mme. Gille Delafon (France).
DEPUTY GENERAL SECRE-
TARIES : Sr. Milliet (Brazil) ;
M. Foundoukidis (Greece,).
One of the principal themes of
the Congress was"Art and So-
ciety". A number of papers on
this subject were read, and
interesting discussions followed.
At its last meeting the Congress
adopted resolutions dealing with
liberty of criticism, the defence
of modern art, cooperation with
Unesco to defend authors'rights,
the teaching of art and the for-
mation of an International Fede-
ration of Art Critics and Histo-
rians. The hope was expressed
that artists themselves would
soon form an International Fede-
ration. and that all forms of poli-
tical discussion would be excluded
from the proceedings of the Art
Critics'Association and annual
CongreM.
