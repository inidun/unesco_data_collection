"Cancer claims a steady toll of human lives all over the
world and in many countries it is second only to diseases
of the heart and arteries as a cause of death. It is also a
disease which arouses strong emotions. Cancer is a subject
many people prefer to shun; a disease which is commonly,
and wrongly, believed to be untreatable;a disease from
which many people die or suffer needlessly because,
whether from ignorance or unreasoned fear, they do not
seek advice until it is too late." These words by
Dr M.G. Candau, Director-General of the World Health
Organization, explain why WHO has chosen as its theme for
1970, "Early detection of cancer saves lives." This issue
of the "Unesco Courier" was prepared in collaboration
with the Office of Public Information of WHO and the
International Union Against Cancer.

CANCER
where
we stand
by John Higginson
T,
HE increasing disillusion¬
ment during recent years among both
the lay public and the scientists in the
absence of an immediate break¬
through in either the treatment or
prevention of cancer has tended to
lead to excessive pessimism.
This attitude probably results from
the expectations engendered by the
exciting progress in molecular biology
JOHN HIGGINSON has been director of
the International Agency for Research on
Cancer, at Lyon, France, since 1966. Born
in Ireland and now a citizen of the United
States, he has been particularly concerned
with the geographical and environmental
aspects of cancer, and directs the Interna¬
tional Agency's research work on viruses
and chemical agents in cancer and their
relation to environment. This article
appeared in the Feb-March 1970, issue of
"World Health", published by WHO.
and chemotherapy in the late fifties
and early sixties which appeared to
offer immediate solutions to the
problem and gave rise to claims that
were often widely and uncritically
disseminated in the lay press.
Though our brightest hopes have not
been fulfilled and the malignant cell
has been shown to be more complex
than used to be thought, the progress
made in cancer research during the
last two decades is considerable and
offers much hope for the future.
For some time, scientists have
warned that the immediate future
may not provide quick solutions to
complex biological problems and
that we should be prepared for a
period of steady, if less spectacular,
progress. Many people, however,
have become so accustomed to the
concept of "breakthroughs" that the

CANCER (Continued)
Some astonishing facts and figures

make them possible are frequently
forgotten.
While prophecies in science are
notoriously fallacious and solutions to
certain cancer problems may arise
sooner than expected, past experience
requires that cancer research be
regarded - as essentially long-term;
financial and manpower requirements
need to be planned accordingly.
To speak of a single solution to the
"cancer problem" Is an oversimplifica¬
tion. From several point of view,
cancer of each individual organ in
the body should be regarded sep¬
arately since each may require a
different approach. Nonetheless, there
are certain common features of
malignant disease which justify con¬
sideration of cancer as an entity,
especially when problems at the
cellular level are under investigation.
During recent years, the absolute
number of cancer cases' has risen in
industrialized states. This Is due in
the first place to the increasing
proportion of elderly people in the
population who are prone to cancer.
This rise does not represent a true
increase in frequency but reflects
improved medical care and Increased
expectation of life that have followed
the control of such infectious diseases
as tuberculosis.
Secondly, there has been a large
increase in lung cancer incidence
during the last two decades, especially
among males. The increase in cancer
of other sites has been less marked
or is negligible. In fact, in most
developed countries, the frequency of
stomach cancer is declining for
reasons not understood but which
would appear to be associated with
an improved standard of living. Thus,
one cannot speak of a general cancer
Increase in modern industrial society.
The remainder of this article will
discuss certain highlights of the last
two decades which illustrate best
the immense Increase in knowledge
which has occurred in relation to this
disease and which has formed the
base on which future research pro¬
grammes can be developed in a
rational manner.
Much of this information has now
raised a whole series of new problems,
both at the sociological as well as at
the molecular level, and not all of these
problems are susceptible to solution
by available technology.
There are two major long-term
objectives in relation to cancer re¬
search:
Cancer Prevention. This is the
ideal solution as its aim is to prevent
cancer and thus avoid the heavy costs,
both economic and physical, associat¬
ed even with successful treatment.
Cancer Treatment. Since it is
unlikely that complete prevention of
all cancers will be possible within
the foreseeable future, continued
attempts to seek hew and improved
methods of treatment are continuing
to demand a high priority.

THE
PHANTOM
HAND
In recent years thermography has
become a valuable aid in the
early detection of cancerous
tumours. Tumours are hotter
than healthy areas of the body
and thermography consists of
producing images based on heat
variations. The hotter zones
appear white and the colder
areas dark. Far left, a thermograph
of a human profile. In the
photo, top left, two hands were
placed on a table and a
thermograph made. Shortly
afterwards, a second
thermograph was made(lower left)
after one hand had been
withdrawn. The phantom hand
which remains visible represents
the heat transferred to the table
The use of thermography has
had startling results in detecting
breast cancer.

Studies on the epidemiology of
cancer have produced some of the
most significant clues regarding the
causation of cancer in man.
While attempts have been made
since the beginning of the 19th
century to collect statistics, Living¬
stone could still write a hundred years
ago that "cancer is a disease of
civilization". However, significant
progress in the collection of cancer
data has been made since the second
World War and adequate statistics
are now available to enable assess¬
ment of cancer patterns under a wide
variety of environmental conditions.
Cancer affects all races and com¬
munities, but there are marked dif¬
ferences in the frequency with which
various organs are affected: for
example, cancer of the liver and of the
mouth are more frequent in southern
Africa and in India respectively
than in Europe and North America,
whereas the reverse is true for cancer
of the large intestine. Other studies
have shown that migrant populations
develop the cancer patterns of the
country to which they migrate and
not that of the country of origin.
These facts have been most im¬
portant in preventing undue emphasis
on genetic factors in man and in
indicating that most cancers are
primarily influenced by environmental
factors, though they may be modified
to a minor degree by individual
susceptibility. Skin cancer is an im¬
portant exception in that it is signifi¬
cantly affected by pigmentation.
The recognition that most cancers
are not inevitable but are caused by
environmental factors has had im¬
portant practical results in directing
increased research to identify these
factors as a first meaningful step
towards prevention.
The demonstration of a group of
individuals who show an unusual
frequency of a cancer has been of
great assistance in relation to identi¬
fying tumours of occupational and
cultural origin, since individuals in
these cases are exposed to unusually
high concentrations of a carcinogen
similar to that found in the laboratory.
Nearly 200 years ago, Percival Potts
demonstrated that cancer of the
scrotum and skin was very frequent
among London chimney-sweeps. He
ascribed these tumours to the soot
with which their clothes were con¬
tinually impregnated. With different
methods of heating and improved
standards of living, chimney-sweep
cancer has largely disappeared.
High-risk groups have been identi¬
fied in many industries. Today, leg¬
islation to prevent cancer is enforced
in most industrialized countries and
the worker is protected either by better
techniques or by substituting safer
compounds for the dangerous agent.
However, these success stories are
often forgotten by the public, since 7
once a cancer has been controlled it '
no longer represents a problem of
interest. Examples of such disappear--

CANCER (Continued)
50,000 new drug compounds tested each year
ing industrial tumours include bladder
cancer in dye workers and osteo¬
sarcomas in watch-makers. Yet the
continual development of new man-
made chemicals as well as changes in
technology require constant vigilance
on the part of the industrial doctor, and
industrial techniques must be con¬
tinually monitored to avoid the intro¬
duction of possible new hazards.
Since the identification of a hazard
by the appearance of a tumour in
man clearly represents a failure in
prevention, large-scale programmes
operate today in many countries to
test the potential cancer-producing
properties of new chemicals.
Unfortunately, facilities are insuffi¬
cient to test all new chemicals in the
environment, even in the most in¬
dustrialized countries. Further, the
extrapolation of results of animal tests
to man is complex and involves many
difficulties.
Thus, while it is generally agreed
that substances carcinogenic to ani¬
mals should not be utilized by man
unless essential, it should not be
forgotten that all but two of the many
stimuli known to be carcinogenic to
man were first identified in man and
not in animals. Furthermore, some
substances identified as carcinogenic
to animals would appear relatively
harmless to man at the levels to which
he is exposed.

THERS, such as drugs and
pesticides, may offer benefits which
for the moment would appear to out¬
weigh their cancer-producing poten¬
tial. It is possible in some cases that
their elimination may lead to greater
tragedies in terms of health and nutri¬
tion than1 would result from their
utilization.
For example, pesticides in malaria
control and food production have
saved tens of thousands of lives.
Isoniazid has been essential for the
treatment of tuberculosis and there
is no evidence that it has carcinogenic
properties in man although it has
produced lung tumours in mice.
It is recognized that the public health
official today must take calculated
risks based on the available data.
Studies made in the last two decades
indicate how such data may be
collected by the use of appropriate
epidemiological techniques.
In conclusion, the advanced public
health measures of today which
monitor our water, air and food for
cancer-producing agents are far
advanced in comparison with the
situation at the beginning of this
century, and represent steady, if un¬
spectacular, progress.
The relation of a cancer to a cultural
habit provides one of the greatest
success stories of modern cancer
research. Twenty years ago a firm
association was first demonstrated
between cancer of the lung and the
cigarette habit in man, although the
relationship had been suspected for
much longer. Numerous additional
studies have now placed this causal
association beyond any reasonable
doubt and, although other factors such
as air pollution may be significant, in
the absence of cigarette smoking they
are of relatively little importance.
The potential benefits of this disco¬
very can be illustrated by the situation
in the United Kingdom where nearly
40 per cent of all cancer deaths in man
are due to lung cancer. Failure to
achieve this level of prevention results
from the unwillingness of the average
individual to accept that a pleasurable
habit is dangerous. However, there is
evidence that with increasing educa¬
tion smoking will gradually begin- to
diminish.
More than 500 representatives of
35 countries attended the first World
Conference on Smoking and Health in
1967 and it was interesting to note that
in some countries a significant proporr
tion of doctors have ceased smoking
or switched to pipes or cigars.
Intensive research is now being
directed towards identifying exactly
the hazardous stimuli in cigarette
smoking and developing safer ciga¬
rettes.
Cigarette smoking and excessive
drinking have also been implicated as
major factors in cancer of the oes¬
ophagus and mouth in many areas.
In India, mouth cancer which accounts
for approximately one third of all
cancers in males has been shown to
be related to betel chewing. Again,
prevention is theoretically possible.
Unfortunately, little is known about
the cause of many cancers including
cancers of the stomach, colon, rectum
and breast and leukaemia. However,
the many potential chemical car¬
cinogens which may contaminate food
or air are being investigated.
Recently, new groups of compounds
which occur in nature and contaminate
food have been discovered and are
now being studied for their effects on
man. Moreover,- as our knowledge of
events at the molecular level of the
cell increases, it may eventually be
possible to determine in advance those
chemical compounds that are potential
carcinogenic hazards.
I
INFORMATION services
have markedly improved and the data
obtained in one laboratory is now
rapidly transferred to another in the
same or different countries, although
at times in some countries certain
industries have not always been as
collaborative as the situation warrants.
It is therefore possible to state that
during the last three decades research
on chemicals carcinogenic for man
has been placed on a rational basis,
which is essential for the final iden¬
tification of the compounds concerned.
Defining the potential problem has
also indicated the limitations of fi¬
nancial and physical support since it
is estimated that over a quarter of a
million new compounds are synthe¬
sized each year, of which between
5,000 and 10,000 require testing.
Viruses were first identified as
causing experimental cancer in birds
in 1908. During the last two decades
it has been demonstrated that they
cause leukaemia in several species,
including dogs, cats and cattle. There
is now, moreover, increasing circum-
stancial evidence that they may also
be associated with certain types of
human cancer for example, Burk-
itt's lymphoma, a childhood disease
in Africa, in which the virus shows
the same properties as that which
causes infectious mononucleosis, a
relatively mild and common blood
disease. A very similar virus has also
been discovered more recently in
tumours of the post-nasal space.
Major attempts by large-scale sero-
epidemlological surveys of a type
unforeseeable even a few years ago
are now being planned to find out
whether this relationship is causal.
While certain common human viruses
such as the adenoviruses which may
cause the common cold have been
shown to be carcinogenic, their role
remains unproven in man.
The virus concept has been of great
value in elucidating mechanisms of
cellular metabolism, especially in rela¬
tion to nucleic acids. Since the
]]>

carcinogenic viruses are composed of
a core of either DNA or RNA, much
has been learned of how such viruses
may modify the cell's own nucleic acid
following infection, with the resultant
neoplasia.
The potential nature of these dis¬
coveries will become clearer during
the next decade, when the role of
viruses in human cancer will almost
certainly be clarified; evaluation of
control methods should follow. The
progress in developing new concepts
of malignant disease introduced by
the virus hypothesis may be difficult
to appreciate by those not engaged in
this field, but this work has modified
many concepts of cell control and the
progress of the past fifteen years will
probably be more easily appreciated
in the light of the successes of the
next decade.
Not only have the standard methods
of surgery and radiotherapy been im¬
proved, but chemotherapy has made
giant progress since 1947 when it had
just been shown that acute leukaemia
in children could respond to drugs.
Since then a vast number of new
compounds has been developed and
studied. In the USA alone, 50,000
compounds are screened each year.
The use of these compounds in
leukaemia in various combinations and
with other forms of treatment has
brought great improvements: whereas
in 1964 complete remission of leuka¬
emia was found in only 40-50 per cent
of cases in children and the median
survival was one to one and a half
years, in 1967 complete remission was
possible in over 90 per cent of children
and the median survival had risen to
three or more years.
Data collected from many countries
would indicate that today it is even
possible to believe that some leuka¬
emia patients have actually been cured
and further successes would appear
probable. A complete cure by chemo¬
therapy is now also possible in a
proportion of patients with Hodgkin's
disease and choriocarcinoma, and
possibly also Burkitt's lymphoma in
Africa.
However, gains are small against
the major cancers, colon, rectum and
breast, where the surgeon and the
radiotherapist are still responsible for
most treatments, and stomach and
lung cancers, which are still highly
refractory to therapy. However, the
five-year survival for cancer of the
colon increased from 31 per cent of
cases in the early forties to 46 per
cent in the late fifties.
It Is clearly fundamental to the
application of the classical therapies
that the patient be seen early enough
in the course of his disease to permit
adequate treatment, and much progress
has been made in techniques that may
prove valuable in identifying cancer
at an early age.
These techniques largely rely on the
identification of malignant cells in
various secretions of the body. Un¬
fortunately, they are not always
utilized by those who most need this
type of examination, even when
available. Thus far, their overall effect
on mortality has been relatively slight;
however, the whole concept of early
diagnosis and, thus, possible curative
treatment has had a radical influence
on modern therapy.
f*
^B^ANCER is a disease of the
cell. A widely accepted hypothesis is
that an initial event leading to a change
in a single cell may result in a series
of events within succeeding genera¬
tions of cells, culminating in a tumour.
Whereas progress as indicated by
actual improved therapy or meaning¬
ful prevention has not yet resulted
from developments in the field of
molecular biology, there is no doubt
that progress in this area offers the
best and most rational long-term
approach to cancer prevention and
therapy.
As our knowledge of the factors
involved in cell control, multiplication,
transformation and drug , resistance
increases, it is not improbable that the
progress of the last decade will be
regarded as the watershed of our
understanding of the neoplastic
disease at the basic level.
Another related field in which much
progress has occurred is that of
immunology, which has developed
during the last fifteen years from a
discipline which was believed to have
no relevance to cancer, to one that
now shows great promise not only
in relation to therapy but also in
diagnosis and control.
In conclusion, it is obvious that very
significant progress has been made in
all aspects of cancer research during
the last decade, which has resulted in
improved therapy and prevention.
The fact that expectations have not
been fully realized only reflects the
complexity of the problem and not
lack of progress; the efforts of the
many dedicated workers in this
arduous and non-spectacular field
should be recognized. Furthermore,
cancer studies have provided con¬
siderable "spin off" for other branches
of medicine, a fact which is often
ignored.

Cigarettes
and cancer
T
10
OBACCO has been in use
in Europe for less than 400 years. It
has been smoked in pipes, cigars and
cigarettes and it has been taken as
snuff. It has been praised by many
and, until the last twenty years, con¬
demned by relatively few. Factory-
made cigarettes have come to be by
far the commonest means of smoking
tobacco only during the twentieth cen¬
tury. But during this century the pro¬
duction and smoking of cigarettes so
greatly increased that their ill effects
have been most forcibly brought to
medical and then to public notice,
especially in the last twenty years.
The first serious contributions to
medical literature about the dangers
of smoking were made twenty years
ago in Britain and the United States.
Since the early 1930s, cancer of the
lung had been increasing rapidly
amongst the causes of death and two
enquiries demonstrated that most
patients with cancer of the lung had
been cigarette smokers.
Those first two enquiries made a
prima facie case but they were follow¬
ed by much more detailed studies
which, over the next ten years, proved
up to the hilt the causal relationship
between cigarette smoking and lung
cancer. In those ten years, the num¬
ber of deaths from lung cancer in
men in Britain went up again by 74 per
cent and the number of deaths from
the same cause In women began to
increase.
It takes a long time to produce a
cancer and that Is why it took so long
for us to realize that the increase in
the use of cigarettes twenty or thirty
years earlier was the cause of death
from cancer so many years later.
SIR GEORGE GODBER Is Chief Medical
Officer to three government departments
or ministries in the United Kingdom: Dept.
of Health and Social Security; Dept. of
Education and Science; the Home Office.
He has represented the U.K. as chief dele¬
gate to every World Health Assembly since
1961, and has written widely on medicine
and public health. This article appeared
in the Feb-March 1970 issue of "World
Health".
Cancer of the lung can occur in peo¬
ple who have not smoked but, among
heavy smokers, those who smoke per¬
haps 40 cigarettes a day or more, it
occurs twenty times as often.
In some people, like uranium miners
or workers exposed to asbestos dust,
lung cancer occurs more commonly
still, but almost entirely amongst those
who are cigarette smokers. It occurs
more often in people living in big
cities than those- who live in the coun¬
try, but again the increase is in the
cigarette smokers ; also, the city dwel¬
ler often smokes more cigarettes than
the man who lives in the country.
The studies of lung cancer in
smokers naturally lead to consider¬
ation of other causes of death, and
this has shown that two common
causes, bronchitis and coronary
thrombosis in younger men, are
also much more common in ciga¬
rette smokers. Probably a lot more
people die each year from these
conditions brought on or aggravated
by cigarette smoking than from lung
cancer. There are other less common
cancers, of the mouth, throat and gul¬
let and even of the bladder and liver,
which are all more frequent in ciga¬
rette smokers than in non-smokers.
In fact, thexman who smokes twenty
or more cigarettes a day from the age
* \9 J
]]>

<![CDATA[
of twenty onwards is likely to live five
years less than the non-smoker of the
same age, and if he smokes forty or
more he is likely to live eight years
less. The man of fifty smoking twenty
cigarette a day has double the chance
of dying in the next ten years than the
non-smoker.
In Britain, probably more than
50,000 people die each year from
diseases brought on by smoking ciga¬
rettes. Of course a lot of them are
older men, but it has been calculated
that at least 150,000 years of working
life before the age of 65 are lost each
year in Britain for this reason. Simi¬
lar calculations In the United States
give much the same answer, as do
enquiries in Canada, Denmark, Hol¬
land, Sweden and Norway.
At this time Britain probably suffers
more than most of the other countries.
That may be due to a longer history
of heavy cigarette smoking, to the
fact. that British men smoke more of
each cigarette than do Americans, and
perhaps because more of Britain's po¬
pulation live in crowded cities.
Most of the attention has been
given in the past to lung cancer but
the less dramatic diseases, chronic
bronchitis and emphysema, are a great
deal more damaging to health gener
ally because they cause long periods of
invalidism before they kill. Coronary
thrombosis, too, may cause long
periods of invalidism if it does not
cause sudden death. Furthermore,
the chronic bronchitic dying after years
of increasing disability may have had
a miserable life and the man who
survives a coronary thrombosis may
suffer severe limitation of his activity
for his remaining years.
T
HE United States Public
Health Services have given us a lot
more detailed information about the
effect of smoking in causing ill health,
apart from a fatal end result. Surveys
there show that the cigarette smoker
has twenty per cent more days of
sickness absence from work a year
than the non-smoker and the more he
smokes the greater the discrepancy.
We have no comparable figures for
Britain but we know that chronic
bronchitis causes a tenth of all Britain's
sickness absence from work each
year, and it seems highly probable that
the total loss of working time due to
smoking is at least of the order found
in the American enquiry.
The ill effects of cigarette smoking
are not just limited to older people.
An enquiry amongst schoolboys in'
Britain showed that those who smoked
suffered more from coughs and ill
health generally than those who
did not; it is easy to show that even
one cigarette produces at least a
short period of reduced respiratory
efficiency.
In those countries where the evil
effects of cigarette smoking have been
fully investigated there is by now
almost universal acceptance that the
ill effects are real. It probably isn't
true however that they are fully
understood. Except in Italy, cigarettes
are still advertised widely. Most
of the advertisements are cleverly
designed to display smoking as an
adult activity helping in social contacts,
even associated with virility and, in
every way, a social benefit.
Advertising experts are certain to
use those arguments that they
think are most persuasive with the
group that needs to be persuaded.
Since adults who already smoke are
likely to go on, it is young people
who most need persuasion. Conse¬
quently, almost all the advertisements
one sees are much more likely to
attract the young than the old.

CIGARETTES AND CANCER (Continued)
'Cigarette smoking responsible for a tenth of all deaths in Britain'
More than half of the American men,
and probably three fifths of British
men, smoke cigarettes. Every one
who does acts as a persuader of the
non-smoker just as every parent,
schoolteacher or favourite athlete who
smokes In public influences young
people, however unconsciously.
It has been shown that parents and
schoolteachers have a great Influence
in inculcating the habit in children.
That sort of example leads young boys
to smoke as a way of demonstrating
they are grown up, especially if
smoking is prohibited for them. Alto¬
gether, in most of the countries with
a high level of social organization and
a high standard of living, smoking is
the norm and it is the non-smoker
who is unusual.
Yet some groups especially
conscious of the ill effects have
clearly responded to the facts. In
Britain nearly two-thirds of doctors
used to smoke cigarettes, now less
than one-third do, in the United States
not much more than a fifth. British
doctors may have started reducing
their smoking earlier; they certainly
benefited from it more than their
fellow citizens because in the period
when the lung cancer death rate went
up by 25 per cent it fell among doctors
by 30 per cent. That was just the
period when the proportion of doctors
smoking was sharply reduced.
w
12
ITH all this evidence, the
reasonable man may well ask why
anyone goes on smoking cigarettes.
Especially why do they go on when,
on present evidence, if they must
smoke, a pipe or cigar is so much less
dangerous. To understand that, one
has to look at the reasons why people
smoke.
Few people like smoking imme¬
diately and yet they will go on until
they do get the pleasurable effects.
In a society where smoking is the
rule and non-smoking the exception,
one can well understand the adoles¬
cent persevering with something that
makes him appear an adult. There is
also a strong urge to conform to his
contemporaries and, nowadays, an
equally strong urge for girls to copy
the males of the same generation.
For most young people there is
little to deter them except the cost,
and few of the arguments against
smoking are ever put with anything
like the force, repetition or continuity
of the pressure in favour of smoking.
The threat of an earlier death, at what
then seems a remote age, simply
doesn't concern them.
Everyone knows that only a minority,
of smokers suffer lethal consequences
and that kind of threat could hardly
be expected to have any effect at all
on the very young. What few of them
realize is that cigarette smoking brings
an almost certainly greater frequency
of illness even from the earliest age
and a loss of physical capacity in
some degree.
One British study of attitudes
towards smoking shows that about
half the smokers habitually use ciga¬
rettes in some social situations rather
than because of any craving for them.
These are the people who like to
smoke, and who use the cigarette to
ease their position by conformity with
the behaviour of the group; it has
become a habit in certain situations
in order to have something to do, to
have something in the mouth or just
to relax.
These are the people who are
habit smokers. They are not driven
by the necessity that affects some
addicted smokers and they could
probably stop quite easily if they were
really convinced that it was worth the
inconvenience of unlearning the habit.
There is temporary strain on the
individual in changing his pattern of
" Tobacco is not a direct
cause of lung cancer, but the
habit of smoking contributes to
the development of pre-can-
cerous . conditions and subse¬
quently of malignant tumours.
Cigarettes are also an aggravating
factor in cardiovascular illnesses,
which are the commonest cause
of death in a great many coun¬
tries. To go back to lung cancer
associated with the use of toba¬
cco, we combat it in the
U.S.S.R., as in other countries,
with a vast propaganda cam¬
paign against cigarettes. We are
also trying to eliminate other
cancer-producing agents from
man's environment."

behaviour and probably half the
smokers simply won't face that.
The other half are really much more
dependent upon smoking and fre¬
quently these are just the people who
know that they should stop. Very
often they have tried and failed; in a
society predominantly of smokers
everything is against them because it
simply isn't possible to get away from
the things that might stimulate them to
start again. Others smoking, ashtrays
and an ample supply of cigarettes
deepen their own feelings about de¬
privation in addition to exposure to
advertisement on every hand. Some
people call this addiction, some habi¬
tuation, but it doesn't really matter
what we call it if the man who has this
feeling about smoking simply cannot
break away.
I
F this rough division is
right, and half the smokers could stop
if they were really persuaded, perhaps
we need most of all to work on this
group. We need to get the message
across to them that there are enormous
benefits to be had in terms of then-
own health, and that of the health of
their children or pupils, who would
no longer have the example of a
smoking parent or teacher. There are
even economic benefits, since, in
Britain, the cost of buying 20 cigarettes
a day could feed a member of the
family.
Perhaps our society hasn't faced
the brutal truth that we really want to
get rid of the cigarette. With so much
involved in commerce and agriculture
and so much government Income from
taxation, it isn't surprising that the
voice of reason opposing cigarette
smoking is indeed a still, small voice
in a babble of advertising and social
behaviour, all encouraging use of the
cigarette.
Some things have been done to
change this pattern. In Britain, ciga¬
rette advertising has been withdrawn
from commercial television. In Italy,
advertising of cigarettes has been
stopped altogether. In Norway, the
depiction of smoking in television
programmes has been materially
reduced. In the United States, tele¬
vision programmes that carry advertis¬
ing for cigarettes have to provide
opportunity for the counter arguments
and a lot of useful film material has
been produced there and in Canada
for just that purpose.

If you feel you can't stop smoking cigarettes and
want to cut down,
remember it's the
last third of the
cigarette that does
the most damage
The first few draws on a cigarette are relatively harmless
since most of the tar and nicotine is absorbed
by the tobacco and filter.
Soon, nicotine and other chemicals start to irritate
and coat the delicate tubes of the lungs with an oily tar,
forcing them to produce a thick phlegm. The mixture
of tar and phlegm slithers deep into the lungs where
it congeals and festers.
Tobacco smoke now being inhaled is so saturated
with nicotine and chemicals that it coats lungs
with more liquid tar, causes more irritation and produces
more phlegm than the other two parts of
the cigarette put together.

Some progress has been made. At
least a million fewer people are
smoking in Britain; in the United States
the consumption of cigarettes per head
is just beginning to fall. But nothing
has been achieved so far to seriously
affect the mortality and morbidity
statistics with which this article-began.
Somehow we have to do much more
and, if we could get the public to
realize what the benefits would be,
perhaps we would get it done much
sooner.
If cigarette smoking could be
stopped there would be some imme¬
diate benefit for the smoker and even
more for the adolescent who was
prevented from starting. Cough and
bronchitis would certainly be reduced.
The occurrence of coronary thrombosis
in middle age, and especially sudden
death in young men from this cause
would begin to go down and the
patient who already had bronchitis
would cease to deteriorate so rapidly.
Even the risk of lung cancer would
begin to fall away. The man who has
beeh smoking for twenty years is
already at substantially greater risk of
lung cancer than his contemporary
who hasn't but, as soon as he stops
smoking, that risk ceases to rise with
age as it would otherwise do. If he
maintains his resolution not to smoke,
in perhaps twenty years or at
most twenty-five he will be at no
greater risk than his non smoking
contemporary.
Cigarette smoking is responsible for
about a tenth of all deaths in Britain
each year. If everyone stopped ciga¬
rette smoking they would still have to
die sometime, but the chance that
death would be premature would be
much less and sickness absence from
work might come down by as much
as a fifth.
There is no other single avoidable
cause of so much premature death
and disability in Britain today as the
smoking of cigarettes. There is no
greater benefit that could be conferred
on the health of its people than the
abolition of cigarette smoking and that
must be true of every other country
with as long and as heavy a history of
using the cigarette.

Anti-smoking campaigns are

Restrictions on advertising of

The case
against smoking
T
WO years ago, at the
opening of the World Conference on
Smoking and Health in New York City,
the former Surgeon-General of the
United States Public Health Service,
Dr. Luther Terry, set the scene by
saying "We have come to the end of
one era in the smoking and health
field. The period of uncertainty is
over. While science will continue to
probe the reason why, there is no
longer any doubt that cigarette smok¬
ing is a direct threat to the user's
health."
If this statement was true in 1967,
how much more obviously is it true
today. On all sides, the evidence
accumulates which points to the
smoking of cigarettes as one of the
greatest of health problems: the risks
of developing cancers of the lung,
mouth and larynx and oesophagus are
greater in those who smoke; death
and disability resulting from chronic
bronchitis, pulmonary emphysema and
from coronary artery disease lie in
wait for the nicotine addict.
In Canada, a country with a popula¬
tion of 20,000,000, it has been esti¬
mated that there are almost
18,000 excess deaths each year caused
by lung cancer, heart disease and
chronic chest disease.
The statistics describing the toll due
to smoking have been used in an
arresting fashion by Cuyler Hammond
who has estimated that while 78 per
cent of non-smoking males age 25 will
live to the age of 65 or greater, this
proportion drops to 54 per cent for
those who smoke 40 or more ciga¬
rettes per day.
Another result is that for the first
time ' in this century . . . the life

expectancy of the male population is
decreasing rather than increasing.
The public has heard about the
hazards associated with smoking.
In a poll of public opinion about cancer
which was carried out in 1967 among
Canadian men, it was found that 82 per
cent of. non-smokers and 73 per cent
of smokers thought smoking was inju¬
rious to health. In the face of this
knowledge, how is it that the consump¬
tion of cigarettes has not fallen.
There are many answers to this
question. The first is that the tobacco
industry has employed and is con¬
tinuing to employ every possible means
to cast doubt on the evidence
which has incriminated its product.
It goes even farther by denying that
any hazard exists, and It is backing
its position with an advertising
campaign which in the Western World
counts for an annual expenditure of
hundreds of millions of dollars.
But this is not all. As handmaidens
to the industry are the fatalism of the
addict, the apathy of the public and
too often the indifference 'or hostility
of responsible members of govern¬
ments who are reluctant to face the
loss of income from the tax on the
sale of tobacco and especially ciga¬
rettes, an income which comprises a
significant portion of the total.
So those who would seek to
counter these forces face great obsta¬
cles and must be prepared to fight a
long battle; and we must be patient
as well as persistent for it will not be
in our interest to enter this controversy
unless we are resolved to use our
intelligence and to keep our emotions
in check no matter how great the
temptation to let them go.
An outstanding educationist in
referring to controversy has said
that controversy is to be carefully
distinguished from the bilious invective
or the crude personalities to which
the term is erroneously applied. Anger
produces little except vituperation
and bombast but controversy can be
sharp . and pointed; it demands
toughness and resilience of mind.
How should this toughness and
resilience of mind be applied? I should
point out that what I am about to
recommend might be described as
the idealized . approach, that I am
perfectly well aware that in some
countries one or more of these pro¬
posals have been implemented, and
I am equally aware that in others
some aspects of the programme may
be impracticable.
Each country must decide for itself
the form of approach which will be
suited to deal with the problem, but
Photo WHO
those of us who are in a position to
create or influence public opinion must
still strive to enlist a total effort a
community-wide approach.
The first and, in my opinion, the most
important requirement is that each of
us accept the role of an exemplar.
Unless each of us is prepared to
abandon the habit of smoking we can
scarcely expect results in our effort
to convince others of the hazard.
I make this point with all the fervour
and conviction of an ex-smoker of
13 years standing.
While the need to set an example
is important for all who embark on
the campaign, it assumes even greater
importance for those persons such as
physical health educators, teachers,
nurses and physicians who are
assumed to be more knowledgeable
about matters of health than the
general public.
I confess to you that it is difficult
for me to understand how the pros¬
pects for cancer control can be
discussed in an effective way through
a cloud of cigarette smoke, and I doubt
that the vision of the future can be
seen under such circumstances. The

CASE AGAINST SMOKING (Continued)
It's never too late to quit!

heading of education. There has been
much speculation as to whether it is
more important to educate the adults
or the children. Those who favour
the approach to adults claim that
unless one persuades them to give up
smoking, the programme directed to
the children will fail, and those whose
targets are the children, claim that we
must tackle the habit at the age when
it is first taken up.
The truth is that the programme
must be aimed at the members of
both groups. With films and filmstrips,
health talks and posters the young
must be persuaded that they should
not take up the habit, that it is no
longer the smart thing, that it is not
a sign of maturity.
At the same time, we must deliver
the message to the adults and we
must be prepared to back this up with
offers of help in the form of withdrawal
clinics for those who, having decided
to give up the habit, need help and
encouragement.
Perhaps one of the most telling
arguments that one can use with
parents is to point out that the children
of parents who smoke are more likely
to take up the habit, that the habit of
smoking reduces the life expectancy
by about 8 years and that therefore
the adults who are parents and who
continue to smoke are threatening
their own children with the reduction
of life expectancy.
I would like to make four suggestions
about the features of the education
programme. These may be described
as the four "e's": encouragement,
enlargement, enlistment and evalua¬
tion. Since these are earnest sug¬
gestions, I should perhaps refer to
them as the four entreaties. '
By encouragement, I mean" that in
our approach to adults, we should
underline the benefits that can result
from giving up smoking, and we
should promote the idea that it is
never too late to quit. I fear that in
our enthusiasm to persuade, we have
too often yielded to the temptation of
depicting the evil results of smoking
and of doing so in such a fashion as to
arouse fear.
It has been shown by a number of
authorities, and has been re-empha¬
sized more recently by John Wake¬
field, chairman of the Committee on
Public Education of the International
Union Against Cancer, that fear is not
the most effective means of changing
behaviour. To quote J.A.C. Brown, "the
more frightened people become of the
consequences of an action, the more
they may be impelled to continue it."
By enlargement, I mean that we
should incorporate in our educational
approach the point of view, that
although we are concerned with
smoking primarily because it is a
source of cancer, it is a cause of
death and disability and human misery
in a number of other ways. The prob¬
lem of smoking has many facets and
demands a multi-faceted approach.
It is because of this fact that I use
the term enlistment, and by this I refer
to the importance of enlisting the
co-operation and activities of other
agencies both governmental and non¬
governmental. The best illustration of
this form of activity with which I am
familiar is the National Interagency
Council on Smoking and Health in the
United States.
Although I am less familiar with
others, it appears to me that equivalent
action has been taken in a number
of countries in different ways. To
name only two, I understand that in
Austria, the Federal Ministry for Social
Administration is assisted in pro¬
grammes about smoking by other
ministries and by such voluntary
agencies as the Austrian Cancer
Society; and that in Denmark, the
Minister of the Interior has appointed
a commission, known locally as the
Cigarette Commission, representative
of government and voluntary agencies
including the Danish Cancer Society.
I suggest that in those countries
where such collaboration does not
exist, the cancer agencies take the
initiative in bringing this about.
And the final "e" is evaluation. Too
often the wrong, or at least the less
important, statistics are used in des¬
cribing an educational programme.
These are the numbers of lectures and
radio talks, the numbers of films and
filmstrips distributed, the numbers of
pamphlets produced and so forth.
w
HAT is important and what
should be done if we hope to make
significant progress is to determine
what was accomplished by the effort
and this means that we must have a
clear definition of the objective. Was
it to inform or was it to change
behaviour, or both?
To measure what was accomplished,
it is necessary to carry out periodic
surveys of the target population and
one must ask the right questions. Let
me assure those that have not yet
participated in such analyses that they
will be in for some surprises.
That film which you thought was
superb may turn out to have had the
opposite effect to that which was
intended. That pamphlet which set out
the dangers so clearly may have been
more effective in arousing fear than
in causing changes of behaviour.
And now, finally, what about the
tobacco industry and its activities? It
may be assumed that the industry will
never institute meaningful controls of
the hazards of smoking and will never
initiate action to reduce the number
of those who smoke.
It may be assumed that the industry
is in fact contemptuous of the public
and that its actions now and in the
future will be motivated only by the
search for profit. Under these circum¬
stances, the cancer control agencies
have important roles to play in arousing
public interest in control measures.
The first target must be the
advertising campaign. Mr. Emerson
Foote, formerly a senior member of
the advertising world and a past-
chairman of the National Interagency
Council on Smoking and Health, once
wrote a letter to the late Robert F. Ken¬
nedy in which he said, "Television
advertising encourages people to
smoke cigarettes. Cigarettes kill
people. It is not morally justifiable to
encourage people to kill themselves.
Therefore, cigarette advertising on
television should be banned."
In a similar but less dramatic vein,
the Task Force for Smoking and
Health in the United States has said
"the Task Force is unable to see how
in the long run a product involving the
health hazards of cigarettes can
continue to be advertised."
I subscribe to the points of view
expressed in these statements. The
fact that significant steps have been
taken against the advertising of
tobacco in Czechoslovakia, Denmark,
England, France, Ireland, Italy, Norway,
Sweden and Switzerland should give
heart to the rest of us.
A desirable adjunct to controls on
advertising is the labelling of cigarette
packages with a clear warning about
health hazards.
An ironic situation which exists in
Canada and which may also exist
elsewhere is that the Federal Govern¬
ment which is collecting $350,000,000
in taxes on tobacco and spending less
than $350,000 per year on programmes
directed against smoking has provided
millions of dollars in subsidies to the
tobacco-growing industry. The Cana¬
dian Cancer Society is joining with
other agencies in an effort to bring
this support to a conclusion.
Other steps which are desirable and
which are being taken to reduce the
hazards of smoking include restrictions
on the sale of cigarettes to children
and the banning of smoking in public
places and in places of work.
I would like to conclude on a note
of hope. I feel that the climate of
public opinion is changing, that the
demand for more positive action on
the part of government is growing,
that the social acceptability of ciga¬
rette smoking is diminishing and that
the idea is taking shape in the minds of
more and more persons that it Is
not necessary to smoke to appear
grown up, and that it is necessary
not to smoke to remain healthy.

SECRET OF THE CELL (Continued Irom page 17)
Seeking the key to the mystery of life
equipped cancer research laboratory
has an impressive array of instruments
and equipment to work with. In cen¬
trifuges that spin at ever greater
speeds, molecules, complex and fra¬
gile, are separated from biological
extracts. With automated, high preci¬
sion radiation counters, researchers
trace the movement of minute quan¬
tities of radioactive substances through
a complex molecular maze of cells or
tissues. And these are but two among
a thousand other examples of the
direct application of modern techno¬
logy.
Machines such as these are usually
run on tight schedules since there is
nearly always a waiting list of would-be
users, and scientists often have to
wait several days before their turn
comes to have access to them. Thus,
any mechanical or electronic improve¬
ment that reduces the time taken by a
machine to carry out a particular mea¬
surement or calculation represents
very real progress indeed, and such
improvements are constantly being
made by the rapidly developing indus¬
tries of today.
All this points not only to the fact
that research in an ultra-modern
laboratory is an expensive operation,
but also how difficult it is to pinpoint
neatly and precisely the field covered
by cancer research.
T.
he same is true of tradi¬
tional disciplines such as physiology,
genetics, biochemistry or pharmaco¬
logy whose boundaries are now well-
nigh Impossible to define. Thus, the
work of researchers in biology tends
to be increasingly concerned with the
particular level of organization in the
material they study: molecules, struc¬
tures forming part of the internal
anatomy and physiology of the cell,
membranes, isolated cells, cellular
aggregates or organs, populations
within the same bacterial, animal or
vegetable species, and, finally, ecolo¬
gical systems, with regard to which
one could speak of populations of
populations.
Exchange of facts and findings is
simplified for biologists working at a
similar level of organization, whether
their work is concerned with bacteria,
plants, animals or man. Before even
attempting to revise the classification
of the traditional disciplines, the
changes in the areas where fruitful
dialogue is at present possible should
be noted.
A brief description of one of the
fundamental problems of cancerology
the reproduction mechanisms of the
cells of an organism provides an
example of this overlapping between
the various branches of the biological
sciences. This problem of cell
reproduction leads on directly to the
question of the existence and nature
of factors which may have a controlling
function.
As is now known, the chemical
substance, desoxy-ribonucleic acid
(DNA) contains the code which
determines the hereditary character¬
istics not only of the organism as a
whole, but also of each of its in¬
numerable cells. DNA is contained in
the chromosomes of the cell nucleus,
and according to recent scientific
findings, it seems not to be subject
to any type of metabolic regeneration
or turnover, whereas the other types
of molecules contained in a cell are
constantly being replaced by new ones
at speeds which may be specific for
each type.
The reproduction of this "huge"
molecule (which includes about
5 million elements of information in
mammals) is therefore an essential
preliminary to any cellular division
because each cell of the organism is
known to contain a constant quantity
of DNA.
This idea of constancy is essential.
It corresponds to the fact that the
chromosome construction is practically
the same for all the cells of an
organism and for all the members of
a given species. The number and
appearance of the chromosomes de¬
fines what is called a "karyotype"
which in certain cases makes it
possible to identify differences
between living species which would
be considerably more difficult to
define by other criteria.
At the molecular level, the repro¬
duction of DNA is effected by a so-
called "semi-conservative" mechanism
(by the synthesis of a new element
superimposed on a pre-existing one),
which has been demonstrated in
bacteria and, more recently, in viruses.
This method of reproduction has
been established only at the chromo¬
some level in the case of multicellular
organisms. Such a mechanism ex¬
plains why the distribution of DNA, in
each of the two daughter-cells result¬
ing from a division, is quantitatively
and qualitatively equal (see photo
page 21).
The period between two successive
cellular divisions the interphase is
therefore by no means one of
"cellular inactivity". Vital processes
take place: the preparation for the
synthesis of DNA, the synthesis itself,
that is, the reproduction of the DNA
molecule, and the preparation for
cellular division.
Experimental research shows that
once the synthesis of DNA has begun
it becomes relatively difficult to
interrupt the chain of processes
leading to cellular division. It is as if
a critical threshold or point of no
return existed, which must be located
shortly before the start of the DNA
synthesis.
This explains why the mechanisms
which may help to trigger off the
synthesis are now being studied. In
the case of multicellular organisms,
neither the existence nor, obviously,
the nature of the precise factors
involved in this sparking-off process
are yet known.
Thus, it is obvious why all aspects
of cellular proliferation, both in normal
tissues and in malignant tumours, are
now being carefully studied. We have,
in fact, to find a way of determining
the mechanisms which control cellular
multiplication itself.
ethods available to re¬
searchers have made great progress
in the last few years, although one very
important factor concerning them needs
to be taken into account. Broadly
speaking, the simplest model, that of
a system in which all the cells double
in number (therefore showing an
exponential increase) applies for
practical purposes only to bacteria and
to cells isolated from their parent
organism and grown in laboratories.
The most elementary parameter that
can be observed in such a system the
time required for its numerical doubl¬
ing cannot be applied to organs still
functioning in the body. In their case,
apart from the phenomena of growth
and aging, an equilibrium in the
number of cells is constantly maintain¬
ed under normal circumstances, and
there can be no measurable doubling
time.
One classic experimental example
is the regeneration of the liver after
the surgical or toxic destruction of a
major part of hepatic tissues. Nor¬
mally the liver changes very little
during adult life. The total number
of hepatic cells remains approximat¬
ely constant and only a few cells are
replaced. Consequently, in sections
of normal adult liver, one sees only
one cell in around 20,000 which is in
the process of dividing.
If a part of the liver, of a rat for
example, is destroyed, an enormous
number of cellular divisions appear,
resulting in a tendency to restore the
organ to something like its original
volume. . This wave of divisions is
preceded by a wave of DNA synthesis,
itself preceded by a wave of synthesis
of other molecules essential to cellular
function, including ribonucleic acids,
enzymes and other proteins. The
cellular proliferation Is specific, that is
to say that the cells thus produced
are liver cells and not those of another
organ.
On the other hand, the proliferation
"knows" when to stop, which means

This photograph reveals the astounding
process by which nature transmits the
inherited, characteristics of all living
creatures from cell to cell. Here, a cell
in human bone marrow has divided into
two "daughter" cells, each of which has
been given an identical number of
molecules of DNA, the chemical substance
whose code determines heredity
(molecules are seen as black dots
through "tagging" with a radioactive
substance). Scientists are beginning to
break the DNA code. A complete
understanding of the nature of the code
and the methods for controlling the
release of information from the code will
make it possible to control cancer.
that it does not go beyond certain
limits. But the special point is the
idea of a "decision" which initiates
this cycle of cell multiplication, a
"decision" the nature of which is
unknown, since we do not even
know whether it involves a true
stimulus or the removal. of an inhibition.
Here again we find the idea
of initiation of the DNA synthesis
referred to above, since, before the
lesion, practically all the liver cells
contain an amount of DNA which is
the same from one cell to another
and equal to the value which
characterizes the cells before synthesis
begins.
This process of synthesis results in
an exact doubling of this quantity of
DNA, because two cells have to be
produced from a single cell. In this
example, the different stages of the
reaction to the lesion are the principal
points of investigation by researchers
in this field.
Jn addition' to various increasingly
refined biochemical techniques, possi¬
bilities of examining the ultra-structures
at the extraordinary magnifications
within the capability of modern
electronic microscopes, and our grow¬
ing knowledge in microbiology and
virology, a new and fruitful method of
investigation has, in the past few years,
assisted the study of the physiology of
cells grouped in the organs or tissues
of multi-cellular species.
DNA, the " molecule of which is
doubled at the time of the synthesis
which precedes a cellular division, and
only then, can be tagged by a
precursor which is then involved
in everything which subsequently
happens to the DNA molecule.
The heavy isotope of hydrogen,
called tritium, can be used as a
marker for this precursor. Thanks to
the radiation it emits, it can be followed
at the structural level of individual
cells by the process of auto-radio¬
graphy.
Such studies, which have been
dubbed "cellular biographies", con¬
sequently allow the comparison of the
mode of cell reproduction in normal
tissues with that of disturbed prolifera¬
tion in, for example, a malignant
tumour, and will perhaps lead to the
discovery of some of the causes of
the breakdown of the normal equili¬
brium.'
B
ut this striking example
should not cause us to overlook seve¬
ral other lines of research which are
also under active development in many
laboratories. Among these, the study
of chromosomal abnormalities in the
cells of patients with malignant
diseases has not, properly speaking,
shown up changes which are perma¬
nent and exclusively related to the
malignancy.
There is an exception to this
rule, that of chronic myeloid leukae¬
mia in Man, . in which the total
number of chromosomes is normal but
chromosome 21 (one of the smallest)
is structurally abnormal: one of the
long arms is absent (Philadelphia
chromosome). We do not yet know
very much about the relationships
between this anomaly and the mech¬
anisms which initiate leukaemia in
particular whether this anomaly is a
predisposing factor, an effect, or a
cause.
The study of metabolic anomalies in
tumour cells has made much headway
from the discovery of the so-called
"minimal deviation" tumours, which
permit the establishment of valid
comparisons between normal and
abnormal cells.
A special enzyme, asparagine-
synthetase, which acts as a synthetizer
of an amino acid, an essential
component of cell physiology, may be
absent from some cells of tumour
origin. This discovery will perhaps
lead to the development of a specific
treatment by the administration of
asparaginase, with the object of inter¬
fering with the supply of asparagine
coming from normal cells. This
procedure could then be directed
towards the selective destruction of
tumour cells which cannot themselves
produce asparagine, one of the subs¬
tances vital to them.
The changes in the cellular surfaces
of cells of tumour origin are also being
very actively studied. One of these
changes the loss of contact inhibi¬
tion is very important. That is to
say, the normal tissues which surround
the tumour cells no longer inhibit their
movements, this inhibition being
normally effected through simple
contact.
This loss of contact inhibition
is accompanied by a tendency
on the part of the tumour cells to
invade or infiltrate neighbouring normal
tissues. The electrical charges of this
membrane have been studied, but the
problem has not been solved.
Additional factors may intervene, as
for instance the secretion of lytic
enzymes, that is to say enzymes which
destroy the cells, of toxins, inflamma¬
tion phenomena, and finally problems
related to the expansion of the mass
of tumour cells, i.e. the pressure
exerted by the tumour on neighbouring
tissues.
The appearance of specific antigens
in tumours was demonstrated as early
as 1953, by the U.S. microbiologist,
Edward Foley. If tumours in mice,
induced by the carcinogenic che¬
mical substance methylcholantrene,
are surgically removed, the .mice are
found to be resistant to later grafts of
the same tumour. Specific antigens
have since been discovered in animals,
for a large number of tumours, whether
of chemical, viral, or spontaneous
origin.
Attempts have been made to
relate these findings to certain clinical
observations, as for instance the
apparently spontaneous regression of
tumours; the great length of the latent
period, on occasion, in the develop¬
ment of cancers; the regression of
metastases [cancerous growths which
have spread from one part of the body
to another] after surgical excision of
the primary tumour; and finally the
fact that the majority of the cells which
separate from the primary tumour
disappear without giving rise' to meta¬
static growths.
We cannot at present analyse pre- £ |
cisely the real rôle of these im¬
munological factors in human beings,
since the experimental methods based

on tissue exchanges between selected,
genetically pure breeds of mice cannot
be used in research on humans. But
the possibilities of practical trials on
Man are being studied. These would
be designed to measure directly the
power to destroy tumour cells
possessed by the immunological
defence cells responsible for this type
of reaction.
This is an extremely important area
of research, for the possibility of using
immunological means of attack, of
perhaps increasing the organism's
natural defence mechanisms, is one of
the great hopes of those who think
that new treatment methods can be
found in this direction.
The study of the rôle of viruses in
the production of cancers is certainly
one of the major problems of current
research. Although a special form of
malignant disease fowl leukosis has
been attributed to viral infection for
more than fifty years, it is only in
recent years that the major develop¬
ment of virological research on cancer
has occurred.
A number of cancers in a wide
variety of animal species are today
recognized as clearly attributable to
viruses. The properties of the viruses
in question and their possible mode of
action are being very intensively
studied.
In fact, while it may not be
possible at present to give a
precise reply to the question "Are
human cancers caused by viruses?,"
animal experimentation is continually
providing data which will give us a
clearer conception of the mode of
interaction between the genetic
material of the virus and that of the
cell or cells Infected by it.
T
wo stages need to be
distinguished in viral infection. As
defined by André Lwoff, Nobel Prize¬
winner for Biology in 1965, they are
the introduction of genetic material
inside a cell the entry proper,
governed by surface phenomena, the
envelope of the virus, the surface of
the cell and the consequences of the
presence of the virus inside the cell,
which bring different processes into
play.
These consequences are therefore
at present being analysed in the light
of the most significant biological
concepts recently acquired, i.e. the
mechanisms by which living matter
preserves a genetic memory, how this
is transmitted to the cells resulting
from a cellular division, and how
finally the Information is transmitted to
the cell as a whole and translated to
play its part in a specific function.
In addition, the problems of virology
and those of immunology are related,
more particularly through the common
hope of developing means of treatment
by immunotherapy.' In this connexion,
the discovery of a new type of tumour
Burkitt's tumour which is a special
type of malignant tumour of the jaw
found in children in tropical Africa,
goes back only a few years and a
number of arguments suggest a viral
origin.
The relationships observed between
immunity to a herpes-type virus and
the incidence of these Burkitt's
tumours and even certain cancers of
the naso-pharynx may perhaps open
up new approaches to this important
question.
The above are a number of examples
of focal points of current cancer
research. They represent merely an
arbitrary choice from among a great
many others, but the important lesson
to be learnt is that, as far as each of
these examples, and indeed our
overall understanding of the problem,
is concerned, our basic knowledge has
not as yet given us a general key
such as other branches of science
possess.
This means, on the one hand,
that basic research should be
still more actively pursued in an
attempt to find what we may justifiably
imagine to be such a key; on the other,
that current methods of treating
malignant diseases in human beings,
are inevitably affected from the outset,
by the consequences of this imper¬
fection of our basic knowledge.
This does not by any means imply
that present-day methods of treatment
are ineffective. On the contrary, all
the well-tried methods are continually
being improved and new ones are
being rapidly developed.
As regards methods of treatment by
radiation, by surgery, or by chemo¬
therapy, statistical data show un¬
deniable progress in terms of good
therapeutic results, and even specta¬
cular successes in certain cases.
The importance of early detection
in improving the chances of effective
therapy cannot be over-emphasized.
Progress has been made with regard
to such detection, but doctors and
nurses are not the only ones who
have a responsibility in this respect.
Each individual has at least an equal
responsibility to undergo systematic
examination at regular intervals, or at
the appearance of any of the dis¬
quieting symptoms which each of us
should be able to recognize easily.
Public authorities have a clear and
even over-riding responsibility to
make facilities for proper examination
available to the public, i.e. to set up
detection centres and to equip them
completely for this kind of work.
These considerations are equally
valid for a final but essential problem:
cancer prevention. In this area, mass
measures are likely to prove not only
the most effective, but also the most
urgent.
Artificial food additives, indeed the
whole food supply, should be super¬
vised and measures taken to reduce
tobacco consumption. Steps to
reduce pollution of the human environ¬
ment, particularly by chemical or radio¬
active substances, should also be
given priority.
Chromosomes, the structures contained within the nucleus of every living cell by
which genetic Information is transmitted, are currently the subject of intense
research. Observation of cells taken from a leukaemia patient reveals the presence
of an abnormal chromosome. Right, photographs of chromosomes, taken by
an electronic microscope, are cut out and assembled in pairs for comparison.

A false notion
cancer = incurable

HOSE of us who are
concerned every day with the clinical
care of patients with cancer are often
asked why we are so obsessed with
early diagnosis. The reason is that
every day of every week we are faced
with the patient whose malignant
tumour is no longer amenable to cura¬
tive treatment, though that same
patient could have been cured by
readily available and well-tested
methods of treatment if only he
had reached hospital when the tumour
was less extensive.
Commonly accepted five-year sur¬
vival rates following appropriate treat¬
ment for a number of common cancers
show that the early localized tumour
is readily controllable, but when the
cancer has become more extensive
cure is virtually impossible.
In the field of tumour pathology it
Is axiomatic that with the passage of
time a malignant tumour grows larger.
It is equally axiomatic that the risk of
widespread metastasis [the establish¬
ment of secondary tumours in other
parts of the body] also increases with
the passage of time.
Though it is undoubtedly true that a
very small proportion of tumours have
a capacity for widespread metastasis
whilst the primary tumour still remains
relatively small, in the majority of cases
this prognostically unfavourable situa¬
tion is a late development in the natural
history of the tumour.
The very wide difference In the
response to treatment is such that
even a modest reduction in the time-
interval between the patient's first
symptom and effective treatment could
not fail to create substantially better

CANCER IS CURABLE (Continued)
Early detection saves lives
tive-year survival rates. Indeed, a
modest shortening of this delay period
and consequently diminished extent of
disease would doubtless save more
lives, more quickly, than any foresee¬
able advances in fundamental research.
Nevertheless, there are still those
who adopt the attitude that cancer is
inevitably fatal and that earlier treat¬
ment only increases the time interval
between death and the date of treat¬
ment. Though it may have been difficult
to refute this plausible armchair philo¬
sophy when the only yardstick of
treatment was the five-year or ten-year
survival rate, it is now possible to
define cure in statistically valid terms.
We can speak of cure of cancer when,
some years after treatment, there
remains a group of patients whose
annual death rate from all causes is
similar to that of a normal population
group of the same sex and age dis¬
tribution.
In the case of cancer of the larynx,
at about four years after treatment (in
this case by X-Rays) the two survival
curves begin to run parallel to one
another. In other words, from about
the fourth after-treatment year the
surviving cancer patients are dying
of the same general causes and
at the same rate as members of the
general population around them of the
same sex and age. Today we can
claim that for early cancer of the
larynx some 80 per cent are entirely
curable. 	
As a second example cancer of
the uterine cervix the survival curve
for cancer patients begins to run
parallel to that of the normal popula¬
tion (in this case, of course, all women)
about six years after treatment. Cure
for early cervical cancer today can
be expected in some 75 per cent of
patients.
Even with Hodgkin's disease [in
which the lymph glands become
enlarged], for many decades regarded
as incurable, we can now see that
under favourable circumstances more
than 40 per cent are alive and well ten
years after treatment with a calculably
normal expectation of life.
Cancer of the breast has been
described as incurable by a number of
sceptics over the years and again only
recently in some British medical jour¬
nals. Survival curves, however, show
that from the 12th year onwards the
expectation of life of a woman treated
for early breast cancer is identical to
that of a normal woman of the same
age. The definitive cure rate for this
series of patients with localised breast
cancer is, in fact, 52 per cent.
Some of the patients in this series,
however, had substantial tumours
measuring 5 to 10 cms in diameter
though still conforming to our defi¬
nition of stage I cancer. Considerable
improvement in this situation should
therefore not be difficult and tumours
of more modest dimensions might well
be as curable as cervical or laryngeal
cancers. Curability not simple sur¬
vival is influenced by the extent of
the tumour at the time of treatment.
In short, time is the vital factor in
curability.
It is fair to ask, however, whether
early diagnosis is possible with all
types- of malignant tumours. The short
answer to this is "No."
Where the site of the tumour is
favourable including those to which
I have already referred early diagno¬
sis is undoubtedly possible, because
of a palpable lump, visible ulceration,
or some clamant symptom such as
hoarseness in laryngeal cancers or
bleeding with cancer of the uterine
1,500,000 AMERICANS CURED OF CANCER
I here are more than 20,000,000 ex-smokers in the
United States today. Among these are 100,000 physicians,
or half of all members of the medical profession in the U.S.A.
who ever smoked cigarettes.
Uterine cancer was once the leading cancer killer of
American women. In 1935, the death rate per 100,000 women
was 26.8; as a result of unremitting educational efforts and
great improvements in detection and treatment it is now down
to about 11 per 100,000.
Both these achievements are in large part due to the
efforts of the American Cancer Society. Yet when it was
founded in 1913, under its earlier name of the American
Society for the Control of Cancer, by a group of 10 physicians
and 5 laymen, for the purpose of "educating the public at
large in the absolute necessity of treatment at the first sign
of cancerous growth," the word "cancer" had roughly the
same social acceptance as the word "syphilis." Mention of
cancer in polite society was taboo.
The Society's initial aim, therefore, was to inform both
doctors and the lay public. Doctors themselves were scep¬
tical about any possibility of curing the disease and the
general public viewed it through a cloud of superstitious fear
rooted in ignorance.
For some 30 years the education of both doctors and the
general public remained the essential goal of the Society.
In 1945, the Society was reorganized. It became The Ameri¬
can Cancer Society and instituted a national research pro¬
gramme, in which it had invested more than $200,000,000 up
to 1968, whilst retaining its educational function.
The Society also broadened the range of its volunteer
activity. Half the National Board of Directors are now
laymen and more than 3,000 local Cancer Society Units
have been established throughout the United States.
A broad communications approach is adopted to motivate
a population of over 200,000,000. It tries to reach people
where they live or work, where they study, worship or relax,
when they read newspapers, watch television, listen to radio
or go to meetings. It devotes much energy to encouraging
an immediate person-to-person approach; the advice of a
friend or acquaintance can play a vital role.
This approach is essentially optimistic and the message of
hope is bolstered by statistics. The use of factual stories
of cured patients has been an important element. Cured
Cancer Congresses make real the existence of more than
1,500,000 Americans who once had the disease and are
cured;
At the same time the Society enlists the support of all
physicians and helps them to keep their knowledge of cancer
up to date. Medical policies are candidly discussed and
debated at professional meetings sponsored by the Society
and there is a continuous effort to bring the latest thera¬
peutic advances to the attention of doctors.
The Society's 2,300,000 volunteers have a number of specific
achievements to their credit. For example, 68,000 volunteers
provided the manpower for a massive public health survey
in which over a million adults' medical histories were followed
over a period of 6 years. In 1969, volunteers raised over
$50,000,000 for the Society. Largely due to their propaganda
campaigns about two-thirds of American women over 21 have
taken the "Pap" test for cervical cancer at least once.
Progress against cancer has been slow but sure. In 1937,
the cure rate of cancer in the United States was one in five
cases; today it is one in three. This is the result of many
factors, but not the least is that the great majority of Americans
are now aware that, with treatment, the disease is curable
and take steps to protect themselves and their families.

cervix or the bladder. On the other
hand, early diagnosis of malignant
tumours in such sites as the lung, the
brain, the pancreas, the liver, etc., is
only very rarely realized. By the time
these tumours declare themselves
clinically they are too often, beyond
cure. How to improve this situation is
one of the pressing problems for
cancer research.
How can earlier diagnosis be
achieved? Efforts are needed in
three general fields: firstly, public
education; secondly, professional edu¬
cation ; and thirdly, the need to con¬
centrate on high risk groups.
Public education on cancer is not a
field for well-meaning amateurs. In a
study of patients' reasons for delay,
carried out in Manchester, England,
some 15 years ago, it became clear
that a patient with a lump in the breast
was more likely to suspect cancer (and
72 per cent did so) than patients with
other symptoms which were not
associated .in the patient's mind with
a potentially malignant cause (23 per
cent of cervix cancers and 15 per cent
of cancers of the mouth or skin).
Patients with troublesome bleeding
from the womb or an ulcer of the
mouth or skin tend to seek early advice
because of the nuisance of the
symptoms. The patient with a lump in
the breast, on the other hand, pro¬
crastinates in spite of her suspicions.
This delay is largely an expression
of fear coupled with a deep conviction
that, if cancer is diagnosed, no effec¬
tive treatment is possible. This pes
simism leads to delay and delay leads
to extension of the tumour with, as we
have seen, a- rapidly worsening prog¬
nosis.
This finding might lead to the
erroneous idea that to publicize, for
example, what have been called the
"Seven Danger Signals of Cancer,"
might lead to more delay and not less.
The important lesson learned here was
that an essential ingredient of any
public education programme must be
an Improvement of the image of cancer
and the dissemination of optimistic
attitudes to this disease. The public
at large must be given encouraging
information as to the prospects of cure.
There is no need for me to go into
details on how best to educate the
public about cancer, but clearly there
are some very wrong ways to go about
it. The International Union against
Cancer (U.I.C.C.) has established a
Committee on Public Education (un¬
der the chairmanship of John Wake¬
field) which for many years has been
concerned with the subtleties and prob¬
lems of education and has published
many reports on psychological, socio¬
economic and methodological research
in this field.
What, it may be asked, is the prob¬
able outcome of a consultation bet¬
ween a pessimistic patient and an
equally pessimistic physician? Exper¬
ience and carefully designed invest¬
igations have shown, unhappily, that
there is a very considerable degree of
pessimism about malignant disease
within the medical profession itself. I
have already mentioned the attitude
of some workers in this field who have
continued to express the view that
malignant disease is inevitably fatal.
Hodgkin's disease was long regarded
as fatal without any adequate evid¬
ence to support this pessimistic view.
Too many radiotherapists my own
field of work seem to regard radia¬
tion therapy as serving only a pallia¬
tive function in the management of
patients with malignant disease. Cur¬
ative treatment is regarded by many
throughout the world as a faint pos¬
sibility at best.
Pessimism within the nursing pro¬
fession is no less than in the medical
profession and, indeed, doctors and
nurses on the whole are probably
almost as pessimistic about cancer as
the general public. To try to correct
this unawareness of the favourable
aspects of malignant disease the
U.I.C.C. has a committee concerned
with Professional Education, under
the chairmanship of Professor Umberto
Veronesi.
In certain industrial processes,
groups of workers are know to have
been exposed to carcinogens of one
kind or another and are properly des¬
cribed as high risk groups. Another
typical high risk group are heavy
cigarette smokers who have a much
higher than normal risk of developing
cancer of the lung.
A high risk group may be confined
to one specific socio-economic group
of a community, and certain national
groups seem likewise to carry special

risks. The need to Identify high risk
groups in any population arises
from (1) the need for earlier diagnosis,
and (2) the limitations of the rather
coarse physical methods so far avail¬
able for achieving earlier diagnosis.
It is important to distinguish between
early diagnosis, on the one hand, and,
on the other, a screening programme
to detect pre-cancerous lesions the
removal of which achieves true can¬
cer prevention.
Where earlier diagnosis of establish¬
ed cancer is required we are con¬
cerned (a) with symptoms and (b) with
physical examination of one kind or
another.
When we are concerned with a com¬
mon cancer, such as a breast cancer in
England or gastric cancer in Japan, we
begin to think in terms of some physi¬
cal means of detection on a population
basis.
So far as breast cancer is con¬
cerned we have already seen that cure
is possible by correct methods of
treatment, but that much higher cure
rates are achieved with smaller tu¬
mours. How feasible are screening
programmes for the detection of small
tumours?
Some workers urge regular self-ex¬
amination of the breasts. This is at least
inexpensive' and requires no help from
others apart from initial instruction. But
is it effective? Can one really expect
a widely acceptable programme of
self-examination to produce a demon¬
strable impact on breast cancer death
rates? Personally I am sceptical.
But what of other physical screen¬
ing methods such as mammography
(X-Ray examination), thermography
and ultrasonic scanning? These three
methods are under careful study in a
number of reliable centres and we
await, with impatient interest, the out¬
come of the final analyses.
But even If they prove potentially
effective can these techniques be
applied to whole communities often
enough to create the impact we re¬
quire on the breast cancer problem?
What of the economics of such a pro¬
gramme, not only in terms of cost to
the patient, but in terms of manpower
to carry out the examinations and,
equally vital, to maintain clinical
records and follow-up?
Here then is where it might be
essential to concentrate on the relev¬
ant high risk groups. But do we know
the high risk groups so far as breast
cancer is concerned? A lot is indeed
known about this. Nevertheless,
breast cancer detection programmes
will have to be very carefully designed
if they are to show any success.
What of gastric cancer? In Japan,
where this is the commonest of all
malignant tumours, great efforts are
being made to carry out fibre-optic
gastric photography on a large scale.
But again we are faced with the eco¬
nomics of the problem, in the widest
sense of the term. Once more the
need must surely be to determine the
truly high risk group and to concen¬
trate first on that section of the
population.
In the United States a yearly exami¬
nation of the intestines is recom¬
mended in the hope of detecting either
pre-cancerous or early malignant
lesions. So far as I can judge, how¬
ever, this is an expensive procedure
and, if widely based population screen¬
ing is to be done, some economic
direction of effort is essential.
In short, every country and indeed
every region and socio-economic
group within each country has its own
high risk groups who represent the
primary problem in cancer control.
Each country must therefore work out
its own approach to its own problem.
The U.I.C.C. has a special Com¬
mission concerned with Cancer Epi¬
demiology under the chairmanship of
John Higginson. This Commission
has already carried out extremely
important work in mapping out the
sometimes wide variations in cancer
incidence throughout the world. This
is one of the first steps in establishing
the existence of high risk groups,
providing guide-lines for national
cancer control programmes.
R
, ESEARCH is a much
abused word. To many people
research means test tubes, guinea
pigs and mice, and some organizations
will only finance this type of research.
In fact the U.I.C.C. Committee on
Public Education is vitally concerned
with research in educational method¬
ology and the evaluation of different
techniques of persuasion. The Com¬
mittee on Professional Education is
likewise concerned with educational
psychology and techniques. The
problem of how to combat pessimism
on the one hand and how to translate
knowledge into action on the other, are
very considerable problems indeed.
Epidemiological studies are vital to
the identification of high risk groups,
and research must further be carried
out into different techniques for the
detection of early cancers in all anato¬
mical sites.
I have already mentioned a number
of sites in which early detection is
rarely achieved and new techniques
for preventing and or detecting cancer
in these sites must be sought with a
proper sense of urgency. At this
point we begin to look to those
concerned with fundamental research
in cancer In the hope that some test,
similar perhaps to the Wasserman test
for syphilis, or other serological tests
for various infections might yet be ap¬
plied to the field of malignant disease.
Even if it should ultimately prove
possible, it would, of course, be of
little value to present the clinician with
a test indicating only that cancer exists
somewhere in the body. What we
require is some specific test which
Indicates the probable presence of
cancer at some specific anatomical
site. Such a test, I fear, seems a very
long way from realization.
To sum up, we must continue to
accept the challenge of cancer as it
is today. We must not be dismayed
by our present failures; failure to cure
attracts attention success goes un¬
noticed.
We must increase our already
considerable successes for all those
cancers for which current therapeutic
measures can already offer high
prospects of permanent cure provided
we can get them to hospital earlier
than we do at present.
The percentage of early stage can¬
cers of. the uterine cervix diagnosed
have increased about 15 per cent over
the past four decades in my own cen¬
tre. It would be nice to explain this
on the basis of public education and/or
on cervical cytology. It Is not, unfor¬
tunately, possible to attribute this
improvement to any one activity and
it seems to me most likely that it is the
result both of local and national chan¬
ges in the climate of opinion concern¬
ing cancer in general and cervical can¬
cer in particular. Whatever the reason,
this change must undoubtedly lead to
the saving of many many more lives.
This kind of improvement in prognosis
must be. sought with cancers in all
anatomical sites and by all available
methods.
The International Union against
Cancer is already active in all the
relevant fields of work and, with
continued international support, we
can confidently expect each type of
cancer, one by one, to yield to
increasing therapeutic pressures.

E,

the farmers get up to start their

rain starts falling. It keeps falling
throughout the day covering Brittany
with an all too familiar veil. But
without the rain there would be no
herds of cattle for making butter.
When work is over, when a farmer
meets a friend or an errand takes him
to the nearest village, a glass or two
of wine or a stiff drink of calvados
seems to shut out the cold and damp
and make a hard life easier and
friendlier.

'GEOGRAPHY' OF CANCER (Continued)
Is the secret hidden in the soil?
the Centre set up by IARC, co-ordin¬
ates the material which is gathered
along the Kenya-Uganda border by the
Medical Research Council of Great
Britain with his own research.
In France, Dr A. Tuyns, a member
of the Agency staff, is studying
oesophageal cancer in man in Brittany
in collaboration with the Rennes
School of Public Health and Professor
Louis Massé. In Jamaica, Professor G.
Bras heads the Agency centre. In
Curaçao, Dr U. de Jong of the Agency
is at work on the spot profiting by the
co-operation of the Curaçao cancer
registry. And so the net to gather
vital data has been spread over vast
distances, and covers quite different
climates and ways of life.
The dominant idea behind this
research is that if regions like Brittany
and Curaçao differ widely in most
characteristics, it might be possible to
find those they share and so even¬
tually isolate the factor responsible
for causing such a high rate of cancer
of the oesophagus..
One distinction can be made, based
on the different incidence of the
disease between the sexes. In
Brittany and Jamaica, it is primarily
the men who are subject to the
disease. In Curaçao, the rate is high
among both sexes.
But the first nagging question
remains, what common link can there
be between a rugged peninsula jutting
into the cold Atlantic sea, a tropical
island bathed in sunshine, and the
uplands of a continental plateau? One
fact which struck observers imme¬
diately was a certain liking people of
these regions share for their local
alcoholic beverages or, in the case of
Curaçao, for their hot maize porridge.
The Bretons down large draughts of
calvados while the people of Malawi,
far away in Africa, like their home¬
made gin.
Studies have shown that at least
home-made Malawi gin contains nitro-
samines, chemicals which can provoke
oesophageal cancer in animals. If
samples of the drinks or food in these
regions reveal the presence of nitro-
samines in large quantities this may
prove significant.
But Curaçao, Trinidad, Brittany and
Malawi are still thousands of miles
apart. This makes study more difficult
and the job of eliminating all extra¬
neous factors almost overwhelming.
Therefore, the discovery of three re¬
gions in the same country, geographi¬
cally quite close together, with three
different patterns of oesophageal can¬
cer proved to be the starting point
for a unique supporting study. Scien¬
tists had found a natural microcosm
In which to study this form of cancer.
Along the northern coast of Iran,
on the Caspian Sea, lie three regions
with very different climates and life
patterns.
The first region is heavily forest¬
ed, well-watered land where the
main crops are tea and rice. Further
east up the coast lies an intermediate
region where there is some rainfall
and cotton fields predominate, although
there are a variety of activities inclu¬
ding tourism and fishing. Finally,
slightly inland from the coast, lies a
semi-desert region, a region of camels
and thirst, of poverty and nomadic
huts. Three regions, only a short dis¬
tance apart; three ways of life, three
climates and soils, three strikingly
different patterns of cancer of the
oesophagus.
The dry region of Gonbad-Gorgan
has the highest incidence, 50 to 70
cases per-1 00,000 people. The interme¬
diate region is between the two extre¬
mes with about 15 per 100,000: the
well-watered area, or ralnbelt, has only
about 6 per 100,000. The question
seeking an answer is, why?
To find out, a start was made on this
problem by a team in the summer of
1968. Dr Ezat Mahboubl, of the Ins¬
titute of Public Health in Teheran, orga¬
nized a cancer registry in the spring
of 1968 as part of a joint research
agreement with IARC. Dr Janet Kmet,
an IARC staff member works closely
with a team of physicians and techni¬
cians who permanently scan the Cas¬
pian littoral collecting all available
information from local doctors. The
research base Is at Babol, in the field

Why do certain types of cancer afflict
particular regions? In northern Iran, on the
Caspian sea, three adjacent regions, having
very different climates, types of soil and
patterns of life, provide research workers
with a natural field of study. The incidence
of cancer of the oesophagus varies widely
from one region to another. There seems
to be a relation between the humidity and the
salinity of the soil and this type of cancer.
But many factors have to be distinguished
and compared before a definite conclusion
can be reached. So a research station was
established last year at Babol where
information from local doctors Is collected.
1. Far left, fishermen on the Caspian Sea.
In this wooded, well-watered region the
incidence of cancer of the oesophagus Is low.
(6 per 100,000 of the population.)
2. In the cotton-growing Babol region, left,
the rainfall is less extensive than on the
Caspian coast. Cancer of the oesophagus
affects 15 out of 100,000 of the population.
3. Right, the arid zone of Gonbad-Gorgan is
inhabited by nomadic tribesmen and here the
incidence of oesophageal cancer it about ten
times higher than It ii among the Caspian
fishermen (50 to 70 per 100,000 of the
population).
for the study by the Iranian Institute
of Public Health Research.
Dr Kmet hopes, by studying the
physical, biotic and cultural charac¬
teristics of the Caspian littoral, to
discover new techniques for under¬
standing the environmental factors
in cancer.
The region chosen In Iran has
many unique advantages. Within
a small distance, there are striking
changes In climate and soil; Dr Kmet
strongly suspects that the humidity of
the climate and the salinity of the soil
play a part, but before incriminating
one or two factors, many others must
first be examined and acquitted.
In the desert region of Gonbad, peo¬
ple have a habit of drinking large quan¬
tities of tea, scorching hot. It was
plausible that this fiery flood of liquid
poured down the soft linings of the
gullet would over the years instigate
cancer. It seemed reasonable, but it
wasn't true: people in the neighbour¬
ing regions who don't suffer a high
incidence of oesophageal cancer also
like to drink their tea scalding hot.
Moreover, women in Gonbad do not
drink more tea, yet they have a higher
incidence of oesophageal cancer than
the men.
So many things are involved that
finding the factors responsible for
human cancer requires long efforts in
various disciplines. The way of life
a vague term can be broken down
into a thousand component parts, any
one of which may be important.
How do the people work? What do
people eat and drink? Finally, the place
itself, the climate and the soil on
which the community lives and from
which it draws Its sustenance has to
be studied. According to Dr Kmet,
the evidence collected so far seems
to suggest that low rainfall and high
salinity in the soil are related to the
oesophageal cancer problem.
A geographical concordance bet¬
ween humidity and salinity of the soil
on the one hand, and the distribution
of oesophageal cancer on the other,
has been clearly shown, but it may
be coincidental. Where there are sa¬
line types of soil there is a high In¬
cidence of this disease, at least in
the vast areas of central Asia. These
findings generally fit well with thé high
incidence of oesophageal cancer on
the Iranian plateau.
The findings in Kazakhstan in the
U.S.S.R. support the hypothesis of a
causal relation, since the border bet¬
ween saline soil types in the coastal
areas and non-saline soils in the forest
and chernozem districts north and
west of the northern shores of the
Caspian Sea is a disease dividing-line
similar to those found in Iran. Some¬
thing similar has also been noted in
Kenya.
But clues are not proof and every
factor must be weighed, compared and
sifted. For facts to be accurate and
comparable, they must be gathered in
a uniform way. The team therefore set
out to standardize the observations to
be gathered in the field research sta¬
tion at Babol. Located in the Interme¬
diate region, it already serves as a co¬
ordination centre for the data collected
with the aid of three hundred doctors.
These physicians send in biopsies
which are examined in the laboratory.
The pathologist, Dr Salmasizade, and
the head of the registry, Dr Falati, go
out themselves to visit each local
health centre as well as physicians in
the region in order to check on cancer
reports. A large map is being drawn
up to show the areas where the diffe¬
rent forms of cancer oesophagus,
lungs and other sites are occurring.
The road leads out through the des¬
ert dotted Irregularly with the yourtas
of the nomads. This traditional way
of life still stretches its tents from Iran
to the edge of China.
Region two lies midway between
desert and rainbelt. The way of life
differs from that of the desert although
the diet Is about the same. The Babol
research centre is at the hub of this
region. Here is where the precious
files are accumulated and studied.
Chaluz lies in the heart of the rain-
belt, Region three. The plants spar¬
kling with dew emphasize the life-giving
humidity here. Children are out at
work harvesting weeds from the rice
fields to feed the livestock. On the
coast, the fishermen embark for a day
at sea. Here the number of cases of
oesophageal cancer reported Is very
low.
The road rises through the clouds
and breaks the rain barrier to emerge
on the other side, where the way leads
to Teheran. Behind the mist lie three nn
regions where diets are similar, al- /JJ
though occupations differ. Where does
the difference lie? The answer may
be hidden In the dirt under foot.

Air pollution
and
lung cancer
by R.E. Waller
T
	 HE possibility that air
pollution might be a factor in the
development of lung cancer was first
considered nearly forty years ago.
The classical work of Prof. Ernest
Kennaway and his associates in
London had shown that compounds
capable of producing tumours when
painted on mouse skin could be
isolated from coal tar, and it was
recognized that these compounds were
likely to be present too in urban air
polluted by coal smoke.
Lung cancer death rates were above
average among men working in
industries where coal was distilled,
and in Britain, -America and in many
countries of Europe the number of
deaths attributed to this disease in
the general population was increasing
from year to year.
At first it was widely thought that
improvements in diagnostic pro¬
cedures, and their greater availability
throughout the countries concerned,
were responsible for much of the
recorded increase in lung cancer, but
by the time the Second World War
interrupted the regular study of
mortality trends, in 1939, it was clear
that there must have been some real
increase in the incidence of the
disease.
In England and Wales, Dr. Percy
Stocks Chief Medical Statistician,
found substantial differences In lung
cancer mortality between different
towns, and a general tendency for

R. E. WALLER Is a member of the Medical
Research Council's scientific staff in the
Air Pollution Unit at St. Bartholomew's
Hospital Medical College, London. He
has studied the role of air pollution in
relation to lung cancer and bronchitis for
more than 20 years. He will be one of
the chairmen of the panel on Air Pollution
and Cancer at the 10th Cancer Congress,
in Houston, Texas, this month.
death rates to be highest in London
and the large industrial towns,
declining gradually with size of town,
to the lowest rates in rural areas.
Although there was some evidence
that availability of hospital services
was a relevant factor, these findings,
coupled with the known carcinogenic
action of products from the distillation
or incomplete burning of coal, soon
suggested that air pollution might be
concerned in the development of luhg
cancer.
At the time, there were reports from
Germany of an association between
smoking and lung cancer, and carci¬
nogenic "tars" had been produced
by a number of workers by the
distillation of tobacco. Thus when
plans were made after the war for
further studies on the cause of the
ever rising incidence of lung cancer,
smoking as well as air pollution was
considered as a possible factor.
Epidemiological studies were started
in Britain and in the United States,
among hospital patients with lung
cancer, and these led, by 1950, to a
clear demonstration of the association
between cigarette smoking and lung
cancer.
Simultaneously, work was in
progress on the presence of carcino¬
genic substances in urban air, and
one of the compounds already isolated
from coal tar, benzo(a)pyrene, was
found to be widely distributed in the
air of towns in Great Britain. The
amount present varied roughly with
the size of town, and its chief source
appeared to be domestic coal fires,
though small amounts were also
present in the exhaust products from
motor vehicles. Detailed studies of
local differences In lung cancer death
rates in England and Wales still showed
a general relationship with size of
town, and there appeared to be a
close correlation with various Indices
of pollution by coal smoke.
All these findings were discussed
at an international symposium in
Louvain in 1952. It was clear then that
there had been a real and rapid rise
In lung cancer mortality In all the
developed countries of the world from
which reliable data were available.
Death rates were particularly high in
Austria, Great Britain and many other
countries of Western Europe.
In all cases the increase had, up to
that time, been much greater among
men than among women. There was
also evidence of an "urban excess"
of lung cancer even in countries such
as Denmark, where the towns did not
suffer much from air pollution
problems.
ANY features of the trends
in mortality could be explained in
terms of the established association
with smoking. It was cigarette, rather
than pipe or cigar smoking that led to
an increased risk of lung cancer, and
although in many countries the overall
consumption of tobacco had not
changed much, there had been a
massive swing from pipes to cigarettes
during the first half of the century.
The much higher incidence of lung
cancer among men than among women
was In keeping with their heavier and
longer history of cigarette smoking.
Air pollution did not fit into the
picture as a major factor, for in
countries where the increase in lung
cancer had been most rapid there
had not been any general increase
in pollution. In Great Britain in par¬
ticular, pollution by coal smoke had
been worse at the beginning of the
century than it was in 1950. It remained
possible however that the carcinogens
in coal smoke played some part in

AIR POLLUTION (Continued)
Extra bonuses for smoke-free city dwellers
conjunction with smoking or. that new
forms of pollution were of special
significance.
One of the reasons for retaining an
interest in the possible effect of air
pollution was the high lung cancer
death rate in Great Britain as compared
with the United States, despite similar
smoking histories.
Although it seems likely that some
of this difference is accounted for- by
the American habit of throwing away a
larger proportion of each cigarette, It
has been shown that British emigrants
to South Africa, Australia, New
Zealand, Canada and the United
States have higher lung cancer death
rates than the native residents of these
countries, though lower rates than
those of the compatriots they leave
behind.
These differences cannot be ex¬
plained in terms of the extent of
cigarette smoking and unless there are
differences in the types of cigarette
smoked or the manner of smoking,
these results suggest an extra risk
introduced by having lived in Britain.
Emigrants from Norway to the
United States have, on the other hand,
rates that are higher than those of
Norwegians who stay In Norway and
lower than those of American-born
residents of the United States. Whilst
it may be that emigrants are selected
sections of the population, making It
difficult to draw firm conclusions from
these results, the implication Is that
the overall exposure to pollution
modifies the lung cancer death rates.
S
32
'INCE 1950 surveys of
benzo (a)-pyrene and other carcin¬
ogens in the air have been carried out
in cities throughout the world. Whilst
the concentrations found are in general
largest where coal Is used for domestic
heating purposes, some benzo(a)py-
rene is produced in other combustion
processes, and this compound can
be detected in most urban areas.
In one survey in North Wales and
the North West of England, the results
were, linked directly with detailed
studies on lung cancer mortality and
smoking. Death rates increased from
the least to the most polluted areas
among non-smokers and among all but
the heaviest smokers, but smoking
itself was still the major factor in
determining the- rates.
More recently, a small scale Inter¬
national study has been done under
the auspices of the World Health
Organization. Lung cancer mortality,
pollution and smoking were compared
first in Belfast and Dublin, chosen as
cities of similar size (500,000 popu¬
lation), with similar social conditions.
The higher death rates found in Belfast
were not wholly accounted for by
differences in smoking habits, but they
were in accord with the higher
concentrations of smoke and benzo(a)-
pyrene found there.
On the other hand, when the study
was repeated in Oslo and Helsinki,
the relatively high death rates in
Helsinki did not indicate any effect
of pollution, since the concentrations
of smoke and benzo(a)pyrene were
lower there than in Oslo, and the
differences in death rates appeared
to be due to differences in smoking
habits.
The findings from this survey
emphasized the limited value of
surveys of pollution at the present
time. With modern oil heating
installed in most buildings, the con¬
centrations of smoke and the
associated benzo(a)pyrene were very
low in Helsinki, but it seemed likely
that they would have been higher
some years ago, when other forms
of heating were in use.
A similar situation exists now in
Great Britain: London and other large
cities that suffered severely from pol¬
lution by coal smoke earlier this cen¬
tury are now relatively clean, due
mainly to the operation of the Clean
Air Act (1956). Surveys of pollution at
the present time therefore provide
little guide to the lifetime exposures
of people now of "lung cancer age".
Continuous monitoring of urban
concentrations of pollution from now
on could provide results to link with
future mortality experience. It is
doubtful however whether large scale
analytical work to determine the con¬
centrations of benzo(a)pyrene and
related carcinogenic compounds in
cities throughout the world is justi¬
fied.
Such evidence as there is from men
exposed occupationally to large con¬
centrations of these compounds sug¬
gest that their effect on lung cancer
mortality is small. A study of men
employed in the production of coal gas
in Great Britain showed that retort
house workers had a slightly increas¬
ed risk of developing lung cancer, as
compared with the general population,
but the concentrations of benzo(a)
pyrene in which some of them worked
were of the order of 100 to 1,000 times
those in normal urban air.
It has been suggested that pollution
from motor vehicles, containing small
quantities of benzo(a)pyrene, may
be of interest in relation to lung can¬
cer, but there is no evidence of any
marked excess of this disease among
men who work in close proximity to
motor exhausts, e.g. as maintenance
men in garages, as policemen on point
duty or as drivers of goods or passen¬
ger vehicles.
A
LLTHOUGH it is now clear
that air pollution cannot be a major
factor in the development of lung
cancer, there is still an "urban factor"
in the mortality statistics in all parts
of the world. Commonly, lung cancer
death rates in large towns are two to
three times those in rural areas, but
against this must be set the finding
that cigarette smokers as a whole have
death rates that are about 20 times
those of non-smokers.
Thus any differences in smoking
habits between town and country are
likely to have a large effect on death
rates, and the present situation may
be a legacy of lower levels of cigarette
smoking in rural areas thirty or more
years ago, even though current smok¬
ing habits are similar In town and
country.
In Britain an interesting situation is
developing now, for the end of the
increase in male lung cancer death
rates is in sight, and among middle-
aged men there are even signs of a
slight decrease. The trend is most
marked in London, whilst in rural areas
death rates are still rising at all ages.
This slight erosion of the "urban
factor" could be due to the levell¬
ing out of smoking habits, or merely
to selective movements of population
between town and country, but it is
of possible interest in relation to chan¬
ges in pollution, since there has been
a marked reduction in the amount of
coal smoke In the air of London, part¬
icularly during the last 10 to 15 years.
It may be many years before the
reasons for these changing trends can
be sorted out, but even if the part
played by air pollution in the develop¬
ment of lung cancer is small, it is
already clear that the dramatic reduc¬
tion in smoke concentrations in the
major cities of Britain has had many
beneficial effects, including reduced
effects on bronchitic patients, increas¬
ed visibility and a general improvement
in the environment.

TRICKS OF THE SPIDER'S TRADE
Sir,
It is always a pleasure to open your
magazine and find the special kind of
article one never sees in other publica¬
tions. I enjoyed Hans Jenny's article
on the Sculpture of Vibrations (Dec¬
ember 1969) but one aspect was
missing, namely, sound films. Walt
Disney utilized this means by screening
images from the sound track of a
film during the interval in his full-length
musical, "Fantasia", and the effect was
extraordinary.
Another example of the unusual in the
same Issue was the analysis of the
building of a spider's web. As a
naturalist I read this eagerly, but, alasl,
I did not find the answer to an enigma
that puzzles everyone, including the
young people I teach: Before the first
phase of web construction, how did
the spider "leap the gap" between the
log cabin and the hazel bush?
Abbé Henri Debisschof
Lille, France
When a spider climbs Up on a blade
of tall grass or a branch It pays out
a .silken thread which, carried by the
wind, becomes attached to another
plant some distance away. When there
is no wind, or if the spider is spinning
indoors, it begins by attaching its line
to some object (indoors) or plant
(outdoors) then unwinds the thread as
it moves down the supporting branch or
object. After moving for 20 to 30 cen¬
timetres, it climbs on another support,
tightens the line, attaches it, and
begins the basic construction of the
web.
With regard to the sequence in Walt
Disney's "Fantasia", this was a visual
representation of the patterns on the
sound track of the film. It was a purely
visual creation, having no relation with
sound vibrations produced from solid
particles Editor.
PIONEER OF WORK CAMPS
Sir,
Service Civil International was the
first organization to sponsor work
camps as meeting places where youth
could exchange ideas and build friend¬
ships In the service of Peace and
better understanding between peoples.
This year Service Civil International
celebrates its fiftieth anniversary. We
feel that this provides an ¡deal occasion
to show to a wider public how the
notion of work camps and long-term
service has developed throughout this
period.

NOISE POLLUTION
Sir,
I was enchanted by your issue on
cymatics, the sculpture of vibrations
(December 1969). But I would like one
issue to be devoted to "noise", as you
did for water or air pollution. Noise
has become a terrible enemy of man
kind, and we are all simply heading for
nervous breakdowns consciously or
unconsciously. Not enough material is
available. I have given a few passages
as class-work on the subject, but I and
other teachers and educators need
much more material, and presented in
a more scientific way.
Blanca Romano
Tel Aviv, Israel
Our reader must have missed our
July 1967 issue entirely devoted to the
harrowing problems of noise in modern
society Editor.
HIGH QUALITY - LOW PRICE
Sir,
I cannot understand how you can
provide such a high quality magazine
at such a low subscription price. I am
amazed. All I can say is that the
magazine and its price reflect the qua¬
lity of the organization and its goals.

' COURIER ' IN THE CLASSROOM
Sir,
Your magazine has been a source of
cultural information for me and my fami¬
ly for years, and as a school teacher
I have always enjoyed sharing its
contents with my students in the class¬
room. Thank you for your contributions
to world education and possibly to
better world understanding and peace.
Richard Rivard
Tiverton, R.I., U.S.A.
SCHOOL-AGE SMOKERS
As a regular reader of your magazine
for many years, may I compliment you
on the high standard of your issues and
your choice of interesting subjects.
One worthy of special praise is the
theme "Can We Keep Our Planet Habit¬
able?" (January 1969).
Since education is one of your chief
concerns, I suggest you tackle the
problem of tobacco, particularly as it
affects young people.
With the acquiescence of educational
authorities, youngsters in school are
surrendering to the smoking habit at
increasingly earlier ages. The effects
of this are disastrous: intellectually,
morally and physically. As a teacher
I say that we should act at once to put
a stop to this.
Georges Moureaux
Oyonnax, France
FORUM FOR YOUTH
Sir,
In your issue, "Youth 69" (April
1969), I was struck by the sound opi¬
nions offered by sociologists and other
specialist authors of your articles. It
is reassuring to find that we, the youn¬
ger generation, are understood by at
least some adults.
But I feel that something was lacking
in the issue perhaps the most impor
tant thing of all: the views of young
people expressed by themselves. I
think you should plan an Issue on
these lines and announce it well in
advance so that many young people
would have a chance to send you their
ideas on the problems of modern youth.
Jean-Claude Hassan
(aged 15) Tunis, Tunisia
We welcome our reader's proposal
and would be glad to hear from young
people everywhere on the problems of
youth Editor.
PRIORITY FOR PEACE
Sir,
I have subscribed to the "Unesco
Courier" for four years, and not only my
own large family but my friends too
read it through from cover to cover.
You present many world problems, and
in my view the impact of each issue
continues long after its publication. I
believe that 20th century man has
knowledge enough to overcome all prob¬
lems. The most crucial one is how
to maintain world peace, so you should
give it top priority.
A.M. Byelomestnykh
Smela, U.S.S.R.
REAL 20TH CENTURY EVIL
Sir,
Congratulations for the February
1970 issue. Your evaluation of the
Pearson Report Is excellent, and brings
to mind the superb play written for
U.N. radio In 1950 by Norman Corwin,
entitled "Could Be". In his dramatic
portrayal of a "Peace Blitz" by hundreds
of thousands of the world's citizens,
Corwin the artist showed the way to
Pearson the statesman and planner.
It Is worth recalling the statement by
Pope John XXIII: "Narrow nationalism
is the real evil of the 20th century."
The "Unesco Courier" Is doing an
excellent work In helping to lead the
way out of that "narrow nationalism".
C. N. Richardson

HEADING FOR ASPHYXIA?
Sir,
How about an issue on oxygen, and
the world oxygen supply? After all,
what is the point of drilling for oil if
there won't be enough oxygen left to
keep us alive after the oil is burned?
M. J. Nicol-Griffith
Pointe Claire, Canada
DWINDLING WOLVES
Sir,
I know very well what is happening
to the world's remaining wolves, but
are many people aware of this problem
of near extinction? I think an issue
with all the facts would be very help¬
ful. It would be appreciated by many
readers and not merely by conserv¬
ationists and animal lovers.

Training the
cell scientist
Unesco and the International Cell
Research Organization (ICRO) are offer¬
ing new training facilities to young
scientists. Fellowships in microbiology will
enable scientists from developing countries
to train for nine months In research
laboratories abroad. A Unesco-ICRO train¬
ing course on animal viruses and host
cells will be organized by the Institute
of Virology of the Slovak Academy of
Science, at Bratislava, from September 14
to October 10, this year.
Sampling the ocean bed
Drilling crews on the U.S. océanographie
research ship, "Glomar Challenger" have
recovered over four miles of sediment
material from ocean beds during the first
18 months of the U.S. National Science
Foundation's Deep Sea Drilling Project.
Seventy-five scientists from 15 countries
were members of ship-board scientific
staffs during cruises in the Gulf of Mexico,
the Caribbean Sea and the Atlantic and
Pacific Oceans, completed last January.
Drilling records were established for the
deepest water worked {20,146 feet) and
the deepest penetration of the ocean bed
(3,230 feet).
Men and Medicine
in the Middle East
An assessment of public health progress
In an area stretching from Tunisia to Pak¬
istan, and an account of the medical
legacy of the great Middle Eastern civiliza¬
tions are presented in "Men and Medicine
in the Middle East", recently published
by WHO. Among other achievements it
reports: medical manpower tripled; a 30
per cent drop In infant mortality rates
in several countries; smallpox incidence
reduced to a fraction of the 1950s level
(See Bookshelf).
Poland's student
volunteer workers
Student Voluntary Latour Brigades in
Poland work on building projects, in agri¬
culture and forestry, thus helping to ease
labour shortages during the summer months.
In their free time the students organize
cultural and educational lectures, sporting
and social events in co-operation with local
authorities. In 1969, 47,000 students, includ¬
ing 500 from neighbouring countries, work¬
ed during the vacation months.
Extinction threat
to vicuna
Of the 200,000 vicuna in Peru ten years
ago only 20,000 now remain, and the
species will die out unless drastic measures
are taken to protect them from mass hunt¬
ing says an FAO report. Vicuna are priz¬
ed for their fine soft wool, but the animals
are difficult to round up for shearing and
poachers shoot them to obtain a quick
profit. The Peruvian government is train¬
ing more gamekeepers to patrol its 125,000
acre game reserve in order to halt the
mass killing.
A World to Gain
"A World to Gain", a handbook issued
by the U.N. National Commission for
Unesco in co-operation with the U.S. Uni¬
ted Nations Association and the National
Education Association, explains the back¬
ground to International Education Year
1970. It aims to help non-governmental
organizations in planning IEY activities
throughout 1970.
Food aid for Yugoslav
earthquake victims
Over 17,000 Yugoslav school children
at Banja Luka, which was devastated by
two earthquakes in October 1969, are to
receive food rations for three months from
the World Food Programme, the agency
set up by FAO in 1961. The earth¬
quakes left 8,000 families homeless, and
half of the city's 60,000 population had to
be evacuated. The 17,000 school children
who remained in the town are at present
being fed by the Yugoslav government.
War on food predators
The Indian Pest Control Association has
submitted a scheme to the Indian Govern¬
ment for reducing the ravages of rats and
insects which destroyed 13 million tons
of food grains during 1967-68. The scheme
would cost 2,400 million rupees, but would
achieve an estimated saving of 11,250 mil¬
lion rupees over a 5 year period.
'Clean up' plan
for Europe
A six-point plan for improving living
conditions in Europe has been proposed
by Sweden's Minister of Agriculture, Inge-
mund Bengtsson. He advocates careful
planning of new urban areas, high-degree
purification of sewage, a reduction in the
sulphur content of heating oils, centraliz¬
ed heating plants, promotion of communal
transport systems as an alternative to pri¬
vate cars and more stringent anti-exhaust
fume laws.
Language laboratory
for nuclear technicians
Hundreds of scientists and technicians
employed by CERN (the European Organiz¬
ation for Nuclear Research) at Meyrin,
near Geneva, Switzerland, have recently
been working in a different kind of labo¬
ratory: CERN's new language laboratory
which is equipped with the latest audio¬
visual teaching devices. Crash courses
in English, French and Russian for these
nuclear specialists are then supplemented
with traditional instruction in written lan¬
guage, grammar and spelling.

Flashes...
A tool believed to be 2,200,000 years old
has been unearthed in'Ethiopia. A piece of
quartz, sharpened on both sides, it was
discovered by French archaeologists on a
site near the Omo River.
Women comprised 50% of the labour
force in U.S.S.R., 37% in Germany (Fed.
Rep.), 36% in U.K. and U.S.A. and 35%
in France in 1966, says a recent OECD
report.
The United Nations General Assembly
has asked the U.N. Secretary-General to
study the feasibility of establishing an
international university.
As its 900th major pre-investment
project, the United Nations Development
Programme is helping the Government of
Malaysia to set up a fishermen's training
centre in Penang.
Byelorussia is launching a major pro¬
gramme for the preservation and con¬
servation of its monuments and archi¬
tectural sites. Under a recent law all
historical monuments are accorded govern¬
ment protection.
