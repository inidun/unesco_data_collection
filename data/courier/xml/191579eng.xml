the Dope 
on cycling
Doping has entered into the public 
consciousness with the announcement 
that 2006 Tour de France Champion Floyd Landis has tested 
positive for elevated testosterone levels. Fans worldwide 
are wondering, was this year’s race nothing more than a sham? 4
Doping for glory

East Germany became a sporting powerhouse 
overnight at the 1972 Olympic Games 
and continued to dominate the international sports arena 
throughout the 1970’s and 80’s. The secret to its success? 
A state-sponsored doping programme that involved 
an estimated 10,000 athletes. 10
street

Parallel to million dollar soccer contracts, 
rigged games, doping problems, blows 
with the head and red cards, a new style of soccer playing 
is emerging and it goes beyond the sport itself. 
Street soccer is gaining ground and popularity 
in many developing countries and aims at creating 
a social network in difficult neighborhoods. 6

Millions of young people dream of 
one day emulating their sporting 
heroes. And then we are shattered 
when we discover that the achieve-
ments of our idols, such as base-
ball player Jason Giambi or sprinter 
Justin Gatlin, were the product of 
doping.
Winning 
at any cost?
Winning at any cost may mean sur-
mounting almost unbeatable odds 
like Maria Mutola. It is also exempli-
fied by the Argentinean Club Atlé-
tico Defensores del Chaco who 
rose from the slums of the Buenos 
Aires suburbs to compete in the 
first street soccer World Cup, held 
in Germany this summer in parallel 
to the FIFA World Cup. 
But the need to win at any cost 
can also lead to doping. Taylor Hou-
ton turned to anabolic steroids be-
cause he saw his high school class-
mates using them and thought that 
performance enhancing drugs were 
the key to victory. 
wo children living on opposite sides 
of the globe faced obstacles in their 
personal quests to excel at sport. 
Growing up poor in the outskirts of 
Maputo (Mozambique), Maria Mu-
tola was told that she could not con-
tinue to play soccer because of her 
gender; in Houston, Texas (United 
States), Taylor Houton’s baseball 
coach told him that he wasn’t strong 
enough to play on his high school’s 
team. The two children reacted differ-
ently in the face of these challenges. 
Maria changed codes and went on 
to become an Olympic Gold Medal-
ist runner; Taylor turned to anabolic 
steroids to increase his muscle mass 
and died violently at 17 years of age. 
UNESCO supports physical edu-
cation and sport in educational set-
tings and also promotes the Interna-
tional Convention against Doping in 
Sport. This issue of the UNESCO 
Courier takes a closer look at sport 
and what it means to work towards a 
better sport.
Sport mirrors 
society
“We should see sport is a microcosm 
of society,” says Paul Marriott-Lloyd 
of the Unit for Physical Education 
and Sport in UNESCO. “Like in so-
ciety, good things happen and bad 
things happen in sport. The only dif-
ference is that every move is played 
out on our television screens or 
on the back pages of newspapers 
around the world.” 
We are fascinated by profession-
al sports and successful athletes. 
Entire nations sit glued to their 
television sets during the Olympic 
Games or a World Cup tournament. 
                         sport touches all parts of society in every country around the world. 
             We are all physically active at some level and sport contributes to a broad range of social 
       and development goals. however, sport is not without its problems as the scandals 
                           surrounding the 2006 tour de france demonstrated.

T
Elite athletes in a variety of sports 
fall victim to the same temptation. 
In today’s headlines, we are reading 
about the scandal surrounding 2006 
Tour de France Champion Floyd 
Landis who has since tested posi-
tive for elevated testosterone levels 
and Marion Jones whose A sample 
has allegedly tested positive for the 
blood booster EPO (erythropoie-
tin). In the 1970’s and 1980’s, East 
Germany ran a state-sponsored do- 
ping programme that involved an 
estimated 10,000 athletes. 
There are a number of reasons why 
athletes use performance enhancing 
drugs and methods. It can be con-
sidered a product of the competitive 
sporting environment and an erosion 
of sporting ethics. “There is a lot of 
money, ‘fame and fortune’, in high-level 
sport,” Paul Marriott-Lloyd explains. 
“And that shapes how some people 
approach the game. Unfortunately 
there can be a perverse incentive for 
people to cheat.”  
Edna Yahil.
                                 Doping has entered into the public consciousness 
                   with the announcement that 2006 tour de france champion floyd landis 
has tested positive for elevated testosterone levels. fans worldwide are wondering, 
                           was this year’s race nothing more than a sham?
the dope on cycling  
our de France Champion Floyd 
Landis’s positive test for elevated 
levels of testosterone cannot be 
written off a simply a case of public-
ity. Landis will face a tribunal where 
he will be called on to explain the 
presence of synthetic testosterone 
and likely faces a two-year ban from 
all sport. However, he responded 
to the positive test results defiantly, 
proclaiming, “I was the strongest 
man in the Tour de France and that 
is why I am the champion.” Going 
further, he vowed, “I will fight these 
charges with the same determina-
tion and intensity that I bring to my 
training and racing. It is now my 
goal to clear my name and restore 
what I worked so hard to achieve.” 
Cycling has been saddled with 
doping allegations, scandals and 
deaths for years, but only within 
the last decade have they made 
front-page news. In 1998, authori-
ties apprehended the Festina Team 
masseur at the Franco-Belgian 
border with more than 400 doping 
products for the team’s riders in 
the Tour de France. During the en-
Street football match between Argentina and Brazil.

suring investigation it was not only 
revealed that the Festina Team was 
involved in systematic doping with 
a range of drugs to boost their per-
formance, but also that a number 
of other teams were implicated in 
this dangerous practice. Ultimately 
seven of the original 21 teams and 
at least 89 of the original 189 riders 
were barred from the race. 
The 2006 Tour de France was 
meant to be a new beginning. 
However, just weeks before the 
start, a major doping investigation 
in Spain called Operacion Puerto 
implicated 58 riders, amongst them 
the favorites Jan Ullrich, Ivan Basso 
and Francisco Mancebo, in an or-
ganized blood doping ring. These 
riders were removed from the Tour 
before it began along with six oth-
ers riders who were implicated by

the Tour Organizers who sought 
to give this pinnacle cycling event 
renewed credibility. This effort was 
entirely undermined by Landis’s 
failed drug test.
Too good to be true
The public is left reeling because 
Landis’s Stage 17 victory was the 
highlight of the Tour. After a miser-
able performance in the previous 
Stage that dropped him to 11th 
place, Landis flew over the moun-
tainous Stage 17 to finish well clear 
of the leaders. It was an inspirational 
performance, the most heroic feat 
seen in recent years. To now learn 
that banned drugs made this pos-
sible is heartbreaking. Cycling fans 
are left with nothing but emptiness 
as another hero like Olympic Gold 
medalist Tyler Hamilton is found to 
the shadow of his former teammate, 
Lance Armstrong. Instead he faces 
the ignominy of being the first Tour 
winner to be stripped of the title 
due to doping and lengthy legal 
processes. Alternately he has the 
chance to set the record straight 
about the culture in cycling and the 
pressures of professional sport. 
The cycling world faces renewed 
criticism to deal with the drug prob-
lem inherent in their sport. Although 
cycling has the most publicized 
problem with doping in sport, Pat 
McQuaid, President of the Inter-
national Cycling Union, states that 
they are working hard to stamp 
out drug cheats. “Cycling is at the 
forefront of the fight against dop-
ing,” he says, citing that the big-
gest challenge is to “eradicate the 
institutionalized doping.” It is all too 
easy to blame the cheating athletes 
and not the system which creates 
them. Change is required at all lev-
els within this sport. The administra-
tors, managers, coaches and team 
doctors need to take ownership of 
problem of doping and do all that 
is required to remove this cancer if 
the sport is to survive.
Why is doping 
such a problem?
Asked his opinion about what leads 
athletes turn to doping, McQuaid 
blames society. “For athletes to 
have different ideals than the rest 
of society is being a little bit overly 
optimistic,” he quips. And maybe 
McQuaid isn’t too far off the mark. 
After all, we live in a society where 
most strive for fame and fortune and 
where medical remedies are readily 
available. Unfortunately fundamen-
tal values and ethics like honesty 
and integrity have been lost some-
where along they way. 
Other sports are not immune to 
the problem of doping in sport. 
This is apparent with the revelation 
that Justin Gatlin, joint 100-metres 
world-record holder, has recently 
tested positive for elevated testos-
terone levels just like Landis. Foot-
ball, Baseball, Tennis and Triathlon 
also have dealt with this problem. 
The incontrovertible fact seems 
only to be that doping is a constant 
reality in sport. It has reached the 
point recently where every fan has 
to ask himself what he can believe 
in and whether sport holds the 
same luster as a source of inspira-
tion for all.
Matthew Quigley, 
in Sacramento, California (USA).
“I was the strongest man 
in the Tour de France 
and that is why 
I am the champion.”

a history of doping
today, “dope” means 
an illegal drug, especially 
cannabis or heroin. 
Where did this term 
come from?
Nineteenth-century Dutch settlers 
in South Africa were familiar 
with an alcoholic liquid extract 
from grape skins which Zulu 
warriors drank to heighten their 
strength and endurance before 
going to battle. Called “dop”, 
this concoction was also used for 
entering into a trance at religious 
feasts. From there, it made its way 
into the mainstream 
Dutch language as “doop” 
(meaning “sauce”) and “doopen” 
(“to adulterate, to dip”) 
and, towards the turn of the 
20th century, it was borrowed 
by the English language where 
“doping” was first associated with 
the illegal drugging of racehorses. 
And from English, it was a short 
hop towards other languages, 
the French “dopage”, 
the Spanish “dopaje”, and the list 
goes on. Even today, “dop” 
is still used in Afrikaans 
to denote an alcoholic drink.

have duped them and the sport by 
taking drugs. 
Having been dismissed by his 
former racing team sponsored by 
Phonak and now facing hip replace-
ment surgery, one can almost sym-
pathize with Landis. The race may 
well have been the capstone to a 
career or a chance to emerge from

street football
in Paso del rey
                        parallel to million dollar soccer contracts, rigged games, 
            doping problems, blows with the head and red cards, a new style of soccer
                  playing is emerging and it goes beyond the sport itself. 
          street soccer is gaining ground and popularity in many developing countries 
                          and aims at creating a social network in difficult neighborhoods.
The Club Atlético Defensores del 
Chaco, based in Paso del Rey, 
West of Buenos Aires, is reachable 
through a highway where golf clubs 
and private country clubs lie side by 
side with slumps. 
Almost an hour away from the 
Argentinian capital by bus, the Fun-
dación Defensores del Chaco’s 
head office is located among shan-
ty houses and half tared streets. 
This is where 1500 young men and 
women play handball, volleyball, 
basketball, and above all soccer in 
a different way. 
This year, the Defensores Club 
represented Argentina in the first 
street soccer World Cup ever. It 
took place in Germany this year, 
parallel to the FIFA World Cup and 
with street soccer’s specific rules. 
Meetings are organized in uncov-
ered spaces, either in fallow fields 
or in open air grounds and games 
are played without a referee – which

 these young players 
become successful athletes, 
or great artists. What counts 
is that they turn into people 
who generate solidarity 
within our community.”

would be the dream of most official 
teams, but in this case, is aimed at 
promoting dialogue. In street soc-
cer, it is up to the players in both 
teams to decide on the score in a 
third half-time, once the game is 
over. The final result depends not 
only on goals, but also on things 
such as “clean” playing, comrade-
ship and respect of the adversary. 
Chauvinism no longer holds true 
either, as two women have to be on 
the field at all times in each team of 
seven players. But street soccer’s 
most genuine quality is its social 
goal: “We don’t care whether these 
young players become success-
ful athletes, or great artists. What 
counts is that they turn into people 
who generate solidarity within our 
community”, explains Fabián Fer-
rero, who founded the Defensores 
Club twelve years ago with Julio 
Jiménez.
“We started this club because we 
couldn’t stand seeing these chil-
dren and youngsters sitting at street 
corners with nothing to do”, Fabián 
recalls. “We live in a complex area, 
where 250.000 inhabitants are 
spread out in 15 neighbourhoods 
of working class families who often 
have 5 to 6 children. Since the tan-
neries closed in the nineties – and 
these were the main source of labor

– unemployment has left the neigh-
borhood completely shattered. Vio-
lence, resulting from a lack of space 
for education and entertainment has 
given way to blatant apathy, desola-
tion and desperation. The State has 
been completely absent, so we ur-
gently decided to do something.” 
In Paso del Rey, as in most places 
in South America, throwing a soccer 
ball and letting it roll on the ground 
will get children rushing from all 
directions and ready to kick it, as 
shown by the ground-breaking ini-
tiative ”Soccer for Peace” (“Fútbol 
para la paz”) created in Colombia. 
The “Soccer for peace” initiative was 
instigated after the assassination of 
Andrés Escobar – a professional 
soccer player who shot an acciden-
tal auto-goal in a game against the 
United States at the 1994 World 
Cup in Los Angeles. Fabián and 
Julio started taking time from there 
own work schedule to train young-
sters. “When I was a teenager, the 
hero in the neighbourhood was very 
often the toughest bully, the most 
reknown thief, the one that took the 
most drugs”, Julio Jiménez recalls. 
“Now, those who decide to play in 
our team, those who choose to train 
and fulfill the Club’s requirements 
are respected,” he adds. 
With time, and thanks to its athletic 
successes and funding from several 
national and international organiza-
tions, the Club has developed sev-
eral other activities and now counts 
a variety of sports, a folkloric music 
group, a weaving workshop, a paint-
ing studio, a percussions group, a 
first aid health center as well as a 
legal center, which aims at facilitat-
ing access to legal support for the 
Paso del Rey community. In addi-
tion to the youth teams, housewives 
and retirees also take part in some 
of Defensores’ activities. And aspi-
rations do not end here: in a neigh-
borhood of 250.000 inhabitants 
with a single primary school where 
1.800 students are packed in three 
classrooms of 4, the Fundación has 
already purchased land in order to 
build an additional school this year.
Rumbo in South Africa 
in 2010
The recipe undeniably works: by 
the end of 2005 the South America 
Street Soccer final, promoted by 
UNICEF and UNDP, was played in 
the middle of the 9 de Julio Avenue 
- Buenos Aires’ main artery - while 
at the “Other World Cup” in Ger-
many this year, 22 teams from the 
five continents were present. But 
when it comes down to it, what is 
the difference between this type of 
soccer and the traditional eleven 
player soccer teams, with winners 
and losers? Matías who is a sec-
ond year student of Economics and 
a member of the Defensores team 
that participated in the Germany 
Street Soccer World Cup, has it all 
figured out: “In traditional soccer, 
competitiveness and interests at 
stake are such that it ends up gen-
erating more violence.” Those who 
witnessed the insults, head kick and 
expulsion, which took place dur-
ing the France-Italy final during the 
2006 World Cup in Germany know 
all too well that the facts unfor- 
tunately confirm Matias’ words.

T
                       thousands of adolescents dream of becoming sports stars. 
          more and more are deciding to use anabolic steroids to improve their chances. 
                   for 17-year-old taylor hooton, this decision eventually cost him his life.
dying 
to be Perfect
aylor Hooton of Texas (USA) was 
a popular boy who played on his 
school baseball team and did well 
in classes. But Taylor felt pressure 
to be even better. 
“When Taylor was 16, his base-
ball coach told him he needed to 
get bigger to move up in the team 
ranks,” his father, Don Hooton, re-
counts. The 6’ 2”, 180-pound young 
man saw only one option. “ 
Taylor started using anabolic ste-
roids in early 2003. His father im-
mediately noticed wild mood swings 
and took him to a psychiatrist. Soon, 
Taylor admitted to steroid use and 
promised to stop. Hooton and his 
wife thought they’d dodged a bullet, 
yet that summer Taylor stole a lap-
top computer. His parents decided 
to not allow him to drive his truck or 
hang out with friends for two weeks 
as a punishment. 
The following morning, Taylor 
begged his mother not to punish 
him. “Taylor came in and had a cou-
ple tears in his eyes,” says Houton. 
“But his mother didn’t budge.” 
“So he reached over and 
squeezed her hand, went upstairs 
and hanged himself.”
Pressure to be the best
Taylor is just one of hundreds of 
thousands of teens who abuse 
steroids. 
Steroids suppress the body’s 
ability to produce testosterone. 
When a user cycles off, it takes 
the body a few months to return to 
normal and severe depression can 
occur. 
There are no exact numbers on 
adolescent suicides related to ste-
roid withdrawal, but Hooton says 
it is not uncommon. “I’ve probably 
talked to two, three dozen par-
ents… the same exact thing that 
happened in our home happened 
to them, it’s usually violent.” 
“We live in a world… [where] it’s 
better to be a winner and to be at-
tractive. These drugs can help you 
in both,” says Dr. Charles Yesalis, 
an authority on teen steroid use at 
Penn State. 
According to , 500,000 to 
600,000 American high schoolers 
have used steroids. “Nobody takes 
500,000 to 600,000 
American high schoolers 
have used steroids, 
says Charles Yesali.

just one shot of steroids, so when I 
say a half a million kids, that means 
those kids have cycled on these 
drugs,” he says. 
The use of drugs to improve per-
formance or body image is a serious 
problem for teens around the 
globe. Frédéric Donzé of the World 
Anti-Doping Agency (WADA) 
notes that while there are no com-
prehensive international statistics, 
it is a serious problem. “No sport 
and no country are immune.” 
The accessibility of the drugs 
is also alarming. Dr. Lyle Micheli 
of Boston’s Children’s Hospital, 
found that teens obtain steroids at 
gyms. He says there is an under-
ground black market. and finding 
steroids over the internet is even 
easier. 
Many teens know that steroids 
are dangerous. But teens are of-
ten motivated to use them by the 
pressure to excel in sports or to 
look good. “Parents and coaches 
are putting too much pressure on 
young kids -- it’s overwhelming,” 
Yesalis says.
The marathon 
continues
According to a 2003 National 
Youth Risk Behaviour Survey, 
6.1% of young people in grades 
9-12 throughout the United States 
had tried steroids without a doc-
tor’s prescription. Hooton believes 
that education will lead to preven-
tion. “It goes from educating kids 
to know that this is a dangerous 
drug to educating parents like us.” 
But it is not so easy. Profes-
sional baseball players like Jose 
Canseco, Jason Giambi and 
Raphael Plameiro have used ste-
roids. Hooton reflects, “It’s back 
to role models. I don’t care what a 
professional baseball player is do-
ing… unless my 16 year old kid is 
looking up to him. …. [Kids think] 
‘if its ok for them, why isn’t it ok for 
me?’” 
Another pressure source: Ameri-
can universities offer scholar-
ships for sports excellence. Steve 
Abudato, an Emmy award-winning 
anchor in New York, writes 
“bigger, stronger and faster - (it’s) 
a perceived edge that may help 
them secure athletic scholarships 
to college, at the risk of destroying 
their bodies.” 
American schools are starting 
to catch on. New Jersey recently 
implemented high school steroids 
testing program. Proposals for 
such programs are cropping up 
across the United States.
Don Hooton says this is a good 
sign. “It wound up that you had 
this secret stuff going on amongst 
the kids. We know for a fact now, 
five out of the 15 boys on the team 
were doing steroids - it may have 
been as many as nine. As a soci-
ety, nobody seemed to be aware 
that this was going, and that it’s as 
dangerous as it is.”

 Key steroids 
dates
It may seem as 
though steroids are suddenly 
all over the news. In fact, 
they have been used 
by athletes for over 
half a century.
1935 – harles Kochakian, 
a graduate student  
at the University of Rochester  
in New York succeeds  
in isolating anabolic steroids. 
1940s – Steroids are used 
in limited quantities on  
recuperating soldiers wounded 
during the Second World War. 
1950s – Russian weightlifters

“They stole our souls 
and turned our bodies 
into mere objects.” 
Ines Geipel
                  east germany became a sporting powerhouse overnight at the 1972 olympic games 
                             and continued to dominate the international sports arena throughout 
                                      the 1970’s and 80’s. the secret to its success? 
               a state-sponsored doping programme that involved an estimated 10,000 athletes. 
doping for glory 
in east germany
East Germany’s sporting system was 
dubbed the “Miracle Machine” as 
the communist nation of 16 million 
people became an Olympic power 
to rival the Soviet Union and the 
United States of America which 
had populations 18 times bigger. 
But the country’s sports stars 
paid a high price for their remark-
able success. 
“They stole our souls and turned 
our bodies into mere objects,” says 
Ines Geipel, a former sprinter and 
long jumper. 
Geipel, and an estimated 10,000 
sportsmen and women like her, 
were victims of a comprehen-
sive state-sponsored doping pro-
gramme, forced to take steroids 
to allow them to train harder but 
which had dramatic side-effects. 
In the second half of its 35-year 
history, the German Democratic 
Republic consistently finished 
among the top three nations 
at summer and winter Olympic 
Games. 
There were suspicions about its 
medal haul for years, but it was 
only after the Berlin Wall fell in 
1989 and Germany was reunited 
a year later that athletes and swim-
mers came forward to admit that 
their achievements were fuelled by 
drugs. 
Many say they had no idea they 
were being given anabolic steroids 
by doctors; they were usually told 
the pills were vitamins. Secret 
files released after reunification 
showed that children as young as 
10 were given them.
Amazing physical 
transformations
The drugs, especially the infamous 
Oral-Turinabol steroid, altered muscle 
structure, caused voices to deepen 
and promoted male pattern hair 
growth and changes to genitalia. 
The most infamous case is Heidi 
Krieger, who won the European shot 
putt title in 1986. She was given so 
much male hormone to develop the 
muscles to excel in her discipline that 
by 1997 Heidi looked and felt like a 
man, and underwent an operation to

complete the sex change. Today she 
is known as Andreas Krieger. 
Other female athletes were ren-
dered infertile, while those who 
gave birth often had children with 
defects. 
Now some former sportswomen 
want their tainted records to be 
erased. 
Ines Geipel was part of the 4x100 
metres relay team of her club SC 
Motor Jena which set a national 
record time of 42.20 seconds in 
1984. It has never been beaten, 
but Geipel had her name removed 
from the record books and says 
the time should be wiped too. 
“That record is poisoned by dop-
ing,” she says. 
Petra Schneider, a swimmer who 
won a gold and a silver medal at 
the 1980 Moscow Olympics, has 
made a similar call because her 
performances were influenced by 
steroids. 
She describes her national record 
for the 400 metres individual med-
ley, which has stood for 24 years, 
as “a relic of the past”. “I want the 
record books to be wiped clean,” 
she says.
Results, 
but at what cost?
The goal of the doping programme 
was to show the supposed superior-
ity of the communist system through 
sporting glory. 
Until 1968, West German athletes 
outperformed their East German 
counterparts. The turnaround was 
dramatic. The East German regime 
began planning years in advance 
to spoil West Germany’s so-called 
coming-out party, the 1972 Munich 
Olympics. 
East Germany won 20 gold med-
als at those games, finishing third 
behind the Soviet Union and the 
USA and a significant seven golds 
ahead of West Germany.
East Germany was placed second 
in the medals’ table at the 1976 
Montreal Olympics with 40 gold 
medals, bettered only by the Soviet 
Union. Eleven of the golds came 
from athletics and 11 from swim-
ming and all but two of those win-
ners were women. 
It was also the second biggest 
medal winner at the 1980 Moscow 
Olympics, which was blighted by 
the US-led boycott. At the 1988 
Seoul Olympics, the East Germans 
finished second behind the Soviet 
Union, winning 37 golds. 
Some officials from the former East 
Germany claim that doping was not 
a major factor in its success and 
point to the fact that athletes from 
the country continued to win medals 
even when part of the united Ger-
man team. 
But criminal trials and research, es-
pecially that done by Professor Wer-
ner Franke and Brigitte Berendonk, 
have shown that organized doping 
was a crucial element of the system. 
In 2000, Manfred Ewald, East Ger-
many’s most senior sports official, 
and Manfred Höppner, the head of 
its sports medicine service, were 
given suspended jail sentences of 
22 months and 18 months respec-
tively for their part in the doping pro-
gramme. 
And in September last year, 193 
former East German sportsmen and 
women were each awarded com-
pensation of 10,400 euros by the 
German state for being forced to 
take drugs. 
The Interior Minister of Germany at 
the time, Otto Schily, said: “It is al-
most impossible to compensate for 
the physical and mental suffering 
they endured.”

                              maria mutola’s childhood dreams of becoming a football star 
                                   were dashed because she was female. not one to give up, she switche
                         sports and eventually became an olympic gold medalist in athleticism.
maria mutola
the running wonder from mozambique
s a young girl, Maria Mutola was 
more interested in playing foot-
ball than studying. She would fre-
quently skip class to go kick the 
ball with the boys from her poor 
neighborhood in the outskirts of 
Maputo (Mozambique). 
Maria had a remarkable talent for 
dribbling, running fast and scor-
ing goals, and -- despite her par-
ents’ opposition -- she dreamed of 
becoming a professional football 
player. “One day, when I was 14 
or 15 years old”, she recalls, “the 
coach of the Aguia d’Ouro foot-
ball club was passing through my 
neighborhood and, after watching 
me play for a while, invited me to 
join his team.” 
Maria’s participation in the city’s 
football championship was a 
great success, but widely con-
tested by the other teams. “Being 
the only female player brought 
me a lot of problems, but I always 
tried to just concentrate on play-
ing good football.” 
Aguia d’Ouro went on to win the 
city’s championships in 1987, but 
the losing team in the final filed a 
formal complaint to FIFA against 
the use of a female player in of-
ficial competitions. 
FIFA allowed Mutola’s team 
to keep the trophy. But the 15-
year old was nevertheless dev-
astated, as she understood that 
she would never be allowed to 
pursue a career as a professional 
football player. 
What she didn’t know was that 
this episode would not be the 
end, but merely the beginning of 
an extraordinary journey in the 
world of sport.
“We have so many great athletes, 
“Being the only female player 
brought me a lot 
of problems, but I always tried 
to just concentrate 
on playing good football.”

but we have a culture that doesn’t 
support sports. I had to send her to 
America because that was where 
she would improve the most.” - 
José Craveirinha
From football 
to athletics
Maria’s ordeal made the headlines 
and grabbed the attention of José 
Craveirinha, Mozambique’s most 
renowned poet and a passionate 
athletics fan. After watching her 
play football, he knew she had the 
potential to be a great runner. He 
gave her a pair of training shoes 
and introduced her to his son 
Stélio, a track and field coach. 
“My first training with Stélio didn’t 
go very well,” remembers Maria. “I 
wasn’t used to running so much, 
and after that session I couldn’t 
even sit down. I didn’t show up to 
practice for a whole week!” 
But Craveirinha didn’t give up on 
her. “The Poet came to my house,” 
Mutola says. “He convinced my 
parents that athletics could open a 
lot of doors for me.” 
Craveirinha was right. Just a few 
months after her first workout, 
Maria Mutola won a silver medal 
in the 800m at the 1988 African 
Championships. That same year, 
she represented Mozambique at 
the Seoul Olympic Games. 
In 1990, she won a scholarship 
from the International Olympic 
Committee to study and train in 
the USA. “It is truly a sad thing,” 
Craveirinha said at the time, “We 
have so many great athletes, but 
we have a culture that doesn’t sup-
port sports. I had to send her to 
America because that was where 
she would improve the most.” 
Throughout the 90s, Maria Mu-
tola became one of the world’s 
elite track athletes, dominating the 
800m, 1000m and 1500m in ma-
jor championships. 
Her crowning achievement came 
at the 2000 Sydney Olympics, 
when she brought home Mozam-
bique’s first ever Olympic gold in 
the 800m. 
In 2003, she was awarded the 
world’s biggest prize in athletics, 
a one million dollar jackpot for 6 
consecutive wins in the Golden 
League competitions of the Inter-
national Association of Athletics 
Federations. 
That same year, Maria was 
appointed Youth Emissary for 
the United Nations Development 
Programme, in recognition of her 
outstanding career in athletics.
The Mutola 
Foundation
After almost 20 years of dedica-
tion to athletics, Maria believes she 
still has a lot to do for sport. That 
is why she has created the Maria 
Mutola Foundation, which funds 
education and athletics for under-
privileged children. 
Since 2001, the Foundation has 
permitted over 30 Mozambican 
young athletes to participate in 
international competitions. It also 
works on the integration of sport 
and other socio-cultural activities 
in school curricula, and is planning 
the construction of a professional 
training centre in Maputo. 
“All kids in Mozambique should be 
able to have a Craveirinha in their 
lives,” says Maria Mutola, “some-
one who believes in their talent 
and is willing to support them. 
That’s what my foundation is for.” 
Three years ago, the Mutola Foun-
dation sent Carina Pinto to study 
and train in the USA. “She now 
attends the New York University 
and will graduate in two years”, 
Maria says with pride. “The day 
she receives her diploma will be a 
great victory for me”. 
At 34, Maria Mutola is a national 
hero and one of Maputo’s avenues 
has recently been named after her. 
When asked about her legacy, she 
says humbly “I am proud that my 
program is now helping so many 
young athletes. All I want is for kids 
to understand, like I did 25 years 
ago, that the combination of edu-
cation and sport can be the key to 
success.”

Women  
in the Olympics
he first modern Olympic Games 
in 1896 were not open to women. 
However, 19 athletes participated 
in the next Olympiad, held in Paris 
in 1900, representing a modest 
1.6% of the total participants. 
It was not until the 1970s 
when the presence of women 
made a significant increase.

The Courier looks back
since it began publication, the unesco courier  
has devoted articles and issues to various aspects of sport. 
here is a glimpse at some of them:
Issues
the competitive world of sport
December 1992 
Sport has become synonymous with top-flight 
competition, rather than a form of play and a means 
of education. This competition has resulted from 
excessive concentration on a limited number 
of spectacular events, a process which has in turn 
exposed sport to ever-greater attention 
from business and the media. 
people at play 
may 1991 
The amount of importance attached to spontaneous 
play can tell us much about the basic features 
of a culture. In industralized societies, games 
and sports are often at the mercy of the profit motive, 
but other societies have been more successful 
at preserving the innocence of play. 
fair play and the amateur in sport 
January 1964  
Baron Pierre de Coubertin revived the Olympic 
Games in modern times. A hundred years after 
his birth in 1863, this issue assesses his crusade 
to dignify and invigorate sport, to make it 
independent and adapt it for its educational role 
in today’s world.
Articles
Tim Crabbe, who lectures in sport sociology 
at Britain’s Sheffield Hallam University, presents 
two articles on the problem of racism in European 
football matches.
“garlic, knives and banners: 
football’s racist faces” 
november 2000 
“a tricolour triumph?” 
november 2000 
“the spell of sport” 
april 1999
This dossier offers two roles of sport: as an escape 
route from discrimination for women, the disabled, 
ethnic minorities and the poor and as an outlet 
and crucible for national, religious 
and intercommunity conflicts.
