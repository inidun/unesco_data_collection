Only about one sixth of the world's
populationsome 400 million people,
living in 20 countrieshave relatively
high living standards with sufficient of
the right foods to eat each day. More
than half of the remaining 2,000 million
human beings never obtain enough good
food for health and growth and full
physical vigour. The problem of "Food
and Health" is the theme of this year's
World Health Day. (See below).
Denmark © Pa"1 Almasy 19 57.
Without enough of the right kinds of food, nobody
can be healthy. This simple truth holds the
explanation of much of the misery from which
mankind suffers. A vicious circle has arisen poor health
impairs productive capacity; low production of foodstuffs
brings under-nutrition, sickness, less productive power.
Health means more than simply the absence of disease
and infirmity, and enough food does not mean just
sufficient to maintain life. Lack of essential food makes
itself felt at the very least by general debility, slackening
of initiative, and reduced resistance to disease.
The rapidly-developing science of nutrition has now
established just how much of different kinds of food is
necessary for health. A good deal is known also about in
what particular ways the food eaten every day in many
parts of the world falls short of man's requirements. This
is only a beginning, however, and there remain many
problems to solve before it can be claimed that the
world's food is really serving the world's health needs.
To provide food for under-nourished peoples in ade¬
quate quantity, vast efforts in both production and dis¬
tribution are required. These are problems with far-
reaching economic implications.
Even where staple foods are available in fair quantities,
malnutrition very often still exists because certain essen¬
tials (proteins, vitamins, etc.) are not present in the right
quantities. This lack of the right foods for health is an
even greater difficulty than shortage of staple foods, for
it involves not only assuring necessary supplies, but also
bringing the community to understand and accept the
advantages of using them.
In the case of certain of the deficiency diseases such as
beri-beri, rickets or kwashiorkor, it is fairly easy to dem¬
onstrate the advantages of a properly balanced diet.
However, many of the beneficial effects are less evident,
and make themselves felt as a gradual improvement in
health and well-being, especially among children. The
difficulty is that people do not easily forsake food habits
and beliefs that are a part of their cultural or religious
heritage simply because somebody comes along and tells
them that, perhaps for generations, they have been eating
the wrong things or not eating the right ones.
As well as the evils that arise from shortage and pov¬
erty, there. are the problems of plenty. Surplus produc¬
tion in some parts of the world cannot, for economic
reasons, always be used to compensate for shortages in
other places. Where food is abundant, moreover, there
are very real health dangers from overeating, particularly
of certain fatty foods which are now believed to predis¬
pose to disease of the heart and the blood vessels.
As countries become more highly organized, economic¬
ally and socially, the use of preserved foods and large-
scale food processing tends to become more common,
aggravating the risks of widespread food-borne infections
and food poisoning.
It is, I think, clear that the relationship between food
and health has become a very close and intricate one, and
that we can no longer let ourselves be guided simply by
the customs and beliefs of earlier generations. There is
no area of the world, no country and no culture which
today can afford to neglect the scientific teaching now
available on nutrition, food values, and the techniques of
producing and processing food.
World Health Day, April 7, 1957, will, I hope, serve as an
occasion for people and governments everywhere to think
seriously about this situation.

<![CDATA[
U.N. faces the question :
NEED WE GO
HUNGRY?
by Professor
André Mayer
I remember in 1939 a certain well-known person saying
to me: "The idea of organizing nutrition on a scien¬
tific basis is a wonderful one, but it is a dream." Six
months later war broke out and put to the test all the
ideas that had been advanced in this field some years
earlier by the League of Nations.
In the case of nutrition, the results were striking in
countries like Great Britain where it was possible to
organize feeding scientifically. Despite all the upheaval
caused by the war, infant mortality fell to lower levels
than any that had previously been recorded. On the other
hand, France, occupied, held to ransom, and devastated,
had just the reverse experience.
In the case of agriculture, the problem, even for a highly
equipped country, was how and with what speed a well-
managed agriculture could adapt itself to a "nutritional
planning." The United States decided to feed an addi¬
tional 40 million people in the forces and in the liberated
countries, and it succeeded in doing so in less than two
years by increasing its agricultural output by one-third.
At the same time, the prices of rational foodstuffs were so
fixed that wages were sufficient to cover "the cost of
living." Thus a veritable social experiment in a large
industrialized nation showed how sound were the estimates
that could be based on the new knowledge.
The results were such that people began to wonder if
what was done during the war and for war purposes could
not also be done when peace was restored and for the
maintenance of peace. It was this thought, in fact, that
gave birth to the idea of setting up the Food and Agri¬
culture Organization (Fao) and then the World Health
Organization (Who).
To what then was this undeniable impact of the war
due? A modern war, as the last two have taught us,
brings into play all the forces of society. In that sense
Professor André Mayer, an eminent French doctor and scientist, was
one of the founders of the U.N. Food and Agriculture Organization, with
which he became so closely identified that he was often refvrred to as
"Mr. FAO". Professor Mayer tackled FAO problems with a particular in¬
terest, not only as a nutritionist, but as an internationalist, because, as he
once said, "every effort to outline a plan for social rehabilitation 're¬
considering' agriculture as a whole." He died on May 27, 1956. This
article is taken from his inaugural lecture at a nutritionists' training course
organized at Marseilles in 1955 by the French Government, FAO and the
World Health Organization.
they were "total wars." Total war can be conducted only
if all social activities are completely mobilized. Such
mobilization rests on plans and the plans in turn on
estimates and calculations which are only possible if much
is known about the society.
Some early surveys of diet and state of nutrition were
associated with the work of the League of Nations at
Geneva. The aim was to determine nutritional status in
the more advanced countries. The results were astonish¬
ing. In the southern states of the U.S.A. pellagra was
killing more people than tuberculosis; in parts of Great
Britain, 90 per cent of the children had mild signs of
rickets; and in France, obvious manifestations of mal¬
nutrition were found in certain social groups.
No sooner had Fao been set up than it was faced with
a threat of world famine. As it was bound to do in the
circumstances, the Organization launched the first survey
of world food supplies, based on all the documentation
that governments, research institutions and financial
groups could provide. This survey excited great universal
interest. It drew attention to a situation about which, in
fact, people had only very vague ideas, and which, perhaps,
no great attempt had been made to bring to light. It
revealed an amazing inequality in the amount of foodstuffs
available to human beings.
There are in this world some 2,500,000,000 human beings
grouped into societies and into some 80 nations that
have monopolized the dry land but, fortunately for the
future, have left undisturbed for the most part the
freedom of the seas. Of some 13,500,000,000 hectares,
these nations make use of that part which is arable land,
grass land or forest land. They cultivate only 8 per cent
of the total land area.
Ten years ago it was shown that Western Europe, which
comprises 3 per cent of the total world land area and 15
per cent of the world's population, produces almost one-
third of the world's food. Add the U.S.S.R. and North
America, and one-third of mankind consumes three-
quarters of the food produced in the world. Asia, with
almost half the world's population, has available only 17
per cent of the world's food. What is more,
the situation in different parts of one and
the same country may be quite dissimilar.
Fao's first survey has shown that the food
available to two-thirds of mankind provides
less than 2,750 calories per capita; for half

mankind, less than 2,250; in addition, the composition of
the diets which yield this low amount of calories is
defective.
This means that the various countries are not equally
capable of feeding their people, or of feeding them well.
Ability to nourish its members is, therefore, one of the
characteristics of a society, an important social fact.
It is associated with another social fact. Within
different nations different social groups are not equally
well fed. The extent of this disparity is also a social
characteristic. We must remember too that the daily
food intake of these groups differs as much in composi¬
tion as in quantity. Diet, therefore, raises a social prob¬
lem in one sense of the term, that of the inequality of
men in the face of the same need for food. What is
important and more significant still, it raises a social
question in the first sense of the term "social", that of
social behaviour and structure.
Inequality in the matter of food is not the only in¬
equality between people of different countries, or in one
and the same country. There is another, and a serious
one, of which the doctors are aware. It is inequality in
the matter of health. This is strikingly reflected in the
mortality statistics for both children and adults. Such a
state of affairs can be expressed in several ways. For
instance, we can calculate statistically the life expectancy
of a newborn child, and we find
that it ranges between about 27
years in India and 67 years in the
United States. A person, therefore,
has a longer or shorter life, accord¬
ing to whether he happens to have
been born in one country or another,
and a more or less full life and a
life more or less unimpaired by
sickness and disease. It is said that
until recently one-quarter of the
population of India suffered from
malaria. This entails millions of
hours of painful inactivity. That
then is a second inequality between
nations and between groups within
a nation; it has been called "in¬
equality in the face of death." It is
a second characteristic of societies.
Worthy of note is the fact that
the countries with most sickness
and disease are also those with the
poorest health services. They have,
practically speaking, no doctors. In
France there is one doctor for every
1,600 inhabitants. In Ethiopia one
for every 176,000. Situations like
this exist because in some countries
education is open to all while in others the majority of
people are illiterate. But these three characteristics of
nations and of societies are not the only ones by which
they can be differentiated and defined. Nations are not
all equally capable of producing foodstuffs. What has
been called the "productivity index" for foodstuffs differs
widely from country to country.
Comparisons between societies show that the lower the
income the higher the proportion of the income spent on
food. Again, the quality of the diet depends largely on
income. In a poor nation or group, the diet will contain
less meat or milk than in a wealthy group. Plant foods
are obtained directly from the earth, while livestock feed
on plants which they convert into meat or milk at a high
cost in terms of calories; consequently meat and milk
are expensive foods, sometimes inaccessible to the poor.
In the case of milk, this can be serious.
But it is not only in respect of food that productivity
varies widely in different countries. This is reflected in
the cash value of annual national per capita production,
which is as much as $770.00 in the U.S.A. and as low as
$20.00 in India. There are thus relatively rich and rela¬
tively poor nations just as there are within the nations
relatively rich and relatively poor groups. Significantly,
when countries are classified according to income, pro¬
ductivity, the quality and quantity of food resources, the
life span of people, health and education, it is invariably
the same countries that are at the top or at the bottom
of the scale. Thus the characteristics enumerated here
are not associated by chance. They are inter-related,
and indeed interdependent. Curiously enough, this inter¬
dependence is reflected in the social structure itself.
In countries with a low per capita income almost all

human labour is devoted to the production and processing
of food. Conversely, in countries with higher income, an
increasingly small part of the population is engaged in
agriculture. The reasons for this are that in the latter
people know how to manage the land and the crops, and
how to use chemical fertilizers for the enrichment of the
soil; that they protect livestock and plants against pests
and breed better types; that they make farm machinery,
which either eases man's work or does it for him.
All this implies an existing well developed industry. In
such countries industrial products are exchanged for agri¬
cultural products. This presupposes transport facilities
and organized marketing services. The improvement of
agricultural techniques Is accompanied by the estab¬
lishment of technical, financial and administrative ser¬
vices. The division of labour among men changes; tasks
are divided up among them. Society is organized diffe¬
rently; the social structure is in fact transformed.
Statistics show that the distribution of the working popu¬
lation over the various types of economic activity, for
example agriculture and industry, is not the same in rich
as in poor countries. It is evident from any study of
them that the wealthier the society, the more complex
is its pattern, and vice versa.
Just as man himself is a single whole and his activities
are interdependent, so the activities of every society are
interdependent. The satisfaction of
hunger is a primordial one. It is
not, however, an activity inde¬
pendent of. other factors. It is
conditioned by the social structure,
on which in turn it has an impact.
As a result, human diets cannot be
modified or changed without at
some point impinging upon the
social structure itself. Not only
technical questions are involved but
also social issues.
Expectation of life and the in¬
cidence of disease differ widely
from one country to another. There
are many other related differences.
Children may be healthy and attain
a healthy adult life, or many of
them may die prematurely. The
diet may be good in quantity and
quality, or it may be the reverse.
People may be well clothed and
housed, or the opposite. They may
be engaged in productive work
which is not too arduous, or in heavy
work which gives low returns. They
may have opportunities for material
and social advancement because
they are well educated, or such opportunities may be
closed to them. Great inequality among nations and
within a nation is a feature of our world today.
However, I think we can safely say that something can
be done to remedy this situation. Countries at the bottom
of the scale are not intrinsically different from those at
the top. Life expectancy in India until recently was 27
years; in France, on the eve of the Revolution, it was 26
years. Infantile mortality was higher in Lille in 1848
than it is today in Bombay. Famine killed 5 percent of
the French population in 1770.
Until our day, technical progress spread but slowly.
There were all kinds of obstacles to communications
between countries, and many societies were completely cut
off from the others. Thousands of years were needed for
the use of stone instruments or bronze or iron to spread
throughout the world. And some societies today are still
in the Stone Age !
One of the consequences of technical progress is the
growing speed of communications. This has brought
nations closer together. But what is more serious, it has
made it possible for nations to involve all the other peoples
of the world in their wars. Not only our inventions, but
also our ways of thinking and our ways of doing things
have reached them. They have thus become conscious of
their poverty and been led to follow in our footsteps. We
have begun to help them and in so doing have started a
movement which, even if we wanted to, we cannot stop.
This raises a tremendous problem. It is nothing less
than that of directing the development of all mankind an
unprecedented undertaking and one from which we cannot
draw back. In fact, we must even speed up that develop-

ment; and one of the reasons for this illustrates the
interdependence of social activities.
For our own safety, as much as for that of others, we
must control communicable diseases, which are no respec¬
ters of national boundaries. Naturally Who and Unicef,
whose concern this is, are conducting campaigns against
such diseases and all other diseases; and they are doing so
with remarkable success. They are driving back the
spectre of death. But, by the same token, they are
contributing to a rapid increase in the population of the
world. If more children survive, if more adults live
longer, how are they to be fed? This is where the eco¬
nomists evoke the shade of Malthus.
Malthus will be right only if we fail to act. But we must
act quickly faster than the population increases; other¬
wise, what will happen to these millions of starving, miser¬
able people? History teaches us the danger of poverty
when poverty has become conscious of itself. We must,
therefore, resolutely pursue our task.
Let us not be deceived by words as to its nature. It is
not merely a technical undertaking, as might appear from
the name given to the assistance in developing countries.
It is much more than that.
We, too, have our under-developed areas, but our peoples
have learned that if technical progress Is to continue to
contribute to an expanding economy and a fuller life, it Is
in the interest of all to raise the standard of living of the
whole population, and not only of a part of it. Again, the
cumulative and universal nature of science and technology
makes it necessary to recognize a community of interests
not bounded by natural frontiers. Whether they wish to
or not, the countries of the world are becoming inter¬
dependent. They must ¿help one another, as their
individual citizens have helped each other. Such mutual
assistance is being organized under many names. Basi¬
cally, however, it is mutual assistance.
This movement raises a tremendous problem of world
dimensions. But whether a problem is narrowly defined or
is apparently unmeasurable, it is never well to tackle it
unsystematically. This particular one cannot be left at
the mercy of immediate political and economic considera¬
tions. We know that it is international, that it involves
all the activities of nations. It must, therefore, be dealt
with by international action, joint and simultaneous
action for the satisfaction of all man's basic needs. An
extraordinary adventure has begun, one of the most
splendid and astounding that men have ever embarked
upon in all their history.

The Unesco Courier. April 1957
ï: Tal WHERE DID THEY COME FROM?
The migration of birds and animals is regarded as one
of nature's great wonders. Less well known, but
equally fascinating, are the facts of plant migration.
Plants "'nature's paralytics", as one botanist has called
them have managed to girdle the globe, using the winds
and the waters and sometimes travelling as "'stowaways"
on men and animals. Innumerable kinds of grains from
different lands have crossed the oceans, some of them
carried by birds, as was the pimento, which found a home
in Jamaica. There have been organized plant migrations
too, when nomad peoples, scientific missions, merchants
and colonists took seeds with them to ensure their
food supplies or to start new industries.
Today, we can almost speak of a "'universalization" of
cultivation as more and more plants are made to grow
fruitfully far from their lands of origin. The ancient and
historical associations of globetrotting plants are revealed
in this Alphabet of some of the more common foodstuffs,
showing their places of origin and the areas where they
are widely produced today.
AUBERGINE (egg
plant) India. During
the Middle Ages the
plant was brought from
India to Africa, from
where it reached Spain.
Today cultivated in the
warmer parts of Europe
and the U.S.A.
BARLEY Arabia,
Mount Sinai, Caucasus.
It was from the Cau¬
casus that the cultivation
of barley spread
throughout Central Eur¬
ope. In the 16th cen¬
tury it was still Europe's
chief bread material.
COCOA Mexico.
The beans of the cacao
tree were originally used
to make an aromatic
drink called xocoatl and
were also employed as
currency by the Aztecs.
In the early 16th century
the Spaniards introduced
it into their country,
launching, around 1520,
the fashion of drinking
"chocolate", a practice
which spread to France
in the following century.
Until the First World
War, Europe received most of its supplies from Venezuela
and Ecuador. Today, the main cocoa producing countries
are Ghana and the Ivory Coast.
COFFEE Ethiopia. The coffee tree was introduced
into Arabia from Ethiopia about the 14th century. Coffee
was known in Venice around 1570 and in Marseilles in
1660. The first establishment "'for the drinking of coffee"
the famous Cafe Procopio which later became a fav¬
ourite meeting place for Fontenelle, Voltaire and Diderot
was opened in Paris in 1672. From France, coffee
travelled to the West Indies in 1716. The Dutch
introduced it into South America, and Brazil became the
chief producer of coffee. The great city of Sao Paulo
owes its development to this fact, and its port, Santos, is
now the "coffee capital" of the world.
CORN (Maize) South America. According to the Swiss
botanist, De Candolle, Indian corn, or maize, originated in
the region which today includes Ecuador and Columbia.
It is also said to have come from Florida. Whatever the
truth of the matter, Spain and England were the first
European countries to use it as a food, early in the six¬
teenth century.
HARICOTS (French beans) Mexico, Central and
South America. From these places, Italian navigators
COCOA BEANS from the cacao trees grown on the coastal lowlands are
the major crop of Ecuador, one of the world's principal producer countries.
Some years ago it was still the practice to dry the beans on the streets of Gua¬
yaquil, Ecuador's chief port (above). Today there is far too much traffic.
carried the plant to Rome where Pope Clement VII
blessed it and gave it his special protection. In 1556 it
was being grown in pots in several parts of Italy, and in
the same century it was introduced to France by Catherine
de Medici, wife of the French King Henry II.
MANIOC (Cassava) Amazon Region. The Indians of
South America found they could eliminate the hydrocyanic
(prussic) acid in this root plant by boiling it, thus making
it completely edible. Today's largest producer is Mada¬
gascar which exports large quantities in its commercial
form as tapioca.
OLIVES. Greece and Asia Minor. Cultivated since
pre-historic times in Asia Minor, the olive spread very
early to all Mediterranean countries. The olive branch
has been a symbol of peace since before Christian times
(oil can cure human ills and calm troubled waters).
PEANUT (groundnut). Brazil, and the West Indies
(where it is called mani) and Peru (where it was given
the name inchic). The Spaniards who reached Mexico
in the 15th century con¬
fused the peanut with
the beans of the cacao
tree (cacahuatl). The
plant soon reached Asia
and Africa. It was first
used as a food in France
after 1801, thanks to the
efforts of Louis Bona¬
parte who learned to
appreciate its qualities
while he was ambassador
in Madrid. Today India
heads world production
and cultivates a total of
2,050,000 acres.
POTATO. South
American Andes regions
(Columbia, Ecuador,
Peru, Chili). The Span¬
iards introduced the
plant into Galacia in the
16th century, while
Francis Drake did the
same in England. Sir
Walter Raleigh had it
planted in Virginia and
in Ireland. The French
were slow to adopt it as
a food, preferring the
Jerusalem artichoke
(still called topinambour
in France from the
Topinambou Indians of
Brazil where the plants
where first discovered). Two centuries later the efforts
of Parmentier to develop potatoes as a staple food in
France were successful.
SPINACH. Persia. Long used as a potherb, it was
introduced into Europe in the 15th century. Today one
of the largest producers is the U.S.A.
SUGAR CANE. Bengal, Siam, Indonesia. India was
already producing cane sugar 600 years before the Christ¬
ian era. In the 7th century the sugar cane was imported
into North Africa, then, in 996 A.D., into Venetia, which
obtained a monopoly of the product. Spain developed
sugar plantations in its New World territories, and by
the 18th century, Cuba, the West Indies and Santo
Domingo became the leading producers of sugar cane.
After the First World War, Cuba and the West Indies were
producing 4,000,000 tons a year.
TOMATO. Mexico. This plant, known in Mexico as
the tomaltl, began to be grown in Spain, Portugal and
Italy in the 16th century. It was not cultivated in France
and North Africa (leading grower today) until 1785.
WHEAT. Mesopotamia. From here this grain tra¬
velled throughout the ancient world, and reached America
with the caravels of Columbus. Today the greatest pro¬
ducers are the U.S.A. and the U.S.S.R. (See page 32).

One man's meat
is another
man's... taboo
by Alfred Métraux
No civilization makes the best possible use of the food
resources at its disposal. Before any kind of fruit,
vegetable or meat is pronounced as fit to eat by a
particular people, it must first be approved for the pur¬
pose by that people's cultural traditions. These tastes
and distastes, which differ so widely among the various
civilizations, have always been a source of indignation,
contempt or sneering, and were almost certainly a prime
subject of conversation in the caves of Palaeolithic man.
Even in prehistoric times, peoples were undoubtedly
graded according to their eating habits. Poetically, the
best known instance of this is the Odyssey, where the
"bread-eaters" (the Greeks) were ranged against the
barbarians, who were "lotus-eaters," or even eaters of
human flesh.
Exotic peoples provide us with a wealth of examples
to illustrate the infinite diversity of human taste. To eat
a caterpillar, even if roasted, appears to us as the height
of perversion ; but in sub-tropical America the native
populations, and even visiting ethnographers, do not turn
up their noses at the grubs which they extract from the
trunks of palm trees. A village of Indians is overjoyed
at the arrival of a flight of ants which can be cooked in
the pot. And those who are nauseated by this human
consumption of insects would do well to remember that
these same Indians would be literally ill if they were
forced to eat a hen's egg, or even chicken. Rats, of course,
are "siege food" ; yet they were a delicacy for certain
Polynesians, though the latter, it is true, had no rabbits
to feed on. And we should not forget how fond the Aztecs
were of small dogs, which they fattened for banquets.
Even peoples who are neighbours and belong to the
same civilization can so differ, in their feeding habits,
as to cause mutual incomprehension and even disgust.
The appellation "frog-eaters," which the English have for
so long applied to the French, is an eloquent indication
of the formers' opinion of batracians as a source of food.
When Kamehameha I, King of Hawaii, broke with his
ancestors' feeding taboos in the presence of his Court,
he was only equalling, in courage and stark determination,
the present-day American who, in Paris, resolves to eat
his first plate of Burgundy snails.
Certain feeding taboos of a religious origin take the
form of an aversion which has all the strength and
spontaneity of an instinct. I have known anthropologists
who, though quite unprejudiced and aware of the histori¬
cal background involved, have never been able to over-
10
come the feeling of disgust created in them by some food
or other that was forbidden to their ancestors.
The classic example of the influence of cultural tradi¬
tion on feeding is the divergence in the attitudes of the
stock raising populations of Asia and Europe with regard
to the use of milk products. Whereas the peoples of
Central and South Asia, as well as the Indo-European
and Semitic groups, have always consumed the milk pro¬
duced by their flocks and herds, often as a basic source
of food, the Chinese, the Japanese and the peoples of
South East Asia who were formerly, likewise, stock rais¬
ers have always had the most violent aversion to milk
and its by-products.
This aversion cannot have stemmed from ignorance,
since the Chinese were long in contact with Mongol and
Turkish tribes for whom milk and milk foods were basic
forms of nourishment. The Tibetans even go so far as
to put rancid butter in their tea.
Various books published in recent years have revealed
to us the hunger that still "'stalks the world." We know
that vast areas lack adequate food, and that the general
health of their populations suffers in consequence. In¬
ternational bodies, such as the Food and Agriculture
Organization, are trying to increase the food resources of
regions whose inhabitants have not enough to eat.
Unfortunately, the introduction of new types of crops
does not always suffice to solve these problems. The im¬
portant thing is that the people should accept the new
dishes which are set before them, and rid themselves of
the emotional prejudices making for their rejection. Most
human beings "like what they eat" rather than "'eat what
they like." But how is one to break down this resistance
which, rooted in cultural tradition and developed in early
childhood, ends by acquiring the apparent strength of
an instinctive reaction?
This was exactly the problem which the United States
Government had to face during the last war. It had to
plan feeding, not only for an immense army, but for
millions of workers, as well as for the liberated peoples.
Farmers might produce a surplus, but it was important
to avoid waste and to pursuade a population, that had
always lived well, to change some of its habits.
The United States Government was wise enough to
consult social scientists before embarking on a propa¬
ganda campaign designed to win public opinion over to
the various measures which were required. It set up a

THE SUPERMARKET.
Food is piled high in the
great supermarkets of
America where customers
serve themselves and pay
(far left) on the way out.
The 18,000 fully-fledged
supermarkets in the U.S.A.
and the 70,000 smaller
stores known as " supe¬
rettes " now sell half the
country's groceries. Shop¬
ping in the supermarket
has become a weekly ritual
of American family life.
Many supermarkets buy
meats, vegetables, eggs and
other products directly
from farmers. Left, chick¬

however, people still shop

tal of Colombia, (below).

committee of ethnographers, psychologists and sociolo¬
gists, to study Americans' attitudes towards food and to
suggest methods whereby those attitudes could be modi¬
fied or even completely transformed. It was as part of
this Committee's activities that the American psycholo¬
gist Curt Lewin was able to carry out certain experiments
in influencing opinion, experiments which have often been
cited as a brilliant demonstration of the effectiveness of
these disciplines when applied in the practical field.
Curt Lewin proceeded from the principle that a "food
attitude" as simple as the American's aversion to certain
parts of meat the heart, the kidneys, the lungs, the en¬
trails could be quickly changed, once every implication
of the situation had been analysed accurately and in de¬
tail, provided that every factor directly or indirectly de¬
termining people's behaviour towards food was considered.
Having established beyond any doubt that in the matter
of food it was the housewives whose influence was para¬
mount and who had the last word, he selected two groups
of housewives as the voluntary "guinea-pigs" of the ex¬
periment. One group was indoctrinated by expert diet¬
icians who gave lectures in order to explain the nutritive
qualities of offal, its high vitamin content, and its good
effect on health. This was followed up by explanations
regarding the refined nature of the dishes that could be
prepared with such pieces of meat; and recipes for cook¬
ing and dressing offal were distributed to the housewives.
The method adopted with the other group was quite
different. A meeting was organized, at which one member
of the group explained to the others the difficulties of the
country's food situation, impressed upon them that by
serving offal to their husbands they would be performing
a patriotic service, and finally invited them to engage in
a free discussion of the problem of "taboo" meats and
their use. Care was taken to ensure that the discussion
was general and that each housewife was able to express
her doubts and ask questions. At the end of the debate,
the meeting took a collective decision: each housewife
undertook to try out the recipes suggested.
A few weeks later, an investigation revealed that only
10% of those present at the lectures had "'crossed this
cooking Rubicon." Of those, however, who had taken part
in the discussions and undertaken to prepare offal, 51 %
had duly fulfilled their undertaking. The same experi¬
ment was repeated several times, with regard to other
types of food "rejects." And the results, too, were the
same. Lectures and exhortations had therefore been of
little effect as compared with decisions freely taken by a
group, even a group as artificial as that constituted by
subjects in a psychological experiment.
This shows us that in our "'food attitudes," as indeed
in all our attitudes, reason combines with other emotional
factors to which the greatest regard must be paid if an
attitude is to be modified. The housewives who decided
to break with the "feeding taboos" agreed to do so purely
because they were influenced by considerations having but
a tenuous and indirect connexion with food itself.
For an attitude to be transformed, the values and
institutions that give it its stability must be kept in mind.
As was shown in the above example, it is by collective
decision that attitudes can most easily be changed.

THESE COOKS DID NOT
SPOIL THE BROTH
by Claude Levi-Strauss

'TELL ME WHAT YOU EAT and I will tell you what you are", wrote Brillât-Savarin, the French gastronomist. The art of cooking has built
up countless melodies on a universal theme from a savoury stew bubbling on a stove in Morocco to the gastronomic masterpiece of a Paris chef.
If, as has been said, the art of
cooking is to combine the flavours
of different foodstuffs so as to
blend or to bring out their contrasts,
the process sounds simple enough to
have been discovered by any one of
the world's peoples. Yet this is not
the case. It is not possible to com¬
bine different ingredients unless they
are easily and simultaneously to
hand nor can their flavours be ming¬
led and harmonized without a know¬
ledge of cooking that goes further
than the mere heating of food.
Even the method of boiling food
in an earthenware pot is not univer¬
sally employed. Some peoples, who
have no pottery, bring food to the
boil by putting it into a vessel made
of wood or bark filled with water and
than dropping in heated stones. To
other peoples, boiling is not known at
all; they dig ovens in the ground and
line them with hot stones, the food
roasting slowly between layers of
green leaves which give off moisture.
Yet another method is to use the food
as its own container, by stuffing the
animal's body, or a flour-paste, with a
12
mixture which cooks while this outer
cover grills or roasts.
All these methods represent dis¬
coveries to which the human race
attained only gradually. Even now
certain very primitive tribes, like the
Nambikwara of Central Brazil, just
thrust the food they kill or gath¬
er (small animals and wild root-
vegetables) indiscriminately into hot
embers. The ashes that stick to it
provide the necessary mineral salts.
This primitive cooking is fatal to the
sense of taste, for the palates of the
Nambikwara cannot cope with any
strong stimulus; they have a horror
of salt, and even of hot food; when
I offered them a boiled and boiling
hot dish, they drenched it with cold
water before eating it. True, this
archaic attitude is exceptional. Many
peoples, however, suffer not from
want of cooking ability but from a far
more serious lack that of the means
of production as a result of which
they can hardly ever rely upon more
than one type of food at a time.
Ethnologists such as E.E. Evans-
Pritchard and Audrey Richards have
described how, in certain parts of
Africa, the physical health and men¬
tal outlook of the native population
are affected by the periodicity of
foodstuffs. Many communities have
enough to eat during only part of the
year, when manioc, millet or rice is
available. After these "'fat months"
come the "lean months," when the
people have only what they can col¬
lect at random. The daily meal
shrinks in size and, still more impor¬
tant, a diet rich in carbohydrates is
suddenly replaced by one consisting
almost entirely of such vegetables as
marrows and melons.
We, with our well-assured food-
supply, can hardly imagine the inten¬
sity of the sensations resulting from
this substitution. The feeling of re¬
pletion abruptly gives way to hunger-
cramps. Violent diarrhoea succeeds
the contrary discomfort of flatulence
and intestinal fermentation.
The native population thus finds
that both their bodies and their
spirits are radically affected by
changes in diet. As Audrey Richards
has said with so much insight, it is

not surprising that such communities
regard food as perilous stuff, charged
with every sort of magic influence.
They therefore associate the sensa¬
tions engendered by food with feelings
to which we attribute a different
origin ; the inner glow produced by
alcohol is for them a sign of anger,
whereas they connect fasting with
the highest spiritual emotions. "I
feel like a young girl again, I'm so
lighthearted!" exclaimed one old Afri¬
can woman, on a day when she
chanced to have eaten her fill.
In the history of the human race
there is a memorable, yet unknown
day: the date when man discovered
how to keep two different sources of
nourishment at his disposal all the
year round and, by
combining them, over¬
came the two great
dangers to his nour¬
ishment scarcity
of food, and its insi¬
pidity.
For to eat one's fill
'is not enough. As a
French proverb has
shrewdly put it, one
must not lose "the
taste for bread". The
whole history of cook¬
ing is the story of a
search for means of
making bread tasty,
of creating and fost¬
ering the appetite for
a basic foodstuff-
bread, rice, millet,
maize or manioc, ac¬
cording to the re¬
gion which supplies
energy but has little
flavour. Meat came
later; for a long time
it was, and in many
parts of the world it
still is, a luxury re¬
served for the privil-
eged. The real
foundation of cooking
throughout the world
is carbohydrates en¬
livened by a condi¬
ment. Bread and
onions, chapattis and
chutney, rice and
sauce made from
fermented fish;
millet, maize or mani¬
oc with pimentos
all these are simply
variations on a uni¬
versal theme, «on
which the art of cooking has built up
, countless melodies.
The difficulties attending this quest
for flavours are illustrated by the
great sea voyages of the 16th century,
undertaken with what today seem
the most trivial motives. Only some
400 years ago, Europe was organizing
these tremendous expeditions chiefly
for the purpose of obtaining spices.
This marks the birth of cooking in
Europe and, perhaps everywhere else
as well, since no culinary style seems
able to do without certain prod¬
ucts of American origin, unknown
. elsewhere in the world before the
discovery of the New World potatoes,
tomatoes, peanuts, chocolate, vanilla
and pimentos. A whole chapter of
ethnology, in fact, remains to be
written. It would describe the char¬
acter and geographical distribution
of the rules some very simple, others
incredibly complex for obtaining,
treating, associating and mingling
the various basic foodstuffs. It
would reveal the Polynesians as the
inventors of soil-less agriculture, for
some of these islanders succeeded in
cultivating gardens on their coral
reefs, in trenches filled with putrefied
refuse; it would show that certain
tribes, though extremely primitive in
other respects, have performed the
extraordinary feat of producing basic
foodstuffs from poisonous plants such
as manioc and acorns.
It would also show that certain pri¬
mitive peoples have developed cooking
that is full of subtleties. In one of
his books on the Kwakiutl (inhabi-
whlch is alter-

tants of Alaska, to whom hunting and
agriculture were alike unknown), the
distinguished American ethnologist
Boas gives no less than 156 recipes for
preparing various kinds of fish, fruit,
and wild root-vegetables. One of
these, chosen at random, consists in
beating up snow until it has the
consistence of whipped cream and
then mixing it with fish-oil, molasses
and uncooked berries.
Under the descriptive title Zuni
Breadstuffs, a book by another ethno¬
logist, Cushing, gives a fascinating
account of the production and prep¬
aration of food in this Pueblo Indian
tribe of New Mexico. A feast consists
of 14 courses rolls and wafers of
maize in six different colours, various
kinds of meat, offal, mutton sausages
and blood pudding. All these are

stiff-bristled affair
nately thrust into
sucked clean.
The consumption of food is a dis-
stinctly social affair. There are very
few peoples who, like the Paressi of
Central Brazil, take their meals in
"solitary confinement", so as to con¬
ceal the "indecent" act of eating.
Writing on the Kwakiutl, Boas des¬
cribes the etiquette of a ceremonial
feast the culinary preparations, the
arrangement of the different kinds of
vessels and mats, the despatch oi
messengers with the invitations
(which must be refused several times
before final acceptance), the songs in
honour of the guests, and the bestow¬
al on each of them of a specially
selected portion, be¬
fitting his rank.
There is nothing to
surprise us in all this;
Kwakiutl etiquette is
not so very different
from our own formal
dinners. We too hon¬
our our guests with
embroidered cloths,
silver plate and with
choice dishes. But our
cooks, unlike the tri¬
bal ones, have for¬
gotten what was once
an essential rite that
of doing honour to
the animals about to
be eaten, so that their
species may not van¬
ish from the earth.
Thus we sometimes
come across discon¬
certing instructions in
native recipes, such
as the following (ori¬
ginating with the
Tsimshian Indians of
the northwest Pacific
coast), which I offer
as food for thought
to housewives, on
concluding this brief
introduction to culin¬
ary ethnology.
When fat is to be
extracted from
olachen, the fish are
first dried in the
open air. They are
then boiled in vessels
filled with water into
which stones heated
in the fire are
dropped, the fat being
skimmed off as it
rises to the surface. The remainder
of the fish is afterwards spread on
a sieve above some recipient, and an
old woman presses it to her naked
breast as hard as she can, to squeeze
out the rest of the fat (men are
strictly forbidden to perform this
degreasing operation).
The cakes of fish are then heaped
up in a corner of the hut, where they
lie rotting until they swarm with
maggots. Despite the intolerable
stench, they must not be thrown
away.
Moreover, none of the "cooks"
concerned is allowed to wash; every¬
one must remain covered with filth
until the end of the proceedings,
which may last for two or three
weeks. Otherwise the fish would be
"ashamed" and would never come

DO YOU KNOW
THESE RECIPES?
The sharing of kitchen secrets is of special interest when women of different nations find
themselves together as they do in Geneva, Switzerland, where many members of U.N. staffs
and their families are located. Some favourite recipes of women from all over the world have
now been collected and published by the U. N. Nursery School, Geneva, as an international
cookbook. It offers some typical dishes of more than 20 countries. (Cookbooks obtainable
from U. N. Nursery School, I, avenue de la Paix, Geneva, or from U. N. Nursery
School, 35, rue de Boulainvilliers, Paris 16, France.) Here are a few of these recipes.
CHINA. Chicken and almonds. Chick¬
en (about 3 pounds), 1 cup mushrooms
(fresh), 1/2 cup fried almonds, 3 small
carrots, 1 leek (cut into inch-long shreds),
2 tablespoons soya sauce, 2 teaspoons sugar,
1 tablespoon wine (or dry sherry), 2 tea¬
spoons cornstarch, salt to taste, 2 table¬
spoons oil for frying.
Bone the chicken, remove skin and cut
meat into half-inch pieces. Put leeks,
soya sauce, sugar, wine, cornstarch and
salt into bowl, mix and add cut-up
chicken. Mix well so that chicken can
absorb flavours of sauce. Peel and dice
carrots (same size as chicken) and boil until
tender. Clean mushrooms (preferably
small size) and boil until done. Add
2 tablespoons oil in pan and when hot, add
the chicken. Cook two minutes, turning
all the time. Add boiled carrots and
mushrooms and a little water if too dry,
and cook a further minute. Just before
dishing up, add fried almonds. Mix well
and serve.
GREAT BRITAIN. Scones. Half a
pound of flour, 1 teaspoon baking powder,
1/4 teaspoon salt, 1 piece of butter the
size of an egg, 1/4 pint milk (equivalent
to 12 tablespoons), 1 teaspoon sugar.
Sieve the flour and salt and baking powder
together and put them into a bowl. Rub
in the butter and add the sugar. Mix to
a soft dough with the milk, using a fork,
and turn onto a floured board and shape
into a round. Roll out to about an inch
EATING IN JAPAN: TWO PLEASURES IN ONE

oak leaves and to break
off twigs from the forest
trees as chopsticks. Today
Japanese tableware expres¬

the vessels being chosen to
harmonize with the shapes
and colours of foods. The
basic materials used are
white rice, tender fish,
vegetables of varied hues,
miso-soup with its fra¬
grance, and green tea.

onto a greased baking sheet and bake in
a hot oven for 10 minutes.
ITALY. Zuppe pavese. Fry in oil
two medium slices of bread and put them
in each soup plate. Over these slices of.
bread, break two fresh eggs and season
them with salt and grated cheese. Pour
in very hot bouillon, gently so as not to
break the eggs.
SPAIN. Gazpacho (Andalousian).
Soak half a loaf of white bread in waler.
Purée it with a passe-tout or put in an
electric blender with a clove of garlic, raw
tomatoes and cucumbers. Add olive oil
and vinegar to taste.
Add enough water and a few ice cubes
to liquefy it to soup consistency. Serve
very cold topped with chopped green
peppers.
SCANDINAVIA. Herring salad.
Cooked meat, cold potatoes, red beets,
1 sliced onion, salted and smoked or
pickled herring, sour mustard.
Dice the following ingredients until
they make a mushy mass: meat, potatoes,
red beets, onion and the well-soaked her¬
ring and mustard. If still too dry and
won't adhere together, add a little vinegar
from the red beets. Flavour with sugar.
Make open sandwiches with this spread
on bread and decorate with slices of hard-
boiled eggs, or if you prefer, the sand¬
wiches can be topped with fried eggs.
IRAN. Summer soup (cold). Add salt
and pepper to three yoghourts and beat
well. Add mint (fresh or dried) chives
and one chopped cucumber and also a
handful of Corinth raisins and 1 cup of
water. Chill and serve as an entrée.
SOUTH AMERICA. Caldillo de con¬
grio (Fish Soup). Three and a half lbs
of red conger-eel, 1/2 cup olive oil, 1 cup
white wine, 3 1/2 lbs of potatoes, 6 toma¬
toes or 1 can tomatoes, dash powdered
pepper, 1 cup lemon juice, 2 small onions,
3 carrots, garlic, parsley, salt, 2 cups water,
sliced lemon. Clean the fish, cut in pieces,
salt it and sprinkle generously with, lemon
juice. Cut onions very finely and fry.
Add carrots sliced and then 2 cups of
water, garlic salt, pepper and parsley.

INDIA. Modified curry. Brown finely
chopped onion in a little fat, add finely
chopped green peppers and tomatoes and
simmer until thick. Then add 1 table¬
spoon curry powder, some tumeric, a little
salt and paprika and cayenne. (The latter
to taste, but about 1 tablespoon salt and

If served with rice, be sure to either rince
your rice in a colander with boiling water,
or dry it in the oven till grains remain flaky
and separate. These ingredients are plan¬

HAITI. Rice and red beans. 2 cups of
rice, 1 1/2 cups beans, 50 grams of
smoked pork, 4 ounces of salt pork. Pre¬
pare and wash the beans and put them to
soak for 12 hours. Put in a saucepan 8 to
10 cups of water, the chopped up salt pork,
a pinch of thyme, a sprig of parsley and
some finely-chopped chives and the beans.
When the beans are cooked, but still firm,
drain them. Put into a saucepan four
tablespoons of butter, and the smoked pork
finely chopped, and leave until it browns
a little. Add the beans and let them fry
until they are crusty. Add four cups of
water in which the beans were cooked, a
clove of garlic, and salt as desired. When
in full boil add the rice which has been

ATOMIC FOOD
Radiation opens new vistas
in conservation of food
a.

..x ttfc»
In time, atomic energy may help to dispel the spectre
of hunger from the world . It can guide plant scientists
to improved ways of raising crops, teach them to
combat insect pests and plant diseases more effec¬
tively, and even create new types of plants yielding
a larger harvest. Using radio-isotopes as "tracers"
scientists have learned much about plant growth.
Now, the use of atomic radiation has opened new
horizons in the field of food conservation. Five years
of painstaking research have shown U.S. scientists
how exposure to radiation affects food, as seen in
photos (4-5). Six-month-old sprouting potato makes
striking contrast with two-year-old atomic-preserved
one; all onions here are same age, lower ones were
exposed to radiation. (6) Quick, efficient method of
sterilizing food by exposing it to radiations from
electron-generator. Wrapped in cellophane, food is
instantly sterilized. Radiation passes through package
but leaves no trace, so food is safe to eat. (7) Potatoes
properly exposed to radiation do not sprout, wither or
spoil for two years. This portable atomic-processing
unit can be mounted on a truck and moved into a field
where it can quickly "preserve" an entire potato crop.
Conservation by radiation offers great promise, but
is still very much in the experimental stage today.

FISH STALKING WITH T
\K llllons of people need more protein in their diet an
they could get it from fish. But the seaa vast
storehouse of food and mineral resources covering I 39 million
square miles, or two and a half times the world's land area
has hardly been tapped to meet the needs of Man. Today,
however, scientists are aiding fishermen to make bigger
catches (fish production is now about 11 million tons annually
compared with 22 millions tons in pre-war days) by provid¬
ing better equipment for locating and catching fish and by
devising more efficient operating methods. Photos on

THE FOOD OUR
ANCESTORS ATE
by R. J. Forbes
Nothing is more surprising and more fantastic than the
story of human diet, of what mankind has chosen to
eat and drink throughout the ages.
A mere two hundred years ago we find ourselves
in a world without pressure cookers, without pasteurization,
evaporated foods and drinks, deep-freezing, refrigerators and
canned food. Even the most civilised parts of the world were
then liable to suffer from hunger caused by failure of crops;
the lack of proper and sufficient fodder crops necessitated
the wholesale slaughter of cattle in the autumn and condemned
many to eat salted and smoked meat for months on end.
Another three hundred years back and we are in a world
that had no potatoes, maize, coffee, tea or tobacco nor any
of the foodstuffs and natural products of the Western
Hemisphere or the Far East. Gin and other spirits were only
just coming into general use and the first bye-laws against
drunkenness are evidence of their effect. Only a few
generations later the sailors of the Dutch navy were on the
verge of revolt because gin was substituted for their daily
ration of ale.
Such examples show how difficult it is to appreciate the
tastes and food habits of ancient man; the further we go
back in history, the stranger the
situation becomes.
In the Palaeolithic, food-gathering era
man consumed his food either raw or
roasted. Boiling only became possible
with the advent of heat-proof vessels
and pottery much later. We can obtain
a glimpse of this primitive menu by
studying people like the Eskimos, who
eat most of their animal food raw and
only occasionally resort to roasting
(keeping the inside underdone), but
always consume their food either cold
or lukewarm.
There was, of course, plenty of
vegetable food available, but we have
no idea of the extent of early man's
menu, since most of the remains have
perished and only rarely are well-
preserved bodies found, the contents of
whose stomachs we can analyse. The
Upper Palaeolithic hunter-fishers of
Europe ate the meat of reindeer, wild
horses, bison and hares. They caught
20
the Arctic willow grouse and ptarmigans, salmon, pike, trout
and bream. Further south the red deer, the roe deer, the
wild pig and the aurochs were killed and eaten. Limpets,
mussels and honey were also collected.
The Mesolithic hunter-fishers lived almost exclusively on
the land animals of the forests, occasional sea birds, ducks,
geese and swans. Fishing concentrated on pike, but on the
coast occasional stranded whales were cut up and eaten, and
seals, cod, conger eels, haddock, crabs, bream, ray, skate and
certain types of shark were caught for food. From the few
remains of vegetable food we know that they ate hazel nuts,
water lily seeds, wild pears and^ berries.
The Neolithic settlers had learnt to cultivate cereals and
had begun to breed domestic animals; having pottery at their
disposal, they started the various cooking operations we know
and thus opened up many new ways of preparing food and
making new foodstuffs digestible. They had inherited the art
of preparing soups from earlier generations who could on
occasion heat mixtures of water and herbs by the immersion
of previously heated stones. Now, with cooking pots, they
could make porridges in pots by direct heating over stones.
More durable pastes and doughs were sometimes made from

such porridges and man discovered fermentation and hence the
earliest alcoholic beverages prepared from fruits (grapes),
honey and cereals (barley) containing natural sugar.
After the advent of agriculture, venison gradually
disappeared from the menu and meat was obtained from
domesticated cattle, pigs and sheep. Fowling was still
important as a means of securing oil for lamps, and fish now
also served for the feeding of cattle. Salmon, sturgeon and
eels were caught and smoked or dried for consumption during
the winter.
The Neolithic farmer supplemented his cereal dishes with
acorns, beech nuts, hazel nuts, elderberries, strawberries and
raspberries. The roots of certain reeds, the bog bean and
the water nut were collected and groats (crushed grains) were
prepared from wild grasses.
A similar evolution took place in the ancient Near East,
where records dating from about 3000 B.C., left by the
civilizations of the valleys of the Nile, Euphrates, Tigris and
Indus, begin to shed light on many points which remained
obscure during the prehistoric phase. We find that cereals
were sometimes parched or roasted to
prepare them for milling or to make
them more suitable for storing, an
operation which we should distinguish
carefully from the drying of unripened
grain sometimes practised in prehistoric
Europe with the object of making up
for the lack of sunlight and hastening
the ripening of the grain.
In the Near East animal and
vegetable foods differed slightly from
those of prehistoric Europe mentioned
above. In ancient Egypt cereals formed
a substantial part of the food consumed
and consisted mainly of emmer, barley
and some naked wheat. The Egyptians knew no less than
30 different types of bread, cakes and sweetmeats. Beans,
peas and lentils were eaten except by certain groups of priests
who were forbidden to touch them. Vegetable food consisted
largely of water melons, lettuce, artichokes, cucumber, endive
and radishes. Dishes were flavoured with onions, garlic and
leek, and fruit such as dates, figs, nuts of the doum palm and
pomegranates were available.
There was a variety of vegetable and animal fats and oils
to choose from and the milk and cheese of goats and cattle
were used. Butter was sometimes consumed in the form
of ghee. Meat was obtained from cattle, goats and sheep,
but it was expensive and the poor consumed huge quantities
of pickled and salted fish and all kinds of geese and ducks,
so plentiful in the marshes along the Nile.
In ancient Mesopotamia meat appeared even more rarely
on the tables of the poor, who ate mostly dried, pickled and
smoked fish. Here sesame oil took the place of the olive oil

used by the Egyptians, for the olive was never at home in
Mesopotamia. However, the "country between the two
rivers" had an abundance of fruit and at an early date the
inhabitants ate the cherries, apricots and peaches which slowly
moved westward but did not reach Italy until the beginning
of our own era.
A large part of the cereals grown was still consumed in
the form of porridges or cakes baked with flour, oil and
honey. Bread of a hard biscuit-like type without leaven was
baked on hot stones or embers or on the previously heated
walls of beehive-shaped ovens. Not until about 2000 B.C.
were such ovens provided with trays to hold the loaves
prepared from dough. Most households had their own clay
cooking ranges with a flat top and circular flue, but sometimes
groups of households shared a communal range in the open
and some of the ancient Mesopotamian towns had large ranges
in the temple annexes on which food could be cooked for
the hordes of servants. The baker of these ancient times was
often also a purveyor of food in general and a cook-shop
keeper who provided food for regular clients.
The ancient kitchen was the origin
of many if not most of our technical
operations. Indeed, the ancient techno¬
logists use culinary terms when they
describe the "boiling" or "washing"
of ores and other industrial materials.
To the kitchen we owe the development
of grinding machinery, the rotary mill
and its descendants, which were develop¬
ed from the quern, a primitive mill
consisting of two circular stones, the
upper one turned by hand, by which the
grain was crushed and ground into flour.
To the kitchen we also owe the mortar
and pestle and the sieve. The latter,
made of rushes, reeds or papyrus, was still a primitive
apparatus with unequal meshes and we need not wonder that
the ancient bread, even in Roman times, was full of grit and
stones which could not be properly removed with such make¬
shift sieves, even with the better Greek basket-shaped sieve.
We must also realize that the bread of the ancient Near
East was mostly unleavened and therefore a hard, gritty,
biscuit-like cake rather than the fluffy white bread we are
accustomed to. Leaven "was known in Egypt by about
1500 B.C. and was used from time to time. The ancient
Greeks and Romans did not use it until the beginning of
our own era, when the Romans got to know it from the
beer-drinking Celts of Spain and Gaul and used it for luxury
bread. This leaven was mostly produced from millet.
Apart from milk, a mild beer prepared from
emmer or barley was the common beverage of
the ancient Near East. Wine was grown but
only the rich drank it. On the other hand

Medieval meals
far from colossal
There ¡s a medieval saying that angels need
to feed but once a day, mankind twice, and
beasts three times or more. The Middle
Ages were reputed to have been a period of
colossal meals washed down with plenty of
wine and beer, but we now know that these
feasts were exceptions and that the diet of
the masses was plain and mainly vegetarian.

the Greeks and Romans promoted viticulture and drank wine
generally, though always diluting it with water. They
regarder beer as a barbaric drink, and when they colonized the
coasts of the Mediterranean they imported viticulture and
wine-drinking. It was not until Roman times that Gaul, the
present France, became a wine-growing country. Both in
Spain and Gaul beer was the original drink which only
disappeared in the early centuries of the present era.
The large-scale production of sesame and olive oil and of
fermented beverages led to very important technical
inventions. In order to express the juice of the olive and
the grape, the ancient Near East had invented the bag-press
and the roller-mill. The Greeks added the important lever-
press and the Romans invented the screw-press and the
wedge-press, all of which were used primarily for the
production of oil and grape juice.
The diet of ancient Greece and Rome differed little from
that of the ancient Near East. The primitive cereal, einkorn,
had come to Europe from the East but disappeared as emmer,
naked wheats and barley spread to the West in its wake.
Hardy crops like oats and rye were developed in Northern
Europe but did not come south before the first centuries of
our own era. The classical world depended mainly on home¬
grown emmer and barley but its preference for the naked
wheats resulted in large-scale imports of these grains from
Southern Russia, Egypt and North Africa to supply the cities
which specialized in olive growing and viticulture.
The "corn dole" played an important part in Roman
politics and so did the imports of grain in ancient Athens.
Flour was still mainly produced at home and the professional
miller and baker played scarcely any part before the first
century B.C. Coarse cloth and linen sieves gave a somewhat
better flour than had previously been obtainable. Most of the
ancient flour was simply whole-grain meal; among the sifted
flours an 80% extraction was standard. Bread and groats
were the staple food of Greece and Rome.
A large proportion of this farinaceous food was, however,
still consumed as a porridge, such as the "maza" compounded
of flour, honey, salt, oil and water, and the "turon" consisting
of flour, cheese-gratings, eggs and honey. Such porridges
and broths continued in favour up to the very end of the
Roman Empire. Many Greek dishes were sprinkled with
barley flour before cooking.
Watering down the milk
was an old Greek custom
From the Bronze Age onwards the Greeks had a consi¬
derable variety of vegetables at their disposal; they liked
to season them with all kinds of spices. Mutton and beef
were sometimes added, but they were costly, and only the
rich could afford poultry and game. The normal diet
contained many dishes made with milk and cheese, and fish
and other sea-food was very common. From excavations we
know that apples, pears, plums, pomegranates and almonds
were eaten.
Notwithstanding the Homeric allusions to large quantities
of meat, food was mainly farinaceous porridges of corn flour
and broths of beans and pulses with dried and pickled fish
and vegetables figuring on the table in Homeric times.
Curiously enough, drinking milk as such was considered
intemperate and it was always watered down. Together with
barley water and wine diluted with 1-3 times its volume of
water it was a common beverage.
By the fifth century B.C. bakeries were springing up in the
richer cities and fish was becoming even more common.
Spices such as cumin, coriander, sesame and silphium were
imported. Barley bread was now considered fit for the poor

only and the richer people indulged in wheat bread. Pickled
sauces such as the "Garon" were very popular; this was
prepared by leaving fish to ferment in a salt brine for some
2-3 months. Cookery books and the earliest writings on
dietetics of the fourth century testify to a great variety of
dishes prepared from the ingredients mentioned. To the
Greek doctor however, "diet" meant only a prescription when
to eat, not what to eat!
The diet of the ancient Roman farmer was very much the
same. His "puis", like the Greek "maza", was a thick
porridge consisting of flour prepared from emmer, barley or
beans and seasoned with salt. Green vegetables were added
and groats were frequently eaten. The flat, hard bread baked
in embers and ashes was usually soaked in milk before being
eaten. Beans, peas, turnips and onions complete the original
vegetarian diet. Apples, plums, pears, pomegranates and figs
were known; garlic, salt and
garden herbs were used to
season the food. Milk,
cheese, honey and olive oil
completed the diet.
About 300 B.C. a change
occured owing to the spread
of Greek civilization from
the South. The taste for
wheat bread developed and
fish became far more popu¬
lar. The specialization of
the Italian farmer in grow¬
ing olives and fruit increas¬
ed the consumption of
almonds, chestnuts, hazel
nuts and walnuts. Oriental
fruits like cherries, peaches
and apricots were introdu¬
ced into Italian orchards
during the first century
B.C., but lemons and oran¬
ges did not come until much
later when the Arabs
brought them to Spain.
Meat also became more
popular as northern Italy
specialized in raising live¬
stock for the markets of
Roman and other large
cities. However, the over-
refined taste of the rich
mentioned by the poets,
satirists and cookery books
of the Imperial period did
not spread to the lower
classes, and the soldier's
diet remained basically the same as that of the sturdy Roman
citizen of old.
The Middle Ages are popularly held to have been a
period of colossal meals washed down with excessive quan¬
tities of wine and beer. Further study of the chronicles
proves that these were exceptions and that the diet of the
masses was plain and mainly vegetarian. In about 1325
Mahaut, countess of Artois and Burgundy, said that one
meal was the rule of angels, two that of mankind and three
or more that of beasts. The many holy days of banquet
repute were counterbalanced by many fast days.
Most of the rich shared the diet of the artisans and
townspeople which consisted of a kind of soup in the morning
and porridge or soup, fish and vegetables in the evening.
Bread and cakes were consumed in large quantities but pastries
only very rarely. Fish, fresh, dried or salted, was eaten
SEABORNE VINEYARD. Archaeology suggests that the vine
was cultivated in the Aegean in the Early Bronze Age. Greeks
were great wine lovers even from the days of Homer. Here,
Dionysus, Greek god of wine, makes his legendary journey.
According to one version he changed an attacking band of pirates
into dolphins, to continue his lonely but festive journey with
drinking horn in hand, the vines happily surviving. Illustration

much more frequently than nowadays, meat being still very
expensive and reserved for the Sabbath. Water and milk
were drunk more frequently than beer and wine. The inven¬
tion of the gutting of herrings by Willem Beukelszoon of
Biervliet (Flanders) in about 1375 was an important addition
to the methods of preserving sea-food, large quantities of
which appeared on the tables of inland regions.
Slices of bread served
as plates and napkins
Bacon, beef, pork, chicken and eggs appeared on the tables
of townsmen fairly frequently and as their wages generally
rose in the course of the Middle Ages we find that they
started to indulge more in wheat bread and such delicacies
as pré-salé, that is mutton obtained from sheep fed on the
drained salt marshes along
the coast, as well as in pork
and goat's meat. Leaven¬
ed bread appears to have
been as common as unleav¬
ened cakes or dumplings.
Only the very poor ate
millet bread or used flour
made from buckwheat or
"sxiracen corn", which was
introduced during the fif¬
teenth century from Slav¬
onic countries. Oats and
rye were often used; cress,
radishes, parsnips and car¬
rots featured on the menus.
Towards the end of the
Middle Ages, Italy produc¬
ed the new types of food
we call macaroni and ver¬
micelli, prepared from de¬
siccated dough of cereals
and rice. It is possible that
these first appeared in
Southern Italy.
Butter, beef fat and lard,
rape seed oil and cole seed
oil were substituted for the
olive oil of the ancients, for
the olive would not grow
in these northern regions.
The only sweetening agent
was honey and this accounts
for the extent of beekeeping
during the Middle Ages.
People liked heavily spic¬
ed dishes; we find herb
gardens in every town and manor to supply these herbs all
the year round, and such Oriental spices as pepper appeared
on the tables of the rich, though few could afford them.
Many of these herbs and spices were eaten because of their
reputed medicinal properties.
Table manners also underwent a change. Food was usually
eaten with knives (of the hunting knife type), spoons and the
hands. Forks were used in the kitchen only. Slices of bread
served both as plates and napkins, but trenchers (wooden
roundels) and bowls of wood were also used. Salt containers,
often in the shape of a boat, were essential since medieval
people used much more salt than we do and added many
spiced sauces to their food. The rich used pewter, but as tin
grew more and more scarce, glazed pottery gradually came
into more general use.
Thus at the threshold of modern times diet was still pre¬
ponderantly vegetarian, fat and meat being used sparingly.

GARGANTUA
of the skies
As a child, Gargantua giant hero
of Rabelais' satire was nourish¬
ed with the milk of four
cows ; reaching manhood, he drank
his fill from a hogshead holding 500
gallons, and his redoubtable appetite
was more than equal to the roast
oxen which his cooks set before him.
Today in many large cities there
are groups of chefs facing pretty
much the same problem as Gargan-
tua's kitchen staff. They too have
to satisfy the appetite and please
the palate of a giant, one whose size
increases at a phenomenal rate each
year the airline passenger.
The cooks, working in the kitchens
of Air France, at Orly Airport, Paris,
for example, last year used up 40
tons of meat, 80 tons of poultry,
nearly half a million eggs and over
70 tons of sugar in the meals they
prepared for passengers to eat on
airliners leaving this airport.
Five years from now, the Gargan¬
tua of the Skies at this same air¬
port then a seasoned traveller in
jet airliners will need 170 tons of
sugar to sweeten his coffee and his
pastries, 200 tons of poultry, 90 tons
of meat, a million eggs and (this
being France) two and a half tons
of pâté de foie gras. Today the
Catering Service of Air France at
Orly handles 36,000 items of cutlery
and crockery each day. By 1962 it
will be using well over 80,000.
Plans have already been made and
action taken to cope with the Titan's
inexorably growing appetite. Air
France has begun to build spacious
new catering quarters at Orly.
Air meals come of age
Full meals for air travellers
became both a possibility and a
necessity in the mid 1930's.
Since then the serving of fine foods
under the best possible conditions has
become an ever increasingly impor¬
tant part of airline operation, and the
present standards of airborne cater¬
ing reflect the ingenuity and resour¬
cefulness that have been brought to
bear on the problems of serving full
meals efficiently and swiftly.
One of the airline companies with
a very long experience of these prob¬
lems is the British Overseas Airways
Corporation (B.O.A.C). In 1934 this
company was using charcoal heated
containers to keep freshly cooked
food hot until the service of the meal
could begin. This and
similar methods were
superseded by the use
of insulated containers
and, in, 1946, by the
first efficient aircraft

ovens. These were primarily for re¬
heating frozen foods so that is was no
longer necessary to serve meals
immediately after take-offwhile
they were still hot.
B.O.A.C, like many other major
airlines, aims at a de-luxe restaurant
standard of service. Care is taken
in the planning of menus to provide
for national and religious dietary
preferences, and foods likely to give
offence to certain faiths are excluded
on some sectors.
The careful planning and prepara¬
tion which goes into modern airline
catering enables passengers high over
the Atlantic to eat the same sort of
food they might order in a Paris or
New York restaurant. Pan American
Airways (P.A.A.) for example, prides
itself on serving meals that include
such choice dishes as filet mignon
and roast duck prepared with orange
sauce.
The Belgian airline, Sabena,
actually sent the famous chef who
runs its catering service to the U.S.A.
for two years to study American
tastes and cooking. His job during
this time was to draw up menus for
the transatlantic services which
would please American passengers
while not running contrary to Euro¬
pean tastes.
National tastes are also considered
on the shorter runs. On its Brussels-
Warsaw line, Sabena serves up
French cooking with Polish vodka.
For Belgians going south on the
Brussels-Nice service, the holiday
begins on the aircraft with Provencal
dishes and pastis to drink.
Each to his taste
About three quarters of Skbena's
meals even for the return
trips to Belgium are prepared
in Brussels, one exception being the
New York-Brussels service whose
food comes from New York, though
the dishes are prepared "French
style".
To aid him in preparing menus
which have the greatest chance of
pleasing the greatest number, Sabe-
na's catering director has a long list
of the likes and dislikes of various
nationalities. Here are a few of them:
South Africans don't like French
wine.
Americans don't like very dry
Champagne.
The French only like their own
wines.
Americans don't like strong
coffee.
Italians like strong coffee.
Belgians are fond of what they
call "filet Américain" (raw,
chopped steak) not, in fact, a
favourite American dish at all.
Generally speaking the English
like things that displease the
French.
,The Dutch are given to eating
brussels sprouts with roast duck
and orange sauce.
As for the crews of Sabena, most
of them seem to suffer from a bad
case of jaded palate ; they have
tasted everything and so, it seems,
have the crews on other airlines.

Foods and fads from near and far
Spinach not for children
Green leafy vegetables are excel¬
lent for certain nutritive purposes,
but the spinach usually eaten in
North America and Europe is not
one of the best of -them. As an
energy producer for human beings,
spinach is inferior to hay. The
little protein it contains is very
hard to digest, it contains no
starch, sugar or fat (unless the fat
has been added). A man would
starve to death very promptly on
spinach, unless he ate about 30 lbs
per day. Spinach contains a
rather large amount of oxalic
acid which has the property of
combining with lime. Hence it can
actually take out of the body some
of the calcium already present,
and should not, therefore, be given
to a child.
Paid with loaves
Baked bread dates back only
some 5 000 years, to the days of
ancient Egypt. It was made from
wheat flour, although in later times
flour from millet, barley, oats, rye,
and rice has been used. In ancient
Egypt, almost everyone from the
humblest labourers and slaves to
priests, state officials, and even
viceroys, were paid with loaves,
and, as grain was a government
monopoly, the ruling pharaon
actually controlled the country's
entire basic wealth. From exca¬
vations in ancient tombs bread has
been found in round, conical,
elongated and braided designs,
and in the form of birds, fishes,
pyramids, sphinxes, and vases.
Sickness with many names
In Central Africa it is called
"kwashiorkor", in South Africa
"infantile pellagra". In Jamaica
it is called "fatty liver disease" or
"sugar baby". The French once
called it "dystrophie des fari¬
neux", and the Germans "'Mehl¬
nährschaden". In the Belgian
Congo it is sometimes called
"M'Buaki", in India, "nutrition
dystrophy" or "nutritional cdème
syndrome", and in Latin America
"distrophia pluricarencial infan¬
til". These names, and dozens of
others in different languages, all
mean the same kind of sickness in
young children protein malnutri¬
tion. Today, FAO and WHO and
other U.N. agencies are attacking
this world-wide problem.
Folklore and science agree
Powdered deer antlers, which
are rich in calcium, have long been
used in Northern China to prevent
the ill effects of calcium deficiency
in mothers. The Chinese and later
the Greeks used certain kinds of
seaweed which are rich in iodine
to cure diseases such as endemic
goitre. The North American In¬
dians used pine needles, which are
rich in ascorbic acid, to cure
scurvy, long before the discovery
of vitamins.
800,000,000 more mouths
A number of interrelated causes,
some rooted deep in the past, are
responsible for the present food
crisis. One of the main ones is
the spectacular growth of popula¬
tion in modern times. In the
200 years between 1650 and 1850,
world population doubled; in the
100 years between 1850 and 1950, it
doubled again. The growth in the
last half-century amounts to about
800 million people, or nearly 60%
in 50 years. Increases in popula¬
tion seem to be most rapid in
those regions where nutritional
levels have always been low and
food problems are already acute.
Butter v. margarine
The fat in margarine is equally
digestible and equal in calories to
other food fats, including butter.
The milk solids other than fat
(1 per cent.) present in both butter
and margarine are of negligible
nutritional importance. When
margarine is fortified with vit¬
amin A it can be substituted for
butter in the ordinary diet without
any nutritional disadvantage.
Relished and disliked
The British disdain some useful
foods. In parts of the country,
for example, certain green veget¬
ables once widely eaten are now
considered as "cattle fodder".
During the 1846 potato famine,
some of the Irish rejected the
maize sent from America for
their relief, and in some cases
even starved rather than eat this
unfamiliar food.
North Americans would refuse
to eat dog, but some Asians enjoy
it. In New Guinea breast of horn-
bill is a delicacy. Australian offi¬
cials in New Guinea ate it too,
accepting it as a rather peculiar
beefsteak. When they found out
what it really was they refused it.
In New Mexico hybrid corn was
introduced to Spanish American
farmers, and it produced three
times the yield of their own corn.
Within four years, however, the
farmers had ceased to grow it;
their wives did not like the texture
and no one enjoyed the flavour.
In Assam, pork is liked and pigs
are killed; yet an Englishman
failed when he tried to improve
the pork supply by the introduc¬
tion of black and white Berkshire
pigs. The reason: the people
believe that the Chin spirits of
Assam do not like pigs with black
and white markings.
Notions about milk
Some American Indian tribes
consider milk disgusting. Among
certain African tribes, women may
not do the milking. Men of the
Kababish tribe drink only camel's
milk, women cow's milk and chil¬
dren goat's milk. Among the
Banyankole, milk is reserved for
the "nobles". In Japan and Burma
and among the more conservative
groups in China, milk and milk
products are considered undesir¬
able food for adults. In certain
countries parents consider cow's
milk a food of almost magical
value, and believe that their chil¬
dren will rapidly weaken and die
unless they consume enormous
amounts of it daily.
If it aches, blame mummy
In a recent investigation in
Sweden, it was found that the
children spent on the average
l/5d ($0.20) per head per day on
sweets. One explanation given is
that young children are quick to
please their parents by learning to
like sweets which are continually
presented to them as gifts,
rewards, bribes and treats.
Chemicals in food
Most people will refuse many of
their usual foods if they do not
have the colour, flavour and con¬
sistency to which they have
become accustomed. To ensure
that foods stay in line with
consumers' tastes, a large number
of chemical substances may be
added during processing. These
"food additives" include preser¬
vatives, colours, flavours, sweet¬
eners, emulsifiers, anti-staling and
anti-rancidity agents, thickeners,
buffers and bleaching agents.

news item, a row of statis¬

West it is difficult to grasp the
concrete reality of famine, without
first hand experience.
In actuality a famine is a hollow

lips covered with slime, and
deepset hollow eyes ., beneath a

lowing of dying livestock. I once
saw it in the shape of three women
cutting up and eating the skin of
a three months dead horse. And
it has been groups of half-crazed
peasants cooking human flesh.
I know a little what it is like to
be in a famine. I once saw one.
Imagine a fertile province in
India where I once lived, with its
cultivated fields, tiny villages and
thriving cities. Here the rythmn of
life beats to the tempo of the
cicadas in the trees, with their
legs crossed as though in a gesture
of devotion. Day and night there
is the tinkling of the bells on the
bullock carts forever rumbling and
lurching along the deep rutted
roads. The temple conches signal
the passing of the day, and the
year's festivals come and go.
As the hot weather progresses,
the rivers and streams dry up and
become children's playgrounds.
Work is carried out only in the
early mornings and in the cool of
the evenings, and people sleep
away the heat of the middays and
afternoons.
The river, beds crack and the
banks of the streams crumble, but
that is usual and life goes on as
ever. There is water in the village
well and each morning and
evening the women of the village
gather to draw up their supplies
and gossip.
It is a large, bricklined well,
twelve feet in diameter, and
protected by a low wall. It is all
of one hundred feet deep, and a
row of projecting bricks form a
circular staircase right down to
the water level. The depth of
water can be calculated by
counting the number of bricks
showing above the water.
That is how it was the year of
the famine. As the hot weather
neared its end we began to wonder
whether the monsoon would be
late or early. It was the normal
topic for that time of the year.
The monsoon is the season of the
rains that sweep across India in a
curved path from the Bay of
Bengal and drop their last
pourings over, the Arabian Ocean.
Sometimes the rains do not come.
That spells famine in India.
Gradually that year
it became evident that
the monsoon would
be late. When the
time came to plant

THE RAINS FAILED
(Continued)
VILLAGE FLIGHT FROM HUNGER AND DEATH
the thin rice shoots in the paddy
fields the rains were very late
indeed, and we men, who normally
met at the barber's shop in the
village square, began to visit the
emptying well along with the
women.
The swelling sun gleamed and
glittered like a huge brass bedknob.
Wc kept constant watch for the
first tiny ball of cloud that would
herald the break in
the weather and re¬
lief from the eternal
heat and flies. All
that long and arid
season however, the
sun and sky remain¬
ed hard and immacu¬
late.
By then the women
had all begun to
talk of the emptying
larders. The rice
chatties were depleted
and maize was scarce.
Some of the shops in
the bazaar no longer
opened and their clos¬
ed shutters were a
sign of what was to
conic. At that stage
it would have been
sensible for us to have
made plans for the
evacuation of the
young and the old.
But human nature
being what it is, all of
us in the village were
loath to consider leav¬
ing our tiny plots of
land and few cattle.
And so, each day at
the well, where far
too many steps were
now showing, we
loudly proclaimed our
faith in the imminence
of the monsoon. "It's
bound to arrive to¬
morrow" we told each
other. But it never
came.
Distrust and aggres¬
sion crept into our
midst. Each family
began to be very
secretive about food.
And one evening I
suddenly realized that
the famine was among
us. It had very swiftly and se¬
cretly infiltrated into the village
without any of us being aware.
That is the awful facility of a
famine.
I discovered the famine one
evening while I was out for a
walk. I always walked along the
banks .of our river, where the
cracked fissures lay on the hard,
baked surface of the bed like
immense, black starfish. I passed
the burning ghats where the Hin¬
dus burned their dead, and that
evening, as a huge, spinning red
sun set unevenly, like a coffin
being lowered into a grave by
bearers of ill-assorted sizes, there
were six funeral pyres, and clus¬
tered around each were young
parents. The young and the very
old are invariably the first casual¬
ties. There had been no cholera,
There was water in the village well and each morning and evening the women
gathered there to draw up their supplies and gossip. But as weeks passed

or smallpox or typhoid that year,
so I knew these must be victims of
hunger.
The tears of the women were
bitter and arid symbols of our
frustrated hopes.
From that moment life took on
a new meaning. Shops no longer
opened at all, and the wealthier
shopkeepers left. There was a
spate of rumours about the
monsoon and its approach, and
about government grain supplies
on the way. But the food chatties,
were scraped clean and every tiny
store of food hoarded and guarded.
We all began to walk about in
a trance, and as the days passed
there was soon just a foot or so
of muddy liquid at the bottom of
the well. It became impossible to
think, or even feel anything. The
funeral pyres increas¬
ed in number each
evening, but soon
there were no tears
during the rites. Yet,
secretly, we all of us
clung to the hope
that the drought
would still break.
Then the first refu¬
gees from villages to
the east of us hurried
through in family
groups, each group
carrying the young
and bundles of house
hold effects and be¬
longings that they had
already begun to cast
away by the time
they had reached us.
By then too, they were
in a desperate state,
and the men of our
village had to fight
with some of the
stronger of them, who
tried to take what
water we had left.
And then in ones
and twos and threes
and fours, our fami¬
lies packed up simi¬
lar bundles of pos¬
sessions and joined
the scrambling stream
of refugees trekking
westwards to the hills
and deep jungles of
Hazaribagh and the
hoped-for land of
promise that lay just
beyond, but which
always remained just
beyond the next range
of hills, and which
we never did find.
The old and the infirm
we left behind. It was
what they would have
wanted had we given them a
choice, but there was no choice
and they lay there on their char-
poys in the gloomy interiors of the
abandoned houses, until death
came to deliver them.
Of the nine hundred and seven¬
teen people in our village, there
were only four hundred and eighty-
six there next, year to meet at the
well and wait for the monsoon. But
lhat year it did come.

Great famines of history
Although we know that famines ravaged Egypt
during the reigns of the Pharoahs and the
later Ptolemy dynasty, we are not sure exactly
when they took place or how many victims they
claimed. The first of the great famines of European
history of whose facts we can be absolutely certain
was the one at Rome in 436 B.C., when thousands of
starving people were driven by desperation to throw
themselves into the Tiber.
We know too that during the first centuries of the
Christian era many parts of the world were visited by
the grim spectre of famine and in 879 there occurred
the "universal famine", a terrible calamity which was
repeated nearly three centuries later in 1162.
India, because of its almost entire dependence upon
monsoon rains, is probably more liable than any other
country to crop failures which may deepen into
famine. Thus, down the centuries, hunger has stalked
across it. Between 1022 and 1033 A.D. great famines
occurred there in iwhich entire provinces were
depopulated. During the second half of the 14th
century there were great famines when millions
starved to death and not even the King, Togluk, could
obtain the necessities for his household.
Famine afflicted various areas of France during the
Middle Ages, and the food shortage in England became
so serious in 1586 that the government of Queen
Elizabeth was forced to pass a number of laws for the
relief of want which were eventually (1601) codified in
the famous statute on which the English Poor Law
system became based.
The Great Famine of Bengal (1769-70) carried off
one-third of the population (10,000,000 people), and
twenty years later there occurred the Doji Bara, or

HEALTH AND HUNGER. In the Terai area of northern India,
the U.N. Food and Agriculture Organization (FAO) and the
World Health Organization (WHO) work jointly to free the land
from malaria in order to spur the production of food. Here,

"skull famine", so called because the people died in
such numbers that they could not be buried. Accord¬
ing to tradition this was one of the severest famines
ever known, and it extended over the whole of Bombay
into Hyderabad and parts of Madras.
France under Louis XVI experienced a terrible
shortage and mismanagement of food supplies. With
the king's authorization an association was set up to
ensure the provisioning of Paris with grain. In fact,
however, the association was accused of speculating on
grain prices and the authorization which brought it
into being in 1765 was given the name of "The Famine
Agreement" by the people, thousands of whom died
from hunger. The Provost of Beaumont who dared to
denounce this Agreement in the Parliament at Rouen
was thrown into the Bastille and kept there for
22 years. When Turgot, the Contrôleur-Général of
Finance, decreed a free trade in grain, the members
of the Association in question stirred up riots which
were given the name of the "Flour War". They
succeeded in having the Agreement reinstated, but
their victory was short-lived for the Association was
abolished by the Revolution of 1789.
Famine gripped Ireland in 1846 and 1847 due to the
failure of the potato crop. Grants amounting to
£10,000,000 were made by the British Parliament to aid
the victims and to make good the losses.
Lost rice crop cost 1,000,000 lives
In the second half of the 19th century, famine
struck in many places: Algeria (300,000 deaths)
1868; Rajputana, India (1,500,000) 1869; Madras,
Bombay and Mysore (5,000,000) 1877 and 1888; North
China (9,500,000) 1877-78; 18 provinces of Russia
(2,000,000) 1891-92; India (1,000,000) 1899-1901. Even
in the 20th century, India has still not been freed
from the scourge of famine. The loss of the rice
crop in 1942 was a disaster in which in Bombay alone
some 1,000,000 people died.
Today, however, India, aided by the International
Rice Commission and FAO (the U.N. Food and Agri¬
culture Organization), is almost self-supporting in rice
production. Through the encouragement of this
Organization, Indian farmers now use the Japanese
method of rice planting in which the tiny rice shoots
are grown first of all in nurseries and then transplant¬
ed by hand in the paddy fields. Formerly the rice
shoots were just placed in bunches in the paddy fields.
This new method has led to a greatly increased yield
per acre.
In India's latest five-year plan the following projects
have either been completed or are being executed:
1. The Bhakra Nangal Dam in the Punjab, design¬
ed to afford irrigation for 3,581,000 acres.
2. The Mahamadi Dam Project in Orissa which
will provide irrigation for a further 1,095,000 acres.
3. The Tungabhara Dam in the Madras-Hydera¬
bad area which will irrigate 66,000 acres.
4. A dam being built by the Damodar "Valley
Corporation to irrigate 900,000 acres of potentially
fertile land in the Bihar.
Altogether fifty-three projects are planned, and will
be carried out under various agencies, and with
technical and financial help from other countries.

WORLD'S ROUND-THE-YEAR HARVEST
From the prairies of Saskatchewan to the pampas
of the Argentine, from the Volga to the Nile,
from the plains of Jndia to far-away Australia
pours a flood of wheat to feed a hungry world. Every
month of the year, in some part of the world, mach¬
ines rumble across countless fields reaping the golden
harvest that means food for hundreds of millions of
people. Next to rice wheat is today's most widely
used human food. More than any other crop it has
furnished the energy necessary for the development
of ancient and modern civilizations.
It was the main food of the ancient Egyptians,
Assyrians, Greeks and Romans and because it took
less labour to produce than other food crops it gave
these peoples more time to develop the arts and
sciences. Swiss lake dwellers grew wheat perhaps
10,000 years ago. In Mesopotamia specimens have
been found that were put in storeage 3,000 years ago.
Methods of growing and harvesting wheat changed
scarcely at all from ancient times till the 19th cen¬
tury. Seed was sown by hand and harvested with
a sickle. One improvement was a scythe with a
frame to catch the stalks as they fell. But with such
methods it took three to four hours of human labour
to produce a bushel of wheat.
Today machinery does the work in the world's
great wheat regions. The ground is prepared by
tractor-drawn ploughs and steel-toothed harrows,
then drill seeders plant the seed. Harvesting is now
speeded by the "combines", the machines which cut
and thresh at the same time. With this equipment
a crew of four can gather the yield from 75 acres of
wheat in a day.
Wheat has become an important food because it is
the only grain that contains gluten, an elastic pro¬
tein substance necessary for making light bread.
Because of its gluten, wheat makes more palatable
bread than any other grain. Its chemical composi¬
tion is greatly influenced by its environment. An
average sample contains about 70% carbohydrates,
12% water, 12% protein, 1,8% minerals, 2% fat and
2,2% crude fibre. A pound of wheat yields about
1,600 calories.
Except perhaps for barley, wheat is adapted to a
wider range of climatic conditions than any other
crop. It is grown in regions extending from the
frozen tundras of the North to the southernmost tips
of Africa, Tasmania and New Zealand. The U.S.S.R.
and the U.S.A. are its leading world producers. Lar¬
gest wheat-producing region of the world is the
black soil belt of Soviet Russia, extending over 1,500
miles from the Urals to the Danubian Basin.
In the right conditions and with proper care, wheat
can yield up to 40 bushels to the acre. But the wheat
farmers of the world must always be on the alert.
Their crop is subject to many diseases most of which
are caused by small fungi.
While most of the wheat grown in the world provi¬
des the flour from which we get our "daily bread", it
is also the source of many other products. By¬
products like bran, shorts and red dog flour obtained
in milling are used as animal feed. In the wartime
U.S.A. the yearly use of wheat to make alcohol used
in the production of synthetic rubber and munitions
was more than 100,000,000 bushels. Straw and chaff
may be ploughed under to provide humus to the soil
or used for livestock bedding. More and more is being
used to make paper, strawboard and similar products.
THE BREAD OF ASIA
In hundreds of thousands of little "mud-pie" farms
of Asian countries, life turns around the sowing,
cultivation, harvesting and threshing of a plant
that provides more than half the people on earth
with the greater part of their food rice. More than
nine-tenths of all the rice raised on earth is grown
in Asian countries, mostly in the mud of small, flood¬
ed fields where rice farmers and their families work
standing in water, planting and tending the crop.
Growing most profitably and easily on low river
flats, such as the plains and river bottoms of India,
China (the largest producer), Japan and the coun¬
tries of south east Asia, rice is the major crop on
rivers like the Yangtze in China, the lower Ganges in
India and the Irrawaddy in Burma. Apart from the
lowland or "wet" rice, there is also the "dry" or
upland plant grown on mountain slope terraces
where irrigation water is dropped in ditches from one
level to another.
The ancestor of the rice people eat today is a wild
grass that grows besides lakes from India to the East
Indies and northern Australia. The Hindus call this
wild grass nivara or newaree. The English name,
rice, commes from the Greek oryzon, oryza, which,
in turn, comes from the Arabic eruz, and finally from
the Sanscrit. No one knows exactly how long ago
man began to cultivate rice, but it has certainly been
grown in India since prehistoric times.
Though one of the most important staple cereals,
rice, as a food, is inferior to wheat, having less pro¬
tein and fat. Rice is prepared for market by first
being cleaned and hulled passed between stones
which crack the hulls and free the inner grain. At
this stage the germ and outer bran skin have not
been removed from the kernels and "brown rice" as
it is called in this . form, has a good nutritive value
in fat, minerals and vitamin B. But when rice is
polished and glazed until it is white, much of these
vitamins is lost. A diet largely composed of polished
rice may produce "beri-beri", a vitamin deficiency
disease unless it is supplemented by other foods richer
in protein and fat. In recent years a process has
been developed to produce "converted" white rice
which is a complete food, containing up to to 80% of
the vitamins and minerals of field-ripened rice.
Rice is not only a basic food for many hundreds of
millions of people, it is the basis of many products
and provides clothing and shelter too. Starch and
breakfast cereals are made from the rice grains, the
Japanese use them to ferment rice wine, or sake and
from them the Indians distil a liquor called arrack.
From the rice straw the people of Asian countries
make shoes, hats, thatching for houses, carpeting and
mats. Rice brau, polish and straw are used as fodder
for pigs and cattle and for fertilizer, and from the
rice hulls packing material is made.
Following the Second World War, because it was
scarce and the price had risen sharply, rice was
partially replaced by wheat and other grains in the
diet of the people in India, Ceylon, Japan and the
Philippines. This may have led to a lasting change
in the food habits of some groups among the people.
Even though rice is now more plentiful in Ceylon the
use of wheat seems to persist and in Japan, the
consumption of wheat has continued to increase
while that of rice and barley has declined.

The Unesco Courier. April 1957
Letters to the Editor
Sir,
Having read your issue "Spotlight on
the World of Books" (Feb. 1957) with
great interest I should like to tell you
of a small grievance I have in connection
with books. I speak more or less
four languages: English, Spanish, Italian
and German and to keep myself "in
form" I have to buy books in these
languages. I regret to say, however,
that the price of foreign books (or
revues) in France is much higher than
the price shown for the country of
origin. I recently paid 950 francs for a
book by Carlo Levi published in Milan.
The Italian price was 1,050 liras (a
little more than 600 French francs).
Why is there such a difference in the
prices? If Unesco wishes to encourage
cultural exchanges it seems to me that
it should try to get countries to admit
books free of duty, or at least encourage
them to reach bilateral agreements.
Books are usually expensive enough
without the addition of high duties.
Mile Müller
Paris
Editor's note : Under the Unesco
Agreement on the Importation of Edu¬
cational, Scientific and Cultural Materials,
which France has joined, foreign books
enter France duty-free. However, there
are internal sales taxes (taxes sur les tran¬
sactions) which are applied to all books,
foreign and French. In the case of foreign
books, transport and commission charges
must also be taken into account. Trans¬
port costs themselves represent about 12
per cent of the original published price
of an imported book. Unesco is working
with the Universal Postal Union and other
organizations to reduce transport charges
on books, brochures, etc.
Sir,
In your February 1957 issue ("Spot¬
light on the World of Books") you
published many statistics on translations
"World's most translated authors"
etc. I should like to point out that the
number of translations of foreign books
in a given language does not always
necessarily reveal the interest of the
country concerned in the literature of
other lands. In many countries quite
a large proportion of books from abroad
are read in original language versions.
In the secondary schools of the
Netherlands, for example, French, Eng¬
lish and German are obligatory
subjects. As a result, educated men
and women very rarely read novels
originally written in these languages in
a Dutch translation.
J.K. Van der Haagen
Paris
Sir,
I am a student at the City College of
New York where my English class
received the May, 1956 (No 12 U.S.A.)
edition of The Unesco Courier ("Are
Our Children Learning History With a
Slant"). You are to be complimented
on the subject material... but there are
several questions which are brought to
my mind after a careful reading of the
articles.
In the article "How Biased Are Our
History Textbooks?", Herbert Abraham
speaks about the rôle that nationalism
and militarism have played in our
history books. Mr. Abraham seems
to have forgotten the state of the world
today and would have the textbook
writers place less importance on mili
tarism. Would this give the future
generations a true picture?
The textbooks of the West are
attacked in the article, "Asian History
Through Western Glasses" by Ronald
' Fenton. Needless to say our past view
of Asian history has been "distorted
and out of focus", but can our text¬
books keep pace with our changing
society? Perhaps a better trained
history instructor and more emphasis
on current events would be the solution.
An article which I found informative
and stimulating was "Daddy, What's
the good of History?" by C.Peter Hill.
Once and for all we now have an answer
to the children's embarrassing question.
The last question I would ask is
whether there is a far Eastern edition
of The Unesco Courier and if so does
it have an issue devoted to a similar
topic, i.e. "Has Our Evaluation of the
West in Our History Textbooks Been
Fair?",
Stuart Rosenthal
Brooklyn, N.Y.
Editor's note : Our reader's comments
are certainly wortlt pondering over. We
are sure that Mr. Abraham did not lose
sight of the slate of the world today. He
agrees with our correspondent that future
generations should be given a true picture,
and regrets if he gave the impression of
suggesting anything different. Mr. Rosenthal
is, of course, right in asking for belter
trained teachers and, to some extent, right
in suggesting more emphasis on current
events (but the value of teaching current
events depends on the extent to which
these events are treated in a context of
history, sociology, psychology, etc.) Unesco
is working on tlte question of the treatment
of the West in Asian textbooks but it will
be some time before a report is published.
Sir,
I am entirely in agreement with the
aims and purposes of The Unesco
Courier and I have only one complaint
to make: I think it has too few pages
for the scope of the subjects it covers.
Yves Garnier
Ivry, France
Sir,
On behalf of our company which is
a subscriber to The Unesco Courier 1
want to express our admiration and send
you our congratulations for the January
issue ("Rare Treasures of World Art")
which is a joy to the eyes and to the
mind. In a few compact pages you
carry your readers from the Pilgrims'
Road leading to Compostella, to the
arcades of Florence and the gardens of
Isfahan.

<![CDATA[
From the Unesco Newsroom...
j\. TOMS FOR PEACE ON FILM:
An international catalogue of films on the
peaceful use of atomic energy is being
prepared for Unesco by the International
Scientific Film Association. A selection is
now being made from existing films
showing how the atom can be used for the
good of mankind. The catalogue, to be
published by Unesco next year, will list
80 films and give technical data on each
of them, information on its availability, an
analysis of its contents and an evaluation
from the scientific as well as from the
cinematographic point of view. A selection
committee has already screened more than
100 films from about 15 countries.
KEPT IN THE DARK: Nearly
60 per cent of the world's people have
insufficient press, film and radio equip¬
ment to keep them properly informed
of events at home and abroad, according
to a U.N. report on "Media of In¬
formation in Under-Developed Coun¬
tries". Prepared jointly by the U.N.
and Unesco, the report is due for
discussion at the next meeting of the
U.N. Economic and Social Council. It
notes that in 100 countries with a
combined population of 1,400 millions
{over half the world's total), press, film
and radio facilities need developing.
Nearly all the countries cited are in
south and east Asia, the Middle East,
Africa and Latin America.
F,AIR DEAL FOR AUTHORS:
Twenty-four countries have now joined the
Universal Copyright Convention sponsored
by Unesco, the latest being two from
Latin America Mexico and Ecuador.
The Convention was drawn up to fill gaps
in international copyright legislation under
which some countries are bound by one
convention, others by a different one and
still others by no agreements at all. The
Universal Copyright Convention eliminates
costly registration formalities; countries
joining it give to foreign works the same
protection accorded to those of their own
nationals.
GAMMA RAYS v. TSETSES :
The possibility of making use of
atomic energy to rid Africa of the tsetse
fly, which causes sleeping sickness, is
being examined at the British Atomic
Energy Research Establishment, Har¬
well, England. More than 3,000 tsetse
fly pupae have been flown there from
East Africa to be bombarded by gamma
rays in experiments designed to produce
sterile flies.
four-man mission arrived in Laos to
help plan a reorganization of the
country's national system of education.
T,RAVEL AT HALF THE COST:
The Argentine Government has granted a
50 per cent reduction in transport costs by
rail and sea to persons visiting Argentina
for educational, scientific and cultural
purposes, under Unesco's auspices. The
reduction applies to fares and to charges
for luggage, food and accomodation.
Argentina's concession follows Unesco's
request to Member States to grant the
widest possible facilities for educational
travel.
MEN WITH MISSIONS: In recent
weeks more teachers, scientists, tech¬
nicians and educators have joined the
ranks of UNESCO's several hundred
technical assistance experts and have
gone on missions or been re-assigned to
new ones in many parts of the world.
Dr. Hendrick Mooy, Dutch mathematics
professor, joined an international team
of science professors teaching at the new
Science Faculty of the University of
Monrovia, Liberia; Dr. Caleb Gattegno
arrived in Ethiopia on a science teaching
mission; Mr W. O'Dea, of the London
Science Museum went to New Delhi to
aid the National Physical Laboratory in
establishing a science museum, and a
A SIAN INTER-AID: Plans to build
three new universities in Japan for students
from south east Asia were announced
recently. Special facilities for foreign
students from Hong Kong, Singapore,
Thailand and the Philippines already exist
in three Tokyo universities. In Australia,
students have launched a scheme whereby
volunteers among Australian college gra¬
duates can offer to work in Indonesia to
help the country's development. The
Australian Government will provide
transport and make a clothing allowance to
volunteers. Students will work for the
Indonesian Government, at local rates of
pay, offering their special skills with the
aim of promoting a spirit of friendship and
understanding between the two countries.
OPEN DOORS TO KNOWLEDGE:
In the past six years, Thailand has
allowed some $232,000 worth of edu¬
cational, scientific and cultural mate¬
rials to enter its borders duty-free under
the UNESCO-sponsored Agreement which
exempts books, works of art, education¬
al films and recordings and science
equipment from import duties. This
was stated in a recent Thai Govern¬
ment report to UNESCO on the applica¬
tion of the Agreement since 1950.
Twenty-three other countries are ope¬
rating the same convention.
n REFUGE FROM TV: Certain pub¬
lic libraries in the United Kingdom
are reserving, as an experiment, a spe¬
cial room where schoolchildren can do
their homework. The scheme aims to
solve the problem of lack of space in
certain homes and of distractions like
radio and TV which prevent children
concentrating on their school work.

wl/UW UllLillll flUI Breakfasthas been given in Norway's capital since 1926. The idea has spread
and is rapidly becoming a national institution. The breakfast itself is made up of milk, fruit, raw vegetables, a spoonful
of codliver oil and various sandwiches, which together provide a growing child with the calories, proteins, calcium, iron
and vitamins needed for health and development. Organized by the Norwegian National Nutrition Council (which body
is also the Norwegian FAO Committee), the Oslo Breakfast shows children how to choose the right kind of food,
teaches them that eating well means eating proper food in the right proportions and lays foundations for good health.
