EAST MEETING WEST is symbolized by antique heads, Hindu and Greek, in this Polish
poster announcing a special week of activities to promote knowledge and understanding
of the Orient. During this campaign, organized by the Polish National Commission for
Unesco, in which the country's press, radio and TV collaborated, more than 200 talks and
lectures were given and exhibitions of Oriental art and literature were held. In Warsaw
an exhibition on the development of Oriental writing and the Oriental book was held at the
National Museum, and Unesco's latest travelling exhibition of colour reproductions, water
colours from the brushes of some the world's greatest Eastern and Western artists, was on
view at the International Press Club. The Polish East-West Week was one of the many co¬
ordinated activities through which Member States of Unesco are supporting Unesco's
Major Project on Mutual Appreciation of Eastern and Western Cultural Values (See page 20)

Those who have made up their minds
to listen to Indian, Balinese or Near
Eastern music, instead of lolling in lazy
prejudices about "monotonous chanting"
and "strange quarter-tones", perceive
that they are entering a musical uni¬
verse whose beauties are no harder
to appreciate than those of more fami¬
liar realms. It is always wiser to suspend
judgement on men and on cultures
whether the origin is Oriental or Occi¬
dental until one has read, seen, listened
and understood. Photo shows a young

The men of our time have been constantly preoccupied
with the problem of confronting Eastern and
Western cultural values and of finding a basis for
fuller understanding between the peoples of these two
parts of the world.
The changes which have taken place in recent years
in the relations between these two groups of peoples in
every sphere, and the need recognized -by all nations
to live together and to give to their peaceful relations a
spiritual foundation without which they cannot be secure
have further emphasized this important trend and led to
a restatement -of the terms of the problem.
Mutual understanding between Orient and Occident
stands on the borderline between two categories of
questions: questions of cultural values, which have a
relatively stable content; and problems of relations be¬
tween peoples, whose terms and psychological conditions
are in full process of change.
Under its Major Project for the mutual appreciation
of Eastern and Western cultural values, Unesco's work
therefore falls into line with an already powerful move¬
ment to which it offers a focus and a frame of reference.
It takes care not to separate artificially the two categories
of cultural and psychological questions. And it calls the
most enlightened men of East and West to a work of
joint reflexion; their presence at the same discussions
and study meetings, in an atmosphere of complete intel¬
lectual freedom, demonstrates the "mutual" character of
the appreciation Unesco seeks to develop. The spirit may
be seen both in the meetings or other initiatives arranged
under Unesco's own programme, and in those sponsored
by its Member States. The same principles are involved:
to promote intensive study of questions with a general
bearing and to direct men's minds towards sympathetic
understanding of foreign realities, an understanding often
obstructed by prejudice or resentment.
The Unesco Courier has devoted several issues in the
past to the East-West Major Project of Unesco and to
the mutual appreciation of cultural values (see particu¬
larly June 1956; January, June 1957; April, June 1958). The
present issue is a further attempt to present some of the
important problems which face us today on this question
and to survey a few of the activities to which Unesco
attaches particular significance.
The Fédération des Coopératives Migros in Zurich has
produced, in French and German, for the benefit of its
members, an album entitled Asia. In its 208 pages hundreds
of photographs, 18 colour plates and accompanying short
explanatory texts (the whole prepared and edited by Jean
Herbert of Geneva), the album offers a striking panorama
of the daily life, customs, costumes, people, unid life, art,
sculpture, industry and many achievements of the countries
of Asia. The album is highly recommended for reference
as a source of photographic material on Asia. All the photo¬
graphs published m the present issue of The Unesco
Courier with the following exceptions (.pages 1, 2, 8, 18-19,
23, 28, 30 and 33) were taken from this album. The French
edition of Asia has been published by Editions Albin
Michel, Paris, and an English edition is being prepared.
Full information on the various language editions of the
Album can be obtained from Fédération des Coopératives
Migros, 152 Limmatstrasse, Zürich 5 (Switzerland).

The Unesco Courier. December 1958
THE DAYS OF CULTURAL
TRIBALISM ARE OVER
K.L.M., Amsterdam
by Sir Sarvepalli Radhakrishnan
Vice-President of India
he days of cultural tribalism are over;
we no more have separate cultural
universes. East and West have come
together, never to part again, and they
must settle down in some kind of
peaceful coexistence which will eventually grow into
active, friendly co-operation. That is essential for the
future of the world, the welfare of the world itself.
There are many ideas about East and West which are
somewhat misleading in character. There are some
people who argue that the East is mystically minded and
the West is empirical in its outlook, one is more religious,
the other is more scientific, but these distinctions have
arisen only in recent times. China has contributed to us
many great scientific inventions: the compass, vaccination,
paper, printing silk. India has contributed logic, meta¬
physics, grammar, mathematics. It is in the last three
hundred years that the Asian countries lagged behind,
and Western nations made spectacular achievements in
science and technology, so that the contrast is emphasized
by the material backwardness of the Eastern nations and
the progressive character of Western nations.
This is true only for a few centuries; I remember a
great statement made by Lord Acton who tells us he who
looks at the last three hundred years overlooking the last
three thousand has no proper historical perspective. East
and West are not categories indicative of different forms
of consciousness or" different systems of culture. They
are aspects of every human being religious and scientific,
spiritual and rational. These represent two sides of
human nature, but sometimes the emphasis is more on
the religious side, sometimes more on the scientific side.
The distinction is only one of distribution of emphasis.
We have great traditions of Idealism from the time of
Socrates and Plato down to our own day, and we have
also great scientific achievements made by Eastern
nations. We should not therefore look upon these
expressions, these large generalizations, as more than
working hypotheses.
Asia is awake, Africa is on the move
But now the East is in ferment; Asia is awake, Africa
is on the move. They both wish to throw off the dead
hand of the past and join in the stream of human
progress. There have been political and economic revolu¬
tions and also revolutions of awakened desires, of roused
hopes. If these longings are not satisfied, if we are not
able to bring about at least a partial fulfilment of these
very legitimate aims that Eastern nations today have,
there will be no security for peace in this world. If we
want to have enduring peace it is essential for us to
emphasize the desirability of satisfying these aspirations
of the nations of Asia and Africa.
I am glad to note that Unesco has contributed a great
deal by way of giving scientific advice and technical
'assistance to the nations who are demanding develop¬
ment. Yet the difficulties are there, and greater atten¬
tion will have to be paid if this Organization is to be
global in its character not merely in its name but in its
content. This global character will have
to be reflected, at all levels, in all matters
major and minor.
There is another project: the extension
of education in Asian regions. Literacy is

essential, we must acquire knowledge, we must learn how
we can keep ourselves healthy, literate, modernist and
progressive. We suffer from disabilities, but I should like
to stress that merely to attain literacy is not enough.
Plato said in Charmides: "It is not life according- to
knowledge which makes men act rightly and be happy,
not even if it be knowledge of all the sciences, but one
science only, that of good and evil". Science and techno¬
logy, medicine and surgery, industry and commerce will
provide us with the framework of our society, but without
the knowledge of good and evil they will fail us. That
knowledge is the science which enables us to take interest
in the pursuit of truth and in curing the ills of suffering
humanity.
One man's suffering is all humanity's
Our intellectual achievements are great and our tech¬
nological advance has been outstanding, yet we live
on the brink of fear, at the edge of a precipice and
in perpetual fear of falling over it. We do need therefore
that this Organization should give ampler meaning to
certain common concepts which belong to all traditions of
the world the dignity of man, the need for compassion,
understanding.
We constantly speak of the inward presence of the
divine in the human being, and all the great religions are
an invitation to human beings to grow and change their
nature; though our nature may be limited, we are capable
of intimate unlimited developments. They tell us that
human nature need not be what it happens to be at the
present moment. . There is a capacity for self-renewal in
the human being. This assertion of the spirit in man
is the hope of the world.
Have we not rid ourselves of many pestilences which
devastated humanity, of cannibalism and head-hunting?
There was a time when we thought that God would be
pleased if we sacrificed children on the altar. We thought
religion would progress and expand by massacres and
inquisitions. We have grown out of all those ideas, so
also the idea that War is essential is something that we
can outgrow. There is no doubt that if human nature
asserts itself, that if the spirit in man is given scope, this
greatest pestilence of all ages will also be driven out by
human effort.
Man is invincible if his spirit asserts itself. He has
endurance and the capacity for compassion. He can
stand up and say, '"I will not bow down to the cir¬
cumstances, I am more powerful than the material forces
which confront us". Man is higher than the forces which
overwhelm him. If this principle of the inward presence
of spirit is taken by us as an assertion of human dignity,
we will realize the interwovenness of human life. We will
take seriously the Christian injunction to bear one an¬
other's burdens.
If one man suffers, the whole of humanity suffers, for
all humanity has become one today. It is to the develop¬
ment of the oneness of mankind that We must make the
great contribution. We are passing through trying times,
our civilization is being tested; it may be destroyed or
renewed. What will happen to it depends on ourselves,
not on our stars nor upon the impersonal forces which
surround us. It depends on the spirit of man, on the will
of man to take these things seriously. I have no doubt
that we shall march forward and that Unesco will
contribute to that cultural solidarity which is the
essential basis of enduring peace.

What are the chances of real understanding?

Lao Tsé
Karl Machatchek, Paris
eople often hear "the East" spoken of as an infinitely complex enigma which only specialists can
attempt to decipher. It seems to be made up of vast continents unknown seas and enormous
nations which used to be little heard of, especially as they were often considered merely vague
and picturesque provinces of empires whose capitals lay in the West. In it live an incredible
number of extremely varied peoples, speaking a multitude of languages (which are printed in incompre¬
hensible characters). These strange inhabitants are. steeped in philosophic, religious and literary tradi¬
tions which are at the same time quite ancient, and yet curiously alive.
When Westerners were at school, all they were taught about these religions and cultures was the fact
of their existence, and even this was usually brought in merely as a footnote to a chapter of ancient his¬
tory or elementary philosophy. Monuments had been photographed. Statues and paintings had been
brought to Western museums and shops. These objects might be regarded as curious or moving; they

might even be admired. But they were considered part
of the past, and of a rather abstract past at that.
The history of these peoples? Western schoolbooks
rarely mentioned it except in relation to the West. The
Arabs, for instance, appeared just in time to invade
Spain and fight the Crusaders in the Holy Land, after
which they left the stage and went back into the void.
India emerged from a long, legendary, fairy-tale night
to be exploited from the sixteenth to the eighteenth
centuries by a number of trading companies. China escap¬
ed from its dreary isolation to welcome the "civilizers"
of the Opium War; and Japan, symbolized for two cen¬
turies as an armoured Samurai killer of Portuguese
monks, was given two paragraphs under the date 1853.
Thus our Ignorance can often be explained or excused.
But it can no longer be tolerated. It appears dangerous
at a time when real politics are planetary, when the
words "fate of humanity" are no longer used exclusively
by moralists but are common in the newspapers in which
the conscience and the anxiety of our time are expressed
to a greater or lesser degree.
Where does East end & West begin?
Everyone knows, everyone senses, that peace, general
progress and world prosperity may depend to a large
extent on the development, the decisions and the
accomplishments of certain countries that many of us
still locate rather vaguely "in Asia", or "in Africa", but
that no one any longer dares call exotic. The profound
solidarity of all peoples has become a truism; and even
if one thinks chiefly of economic solidarity one feels the
need to know more about one's neighbours, near or far,
than just their industrial and commercial status. Many
are Wondering: "What are they really like, these nations
with whom we are henceforth linked for better or for
Georges Fradier, a French author and Journalist and a staff member
of Unesco, has for several years made special studies of the problems
of East-West understanding.

worse? What may be expected of them? How do they
look at the world?"
But this last question implies a far deeper curiosity
than that aroused now and then by casual newspaper
reading or concern for the future. To wonder about the
views and opinions of a people is to want to know the
broad lines of its history, its living conditions, its social
structures, its religious attitudes, its aspirations.
It would be an exaggeration to say that the varied
peoples who make up the West know one another really
well. Their misunderstandings have often been deplored,
and, when it comes to culture, they are likely to show a
provincialism which leads them to be rather neglectful
of their neighbours' values. Yet these peoples never
consider themselves very distant from one another;
within Europe or the Americas they see no cultural barrier
difficult to cross if they will take a little trouble.
But when these Westerners who so strongly sense their
own basic unity turn toward one or another of the peoples
of the East, they are completely at a loss. All the keys
they have to open doors inside their own West seem
useless where the lands of Africa or Asia are concerned.
Over there, as they see it, the languages, beliefs, customs
and races have the peculiarity of being "Oriental"which
must mean that they have nothing in common with the
West, that they stem from absolutely different human
themes. To learn anything about them one would have
to start from zero, to set out on a long road of hard study.
To these Westerners, the East is another world. It is
another blocnot hostile, certainly, but radically diffe¬
rent, closed, mysterious. They know that it is possible
to stay there for a long time without understanding
anything; certain travellers have furnished the living
proof of this. The realization that more than half of
all human beings are Asiatic, Oriental, is not always an
encouragement to pierce the mystery; on the contrary,
it may have the opposite effect.
East and West are vague terms. Where does one end
and the other begin? Yet the words must have some reality,

at least in people's minds, since they have been used for so
long without being worn out, since the "East-West prob¬
lem" has existed. But if we admit that they evoke basic
differences, and that very often we can say, "This is
Oriental, that is not," then We must name the criteria
for our judgements. At least five criteria come to mind:
geography, races, languages, religions and social forms.
Bengali not more Oriental than Gaelic
We must not put too much trust in "natural" or "ideal"
frontiers. The difference between East and West
is certainly not a question of a few degrees of
longitude east or West of any particular meridian. From
the point of view of an Italian, Marrakesh is certainly in
the East, Sydney in the West. "Natural frontiers" shift
like the others. To Athenians of the fifth century b.c. the
East meant Asia and the Persian Empire. A thousand years
later Athens itself, and Byzantium and Alexandria, had
become part of the East. As for the Persians, they continu¬
ed, as for centuries past, to deal with Turkish horsemen
and Chinese traders: to them, these were the Orientals.
Shall we say that today "Eastern" means essentially
"non-European?" Hardly, for the connotations generally
linked with the term "Eastern" would not exist in most
of Africa except those parts where the Moslem religion
is dominant or the Arabic language is spoken; and
"Eastern" certainly does not include the territories occupi¬
ed by the American Indians or the Polynesians although
these are "non-European." In general, we must admit
that The East includes Asia and North Africa, without
stopping to wonder why this Asia includes the Celebes
and not Madagascar and especially without supposing
that a Syrian, a Kirghiz, a Javanese or a Tibetan feels
himself a member^of a tight "Asiatic" or "Oriental"
community.
Races? There is one called yellow, rich in varied
families, which has always lived principally in Asia and
the Far East. Beyond this we cannot be specific: it is
clear that races are as inextricably mixed in Asia as in
Europe. Furthermore, the same races may often be
found in both continents. Anthropologists talk about
Mediterraneans, Caucasians or Malays; they measure
skulls and separate curly hair from straight. What
conclusions may be drawn from these uncertain classi¬
fications? That the fishermen of Latakia resemble those
of Barcelona, and the peasants of the Punjab are much
like the Serbs? And that in the picturesque field of
appearance, bearing, gestures and costumes the differences
are much more striking between North and South than
between East and West? Questions and speculations like
these will not get us very far.
There are also languages proper to Asia: Chinese, Japa¬
nese, the Tibeto-Burmese group, the Dravidlan group,
and also Turkish and the Semitic languages, if you will,
though they are not confined to Asia. But from Lake Van
to the Deccañ Plateau, more than three hundred million
persons speak languages classified as Indo-Iranian or
Indo-European, related to all the Latin, Slavic and Ger¬
manic idioms. The East therefore cannot be defined as
the territory of Oriental languages; our languages, from
Greek to Gaelic, have no more and no less Oriental an
origin than does Bengali; and two old nations of Europe
which speak idioms known as Finno-Ugrian, as un-Aryan
as possible, are no less Western for that.
As for beliefs, it is not superfluous to mention the
spread of a religion which defines itself as universal, a
spread which sometimes preceded, sometimes accompanied
European commercial or colonial expansion in the East.
It is clear, nevertheless, that in so far as religious tra¬
ditions model the culture of peoples and the face of
nations, the presence of several million
Christians does not prevent Japan, China,
India, Viet-Nam or Indonesia, for instance,
from being countries of "Oriental"
religions.
Furthermore, the most venerable beliefs,

the most deeply rooted cults, do not necessarily confer
an exceptional character on countries situated in a larger
cultural ensemble: an Adriatic country may have a
majority of Moslems without belonging to the East for
that reasonjust as Lebanon, for example, derives a
special personality from its Christian majority, but a
personality which manifests itself in an Arab context. As
for small minorities, fervent and influential though they
may be, it seems impossible nowadays for them to change
perceptibly the climate of a civilization. If there were a
million English Buddhists in Great Britain, that Would
not make one Oriental the more.
On the other hand, everyone remembers that Christian¬
ity was in the beginning just as "Eastern" a religion as
Islam or as Judaism, source of both the others. It is
obvious that the faith which was gradually to animate
a new Europe seemed at first, to the conscious citizens
of the Roman Empire, simply one more exotic cult (incom¬
patible, furthermore, with wholesome traditions) among
all those that exalted Orientals were coming to preach in
the West.
It may be replied,, not without reason, that in the
twentieth century th'e Christian churches consider their
doctrines radically different from the beliefs most gener¬
ally held, let us say, in India, Tibet or Ceylon. But it
should be added that the same position would also be
affirmed, in the very same terms, by the Moslems. It is
likewise true that if a Japanese speaks of Oriental reli¬
gions he is probably not thinking of Islam any more than
of Christianity.
All in all, the criteria on which We presume to found
so many judgements seem somewhat confused. There
remains one, however, which is sometimes presented 'as
surer or more tangible: that of social progress, generally
linked with industrial progress. If this yardstick were
applied, the East would be a vast realm of under-indus¬
trialized nations in which agrarian civilizations and
feudal or patriarchal societies still prevail. And this,
incidentally, is why we see so many generous persons, in
Europe and still more In America, explaining to Easterners
the advantages of modern techniques and the virtues of
democracy. It would seem, however, that these lessons
are addressed to a global, abstract audience, and never to
one particular people or another. For if there still exists
a very small number (among the weakest) whose system
of government does not correspond to accepted popular
norms, there is almost no country that has not been
touched or permeated by an industrial revolution which,
in some cases, took place a long time ago.
Nobody is entirely unaware of the production of the
Japanese or Chinese steel works, or of the textile factories
of Egypt or Pakistan. But in the imaginary portraits
most Westerners have of Eastern nations, these industrial
realities seem to count for less than the relics of legend
and the survivals of the past. On the road to Trombay,
the Indian centre for nuclear research, a tourist Will
photograph buffalo carts. On his return he will describe
the buffalo carts, going into ecstasies over their poetic
antiquity. He will forget the atomic reactors; he has
reason to suspect that it is not feudal obeisance and
caste taboos that make them work. In a word, they do
not fit in with his picture of "eternal India."
Thus the economic lag of certain Asian countries (and
not of all) takes on enormous proportions in the picture
we habitually paint for ourselves of the East. This exag¬
geration flatters the good conscience of a West proud of
its technical advances, and likewise flatters certain of
its sentimental tastes which are also nourished by novels
and films.
A great many Westerners have an avowed or secret
hankering for a peaceful rural society, for human contacts
without clashes or surprises within the reassuring frame¬
work of village harmony and family hierarchies for a
simple life, slow and regular, with deeprooted customs and
unchangeable beliefs. Not finding this idyllic existence
at home, they are prone to look for it in a legendary
East; and the contradictions that a real East would
oppose to them might only disturb their dreams those
dreams that are also called prejudices. So in their nostal¬
gia for some kind of antique purity, quite honest travellers,
even men of science, cannot always resist the temptation
to identify the East with a patriarchal handicraft system.
If the latter has disappeared from a country, the whole
nation seems to have betrayed them to wallow in mercan¬
tile regimentation.
From the great discoveries
to the time of disenchantment
Since the "great discoveries," the rise of seafaring
nations and conquering commerce, and the power¬
ful European expansion in the Atlantic as well as
in central Asia and the Indian Ocean, contacts bet¬
ween East and West have become a daily affair. On May
29, 1453, the Turkish power was installed in Europe for
more than four centuries, and on May 18, 1498, Vasco de
Gama landed in Calicut. Peoples, rather than individuals,
were mutually to discover one another. The West arrived
in more and more numerous successive or permanent
delegations, with differing methods but with curiously
similar aims. In its Portuguese, Spanish, Dutch, British,
French or Russian species, persons in Ormuzd, Goa,
Manila, Delhi, Canton, Rangoon, Jakarta and Peking
watched the advance of Europe.
In most cases, these mass revelations were terribly
disappointing. As the peoples involved discovered their
diversity, they saw their differences through a magnifying
glass but denied all justification for these differences;
each met the other and was exasperated to find him
"other."
The merchants, missionaries, soldiers, contractors and
judges who landed from Europe were in a hurry; impa¬
tient to buy, to sell, to build, to preach, to sign and to
make others sign. To understand? That takes patience.
In the eyes of the Indian or the Malay, these agitated
to
and enterprising Westerners had not come to understand
or appreciate. They seemed to be overly aware of the
differences' in his customs, his clothes, his beliefs, his food,
but were not the slightest bit interested in the reasons
for this way of life, this religion in his reasons no more
than they were in his language, his songs, his books. On
the contrary they preferred, from the start, to teach him
their practices and their doctrines all beautiful and good
things, no doubt, but which had an unfortunate tendency
to be imposed in the name of one or another far-off
monarch, or as a clause in a doubtful contract, and in
a spirit devoid of tolerance.
Under these conditions, there was room for negotiation,
astuteness, political or military solutions, but not for the
understanding of cultures. It was precisely the cultures
the art, the intellectual traditions, the history, the
spiritual life that the visitors refused to consider except
in the most superficial fashion, so that they might call
them unintelligible.
There were some outstanding exceptions, of which the
most notable, up to the nineteenth century, were probably
certain Catholic missionaries. Every time the Jesuits
could accomplish their work freely in India, for example,
or in China, and more briefly in Japan real human, and
fruitful, relations were established. These Italian, Ger¬
man or French priests knew how to make an honest

effort to understand the refinements of the Chinese and
Japanese civilizations, and the elevation of Hindu thought.
They conceived their mission not as that of masters, but
as that of collaborators, seeking to adapt the moral riches
of Christianity to the old traditions of their new lands.
In India certain of them wrote works in Marathi or
Tamil which still figure among the classics of Indian
letters. In China their scientific contribution was parti¬
cularly valuable, and while Japan was still cloistered,
in the beginning of the nineteenth century, its astrono¬
mers secretly imported the mathematical treatises that
these Jesuits had composed in Chinese in their Manchu
observatories. Only in a very recent period Was this
collaboration renewed and developed, thanks especially to
the rise of the studies in philology, history and philosophical
criticism carried on by the scholars known as Orientalists.
Among the European and American students Who
harnessed themselves to the essential task of exploring
the literary patrimony of the peoples of the Eastin
whom most of their compatriots were interested only
through a desire to exploit material wealth several
became celebrated and exercised an immediate influence
on the poets and philosophers who read their work. They
revealed forgotten eras, treasures of thought and lyricism
whose existence had never been suspected before.
But in spite of the admirable work of the Orientalists,
in spite of the new horizons they opened to cosmopolitan
culture, Europe did not seem in the least to believe that
their studies had given it any more understanding of the
contemporary Hindus, Iranians or Chinese.
Yet we must remember that it is probably impossible
to penetrate the literature, art and culture pf a people
whose values one denies from the start, and to whom one
hardly concedes the right to affirm its personality on any
plane. Under such conditions a people can be observed
only as an object; one can only stare with curiosity at
its peculiarities or mysteries. The political and economic
relations of the West with Asia and Africa were such,
for 150 years, that it was rarely possible to talk on those
terms of brotherhood and mutual esteem which are
essential If understanding is to be reached. The youth
of Bengal, Teheran or Sumatra studied in the Western
fashion; they learned that not only mathematics and
chemistry but also all contemporary literature, all modern
thought, were Western. A few Europeans delighted in
The Tale of Genji, but millions of Japanese read Shakes¬
peare, Gibbon, Goethe, Dickens and Zola.
And yet Japan had never lost its freedom. Many other
peoples, living under various regimes that were dependent
in law or in fact, felt that in matters of culture as well
as of government they were denied the right to speak.
They were encouraged to learn (sometimes); they were
never asked to teach, never asked to explain themselves.
The most they could do was to give information to such
Investigators as deigned to ask them questions. For the
rest, specialists would marshal all the resources of
Western erudition to study their jargon, their folklore
and their old monuments. Then in the end, in spite of
so many efforts, functionaries high and low, tourists and
novelists would complain that they could not understand
these people sometimes refined, sometimes backward,
always secretive, dissimulatlve, suspicious.
Any Easterner who might read these lines would see
certain quite concrete historical situations reflected in
them. Many Westerners, too, know that such situations
were at the origin of a great number of resigned judge¬
ments on "psychological barriers" and on the "impene¬
trable threshold" of various "Asian mentalities."
This time of disappointment has not been entirely for¬
gotten. Yet the men of our century have generally recog¬
nized a simple truth often neglected by their fathers:
that peoples, like individuals, can understand one another
only as equals.

B Not-so-secret passages
of art, music and letters
!n the effort at understanding to which Unesco invites
us an educational enterprise in the broadest sense of
the word there is no place for mirages. What we are
trying to know and understand are cultural values,
and these values belong to nations, not to blocs. That is
why it is wise to begin by dismissing the idea of an
"East" which prevents us from seeing the real countries,
the living peoples of Asia and Africa.
To the degree in which we are the heirs of past gene¬
rations, histories and history books are inevitable. Good
works of reference can serve to fill the gaps in incomplete
or badly balanced teaching. But such books cannot
replace more modest volumes Written by nationals of the
countries in question. While it is useful to know the
broad lines of the history of China as it unfolded in the
framework of a universal evolution, we need also to learn
something of the history of China as the Chinese them¬
selves see it, and as they present it to others. For past
events, however important they may have been, count less
than the memory of them which has been kept, or
rediscovered, and less than the interpretation given by
the guardians of that memory. In this sense, "historical
heritages" mean nothing except in a popular perspective.
As for the great religions which, by definition, address
themselves to men and women of all times, no one would
think of questioning them through the intermediary of
informers without authority. Obviously it is not neces¬
sary to be a Christian or a Buddhist to describe a
ceremony at Lourdes or Bangkok, or to analyse St. Paul's
Greek or the Pali of the Buddhist canon. But neither

reporting nor literary criticism can presume the right to
penetrate the spirit of a cult, of a faith, of a church.
And here again, one can really understand only from the
inside. The sacred books of Buddhism and of Islam are
easy to find. Furthermore, Buddhists and Moslems of
our day frequently compose, for the benefit of outsiders,
the sort of commentaries and biographies which Western
writers used to undertake.
For Hinduism, the documents are still more abundant,
in varying degrees of popularization. Among them, one
may easily surmise that it is often advantageous to
choose works by Hindu authors, who generally do not
pretend to reveal mysteries or advise practices in the
inspired tones which certain of their European proselytes
used to adopt. Fortunately the best Orientalists today,
on both sides of the Atlantic, are conscientious translators
and faithful interpreters Who do not believe themselves
either superior or inferior to the spiritual groups they
are presenting. It may be regretted only that their
works reach so few readers.
The situation is the same where philosophies and
mysticisms are concerned, if one distinguishes them from
religious teachings properly speaking. Whether one is
interested in Confucian thought or Taoism, the Vedantic
theses of Shankara or Nimbarka, the metaphysics of
al-Farabi or the visionary accounts of Avicenna, the
basic texts exist and are within the comprehension of

In Japan, writes A. Coomaraswamy, the distinguished Orientalist, the

the most meticulous and formal techniques... perhaps It is the pro-

precise forms, but actually needs them. Above, Japanese flute players.
Westerners; they are no more or less hermetic than the
writings of Malebranche, Berkeley or Hegel.
Novels, poetry and the drama obviously present fewer
obstacles. Today as yesterday, every time a Western
reader has been able to acquaint himself with authentic
texts, he has drawn joy and profit from them. Unfortu¬
nately good translations are still all too few, and despite
some real commercial successes, like those of the works
of Arthur Waley (1), those which do exist are rarely
published in a format and at a price which would make
them popular. But several publishers are at present
making notable efforts in this respect, and the field Is
one in which Unesco is playing an important role through
its Collection of Representative Works; an effort is being
made to enrich the Oriental series of this collection as
rapidly as possible.
Doors to Japan's literary treasures
It is a mistake, then, to give up the search for good
translations while comforting oneself with the thought
that in 10 years the literatures of Asia will be more
easily accessible than they are today. There are so many
readers who are hardly beginning to be concerned with
these literatures that it would be superfluous to pity them
for lacking the necessary books.- To take a single
example in a language reputed to be difficult, and which
translators began to tackle only in a relatively recent
period, Japanese poetry, drama, essays and novels are
really at the disposal of millions of Westerners who do
not even seem to suspect it.
In English, French and German and to a lesser degree
in other European languages these Westerners may read
the principal anthologies of poetry, from the Man'yoshu
to the Six Collections; the novelists and memorialists of
the Heian period (Murasaki Shikibu, Sei Shonagon); the
story-tellers and essayists from Kamo No Chomei to
Yoshida Kenko; the great writers of the seventeenth
century; novelists like Saikaku; poets like Basho; dra¬
matists like Chikamatsu Montaemon;
curious writers, of the eighteenth century
like Uëda Akinari, and so on. As for
contemporaries, several poets have been
presented in the West; there also exist
translations of several plays and some
twenty novels.

TWO FACES OF ASIA. When life is good
the smiles of mother and child reveal a joy
that words can never express. Around the .
world human needs are Inexorably alike-
love, food, clothing, work, sleep and relaxa¬
tion. When these are met, life is indeed
good. But Asia also shows the twisted, pain¬
ful face of hunger. Only a decade ago ¡t was
found that one-third of mankind was con¬
suming three-quarters of the world's food
production. Asia, with 55% of the world's
people, only disposed of 1 7%. Since then
food crops have increased but so have popu¬
lations. Famine is still a grim reality.
Victor Sassoon, Bangkok
It must be admitted that these publications are
insufficient and it should be noted in passing that they
far from equal in number the Japanese translations from
the literatures of Europe- and America. But what should
be emphasized is the resources that they already offer,
since this quickly-jotted-down list contains key works
that a Westerner has the right to demand if he is not
to "ignore Japan."
It must be agreed that the best-beaten route to the
cultures of the East, as to those of the West, remains the
path through books, even though works of art, song and
the dance would speak a more direct and more attractive
language where many people are concerned. In spite of
the great ease of travel of which the twentieth century
is so proud, theatrical companies do not move about
much and, like musicians, hardly visit any foreign cities
except the capitals. And in spite of the progress of
photography and electronics, good reproductions of paint¬
ings and sculpture in the field of Asian art are as rare
commercially as are good recordings of classical Oriental
music.
Aside from such material obstacles, though, is it really
more difficult to become interested in Chinese painting
than in the Chinese novel, in Turkish ceramics than in
Turkish poetry? Does it take more effort to acquire an
Introduction to the music of Eastern peoples than to learn
something about their literary works? Those Westerners
who have made up their minds to listen to Indian, Bali-
nese or Near Eastern music, instead of lolling in lazy pre-
14
judlces about "monotonous chanting" and "strange quar¬
ter-tones," perceive that they are entering a musical uni¬
verse which though it is certainly not that of Mozart, has
beauties which are no harder to appreciate than those of
Pierrot Lunaire or the Marteau sans Maître. Once the
threshold has been crossed, no one will find insurmount¬
able difficulties in obtaining the best records produced
in Benares, Cairo, Istambul or Rabat pending the greatly
increased number of concerts which are to be organized
in the West by the Association for Oriental Music and
the International Council of Music.
' On the other hand, it is doubtful if any similar
society will succeed in making known and appreciated to
an equal degree the innumerable masterpieces which
sculptors, painters, architects, engravers, weavers, potters
and goldsmiths have piled up through the centuries from
Korea to Morocco. Yet many of these treasures enrich
the great museums of Europe and America; several
Western capitals have even housed them in special insti¬
tutions Where the public may go at leisure to study six¬
teenth-century Persian tapestries or Afghan ivories or
Tibetan painting.
But the public does not rush to get in. The audience
that would be reached, even in small towns and villages,
by unambitious exhibitions particularly of good repro¬
ductions of paintingswould be more numerous; and, as
experience has shown, it would generally be enthusiastic.
In this field there is a great task to be undertaken by
universities, museums and youth movements; we must

hope that the publication of reproductions and inexpen¬
sive albums will be further developed, and that the prac¬
tice of holding travelling exhibitions may become general.
But we may conclude, even now, that although the
avenues leading to a knowledge of the arts of the East are
not so broad as those which lead to its literatures, they
are not, any more than the latter, closed or secret.
Even if he consents to identify his values with those of
his nation, no man confines himself to those expressed in
the works and the monuments of the past. He may
respect these latter, cite them very frequently or vene¬
rate them, without, for this reason, regarding them as
the total explanation of his acts or the inspiration of his
whole life. So for anyone who wants to understand the
peoples of the East to about the same degree as he
understands his neighbours, a knowledge of their cultural
history is indispensable. Yet a knowledge of their con¬
temporary development is no less necessary.
In other words, Asia and Africa are situated in time,
and we are now in the second half of the twentieth cen¬
tury. Up to a certain point the prestige of ancient litera¬
tures, the silhouettes of mosques, pagodas, Angkors and
Boro Budors form a screen between the Western observer
and the modern countries which nevertheless live on
other things besides these books and these edifices. This
word "modern" shocks people who prefer to imagine an
East opposed to machines, one which is becoming indus¬
trialized in spite of itself under the influence of
Westerners of the atomic age.
The reality Is very different. Certain countries of the
East have a great lag to make up; but already their
progress is much more rapid than the experts were pre¬
dicting ten or fifteen years ago. In this field, changes
hardly obey cultural imperatives; they follow the rhythm
of investments. On the. other hand, it is true that all
the countries of the East do not enjoy the techniques and
the social advantages which characterize "twentieth-cen¬
tury civilization". But in varying degrees one may say
the same of all the .countries of Europe and America,
without exception. Even the richest and best equipped
have their forgotten lands, their anachronistic survivals
or their underdeveloped classes. And if we are talking
about the atomic age, no nation lives in the atomic age ;
none yet possesses the new installations or the equality
in abundance that ought to accompany this age of
human maturity.
Westerners know perfectly well that Tokyo, Delhi,
Peking, Cairo, Singapore and Karachi are living in the
same century as New York, London and Berne. It is not
sure that they like to think of these poetic-sounding capi¬
tals as cities as proudly modern as their own sometimes
as sadly modern, depending on the hour of the day and
the particular neighbourhood. Yet no
country has a monopoly on reinforced
concrete, colossal hotels, traffic jams, neon
signs or Industrial suburbs. But must we
depend on our imagination to know what
Eastern cities are like? How can we guess

what Chinese metal-workers of Japanese salesgirls do
after work? What kind of homes do they go back to?
What kind of hopes?
How can we see this total present-day picture: urban
and industrial life, customs, street scenes and family
gatherings, fields and workshops, popular fairs and nation¬
al holidays, the atmosphere in temples and schools?
Unless we are to set out on a ceaseless round of travel,
we have to depend on the mass information media, espe¬
cially the press and the cinema; and it seems certain
that we shall be able to count on them to fulfil this
essential task.
Newspapers publish articles on one Eastern country or
another, and many of these reports are excellent: they
provide a wealth of detail set in an intelligible whole;
they furnish valuable information concerning living con¬
ditions, political opinions, economic prospects. Illustrat¬
ed magazines have published admirable portraits of a
family, a village, a countryside. Unfortunately these
successes cannot erase the memory of other writings, too
brilliant to be honest, whose authors Were obviously less
anxious to inform than to please. In these cases only
the strangest and most exceptional characteristics of a
people, or a city, hold the limelight; the authors seem to
fear that they would bore their readers if they used the
more subdued colours which generally convey the ordi¬
nary existence of people and countries.
Troops of bagpipers & Cossack choirs
Sometimes those who want to understand the East
even need to be warned against certain documen¬
taries which are both fascinating and scientific:
ethnographic films whose character is likely to be sadly
misunderstood by the public. For the average cinema-
goer may have no way of knowing that the Bedouins in
their tents do not represent "the Arabs", or that the tiger-
hunters of Assam do not represent India any more than
the luxuriously armed tourist they are escorting repre¬
sents the United States of America. On a less scientific
level, the folklore of many a pleasant short fllm may
suggest nations peopled exclusively by young temple
dancers or tambourine players to spectators who would
feel indignant if Scotland were symbolized exclusively by
a troop of bagpipers or the Union of Soviet Socialist
Republics by a Cossack choir.
Western countries never appear either very distant or
very self-effacing to the inhabitants of Eastern cities
endowed with American automobiles and enriched with
products of the mechanical, electrical, chemical and tex¬
tile industries of most of the countries of Europe. In so
far as the Asian and African nations are in process of
development, and count on foreign aid to hasten their
economic equipment, they unleash intense competition
which, needless to say, goes far beyond simply mercantile
aims; there is no exporting nation which does not shower
them with more or less discreet publicity, or provide them
with goodwill ambassadors or technical missions, some¬
times in impressive numbers. The inhabitant of an
Indonesian, Thai, Indian, Persian or Arabian city may
thus have the feeling that the West is With him every
day, garish or raucous, on posters, on the roads, in the
shops, in the cinema. To him the idea of studying this
West more closely may seem faintly amusing.
It is clear that trade, consumer goods and even propa¬
ganda do not in any case embody the essential of cultural
values. But to the man In the street, this truth does not
always appear to be self-evident. Cultivated people, on
the other hand, will admit it willingly that goes without
saying and yet their difficulties are none the less great.
Some of them, who have studied in secondary schools
16
and universities of a purely Western type, and Who are
as familiar with Western civilization as with their own
country, have trouble realizing that they are, after all,
exceptional, and that the problem of the appreciation of
foreign cultures has not yet been touched where most of
their compatriots are concerned. Others seem to feel
that they know the West thoroughly because they have
learned a European language. Almost all meet discourag¬
ing obstacles in the history of Wars and colonization: it
is sometimes hard to distinguish between the themes of
politics and those of culture, and there are in all longi¬
tudes people who prefer to close their eyes and ears to
the literature or the arts of a nation of whose government
they disapprove.
Oriental serenity vs. Rock 'n* roll
Such factors explain a certain self-satisfaction, a cer¬
tain attitude of ironic retreat. Intellectual curiosity
regarding the West is surely not the most prevalent
virtue in all Eastern circles. The consequences of this
may be noted in the sweeping judgements Which, for
example, condemn the "Western spirit" whose notorious
materialism is assumed to characterize Europe and the
Americas from end to end. To materialism a scandalous
sequence of other "isms" is usually added: imperialism,
alcoholism, and so on. A West full of unemployed workers,
brash militarists, juvenile gangsters and adulterous wives
surely cannot have much to teach.
If a man thinks he knows everything about the Wester¬
ners' will to power and their basic anxiety, he does not
ask whether something more than mere appetite does
not lie at the origin of this fever, this spirit of conquest.
If he identifies the West with its industrial techniques, he
supposes that it will go on producing machines and more
machines useful, dangerous or amusing; he does not
stop to consider that intellectual, social and even spiritual
discipline may explain a scientific progress that has been
developing, after all, for 400 years.
In other words, to the naïve ignorance of many Wester¬
ners concerning the East there corresponds, where more
than one Easterner is concerned, a partial acquaintance
with the West, insufficient to prevent serious errors as to
cultural values. Certain critics, for example, cannot
In many parts of Asia, the transformation of
the economy, which in Europe was spread
over two centuries, is being effected in the

resist the temptation to oppose the serenity of the Chi¬
nese peasant to the vogue for rock'n' roll, a venerable
swami to Hitler, the atomic bomb to Iraq's sanctuaries of
Kerbela. It may be hoped that the cultivated public in
the East will feel more and more called to explore and
appreciate the deeper realities where the Western peoples
are concerned a history, a life of the mind which are
not revealed either in propaganda or in the export trade.
If Europeans and Americans may be advised to try to
understand a young and lucid East, stripped of its pictu-
resqueness and "immobility", then Easterners might well
take as a temporary theme a mysterious West, charged
with ancient contradictions and often fonder of pure
research than of wealth and comfort. It is not a
question of substituting one cliché for another, but of
looking for the almost secret truths that are hidden
under apparently incontrovertible appearances. Thus,
for example, a man who thinks he has an adequate pic¬
ture of the United States would do well to forget
Hollywood for a moment and turn his attention to Ame¬
rican poets and American monks; the number of the first
as well as the second may seem surprising. From an¬
other point of view, an Easterner will doubtless find it pro¬
fitable to try to find out what romantic German music
means to the millions of men and women, from Moscow
to Buenos Aires, who listen to it with such tireless fervor.
In the West as in the East, everyone educated enough
to measure the extent of his own ignorance ought to be
able to replace accepted ideas with the personal study
that is in every case deserved by other peoples... their
books, their paintings, their music, their systems of
thought, their ways of living. Schools, publishers, and
various national and international organizations will
doubtless be called on to furnish the means and the
opportunity for this study. Naturally, each of us will
remember that it is always Wise to suspend judgement
on men and on cultures until one has read, seen,
listened and understood.
One final question: If We follow Unesco's suggestions if
we try to see the nations of the East in their historical
reality, and to understand their cultures as broadly as is
possible for a non-specialist who is simply curious about
the works and the ways of his fellows if we do this, what
will we have achieved? What will be the result of these
explorations?
One might solemnly reply that we Will have contributed
to the coming of a peaceful civilization, global, and fra¬
ternal. That is possible, after all. But it is more certain
that there are some very simple qualities to be acquired,
some virtues which are not so common: modesty, for
example, and tolerance. No one is so vain of his nation¬
al culture as he who knows no other; conversely, it is
difficult not to respect a people whose masterpieces one
loves, whose joys and sorrows one senses.
To know the literature,, the arts, the thought of a
nation, to know its traditions, its teaching methods and
its social problems, its costumes and its cooking none of
this necessarily brings about any practical consequences.
Ordinarily these studies have the effect of refining the
intelligence and sensitivity. They teach that men must
not remain strangers to men. They lead one to realize
that there is a human unity, rich in numerous forms
which struggle against monotony. They lead one to per¬
ceive this unity in the highest works of peoples, and not
only in their elementary needs.
The people of a country, a city and even of a street
are extremely varied and unpredictable; we shall never
really know them. Yet knowing what they admire, what
is recited, read or sung around them, we are not ignorant
of them either. Furthermore, we will judge them the
less summarily as we know these things a little better.
To esteem is not always to judge. The cathedral of
Chartres and the tragedies of Corneille, Hamlet and the
Novum Organum, the Well-Tempered Clavichord and the
Critique of Pure Reason do not permit us to judge the
French, the English of the Germans of today; and one
would generally be Wrong to judge Westerners by their
poems or their theologies.
Yet these works, these monuments, these revelations
are the patrimony of Westerners; if not examples and
terms of reference for them, at least living and fruitful
images. It is worth the trouble to familiarize ourselves
with the corresponding images which inspire the peoples
of the far-off East, in order to understand them and
know what aims these peoples set for themselves. Per¬
haps We shall then understand that this patrimony
belongs to us too, and that these aims are in reality
our own.

UNESCO'S EAST-WEST MAJOR PROJECT
by Jacques Havet
The march of history has reduced physical distance,
multiplied the exchanges between peoples and the
opportunities for useful communication, but it has
also increased the risks of tragic misunderstanding.
Oriental and Occidental people now belong to the same
world, and this evolution must lead to solidarity.
But the West does not yet know the East. The studies
of Eastern civilizations made by scholars through cen¬
turies have too often escaped the notice of the general
public. The basic culture of the man of the West
remains centered on a limited heritage. Prejudices and
erroneous ideas continue to circulate.
The East, thrust daily into the presence of the West,
too often sees only an incomplete and distorted image.
The conventional picture that the cinema, press and
radio offer is added to the image left from the times of
trading and colonialism. Unavoidably, the picture of the
West that predominates Is that of a technology, detached
from its intellectual and spiritual bases.
In November 1956, Unesco's General Conference meeting
in New Delhi decided that the Organization should con¬
centrate important resources during the next ten years

on activities that would contribute to a closer relationship
between the East and the West. The entire Organization,
including groups working with it in each country, would
participate in this common enterprise. This appeal for
concentrated and continuous action is the meaning of
Unesco's "Major Project for Mutual Appreciation of Cul¬
tural Values of East and West".
For Unesco, three important points emerge from the
conclusions submitted by an international advisory
committee Which was set up to give guidance in the
implementation of the major project. Firstly an effort
must be made to eliminate prejudices and replace them
with knowledge of established historical and sociological
facts. Secondly an understanding of the spirit of each
culture, the way of life and the manner of thought and
feeling of each people must be promoted by presenting
facts in the perspective of history, geography and social
and economic conditions. Finally, more ways must be
developed to inform the general public in each country
about the most remote cultures.
In this ten-year programme, the spreading of factual
knowledge of all the cultures plays an important role.
But there can be no substitute for direct contacts between
human beings, the actual experience of meeting and
talking together; only that can bring about, in the words

of the advisory committee, a "new spirit" in relations
between the peoples.
This programme involves, first of all, the basic studies
and research needed for a proper understanding of the
meaning of East-West rapprochement; the investigation
of certain obstacles impeding mutual understanding; and
an elaboration of the cultural values of different peoples
so as best to interpret them to the general public in other
lands.
Plans already under way include international talks,
social science studies related to the evolution of the
modern East, fellowships for study and research on
various civilizations, and listing of the principal reference
works encyclopedias, histories, etc. of greatest use
to the layman. Later, new activities will be added: a
survey of the teaching of Eastern and Western literatures,
fellowships to train more translators capable of present¬
ing to the Western public the great representative books
of the East, the development of university institutions
for the study and presentation of cultural knowledge of
different regions and the organization of exchanges
between them.
The education of children, whose minds are still unpre¬
judiced, is an important field for long-term action.
Curricula, textbooks and other teaching materials, and
teaching methods, must be revised and adapted to that
objective. Unesco distributes materials, makes sugges¬
tions and organizes teachers' conferences to this end.
In many countries "associated schools" serve as a test¬
ing ground for the principles developed by Unesco. These
will continue, on an experimental basis, to help in
improving the teaching of cultural values. Member Sta¬
tes will be asked to produce books about their cultures for
use in the schools of other countries. Unesco will publish
brochures for the use of teachers and pupils.
Groups concerned with adult education and youth activ
ities are receiving help and suggestions from Unesco for
meetings and study courses among their leaders, for the
preparation of material on cultural values; for the devel¬
opment of exchanges among their members, activities
which may help to introduce into the life of a given
community some of the cultural riches from other areas.
For the general public, a programme for translating
the great works of modern and classical literatures of
East and West is now being developed; albums are pub¬
lished to spread knowledge of little-known masterpieces
of art, travelling exhibitions of art reproductions in
colour, are circulating in Member States. The most
recent one shows water colours of both East and West.
Unesco is to publish materials for projection, and inex¬
pensive volumes to give the public easy access to this sort
of material. In 1959, two parallel series of popular works
will be undertaken, in which each book will present a
historical panorama of the art or literature of one
country of the Orient.
Articles and sample broadcasts are being provided for
journalists and radio producers of East and West. Unesco
promotes co-operation and exchanges between them, pro¬
duces programmes of comparative music and documentary
film. Unesco is compiling lists of films for public screen¬
ing or TV, classified according to their cultural values.
These are the principal aspects of a co-ordinated effort
which should provide a basis or an example for activities
by Member States either in their own countries or on an
international scale.
Unesco's project is a long-term enterprise, but there is
already progress which promises well for the futurethe
development of new habits, the broadening of public
awareness of the need for better understanding between
East and West, an increase in cultural materials that can
lead to a genuine knowledge of the values of East and
West, and a weakening of the most dangerous prejudices.

History is not simply the mirror of the past: it often
influences our actions in the present and to a large
extent governs our behaviour in the future. The
world of yesterday is reflected in the virgin mind of the
schoolchild or student by his textbooks, and what he
learns from them will be projected by him onto the world
of tomorrow.
What the International Advisory Committee on the
Major Project is interested in is not pure historical
Research, but the translation of history and historical
writing into action, the extent to which acquired ideas
will be practically expressed by an increase or a lessening
of international understanding. What interests us, above
all, is contemporary history, history in the making.
The teachings of ancient or modern history undoubtedly
help to mould men's minds and deeds, but their effect is
usually confined to mental attitudes. They provide no
spur to direct action but leave in the subconscious mind
a strange amalgam of sympathy or aversion. They are
not decisive in producing definite immediate action.
Our object is to calm men's minds and ensure peace in
our time, which means that our activities should be essen¬
tially focussed on contemporary history.
Not, of course, that we shall ignore ancient or modern
history altogether especially We Orientals, for whom to
speak with brutal frankness the past was the time when
most of us were strong and powerful, with the world at
our feet. We, too, had our heyday, when our civilization,
our culture and our arms were without peer.
From our history, We can take hope for the future. I,
a Lebanese, an Asian by geographical definition, find two
grounds for pride in my country's history. Every man
who reads a book or sails the seas owes something to
the Phoenicians; arid we have our share in the fame
and splendour of Arab culture and civilization which
spread from the desert to the Pyrenees in a glorious
Unesco has set up an international advisory committee of experts
from over 20 nations to assist it in carrying out its 10-year Major

flowering of art and science. Forerunners of the
Renaissance, ancestors in their way of Leonardo da Vinci
and Christopher Colombus, custodians of the heritage of
Greece which they reverently transmitted to Europe and,
indirectly, discoverers of the New World and fathers of
algebra, chemistry and the pointed arch, the Arabs
contributed as much as any other people to the World's
progress.
The exploitation of coal marked the beginning of a de¬
cline for them. There was none in their territory (or they
were unable to find any). In general, they lacked a
source of energy, and when one was discovered deep be¬
neath the desert they no longer had the means of exploit¬
ing it.
There is a lesson to be learnt here. All this power and
glory, culture and civilization, which once had the mastery
and were the envy of the world, has shrunk in a bare two
or three centuries, to a few pages in the Encyclopaedia
Britannica! Nor is there any civilization or country which
can be sure of escaping such a twist of fate.
But we Orientals, reviewing this history, must set our¬
selves firmly against basking in our past glory, using it
as an excuse for living in a dream-world of yesterday,
and justifying our inactivity, divisions and vanity, as we
squander the noble heritage of our ancestors, by flaunting
the golden pages written by them in the face of the
marvelling West. What we need is just sufficient history
to avoid becoming exclusively concerned with the present
but not too much to lull us to sleep in a Capuan paradise
of the past. '
Passions are still hot so far as contemporary history
is concerned and many of the actors are still living. The
wounds have not yet healed, and conflicts of interests are
still unresolved.
World developments since 1914 have moved apace. All
We need do is to consider the facts, look at the map and
study the statistics. There has been a tremendous uphea¬
val, and this is especially true as regards the relations
between, the Orient and the Occident.
The post- 1914 period has been marked by the accession
of a whole host of States to independence. The influence
of the West or perhaps, to be more exact, one should
say. of Europe in particular (and, still more precisely, its

military and political presence or entrenchment) has
undergone an amazing decline. The contraction of this
Balzacian "'wild ass's skin" sums up the whole.drama of
modern times.
In What way can the history of these developments pro¬
mote better appreciation of mutual values? It is history
in the making, and, in some cases, still to make. To,
complete it, two lines of action would today have to be
contemplated, designed for different sets of school¬
children or students and based on two equally vital prin¬
ciples.
The first is oblivion. Our memories may be a millstone
round our necks. It is good now and then to deposit
them in the cloakroom of modern times and let them
stay there.
The new conception of history should be based on total
oblivion of one particular aspect of the past. People
must forget that they once occupied a country and had
to govern it by main force, that they exploited it econo¬
mically, humiliated it by all sorts of legal or devious
discriminatory practices, disparaged its culture and lan¬
guage and cast scorn on its institutions and faith; and
that it emerges from these passages in its history still
bruised in body and still suffering from the indignities to
its pride and self-respect. With all this over and done
with, there must be no hankering after the past: the
only possible reconquest is a cultural one.
What must be consigned to oblivion, above all, is the
concept of racial superiority, and those red, green and
blue patches which pictorially symbolized servitude or
domination, the relationship of the lord to his serfs or
slaves, on yesterday's atlases and Wall maps. I do not
think I am being over-paradoxical in stressing this seem
ingly trivial aspect; but who can say how much harm
has been done to the world by this insidious colour-mania
a symbol of possession for the one and a badge of shame
for the other? Our eyes must be trained to see With a
new vision.
History textbooks more than any others, reflect the
spirit behind them. We can count on the full support
and honest co-operation of all governments in the Orient
or the Occident in inculcating this spirit in their schools,
colleges and universities; and the rising generations,
having unlearned hatred or contempt, will extend the
hand of the friendship to each other across the seas. We
shall have restored the bridge of love and friendship.
I note with alarm, however, that so far I have mainly
expressed the Oriental point of view, much as I wanted
to slough off my old self: I Would be setting a bad
example, if I did not manage to shed that skin.
We are asking the Occident to forget; but We shall ask
the Orient to remember. That is the second principle.
We shall ask it to remember all the benefits conferred by
hygiene, science and education; the roads, ports and
hospitals that have been built and the modern techniques
which have been thrown open to it and on which its
salvation' depends; and to cherish the memory of the
devoted service given by teachers, doctors and missiona¬
ries, or even by soldiers Who Were all three in one. Nor
should it forgethowever paradoxical this may seem that
from its struggles as well as from the
example set it has often acquired a sense
of dignity and an understanding of
freedom, and become conscious, through its
tribulations of its historical, political or
national personality.

THE ORIENT TODAY
AND YESTERDAY
(Continued)
Let the
and the
The Occident never succeeded in hiding its true face
behind the mask it presented to us, and it reassumed its
true character whenever it dropped that mask in moments
of relaxation. These brief moments of truth enabled us to
model some of our oWn features on those of the Occident,
or rather to rediscover them, buried as they were under
centuries of servitude and oppression.
Especially must We not forget the language which was
brought to us, and through which we have made contact
With the new era; there is not one of us who does not
owe something in his educational make-up to that contri¬
bution. For myself, it is so much part and parcel of me
that I cannot speak of an outside contribution to designate
that language which has put us into touch with all the
technical and humanistic sciences and glorious new fields
of intellectual activity and enabled us to profit by the
fruits of world endeavour, to assimilate the achievements
of mankind as a whole and to merge them With our own.
Certain considerations should be singled out for special
study. In particular, action must be taken to combat dis¬
crimination. This new word for a very old phenomenon
still awaits precise definition. In essence, it covers in¬
equality of treatment based on prejudice, the prejudice
often being nothing more than a philosophical cloak
masking concrete material interests. Anything done in
this field will have a very beneficial effect.
Injured pride is at the root of very many of the mis¬
understandings existing between Orient and Occident.
Until recently, the Westerner, and more particularly the
European, was the master of the World, and the fount of
all power. That situation lasted for two or three gene¬
rations. How could it fail to produce a certain sense of
superiority, conscious or unconscious, which Was bound to
be reflected in action, Whether in a crude, concealed or
even in a courteous manner. It is this feeling which must
be overcome on the part of the Occident, and the Way
to do it is by explaining the historical facts.
We Easterners, too, are very sensitive on this point. We
often all too often give the impression of having been
flayed alive: the slightest remark upsets and irritates us.
Years and sometimes centuries of contempt or insult have
left us With hypersensitive skins. We are no longer
content with anything less than superlative praise. Our
accession to independence has transformed us neither
into States nor nations, nor into perfect beings.
It is understandable, after all, that in the first flush
of our recovered freedom, we should have let ourselves
become intoxicated by the magic of the word and the
reality of what it stood for. But today, one of the condi¬
tions for our survival and salvation is that we should see
ourselves more clearly, and expose and fight against our
failings, Weaknesses and indeed faults, accepting and in¬
viting criticism, comment and even friendly raillery.
I have referred particularly to action among school¬
children and students. This must be supplemented
by another form of action relating to another gen¬
eration entirely. Here We come up against a new pro¬
blem: that of the discontinuity of history.
The world does not stay still between the time We leave
the schoolroom or the university and the time when we
play an active part in life. The fact that the historical
process has quickened is now generally accepted. By a
sort of process of osmosis or contagion which can be
traced back to modern techniques, history has been shar¬
ing in the effects of the acceleration of means of commu¬
nication and information media.
Modern man has little time for reflexion, and the states¬
man is no exception to the rule. It needs a prodigious
effort of energy and Will on his part to turn inwards and
make a calm, careful and objective study of the facts. It
is even more difficult to look beyond national boundaries
and draw overall conclusions from unco-ordinated events
taking place in the four corners of the earth.
There is a Wide gulf between what the student has
learnt and What the man of action has failed to learn
and assimilate in a world which is in rapid and perpetual

motion. All this is even truer of the relations between
the Orient and the Occident.
We must think in terms of a revision of modern history
in respect of Orient-Occident relations, for the use of
adults. Let us be bold innovators in this respect.
What I have in mind would be the selection of a group
of Easterners, a body of travelling professors or lecturers,
as it Were, Who |would give courses at universities but
whose main rôle Would be primarily that of missionaries.
They Would act in a missionary spirit, and their courses
Would have to be -fairly Widely publicized. They would
spend a year in each country giving their audiences an
accurate picture of developments in their native lands.
There remains one final aspect: future prospects. What
we have to do, I suggest, is to write the history of future
relations between the Orient and the Occident and this
Without having recourse to fortune-tellers, seers or pro¬
phets!
Not that We can work out this history of tomorrow in
detail, but its main lines of development can be foreseen.
Once We have forgotten or unlearnt hatred, we shall have
to build anew; and, in that connexion, We shall have to
demonstrate, by suitable examples, the impossibility of
nationalistic isolation.
This brings us to a delicate point. There can be no
denying that there is a rising tide of nationalism
over a large part of the globe. It cannot be turned
back, and it is useless to oppose it: it must be harnessed.
Nationalism is out of date. It has come too làte in a
world Which is too old. It is, in any case, a necessary
stage, and the wise course might be to shorten that tran¬
sition from one state to another as far as possible. But
it Would be futile to ignore it, and even more so to
discount it.
Nationalism has not always been solely a reaction
against the Occident. The Arab countries, for example,
languished for centuries under Oriental oppression. Their
nationalism is a phenomenon which retains its purity just
because it is not channelled in a single direction.
It has to be accepted, as a necessary good or evil. And
I really mean "necessary": even if it is an outmoded
concept made obsolete by the advance of modern thought
and science, a dose or fit; of nationalism enables coun¬
tries Which have just achieved independence to gain a
clearer knowledge of themselves in all fields, and espe¬
cially in the cultural field. They rediscover their lan¬
guage, their literature, their poets, their historians and
(more rarely) their scientists.
This reawakening sometimes has its childish aspects.
Let us see to it that there is nothing repugnant about
it and that it is free from the excesses which sometimes
result in condemning the use of Arabic figures in the name
of Arab nationalism, or others of the same kind which
incidentally, are now on the wane, even Where they have
been found.
Once this outburst is over, another aspect of the prob¬
lem arises: the need for close collaboration in all. fields
and especially in that of culture, for exchanges in all
forms, for interpretation and interdependence, for action
directed along two distinct but not contradictory lines.
Such is the first task in Which a little nationalism does
not come amiss, to bring about the revival of a country's
culture and restore to it its former glory (for all cultures
are glorious), to invigorate and foster it, making it dyn¬
amic, modern and inspiring through contact with other
cultures in our case, the Western cultures or culture. And
this must be done straightforwardly and candidly with¬
out ulterior motives, and with that feeling of respect
Which is essential in any task. True there must be no
imitation, but neither must there be any hesitation in
learning.
What we have to do, above all, is to drive home the need
for human fellowship. That is yet another elementary
truth, but it seems essential today to repeat such truths
continually. They are accepted in principle but ignored
in practice.

In the mountain-rimmed, open spaces of Mongolia, children learn to ride when they are four or five years old on ponies which
are famed for their speed and hardiness. Automobiles can be used, even without roads, over great stretches of the flat dry
country, but the people rely mostly on horses for transportation and the mail is usually carried by men on relays of horses.

Since the middle of the 18th century, Europeans
have become accustomed to arranging the history
of civilizations in a series which, while chrono¬
logical, also signifies a grading of values. Tbe 18th
century French statesman and economist, Turgot,
himself visualized the evolution of history in three stages,
namely, the theological, metaphysical and empirical eras.
As empirical knowledge developed in Europe, Europeans
felt justified in considering themselves in the forefront
of progress and looking down on other civilizations as
backward.
This outlook is aptly described in the following terms
by Paul Hazard in his book on La pensée européenne au
XVIII' siècle : "'The virtuous Chinese and the wise
Egyptians were for ever being praised; but it had to be
admitted that neither China nor Egypt had fulfilled the
promises of early days. They had remained sunk in iner¬
tia, while the West had displayed tireless intellectual
curiosity. It had never ceased to do so, so that the
Greeks and Romans themselves were surpassed by the
present... and thus the new Europe was better than the
old... Not that its sons were without faults. Restless
and excitable, their history was one of incessant revolu¬
tions and their annals a tissue of misfortunes, follies and
crimes. Corrupted by luxury, they cruelly exploited the
inhabitants of the colonies they had conquered. Yet they
retained the right to be proud of themselves. Why had
the Asians and Africans not anchored in their harbours,
conquered their territories and imposed their authority
on the local princes? Because the Europeans were
stronger and they were stronger because they were wiser;
being wiser, they represented a more advanced state of
civilization."
This conviction of the superiority of the progressive
European spirit over people of other civilizations has been
very forcibly expressed in Hegel's Philosophy of History.

The Unesco Courier. December 1958
He took freedom as the central theme of history. The
essence of world history was, according to his famous defi¬
nition, progress in consciousness' of freedom. He consi¬
dered that history began in the Far East and then advan¬
ced through the Near East, Greece and Rqme, to culminate
in European civilization. He did not see cultures on the
same level as different possibilities inherent in Man's na¬
ture of representing himself and interpreting his position
in the world; on the contrary, looking back from the cul¬
tural heights of 19th century Europe, the old civilizations
of Asia and ancient European cultures appear as histori¬
cal stages which have been left behind.
All of us have had numerous occasions to realize that
the end of European colonialism does not mean the end
of the process of Europeanization which began to spread
through the World a century ago. On the contrary, this
process has been accelerated since the freed peoples of
Asia have themselves taken over, with all their energy,
the rebuilding and modernization of their economies,
States, and societies. No one can foretell the fate
of these ' peoples' ancient philosophical, religious and
artistic inheritance or foresee, whether a civilization,
forming a new chapter in human history, will
emerge from this confrontation.
In order to see the relationship between East and West
in proper historical perspective, however, it must be rea¬
lized that the development of modern technology means
a profound incision, not to say a break, even in Europe
itself. The life of a modern European is further removed
from the life of a townsman or countryman of Goethe's
day, some 150 years' ago, than the life of the latter was
'from that of a European in the early Middle Ages, a
thousand years ago. It is becoming increasingly clear
from historical research that the real turning point in
European' 'history was not in 1500, between the Middle
Ages and modern times, but at the time of the great
industrial, political and social revolution of the 18th and
19th centuries.
Man has taken it upon himself to burst his natural
bonds and to conquer time and space. Like technology,
economics and society have been drawn into the sphere
of planning and calculation. Our age is dominated by
technical considerations of a utilitarian nature and not
by respect for inherited values and traditions. For a
thousand years; the basic element of the European social
system was seignorial right and the privileged urban
community. This system, on which the old European
culture was based, has vanished. A propertied and edu¬
cated middle class and after that the working class, have
come to the fore as the determining factors in history,
and the process of social revolution, which began
150 years ago, has not yet come to an end. Educators
throughout the Western world are wondering what will
become of Europe's cultural and educational inheritance
and whether, for example, a classical education has any
real chance of survival in the present-day World.
In this uncertainty about its present-day civilization,
Europe is in a position which, despite all differences, is in
a sense comparable with that of the peoples of Asia, with
their ancient civilizations, who are in process of becoming
Europeanized. All civilizations are today facing the same
problem, namely, how to preserve an old and hallowed
cultural heritage, handed down through the ages, in our
modern world of technology and bureaucracy, and whe¬
ther it is even possible or desirable to preserve it. Do the
peoples of East and West realize that they are in the
throes of the same cultural crisis?
For the Westerner, it may be said that the fascination
of Asia lies in its traditional culture its old religions, phi¬
losophy, wisdom and art in comparison with which
modern Asian culture and Asian present-day problems
are unfortunately given less weight. Conversely, is it not
true that the attraction of Western civilization for the
A^ian peoples is to be attributed almost entirely to modern
scientific and technological progress, which has made
them forget the old European values?
Here, it appears necessary to establish a balance and
this might be a special task for Unesco under its East-
West Project. The Westerner, who looks upon free Asia
as an area where a great and immensely important move¬
ment is going on, must recognize that the attempt of the
Asian peoples to reconcile their venerable cultural tradi¬
tion with present-day industrial and technological needs
is a matter which concerns him also. Whether this
reconciliation is everywhere desired and whether, where
it is desired, it will succeed, is another question.
This aspect of the Asian situation is important to the
modern Westerner, concious of his Own cultural problems.
On the other hand, I wonder how far the Asian peoples
in process of adopting Western industrial practices and
technology are aware that this is only one aspect of
Western civilization. Industry and technology are the
offshoots of science and the latter is deeply rooted in the
intellectual, and I might even say spiritual, heritage of
Europe. A gulf divides the new Europe from the old and
yet modern Europe draws its life-blood from its intellec¬
tual past and its historical legacy.

UNESCO'S
TRIBUTE TO
MAHATMA GANDHI
Unesco is paying a special tribute
to Mahatma Gandhi. It renders
homage to both the person and the
writings of a man whose spiritual
influence has extended throughout
the world in a new book entitled
All Men Are Brothers, which pre¬
sents the life and thoughts of the
great teacher as set down in Gandhi's
own words. The aim of the texts
is to illustrate and make better
known the different aspects of
Gandhi's personality and writings.
The English edition will be followed
by French and Spanish versions
(See page 35). On pages 30 and 3 I
we publish a selection of Gandhi's
thoughts taken from All Men Are
Brothers. The complete introduc¬
tion to the Unesco volume specially
written by Sir Sarvepalli Radhak¬
rishnan, Vice-President of India, is
presented on the opposite page.

great teacher appears
AI once in* a while. Several
I centuries may pass by
I without the advent of
1 such a one. That by
which he is known is his
life. He first lives and then tells
others how they may live likewise.
Such a teacher was Gandhi. These
Selections from his speeches and
writings compiled, with great care
and discrimination by Sri Krishna
Kripalani will give the reader some
ideas of the workings of Gandhi's
mind, the growth and the practical
techniques which he adopted.
Gandhi's life was rooted in India's
religious tradition with its emphasis
on a passionate search for truth, a
profound reverence for life-, the ideal
of non-attachment and the readiness
to sacrifice all for the knowledge of
God. He lived his whole life in the
perpetual quest of truth: "I live .and
move and have my being in the
pursuit of this goal."
A life which has no roots, which is
lacking in depth of background is a
superficial one. There are some who
assume that when we see what is
right we will do it. Even when we
know what is right it does not follow
that we will choose and do right.
We are overborne by powerful im¬
pulses and do wrong and betray the
light in us. "In our present state
we are, according to the Hindu doc¬
trine, only partly human; the lower
part of us is still animal; only the
conquest of our lower instincts by
love can slay the animal in us." It
is by a process of trial and error,
self-research and austere discipline
that the human being moves step by
painful step along the road to
fulfilment.
Gandhi's religion was a rational
and ethical one. He would not
accept any belief which did not
appeal to his reason or any injunc¬
tion which did not commend to his
conscience.
f we believe in God, not
I merely with our intellect
I but with our whole being,
I we will love all mankind
I without any distinction of
I race or class, nation or
religion. We will work for the unity
of mankind. "All my actions have
their rise in my inalienable love of
mankind." "I have known no dis¬
tinction between relatives and stran¬
gers, countrymen and foreigners,
white and coloured, Hindus and
Indians of other faiths whether^
Musulmans, Parsees, Christians or"
Jews. I may say that my heart has
been incapable of making any such
distinctions." "By a long process of
prayerful discipline I have ceased
for over forty years to hate anybody."
All men are brothers and no human
being should be a stranger to another.
The welfare of all, sarvodaya, should
be our aim. God is the common
bond that unites all human beings.
To break this bond even with our
greatest enemy is to tear God him¬
self to pieces. There is humanity
even in the most Wicked.
This view leads naturally to the
adoption of non-violence as the best
means for solving all problems, na¬
tional and international. Gandhi
affirmed that he was not a visionary
but a practical idealist. Non-violence
is meant not merely for saints and
sages but for the common people
also. "Non-violence is the law of
our species, as violence is the law of
the brute. The spirit lies dormant
in the brute and he knows no law
but that of physical might. The
dignity of man requires obedience to
a higher law to the strength of
the spirit."
ANDHi was the first in
Gm human history to extend
I the principle of non-vio-
I lence from the individual
' to the social and political
plane. He entered poll-
tics for the purpose of experimenting
with non-violence and establishing
its validity.
"Some friends have told me that
truth and non-violence have no place
in politics and worldly affairs. I do
not agree. I have no use for them
as a means of individual salvation.
Their introduction and application
in everyday life has been my experi¬
ment all along." "For me, politics
bereft of religion are absolute dirt,
ever to be shunned. Politics con¬
cerns nations and that which con¬
cerns the welfare of nations must be
one of the concerns of a man who is
religiously inclined, in other words, a
seeker after God and Truth. For
me God and Truth are convertible
terms, and if any one told me that
God was a God of untruth or a God
of torture I would decline to worship
Him. Therefore, in politics also we
have to establish the Kingdom of
Heaven."
In the struggle of India's indepen¬
dence, he insisted that we should
adopt civilized methods of non¬
violence and suffering. His stand
for the freedom of India was not
based on any hatred for Britain. We
must hate the sin not the sinner.
"For me patriotism is the same as
humanity. I am patriotic because I
an human and humane. I will not
hurt England or Germany to serve
India." He believed that he rendered
a service to the British in helping
them to do the right thing by India.
The result was not only the liberation
of the Indian people but an increase
in the moral resources of mankind.

we wish to save the world, we should

Gandhi said: "I did not move a
muscle, when I first heard that an
atom bomb had wiped out Hiroshima.
On the contrary I said to myself:
"unless now the World adopts non¬
violence, it will spell certain suicide
for mankind." "In any future con¬
flict We cannot be certain that
neither side will deliberately use
nuclear weapons. We have the power
to destroy in one blinding flash all
that we have carefully built up across
the centuries by our endeavour and
sacrifice. By a campaign of propa¬
ganda we condition men's minds for
nuclear warfare. Provocative re¬
marks fly about freely. We use
aggression even in words; harsh
judgements, ill-will, anger, are all
insidious forms of violence.
In the present predicament when
we are not able to adjust ourselves
to the new conditions which science
has brought about, it is not easy to
adopt the principles of non-violence,
truth and understanding. But on
that ground we should not give up
the effort. While the obstinacy of
the political leaders puts fear into
our hearts, the common sense and
conscience of the peoples of the
world give us hope.
With the increased velocity of
modern changes we do not know
what the world will be a hundred
years hence. We cannot anticipate
the future currents of thought and
feeling. But years may go their
way, yet the great principles of satya
and ahimsa, truth and non-violence,
are there to guide us. They are the
silent stars keeping holy vigil above
a tired and turbulent world. Like
Gandhi we may be firm in our
conviction that the sun shines above
the drifting clöUds.

The world is siek
of hatred
Mahatma Gandhi
-* I have nothing new to teach the world.
Truth and non-violence are as old as the
hills.
* It has always been a mystery to me how
men can feel themselves honoured by the
humiliation of their fellow-beings.
k "Hate the sin and not the sinner" is a
precept which, though easy enough to
understand, is rarely practised, and that is
why the poison of hatred spreads in the
world.
k You have to stand against the whole
world although you may have to stand
alone. You have to stare the world in
the face although the world may look at
you with bloodshot eyes. Do not fear.
Trust that little thing in you which resides
in the heart and says: "Forsake friends,
wife, all; but testify to that for which you
have lived and for which you have to die."
k God has created different faiths just as
He has the votaries thereof. How can I
even secretly harbour the thought that my
neighbour's faith is inferior to mine and
wish that he should give up his faith and
embrace mine? As a true and loyal
friend, I can only wish and pray that he
may live and grow perfect in his own faith.
In God's house there are many mansions
and they are equally holy.
* Let no one even for a moment entertain
the fear that a reverent study of other reli¬
gions is likely to weaken or shake one's
faith in one's own. The Hindu system of
philosophy regards all religions as contain¬
ing the elements of truth in them and
enjoins an attitude of respect and reverence
towards them all. This of course pre¬
supposes regard for one's own religion.
Study and appreciation of other religions
need not cause a weakening of that regard;
it should mean extension of that regard to
other religions.
k Non-violence is the greatest force at the
disposal of mankind. It is mightier than
the mightiest weapon of destruction devised
by the ingenuity of man. Destruction is
not the law of the humans. Man lives freely
by his readiness to die, if need be, at the
hands of his brother, never by killing him.
Every murder or other injury, no matter
for what cause, committed or inflicted on
another is a crime against humanity.
k My experience, daily growing stronger
and richer, tells me that there is no peace
for individuals or for nations without
practising Truth and Non-violence to the
uttermost extent possible for man. The
policy of retaliation has never succeeded.
30
k My love for non-violence is superior to
every other thing mundane or supramun-
dane. It is equalled only by my love for
truth which is to me synonymous with non¬
violence through which and which alone I
can see and reach Truth. My scheme of
life, if it draws no distinction between
different religionists in India, also draws
none between different races. For me "A
man's a man for a' that."
* My non-violence does not admit of
running away from danger and leaving
dear ones unprotected. Between violence
and cowardly flight, I can only prefer vio¬
lence to cowardice. I can no more preach
non-violence to a coward than I can tempt
a blind man to enjoy healthy scenes. Non¬
violence is the summit of bravery. And in
my own experience, I have had no diffi¬
culty in demonstrating to men trained in
the school of violence the superiority of
non-violence. As a coward, which I was
for years, I harboured violence. I began
to prize non-violence only when I began
to shed cowardice.
Not knowing the stuff of which non¬
violence is made, many have honestly be¬
lieved that running away from danger every
time was a virtue compared to offering
resistance, especially when it was fraught
with danger to one's life. As a teacher
of non-violence, I must, so far as it is
possible for me, guard against such an un¬
manly belief.
I am not a visionary. I claim to be a
practical idealist. Religion of non-violence
is not meant merely for the rishis and saints.
It is meant for the common people as well.
Non-violence is the law of our species as
violence is the law of the brute. The spirit
lies dormant in the brute, and he knows
no law but that of physical might. The
dignity of man requires obedience to a
higher law, to the strength of the spirit.
Often does good come out of evil. But
that is God's, not man's plan. Man knows
that only evil can come out of evil, as good
out of good... The moral to be legitimately
drawn from the supreme tragedy of the
atom bomb is that it will not be destroyed
by counter bombs, even as violence cannot
be by counter violence. Mankind has to
go out of violence only through non-vio¬
lence. Hatred can be overcome only by
love. Counter hatred only increases the
surface, as well as the depth of hatred.
* It is impossible for one to be an interna¬
tionalist without being a nationalist. Inter¬
nationalism is possible only when national¬
ism becomes a fact, i.e., when peoples
belonging to different countries have orga
nized themselves and are able to act as one
man. It is not nationalism that is evil, it
is the narrowness, selfishness, exclusiveness
which is the bane of modern nations which
is evil. Each wants to profit at the expense
of, and rise on the ruin of, the other.
-* Interdependence is and ought to be as.
much the ideal of man as self-sufficiency.
Man is a social being. Without inter-relation
with society he cannot realize his oneness
with the universe or suppress his egoism.
His social interdependence enables him to
test his faith and to prove himself on the
touchstone of reality. If man were so
placed or could so place himself as to be
absolutely above all dependence on his
fellow-beings he would become so proud
and arrogant as to be a veritable burden
and nuisance to the world. Dependence on
society teaches him the lesson of huma¬
nity.
* What is the cause of the present chaos ?
It is exploitation, I will not say of weaker
nations by the stronger, but of sister
nations by sister nations. And my funda¬
mental objection to machinery rests on the
fact that it is machinery that has enabled
these nations to exploit others.

My notion of democracy is that under
it the weakest should have the same
opportunity as the strongest. That can
never happen except through non-violence.
k The true source of rights is duty. If
we all discharge our duties, rights will not
be far to seek. If leaving duties unper¬
formed we run after rights, they will escape
us like a will-o'-the-wisp. The more we
pursue them, the farther will they fly.
To me political power is not an end but
one of the means of enabling people to
better their condition in every department
of life. Political power means capacity to
regulate national life through national
representatives. If national life becomes
so perfect as to become self-regulated, no
representation becomes necessary. There
is then a state of enlightened anarchy. In
such a state every one is his own ruler. He
rules himself in such a manner that he is
never a hindrance to his neighbour. In the
ideal State, therefore, there is no political
power because there is no State. But the
ideal is never fully realized in life. Hence
the classical statement of Thoreau that that
government is best which governs the least.
I value individual freedom but you must
not forget that man is essentially a social
being. He has risen to his present status
by learning to adjust his individualism to
the requirements of social progress. Un¬
restricted individualism is the law of the
beast of the jungle. We have learnt to
strike the mean between individual freedom
and v i-b! restraint. Willing submission to
social íestraint for the sake of the well-
being of the whole society enriches both
the individual and the society of which one
is a member.
The golden rule of conduct is mutual
toleration, seeing that we will never all
think alike and we shall see Truth in frag¬
ment and from different angles of vision.
D,RD. Wadia, Panorama, Bombay
Conscience is not the same thing for all.
Whilst, therefore, it is a good guide for
individual conduct, imposition of that
conduct upon all will be an insufferable
interference with everybody's freedom of
conscience.
Differences of opinion should never
mean hostility. If they did, my wife and
I should be sworn enemies of one another.
I do not know two persons in the world
who had no difference of opinion, and as
I am follower of the Gita, I have always
attempted to regard those who differ from
me with the same affection as I have for
my nearest and dearest.
k We must be content to die, if we cannot
live as free men and women.
k Even the most despotic government
cannot stand except for the consent of the
governed which consent is often forcibly
procured by the despot. Immediately the
subject ceases to fear the despotic force, his
power is gone.
The true democrat is he who with purely
non-violent means defends his liberty and,
therefore, his country's and ultimately that
of the whole of mankind.
I do not want my house to be walled in
on all sides and my windows to be stuffed.
I want the cultures of all lands to be blown
about my house as freely as possible. But
I refuse to be blown off my feet by any.
I would have our young men and women
with literary tastes to learn as much of
English and other world-languages as they
like, and then expect them to give the
benefits of their learning to India and to
the world.
I am not sure that it is not better for
the children to have much of the prelimi-
The Unesco Courier. December 1958
nary instruction imparted to them vocally.
To impose on children of tender age a
knowledge of the alphabet and the ability
to read before they can gain general know¬
ledge is to deprive them, whilst they are
fresh, of the power of assimilating instruc¬
tion by word of mouth.
k I would develop in the child his hands,
his brain and his soul. The hands have
almost atrophied. The soul has been alto¬
gether ignored.
* A wise parent allows the children to
make mistakes. It is good for them once
in a while to burn their fingers.
* To call woman the weaker sex is a libel;
it is man's injustice to woman. If by
strength is meant brute strength then indeed,
is woman less brute than man. If by
strength is meant moral power, then woman
is immeasurably man's superior. Has she
not greater intuition, is she not more self-
sacrificing, has she not greater powers of
endurance, has she not greater courage?
Without her man could not be. If non¬
violence is the law of our being, the future
is with woman... Who can make a more
effective appeal to the heart than woman?
* I believe in the proper education of
women. But I do believe that woman will
not make her contribution to the world by
mimicking or running a race with men.
She can run the race, but she will not rise
to the great heights she is capable of by
mimicking man. She has to be the comple¬
ment of man.
I am not at all concerned with appearing
to be consistent. In my pursuit after Truth
I have discarded many ideas and learnt
many new things. Old as I am in age, I
have no feeling that I have ceased to grow
inwardly or that my growth will stop with
the dissolution of the flesh. What I am
concerned with is my readiness to obey the
call of Truth, my God, from moment to
moment.
Music means rhythm, order. Its effect
is electrical. It immediately soothes. Un¬
fortunately like our shastras, music has
been the prerogative of the few. It has
never become nationalized in the modern
sense. If I had any influence with volun¬
teer boy scouts and Seva Samiti organiza¬
tions, I would make compulsory a proper
singing in company of national songs.
And to that end I should have great musi¬
cians attending every congress or confe¬
rence and teaching mass music.
I love music and all the other arts, but
I do not attach such value to them as is
generally done. I cannot, for example,
recognize the value of those activities which
require technical knowledge for their
understanding... When I gaze at the star-
sown heaven, and the infinite beauty it
affords my eyes, that means to me more
than all human art can give me. That
does not mean that I ignore the value of
those works generally called artistic; but
personally, in comparison with the infinite
beauty of Nature, I feel their unreality too
intensely... Life is greater than all art. I
would even go further and declare that the
man whose life comes nearest to perfection
is the greatest artist; for what is art without
the sure foundation and framework of a
noble life?

Letters to the Editor
TRUE WORTH OF A CROWN
Sir,
In your issue "Science Versus Old
Age" (October 1958) we are told that
the old people of "De Garnies By" (The
Old Peoples' Town) in Copenhagen
receive 30 crowns a month as pocket
money. And further we are told that a
crown is about 1/- or 15 cents. It is
true that when you change one Danish
crown into American money it will be
worth about 15 cents, but it is just
because of the American dollar's
superiority to European money when
being spent in Europe. What you want
to know is how much the Danes can
buy for one crown in Denmark, and
how much the Americans can buy for
15 cents in U.S.A. When you have
made that out and compared the two
amounts of goods, you will see that a
crown is equal to about 40 cents, and
now you have a more true picture of
the old peoples' pocket money con¬
ditions.
Finally, my compliments to the
editors for one of the most valuable
periodicals which has ever existed.

U.N. COUNCIL OF YOUTH
Sir,
Why not have a Youth Council as a
permanent part of The United Nations?
With more young people taking an
active interest in world affairs, studying
longer, taking extra night courses,
helping to fight each nation's military
battles and generally being more active
in a nation's growth, why not give them
a say in their own affairs?
Mature youngsters could be chosen
to act as delegates on a U.N. Youth
Council. This council could discuss
all affairs that go before the adult
councils and the delegates could also be
ambassadors between the larger nations.
Youngsters are asked to die for their
nations but are not given any direct say
in world affairs. A U.N. Youth Council
would represent all nations in the
United Nations, even those still outside.
Delegates would be chosen from
universities, organizations and young
peoples groups in each country. Perhaps
the training they would receive would
even help them later as leaders in their
own lands, or as representatives in the
U.N. Assembly.
The Youth Council would be station¬
ed at U.N. Headquarters in New York.
Decisions would be by a majority.
There could be a permanent secretary
and assistant secretary and president
and vice-president, the latter two being
changed every two years. Perhaps
Youth Councils could be formed in each
area as a link with the larger Council.
Regional Councils could act as informa¬
tion centres and work in with schools
and educational bodies.
Perhaps scholarships could be given
by local councils for a young man or
woman to study at the United Nations.
He or she could spend a year at U.N.
observing, learning all about inter¬
national affairs and perhaps preparing
for a diplomatic or political career. . . I
feel a Youth Council could do a great
deal for world peace especially among
the people who will be tomorrow's
leaders.

TIRESOME READING
Sir,
I must say quite frankly that your
magazine makes boring reading. The
articles are too long and too crammed
with facts. Only with difficulty does
one find a general idea and food for
thought. The typography suffers from
an excess of uniformity. As a doctor
I have very little leisure time and the
articles you publish offer me neither
the relaxation nor the intellectual sti¬
mulus which I need.
Dr. Paul Noel
Chaville, France
DOUBLE DUTCH ?
Sir,
Because we appreciate and heartily
applaud the excellent work done by
Unesco, I was sorry to see a minor
inexactitude in one of the articles in the
July issue of The Unesco Courier
which I would like to point out. In
the article on Bilingualism, Sir Ben
Bowen Thomas names the Netherlands
as a bilingual country. This is very
definitely not so. We have many
dialects, of course, but only Dutch is
spoken. Or was he thinking of "Double
Dutch?"
Marian Gobius
Voorburg, Netherlands
A WEAK PUBLICATION
Sir,
I follow certain of Unesco's activities
very closely and I have bought and will
continue to buy some of its publications,
in particular those in its collection of
representative works. When one consi¬
ders the usefulness and the quality of
these publications and the very real need
which they fill, one is justified in using
a certain severity of judgement with
regard to your magazine. More often
than not The Unesco Courier is rather
weak, is influenced by a puerile need to
popularize, and seems, in part, to be the
work of bad journalists. As it is your
most widely distributed publication and
is offered at a "publicity" rate, it is
likely to prove harmful to your activities.

SAVING INDIGENOUS ART
Sir,
I read with great interest the article
by Lilo Linke, '"Art Revival for
Ecuador's Indians," in the N" 6, 1955
issue of The Unesco Courier (U.S. -
Sept. 1955). Did you know in Morocco,
a similar and, as far as I can judge, even
more ambitious effort to save indigenous
art has been made by M. Marcel Vi¬
caire, director of handicraft industries?
M. Vicaire, who has lived in Morocco
for 35 years, has undertaken the
restoration of several mosques and im¬
portant monuments and has set up pilot
workshops. These are in operation all
over Morocco, not only to develop
handicrafts, but to enable them to
follow traditional lines. As director of
Morocco's eight museums, M. Vicaire
periodically organizes exhibitions of
costumes, musical instruments, carpets,
textiles, decorated arms, ceramics,
leather work, jewellery, etc., of Berber
and Arabic origin. Much more could
be said of the admirable work carried
out under his direction.

SCENE FROM PARSIFAL
Sir,
Congratulations on your October
issue (Science vs. Old Age). . . I was
struck by the magnificent photo which
appeared with the article by Aldous
Huxley ("The Greatest Enemies to Li¬
berty"). I notice that the photo refers
to the Beyreuth Festival. Can you tell
me from which of Wagner's music-
dramas this is a scene ?
R. Stanford
London
Ed. not. : The picture in question is
a scene from Wagner's "Parsifal" as
presented in its modern staging at Bey¬
reuth. "Parsifal" was Wagner's last
work and is sometimes called his "Fare¬
well to the World". It occupies a
special place within Wagner's opus. In
it Wagner shows how he who finds the
way to renunciation rises above his own
sufferings, experiencing that of others,
and in compassionate understanding
delivers the world of sin and creates a
new life.
IN GERMAN
Sir,
I have come across your publication
through a friend. It interests me very
much and I should like to know if
there is any possibility of a German
version being printed. The numbers in
my possession are mainly in English,
but I notice that they also exist in
French, Spanish and recently Russian.
In my opinion there must be conside¬
rable interest in your publication in
German-speaking 'areas, but a sufficient
knowledge of one of the Unesco lan¬
guages which would enable the reader
to understand the highly qualified arti¬
cles is rare. I feel therefore that a
German edition would be well worth¬
while.

The Unesco Courier. December 1958
Dr. VITTORINO VERONESE (LEFT), CONFERING WITH Dr. L. EVANS DURING UNESCO'S RECENT GENERAL CONFERENCE.
Dr. VITTORINO VERONESE
NEW DIRECTOR-GENERAL OF UNESCO
The General Conference of Unesco at its 10th session
held in Paris in November has elected Dr. Vittorino
Veronese, of Italy, Director-General of the Organi¬
zation in succession to Dr. Luther H. Evans. He is
appointed for six years and. assumed office at the close of
the General Conference on December 5.
Dr. Veronese was elected by 55 votes for, 20 against,
with four abstentions. His election marks the first time
that the post of Director-General of one of the agencies
of the United Nations has been entrusted to a citizen of
Italy.
Born in Vicenza in 1910, Dr. Veronese brings to Unesco
a distinguished career as a leader in cultural affairs and
as an administrator and promoter of international co-op¬
eration, particularly in social and economic matters. Doctor
of Law, barrister and then professor at the Institute of
Social Sciences at the Athenaeum Angelicum in Rome,
Dr. Veronese became Secretary-General of the Catholic
Institute of Social Work in 1944 and later its president.
Before this period he was associated with a group of
democratically-minded university men and intellectuals
who had come together in a review entitled "Studium" of
which Dr. Veronese later became editor. It was this group
(which included men like De Gasperi, Gonella and Vanoni)
which in 1943 elaborated a manifesto of social action
(Codice di Camaldoli) inspired by the principles of demo¬
cracy. At this time he became the Central Secretary of
the "Catholic Movement of University Graduates" which
rallied university circles to the cause of freedom and human
dignity.
Since 1944 he has held a number of high posts in his
country, including those of President of the Italian "Catho¬
lic Action", member of the Governing Board of the
Foundation "Premi Roma" for youth, President of the
Association of Refugee Intellectuals in Italy, President of
the Italian Central Institute of Credit, President of the
"Consorzio di Crédito per le Opere Pubbliche" and member
of the Executive Committee of the Italian African Institute.
His association with Unesco dates from 1948, when Italy
became a member of the Organization. Since that time he
has attended all Unesco General Conferences as a member
of the Italian delegation. As a member of the Social
Sciences Committee of the Italian National Commission
for Unesco he has promoted many Unesco activities in
Italy. In 1952 he became a member of the Unesco Execu¬
tive Board of which he was elected Chairman in 1957.
As a member of the Executive Board he initiated a series
of discussions and meetings which led to profound changes
in Unesco's programme, including the introduction of the
"Major Projects" to which Unesco is now devoting a large
part of its resources.

^LUBS FOR HOMEWORK:
"Lernclubs", or clubs for the prepa¬
ration of lessons, are now operating
for the benefit of schoolchildren in
Vienna and other Austrian cities.
The clubs are open during the after¬
noons to children whose parents
are employed away from home, and
they enable these children to do their
homework under the supervision of a
teacher. The teacher does not help
the children directly, but shows them
how to find for themselves the solu¬
tion of their problems and teaches
them to work independently.
FLIGHTS OF MERCY: Aircraft
of Australia's Royal Flying Doctor
Service flew nearly half a million
miles last year and its doctors
treated some 13,000 patients.
Another 11,000 sick people had
their complaints diagnosed by
flying doctors over the service's
two-way radio network. The
Flying Doctor Service has become
an essential part of Australia's
national life, and has given people
living in remote regions a much
greater sense of security.
ILAZARDS OF CHILDHOOD:
Accidents Mil more European chil¬
dren over one year of age than does
tuberculosis, poliomyelitis, cancer or
any other disease reports the World
Health Organization. Statistics
show that in the Netherlands, Swe¬
den and Switzerland, for example,
one death in three among children
aged one to four is caused by an
accident. Different risks apply to
different countries. While drowning
is particularly frequent in Scandina
via, the Netherlands and France,
Injury or death from burns caused by
braziers or open fires is a greater
danger in Britain and Spain. Experts
stress that children must not be
overprotected, but should be taught
to cope with dangerous situations.
ESPERANTO IN THE U.N.: A
course of Esperanto was started
recently at the U.N. Headquarters
in New York. Some 40 persons
are attending the two parallel
classes, thus showing a new inte¬
rest for the international language
among staff members. The U.N.
Library has acquired the "lingua-

meet any requests from the staff
regarding the language and at the
end of the course it is the inten¬

SCIENTIST WA RNS OF
X-RAY DANGERS
A WARNING of the atomic radiation danger in the over-use of X-ray
examination was given by Professor Zenon M. Bacq, of Liège University,
at the 4th General Assembly of the Council for International Organizations
of Medical Sciences, meeting at Unesco House in Paris.
Prof. Bacq pointed out the need to draw the attention of physicians to the
necessity of diminishing the quantities of radiation administered during X-ray
diagnosis. He declared that specialists believed it would be possible to lower the
dose distributed to the population by at least a quarter of its present level if all
those who conduct X-ray examinations were well-trained and equipped with
appropriate apparatus, and if physicians did not ask X-ray specialists to conduct
useless or relatively useless examinations. This could be obtained without doing
the slightest harm to the precious contribution of X-ray examinations to the
diagnosis of illness.
Prof. Bacq, who was speaking as an observer from the International Council
of Scientific Unions!, suggested that the Council for International Organizations
of Medical Sciences should call a symposium which would bring together radio¬
logists, surgeons, physicians, gynecologists, dentists and other specialists.
Delegates to the congress pointed out the need to protect doctors, as well as
patients, from radiation. While X-ray specialists are familiar with their apparatus
and take proper precautions, they stated, many surgeons run unnecessary risks.
introduction of uniform proce¬
dures, amendment of regulations
which may delay or restrict inter^
national air traffic, and the
reduction of ground delays to the
minimum. During its 13 years
existence, ICAO has done much
towards cutting down the red tape
involved in border crossings by air.
The problem has become even
more vital as aircraft speeds have
increased, making it necessary to
cut down the time spent in
customs, immigration and other
formalities.
AitFRICA'S GROWING OUTPUT:
Agricultural production in Africa
south of the Sahara showed an
average annual increase of- about
3 per cent since 1948-52, a rate which
exceeded all other major regions of
the world except the Near East. This
was reported in "The State of Food
and Agriculture 1958" published by
the Food and Agriculture Organiza¬
tion. Fishery production in Africa
increased nearly four times in 20
years, but the increase in forest pro¬
ducts Was less, since two-thirds of the
forests Were still inaccessible. Popu¬
lation figures rose by one-third in the
same period, yet this represented
only five per cent of world population
on a total land surface of 15 percent
of the earth. Agricultural produc¬
tion here is capable of great expan¬
sion since the area contains about
15 percent of the world's total agri¬
cultural land. Today the production
is only four percent of the world's
total.
TIME OUT FROM SCHOOL:
The length of school holidays
varies according to the different
countries and often within the
same country. In the German
Federal Republic, holidays average
75 days a year; in Austria 85 days;
in England and Wales 94 days; in
Canada 102 days; in France 110
days; in the United States 116
days; in Ireland 130 days and in
Italy 150 days per year.
UrUNESCO'S LATEST MEMBER:
Albania recently became the 81st
Member State of Unesco when the
Albanian representative in London
signed the Organization's Constitu¬
tion which is deposited at the
Foreign Office.
MULTI-LINGUAL STATE: The
number of national languages in
which instruction is given in the
U.S.S.R. is now sixty. In the
Russian Soviet Federated Socialist
Republic alone, forty-four lan¬
guages corresponding to forty-fóur
different nationalities are used.
The Russian language is used in
all schools of the Soviet Union as
from the third year.
