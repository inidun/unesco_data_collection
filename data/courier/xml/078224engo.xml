Spirit figure mask (Gabon)
An African funerary mask from the Ogowe River area of Gabon. With its refined fea¬
tures, curved half-closed eyelids and an elaborately carved black coiffure standing
out boldly above the white painted face, the mask strikingly recalls certain Asian
works of art. But the talented artists who produced masks of this kind lived in
the very heart of Africa and had no possibility of contacts with the Far East. For kins¬
folk, the spirit figure masks represent the restitution of a dead person to their midst.

With all the technological changes
that have taken place since
these armillary spheres were
first invented by Archimedes,
man today must bear the weight
of many worlds. Yet the
demographers contend that the
great problem confronting us
is not how man can shoulder
many worlds, but rather how
our one world can support as
many men as there are likely
to be in the years ahead.

Three centuries of demography
JOHN GRAUNT'S
OFFSPRING
by Boris Urlanis
A
nniversaries of prominent
scientists are usually fairly easy to
establish, but the birthday of a branch
of science is often hidden in the
depths of time. Demography is a
fortunate exception, for its birthday
has been established beyond all
reasonable doubt January 1662, when
John Graunt, a London businessman,
published his Natural and Political
Observations Made Upon the Bills of
Mortality. This book was the world's
first piece of research in the field now
known as demography.
Five years ago demographers cele¬
brated the tercentenary of their trade;
be it said to the honour of Soviet
scholars that they set the ball rolling
by reading a paper on the subject at
the 33rd Session of the International
Statistical Institute in Paris in the
summer of 1961.
The writer Stefan Zweig once used
the term "the astral hours of man-
to describe moments of great human
spiritual uplift, when the genius in
man is being awaked. Out of millions
of human beings only one genius is
born, he wrote, only one provides
mankind with a truly historic astral
hour.
Such an astral hour struck when
John Graunt the successful business¬
man in London, sitting before a warm
fire scanning the weekly Bills of Mor¬
tality in London, conceived the brilliant
idea of subjecting these Bills, with
their mass of figures, to a scientific
4
BORIS URLANIS is one of the Soviet
Union's leading demographers and statistic¬
ians. Professor of demography at the Ins¬
titute of Economics, U.S.S.R. Academy of
Sciences, he has written many books and
studies, and In particular on the theory of
statistics and on war and the population
of Europe.
analysis. His book was the outcome
of this fireside contemplation. In this
way the bright ideas of John Graunt
led to the birth of demography in
London.
Graunt had many followers, promi¬
nent among them William Petty, a
close friend, who took demography a
step forward by a number of interest¬
ing calculations and the conclusions
drawn from them. He calculated, for
instance, that 3,000 people had died
in the biggest Paris hospital solely
because the hospital was badly
organized. It is true that some of his
assumptions later proved to be un¬
founded; for example, he computed
that the population of London would
continue growing only until 1800, whe¬
reas it actually increased eightfold bet¬
ween 1800 and 1950.
Following in the footsteps of Graunt
and Petty, the English astronomer
Edmund Halley made a big contribu¬
tion to the new science. He used
data from the city of Breslau (now
Wroclaw) to compile the first mortal¬
ity table which was published in 1693
by the Royal Society (the oldest scien¬
tific society in Great Britain, founded
in 1660).
In the 18th century demography
made its way to the European conti¬
nent, where many of the best minds
had begun to take an interest in popu¬
lation problems. The German pastor
J. P. Siissmilch made a further impor¬
tant contribution in 1742 with his book
Die göttliche Ordnung in den Ver¬
änderungen des menschlichen Ge¬
schlechts. (The Divine Ordinance
manifested in the Human Race through
Birth, Death and Propagation.) A
wealth of demographic data was
gathered for this book from which
some significant conclusions were
drawn.
It was about this time that demo¬
graphy was first taken up in Russia.
Mikhail Lomonosov, a Russian scholar
of exceptional versatility physicist,
chemist, poet, geographer, economist,
statistician... and demographer was
the first Russian scientist to raise the
question of demography. He did so
on the grand scale, outlining his ideas
on the subject in a letter written on
November 1, 1761 to his friend Count
Shuvalov, a favourite of the Empress
Elizabeth.
The letter was a remarkable treatise
on population policy. Lomonosov
referred to "the preservation and in¬
crease of the people". He spoke of
the various factors hindering the
growth of the population and suggest¬
ed ways and means of overcoming
them. He called attention to the differ¬
ences in the ages of husbands and
wives, to the very high level of infant
mortality, to the effect of alcoholism on
the death rate, etc. He also spoke of
emigration and called Russians who
left their native land "living corpses".
Shortly after this, Count Shuvalov
lost favour at court and so Lomono-
sov's letter (which was addressed to
the Count) had no immediate results.
But it is important to know that in
Russia the question of a rational demo¬
graphic policy was raised just over 200
years ago.
At the end of the 18th century, a
slim work written by an anonymous
author and entitled "An Essay on the
Principle of Population" was published
in England. It put forward the view
that the poverty of the mass of the
population was due simply to the
sexual instinct of reproduction and
was not a consequence of the econo¬
mic and political systems of that time.
The author of this work was an English
clergyman, Thomas Robert Malthus.

JOHN GRAUNT'S OFFSPRING (Continued)
"A maximum increase in population
is not a blessing among all peoples'
In the 19th century the development
of demography continued, although it
was not baptised until 1855 when the
French scholar Achille Guillard used
the word démographie in the title of
his book Eléments de statistique
humaine ou démographie comparée.
As a scientific term, therefore, "demo¬
graphy"" is little more than 100 years
old.
In the 20th century demography
began to attract greater attention:
institutes of demography were found¬
ed, special journals appeared, congres¬
ses were convened and demography
was added to many university sylla¬
buses.
In the U.S.S.R. and other socialist
countries demography has been very
widely developed as a prerequisite of
economic and social planning and the
general improvement of living stand¬
ards. Take housing for instance.
About ten million Soviet people move
into new apartments every year, and
architects want demographers to tell
them what the future size of families
will be so as to build apartments
of the appropriate size. Those who
plan sports grounds and stadiums,
hospitals, theatres and other public
buildings want demographers to esti¬
mate the composition of the commu¬
nity by age groups.
P

LANNING bodies in gene¬
ral have to know what sex and age
groups will make up the population at
any future date. To plan nurseries,
kindergartens, day and boarding
schools it is essential to know how
large each group of children is likely
to be in future years, which means that
the probable percentage of births for
each age group of women has to be
computed as accurately as possible.
The bodies that plan retail trade
also need population forecasts. They
need to know the number of children so
as to plan the output of toys, or the
number of those reaching manhood so
as to plan the output of razor
blades and electric shavers. The cloth¬
ing and footwear trades know that a
young man of 18 requires suits, shirts
and shoes of certain sizes; but this is
not enough they must know how
many young men will be needing these
articles next year and the year after.
The sex-and-age analysis of the
population is of even greater impor¬
tance in the sphere of employment.
Young people of the rising generation
should have the chance to make the
best use of their skills and energy.
In this respect it is important to ration¬
alise population movement so that
young people may know in which part
of the country they are most needed.
Lenin once said that science is one
of the ways of serving the people.
This is probably truer of demography
than of any of the kindred sciences.
The people themselves are the very
subject of demography. In our age,
the age of democratic development,
demography thus acquires particular
significance.
The authors of an article on history
in the Encyclopedia of Social Scien¬
ces (1) shrewdly remark that genealogy
" ...has seen itself gradually replaced
by demography, a newcomer, which
seems to have delayed its entrance
into the world of history until the king
of former times was replaced by
demos, the sovereign of today, the
modern object of the study of histo¬
rians."
Analysis of demographic data may
have results that influence the health
of the population; it may improve,
prolong and enrich the lives of millions.
It is this sort of active demography
that must replace passive contempla¬
tion, the mere recording of facts, with¬
out drawing conclusions, making
recommendations or explaining causes.
To paraphrase Marx, one might say
that until now demographers have
described reality, whereas the impor¬
tant thing is to change it. Demography
should not replace the natural scien¬
ces, but should work with them to
help fulfil man's ancient dream the
abolition of premature death and the
assurance of a long, happy and active
life.
How can demographers help to
increase man's life span?
In countries with developed statistic¬
al services every death finds its way
into statistics. Every death is register¬
ed, a form is filled in and the facts
are then summarised and become part
of the statistics of mortality. These
statistics are a vital source of infor¬
mation on all questions connected
with life expectancy.
0 NE anatomical theatre
bears the inscription: "Here the dead
teach the living". Something similar
may be said of mortality statistics the
dead teach their descendants, in the
mortality statistics the dead again
acquire a voice. This explains why
many scholars have long been study¬
ing mortality figures.
About a hundred years ago the Bel¬
gian statistician, Lambert Adolphe
Quetelet, said that we know less about
birth statistics than about mortality
figures, because man is obviously less
interested in how he entered life than
in how he may leave it. For him the
laws of birth have only a relative
interest compared to the crucial ques¬
tion of his chances of life and
death (2).
Mortality statistics are tremendous¬
ly instructive. We learn little from the
individual death that can help us in the
battle for longevity. The death of each
individual organism has its own specific
causes. But side by side with these,
other causes related to general condi¬
tions of human life are also operat¬
ing.
In each case death results from
joint action by general and individual
causes. It is thus impossible to
distinguish the effect of the general
causes in each death, but this becomes
possible when information is available
on a large number of cases taken
from statistics covering the population
as a whole. When observations are
made on a mass scale, everything inci¬
dental due to partial causes is remov¬
ed or neutralised, or is mutually
compensated; then a law emerges to
reveal the operation of common
causes and conditions.
A NOTHER big task for
demographers is the study of the birth
rate. In the Soviet Union, the radical
changes that have taken place in the
social position of women, their partici¬
pation in production side by side with
men, have reduced the size of families.
The Central Asian peoples, the Ar¬
menians and the Azerbaijanians still
keep up the tradition of big families,
but since these peoples represent only
ten per cent of the population of the
U.S.S.R. they do not greatly effect the
overall national figure.
Family planning of the number of
births is causing a steady reduction
' in the birth rate. Ten years ago the

We completely disagree with Quetelet's
attitude to birth records. They are not
merely interesting, as Quetelet believed;
they provide us with a picture of the future
of peoples and nations. (Author.)

coefficient for the whole Soviet Union
was 26.6 per cent but by 1965 it had
fallen by more than a quarter to 18.5
per cent. This reduction in the birth
rate is largely due to the war of 1941-
45; in those years there was a sharp
drop in the birth rate, and twenty
years later, when girls born in the war
years began to marry, the annual mar¬
riage rate dropped from 12.1 per 1000
(1960) to 8.5 per 1000 (1964).
The reduction in what demographers
call the fertility rate does not seem
to affect women up to 25 years of
age, since most young married women
want to have at least one child. In
the next age group, 25-29 years, there
has been a regular reduction in fertility
more than 10 per cent in the last six
years. The decrease is even more
marked among older women so that the
percentage of young mothers has
increased in recent years.
Although the birth rate has dropped,
in the U.S.S.R. it is still high enough
to ensure an increase in the popula¬
tion with each generation.
Today a scholar cannot confine his
studies to his own country. The demo¬
grapher is interested in world popula¬
tion problems, especially the problems
of the developing countries. A maxi¬
mum Increase in the population cannot
be regarded as a blessing in all coun¬
tries and among all peoples. In some
developing countries the labour force
is not fully employed, and this only
serves to retard their economic
growth.
Many of these countries possess
large areas of unused land, and their
crops have small yields, but larger
investments than these countries can
afford are required to increase the per-
acre yields or to extend the area under
crops. Thus, statements made by some
scholars to the effect that our planet
can feed a population thousands
of times greater than at present
(13,000,000 million has been mention¬
ed) are merely abstract speculation. It
is unfortunate that such fantastic
statements are printed and publicised.
In European and North American
countries the lowering of the mortality
rate has been accompanied by a lower¬
ing of the birth rate. It seems clear
that in a number of developing coun¬
tries, too, the problem of reducing the
birth rate must take its place along¬
side industrialization, social reform
and cultural growth if a sound basis
for economic progress is to be
assured.
In some of these countries the birth
rate will be reduced to a certain
extent as a result of women's participa¬
tion in production, a higher level of
culture and the development of indus¬
try. In certain countries, however, a
demographic policy specifically aimed
at smaller families may be of great
significance. The example of Japan,
where the birth rate has been halved,
is particularly instructive.
Recognition of the advisability of
reducing the birth rate in a number of
countries has nothing in common with
malthusianism. Malthus's theory of the
two progressions has not withstood
the test of time his assertion that the
output of food increases in arithmet¬
ical progression has no foundation in
fact. Equally untrue is his assertion
that population, increases follow bio¬
logical laws. Actually the determining
laws are socio-economic laws, since,
in the final analysis, the cultural level
and the implementation of certain
social measures determine the rate of
population growth.
The spread of the idea of family
planning makes for a richer spiritual
life for women and at the same time
helps to keep population growth at an
optimum level. In other words, each
country must search for conditions
that are most expedient from the point
of view both of the economy and of
population growth rates. It is for de¬
mographers to ensure that the most
rational rates of population growth are
maintained.
The demographer's task is not one **

happiness" of the people.

I T seems impossible to
foresee man's future. However, we do
know that the past determines our pre¬
sent in many realms: language, concept
of the world, religion, science, law.
Moreover, certain biological and phy¬
siological conditions appear to be so
characteristic of the human race that
if they were absent we would no longer
really speak of man as such.
Thus the present largely determines
the future and today, unwittingly, we
are determining for centuries to come
the modes of life of our progeny.
The average expectation of life in
the past (that is, of our ancestors up
to about the year 1800) did not corres¬
pond to man's biological life span. The
systematic analysis of many church
registers of the past is providing us
JEAN FOURASTIE, sociologist and econ¬
omist, is a professor at the Institut d'étu¬
des politiques of the University of Paris
who has written a number of studies of
demographic questions. His publications
include 'La 'civilisation de 1975" (new
edition, PUF 1964, Paris); 'La grande
métamorphose du XX' siècle' (PUF 1962,
Paris); 'Les 40 000 heures" (Laffont 1965,
Paris); and in English "Productivity, Prices
and Wages" (OEEC 1957, Paris) and 'The
Causes of Wealth' (Free Press 1960,
Glencoe, Illinois). The present article is

Mankind" In No. 32 of Diogenes, a quar¬

Humanistic Studies with Unesco assistance.
with a picture of the life span of our
forefathers.
From these studies it would appear
that the average expectation of life, or
the average life at birth, was of the
order of 25 years in France at the end
of the 17th century and the beginning
of the 18th. For certain generations
who lived in ancient Europe during
periods of great distress and misery,
this figure dropped to about 20 years.
It is these figures 20 years, 25
years which' give full significance to
the presently foreseeable figure: 80
years.
In the past, out of one thousand chil¬
dren born alive, an average of about
430 or 440 reached the age of marria¬
ge; tomorrow the figure will be 985.

were 27 for men and 25 for women;
today they are 26 and 24. Today, as
in the past, one marries for life, but in
those days married life lasted 17 years
on the average; only one household
in two reached its 15th wedding anni¬
versary. Tomorrow married life will'
last 46 to 48 years.
In traditional society it was at 14, if
he lived to that age, that the average
child saw the first of his parents die;
tomorrow it will be at the age of 55.
This is of course gratifying, but it must
be pointed out that more than half the
personal wealth of a nation will then
belong to men and women over 75
years old.
Formerly, parents often died before
their children completed their educa¬
tion; tomorrow, assuming the age of
marriage to be what it is today, a
normal couple will live for 20 to 25
years after the marriage of their youn¬
gest child.
At the end of the 17th century in
France, but probably In the rest of
the world as well, the life of the ave¬
rage father of a family who had married
for the first time at the age of 27,
could be summarized as follows: born
into a family of five children, he saw
only half that number reach the age
of 15; like his father, he too had five
children, of whom only two or three
were alive at the time of his death (1).
This man, living on an average to the
age of 52 an age which placed him
in the venerable ranks of the elders
saw an average of nine persons of his
immediate family (not including uncles,
nephews and first cousins) die. Among
the nine was one grandparent (the
other three having died before his
birth), his two parents, and three of his
children.
He had lived through two or three

famines plus three or four periods of
high grain prices caused by poor har¬
vests which occurred in approximately
ten-year cycles. He had seen various
members of his family fall ill his bro¬
thers, his children, his wife, and his
parents; he had known two or three
epidemics of infectious diseases, not
to mention the semi-permanent epide¬
mics of whooping cough, scarlet fever,
and diphteria.
In former- times death was in the
midst of life just as the cemetery was
in the middle of a village. Since then,
death, poverty and disease have been
retreating. They are no longer consi¬
dered man's relentless companions,
driving him toward a spiritual life and
moral progress, but as accidents or a
sort of amputation, an unfortunate mis¬
chance which runs counter to man's
true nature, and which must not only
be opposed but checked and brought
under control.

Christ humanity still numbered less
than 10 million; 100 million at the birth
of Jesus; and 2,400 million in 1950;
there will be 7,000 million in the year
2000, according to estimates of the
United Nations.
I do not wish to discuss the level
of stabilization which humanity will
eventually reach, or even if there will
be an effective stabilization level,
although this seems to demand an
affirmative answer. I should like here
to consider the types of humanity
which would result from different
levels of population.
Let us consider two extreme hypo¬
theses regarding conditions of habita-
bility of our planet. In the first man
modifies neither the physical geogra¬
phy of the world nor the climates (Hy¬
pothesis A). In the second hypothesis
man manages to fill in a portion
oí the seas by tipping the mountains
into theiß. so that all terra firma would
become habitable (Hypothesis B).
With Hypothesis A there would be
scarcely seven thousand million hec¬
tares in which one might live without
feeling like a political deportee or a
scientific guinea pig; with Hypothe¬
sis B there would be 15 thousand mil¬
lion hectares.
Now let us refer to Table 1, which
lists a few figures familiar to all geo¬
graphers.
It is simple to calculate the world
populations that would result from the
extension on a world scale of the va¬
rious densities mentioned in this table.
I would merely note that each of the
seven thousand million hectares of
Hypothesis A was already in 1960
more heavily populated on the average
than was each of the 35 million hec¬
tares in France under Louis XV in the
18th century. It may also be noted
that in the year 2000 these same seven
thousand million hectares will have a
slightly higher population density than
that of present-day France (0.9 inhabi¬
tants per hectare as against 0.8).

Ai S for the density which the
city of New York supports at the pre¬
sent time, it would permit the sustaining
of life for 700 thousand million persons
under Hypothesis A and 1 billion
500,000 million (1,500,000,000,000) un¬
der Hypothesis B. If we assume the
rate of increase for the years 1950-60
(the world's population doubling every
40 years) these figures would be rea¬
ched by the year 2200 with Hypothe¬
sis A and by 2310 with Hypothe¬
sis B (3).
In comparison one may recall that
the total population of the world in
(2) The densities of these countries are
calculated here on the basis of total geo¬
graphic area. Obviously much of these
lands is effectively cultivable and habitable
only in a hypothesis similar to Hypothesis B.
(3) It can be seen that Hypotheses A and
B, which are so different from each other
from the technical and geographical point
of view, differ very little from the demo¬
graphic standpoint.
1935 could have been contained in a
single town having the density of Paris
and a diameter of the distance between
Chartres and Rheims (about 250 kms
or 150 miles).
I do not believe that it was out of
place when I used the term "types of
humanity" to designate the populations
which have existed in the past, which
exist today and will exist tomorrow as
a result of these different densities.
Indeed, these density figures are so
widely different that they imply radi¬
cally different ways of life, each in turn
resulting in a different intellectual and
physical environment.
I T takes no great stretch of
the imagination to realize that between
the man living in a natural environment
such as that of France in 1750 and the
man of the future inhabiting an endless
town of the density of New York
stretching over thousands of kilome¬
tres, there are many points in common
with animals living in the open forest as
compared to those confined in a zoo.
The least one can say is that the
problem deserves to be studied and
that we have little time (300 years is
nothing to meet a biological problem)
in which to solve it.
Table 2 shows how sensitive, relati¬
vely speaking, the world will become
to moderate or even slight rates of
population increases, and how difficult
it will be to check the process once
a certain threshold has been crossed.
It is well established in the realm of
geometric progression that beyond a
certain threshold absolute numbers be¬
come so enormous that even a radical
or drastic reduction in the coefficient
of growth can no longer stop the run¬
away increase in absolute numbers.
From the time of Pericles to the year
2000 the global population will have
been multiplied by about 100 (in
25 hundred years), but an equivalent
increase (that is to say, a new multi¬
plication by 100) would lead to ave¬
rage densities of 100 persons to the
hectare. These same figures show the
small value of the cosmic type solu¬
tions (passage from Hypothesis A to
Hypothesis B as described above, or
populating the Moon or neighbouring
planets.)
These solutions which require vast
technical feats would provide only very
slight easing of the situation once the
number of human beings had reached
about a hundred thousand million (the

The most striking fact is the oppo¬

by the raising of his average life expec¬
tancy to 80 years. The increase noted
which demographers call the "natural

one must assume that the sexual beha¬

differ in the future from natural beha¬
viour. Table 2 shows that, even with
the birth rate greatly reduced, the long-
term increases remain large, that even

from Pericles' day to our own has
been achieved with natural fertility (an
average of about 4.1 or 4.2 children
per average marriage, corresponding
to about six children per complete
family) (4).
B UT in the future almost all
families will be complete families.
Furthermore, advances in medicine are
reducing and will reduce the incidence
of congenital sterility. Natural fertility
would then produce at least six children
per average family, that is, a reproduc¬
tion rate of 1.65, assuming that the
present death rate is maintained and
that the celibacy rate of about 10 per
cent remains constant. This would
double the number of the potential
parents in 20 years, which would lead
humanity into a growth twice as rapid
as the present, and from today's total
of three thousand million the population
would reach 700 thousand million in a
century and a half.
I say this only to show what would
occur in the near future with the conti¬
nuation of the immemorial birth rate,
(4) A complete family is a family In which
both parents are living at least until the
mother reaches the age of 50.
family, the population of the world
would double in 65 years.
However, the main purpose of table
2 is to show that the demographic prob¬
lem will become one of the great prob¬
lems of the near future of mankind.
It may be conceded that it will become
acute when densities are reached of
the order of ten inhabitants to the
hectare (70 thousand million people);
yet even with the rate of growth of
"highly developed countries," such as
the United States, this acute point
would be reached at a time when the
great-grandson of my grandson would
normally be alive.
IT will be seen from table 2
that contrary to general opinion, little
difference, as far as the crucial point
and the date it is reached are concern¬
ed, exists between the birth rates of the
United States and of the whole of the
rest of the world today (a mere 30 years
delay to reach a density of ten per
hectare and 50 years for a density of
100).
Even between the rates of mainland
China and America the delay in reach¬
ing density ten is only 45 yearsl Only
a much slower birth rate, such as exists
in France today, substantially post¬
pones the time when the crucial point
is reached though it is still astonishing¬
ly close at hand when viewed on the
time-scale of life on earth.
Of course what previous genera¬
tions have done future generations can
undo. By limiting the number of chil¬
dren per household to one the human
race would be reduced, after the death
of the parents, proportionately from
ten to four and a half. Perhaps our
descendants will have recourse to suc¬
cessive pulsations of growth and con¬
traction of this kind, each phase stimu¬
lating the contrary reflex.
But even if the austere one child per
family rationing were to be instituted
it would take four generations to go
from density ten to density one-half,
which was that of France in 1750;
economic and social conditions would
seem to render impossible or at least
extremely perilous such drastic defla¬
tions, or even much more gradual ones.
Table 2, then, seeks to show the
types of humanity which would exist in
the near future if the marriage and fer¬
tility rates observed at present in cer¬
tain regions were generalized through¬
out the world. If we assume that
one day it is generally agreed to stabi¬
lize the world's population at a certain
level and by a specific date, even then
mankind's population worries will not
be over.
T HE world has had no real
experience of a stabilized population
with a long life expectancy. The little
we do know gives cause for alarm.
We know, for example, that a stagnant
population curve has characteristic
economic, social and moral effects
which can be extremely serious.
In such a population the pyramid of
age distributions would become almost
a rectangle. There would be almost as
many persons aged 60 to 80 as there
were children and adolescents under
20 years.
More particularly, the decisions that
limited number of the population to a
fixed figure would have to be delibe¬
rate, whereas traditional humanity
never knew any but unconscious me¬
chanisms in this area.
As our ancestors knew, it was food
which limited the population by the
pitiless rigour of famine. The very
slow advance in agricultural techniques
thus had as a corollary a very slow
increase in the total population. In the
18th century two hectares of average
land in a temperate climate were still 1 0
needed to feed one man. Forty million * **
arable hectares in France fed 20 million
Frenchmen.

volcanoes, landslides...
One night in February 1943, a volcano suddenly sprouted
from the middle of a Mexican cornfield. Within six
months It had built up a huge cone and spewed forth a sea
of lava which engulfed the nearby village of San Juan
until only Its church tower emerged (shown in photo with
Parlcutin, as volcano was nam>ed, In background).
Eighteen months later, an eruption destroyed the nearby
town of Parangarlcutire. By March 1952, Parlcutin,
now 400 metres (1,300 feet) high was extinct, Its
eruptions ceasing as suddenly as they had begun.

OPERATION ANTI-DISASTER
by Edward D. Mills
T
HROUGHOUT the ages
man has battled against the forces of
nature, and one of the battle fronts
has been the field of natural disasters:
earthquakes, volcanoes, floods and
storms.
History and legend record these
events, from the Flood described in the
Book of Genesis and the eruption of
Vesuvius which finally destroyed Pom¬
peii in the year A.D. 79 to the 1963
earthquake in Skopje and the report
from Pekin, on March 11, 1966, of a
severe earthquake in the Hopei pro¬
vince of Northern China.
Because of the unforeseen character
of natural disasters they have frequent¬
ly been classed as "acts of God," but
scientists are beginning to find ways of
at least forecasting certain natural
phenomena, even if as yet no means
are available for preventing them.
The urgent need is to mobilize our
scientific and technical skills on a
properly organized international basis,
so that the devastation that follows in
the wake of these catastrophes can be
minimized and the appalling loss of
human life and property prevented or,
at least, reduced.
For convenience, natural disasters
may be classed in three main cate¬
gories:
earthquakes, volcanic eruptions
and landslides;
hurricanes, cyclones and
typhoons;
floods resulting from storms, tidal
waves, etc.
But the natural forces present at
any given disaster area may well
EDWARD D. MILLS is a member of the
Council of the Royal Institute of British
Architects. He is responsible for the
design of a number of important buildings
in many parts of the world. He is the
author of several books on architecture
and is especially Interested in the problems
of school architecture. He has been
concerned with international relief work
for 30 years past.
include elements from all three.
Earthquakes may cause landslides and
tidal waves (tsunamis) and hurricanes
may spread damage not only by wind
but also by flooding due to torrential
rains.
One of the most extensive natural
disasters of modern times was the
earthquake in Japan which in five
minutes destroyed Tokyo and Yoko¬
hama in 1923; in this instance the
resultant fires were aggravated by a
typhoon. The total of persons killed
and injured was at least a quarter of
a million while the damage to property
was estimated at £900 million.
E ARTHQUAKE activity and
active volcanoes indicate that the
earth's crust is still unstable in certain
areas. Earthquakes are sudden adjust¬
ments of parts of the crust in response
to pressures generated during moun¬
tain-building and volcanic activity.. Pre-
sentday earthquake and volcanic belts
follow the more recent belts of
mountain-building, the Andes, Rockies,
Himalayas and Alps.
The most severe recent earthquakes
have been in Morocco and Chile (1960),
Iran (1962), Libya and Yugoslavia
(1963), Alaska and Japan (1964). The
total loss of life in these exceeded
25,000 and damage has been estimated
at over £500 million.
There appear to be two main
hurricane belts in the world. The first
is along the West Indies which lie near
the Tropic of Cancer in the Caribbean
Sea. The hurricane path usually
follows the curve of the islands and
runs from Trinidad and Tobago, past
the Lesser Antilles and then through to
Haiti and Cuba. An example of this
was the hurricane Flora in 1963 which
devastated nearly everything in its
path, killing thousands of people and
destroying the homes of tens of
thousands.

Landslides
in the Tavelas' of Rio
In. January and March 1966, torrential rain on Rio de Janeiro
(left) set off disastrous landslides, especially in the "favelas",
or shanty towns, which cling precariously to Rio's steep hillsides
(right and below, centre of photo). Over 250 people were killed
and 4,250 homes damaged or destroyed. A Unesco mission
has been in Rio studying the causes of the disaster. One of its
members, Mr F.A. Soeiro, a consultant engineer, reports that
the gravity of the destruction was due not only to rain and
the tropical climate, but also to several other factors: the topo¬
graphy and geology of the area, the local hydrographical system
and the rainwater drainage network, problems of accelerating
urban development, the destruction of protective vegetation. Rio's
town-planning problems are typical of many other tropical cities
in Latin America, Africa and Asia. The search for long term
solutions is thus of value to many countries and calls for
the mobilization of large-scale resources for International studies.

OPERATION ANTI-DISASTER (Continued)
Emergency technical aid service
Jamaica and the Dominican Republic
were not in the path of the hurricane
itself, but suffered considerable loss of
life through heavy flooding. Many
villages remained isolated as a result
of the floods and the destruction of
roads and bridges. Hurricane Flora
lasted from September 30 to October 9,
1963 and finally blew itself out over the
North Atlantic.
Between 1959 and 1963 there were
three major hurricanes in this area: in
1960, from the Caribbean to New
England; in 1961, British Honduras
(which forms a semi-circle with the
Antilles); in 1963, Trinidad and Tobago,
Dominican Republic, Haiti, Jamaica and
Cuba.
The second tropical storm belt
covers the Far East, both north and
south of the equator, along the shores
of the Pacific Ocean. Eight major
typhoons have been recorded in recent
years. Cyclone disasters also occured
in 1960 in East Pakistan, which was hit
twice in October 1961 by another, and
yet again in May 1963. Each time the
cyclone attacked the same area
Chittagong. Over 14,000 people were
killed and 85 per cent of all houses
were totally or partially demolished.
In September 1963 Hong Kong and
Formosa were both struck by typhoons
and thousands of houses were
destroyed.
V
20
OLCANIC eruptions occu¬
red in 1963 in Costa Rica and Indone¬
sia where 1,700 people were killed and
400,000 left destitute. Up to then the
most recent major volcanic eruption
was the one that shook Tristan da
Cunha in the South. Atlantic, in 1961,
when the islanders were all evacuated
and sent to the United Kingdom. Most
of them returned to the island later.
Major dam and flood disasters appear
to have occurred mainly in Europe, the
Middle East and South America in
recent years. There have been seven
major dam disasters, some due to land
subsidence, a few caused by faulty
construction.
The heavy toll of life and property
caused by natural disasters underlines
the need for co-ordinated international
emergency action, for it is unfortunate¬
ly a fact that these catastrophes often
overwhelm countries least able to cope
with them.
While the picture of world devas¬
tation is appalling, the remarkable work
of official and voluntary relief organi
zations at times of natural disaster is
something of which we may be justly
proud. United Nations agencies such as
Unesco, Unicef, FAO, WHO, together
with the International Red Cross and
many other bodies, have contributed
material and technical aid over recent
years to devastated areas with com¬
mendable promptness and unstinting
generosity. Food, medical supplies,
clothing, building materials and money
have all been provided in considerable
amounts. Governments from all parts
of the world have made emergency
supplies, equipment and manpower
readily available.
A T the time of the Skopje
earthquake disaster, for example, mas¬
sive aid for the stricken population was
forthcoming on an international scale.
Over forty Red Cross Societies sent
help in goods and money. The Govern¬
ments of Australia, India, Greece, the
U.S.S.R., the United Kingdom, the
United States of America, and many
others sent not only food, medical sup¬
plies and money (either as gifts or
long-term loans) but also provided
completely equipped mobile hospitals,
building materials and prefabricated
houses.
Soviet Army engineers and a de¬
tachment of the Royal Engineers from
Britain worked side by side clearing
debris and carrying out heavy rescue
and demolition work. Even compara¬
tively small charitable organizations
like the Round Table from Britain
bought and equipped fifty caravans to
serve as temporary homes and towed
them across Europe in convoys as their
practical gesture of goodwill and sym¬
pathy.
Similar examples can be given for
all the catastrophes which have over¬
whelmed countries unable to cope
with disaster situations from their own
resources. Yugoslavia, Iran, Chile,
Morocco, South Vietnam, Pakistan,
British Honduras, Mauritius, and many
other countries have all been greatly
assisted by the generosity of the
people of goodwill of all nations at the
time of their national need.
A recent report of the Skopje disas¬
ter by Adolf Ciborowski says: "The
international help given to Skopje
during the first stage of reconstruction
was very valuable, not only from the
material point of view, but especially
because of its social and morale-
boosting consequences."
Thus it can be seen that, at the time
of natural disaster, emergency assis¬
tance flows readily from national and
international philanthropic societies,
governments and United Nations
agencies.
It is, however, an unfortunate fact
that sometimes such well-intentioned
help is unco-ordinated and often given
without adequate knowledge of the
real needs and priorities. At the same
time, however valuable many of the
gifts and the offers of assistance may
be, it is often the case that they are
not backed up by expert co-ordinated
technical aid.
One of the major problems is the panic
and confusion that arise as a natural
consequence of any catastrophe. Rec¬
ords of disasters show that, if avail¬
able, a properly organized Emergency
Technical Aid Service could prevent
a great deal of this unnecessary con¬
fusion, the effects of which are not
only felt by the people immediately in¬
volved, but can inhibit plans for ulti¬
mate reconstruction and rehabilitation.
The 1961 hurricane which destroyed
Belize, the capital of British Honduras,
killed 400 people and rendered 65,000
people homeless. That the winds of
a speed of 200 miles per hour and
the giant tidal waves which destroyed
everything in their path caused panic
and confusion was understandable, but
the construction of temporary housing
where no water supply was available
and other examples of technical mud¬
dle were beyond understanding.
This is but a single example which
could be multiplied and confirmed by
many who have been engaged on
such relief work.
0 FTEN, in the days directly
following a natural disaster, temporary
housing is erected on unsuitable sites
where essential services are not avai¬
lable. Sometimes refugees are allowed
to return to partly demolished dwel¬
lings and temporarily repaired structu¬
res that should be scheduled for total
demolition. The resulting slums, often
heavily populated, are difficult to era¬
dicate at a later date.
In both cases lack of forward plan¬
ning imposes serious restrictions on
the town planners in preparing the
final reconstruction schemes. Similar¬
ly, rubble from badly damaged or de¬
molished buildings dumped indiscrimi¬
nately without thought for future re¬
construction becomes an immediate
hazard and an impediment to perma¬
nent replanning or improvement.

M»edical aid, demolition squads and emergency supplies quickly flowed to Skopje, Yugoslavia, after a
major earthquake had devastated the city In 1963. But technical aid was lacking in the first
days, and months were needed to mobilize these skills. Today, Skopje is being rebuilt with
technical aid from many countries and organizations (including the U.N. and its agencies). Photo
shows bricklaying class in special training centre for construction workers at Skopje.
Earthquakes and hurricanes exercise
no discrimination in respect of the
buildings they destroy; the ancient
cathedral and the historic monument
are as vulnerable as the slum tene¬
ment or the shanty town. But historic
buildings are part of a nation's cultural
heritage and must be safeguarded to
give a town a sense of its continuity
and history. In the past, damaged
buildings of this kind have often been
totally destroyed or have suffered
further damage at the hands of well-
intentioned but inexpert and inexper¬
ienced demolition gangs.
The skill and care with which the
historic buildings of Warsaw were re¬
stored and reconstructed after the de¬
struction of that city during the Second
World War was an outstanding excep¬
tion. (See Unesco Courier, March
1961.) The same use of organized
technical skill and understanding could
well be applied in cases where historic
buildings have been destroyed or dam¬
aged by natural disaster.
At the time of a natural disaster
essential services and communications
are often temporarily or permanently
disrupted and this accentuates the
helplessness of the population. Tech¬
nical experts are needed to determine
the extent of damage to water sup¬
plies, drainage, electricity, roads,
bridges and many other essential ser¬
vices and to advise on temporary re¬
instatement. Confusion in this field can
not only lead to chaos but can be the
cause of epidemics and other health
hazards at a time when physical re¬
sistance to disease is at its lowest
level. These are but a few of the
immediate technical problems of nat¬
ural disasters that could be dealt with
by an internationally organized Emer¬
gency Technical Aid Service.
T HE 1963 Skopje earthquake
was well documented and received
more international attention that any
other natural disaster of this century.
Modern means of communication
meant that within a few hours details
of the catastrophe were relayed
throughout the world and a flood of
sympathy and practical help was made
available from many countries. Yet,
even here technical aid in the days
immediately after the shock was not
sufficiently well organized.
The following quotations are from
reports in The Times (London) of
October 7 and 28, 1963, three months
after the earthquake.
"Floods are causing the evacuation
of Skopje's largest camp settlement in
Central Park. Some 7,000 people have
lived in tents there ever since last
July's disastrous earthquake. This
area has now been flooded by heavy
rains. Tents and temporary buildings
collapsed. Rain-drenched tents are
being hurriedly dismantled and trans¬
ferred to safer sites where, it is
hoped, the population will remain until
houses are completed. . ."
"... Other complications, which
might have been avoided if the autho¬
rities had approached the problem with
a clear idea of what was needed at
this stage; have proved too numerous
to allow the emergency reconstruction
to proceed as fast as it was expect¬
ed. . . Skopje's problems are being
increased by bad organization."
This is not intended to be a criti¬

Three-phase timetable
demolition squads, and gifts of money
and kind flooded into the stricken area
immediately, the vital need was for
technical skills within twenty-four
hours (or less). Some months later
these skills were mobilized, and now
the permanent reconstruction plans for
Skopje are being developed and direct¬
ed by some of the world's most ex¬
perienced experts.
If UÑETAS (a United Nations Emer¬
gency Technical Aid Service) had been
available, modern jet air transport
could have ensured that a skilled tech¬
nical team was working side by side
with the Red Cross rescue and medical
teams in a matter of hours, helping to
create confidence and avoid the com¬
plications which must have made the
preparation of reconstruction plans
more difficult. Medical and rescue
work is accepted as having first pri¬
ority, but technical aid is of equal im¬
portance and urgency.
N

ATURAL disasters do not,
unfortunately, run to a readily discerni¬
ble pattern; they do not recognize na¬
tional boundaries or conform to a strict
timetable. By their very nature they
produce chaos and confusion, often
striking without warning and affecting
people who are least able to cope with
the situation in a logical and organized
way.
There are three phases in any disas¬
ter, although even these cannot neces¬
sarily be separated into distinct and
tidy compartments. If the occurrence
of the disaster is taken as zero, the
ZERO PLUS 1 is the period of rescue
of the injured, first-aid for those in
physical distress, the burial of the
dead, and attention to the immediate
needs of the population in respect of
their survival, safety, health and wel¬
fare.
ZERO PLUS 2 is the period for the
provision of temporary shelter, the
return of the community to an organiz¬
ed way of life, and the temporary
rehabilitation of homeless and often
emotionally distraught people. In this
period preliminary surveys and records
must be made and the broad outlines
laid down for the final period.
ZERO PLUS 3 is the period of long-
term reconstruction, and the perma¬
nent rebuilding of the shattered com¬
munity.
The experience of recent disasters
has definitely shown that the bounda
ries between periods 1 and 2 are not
always clearly defined and that if these
two stages in the ultimate return to
normality are too widely separated the
problems created by the disaster are
increased rather than diminished.
If an Emergency Technical Aid Ser¬
vice were available to work in parallel
with Red Cross and similar emergency
relief services these two apparently
separate phases could be usefully
combined.
HILE any natural disaster
brings confusion automatically in its
train, there is no reason why those who
bring physical relief should add to
this confusion by unco-ordinated oper¬
ations and overlapping activities.
Disaster "sight-seeing," which can
be an outward and visible sign of inter¬
national concern, can also cause
delay and muddle which is costly in
human life and suffering. It is regret¬
table that sometimes almost the first
arrivals on the scene are the "inter¬
national salesmen" of temporary hous¬
ing, building materials and equipment.
Phase 2 must, therefore, be tele¬
scoped to run concurrently with
phase 1, so that even while physical
rescue and first-aid work is proceed¬
ing, technical aid is available. This
must cope with longer-term relief in
terms of food, shelter, health, and wel¬
fare, and the detailed assessment of
the ultimate needs of the disaster area
against the background of local and
international resources.
While the temporary rehabilitation
of the community is vitally important,
the preparation of initial plans for
ultimate reconstruction is equally
urgent at this stage. An Emergency
Technical Aid Service must be avail¬
able to survey the situation, record
and analyse the findings, and plan and
prepare for the future reconstruction
in broad outline so that temporary
measures do not make permanent re¬
construction more difficult than is
necessary.
This initial emergency period of the
disaster time-table could be regarded
as a period of positive preparation for
the recreation of the damaged or de¬
stroyed community, just as important
as the actual detailed long-term plan¬
ning.
The third stage, the reconstruction
period, is a long-term one, and will of
necessity take years to reach com¬
plete fulfilment. Many agencies are
available to render this form of assis¬
tance to a stricken area. The United
Nations agencies referred to earlier,
central governments, the World Bank,
and the United Nations Development
Programme are able to make available
money, materials, equipment and teams
of technical experts (architects" plan¬
ners, economists,, etc.).
The work of these experts takes
time, and the execution of their plans
may spread over many years. The
summary of the report on the Master
Plan for Skopje, prepared by the In¬
stitute of Town Planning and Architec-
ure, Skopje, was published in October
1965, and represents an immense
amount of intensive work by experts
drawn together by the United Nations.
In spite of the realization of the
urgency of the task and the obvious,
harmonious co-operation of all con¬
cerned, two years passed from the
date of the earthquake to the publica¬
tion of the Master Plan. This is inevi¬
table, for few cities in the world's
disaster zones have ready-made de¬
velopment plans awaiting the fatal
moment, nor do they have the funda¬
mental data necessary for the prepara¬
tion of such plans.
I T is obvious that the orga¬
nization of adequate funds and long-
term technical assistance takes time,
and that comprehensive planning is a
time-consuming activity if it is to be
carried out properly and effectively.
Therefore, the emergency collection of
data and preparation of broad outline
plans by technical experts at a very
early stage after a disaster can be of
immeasurable assistance to the perma¬
nent reconstruction team and make
their task both shorter and easier.
Thus, a United Nations Emergency
Technical Aid Service could be the
strong thread that would link all the
various essential parts of the present
unco-ordinated but well-intentioned
relief and reconstruction agencies that
already exist to render help at the time
of a natural disaster.

Unesco's Director-General looks at
ethics in the mass media
THE INTRUDERS
by René Maheu
"La Civilisation de l'universel" The Civilization of the Universal is the title of a
volume by René Maheu, Director-General of Unesco, which has just been published
by Editions Laffont-Gonthier, Paris (1). An English edition is also scheduled to appear.
The volume forms part of the series "Inventaire de l'avenir" Inventory of the future
and consists of a selection of statements, speeches and papers written by Mr. Maheu
since he became Director-General of Unesco in 1962. Published with a foreword
by Julien Cain of the Institut de France, the book comprises three sections: A Uni¬
versal Ethical Code for Development; The Educational Mission; and the Universal Sign¬
ificance of Science and Culture. Mr. Maheu argues that, at this decisive moment
in history, it is not enough to proclaim men equal in dignity. A much more far-reach¬
ing task is involved, one which requires a methodical and unanimous effort for
which the international agencies and particularly Unescooffer a framework: the
patient creation of the material and moral conditions in which all men, wherever they
may be, can achieve their own fulfilment and contribute to the building of the world
of tomorrow.
The following text, drawn from this book, is the reply sent by Mr. Maheu on 10 May
1965 to the Editor of the French periodical "Plaisir de France" who had asked whe¬
ther it was incumbent on Unesco to combat abuses by the press and other inform¬
ation media, more especially in the form of sensationalism and scandalmongering.
(1) Price : 10,20 F.
T
HERE is no doubt that
scandal and sensationalism in the press
are growing evils which cannot leave
indifferent an organization like Unesco
which is dedicated to the advancement
of human dignity. Unesco's concern
is not only with the expansion of edu¬
cation, the dissemination of culture and
the development of the techniques of
mass communication, but also, and
perhaps even more, with improving the
content of education, preserving and
enriching the quality of culture, and
using the mass media for education,
science and culture.
Within the context of Unesco's over¬
all policies, therefore, I would be ready
to join all those be they public offi¬
cials, members of the profession or
civic leaders who are prepared to
take an active part in combatting these
evils.
But there must be a clear under¬
standing of what evils we are talking
about, for not only do they vary in
degree of seriousness but they stem
from different motives and hence call
for different remedies.
There is one category of offense
that I would put under the heading of
"vulgarity", as witness the hysterical
adulation of stars of the stage or
screen, or the" obsession with intimate
or trivial details of the lives of certain
celebrities.
Undeniably this is an offense against
good taste. It is a perversion of two
of the most natural instincts of man
curiosity and admiration. Moreover,
this is not done guilelessly but by the
deliberate use of purely commercial
means for strictly commercial ends.
There is a whole body of literature
which seeks to explain sociologically
or psycho-analytically the "star mania"
of today. But what might really clear
the air would be an exposé of the
business set-up and technique used to
"launch" that is to manufacture
such stars. Unfortunately, the facts
on this part of the story are much
harder to. come by.
True as all this is, we must admit
that no pressure on the individual is
involved (nothing forces me to buy
that silly paper or that childish maga¬
zine; nothing obliges me to listen to
that stupid radio programme or to
watch that vulgar or vapid show), and
the phenomenon is an integral part of
economic procedures otherwise looked
upon as quite legitimate (such as the
commercialism of the mass media and
especially entertainment), so that we
cannot justify resort to repressive or
preventive measures through legisla¬
tion or government action. This is the
domain of social custom, not of law
or authority. In other words only the
public and the profession can take
action here since they alone are impli¬
cated.
It is up to the public to choose bet¬
ween quality and trash, and in the final
analysis it is the consumer who has
the last word through his power either
to buy or reject a particular product.
I for one have no a priori lack of faith

THE INTRUDERS (Continued)
Shocking violations of human privacy
in public taste. First of all because I
do not believe that all mass-produced
goods are necessarily inferior in qua¬
lity the triumph of the paperback
book and the resurgence of what has
been termed the "people's theatre" are
two cases in point.
Then, too, experience has shown
that when the man-in-the-street is given
the possibility to choose for himself,
and the alternatives are duly explained
and made clear to him, more often than
not he will choose wisely.
The "conditioning" process utilized
by the entertainment industry excludes
by its very nature the possibility of
choice, let alone the exercise of judg¬
ment and discernment. The answer to
this should be the organization of what
I might describe as "campaigns of
critical appraisal".
As for the mass media they must
draw up their own code of ethics
without outside interference. And if I
may say so, I think that it is high time
this was done. Has the time not come
for those who control and work with
the information and entertainment
media reaching millions of people to
recognize that their responsibilities
are in direct relation to the fantastic
power they now have either to inform
or deform, to educate or stultify?
The determination of these respon¬
sibilities (apart from the ones laid down
by law which represent only a minute
fraction of the whole) should no longer
be left to the hazard of individual
viewpoints, or to arbitrary decisions
imposed from the outside by officials
unconnected with the profession. What
is needed today is a code of ethics
for the mass media as it affects society.
u
24
nesco recognized the im¬
portance of the mass media in society
even in the early years of its existence.
It has sought to throw light on this
problem by promoting research in the
field, and to raise the standards of
journalism through aid to schools of
journalism.
However useful or even necessary
this basic work may be, it is not
enough simply because it is purely
technical. Unesco has dealt with such
technical matters as the situation and
the mechanics of the mass media and
their modes of operation. A compara¬
ble effort is now needed on the ethical
plane to define more clearly basic aims
and objectives. To put it another way,
we must first have a clear idea of what
the mass media stand for in order to
establish the responsibilities of the
journalist, particularly in relation to the
rights of the public which receives the
information.
This task, I think, is essentially a
matter for the profession itself to work
out because (and I consider this to be
of utmost importance) since freedom
of the press is the corner stone. of all
the mass media it is the members of
the profession who should take the
initiative in formulating their own fair
code of ethics.
That at least is the principle which
Unesco has adhered to up to now and
which accounts for the discretion it has
observed in this matter. Nevertheless,
Unesco has followed with deep interest
the various attempts that have been
made in recent years at the national or
international level to induce the pro¬
fession to define and adopt a code or
codes of honour: though still somewhat
timid in my opinion, these attempts are
nonetheless most encouraging, and one
of the recurring preoccupations has
been to counteract "the exaltation of
sensationalism and scandalmongering".
I have no doubt that if it were asked
to do so by a consensus of the compe¬
tent international associations of news¬
paper owners and editors, as well as
the radio, film and press associations
of journalists and writers, Unesco
would unhesitatingly place its authority
and resources behind this movement to
give it the breadth and cohesion it still
lacks.
S
orne cases, however, call
for far more energetic measures. I am
thinking of the type of reporting which
respects neither the privacy of love
or prayer nor the seclusion of poverty,
neither the peace and quiet of a happy
home nor the grief and sorrow of
death. Here we are not merely
confronted with offences against good
taste or breaches of social decorum
but outrages against the human person.
These intrusions into the private life
of the individual have rightly been
called a "violation of the personality".
(I am not speaking, of course, of that
publicity game indulged in by those
men and women who make it their
business not to have a private life.)
In my opinion, the notion of the
"violation of the personality" should
be recognized in law, for in the mass
civilization to which we are more deep¬
ly committed every day, nothing is
more precious and more deserving of
protection by society than the dignity
of the individual. Rough outline or
masterpiece it does not matter which
each person is an irreplaceable sta¬
tue of Man; and as with the statues in
our museums and public parks, I
should like to see the crowd kept at a
respectful distance, leaving the statue
visible but inaccessible.
Against the real excesses the
shocking violations of human privacy
prompted by malice or greed, the
occasional outcry raised by the public
can hardly suffice. Here, clearly, we
must have resort with due precau¬
tions but nonetheless with firmness
to the preventive and restraining forces
of the law.
Who could honestly object? There
are those who perhaps will invoke the
"freedom of the press" or the necessi¬
ties of the "job", but it must be repeat¬
ed that the purveyor of information has
freedom only insofar as the public
which he serves has the right to be
informed; and the public has no right
to know other people's private lives.
These are theTwo types of offenses
and indignities most often committed
by a certain sector of the Press when
it is blinded by its own power and
resources and succumbs to the lure of
easy profit or the fury of commercial
competition. The first seems to me
to come under the head of professional
ethics and the second under that of
ordinary legislation; but quite clearly
neither ethical action nor legislation
will be effective, nor indeed can they
take form, except inasfar as they are
understood and actively pressed by
public opinion with a heart to support
and if need be impose them.
The welfare of the young would in
itself more than justify a mass move¬
ment of public opinion of this kind.
Admittedly the young are not the only
ones threatened by such malpractices.
Because of the resilience and funda¬
mental good nature which characterizes
youth, young people are often much
better equipped to withstand and ward
off the demoralizing influences we have
been talking about than many adults
whose defence mechanisms have not
infrequently been slowed down with
the passage of years.
N
othing could be further
from the truth, in my opinion, than to
believe that sensationalism and news-
mongering reflect the true taste of
young people. The youth of today seem
to me on the whole far healthier and
more balanced than previous gener¬
ations. And if they do give vent to
certain anti-social forms of rebellion it
is not so much for love of violence and
the absurd in themselves as a protest
against the fact that the world we pro¬
pose they live in appears to them
largely to have made violence and
absurdity accepted institutions under
the hypocritical cloak of convention.
Nevertheless the fact remains that
the young, who represent a quarter of
the world's population, have become
an important market and that a good
deal of money is to be made (the re¬
cord industry and all that goes with it
is one example) by exploiting their
eternal yearning for romance, their
insatiable appetite for wonder and
admiration, and their extraordinary
ability to satisfy both of these crav¬
ings by accepting symbols in their
stead.
We must protect this natural receptivity
of youth from the exploitation of com¬
mercialism, for it represents the fount-
ainhead of the simple decency, if not
always the innocence, of mankind.

The mighty colossi of Abu Simbel once more in place before
the facade of the rebuilt sanctuary. They were cut into
blocks, 15 to 30 tons in weight, lifted up a hillside and
carefully reconstructed. (Dissection of the two temples produced
well over 1,000 blocks of stone). Lines of saw cuts on statues
are hardly visible and will be filled in later. Above, the last
statue of Rameses II (on left) ready to receive its face. Large
parts of second statue, including the head, tumbled to the

Below, workers on the site attend a brief
ceremony marking the latest stage of reconstruction.
IX years after it was launched by Unesco,
the international campaign to save the monuments of
Nubia has attained its objectives. Sixty countries have
taken part in this unprecedented enterprise (see the
Unesco Courier, February 1960, October 1961, Decem¬
ber 1964, November 1965).
The United Arab Republic and the Republic of the
Sudan under Unesco's auspices and with the collabora¬
tion of these 60 countries have worked to save all that
could be saved as the waters of the Nile rose behind
the Aswan High Dam.
Twenty-two temples have been moved; all monuments,
inscriptions and rock carving have been inventoried and
photographed; all frescoes from the Christian period
have been removed from ancient walls and taken to
safety; teams of archaeologists from every continent
have explored 500 kilometres (300 miles) of the Nile
Valley; all archaeological sites have been reconnoitered

and prospected, with the exception of a strip 80 kilo¬
metres (50 miles) long between the 2nd and 3rd Cata¬
racts of the Nile (the last area to be flooded) which is
still being explored.
The two famous temples of Abu Simbel, in the U.A.R.,
have been completely rebuilt and now stand 64 metres
(200 feet) above their original site, today under water.
Concrete domes are now being built above the monu¬
ments to support artificial hills designed to reproduce
the original settings of the temples.
Begun in April, 1964, the monumental task at Abu
Simbal will be completed by the spring of 1969 more
thon a year ahead of schedule.
International contributions from public and private
sources to save Abu Simbel totalled nearly $21 million.
This figure includes contributions already made or
pledged by 50 nations ($17,600,000), the yield from a
U.A.R. tourist tax introduced in 1964 ($860,000), proceeds
from exhibitions, particularly those organized in Japan by
Asahi Shimbun Press ($1 million), and sums collected
by the American Committee for the Preservation of Abu
Simbel ($1,300,000).
As a token of gratitude, = the government of the
U.A.R. is handing over certain Nubian temples and a
large collection of antiquities from other regions of
Egypt to museums in other countries. The temple of
Dendur has already been attributed to the U.S.A. and
that of Ellesyia to Italy.
It now remains to provide protection for the monu¬
ments on the island of Philae in the Nile. These tem¬
ples are downstream from the High Dam, and unlike
the sites upstream are not in danger of complete inunda¬
tion. They are, however, submerged to about half their
height. A plan for the work at Philae will be studied by
Unesco and tha U.A.R. Government in March 1967.

UNESCO
IN THE SERVICE
OF PEACE
by Vladimir de Lipski
i
HE 14th Session of the Unesco General Conference, which brought
together in Paris from October 25 to November 30, 1966 the delegations of
120 members states, including 60 ministers, was a memorable occasion in the
life of Unesco in more ways than one:
the 20th anniversary of Unesco, coinciding with this session, gave the Orga¬
nization an opportunity for making a frank and open "self-appraisal" and for
receiving numerous tributes to its influence and prestige throughout the world;
for the first time in Unesco's history the General Conference unanimously
adopted without abstentions the budget of $61,506,140 proposed by the Director-
General and recommended by the Executive Board for the 1967-68 programme;
affirming the ethical role of Unesco, "the moral conscience of humanity", the
Conference adopted a series of general resolutions stating its position squarely
on three major international issues, colonialism and racialism, development,
peace.
The 20th
anniversary
of Unesco
The Constitution of Unesco came
into force on November 4, 1946, having
been ratified by 20 states. The Gene¬
ral Conference therefore dedicated
November 4, 1966 to the celebration of
this anniversary.
The opening session of the celebra¬
tion was held in the presence of Gen¬
eral de Gaulle, President of the French
Republic, who paid tribute to the work
accomplished by Unesco in the cause
of human unity. "Intellectual pro¬
gress," he declared, "is an unquestion
ed aspiration of the whole world; ... in
spite of barriers and regardless of
frontiers, intellectual development
determines progress as a whole."
Earlier, Mr. René Maheu, Unesco's
Director-General, and Prof. Bedrettin
Tuncel of Turkey, president of the
General Conference, had recalled the
circumstances leading to the founding
of Unesco, traced its development, and
paid homage to all who are helping to
forge the "intellectual and moral soli¬
darity of mankind."
Later that day, Mr. Mohammed El
Fasi (Morocco), chairman of the
Unesco Executive Board, spoke of "the
extraordinary growth of Unesco, tangi¬
ble evidence of the progress of the
world towards greater freedom, jus¬
tice and respect for human dignity."
During this day of dedication to
peace and concord, the Conference
adopted by acclamation a Declaration
of the Principles of International Cul¬
tural Co-operation, Article 1 of which
proclaims that: "each culture has a
dignity and value which must be res¬
pected and preserved; every people
has the right and the duty to develop
its culture; all cultures form part of
the common heritage belonging to all
mankind."
No fewer than 98 heads of state or
heads of government sent congratula¬
tions and good wishes to Unesco on
its 20th anniversary; greetings were
also received from the various bodies
and institutions of the United Nations
family, and from 20 intergovernmental
organizations. Meeting in plenary
session, delegates heard messages
from U Thant, Secretary-General of
the United Nations, and from Mr. Abdul
Rahman Pazhwak, President of the
U.N. General Assembly. Miss Jeanne
Chaton, chairman of the Standing
Committee of International Non-govern¬
mental Organizations, which are per¬
manently associated with Unesco's
work, spoke on behalf of these organi¬
zations; 27 of these bodies had sent
congratulatory telegrams.
Nearly every country commemorated
the 20th anniversary of Unesco with
special celebrations organized by
governments, Unesco National Com-

Unesco's
programme
for 1967-1968
This programme, which was adopted
unanimously, shows both a concern
for stability and continuity and also a
keen awareness of certain new needs.
Continuing priority is accorded to edu¬
cation and science. The budget
directly relating to Unesco's pro¬
gramme has increased by only 7.9 per
cent.
The General Conference devoted
much time to discussing Unesco's
future programmes and affirmed its
intention to co-ordinate these program¬
mes more closely, to plan them on a
longer-term basis and include more
activities designed to promote cultural
and human values.
The Conference considered that
Unesco "should seek more and more,
through medium and long-term for¬
ward planning, to devise activities
which go beyond the framework of
particular programmes and budgets."
In the field of culture it is proposed
to make a long-term study aimed at
"ensuring for all men an increasingly
full enjoyment of their common cultural
heritage and full participation in cul¬
tural activities."
Details of the various sections of the
programme education, natural scien¬
ces, human sciences and culture, com¬
munication bear the imprint of a
double aim: to maintain existing prio¬
rity activities and to give place to new
projects which can be further develop¬
ed in the future.
In education, the established prio¬
rities relate to educational planning,
integrated with the general planning of
economic and social development; the
pre-service and in-service training of
teachers and improvement of teachers'
status; functional literacy teaching; the
use of new teaching methods, and in
particular audio-visual methods; out-of-
school education for young people and
continuing education for adults; and
the access of girls and women to edu¬
cation. More attention will also be
paid to problems of educational gui¬
dance and access to higher education,
the education of handicapped children
and education for international under¬
standing.
In the field of the natural sciences,
the most important projects relate to
the life sciences, the conservation of
natural resources, and the application
of science to development. In parti¬
cular Unesco, in co-operation with the
International Biological Programme,
plans to draw up an Inventory of the
world's biological resources, taking
into account needs resulting from the
present population increase. It will
continue the work undertaken since
1965 in connexion with the International
Hydrological Decade, paying special
attention to the problem of water poll¬
ution. It will also continue to promote
and co-ordinate océanographie re¬
search. In the future, Unesco will
increase its aid to member states for
the planning of national sciences poli¬
cies, the development of science teach¬
ing and research, the training of scien¬
tists and the establishment of "the
infrastructure of science."
While continuing its survey on the
main trends of research in the social
and human sciences, Unesco will pay
more attention to the application of
these sciences. Studies will be made,
for instance, of the relation between
the development of education and
demographical evolution, as well as
of social and cultural problems creat¬

ments of Nubia, will encourage in par¬
ticular the co-ordination of efforts to
repair damage caused to the art trea¬
sures of Florence and Venice by the
recent floods; and will promote tourism
as a factor for economic development
and the preservation of culture.
Lastly, as regards communication in
the broadest sense of the term disse¬
mination of knowledge and the interna¬
tional flow of ideas through modern
communication media the marked
increase of Unesco's activities will be
particularly felt in documentation,
through assistance to member states
to improve their documentation servi¬
ces and the fostering of international
co-operation. A book development
programme will be launched for the
developing countries; and Unesco's
interest In the use of satellite commu¬
nications for educational purposes will
be demonstrated by studies for a pilot
project covering a wide region.
On colonialism
30
and racialism,
development
and peace
On the evening of November 28,
1966, the General Conference adopted
three important resolutions on colo¬
nialism and racialism, development,
and peace. Unesco's Director-Gener¬
al, Mr. René Maheu, summed up the
historic significance of this triple deci¬
sion in these words:
"On the agenda of the General Con¬
ference were three main problems
which set the keynote for the present
session, and which are inter-linked:
namely, colonialism and racialism,
development, and peace. On the
question of colonialism and racialism,
you took stock of the world as it is,
a world which is, alas! divided by fron¬
tiers separating men and nations,
sometimes even groups within the
same nation . . . Then you unani¬
mously adopted a resolution of peace.
This is the world as it should be, the
world we dream of, the world for
which we yearn... Between the world as
it is and the world as it should be, the
resolution on development, which you
have just adopted unanimously, is of
particular importance in that it foresha¬
dows the world we are striving to
create... It is for this reason that I
regard is as the most substantial of
the three, the test of our sincerity and
our hopes."
In its resolution on colonialism and
racialism, adopted by 72 votes to 11,
with 26 abstentions, the General Con¬
ference condemns "all forms and ma¬
nifestations of colonialism and neocolo¬
nialism" and declares its conviction
that " the continued existence of colo¬
nialism and the practice of apartheid
and all other forms of racial discrimi¬
nation constitute a threat to internation¬
al peace and a crime against huma¬
nity." The Conference instructs the
Director-General "to provide the peo¬
ples concerned... with the necessary
assistance for the development of
education, science and culture and
eradication of the after-effects of
colonialism", and also to use Unesco's
activities "to expose and to help to
eradicate" all colonialist and racialist
practices.
The same resolution asks the Direc¬
tor-General "to withhold assistance
from the Governments of Portugal, the
Republic of South Africa and the ille¬
gal regime of Southern Rhodesia . . .
and not to invite them to attend confer¬
ences or take part in other Unesco
activities."
Previously the Conference had
rejected, by 60 votes to 38 and
4 abstentions, a request by the Portu¬
guese Government that the Interna¬
tional Court of Justice be asked for an
advisory opinion on the validity of a
decision by the Unesco Executive
Board which would exclude Portugal
from meetings convened by Unesco.
The resolution on peace, which was
adopted by acclamation, appeals to
all member states to "reject war once
and for all as an instrument of their
national policy and condemn all forms
of direct or indirect aggression and of
interference in the domestic affairs of
States; renounce all recourse to vio¬
lence in the settlement of their differ¬
ences; respect the right of all nations
to self-determination and independence
and freedom to choose their political,
economic, social and cultural system;
take all necessary action to contribute
to the agreement on general and com¬
plete disarmament under international
control." It further invites the Direc¬
tor-General "to submit... a concrete
plan of activity ... to reinforce the con¬
tribution of the Organization to peace,
international co-operation and security
of peoples through education, science
and culture."
This resolution marks the outcome of
the "self-appraisal" which Unesco has
made during the past year on its con¬
tribution to peace. For this purpose,
member states were consulted by
questionnaire; a first meeting of lead¬
ing international figures was held at
Bellagio in May; and a round table
took place at Unesco from October
31 to November 4, 1966. Taking part
in the round table were former presi¬
dents of Unesco's General Conference,
former chairmen of the Executive
Board, former Directors-General of
Unesco and three Nobel Prize Win¬
ners (Lord Boyd Orr, the Honourable
Philip Noel Baker, and Professor Linus
Pauling). The General Conference
resolution takes account of the results
of these consultations and meetings.
Lastly, in the resolution on develop¬
ment adopted by 68 votes to nil,
with 14 abstentions the General Con¬
ference notes that "despite the encou¬
raging results achieved . . . the gap be¬
tween the developed countries and the
developing countries is still widening
and creating greater social, political
and economic tensions."
It therefore appeals to member
states to intensify their efforts to attain
the objectives of the Development
Decade. It asks the Director-General
to explore the possibilities of introduc¬
ing more flexible methods and proce¬
dures in programmes which are related
to the Decade; and to assist member
states, at their request, to carry out
projects relating to the integration of
education in economic and social deve¬
lopment, literacy teaching, the applica¬
tion of science and technology to
development, establishment of the
necessary conditions for the optimum
development of man, cultural tourism,
and improvement of mass communica¬
tion media and of documentation and
statistical services.
It should be made clear that already
two-thirds of Unesco's total resources,
both budgetary and extra-budgetary,
are devoted to operational activities for
development projects. By making
Unesco's 20th anniversary celebrations
a demonstration of world solidarity, by
adopting unanimously the programme
and budget for the next two years, and
by defining vigorously and eloquently
Unesco's role In the service of peace,
development and human rights, the
General Conference has demonstrated
the authority, vitality and maturity with
which Unesco is embarking on its
future tasks.

Letters to the Editor
BETTER A HORNLESS RHINO...
Sir,
After reading the article on inter¬
national co-operation in National Parks
(Unesco Courier, February 1965), I
suggest a way to help to ensure the
survival of the one-horned (and other)
rhinoceros would be to equip game
wardens to anaesthetize the animals
with darts and to saw off their horns
(I do believe they would be no worse
offl).
When an animal woke up it would
no longer be attractive to poachers!
The sawn-off horns might then be sold
or given to those who would otherwise
be poachers. The scheme might be
expensive but still cheaper than hav¬
ing an army of game wardens ever
at war with the poachers.
It is better to have, temporarily, a
race of hornless "one-horn" rhino
than no rhino. This is an emergency,
so drastic measures must taken we
must ignore the aesthetic aspect of
the horn to save the speciesl

A MATHEMATICAL SLIP!
Sir,
May I draw your attention to an
error obviously a typographical on»e
in a caption with the article, by Nicole
Picard on new approaches to ma¬
thematics teaching (page 27, June
1966). The caption began, "The
Sumerians... over 3,000 years ago."
You certainly meant 5,000 years ago,
or 3,000 years before the Christian
Era.
Our granddaughter in a Kibutz
(Israeli agricultural co-operative) is
successfully learning calculation by
the new system of mathematics
teaching.
I am always glad to receive the
interesting and stimulating issues of
the Unesco Courier.

DISTORTED VIEW OF FARMING
Sir,
Geography books and textbooks of
all kinds give children an image of
the world which cannot fail to
influence their outlook later in life.
The effect might be compared to that
of a badly-adjusted exposure meter;
the photographer gets a picture, but
a distorted one.
The example is apposite when
applied to the problem of world
hunger and what is to be done about
it. Though frequently revised, text
books in most European countries are
still some sixty years behind the
times. They present an entirely out-
of-date image of farming and crafts,
and even books used for higher
studies hardly refer to factories and
big industrial enterprises.
Not surprisingly, most Europeans,
are ill-equipped to understand the
world problem of hunger and what is
being done to solve it. In many
books, pictures of horse-drawn carts,
teams of oxen and the threshing of
grain with flails still figure as symbols
of country life, which has long since
lost this idyllic character. Far too
few engineers, university graduates
and technicians enter agriculture.
This is partly because the utility of
higher studies in farming and other
rural professions is not realized, for
the reasons already given.
World hunger will not be vanquished
simply by delivering large stocks of
grain to areas threatened by famine.
Far more will be achieved through
re-education that leads people to
place a higher value on farming and
to consider it on an equal footing
with industry.

IN EVERY SCHOOL.,
Sir,
Regular reading of the Unesco
Courier for over 12 years has broaden¬
ed my horizons and kept me in touch
with up-to-date developments in differ¬
ent branches of science.
As a high school teacher I show
the magazine to my students. Much
curiosity was kindled by the issue on
Victory in Nubia (December 1964).
Students expressed high appreciation
for the mammoth work of saving the
ancient monuments of culture in Egypt
undertaken by Unesco.
I feel that every teacher and every
student in every country should read
the Unesco Courier. This would go
a long way towards establishing in¬
ternational amity and peace on our
planet. I would like to appeal to
governments of all countries to request
their schools to subscribe to the
magazine.

MORE ACCENT ON YOUTH
Sir,
The Unesco Courier is a publication
of great value, rich in knowledge and
culture. If it were to make any
adjustments in its reading content, I
think it should be for younger people.
There should be in every edition a
special section devoted to the work
and achievements of Unesco Clubs
and youth enterprises throughout the
world.
Since Unesco places such great
emphasis on young people and the
future of an orderly society in the
world, based on understanding, friend¬
ship and co-operation it must not be
found wanting in exploiting every
means to give the necessary con¬
fidence and encouragement. Thus the
Unesco Courier can be of greater
importance in playing a major role,
by its nature, scope and influence in
the battle against prejudice, dishar¬
mony and indifference which is so
widespread in the world today. I
think a youth section would also boost
sales.
We have a local Unesco Group
(aged 16 to 21) in Milltown, which
would be glad to hear from other
Unesco "fans" in any part of the
world.

SUN WATCHERS IN
THE PYRENEES
Sir,
Having subscribed to the Unesco
Courier for several years, I find the
variety of articles you publish in¬
formative and well written.
But in the article on the International
Years of the Quiet Sun (Sept. 1966)
I feel that mention should have been
made of the specialized service at the
Pic du Midi Observatory in the Pyre¬
nees. Solar observers there note the
activity of sun spots and give warn¬
ings of possible fading or other inter¬
ference with radio waves in the upper
atmosphere, which are of the greatest
value to navigators in the air and on
the ground. The service is thus one
of first-rate international importance.

Audio-visual secondary
school for France
An experimental secondary school
specially designed for the use of closed-
circuit television, language laboratories,
film strips, slides and other audio¬
visual techniques has been built at
Marly-le-Roi, near Paris. Teachers have
been given special educational and
technical training for a programme divided
into three phases: information, assi¬
milation and exploitation.
U.S. cities eager
to house Egyptian temple
More than a score of U.S. cities, among
them Memphis, Tennessee, and Cairo,
Illinois, are competing for the honour of
providing a home for the 2,000-year-old
Egyptian Temple of Dendur. The temple
was offered as a gift to the U.S.A. by
the United Arab Republic in recognition
of American contributions of $16 million
to help save the temples of Abu Simbel
(see page 25). Built during the reign of
the Roman Emperor Augustus, the 41 -feet-
long temple consists of two rooms and
an antechamber whose walls are covered
with classical Egyptian carvings.
Exploring the world's
deepest sea floor canyon
The world's deepest and longest sub¬
marine canyon (15,000 feet deep and more
than 200 miles long), beginning off Florida
and slicing through the Bahamas, has been
discovered by a U.S. scientist Dr. Robert
J. Hurley. Dr. Hurley is now charting the
Grand Bahama Canyon with precision
depth recorders, with seismic reflectors
and with deep-sea cameras. He has
already discovered immense concen¬
trations of manganese nodules covering
the ocean floor like cobblestones.
Improving technical
education in Asia
A Unesco-sponsored seminar on tech¬
nical education in Asia recently provided a
forum for discussion and exchange of ideas
in Bombay, India. Organized jointly by
Unesco's South Asia Science Co-operation
Office in New Delhi and the Indian Minis¬
try of Education, it brought together senior
members of technical education institutes
and allied fields from 13 Asian countries.
Among the topics dicussed were education
and the training of craftsmen and techni¬
cians, and engineering education.
National surveys measure
public opinion of Unesco
Public opinion surveys to measure the
average citizen's knowledge of and attitude
towards Unesco are being carried out in
several countries. Results of a survey
covering 3,000 persons in over 200 towns
and villages throughout Japan showed that
61.7 per cent of those interviewed "had
heard" of Unesco and of these more than
half correctly indentified Unesco's major
objective as the promotion of collaboration
among nations through education, science
and culture. Among those with knowledge
of Unesco's activities 71.7 per cent consi¬
dered that Unesco's work had proved
substantially effective for the promotion of
collaboration among nations.
Unesco to study Chad
Basin's water resources
A study of water resources in the Chad
Basin one of Africa's least developed
areas is to be carried out by Unesco
under the United Nations Development Pro¬
gramme. Plans to increase returns from
agriculture, cattle-raising and fishing in the
region will be based on the results of the
study. For this 18-months project, the U.N.
Development Programme will contribute
$347,000 and participating countries the
Chad, Nigeria, Cameroon and Niger over
$ 130,000. The project will be an occasion
for specialists from these countries to
undergo further training in hydrology, car¬
tography, the interpretation of aerial photo¬
graphs and topography.
World's forests shrink
under axe and power saw
An estimated 1,200 million cubic metres
of wood were removed from the forests
of the world in 1947. By 1963 the annual
wood harvest had passed 1,900 million
cubic metres, and is expected to exceed
the 2,200 million cubic metre mark within
the next ten years, reports the U.N. Food
and Agriculture Organization. FAO esti¬
mates that in Europe alone the demand for
Flashes...
A slight improvement in world food
supplies can be expected in 1966-67 as
compared to 1965-66, when the worst
setback since the Second World War was
experienced, reports FAO.
Italy and Australia have become the
33rd and 34th countries to ratify the
convention against discrimination in edu¬
cation, adopted by the Unesco General
Conference In 1960.
Dental disease in European children
has reached major proportions, reports
WHO, whose surveys in Austria, Bulgaria,
Czechoslovakia, France, Greece and the
Netherlands show that 70% to 90% of
children suffer from dental caries.
Air pollution now costs the U.S.A.
several thousand million dollars a year,
reports that country's Air Pollution Control
Association.
Cities in the Eastern Mediterranean are
growing an average of 4 % per year
compared to the region's overall population
growth of 2.4%, according to WHO.
pulp, newsprint and paper products will be
four times greater in 1980 than it is today.
More secondary schools
for Ethiopia
Ethiopia plans to increase its secondary
school places by 65 per cent before 1970
under an $ 11 million school building pro¬
gramme planned with Unesco assistance.
At present only one percent of Ethiopian
children between the ages of 13 and 18
attend secondary schools. School pro¬
grammes will be revised, by including such
practical subjects as agriculture, industrial
arts, commerce and domestic science.
Serving their country
by serving others
Young conscripts in France can serve
their country by using their technical skills
or teaching ability to help another country.
This revolutionary concept of "national ser¬
vice" means that qualified young men fresh
from university or training colleges can,
after two weeks basic military training, go
overseas to work for the rest of their
service as engineers, economists, teachers
or architects in developing countries where
their expertise is most needed. Since the
scheme started in 1963 more than 14,000
young Frenchmen have served in this way
in Asia, Africa and Latin America.
Eating noises fool
hungry fish
Sounds made by fish when they are
feeding can be used to lure shoals of the
same kind of fish into a net. Japanese
scientists reporting this to an international
symposium on marine bio-acoustics in New
York, claimed that they had succeeded in
luring carp and certain kinds of sea fish
by playing back recordings of their own
species' feeding sounds through under¬
water acoustical equipment.
Museum for the blind
A gallery designed so that the blind can
"see" works of art through their sense
of touch has been opened at the North
Carolina Museum of Art. At the entrance,
the blind visitor finds instructions in Braille
and a relief map of the gallery. Exhibits
are laid out on a counter and are usually
small enough to be picked up and handled.
They include Stone Age carvings and -sculp¬
tures from many ages and civilizations.
Helping the blind
in Africa
There are more than 1,400,000 blind
people in tropical and equatorial Africa,
including 100,000 children. Today only
one blind, child in fifty is able to attend
school and only one adult in a thousand can

be rehabilitated and given vocational train¬
ing. At a recent conference in Lagos
(Nigeria), a programme was drawn up to
rehabilitate and find work for at least
3,000 blind people in rural areas. At least
one vocational training centre for the
blind will be set up in each country.
Primary education
in Latin America
Latin America now has over a million
primary school teachers 400,000 more
than in 1957. In the last seven years, the
number of teachers in technical colleges
has risen from 1,100 to 3,000. All teachers
in Venezuela are now graduates. Within
three years, the same will be true of
Nicaragua. In Peru, 8,000 teachers have
taken accelerated training courses during
the holidays. All Latin American countries
now offer correspondence or radio courses
to help teachers who need to complete
their training.
Shipbuilding by computer
Computers will henceforward make it
possible to build perfect ships. The re¬
quirements of the company ordering the
vessel type of ship, operating costs, kind
of cargo carried, insurance and crew
costs will be fed into a computer. In a
few hours, the computer will provide
sufficient data to guide construction and
also determine the cost. If the tonnage
and speed are not those anticipated, then
the ship-owner has miscalculated. A com¬
puter of this kind is to be set up in the
shipbuilding yards at Newcastle in Great
Britain.
Air traffic
in the Caribbean
Representatives of 19 countries and nine
international organizations have been
examining the new transport needs of the
Caribbeanone of the eight regions for
which the International Civil Aviation
Organization has prepared detailed plans
for new air navigation installations. The
conference studied the planning of air¬
ports, air communications (which are still
inadequate), the development of weather
forecasting systems, air traffic control and
the improvement of pre-flight and in-flight
information services.
Teaching good food
habits in India
As a contribution to the Freedom-From-
Hunger Campaign, the United Kingdom
Save-the-Children Fund has donated 10
vans to India equipped with teaching
material and carrying teams of nutritionists.
The mobile units will teach village
people how to make the most of locally
available nutritious foods. Funds collected
in the Netherlands under the Unesco Gift
Coupon Programme have also provided
India with another of these mobile schools.
Four of the vans are already in operation.
Natural history on loan
The Passmore Edwards Museum in Lon¬
don has recently introduced a novel loan
service. Schoolchildren may now borrow
living hedgehogs, toads, mice, guinea-pigs,
rabbits, tortoises, fish and other animals.
Care is taken to see that the temporary
guests are returned safe and sound. The
children's book-knowledge of natural his¬
tory will be greatly enriched by this new
aid to "learning from life".
New schools for the
Ivory Coast
The Ivory Coast Government is to build
13 new secondary schools and will open
500 new primary classes. It is also plan¬
ning to improve the quality of schooling
through a large-scale revision of the educa¬
tional system. Primary school teachers
will have to hold at least an elementary
certificate and all young teachers will have
to complete teacher-training courses before
being given a post. The Ministry of
Education is also drawing up refresher
courses for all teachers.
New solar observatory
in Australia
Two scientists of the Australian Common¬
wealth Scientific and Industrial Research
Organization have designed some remark¬
able equipment for a new solar observatory
at Culgoora, 350 kilometres (220 miles)
from Sydney, Australia. Every 15 seconds,
precise images of the sun's surface are
produced by an electronically-controlled
optical telescope while a radio heliograph
provides almost instantaneous two-dimen¬
sional images of the radio-wave emissions
accompanying solar eruptions. This uni¬
que apparatus has the sensitivity and
accuracy of a huge aerial nearly two miles
in diameter. By detecting clouds of plas¬
ma which are formed during certain solar
emissions, it also helps to give warning
of radiation that would be harmful to
astronauts.
False teeth for sheep
Dental surgery for sheep including the
fitting of false teeth has been developed
in Great Britain during agricultural research
Loss of teeth and the consequent inability
to masticate results in premature slaughter¬
ing of sheep, but the reproductive life of
animals now slaughtered at 3 or 4 years
of age will be increased to 9 or 10 thanks
to dental plates.
The measure of illiteracy
There are 25 % more illiterate women
than men in the world. Statistics for the
developing countries reveal that 87 % of
African women are illiterate against 69 %
of African men; the figures for Asia and
Oceania are 61 % and 41 % respectively
and for the Arab countries 88 % and 65 %.
Education in the Arab
countries
In the Arab countries, whose total
population rose from 92 million in 1960
to 105 million in 1965, there were 6,300,000
primary pupils in 1959-60 and 9,700,000 in
1964-65 an average annual increase of
9 %. Enrolments in secondary schools
rose from 1,124,000 in 1959-60 to 1.941,000
in 1964-65. The number of students attend¬
ing higher educational institutions increas¬
ed from 145,000 in 1959-60 to 241,000 in
1963-64, not including enrolment in private
schools or foreign universities.

A LOOK
AT WORLD POPULATION
THE DAY AFTER TOMORROW
(Continued from page 13)
Today, with the techniques now avail¬
able (not necessarily used), two hec¬
tares can feed better than in the past,
not one man but ten to 20. Tomorrow
it will be 30 or 40. This would permit
population densities per hectare of
close to those of present-day London
or Berlin.
The brutal though effective mecha¬
nism of food supply, which once limited
the proliferation of the human species
as it does all animal species, no longer
operates. The problem is to discover
if another will take its place.
Man needs, occupies and uses space
that is, geographical places on the
surface of the earth. These are neces¬
sary to satisfy four types of needs:
the need for agricultural produce ne¬
cessary for nourishment; the need for
manufactured products; the need for
shelter; and the need for movement
(exercise, walking, sports, tourism). Let
us call these four "quantities of space"
needed by the average man h^ h3, h3,
and h4, respectively, hj and h2 are
relatively easy to measure accurately;
h3 is tricky to measure; and h4 is al¬
most impossible to calculate.
But the important fact, which Is
easily observed if we compare modern
life with traditional life, is that progress
in production techniques and the result¬
ing improvement in our way of life and
living standards are constantly reduc¬
ing hj and, on the contrary, increasing
h3 and h4. It looks as though h2 is
destined to reach a certain level at
which it will remain stable.
A:
34
S already indicated, for the
average man in the 18th century, f^
was about two hectares (five acres) of
good ground in a land with a temperate
climate; h2 was very small since there
were few industrial plants, factories
and artisans' workshops at that time;
with four or five people often crowded
into a room 16 metres (19 yards)
square, h3 was also small for the aver¬
age man (but for the wealthy with their
chateaux, parks and gardens it was
considerable often from one to two
hectares); finally, h4 was also small
as a need since low living standards
and mediocre techniques deprived the
average man of means of transport
and the desire to travel, but its poten¬
tial was immense in a world still almost
empty of men.
Thus it was the value of h1 that
limited total population until the dawn
of the industrial revolution. But
modern progress is steadily reducing
h-i. It has already shrunk to about
one-third of an hectare (and in the
view of some competent agronomists
even as low as one-tenth); by 2100
or 2200 A.D. it will certainly be much
smaller still. And while it may continue
to impose harsh restraints on certain
nations over the next 50 to 80 years,
it will probably no longer be the factor
that determines population levels in
the future.
S1 INCE one hectare is equi¬
valent to 10,000 square metres and on
the basis of present trends, it seems
likely that hx will still be the largest of
the three space quantities h^ h2 and
h3 as the year 2100 approaches. But
by then the total of all three may well
have been reduced to less than 1,000
square metres, which would allow a
population density of ten to the hec¬
tare.
There remains the term h4. Since
it is far more qualitative than quanti¬
tative, we can only attempt to define
it by having recourse to recollections
of our own travels, to emotions stirred
by discoveries made over the face of
the globe and to the prestige enjoyed
by explorers, pioneers and Alpinists.
For our descendants it is possible that
the hope of reaching an uninhabited
place will be merely something they
read about in books.
Assiduous calculators may well
compute the number of people who
would be jostling each other on the
100 kilometres (60 miles) of beaches
along the French Cote d'Azur if each
of the 550 million Frenchmen were
allowed to spend from two to four
weeks there even once in his lifetime.
They could also estimate how many
metres of beaches with Mediterranean-
type or tropical climates there are
for each Russian, each Chinese and
each Indian today, and even how many
kilometres of artificial beaches would
have to be built to allow each person
to spend two weeks paid holiday there.
Many serious-minded persons would
frown on this sort of calculation.
But I would say its merit is to
demonstrate the differences which
will exist between the civilization of
yesterday, that of today and that of
tomorrow which we are already beginn¬
ing to create.
Our modern civilization is orientated
toward an increase in consumer goods
and toward a reduction in living space.
The rich man of the 18th century had
only a horse-drawn carriage, a few
mirrors, hardly any books and no refri¬
gerator. The average man of tomor¬
row will be rich, far richer than was
the rich man of yesterday in food
products and manufactured goods. He
will be gorged with vitamins, oranges
and pineapples, aeroplanes, electric
razors, and even classical music.
B UT the rich contemporary
of Voltaire had a large house set in
spacious grounds an island of civili¬
zation surrounded by an almost virgin
Nature. This fact allows us to indulge
in some speculation on what life in
Western Europe would be like today, if
the advance in living standards since
the 18th century could have been
accomplished with a static population.
Despite his almost incalculable pri¬
mary and secondary riches, our
wealthy grandson will neither be able
to live in nor build for himself dwelling
places comparable to an 18th century
mansion simply for lack of space.
To become acquainted with their charm
and civilizing qualities, he will be
obliged to buy his ticket and join the
nostalgic and interminable throng
which in France has already been
filing over the past 15 to 30 years
through the stately homes at Vaux-le-
Vicomte, Champs, Anet, Malmaison,
Dampierre, Courance, Ormesson, Cha-
marandes...
