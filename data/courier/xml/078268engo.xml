Painter, engraver and draughtsman, the great German artist Albrecht Dürer was born exactly
five centuries ago. The drawing, above, of a Moorish girl was made in 1521 when Dürer
journeyed to the Netherlands to be present at the coronation of the young emperor Charles V.
"I painted the Moorish girl with my pencil," he noted in his diary, referring to his silver point
sketch on specially prepared paper or parchment, for which he was already famous
throughout Europe. Dürer committed the girl's name and age to eternity, noting "1521,
Katharina, aged 20" alongside his familiar monogram.

EARLY CHRISTIAN MANUSCRIPTS
FROM THE SANDS OF THE NILE
by James M. Robinson
S'ometime around 400 A. D., thirteen
books were buried in Upper Egypt, to be dug up by
pure chance a generation ago. This invaluable little
library is now to be published in a facsimile edition
by the United Arab Republic in co-operation with
Unesco. Nothing is directly known about who buried
the library. In fact, very little is known about who
discovered it. But the generally accepted assumptions
run somewhat as follows:
4
Jean Doresse, then a member of
the Institute of Oriental Archaeological
Studies (today a noted French histo¬
rian of religion and specialist on
Ethiopia), had Initiative enough to
track down the site of the find, some
twenty years ago, when the library had
only recently surfaced on the anti¬
quities market of Cairo. After their
purchase in 1951 by the Egyptian
Government, the manuscripts were
placed In the Coptic Museum In
Cairo, and Jean Doresse was com¬
missioned by the Museum to Investi¬
gate the discovery.
He equipped himself out for a minor
desert safari, and after various adven-
JAMES M. ROBINSON is head of the
Institute of Antiquity and Christianity at
Claremont Graduate School in California
(U.S.A.). He served as secretary of the
U.A.R.-Unesco International Committee for
the Nag Hammadi Codices which met in
Cairo last December. Under his direction,
an international team of scholars is work¬
ing on the English language publication
of the Nag Hammadi codices with the help
of grants from the National Endowment for
the Humanities.
tures, including being hospitalized from
the bite of a wild dog, he reached what
seems to have been the place of
burial: a cemetery from Roman times
near the modern town of Nag Hammadi
(about two-thirds the way upstream
from Cairo to Luxor), quite close to
the small village of Hamra Dom.
This cemetery was located in a strip
of desert only some one hundred
metres wide, running between the
green vegetation nurtured by the
Nile and a vertical cliff. At the foot
of the cliff are masses of fallen stones,
forming an irregular inclined plane
which one can scramble up from the
desert floor to the face of the cliff
some ten metres above the flat sand
below.
At this accessible height on the face
of the cliff artificial caves had been
cut about the time of the Sixth
Dynasty. Some were never complet¬
ed, others were used for burials, and
one contains the kind of relief sculp¬
ture and painting typical of Pharaonic
tombs. But all had been looted in
antiquity, so that by the fourth century
A.D. they were merely a row of cool
caves, ideal for hermit habitation.
Evidence that they must have in fact
functioned as the cells of monks is
supplied in the form of rather crude
red painting on the walls. Some caves
have large crosses. One has a long
text, listing by number and opening
lines a series of Old Testament
psalms, perhaps to remind the monk
which psalm came next as he mumbled
them in his devotions. One cave
contained an ascription of praise to
Zeus Sarapis, Indicative of a non-
Christian (or at least a not-just-Chris¬
tian) holy man.
Monks inhabiting these caves would
look out over the cemetery in the sand
below, where their own burial might
some day take place. There are
instances of venerated persons being
buried with a book, just as possessions
were more customarily buried with the
owner in antiquity than today. One
might also think, in analogy to the
situation with the Dead Sea Scrolls,
that the books may have been burled
for safe keeping, when persecution
descended upon the monks and extinc¬
tion became imminent.
As a matter of fact several referen¬
ces in the books themselves could
have suggested such an idea, for
several of the documents purport to
be antediluvian revelations inscribed
on stone or hid in a high mountain 'jo

that In the latter days the chosen race
would gain access to that primal reve¬
lation which was in effect a literary
fiction for legitimizing the speculations
the "revelations" contained.
Such a time of persecution may have
taken place late in the fourth century.
By this time the Roman Empire was
officially Christian, and this meant
orthodoxically Christian. Bishops
could and did have condemnations of
heretical views read in all churches
and monasteries, and the efficiency of
Roman provincial government could
put teeth in such denunciations.
It so happens that precisely the
same little bend in the Nile that makes
of the Nag Hammadi district a bigger
arable area than usual was the place
where, toward the middle of the fourth
century, the whole monastic move¬
ment of Christianity was first launched.
Pachomlus was a young monk who
first brought individual hermit monks
together into a communal life or
monastery.
With the passing of time these
monasteries, built in the lush green
habitable area, might seem all too
comfortable, too "worldly", compared
to the more austere solitary-confine¬
ment life of the venerated saints of
yesteryear. Such an idea might be
triggered by evidence that the big-city
clergy was getting control over the
monks, and even branding as heretical
The 13 volumes of Coptic texts, found
near the town of Nag Hammadi in Egypt,
in 1945, contain about 1,000 pages of which
nearly 800 are intact For four years,
an international committee of scholars,
appointed by Unesco and the United Arab
Republic, sifted painstakingly through
the jumbled fragments of the damaged
pages (left). Worms had eaten '"inlets"
and "bays" into the papyrus so that
it was a matter of placing "peninsulas"
and "islands" in the correct relation to
each other. Identification was usually
based on translation, and the conjectural
filling in of the letters in an "inlet"
or "lake" of missing papyrus.

some of the more spiritualistic of them
for the library does represent a more
spiritualistic, other-wordly religiosity
than was typical of orthodox Christian¬
ity.
What would be more natural, under
such circumstances, than to withdraw
voluntarily or involuntarily and go
back to the desert cliff's caves, distant
from the "flesh pots of Egypt". And
such "heretical" monks might well
have taken with them the all-too-
spiritualistic, "heretical" books which
inspired them.
Such a mock-up of the situation in
which the library was buried is mere
conje'cture, but does seem more prob¬
able than other hypotheses, for
example that the library was brought
together not by a heretical group, but
by an orthodox heresy-hunter both
seeking documentation for his pole¬
mics and seeking to get the dangerous
literature out of circulation. The stan¬
dard way of getting rid of banned
books was to burn them whereas
burying in a jar was in antiquity usually
a form of preservation.
One reason we know so little
directly about who buried the library is
that whoever used and ultimately

Left, this forbidding cliff face, near
Nag Hammadi on a bend in the
Nile, housed a community of
cave-dwelling monks during the 4th
century A.D. In the ancient
cemetery at the foot of the cliffs
Arab workmen unearthed a jar
in which a library of bound
manuscripts had lain for some 16
centuries. Eleven volumes still
retain their original form, their pages
being clipped together and enclosed
in soft leather bindings with
triangular flaps and secured with
leather thongs, below left

COPTIC MANUSCRIPTS (Continued)
buried it was not the same as those
who wrote it. Five or ten different
scribes were involved In copying out
the surviving thirteen books. Only
rarely did more than one scribe work
on one book. So we need not assume
all thirteen books were copied by one
and the same group.
In fact, there is reason to think the
library was not originally conceived
of as a set, but rather was originally
a series of independent volumes or
smaller clusters of volumes. For two
different dialects occur, suggesting a
few of the thirteen books came from
a different region from the others.
And the fact that multiple copies of
the same work occur in different books
suggests they were not originally in
the same library.
For example, the Bible has only one
copy of each work. No one book in
the Nag Hammadi library has more
than one copy of a document, which
suggests a similar reticence to produce
duplicates. In fact, one scribal note
expresses anxiety lest the scribe copy
something that would be a duplicate.
Furthermore, all the Instances of
duplicates are quite different in their
wording, so that it is clear one did not
copy from the other, nor did two copy
from a same non-surviving copy. They
worked independently. Apparently a
series of individual books were handed
down to a single individual or group,
only then becoming a library.
Each book is actually a volume of
collected essays, which do not come
from the same author or even the
same time or place. Actually, the
library, now in the Coptic language,
seems to have been all translated from
Greek (Coptic is the language derived
from the ancient Egyptian language,
using Greek letters).
The translators seem even less uni¬
fied than the scribes. For if a single
scribe usually copied out a whole
book, the individual essays in a given
book seem to have been translated
usually by different persons. Thus
behind the thirteen books copied by
a handful of scribes usually working
independently we light upon over fifty
essays usually translated by a still
larger number of individuals.
When one then moves a step still
further back, to the Greek originals,
we have to do with almost fifty inde¬
pendent essays (when one substracts
doublets). To be sure, one can Identify
clusters that share a common point of
view, and even seek to identify such
a cluster with a heretical group such
as the Valentinians or Sethians about
whom we know from other sources.
But what we know from such other
sources is so scant that it is almost
like clarifying light by darkness, to
use them to explain the library. It is
more likely to turn out the other way
around: the Nag Hammadi library will
be the light helping us understand the
out-of-context quotes, wilful carica¬
tures and defamations, and veiled allu¬
sions found in orthodox polemics.

As a matter of fact, the two most
important values of the library for our
historical understanding today lie in¬
tertwined right here. Of course the
library has increased tremendously our
available source materials in all by
something over a thousand pages. And
hence the knowledge of these off-beat
movements will be immeasurably in¬
creased. But this new knowledge will
also reflect new light on orthodox
Christianity, with which much of it
was in debate.
For example, Nag Hammadi docu¬
ments not only quote the New Testa¬
ment in line with their own views, and
claim Jesus and the apostles for their
side of the argument; they do in fact in
some cases prove to have carried on,
even if in a exaggerated or distorted
way, primitive Christian traditions that
gradually disappeared from orthodox
Christianity... perhaps because such
ideas had ended up in heresy.
Where this leaves us is, for example,
with a New Testament that is not
nearly as orthodox as the church fa¬
thers who collected ¡t into the canon
thought it to be. Some of the New
Testament books seemed almost as
readily to point to the other outcome.
One reason the church fathers may
have had for including in the New
Testament some of the latest canonical
books is that these late works in effect
superimposed upon the earlier books
and traditions (such as Jesus' sayings,
Paul's letters, the Gospel of John) an
unambiguously orthodox interpretation
for it was precisely they to whom the
heretics appealed.
Thus what at first sight seemed a
dusty archaeological find from a rather
obscure time and place, at least as far
as the average person is concerned,
and written in a language most rea¬
ders have hardly heard of, turns out
to be a whole library of some fifty
works; part of the Greek language
literature from which most of our clas¬
sical heritage stems; written in various
parts of the ancient world, from
Egypt to Syria; and covering a time
span reaching back into New Testa¬
ment times, picking up the story of
off-beat sects about where the Dead
Sea Scrolls leave off.
For if the latest of the Scrolls would
be near to 70 AD, when the Essene
monastery was wiped out in the
Jewish revolt, the earliest Nag Ham¬
madi text to be dated thus far ("The
Revelation of Adam") is dated In the
first century B.C. or A.D. And, just
as the Dead Sea Scrolls document an
off-beat Judaism later weeded out, the
Nag Hammadi library not only docu¬
ments off-beat Christianity, but also
off-beat Judaism.
Indeed, the shift from "scroll" a
book in the form of a long roll to
"codex" a book in the form of pages
as we use today is typical of the
transition from the "Dead Sea Scrolls"
to the "Nag Hammadi Codices".
In fact, the library is now seen to I
be much more varied than was origi¬
nally supposed. It Is usually called
"gnostic" the name of a spiritualistic,

speculative, other-worldly religiosity
that swept the ancient world In early
Christian times. One used to think
of Gnosticism as a distortion of
Christianity, that is to say, as of
Christian origin, essentially a Christian
heresy. More recent study had
already argued that Gnosticism was
much more widespread and probably
in its origin too early for such a deri¬
vation. And the Nag Hammadi library
tends to confirm this more recent
theory.
This is especially true of the part of
the library that has not yet been
published. For it so happens that what
has been published thus far, by coinci¬
dence and perhaps in part because of
its particular interest, has been largely
Christian gnostic in type. But this
impression will change when the bulk
of the library, not yet generally acces¬
sible, is made available through the
facsimile edition being prepared by the
U.A.R.-Unesco International Commit¬
tee for the Nag Hammadi Codices.
| HIS project, first envisaged
by Unesco in 1961-62, is now approach¬
ing its realization. Prior to the involve¬
ment of Unesco, about half the library
was assigned out by the Cairo Coptic
Museum to Individual translators, a
good part of which has by now been
published, so that something like a
third of the whole is already available
in published translations.
Unesco's intention has been to
publish photographs of all the pages,
so that all qualified scholars can work
on the materials simultaneously. Pho¬
tographs were taken between 1962-66
through the good offices of the Docu¬
mentation and Study Centre for the
History of the Art and Civilization of
Ancient Egypt (set up in 1955 by the
U.A.R., helped by Unesco).
But since hundreds of fragments
were unidentified and unassembled,
many of these photographs, though of
good quality technically, were not in
the form in which they should be
published. The fragments should, to
the extent possible, be identified and
reassembled, and new photographs
made of the newly assembled pages.
Over the past four years, several
institutes In the U.A.R., U.S.A., Switzer¬
land, Fed. Rep. of Germany, France,
etc., painstakingly sifted through the
jumbled fragments on the basis of
photographs and transcriptions, and
identified a large number of the
fragments.
This was usually not possible simply
on the basis of fitting contours, as one
does a jig-saw puzzle. For the worms

ABRACADABRA
The word "abracadabra" that nowadays
signifies "hocus-pocus", "an incanta¬
tion", "gibberish", has come down to us
from the Gnostics who used it as a
magic formula to ward off disease or
misfortune. According to the Gnostic
physician Quintus Serenus Samonicus,
it was to be set down as a mystical
design by dropping a letter on each line
(above). Hung as a talisman around
the neck it was said to be a charm
against fevers and other agues. The
word is supposed to be derived from
'abraxas' the Gnostic designation of
the Supreme Power. This drawing with
its ancient spelling was made by Dom
Bertrand de Montfaucon in his 1 8th cen¬
tury treatise, "Antiquity Explained and
Depicted".

THE RIDDLE OF THE
ABRAXAS' AMULETS
The new light thrown on Gnostic symbolism
by the discovery of the Nag Hammadi ma¬
nuscripts may help to solve the riddle of the
strange Abraxas stones. Over the centuries
these stone medallions with their cabalistic
carvings, the work of Basilidian Gnostics,
have been found in their thousands in Egypt,
Rome and the Mediterranean world. For
some Gnostics 'Abraxas' meant God. The
letters of the word in Greek notation make
up the number 365, the number of days in a
year. Sun worship, widespread in ancient
Egypt, remained closely linked with certain
forms of Christian Gnosticism. Winged
figures (1 and 7) probably represent the
sun. The serpent holding its tail in its mouth
is an ancient symbol both for the sun and
for eternity. In the finely carved scene (2)
two riders flank a star-spangled figure and
the serpent symbol is again repeated. An
angel or a cherub (3) sitting on a lotus
flower is the sign of the goddess Isis.
The scarab (4) represented the sun for the
ancient Egyptians. Many abraxas in the form
of scarabs have been found. Some, like the
one here, have ribbons overthe eyes showing
they were intended to be worn round
thé neck. The cabalistic writing on the
clothing of the figure (5) are prayers or
protective incantations. (6) A creature half
man, half snake. (8) Lion eating a bee. The
lion was both the sun symbol of Mithraism
and the symbol of Christ for the early
Christians. (9) Water flowing from a vase or
canope topped with the head of the Egyp¬
tian god Osiris. (10) Creature with the
head of a cock and snakes for legs.

BOOK OF LEAD. Scholars are puzzled by most of the mysterious
symbols on the 'abraxas' (left). In 1 71 9, Dom Bernard de Mont-
faucon, of the Benedictine Order, a great Orientalist of his
time, described the symbols in great detail in his five-volume
work, 'L'Antiquité Expliquée et Représentée en Figures'
(Antiquity Explained and Depicted). All the drawings on
these two pages are taken from Dom Bernard's work. The
drawings shown above illustrated the 12 pages of a small
Gnostic book discovered by Dom Bernard in Rome in 1699.
Measuring 7 cm. by 10 cm., this remarkable little book was
made entirely of lead pages, binding, hinges and nails to
hold them. The inscriptions on the first four pages are
written in Etruscan and Greek letters, but are still undeci-
phered. According to Dom Bernard, the figures represent
the hours of the day. The seventh hour is portrayed by
Serapis, a Greek solar deity adopted by the Egyptians.

easy, if the original papyrus had been
available. But It was put in safe
keeping and had not been available
since. Hence identification was usually
based on translation, and the conjec¬
tural fllling-in of the letters in an "inlet"
or "lake" of missing papyrus.
Often the contours of the "penin¬
sulas" or "islands" on one page,
whose identity was certain, would pro¬
vide the basis for placing fragments
with almost identical contours on the
preceding and succeeding pages. The
outcome of combining such methods
was a relatively high degree of cer¬
tainty in identifying many fragments.
The results of this painstaking work
were tabulated on conversion tables,
which listed each fragment by the
number of the photograph and its
position on the photograph, and, be¬
side that numeration, gave the original
Coptic page number and position on
that page. This would make it possi¬
ble, in theory or in the abstract, to
"convert" from the unordered status
of materials on the photographs to
a reconstruction of the original page
sequences and fragment positions.
w
V W HAT remained to be done
of course was to move from theory to
practice. When the International Com¬
mittee for the Nag Hammadi Codices,
convened by the Egyptian authorities
with Unesco's aid, met in Cairo, on
December 15-18, 1970, one of its
recommendations was that a technical
sub-committee be designated to take
the conversion tables that had been
put at the committee's disposal and
reassemble the actual papyrus frag¬
ments themselves.
The facsimile edition is planned to
appear in eight volumes. Those books
which have been inaccessible thus
far will be published first, so that the
scholarly world can move promptly
toward publishing translations of them.
The facsimile edition should be com¬
pletely published by 1973.
Meanwhile a complete English edi¬
tion is being prepared and will appear
in five volumes. French and German
translations, which have been ahead of
English translations in the parts pre¬
viously published, will also follow soon
upon the appearance of the facsimile
edition.
An open-ended series of volumes
interpreting the significance of the Nag
Hammadi library had also been re¬
cently launched, at the meeting of the
International Association for the His¬
tory of Religions in August, 1970 at
Stockholm.
Thus the 1970s will be a decade in
which "Nag Hammadi studies" (to
make use of the title of this series
of volumes) will be a very active and
important area of research, bringing
to light what was in effect a hippie-like
movement In our cultural past.
Below, a Coptic Christian community in present-day Egypt
not far from the site at which the Nag Hammadi library was found.
There are today some 1,200,000 members of the Coptic Church
in Egypt and a further 3,500,000 in Ethiopia. Right, the last
of the 114 sayings attributed to Christ in the "Gospel according
to Thomas". The text shown here reads: "Simon Peter said
to them, 'Let Mary go out from among us, because women are
not worthy of the Life.' Jesus said, 'See I shall lead her so that
I will make her male, that she too may become a living spirit,
resembling you males. For every woman who makes herself
male will enter the Kingdom of Heaven'."

T
HE last half century has been rich in
discoveries of priceless, historic manuscripts. The Dead
Sea Scrolls enriched enormously our knowledge of the
Essenes, who might be described as a "pre-Gnostic" Jewish
sect; the seven volumes of Manichaean writings found In
the.. El Fayum region of Egypt, in 1930, threw new light on
the duallstic Gnosticism of the Persian Mani; the Greek
texts found not far from Cairo, in 1941, clarified our
knowledge of the thought of the great Christian Gnostic
Origen. "
Rivalling all these In importance, the Nag Hammadi
codices, first discovered in 1945, are now to be published
in full for the first time by Unesco, in collaboration with
the government of the United Arab Republic. These Codices
enable us to view the doctrines of the Gnostics as seen
through their own eyes and permit us to trace the evolution
of a movement which has had a marked influence on many
religions of the world.
This was explained by Mr. Henri-Charles Puech, an
eminent French authority on the history of religions, and
Professor James Robinson, Secretary of the United Arab
Republic-Unesco International Committee for the Nag
Hammadi Codices, at a press conference given at Unesco
headquarters in Paris, earlier this year.
The scribes who some sixteen centuries ago bent with
loving and painstaking care over the thirteen volumes of
the Nag Hammadi texts, said Mr. Puech, belonged to a
community of Gnostics that flourished in Egypt during the
first centuries after the birth of Christ.
Even the specialists find it difficult to define Gnosticism
with any precision. The movement was responsible for
many of the heresies of early Christianity, although it is
now generally thought to ante-date Christianity. Mr. Puech
described it as "a current of religious thought that attached
itself to Christianity as it did to other Mediterranean and
Middle Eastern religions".
Many early Christian theologians, such as Valentius,
Clement and Origen, were Gnostics and their thinking had
considerable effect on orthodox Christian thought. They
attempted to combine Christian beliefs with others derived
from Oriental and Greek sources, especially those that
were mystical or metaphysical in nature such as the
doctrines of Plato and Pythagoras.
The Greek word "gnosis" from which the name of the sect
derives, was taken as meaning not "knowledge" as we
understand it, but "revelation". To the Gnostics the purpose
of life was ultimate personal salvation and much of their
literature consisted of aporalyptic writings.
The Nag Hammadi texto are written in various dialects
of the Coptic Language but using Greek characters. It will
be several years yet before their full significance is known.
However, the findings already announced are enough to
whet the appetite for more.
Of all the texts so far examined, the "Apocryphon (or
secret book) of John" is, according to Mr. Puech, of the
greatest importance. It takes the form of a visionary
account of the revelation made by Christ after the Passion
to the apostle John. In it all kinds of religious mysteries are
unveiled the creation of the world, the fashioning of the
first man, the future of souls, etc.
The "Book of the Holy Spirit" Is also revelational in cha¬
racter as is the "Gospel of Truth" which is thought to have
been written by Valentius himself in the middle of the
second century. A.D. There is a double interest in this
"Gospel" since it throws light on orthodox early Christian
dogma as well as on the thinking which led to the Valentian
version of Gnosticism.
^Bi^rF equal importance is the "Gospel according to
St. Thomas" which begins with the words, "These are the
sayings of the Living Christ which were written down by
Didymus Jude Thomas".
The text consists of over a hundred sayings of Christ,
many of which were previously unknown. Some of the
sayings recorded are variants of sayings that appear in the
accepted gospels and are of great interest to scholars since
the variations often conform to tradition as expressed in
Syriac manuscripts. Each saying, therefore, raises
fascinating problems of authenticity. The famous Oxyrhyn-
chus papyrus, published at the beginning of this century,
is probably a version in Greek of the same text with some
variations.
Five of the Nag Hammadi texts are in the form of epistles,
including one from "Peter to Philip, his elder brother and
companion".
It would be almost Impossible to over-estimate the
importance of the Nag Hammadi texts. In the words of
Mr. Puech, "The discovery of the Nag Hammadi library
heralds a complete re-appraisal of our knowledge of
Gnosticism. Before these texts became available, our
knowledge, at least of early Christian Gnosticism, was
based on indirect evidence and writings about heresies
which were often both over-simplified and hostile. We now
have at our disposal an abundance of authentically Gnostic
texts which In number, scope and quality far surpass the
few later Gnostic texts In the Coptic language previously
available to us." H. B.

iJfc^VERY year, some five
hundred of the world's brightest
young minds in science are exposed
to the International Centre for Theo¬
retical Physics, a rather unusual United
Nations institution on the Adriatic
coast of Italy just outside Trieste.
Most of these scientists come from
developing countries and, under ordi¬
nary circumstances, they would be
likely candidates for the brain drain.
This is precisely why the Trieste
centre is in operation with the joint
support of two U.N. agencies, the
International Atomic Energy Agency
and Unesco, and the Italian govern¬
ment. As a way out of the intellectual
isolation that drives young scientists
to emigrate, it offers them training, an
opportunity to do research at regular
intervals and, most of all, a place to
think, talk and work.
From this scientific centre where
chalk, blackboards and desks are the

writer. He is the author of 'The New
World of the Oceans" (Little Brown and
Co., Boston, U.S.A.), also recently publish¬
ed in a paperback edition.
only visible apparatus, come more than
130 papers every year in the basic
fields of elementary particles, high-
energy physics, field theory, nuclear
physics, solid state physics and plas¬
ma physics.
The centre serves to link east and
west as well as the developed and the
developing worlds. Research work¬
shops have brought together the top
people In the United States and the
U.S.S.R. on many topics and particu¬
larly plasma physics where problems
related to the domestication of the
thermonuclear energy of the hydrogen
bomb are being studied. If they can
be solved, the world will be presented
with a new source of power, pollution-
free and well-nigh inexhaustible.
Yet the pursuit of theoretical physics
cannot be justified in terms of its
immediate applications. It is the most
philosophical of sciences for It is
concerned with the study of the very
nature of matter. As such, it attracts
the most talented brains of the devel¬
oping world, the Einsteins, the Fermis,
the Niels Bohrs of tomorrow and the
day after. They will not devise ways
to build better mousetraps but they
learn to think in terms of original solu¬
tions. If they are not given the chance
to work in contact with others at their
own level, they languish... and they
leave.
Such was the experience of the
founder and director of the Trieste
centre, Prof. Abdus Salam. It might
even be said that it sprang from his
own life, from the Isolation that he
himself suffered when, after taking his
doctorate at Cambridge and conduct¬
ing research in Princeton, he returned
home to Pakistan to teach in 1951.
"I was the only theoretical physicist
in the country at that time", he told me
as I sat in his office sharing his lunch
of sesame seeds. "The nearest one
was in Bombay. You have no idea of
what than can be like. A theoretical
physicist has got to be able to talk, to
discuss, to shout if need be.
"I remember, I received a cable one
day from Wolfgang Pauli, the Nobel
laureate from Zurich, who was in
Bombay. He said he was alone and he
wanted me to come to talk to him. So
I took a plane to Bombay and a taxi
to his hotel. I went up to his room,
I knocked on the door.

TRIESTE CENTRE (Continued)
The micro-macro world under one roof
"He told me to come in and then,
without a word of greeting, he said
to me:
"The problem is, if we have
derivative terms in Schwlnger's action
principle..."
Prof. Salam was called into an
adjoining office for a moment and I
had a chance to take in his surround¬
ings. On one wall hung a framed
16th century prayer in Persian which,
he had told me, invoked the name of
Allah to ask for a miracle. A type¬
written notice had been slipped under
the glass top of his desk:
"Reminder: Mornings to be spent
on physics: No visitors No phone
calls No mall (except personal) be¬
fore noon Administrative matters and
visitors during the period after lunch
until 4 p.m. only. Remaining time to
be spent on physics."
Also under glass on a wall to the
right of the desk was a quotation:
"We have all of us to preserve our
competence in our own professions,
to preserve what we know intimately,
to preserve our mastery. This is, in
fact, our only anchor in honesty."
Prof. Salam might have written that
himself, but it was signed by the late
Robert Oppenheimer, one of the
earliest supporters of the Trieste cen¬
tre. "The day that a director of a
research centre like this one stops
being a scientist, he's useless," Prof.
Salam remarked. "Any fool can admin¬
ister. People forget that they were
made heads of centres because they
were doing good science. So they
lose their competence, they become
manipulators of men just to keep them¬
selves In power."
The entire full-time professional
staff of the centre could fit into a
small Flat or a short sentence: Prof.
Salam, the director; Prof. Paolo Budini
from Italy, deputy director; and Dr.
André Harnende, a Belgian, who is
everything else. At Trieste, Parkin¬
son's Law has been repealed. The
administrative staff has actually dwindl¬
ed from five to three since the centre
opened in 1964 but the number of
scientists it reach'' every year has
more than quintupled.
T
HE International Centre for
Theoretical Physics does all this on a
budget of no more than $600,000 a
year. Of this figure, the biggest chunk
is a generous $250,000 grant from the
Italian govenrment which also financed
the construction of its $2 million build¬
ing. Then the International Atomic
Energy Agency and Unesco each give
$150,000. The remainder is made up
mainly of contributions from the
Swedish International Development
Authority and the Ford Foundation.
This sum covers virtually all expen¬
ses from fellowships and publications
to heating and administration: Includ¬
ed is the operation of the centre's
library with 6,000 volumes and an up-
to-date reference section of journals.
The output in physics is so great today
that one American journal alone runs
to eighteen volumes in a single year.
This all began in 1960 when Prof.
Salam was a member of the Pakistani
delegation to the General Conference
of the International Atomic Energy
Agency in Vienna. He has always
had a great gift for doing a number of
things all at once: even today, he is
still science adviser to the President
of Pakistan and professor of theo¬
retical physics at the Imperial College
of Science and Technology in London
along with his tasks in Trieste. Com¬
muting between such jobs would numb
an ordinary man, but Prof. Salam
claims it enhances his productivity.
As a delegate in Vienna, he put forth
the idea of an international centre for
theoretical physics. "I was naive
then, I wouldn't dare do it today. Peo¬
ple took it half-jokingly and many dele¬
gations abstained on the vote when
It was approved for a preliminary
study. I found out that the Idea in¬
terested the poor countries. What I
wanted to do was to give the poor a
place of their own where they would
not have to beg anybody. Why
shouldn't a bright youngster in Pakis¬
tan have the right to receive the same
stimulating atmosphere as an English¬
man or an American, provided be
deserves it?"
His proposal got over the first hurdle
In 1960. It was helped over the
succeeding ones by Prof. Salam's for¬
tuitous meeting with Prof. Budini at a

dreams together.

Money was put up by a local bank,
the Cassa dl Rlsparmio di Trieste. An
offer of land, later converted to money,
came from Prince Raimondo di Torre
e Tasso whose nearby castle at Duino
has played host to Liszt. Mark Twain,
Rilke and, most recently, to the 1970
Pugwash Conference. The prince said:
"Trieste is my daughter and this Is
my dowry."
In 1962, the General Conference of
the International Atomic Energy Agency
approved the creation of a centre.
"That was the most momentous day
of my life," Prof. Salam told me. "I
seldom smoke, but I must have smoked
fifty cigarettes that day and I went
through a kilo of grapes. At the end
of the debate, sixty hands went up in
favour and we had won."
The following year, the Italian gov¬
ernment's offer of Trieste as a site
was accepted and, in 1964, Prof. Salam
and his staff moved into temporary
quarters in the heart of the city.
Four years later, they were in their
present building at Miramare, a long
double-decker sandwich in concrete
with two rows of wood-framed win¬
dows as the filling.
On the grounds of the building,
there is a small house where Prof.
Salam lives while he Is at the centre.
It Is only twenty yards or so from his
office window but he can spend two
weeks at a stretch seeing nothing
more of the outside world than those
twenty yards. He has one group
working in Trieste, another at Imperial
College in London. In the centre, he
and his collaborator, John Strathdee,
share an office decorated principally
with blackboards and equations.
Prof. Salam told me they were
endeavouring to put under one unified
scheme the micro and the macro
universes inside the nucleus and
outside in galactic space to cover the
frontiers between the behaviour of
elementary particles measuring 10-15
centimetres (that is, the number one
preceded by fifteen zeroes and a
decimal point) and the so-called
quasars that lie 1027 centimetres (the
number one followed by twenty-seven
zeroes) away from the earth. Prof.
Salam Is fascinated by the "black
holes of gravity" in space occupied
by celestial bodies that have collapsed
under the weak but relentless force
of gravity.

TRIESTE CENTRE (Continued)
The loneliness of the long-distance scientist
Theoretical physicists, such as those
found at Trieste, try to explain the
behaviour of elementary particles.
But though he may use a computer,
the physicist's main tool is his mind,
and he must have contact with other
minds If he is to keep it honed.
This problem, a major one for many
scientists from the developing world,
was explained to me by Dr. Paul Vltta
who got his Ph. D. in the United States
and is now teaching at the physics
department of the university of Dar-es-
Salaam, In Tanzania.
He had come to the centre to attend
a two-month nuclear theory course
that was just ending. "In Tanzania,"
he said, "I am the only nuclear phy¬
sicist. I am In perfect isolation.
With our teaching load, one very soon
gives up all hope of research. So you
pick up a textbook. It gets out of
date, but you're stuck with it. I simply
need to come to a centre like this."
D
IB
R. Khaik Leang Lim, from
the University of Malaysia at Kuala
Lumpur, is the only Malaysian theor¬
etical nuclear physicist. "There might
be some outside, but not in the
country. If you're on your own, you
can only read scientific journals. It's
hard to keep up. Your interest fluc¬
tuates when you get tired reading.
And there is no one to talk to."
Dr. Llm is an associate at the centre
which means that he has the right to
three three-month stays there over a
period of five years. Trieste now has
sixty such associates from more than
twenty countries. It hopes to expand
the list until it covers all the estimat¬
ed 200 theoretical nuclear physicists
in the developing world. The centre's
activities are now being extended into
mathematics as well.
He thinks that basic science is
necessary to a developing country if
only because over-specialized scien¬
tists have trouble adapting to change,
but he certainly does not believe that
Malaysia needs the whole gamut of
theoretical physics. His own specia¬
lity, nuclear physics, requires fast
computers that are not available at
home. "Here, I must think of some¬
thing to do that requires less compu¬
tation. One cannot change from one
field to another, but one can change
within a field. In that respect, the
centre helps the Individual. He can
meet people in the same or related
fields, he can learn what's going on"
Dr. Lim would like to see a similar
centre some day in Southeast Asia,
perhaps in Bangkok. He had to come
all the way to Trieste to meet Dr. IT.
Cheon from Korea with whom he is
now collaborating by correspondence.
It was once fashionable to remark
that no Einstein can come out of the
jungle, but the reply heard at Trieste
to that Is simply: "Why not?" A phy¬
sicist can come from almost anywhere.
Paul Vitta grew up on a farm in a
village 600 miles from Dar-es-Salaam,
the capital of his native Tanzania,
where he went to boarding school.
For the educational revolution is pay¬
ing off.
Omar El Amin, a research worker at
the University of Khartoum's radiation
and isotope centre in the Sudan, is
one of five brothers whose father was
a crewman on a Nile river steamer.
He reminded me that education in the
Sudan is free. It enabled him to reach
the point where he was able to go to
the University of London for his M. Sc.
in radiation physics. Of his brothers,
one is a textile technician, another is
also studying science, one is in the
army and the fourth is working in
electronics engineering at Kiev. Mr.
El Amin, an experimental physicist,
wanted to come to the Trieste centre
to "see what theoreticians do with
their long equations and their mathe¬
matics."
Scientists often say that the best
way to look at a phenomenon is to
study an extreme case. In that res¬
pect, Dr. Toshar Gujadhur certainly
qualifies as the most isolated of the
theoretical physicists in Trieste. His
home is on the Island of Mauritius and
he was returning there after an absence
of ten years that began when he went
to Imperial College to earn his doctor¬
ate in mathematical physics.
He was about to take a post in a
new teacher training institute on Mau¬
ritius. "I want to go back, my roots
are there, but it will mean complete
paralysis of the mind if I cannot get
to Trieste every three years or so.
I'm working in relativity and quantum
mechanics. Learning to me is like
food, I need it. It's a challenge; you do
it in spurts. I'm here at least twelve
hours a day, six days a week. I arrive
around eight or nine in the morning,
sometimes I go home on the last bus
at 10:30 at night. Some people prefer
to work only at night so the place is
open twenty-four hours a day."
To Dr. Gujadhur, the greatest ad
vantage of the Trieste centre is its
mere existence. "It is a meeting-
ground, it offers post-doctoral training
but, most of all, there Is the fact that
one can come back. I must be able
to tell myself that I will always be able
to come here for three months.
Otherwise, one is just cut off."
That is a precarious situation for the
physicist. Prof. Georges Ripka of the
French Atomic Energy Commission at
Saclay, who co-organized the nuclear
theory course with. Prof. Luciano
Fonda of the University of Trieste,
believes that the scientist in a develop¬
ing country runs the risk of doing
"perfectly good but irrelevant work."
If he only reads scientific journals, he
cannot keep up and there is the dan¬
ger that he will do work already per¬
formed elsewhere. "In an hour's
conversation with a physicist." said
Prof. Ripka, "I learn more than in a
day in the library."
The theoretician must also remain in
touch with the experimentalist, as Is
the case at Trieste. "Research is not
walking in a garden and waiting for a
good idea," said Prof. Ripka. "Physics,
unlike mathematics, is an approximate
science. One must construct correct¬
ed theories when new experimental
data come in. It's not that the old
theories and experiments are bad, they
are approximate. In physics, one is
always guessing. Our guessing is
never quite wrong, and never absolu¬
tely right."
A
.number of guest lecturers
participated in the nuclear theory
course as they do in all the training
given at Trieste. The centre has be¬
come a sort of crossroads for physi¬
cists in Europe and it is not unusual for
a man to come down from Germany or
up from Yugoslavia to lecture for a day
or two. The centre pays for his stay
and his own institution pays his salary
as a contribution by the scientific
community to Trieste.
Participants in the course worked
hard with three lectures a day follow¬
ed by a seminar in which each one
talked about what he was doing. Most
of the lectures were in the forefront
of the subject because, as Prof. Ripka
remarked to me, it just as easy to
teach new material as it is to teach
the old, Prof. Ripka was particularly
pleased that many participants had

Hands in revolt
Engravings and sculpture carved on the Bogomil tombs of Bosnia
and Hercegovina proclaim the faith that inspired this medieval
heretical sect in its struggle against a merciless repression by the Inquisition.
Many of the Bogomil stone communities of the dead (like the one
in Hercegovina, below) have survived, with carvings that record
ancient rites and symbols whose meanings are often difficult to decipher.
On the upper half of the tombstone, right, figures dance the "kolo"
a folk dance still popular in the Balkans but here the linked hands
of the dancers clasp a cross. The lower frieze depicts a line
of stags (see photo page 17). Below right, a cross symbolically entwined
with vines decorates the end of this tomb (see also page 17). On the side,
the sculptor has carved the effigy of the dead person, with hands upraised,
and flanked by two mourners. Far right, a tomb bearing the most recurrent
feature of Bogomil tomb decoration: a figure with raised hands.
This may be a symbol of revolt, a challenge, an allusion to the Crucifixion,
or even a combination of all three. The human figure is surmounted
by a crescent moon, a pagan symbol, and by floral designs
that are still embroidered on traditional local costumes today.

BOGOMIL ART (Continued Irom page 17)
30,000 sculptured monoliths
designs, often grouped in vast ceme¬
teries, in remote forest or mountain
areas, and about those who raised and
decorated them?
One of the first writers to describe
the monoliths In these ancient grave¬
yards in some detail was an early 19th
century traveller, - Prince Alexander
Sapleha, who sought to understand
the meaning of the carved figurative
reliefs and symbolical designs that
decorate these standing stones.
In 1802-1803 he travelled through
the republic of Dubrovnik and in the
diary of his journey, published in
Warsaw in 1811, he noted the strange
characteristic shape of the stones that
recalled, as he put it, "the roof of a
funeral vault." Prince Sapieha sugg¬
ested that the carved decorations were
meant to symbolize the eternity of life
triumphant over the destructive power
of death.
But until comparatively recent times,
no one had systematically studied the
gravestones or the artistic value of
their carvings. Dating from the middle
ages, and certainly from before the
Turkish invasion in the 15th century,
they are all hewn from single blocks,
often so roughly that their simplicity
gives an Impression of force.
About one-third of the gravestones
are richly decorated in relief with
figurative compositions whose meaning
often remains obscure. A recurrent
motif, for instance, is the upraised
human hand, but whether It symbolizes
a command or a threat, a greeting or
a challenge, is still not known.
As a feature of burial decoration,
carvings of the human hand are known
to date back to the prehistoric cave
dwellings of the Dordogne in France.
The hands depicted on medieval
tombstones, peacefully joined in
prayer, have survived from Gothic
art to the present day; they are a
familiar sign by which we recognize
the human form, a detail which is often
more important than any other feature
of a human effigy.
But the knightly, gauntleted hands of
the Bosnian barons and boyars who
take leave of us to cross the Acheron,
the Greek river of the Underworld, and
who seem to hail us from the opposite
bank, appear to have an entirely
different meaning. These Bogomil
monuments have few recumbent figures
with their hands folded in prayer at
the approach of death.
By contrast with traditional effigies
of the dead, the massive, dispropor¬
tionately large hands on the "stet-
chaks", solemnly and firmly upraised,
seem to proclaim across the centuries
that these were hands of iron, hands
in revolt, symbols of a sturdy breed
of men who refused to submit to the
will of the Inquisition as it waged its
combat against the heretics of Bosnia.
Sculpted on armour, on shields,
bearing swords and lances, these
hands recall the symbolism with which
the Middle Ages invested the gauntlet
the sign of a challenge to a duel.
In this case it was a challenge to
ecclesiastical authority, a defiance far
more radical than that of John Wycliffe,
Jan Huss or Martin Luther, centuries
later.
T
HE first printed reference
to the Bogomil cemeteries is found in
the Itinerarium, published in 1531, the
earliest known account of travels in
the Balkans. Its author, Benedikt
Kuripesic, a Slovene, acted as inter¬
preter for a diplomatic mission sent
to Constantinople by the Holy Roman
Emperor Ferdinand I, ruler of Austria,
to conclude a peace treaty between
Austria and Turkey.
Instead of taking the customary
"imperial route" via Belgrade and
Sofia, the travellers went through
Croatia and Bosnia. Kuripesic noticed

these mysterious monuments, and
copied some of their epitaphs; but
unfamiliar with the Cyrillic alphabet,
or else misled by local interpreters, he
published them in a very free rendering.
A year later a second Austrian diplo¬
matic mission, following the same
route, also noted the curious monu¬
ments to be seen "in the valleys and
on the mountains of Bosnia."
But it was not until two centuries
later that travellers halted before these
stones and tried to fathom their secret.
A Dalmatian Franciscan friar, Gaspard
Vinjalic, in a book published in Venice,
referred to the Bogomil stone "funeral
vaults"; and at almost the same time,
in 1775 a Venetian, Father Alberto
Fortis, published his famous "Dal¬
matian Journey". One of the most
remarkable passages in this account
describes the graveyard located near
the source of the Cetina, near the
Church of the Holy Saviour.
When.Dalmatia became a colony of
Venice great interest was aroused by
this largely unknown and apparently
"wild" country. Many years after its
publication, Father Fortis' book provid¬
ed Prosper Mérimée with a major
source of inspiration for his famous
literary hoax "La Guzla", which was
supposed to be a collection of Dal¬
matian poetry. All western Europe
was taken in by this picturesque and
highly romanticized work, which pre¬
sented an oversimplified picture of the
Morlachs as a chivalrous people who
lived on the frontiers of Venice, Turkey
and Austria, who believed in vampires,
fought endless battles, carried on
bloody feuds against their enemies and
chanted Homeric poems . . .
Great figures such as Byron, Goethe,
Pushkin and Mickiewicz gave credence
to these flights of poetic fancy. Thus
Mérimée's work created the legend of
a barely civilized people, primitive,
poor and backward, whose silver-
decorated weapons, splendid national
costumes, blind bards and local

customs seemed to make them as
strikingly picturesque as the wax
figures in an ethnographical museum.
Unfortunately, while the works of
Mérimée and Fortis are' well-known,
the other side of the picture, presented
by a doctor of medicine from Padua,
Giovanni Lovrlch, Is not. Lovrich, who
died young, published ¡n 1777 his
"Comments on the Dalmatian Journey
by Alberto Fortis," in which he accused
Fortis of completely misinterpreting
even the most elementary facts.
It is Lovrich who should be given
credit for being one of the first to
throw light on the problem of the
relationship between the Morlachs and
the Haiduks, political outlaws and
guerilla champions of freedom, who
for centuries waged warfare against
the Turks as the spearhead of
resistance by the southern Slavonic
peoples. And it was Lovrich who
drew the attention of the western world
to the rich historical and artistic past
of these peoples.
For six centuries the southern Slavs
were unceasingly harried and "hunted
like wolves" by the Turks. They
nevertheless raised historical and
cultural monuments and created literary
traditions, particularly the Adriatic
Slavs, who from the 16th and 17th
centuries onwards produced many
works of lyric and epic poetry, drama,
history, politics and science.
Here, in fact, was a vigorous civiliza¬
tion that had been engulfed by wars,
though this was naturally not so
evident to an 18th century observer
as it is to us today. We now know
that this is the graveyard of an art and
culture which, between the 9th and
16th centuries, bequeathed to us, over
and above the Bogomil cemeteries,
innumerable frescoes, countless pala¬
ces, castles, villas, fortresses, chur¬
ches, monasteries, towns, and other
monuments, embellished with a wealth
of artistic decoration.
This unbroken vein of creativeness
in architecture, sculpture and painting,
extended from the Lombardo-Raven-
nine and Carolingian period, through
the neo-Hellenlc and Byzantine fres¬
coes of the 12th to the 14th centuries,
up to the Ragusan, Dalmatian and
Slovene painters, sculptors and archi¬
tects of the humanist period and the
Renaissance.
It is within the thousand-year span
of this tradition, but particularly in the
period between the 11th century and
the Turkish conquest of Bosnia In
1463, that the graveyards of "stet-
chaks" were raised in Bosnia-Herce-
govlna, which had become a refuge
for heretics from every point of the
compass.
Bosnia was for centuries a Patarene,
Cathar, Manichaean and Bogomil
country, but it was mainly to Bogoml-
llsm, a purely Balkan heresy which
grew up in Bulgaria in the tenth century
and which was violently repressed in
the twelfth century throughout the
Balkans, that the mountainous and
freedom-loving country of Bosnia
offered an ideal place of refuge.
The nature of this heresy is reflected
¡n the "stetchaks", which exalt with
defiant paganism the earthly pleasures,
dancing, the joys of the chase, and
which depict animals and plants
P
| RINCE Sapieha, in the
diary of his travels already referred to,
guessed at the secret inspiration of
these great white monoliths from their
decoration: birds resembling the divine
Ibis, visions of fabulous animals, rivers
flowing beneath the stars, knights in
arms, gazelles in flight, bears, hounds
and wolves seen against a backdrop
of endless forests.
He described the graveyards of
Stolac and Radimlje, and noted the
problem they presented for the archae¬
ologist. He explained the heraldic
significance of certain details; and he
compared their unusual forms with
artistic motifs from the north, on the
shores of the Baltic, also drawing a
comparison with certain decorations
on Egyptian and Parthian tombs.
Other scholars studied the mystery
of the "stetchaks", among them a
Yugoslav, Katalinic, a Frenchman, Ami
Boue (1794-1881) and an Italian, Fran¬
cesco Cusani. It was, however, a
famous Egyptologist, Sir John Gardener
Wilkinson, who first dated the tomb¬
stones as preceding the Turkish inva¬
sion, and who has given us the most
complete account of these cemeteries.
In 1884, starting at the source of the
Cetina river and continuing Into Herce¬
govina, Wilkinson described in detail
thé shape and sculptural decoration of
the "stetchaks". Significantly, he
noted that their themes were still
closely linked with local folk tales
and stories of marriages, the deaths
of heroes, of conflicts between suitors.
From Wilkinson onwards up to con¬
temporary writers, comparative studies
have enriched the body of writing on
the "stetchaks". According to one
convincing thesis, the gravestones re¬
produce features of a very ancient
type of wood-engraving brought by the
Slavs when they settled in the Balkans.
The stylistic motifs of this art form a
whole, and are linked with both the
sculpture of the Baltic and the Cau¬
casus, and traditional Scythian and
Sarmatian art.

in Western man, and especially in the
American, that is driving him to the
monstrous destruction of his instinctual
life and indeed of his whole civilization.
Part of the confusion flows from the
failure to distinguish at least three
phases of the machine culture. One
is machine living as such, the use of
machinery in work and in leisure and
in the constant accompaniments of
the day. The second is cultural
standardization, aside from the mach¬

from machine production. The third is
conformism in thought, attitude, and
action. All three are parts- of the
empire of the machine but at varying

increasingly from the organic pro¬
cesses of life itself.
Thus with the soil: the erosion of
the American earth Is not, as some
seem to believe, the result of the
mechanization of agriculture; a farmer
can use science and farm technology
to the full, and he need not exhaust or
destroy his soil but can replenish It, as
has been shown in the Tennessee
Valley Authority (1), which is itself
a triumph of technology.
But the machines have been
accompanied by a greed for quick
results and an irreverence for the soil
which are responsible for destroying
the balance between man and the
environment. What is true of the soil
Is true of the household: the mech¬
anized household appliances have
not destroyed the home or undermined
family life; rural electrification has
made the farmer's wife less a drudge,
and the mass production of suburban
houses has given the white-collar
family a better chance than it had for

sun and living space. What threatens
family life ¡s not the "kitchen revolu¬
tion" or the "housing revolution" but
the restless malaise of the spirit, of
which the machine is more product
than creator.
HH VEN in a society remark¬
able for its self-criticism, the major
American writers have not succumbed
to the temptation of making the machine
into a Devil. Most of the novelists
have amply expressed the frustrations
of American life, and some (Dreiser,
Dos Passos, Farrell and Algren come
to mind) have mirrored in their style
the pulse beats of an urban mechanized
civilization. But except for a few
isolated works, like Elmer Rice's
Adding Machine and Eugene O'Neill's
Dynamo, the writers have refrained
from the pathetic fallacy of ascribing
the ills of the spirit to the diabolism
of the machine.
The greatest American work on
technology and its consequences
Lewis Mumford's massive four-volume
work The Renewal of Life makes the
crucial distinction between what is due
to the machine Itself and what Is due
to the human Institutions that guide it
and determine its uses.
It Is here, moving from machine
living to cultural standardization, that
the picture becomes bleaker. Henry
Miller's phrase for its American form
is "the air-conditioned nightmare."
Someone with a satiric intent could do
a withering take-off on the rituals of
American standardization.
Most American babies (he might
say) are born in standardized hospitals,
with a standardized tag put around
them to keep them from getting
confused with other standardized
products of the hospital. Many of
them grow up either in uniform rows
of tenements or of small-town or
suburban houses. They are wheeled
about In standard perambulators, shiny
or shabby as may be, fed from stand¬
ardized bottles with standardized
nipples according to standardized
formulas, and tied up with standardized
diapers.
In childhood they are fed standard¬
ized breakfast foods out of stand¬
ardized boxes with pictures of stand¬

Uniformly dressed babies (far left)
and a moon-flight rocket motor, suggestive
of a giant robot "nurse", seem like images
out of Aldous Huxley's satirical novel
"Brave New World", written in 1932.
But Huxley's ominous vision of a society
that disregards individual dignity, worships
the machine and "manufactures" standardized
laboratory babies has happily not materialized.
The machine makes uniformity of life
possible, says Max Lerner, but it does not
compel such uniformity. The economics
of mass production has put a premium
on uniformity, but for the person who has
a personality style of his own, standardization
need not mean anything more than a set
of conveniences which leave a larger margin
of leisure and greater scope for creative living.
ardized teachers ladle out to them
standardized information out of stand¬
ardized textbooks. They pick up the
routine wisdom of the streets in
standard slang and learn the routine
terms which constrict the range of
their language within dishearteningly
narrow limits.
They wear out standardized shoes
playing standardized games, or as
passive observers they follow through
standardized newspaper accounts or
standardized radio and TV programmes
the highly ritualized antics of grown-up
professionals playing the same games.
They devour ¡n millions of uniform
pulp comic books the prowess of
standardized supermen.
A
if^^S they grow older they
dance to canned music from canned
juke boxes, millions of them putting
standard coins into standard slots to
get standardized tunes sung by voices
with standardized inflections of emo¬
tion. They date with standardized girls
in standardized cars. They see auto¬
matons thrown on millions of the same
movie and TV screens, watching stereo¬
typed love scenes adapted from made-
to-order stories in standardized maga¬
zines.
They spend the days of their years
with monotonous regularity In factory,
office, and shop, performing routinized
operations at regular intervals. They
take time out for standardized "coffee
breaks" and later a quick standardized
lunch, come home at night to eat
processed or canned food, and read
syndicated columns and comic strips.
Dressed in standardized clothes they
attend standardized club meetings,
church services, and socials. They
have standardized fun at standardized
big city conventions. They are drafted
into standardized armies, and if they
escape the death of mechanized
warfare they die of highly uniform
diseases, and to the accompaniment
of routine platitudes they are buried
in standardized graves and celebrated
by standardized obituary notices.
Caricature? Yes, perhaps a crude
one, but 'with a core of frightening
validity In it. Every society has its
routines and rituals, the primitive
groups being sometimes more tyrann-
ously restricted by convention than
the industrial societies. The difference
is that where the primitive is bound by
the rituals of tradition and group life,
the American is bound by the rituals
of the machine, its products, and their
distribution and consumption.
The role of the machine in this
standardized living must be made
clear. The machine mechanizes life,
and since mass production is part of
Big Technology, the machine also
makes uniformity of life possible. But
it does not compel such uniformity.
The American who shaves with an
electric razor and his wife who buys
a standardized "home permanent" for
her hair do not thereby have to wear
a uniformly vacuous expression
through the day. A newspaper that
uses the press association wire stories
and prints from a highly mechanized
set of presses does not thereby have
to take the same view of the world
that every other paper takes. A
novelist who uses a typewriter instead
of a quill pen does not have to turn
out machine-made historical romances.
The answer Is that some do and
some don't. What the machine and
the mass-produced commodities have
done has been to make conformism
easier. To buy and use what everyone

else does, and live and think as
everyone else does, becomes a short
cut Involving no need for one's own
thinking. Those Americans have been
captured by conformist living who have
been capturable by It.
Cultural stereotypes are an inherent
part of all group living, and they
become sharper with mass living.
There have always been unthinking
people leading formless, atomized
lives. What has happened in America
is that the economics of mass pro¬
duction has put a premium on uni¬
formity, so that America produces
more units of more commodities
(although sometimes of fewer models)
than other cultures. American sales¬
manship has sought out every potential
buyer of a product, so that stand¬
ardization makes its way by the force
of the distributive mechanism into
every life.
Y
| ET for the person who has
a personality pattern and style of his
own, standardization need not mean
anything more than a set of con¬
veniences which leave a larger margin
of leisure and greater scope for
creative living. "That we may be
enamored by the negation brought by
the machine," as Frank Lloyd Wright
has put it, "may be inevitable for a
time. But I like to imagine this novel
negation to be only a platform under¬
foot to enable a greater splendour of
life to be ours than any known to
Greek or Roman, Goth or Moor. We
should know a life beside which the
life they knew would seem not only
limited in scale and narrow in range
but pale In richness of the colour of
imagination and integrity of spirit."
Which is to say that technology is
the shell of American life, but a shell
that need not hamper or stultify the
modes of living and thinking. The real
dangers of the American mode of life
are not ¡n the machine or even in
standardization as much as they are
in conformism.
The dangers do not flow from the
contrivances that men have fashioned
to lighten their burdens, or from the
material abundance which, if anything,
should make a richer cultural life
possible. They flow rather from the
mimesis of the dominant and success¬
ful by the weak and mediocre, from
the intolerance of diversity, and from
the fear of being thought different
from one's fellows. This is the
essence of conformism.
It would be hard to make the
connexion between technology and

conformism, unless one argues that
men fashion their minds in the image
of their surroundings, and that in a
society of automatism, human beings
themselves will become automatons.
But this Is simply not so. What
relation there is between technology
and conformism is far more subtle and
less mystical. It is a double relation.
On the one hand, as Jefferson
foresaw, the simpler society of small-
scale manufacture did not involve
concentration of power in a small
group, was not vulnerable to break¬
down, and did not need drastic govern¬
mental controls; a society of big-scale
industry has shown that it does. In
that sense the big machines carry with
them an imperative toward the directed
society-, which ¡n turn whether ¡n war
or peace encourages conformism.
On the second score, as De Tocque-
vllle saw, a society in which there is
no recognized elite group to serve as
the arbiter of morals, thought, and
style is bound to be a formless one in
which the ordinary person seeks to
heal his insecurity by attuning himself
to the "tyranny of opinion" to what
others do and say and what they think
of him. He Is ruled by imitation and
prestige rather than a sense of his
own worth.
These are dangerous trends, but all
of social living is dangerous. The
notable fact is that in spite of its
machines and standardization America
has proved on balance less conformist
than some other civilizations where the
new technology has played less of a
role.
Americans have, it ¡s true, an
idolatry of production and consumption
as they have an idolatry of success.
But they have not Idolized authority
or submitted unquestioningly to human
or supernatural oracles. They have
had their cranks, eccentrics, and
anarchists, and they still cling to
individualism, even when it is being
battered hard.
It will take them some time before
they can become "man in equipoise",
balancing what science and the mach-

ine can do as against the demands
of the life processes. But where they
have failed, the failure has been less
that of the machines they have wrought
than of the very human fears, greeds,
and competitive drives that have
accompanied the building of a powerful
culture.
It has been suggested that the
American, like the Faustian, made a
bargain with the Big Technology: a
bargain to transform his ways of life
and thought in the image of the ma¬
chine, in return for the range of power
and riches the machine would bring
within his reach. It Is a fine allegory.
But truer than the Faustian bargain,
with its connotations of the sale of
one's soul to the Devil, is the ¡mage
of Prometheus stealing fire from the
gods in order to light a path of
progress for men. The path is not
yet clear, nor the meaning of progress,
nor where it is leading: but the bold
Intent, the irreverence, and the secular
daring have all become part of the
American experience.

Making learning
real fun
for blind children
A
28
_ ^blind child clearly cannot
explore the world around him as
freely as one who is sighted. No
matter how hard he tries to "see"
with his fingers the objects near to
him, many things will escape him
completely, either because the objects
are too big, like most buildings, or too
small, like anything that can be seen
only through a microscope. Drawings
or photos of far-away things are of
no use to him.
An education strictly confined to
book learning or oral explanations
cannot make up for this great disad¬
vantage, and very often only produces
mental pictures which do not conform
with reality.
At Overbrook School for the Blind
in Philadelphia, U.S.A., we have tried
to counteract these difficulties by
setting up a "Touch and Learn Center".
The Idea is not new. Most schools for
the blind have some mounted animals,
models, feelable maps, etc., but very
likely none of their collections is as
large and diversified as ours with its
1,800 items. It Is not a museum in the
traditional sense, but a very active
means of instruction in constant use.
There is a world of difference, for
instance, between knowing only from
hearsay how a water pump is worked
and actually operating It oneself. Chil¬
dren are always astonished to find
how small a sparrow Is "Such a little
thing; I thought it was much bigger".
And the cured foot of an elephant
makes them aware how enormous the
real animal Is compared with the small
models they had handled previously.
Already, one can almost hear some
ELIZABETH FREUND Is Curator of the
Touch and Learn Center at Overbrook
School for the Blind in Philadelphia, U.S.A.
She founded the Center in 1959 and has
since lectured and written widely on the
use of touch and learn techniques in educ¬
ation for the blind. Her manual on teach¬
ing longhand writing to blind students is
used in schools for the blind in the U.S.
and other countries. She is the author of
"Crusaders for Light" (1959) which tells
the story of the pioneers of education for
the blind in the United States.
readers saying: "No wonder, It is easy
for these Americans with all their
money to have such a collection." As
a matter of fact, our collection did not
cost very much. The largest expense
was for a rubber model of the human
body which can be taken apart, and
which we had to buy from a school
supply house.
Most of the other models were made
by ourselves or at sighted schools
and later donated to us. A great num¬
ber of exhibits are gifts from manu¬
facturers, museums, or collectors
whom we asked for help.
It would take too long to enumerate
each and every Item in our collection.
We have a good many objects from
the Far East, South America, and Afri¬
ca. There is almost a whole zoo of
mounted animals, from a small shrew
to an exhibit about whales and
whale oil. Fortunately, we often
have the same animals in different
positions. As a supplement, each
spring two truckloads of living farm
animals come for a day-long visit
a big improvement on the additional
visits to the zoo, when there is not
enough time to really get acquainted
with the animals.
There are innumerable models of
buildings, bridges, and ships. We
have a model of a coal mine on which
the elevator goes down to the coal
layer and comes up with a filled lorry.
Most of the buildings have detachable
roofs; machinery can be handled and,
where possible, there are "cut-away
windows" so that the student can feel
how the parts move Inside.
Whenever necessary, the life size
of a small model is indicated by human
figures on the same scale; or the right
key is given by comparing the model
to some well known dimension, such as
the size of a football field, the length
of the school building, or the height of
the classroom.
A water-tank is used in the demon¬
stration of a canal-lock, which really
closes and opens so that a little ship
can climb from the lower to the higher
level. With the help of an electric
pump a water-mill turns a cogwheel
and makes some bells ring. Any
model which has movable parts, or
can make a sound, Is better than a
rigid or silent one.
The children get the greatest bene¬
fits from exhibits "In action". For
instance, when we lecture about inclin¬
ed planes, we let the children go up
a large inclined board. If they com¬
plain that the board Is too steep, we
can change it into a gangplank by
adding rungs. They can roll up kegs
or little wagons, and so discover by
themselves the advantages of the
inclined plane compared to lifting a
heavy weight straight upward.
Exhibits of Egyptian, Greek, and
Roman temples and buildings, or me¬
dieval castles with drawbridges and
moats and a full size knight in armour
are the best illustrations for these
periods. For modern times, we need
not only a large collection of aero¬
plane models, but others of the solar
system, rockets, the moon, and
Snoopy, the moon landing module.
T
HE most revolutionary new
invention for the instruction of the blind
is the electric Thermoform machine
made in California. It uses a vacuum
forming process under great heat. You
write a page in braille on ordinary
braille paper, cover this "master" with
a plastic sheet, and push it into the
heated oven of the machine. A dupli¬
cate is produced in a few seconds and
this process can be repeated as many
times as you want. Mathematical prob¬
lems, quizzes, or any other kind of
Information can be duplicated in almost
no time at all.
In the very same way "Illustrations"
to history, geography, science, or so¬
cial studies can be produced. A mas¬
ter is made from a paper base from
cardboard, netting, sandpaper, tape In
different widths, small grains, or metal
pieces in short from anything that
will feel different to touch on the
finished sheet.
Of course, the resulting picture has
only two dimensions; but it is easy to
read and by cutting and underlying
some parts with an extra layer of card-

Thanks to special teaching techniques and equipment the horizons of blind persons
have widened tremendously in recent years. Overbrook School for the Blind
in Philadelphia, U.S.A., for instance, has a Touch and Learn Center where students
are able to get a realistic mental picture of objects by handling them. Most of
the 1,800 items in the Center's collection the largest and most diversified of its kind
in the U.S. cost very little to produce. A wooden frame and some fine yarn
are all that is required to "spin" this feelable spider's web.

Feelable maps bring geography alive for blind students.
The shapes of Europe, left, were cut out
of cork sheet and then stuck to a base representing
the ocean. Minute gaps between countries
mark national borders and different types
of upholstery nails stand for capitals and other
important cities. On the relief map of Africa, below,
plastic strips placed in the gaps between countries
make borders easy to identify.

FUN FOR BLIND CHILDREN (Continued)
board, a certain 3-dimensional effect
can be produced, but any kind of pers¬
pective has to be avoided. The stu¬
dents quickly get accustomed to this
method, and soon have no difficulty
in understanding it.
The only drawback to the Thermo-
form machine is its price about
$450 plus the current expenses for
the plastic sheets. It is a pity that not
every school for the blind will be able
to afford the purchase of such a ma¬
chine its advantages are enormous.
On the other hand, the size of a Ther-
moform picture is only 28 by 28 cm.
(11 x 11 in.) so that some things the
larger geographic maps, for example
just cannot be reproduced.
To provide our school with good
maps has been one of our major tasks.
We had a lot of large, 92 by 123 cm.
(3x4 ft.) wooden maps made in
jigsaw-puzzle fashion. We improved
them by glueing the pieces to their
base, and inserting plastic strips into
the gaps for borderlines. Another
method was to nail the lines between
states or countries.
We also made maps from cork
sheets 3 mm. (1/8") thick by tracing
the outlines of printed maps and
glueing the traced paper to the cork
upside down (this makes it easier to
cut the cork). We cut away 3 mm. at
the outside of each part so that when
glueing it to the base a gap between
states was produced, wide enough to
be felt easily.
All names were printed on self-
adhesive plastic tape in braille and in
printed letters. The different states
were painted in brilliant colours for
the partially blind students. Cork
maps are especially suitable for desk-
size maps.
I
IT is important for each
student to have a small map before
him. The large map in front of the
classroom doesn't work too efficiently
with blind pupils. These cork maps
can be .made at negligible costs, and
serve their purpose better than brailled
paper maps.
When blind students are taught how
to find their way around with a cane,
it is a great help to have good maps
of city or neighbourhood at hand. For
our mobility classes, we made not only
a map of the school campus and ano¬
ther of its surroundings, but also feel-
able maps of the subway system, the
Philadelphia Suburban Railroad Ser¬
vice, a map showing all the suburbs,
and a big map of the centre of the
city with markers for all the historical
buildings, and the places of interest
to a blind person.
These maps seem to fill a real gap
in our instruction, as we can see from
the enthusiastic reception by our stu¬
dents. For most of the maps we need¬
ed a photo enlargement of the section
in question from a printed map. Once
we had ¡t, it was easy and inexpensive
to build whatever we wanted to show,
by using cardboard squares for city
blocks, balsa wood pieces for bridges
or houses, velvet paper for parks, and
upholstery nails as markers for rail¬
road stations or important sites.
A very inexpensive help with the
Instruction of blind children Is the
screen pad. This ¡s a piece of ordin¬
ary metal window-screen stapled to a

A revolutionary new invention for teaching the blind is the electric
thermoform machine. A sort of blind man's photocopier, it uses
a vacuum process under great heat to reproduce a sheet of braille writing
in a few seconds. "Illustrations" made from a variety of materials
with a different feel (cardboard, netting, sandpaper, tape, metals, etc.)
can be reproduced in the same way. A sheet of plastic is placed
over the master copy and pushed into the heated oven of
the machine. Photo, above, shows an illustration of the human eye
made by the thermoform process. Similar illustrations have been
used to teach about plant growth, place setting at table,
the development of the human embryo, the human skeleton, etc.
heavy cardboard of approximately
36 by 46 cm. (14x18 in.). If you
cover this board with thin newsprint
paper and use an oil crayon, the under¬
lying mesh will hold back the oily
material of the crayon so that the blind
student can feel what he is drawing,
while he is drawing. The screen pads
can be used In mathematics, geogra¬
phy, etc., by the students themselves;
or the teacher can use this tool for
making a quick sketch when explain¬
ing a topic.
We even found that totally blind
children who had been deprived of the
joy and pleasure of drawing pictures
can do so on these screen pads.
Characteristic was a conversation
overheard between two totally blind
girls of about 12 years of age. One
said: "What did you draw?" And the
other told her that she had drawn a
rabbit. (They had been shown mount¬
ed rabbits before this lesson). "Oh,
let me see," said the first girl, and
"looked" at the picture. She felt it
carefully tail, head, body, and paws
and then said with great admiration.
"Isn't that a very nice rabbitl"
The screen pad was instrumental, too,
in teaching the students how to sign
their names. For this purpose, the
thin paper was lined in braille. We
wrote a Manual about Longhand-Writ¬
ing, which is now widely used not only
at our school, but at other American
schools, too. Since the students get
a good mental picture of the shape of
a letter by feeling it, the results of this
method are good.
The largest Touch and Learn collec¬
tion would be of no value at all, if it
were not used- regularly. In our
school all the elementary classes
come for at least one period weekly,
and are shown exhibits relating to their
studies.
Teachers may also borrow material,
if they want to use it in their class¬
rooms. We arrange exhibits for sec¬
ondary school classes on request.
Co-operation with the teachers Is most
essential, and once it Is established,
it really works. The teachers ask for
the models they need and the Touch
and Learn Center is more than glad
to make these models, or try to find
the material wanted.
A well-kept filing system is funda
mental for the best use of a collection.
Our material is classified not only
alphabetically, but also by subject, so
that if a certain exhibit is requested
we are reminded which other items
might be used in connexion with this
lecture.
We hope that some of the ideas we
use in Philadelphia may stimulate other
schools to build up a similar collection.
As we stressed at the beginning, this
project need not to be expensive, but
some Initiative and imagination are
necessary. The work is fascinating
and the results are most rewarding.
In our case we know that it has widen¬
ed the horizons of our students immen¬
sely.
I will be glad to give more details
or explanations if needed. Please get
in touch with us German, English,
Spanish and French will be under¬
stood (1).
In any case, may 1 wish you a lot
of good luck for your Touch and Learn
Center. 01

FOR PHYSICISTS (Continued from page 16)
arranged to collaborate by post. Such
arrangements are valid, he thinks, if
they are preceded by personal con¬
tacts. "In nuclear theory, contacts
are invaluable. That's how I got start¬
ed myself. I was invited to go from
France to a conference in New York
and I talked to a lecturer there. He
got me going and he put me in touch
with a student of his in Belgium. After
speaking to him, I had the drive and
I'm sure my case is typical. That Is
why I feel responsibility to a fellow
here. He must go home with all that
he can."
Such courses are far from the cen¬
tre's main function. In fact, every
time one looks around, another func¬
tion seems to appear. Besides cour¬
ses, associateshlps, research work¬
shops and occasional symposia, the
centre has a system of federated Ins¬
titutions. They number twenty from
sixteen countries and each has the
right to send a scientist of its own
choosing to Trieste for a period of up
to 40 days a year. Such is the thirst
for theoretical physics that some Insti¬
tutions send forty scientists for one
day and they stretch their subsis¬
tence allowance to cover nearly a
week by staying In modest boarding
houses or with friends.

| VEN a week is enough to
become imbued with the atmosphere of
the International Centre for Theoretical
Physics. The long corridor that leads
to Prof. Salam's office on the second
floor is punctuated by portraits of the
centre's spiritual fathers: Einstein,
Niels Bohr, Oppenheimer, Werner
Heisenberg, Wolfgang Pauli, Louis de
Broglie, among others... and a humo¬
rous New Year's card from Lev Landau
showing the fox who fished with his
tail. The developing world flocks to
Trieste and to what these names
represent. To Prof. Salam, this is only
the swing of history's pendulum.
He likes to tell how Michael the
Scot left his native land ¡n the 13th
century to travel south to the Arab
universities of Toledo and Cordova.
Or how Mamun the Caliph of Baghdad
In the 9th century, sent the Emperor
of Byzantium a work concerning "a
new path in mathematics called Alge¬
bra." Prof. Salam blames the Mongol
invasions for the end of Islamic scien
ce. "The Mongols systematically
destroyed libraries. Before printing,
the destruction of a library meant the
end of a tradition. When the libraries
at Baghdad, Bukhara and Samarkand
went up in flames, Islamic science was
lost with them."
With men like Prof. Salam we are
witnessing an exciting resurgence of
Islamic science. Already his work has
received recognition by the award of
the "Atoms for Peace" prize a fitting
recompense for a man whose name,
Abdus Salam, means "Servant of
Peace."
With such a name he was almost
pre-destined to work for the United
Nations. He now has another dream,
a world university of which the Trieste
centre would be but one campus.
c
^^UCH a university could
meet a number of needs. There is
already a strong movement for an
institution devoted to the study of
peace and disarmament which are at
the heart of the problems that the
United Nations must solve.
Secondly, Institutes could be set up
at the postgraduate level to conduct
research in the basic sciences. Like
his own at Trieste, Prof. Salam thinks
that they should use the same built-in
plug against the brain drain by requir¬
ing their participants to spend most
of their time in their own countries.
And thirdly, Prof. Salam foresees
international campuses with truly
International faculties for the applied
sciences. "They could be anywhere:
Kenya for health sciences, par¬
ticularly tropical diseases, Iran for
petroleum and petro-chemlcals, Nigeria
or Latin America or Pakistan for
agriculture, and so forth." Gaps left
In the network of U.N. centres would
be filled by federated universities and
research institutes. "I'm after fifty
campuses, not five or six," said
Prof. Salam. "This must be truly a
world university. Don't worry, it will
come, certainly not tomorrow but
certainly within twenty years."
On that note, I left Abdus Salam.
His prediction is just a dream, but this
disconcerting man of faith and science
must be one of the world's most
realistic dreamers...

A world approach
to education
Mapping out a world-wide approach to
the problems of education, encouraging
national strategies and guiding internatio¬
nal co-operation during the Second Dev¬
elopment Decade these are the aims of
the International Commission for the Dev¬
elopment of Education, recently set up by
Unesco. The seven-member commission,
headed by Mr. Edgar Faure, a former
prime minister and education minister of
France, will survey the state of education
in the world today and its findings will
serve as a guide to Unesco's work.
Unesco appeal
for Euphrates Valley
monuments
Unesco's Director-General, Mr. René
Maheu, has called on universities, higher
educational institutes and scientific orga¬
nizations in 34 countries to help in
safeguarding monuments and cultural sites
in the Euphrates Valley. Some outstand¬
ing monuments and about 30 archaeologi¬
cal sites, ranging from neolithic to late
Moslem, are due to be submerged by the
waters of a dam now being built 170 kilo¬
metres from Aleppo in Syria. The appeal
was made at the request of the Syrian
Government, which is to present half of
the finds made during archaeological exca¬
vations to the missions helping to carry
them out.
Mexican algae cakes
Flour made from algae collected from
ponds in Mexico was the main ingredient
in some sugar-coated cakes recently sam¬
pled in Rome and pronounced "excellent"
by members of the Food and Agriculture
Organization's Protein Advisory Group.
Algae protein, If made acceptable and mass-
produced, could make a significant contri¬
bution to overcoming the world wide protein
shortage.
Curbing record 'pirates'
International action to stop "pirates"
from defrauding the record industry of
millions of dollars every year is under way.
"Pirate" industries, which produce records
and cassette cartridges without paying
royalties to the companies, artists and
producers of the original recording, are
so well entrenched in some countries that
they are close to putting legitimate record
industries out of business. A draft con¬
vention to protect record companies against
these practices was approved recently by
specialists from 41 countries meeting at
Unesco H.Q. in Paris. The text will be
given final approval at an inter-govern¬
mental conference later this year.
Egyptian temple
for Netherlands
A 2,000 year old Egyptian temple, recently
shipped in pieces to the Netherlands, is
to be rebuilt in the courtyard of the
Antiquities Museum at Leyden. The village
of Taffeh, in upper Egypt, where the temple
once stood, has disappeared beneath the
lake behind the new Aswan High Dam,
but the temple was dismantled and remov¬
ed in 1960. It has been presented to the
Netherlands by the U.A.R. in appreciation
of its aid to the Unesco-sponsored inter¬
national campaign that saved Abu Simbel
and other Nubian temples from the waters
of the Aswan High Dam. Other temples
have been presented to the U.S.A., Italy
and Spain.
The burden
of military spending
A panel of 14 consultants appointed by
U.N. Secretary-General U Thant is to report
on the economic and social effects of
world military spending later this year.
U Thant has asked these specialists to
propose effective ways to reduce and
finally eliminate the dangers of the arms
race and the economic burdens it imposes.
Such savings, he has said, could be used
to finance urgent programmes for econo¬
mic and social progress during the Second
Development Decade.
Mapping marine
pollution
A world-wide investigation of marine
pollution was proposed by the Consultative
Council of the International Océanographie
Commission at a recent meeting in Bor¬
deaux. Pollution studies are to be a major
feature of a long term oceanic exploration
and research programme that the Commis
sion (set up by Unesco in 1960) is carry¬
ing out for the United Nations. Its first
task would be to carry out surveys to
establish baselines from which changes In
the sea caused by pollution could be
measured.
U.N. international
university project
An International group comprising eight
distinguished educators has been appoint¬
ed by Unesco to submit recommendations
for the creation of an international univer¬
sity under the auspices of the United
Nations. The idea of setting up a uni¬
versity which would be truly international
in character and aims was first proposed
by U.N. Secretary-General U Thant in 1969.
A report on the feasibility of the project,
based on the Unesco group's recommend¬
ations and the views of international
organizations, governments and universities,
will be studied by Unesco's Executive
Board later this year.
Young Finns to aid
developing countries
Young Finnish university graduates are
to work as associates of senior U.N. specia¬
lists on technical aid projects in the
developing countries. Under a U.N.-Finnish
agreement, they will be employed on eco¬
nomic and social development projects
designed to make greater use of natural
resources, improve urban and rural condi¬
tions, expand basic services and train
specialized workers. By the end of 1970,
young associate specialists from European
countries were working in 30 countries
of Africa, Asia and Latin America.
Water prospectors' school
Thirty students from four continents are
learning how to find water and how to
develop water resources at a course
organized by the Hebrew University in
Jerusalem. This six-month course in ground¬
water prospecting, hydrogeology and hydro¬
logy is sponsored by Unesco and the
Organization of American States.
Volcanic research centre
Plans are under consideration for the set¬
ting up in Iceland of a centre for volcanic
research. Iceland offers broad scope for
studies in this field, since the frequency
and variety of its volcanic activity are un¬
equalled in the world.

NATIONS UNIES
FOOD FOR DEVELOPMENT
The World Food Programme was established jointly by
the United Nations and the Food and Agriculture
Organization in 1963. Its aim was not just to feed
hungry people. Like other forms of aid cash, equipment,
expertise sent to the developing countries, it is primarily
intended as a long-term investment in their future. The
commemorative stamp (left), issued last month by the
U.N. Postal Administration in 13 cents (US) and Sw. Fr.
0.50 denominations, marks the efforts of the World Food
Programme over the last eight years. As agent in France
for the U.N. Postal Administration, Unesco's Philatelic
Service stocks all U.N. stamps and first day covers
currently on sale. For details write to the Unesco Philate¬
lic Service, Unesco, Place de Fontenoy, Paris-7e.

Letters to the Editor
MAN AND VIOLENCE
Sir,
As a teenager in the final year of
secondary school, I would like to say
how useful I find the "Unesco Courier",
culturally and educationally.
Just one example that comes to mind
is the use we made in the classroom
of your issue "Man and Violence"
(August-September 1970). It served as
the basis for study and discussions on
man's aggressiveness, during our philo¬
sophy course.
in my view this was one of the most
outstanding issues of the past three
years. I was thus surprised to read
the letter to the editor (January 1971)
criticizing the amount of space it
devoted to describing experiments
aimed at deducing human nature from
the behaviour of animals.
In view of the importance of research
in this field, I feel that such studies are
necessary since they help to clarify
many aspects of a situation that affects
us all, but to which we often prefer
to close our eyes.
M. Laglaine
Royan, France
SCIENCE OF SURVIVAL
Sir,
Congratulations on the article "Peace
Research the Science of Survival" by
Bert Röling {November 1970). It makes
clear how imperative it is to analyse
different ideas on the meanings of the
same words, since misuses of concepts
have many times led to war.
Among interesting features in other
Issues, I would like to mention the
drawings of the formation of the mid-
Atlantic Ridge (July 1970). Bravo for
the December 1969 number on "The
Sculpture of Vibrations", with its won¬
derful descriptions and illustrations.
One suggestion: why not more issues
on little-known countries? (I have in
mind the feature you published on
Mongolia in November 1969).
I hope your magazine will continue
to show Man as the builder of the
broad road of progress (to a world
where the absurdities of today poverty,
hunger, social injustice, colonialism and
man's systematic destruction of man
will be things of the past).

'SECURITY COUNCIL'
FOR NATURE AND MAN
Sir,
Your issue on Man and Violence
(August-September 1970) dealt with
problems vital to mankind, and I am
sure It has brought you letters from
readers the world over.
While reading the article, "Man,
Killer of Nature", it occurred to me that
Unesco should propose the calling of
a special session of the U.N. General
Assembly, to discuss the creation of
a Council for the Protection of Nature
and Mankind. This new body within
the U.N. system could be vested with
similar powers to the Security Council.
In my view, the U.N. International
Conference on Problems of the Human
Environment, to be held in Stockholm
next year, could prepare material for
discussion by the special session of
the U.N. General Assembly referred
to above.

MORE VARIETY 7
Sir.
I am afraid I shall not be renewing
my subscription to the "Unesco Cou¬
rier".
My only criticism is that I would
like you to present more subjects in
each issue, instead of devoting nearly
all of them to a single theme.
Eliane Jacquet
Limoges, France
INTERNATIONALLY-MINDED
SCHOOLS
Sir,
In the article, "United World Col¬
leges a new concept in international
education" (October 1970), we read
with pleasure your account of a recent
venture in the development of interna¬
tionally-minded education. But surpris¬
ingly enough no mention was made of
other "pioneer" experiments in this
field, some of them dating back a quar¬
ter of a century or more.
Our own school, the College Céve¬
nol International, at Chambon-sur-Li-
gnon, in the Massif Central region of
France, was founded in 1938. A secon¬
dary school for boys and girls aged
between 11 and 19, it aims to give a
"Christian education for peace and
international understanding", notably
through the efforts of its teaching staff
and its 350 students who come from a
score of countries on five continents.
With the support and encouragement
of many organizations, including the
International Fellowship of Reconcilia¬
tion movement, it has long practised
"modern" education in the widest
sense of the term: co-education, stu¬
dent self-discipline and participation in
management, contact with nature, and
manual work closely linked to studies.
It provides annual summer courses,
including an international work camp
and an International programme in
languages, art and culture.
Your article rightly refers to problems
that exist in France, for example, where
only national diplomas are accepted.
But one sign of progress it that two
"pilot" schools in France and two
others in the Fed. Rep. of Germany
have now been authorized to follow
programmes leading to a Franco-Ger¬
man baccalauréat. We ourselves are
studying the possibility of preparing
students for the "International Bacca¬
lauréat", a project also described in
your article. It would, of course, be
far better if such efforts were more
co-oidinated so that those engaged in
them would feel less isolated in their
attempts to accomplish a task for which
there will never be too many heads and
hands.

THE OTHER CULTURE
Sir.
In your issue "Cultural Policy a
Modern Dilemma" (January, 1971) the
discussions on culture dealt only with
those things that are external to man
culture as related to science, litera¬
ture, history, politics, etc., in other
words forms of culture that satisfy his
physical, intellectual and social needs
and desires.
But, as we are all aware, the con¬
tinuing development of this culture does
not stop men from hating and torturing
one another.
There is another aspect of culture
that seems to be neglected the per¬
sonal, inner culture, which consists in
developing feelings of solidarity,
altruism and love for others, in learning
to understand and respect them even
if they do not think as we do, in
eradicating the poisonous roots of
aggressivity, in helping those who suffer
by giving freely of oneself.
In my view, a combination of these
two aspects of culture would bring
happiness and peace to mankind.

THE PUBLIC AND MODERN ART

inquiry into public attitudes towards
modern art. More than interesting, we

JERUSALEM'S HISTORIC SITE
Sir,
While the news media are constantly
bringing to our attention the political
situation in the Middle East, few people
realize that the region of Jerusalem is
being systematically destroyed by
building activity. Judging by the frantic
rhythm at which new roads and apart¬
ment blocks are already being built on
the hills surrounding the old city, it is
easy to foresee that within a short time
the exceptionally beautiful region will
be transformed into an ugly sprawl of
endless suburbs . . .
Jerusalem is just a small city in the
Jordean Mountains. Yet it has played
one of the most important roles any
city has ever played in human history.
Jerusalem is the Holy City of three
religions and as a symbol the city has
far greater importance that mere phy¬
sical size can ever bestow on her.
By surrounding the Old City with
massive new developments, its fragile
life will be crushed.
There are places where one simply
does not build, and Jerusalem is such
a place. The architecture of Jerusalem
exists already the Old City and its
landscape creating a unique architec¬
tural space. In Jerusalem no construc¬
tion, however good, can replace the
architectural beauty it inevitably
destroys. N. S. Neumann

Announcing a Special
Unesco Courier Anthology
135 pages Nearly 120 photos and drawings
£3.25 - $11.50
What goes by the name of " World History " in many countries is
often western history amplified by a few unrelated chapters on other
parts of the world. The publication of "Eastern Cultures", based on a
selection of articles that have appeared in the Unesco Courier,
will help to dissipate some of the prevalent Western misconceptions
about the East. Its material about various aspects of Eastern culture,
history and contemporary life will help teachers to enrich their lessons
on Eastern and Western Asia.
Divided into 12 chapters, the book deals with a broad range
of subjects such as languages of Asia architecture,
sculpture and painting music, minor arts and astronomy
the impact of Buddhism Nubian monuments New Year
festivals tradition in transition in Japan influences of
great men the women of new Asia economic and social
problems.
This book is totally different from the Unesco Courier Anthology

MEDIEVAL
TOMBSTONE ART
OF YUGOSLAVIA
This tombstone figure with hands joined in prayer is a striking example of
an original and still relatively unknown art in stone that flourished in
medieval Yugoslavia. Some 30,000 tombs, sarcophagi and coffins decorated
with figures, scenes from daily life and mysterious symbols still survive,
often in remote mountain and forest cemeteries. This 15th-century limestone
carving (150 cm. by 80 cm.) from Opravdic-Bratunac, is now in the National
Museum of Bosnia-Hercegovina, at Sarajevo. (See article page 17).
