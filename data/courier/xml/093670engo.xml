A LETTER
FROM
FREUD TO
EINSTEIN
Is there a way of freeing humankind from the threat of war? Can
human aggression be channeled to help protect people against
the impulses of hatred and destruction?
These questions were put to Sigmund Freud in an anxious
letter from Albert Einstein dated 30 July 1932, when Fascist and
Nazi violence was spreading in Europe. The father of
psychoanalysis, whom Einstein described as an "expert in the
lore of human instincts", replied two months later, spelling out
his thoughts on the psychical foundations of behaviour and
defining possible ways in which the conflicts rending humanity
could be brought to a halt.
Their correspondence was published in 1933, under the title
Why War?, by Unesco's precursor, the International Institute of
Intellectual Co-operation. With a number of other exchanges
between leading thinkers of the day, it constitutes one of the
most remarkable initiatives taken by the League of Nations
(whose mission was taken over by the United Nations
Organization in 1946) to preserve the spirit of peace at a time
when it was increasingly under threat. Sixty years on, this little-
known document has lost none of its interest or validity.
Salient extracts from Einstein's letter appeared in the May
1985 issue of the Unesco Courier entitled Forty Years After,
commemorating the end of World War II. Now for the first time
we publish Sigmund Freud's reply, in slightly abridged form.

Why war?
by Sigmund Freud
You begin with the relations between Might
and Right, and this is assuredly the proper
starting-point for our enquiry. But, for the
term "might", I would substitute a tougher
and more telling word: "violence". In right
and violence we have today an obvious
antinomy. It is easy to prove that one has
evolved from the other. . . .
Conflicts of interest between man and
man are resolved, in principle, by recourse to
violence. It is the same in the animal kingdom,
from which man cannot claim exclusion; nev¬
ertheless men are also prone to conflicts of
opinion, touching, on occasion, the loftiest
peaks of abstract thought, which seem to call
for settlement by quite another method. This
refinement is, however, a late development.
To start with, brute force was the factor
which, in small communities, decided points
of ownership and the question of which man's
will was to prevail. Very soon physical force
was implemented, then replaced, by the use
of various adjuncts; he proved the victor
whose weapon was the better, or handled the
more skilfully.
Now, for the first time, with the coming
Translated into English by Stuart Gilbert
of weapons, superior brains began to oust
brute force, but the object of the conflict
remained the same: one party was to be con¬
strained, by the injury done him or impair¬
ment of his strength, to retract a claim or a
refusal. This end is most effectively gained
when the opponent is definitively put out of
action in other words, is killed.
This procedure has two advantages; the
enemy cannot renew hostilities, and, sec¬
ondly, his fate deters others from following
his example. Moreover, the slaughter of a foe
gratifies an instinctive craving a point to
which we shall revert hereafter. However,
another consideration may be set off against
this will to kill: the possibility of using an
enemy for servile tasks if his spirit be broken
and his life spared. Here violence finds an
outlet not in slaughter but in subjugation.
Hence springs the practice of giving quarter;
but the victor, having from now on to reckon
with the craving for revenge that rankles in his
victim, forfeits to some extent his personal
security.
From violence to law
... We know that in the course of evolution
this state of things was modified, a path was
traced that led away from violence to law.
But what was this path? Surely it issued from
a single verity; that the superiority of one
strong man can be overborne by an alliance of
many weaklings, that l'union fait la force.
Brute force is overcome by union, the allied
might of scattered units makes good its right
against the isolated giant.
Thus we may define "right" (i.e. law) as
the might of a community. Yet it, too, is
nothing else than violence, quick to attack
whatever individual stands in its path, and it
employs the selfsame methods, follows like
ends, with but one difference; it is the com¬
munal, not individual, violence that has its
way.
But, for the transition from crude vio¬
lence to the reign of law, a certain psycho¬
logical condition must first obtain. The union
of the majority must be stable and enduring.
If its sole raison d'être be the discomfiture of
some overweening individual and, after his
downfall, it be dissolved, it leads to nothing.
Some other man, trusting to his superior
power, will seek to reinstate the rule of vio¬
lence and the cycle will repeat itself unend¬
ingly.
Thus the union of the people must be
permanent and well-organized; it must enact
rules to meet the risk of possible revolts;
must set up machinery ensuring that its
rules the laws are observed and that such
acts of violence as the laws demand are duly
carried out. This recognition of a community

of interests engenders among the members of
the group a sentiment of unity and fraternal
solidarity which constitutes its real strength.
. . . Now the position is simple enough so
long as the community consists of a number of
equipollent individuals. The laws of such a
group can determine to what extent the indi¬
vidual must forfeit his personal freedom, the
right of using personal force as an instrument
of violence, to ensure the safety of the group.
But such a combination is only theoret¬
ically possible; in practice the situation is
always complicated by the fact that, from the
outset, the group includes elements of unequal
power, men and women, elders and children,
and, very soon, as a result of war and conquest,
victors and the vanquished i.e. masters and
slaves as well. From this time on the
common law takes notice of these inequalities
of power, laws are made by and for the rulers,
giving the servile classes fewer rights.
Thenceforward there exist within the
state two factors making for legal instability,
but legislative evolution, too: first, the
attempts by members of the ruling class to set
themselves above the law's restrictions and,
secondly, the constant struggle of the ruled to
extend their rights and see each gain
embodied in the code, replacing legal dis¬
abilities by equal laws for all.
The second of these tendencies will be
particularly marked when there takes place a
positive mutation of the balance of power
within the community, the frequent outcome
of certain historical conditions. In such cases
the laws may gradually be adjusted to the
changed conditions or (as more usually
ensues) the ruling class is loath to reckon
with the new developments, the result being
insurrections and civil wars, a period when
law is in abeyance and force once more the
arbiter, followed by a new regime of law.
There is another factor of constitutional
change, which operates in a wholly pacific
manner, viz: the cultural evolution of the
mass of the community; this factor, however,
is of a different order and can only be dealt
with later.
A supreme authority
Thus we see that, even within the group itself,
the exercise of violence cannot be avoided
when conflicting interests are at stake. But the
common needs and habits of men who live in
fellowship under the same sky favour a
speedy issue of such conflicts and, this being
so, the possibilities of peaceful solutions make
steady progress. Yet the most casual glance at
world history will show an unending series of
conflicts between one community and
another or a group of others, between large
and smaller units, between cities, countries,
races, tribes and kingdoms, almost all of
which were settled by the ordeal of war. Such
wars end either in pillage or in conquest and
its fruits, the downfall of the loser.
No single all-embracing judgement can be
passed on these wars of aggrandisement.
Some, like the war between the Mongols and
the Turks, have led to unmitigated misery;
others, however, have furthered the transition
from violence to law, since they brought
larger units into being, within whose limits a
recourse to violence was banned and a new
regime determined all disputes. Thus the
Roman conquests brought that boon, the
pax Romana, to the Mediterranean lands.
The French kings' lust for aggrandisement
created a new France, flourishing in peace
and unity. Paradoxical as it sounds, we must
admit that warfare well might serve to pave
the way to that unbroken peace we so desire,
for it is war that brings vast units into being,
within whose frontiers all warfare is pro¬
scribed by a strong central power. In practice,

however, this end is not attained, for as a rule
the fruits of victory are but short-lived, the
newly-created unit falls asunder once again,
generally because there can be no true cohe¬
sion between the parts that violence has
welded. Hitherto, moreover, such conquests
have only led to aggregations which, for all
their magnitude, had limits, and disputes
between these units could be resolved only by
recourse to arms. For humanity at large the
sole result of all these military enterprises
was that, instead of frequent not to say inces¬
sant little wars, they had now to face great
wars which, for all they came less often, were
so much the more destructive.
Regarding the world of today, the same
conclusion holds good, and you, too, have
reached it, though by a shorter path. There is
but one sure way of ending war and that is the
establishment, by common consent, of a cen¬
tral control which shall have the last word in
every conflict of interests. For this, two things
are needed: first, the creation of such a
supreme court of judicature; secondly, its
investment with adequate executive force.
Unless this second requirement be fulfilled,
the first is unavailing. Obviously the League
of Nations, acting as a Supreme Court, fulfils
the first condition; it does not fulfil the
second. It has no force at its disposal and can
only get it if the members of the new body, its
constituent nations, furnish it. And, as things
are, this is a forlorn hope.
Still, we should be taking a very short¬
sighted view of the League of Nations were
we to ignore the fact that here is an experi-

ment the like of which has rarely been
attempted in the course of history, and never
before on such a scale. It is an attempt to
acquire the authority (in other words, coer¬
cive influence), which hitherto reposed exclu¬
sively on the possession of power, by calling
into play certain idealistic attitudes of mind.
We have seen that there are two factors of
cohesion in a community: violent compul¬
sions and ties of sentiment ("identifications",
in technical parlance) between the members
of the group. If one of these factors becomes
inoperative, the other may still suffice to hold
the group together. Obviously such notions
as these can only be significant when they are
the expression of a deeply rooted sense of
unity, shared by all. It is necessary, there¬
fore, to gauge the efficacy of such sentiments.
History tells us that, on occasion, they have
been effective. For example, the Panhellenic
conception, the Greeks' awareness of supe¬
riority over their barbarian neighbours, which
found expression in the Amphictyonies, the
Oracles and Games, was strong enough to
humanize the methods of warfare as between
Greeks, though inevitably it failed to pre¬
vent conflicts between different elements of
the Hellenic race or even to deter a city or
group of cities from joining forces with their
racial foe, the Persians, for the discomfiture
of a rival. The solidarity of Christendom in
the Renaissance age was no more effective,
despite its vast authority, in hindering
Christian nations, large and small alike, from
calling in the Sultan to their aid. And, in our
times, we look in vain for some such uni¬
fying notion whose authority would be
unquestioned. It is all too clear that the
nationalistic ideas, paramount today in every
country, operate in quite a contrary direction.
Some there are who hold that the Bolshevist
conceptions may make an end of war, but, as
things are, that goal lies very far away and,
perhaps, could only be attained after a spell of
brutal internecine warfare. Thus it would
seem that any effort to replace brute force by
the might of an ideal is, under present con¬
ditions, doomed to fail. Our logic is at fault

SYLVIE NERSON ROUSSEAU
is a French psychoanalyst.
She ¡s a consultant to a
number of public health
organizations and is
engaged in the education of
doctors and social workers
concerned with seropositive
and Aids-infected
persons. She is the author
of a number of articles on
psychoanalysis and
modern life.
TO become individuals in the fullest sense,
we must accept an inescapable obligation:
to respect that which is human in our¬
selves.
We each of us accept this "price that must
be paid" in our own way, according to priori¬
ties fixed by our own imagination. For one
person the priorities will be of a legal order it
will be important for that person to feel that he
or she is a possessor of rights. For someone
else the main thing will be to feel that he or she
belongs to a group or has a task to accom¬
plish this person will see himself or herself
above all as a "social actor". Another person
may feel that the concepts of integrity and
potentiality are essential he or she will regard
himself or herself primarily as an individual.
For the psychoanalyst, one of the aims of
treatment is to induce the patient to escape
from the grip of what might be called "narcis¬
sistic manicheanism" a self-image that is
either totally good or totally bad. From the
time when we learn to speak we are obliged to
master our impulses in order to serve the ideals
of our community. Hence the ambivalence of
our condition as creatures who are not good or
bad, but good and bad, since our impulses
(unless they are sublimated) are a priori
opposed to these ideals.
At another level, that of the ethnic, religious,
social or national community, this division
between good and bad still persists, in spite of
the so-called "collapse" of ideologies, in spite of
geopolitical changes that might be expected to
modify the images peoples have of each other.
For Europe the cultural cradle of psycho¬
analysis the spectre of evil that came from the
east has changed, but there as elsewhere evil
is still perceived as something that originates in
others. Nothing seems capable of shaking
people's conviction that what is bad comes from
outside them. However, it is through encoun¬
tering within ourselves the other side of our
idealized or dethroned image that we
become capable of empathy with others.
Psychoanalysis sheds an impartial light on
the human psyche. It does not seek to judge,
only to define the unconscious mechanisms
that govern our acts and our thoughts. This
form of understanding of the human mind
gives rise to the conception of an innate
equality, since a priori it situates each indi¬
vidual in an identical position in relation to the
real, the imaginary and the symbolic a posi¬
tion that is only modified by the unique fea¬
tures of each case history. This idea of inherent
equality is a fundamental link between psy¬
choanalysis on the one hand and democratic
ethics and thought on the other. At a sec¬
ondary level, historic, social and cultural
events transform this generic equality into
equality of opportunities or rights.
No society from Japan to Africa, from
Canada to Israel, from Lebanon to the
stripling Commonwealth of Independent
States is today unaware of the unconscious
mind, which in one way or another, albeit in
some cases still only indirectly, forms an inte¬
gral part of any vision of humankind. Perhaps
it could even be said that the notion of the
unconscious as a central component of the
human mind has played a role in the criticisms
that have been levelled at certain ways of
thinking about society. In Canada, for
example, Christianity long took the fact that
psychoanalysis stressed the predominance of
sexual tendencies as a pretext for strengthening
its own prohibitions. The example of the
former USSR, another place where psycho¬
analysis did not flourish, also shows the extent
to which psychoanalysis is regarded as a hos¬
tile force by regimes whose ideology is based
on a denial of individuality and its subjective
components.
In addition to its therapeutic effects, psy¬
choanalysis encourages the emergence of funda¬
mental values such as tolerance and respect for
historical truth, since experience of it enables
those who take part to discover what makes
them unique as persons, and to realize the
uniqueness of others without feeling threatened.
If the preoccupation with good or bad
becomes obsolete, is there not a possibility or
a danger depending on one's viewpoint that
differences will no longer be sufficient to jus¬
tify inequalities within a community, that the
forces of opposition within the community will
cease to be radical and become more gradual-
istic, thereby liberating antagonisms which
need to find expression.
Certainly recognition of the unconscious as
an essential factor in determining human
behaviour cannot serve entrenched positions.
Psychoanalysis is not about truth; it is one
pathway to human subjectivity. Perhaps too in
the post-modern era, it can maintain a tension
between emotion and reason, between the sub¬
jective point of view and aspirations to absolute
objectivity.

Freud and Freudianism
by Imques Hassoun

Above, a postcard dating
from 1908 shows Vienna's
Opera House and the
Ringstrasse, symbols of the
ambitious urban planning
and the liberal culture that
distinguished the city in the
19th century.
Opposite page, Portrait of
Emilie Flöge, a 1902 work
by the Austrian master of
Art Nouveau, Gustav Klimt.
IF, at the end of the last century, the Czarist
empire seemed like a prison camp for ethnic
groups, the Austro-Hungarian empire, like
the Ottoman empire, was more of a patchwork
quilt. In it Ruthenians, Bukovinians, Magyars,
Slovenes, northern Italians, Jews, Germans,
Galicians, Czechs, Slovaks and Poles together
lived out the last decades of an institution that
remained splendid, if only in appearance. The
area that history was to christen Mitteleuropa
was to be the birthplace of the works of Musil
and Mach, of the Austrian Marxists, of Mahler
and Klimt, Schnitzler and Zweig, Arnold
Schönberg, Hugo van Hofmannsthal and Sig¬
mund Freud all of them destined in varying
degrees to influence the history of ideas in the
twentieth century.
Overshadowed by Stalinism in the east,
their works destroyed by the Nazi regime in
the north, and accused of superficiality, of chal¬
lenging obvious facts and institutionalized con¬
ventions, sometimes even of sensualist obscu¬
rantism, these authors would be (at least for a
time) rejected much as the idea of the individual
was rejected the latter being central to a cul
ture in which subversion and ridicule played a
bigger part than rebellion or destruction.
What now seems remarkable is that this
society, imbued as it was with religious and
social prejudices which many people (such as
Mahler), adopted, sometimes (like Otto
Weininger) to the point of lunacy should have
managed to produce work of this kind. The
work was surely the product of contacts that
were not so much haphazard as the result of
tensions inherent in that society. Each ethnic
group seems to have contained tensions of its
own that condemned it to follow where they
led but also to encounter the other groups at a
crossroads that was the birthplace of an extra¬
ordinary culture.
In such circumstances the idea of the indi¬
vidual was bound to come to the fore: indeed,
individualism was to modulate the notion of
an egalitarian cohabitation of ethnic groups (in
which some were evidently more equal than
others). But if we may regard individualism as
the keystone of the Mitteleuropa culture, it
was a stone which, far from affording a fixed
and stable base, seems to have been balanced

on one corner, allowing it to move about and
rotate, and in so doing to give exceptional
coherence and quality to the whole structure.
So this culture (whose death-knell was
sounded by the Anschluss of 1938) could not
claim to emanate exclusively from any one of
its components, and no one of them could
claim exclusive paternity of it. It was in the
context of this conjunction that Freud gradu¬
ally built up his theory of psychoanalysis.
FREUD'S FIRST CASE
The question that faced Freud at the outset was
one that runs throughout Viennese literature
and at the same time presented medicine with
an insoluble problem, namely that of the hys¬
terical person and his or her isolation. All
things considered, it should come as no sur¬
prise that "Anna O." (Freud's first case) was
actually the celebrated Bertha Pappenheim, one
of the earliest German welfare workers, a
woman who devoted her life to rescuing Jewish
prostitutes abducted from their east European
families to stock the brothels of the Ottoman
Empire. Anna O. was an example of a socially
uprooted woman experiencing the shock of
new-found freedom a shock aggravated by
symptoms in whose presence medicine had to
confess its impotence. The state of mind of
hysterical patients is akin to the situation of
individualism under the stress of modernity, in
which individuals oscillate between the depths
of isolation and involvement in society.
Perhaps it was significant that Ernst Mach,
one of Freud's contemporaries, should have
said that the subject is "the ephemeral resultant
of the interrelationship between complexes of
sensations", "made permanent by memory and
habit", but continually changed by experience.
This is not the transcendental subject of Kant
or the concept of the self once so dear to psy¬
chologists, teachers and ideologists of good
manners. It is also significant that. another con¬
temporary, Arthur Schnitzler, a keen admirer of
Freud, should have raised the question of hys¬
terical personalities throughout his writings.
For evidence we need go no further than
Schnitzler's Fräulein Else in which, during a
long inner monologue played out on the
shadowy borders of subjectivity, Else wastes
away and dies through her inability to under¬
stand and come to terms with reality.
To go further than the medical and psycho¬
logical thinking of his time, Freud had to take
seriously the individuality of the patients who
came to him for psychoanalysis. He refused to
see the self as a stable, predictable force capable
of being moulded by teaching, and wrote that
there are some professions that always fail in
their aims, such as teaching, tutoring, parenting
and of course psychoanalysis, thereby indi¬
cating that the person at the receiving end will
always elude the good intentions which these
figures of authority seek to develop with
respect to the Self. 11

JACQUES HASSOUN,
an Egyptian-born French
psychoanalyst, is a founder
member of the Paris Cercle
Freudien and a member of
the Société des Gens de
Lettres de France. Among
his recent publications are
Les passions intraitables
(Aubier, Paris, 1989), Non-
lieu de la mémoire la
cassure d'Auschwitz (with M.
Nathan-Murat and A.
Radzynski; Bibliophane,
Paris, 1990) and L'histoire à
la lettre (Mentha, Paris,
1991).
Picking his way through the pitfalls of
transference, Freud was to turn his attention to
the unconscious desires of subjects under the
stress of their fantasies and wishes and the ups
and downs of childhoods subjected to the
mechanisms of repression.
BEYOND THE FATHER
Three main stages can be discerned in Freud's
universalization of the concepts revealed by his
experience as an analyst.
The first is represented by the studies of
hysteria and the science of dreams. Freud
started from what his patients told him about
their questioning, their slips of the tongue,
their abortive acts and the difficulties they
experienced in living their lives. Starting from
the study of these puzzles, which he regarded
as coded hieroglyphs for desires, Freud sought
to fit all these odd case-histories into the gen¬
eral theory he wished to develop.
The second stage is the one in which Freud,
in On Narcissism: an Introduction, Mourning
and Melancholia and Beyond the Pleasure Prin¬
ciple (as also in Group Psychology and the
Analysis of the Ego and The Psychopathology of
Everyday Life), raised the question of the sub¬
ject and his or her "destiny". For him this des¬
tiny was nothing more than a transformation of
the child's parental figures. At the time when a
child's image is created, when it arouses fascina¬
tion and later when subjectivization occurs,
when the child escapes the meshes of maternal
desire, the most basic element of its personality
is laid down, and that is an unconscious aware¬
ness of death. This idea had been put forward
by philosophers of classical Greece, and had
been used and abused by the Romantics it
illustrates how Greek mythology and German
Romanticism both form part of the genealogy
of psychoanalysis. But Freud sought to go fur¬
ther. The idea he proposed was that erotic
instincts are intermingled with the death
instinct via what he called "repetition-compul¬
sion" a term he used to describe what he
believed to be an innate tendency to revert to
earlier conditions.
The death instinct is supposedly a human
attribute: and hence it operates in the subject
not as the opposite of life, nor as a destructive
impulse, but precisely as a repetition-compul¬
sion. In this perspective, neurotic illness may
be a manifestation of what tends to counter the
workings of this instinct. The subject, trapped
in repetitive mechanisms, always tends to
return to the beaten track, being unable to
innovate, as Freud put it::", for fear of coming
up against the proposition that "It seems as
though the essence of success was to have got
further than one's father, and as though to excel
one's father was still something forbidden".
One particular form of neurotic activity is a
tendency to repeat in order to transmit, which
overlooks the fact that transmission always pre¬
supposes an element of loss. After all, transmit¬
ting means that people put to work what they

have inherited and what they have to pass on to
succeeding generations in the certainty that it
will be modified a fact that proves that there
is something alive at work that goes beyond a
mere pious tendency towards tautological
reproduction. Wanting to receive a cultural
legacy intact so as to transmit it completely
unchanged is surely the problem that afflicts
people under the tyrannical sway of idealiza¬
tion. Is this not what religion requires of us,
and what political authority demands?
At all events, this is what Freud maintains,
and it can be stated as follows: the focal point of
psychoanalytical enquiry is the singularity of the
individual mind. His theoretical propositions
consequently represent in their entirety a break
with a totalistic conception of the collective.
The third and last stage in Freud's develop¬
ment is the one spelled out in Moses and
Monotheism. By this time the father had
become for Freud the product of conjectures
and hypotheses. It is impossible to divorce his
tendency to think in terms of symbols from
the situation of actual and emotional exile in
which Freud found himself during the years of
the Nazi pestilence, and which one could also
compare to what the subject experiences in
psychoanalysis: inner exile, separation, divi¬
sion in short, all the things we ascribe to the
process known as individuation.

HOW far is science a product of the collec¬
tive expectation of its time? To what
extent does it foreshadow and express
the quintessence of a given moment of his¬
tory? Freud certainly was a man of his time.
He invented the human science that his epoch,
which had been convulsed by the Industrial
Revolution, was waiting for. He even antici¬
pated a need that had yet to make itself felt
the need to return human beings to the centre
of history and to the centre of their own selves
at a time when they were being made to feel
increasingly bewildered and irrelevant by the
technology they had created.
THE BIRTH OF PSYCHOANALYSIS
The concept of the unconscious was already in
the air at the time when Freud created psycho¬
analysis. But he was the man who brilliantly
exploited the idea, which until then had made
little headway beyond a closed circle of avant-
garde intellectuals and enthusiasts. Generally
speaking, the human sciences were then held in
low esteem. They aroused suspicions and
awakened old fears, justifiably, since they dealt
two massive blows to the self-image of the
generation that matured around the turn of the
century. The first blow fell in 1871 when
Charles Darwin published The Descent of
Man. Man was the species that had conquered
the world, that had produced Copernicus and
Galileo and the great minds of the Enlighten¬
ment, not to mention the many eminent scien¬
tists who appeared on the scene in the nine¬
teenth century. How could he be descended
from monkeys? It came as little consolation to
learn soon afterwards that the great apes were
not so much our fathers as our cousins.
Freud himself delivered the second blow
when he drew attention to the fact that homo
sapiens sapiens (man doubly-wise) had an
unconscious, and so could not even be consid¬
ered to possess self-mastery. Despite the resis¬
tance the idea aroused, Freud soon attracted
disciples. Carl Gustav Jung, Karl Abraham,
Ernest Jones, Sandor Ferenczi, Melanie Klein
and Otto Rank all joined his circle.
Freud launched humanity on a journey of
inner exploration that matched the contempo¬
rary discovery of the external world. At the
start of the new century, explorers were probing
virgin forests and frozen wastes, climbing the
highest summits and plumbing the depths of
the ocean. Edouard Branly was pioneering

techniques of long-distance communication;
Louis Blériot was embarking on the conquest
of the skies; Henry Ford was industrializing the
manufacture of automobiles.
Although psychoanalysis was at first
restricted to a small intellectual elite, it soon
started to affect a widening circle of people.
The first psychoanalytical society was founded
in Vienna, and the second in St. Petersburg, in
1906. Like other forms of associative activity,
the new discipline soon developed internal
conflicts, the first being that between Freud
and Jung, who in 1913 introduced new con¬
cepts derived from his studies of different cul¬
tures and from his clinical experience of psy¬
chosis. Jung's most important innovations

cardboard, 1933), by the

were the idea of the collective unconscious as
the common ground of humanity reflected in
every individual, and the notion of archetypes
giving rise to shared symbolic images.
The rise of Nazism and the Second World
War shifted the focus of psychoanalysis to
London and the English school. D.W. Winni-
cott, a paediatrician as well as an analyst, was
reputedly consulted by no less than 60,000
mothers and children in the course of a medical
career that ended only with his death. His
lengthy clinical experience with children
enabled him to bring fresh insights to a branch
of psychoanalysis that had already been firmly
established by Anna Freud and Melanie Klein.

H. A. Rosenfeld and others have extended the
scope of psychoanalysis, which had been
employed by Freud only for the treatment of
neurosis, to that of psychosis also.
In France the psychoanalytical world has
been divided by repeated schisms, the most
important of which was brought about by
Jacques Lacan. But a particularly influential
figure there in recent years has undoubtedly
been Françoise Dolto, a psychoanalyst of chil¬
dren. It is by no means fortuitous that she
should have become a public figure, since it
had become high time to realize that the future
of society rests on the health of its young.
In less than a century, psychoanalysis has
had to contend with the racist and totalitarian
ideology of Nazism, as well as with Marxism-
Leninism, the most influential collectivist phi¬
losophy of all time. It was rejected by both, for
neither was prepared to permit the individual
to escape the net of its communal aims. Liberal
society, on the other hand, has proved rela¬
tively fertile ground, turning psychoanalysis
into an almost commonplace consumer
product. At one time in the United States,
almost everyone consulted a "shrink" at some
point in their lives. But that raised a problem:
how was a science devoted to the individual's
search for him- or herself, for what Jung called
individuation, to accommodate the demands
of the growing number of men, women and
children ready for its services?
PSYCHOANALYSIS
AND SOCIETY
Today, psychoanalysis plays three principal
social roles. It performs a clinical role that is
indispensable if it is both to meet the growing
needs of individuals and to maintain the exper¬
imental tradition needed to improve our
understanding of the human mind. It has a cul¬
tural function. Itself influenced from its early
days by ethnology and mythology, it has in
turn enriched all the human sciences, from
philosophy, psychology and the study of
teaching methods to ethnology, anthropology
and sociology.
Finally, it has an exploratory side. It too
must continually refer to the other sciences so
as not to become imprisoned in a theoretical
framework that would soon become arid and
ossified if it were not constantly put to the
test. The most innovatory currents in psycho¬
analysis today draw on animal ethology,
embryology and physics, whose laws can be
verified at every level of the organization of
matter, however complex this may be in the
case of the human mind.
Psychoanalysis is concerned with the indi¬
vidual and nothing else. It thereby respects the
principle of liberty and distances itself both
from certain psychiatric methods that have
been used in totalitarian countries to neutralize
freedom of thought and from such neurolog¬
ical procedures as electric shock treatment and
other therapeutic systems and the manipula¬
tory situations to which they have given rise.
From a psychoanalytical perspective, the
great threat to society today lies at the very
moment of birth. Reinforced by the power that
intensive care techniques now give them, doc¬
tors in general and obstetricians in particular
are in danger of forgetting that a new-born
baby has no real existence without its mother,
since it cannot achieve the status of an indepen¬
dent human being on its own, and that frequent
separation at too early an age can cause it more
harm even than physical infirmity.
Psychoanalysis has now acquired a body of
experimental knowledge that makes it possible
to define the periods and rhythms necessary for
the healthy development of the individual in the
first years of life. Animals know how to respect
the gestation periods that are indispensable to
the survival of their young. Guided by instinct,
mother animals know how to maintain the
rhythms proper to their species and to protect
their babies from the dangers around them.
Human mothers, however, face the threat of
losing their instincts and their protective
maternal role unless they are given support.
The modern world expects babies to per¬
form substantially beyond their capacities,
both physically and mentally. From the
moment of birth onwards, they are too often
treated like objects rather than beings with
special needs, and are forced to undergo
repeated trials by separation that they cannot
survive without damage to their health. The
number of cases of infant psychosis is
increasing, and so is the incidence of autism.
Men and women are social beings and,
paradoxical though it may seem, the process of
socialization has its roots in successfully coping
with separation. The most important task
facing psychoanalysis today is to show, by
warning and instruction, how the process of
separation, set in motion at birth and continued
first through weaning and then adolescence,
can best be weathered through respecting chil¬
dren's essential needs. Only by respecting the
needs of its children can modern society attain
the degree of civilization to which it aspires.

HOW tO Say T by lime Amaáo lévy-Metisi
We must learn
to say T
in the first
person in a
profound
sense.
Kierkegaard
The Quest (acrylic, 1990)
by the French artist Sylvie
Sémavoine.
* In From the History ofan
Infantile Neurosis (1918).
THE neurotic's confusion with respect to
relationships has been neatly summed up
by Jacques Lacan and Françoise Dolto in
these two phrases: "Who is speaking to
whom?" and "At the start of an analysis, it is
not the neurotic who is speaking, and he is not
speaking to the analyst." The situation could be
described as one of multiple neurosis. Neu¬
rotics are a channel and a blocked channel at
that for fantasies which are initially not so
much of their own making as socio-culturally
determined. Their self is made up of various ill-
coordinated vectors built in to the conflicts that
eventually led them to enter analysis. Neuroses
never occur in the singular. There is, rather, a
nexus of intertwining patterns in which various
individualities can be discerned. These individ¬
ualities may be artificially linked or separated.
The significance of each intersects with that of
all the others without really shedding light on
them; indeed, through an infinite process of
interpénétration they may sometimes even
conceal one another. In such cases the neurotic
material may be likened to a riddle. Freud him¬
self compared dreams to riddles; and before
him the Talmud had stated that a dream not
interpreted is a letter left unread.
THE EMERGENCE OF THE SELF
The neurotic message is a coalition of different
elements. Patients, unaware of this multi¬
plicity, cannot separate the parts. Eugène
Minkowski cites a schizophrenic who was in
the habit of referring to himself in the third
person, but he was an extreme case. Ordinary
neurotics conjugate verbs correctly. They
learned language in the usual way, with "me",
then "I", being used to. replace the first name
very early on. On the face of it at least, neu¬
rotics are grammatically normal.
However, their individuality is disguised by
the masks of their desire to be someone else.
During a model course of treatment, the self
will travel back to earlier states of mind and
rediscover the moment when its future devel¬
opment was set, perhaps even precisely enough
to put a date to it. Sometimes, as in the case of
the Wolf Man described by Freud, ::" the
symptom relates to an incident that occurred in
the individual's prehistory, before the develop¬
ment of memory. The patient's individuality
will only emerge after his or her history has
been pieced together and he or she has accepted
that history. The patient will then no longer use
the word "I" in a stereotyped sense, as though
it referred to someone else. Instead, uttering it
will incorporate an acceptance of his or her
stages of development, even including their
ambivalence.
But there is no straightforward fairy-tale
happy end, with people getting married and
having lots of children. The degree of success
or failure achieved by psychoanalytical treat¬
ment can vary widely. The term "post-analyt¬
ical Parkinson's disease" has been coined to
describe the renewed tension that some
patients experience once they have emerged
(or think they have emerged) from their mul¬
tiple neuroses. They look singularly strange in
their new clothes. Perhaps they were right to
fear this fresh apparel, like Diderot lamenting
the loss of his old dressing gown, or like
Kierkegaard trying to establish what Repeti¬
tion may be, somewhere between memory and
hope: "Hope is a brand-new piece of clothing,
stiff and uncomfortable; but as one has never
worn it before one does not know if it will fit,
or suit one." Kierkegaard felt that people only
really feel at ease with repetition, "a garment
that never wears out", ancf is "neither too tight
nor too loose."
The pitfall awaiting those emerging from a
more or less successful course of psychoanalyt¬
ical treatment and the results always fall into 17

including La névrose plurielle
(Aubier, Paris, 1992).
the category of "more or less" is to believe
that their individuality has been made to
emerge, cleansed of its previous phantasms like
a well-scoured saucepan. The emergence of
individuality is not an illusion, but it may
become one if it is treated as a kind of object,
encysted within its defining parameters and
alienated on the threshold of liberation.
Anyone who uses the word "emergence"
should not concentrate on what has "emerged"
but try to restore to the resultant mental states
the momentum that brought them to the sur¬
face. Karl Jaspers said that everything hinged
on the "sum of time" understood in the fullness
of its three terms: past, present and future.
THE CULTURAL CONTEXT
But while the emergence of individuality can
be grasped within the prism of psychoanalysis,
it also owes a great deal to ethics, religion, the
economy and social and political integration.
Psychoanalysis must not be reductive, not
become the exclusive dogma it has so often
been accused of being. No one theme should
be stressed above the others when all are
involved in the emergence. The individuality
that emerges entails even demands a multi-
disciplinary approach, which is constantly
shifting and can at best only be (no pun
intended) approached rather than arrived at
with any degree of finality. The psychoanalyt¬
ical process differs qualitatively and quantita¬
tively in each individual case-history.
That is very obvious in Israel, where an
immigrant from Ethiopia cannot be analysed
in the same way as an elderly patient of
Russian origin. In France too, a psychoanalyst
cannot use the same language to young
workers that he or she would use with stu¬
dents (as I discovered in one of my most mem¬
orable professional encounters). In each case
individuality takes a very different path towards
its own reality. I remember being very struck, at
a psychoanalytical symposium on reality, by the
evanescent, elusive quality of reality. My feeling
is that reality is not a state that can be described,
or a series of states that can be recorded, so
much as something that, to borrow a Hebrew
saying as old as Genesis itself, is always in the
making. In this sense, the emergence of individ¬
uality is an action plan, a project, the taking in
hand of a story whose aim is the winning of its
own freedom, which alone can redeem it. It is a
time that has to be set in motion once more.
"The wind is rising, we must try to live,"
wrote Valéry in Le Cimetière Marin. But such
an attempt implies the mobilization of all the
agencies that make us up. Viktor Frankl, who
accepted Freud's discoveries in their entirety,
rightly added other dimensions to them in his
book The Unconscious God: psychotherapy
and theology in which he superimposed on the
repressed instinctual impulses of Freudian
theory the repressed impulses of the spiritual,
which are equally necessary to the emergence
and fulfilment of the individual. The relative
importance of one or other form of repression
will vary in different cases at different stages of
treatment to create an infinite number of com¬
binations, with every possible form of stop
and start along the way.
Perhaps the world of politics provides an
example of these stops ana starts. The message
lies in receptiveness to other people, always
granted that receptiveness is not unconditional.
Ultimately, relating is the important thing.
RELATIONS

conclusions) without looking again at the "I"

which is constructed in childhood, and which
needs to be conjugated in the first person "in a
profound sense". If one did no more than say
"I", the result would be the emergence of a nar¬
cissistic, even autistic, individuality. The dia¬
logues of the deaf that ensue are striking evi¬
dence of this on the cultural level. In fact the
emergence has no meaning except in terms of
relationships with others. To say "I" to oneself
in a profound sense entails bringing together all
the persons involved: the "He", even when
absent, the "We" of latent solidarity and, most
fundamentally, the "Thou" which reveals me to
myself.
Perhaps Martin Buber's book I and Thou is
relevant here. The world, Buber writes, is not a
divine game, but a divine destiny. Pure rela¬
tionships generate absolute. dependency and
the fulfilment of a freedom which, by bringing
together creator and created, provides a foun¬
dation for humankind's creativity by associ¬
ating it indissolubly with love. Buber locates
human relationships the I and the Thou in
the transcendence of all that pertains to them.
He is even prepared to state that we have
always known we needed God, but that "God
needs you to give your life its meaning specifi¬
cally through your agency."
Conditioned as we are by all the factors that
make up a culture, or alienated by some of
them and by all the wrong choices and repres¬
sions they entail, we can see that psycho¬
analysis is an astonishing key with which to
open sealed doors. But there are a hundred
other doors to the magic palace that shelters the
newly-emerged, or new-born, individual iden¬
tity. Those who think they have arrived after
going through the first door are mistaken.

The Ajase complex
by ¡tienne Banal
o
Morning gymnastics in a
Hokkaido bottling plant
(Japan).
ERU kugiwa utareru," or "One should
knock in any nail that sticks out," is a
common Japanese saying. The metaphor
is symptomatic of the national approach to edu¬
cation. Japanese children are brought up not to
rock the boat, not to be different from their
neighbours and to conform with other mem¬
bers of the group. It is difficult to talk of the
emergence of the individual when principles of
this kind are firmly rooted in the national
mentality.
When asked about this, Dr. Tooru Taka-
hashi, a psychiatrist at Japan's National Mental
Health Research Institute, first puts the indi¬
vidual in context: "Even from a purely gram¬
matical point of view, the Japanese language
allows people a choice between several types
of T. The T they decide to use depends on the
person or persons they are talking to. The
individual constantly has to redefine his or her
identity depending on who is being
addressed a superior, a work colleague, or a
member of the family." The mental gymnastics
the Japanese practise in their relationships with
other people provide one clue as to why they
tend to see themselves less as well-defined
individals than as persons capable of adjusting
to their environment. Their ability to adjust
arises, according to psychiatrist Takeo Doi,
from their wish to avoid conflict with people
around them, and thus to be treated indul¬
gently, as a child is by its mother.
THE AJASE COMPLEX
In his book Anatomy of Dependence', Takeo
Doi describes the bond of emotional depen¬
dence amae which in his view greatly influ¬
ences the way in which the Japanese personality
is formed. In a matriarchal society in which the
father occupies a very limited place, the rela¬
tionship with the mother determines a person's
psychological development and his or her rela¬
tions with society. Whereas Western psychoan¬
alytical thinking emphasizes the "castrating"

role of the father in breaking into what would
otherwise remain a hermetic fusional relation¬
ship between mother and child, Japanese psy¬
chiatry starts off with an acceptance of this
mother-child dyad, which was described by
the first Japanese psychiatrist, Dr. Kosawa, as
the "Ajase complex". (Ajase was a king in
Buddhist mythology who wanted to kill his
mother.)
When he used the psychoanalytical tech¬
nique of free association on his patients, Dr.
Kosawa discovered that their fantasies did not

Freud in Vienna in 1932. What emerged,
rather, was an Ajase complex. "It is a guilt
feeling towards the mother in a relationship of
dependence, a feeling you experience after
obtaining her forgiveness despite the fact that
you have tried to kill her in order to satisfy
your hostile wishes," says Dr. Takahashi,
echoing Takeo Doi's work on amae.
"The archetypal relationship involving
amae is that between mother and child, but
this archetype also structures the relationship
between husband and wife, teacher and pupil, 21

and doctor and patient," writes Yves Pelicier, a
French specialist, in a preface to a French
translation of Doi's book. "There is never any
question of equality. The relationship is asym¬
metrical, which means that it presupposes
respect and offers in return the definition of a
certain reassuring position or status in the rela¬
tionship system." What the child, and later the
adult, seeks in amae is not the independence of
the "individual" as it is envisioned in the West,
but a relationship of ideal dependence that will
earn him or her the indulgence of the mother,
then of the group.
"Amae is normally what a child feels in
relation to its mother when it becomes capable
of realizing that she can separate from it," Doi
says. But while that feeling indicates both a
request for the presence of the mother and a
negation of separation from her, it is some¬
thing that is found throughout adult life in a
culture which regards the individual, or "I", as
important only in his or her relationship with
other people. Amae is the wish to restore a lost
unity by going out to meet other people.
"The purpose of analysis," Dr. Takahashi
adds, "is to grasp the subject's individuality.
But the Japanese accept, and even tend to
emphasize, the ambiguity of their T, which is
determined by other people. The analysand
does not seek individual independence, which
would run counter to the very principles of the
way human relationships work"2.
As for his own patients, Dr. Takahashi
finds they chiefly suffer from behaviour prob¬
lems within groups: "There are two main
problems facing my patients: either they tend
to deny their individuality completely so as to
merge more successfully into the group, or
they react against the group to an excessive
degree by overasserting their individuality."
The bond between the individual and the
mother is of the same type as that between the
individual and the group: it is a bond based
more on the emotions than on reason. As long
as this relationship is an emotional one, the
individual can seek the indulgence of the
group in order to achieve his or her aims. This
is why it is important not to create open con¬
flicts, which would break up the harmony of
the group to the detriment of each individual's
interests.
THE THREE CIRCLES OF SOCIAL LIFE
The group is of prime importance because it
affects and conditions behaviour. But what
group, or groups, are we talking about? First
there is the circle of people to whom the indi¬
vidual is very close and needs to display no
restraint because he or she will always be
treated indulgently: this is the world of amae.
Then there is the circle of friends and col¬
leagues, which is dominated by the need for
compromise and the desire for harmonious
relations. A certain degree of restraint is
required in this circle, one in which individuals
become aware of their position within other
groups. This is the world of debt, obligation
and duty, of mutual favours and devotion, of
reciprocity, where emotional interaction must
achieve some kind of equilibrium and where
there may even be a feeling of understanding
similar to the amae of the first circle. But
anyone failing to observe the rules of this
second circle or betraying the trust of the
group, which is well-meaning but chiefly con¬
cerned with its own evolution, will incur dis¬
grace. The third and most distant circle is the
world of "other people", towards whom the
individual has no obligations or feelings, and
from whom he or she consequently expects
nothing. Neither their presence, nor what they
think, nor how they view the individual are of
any importance. That is why the Japanese
seem reserved in the presence of people they
do not know, or "strangers". These concentric
circles rarely overlap.
Dr. Takahashi also points out that people
who come for analysis are not interested in the
deeper causes of their neurosis, but simply want
the analyst to get rid of its symptoms. That is a
further indication of the way in which people

Floyd Elder, a Canadian expert
on acid rain, notes that the British
chemist Robert Angus Smith coined
the term more than a century ago.
Although the technology at Smith's
disposal was rudimentary by today's
standards, he demonstrated as early
as 1872 that smoke and steam con¬
tain substances that cause impor¬
tant changes in the chemical com¬
position of rain. He noted that these
changes could be detected not only
in the immediate area around the
point of emission but also "in the
fields, at a great distance from the
source." He also discovered some
of the harmful effects of acid rain,
such as the discolouring of fabrics,
the corrosion of metal surfaces, the
deterioration of building materials
and the withering ofplants.
Although the term "acid rain" is
evocative, it is often inappropriate:
"acid deposits" is more accurate.
Drifting air pollutants are deposited
not only by rainfall but also by snow,
clouds and fog (so-called "wet"
deposits), as well as by gases and
dust ("dry deposits") during the dry
season. Even normal rain is mildly
acidic, with a pH that varies
between 5.6 and 5.0. (Distilled water

Development fallout
Despite the early warning given by
Robert Smith, industrial countries
only began to take acid deposits
seriously in the 1950s. In 1953,
the Canadian Government launched
a programme to study and monitor
the water in the lakes ofNova Scotia,
where acidity was increasing at
an alarming rate. In the 1960s,
Scandinavian countries reported
that fish populations were declining
and that some lakes had even
become completely sterile. Trout

In lapan pollution was at its worst
afterWorld War II. Between 1946 and
1954, the need to rebuild the country,
feed the population and keep facto¬
ries working called for the use of fer¬
tilizers and pesticides, the extrac¬
tion of raw materials, the burning of
fossil fuels, and a dam construction
programme. lapan's number one pri¬
ority was to achieve a high level of
development. Pollution would be
attended to later.
Four tragic accidents, however,
caused the lapanese authorities to
take public-health and safety mea¬
sures. Two of the accidents at
Minamata and Niigata respectively
involved mercury poisoning; the
third was linked to cadmium and
the fourth to sulphur dioxide. The
last case occurred at a time when
coal and hydroelectric power were
beginning to be superseded by
petroleum and petrochemicals. A
huge industrial complex was built
at Yokkaichi, south ofTokyo. When it
went into production, local people
began to complain of unpleasant
odours, irritating fumes, and soot-
marks on their laundry. There was a
significant rise in the incidence of

asthma, and the phrase "Yokkaichi
asthma" was coined. In 1967, studies
identified sulphur dioxide released
from the smokestacks as the prin¬
cipal culprit. The victims took the
six companies involved to court and
won their case, gaining compensa¬
tion and focusing public attention
on the dangers of air pollution. In
the same year, the Idemitsu Kosan
refinery invested some ten billion
yen in a desulphurizing facility, the
first ofits kind in the world, designed
to remove sulphur from heavy oil
before it was burned, and the Tokyo
city authorities established a sulphur
dioxide monitoring station in front of
the former town hall. The public was
alerted whenever the readings
reached levels considered dangerous
to health this happened sixteen
times in 1968 alone.
The lapanese government
responded energetically. It set up
an Environment Agency and drew
up a strict regulatory system mod¬
eled on the Clean Air Act adopted
in the United States in 1970. How¬
ever, a recent assessment by the
agency points to the inadequacy of
all such controls. The higher the
level of a nation's development, the
more industries, vehicles, and
heating appliances it possesses and
the more pollution it produces.
Is this inevitable? In the United
States, the CleanAirAct was amended
and strengthened in 1990. The atmos¬
phere today contains 23 billion kg of
suspended particulates of lead, sul-

phur dioxide, carbon monoxide,
nitrogen oxide and other substances,
which means that every man,
woman and child inhales 112 kg of
particles a year. Economic incen¬
tives should make it possible to
reduce the figure by two thirds by
the year 2005. The U.S. Environ¬
mental Protection Agency counts
among its undisputed successes a
substantial reduction in the level of
toxic lead emissions since lead was
banned from automobile fuel.
Canada is concerned about the
winds blowing in from regions of
heavy industry across the border in
the United States. But foundries in
the mining district ofcentral Ontario
are also implicated. In the mid-
1980s, eastern Canada alone was
responsible for the emission of 4.6
million tonnes of sulphur dioxide.
Meteorological conditions only
make things worse. Heavy winter
snowfall traps acids for months. The
spring thaw frees a stream of acid
into rivers and lakes at the time when
aquatic fauna are reproducing,
causing sterility and embryo mal¬
formation. The forest is also affected;
maples and birch trees in eastern
Canada are dying.
In 1990, the United States pledged
to reduce sulphur dioxide emissions
by half. Canada is doing the same.
But modern society has a growing
demand for energy and industrial
goods. Individuals, companies and
communities must take stock of the
situation and work together to find
new and different consumption
patterns.

TRACKING INSECTS BY SATELLITE
In the countries of Africa's Sahel
region, it is vitally important to
keep watch for invasions of crickets
that can devastate the area's
meagre crops. The Paris-based
Centre for International Coopera¬
tion in Agricultural Research for
Development claims that remote
detection via Landsat, Météosat,
NOAA and SPOT satellites can
provide a monitoring system that
may be highly effective, although
the data must be subsequently
corroborated on the ground. In
1991 a 300-square-kilometre area
in the north of Niger was moni¬
tored. It took 80 hours of helicopter
flights, 30 hours of plane flights,
and 6,000 km of track covered to
provide 800 aerial photographs
and 300 field surveys. These data
were then compared with the
images provided by the satellites.
Once the invaders have been
located, of course, they still have to
be eliminated.

CROCODILES
IN THE BATHTUB
There is never a dull moment at the
Blohms'. For the past 40 years, they
have been doing their best to pro¬
tect one of the five most endangered
large reptile species in Venezuela,
the Orinoco crocodile (Crocodylus
intermedius), and their efforts have
included letting sick specimens use
the family bathroom to recuperate.
Hunting of this species coveted for
its skin and even for its teeth, which
according to local folklore have
medicinal properties, reduced a
population that numbered several
million at the beginning of the cen¬
tury to some 2,000 animals. Cecilia
and Tomas Blohm now breed
Orinoco crocodiles in concrete
tanks on their 2,500-hectare ranch
located in the state of Guarico. In
1992 they released 200 crocodiles
into the wild. If their enterprise suc¬
ceeds, it might be possible to raise
the crocodiles on a sustainable
basis, so providing a source ofpro¬
tein for the local people as well as
helping to save one of the world's
twelve most threatened animal
species from extinction.
CARDBOARD COFFINS
It can be argued that it is wasteful to fell trees in order
to manufacture coffins that may only be used for a
matter of hours. In view of the increasingly widespread
practice of cremation, Alexander Haas of Switzerland
has invented the "Peace Box", a cardboard coffin made
from materials that are 60-per-cent recycled. Even if this
ecologically-minded initiative has yet to catch on in a
big way, it certainly counts as an honourable attempt to
use materials "from the cradle to the grave".

CANADA RATIFIES THE WORLD CONVENTION
ON BIOLOGICAL DIVERSITY
Canada, which on 4 December ratified the Convention on Biological
Diversity signed at the Rio Earth Summit in June 1993, is one of the world's
biggest countries. The home of some 70,000 known animal species, it
comprises a host ofdistinct habitats. But a great many of these ecosystems
are imperilled. Little tallgrass land is left, while 103 animal species or sub¬
species are listed as threatened or in danger of extinction, and 20 are
extinct. Canada's Green Plan has established a national wildlife strategy
designed to protect endangered species and their habitats. A federal policy
on the conservation of wetlands adopted in March 1992 defined new
wildlife reserves and bird sanctuaries. By the year 2000, the government
should have established as many national parks as there are natural regions
(39 in all), covering 12 per cent of the country's surface area.

POLLUTION AND THE STOCK
EXCHANGE
As of this year, "clean" firms will be
selling "pollution permits" on the
Chicago stock exchange. This novel
system authorizes buying and
selling of the right to emit specific
amounts of sulphur dioxide, one of
the main sources of acid rain. A
company that has not used up its
maximum emission quota will be
allowed to sell the remainder to
others, for the highest bid or for a
fixed price. The United States
Environmental Protection Agency
(USERA) has declared its approval of
an initiative that will enable bene¬
ficiaries to avoid having to pay fines
or suspend operations.
With the development of biomass fuels derived from
sugar cane or rape seed, green is in fashion, even for
automotive fuels. Yet Pierre Delacroix, energy specialist
with the nongovernmental organization France Nature
Environnement, warns that neither the ethanol-gaso-
line mix used in Brazil nor diester, a fuel for diesel
engines currently being studied in Europe, are risk-
free. Ethanol by-products may be toxic, while diester
contains nitrogen oxide and carcinogenic aldehydes,
both hazards to health. Furthermore, as these fuels are
based on agricultural crops, production would be likely
to call for massive doses of fertilizers and pesticides,
without the restrictions on their use applied to food
crops. In trying to limit carbon dioxide emissions from
conventional fuels, might we not create new sources of
pollution?

river which rose in the distant moun¬
tains flowed through many lands before
it finally reached the desert sands. It
tried to overcome this new obstacle just
as it had surmounted all others in its
-path, but it noticed that as it flowed
through the sand, its waters disappeared.
It was sure that its destiny was to cross the
desert, but how? Then a hidden voice, a voice
from the desert, murmured: "The wind
crosses the desert. The river can do the same."
The river replied that when it rushed at the
sand it was soaked up, whereas the wind
could fly across the desert.
"Ifyou leap forward in your usual way, you
will not get across. You will only disappear, or
become a swamp. You must let the wind carry
you to your destination."
The river asked how that could be, and the
voice answered, "Let the wind absorb you."
The river found the idea unacceptable. It
had never before been absorbed. It did not
want to lose its individuality: once it had
given it up, how could it be sure to get it back?
"The wind takes care ofthat," said the sand.
"It absorbs the water, carries it over the desert,
then lets it fall. The water falls in the form of
rain and becomes a river anew."
"How do I know this is true?"
"That is how it is. And ifyou don't believe it,
you will never become anything but a marsh¬
land, and even that could take many years.
And that is certainly not the same thing as a
river!"
"But couldn't I remain the river I am today?"
"No matter what happens, you cannot
remain the same," murmured the voice. "The
essential part of you is carried off to form a
river anew. Even today, you have that name
because you do not know what part ofyou is
the essential part."
These words stirred distant recollections for
the river. It could vaguely remember a time
when the wind had carried it, or part of it at
least. It also remembered but was this really
a memory? that this was what it was meant
to do, even if there was no real need.
So the river evaporated into the welcoming
arms ofthe wind. And gently, effortlessly, the
wind raised it up and carried it off, letting it fall
gently in droplets when they reached a moun-
taintop many leagues away. And because it
had doubted, the river remembered and
absorbed all the more acutely the details of
the experience. "Yes, I now know my true
identity," said the river to itself.
The river was beginning to learn. But
the sands murmured: "We know because
we see this happen day after day and because
we sands stretch out from the river to the
mountain."
This is why they say that the ways that allow
the River of Life to pursue its journey are
written in the sand.

see themselves, which is not in relation to them¬
selves, but to the members of their immediate
circle, for whom an absence of symptoms
means an absence of disorders. A person with
no apparent symptoms runs no risk of being
rejected by the group, which is always very
concerned not to show any failings.
THE EYES OF OTHERS
In The Chrysanthemum and the Sword, which
appeared in 1946, the American sociologist
Ruth Benedict put her finger on the difference
between Judaeo-Christian culture, which is
based on guilt, and Japanese culture, which is
based on shame. Guilt feelings are generated by
reference to a given system of moral values, that
is to say the struggle between good and evil,
notions which are defined and identified as
such. Feelings of shame, on the other hand, are
produced by the way other people see us. Here
again it is the group which dictates a person's
behaviour. Takeo Doi comments on Benedict's
definition as follows: "Whereas guilt feelings,
after arising in the ego, travel outwards in the
form of an excuse, feelings of shame originate in
awareness of how other people see us and travel
inwards, towards the ego." Further on he adds:
"[The Japanese] love living as a group. It is
extremely difficult for them to dissociate them¬
selves from the group and act on their own ini¬
tiative. They somehow feel that to act indepen¬
dently is to betray. They are even ashamed to
do anything on their own."
Here again there is a parallel to be drawn
between the group, which a person feels
ashamed to disappoint or be excluded from,
and the mother. The sociologist Chie Nakane
wrote that a Japanese mother might punish her
child by letting it know symbolically that it no
longer belonged to the family, that it would
have to remain alone as it had not observed the
family rules, and that she was "putting the child
outside", whereas Western parents are more
likely to keep a child at home "in deten¬
tion" as punishment for being too indepen¬
dent-minded.
Given that the ultimate aim of analysis is the
process of individuation, it is easy to see why
the Western model of psychoanalysis has not
really caught on in Japan. As Dr. Takahashi
points out: "In Japanese society, the analyst as
well as the patient lacks the determination to
achieve personal independence. Psychoanalyt¬
ical treatment gives the patient the means to
break free from his or her primary dependence
and is therefore in contradiction with the gen¬
eral fabric of human relations in society. That is
why it has not yet really become an everyday
feature of Japanese life or been fully assimilated
by Japanese culture."

Africa:
the healer's
art
by Aime'Murie Kaufmani

PSYCHOANALYSIS is not a matter merely of
explaining or elucidating what is wrong
in people's relationships with their con¬
temporaries and those around them. It is also a
therapeutic procedure in which, for the psy¬
choanalyst, it is inconceivable to act against a
patient's wishes, and above all to know more
than the patient about his or her own case. The
psychoanalyst's ethics, in other words, are
based on a kind of renunciation of knowledge.
When a patient comes to seek help to enable
him or her to live a better life, the analyst
knows no more than the patient, but waits to
be enlightened by what he or she has to say.
The psychoanalyst's desire to know engenders
a similar desire in the patient: and this enables
the patient, rather than waiting for a recipe for
improvement, to dismantle the pathological
mechanisms at work in him or her in order to
alleviate the problems caused by his or her
relationship to reality. In short, psychoanalysis
is a theory which uses the patient's own words
to provide for this or that neurotic symptom
an explanation which is by definition indi¬
vidual and personal.
What first strikes a psychoanalyst in Africa
is the predominant place occupied by talking.
Traditional therapies there are all based on
something which contrary to the claims of
some European ethnopsychiatrists is not
mere verbal conditioning designed to make a
deviant subject conform to a codified social
norm, but a form of verbalization that takes
individual account of the patient's problem and
its cause.
Nevertheless there is an essential difference
between Africa and Europe. Illness in Africa is
due to an external force, the supernatural
intervention of a jinn, a zaar or a rah following
an offence committed against it or some other
deity. So before any treatment you have to
know which deity is concerned, what the
offence was, and how to make it good.

Many European psychiatrists think that
once a subject's symptoms have been identi¬
fied, all that has to be done is to recondition
him or her. Each symptom calls for an appro¬
priate medicinal treatment or a stay in an insti¬
tution which will put everything back to
rights. European psychiatrists with experience
of psychoanalysis are, like traditional African
healers, sceptical about this approach because
it bypasses the truth, the root cause concealed
within each patient, and merely papers over
the cracks which reopen at the first opportu¬
nity. Whenever we have talked to traditional
African practitioners and to Western psychia¬
trists, we have been struck by this emphasis on
uncovering the cause, on talking, which allows
a person's symbolic landmarks to be put back

in place and completely reorganized so as to
make him or her a place in society again.
CONSCIENTIOUS HEALERS
I shall give two examples of traditional African
therapy. The first concerns a Pygmy healer
who was approached by a woman who since
her husband's death had been subject to fits of
delirium and hallucination in which he had
appeared to her and enjoined her to look after
the house, to make the land he had farmed
more productive, and make sure that the chil¬
dren did not squander his legacy. These
episodes were accompanied by intense distress
and agitation, which cut the woman off from
the world so much so that she neglected her
children, one of whom died as a result. Letting
this child die, and allowing her legacy to waste
away, was obviously the disaster of her life.
The Pygmy healer who saw this woman
was thus faced with a case of pathological
bereavement. A European psychiatrist would
have looked no further, and would have rec¬
ommended treatment with neuroleptic anti¬
depressant drugs which would have "got rid of
the symptom". But the Pygmy healer was not
satisfied with this sort of rough and ready
approach. It took him several weeks to find
out what the problem was. During his long ill¬
ness, the patient's husband had asked her to go
into the forest and gather herbs that might
cure him, but pleading shortage of time or
money as an excuse the woman had shirked
doing so, and after her husband's death this
made her feel (with some justification) respon¬
sible for his demise. This unconfessed guilt
could resurface only in the form of demoniac
possession, in which her husband came and
reminded her of himself. Once her fault was
brought out into the open, she was able through
a ritual ceremony to reduce it to its due propor¬
tions and make amends for it, and she was soon
rid of the hallucinatory bereavement symptoms.
The second example has to do with the
treatment of a case of male sterility. A man
came to a healer complaining of persistent
sterility. From unions with several women he
had begotten no offspring, although when they
had left him the women had soon managed to
procreate. The healer was not content merely to
prescribe his patient the simples that would
solve the sterility problem. He suspected a psy¬
chogenic cause and investigated the matter with
him. Some weeks later he uncovered the nub of
the matter. The patient admitted that he had
met women without the approval of his father,
who had several times laid a curse upon him.
The healer then sent for the father, got the story
out of him and arranged a reconciliation which
was made possible by putting the son's fault
into perspective. Soon afterwards the son mar¬
ried with his father's agreement, and nine
months later a child the first of many was
born of this union.
Here the patient's relationship to the cause
of his problem is easy to spot behind the trivial
and treatable symptom. It was only by talking
it out that the healer managed to reconstitute
the symbolic course of events that led to the
disaster a procedure very close to psycho¬
analysis. A psychoanalyst is not someone who
knows what is subconsciously brewing behind
a symptom; he is someone who through his
ignorance allows a patient to elucidate what is
THE SYMBOLISM
OF PAYMENT
Now let us consider the nature of analytical
treatment. In Europe it is generally considered
that analysis is for those who can afford to pay
for it. Freud himself always emphasized that
treatment through talking could not begin to
work until some form of payment had been
made. Payment serves a twofold purpose. It
reflects the individual nature of the service
asked of the analyst, not so much because he is
treating the patient which is after all his
job as because the treatment requires him to
put aside his subjective self and subordinate it
to a desire for knowledge which will enable
the patient to cure himself. Thus in a pyscho-

analytical relationship the payment is the price
paid to the analyst for sacrificing though not
forgetting his subjectivity. Secondly the pay¬
ment has a loss function. Money paid out is
money lost, and in an analytical treatment this
means forfeiting the pathological comfort that
may be associated with certain symptoms.
In Africa economic problems are always
invoked in order to argue that people with
nothing obviously cannot be expected to pay.
This is to overlook the symbolic dimension of
payment, which Freud again emphasized when
he urged his pupils to open psychoanalysis to
all classes of society. After all, there are plenty
of other ways of paying apart from money,
such as paying with one's time, through ser¬
vices rendered. Freud used to ask his patients 31

to do a variety of things, such as bibliograph¬
ical research, for him. This was taken into
account when it came to paying for treatment.
Traditional practitioners in Africa also
believe that patients should pay, and that some
part of their goods (and of the morbid comfort
linked to their symptoms) should be lost. In
some African countries psychoanalysis seems
to have become acclimatized quite naturally, as
regards both recognition of the patient's indi¬
viduality and also the need to get payment
from him or her.
On the other hand a psychoanalyst has no
chance of operating in Africa, of following a
patient step by step in his or her search for the
truth, unless he is thoroughly conversant with
the local culture not from reading textbooks
of ethnology but directly, as a result of being
steeped in the cultural environment. Hence it
seems essential to train therapists who can be at
home on the interface between two forms of
knowledge: knowledge of the unconscious
mind, which evolves a new theory about each
patient's relationship with the world, and
knowledge of the individual's relationships with
his or her parents and family, society, the neigh¬
bourhood and the deity relationships which
vary according to ethnic group, culture and
period.
Though the mechanisms people use in
order to come to terms with reality are the
same everywhere, they may be expressed in
totally different ways. Superficially there is
nothing in common between the way in which
a European family organizes its mourning
after the death of a child and the way in which
African parents who have lost several children
contrive to protect an unborn infant from the
awful sequence of continual journeys back and
forth across the river of life. Ignorance of all
these mechanisms lays a European psychoana¬
lyst open to mistaken interpretations; and this
is a pitfall into which many technical assistance
psychiatrists have fallen. After reading a few
books and meeting a few people, they have
thought they understood how their patients'
minds worked. They might, for example, have
regarded a liver complaint in a Hausa man as a
trivial hypochondriac symptom, whereas in
fact it represented a fundamental assault on the
seat of his courage and virility.
AFRICAN WISDOM
The important thing in Africa is to relate psy¬
choanalysis to all aspects of the culture, to all
the accumulated wisdom of an area not yet
overtaken by acculturation, where people still
understand what the basis of their life is and
which family and cultural landmarks they can
hold on to. This interface between two types of
knowledge should produce an approach to psy¬
chology consistent with the African idea of
taking responsibility, and also with an analytical
ethos which presupposes that the patient is a

European psychiatry seems to me to have

guidelines for explaining the African mind.
After listening to it with ironical patience,
Africans have retained their profound beliefs
intact, convinced that the way in which people
experience the power of speech is chosen by
them and enables them to react to their envi¬

them. Psychoanalysis in Europe has been and
always will be subversive because it puts the

SOME years ago, Dr. C., a Parisian hypnosis
specialist under whom I was working as a
psychiatrist and psychoanalyst, asked me
to help him by interpreting for a Libyan patient
of his whose left arm and leg were paralysed.
The patient had left Libya more than a year
earlier and had been shunted from one hospital
to another all over Europe. He had undergone
the most searching examinations, all of which
had ruled out any possible organic causes for
his illness. He was eventually diagnosed as suf¬
fering from hysteria and was sent to Paris for
hypnosis treatment.
The patient, who was twenty-eight years of
age and spoke virtually nothing but Arabic, was
delighted at being able to talk in his mother
tongue to a therapist who understood it. With
his few words of English, he had managed to
start conversing with Dr. C., who had already
given him one hypnosis session before we met.
I had three long conversations with him, during
which he told me his story. On the day after his
second hypnosis session, the patient was
extremely agitated and told us that he had
woken up during the night in great pain: he had
felt acute cramp his left big toe and had been
able to move his foot for the first time in a year.
The young man gradually recovered the
use of his left foot, which had lost 50 per cent
of its muscle volume. At the end of two weeks,
he was walking with the aid of a stick. In the
meantime, Dr. C. continued his hypnosis ses¬
sions and I continued to have conversations
with the patient. Two months after he had
arrived in Paris, the patient was cured and
returned to his own country, where he was ini¬
tially welcomed like somebody who had been
saved by a miracle.
A FATHER'S CURSE
It is worth going deeper into the story of this
young man and his social and cultural back¬
ground. Before he fell ill, he had had two
major conflicts with his father, one over his
own marriage and the other over the marriage
of his sister.
In a bid to oblige him to marry a cousin
against his will, the patient's father had secretly
given him a love potion that would also make
him obey his father's wishes. Under the effects
of this magic draught, the young man went
through the marriage ceremony in a trance¬
like state. "I was happy," he said, "but it was as
if someone else was getting married." As soon
as the effects of the potion wore off, he sepa¬
rated from his wife, but the same stratagem
was again used to force him to go back to her.
The father kept on interfering in order to make
sure that he stayed with his wife. In the end,
the father uttered a threat whose unconscious
impact on the son he failed to realize. What he
said was: "If you leave your wife again, I shall
leave your mother."
The father had wanted the patient's sister to
marry his nephew, the brother of the patient's
wife. The conflict had then taken a dramatic
turn. The sister had been mercilessly thrashed
in front of the whole village and had thrown
herself out of a window. The patient had tried
to come between her and their father who, on
seeing his authority challenged, had cried: "She
is not your daughter. Get out! You are no
longer my son."
In revenge, the rejected suitor, who was
both the patient's cousin and his brother-in-
law, took away the patient's wife and four chil¬
dren. The patient's in-laws took him to court
and accused him of having driven his wife and
children from the family home. The case
dragged on for some eighteen months, during
which time scarcely any heed was paid to the
patient's word and good faith. He was sen¬
tenced to pay over two-thirds of his earnings
to his former wife, just when he was about to
undergo surgery on an artificial plate that had
been placed in his collar-bone two years earlier
following a car accident.
When he came round from the anaesthetic,
the poor man was paralysed down one side.
The doctors' opinion was that this was due to
a lesion in the nervous system of the brachial
plexus. Since there were no suitable facilities
available in Libya, he was sent to Europe for
treatment at the state's expense.
THE POWER OF MEDICINE
This story is particularly interesting on
account of the extraordinary combination of
personal and cultural factors at work. Together
they conferred on the patient's symptoms a
fascination that even the celebrated Professor
Charcot would have acknowledged, in a con¬
text where psychoanalysis does not exist and
where hysteria is branded as malingering.
The failure of leading specialists to cure the
patient strengthened his conviction that the doc-
tors did not understand him. He was therefore
on the lookout for a magic solution or the inter¬
vention of an all-powerful figure. His meeting
with Dr. C. was accordingly preordained: the
hypnosis treatment reminded him of the spell¬
like practices to which he had been subjected by
his father. The patient saw a parallel between the
hypnotic trance and the effects of the potion,
and even the effects of the anaesthetic after
which he had become partly paralysed.

As a result of being listened to, he was able
to shed light on the relationship which he had
established with his symptom. He remembered
that the day after his sister had been beaten and
gagged by their father and he had released her
against the patriarch's wishes, he woke up with
bruises on his wrist and ankles, at the same
places where the bonds had left marks on his
sister's body. Simply talking about this to some¬
body who realized its symbolic importance
made it possible for him to recognize that the
marks represented his participation in, and
identification with, his sister's suffering.
Similarly, emphasizing the importance of
the words spoken by his father "She is not
your daughter. . . . You are no longer my son. .
. . If you leave your wife again, I shall leave
your mother" prompted him, without any
interpretation from me, to establish a relation¬
ship between them and the disappearance of
sexual desire after he had become paralysed.
Those words awoke in him the horror of
incest which he had repressed until then. He
took his father's words "She is not your
daughter" to mean that it was not he, the son,
who had conceived her with the mother, while
"You are no longer my son", meant "I release
you from the taboo of incest of which I, your
father, was the guarantor and by threatening to
leave your mother I make possible."
As soon as the court declared that he was
divorced, his father's threats took on an
cdipal significance and the patient woke up
from the anaesthetic suffering from a hyster¬
ical hemiplegia and a loss of all sexual desire.
Hence listening to the patient was instru¬
mental in bringing out a subject which had
hitherto only been expressed through massive
and serious symptoms. During our last con¬
versations, he said to me: "Nobody has ever
listened to me as you have done. When I get
back home, I should like to change jobs and
learn to do yours."
However, when he did go home, he was
again faced with the incomprehension of the
medical profession which, recalling the diag¬
nosis of hysteria made by the European spe¬
cialists before he was sent to Paris, looked
upon him as a malingerer, a good-for-nothing
and a coward who did not want to work. He
was even ordered to repay the costs incurred
as a result of his "so-called" illness.
He was compelled to start working again
when he had barely recovered. He developed
other symptoms, and had to be operated on
again. In a manner of speaking, he had to
undergo further physical ordeals against his
own will in order to prove his good faith and
the legitimacy of his suffering.

Russia: the revenge of subjectivity
by Aleksandr Mikhalevuh
36
PSYCHOANALYTICAL literature was circulated
in Czarist Russia from 1907 onwards by
Russian doctors who had been trained in
Switzerland, Germany or Austria and had then
gone on to practise analysis in their own country.
These followers of modified forms of Freudianism
strongly opposed the view that the causes of
mental illness are constitutional, and were hostile
to the pessimistic and lazy attitude which led to
confining its victims in asylums. From their expe¬
rience as practitioners in local communities, they
came to believe that there was little point in
working on dreams, associations of ideas and
sexual and infantile phantasms in an autocratic
society that did not allow its subjects any
autonomy. Nevertheless, the Czarist censors did
nothing to prevent the publication of the review
Psikhoterapiya, the formation of a medical circle
whose meetings were known as the "little
Fridays", or the translation of the works of Freud
and his disciples.
The Russian Freudians, who were comfortably
established in their country's scientific and pro¬
fessional institutions, were reluctant to relate indi¬
viduals to their psycho-sexual background, to the
effects of childhood traumas, or to the conflict trig¬
gered off by the remoteness and coincidence of
past and present in their experience. They turned
instead to psychotherapeutic techniques con¬
sisting of a mixture of psychoanalysis (to shed
light on the meaning of the symptoms), and of sug¬
gestion (to reeducate patients and help them to
readapt).
The influence of the "nervism" school formed
by I. M. Scchenov and later developed by I. P.
Pavlov and V. M. Bekhterev prompted the Russian
Freudians to look for a physiological basis for the
psychological mechanisms and processes described
by psychoanalysis. This reductionist approach
tended to make them somewhat distrustful of
introspection, to raise the brain reflex to the status
of a key concept in scientific psychology and to
play down the insights of mentally disturbed
people into their own condition.
However, this voluntarist view of the indi¬
vidual as a programmed entity was qualified by
clinical practitioners such as Drs. Drosnès,
Ossipov, Vyrubov and Pevnitzky, who acknowl¬
edged the validity of Freud's discoveries con¬
cerning the sexual causes of neuroses. This was
tantamount to discovering that the individual
had a "psychic reality" which was shaped by the
pleasure principle and was impervious to the
illusions of voluntarist teaching. At the same

time, Freud's disciples applied psychoanalysis
to literanjre and political events, and rediscovered,
in the wake of Dostoyevsky and Tolstoy, the
pathological motivations underlying certain forms
of terrorist and revolutionary action.
THE BOLSHEVIK-STALINIST PHASE
The new regime that emerged from the October
revolution tolerated the existence of a Soviet
Association of Psychoanalysis (1922-1931) and
a Governmental Institute of Psychoanalysis
(1922-1925). Intellectuals living in the big cities
and Communist youth organizations realized
that Freud could become a useful adjunct to
Marx and could justify the sexual freedom
favoured by Lenin in a bid to break down the tra¬
ditional hidebound bourgeois family. Trotsky
regarded the works of Freud and Adler as tools
that could be used to create a new kind of human
being and to provide decisive arguments against
the theses of idealism. Medical doctors who were
advocates of psychoanalysis, such as A. Zalkind,
set out to construct a new form of teaching prac¬
tice based on the concept of sublimation: since
human beings possess a single form of bio-psy¬
chic energy, it should be managed in such a way
as to derive the maximum benefit from eroti¬
cism for collective purposes, and also perhaps
to bring about the end of "sexual imprisonment".
Although it did not share these extraordinary
views, the Soviet Association of Psychoanalysis,
a club of university teachers and middle-ranking
Communist Party officials favourable to
Freudianism, worked on possible ways and means
of taking prophylactic sociological action. The
educationalist Vera Schmidt founded the
"International Solidarity" hostel in Moscow in
1922 to experiment with an original approach to
the education of the two- to five-year-old children
in her charge. The systematic and collective
analysis of the counter-transference of educa¬
tionalists on children went hand-in-hand with
the use of teaching methods designed to encourage
the development of a sense of reality, cleanliness
and personal autonomy, and endeavoured to min¬
imize the repression of the children's sexual drive
and the guilt feelings it aroused. However, this
non-authoritarian exercise in education was dis¬
continued in 1925. Moreover, after the political
eclipse of Trotsky and the end of the New
Economic Policy (N.E.P.), blind faith was placed
in state planning as a means of consolidating and
"curing" the human personality.
Even before the Soviet psychoanalytical move¬
ment was banned by Stalin, it was already falling
apart. Psychoanalysis was condemned as being too
long and expensive a process and as imprisoning
patients within themselves. In the early 1930s the
rejection of all forms of psychotherapy heralded
this development, which stifled individual aspi¬
rations in the name of industrial efficiency.
Naturally, references to infantile sexuality and to
phantasms were especially forbidden, since the
psychology of the self had been put to death.
In spite of the reign of terror, researchers made
a case for recognizing the specific character of

certain individual psychological processes and
the existence of an unconscious mind. Novelists
such as Yevgeny Zamyatin in We and Yury
Karlovich Olesha in Envy were outspoken enough
to claim that the Revolution had given birth to a
gulag-like soup kitchen, into which the irruption
of sexuality would perhaps thwart the then current
process of robotization.
Freudianism was forced underground. It was
later to serve as a model for the revenge taken by
the individual after the Stalinist era.

unconscious into line with current thinking. A
conference held in Moscow in 1 962 gave official
status to this attempt to rediscover the subjective
by means of a less ideologically-oriented critique
of psychoanalysis.
During the cyclical phases of freeze and thaw
which marked the evolution of Soviet society
significant advances were being made in urban
growth, the development of higher education,
the relative accessibility of information, and
exchanges with the West. In 1968, a paper by
Bassin on the Problem of the Unconscious
attempted, with a measure of official support,
to impose a theory of personality which took
account of unconscious processes and defence
mechanisms such as projection, rationalization,
sublimation and repression. However, the new
individual forged by Soviet psychology was a
subject that was fully developed, balanced and
capable of modifying his or her behaviour in
order to adapt to the demands of reality. Persistent
psychological conflicts, neuroses, and the ravages
caused by desire were only marginal occurrences
typifying a (pathological) minority of the popu¬
lation. This conception of the individual, which
minimized the roles of sexuality and conflict,
was upheld until 1969, when a Congress on the
problem of the unconscious was held in Tbilisi.
From the 1970s onwards, the Soviet social sci¬
ences stressed the fact that the qualitative devel¬
opment of the economy and adaptation to the
third industrial revolution that was then begin¬
ning to take shape called for a relatively heteroge¬
neous pattern of society and a degree of individual
autonomy. This represented the revenge of the
personality against the mechanical reductionism
which had regarded individuals as strictly social and
biological entities. Under cover of social psy¬
chology and of the scientific study of collective
interactions, the dominant value became one of
restricted pluralism.
PSYCHOANALYSIS UNDER PERESTROIKA
From 1985 onwards, a number of Soviet scholars
called for the rehabilitation of psychoanalysis, the
creation of a scientific sexology, and the publi¬
cation of the works of Freud. The unofficial prac¬
tice of psychoanalysis, which until then had only
been tolerated, crept back in again through the co¬
operative system. In 1989, the psychiatrist and
endocrinologist Aron Belkin re-established the
Russian Association of Psychoanalysis in
Moscow. Some ten years before, Belkin had pub¬
lished a work entitled "The Individual and
Socialization", in which he denounced the harm
done by the totalitarian system under Stalin'. In
particular, he stressed that identification with the
Supreme Guide had crushed the family father
. figure, forced the individual to regard as diabol¬
ical any alternative that was rejected by an
authority vested with quasi-sacred power, and
eventually caused the death of thought and the
blunting of all moral sense. Brief outbursts of
aggression had provided the only outlet for the-
desire for freedom. In "The Soviet fdipus"
(1983), the literary critic E. Kogan attacked what
he called "the obsessive identification with the
father who had disappeared, the feeling of shame
towards the father who had been deported or
eliminated as an enemy of the people, and the soli¬
tude and wanderings of the son".
Novelists such as Voinovich and Zinoviev
have described people of this kind as products of
the kickback generation, a world which saw the

triumph of servility and selfishness, envy and
resentment. Trainee analysts constantly encounter
patients who demand a quick cure, stubbornly
refuse to accept their personal autonomy and
cannot grasp the liberating value of making pay¬
ment in exchange for the sessions they received.
This painful emergence of the individual, in
parallel with the restoration of psychology and
syncretic forms of psychoanalysis, is taking place
against a background of social pathology
involving alcoholism, an alarming rate of child
mortality and flagrant criminal activity. Brutal
attempts to introduce economic reform are
making life difficult for the artistic and scientific
intelligentsia which paved the way for the revenge
of subjectivity on the totalitarian model.
One thing is certain. This ambiguous process
of social and cultural differentiation has certainly
been encouraged by the distant memory of

Psychoanalysis in Quebec
by Monique Panauio
40
THE problem of identity runs through the
history of Quebec from the earliest colonial
times up to the present day, when one of the
main issues involved in the integration of Quebec
into the Canadian constitution is the recogni¬
tion of its status as a distinctive society. How
was Quebec's identity forged, and how can psy¬
choanalysis contribute to an understanding of
its unique history and play its role in the emer¬
gence of the individual?
CATHOLIC AND FRENCH
In the seventeenth century the first colonists of
this French outpost whose mission was to spread
civilization and the Gospel were themselves for
the most part poor and ignorant. They had to sur¬
vive as best they could in an apparently bound¬
less land plunged in interminable winter. France's
hopes of its colony on the banks of the St.
Lawrence were soon disappointed. There was
no gold and there were no diamonds. All that was-
left was morality. The Catholic congregations
that then proliferated in Europe founded com¬
munities in New France, where they could pursue
their mission in complete freedom.
Over the ensuing centuries, Quebec was, for
better or for worse, to remain Catholic and
French. Conquest by the English in 1760; the
failure of the republican uprising of 1837, which
saw the increasingly influential French-Canadian

clergy make common cause with the English to
protect their divinely-sanctioned powers; even the

all of these failed to put an end to French culture
in America.
Until the Quiet Revolution of the 1960s,
political and economic power was in the hands of
English-speakers, while French-speakers domi¬
nated social and religious life. The Church estab¬
lished a monopoly over moral suffering. The
religious communities took care of the mentally
ill, and as private corporations received in return
a daily per-capita sum from the state. It was thus
in the Church's interest to maximize the number
of inmates and economize on their care. Vast
asylums were constructed, self-contained com¬
munities that had the legal status of municipali¬
ties and Catholic parishes. It was in this field
that a conflict of values took place between
French-speaking Catholics and English-speaking
Protestants. The former had a privileged status in
charitable work through their hold over health¬
care institutions; the latter pressed their claims in
the name of progress. In education, two parallel
systems were also set up.
In the mid-nineteenth century, when Freud's
birth in the Moravian town of Freiberg fore¬
shadowed a fundamental break in the continuum
of human thought, Quebec's French-speakers
were developing a national mystique under the eye
of the Catholic Church, which saw itself as the
guarantor of its people's survival.
In the 1930s and 1940s, the clerical elite based
its temporal power on anti-semitism, anti-
Bolshevism and xenophobia. The religious com¬
munities joined forces with the state to promote
traditional rural values in face of industrialization,
urbanization and social change. Yet it was from
within their ranks that the "plague", as Freud
himself once described psychoanalysis, began to
spread. The first journal to address the subject was
La Revue Dominicaine ("The Dominican
Review"), when it published extracts from a doc¬
toral thesis on The Bases ofFreudianism. It was
the Dominicans too who in 1942 founded the
Institute of Psychology at the University of
Montreal, which included in its syllabus "the
psychological system of Freud".
The religious establishment of the time saw in
psychoanalysis a new argument in favour of its
cause. If Freudianism teaches that human beings
are ruled by impulses that are beyond them, then
this is all the more reason why they should turn to

God. But a new generation was coming to the
fore in Quebec, one whose members were no
longer prepared to put up with economic stagna¬
tion, with the introversion and the sense of shame
they had inherited from their forebears, with
their situation as a submissive colonized people.
TROUBLED TIMES
AND TROUBLED MINDS
The Quiet Revolution of the 1960s transformed
Quebec almost overnight. In less than a decade
the state's role was enlarged, a clergy-dominated
society began to turn away from agriculture,
new institutions appeared, and education and
social welfare became priority issues. The reli¬
gious communities could no longer meet the
new requirements of an industrializing society.
The welfare state was born, bringing with it free
social services, education and medicine. This was
also the golden age of psychiatry in Quebec. The
health service was rebuilt on fresh ideological
foundations. The suffering were no longer
entrusted to charitable institutions; they became
patients in need of care and rehabilitation.
The effects of the challenge to the old values
were spectacular. Traditional morality was shat¬
tered, people deserted the churches, marriage went
out of fashion and demands for a national identity
went hand in hand with calls for sexual freedom.
Low self-esteem was replaced by unrealistically
high self-regard. French Canadians no longer saw
themselves either as Canadians a name which
tended to be associated instead with their English-
speaking conquerors nor as French, a word
recalling colonial links to the motherland. Instead
they became Québécois, people of Quebec, and
promoted joual, the Quebec dialect, as their own
language. Quebec welcomed immigrants and
opened itself to the world. The time was ripe for
artistic and literary creativity and for new ideas of
every kind. Relations with France, which had

grown somewhat chilly because of the French lay
tradition, now became warmer. Young Québécois
went to France to study and returned home to start
work. The group known as Interprétation, and the
humanities journal of the same name, had their
origin in this collaboration between France and
Quebec.
Many people were disturbed by the rapid
pace of social change. In the 1970s and 1980s
they were normally offered free, medicine-based
psychiatric treatment. Psychoanalysis was not
unknown in the hospitals, but less and less use
was made of it, until it was finally confined to the
private sector and marginalized. It would not be
accurate to say that psychoanalysis was pushed
out of the great debates of the day, for that would
imply a degree of recognition it had never in fact
enjoyed. Little was heard of it except for occa¬
sional articles in journals like Interprétation
(which folded after twenty-four issues had been
published). Françoise Dolto sometimes made
the cover of popular magazines, but that was
imported news. Even the universities, which had

ingly to follow the American model and empha¬
size experimental research.
THE PSYCHOANALYTICAL APPROACH
Psychoanalysis remains marginal to the great ques¬
tions of the day because its concerns transcend cur¬
rent nationalist viewpoints: the approach of those
who seek "an immense bilingual nation stretching
from ocean to ocean" and are concerned about the
fragmentation of Canada; the views of those sup¬
porters of the sovereignty of Quebec who dream
of a "people of giants" enjoying cultural and eco¬
nomic autonomy in a free, pluralistic society; and
the attitude of the Amerindians who seek self-
government.
The psychoanalytical approach, whose func¬
tion is to unveil the unconscious forces at work
in the mind of the individual undergoing analysis,
is disconcerting for the nationalistic mindset. Yet
it is only by seeing themselves as a people or a
nation and then by identifying with this image
they have made of themselves that Quebec's
French-speakers have hitherto been able to ensure
their cultural survival in a largely English-

speaking America. Until that survival is more
certain, it is unlikely that psychoanalysis and its
concerns will emerge from the restricted circles
to which they are presently confined.
Quebec's history has been built on disconti¬
nuity and forgetting. First came the break with the
continent of Europe, then with France, then with
England and then with the Catholic tradition not
to mention the separation inevitably involved in
emigration which, now as in the past, is part of the
experience of much of Quebec's population. And
an clement of forgetting inevitably accompanies
these discontinuities. Car numbcrplates in Quebec
bear the motto/c me souviens ("I remember"), but
if you ask people exactly what it is they are sup¬
posed to be remembering, very few of them know.
Psychoanalysis could no doubt find a role
for itself in social, legal, educational and health
institutions by helping people to reclaim their his¬
tory and origins and, what is more, by offering
society as a whole a way of thought that would
allow it to approach politics in a different way,
without recourse to illusions, and to put discon¬
tinuity behind it. 43

TECHNOLOGY AND COPYRIGHT
Technology is developing so quickly
that creators are having a harder and
harder time protecting their rights,
according to speakers at a three-day
forum organized by Unesco late last
year to coincide with the 40th
anniversary of Unesco's Universal
Copyright Convention. Digital copying
and musical sampling aroused
particularly heated discussion.
Sampling is a process whereby
extracts of music, sometimes broken
down to single notes, are electronically
memorized and reassembled to create
new works. Until now musical copyright
has covered melodies, or sequences of
notes, but not single notes. In another
field, electronic publishing, it will soon
be possible to consult not just printed
text but also extracts from films or
musical works on compact disc. The
forum adopted a declaration inviting
Unesco to follow closely developments
in electronic publishing, multimedia
publishing and sampling, and "to
reinforce its action to encourage the
international protection of copyright".
MEMBRANES: A NEW SCIENCE
A Unesco Centre for Membrane
Science and Technology is to be set up
in Australia under the auspices of the
Special Research Centre for Membrane
Science and Technology of the
University of New South Wales. As
barriers controlling the flow of
substances to and from cells,
membranes are essential to the
biological processes of all living
organisms. Synthetic membranes play
an important role in many industrial
and biomedical processes, from water
desalinization to dialysis in artificial
kidneys. The market for membranes is
growing rapidly, and it is vital to
facilitate access by developing
countries to this expanding field.
ECOLOGY ON THE CURRICULUM
The Baltic Sea Project (BSP) was
created in 1988 on the initiative of the
Finnish delegation to Unesco to
establish a network of schools in the
Baltic region which would provide a
common environmental curriculum.
More than 150 schools are now
participating in the project, and in view
of its success, a similar project
involving the North Sea countries is
being prepared. Meanwhile, the BSP is
preparing for publication, with Unesco
support, a new teachers' guide to
environmental education and student
exchange programmes. It is hoped that
the guide, prepared by more than 20
educators in the region, will encourage
the introduction of ecology into school
curricula.

DOCUMENT: A LETTER FROM FREUD TO EINSTEIN ic-nti-«.d hM poS. 7,
if we ignore the fact that right is founded on
brute force and even today needs violence
to maintain it.
Life force and death instinct
I now can comment on another of your state¬
ments. You are amazed that it is so easy to
infect men with the war-fever, and you sur¬
mise that man has in him an active instinct for
hatred and destruction, amenable to such
stimulations. I entirely agree with you. I
believe in the existence of this instinct and
have been recently at pains to study its man¬
ifestations.
In this connexion may I set out a fragment
of that knowledge of the instincts, which we
psychoanalysts, after so many tentative essays
and gropings in the dark, have compassed?
We assume that human instincts are of two
kinds: those that conserve and unify, which
we call "erotic" (in the meaning Plato gives to
Eros in his Symposium), or else "sexual"
(explicitly extending the popular connota¬
tions of "sex"); and, secondly, the instincts to
destroy and kill, which we assimilate as the
aggressive or destructive instincts.
These are, as you perceive, the well-known
opposites, Love and Hate, transformed into
theoretical entities; they are, perhaps, another
aspect of those eternal polarities, attraction
and repulsion, which fall within your province.
But we must be chary of passing overhastily to
the notions of good and evil. Each of these
instincts is every whit as indispensable as its
opposite and all the phenomena of life derive
from their activity, whether they work in con¬
cert or in opposition.
It seems that an instinct of either category
can operate but rarely in isolation; it is always
blended ("alloyed", as we say) with a cer¬
tain dosage of its opposite, which modifies its
aim or even, in certain circumstances, is a
prime condition of its attainment. Thus the
instinct of self-preservation is certainly of an
erotic nature, but to gain its ends this very
instinct necessitates aggressive action. In the
same way the love-instinct, when directed
to a specific object, calls for an admixture of
the acquisitive instinct if it is to enter into
effective possession of that object. It is the dif¬
ficulty of isolating the two kinds of instinct in
their manifestations that has so long pre¬
vented us from recognizing them.
If you will travel with me a little further
on this road, you will find that human affairs
are complicated in yet another way. Only
exceptionally does an action follow on the
stimulus of a single instinct. ... As a rule
several motives of similar composition concur
to bring about the act	
When a nation is summoned to engage in
war, a whole gamut of human motives may
respond to this appeal; high and low motives,
some openly avowed, others slurred over. The
lust for aggression and destruction is certainly
included; the innumerable cruelties of history
and man's daily life confirm its prevalence and
strength. The stimulation of these destructive
impulses by appeals to idealism and the erotic
instinct naturally facilitates their release.
Musing on the atrocities recorded on history's
page, we feel that the ideal motive has often
served as a camouflage for the lust of destruc¬
tion; sometimes, as with the cruelties of the
Inquisition, it seems that, while the ideal
motives occupied the foreground of con¬
sciousness, they drew their strength from the
destructive instincts submerged in the uncon¬
scious. Both interpretations are feasible.
... I would like to dwell a little longer on
this destructive instinct which is seldom given
the attention that its importance warrants.
With the least of speculative efforts we are led
to conclude that this instinct functions in

*>v> ffifa
every living being, striving to work its ruin
and reduce life to its primal state of inert
matter. Indeed it might well be called the
"death-instinct"; whereas the erotic instincts
vouch for the struggle to live on. The death
instinct becomes an impulse to destruction
when, with the aid of certain organs, it directs
its action outwards, against external objects.
The living being, that is to say, defends its own
existence by destroying foreign bodies.
But, in one of its activities, the death
instinct is operative within the living being
and we have sought to trace back a number of
normal and pathological phenomena to this
introversion of the destructive instinct. We
have even committed the heresy of explaining
the origin of human conscience by some such
"turning inward" of the aggressive impulse.
Obviously when this internal tendency oper¬
ates on too large a scale, it is no trivial matter,
rather a positively morbid state of things;
whereas the diversion of the destructive
impulse towards the external world must
have beneficial effects. Here is then the bio¬
logical justification for all those vile, perni¬
cious propensities which we now are com¬
bating. We can but own that they are really
more akin to nature than this our stand
against them, which, in fact, remains to be
accounted for. . . .
The upshot of these observations, as
bearing on the subject in hand, is that there is
no likelihood of our being able to suppress
humanity's aggressive tendencies. In some
happy corners of the earth, they say, where
nature brings forth abundantly whatever man
f\.i
.J U
/u -
desires, there flourish races whose lives go
gently by, unknowing of aggression or con¬
straint. This I can hardly credit; I would like
further details about these happy folk	
From our "mythology" of the instincts
we may easily deduce a formula for an indirect
method of eliminating war. If the propensity
for war be due to the destructive instinct, we
have always its counter-agent, Eros, to our
hand. All that produces ties of sentiment
between man and man must serve us as war's
antidote.
These ties are of two kinds. First, such
relations as those towards a beloved object,
void though they be of sexual intent. The
psychoanalyst need feel no compunction in
mentioning "love" in this connexion; reli¬
gion uses the same language: Love thy neigh¬
bour as thyself. A pious injunction easy to
enounce, but hard to carry out! The other
bond of sentiment is by way of identification.
All that brings out the significant resem¬
blances between men calls into play this
feeling of community, identification, whereon
is founded, in large measure, the whole edi¬
fice of human society.
In your strictures on the abuse of
authority I find another suggestion for an
indirect attack on the war-impulse. That men
are divided into leaders and the led is but
another manifestation of their inborn and
irremediable inequality. The second class
constitutes the vast majority; they need a
high command to make decisions for them, to
which decisions they usually bow without
demur. In this context we would point out
. that men should be at greater pains than
heretofore to form a superior class of inde¬
pendent thinkers, unamenable to intimidation
and fervent in the quest for truth, whose
function it would be to guide the masses
dependent on their lead. There is no need to
point out how little the rule of politicians
and the Church's ban on liberty of thought
encourage such a new creation.
The ideal conditions would obviously be
found in a community where every man sub¬
ordinated his instinctive life to the dictates of

reason. Nothing less than this could bring
about so thorough and so durable a union
between men, even if this involved the sev¬
erance of mutual ties of sentiment. But surely
such a hope is utterly Utopian, as things are.
The other indirect methods of preventing
war are certainly more feasible, but entail no
quick results. They conjure up an ugly picture
of mills that grind so slowly that, before the
flour is ready, men are dead of hunger.
. . . But why do we, you and I and many
another, protest so vehemently against war,
instead of just accepting it as another of life's
odious importunities? For it seems a natural
thing enough, biologically sound and practi¬
cally unavoidable. I trust you will not be
shocked by my raising such a question. For
the better conduct of an inquiry it may be
well to don a mask of feigned aloofness.
The answer to my query may run as fol¬
lows: Because every man has a right over his
own life and war destroys lives that were full
of promise; it forces the individual into situ¬
ations that shame his manhood, obliging him
to murder fellow men, against his will; it rav¬
ages material amenities, the fruits of human
toil, and much besides. Moreover wars, as
now conducted, afford no scope for acts of
heroism according to the old ideals and, given
the high perfection of modern arms, war
today would mean the sheer extermination of
one of the combatants, if not of both.
This is so true, so obvious, that we can but
wonder why the conduct of war is not banned
by general consent/Doubtless either of the
points I have just made is open to debate. It
may be asked if the community, in its turn,
cannot claim a right over the individual lives
of its members. Moreover, all forms of war
cannot be indiscriminately condemned; so
long as there are nations and empires, each
prepared callously to exterminate its rival,
all alike must be equipped for war. But we
will not dwell on any of these problems; they
lie outside the debate to which you have
invited me.
I pass on to another point, the basis, as it
strikes me, of our common hatred of war. It
is this: we cannot do otherwise than hate it.
Pacifists we are, since our organic nature
wills us thus to be. Hence it comes easy to us
to find arguments that justify our standpoint.
This point, however, calls for elucida¬
tion. Here is the way in which I see it. The
cultural development of mankind (some, I
know, prefer to call it civilization) has been in
progress since immemorial antiquity. To this
phenomenon we owe all that is best in our
composition, but also much that makes for
human suffering. Its origins and causes are
obscure, its issue is uncertain, but some of its
characteristics are easy to perceive	
The psychic changes which accompany
this process of cultural change are striking,
and not to be gainsaid. They consist in the
progressive rejection of instinctive ends and
a scaling down of instinctive reactions.
Sensations which delighted our forefathers
have become neutral or unbearable to us;
and, if our ethical and aesthetic ideals have
undergone a change, the causes of this are
ultimately organic.
On the psychological side two of the
most important phenomena of culture are,
firstly, a strengthening of the intellect, which
tends to master our instinctive life, and, sec¬
ondly, an introversion of the aggressive
impulse, with all its consequent benefits and
perils. Now war runs most emphatically
counter to the psychic disposition imposed on
us by the growth of culture; we are therefore
bound to resent war, to find it utterly intol¬
erable. With pacifists like us it is not merely
an intellectual and affective repulsion, but a
constitutional intolerance, an idiosyncrasy
in its most drastic form. And it would seem
that the aesthetic ignominies of warfare play
almost as large a part in this repugnance as
war's atrocities.
How long have we to wait before the rest
of men turn pacifist? Impossible to say, and
yet perhaps our hope that these two factors
man's cultural disposition and a well-founded
dread of the form that future wars will take
may serve to put an end to war in the near,
future, is not chimerical. But by what ways or
by-ways this will come about, we cannot
guess. Meanwhile we may rest on the assur¬
ance that whatever makes for cultural devel¬
opment is working also against war. ...

TRADITIONAL MUSIC
IRAQ. Traditional Rhythmic Structures
UNESCO's Traditional Musks of Today
series
Unesco CD D 8044
Iraq, the cradle of splendid
ancient civilizations, is
considered in the Arab world to
possess a musical tradition of
great purity. Various maqam, or
modes, are associated with
different parts of the country,
and the singers may be
accompanied by any of several
instruments including the
santour (struck zither), the djoze
(spike fiddle), tablah (goblet
drums) or the riqq (a framed
hand drum with jingles). The
rhythmic complexity of some of
the pieces indicates ancient
Indo-Asiatic influences, and in
tracks like the Mukhalif or the
Fann Khammari, both ofwhich
feature a male-voice choir
accompanied by the great drums
known as tar and by rhythmic
clapping, the strangulated voice
of the soloist seems to issue from
the very dawn of time. This is a
high-quality recording. But what
a pity that women are excluded
from this music.
JAZZ
THE NAT ADDERLEY SEXTET.
Work Song.
Nat Adderley (cornet), Sonny Fortune
(alto sax), Vincent Herring (alto sax),
Rob Bargad (piano), Walter Booker
(bass), Jimmy Cobb (drums)
CD Sweet Basil ALCR-44
Nat Adderley, Cannonball
Adderley's brother, is one of the
finest surviving representatives
of the "hard bop" style
popularized in the 1950s by
groups like Art Blakey's Jazz
Messengers. This compact disc,
recorded at New York's Sweet
Basil jazz club, consists of four
standards, "High Fly", "In a
Sentimental Mood", and Nat
Adderley's own "Work Song" and
"Jive Samba", all played with
considerable energy. Alongside
more established talents like
Walter Booker and Jimmy Cobb,
the sextet features Vincent
Herring, only recently discovered
while playing in New York's
streets and subway. His classical
style contrasts with the freer,
more powerful playing of Sonny
Fortune, long a sideman with
McCoy Tyner. This is solid,
robust music one of the many
currents of mainstream jazz.
JAY HOGGARD. The Fountain
Jay Haggard (vibraphone), Kenny
Burrell (guitar), James We'idman
(piano), Marcus Mdaurine (bass),
Yoron Israel (drums).
CD Muse MCD 5450
Jay Hoggard is currently the most
inventive jazz vibraphonist of his
generation. Destined for a
brilliant career, he needs to be
more widely known. Backed here
by the great guitarist Kenny
Burrell and by a group of younger
instrumentalists including
pianist James Weidman, who has
accompanied Abbey Lincoln and
other singers, Hoggard plays two
original numbers and several
standards including
"Epistrophy", "My One and Only
Love", "Stompih at the Savoy"
and a splendid "Prelude to a
Kiss". Hoggard is absolute master
of his instrument; he has
MiM
complete control of tone,
accentuation and phrasing, a
rich feeling for harmony and a
highly developed melodic and
rhythmic sense. He stretches the
vibraphone's range to make it
sound a much less limited
instrument than it actually is.
POPULAR MUSIC
L'ORCHESTRE DE CONTREBASSES.
Les Cargos
CD Label Bleu LBLC 6536 HM 83
The Orchestre de Contrebasses,
made up of seven young French
bass players (Olivier Moret,
Christian Gentet, Frederic
Alcaraz, Renaud Garcia-Fons,
Yves Torchinski, Jean-Philippe
Viret and Thibault Uelor), is
beginning to win an
international reputation. Several
American jazz bassists, including
Anthony Cox, have talked to me
about it in the past few months.
There is nothing new about the
idea of a bass ensemble. In New
York in the 1970s David Lee,
father of the film director Spike
Lee, created the remarkable Bass
Choir which played jazz only.
The Orchestre de Contrebasses
plays original compositions by its
members "Béret, beurre,
cornichons", "Week end à
Deauville", "A pas de chat" that
are completely sui generis,
neither jazz, pop nor
contemporary music. As Lionel
Rotcage rightly claims in his brief
cover note, "The music of this
strange group . . . draws its
energy from evocation, poetry
and sheer zaniness". The
Orchestre de Contrebasses is
worth discovering.
ABED AZRIÉ. Aromates
CD Elektro Nonesuch 7559-79241-2
Azrié, a Syrian from Aleppo, finds
his inspiration in oriental poems
such as the Epic of Gilgamesh
which he sings to the
accompaniment of a synthesizer
and various traditional Arab
instruments, including the
qanun, nay and drums. The
lyrics (by the Palestinians Samih
Al-Qassem and Tawfiq Zayyad,
the Iraqis Badr Chaker As-
Sayyab, Al-Hallaj and Rabiah Al-
Adawiyyah, the Syrian poet
Adonis, and the Lebanese Khalil
Hawi and Ounsi Al-Haj) are of
great beauty, and Azrié's grave
and mysterious voice puts them
to intelligent use. My only
complaint is that the synthesizer
creates an inappropriate New
Age atmosphere that slightly
spoils this otherwise splendid
world of sound.
CLASSICAL MUSIC
RODRIGO AND KHACHATURIAN.
Flute Concertos
Patrick Gallois (Ilute) and the
Philharmonia Orchestra, conducted by
Ion Marin
CD Deutsche Grammophon 435 767-2
The remarkable young flautist
Patrick Gallois gets a panpipe¬
like sound from his instrument,
demonstrated here in two
concertos by 20th-century
composers, Joaquin Rodrigo
(born 1901) and Aram
Khachaturian (1903-78). The
first, which was composed for
the Irish flautist James Galway, is
pastoral in mood and difficult to
play. The second, more sombre
and Slavic, was originally written
in 1940 for the violin of David
Oistrakh and was subsequently
adapted by the composer himself
for the outstanding French
flautist Jean-Pierre Rampai.
Spanish themes remain in the
background in the Rodrigo
concerto, which calls for
considerable virtuosity on the
part of the soloist. By contrast,
the Khachaturian piece is
unmistakably Russian,
particularly the Andante,
inspired by a Caucasian men's
dance. However different the
style of the two works may be,
they share a common Moorish
influence, since the folklore of
both Spain and the Caucasus
bears the trace of Arab music.

WORLD OF BOOKS
An das of
world literature
Itwould be hard to imagine a more appro¬
priate work with which to launch this
column than Le Grand Atlas des Littéra¬
tures (The Great Atlas of World Literature)
published in Paris by Encyclopaedia
Universalis in 1990. The Atlas is a reference
book which also stimulates the reader to ask
fundamental questions about the nature of
literature.
What is literature? Is it simply a collection
of signs, as Roland Barthes maintains in Degré
zéro de l'écriture (Writing Degree Zero), signs
which bear no relation to ideas, language or
style but exist to define the isolation of a ritual
language? Or is it a mirror held up to history,
offering a wide range of ways of making sense
of an ever-changing, multifarious and
inescapable reality? Whether regarded as form
or essence, the fruit of mental activity for its
own sake, of political commitment or even of
political servitude, fiction in the form of epic
or drama, poetry or prose has long been the
subject of debate between the partisans of a
disembodied, incantatory "pure beauty", and
those who opt for a "useful" literature devoted
to political and moral education.
Of course, so-called "committed" litera¬
ture often ends up as little more than militant
pamphleteering, thus renouncing the essen¬
tial function of all art, which is to present
the world through the artist's unique, trans¬
forming vision. It is nevertheless true that
literature, perhaps more than all the other
arts, has always had a special relationship
with history, from the great Asian and
Mediterranean epics, the northern sagas and
the folktales of Africa, to Shakespeare and the
contemporary novel.
A THEMATIC APPROACH
The distinguishing feature of the 436-page
Atlas is its thematic approach, which intro¬
duces the reader to major works of the imag-
50 ¡nation from many countries, whilst at the
same time bringing him or her into the vital,
never-ending debate that revolves around the
same, oft-repeated questions: How was lit¬
erature born? How can it be defined? What
purpose does it serve?
This monumental tome offers stimulating
reflections on literary forms, structures and
genres and their links with the real world
and with philosophical and religious thought.
With the Atlas we journey through Africa,
India, southeast Asia, Japan and China, dis¬
covering en route the links that have been
forged in many parts of the world from the
earliest times down to the present between the
theatrical traditions of Europe and the East,
between poems, talcs and myths, between
abstract thought and signs.
Literature, the creation of a mind engaged
in a process of self-discovery which draws on
the imaginary and the real, cannot exist
without a material support the stone and
clay tablets of Mesopotamia, the volumen
or roll of papyrus (which began to be used
around the time of the appearance of writing
in ancient Egypt), and the codex, the form
taken by the book from the times of ancient
Rome and China until the glorious days of
the European Renaissance saw the birth of
modern printing.
The codex, which appeared in the Roman
empire during the first century of the
Christian era, consisted of sheets of manu-
f ê S
Littératures
script folded in two and grouped into a sec¬
tion called a gathering. The gatherings could
then be sewn together into a book. Codices
were used for sacred and profane subjects, for
story-telling and for purposes of adminis¬
tration. Most texts recorded on them were
later erased. Although the invention of
printing, which took over from the written
manuscript in Europe around the middle of
the fifteenth century, is still commonly attrib¬
uted to Johannes Gensfleisch, better known
as Gutenberg, the Atlas reminds us that
xylography (printing using engraved wooden
blocks) was known in China more than six
centuries before. By the ninth century the
new technique had reached Japan and Korea,
countries which were then subject to Chinese
cultural influence.
A MUSEUM
OF THE WRITTEN WORD
The Atlas also gives a full account of the
written word, from Sanskrit script and Asian
pictograms to medieval calligraphy and
modern printing, and of that verbal sorcerer,
the writer, whether Egyptian scribe or Hindu
pandit, avant-garde poet or exile in search of
a new homeland or new forms of expression,
Other themes treated in the Atlas include
the relationship between reading matter and
the reading public, the commerce in literature
and the literature of commerce, the devel¬
opment of libraries those temples of the
book and the eventful history of publishing
from the earliest days of printing to the mega-
publishers of today. Meanwhile, Gutenberg,
bright central star of his galaxy, looks mis¬
chievously down at McLuhan and the flood
of images that threatened to displace his
invention, the modern book.
An inexhaustible treasure-house of facts
and stimulating ideas, the Grand Atlas des
Littératures draws on the work of major
authorities in linguistics, sociology, palaeo¬
graphy and anthropology. It is also, through
the outstanding quality of its illustrations
maps and photographs, drawings, reproduc¬
tions of paintings and early printed manu¬
scripts a museum of literature and the world
of the imagination.
