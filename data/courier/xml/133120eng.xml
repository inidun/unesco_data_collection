In several regions of the world, peace remains fragile and 
 tenuous. Poverty and conflict put human security at risk 
 and endanger human dignity and social justice. Helping to 
preserve peace in all its dimensions is an abiding challenge for the 
international community, especially in conditions of globalization.
The community of nations must strive for better and more 
equitable ways of addressing these multiple challenges.This quest 
must be based on universally shared values, while safeguarding 
the diversity of individuals and cultures, and it must be targeted 
at the urgent needs of the disadvantaged and excluded groups or 
geographical regions. 
Solidly anchored in democracy, human rights and fundamental 
freedoms, dialogue is the key to this quest, because dialogue alone 
can lead to long-term understanding, reconciliation and peace.
The year 2001 was proclaimed United Nations Year of Dialogue 
among Civilizations. UNESCO and other relevant organizations were 
invited by the UN to promote inter-civilizational and intercultural 
dialogue through conferences and seminars and by disseminating 
information and relevant scholarly material. 
For its part, UNESCO has organized global as well as regional 
and sub-regional conferences. These meetings have sometimes 
been at the level of Heads of State, sometimes they have brought 
Ministers together and sometimes eminent thinkers; occasionally, a 
mixed group of participants has been convened in order to explore 
ways to develop intercultural exchange and dialogue.
This special issue of the new UNESCO Courier, devoted to 
Dialogue among Civilizations, presents a selection of excerpts from 
the presentations made at these fora, as well a range of articles 
showing how the Organization works, and has always worked,  to 
promote dialogue through all of its other activities, whether it be in 
the field of culture, education, communication or science. 
The task is an ongoing one. Dialogue, as French sociologist 
Edgar Morin reminds us in the opening pages of this edition, 
requires much more than different parties gathering around a table. 
But we are convinced that the challenge must be met. Only through 
a whole-hearted and committed practice of dialogue can conflicts 
be resolved, disagreements overcome and discord healed. And only 
in this way can we embark upon our major task of ‘humanizing 
globalization’ and making it more inclusive and equitable.
This issue of the Courier is dedicated to the memory of Michel 
Barton, the Director of UNESCO’s Bureau of Public Information and 
Chief Editor of the new UNESCO Courier until his untimely death 
last November. His energy, enthusiasm and camaraderie – as well 
as his own capacity for dialogue – will be sorely missed by all those 
who had the good fortune to work closely with him.

From Ningxia 
to Paris to Beijing
The Chinese edition of “The Diary 
of Ma Yan”, whose plea to continue 
her education led to the creation of 
an association in France to help the 
young girl and other children in her 
isolated and impoverished village, was 
launched in Beijing last September. 
The diary, first handed to a French 
journalist by Ma Yan’s distressed 
mother, who was too poor to keep her 
daughter in school, became a best-
seller in France and has changed the 
family’s fortunes (see the new Courier 
N°2, April 2003). 
The Association Enfants du 
Ningxia, whose members include 
students from schools in suburbs of 
Paris, continues to grow and is now 
funding the education of 56 children 
from Ma Yan’s village. 
Shortly before the publication of 
Ma Yan’s diary in Beijing, the Special 
Rapporteur of the UN Commission 
on Human Rights on the right to 
education, Katarina Tomasevski, 
criticized the low level of public 
expenditure on education in China, 
which barely reaches 2% of GDP. The 
Ministry of Education has promised to 
accelerate educational development in 
rural areas where 64 per cent of the 
Chinese population resides.

Iranian woman 
wins Nobel Peace Prize
Human rights  and women’s 
organizations around the 
world have applauded the 
award of this year’s Nobel 
Peace  Prize to Iranian 
lawyer and activist, Shirin 
Ebadi.
Mrs Ebadi, 56, was 
the first woman judge 
in her country, but was 
forced to resign after the 
1979 revolution. She then 
established a law practice, 
taking on politically 
sensitive cases that other 
lawyers wouldn’t touch.
This landed her a spell 
in jail in 2000, accused 
of publicizing evidence 
of official involvement 
in attacks on pro-reform 
gatherings and figures. 
In a statement 
announcing the award 
the Nobel Committee 
said it chose Mrs Ebadi 
because of her focus on 
promoting human rights and 
democracy. “As a lawyer, 
judge, lecturer, writer and 
activist, she has spoken 
out clearly and strongly in 
her country, Iran, and far 
beyond.” 
Thousands of people 
turned up to give her 
a hero’s welcome at 
Tehran airport, upon her 
return to Iran after the 
announcement. As she 
stepped off the plane, 
she urged the Iranian 
government to allow greater 
freedom of speech and to 
release political prisoners 
from jail. 
The graduate 
is a lady
Young women are 
now more likely 
than young men to 
obtain first degrees 
from university-
level institutions 
in the member 
countries of the 
OECD, according to 
that organization’s 
annual report, 
Education at a 
Glance, published last September. According 
to the report, the number of men obtaining 
first degrees outstripped women in only three 
countries – Japan, Switzerland and Turkey.
The report states that women now make up, 
on average, more than two thirds of graduates 
in the humanities, arts, education and health 
studies but less than one third in mathematics 
and computer science and less than a quarter in 
engineering.
Education at a Glance followed the release last 
July of a report published by UNESCO and the 
OECD under the Programme for International 
Student Assessment (PISA) which showed that 
at age 15, girls were better readers than boys in 
every one of the 43 countries that took part in 
the study.

Forgotten emergencies
The United Nations has 
appealed for US$3 billion 
to help 45 million civilians 
struggling to survive in 21 
countries afflicted by disasters 
largely forgotten by the rest of 
the world. Seventeen of these 
“neglected crises” on the UN list 
are in Africa. 
Most of those in need are 
children, women and the 
elderly, said UN Secretary 
General Kofi Annan, launching 
the 2004 Humanitarian Appeal 
in November. Humanitarian 
aid, Mr Annan said, often 
by-passes those countries that 
need it most. For example, more 
than 90 percent of the amount 
requested for Iraq which, along 
with Afghanistan is not on the 
list, was funded, while countries 
like Burundi and Liberia had 
received less than 30 percent of 
the aid requested for them.

Cyber-elephants
E-governance – the 
use of information and 
communication technologies 
to improve citizen-
government interaction 
– can give birth to costly 
white elephants, according 
to a new United Nations 
study, UN World Public 
Sector Report 2003: 
E-Government at the 
Crossroads. About 91 percent 
of Member States are 
installing internet services, 
but the cost-effectiveness 
of “online government” 
is questioned in both 
developed and developing 
countries. Meanwhile, due 
to concern about security 
and privacy even among 
people with internet 
access, only one in five 
or fewer engage in online 
communication with a 
government. The UK tops 
the list of countries whose 
government has opened 
itself to interaction over 
cyberspace. The others, in 
order, are the USA, Canada 
and Chile (tie), Estonia, 
New Zealand, Philippines, 
France and the Netherlands 
(tie), Australia, Mexico 
and a 3-way tie between 
Argentina, Ireland and 
Sweden.
World military 
spending up
World military expenditure 
accelerated sharply in 
2002, increasing in real 
terms to US$894 billion in 
current prices, accounting 
for 2.5 percent of world 
GDP, or US$128 per capita, 
according to the Stockholm 
International Peace Research 
institute (SIPRI). This is an 
increase of 14 percent over 
the post-cold war low of 
1998, but is still 16 percent 
below the level 1988 when 
world military expenditure 
was at its peak.
The United States, China, 
India and Russia are the top 
spenders, when currencies 
are converted at purchasing 
parity rates, which reflect 
actual volume of goods 
and services that can be 
purchased in each country 
with its currency. SIPRI 
expects the upward trend to 
continue until at least 2009.

UNESCO | the new Courier | January 2004
WTO: agreement and discord
The World Trade Organization 
reached an agreement 
last August 30 (Geneva, 
Switzerland), that will make 
it easier for poor countries 
to import cheaper generic 
medicines to treat public 
health problems such as AIDS, 
tuberculosis, malaria and 
other epidemics.  
The agreement waives 
countries obligations under the 
WTO’s intellectual property 
agreement, which limited 
their ability to import cheaper 
medicines from countries 
where pharmaceuticals are 
patented. Hailed by and 
large as a great victory, it 
nonetheless drew some 
criticism over its administrative 
complexity. 
The agreement came just 
prior to the WTO meeting in 
Cancun, which had set itself 
the goal of freeing up markets 
in manufactured products, 
services and – especially 
– agriculture, and which ended 
in a deadlock. “In the end the 
ministers could not summon 
the necessary flexibility and 
political will to bridge the 
gaps that separated them,” 
said WTO Director-General 
Supachai Pantichpakdi. 
“Sadly, those that will suffer 
the most for their inability to 
compromise are the poorest 
countries among us.”
A dog’s life
“Man” has more in common with 
his “best friend” than he may have 
thought, according to the findings 
of two North American teams that 
have partially decrypted the genome 
of dogs. Of the 24,567 known genes 
found in people, 18,473 are also 
found in dogs. About 360 genetic 
problems known to dogs resemble 
those found in humans, giving 
researchers new leads for a better 
understanding of human health and 
behaviour.
Africa – 
Fashion boosts 
cultural identity
“Fashion as seen by 
African designers 
and their peers from 
the North” was the 
theme for the 4th 
International Festival 
of African Fashion 
(FIMA) held near 
Niamey on the Island 
of Boubon (Niger) 
from December 3 to 8. 
Over 40 designers from 
all corners of the world 
took part in this major 
celebration of African 
fashion. And on the 
programme were 
a host of activities 
including workshops 
on African textiles, 
peace, HIV/AIDS and 
the hereditary blood 
disease drepanocytosis, 
as well as African film 
nights, “culture shock” 
evenings, and crafts 
exhibitions, etc. 
FIMA was held for 
the first time in 1998 
on the initiative of 
Niger-born designer 
Alphadi, who wanted 
to make it a “place for 
conviviality, exchange, 
giving and receiving”, 
to “revive a sense of 
cultural identity”.
Species in the red
The poetic image of 
the solitary albatross, 
familiar to sailors in 
the Southern Ocean, 
may be taking on a 
more sinister meaning. 
According to the 
World Conservation 
Union (IUCN), all of 
the planet’s 21 species 
of albatross are now 
globally under threat, 
compared to 16 in 
the year 2000, mostly 
because they go for 
bait on long lines used 
to catch tuna. But the 
albatross is certainly 
not alone on the 
IUCN’s 2003 Red List of 
Threatened Species, just 
published. The latest 
update contains 12,259 
species of plant and 
animal threatened with 
extinction. Particularly 
vulnerable is the unique 
flora and fauna on 
islands such as Hawaii 
and the Galapagos, that 
is being decimated by 
alien species introduced 
by humans. The full list, 
too large to be printed, 
can be consulted at 
www.iucnredlist.org.

UNESCO | the new Courier | December 2003
Edgar Morin
For the French 
philosopher and 
sociologist, dialogue is 
only possible between 
individuals who 
recognize each other 
as subjects with the 
same dignity and the 
same rights. That is 
why he is pessimistic 
about our era, which 
he describes as marked 
by Manichaeism 
and a breakdown in 
understanding
Could you help us define the concept of “dialogue 
among civilizations”, or even the notion of “civilization”, 
particularly in contrast to “culture”?
◗ According to a classic distinction, proposed by 19th century 
German sociology, we call culture that which belongs to 
an ethnic group, a nation or community – in other words 
its customs, beliefs, mores, rites, celebrations, gods and 
myths…. Whereas civilization is what can be transmitted 
from one culture to another. For instance, potato farming 
was transmitted from Andean America to Europe and then 
to the rest of the world, just as the use of the plough started 
in one corner of the world and spread everywhere. In other 
words, civilization is technical and material: it is what can 
be passed on.
The idea of “dialogue among civilizations”, however, 
takes the word “civilization” more in the sense of “culture” 
 “Dialogue
assumes equality”

UNESCO | the new Courier | January 2004
because it makes reference to a set of distinct features that 
supposedly can’t be mixed. When we speak of dialogue 
between civilizations in its ordinary meaning, we think 
in a simplified way of western civilization, or Chinese, 
Islamic, Christian, Iranian, African and so on. Yet if I speak 
of Chinese civilization, I think of the Tao or Confucianism, 
which of course can circulate. And Islamic civilization, for 
instance, encompasses countries and populations who have 
different cultures, even if it can obviously spread elsewhere 
in the world. In short, civilization and culture are vague 
concepts and subject to uncertainty!
It seems to me, however, that what UNESCO means is “We 
are different, we have different beliefs and religions, but our 
unique characteristics should not prevent us from engaging 
in dialogue.”
What does it mean for a civilization to “dialogue”?
◗ From my point of view, civilizations or cultures do 
not dialogue. Only individuals can engage in dialogue. 
Those concerned are part a culture, they are open and 
can recognize the existence of the Other. By using our 
differences as a starting-point, they think we can find 
common ground and a common language – for example 
“We are all seeking peace.” If you take the medieval 
Christian world at the time of the Crusades, dialogue 
was not possible either with Muslims or Jews. With the 
fundamentalist Islamic fanatics of today, there is no dialogue 
possible either, because for them all others are “infidel 
dogs”. As soon as the Other becomes a wrongdoer or an 
infidel, dialogue becomes impossible.
And today, are Westerners open to dialogue?
◗ Right now, a Good Empire and an Evil Empire have been 
defined as such by those in power in the United States, while 
from Al-Qaeda’s point of view it’s the exact opposite. Each 
claims to represent Good while the other represents Evil. 
And Manichean situations make dialogue impossible.
Certain Westerners, however, who have studied other 
civilizations, think that Islam cannot be reduced to 
fundamentalism; it’s a great religion that had an eminently 
civilizing role in the past, particularly in the era of Baghdad, 
the califates and Andalusia. They point out furthermore 
that it was the only great civilization of the High Middle 
Ages, that there are several interpretations of Islam, and that 
even in the heart of the Islamic world there are partisans 
of secularity. As soon as you have diversity in a culture or 
a civilization, you have people who are ready for dialogue. 
Generally they are the least conformist minds, “deviant” 
minds, sometimes the mixed-breed products of several 
civilizations.

talking to
What is a “dialogue”?
◗ It’s when each person can set out his thesis, produce his 
arguments, and the other person is not prohibited from doing 
the same.
What are the conditions for dialogue?
◗ First of all, recognition of the Other as an interlocutor 
having rights equal to one’s own. Real dialogue is when 
you recognize the same dignity in the other. No dialogue is 
possible between a master and his slave. Dialogue assumes 
equality – which is a relatively new viewpoint in European 
culture! Western Europe dominated and exploited the world 
starting with the conquest of America; it practiced slave 
trading and slavery; it carried out the longest and harshest 
dominations in history. Yet in that same Europe, and perhaps 
as early as the conquest, deviant minds developed some 
of the key ideas that allow dialogue: it was Bartolomeo 
de Las Casas, Spanish priest, who said that the American 
indigenous people were humans like everyone else, and 
it was Montaigne who said we called other civilizations 
“barbarians”. It continued with Montesquieu who imagined a 
so-called Persian coming to examine France in the manner of 
an anthropologist brought up on human rights philosophy. In 
other words, Western Europe was simultaneously the home 
of domination and of ideas about emancipation. And it was 
by appropriating those ideas that colonized people were able 
to relatively obtain emancipation.
Philosopher 
   of complexity
◗ Philosopher and sociologist Edgar Morin is one of France’s 
leading contemporary thinkers. Born in Paris in 1921, he 
joined the Resistance during World War II. With university 
degrees in history, economics and law, he began his career in 
1950 at the CNRS (National Center for Scientific Research), 
with a particular concern for cross-disciplinary dialogue.
◗ He has concentrated on developing a method that can meet 
the challenge of the complexity of all modern knowledge, 
and reform politics and thought, in order to overcome the current 
global crisis. The five volumes of the “Method” – la Nature de 
la nature, la Vie de la vie, la Connaissance de la connaissance, 
Les idées, L’identité humaine – were published between 1977 
and 2001 by Seuil.
◗ His extensive body of work, translated into many languages, 
includes L’Homme et la Mort (Seuil, 1951); Introduction à 
une politique de l’homme (Seuil, 1965); L’Esprit du Temps (Grasset, 
1962-1976); Pour sortir du XXe siècle (Nathan, 1981); Les Sept 
savoirs nécessaire à l’éducation du futur (Seuil, 2000); “Seven 
Complex Lessons in Education for the Future” (UNESCO, 2001); 
Pour une politique de civilisation (Arléa, 2002).
◗ Among his other responsibilities, he is the President of 
UNESCO’s European Agency of Culture and holder of the itinerant 
UNESCO Edgar Morin Chair created in 1999 at the Universidad 
del Salvador in Argentina.

What are the obstacles to dialogue in today’s world?
◗ There is an obstacle when what is sacred for one is not 
sacred for the other. For example, a Muslim, a Christian 
and a Jew cannot have a dialogue to establish whether 
Jesus rose on the third day, Moses received the Ten 
Commandments, or Mohammed had a revelation from the 
Angel Gabriel. But we can recognize what is sacred for the 
Other and engage in dialogue, that is to say make progress 
in knowing the Other.
Those who dialogue are a minority, but they exist. Though 
when they are very few, it does not go far.
What is the difference between dialogue 
and negotiation?
◗ Negotiating is bargaining for interests, to reach an 
agreement. Whereas genuine dialogue is understanding 
the Other. To understand the Other, first we have to try and 
know him in his entirety, know his beliefs, his customs, 
his rites, his civilization – which presupposes erudition 
or a certain education. We must understand that the 
Other is a subject like oneself, meaning an autonomous 
individual who commands respect. Then you need the 
subjective impetus of interest and sympathy. Without that, 
there is no comprehension. Today we are in conditions of 
collective hysteria and Manichaeism that prevent sympathy 
and therefore understanding. We are in a period where 
understanding is losing ground because of the war and its 
consequences.
How can we encourage this impetus towards 
sympathy, which you refer to?
◗ Take the example of France and Germany who fought for 
a century and a half. In France, it was taught in schools that 
the Germans were brutes and in Germany that the French 
were worthless. After World War II, it was decided that 
history books should be revised and that the socio-centric 
vision should be replaced by a wider point of view. But 
on the other hand, today in Western Europe, we continue 
to obscure certain parts of history when we study this 
continent. We forget, for instance, that the Ottoman Empire 
went as far as Hungary and the former Yugoslavia and that 
it played a civilizing role for centuries. You have to have a 
background in history to sympathize with the Other.
In other words, many conditions must be fulfilled before 
engaging in dialogue. Certain individuals with a key role in 
the government or civil society can also facilitate the process 
by producing manuals and books helping us to understand 
others. Mutual understanding is a condition for dialogue. 
Do you agree with Huntington that after the 
Cold War a clash between Western civilization and 
Islamic civilization was unavoidable?
◗ No, it was avoidable. But I would say that today the clash 
is under way, even if it hasn’t really occurred yet. Several 
elements point to it. For example, until the intervention 
in Iraq, the kamikaze (suicide bomber) phenomenon was 
limited to a very small group of Palestinian militants from 
the Islamic Jihad. Now it’s spread to Iraq, where you also 
find another form of kamikaze behaviour, close to what 
existed in Japan during World War II: even people who are 
not fundamentalist believers are ready to sacrifice their lives 
for their country. As soon as we’re dealing with escalation 
of war, repression of terrorism and military terror, a vicious 
circle of hate, contempt, rejection and disgust emerges, and 
perhaps at that very moment a war between civilizations 
starts, which we must combat.
How can we fight?
◗ With words, intelligence and conscience. We know what 
principles we must respect: understanding others and 
recognizing their rights. There are periods, such as ours, in 
which very little dialogue is possible.  I think we are entering 
a dark period.

Retracing the ‘slave routes’
The talking drums of Accra University beat 
out a chill warning: Slave raiders are 
coming. Arise and flee. Quickly, quickly, quickly. 
Ghanian students were recalling for our cameras 
the days when – despite such real warnings – 
millions of Africans were seized and shipped to a 
life of bondage in the New World.
These so-called ‘Slave Routes’ stretched from 
the African interior to the coastal slave markets of 
present-day Angola, Benin, Ghana, and Senegal, 
then over the Atlantic to the islands of the 
Caribbean, coastal Brazil and the southern United 
States. 
We were retracing these routes – filming as we 
went – across West Africa as part of UNESCO’s 
Slave Route Project, and began our journey at 
Ouida in Benin. Now a sleepy coastal town, Ouida 
was an early center of the trans-Atlantic slave 
trade. A huge tree shades what once was a busy 
slave market, where slaves were auctioned off like 
cattle and then marched down a track to the sea 
shore.
Today modern memorials recalling the 
inhumanity of the slave trade line the route of the 
slaves’ last journey on African soil. And a large 
monument marks the spot where they were loaded 
onto ships for their trans-Atlantic crossing to the 
New World. It is known as the Gate of No Return.
Torn from their homeland, imprisoned, and 
shipped to a life of bondage in strange lands, slaves 
found strength in the spiritual and cultural 
traditions they carried with them. One of these was 
Capoeira – leaping and wheeling in stylized combat, 
and used by Africans enslaved in Brazil to practice 
fighting skills, unbeknownst to their masters, to the 
rhythm of drums. Another was Voodoo – a spiritual 
tradition that gave Africans courage to break the 
chains of bondage in the Caribbean. Many think 
Voodoo hails from Haiti, but it actually originated 
in West Africa, where the Fon peoples of Benin first 
called it ‘Voodoo’ meaning  ‘spirit’. 
COMBAT STYLE
Forced labor existed in all the civilizations of 
antiquity, but it was ancient Greece which first 
elevated slavery to the rank of an institution and 
reduced the slave to the status of merchandise. 
African slave trade was first organized by Arab 
merchants in the seventh century. Slaves were 
bought in the interior and sold in the slave 
markets of North Africa and Zanzibar.
Later Europeans used slaves to work plantations 
they established on islands in the Indian Ocean 
(Mauritius, Madagascar, Comoros) and the 
Atlantic (Sao Tome and Principe, Cape Verde). All 
this, however, was small scale compared to the 
veritable industry of the 15-1800s, when millions 
of Africans were shipped by European slave 
traders across the Atlantic to the colonies of the 
New World. 
The Slave Route is 
a key project for 
2004, proclaimed by 
the United Nations 
“International Year 
to Commemorate 
the Struggle 
against Slavery 
and Its Abolition”. 
The aim is to 
better understand 
and exchange 
information on the 
slave trade and 
preserve historic 
sites.

SLAVE RAIDS
Discovery of the Americas and need for labor to 
exploit their wealth further amplified the tragedy. 
Europeans and Africans themselves resorted to 
slave raiding. 
Among the most feared of the African slave 
raiders were the Amazons of the Fon king’s 
6000-strong female bodyguard, who specialized 
in capturing women and children. To escape the 
slave-raiding Fon, whose beliefs barred them 
from venturing into water, certain tribes fled 
to the safety of Lake Nokoue, in what is now 
southeast Benin. 
European slave traders included the British, 
The Roads, an idea making its way
Since UNESCO launched its 
“Silk Roads” programme in 
1988, the itinerary has continued 
to attract travellers. Not just 
merchandise circulated along the 
Silk Roads, which extended from 
the Mongol steppes to Istanbul by 
way of Almaty or Samarkand, but 
also ideas, techniques, arts and 
religions. They are the symbol of 
the fruitful exchanges between 
Europe and Asia for more than 
2000 years.
From 1988 to 1997, scientific 
expeditions, sponsorship of 
young scientists, seminars, 
press reports, publications and 
exhibitions have shown to what 
degree contemporary societies 
were shaped by these reciprocal 
influences. Today, a project aims 
to safeguard the heritage of the 
Silk Roads in Central Asia and 
China, and Kyrgyzstan has just 
approved a project for the High 
Tchui valley.
The concept of a road as a 
vector of cultural dialogue has 
inspired, notably, the “Slave 
Route” in 1994, and the “Iron 
Road” in 1995 (demonstrating 
that Africa created its own iron 
industry), as well as the “Routes 
of al-Andalus” and the “Roads of 
Faith”. The last is a programme of 
inter-faith dialogue that focuses 
on the cultural and spiritual 
ties between peoples created 
by religions and beliefs. It has 
instigated the creation of twelve 
UNESCO Chairs on Interreligious 
and Intercultural Dialogue in ten 
countries in Europe, around the 
Mediterranean and in Central 
Asia.

Dutch, French, Portuguese and Spanish, and, to a 
lesser extent, Germans and Scandinavians. They 
set off with shiploads of cheap wares, which they 
bartered for black slaves who were re-sold at 
considerable profit in the New World. Afterwards 
they sailed back to their home ports with cargoes 
of valuable products of slave labor such as 
sugar, tobacco and cotton. The fortunes of many 
European ports were built on this triangular trade. 
To protect their spheres of interest in West 
Africa, rival European powers built coastal 
forts and castles. At the peak of the slave trade, 
Ghana’s Atlantic coast was crowded with over 
50 such fortifications. One of them, Cape Coast 
Castle, is today a major attraction for tourists, 
many of them African-Americans, who file 
through the dank dungeons where slaves were 
crammed before their voyage. 
The Senegalese island of Goree, one of the 
main shipment centres of the West African slave 
trade, is also much visited. It is said that eleven 
million Africans passed through Goree enroute to 
the New World.

SCARS AND LEGACIES
Although slavery was officially abolished about 
150 years ago, legacies of the slave trade remain. 
The discrimination black peoples suffer results 
largely from racism developed to justify and 
sustain trans-Atlantic slavery. Inevitably there is 
considerable disagreement about the cause and 
effect of the slave trade. And retracing the Slave 
Routes across West Africa, I realised that healing 
the scars inflicted by an ordeal that lasted for 
centuries is going to be a long and difficult 
process.
John Lawton
With Arab, African, Indian and European 
influences, Zanzibar’s Stone Town illustrates the 
island’s exceptional cultural fusion
Anchored in the Indian Ocean 
off Africa’s east 
coast, Zanzibar, an island state within the 
United Republic of Tanzania, is an ethnic and 
architectural expression of a unique meeting 
place, mixing the cultures of Africa, the Arab 
region, India and Europe over more than a 
millennium. This is particularly visible in 
Zanzibar’s old Stone Town. Designating it a World 
Heritage site in 2000, UNESCO described it as “an 
outstanding material manifestation of cultural 
fusion and harmonization”. As gateway to East 
Africa and turning point in trade between Africa 
and Asia, Zanzibar brought together migrants, 
traders, conquerors and slaves.
Africans, Arabs, Indians, Persians, Portuguese, 
Dutch and English met and mingled here and 
left behind a hybrid civilization characterized by 
a distinctive stone architecture, a rich, eclectic 
cuisine, and a diverse population that introduced 
the words of many nations into Kiswahili, a 
language of Bantu origin. 
BLENDING AFRICA AND OMAN
The majority of the population of Zanzibar is of 
Bantu (African) stock. They first arrived on the 
island as migrants as early as the first century AD; 
snatched their first black slave, a small boy that 
Portuguese explorers took back to Lisbon to 
amuse their king.
The beginning of the end of slavery also 
occurred on former French soil, with an 
uprising of slaves led by Boukman, a Voodoo 
priest, in Bois Caiman, in the French colony of 
San Domingue, on the night of August 22-23, 
1791. In commemoration, August 23 has been 
chosen by the United Nations as the date of the 
International Day for the Remembrance of the 
Slave Trade and its Abolition.

others were brought much later as slaves. 
Swahili, meaning “coast,” is the name given 
to people of mixed Bantu and Omani Arab 
origin and it is their culture and language that 
dominate Zanzibar society today.  Similar to the 
Swahili are the Shirazi, who are likewise of part 
Bantu extraction, but mixed with Persian rather 
than Omani blood. The Shirazi Persians landed 
in Zanzibar in 975, fleeing – it is said – from 
a prophesized disaster in their homeland. A 
considerable number of Indian peoples remain on 
Zanzibar, as well as a sizeable population from 
the Comoros Islands. Europeans are noticeably 
small in number considering their position as 
colonial rulers of the island for several centuries.
The Arabs, who are still numerous, arrived in 
Zanzibar in the 8th century, riding the monsoon 
winds from Oman to trade in ivory, slaves 
and gold on the East African coast. The island 
provided an easily-defended base from where it 
was possible to control 1,000 miles of mainland 
from present-day Mozambique to Somalia.
SUPPLY POINT ON THE ROUTE
TO INDIA 
From the 15th to the 17th century, the Portuguese 
used Zanzibar as a supply point for their sea 
routes to India, and in the mid-18th century 
the Dutch arrived in search of slaves for their 
plantations in the East Indies. Later, Indian traders

came to buy spices and ivory. The Omani Arabs 
regained control of the islands in the 19th century, 
and in 1832, Sultan Sayyid Said moved his 
Sultanate from Muscat to Zanzibar where he and 
his descendants ruled for over 130 years.
CENTRE OF THE ANTI-SLAVERY 
MOVEMENT
 Zanzibar was of great symbolic importance 
in the slave trade. It was both one of the main 
slave-trading ports in East Africa – by the1860s 
between 10,000 and 30,000 slaves a year were 
passing through – and also the base from which 
slavery’s opponents such as David Livingstone 
conducted their campaign against it, particularly 
beginning in 1890 when the island became a 
British Protectorate.
Spices gradually replaced slaves as the main 
product handled on Zanzibar’s markets. Cloves 
were introduced after British and French botanists 
broke the Dutch monopoly, and today Zanzibar is 
one of the world’s main suppliers. 
It is also an increasingly popular tourist 
destination, offering idyllic beaches and a spicy 
cuisine.

ENDANGERED HERITAGE
With the help of UNESCO and other like-minded 
organizations the unique architecture of 
Zanzibar’s Stone Town is being restored. It is a 
chaotic labyrinth of winding streets lined with 
whitewashed coral-rag houses. There are endless 
little shops, busy bazaars, caravanserais and 
courtyards, fortresses, former sultans’ palaces and 
faded colonial mansions, two huge cathedrals, 
many mosques and a Hindu temple - all crammed 
into an area of one-square-mile.
This outstanding example of architectural 
heritage, however, is also a living city with 
extreme poverty. Over 50 percent of the buildings 
of Stone Town are public housing, mainly for 
very poor families. This poverty is a key factor 
in the problem of degradation facing the Stone 
Town. Neither the residents nor the authorities 
administering the buildings have the means to 
restore or generally even maintain these multi-
family dwellings.    
Community-based rehabilitation programmes 
are helping to save some crumbling housing 
assets, whilst directly improving the lives of the 
disadvantaged with better living conditions. This 
is an end in itself, and a means to an end: Stone 
Town’s architectural heritage is being preserved, 
as well as the future of tourism.

Breaking the silence in schools
Where can children read all about 
the Isle of Gorée, inscribed on 
the World Heritage List? Or about 
Boukman, catalyst of the Haitian 
revolution?  Certainly not in 
textbooks, which tend to neglect 
the history of the slave trade. To 
fill this gap, UNESCO launched 
the “Breaking the Silence” project 
in 1998, through its Associated 
Schools Project Network (ASPnet) 
within the framework of the Slave 
Route.
The educational project, financed 
by Norway, is underway in 100 
secondary schools in about 
20 countries on the European, 
African and American continents. 
In the last five years, training 
seminars for teachers, educational 
and cultural exchanges between 
students, teaching staff and 
officials, and partnerships have 
multiplied. Memorial sites such as 
ports and plantations have hosted 
some 20 international youth 
meetings.
Each school receives educational 
kits. The 2002 version contained 
the first two volumes of a trilogy 
developed by a scientific research 
committee, based on documents 
from the period.  In “Voices of 
Slaves”, those who were torn 
from their homeland testify about 
their lives and struggle, while 
“Voyages of Slaves” focuses on 
the origins and effects of the slave 
trade. The final volume, “Visions 
of Slaves”, will come out in 2004. 
“We hope that this material will 
be widely distributed. We will 
in any case make it available to 
any country interested,” says 
Elizabeth Khawajkie, international 
coordinator of ASPnet. In 
2004, International Year to 
Commemorate the Struggle 
against Slavery and its Abolition, 
“Breaking the Silence” will be 
particularly active, organizing 
notably an International Youth 
Forum.

Haitians, most of whom are descendents of 
African slaves, and Dominicans, whose ancestors 
were Spanish settlers, have a hard time shedding 
stereotypes about each other  
Haitians and Dominicans:
two peoples, one island
The Slave Route in Haiti
“The Slave Route project, 
launched by UNESCO in Benin 
in 1994, is slow in taking form 
in Haiti due to lack of political 
will,” laments Laënnec Hurbon, 
coordinator for Haiti of the 
project’s International Scientific 
Committee. Some projects are 
nonetheless ongoing, such as, 
since 2001, the UNESCO Chair 
on the history of slavery and the 
slave trade and oral traditions at 
the University of Port-au-Prince, 
which he directs with historian 
Michel Hector.  The chair’s 
purpose, he says, is to “revive 
historical research and teaching 
of history, very neglected on the 
island.”
A tourist itinerary is being 
developed, based on the 
inventory, study and rehabilitation 
of about 50 colonial buildings and 
significant sites. The most famous 
is Bois-Caïman, in northern Haiti 
near Morne-Rouge, where in 
1791 a group of slaves led by the 
voodoo priest Boukman made 
a pledge to expel the colonists. 
Plans for a museum are also 
under consideration.
Since the first international 
conference focusing on the 
revolt in 1997, International Day 
for the Remembrance of the 
Slave Trade and its Abolition, 
August 23, is marked every year 
with presentations in secondary 
schools by French and African 
historians. The Haitian revolution, 
which brought about the island’s 
independence on January 1, 1804, 
will be celebrated throughout 
2004, proclaimed by the United 
Nations “International Year to 
Commemorate the Struggle 
against Slavery and Its Abolition”.
“I’ve always wanted to live in the 
Dominican Republic,” says Mimi, 
a generously-shaped Haitian woman with a 
dazzling smile. Her husband, Charles, a slender 
Dominican, is sitting in the patio of their sheet-
metal house in the new quarter of Dajabon, a 
Dominican border town. “I don’t feel any racism 
here,” she says. 
“We decided to get married just 11 days after we 
met,” says Charles. Ten years ago, Mimi spotted 
him while she was doing her laundry in the river 
at Ouanaminthe, a neighboring Haitian town. 
That day, he crossed the border to visit some 
aunts who had moved back to Haiti after the 
1937 massacre in which 10,000 to 20,000 Haitians 
living in the Dominican Republic lost their lives. 
Sharing the same island, formerly called 
Hispaniola, Dominicans and Haitians do their 
best to live with a long history of conflict. In 
1937, the Dominican dictator Trujillo ordered the 
slaughter of Haitians living in his country. Much 
earlier, Haiti’s Toussaint Louverture and, in 1855, 
Emperor Soulouque occupied their neighbor’s 
land. Those events have left bitter memories on 
the island.

In 1777, the Europeans split Hispaniola in half. 
The French populated the western part (which 
later became Haiti) with African slaves, while 
the Spanish brought farmers over from their 
homeland to settle the eastern part (the present-
day Dominican Republic). 
HALF-GODS AND GODESSES
Haiti and its African population forged their 
identity by overthrowing the French in 1794,” says 
sociologist Laënnec Hurbon, director of research 
at the Centre National Français de la Recherche 
Scientifique (CNRS) and holder of the UNESCO 
Chair on the slave trade and slavery in Port-au-
Prince. “In contrast, the Dominican Republic was 
built in opposition to Haiti and the threat of the 
island’s ‘Africanization’, especially embodied by 
Voodoo worship, which the Dominicans called 
cannibalism and witchcraft.” During election 
campaigns some politicians make no bones about 
advocating the “whitening” of the Dominican 
population, boasting about their descent from 
the indios, as the island’s earliest occupants 
are called. But Dominican history and culture 
definitely bear the stamp of African influence. For 
example, there is a Dominican brand of Voodoo 
with its “half-gods and goddesses”. Likewise, 
raras – Haitian music groups with ties to the 
voodoo spirits – are highly popular on Dominican 
streets during Lent.
People near the border on both sides often live 
as though they are citizens of the same country. 
Mixed godparents, spiritual ties, mixed marriages 
and semi-bilingualism are common, as the 
example of Mimi and Charles shows. On the feast 
days of patron saints, parishioners think nothing 
of crossing the border to go to mass and dance. 
“We eat and sleep together here,” says Antonio 
Vixima, a member of Ouanaminthe’s Sant 
pon Ayiti, an organization that brings the two 
peoples together. That group and its Dominican 
counterpart, Centro Puente, are campaigning to 
end violence.
But stereotypes die hard. Some Haitians say 
Dominicans are sneaky, bloodthirsty thieves. 
Dominicans consider newly arrived Haitians 
illiterate menial laborers, immediately saddling 
them with nicknames like kongo, brujo (witch) 
or rayano – because of the rays or stripes that 
the fence separating the island’s two states 
supposedly leaves on their clothes. A severely 
lopsided economic situation provides fertile 
ground for those clichés. 
RACIST STEREOTYPES
Drawn by the prospects of a job and a better life, 
an estimated 500,000 to one million Haitians 
are living on Dominican soil. Many are seasonal 
agricultural workers who never went home. Those 
who entered the country illegally are sometimes 
forcibly repatriated in unacceptable conditions, 
says an organization called Kadret. The people 
running the Welcoming Committee in the 
southern town of Thiotte say that mothers have 
been sent back to Haiti before they had time to 
fetch their children.
Compounded by racist stereotypes, those 
irregular situations weaken the migrants and 
engender a state violence that human rights 
organizations like the Refugee and Repatriated 
Citizens Support Group often condemn. “When

groups are usually named after Haitians who 
died while crossing the border. In Ouanaminthe, 
the memory of the deadly machine-gun attack 
on a truck of illegal immigrants that occurred 
80 kilometers away is still fresh in everybody’s 
mind. That town’s committee is named after Elie 
Jean Baptiste, a young Haitian who was shot to 
death two years ago because he did not have five 
pesos to bribe the border guard. 
Groups promoting harmony between the 
two nations have recently scored some points. 
“Guilty soldiers stationed at the border might 
be dismissed or transferred,” says the Haitian 
consul in Dajabon. Several years ago, a joint 
governmental commission on migration issues 
was set up, also raising hopes. But with growing 
numbers of young Haitians attending Dominican 
high schools and universities, it may be necessary 
to wait until the next generation to see a genuine 
improvement in relations between the two parts 
of the island.

The Abolitions of Slavery
From L.F. Sonthonax to 
Victor Schoelcher
1793, 1794, 1848
Edited by Marcel Dorigny, 
University of Paris VIII
Translated from the French
The anti-slavery movement, 
which followed in the wake 
of the European slave trade, 
has attracted much less 
attention than the latter. 
This is particularly true for 
the abolition movement in 
the French colonies. This 
volume commemorates the 
first abolition of slavery, 
proclaimed by Léger Félicité 
Sonthonax in Saint-Domingue 
in 1793 and ratified by 
a decree of the National 
Convention in 1794, vividly 
portraying the complex 
developments that led to 
the decree of 1848, which 
permanently abolished slavery 
in the French domains. It 
also represents the first 
critical evaluation of the state 
of research in France into 
the history of eradication 
of colonial slavery. Finally, 
this volume also contains 
an important comparative 
element through the addition 
of papers focusing on the 
abolitionist movements in 
America, Britain and Spain.

From Chains to Bonds
The Slave Trade Revisited
Edited by Doudou Diène
Translated from the French
Most important issues of 
today’s world – such as 
development, human rights, 
and cultural pluralism – bear 
the unmistakable stamp 
of the trans-Atlantic slave 
trade. In particular Africa’s 
state of development can 
only be properly understood 
in light of the widespread 
dismantling of African 
societies and the methodical 
and lasting human 
bloodletting to which the 
continent was subjected by 
way of the trans-Saharan 
and trans-Atlantic slave 
trade over the centuries. 
But the greatest human 
displacement in history also 
transformed the vast geo-
cultural area of the Americas 
and the Caribbean.
In this volume, part of 
UNESCO’s project “Memory 
of Peoples: The Slave 
Route”, scholars and 
thinkers from Africa, the 
Americas, Europe, and 
the Caribbean have come 
together to raise some 
crucial questions and offer 
new perspectives on debate 
that have lost none of their 
urgency.

The merits of
‘useless’ science
Since 1964 the International Centre for 
Theoretical Physics has been a hothouse 
for scientific talent from developing 
countries
The Abdus Salam International Centre 
for Theoretical Physics, in Trieste 
(Italy) has a reputation for doing 
world-class science. And yet most of its research 
is, deliberately, ‘useless’. At least at first view.
As Erio Tosatti, former acting-director of ICTP 
and a professor at the nearby International 
School for Advanced Studies (SISSA) explains, 
“All of the non-trivial advances are made by 
very clever inputs that may have been borrowed 
from theoretical physics and mathematics.” A 
good example would be the search engines we 
use to surf the internet. “It’s not just an increase 
in computing power,” he explains, “there is 
some very clever maths involved.” And, after 
all, the World Wide Web itself originated within 
the physics community not so far away from 
Trieste, at the European Organization for Nuclear 
Research (CERN) near Geneva (Switzerland).
There was a logic, based on experience, that led 
Abdus Salam to choose theoretical physics and 
maths as the backbone for a high-level institute 
dedicated to scientists from developing countries. 
“Mathematics is the key instrument. It’s crucial,” 
says Tosatti, “yet it is the cheapest.  You can dive 
right in. In Africa, it’s the main thing we can do 
that makes a difference. The people who come 
here from developing countries are like heroes in 
their own country - though they may not look like 
heroes!”
“It’s the environment that is missing in 
developing countries, not just the equipment,” 
adds Tosatti. And ICTP has none of the glum, 
nerdy feel its name may conjure to non-scientists.  
Its modern, beautifully equipped buildings are 
nestled on a wooded hillside overlooking the 
Adriatic. It rubs shoulders with the resplendent 
Miramare Castle and gardens built by Archduke 
Ferdinand Maximilian, when Trieste was still part 
of the Austrian empire. “The atmosphere is very 
informal,” says Iranian-born Seifallah Randjbar-
Daemi, head of the ICTP high energy physics 
group. “We don’t wear ties, we’re all on first 
name terms, and our office doors are open. I’ve 
been to many universities and this is one of the 
unique places open to anyone regardless of race 
or religion. Yet it is 100 percent tension-free. There 
are so many people, from so many backgrounds, 
sitting together in the cafeteria. Everyone is

As Indian-
born Katepalli 
R.Sreenivasan was 
settling in as the new 
director of ICTP earlier 
this year, he made 
a point of talking to 
everyone, 
from senior staff to 
young diploma students, to find out 
what was working and what might 
need to change after 30 years of 
operation. His first diagnosis was 
frank: “good 
but we could do better.”
“I would like us to spend some 
time seeing how we can become 
more effective,” he explained. 
“ICTP spends a lot of its resources 
on many things, but it’s not clear to 
me that they’re all as effective as 
they are intended to be.” And he 
singled out the associate scheme 
(see below) which is at the core 
of ICTP’s efforts to overcome 
the isolation of scientists from 
developing countries, as a 
candidate for improvement. 
“Some of them come here and, 
after a year, they go back to their 
own country. Quite contrary to 
what ICTP intended, they may just 
disappear into the thick of things. 
We should be encouraging them 
to somehow form groups around 
themselves and multiply their 
effect. This is the only way ICTP 
can be useful.”
“There is a ‘string theory’ group in 
Bombay that is really very good,” 
he says.” Many of them were and 
still are associated with ICTP, and 
they somehow came together. This 
is like a mother institution and the 
children have to be let go at some 
time to do well on their own.”
“I’d also like to involve high 
school teachers in ICTP. If they 
get excited about some aspect 
of mathematics for example, they 
can pass on their enthusiasm to 
their students. Over a 20-year 
period, this could change the 
landscape of Africa, where 
science education needs a boost.”
The late Nobel Laureate, Abdus Salam, 
of Pakistan, founded the International 
Centre for Theoretical Physics, in 
Trieste, Italy, in 1964. One of its prime 
objectives was to provide world-class 
research facilities for scientists from 
the developing world, to help stem the 
brain drain and overcome the isolation 
that makes it hard for them to work 
productively in their home countries. 
About 80,000 scientists from 170 
countries have visited the centre in the 
past four decades.
Renamed in 1996, after its founder’s 
death, the Abdus Salam International 
Centre for Theoretical Physics has 
three main research groups: in 
condensed matter physics, high 
energy and astroparticle physics, 
and mathematics. These groups 
have 16 permanent staff scientists, 
six long-term senior visitors and 27 
post-doctoral fellows. Each year these 
groups host about 500 visitors from 
all over the world for training and 
collaboration. They also organize some 
20 workshops and conferences for 
about 700 participants. Other smaller 
groups include: a microprocessor 
laboratory, a physics of weather 
and climate group, and synchrotron 
radiation related physics.
Each year the centre selects between 
50 and 150 associates from a pool of 
1,000 candidates. Those selected may 
come to ICTP three times in a six-
year period. 
ICTP is administered through a tri-
partite agreement between UNESCO, 
the International Atomic Energy Agency 
(IAEA) and the Italian government. 
In 1996 UNESCO took over as lead 
administrator from IAEA, although 85 
percent of the annual budget comes 
from the Italian government – about 
$18 million a year.
World-class research
talking about a clash of civilizations. But they’re 
all eating together – Jews, Muslims, Christians.” 
And, after all, the food (and coffee) is Italian, 
which also helps.
“This indicates to me that education is 
important,” says Randjbar-Daemi. “The more 
tolerant people are, the less prejudices they have. 
They may have radically opposed opinions, but 
they talk in a civilized way. During the Cold 
War, this was one of the first places that Soviet 
scientists met colleagues from the West, especially 
the USA. They used to come with a group of 
‘watchers’. ICTP is a model of collaboration run 
with a very small budget, with amazing impact. 
The Italians have been very generous. Italy is 
known all over the world through Trieste and 
ICTP.  Ex-students become ministers of science. 
They think of themselves as part Italian.”
But this is no playground, either. ICTP regularly 
figures in the top 20 for the number of times its 
research papers are cited by other authors (the 
main barometer of significant science), which 
puts it alongside Harvard University.

produce something that is mathematically 
complex (like language) we should, in principle, 
be capable of learning the code that expresses this 
complexity (mathematics). He therefore feels we 
may have the same kind of propensity to learn 
mathematics as we do for language. “People are 
stronger than they know,” he says. 
Tráng is also convinced that a grounding 
in mathematics is essential for everyone, 
providing not just basic numeracy, but tools for 
thought. “In developing countries the need for 
mathematics is so great that the idea of asking 
what’s the use of it is stupid. We’re not at the 
level of having too many mathematicians. We 
won’t be there for 50 to 100 years. But a country 
without mathematics has no soul. There is no 
science or technology without mathematics. And 
training in mathematics is comparatively cheap. 
A mathematician can be trained to become a 
biologist or another type of scientist, yet it’s not 
so easy to do the converse,” he says. But, he adds, 
not just any kind of mathematics will do. “There 
are mathematicians in Vietnam, for example,” 
he explains, “but they have been trained in a 
fairly backward way, like 19th century French 
mathematics for engineers. It doesn’t fit any more 
for a lot of purposes.” 
Language of the universe?
Talking about high-level mathematics 
with Lê Dung Tráng is a bit like 
trying to improvise with jazzman, John Coltrane. 
If you’ve got the language and the skills, you can 
fly very high. If not, you can feel on the outside of 
something you only think you understand.
“Mathematicians can still communicate 
 from one speciality to another, which is rare in 
other fields,” explains Tráng, head of mathematics 
at the ICTP, “but it’s hard to explain anything to 
an outsider. If I wanted you to see a problem I am 
working on, I would have to explain it to you for 
a long time, reduce it to concepts you could grasp. 
Each step might be very easy, but the whole 
process needs years of training.”
This idea of “understanding the code” crops up 
often for Tráng. And not only regarding maths. 
Yet, like Molière’s Monsieur Jourdain, who is 
delighted to learn he has been speaking prose 
most of his life, Tráng believes that, with training, 
we are all capable of a kind of mathematical 
competence. “The structure of language, for 
example, is already mathematically very complex. 
And even the most retarded person can express 
himself in a logical way.” And if we can already 
Mathematics knows no 
borders, even if cultures can put 
their stamp on it

For Lê Dung Tráng 
a country without 
mathematics has no 
soul
Since 1972 Tráng has been returning every 
year to his native Vietnam to teach mathematics. 
But, he says “as time goes on, I feel they need 
me less as an individual.” In France, where he 
has spent most of his academic life, he says, an 
individual “can give a lecture and then a group 
of young people get excited and may even create 
a new school of thought. This happened to me.” 
But in a country like Vietnam, the needs are more 
fundamental. “You need to enlarge the base. At 
the beginning there were very few students I 
could train to become teachers or researchers. 
Now they have all made their careers and most 
are more important than I am.”
A DELICATE ALCHEMY
And for Tráng, there is something noble about 
being a teacher. “As a student, in my group, 
we were very keen on seeing the merit of the 
one who shows the way.” And he is proud 
to be able to trace his own lineage directly 
back to the late Renaissance mathematicians 
Galileo and Descartes, via great contemporary 
mathematicians, like Thom, Grothendieck and 
Hironaka, who taught him at the Sorbonne in 
Paris in the 1960’s. “It’s a very delicate alchemy,” 
he says. “To begin with, you need interesting 
teachers, and that is not easy in developing 
countries. But one is enough. And then you need 
the student to meet the teacher. This teacher 
doesn’t have to be a famous mathematician, but 
one who likes maths.”
But if mathematics may be a universal 
C

 n

language for science, 
Tráng believes it is 
nevertheless influenced by 
culture.“Different countries 
have different ways of 
doing mathematics,” he 
says. “The Vietnamese, for 
example, have a keenness 
for abstraction, like the 
Romanians. The French have a very different 
way of understanding abstraction compared 
to the British. Mexico is strong in analytic 
geometry, India in the theory of numbers, China 
in differential geometry. Every country also has a 
different way of seeing the relationship between 
mathematics and the rest of their culture. Most 
people think mathematics is something absolute. 
But that’s basically wrong.” 
 “Myself, I grew up in two different cultures. 
And as a kid I couldn’t understand that it made 
any difference. When I was older I realized 
that a lot of people couldn’t understand what I 
could. I thought there was something wrong with 
me. Little by little I realized it was a matter of 
understanding the cultural code.  Later on, when 
I went to Vietnam with people who knew nothing 
about developing countries, I was surprised by 
their reaction. Even if a developing country looks 
poor and powerless, it still has its own power. But 
without the cultural code, they just can’t see it. 
They only see the kind of power they are used to, 
like the power of machines.”
Peter Coles
Sandro Scandolo has 
proven the adage that 
“time is money”. By 
leading the effort to 
connect 80 Pentium PCs 
running at 2 GHz in a high 
speed network, he has 
helped ICTP develop a 
parallel computer that is 
as fast as the fastest 
supercomputer was two 
years ago. And for about a 
tenth of the price.  
According to Moore’s Law, 
computing capacity 
doubles every 18-24 
months. “And two years is 
nothing on the scale of 
scientific research,” says 
Scandolo. On the staff of 
ICTP’s condensed matter 
group, Scandolo is using 
the new computer facility 
to carry out simulations of 
the conditions inside 
planets, including Earth. 
With pressures running at 
a million atmospheres and 
temperatures of 5,000°C 
near the Earth’s core, 
scientists were using 
nuclear explosions, 
earthquakes and firing 
bullets at targets to try to 
replicate these conditions 
before fast computer 
simulations became 
feasible. Colleagues at 
ICTP will be using the 
parallel computer to study 
climate change, while 
others, like postgraduate 
student, Van Wellington 
Elloh, from Ghana, are 
predicting the behaviour 
of materials that don’t 
even exist yet, like 
intelligent fibres that could 
put computing power into 
our clothes.

ICTP’s sister organization in Trieste, 
the Third World Academy of Sciences (TWAS) 
is 20 years old, and celebrated last October 
in Beijing (China). 
With a $750,000 grant from the Global 
Environment Facility, a new project is concentrating 
on 20 least developed countries, via the Third World 
Network of Science Organizations (TWNSO), an 
NGO set up by TWAS to unite research councils, 
science ministries and heads of science academies 
in developing countries around the theme of 
sustainable economic development. Under the 
rubric “sharing innovative experiences”, TWNSO 
commissions case studies on practical development 
themes, like managing water resources, conservation 
and use of indigenous and medicinal plants, and 
the biodiversity of dry lands.  “We challenged the 
scientific community in the South,” explains Hassan. 
“We drew up a list of areas in which we were 
looking for excellence and picked a few. It’s one of 
our major tasks and it will continue.”
TWAS also hosts the Third World Organization 
for Women in Science, that provides some 60 
women Ph.D. students from developing countries 
with grants to complete their studies. “They can 
go anywhere in the South,” explains Hassan. “Half 
are in South Africa, but others are in India, Brazil, 
Malaysia and China, usually through a ‘sandwich’ 
system, whereby they register at a university in 
their home country, go away for six months at a 
time, then return home. The number of applicants 
is huge. Many are excellent. It’s one of our most 
rewarding programmes.”
Peter Coles
“Twas a sweet marriage, and 
we prosper well…”
(Shakespeare, The Tempest)
For Executive Director Mohammed H.A.
Hassan, the objectives of TWAS 
haven’t changed since a group of eminent 
scientists from developing countries, under the 
leadership of Abdus Salam, set it up in 1983: to 
encourage excellence in science, support young 
scientists, promote South/South and North/
South cooperation in science, and to use science 
and technology to solve practical problems in 
developing countries.
But if the objectives haven’t changed, the means 
have evolved. “Now we’re concentrating on the 
least developed countries,” explains Hassan. “We 
were finding that we were giving little support 
to the very poor. So we’ve turned it round. 
We’re using the strength of the more successful 
(developing) countries to open up their labs. 
We’ve created a list of 600 centres of excellence in 
over 100 countries. We sign agreements with them 
so that they receive scientists from the very poor 
countries and pay for them. It’s a joint UNESCO/
TWAS project, with UNESCO paying for travel 
and subsistence. It’s just like the ICTP associate 
programme but it all takes place in developing 
countries.”
ICTP’s Alexei Smirnov is a 
happy man. Last year, after some 
20 years of efforts, independent 
experiments proved that his 
contribution to the theory of 
neutrinos was right, earning 
Raymond Davis and Masatoshi 
Koshiba the Nobel Prize for 
physics. 
Neutrinos are sub-atomic 
particles with almost no mass. 
The Sun’s core produces countless 
billions of them, all the time, 
through nuclear fusion. It takes 
about eight minutes for one to fly 
the 150 million kilometres from 
the Sun’s core to earth, where 
some 60 billion neutrinos hit every 
square centimetre every second. 
But when they get here, they 
just pass right through, which 
makes them exceptionally hard 
to detect. In the 1960’s Davis built 
a massive pool containing 615 
tons of dry-cleaning fluid, 1.5 km 
underground in a disused gold 
mine, to spot their passage. And 
over a 30-year period, he found 
evidence of just six or so a month. 
A triumph, given how elusive 
these little particles are – except 
that this was about a third the 
number that theory predicted. 
Which is where Smirnov and his 
colleagues stepped in.
In 1985, Stanislav Mikheyev 
and Alexei Smirnov added to 
an existing theory developed by 
Lincoln Wolfenstein that there are 
three different kinds (“flavours”) 
of neutrino, corresponding to the 
three kinds of charged “lepton” 
particles (electrons, muons and 
tau) that were already known to 
exist. The researchers suggested 
that, in their passage from the sun, 
the neutrinos were converting 
(oscillating) from one “flavour” 
to another.  This, they said, would 
explain the “deficit” between 
observation and theory, because 
the detectors were set up mainly 
to detect electron neutrinos.

instance, might say ‘we have ten Tutsis here in 
the class. If four of them were killed, how many 
would we have left?’”
Education is often put forward as a panacea, 
and few would contest its importance in shaping 
citizens to play an effective part in their societies. 
But education, says researcher Sobhi Tawil of 
UNESCO’s International Bureau of Education, is 
also “an inherently ideological instrument that is 
related to political violence in both intended and 
unintended ways.” 
A recent report by Unicef, identifies several 
ways in which education is and has been 
manipulated negatively. These include denying 
access to education to certain groups, or using it 
to suppress their language and cultural values; 
segregated education that maintains inequality; 
the destruction or forced closure of schools; 
“The 
one thing I kept hearing 
from young prisoners in 
Northern Ireland,” says 
Professor Alan Smith, from Ulster University’s 
School of Education, “was a damning indictment 
of their education. Young men, just out of their 
teens and already serving time for murder would 
tell me ‘my school, my teachers, my textbooks 
did not give me the means to challenge what they 
were saying. I thought I was being told the truth. I 
later learnt that I wasn’t’.” 
“In Rwanda, before the genocide, segregation 
at school took a number of forms,” says John 
Rutaysire, director of the country’s National 
Curriculum Development Centre. “Pupils’ files 
identified them as Hutu, Tutsi or Twa. History 
and civics teaching reinforced social divisions 
by emphasizing ‘ethnicity’. A maths teacher, for 
Education often fuels 
conflicts, just as it can help 
to resolve them. A group

manipulation of textbooks for political purposes; 
and the inculcation of attitudes of superiority, for 
example, in the way that peoples or nations are 
described.
These characteristics have all been present in 
the education systems of seven countries that 
have been wracked over past decades by terrible 
civil wars - Bosnia and Herzegovina, Guatemala, 
Lebanon, Mozambique, Northern Ireland, Rwanda 
and Sri Lanka. They are all now involved in a 
research project being carried out by UNESCO’s 
International Bureau of Education in Geneva. 
Under the project, researchers and education 
authorities in each of these countries put their 
education systems under the microscope, 
searching out the teaching techniques, the 
textbook content, the structural characteristics 
and educational policies that may have fuelled the 
Sarajevo 1993.

bloody conflicts arising among 
their populations. 
In Northern Ireland, for 
example, segregation is a 
fundamental feature of the 
conflict and the education 
system: 95 percent of children 
attend either Catholic or 
Protestant schools. “Education 
planners began questioning this 
in the 1960s and 70s, but change 
has been difficult to bring 
about,” says Michael Arlow, 
formerly of the Citizenship 
Council for the Curriculum, 
Examinations and Assessment in 
Northern Ireland. 
Segregation is also one 
of the main characteristics 
of education in Bosnia and 
Herzegovina, where children 
attend Croat, Bosniac or Serb 
schools and follow three 
different curricula, administered 
by 13 different education 
authorities in the different cantons. “In BiH, each 
education authority is able to promote a culturally 
inappropriate curriculum, unregulated by any 
agreed curriculum standards,” thus reinforcing 
ethnic divisions explains Phillip Stabback, 
former Interim Director of Education with the 
Organization for Security and Cooperation in 
Europe’s mission to Bosnia and Herzegovina. He 
tells of an incident where Bosniac children were 
refused access to a neighbourhood Serb school. 
After intervention by the authorities, the children 
were admitted, but were then refused textbooks.
In Guatemala, the Mayan culture and language 
spoken by the majority of the population were 
simply erased for decades from an education 
system that was based on the Spanish culture and 
language of the colonialist minority.

Northern Ireland:
stripping away stereotypes
Teaching mutual respect – carefully – in 
Protestant and Catholic schools
When people from the Simon Community 
asked students at St Joseph’s High 
School in Creggan to describe a homeless person, 
the stereotype of an old, drunk, dirty person 
emerged.The visitors then revealed they were 
all homeless. Creggan is a strongly Catholic area 
of Derry in Northern Ireland. In predominantly 
Protestant Dromore High School, south of Belfast, 
pupils had a similar lesson last year.
Brian McCutcheon remembers the lesson. “We 
drew a picture and mostly it was an old man, 
rough-looking, but then we found that most 
homeless people are women under the age of 
30.” Said Stephen, “I learned that you should 
not always judge people by how they look. You 
should talk to them and see what they are like. 
La Estancia and Chuipachaj 
are both K’iche’ communities in 
Guatemala. In La Estancia, however 
Spanish is the dominant language, 
while in Chuipachaj, everyone 
speaks K’iche’ including the 
children. The UNESCO-supported 
Mobilising Project in Support of 
Mayan Education (PROMEM) has 
been at work. “PROMEM has had 
a positive effect on the children’s 
self-esteem, because they have 
discovered that our culture is as 
valuable as others. This is essential 
so that they don’t feel inferior,” 
says teacher Eladio Jose Menchu 
Barreno, Director of the Community 
Self-Management School of 
Chuipachaj.
The project, launched in 1995 
to support democratization in 
Guatemala, puts Mayan language, 
values, traditions and cosmology 
at the heart of the learning process. 
It covers 48 educational innovation 
centres located in the K’iche’, 
Mam, Kaqchikel and Tz’utujil Maya 
communities. But resistance to 
bilingual multicultural education still 
persists, often from the Ministry of 
Education itself and from teachers 
who are not bilingual, according to 
Virginia Tam, head of the provincial 
Intercultural Bilingual Education 
Unit. Certain parents are also 
hard to convince, regrets teacher 
Silvia Luisa Menchu: “Yet the 
mother language strengthens their 
children’s identity and the Spanish 
language opens the doors to the 
outside world.”
Juan Carlos Chojolan, 12, goes to 
Nuevo Amanecer (New Dawn) Maya 
School in the District of Cantel.  He 
speaks only Spanish, but says, 
“I want to learn learn K’iche’ so 
that my grandparents can tell me 
stories about our Mayan culture. 
My mother tells me stories about 
our people, but I imagine that my 
grandparents’ version in K’iche’ 
would be even better.”

Mayan education,
everybody’s challenge
Lanka were sparked in the 1950s by “The Official 
Language Act” making the Sinhala language “the 
one official language of Ceylon”. Only in 1992 
was Tamil also recognized as an official language, 
but by then the two communities were deeply 
divided, says Prof. Lal Perera, the Director of 
the National Education Research and Evaluation 
Centre in Colombo.
For Professor Alan Smith, “The relationship 
between education and conflict needs to be 
factored into development programmes. We 
need to develop conflict-sensitive education 
systems.” Pooling their findings, the researchers 
involved in the IBE project are also focusing on 
efforts to correct anomalies and injustices where 
they can: transforming school programmes and 
restructuring education systems where they can. 
Such change is always a long-term job and always 
an uphill battle. 
Concludes the Unicef report: “the change of 
educational practice is a fundamentally political 
threat in the sense that it challenges structures of 
authority, dominance and control – in the North 
no less than the South.

They are not trying to mug you and they are not 
out to get you.” This has filtered through to other 
subjects he is studying, like history.
Dromore and St Joseph’s are two of the 25 
Northern Ireland schools involved in a pilot 
project over the last few years on Social, Civic and 
Political Education (SCPE), called “Citizenship”. 
Both are planning to teach the subject to 15-
16 year-olds for a new General Certificate in 
Secondary Education (GCSE) examination, as well 
as to secondary students. 
In Dromore, when teacher Simon Walker 
introduced the topic of asylum seekers and 
refugees, he asked his pupils to role-play, with 
some acting as asylum seekers and others as 
Home Office officials. He invited a person from 
Derry who was a refugee in Donegal. He displayed 
old photographs of nearby Hillsborough with 
banners in Irish and asked the students where it 
was. “Dublin” or “Falls Road,” they replied. Says 
Walker, “They were shocked when I told them it 
was Hillsborough. It can be a good start to a lesson 
because it provokes thought and discussion.”
MANY FACES OF 
‘THE GOOD CITIZEN’
One key question is whether citizenship can and 
will tackle Northern Ireland’s sectarian divisions in 
a way that the compulsory themes of education for 
mutual understanding and cultural heritage have 
failed to do. Another is whether certain aspects of 
citizenship will be more problematic in Protestant

An ideological arsenal
different communities, of which the Maronite, 
Druze, Sunnite, Shiite and Greek Orthodox 
are the main religious groups, and the experts 
couldn’t agree on which identity should prevail 
over others, and which perspective to give on the 
recent conflict,” explains Nemer Frayha, former 
President of the Education Centre for Research 
and Development. 
DISPUTES OVER TITLES 
AND TIMELINES
“It was an extremely difficult task, because of the 
immense ideological arsenal in people’s minds 
that had to be taken into account,” Professor 
Antoine Messara told the French daily, Liberation 
(Jan.7, 2003), adding that “we tried to respect 
the differences and to present the various points 
of view so that students could form their own 
opinions.”
In 1990
, the Taef Agreement, which 
ended the 15 year-old Lebanese 
civil war, specified that school curricula should 
be reformed to strengthen “national belonging, 
fusion of citizens, spiritual and cultural 
openness,” and that textbooks, especially for 
history and civics, should be rewritten. However, 
this has proved a tortuous task and many schools 
are reported to have given up teaching history 
altogether. Those that have continued are using 
manuals that have not been revised for more 
than 35 years, and which stop at the war for 
independence in 1943, with the result that, for 
today’s generation of students, the violent civil 
war that broke out in 1975 is a black hole. 
Educators and legislators set out in 1994 to 
create new textbooks that would fill the gaps 
and promote the idea of a national identity. 
“But Lebanon’s society is a mosaic of some 17 
schools because of the common perception that 
human rights are a Catholic cause.
“We are always very wary of teaching 
people to be ‘good citizens’ because people 
have different opinions of what that means,” 
comments Mary McCay, the teacher responsible 
for the initiative in St Joseph’s. “We hope to 
tackle the issue by expecting pupils to respect 
the rights of everyone, whether Protestants, 
Unionists or anyone else, to have a voice and 
listen to other opinions. It will take a bit of 
building up to so that they become familiar 
with the concepts.”  Her pilot students agreed 
on a class charter setting out the rights 
and responsibilities of everyone, and active 
participation in the themes appeals to them.
Simon Walker agrees: “Our experience is that 
you don’t rush into human rights in Northern 
Ireland. We begin with the black experience in 
the United States and find that pupils empathise 
with them. You can ask pupils why they 
empathise with blacks and can they see any 
parallels with Northern Ireland.” He summarizes 
his approach: “We look at global first and local 
afterwards.”

Two specialized committees and six years of 
discussion and compromise later, the task of 
writing the textbooks finally began. The primary 
texts were finished in September 2001. But the 
minister for education, says Nemer Frayha, 
“suspended their distribution because he objected 
to a lesson title in the third grade textbook about 
the nature of the 636 A.D. Arab conquest of what 
is now Lebanon, and thought that a timeline in 
the lesson showing the arrival of different peoples 
discredited the Arabs as invaders.” 
Yet another committee was formed to revise the 
new texts. But says Frayha, “nothing has been 
done.”

Human rights, multi-ethnic 
comprehension and a culture 
of peace figure prominently 
among the guiding principles 
set down by the Independent 
High Commission of Education 
for Afghanistan, in its final 
report recently presented to 
government of the Transitional 
Islamic State of Afghanistan.
The High Commission, 
composed of 23 experienced 
Afghan specialists in education, 
science, law and administration 
and including four women, was 
established in November 2002 
by the government in Kabul to 
draw up a blueprint for the long-
term reconstruction of of the 
country’s education system.
It recommends that all 
discriminatory , educational 
and technical constraints 
regarding the education of 
girls and women should be 
eliminated, and that measures 
be taken to provide them 
equal educational and training 
opportunities at all levels. It also 
set a minimim of eight years 
compulsory basic education 
for school-age children (7-15 
years) and recommended 
the establishment of 
basic education centres to 
provide diversified learning 
opportunities for primary 
school-age children. At 
secondary level, environmental 
studies and education for 
human rights, democracy 
and a culture of peace will 
be developed in the school 
curriculum.

In the most remote regions, users 
of information and communication 
technologies connect with the rest 
of the world
On 
September 11 2001, when a 
Tuareg guide heard about 
the terrorist attack, he went 
to Timbuktu and sent an e-mail to ask about 
a New York doctor he’d met in the Sahara the 
year before. That gesture of solidarity, between 
individuals seemingly worlds apart, was made 
possible by the technology that the Community 
Multimedia Centre (CMC) in the Malian town 
makes available to the public.
This UNESCO programme, which seeks to bridge 
the digital divide, gives the most destitute and 
isolated communities in the developing world 
access to information and communication 
technologies (ICT). At present, 30 CMCs are

Bottom: New horizons 
at the Kothmale CMC 
(Sri Lanka)
operating in 16 countries spread out over three 
continents (see box). The CMCs integrate 
community radio stations with the infrastructure 
of community telecentres, i.e. computers linked 
to the internet, printers, faxes, photocopying 
machines, photo equipment, scanners, etc.
“RADIO-BROWSING”
A key activity of the CMC is “radio-browsing”. It 
consists of a radio broadcast that gives listeners 
the opportunity to become long-distance 
cybernauts. During a show on a given subject, 
the programme host talks to a specialist about 
the content of previously selected internet sites 
(see following article on Benin). The presence 
of a specialist makes it possible to pick out the 
reliable sites from the mass of sometimes-dubious 
information to be found on the web. It was thanks 
to such a “radio-browsing” show, for example, 
that an illiterate woman in Sri Lanka decided 
to contact the Kothmale CMC to make a virtual 
pilgrimage to a sacred Buddhist shrine in India via 
a website.
Complementary technologies, such as radio 
and internet, set the CMCs apart from traditional 
communications projects. Stella Hughes, 
Senior Programme Specialist in UNESCO’s 
Communication Development Division 
explains: “The CMC is an integrated association 
of technologies, of which the internet is a 
component. The radio is a means to broadcast 
information in the local language to the heart of 
communities. ‘Radio-browsing’ helps to bridge 
the generation gap, because parents can become 
familiar with the internet and not feel out of their 
depth when their children talk about downloading 
documents, for instance. Sometimes the parents 
themselves make suggestions on how to make 
use of web resources. I know of one case, a Sri 
Lankan baker who wanted to diversify the range 
of products in his bakery, who asked his son to 
search for new pastry recipes.”
VIRTUAL OFFICE
The CMCs are regularly turned into virtual offices. 
In Mali, some Tuaregs travel several days by camel 
to get to the Timbuktu CMC to read e-mails and 
check the travel arrangements of the next group 
of tourists they will be guiding on a desert trek. A 
number of Malian immigrants, originally from the 
region of Kayes and living in Paris, have contacted 
UNESCO to take computer classes in order to 
communicate with their relatives through the 
CMC in Kayes. Young people from Côte d’Ivoire 
are seeking to make friends with young people in 
neighbouring Senegal. At the Nakaseke CMC, in 
Uganda, farm workers are taking advantage of the 
internet to get information on the potential risks 
of genetically-modified seeds.

ONLINE TRAINING
The CMC does not only aim to facilitate access to 
useful activities such as job-hunting or checking 
the price of agricultural goods in town, it also 
seeks to encourage the creation of locally relevant 
content. The development of a community’s own 
resources, particularly data banks, audio and 
video archives, posters, brochures and CD-Roms, 
are also part of the CMC’s mission. The goal is to 
gradually accumulate useful knowledge relevant 
to the community. To that end, the computer 
programme eNRICH (http://enrich.nic.in) is 
proving to be a particularly useful tool. This 
community information browser allows users 
to set up their own gateway websites easily and 
quickly. They can then go directly to internet sites 
that best serve their needs or interests. Similarly, a 
set of training modules (Multimedia Training Kit) 
aimed at CMC staff is available online to facilitate 
their work and integrate traditional media and ICT 
(http://www.itrainonline.org).
Among the cashew, 
neem and 
teak trees, several people 
gather together on a Sunday 
morning in front of a dozen 
computers to follow the 
instructions of the teacher, 
Waïdou Kare. We are at the 
Community Multimedia 
Centre (CMC) in Banikoara, 
700 kilometres from Cotonou 
(Benin).
Created at the initiative 
of UNESCO, the Banikoara 
CMC combines a local radio 
station, Radio Bani Gans, 
with a community telecentre, 
fully equipped with 
computers connected to the 
internet, printers, telephones 
and photocopying machines. 
It is the only computer-
training centre in the region. 
This is where students, 
municipal civil servants 
and staff from the wildlife 
resource centre, members of 
the cotton growers’ union 
or NGO activists, among 
others, learn how to surf the

Illiterate people also come to the CMCs. They can call 
on instructors who help them browse the web, just as 
people used to employ professional scribes. The monitors 
write e-mails and also read back the answers. As for 
semi-literate people, they learn to spot certain reference 
points as they browse. Though the digital divide is far 
from being bridged, the CMCs prove that when people 
have access to ICT, they know exactly how to benefit 
from it, adapting it to their own needs.

equivalent of 0.37 euros an 
hour.
The staff of Banikoara’s 
rural radio, founded in 1994 
with the support of the 
Agence intergovernmental 
de la francophonie, realized 
that in an interconnected 
scientific world, those who 
stayed on the sidelines 
risked being entirely 
excluded. This is why they 
opened the telecentre in 
February 2002, to hook 
up to the global electronic 
networks. The centre 
went on to set up its own 
website (http://pp.isfp.ch/
oafrique/benin/banikoara/) 
and organize some “radio-
browsing” sessions. When 
a programme about AIDS 
was on the air, for instance, 
a doctor was invited to the 
studio. While a journalist 
was presenting the show, he 
was looking on the internet 
to answer questions from 
listeners. This opening to the 
world does not, of course, 
replace local information. 
Recently, a news broadcast 
about the collapse of the 
bridge over the Alibori, a 
tributary of the Niger, saved 
many farm workers from 
wasting hours of travel time 
to get to an unusable bridge.
CUT OFF
The internet connection can 
also serve to track the market 
price of cotton, points out Bio 
Sayo, former student who is 
now a farmer. “We learned 
that in Côte d’Ivoire, farmers 
had demanded and obtained 
a better price for cotton. 
Their leaders had been able 
to get information about the 
fluctuations of crop prices. We 
can be as vigilant and have 
the same attitude here.”
The CMC has enabled the 
elderly Issa, who has spent 
his entire life in Banikoara, 
to make a voyage into the 
past. From a cupboard, he 
pulls out an old briefcase 
in which he stores a whole 
collection of archives.  He 
takes out yellowed and faded 
photographs from the 1950s, 
and a dozen of death notices 
for friends and relatives who 
passed away over recent 
decades. Thanks to the 
machines at the centre, the 
documents were copied and 
“rejuvenated” and are now 
saved from the ravages of 
time. 
Sometimes the telephone 
doesn’t work, and “our area 
is cut off from the rest of the 
world for several days at a 
time,” explains the Mayor of 
Banikoara, Sabidar Daniel 
Sabi. But the CMC’s problems 
are those of the community, 
caused by isolation and 
the deficiency of basic 
infrastructure.

An Israeli and Christian Arab, Father 
Emile Shoufani has dedicated his life 
to encouraging dialogue between Jews 
and Muslims. In May 2003, the “Parish 
Priest of Nazareth” organized a multi-
confessional pilgrimage to Auschwitz. 
His commitment earned him the 
recognition of the 2003 UNESCO Prize 
for Peace Education
UNESCO : In 2003, the “Memory for Peace” 
trip to Auschwitz was above all a symbolic 
gesture. What, more concretely, did it do? 
Father Shoufani : The constructive element in this 
project wasn’t simply the visit to Auschwitz, 
which was important and symbolic in itself. It was 
also the preparation and the listening that went 
on beforehand that allowed us to learn about 
this part of history from the mouths of Jewish 
survivors and speakers and especially to learn 
together, as Jews and Arabs. Through this process, 
there was a big transformation in the way each 
one listened and was present with the others. And 
nobody was the same after coming back from 
“To be the same as 
everybody is hell”

Auschwitz. The feeling of unity, communion and 
solidarity that grew during the visit, the emotion 
and the expressions of humanity that could be felt 
in that place of inhumanity – that changed the 
people. They realized that it was about putting the 
human spirit at the centre of any conflict. All this 
education involving learning to know others and 
to be ready to listen, to shoulder responsibility for 
others, that for me was very important.
What was special about the trip for the Jews 
taking part?
◗ The reaction I heard the most was that seeing 
Auschwitz with Muslim and Christian Arabs was 
really something else. There was a feeling of new 
togetherness. What’s more, the discovery that a 
‘potential enemy’ is an imaginary construct was 
liberating for all of us.
Last year, you launched an appeal in which 
you called for a dialogue “free of all the 
suspicions accumulated” by Jews and Arabs 
over the past few generations. What did you 
mean by that?
◗ Today, we live in total ignorance about others. 
What is concentrated upon is the conflict, with its 
suffering and its traps. There has been a break in 
relations and language. We no longer understand 
each other. This idea that the other side will kill 
me if I don’t kill them first, that to continue to 
exist I have to kill others, is the biggest suspicion 
that exists today. It’s because we don’t know each 
other and because dialogue has never existed 
beyond the guns that this idea continues to fuel 
the conflict.
In your opinion, is it possible to put the 
Holocaust and the suffering of the Palestinian 
people on the same level?
◗ I don’t know where this comes from, this 
idea of always comparing suffering. Suffering is 
common to all of humanity. The idea of wanting 
to compare ourselves to say ‘I’m much more a 
victim than you’, this struggle within the cycles 
of death and violence which shows that even in 
suffering we want to come first, this is senseless. 
The Holocaust was something different in the 
sense that it was based on an ideology and 
a method of exterminating an entire people, 
wherever they were. It was the ideology behind 
the extermination of the Jewish people – and not 
just the methods used – that made the Holocaust 
so inhuman.
You also say that this conflict is not a 
religious conflict…
◗ It is not a conflict between Islam and Judaism. 
It is a conflict that takes on religious overtones, 
and that’s what’s so dangerous. Really, we are 
faced with problems of rights. The right of the 
Palestinian people, the right of the Jewish people, 
the right to dignity and to live together.
For ten years there has been much discussion 
about the notion of a clash of civilizations. 
What do you think of this?
◗ I won’t use that term. I believe more in the joy 
in the meetings of civilizations. It’s a joy to be 
able to meet others, to see that they are different 
in the way they think, their food, their style of 
UNESCO Prize for 
Peace Education
On the occasion of the 
2003 UNESCO Prize for 
Peace Education award 
ceremony on September 
8, UNESCO organized a 
roundtable on “Culture of 
Peace and the Foundations 
of Reconciliation” in the 
presence of the prize winner, 
Father Emile Shoufani, and 
Yolande Mukagasana who 
received an Honourable 
Mention.
 A Rwandan-Belgian 
woman born in Rwanda 
in 1954, Mukagasana 
lost her husband and her 
three children and saw the 
health centre she founded 
destroyed during the 1994 
genocide. She went on 
to build an orphanage 
and adopted 17 children. 
Since 1995, she has been a 
refugee in Belgium, where 
she set up Nyarimambo 
Point d’Appui, a foundation 
for remembrance of the 
Rwanda genocide and 
for reconstruction, which 
tries to raise the public’s  
– especially young people’s – 
awareness of the tragedy.
Started in 1981, and 
carrying a purse of $30,000 
funded by a donation from 
the Nippon Foundation, the 
UNESCO Prize for Peace 
Education has in recent 
years recognized the City 
Montessori School (India), 
the Jewish-Arab Center 
for Peace in Givat Haviva 
(Israel), Bishop Nelson 
Onono-Onweg (Uganda), 
Toh Swee-Hin (Australia),

dress and their religion, and to be able to share 
their culture. During the trip to Auschwitz, 
Muslims, Christians and Jews shared their 
prayers. There is a divine part in humans that can 
be shared through different religions and which 
makes communion possible. Instead of being 
prisoners of one single idea, of a monotone, the 
coming together enriched us. Today, humanity’s 
challenge is this: can we accept the differences, 
the diversity of existence, or do we all want to be 
the same? And to be the same, that is hell.
When you were studying, you learned about 
the non-directive method. How has this 
influenced your work?
◗ This method, which has been of great 
inspiration to me, involves developing a personal 
reflection in a student through dialogue. It’s 
not about making him think, but more helping 
him discover and express who he is and what 
he is thinking through a personal process that 
will change him. The classic teacher-student 
relationship doesn’t happen in our school. It’s all 
about reaching out to another, to somebody who 
is himself learning in order to embody teaching 
that is no longer external, but internal. Instead 
of ‘having’ knowledge, knowledge becomes 
personalised. We try to be, and not simply have 
something. It’s the key success of our school. 
This success isn’t only seen in the high rates of 
good exam results, but in a dynamism that creates 
beings capable of producing new ideas, thoughts 
and initiatives, and who can simply ‘be’, in a 
different fashion.
How do your students react during times 
when the crisis intensifies?
◗ You always have to be ready for very sharp, 
very violent reactions. We halt classes to give the 
students the opportunity to talk with the teachers. 
It aims to teach ways to express the hurt and the 
fear we are living with, to try to make sure that 
this expression, instead of remaining violent, is 
transformed into reflection and responsibility.
Peace education relies on responsibility. It is 
not just about singing about peace, but rather

“A very bold gesture”
Father Emile Shoufani, 
born to an Arab Christian 
family in Nazareth, 
Palestine in 1947, is today 
Archimandrite of the 
Greek Catholic Church.  
Since 1976, he has been 
principal of St. Joseph’s 
College in Nazareth, where 
he develops democratic 
values in teaching and 
brings dialogue to the fore.
In 2002, he launched an 
appeal for “Memory for 
Peace”, a joint pilgrimage 
to Auschwitz-Birkenau.  
This unprecedented 
initiative was supported 
by many intellectuals 
in Israel and elsewhere, 
and, between May 26 and 
May 29, 2003, 500 people 
of various nationalities and 
confessions made the trip 
together.  Extracts of his 
appeal:
“I appeal to my Arab 
brothers to join me so 
we can together make a 
strong, free and very bold 
gesture. At the place that 
incarnates the atrocity 
of genocide, Auschwitz-
Birkenau, we will show 
our brotherhood towards 
the millions of victims…. 
This act of remembrance 
will indicate our deep 
rejection of such inhuman 
behavior and our ability to 
understand the wounds of 
others.”
“I appeal to my Jewish 
brothers to understand 
that, for the overwhelming 
majority in the Arab 
and Muslim world, the 
conflict tearing us apart is 
absolutely not something 
religious, and even less so 
racial.  The Arabs are not 
following on from those 
who in the past wanted 
to make Jews disappear 
because they were Jews.  
Inheritors, like them, of 
Abraham’s faith, they 
are, like them, carriers of 
illuminating values.”
developing reflection and responsibility towards a 
conflict in which we have a role.
You are saying that, in fact, peace doesn’t 
so much depend on international will and 
initiatives, but more on this changing of 
mentalities?
◗ Absolutely. What’s more, it’s easy to see. No 
outside force has ever been able to establish 
peace. Both sides need to reach out to each other. 
That’s where an enormous amount of work needs 
to be done.
You have been awarded the 2003 UNESCO 
Peace Education Prize. What does that mean 
to you?
◗ For me, it’s recognition from the highest 
authority in education, culture and knowledge, 
which reinforces my idea that this work towards 
dialogue must continue. Education must be a 
priority for humanity. It is that which removes 
ignorance – the source of fear, the source of death 
and conflict.

to Herbert Marcuse, Karl Jaspers, Jeanne Hersch, 
Joseph Ki-Zerbo, Theodor Adorno and Arnold 
Toynbee, from Carlos Fuentes to Paul Ricoeur, 
Susan Sontag, Richard Rorty, Vaclav Havel, 
Desmond Tutu, Wole Soyinka and Toni Morrison, 
not to mention hundreds of eminent, though less-
famous experts in all sorts of fields; the long list 
of contibutors represents the crème de la crème 
of the world’s intelligentsia of half a century. 
The Arabic version was launched in 1986, and 
anthologies have been published in Hindi since 
1963 and Chinese since 1985.
BREAKING THE ICE
Among its special theme issues, Diogenes 
published “East-West Dialogue” in 1958 (issue 
no. 24), “Interactions of Civilisations” in 1960 
(no. 32), and “Diversity and Unity of Man” 
in 1987 (no. 140). For the 50th anniversary of 
Diogenes, celebrated at UNESCO in January 2003, 
Jean d’Ormesson said: “Diogenes has played a big 
role in bringing together people who could not be 
seen to be close. Time and again, we made Arab 
scientists and Israeli scientists work together, as 
well as American scientists and Soviet and Chinese 
scientists. It was maybe between the Soviet and 
the Chinese that we had the biggest problems. But 
we succeeded.”
Monique Perrot-Lanaud
It was back at the height of the Cold War, at 
the worst moment of East-West relations, that 
UNESCO launched its review dedicated to human 
sciences with the aim of building bridges between 
scientists of all disciplines and in all countries. 
The first issue came out in November 1952 and 
– in a truly unusual move for the time – it was 
published in three languages: English, French and 
Spanish.
With its title paying hommage to the Greek 
philospher who went about with a lantern in the 
daytime looking for an honest man, Diogenes 
is published by the International Council for 
Philosophy and Humanistic Studies (ICPHS), 
which was created by UNESCO in 1949. Diogenes 
was the brainchild of one man in particular: the 
French philisopher and writer Roger Caillois, a 
former surrealist who ran the publication until 
his death in 1978 and who gave it his cross-
disciplinary vision. A vision that his sub-editor of 
25 years, Jean d’Ormesson, said Callois described 
as “a mutual enriching of one discipline through 
another”.
Diogenes quickly became a free tribune for 
intellectuals of all types. From Emile Benveniste 
From East to West – reflected civilizations
The 50th anniversary issue of 
Diogenes includes articles on:
◗ Rising Sun and Setting Sun, by 
Raimon Panikkar, Spanish philosopher 
and theologian,
◗ Indigenous Beyond Exoticism by 
Augustin Berque, French geographer 
and orientalist,
◗ The Role of Iranians in the Spread 
of Buddhism, Manichaeism and 
Mazdaism in China, by Nahal Tajadod, 
French sinologue of Iranian origin,
◗ Cultural Encounters and the Orient: 
A Study in the Politics of Knowledge, 
by Shiv Visvanathan, Indian 
anthropologist and historian,
◗ Eurasia and its East-West borders, 
by Jack Goody, British anthropologist,
◗ My Personal Experience of East-
West Cultural Exchange, by Ikuo 
Hirayama, Japanese artist.
Fifty years
of smart writing
Since 1952 the review Diogenes has explored 
“world unity through the diversity of its 
topics,” as Octavio Paz, one of its contributors, 
so aptly puts it

UNESCO in action in brief
The Silk Roads
radio show
Twice a week, central 
Asia’s radio-listeners can 
tune in to a new episode 
in the Silk Roads series. 
UNESCO’s Tashkent 
(Uzbekistan) office 
launched the Uzbek 
and Tadjik language 
programme, which is 
based on the region’s 
age-old oral tradition, in 
1999. Four years after it 
was created, 200 episodes 
have already been aired. 
Topics in the news as well 
as issues relating to the 
family, farming and social 
dialogue are usually the 
focus. Recently, Russian 
listeners have been able 
to start tuning in to 
the progamme in their 
language as well. 
Translating dialogue
“Translate” comes from 
the Latin verb meaning to 
convey from one place to 
another.  With this aim, 
UNESCO promotes literary 
exchange and intercultural 
understanding through 
two publishing projects, 
the Index Translationum, a 
longstanding publication, 
and the more recent 
Clearing House for Literary 
Translation.
The Index 
Translationum is the 
only international index 
of translations in the 
world, a database that 
contains references for 
250,000 classic and 
contemporary authors 
and cites 500 languages 
(from the Abaknon of 
the Philippines to South 
African Zulu). As for the 
Clearing House, it aims 
to provide information 
and advice for all those 
involved in the discovery 
of literature: translators, 
publishers, researchers, 
librarians and teachers. 
It has also played a key 
role in circulating the 
Manifesto of Authors, 
Literary Publishers and 
Translators for Cultural 
Diversity launched by the 
International Federation of 
Translators.

No more languages, 
no more life
Our linguistic heritage is in 
danger. Are we aware that 
when a language disappears, 
so does precious knowledge 
about the environment? 
UNESCO Publishing is 
bringing out “Sharing a 
World of Difference, the 
Earth’s Linguistic, Cultural 
and Biological Diversity”, a 
collective work. It examines 
the complex interactions of 
diversity, whether linguistic, 
cultural or biological.  
According to the authors, 
“cultural diversity” must 
be protected at all costs if 
we want to live in a world 
where idioms, cultures and 
habitat support and sustain 
each other.

A declaration
on human genetic data
In October 2003, UNESCO’s 
General Conference adopted 
the International Declaration 
on Human Genetic Data, 
which sets out the ethical 
principles that should 
govern the collection, 
processing, storage and 
use of these data, extracted 
from biological samples 
(blood, tissue, saliva, sperm, 
etc.). Their increasingly 
important role in our lives 
– concerning health but 
also legal and police matters 
– adds to the risk that they 
will be used in ways that 
infringe on human rights 
and fundamental freedoms.
The Conference also 
approved a new project, 
both vast and difficult: the 
elaboration of a universal 
instrument on bioethics.  
It will be larger in scope 
than both the Declaration 
on Human Genetic Data 
and the Declaration on the 
Human Genome adopted 
in 1997.

Disappearing cousins
Every great ape species 
– including gorillas, 
chimpanzees, bonobos and 
orangutans - is at high risk 
of extinction, either in the 
immediate future or at best 
within 50 years.“Research 
indicates that the 
western chimpanzee, 
for example, has already 
disappeared from Benin, 
the Gambia and Togo,” 
said Samy Mankoto, 
a UNESCO expert on 
conservation. 
UNESCO, one of the 
main co-ordinators of 
the Great Apes Survival 
Project (GRASP), held 
an emergency meeting 
in November with 
representatives from the 
23 great ape home “range 
states” in Africa and South 
East Asia as well as donors, 
UN agencies and NGOs to 
draw up a survival plan for 
the great apes. 
Learning understanding 
in Asia-Pacific
Approximately 30 teachers 
and teacher-trainers from 
14 Asia-Pacific countries 
attended a workshop at 
the Asia-Pacific Centre of 
Education for International 
Understanding in July and 
August in Seoul (South 
Korea). Education for peace, 
sustainable development and 
international understanding 
were on the agenda. The 
Centre, which has offered 
this workshop for three 
years, has written a teacher’s 
guide about those topics. 
The Centre of Education for 
International Understanding, 
an NGO working under 
the aegis of UNESCO, 
also publishes a quarterly 
magazine in English, Sang 
Saeng (“living together). 
www.unescoapceiu.org
Strengthening 
partnership in South Asia 
Seven countries—
Bangladesh, Bhutan, India, 
the Maldives Islands, Nepal, 
Pakistan and Sri Lanka—
have joined the “Rainbow 
partnership”, an initiative 
intended to strengthen ties 
in the South Asia region 
through education and the 
promotion of sustainable 
development. This project is 
the brainchild of the South 
Asia Foundation founded 
by Madanjeet Singh, a 
writer, painter and, since 
2000, UNESCO goodwill 
ambassador, who has had 
a UNESCO prize for the 
promotion of tolerance and 
non-violence named after 
him.

Films for dialogue
Clashes between two youths 
who are flying kites in India, or 
the fear provoked in Jerusalem 
when a musical toy is passed 
around, are the topics of two 
of the five films made in 2003 
by film and television students 
in the context of the UNESCO 
project “Intensifying the dialogue 
among communities, cultures 
and civilizations”. Each received 
US$ 15,000 after selection from 
projects submitted by film and TV 
schools from all over the world. 
Each of the five fiction films, 
without dialogue, is a visual aid 
aimed at making young people 
more conscious of tolerance, 
dialogue and peace. They are 
entitled “The New Start” (India), 
“The Red Toy” (Israel), “The Wild 
East” (Romania), “The Neighbors” 
(Mexico), and “The Dance Circle” 
(Burkina Faso).
Marti prize 
travels to Mexico
Mexican sociologist Pablo 
González Casanova has won the 
2003 José Martí prize, which 
honors persons or organizations 
for their contributions to the  unity 
and integration of the countries of 
Latin America and the Caribbean, 
as well as to the preservation of 
their identities, cultural traditions 
and historical values. González 
Casanova teaches at the 
national autonomous 
university of Mexico 
(UNAM) and coordinates 
the project “Latin American 
perspectives” sponsored 
by UNAM and the United 
Nations University. He 
has distinguished himself 
through his fight against 
racism, apartheid and social 
exclusion – and is in fact donating 
his US$ 15,000 prize to some 
educational programmes in Cuba. 
The award ceremony on 
October 20, 2003, coincided with 
the 150th anniversary of the 
birth of José Martí (1853-1895), 
humanist, writer, translator, 
diplomat and teacher known as the 
“apostle of liberty”.
Gender target 
in doubt
Girls continue to face 
“sharp discrimination 
in access to schooling” 
in a majority of 
developing countries 
according to the 
Education for All 
Global Monitoring 
Report 2003/04, 
published by UNESCO 
last November.
Over the 1990s, girls’ 
enrolment increased 
faster than boys, 
but girls still make 
up 57 percent of the 
estimated 
104 million children out 
of school worldwide. 
The Report says 
gender parity in 
education remains a 
distant prospect in 
54 countries including 
16 countries in sub-
Saharan Africa as well 
as Pakistan and India. 
In China, boys will 
continue to outnumber 
girls in secondary 
schools for many years 
to come.
The need to 
supplement family 
income, along with 
cost and other barriers 
such as early marriage, 
HIV/AIDS, conflict, 
and violence in schools 
are listed as the main 
reasons keeping girls 
out of school.

Dialogue among 
cultures 
between cultures, through the discovery of a 
common heritage and shared values.”
In 1998, at the initiative of President Mohammad 
Khatami of the Islamic Republic of Iran, the United 
Nations General Assembly designated 2001 as 
United Nations Year of Dialogue among 
Civilizations (www.un.org/dialogue) for which 
the formal launch took place, in New York, on 
September 5, 2000, eve of the United Nations 
Millenium Summit. UNESCO and the United 
Nations, with the support of the Islamic Republic 
of Iran, organized on this occasion the first of 
what would become a series of roundtables, 
giving concrete expression to this dialogue. 
Reprinted below are selected excerpts from these 
proceedings.
dialogue and understanding 
 among cultures and 
civilizations has been at the heart of UNESCO’s 
mission since its establishment in 1946. Major 
activities undertaken over the years have, among 
others, included such flagship programmes as 
UNESCO’s General and Regional Histories series 
(see p.76), the Arabia Plan, the Mediterranean 
Programme, the Slave Route and Silk Roads, the 
Intercultural Dialogue in Central Asia Project and 
the Programme on Interreligious Dialogue.
All have helped to reveal how much different 
cultures owe to each other and, in the words 
of  UNESCO Director-General Koïchiro Matsuura, 
“highlighted the historical and contemporary 
processes that foster a positive understanding

One global civilization
❋ Alongside an infinite diversity of cultures there does 
exist one global civilization in which humanity’s ideas and beliefs 
meet and develop peacefully and productively. It is a civilization 
that must be defined by its tolerance of dissent, its celebration of 
cultural diversity, its insistence on fundamental, universal human 
rights, and its belief in the right of people everywhere to have a 
say in how they are governed. It is a civilization that we are called 
on to defend and promote as we embark on a new century.
Kofi Annan
Secretary-General of the United Nations
Polylogue
❋ We are now talking about a dialogue of civilizations, 
except that the first syllable of the word ‘dialogue’ is always 
di-, which means a conversation between two. I do not know if 
such a word already exists, but I should like to change the word 
from di- to poly-, a ‘polylogue’ among civilizations and cultures. 
With the problems of globalization only the big cultures will 
easily survive, but many of the smaller cultures will be seriously 
endangered. (...) I think that the concept of a ‘polylogue’ among 
civilizations and cultures is important for future discussion.
Masanori Aoyagi
Professor, University of Tokyo, Japan
Breezes from all directions
❋ Of course, the maintenance and promotion of identities 
and the protection of cultural and civilizational traditions, must 
not become a tool to shield ultra-nationalism and exclusionism. 
Mahatma Gandhi once said that he would certainly not like to be 
blown off his feet but would also not like to shut the windows of 
his consciousness to the rest of the world. He thought that breezes 
from all directions must blow through his house.
Jaswant Singh
Minister for External Affairs, India
A new millen 
The West versus the rest
❋ I would also like to notice that in this discussion about 
dialogue and where to go, it has always been about the West 
versus the rest. One says ‘polylogue’, but it is not. We do not 
hear about Asia and Africa trying to understand each other, or 
about Latin America and the Middle East, not because they do 
not need to, but because this whole issue of civilization is being 
approached in what I consider to be the totally false way launched 
by Samuel Huntington, rather than seeing civilization as a state, 
a single state, expressed in many different ways by different 
cultures.
Flora Lewis
Journalist, USA
It means little
❋ Though the Dogons or the Bamanan developed 
systems of thinking that referred to the extraordinary strength 
of their internal balance, nevertheless they were reduced to 
forced labour and to depersonalization in the face of better-
equipped civilizations. Though Dogon or Bamanan philosophy 
attracted a tiny number of experts, it was essentially a dead letter, 
incommunicable to the heirs of those peoples. It means little for 
an African to hear in roundtables that his continent is the cradle 
of humanity.
But that is where the respect for African cultures stops. When 
it is a question not of the past but indeed of the present of our 
continent, which is starving, ill, torn apart by debt, suddenly 
dialogue seems to become a deafness to the desperate appeal of 
a portion of forgotten humankind. We would like there to be a 
true dialogue among civilizations at last, one which is not just the 
subject of conversation among a few people from the developed 
world between the dessert and cheese courses. Rather, dialogue as 
a real commitment to respect the hundreds of millions of human 
beings who are drowning.

New York, 
September 11,  2001Eternal human questions
❋ Even though human beings inevitably inhabit a certain 
historical horizon, we could still aim at ‘meta-historical’ discourse. 
Indeed, a meta-historical discussion of eternal human questions 
– such as the ultimate meaning of life and death or good and 
evil – ought to substantiate and enlighten any dialogue on 
political and social issues. Without a discussion of fundamental 
questions, and by simply confining attention to superficial issues, 
dialogue will not get us far from where we currently stand. When 
superficial issues masquerade as ‘real’, ‘urgent’ and ‘essential’, 
and where there is no agreement, or even mutual understanding,  
concerning what is truly fundamental, misunderstanding and 
confusion will likely proliferate instead of any sense of empathy 
and compassion.
Seyyed Mohammad Khatami
President of the Islamic Republic of Iran
ium
The ghost of racism
❋ With all the advances in human genetics there may be 
the temptation to regard the issue of race as academic. But not 
for us Africans. Scars of historic and individual experiences 
are too deep and too fresh for us to engage in dialogue among 
civilizations without due recognition of the negative force of 
racism, even when it exists subliminally. For some time to come 
into this new century, a degree of soul-searching is an imperative 
for all dialogue between Africa and the world until the ghost of 
racism is finally laid to rest.

A community of destinies
❋ Everyone agreed on the idea of both unity and diversity 
of cultures and of human beings. We should not say that on 
the one hand there is unity and on the other hand there is 
diversity. I believe that it is human unity, be it genetic, anatomic 
or cerebral, that produces this diversity. Diversity is not the 
opposite of unity and unity should not wipe out diversity for us. 
These are not mere formulae, these are things which each person 
must grasp for himself so that we have within us a feeling of 
the human community which does not abolish our differences. 
This human community should be deep enough so that, in this 
era of globalization, each and every individual can feel that our 
planet, Earth, is also our motherland and that today we have not 
only our own country, our own motherland, and sometimes an 
even broader attachment as Europeans do in the case of Europe, 
but that we also have a shared homeland. If we do not have 
this awareness and sense of a shared homeland, a community 
of destinies, then understanding, and therefore the dialogue of 
civilizations will be nearly impossible.
Edgar Morin
Philosopher, France
Unity in diversity
❋ In Mozambique we have made it possible for our 
people, regardless of race, colour, ethnicity, culture, political 
or religious belief, to work together for the construction and 
economic development of the country. This is the spirit of unity 
in diversity that underlies the recent economic and social progress 
the country has made.
Joaquim Alberto Chissano
President of the Republic of Mozambique
The individual and the universal
❋ A dialogue among civilizations can be seen as a 
dialogue between the individual and the universal. Great 
significance is given to this classical dialogue in the Koran when 
God, addressing men, tells them: O Men! We created males and 
females and We made peoples and tribes so that you may know 
each other! By transcending national and tribal groupings, the 
Koran has a specific purpose and reason for Man to recognize 
Man. To the motto on the Temple of Delphi, ‘Know thyself’, we 
could add ‘by knowing the Other’, or recognizing the particular 
identity of the Other. Cultures and civilizations, like individuals, 
can recognize their identities and originality only when they 
compare them to other cultures or civilizations.

Dialogue within nations
❋ We should start by thinking of what we mean when we 
use the expression ‘dialogue’. I sense that it is important to deal 
not only with dialogue among nations but also dialogue within 
nations. That is very important because dialogue among nations 
is something we are doing in this very house. For almost 60 years 
we have been dialoguing here. I will not comment on the outcome 
of this permanent dialogue but what is now very important is 
to think and reflect on dialogue within nations. Almost all the 
problems we are now facing have arisen as a consequence of 
differences within nations – internal wars, internal difficulties, 
internal civil wars – and our first objective should be to help 
countries start a real internal dialogue. There is no other way of 
having an internal dialogue than through democracy.
Democracy is indispensable for obtaining a dialogue within 
nations. 
Javier Pérez de Cuéllar
Ambassador, Peru 
Self-criticism
❋ I do not think we can avoid totally what one might 
call the purely academic aspect, the exhumation of the past. 
It is necessary, for instance, to understand absolutely what 
is happening now and why we are in a state of increasing 
intolerance in many aspects of human, social and national 
intercourse. Last century turned out to be one of the bloodiest that 
the world has known for quite a while. I should have thought that 
one reason for dialogue is to understand why human progression 
took such a seemingly retrogressive step. In the process of 
course there will have to be some soul-searching. We had some 
Left. Walking through 
Grozny, Russian 
Federation, 1996
Right. General elections 
in Cambodia, 1998 
indictments of certain civilizations, and these were quite accurate. 
One would hope that the result of dialogue would be that this 
kind of criticism would even come from within, a kind of self-
criticism. What have we done to other civilizations? What have 
we done to make other civilizations so suspicious, so resentful of 
us today?
Why is there such a catalogue of indictment from one side 
to the other?
Wole Soyinka
1986 Nobel Laureate in Literature, Nigeria
Re-written
❋ There are a number of initiatives that UNESCO has 
already taken on board. I would advise that as part of this Year of 
Dialogue, the United Nations be reminded that UNESCO is already 
on the road of dialogue among civilizations and that it needs 
resources and help for this. The Silk Road is certainly one of them 
because things happen along routes. The Slave Route is another. 
Those are just two, but other initiatives taken by UNESCO 
towards global understanding, tolerance and conviviality need 
tremendous support and should be brought into the discourse. 
Practically, UNESCO and the United Nations could do a great deal 
to encourage educational institutions in every part of the world 
to take those initiatives seriously. Lots of books need to be re-
written. Lots of histories need to be re-thought.

Too much silence
❋ The prejudices that must be overcome are still 
numerous, and numerous are the distortions that mark the way 
information is treated in presentations of the past and present 
histories of formerly colonized peoples. Too much silence 
surrounds the major facts of their history; the knowledge of which 
is essential in understanding present-day situations.
Their cultures have often been ignored, minimized or 
consciously biased, while the cultures of others have been 
unreasonably glorified. If we wish to instil respect for the cultures 
of others in the minds of the young, they must be educated and 
informed without excessive chauvinism. They must become 
aware that we all belong to the same human community, and that 
the accomplishments of each nation are an enrichment for the 
others. Clearly ignorance linked to illiteracy, poverty and isolation 
excludes too many people, denying them access to modern 
knowledge, which deprives them of the instruments for a better 
appreciation of what goes beyond the strict limits of their own 
world.
Abdoulaye Wade

The ice of Yalta
❋ It should be remembered that upon the collapse of 
communism, when the ice of Yalta melted, there were reasons to 
fear the revival of ethnic and civilization clashes still smouldering 
from the first half of the 20th century. However, we opted for 
good neighbourliness, openness and co-operation. The friendship 
of Poland and Lithuania may be an inspiring example here, and 
likewise excellent Polish-German relations, Polish-Ukrainian 
partnership, or the developing Polish-Russian dialogue.
All of Central Europe, with so many historical and cultural 
threads woven into its heritage, is today an area of stability, 
security and co-operation. It enters the structures of a united 
Europe, while also remaining open to dialogue with the East and 
with other civilizations. This is our contribution to forming the 
world of the 21st century, a world of interdependence and mutual 
understanding.

No civilization 
by itself
❋ No civilization by itself can claim 
to represent all humanity or to assume 
full responsibility for it. Neither can one 
single civilization claim exclusive rights to 
provide a universally valid vision of how 
to be a good human being and how to 
live wisely in today’s world. We may find 
answers to these questions only through 
dialogue among civilizations – or by means 
of a ‘polylogue’.
Only by participating in a polylogue of 
civilizations can a civilization get to know 
itself better and put its core values to a critical test. Only a lively 
polylogue of civilizations can help safeguard mutual respect and 
tolerance, dignity and partnership among people of different 
cultural experiences.
Valdas Adamkus 
President of the Republic of Lithuania, 1998-2003
Imperialistic goals
❋ Themes such as identity and otherness are not 
exclusively philosophical questions to be dealt with only by 
professional philosophers. In fact, the theoretical problem of 
defining identity in such a way that it does not lead to exclusion 
and discrimination is related to other, more urgent practical 
issues. For example, how can we begin a real dialogue while we 
are still far from a wholly inclusive concept of humanity and 
while at both national and international level, discrimination 
and exclusion are still facts of everyday life? How can we ignore 
the fact that even our contemporary world has its own ways 
of placing barriers between different human groups, and that 
sometimes political imperialistic goals are pursued by drawing 
wholly negative pictures of other cultures and civilizations? How 
can we achieve a real dialogue among civilizations if science and 
technology remain exclusively in the hands of a few powerful 
sectors of humanity? 
Seyyed Mohammad Khatami
President of the Islamic Republic of Iran
Dialogue among religions
❋ A complicated and in itself unique dialogue among 
different religions is currently underway in Ukraine. It should 
be noted that the mutual enrichment between different religions 
occurred many times in Ukraine. The orthodox Kyiv-Mohyla 
Collegium actively and intentionally used accomplishments of 
Roman Catholic theology in the seventeenth century. More than 
105 different religious groups work in my country today. The 
dialogue between them is conducted within the framework of the 
All-Ukrainian Union of Churches and Religious Organizations. 
This forum was set up for the purpose of resolving disputes 
through joint efforts of the state and the religious communities.
Leonid Kuchma
President of Ukraine
Counter-balancing forces
❋ May I remind you that France also was built by the 
contributions of numerous civilizations. A France which likes 
to incorporate those who come from elsewhere, benefiting from 
their knowledge and granting them citizenship as a passport to 
universality. A France that has chosen Europe yet remains open to 
the world in all its diversity. A France which sees in Francophonie 
an exemplary dialogue among cultures, one of those counter-
balancing forces which so many of us feel we need.

Common  
and  
Monoculture
❋ While international 
exchanges are amplified, citizens feel 
more and more that the management 
of the world has been confiscated from 
them and that a ‘monoculture’ is being 
imposed on them. Confronted with this 
loss of decision-making capacity, this 
loss of references, this loss of identity, 
the temptation might be to withdraw 
into oneself, to fixate on the reassuring 
and set values of the past, in a climate 
of intolerance frequently verging on 
fanaticism, hatred and rejection of 
the Other. And if we wish to avoid 
that yesterday’s Cold War turns into a 
cultural confrontation, stirred by vast 
movements of international migration, 
we must, in the broadest sense of the 
word, democratize globalization before 
globalization denatures democracy.

The interaction 
of migrants
❋ The cultures of our world 
are the product of the interaction of 
migrants through the millennia. Look 
at the great and ancient civilizations 
of Asia. India and China have always 
accepted and amalgamated outsiders, 
forging their unique and lasting 
cultures through a composite of 
influences from outside – religious, 
military, economic. They are living 
examples of the power of cultural 
integration and assimilation. Look at 
the world of Islam, created through the expansion of a 
militant religion whose proponents unified vast territories 
and many ethnic groups around an idea still strong and 
valid today. Islam can serve as a living example of the 
power of multiculturalism.

The principle of secularism
❋ The meeting points of ancient Trade Routes may lie in 
other parts of the world, but India has always been a meeting 
point of Faith Routes. Besides all the faiths that originated here, 
India welcomed the Jews, Christians, the Catholics, Zoroastrians, 
Muslims and people belonging to other religions. We are 
proud of India’s age-old adherence to the ideal of Sarva Pantha 
Samabvhava – which means, respect for all faiths. I suggest 
that this principle of secularism, which is enshrined in India’s 
Constitution, should be accepted by all countries. Tolerance 
should become a global ideal. This would go a long way in 
promoting understanding, cooperation and peace among peoples 
belonging to different faiths and cultures.

The threat of terrorism 
❋ The September 11th tragedy has drawn attention to 
the magnitude of the threat of terrorism and the need to take a 
common action to encounter this threat globally.
Terror in all shapes and forms is a global issue that has 
no boundaries. It cannot be linked to any religion, ethnicity 
or culture. Lack of basic needs, unfair distribution of wealth 
among the nations of the world, hunger, marginalization, 
poverty, unemployment, poor housing, illiteracy, oppression, 
totalitarianism, violation of human rights, minorities’ problems, 
corruption and disorder can in no way justify but only provide 
the grounds that breed terror and violence. In combat against 
terrorism, these underlying ills must be addressed urgently.

Mass-scale exchange programs 
❋ Each year, China sends over one hundred thousand of 
its students and scholars to study overseas. In many countries, 
the number of Chinese students represents the largest among 
international enrollment figures. Meanwhile, in order to further 
facilitate mutual learning, China has become home to thousands 
of students from almost every nation in the world. China 
has made great efforts to actualize the mutual recognition of 
educational credentials with other countries, and the central 
government has issued a new regulation on China’s foreign 
cooperative schools. Such mass-scale exchange programs create 
numerous chances for dialogue among students and scholars 
from different cultural communities. In schools, curricula are 
redesigned to expose students to inter-lingual and cross-cultural 
contents. Students are trained to be globally oriented with high 
awareness and adequate capability for trans-cultural dialogue, and 
to do their utmost for world peace and human development.

UNESCO | the new Courier | January 2004
UNESCO stands ready 
❋ In regard to the dialogue among civilizations, my 
perspective from UNESCO convinces me of three important 
things. First, I believe that the new approaches to dialogue need 
to be rooted in concrete expressions of human interaction, not 
just in general agreements on principles. We must move from 
talking about dialogue to actual engagement in dialogue on 
matters of substantive concern - for example, on practical matters 
such as intercultural exchanges and tourism; the management 
of trans-boundary freshwater resources; the handling of issues 
in bioethics; or regional approaches to curriculum renewal and 
texbook revision.
Second, the new approaches and modalities are most likely to 
be found in those fields of human endeavour where the interface 
between knowledge and ignorance, between understanding and 
prejudice, is most acute. I believe that this interface is especially 
evident in precisely those areas covered by UNESCO’s fields of 
competence - education, the sciences, culture and communication. 
Here, the ethical and intellectual terms of debate are highly 
attuned to the character and needs of intercultural dialogue. 
Furthermore, it may well be at the junctures between these fields 
- for example, between education and science, between culture 
and technology, between social science and communication - that 
the most fruitful interactions can take place.
Third, for these reasons, I believe that UNESCO is the agency 
best placed within the UN system to help the dialogue among 
civilizations move into a new phase of development, through a 
broad-based collaboration with Member States, other members of 
the UN family, civil society, the scientific, artistic and academic 
communities, and other partners. UNESCO stands ready to 
provide the nurturing environment in which a new global 
dialogue can flourish.
Koïchiro Matsuura
Director-General of UNESCO
The culture of dialogue 
❋ What is now needed is concerted action on the 
development of a curriculum that can bring home to the students 
three important lessons, namely, (i) that the entire humanity 
shares one basic impulse towards progress and by sharing this 
impulse humanity can be seen as one vast surge of adventure 
which aims at continuous self-exceeding; (ii) that humanity, in 
its mature developments, tends to reject uniformity and adopts 
the law of unity that permits and respects cultural diversities; 
and (iii) that the future progress of humankind is bound up 
with the development of a new science and art of living together 
which necessitates adherence to the law of mutuality rather than 
conflict and the law of varied expressions rather than any uniform 
monotone. Education should aim at strengthening democratic and 
universal human values and respect for human rights. Education 
is the most powerful instrument for preparing a mind which can 
promote the culture of dialogue.
M. M. Joshi
Human  Resource Minister
Government of India
A common understanding
❋ The West faces some critical basic questions from 
Muslims around the world. Is the West not applying double 
standards? Does the West not invoke human rights merely as a 
means to put pressure on other nations, not to better people’s 
lives?  Our response to such questions must be to intensify 
the dialogue among civilizations at all levels, to renew our 
commitment to and our call for the peaceful resolution of 
differences, mutual tolerance and mutual respect. We believe in 
the principles of justice and the rule of law. The more prominent 
their role also in international relations, the greater the benefit for 
peace and stability. 
Internationally agreed norms and human rights obviously have 
a key role to play. We need to seek a common understanding of 
those universal values that will guide us through the 21st century. 
Real dialogue requires a solid consensus on those values and 
norms we hold in common.

Open-ended process 
❋ The dialogue among civilizations must of necessity be 
an ongoing, open-ended process, which should be allowed to run 
its course freely across civilizations. In our present-day world, 
however, the inescapable phenomenon of globalization impinges 
upon the realization of this ideal. As this historical process 
cuts across economic, trade, and cultural boundaries, and 
pursues objectives that very often run counter to the promotion 
of intercultural dialogue and understanding among nations, it 
impacts inevitably and strongly on human interaction and more 
importantly, on the sustainability or survival of minority cultures.... 
Sonia Mendieta de Badaroux
Ambassador, Honduras
The only 
hope 
❋ Internationalism 
is compatible with 
cultural diversity. It 
promotes cross-cultural 
understanding. Conversely, 
nationalism impedes 
such understanding. To 
engage in a dialogue 
among civilizations is 
to celebrate the spirit of 
internationalism. Today, 
when that spirit has been shaken by indiscriminate terrorist 
attacks, the spread of weapons of mass destruction, the lack of 
international cooperation concerning nuclear, environmental, 
and other issues, and above all by what appears to be the 
resurgence of national egoisms all over the world, it is particularly 
gratifying that so many delegates from so many countries have 
come together to affirm their commitment to inter-civilizational 
dialogue. Such dialogue can only strengthen internationalism, the 
only hope for a secure future for the entire human community.

The gaze of  
We all think the same way 
❋ If somebody put a gun up to my head and asked me 
what was anthropology’s greatest stride during the last century, 
I would readily say that it was exposing the fallacious character 
of racist myths, a discovery that dates back to Franz Boas’ work 
in New York at the beginning of the 20th century. Boas showed 
that mentally, there are no irreducible differences between human 
communities and that, basically, we all think the same way. In 
particular, there is no such thing as primitive thought. “Savage 
thought” does not exist. We are all primitives. We are the products 
of an evolutionary process that has lasted the same length of time 
for all of us. Differences in mental patterns between cultures do 
not result from any innate biological determining factor nor a 
typical historical process. We built our cultural differences; we can 
get rid of them if we want to.

“Essentialisation”
❋ In terms of dialogue between civilizations, we must 
avoid swinging from one “essentialisation” to another. History 
abounds with as many examples of Muslim tolerance towards 
Jews as it does with theologians’ violent calls to exterminate them 
in the name of God. It is as useful to teach the history of Muslim 
Andalusia in middle schools, for example, as it is fallacious to 
evade events such as the massacre of Grenada’s Jews in 1066. In 
this framework, the idea of tolerance must also be explained in 
its condescension, in the balance of power that it presupposes. 
Historicizing it, resisting anachronism, does not weaken the 
model but, on the contrary, puts it back into perspective and 
healthily inscribes it in the cycles of tension and conflicts we 
witness today.
Jocelyne Dakhlia
Research Director at the EHESS, Paris
 the Other
Who writes whose history?
❋ There is no denying that instead of helping to peacefully 
settle conflicts, the study and teaching of history is too often 
part of the problem. This is because the history taught does not 
always educate. At times, it inadvertently or deliberately fans 
the flames of conflicts or encourages repression, segregation, the 
manipulation of minds and even war. Accepting the gaze of the 
Other also means recognizing that peace and respect for human 
rights depend on an in-depth overhaul of educational content in 
order to promote quality education that will ensure the teaching 
of universally-shared values and civic education to foster peace.
A few figures speak volumes. In 1994, 4,363 history and 
geography books were published in France, 4,704 in the United 
States, 10,781 in the United Kingdom, 1 in Benin, 51 in Morocco 
and 208 in South Africa. In those conditions, what can people 
living in Africa, Asia and Latin America know about their 
civilizations and cultures? Who writes whose history? What gaze 
can the Other have, what gaze can be had of the Other, which 
amounts to asking, of oneself? The dialogue between civilizations 
is also important in the fight against poverty and inequality, 
which UNESCO has made a strategic priority.

The most powerful lever
❋ Education is the most powerful lever for promoting 
tolerance, understanding, dialogue, respect for diversity, 
human rights and democratic principles. The combination of 
these values and dimensions is what UNESCO calls the “quality 
of education”. It often requires an extensive revision of school 
textbooks, especially with regard to the critical presentation of 
relations between different cultures and among neighbouring 
countries. Strengthening cooperation in the area 
of university teaching means introducing and firmly rooting such 
changes in the region and fostering the emergence of a 
new generation of teachers and managers of modern teaching 
methods.
Education policies must ensure that cultural diversity 
becomes the driving force behind social cohesion. The systematic 
effort that education systems make to strengthen democratic 
citizenship and respect for human rights is an integral and 
essential part of this cohesion. Education for pluralism thus 
becomes an influential partner for political action in favour of 
pluralism.
Koïchiro Matsuura
Director-General, UNESCO
International convention 
❋ During the UNESCO General Conference this autumn, 
all of us were called on to state an opinion on the timeliness 
of drafting an international UNESCO convention to safeguard and 
promote cultural diversity. Switzerland believes it is important 
to seize this opportunity and will come out in favour of such 
an initiative. Because of its long-standing cultural mandate, 
expertise in the area of cultural diversity and universal character, 
UNESCO is the rightful and appropriate forum for drafting such 
a convention.

The lessons
of hist Melting pot
❋ Age-old Arab culture, we all know, is a synthesis, born 
of the marvels of Mesopotamia and ancient Egypt, patiently 
brought together with the mysteries of India and the Far East, 
the feats of the Phoenicians, the boldness of the Carthaginians, 
and the wisdom of the Greeks and Romans. In truth, it would be 
more appropriate to describe it as a melting pot of highly spiritual 
cultures, in which the human soul, totally purified, was able to 
open up to the Absolute and receive the Heavenly message.
Indeed, God chose our land as the locus of divine revelation, 
first Ur, then Egypt, Palestine and Arabia. Abraham, the father 
of all prophets, Moses, Jesus and Muhammed all had the same 
message: Do unto others as you would have them do unto you, 
love your neighbour as yourself.

A new mosaic
❋ Bosnia and Herzegovina is a special place for promotion 
of dialogue between different religions, cultures and civilisations. 
By using the basic principles of tolerance, by taking care of their 
own religious, cultural and national identity and by accepting 
others in their differences, peoples of Bosnia and Herzegovina are 
trying to bear witness to a probability of coexistence of different 
cultural circles and to putting together pieces of a new mosaic of 
common culture.
In the country, which has still been curing its war-time 
wounds, traumas and physical pain and which will for a long time 
remain saddled by tragic heritage of the last war, we try to use 
open dialogue and conversation even on the most painful issues 
as means of looking for paths of reconciliation and forgiveness.

A model for other regions 
❋ It is important to note that- from the Medieval Ages 
until the end of the 19th century - religion based animosities 
were much less frequent in the region than in Western Europe. 
When the main objective was the establishment of a central 
administration on the basis of a French example, leaders of the 
region were confronted with a contradiction that still exists today. 
What is more important: a unified, homogenous nation state or 
preserving the multifaceted culture of those living in the region? 
We still do not have a satisfactory answer to this question. It was 
this dilemma that was the cause of so much suffering and tragedy 
for the people of this region in the 1990s.
If our present meeting was to have a practical objective, then 
it should be to rally the values of cultural and religious diversity 
against hegemony and standardizing aspirations. UNESCO can 
play an active role in promoting the stability of the region, if 
after the adoption of the universal charter on cultural diversity; it 
develops the accompanying convention and helps to put that into 
practice. This is a significant challenge for all of us: to protect the 
autonomy of the individual from obsolete ideological concepts. 
Countries of South-eastern Europe are destined to use their values 
of cultural and religious diversity and to serve as a model for 
other regions of our continent.
Ferenc Mádl
President of the Republic of Hungary
Culture corridors 
❋ Several years ago, at the initiative of the Bulgarian 
National Committee of ICOMOS [International Council on 
Monuments and Sites], an international team was set up, which 
included representatives of all countries from South-East Europe. 
This team developed a common methodology, on the basis of 
which each country systematized its cultural and historical 
heritage into ages, plotting it onto its national map. Then, a 
smaller team aggregated these maps and made a common general 
map of the cultural and historical heritage of Southeast Europe.
The result has been amazing! The preserved and historical 
heritage formed clearly visible culture corridors, which were 
traced across our lands millennia and centuries back, and today 
they have not only survived as the living memory of civilizations 
in our region but stand as some of the strongest ties among 
our people. These cultural and historical corridors disregard 
boundaries. They start from the Adriatic, run across several 
countries and end at the coasts of the Black Sea. Others set 
off from the Mediterranean Sea and reach all the way into the 
Carpathian Mountains. Still others trail along the course of the 
Danube. These corridors or as the scholars called them, “cultural 
and historical routes”, date from various ages, they were set up by 
various civilizations in which our forefathers also had their share, 
yet they are here, in our lands, and they are our most treasured 
heritage through which we can and must present ourselves before 
the world, as one of the cradles of the world civilization.

Family reunion after 30 years 
between a Greek Cypriot and her 
uncle, a Turkish Cypriot in the 
Turkish part of Nicosia, July 2003
International anti-terror coalition 
❋ We witness with attention that the major conflicts in 
the region and the world are not the conflicts instigated by ethnic 
or religious motifs, but conflicts among the values of freedom, 
democracy and emancipated societies on one hand, and anti-
values on the other hand, such as totalitarism, extreme fanaticism 
and terrorism. When Albania joined the international anti-terror 
coalition led by the USA, it joined exactly for the purpose of 
protecting these major values of today’s civilization. We are 
convinced that this is an essential contribution to the preservation 
of peace and development.
Alfred Moisiu
President of the Republic of Albania
A window
❋ Cyprus was recently and formally welcomed to the 
European family. However, it still remains open to the diversity 
of its inner self. Significant efforts have been made, especially 
intensified during the last months due to political circumstances, 
in order to establish a solid channel of communication between 
the two communities, which co-exist on the island. This major 
process of intercultural contact has launched the initiation of 
the breaking down of stereotypes, which imprisoned for many 
years the thoughts of the people of Cyprus and constituted an 
important obstacle for the development of intercultural dialogue, 
thus facilitating outside interferences in the internal affairs of the 
Republic of Cyprus. Our aim is to take all necessary measures that 
promote a spirit of co-operation and establish peaceful conditions 
for the sake of prosperity and development of the country and its 
people as a whole. We are nevertheless aware, that we may have 
opened a window, however there is a lot to be done until the gate 
is really open, and the island is reunified.
Petros M. Kareklas
Permanent Secretary of the Ministry of Education and Culture, 
Republic of Cyprus
The outskirts of Europe
❋ The fate and the success of the new Europe and the 
European Union will depend on how relations among countries 
are arranged and on how the countries and nations that have for a 
long time been seen as ‘the outskirts of Europe’ are integrated in 
the European Union.
Stipe Mesíc
President of the Republic of Croatia
The priority of the question 
❋ Dialogue implies questioning by its very nature. 
Without accepting the priority of the question over the answer, 
we neither can conduct a genuine dialogue, nor develop a new 
understanding, nor gain new knowledge.
Ahmed Jalali
Islamic Republic of Iran, 
President UNESCO General Conference (2001-2003)
Life on the crossroads 
❋ There are churches and mosques, and synagogues and 
ancient sites standing side by side under this same sky. This is 
where the main roads connecting the East and the West went 
through. We understand our life on the crossroads of civilizations 
as an advantage and a treasure rather than as a curse and 
wretched fate.
Thanks to such understanding, our people have managed, in 
spite of all differences and attempts to manipulate national or 
religious feelings, to build permanent relationships of joint life 
and respect. The way in which the Republic of Macedonia faced 
the challenge in 2001 showed that there is only one solution to 
problems - dialogue. The culture of dialogue in our country is 
one of our most genuine values. In that spirit of dialogue and 
understanding, the Government of the Republic of Macedonia has 
undertaken all necessary measures not only to pave the way for 
the future in the shared homeland of all its citizens, but also to 
heal the wounds from the past, where a special place is given to 
the programme for renewing and reconstructing monuments of 
Christian and Islamic provenance damaged in the military actions 
of 2001.

Minister of Foreign Affairs, Republic of Macedonia

M E S S A G E  F R O M  O H R I D
adopted by the Regional Forum on the Dialogue among 
Civilizations, Ohrid, August 29-30, 2003
EXCERPTS:
Forgiveness will help rid the region from the biases and 
ignorances of the past.  A new generation of democratically 
elected leaders in the region promises a more peaceful future 
given their dedication to dialogue and genuine cooperation.
We are determined to demonstrate that the region can turn 
itself, through its own strategies and effective means of 
dialogue and engagement, into a vibrant space where people 
can jointly rediscover the stimulating wealth of differences, 
cultural exchanges and interaction as well as their multiple 
identities. 
Free societies can be created only upon the existence of free 
individuals, who are sovereign in choosing their political 
status and in following their own economic, social and cultural 
development.
We stress the equality of each cultural tradition and recognize 
the value of each civilizing experience as an invaluable and 
integral part of the commonly shared human experience […] 
Indeed, diversity is not a threat. 
We are convinced that dialogue represents a new paradigm of 
security, especially in a globalizing world.
We believe in an active role of the private sector in promoting 
economic development of the region.  
Education remains the most fundamental basis for promoting 
tolerance, understanding, dialogue, respect for diversity, human 
rights and democratic principles. These values and dimensions 
together make up what is called “quality education”, which 
often entails a revision of school curricula and textbooks. 
Scientific and technological cooperation is an important domain 
where progress can and must be made, in particular through the 
rebuilding of scientific networks and infrastructures.
Once respect for cultural heritage allows people to understand 
themselves, it will also be a key to understand others 
[…] It is imperative to develop a culture of conservation and 
preservation. This will help avoid that cultural heritage becomes 
a symbolic target of aggression and intentional destruction. 
The Ohrid Forum welcomes the project Cultural Routes in 
Southeast Europe.  
Educational systems need to be adapted to create a new 
computer-literate generation.
Strengthening independent media and its professionalism, 
upholding freedom of the press and of expression, and 
promoting the right of access to information and knowledge are 
major challenges for Southeast Europe. 
Drawing lessons from history, we agree that reconciliation is the 
path for our common future.

The long road 
to dialogue among 
civilizations
P
romoting mutual understanding 
between the peoples and civilizations 
of the world was already one of the 
objectives of the International Institute for 
Intellectual Cooperation (1925-1946), which 
preceded UNESCO – its archives have been 
incorporated into UNESCO’s. Leading intellectuals 
such as Albert Einstein and Chilean poet Gabriela 
Mistral (1945 Nobel Prize in literature) sought 
here to build “the defenses of peace in the minds 
of men” long before this vision became part of the 
preamble to UNESCO’s 1945 Constitution.
UNESCO started in 1949 a series of studies on 
“interrelations of cultures and their contribution 
For more than 
50 years, UNESCO has 
been promoting 
mutual understanding 
as a cornerstone 
for dialogue
April 10, 1957, the first 
session of the Committee 
for the “Major Project 
on Mutual Appreciation 
of Eastern and Western 
Cultural Values”, which 
continued ten years. At 
that time, UNESCO was

to international understanding” published as “The 
Cultural Essence of Chinese Literature”, “The 
Place of Spanish Culture”, “Notes on the Culture 
of the U.S.A.” and “The Basic Unity underlying 
the Diversity of Culture”. A committee of experts 
convened by UNESCO issued a statement on 
“Humanism of Tomorrow and the Diversity 
of Cultures”. The famous UNESCO collection, 
“History of Mankind”, was one of the outcomes 
of this quest for better mutual understanding. 
Launched in 1950, it was first published between 
1963 and 1976 (and recently reissued, see p.76).
A first statement on race problems was issued 
in 1950 by a UNESCO group of experts who 
observed that: “Race is less a biological fact than 
a social myth and as a myth it has in recent years 
taken a heavy toll in human lives and suffering”. 
UNESCO published “Race and History” in 1952 
and “Race and Culture” in 1971 by French 
this issue and member of the group.
CULTURAL COOPERATION
Between 1957 and 1966 UNESCO led a ten-
year programme, the “Major Project on mutual 
appreciation of Eastern and cultural appreciation 
of Eastern and Western cultural values”. Its 
activities included basic studies and research, 
education for youth and information for the 
general public, as well as UNESCO’s translated 
literature series, “Representative Works”.
Numerous projects and activities on cultural 
policies and international cultural co-operation 
were carried out in the 1960s and 1970s. The 
Mondiacult Conference, held in Mexico in 1982, 
adopted the Mexico Declaration on Cultural 
Policies, which remains an essential reference 
document. The World Decade for Cultural 
Development, 1988-1997, the Silk Road project in 
the 1980s, the Slave Route project and the Culture 
of Peace programme in the 1990s are milestones 
on the road to international understanding. 
Globalization represents a new challenge for 
UNESCO’s work; the adoption of the Universal 
Declaration on Cultural Diversity in 2001 can be 
seen as part of the response. 
The terminology and concepts have changed 
over the years, but whether the programmes 
stress pluralism, diversity or interculturality, they 
all reflect the same conviction that dialogue is 
essential for peace.

 Ensemble, a renowned 
Philippine theatre company made 
up of people who are disabled, 
from disadvantaged backgrounds 
or indigenous communities were 
appointed UNESCO Artists for Peace 
by UNESCO’s Director-General 
Koïchiro Matsuura on September 29.
The Ensemble, which has won 
accolades around the world for 
its moving performances, was 
nominated in recognition of its 
dedication to UNESCO’s aims 
and ideals and its contribution, 
through the performing arts, to the 
propagation and promotion of the

DaimlerChrysler
Mondialogo
The German-American automobile 
company DaimlerChrysler and 
UNESCO have launched the Mondialogo 
School Contest and Mondialogo Engineering 
Award as the main pillars of a partnership, 
known as Mondialogo, to promote 
intercultural exchange and tolerance. 
The Mondialogo School Contest is open 
to secondary school students aged 15 to 18. 
Each school will form a partnership with 
a school from another continent, to work 
on a project involving dialogue. Schools 
may, for example, develop a game, compose 
music, create art, record a video, compile 
a photographic document, write a story 
or poem, design clothing or jewellery or 
create an internet page. Two delegates from 
25 selected teams will be invited to the 
International Mondialogo Symposium, in 
Barcelona (Spain) in September 2004. Three 
teams will receive a prize of 500, 1,000 or 
1,500 Euros.
The Mondialogo Engineering Award aims 
to get university students in developed and 
developing countries working together on 
sustainable development projects. In March 
2005, an international jury will distribute 20 
Awards of 15,000 Euros each.

The children rushed towards 
the Constantza as soon 
as they saw her in the 
Algerian port of Mostaganem. With a 
crew of 140 and 60 artistes on board she 
looked more like a floating stage than 
a warship. And, when night fell, mime 
artists, singers, actors and visual artists 
ran onto the deck against a backdrop 
of fireworks, to the delight of the local 
audience.
Last summer the helicopter carrier 
- lent by the Romanian navy - left 
Constantza (Romania) for a 17-port tour 
of the Mediterranean, stopping notably 
in Varna (Bulgaria), Marseille (France) 
Valencia (Spain) and Hamammet 
(Tunisia). It was Richard Martin, the 
director of the Toursky Theatre in 
Marseille, who first dreamed of a theatre 
on a ship from which artists and acrobats 
could send a message of peace and 
dialogue in the Mediterranean, through 
shows based on the region’s culture. The 
dream first became reality in 2001, with 
the help of the International Institute of 
Mediterranean Theatre (IITM), which is 
supported by UNESCO’s Mediterranean 
Programme. According to the founder of 
IITM, Jose Monleon, “this was a voyage 
about ethics. As relations between 
East and West continue to worsen, the 
idea was to replace confrontation with 
dialogue.” 
At each stage of the voyage, different 
regional influences and cultures came 
together, in an exciting and innovative 
blend. “I realised that people knew 
nothing about my culture and the 
situation in Serbia,” said 
actor, Vladan Brkovic. In the 
Moroccan port of Tangiers, Marina Pittau 
sang of the mountains of her Sardinia 
homeland, while the stopover in Tripoli 
(Libya), featured a tribute to the work 
of the late French singer Léo Ferré. In 
Salonika (Greece) a film by Bulgarian 
directors Nina Kovacheva and Valentin 
Stefanoff was shown, in which actors 
read passages from Homer’s Odyssey in 
their own language.
Both on board and ashore the 
conversations were in Russian, 
Romanian, Arabic, English, French, 
Italian and Spanish. And when language 
became a barrier, music, dance, gestures 
and the eyes took over.

Human Rights
The University of 
Connecticut (UConn) 
hosts the first UNESCO 
Chair in the United States, 
which was created in 2001 
and named the “UNESCO 
Chair and Institute of 
Comparative Human Rights”. 
The partnership was made 
possible by the Chairholder, 
Amii Omara-Otunnu, a 
Ugandan who studied 
philosophy, political science 
and history at top universities 
in the West after fleeing his 
country for political reasons. 
A professor at UConn since 
1988, he created the Center for 
Comparative African Studies 
and a partnership between 
UConn and the African 
National Congress (ANC).
The Chair has developed 
close ties with Fort Hare, the 
renowned black university 
in South Africa, and with 
the Western Cape province 
(which led to the province 
and Connecticut becoming 
twin states), organizing 
exchanges between the two 
universities and inviting as 
visiting professor Dumisa 
Ntsebeza, a former member of 
the Truth and Reconciliation 
Commission in South Africa. 
It has also trained UConn 
students as human rights 
ambassadors.
One conviction, in 
particular, underlies 
Mr. Omara-Otunnu’s work. 
“I believe,” he says, “that 
unless we adopt an inclusive 
and comparative approach to 
the struggle for human rights, 
we run a two-fold risk: the risk 
of imposing our hegemonic 
perspectives and having an 
ethnocentric approach, or, 
on the contrary, the risk of 
degenerating into cultural 
relativism.”

Partnership
of Cities
C
ity-dwellers in the 
North dream of a 
house in the country. But 
in developing countries, 
the trend is for the rural 
poor to gravitate towards 
cities. By 2030, two-thirds 
of world population are 
expected to live in cities. 
But nature and city do 
not have to be mutually 
exclusive, according to 
delegates at a meeting 
on October 29 and 30 
entitled “Urban Biosphere 
and Society: Partnership 
of Cities”, at the New 
York Academy of Sciences 
(USA), co-sponsored 
by CUBES (Columbia 
University – UNESCO Joint 
Program on Biosphere and 
Society) and UN Habitat. 
Indeed, it emerged, 
cities have their own 
ecosystems and can even 
harbour species of plant 
and animal that have 
disappeared from the wild 
– ironically often because 
of human interference. At 
the meeting, scientists, 
planners, architects and 
mayors from cities as 
far apart as Cape Town, 
Chicago, Dar-es-Salam, 
Mexico City, New York, 
Rome, Seoul and São 
Paulo got together to 
compare experiences 
on making cities 
sustainable places 
to live, as well as 
places where natural 
and cultural diversity 
can be safeguarded. 
A question that was 
addressed, but left 
unanswered for the 
time being, is whether 
selected cities could 
one day become ‘urban 
biosphere’ sites, inscribed 
on UNESCO’s world list.

Learning to communicate
about religion
 S
ince September 2003, about 
200 students, journalists and 
commu nications professionals have 
been taking courses in the history 
of religion and communication 
at the University of Geneva. This 
new programme aims to help 
students better understand religious 
phenomena and their manifestations 
and learn to treat the subject 
objectively in the media and the 
communication field. Theology and 
religious history teachers as well as 
journalists are giving the courses.
The programme was created in 
partnership with the religious history 
department of the Ecole Pratiques 
des Hautes Etudes of Paris. It has 
received the support of UNESCO’s 
Interreligious Dialogue Programme, 
the Swiss National Commission 
for UNESCO, the Associations 
universitaires françaises and the

Water, source of dialogue
Some 100 hundred 
secondary school 
students and staff from seven 
countries in Europe and the 
Middle East – most of them 
from schools associated 
with UNESCO – got together 
last August in Schelklingen 
(Germany) to invent different 
ways of introducing the 
theme of water in the school 
curriculum. It was also a 
way of using a sensitive topic 
to spark dialogue between 
youth from vastly different 
backgrounds, and even regions 
in conflict.
Organized by the German 
Commission for UNESCO, 
the Central College in Galilee 
(Israel) and the Urspringschule 
in Schelklingen, the summer 
school, visited by experts 
and state officials concerned 
with freshwater management, 
achieved concrete results. 
The water issue, with its 
scientific, political, economic 
and cultural implications, will 
in effect be included in the 
programme of some 30 schools 
in Israel, the Palestinian 
Territories, Jordan, Greece, 
Cyprus, Great Britain and 
Germany. This reflection on 
education and water will also 
benefit the entire network of 
associated schools.
The meeting was organized 
with the cooperation of the 
German Federal Association 
of Water Industries (BGW) 
and the German agency for 
Technical Co-operation (GTZ).

The photos presented here are selected from Souvenirs d’humanité 
(Memories of Mankind), an album gathering winning pictures from 
the Humanity Photo Awards in 2002. This prize rewards photographers 
who bring the world’s diversity into focus. The international 
competition, created in 1998 under the auspices of UNESCO by the 
China Folklore Photographic Association (CFPA) and its founder Shen 
Che, has since collected photos taken in 120 countries.
Shen Che, a photographer, started a tour of China on bicycle in 
1980, training his lens on regions where ethnic minorities live.  After 
richly documenting their traditions and lifestyles, he might have ended 
the project.  But Shen Che realized how fragile and small his work was 
in such a fast-changing world.  So he founded the CFPA in 1983 to 
ensure that the library of visual records he started grew through the 
efforts and eyes of other photographers.  The association, which today 
has more than 20,000 members in China, is dedicated to preserving a 
trace, a concrete image, of cultural heritage -- in the full sense, covering 
all that sings, dances and lives in every society.

E
rik Reitzel’s Symbolic 
Globe, situated in 
the middle of the 
bright flags of UNESCO’s 190 
Members States, is indeed 
symbolic on several levels: its 
shape, its meaning, and the 
circumstances of its creation 
and installation.
Evoking the logo of the 
United Nations, the structure 
consists of an outside 
transparent sphere that holds 
within it another smaller 
sphere, solid and golden.  The 
Danish engineer conceived 
it for the World Summit on 
Social Development held in 
Copenhagen in March 1995.  
Made up of 10,000 aluminium 
rods, it was assembled in six 
days by the Summit delegates 
themselves in a gesture of 
solidarity underlining their 
countries’ commitment 
to development through 
diversity and dialogue.  The 
Danish government made the 
globe available to UNESCO 
for the Organization’s 50th 
anniversary, which was 
celebrated in November that 
same year.
The immense structure, 
which is firmly anchored 
with cables, has a diameter 
of 15 metres and weighs four 
tonnes.  It is representative of 
Reitzel’s theory on the identity 
of equations, developed in the 
early 1970s, that examines 
the correlation between the 
form of rupture lines and 
minimal structures.  His 
research focuses on functional 
structures using a minimum 
of material, and on the 
combination of material with 
new methods of construction.
The Symbolic Globe is a 
tribute to the marriage of the 
functional and the aesthetic, 
an alliance which is suited to 
both public and private sectors 
because it can be applied 
to all sorts of constructions, 
from big buildings to small 
structures.

UNESCO | the new Courier | January 2004
This 
groundbreaking 
work was the 
first aiming to present 
the entire history of the 
African continent, cradle of 
humanity. The collection 
sheds light on the pre-
colonial era and interweaves 
Africa’s destiny with the rest 
of humanity’s, examining 
its interaction with other 
continents and the role of 
Africans in the dialogue 
between civilizations.
“General History of Africa” 
opens with the beginning of 
the human race, and follows 
its evolution, with early forms 
of agriculture and artistic 
expression soon appearing 
(Volume I). In the northern 
civilizations, Egyptian and 
Ethiopian, as well as those 
to the South, particularly the 
Indian Ocean islands, ancient 
Africa reveals its riches 
and its construction, from 
Neolithic times to the seventh 
century of the Christian era 
(Volume II). Around the first 
millennium, the continent 
is marked primarily by the 
birth and dissemination 
of Islam in the north and 
Bantu expansion in the south 
(Volume III). From the 12th 
to the 16th century, Africa 
experiences the spread of 
Islam, increasing international 
exchanges particularly with 
Europe, and the founding of 
great empires and regional 
kingdoms, notably Mali, 
Songhay and Almohades 
(Volume IV). Between the 
16th and the 18th century, 
African kingdoms decline 
and disappear, traditional 
societies are transformed, and 
Europeans establish the slave 
trade (Volume V). Then, 
until around 1880, exchanges 
with the rest of the world 
intensify, the slave trade is 
abolished, and new states 
General History
of Africa
People writing their 
own history
 UNESCO began early on to publish histories of the world’s main regions. Instead of just tracing the 
past of nations, these collections aim to provide a greater understanding of civilizations. 
Through this broad perspective, readers gain a global understanding of the evolution of societies, flourishing of cultures, 
major currents of exchange and interaction with other parts of the world.
These collections also aim to provide a culturally relevant perspective. They provide the point of view of the populations 
concerned, whose past has often been distorted, discredited or treated as peripheral to the history of the colonizers 
and the dominant nations – those who usually write history. The idea here is to rediscover a people’s consciousness 
and the vision it develops of its own destiny. This shift in perspective is reflected by the significant number of 
local historians, with impeccable academic credentials, who contributed to these collections as editors and authors.

and organizations emerge 
in the midst of an economic 
transformation (Volume 
VI). At the end of the 19th 
Century, the continent is 
profoundly changed by 
European colonization 
which gives rise to African 
nationalism and the 
anticolonial movements that 
follow (Volume VII). Finally, 
at the end of World War II, 
contemporary Africa emerges 
from a difficult decolonization 
process, the apprenticeship 
of independence, and a new 
economic and political life 
(Volume VIII).

General History of Latin America
S
ome 240 historians 
and experts 
contributed to this 
exceptionally far-
reaching work. Five out 
of nine volumes have 
been published so far 
in Spanish (UNESCO 
Publishing/Trotta).
Volume I analyzes Latin 
America’s primitive 
populations and their 
social structures. 
Then, after Columbus 
and throughout the 
following century, 
colonization shatters 
local societies, setting off 
waves of epidemics and 
evangelization, while 
forcibly introducing a 
slave population from 
Africa (Volume II). From 
1550 to 1770, mores, 
culture and art evolve 
within a consolidated 
colonial society (Volume 
III). In the 18th century, 
the colonial policies of 
Spain and Portugal lead 
to their own collapse 
(Volume IV). In the 19th 
century, struggles for 
independence break out 
across the sub-continent 
(Volume V). 
A volume concerning the 
rise of Latin-American 
nations is now underway 
and will be followed by 
a detailed examination of 
national projects between 
1870 and 1930. A final 
tome explaining the 
work’s methodology will 
complete the collection.
Hardback edition,
format 17 x 25 cm, illustrated with 
photos and maps.
Price of each volume: €35.06 
General History of the Caribbean
S
ix volumes will cover the 
history of the islands of 
the Caribbean islands, east of 
the Central American coast. 
The islands are home to 
diverse populations – 
indigenous (Amerindians), 
Europeans (Spanish, British, 
French, Dutch) and Africans 
(victims of the slave trade) – 
who clash, cohabit, mingle 
and influence each other.
Four volumes have already 
been published in English 
(UNESCO Publishing/
Macmillan). The history of 
indigenous societies (until 
the arrival of the Spanish) 
goes back almost 10,000 
years, according to the latest 
archaeological findings 
(Volume I). The European 
colonial conquest throughout 
the 16th century installs a new 
society and gives rise to Creole 
culture (Volume II). A more 
detailed examination of the 
impact of slavery is provided 
in the third volume, followed 
by another presenting the 
methodology used to compile 
the collection. 
Titles to come will examine 
the 19th century with the 
abolition of slavery and 
the emergence of national 
movements (Volume IV), and 
the 20th century characterized 
by decolonization but also 
continued dependence on the 
West (Volume V).

History of Civilizations
of Central Asia
T
he “History of 
Civilizations of Central 
Asia” presents in six 
volumes the rich past and 
cultural heritage of the crossroads 
of civilizations that incorporates 
Afghanistan, northeast Iran, 
northern India, western China, 
Mongolia, Kazakhstan, Kyrgyzstan, 
Tajikistan, Turkmenistan and 
Uzbekistan.
Volume I, covers the period 
from the Paleolithic era to circa 
700 BC, and describes the first 
societies based upon agriculture, 
the early signs of urbanization and 
the history of nomadic peoples. 
From 700 BC to the middle of the 
3rd century of the Christian Era, 
nomadic and sedentary civilizations 
coexisted in the steppes and oases. 
Various competing or succeeding 
empires and kingdoms (Persian, 
Macedonian, Greek, Scythian, 
Parthian and Kushan) emerge in 
the region, a religious syncretism 
appears blending Zoroastrism, 
Greek cults and Buddhism, and 
trade flourishes along the Silk 
Roads (Volume II). From the 3rd 
to the 8th century, Central Asia is 
a prosperous melting-pot, where 
followers of Buddha, Zoroaster, 
Mani, Jesus Christ and the shamans 
coexist, as do the Muslims 
arriving after the Arab conquests 
(Volume III). The following 
seven centuries, are marked by 
the spread of Islam. The first 
part of Volume IV examines the 
roles of the Turks, the Kitans 
from southern Manchuria and 
the Mongols (Genghis Khan) in 
Central Asian history; the second 
focuses on religions, cultures 
and artistic expressions of this 
time. The period from 1500-1850 
(Volume V) marks the decline of 
the last medieval empires and the 
beginning of colonial domination. 
It also marked the decline of 
nomadism, and, in the religious 
sphere, the Shiite triumph in 
Iran, the conversion of Mongols 
to Buddhism, and the growth of 
the Sikh religion in northwestern 
India. The upcoming sixth 
volume will cover 1850 until 
today, as the region enters the 
modern era.

The Different Aspects
of Islamic Culture
In this collection, 
Volume II, “The 
Individual and Society in 
Islam”, has been published in 
French, Arabic and English. It 
focuses on the fiqh, or what 
is lawful or unlawful 
according to the Koran. This 
jurisprudence forms the basis 
of Islamic legal decisions, 
collective attitudes and 
individual behaviour. With a 
lively style, the authors 
analyze the creation of norms 
and values in Islam, without 
sidestepping the differences 
in interpretation and leaving 
room for colourful details. 
They give particular attention 
to contemporary issues such 
as the emancipation of 
women, contraception, 
human rights and the status 
of minorities, as well as the 
Islamic approach to 
economics, government, 
justice and ethics. 
Two other volumes have been 
published in English. Besides 
mathematics, astronomy 
and physics, “Science and 
Technology in Islam” (IV) 
covers technology and 
medicine, as well as advances 
made by Muslim scientists 
in cosmology, geology, 
mineralogy, zoology and 
botany. “Culture and Learning 
in Islam” (V) examines art, 
the human sciences, science, 
philosophy, mysticism, 
language and literature.

History of Humanity
W
ritten by the most 
distinguished scholars, 
“History of Humanity” recounts 
humankind’s extraordinary 
voyage through time, from its 
first faltering steps three million 
years ago. Every known culture is 
represented in this monumental 
overview.
The first volume covers 
prehistory, a period of millions 
of years that represents 99.8% 
of humanity’s past, from the 
emergence of the earliest “homo” 
beings to the invention of writing 
and the birth of the first states 
about five thousand years ago. 
The collection is divided into two 
major parts, corresponding to 
the periods before and after the 
start of food production. While 
some chapters present a global 
vision, others focus on specific 
periods in different regions. 
The development of prehistoric 
science and its methods are also 
examined.
The second volume (from 3000 
to 700 BC) focuses on the rise 
of the first states, science, the 
great religions, architecture, 
urbanization and cultural

exchange. The appearance of 
writing, an essential aspect 
of civilizations, allows us to 
understand the philosophical 
ideas, the poetic dreams and 
myths of ancient humans. The 
first of the volume’s three parts 
is thematic and covers such 
issues as the birth of scientific 
thought, the measure of time, 
metallurgy, the making of the 
great empires, the development 
of long-distance commerce, 
the first writings and linguistic 
families, religion, architecture 
and different art forms. The 
second part is devoted to regions 
for which written sources are 
available, and the third to those 
for which only archaeological and 
anthropological evidence exists. 
Each continent is portrayed with 
its wealth of extraordinarily 
diverse components.
The history of humanity then 
takes on speed, an acceleration 
reflected in the tighter 
organization of the next five 
volumes, the first four of which 
have been published in English.
