The occupation of vast

the movement is offering
new responses to the
greatest scourge of modern
Brazil—social exclusion.

of the ladder, 500,000 gr e at estat e s , ave r a-

of the fa ze n d a s are under-used, i n c l u d i n g

knapsacks.
Northeastern Brazil can no longer feed its inhabitants
because of the immobility of the agrarian structure
and the spread of desertification.Right,people in
Ceará State take to the road in search of a better life.
A combative art
The New York Times has hailed Brazilian photographer Sebastião Salgado as the author of “some
of the most compelling photojournalism in the last twenty years,” and as “an artist using journa-
lism as a vehicle for his art.” The French daily Le Monde has dubbed him “one of today’s masters
of black and white photography”.
The 53-year-old economist-turned-photographer has used Paris as a base for years while tra-
veling the world over for his extraordinary photo coverage of the “wretched of the earth”.Between
1986 and 1992, he scoured 26 countries on every continent to capture on film the impact of the
major social transformations taking place. The investigation resulted in a book (Workers: an
Archaeology of the Industrial Age, Aperture Books, 1993 ) published in nine languages and featu-
ring in some 60 exhibitions.
In 1994,Salgado began focusing on migrants. He decided to dedicate six years—up to the year
2000—to covering the hundred million international migrants and some 40 million who stream
into cities from the countryside each year in search of work.
“I want to state the case for migrants and those who take them in. To show their dignity in
their desire to integrate and their courage in facing their ordeals. To show how they contribute their
spirit of enterprise and the richness of their differences. To show, from the migrants’ example, that
we must build the family of all humankind on the basis of solidarity and sharing.”
Convinced that MST is “the only political movement really fighting for human dignity in
Brazil”,Sebastião Salgado has used his work as a photographer to support its struggle. The results
have proven to be a surprising success with “Terra” (Phaidon), a book of 109 photographs taken
in Brazil between 1980 and 1996 with a preface by the Portuguese writer José Saramago and a CD
by singer Chico Buarque. The book featured on Brazil’s best-seller lists for months, and has been
published in seven other countries. At the same time, 45 of the photos were used in an exhibition
of which 3,500 copies were made for Brazil alone, where they are being shown in trade union
offices, churches, universities, cultural centres and public places, as well as in MST premises.
Outside Brazil,non-governmental organizations like Frères des Hommes (France and Belgium),
Christian Aid (United Kingdom) and Solisfond (Switzerland) are promoting the exhibition, which
can be bought for $500.Proceeds from the exhibition and book sales will be used to set up a trai-
ning school for people working in the assentamentos orhomesteads. The celebrated architect Oscar
Niemeyer is ready to donate plans for the school,which is to be built in a suburb of São Paulo and
will enroll around a hundred students at each training session. ■

Today, their ranks have swelled to more
than 40,000. Moreover, about 150,000
families have recently been settled on over
five million hectares in more than 1,500
assentamentos, homesteads set up for the
beneficiaries—or the victors—of the batt-
le for agrarian reform.
After being at a standstill for decades,
land reform is starting to pick up speed
again. The first land redistribution law
dates back to 1964, but subsequent mili-

“For big landowners, the peasants’
demands are an intolerable threat,” says
João Pedro Stedile,a member of the MST
national executive. “They strike back vio-
lently with their henchmen or through  a
state machine in which they have a great
deal of leverage.”
The movement has nevertheless been
successful. In 1991, some 15,000 landless

Brazil’s agrarian structureHenrique Cardoso says that “the agrarian
structure, which was inherited from the
colonial peri o d , is inadequate and
unjust.” By settling 300,000 families on
more than 14 million hectares between
1995 and 1998, he claims that his
government will have done “more than
has ever been done in the past.” But this
leap forward is also the result of a shift in
the balance of power, for which the MST
is largely responsible.
The rural exodus, in which the urban
population rose from 30 to 80 per cent in
half a century, helped build a wall of
indifference between the towns and the
countryside.With great tactical expertise,
MST thrust the agrarian question into
the spotlight.At the same time,by forcing
its way into the big estates, the movement
has created a series of faits accomplis that
compel the government to take account
of the landless and negotiate with them.
The typical MST member is under thirty-
five, did not finish primary education,has
at least three children, is a descendant of
European immigrants who arri ved in
Brazil in the first half of the twentieth
century, and before joining the movement
worked either as a seasonal day labourer
or a full-time ag ricultural worker.
In just a few years, the movement has
managed to create a network of alternati-
ve economic and social ventures. For

cultural methods that are gradually gai-
ning ground among local farmers. Some
850 primary schools and 20 high schools
are up and ru n n i n g, while day - c a r e
centres and community restaurants are
easing women’s load of household chores.
The authorities can no longer sideline
the MST when it comes to agricultural
issues. By building a participatory and
egalitarian structure that goes against the
grain, it offers alternative perspectives to
broad swathes of Brazilian society. Its
adversaries denounce its political radica-
lism and illegal methods, while its defen-
ders call it Latin America’s most promi-
sing social movement. Brazilian econo-
mist Celso Furtado goes so far as to say
that it offers “the only answer to mass
u n e m p l oyment in Brazil” because “ a
return to subsistence agriculture is prefe-
rable to urban poverty.” The MST is
facing this challenge with the slogan of
“Agrarian reform: everyone’s struggle.” ■

E D I TO R I A L
THE UNESCO COURIER 11
A fresh outlook 
UNESCO’s connexion with the men and women around the world whose role it is
to discove r , to think and to communicat e , to work with knowledge and ideas, is at
the heart of its activities. This is  an enormous—and awe s o m e — p ri v i l e g e , a n d
UNESCO’s perspective on our times,on its promises and its failures,is all the sharper
and more original because of it.
The sharpness is due to the quality of the information UNESCO gathers from
leading specialists in the vanguard of international research and development in a
wide range of disciplines.The originality stems from the convergence and confronta-
tion of all these flows of information, which create a momentum that transcends the
barriers between disciplines and the borders between states. This perspective is thus
universal in the sense that it is both planetary and all-embracing.
What does it reveal? The range of possibilities facing humankind is now wider
than ever before, largely because of advances in science and technology. The speed
and scope of this expansion have led to a threshold effect, a leap into the unknown.
The balance has been disrupted between the rhythm of time, the division of space,
the assimilation of new knowledge, the authority of institutions and the exercise of
that authority. We are faced with an existential choice. Either we rush headlong into
the future, managing these upheavals in an unimaginative, short-sighted fashion. Or
else we acquire together the means to become informed, to analyse, discuss and eva-
luate the advantages and drawbacks of the possibilities available to us, before deci-
ding how we can move towards a future in
which everyone can benefit equitably and
thus peacefully from this immense stock of
knowledge.
In the twentieth century, physics and
chemistry made tremendous strides. Their
success brought abundant energy and made
it possible to manufacture countless pro-
ducts that have become invaluable in fields
ranging from medicine to telecommunications. In the twenty-first century, biology
and information technology will continue to advance and interact. As a consequen-
ce, far greater resources will be produced, for health care and agriculture, for
example.Humanity will also find it possible to accelerate or alter natural changes and
even to produce the genetic material of an “artificial nature” resulting from human
willpower and imagination.
But to what end? Is humankind engaged in a grand design, a common purpose?
Today, distances are shrinking, frontiers are disappearing and national sovereignty is
crumbling, yet there are no signs of the emergence of the twenty-first century’s pla-
netary agora, where such a design could be freely shaped, accepted and applied.
For now, the law of the survival of the fittest still prevails. Power lies in the hands
of those who combine possession of the most advanced knowledge with massive
resources. Walls are going up across the planet as well as within each nation. They
divide actors from spectators, subjects from objects, haves from have-nots in every
sphere of politics, economics, society, culture and education.
UNESCO has the privilege to receive this contradictory message, which holds out
tremendous hopes and warns of terrible dangers. It also has the duty to reflect it
accurately and spread it widely.The UNESCO Courier has always contributed to this
process. Its new format, the first issue of which you are now reading, remains faith-
ful to the magazine’s original purpose of presenting information and viewpoints from
leading world specialists. But it also breaks new ground as it seeks to provide livelier
coverage of the crucial issues of our time, and bring our ideals of peace, justice and
freedom closer to our readers. We hope that the Courier will stimulate you to think
anew about the world. ■

For almost a year now, vast forested
tracts of the globe have been burning
d own one by one. It all began in A u g u s t
1997 in Malaysia and Indonesia. Then in
April this year it happened in the Amazon,
the Philippine island of Pa l awan and ele-
ven States in Mexico.
On 19 September 1997 a state of
emergency was declared in Sarawak, the
Malaysian State in the northern part of
the island of Borneo. About two million
people were wa rned to stay indoors
because of the thick smoke (twelve times
more carcinogenic than tobacco smoke)
from forest fires in Kalimantan,the island
of Sulawesi and Irian Jaya, in Indonesia.
Fumes from the hundreds of thousands of
hectares ablaze affected some 70 million
people in Southeast Asia to va ry i n g
degrees.
Indonesian environment minister
Sarwono Kusumaatmadja said the health
of 20 million of his compat riots wa s
threatened.The least hardy of them died.
Many accidents occurred. Air and sea
traffic was disrupted. An Airbus plane
crashed in Sumatra on 26 September
1997, killing 234 people.
El Ninõ’s fault?
The guilty party was said to be El Niño
(which in Spanish means the Chri s t
Child), a climatic phenomenon which
appears at Christmas-time every three or
four years, and sometimes every seven to
ten.When the trade winds, which usually
blow across the Pacific from east to west,
lose strength, an enormous mass of warm
air about the size of the United States,
normally held in position by winds near
Indonesia,heads for the coast of Peru and
then moves away in the opposite direc-
tion, towards the east.
This movement is part of a climat i c
flu c t u ation known as the El Niño Southern
O s c i l l ation (ENSO) which is thought to be
responsible for the we ather disturbances
around the world last year and this.
In 1997, the monsoon rains came late.
In Indonesia, the fires began in August
during one of the most severe droughts of
the past fifty years. In fact, they had been
smouldering since 1982-83, when a hea-
vily-logged area of 3.5 million hectares—
as big as Belgium—had bu rn e d . T h e
conflagration was helped along by the
abundance of peat in Kalimantan, as well
as by seams of coal and lignite which
sometimes run close to the surface. Even
heavy rains failed to put out the smoulde-

ring fires which burned on for lack of
bulldozers to cut wide trenches to act as
firebreaks.
But if unusual weather fanned the
flames, the main culprits were human
beings. A distinction must be made bet-
ween small peasant and big farmer. Both
use fire as a tool, but to different degrees.
A fire on one hectare of land can be put
o u t . Bigger conflagr ations cannot be
controlled and lack of water and fire-figh-
ting equipment, along with difficult
access, mean that forests are lost.
Fire has always enabled the native
peoples of Borneo and Sumatra to live off
the land.Their often-criticized slash-and-
bu rn method of cultivation is not as
harmful to the environment as is some-
times thought, as long as the land is left
fallow for some time.The soil is not natu-

of greed
rally fertile, so the absorption of ash from
fire over two or three years enriches it.
The secondary forest grows back and fif-
teen or twenty years later the peasants
burn it down again.
Miriem Bouamrane, a young econo-
mist who has lived in Java and Sumatra
and works for the International Centre for
Research on Agroforestry (ICRAF) based
at Bogor, near Jakarta, cites the Dayaks,
one of the region’s main ethnic groups, as
an example. “They aren’t being irrespon-
sible,” she says. “These are age-old prac-
tices. They live in very close contact with
nature and only burn a small area and
watch that it doesn’t spread. They also
worship trees in their religion and are
always planting them. They use the pro-
ducts of the trees but also save from
extinction species like the damar, which
produces the resin which is their main
source of income.” The most convincing
evidence of this is that just about the only
places where the tropical forest survives
are the areas where the Dayaks live.
But the “settlers” which the govern-
ment encourages to leave overpopulated
Java with an offer of between one and five
hectares of land on neighbouring islands
behave differently. They do not have the
same knowledge and try to make quick
profits growing rice, pepper or coffee.
Scorched earth
The Brazilian State of Roraima, along the
border with Venezuela and Guya n a , we n t
up in flames in Ja n u a ry 1998. But accor-
ding to an official of the Amazon Research
Institute (INPA ) , the fire really began
there twenty-eight ye a rs ago, when the
t h e n - m i l i t a ry gove rnment began the sett-
lement of Brazil’s Amazon interior by
l u ring small fa rm e rs from the ove r c r ow-
ded south-central and nort h - e a s t e rn part s
of the country. “In 1978,” s ays Reinaldo
B a r b o s a , “the State had 80,000 inhabi-
t a n t s , 32,000 of them Indians, and was 72
per cent forested. By 1996, the populat i o n
had gr own to 262,000. The settlers
conquered Amazonia by bu rning dow n
the forest.” Like the settlers in Indonesia,
the newcomers in Roraima had used fir e

and 1996 cleared land increased fif t y - f o l d .

Fe a rs for a new millennium
Genetic manipulation, the emergence of unknown viruses and the impact of new information
technology are three fears of the future shared by environmentalists and the public at large.
In the next 20 years, specialists say, radically new threats will be added to the list of those beset-
ting the planet today. In a survey carried out in 72 countries by the French ministries of research and
the environment with support from the European Commission, a thousand scientists were asked to
rank the dangers in order of importance.The poll’s results were published in early 1998.
Genetics and biotechnology top the list of concerns. “Basically this has to do with genetically
m o d i fied organisms,” says Alain Pavé of the French National Centre for Scientific Research (CNRS).
“ People are afraid that genes introduced into certain plants will spread into the environment. Th i s
is possible either through hybridization of different plant species or through a virus that picks up
the genes and takes them elsewhere.”
S e c o n d , researchers are afraid that the results of their work are analysed too hastily. “ C l i m a t e
forecasting is a typical example,” says Pa v é .“ The models converge where temperature increase
at planetary level is concerned, but there is no agreement as to how it will affect different regions.
The data we have cannot justify worldwide measures to cut greenhouse gas emissions.”This does
not prevent catastrophic scenarios on the consequences of global warming in local contexts from
making the rounds.
Researchers themselves are sometimes tempted to engage in more or less inspired guess-
w o r k . For example, they fear the emergence of new diseases “through fear of viruses like HIV or
Ebola spreading from their natural environments,” Pavé says. “In all like l i h o o d , Aids developed as
a result of contact between people and wildlife in central A f r i c a . But we still don’t know what
mechanisms govern these phenomena.”
Some scientists are wary of new information technology, which they regard as a threat to
d i v e r s i t y. “Our environment is shaped by culture,” Pavé explains. “If societies become standardi-
z e d , so will landscapes.” H o w e v e r, he acknowledges that no one knows what the long-term
effects of information technology will be. Perhaps that’s precisely why people are worried.

The forest—a refuge and a nurs e ry —
was their foe. “The plans of the Settlement
and A gr a rian Reform Institute (INCRA)
only spread pove rty by encouraging the
s e t t l e rs to destroy the forest,” s ays Barbosa.
“The proof is that a hectare of cleared land
in Roraima is wo rth ten times more than a
hectare of forest.” The Env i r o n m e n t a l
Institute (IBAMA) suggests that the sett-
l e rs , who are officially not allowed to clear
more than half of their 100-hectare plots,
s t a rt fires illegally to do the job.
Land ownership is crucial in a country
where two per cent of the landowners
possess more than half the surface area
being farmed and are greedy for more.
Walter Blos, head of the National Indian
Foundation (FUNAI), warns that many
white farmers are keen to get their hands
on the 10 million hectares of Indian reser-
vations that fires have already significant-
ly encroached upon.
Stricter laws
In Indonesia, timber companies and com-
mercial tree plantations have been quite
legally carving up the tropical forests for
more than fifteen years in pursuit of
maximum returns. And fires stoke up the
profits. Not only do the logging compa-
nies not have to clear the forest floor of
unsaleable timber, but they enable the
fire-cleared ground to be planted with
crops like palm oil or eucalyptus which
bring in quick profits.
According to Indonesia’s forestry
minister, between 500,000 and 700,000
hectares of forest have been turned into
plantations in the past fifteen years. On
the burned forest areas, which range in
size from 300,000 to 900,000 hectares,
560 deliberately-started fires were recor-
ded. Sometimes this was to the detriment
of the perpetrators: according to the UN
Food and A griculture Organizat i o n
( FAO ) , the fires in mid-October also
consumed 76,000 hectares of productive
forest and 90,000 hectares of coconut,
palm oil and rubber plantations.
President Suharto reminded the
country that starting fires had been ban-
ned since 1995, but this did not deter the
big companies. In October 1997, 160
Indonesian firms were found responsible
for starting fires. Out of forty-six investi-

g at i o n s , f i ve led to legal action. I n
Malaysia, the seventeen firms found guil-
ty were fined a total of $8,000 and that
was that. In Brazil, President Cardoso
signed an environmental protection mea-
sure into law on 12 February. It does not
punish slash-and-burn, so as not to pena-
lize Amerindians like the Dayaks, who use
the method with care. But it decrees pri-
son terms and the closure of firms found
guilty of ecological crimes. It is tougher
than the law it replaced, which only
enabled the government to collect six per
cent of the fines imposed. But will it be
more of a deterrent?
The experts at ICRAF are very pessi-
mistic. “The forest fires in Indonesia will
not stop until all the country’s forests
have disappeared,” they say. The cause of
the fires in the Amazon and Mexico are
the same. Are the forests there also doo-
med to destruction? ■

ome people who want to die know that
p a r a q u at is a cheap, e f f e c t i ve poison.
Just one teaspoonful is all it takes.
Trouble is, the herbicide also brings a slow
d e ath to those who want to live .
A 1996 Greenpeace study says that
managers of rubber and palm oil planta-
tions in Malaysia, including some owned
by Western companies, were using and
over-using paraquat and many other high-
ly toxic substances. When inhaled or
absorbed through the skin, they can
damage the liver, kidneys and lungs and
cause nosebleeds, miscarriages, sterility,
cancer, and neurological and behavioural
disorders.
In the southern countri e s , they are
often sprayed excessively by poorly-infor-
med fa rm wo r k e rs who lack protective
e q u i p m e n t . They can be found in markets
b e t ween the sugar and the washing pow d e r
in harmless-looking boxes that do not
make the slightest mention of their harm-
ful effects.
D avid Pimentel, a specialist at Corn e l l
U n i ve rsity in the United Stat e s , s ays that
each year pesticides kill 220,000 people
and make another three million sick.
“Eighty per cent of all pesticides are used
in the developed countri e s ,” he notes, “ bu t
f e wer than half the poisoning deaths occur
t h e r e .” In all, 25 million wo r k e rs are at ri s k
in developing countri e s.
An expanding marke t
O ver- and carelessly-used pesticides not
only kill people. They endanger the future
as we l l . Pimentel says their indiscri m i n at e
use “causes $100 billion wo rth of damage
to the environment eve ry ye a r ,” i n c l u d i n g
$8 billion in the United States alone.
Among other things, pesticides kill the
n atural enemies of certain pests, b o o s t
those pests’ resistance to chemicals, d e s-
t r oy pollinating insects, fish and birds and
c o n t a m i n ate food, water and soils.
M e a n w h i l e , business is booming. T h e
world pesticides market has gr own steadily
over the past decade. In 1996 estimat e d
sales amounted to approx i m ately $30 bil-
l i o n , according to Barbara Dinham of T h e
Pesticides Tru s t , a London-based non-
g ove rnmental organizat i o n . “The pesti-
cides trade,” she say s , “is dominated by ten
major agrochemical companies who
control 80 per cent of global sales.”
E u r o p e , the United States and Japan are
the main export e rs ,f o l l owed by deve l o p i n g
c o u n t ries such as India, C h i n a , M e x i c o,

Tightening the rules
So fa r , legal curbs on the trade are only

( P I C ) , asking countries exporting “ e x t r e-

mission from importing countri e s. B u t
only the European Union has made the
procedure mandat o ry. A convention on

cals that will be signed in Rotterdam this
September aims to make it unive rsally bin-

will be.

16 THE UNESCO COURIER
United Nations Environment Progr a m m e
( U N E P ) ,n i n e t y - five countries agreed on a
draft last March. It says that the products
c o n c e rned—so far only twe n t y - t wo pesti-
cides and five other industrial chemicals
t h at are banned or strictly regulated in two
c o u n t ries in different regions—can only be
e x p o rted with the importing country ’s
explicit consent.
W hy not ban the trade outri g h t ?
“There is no global consensus,” s ays Pa u l
W hylie of Ja m a i c a ’s Pesticides Control
A u t h o ri t y. He argues that “the Conve n t i o n
is another means of putting pressure on
m a n u fa c t u r e rs because they have to go
through heavy procedures.” But that still
does not mean they will be used.
“ G ove rnments will not reject a pesticide,
e ven a ve ry hazardous one,” Dinham say s ,
“if the country makes heavy use of it,
unless they have a substitute that costs the
s a m e .” Carl Smith of FASE adds, “I don’t
think the PIC agreement will reduce the
trade in chemicals. But it’s a step in the
right direction” which shows that gove rn-
ments are at least willing to share inform a-
t i o n . The stakes are high. “ D ata does
e x i s t ,” Smith say s ,“ but it is generally guar-
ded by industry as ‘ c o n fidential bu s i n e s s
i n f o rm at i o n ’ . Without a clear picture of
w h at the countries part i c i p ating in the PIC
process are importing and export i n g, it will
not be possible to know if the parties are
abiding by the conve n t i o n .”
Troublesome re s i d u e s
FAO estimates that there are more than 100,000 tonnes of obsolete pesticides in developing coun-
tries, including 20,000 in Africa.Stocks in the Near East countries are put at 5,000 tonnes. Several
countries in Asia and Eastern Europe have stocks in excess of 5,000 tonnes each.Due to the absen-
ce of environmentally sound disposal facilities stocks are constantly increasing. Some are over 30
years old.
Disposal costs vary from $3,500 to $5,000 per tonne. Costs of disposing of pesticide stocks in
Africa alone are estimated at over $100 million. The best disposal methods is high-temperature
incineration, according to FAO. None of the developing countries—except for a few newly indus-
trialized nations—have facilities for the safe and environmentally sound disposal of pesticides.
Without financial support from agro-industry, governments and aid agencies, this environmental
problem cannot be solved.
FAO has published guidelines in English, French,Spanish and Arabic on the accumulation,sto-
rage and stock control and disposal of bulk quantities of obsolete pesticides.

PIC does not provide for sanctions on
ru l e - b r e a k e rs , and there are plenty of ways to
get around the agr e e m e n t . Especially since
production of most outdated hazardous che-
micals is increasingly located in deve l o p i n g
c o u n t ri e s. For example, India manufa c t u r e s
DDT and China produces chlordane and
a l d ri n . If these countries see economic bene-
fits in producing hazardous pesticides, t h e y
will most likely continue producing them.
This raises an ironic possibility. In the end,
the developing countries that the conve n t i o n
is intended to protect could become the lea-
ding export e rs of chemicals on the PIC list.
F u rt h e rm o r e ,W hylie adds,“A pesticide may
be shipped as a consumer chemical, l i k e
p h a rmaceutical products and cosmetics,
which are not subject to PIC procedures.
Hazardous substances can always trave l
under those labels.” And then there’s the
black market. “The convention doesn’t
address illegal trafficking,” s ays Fat o u m at a
N d oye of the Gambia’s Hazardous
Chemicals and Pesticides Control and
Management Board. “Our borders are
p o r o u s.We need resources for the training of
customs officers.”
But at a time when development aid is
d w i n d l i n g, no additional funding to train
people how to handle, inspect and control
hazardous substances is planned. Yet that
m ay be exactly where the efforts should
b e gi n .
The organic alternative
If fa rm wo r k e rs knew how to use pesticides
p r o p e r l y, consumption would be cut in half,
Pimentel say s. In some countri e s , such as
S we d e n , consumption has already plumme-
ted by over 50 per cent. L i k e w i s e ,I n d o n e s i a
has slashed the use of pesticides on rice by
65 per cent while boosting the crop yield by
12 per cent. B u t , adds Pimentel, “ p e o p l e
use more of them than they should because
pest control is a complex technology.”T h e y
are spurred on by aggr e s s i ve chemical
i n d u s t ry adve rtising campaigns and easy
access to chemicals, which are sometimes
i m p o rted to southern countries as part of
d e velopment aid progr a m m e s.
Smith says the intensive use of pesti-
cides is just one link in a food production
chain that few call into question.
“ C h e m i c a l - i n t e n s i ve , e x p o rt-based agri-
culture has one clear benefit : cheap food
for citizens of developing countri e s. It is
also clear that fa rmland has been degr a-
d e d , ecosystems polluted and the va riety of
subsistence crops diminished.The number
of landholders is decreasing and profit s
from agriculture are concentrated in fewe r
h a n d s. These trends create a climate that
encourages the marketing and use of pesti-
c i d e s. Organic methods are more time-
i n t e n s i ve and may require more wo r k e rs.
In the short ru n , an organic approach
might seem less profit a b l e .” For whom? ■

led the National Qualific ations Framewo r k .
A committed pastor and citizen, Isaacs was at
the forefront of the anti-apartheid stru g g l e .
E d u c ation and professional training
were at the heart of the political stru g g l e

bloody crackdown in 1976.
M a ny grassroots organizat i o n s , l o c a l
church and religious groups and wo m e n ’s

3 per cent of architects and 0.1 per cent of

t i o n ,Whites held 96 per cent of manageri a l
p o s i t i o n s , and while the country ’s economy
is based on mining, there has only eve r
been one black mine manager.The result of
these discri m i n at o ry policies is 38 per cent
u n e m p l oyment among Blacks, c o m p a r e d
to 6 per cent for W h i t e s.
Qualification certificates
Under the new system currently being
d e ve l o p e d , students with “ n o n - f o rm a l ”
training may enter the “ f o rm a l ” e d u c at i o-
nal system at any age. Students leav i n g
school at any level must have access to pro-
fessional training.
“In concrete term s ,” s ays Isaacs, “a per-
son with ten ye a rs ’ on-the-job experience in
a c c o u n t a n cy will be able to obtain a cert i fi-
c ate that will allow him or her to get a pay
r a i s e , apply for a job as an accountant
somewhere else or continue training—to
become a chartered accountant, f o r
e x a m p l e . A highly qualified nurse who
wants to study medicine will enter medical
studies at the interm e d i ate leve l .”
Around forty Education and Tr a i n i n g
Q u a l i fic ation Assurance Bodies (ETQA)
will be authorized to issue “ q u a l i fic at i o n
c e rt i fic at e s ” in eve ry industry, from chemi-
cals to transport at i o n , retail and env i r o n-
mental protection. An inve n t o ry of all the
available training opportunities in the
c o u n t ry is being drawn up. At the same
t i m e , schools and unive rsities will have to
change their programmes to make more
room for science and technology and
encourage gr e ater self-sufficiency on the
p a rt of the learn e r. The reform , which is
called Curriculum 2005, should be com-
pleted by that ye a r.
To fund the progr a m m e , e m p l oye rs ,
including the stat e , must pay a training tax
amounting to between one and 1.5 per cent
of their wage bill. Some companies already
offered training progr a m m e s , mostly to
m a n a g e rial staff. But in 1996, 42 per cent
of companies spent less than one per cent
of their wage bill on training, and 56 per
cent of small firms offered no training at all.
Each year the gove rnment increases the
p r o p o rtion of the education budget alloca-
ted to adult education and training.
Although the amount seems minimal—one
per cent of the total education bu d g e t — i t
has doubled since 1994. In 1997, 450 mil-
lion rands, or $83 million, were spent on
adult education and training.
To d ay, 10 to 15 million adults in South
A f rica lack basic education or skills.An ave-
rage 350,000 adults take training cours e s
each ye a r , but the SAQA expects that the
figure will rise to 700,000 in 1998 and 2.5
million by 2001.
It remains to be seen whether these tar-
gets will be met. Some specialists wonder if
the reform is not too complex for a still-
d e veloping country and fear that the system
favo u rs the best qualified wo r k e rs. A b ove
a l l , c ritics point to a contradiction betwe e n
the gove rn m e n t ’s education plan and its
free-market economic policies, with bu d g e t
c u t b a c k s , especially in educat i o n . S t i l l ,
South A f ri c a ’s far-reaching educat i o n

Na d i a , a fif t e e n - year-old A l g e rian gi r l ,

1997/98 school ye a r. It was impossible
to admit her to the final stage of secondary

F r e n c h .When she was sent to the Robert
Schumann School to take a Vo c ational Inser-
tion Cours e , or “ C i p p a ” (Cycle d’Insert i o n
Professionnelle par A l t e rn a n c e ) , she expec-
ted the wo rs t . Little did she imagine that she
would soon be working in radio, films and
p u b l i s h i n g, as well as teaching Arabic to her
c l a s s m ates and teachers.
“It all started fourteen ye a rs ago,”
explains Jean-Luc Muracciole, a literat u r e
teacher who is responsible for the Rheims
C i p p a , “when the Education Ministry crea-
ted a scheme to enroll school dropouts in a
sandwich cours e , where they’d work two
weeks for a firm and spend two weeks in a
booster class to prepare them for readmis-
sion to the normal educational progr a m-
m e .” Muracciole has taught in prisons so he
has personal experience of problem situa-
t i o n s — but even so, he took on the task with
considerable trepidat i o n . It would be no
easy task, he thought, to teach these yo u n g
people a trade with a minimum of dignity
attached to it.
Instead of trying to adapt the students
to the school system, Muracciole tried to
adapt the system to the students. He broke
d own the barri e rs between the major sub-
ject areas, using sound and pictures to esta-
blish an audiovisual link between phy s i c s
and languages. Instead of conjugating ve r b s ,
the students are taught to communicat e
with the outside wo r l d , where they learn
h ow to make films about subjects discussed
in the classroom, taking turns as camera-
m e n , a c t o rs , set designers , d i r e c t o rs and
press agents. P h i l o s o p hy, which is taught in
the final ye a rs of secondary school, is used
as a bridge between maths and French.T h e
students read the works of modern authors
and then meet them personally in radio
i n t e rv i e w s , to gi ve them a taste of journ a-
lism and production.
The courses are gi ven à la cart e : s o m e
are taught to the entire class, while others
are gi ven individually or to small gr o u p s.
Three teachers cover the basic subjects.

is also helpful in preparing the students for
F r a n c e ’s school-leaving diploma, the bacca-
l a u r e at : “It enables the students to take part
in unive rsity or professional life, and it helps
u s , the teachers , to eva l u ate our methodolo-
gy by comparison with the traditional sys-
t e m . One year we had a 100 per cent success
r at e .”
Adapting the system 
to the students
C u rr e n t l y, a nyone at least sixteen ye a rs old
who has failed to complete his or her secon-
d a ry education (and this includes vo l u n t a ry
dropouts) can register with Cippa and
continue studying.The only snag: the maxi-
mum quota of 24 places is being ove r - fil l e d
with more than 50 students per ye a r , a n d
there is a long waiting list which could soon
easily reach 500. Muracciole wants to go
f u rther and create an experimental school—
and he is doing his best to persuade the
a u t h o rities to provide the funds.
Romain, who recently entered the
s c h o o l ,d e s c ribes how he threw in the towe l
just before the end of the final year of secon-
d a ry school: “I couldn’t take it any more, i t
was such a rat race. My friend Stéphane
told me how gr e at Cippa wa s , so I decided
to regi s t e r. After the first we e k , I felt com-
pletely at home. Here we ’re taught by the
older pupils as well by the teachers. I t ’s like
one big fa m i l y.When classes are over we go
on talking things over . . . in the street or in
a café. People talk about eve rything under
the sun.” Stéphane entered Cippa in lat e
M ay of 1997, after dropping out of high
school and, l at e r , the Compagnons de
France crafts school. So far he has taken
p a rt in filming the first two of a series of
t h i rt y - five videos commissioned by the
French Museums Serv i c e , and he love d

Social Sciences, and came to Cippa three
ye a rs ago. Since then she has tried her hand
at all kinds of things: book publishing (the
house publishing firm , “La Te rra Tr e m a ” ,
already has six books to its credit); an exhi-
bition on Italian writer and film-maker Pier
Paolo Pa s o l i n i ; and the editing of a feat u r e -
length film entitled L’ o ralité en question,
which a team of her classmates shot in
M a rr a k e s h .
Oral communicat i o n —o ra l i t é—is one of
the main ve c t o rs in the transfer of know l e d-
g e , as Jean-Luc Muracciole is fully awa r e :
“ For young second and third generat i o n
N o rth A f ri c a n s ,” he say s , “Arabic is the lan-
guage for expressing feelings, while French is
the language of authori t y, order and obliga-
t o ry integr at i o n . French has a harsh image,
and by increasing the proportion of oral
c o m m u n i c ation in the classroom, we help
them bring the two cultures closer together.”
The students are responsive to the idea.
After Marr a k e s h , one film crew has gone on
to shoot a movie with the Gypsies of
R o m a n i a , another is in Corsica—an expe-
rience which has awakened an interest in
r e gional languages. “I discovered Cors i c a n
at a concert gi ven by the ‘I Muvri n i ’ gr o u p,”
s ays Fred, with all the authority of his twe n-
ty ye a rs. He feels he has learned enough at
Cippa to enter unive rsity to take a liberal
a rts course or enroll in a film school. He is
already at wo r k , outside Cippa, on a radio
p r o j e c t . He knows about radio from his
hour-long programme eve ry Sat u r d ay night
on Rheims’ “Radio Pri m i t i ve ” ,i n t e rv i e w i n g
French and North A f rican wri t e rs.
New pro j e c t s
This year the students are leaving the radio
studio for one of the best cafés in Rheims,
the Brasserie Bleue, to hold philosophical
d e b ates attended by several hundred people
from all walks of life. In autumn they will
launch the first issue of a quarterly magazi-
n e , Salle d’Attente ( “ Waiting Room”), a s
well as start working on a CD-RO M .
This educational experiment—the only
one of its kind in France—has already pro-
ved its wo rt h . According to a report by the
Rheims education authori t y, 99 per cent of
the school’s gr a d u ates have found their
place in society.The course could be used as
a model in other areas, where the school
dropout rate is even more alarm i n g . Je a n -
Luc Muracciole believes that , in countri e s
with a strong oral tradition, the method
would be even more successful than in
France: “We’ve seen proof of this in
Morocco and Romania. Cippa hopes to
‘ t w i n ’ with schools in other countri e s , s o
t h at we can introduce their teachers to some
of our methods.” ■

H a rd times for teachers
The wo r l d ’s 57 million pri m a ry and secondary school teachers work in conditions that
are a matter for concern.They are neglected by educational policies and are benefit-
ting little from the new technologies which were supposed to revolutionize their pro-
fession.The latest (1998) edition of UNESCO’sWorld Education Report is categorical:
“. . . it has not just been teachers’salaries and status which have failed to benefit in recent
ye a rs from policies towards public expenditure on educat i o n ,” the report points out.“ Te a-
ching and learning conditions and the material situation of the schools generally, in pro-
bably a majority of countries,have also failed to benefit.”
In the countries of the South, the number of pupils and students has exploded in
recent decades. But the number of teachers, their salaries and above all school equip-
ment have not kept pace because of budgetary belt-tightening. In India, over 60 per
cent of primary school teachers teach more than 50 pupils on average, 34 per cent teach
between 51 and 100, and 5 per cent over 100. Many schools have no blackboard and
in some cases no desk for the teacher, and few textbooks, if any.
In the industrialized world, “students’ social behaviour”is “of growing concern in a
number of countries”.The Report denounces violence at school, which is detrimental
both to teachers’ morale and to educational efficiency.
The Report shows the limits of hopes vested in new technologies by recalling that
most of the world’s schools do not even have electricity. At best the new technologies
help to stimulate “thinking and debate about teaching and learning” and enable tea-
chers “to ‘network’with other teachers about what they are doing”. Perhaps to tell each
other about what a hard day they have had. N. K-D. ■

‘How can the ocean be in trouble? It’s so
h u g e ! ”The speaker, an avid fis h e rm a n ,
had just read an article about pollu-
tion creating a so-called “dead zone”in the nor-
thern Gulf of Mexico, and was sceptical.“I love
the ocean,” he said.“But I can’t imagine that we
can do much to harm a system so large and resi-
lient.The sea seems infinite,timeless!”
My friend’s perception of the ocean has
been a common one—until recently. As the
waters of the world have become increasingly
stressed, an awareness of their importance to
humankind has come into sharp focus.
Fishermen find it increasingly difficult to find
once numerous species—cod, capelin, swordfi-
sh and many more. Phenomena such as the El
Niño have created widespread appreciation of
the role of the ocean in shaping climate and
weather. Water evaporates from the sea’s surfa-
ce and forms clouds that yield fresh water back
to the land—and sea. About 97 per cent of
Earth’s water is marine, and of the remaining 3
per cent, 97 per cent is frozen as polar ice and
snow. Water, of course, is vital for life. There
may be water without life, but nowhere, even in
the most arid deserts and driest valleys in
Antarctica, is there life without water.
The recent discovery of water on Europa,
one of Jupiter’s moons, has aroused much spe-
culation about whether life might be prospe-
ring there, perhaps associated with undersea
volcanic activity, like the communities that
develop around hydrothermal vents in our own
deep sea. Plans are now underway to send spa-
cecraft to Europa that can deploy a robot
capable of boring through three kilometres of
ice before descending into a sea that may be
f o rty kilometres deep. M e a n w h i l e , E a rt h ’s
ocean remains largely unexplored. We have
barely begun to imagine the energy potential of
harnessing the waves, the healing powers of
marine bacteria or the sustainable possibility of
feeding the world’s hungry through algae. A
veritable treasure trove,the ocean’s greatest gift
may well be the Earth’s history captured in so
The sea  It is time humankind stopped

many forms—from the remains of a shipwreck
to the yearly bands of a coral reef.
But perhaps the most astonishing thing upon
e n t e ring the ocean with a face mask and fli p p e rs
is the discove ry that it is not just a place fil l e d
with rocks and wat e r. It is like a soup, a special
kind of minestrone, where the bits and pieces are
a l i ve! “Living fossils” are eve ry w h e r e . Nearly all
of the thirty-three major divisions of animals
and a dozen broad cat e g o ries of plants and other
organisms that have existed for hundreds of mil-
lions of ye a rs are at least partially represented
t h e r e ; only about half are terr e s t ri a l .
E ve ry living thing on Earth acts on the sur-
rounding env i r o n m e n t , i n i t i ating small but real
c h a n g e s. All are components of the grand machi-
n e ry that makes Earth what it is: a living planet,
our life support system.The immense dive rsity of
life causes change and provides the ingr e d i e n t s
n e c e s s a ry to respond as change occurs.The resi-
lience of natural systems is remarkable, e v i d e n c e d
by the ability to rebound after storm s , fir e s , c o l l i-
sions with comets or natural climatic sw i n g s , a l l
the while retaining a basic framework within
which living things prosper—though not necessa-
rily the same living things.
Human rapacity
Knowing that our lives depend on keeping
Earth more or less as it is in terms of life sup-
port functions, it makes a lot of sense to figure
out whether the swift changes we are presently
witnessing—and causing—may set in motion
e vents with undesirable consequences.
Certainly, no species in the history of the pla-
net has been as rapacious and effective in
consuming and displacing other species and
entire ecosystems as our own. Our impact,
some say, can be likened to that of a slow-
motion comet striking earth, the repercussions
gradually becoming manifest, ri valling and
compounding the impact of storms, volcanoes,

Facts and fig u re s
● 70.8% of the earth’s surface is ocean,or 361.3 million km2 out of a total surface
of 510 million km2. By volume, 97.957% of the water on the planet is oceanic water
and associated sea ice.
● 60% (3.6 billion) of the world’s  population lives within 60 kilometres of the
coast. These figures will rise to 75% (6.4 billion) within three decades.
● 80% of all ocean resources are concentrated on the continental shelf.
● An estimated 80% of the world’s biodiversity lives in the ocean, much of it undis-
c o v e r e d .The largely unexplored deep sea may be home to 10 million species we know
nothing about.
● The latest available figures (for 1992) put global offshore reserves of oil at 36.5
billion tonnes and of gas at 21.4 trillion tonnes.
● An estimated 12.5 million fishermen (10 million of them artisans), operating from
some three million vessels, land around 90 million tonnes of fish per year.The fishing
industry provides a livelihood,directly or indirectly, for about 200 million people.
● The average depth of the world’s oceans is 3,800 metres.The deepest point, in the
Marianas Trench in the Pacific Ocean,is 11,000 metres beneath the surface.
● The largest ocean, the Pa c i fic , measures over 166 million km2.The highest submarine
mountain,near the Tonga Trench between Samoa and New Zealand,is 8,700 metres
high.
● Average global sea level has probably risen about 18 cm over the past century and
is currently rising at 0.1-0.3 cm per year.
The sea’s mean surface temperature is 160 Centigrade. ■

At night, our cities glow with an otherwo r l d-
ly light, c r e ated by consuming millions of ye a rs
of fossil we a l t h . C o m p l e x , n aturally productive
ecosystems are disappeari n g, to be replaced by
g e o m e t rical plots bearing vulnerable single-spe-
cies crops. Other changes are less obvious—the
r e m oval of millions of tonnes of living creat u r e s
from the ocean in the past century, and the
addition of billions of tonnes of trash—excess
f e rt i l i z e rs , pesticides and other noxious sub-
s t a n c e s. Might such actions alter the way nat u-
ral systems behave? Should we wo rry about the
consequences of taking unprecedented quanti-
ties of wildlife from the sea?
Energy ‘middlemen’
We have perfected ways of killing the ocean’s
giants and their diminutive cousins—the nine
species of great whales,more than fifty kinds of
“small” whales, dolphins and porpoises, and all
marine turtles. Many are now endangered or
threatened. Bluefin tuna weighing 450 kilos,
huge halibut, cod as large as the fishermen who
catch them, century-old sturgeon, large sword-
fish, marlin, sailfish, sharks and many other
once common giants are suddenly rare.
Acoustic sensors developed to find enemy sub-
marines now locate fish, squid, shrimp and
other creatures for hunters to engulf with enor-
mous nets, some large enough to swallow a
dozen jumbo jets.
R e c e n t l y, the populations of more than 100
m a rine species listed by the World Conservat i o n
Union as threatened or endangered, s h a rp l y
d e c l i n e d . Large populations of ocean wildlife
are dwindling. The three remaining concentra-
tions of wild creatures in the sea are now being
taken to produce protein concentrat e : p e l a gi c
s q u i d , large swa rms of kri l l , and the deep, ve rt i-
cally migr ating midwater communities of small
c r e atures generally known as the “deep scat t e-
ring laye r.”
And yet cru s t a c e a , like certain squid, a r e
linchpins in complex ecosystems. In effect, t h e y
are the energy “ m i d d l e m e n ,” c o n c e n t r ating and
c o nve rting plant energy into something palat a b l e
and usable by hordes of other creat u r e s. A n
example of the importance of a single cru s t a c e a n
species is the Antarctic kri l l , Euphausia superba, a
translucent pinkish-red finger-long creat u r e
equipped with enormous black eyes and the
wonderful ability to emit an eerie blue-green ve r-
sion of bioluminescence. The billions of its kind
make up an essential part of the living web that
p r o s p e rs in the Southern Ocean ecosystem. K ri l l
swa rms are consumed by penguins, t e rn s , g u l l s ,
s e a l s , sea lions, s q u i d , fis h , and several species of
whales whose existence depends on enorm o u s
quantities of them.
So vital is this one species to the entire
Antarctic realm that it would make sense to
ensure that nothing disturbs its continued
prosperity. Instead, several nations annually

before shipping them off for conversion into
high-protein food for poultry, cattle and direct
human consumption.
Besides predat i o n , m a ny other fa c t o rs
undermine the abundance and diversity of
marine life. It is obvious that shoreline deve-
lopment, construction of marinas, seawalls and
j e t t i e s , cutting mangr oves and filling in
marshes, coupled with the impact of rivers bea-
ring heavy loads of excess fertilizers, biocides,
and sediment, have taken a toll.
H ow can we be sure of the impact on ocean
wildlife? Despite the swift and unprecedented
insights into the nature of the sea yielded by tech-
n o l o g y, most of the ocean remains unknown and
u n e x p l o r e d , e ven within the depths that dive rs
can conveniently travel—from the surface to fif t y
metres dow n .The maximum ocean depth, e l e ve n
k i l o m e t r e s , has been attained only once, in 1960,
when two men peered for half an hour through
the small porthole of the bat hyscaphe Tri e s t e.
Recent additional glimpses have been supplied
by cameras lowered on the tethered Ja p a n e s e
r o b o t , K a i k o, but these gr e at depths—like 95 per
cent of the rest of the sea—have yet to be really
seen by humankind.
An uncertain future
It is easy to disregard places we cannot see, n o t
wo rry or care about creatures we have never met.
As troubling as the problems are relating to
obvious habitat destruction and predat i o n , t h e
gr e atest cause for concern must certainly be
i g n o r a n c e . Some shrug and say, “ W h at ’s the pro-
blem? Humankind appears to be doing pretty
we l l . Look at the numbers.” After all, it took all of
the time from the dawn of civilization to the ye a r
1800 before our population barely reached a bil-
l i o n . Less than a century and a half later that
number had doubled, and now, at nearly six bil-
l i o n , world population continues to climb. A n d
yet our own future may be in jeopardy.
There are no easy answe rs to the question of
w h at must be done, but there is hope that a signi-
ficant “ h e d g e ” against the unknowns is coming
into focus with the establishment of a gr ow i n g
number of marine sanctuaries in coastal areas—
places comparable to national parks, w i l d e rn e s s
areas and nature reserves on the land. More than
1,200 marine protected areas have been designa-
ted by va rious nat i o n s. While “ p r o t e c t i o n ” is fa r
from complete (commercial and sport - fis h i n g
continue in most) and the total area is still small
(a fraction of one per cent of the ocean as a
w h o l e ) , the actions taken thus far may reflect the
b e ginning of a new trend that will lead to fin d i n g
h a rm o ny—or at least an enduring place—within
A marine g l o s s a r y
Abyssal plain: a flat, gently sloping or nearly level region at the bottom zone of the
oceans at depths between 4,000 and 6,000 metres.
Continental shelf: the shallow underwater extension of a continent up to a depth at
which there is a marked increase of slope towards oceanic depths.
Continental slope: the steeply descending bottom between the edge of the continental
shelf  and the abyssal plain.
Coral reef: a massive limestone structure built up through the constructional cementing
and depositional activities of anthozoans of the order Madreporaria and certain other
invertebrate and algal species.
Demersal: living close to the bottom of the sea.
Eutrophication: enrichment of natural waters with inorganic nutrients (ammonia, nitra-
te, phosphate) by which phytoplankton growth is stimulated. Eutrophication leads to
increased biomass, decomposition in the worst cases resulting in oxygen depletion and
mass mortality.
Exclusive economic zone (EEZ): legal concept introduced by the 1982 United Nations
Convention on the Law of the Sea extending a country’s rights over the exploitation of
certain natural resources to 200 nautical miles out from the coast.
Hydrologic cycle: the cycle of water in the hydrosphere during which the water in the
ocean evaporates, precipitates, and returns back to the ocean through any of a variety of
routes.
Intermediate waters: water masses formed in high latitudes that flow beneath the sur-
face waters but above the deep waters.
Mineral nodules: hard,nodular deposits of typically a few centimetres in diameter found
in  places on the ocean bottom and enriched in heavy metals such as manganese, iron,
nickel,cobalt and copper.
Mangrove forest: a variety of tropical inshore communities dominated by several spe-
cies of shrubs or trees that have the ability to grow in salt water.
Niño, El: an episodic increased warming of the equatorial Pacific Ocean due to atmos-
pheric changes causing large-scale changes in oceanographic and atmospheric conditions
and leading to droughts, floods, storms, hurricanes, cold and snow. Peruvian fisherman
call it El Niño—“The Infant Jesus”—because it arrives around Christmas.
Oceanic crust: the type of crust underlying the oceans that is typically 8 km thick  and
somewhat richer in iron and magnesium than the continental crust.
Pelagic: of or pertaining to the waters of the oceans, as opposed to benthic. For
example, pelagic organisms inhabit the waters, whereas benthic organisms live on or in
the ocean bottom.
Plankton: organisms free-floating or drifting in the open water of the oceans with their
lateral and vertical movements determined by water motion.
Seamount: a large, isolated and underwater elevation characteristically conical in form.
Thermohaline circ u l a t i o n : circulation in the ocean that is driven by the density of diffe-
rences caused by temperature and salinity. Thermohaline circulation predominates over
wind-driven circulation in most estuaries and deeper parts of the ocean.
Trench: a long, narrow, characteristically very deep and asymmetrical depression of the
sea floor, with relatively steep sides.
Tsunami: large waves, sometimes up to 30 metres high,which are created by the shock
from an underwater volcanic eruption,earthquake, or landslide. ■
the natural systems that sustain us.
The ultimate question is,“what does all this
mean to us, to our future?” Can we use our
awesome power to use—not use up—the natu-
ral systems that support us? Can we overcome
the greatest threat to the oceans and thus to
our future—ignorance? There are many unk-
nowns, but this much is certain: we have the
power to undermine the healthy functioning of
the sea that supports all life on Earth—but no
sure way to heal the harm. For ages, the sea has
taken care of us. The time has come for us to
take care of the sea. ■

On cours e
for co-opera t i o n
Set up by UNESCO in 1960, the Inter-
governmental Oceanographic Commission (IOC)
is the only United Nations body with responsibility for
basic oceanographic research. Its mission is to coordi-
nate international research programmes aimed at
improving ocean management and to advise its 125
Member States. The Global Ocean Observing System
(GOOS) and the Tsunami Warning System in the Pacific
are two notable IOC endeavours. GOOS, set up after
the 1992 Earth Summit in Rio de Janeiro, is the super-
watchdog of the seas. Using information collected by
thousands of coastal satellite stations, planes, drifting
buoys and ocean research vessels, it seeks to unders-
tand and predict trends in the marine environment.
The purpose of the Tsunami Warning System in the
Pacific is to avoid tragedy by forecasting tsunamis,
giant seismic sea waves which took 2,000 lives and
wreaked a billion dollars in damage between 1992
and 1996.

‘All I know is that I know nothing”. A s
they take stock of current know l e d g e
of our “small blue planet”, m a ny
m o d e rn oceanogr a p h e rs could well echo this
humble admission at t ri buted to Socrat e s.
Although we are starting to become aware of the
o c e a n s ’ e x t r a o r d i n a ry influence on the eart h ’s
ecosystem,research is still in its early stages and
so much remains to be discovered that it will take
time to fully unlock the mysteries of the sea.
Two decades ago the ocean was thought of
as a cornucopia of mineral wealth. But while
considerable efforts are still being deployed to
explore these riches in order to offset the inevi-
table depletion of terrestrial mineral resources,
many disappointments have combined with the
high cost of tapping these marine resources to
dampen the high hopes that once prevailed.
H owe ve r , the threats looming over the clima-
te have spurred scientists to study the oceans’
role as a climatic regulat o r. Since the early
1 9 9 0 s , research has focused on the still poorly
u n d e rstood field of oceanic circulat i o n ,e s p e c i a l-
ly in the ocean depths, and the ways in which the
va rious levels of the oceans intercommunicat e .
The havoc wreaked by El Niño has something to
do with these concern s , but the broader aim is to
extend the current horizon of climate prediction
to some thirty ye a rs , which might help to pre-
vent certain widely predicted cat a s t r o p h e s.
Scientists say that oceanic circulation is
i m p o rtant on several counts, not least of which is
to help us understand how fish—and pollution—
t r ave l . Awareness of future threats has also gi ve n
fresh impetus to the study of coastal ecosystems.
R e s e a r c h e rs are trying to find out more about
h ow they function, and to develop resource
extraction and management methods which are
less destru c t i ve to these resource-rich areas.
G e o l o gical research over the past 30 ye a rs has
r e volutionized our understanding of continental
d rift and plate tectonics and opened up a whole
new realm of study with the discove ry of new bio-
l o gical and biochemical systems along the planet’s
a c t i ve faults (see page 29). The scope of mari n e
research is enorm o u s , r a n ging from the impact of
iron on biochemical reactions in the marine env i-
ronment to ways of influencing the oceans’ c a p a-
city to absorb CO
2
, and is set to expand.
But oceanographic research is ve ry expensi-
ve , and only the richest countries can afford it.
The United Stat e s , Ja p a n , F r a n c e , the United
K i n g d o m , G e rm a ny, Canada and Russia lead
the fie l d , although a number of major southern
n at i o n s , such as India, China and Brazil, are on
the verge of joining them. To take one example,
F r a n c e ’s Research Institute for the Exploitat i o n
of the Sea (Ifremer) employs 1,200 people on
some thirty sites and has a $160-million annual
bu d g e t . Research in general is mainly funded by
g ove rn m e n t s , especially since the military
a u t h o rities are interested in using the ocean
depths as a testing ground for naval wa r fa r e .T h e
p ri vate sector usually focuses on areas of econo-
mic interest, such as geology in the case of oil
companies and research on fish stocks in the
case of the fishing industry. But the small coun-
t ries are still not playe rs , e ven if they have a sea-
board of their ow n . ■

the lives of eve ryone on Eart h .Arguably the most
i m p o rtant influence of the oceans is the role that
they share with the at m o s p h e r e , biosphere and
cryosphere in determining the Earth’s climate.
Scientific exploration of the oceans started
only 125 years ago with the global circumnavi-
gation by the British admiralty vessel HMS
Challenger. That and subsequent expeditions
mapped the oceans’ depths and water proper-
ties (temperature and salinity) so that by the
mid-twentieth century we had developed a
g e n e r a l , if imperfect, u n d e rstanding of the
ocean’s physical processes.
Today, scientists are in the middle of a
major project—historically even more impor-
tant than the work of the Challenger. It is called
the World Ocean Circulation Experi m e n t
(WOCE) and is part of the the World Climate
Research Programme. The project is charting
the complex ocean currents using modern
research vessels, buoys and robot instruments
to collect very precise measurements. Satellites
are observing sea surface temperature, winds,
waves, tides and the changes in the sea surface
slopes caused by currents. By using some of the
world’s largest computers to analyse this data,
we are beginning to reveal the ocean as clima-
te’s hidden engine.We are about to enter a new
age of ocean exploration.
To understand in the simplest terms the key
role of the ocean, think of it as an enormous
reservoir for the sun’s heat.The oceans have an
extraordinary capacity to store and move heat.
In fact, the heat needed to warm the top three
metres of the ocean by one degree Celsius
would warm the entire atmosphere by the same
amount. This enables the ocean to save the
excess heat of summer and then slowly release
it during the next winter. We clearly see the
effect this has by comparing the temperature
differences between winter and summer on an
island and in the middle of a continent at the
same latitude. For example, the Azores and
Kansas City are both close to 400 N and yet the
temperature ranges are 70 and 290 C respecti-
vely.
This storage capacity is just one part of the
climate equation. Ocean currents also carry
heat around the world.The Gulf Stream and its
branches, for example, bring heat from Florida
towards Ireland and onwards to the Arctic, lea-
ving northwestern Europe about 100 C warmer
than Labrador, which sits at the same latitude.
In simple terms, the ocean’s surface current
system carries heat from the equator towards
the poles, the water returning in cold deep cur-
rents. Scientists on the Challenger saw evidence
of this when they measured surface equatorial
water of almost 300 C, while at the bottom tem-
peratures were near 00 C.
The heat transport is enormous too—the
North Atlantic, for example, is carrying heat
polewards at the rate of 1,000 million mega-
watts (equivalent to fifty times the global popu-
lation’s energy consumption). This system of

warm and cold currents is referred to as the
thermohaline circulation. The Atlantic branch
is in some ways the key to the global system. A
r o u n d - t rip on the thermohaline “ c o nve yo r
belt” can take a thousand years.
The thermohaline circulation is dri ve n
partly by the winds and the earth’s rotation and
partly by the conversion of surface water to
cold, deep dense water at high latitudes. Its
name, thermo (heat), haline (salt), gives a clue
as to how it works.The salt prevents water free-
zing when heat is lost to the atmosphere in the
polar winters, and so dense water (below 00 C)
sinks to the seabed in small, intense “chim-
neys” and feeds deep, narrow currents threa-
ding their way equatorward along the ocean
floor. This water slowly mixes with warmer
water above it and thus completes the
“conveyor belt”.
By mapping these circulation routes, scien-
tists are on the threshold of understanding the
oceans’ role in climate and its variability. The
present El Niño event is a wonderful example
of why this is important. When an El Niño
occurs, warm water usually held in the western
e q u at o rial Pa c i fic by the prevailing winds
migrates eastwards towards South America.
This causes weather changes both locally and
around the world. Thanks to an observational
n e t work of Pacific bu oys and computer
models, we were able to predict in early 1997
that an El Niño was starting. However, we
could not precisely forecast the severity of the
impacts on weather patterns around the globe.
We still cannot be sure which of the many ano-
malous events in 1997 were attributable to El
Niño, but past experience suggests that many
were.
As we learn more about climate we start to
see other patterns emerging. The difference
between atmospheric pressures measured in
the Azores and in Iceland is a measure of the
strength of westerly winds over the Atlantic.
This North Atlantic Oscillation (NAO) index
can be linked to colder and warmer winters in
Europe as the winds bring heat from the ocean
to the land.This helps to explain the unusually
mild European winters of the early 1990s. In
contrast, the bitter cold and snow of the 1940s
which led to Hitler’s botched assault on
Moscow were linked to extremely low NAOs.
Clearly, the ocean holds a key to more pre-
cise and longer-range we ather predictions.
With advanced warning, farmers could plant
drought-resistant crops if need be. An early
forecast of unusually high temperatures or wet
conditions might enable doctors to prevent the
onslaught of tropical diseases.
Predicting climate is a harder problem.The
uncertainty surrounding global warming and
the impact of greenhouse gas emissions has
given a new impetus to ocean research.WOCE
has involved scientists from thirty countries
making observations over the past eight years.
That experiment’s findings and our knowledge
of El Niño will be built on by a new project on
Climate Variability and Predictability (CLI-
VAR) to model all aspects of the climate from
the seasonal/interannual monsoons to long
term (decades to centuries) climate variability
and the possible influences that humanity may
have.
We have much to learn about the effects of
global wa rming on the seas. The list of
concerns is endless. Rising sea temperatures
affect everything from sea level rise to availabi-
lity of fish stocks. Some computer models sug-
gest it could also trigger a breakdown of the
Atlantic component of the “ t h e rm o h a l i n e
conveyor belt”, which might create at least a
temporary end to Europe’s relatively mild cli-
mate.
Finally, global warming might also affect
the ocean’s capacity to absorb carbon dioxide
(one of the most problematic gr e e n h o u s e
gases).The seas currently draw about two bil-
lion tonnes of CO
2
out of the atmosphere each
year. (To put this in context, human activities
release about seven billion tonnes each year).
However, rising temperatures limit the sea-
water’s physical capacity to absorb CO
2
. Can
we afford to take even more risks and neglect
the oceans? ■

D i s c ove ry of seafloor hy d r o t h e rmal vents and

of biodive rs i t y, with some estimates of the total

tropical rain forests. V i rtually nothing is know n

S n o r kel in sunny, warm tropical waters over the vibrant rainbows of coral heads and reef fis h e s
and your head goes dizzy with the magic of diversity. Over 90,000 species living in coral
reefs have been described,and the total number is at least one million.Why is the figure so
high? The microtopography of a growing reef is complex, creating abundant surfaces for
attachment and hiding places to accommodate small invertebrates and habitats for fis h .
Reefs are typically insular oceanic habitats. One can envision an always expanding species
pool as a reef is successfully invaded by the chance arrival of drifting larvae of a species
from some remote location.The inva d e r, isolated from its parent population,gradually adjusts
to its new environment and develops into a daughter species.Where there was once one spe-
cies, now there are two. Each one has some likelihood of invading other reefs and in such a
way diversity of coral reefs blossoms exponentially over geologic time.
This diversity is now threatened by the flash of dynamite of the myopic fisherman who
destroys the habitat that sustains the resource he seeks to gather. Coral reefs are victims of
many other unsound practices, with the result that as much as 10 per cent of them have
already been degraded beyond recovery. If unchecke d , loss of coral reef habitat will pro-
gress at a rate of 10 per cent per decade. Global warming is a particularly insidious danger.
Corals lose their algal symbionts when the seawater temperature rises just a degree or two
above normal,a phenomenon known as bleaching, which often results in death of the coral.
Disease hits harder when corals are stressed by warmer than usual temperatures. A sick
coral reef is dizzying only in the staggering loss of biodiversity. C. L.V. D. ■

it is loss of dive rsity that generates concern .
Because some marine habitats may nat u r a l l y

ce of animals, loss of a single species can gr e at l y
modify the ecology of a system. A case in point
is Chesapeake Bay, the largest tidal estuary on
the east coast of the United Stat e s. Oyster reefs
once dominated the Chesapeake’s shallow
wat e rs.These animals feed by fil t e ring seawat e r ,
and not so long ago the equivalent of the entire
volume of water in the Bay was filtered within a
we e k . Oyster populations have declined due to
e x p l o i t ation and disease and what took one we e k
to filter now takes one ye a r. The effect cascades
through the water column as the part i c u l ate load
i n c r e a s e s , light penetration decreases, and a host
of other consequences transpire.
In terr e s t rial ecosystems, loss of chari s m at i c
mammals or the last remnants of virgin forest
results in a dramatic visual sensation as well as a

the planetary legacy we leave to our children is

Seaweed–or algae–is everywhere in our food

Korean soups, paper-thin sheets of it are
wrapped around Japanese rice balls, and it lies
hidden in the algi n ates and carrageenans in ham-

weed-based food additives are now so commonly
used in prepared and fast food that virtually eve-

processed seaweed eve ry day,”s ays Michael Guiry
of the National Unive rsity of Ireland, w h e r e
m a rine algae are also used as a fertilizer and food
supplement for live s t o c k . In other parts of the
wo r l d , especially the Far East and the Pa c i fic,
seaweed is a traditional part of the staple diet.
There are three categories of seaweed: red
(4,500 species), green (900 species), a n d
brown (1,000 species). Red seaweeds are the
most numerous, green the most widespread
and brown the largest. Some species of kelp off
the Californian coast can grow to  be 50 metres
long, in “forests” that are just as vast and com-
plex as those on land. Every year 140,000
tonnes of kelp are harvested for the extraction
of food additives. Most of the edible green and

rich in vitamins, mineral salts and oligo-ele-
ments that they deserve to be called “the vege-
tables of the sea”. Wakame, for example, has a
very high calcium content,and nori contains 50
per cent more vitamin C than oranges.
In some parts of Asia, seaweed provides the
poor with good, cheap nutrition, and in the
rich countries it helps people lose weight. “It
seems that We s t e rn e rs , unlike A s i a n s , a r e
unable to assimilate seaweed,and that’s why we
consider it to be a low calorie food,” says Guiry.
The total seaweed market is worth over $5 bil-
lion, with food additives alone accounting for
$600 million. Kazutosi Nisizawa , f o rm e r
President of the Japanese Phycological Society,
says “the world’s total yearly harvest is 8.4 mil-
lion tonnes of green seawe e d , 2.8 million
tonnes of brown seaweed and 1.2 million
tonnes of red seaweed.” China is the leader,
producing 3.5 million tonnes of kombu yearly—
the world’s biggest harvest. This is even more
impressive when we know that from the fifth
century on China imported dried seaweed
from Japan, until it began to farm its own in the
1950s, growing the plants on long ropes stret-
ched under the water. The Chinese now hold
the title of the world’s biggest seaweed consu-
mers.
Meanwhile, the Japanese harvest of nori is
the world’s biggest in value, worth a total of
almost $1.3 billion. The Japanese seawe e d
industry employs some 35,000 people. Japan is
also the world’s leading seaweed exporter, rin-
ging up sales of $170 million in 1995, accor-
ding to FAO. Seaweed, of course, is a historic
staple of the Japanese diet. “The Japanese cur-
rently eat some twenty different species, and
they have been using six of them since as far
back as the eighth century,” reports Guiry.
“Seaweed accounts for about 10 per cent of the
modern Japanese diet.” Even the Japanese gods
love seaweed, it seems. “In a book dating back
to 701,” recounts Nisizawa, “it is written that
several varieties of edible seaweed were used as
offerings in the temples.” Even today, there are
towns in Japan where the meal served at the
betrothal ceremony must include Laminaria,
which is believed to bring good luck and hap-
piness. In many countries, seaweed has long
been part of the traditional pharmacopeia, and
scientists today hope to see it as an ingredient
of tomorrow’s medicines. Researchers are cur-
rently trying to isolate substances in seaweed
which could be used to treat high blood pres-
sure, cholesterol, cancerous tumours and other
ailments. ■

They walk on the wa t e r,beating the waves with a “ c o r v o ” , a 10-metre-long pole.They scrape
the rocks with iron knives, then stop to pick up brownish,slippery, floppy things which they
pile in heaps,before returning to the wa t e r, scraping and bending again.For several generations,
the seaweed gatherers have been lords and masters of a place which belongs to no one.Th e y
are regarded as demi-gods, and it is said that when they ride their horses down the streets,
or walk with their arms laden with rolls of dry seaweed,it means that bad weather is on the
way.
On these windswept shores, they gather seaweed in the traditional way, from spring to
autumn, just as the Mapuche Indians did 200 years ago. Near Temuco and Chiloé,in the cen-
tral regions of Chile and in the very heart of Araucana,they gather “cochayuyo”and “luche”
(Durvillaea antarctica and Porphyra),with which they make bread and cakes, or cook with mut-
ton. Further south, near Puerto Montt, they have for over twenty years been gathering “luga
roja carrajinado”, “luga cuchara” (Mazzaela or Iridaea) and “pelillo” (Gracilaria),using diving
suits and breathing tubes which enable them to work underwater for long periods without
oxygen tanks.
When the work is done, the beaches are spread with red and brown seaweed which is
flattened out and left to dry in the sun.The gatherers and their families later carry it away in
rolls or bundles weighing between 40
and 60 kilos, which they sell for a pit-
tance to merchants and dealers. Th e
following day, the gatherer will be back
on his rock jutting out of the wa t e r,
“corvo”in hand to prod the waves.
H o w e v e r, this traditional way of
gathering seaweed is tending to disap-
p e a r, just as seaweed’s economic
importance is growing. It is not only used unprocessed as food but also to make algina, a g a r-
agar and carrageenan,substances which are used in the food,pharmaceutical and cosme-
tics industries, and to solidify cultivation media in bacteriology. The seaweed gatherers are
gradually becoming professional farmers.
Seaweed gathering began in Chile in the 1950s, and during the present decade is yiel-
ding 160,000 tonnes of biomass per year,almost 5 per cent of total world production.The indus-
try employs some 12,000 families.
In 1983 over-farming depleted the natural underwater “ m e a d o w s ”of pelillo, the raw mate-
rial for the production of agar,as a result of which scientists, entrepreneurs and seaweed gathe-
ring co-operatives got together to replant the shoreline. Of the 1,200 meadows currently under
concession,342 are active farming centres, operated along the northern shore by big com-
panies and in the South by co-operatives of traditional gatherers.Eighty-two per cent of the
current pelillo crop is transformed by Chilean factories into agar for export to the United
S t a t e s, Ja p a n , Singapore and Th a i l a n d .The remaining 18 per cent of the seaweed is dried and
exported,mainly to Japan.Total earnings from Chile’s seaweed exports are about $50 mil-
lion.
Pelillo farming has helped to stabilize production and reduce pressure on natural mea-
d o w s ; at the same time, it ensures a constant supply of raw material to the Chilean agar indus-
t r y. C u r r e n t l y, 75 per cent of Chile’s total seaweed crop is being transformed into a high
added value product.The same results are expected in the short term for the red seaweed used
to produce carrageenan.

The world’s oceans could provide a limitless
source of energy, according to Indian che-
mist Madanjeet Singh, an intern at i o n a l
a u t h o rity on the subject. But exploiting ocean
energy is no simple mat t e r , if only because the
possibilities of doing so differ from region to
region.Experiments have been carried out with
tidal and wave power and with ocean therm a l
e n e r g y. Few applications of these technologi e s
are currently in use, but their number could
increase in the coming centuries—if they attract
investment on a massive scale.
Ocean tides constitute a clean and inex-
haustible energy source, free from the climatic
irregularities which are a constraint on wind
and solar power. But places suitable for exploi-
ting them are few and far between, for if a tidal
power plant is to operate efficiently certain
conditions must be met. A river estuary where
the difference between high and low tide is at
least five metres is necessary. It must be pos-
sible to construct a dam, and there must be a
nearby source of electricity supply to make up
for the intermittence of power production lin-
ked to the times of high and low tides.
One of the world’s most suitable sites is the

estuary of the river Rance, in western France,
where the difference between high and low
tides averages 8.17 metres, peaking at 13.5
metres during the equinoxes. The world’s first
tidal power plant began operating there in
1966. It is still the biggest, with a capacity of
240 megawatts (MW).
Tidal power plants consist of a high-capaci-
ty dam built across an estuary to hold back the
water at high tide.At low tide sluice gates in the
dam are opened to release a cascade of water
that drives a turbine to generate electricity.
In China, says Singh, “eight plants with a
total capacity of 6,210 kilowatts exploit tidal
energy.”There is a 20MW plant at Annapolis in
Canada. But although many other suitable sites
exist, construction costs are considered too
high, especially as hydroelectric power is plen-
tiful and cheaper. Tidal power plants are plan-
ned on Russia’s White Sea and on the Severn
and Mersey estuaries in the United Kingdom.
Putting the waves to work
In 1945, Japan became the first country to
consider using sea waves as an energy source,
followed by Norway and the UK. The first
power plant to use wave power, OSPREY
(Ocean Swell Powered Renewable Energy),
began operating in northern Scotland at the
beginning of August 1995. A 2MW facility,
OSPREY was designed along the following
lines: waves entering a kind of submerged
chamber open at the base pushed air into tur-
bines to generate electricity sent via an under-
water cable to the shore about 300 metres
away. Unfortunately, the plant was damaged by
the waves and then destroyed by a storm.The
engineers who designed it did not give up,
however, and a cheaper and more efficient ver-
sion is being developed to supply small islands
with much-needed electricity and to power a
seawater desalinization plant.
Quite different technology is needed to turn
the sea’s thermal energy into electricity. The
sea’s surface temperature in the tropics ranges
from 27 to 31°C all the year round and that of
deep water ranges from 6°C at a depth of 1,000
metres to almost 0°C at 4,000 metres. This
temperature difference can be used to power a
motor based on the same principle as that of
the heat pump. A liquid is turned into gas in an
evaporator, and then drives a turbine which
generates electricity, before passing through a
condenser, where it is turned back into liquid.
The snag is that the process requires huge
turbines. The first practical application of this
method was by the French engineer Georges
Claude, who in 1930 loaded pipes and turbines
onto a ship off the coast of Cuba. American
engineers are working on the idea of siting floa-
ting power plants off the southern coast of the
U.S. and one facility has been operating in
Hawaii since 1981. Such plants could supply
floating cities of the future with electricity, air-
conditioning and fresh water, while the unpol-
luted,nutrient-rich cold water brought up from
the depths could be used to breed fish and
shellfish and grow edible seaweed.
But according to Scottish engineer S. H.
Salter, the most promising device is a “tapering
c h a n n e l ” , i nvented by a Norwe gi a n , E ve n
Mehlum.As Singh describes it,“The waves are
funnelled into a tapered natural or artificial
channel. The water level rises and the water
e ventually spills into an elevated reservo i r
behind the narrow end of the channel. The
water then flows back to the sea through a tur-
bine, generating electricity in the process.”This
reliable, low-cost system is already operating in
Norway and Java.
Salter believes that if we use our imagina-
tion we will find an endless variety of ways of
harnessing the sea’s energy. One of them would
be to use the difference between sea levels. In
Egypt, water running through an underground
canal linking the Mediterranean to the El-
Qattara depression could be used to generate
electricity. In Israel, the same principle could
be used in a canal between the Mediterranean
and the Dead Sea which would gradually des-
cend 400 metres, although the estimated bil-
lion-dollar price tag is a deterrent.
Mr. Singh concludes that “clean energy
from the sea will be especially popular when
the price of oil is no longer governed by econo-
mics but by environmental costs. Cutting car-
bon dioxide emissions will help save the pla-
net.” ■

Raw minerals are found in deposits which have accumula-
ted and concentrated over tens or hundreds of million of
years. Mineral extraction on land has not always been suf-
ficient to satisfy world demand, and so researchers and
industrialists have turned to the sea and the seabed,a rich
and promising but still little-known world.
Minerals under the sea come in several forms:
● Loose deposits come from three sources. Some are
detrital,like sand or gravel, or consist of “placer”deposits
containing tin, titanium, gold, rare earths, zirconium and
diamonds. Others are of biological origin,such as shells of
marine creatures which have turned into sand. A third
category originates from elements suspended in water,
yielding chemical deposits which produce, for example,
barytes or metal-rich sediments.
● Rock deposits, which are the undersea extension of
seams of coal, t i n , iron and other minerals.
● Deposits dissolved in sea wa t e r, such as sodium chlori-
d e, magnesium and iodine.
Offshore mineral extraction has grown to the point
that it now involves, or soon will,almost two-thirds of the
103 chemical elements identified in 1869 by the Russian
chemist Mendeleyev. Mineral sands, also known as beach
sand, come from the bedrock of continents worn away by
the weather and the passage of the seasons, especially in
tropical latitudes. The minerals are freed and carried away
by rivers, first to beaches and then to the seabed of the
continental shelf.
Extracting these minerals is important because they
have become indispensable to modern technology, w h i c h
depends heavily on titanium, zirconium and rare earths
(which include nine heavy minerals—radioactive thorium,
and eight lighter ones). Ti t a n i u m , considered a strategic
m e t a l , provides a white colouring for paper and plastic, a n d
plays an important role in the aeronautical industry and in
manufacturing golf clubs and tennis racke t s. Z i r c o n i u m ’s
refractory qualities make it useful in the thrust nozzles of jet
a i r c r a f t . Rare earths, which contain quartz or rutile (titanium
d i o x i d e ) , supply state-of-the-art technologies such as the
red colour in television pictures or the catalysis of engine
exhaust gases. Rutile has an amazing resistance. It does not
wear out and cannot be corroded by other chemicals. B u t
deposits of it are scarce and unevenly distributed. The big-
gest are in A u s t r a l i a , M a d a g a s c a r, C a m e r o o n , Ghana and
Sierra Leone.
Beach sand is mined using huge, s u p e r- p o w e r f u l
dredges which can scoop up as much as 2,500 tonnes an
h o u r. Between 90 and 98 per cent of the dredged material
is waste which, after the minerals have been separated out
by gravity, is put back where it came from. The most
conscientious mining companies try to leave the landscape
as they found it.They set aside topsoil, and later replace, f e r-
tilize and replant it.

36 THE UNESCO COURIER
■ What is palaeoecology?
Palaeoecology looks to the past—using the
remains of plants and animals—to reconstruct
ecosystem behaviour and see how these sys-
tems respond to climate change. This work is
done by a wide range of specialists, each with
his or her own particular interest, or fetish you
might say. Some study tree-rings, ice cores
from polar and mountain glaciers, even the his-
tory of forest fires.
The ocean is a particularly rich source of
information. Scientists look to yearly bands of
coral growth, for example, to reconstruct histo-
ries of El Niño over the past several centuries.
My fetish is fish scales deposited in ocean sedi-
ments.
■ What can the ocean tell us that a glacier
cannot?
Ice-cores are wonderful sources of climate
history but they cannot tell us how an ecosys-
tem responds to those conditions. Ocean sedi-
ments provide imperfect pictures that have to
be reassembled, like jig-saw puzzles. They help
us begin to disentangle and understand the
interaction between natural variability in the
ecosystem and human intervention.The trick is
learning to read the language of these natural
archives.
I work with a team (through Scri p p s
Institute in the U.S. and Mexico’s Centro de
Investigación Científica y Educación Superior
de Enseñada) to recover and analyse sediments
from a few rare sites. In one of the best sites—
the Santa Barbara Basin off the southern
California coast of the United States—three
metres of mud give us almost 2,000 years of
history. We first X-ray the mud to reveal the
annual layers.We can then count the fish scales
to reconstruct changes in population sizes of
fish like sardines and anchovies. Then we work
out the background clues. Tiny one-celled ani-
mals called Foraminifera, for example, capture
the history of the water in their calcium carbo-
nate shells. By analysing their remains, we learn
about the temperature and salinity of the water
at the time the shell was secreted, helping us
trace ocean circulation in the past.
■ But isn’t 2,000 years of history just a drop in
the bucket in terms of natural history?
That’s true if we look back over the whole
panorama of earth history. But the past 2,000
years is a critical period for considering the
effects of fishing or greenhouse gas emissions.
What sets our fish scale history apart is the high
resolution.This is like the number of volumes
in a collection of history books. Our work offers
five-year “chapters” with the option of looking
every two years. In contrast, much of earth his-
tory has a far lower resolution because the
measurements used give averages over hun-
dreds to thousands of years.
The fish scale record has played an impor-
tant role in understanding the decline and col-
lapse of the sardine population off California in
the 1950s.While this was immediately at t ri bu t e d
to ove r fis h i n g, the palaeo-record showed that
the population has gone through many increases
and declines over the past 2,000 ye a rs.This evi-
dence was then used by some to argue that the
m o d e rn decline was a purely natural phenome-
n o n . A closer look at the fish scale record, h owe-
ve r , s h ows that this decline differs from the pre-
fis h e ry declines in two way s. F i rs t , it culminat e d
in a collapse instead of an expected four to five -
fold reduction in population size. S e c o n d l y, t h e
p o p u l ation took at least thirty ye a rs longer to
r e c over than if there had been no ove r fis h i n g .
■ What else have you discovered?
Something completely unexpected—from
the shells of a tiny snail flo ating in the upper 100
metres of the ocean. The shells captured the
water age at the time they were secreted. Wat e r
age is measured by radiocarbon (the isotope car-
bon-14) as the last time the shell was in contact
with the at m o s p h e r e . We expected some boun-
cing around in these numbers but not the kind
r e p o rted by our collaborat o rs at the Law r e n c e
L i ve rmore National Labs in Californ i a . D u ri n g
the period studied—350 A . D. to 1940—it
a p p e a rs that there was a 50 per cent reduction in
the rate of supply of older radiocarbon from the
deep ocean to the near-surface ocean off
C a l i f o rn i a .This is still a my s t e ry, but ultimat e l y,
The secrets of the planet’s past lie hidden in the ocean depths.
Palaeoecologists like Tim Baumgartner sift through kilos of mud to
uncover the clues.

it must be related to the circulation of deep and
i n t e rm e d i ate wat e rs in combination with other
p r o c e s s e s. N ow remember that the ocean is the
main reservoir of carbon diox i d e , so va ri ations of
this magnitude are essential to unders t a n d .
E ve n t u a l l y, we also must compare these dat a
with data from other sites and go back another
5,000 to 8,000 ye a rs.
■ What is stopping you?
First, sites with such high rates of sedimen-
tation are very rare. They must also be deep
enough to avoid stirring by waves and currents.
And the bottom water must be very poor in
dissolved oxygen so that we don’t have worms
burrowing into the layers. Between southern
Chile and western Canada we have identified
ten possible sites, with another promising area
off the Namibian coast of Africa. But develo-
ping these sites is not cheap. A research vessel
can easily run to $15,000 per day.We also need
to help scientists in these countries do this
work. So before we can find more sites, we
must find more funding. ■
Interview by Amy Otchet
…to sunke n
t re a s u re s
Many other archaeological discoveries have
not made front-page news, but prov i d e
valuable information about the past.The exca-
vation of a 14th-century-B.C. trading vessel off
the southern coast of Turkey has helped us
understand trade in the Mediterranean area
d u ring the Bronze A g e . L i s b o n ’s Nat i o n a l
Archaeology Museum has listed 850 ships that
have sunk off the Azores since 1522, their holds
often laden with precious stones and metals.
These wrecks shed new light on trade between
Europe, the New World and the West Indies.
The sea usually preserves vestiges of the
past better than the earth, but archaeological
excavation under water is much more difficult
than on land. Chance plays a role in finding
sunken treasures, but it is technology that has
worked wonders. There is a downside to tech-
nology, however. Remote-controlled submer-
sibles and satellites that can scan the ocean
floor are available only to those who can pay—
mostly modern-day pirates.
Many sites coveted by treasure-hunters may
end up suffering the same fate as the wreck of
the Dutch-flagged G e l d e rm a h l s e n t h at we n t
d own in the South China Sea in 1752.
Christie’s, one of the world’s biggest auction
houses, sold the cargo for $16 million in 1986,
reaping a handsome profit for the salvager.The
recovery of the cargo led to the complete des-
t ruction of the coral-encrusted wreck 
and its resting place, wiping out a chapter of
history forever. ■

In May 1998 the 25-tonne, 11-metre-tall colos-
sus of A l e x a n d ria made its first voyage when it
was shipped to Pa ris to be displayed in the
square facing the Petit Pa l a i s. In A n t i q u i t y, t h e
s t atue stood before the A l e x a n d ria lighthouse,
one of the seven wonders of the world.After six
centuries at the bottom of the sea and five years
of excavat i o n s , it took barely five weeks to
assemble the four pieces of granite discovered by
archaeologists.The 2,300-year-old statue of the
Greek pharaoh Ptolemy II has at last been resto-
red to its original splendour.
Many mysteries lie at the bottom of the sea.
The most spectacular of them are shipwrecks.
More than four million people have visited the
16th-century English warship Mary Rose since
she was raised in 1982.The wreck of the Wasa,
the pride of the Swedish navy that sank in
1628, has been Stockholm’s biggest tourist
attraction since 1961. Last but not least there’s
the wreck of the Titanic. In 1985 televised pic-
tures of the sunken luxury liner mesmerized
audiences around the world, 73 years after she
came to rest on the ocean floor.

‘I’ve never sailed this far South.Yachtsmen
seldom come here, i t ’s magi c a l . I t ’s an
honour to stick my nose down here.This is
A d venture with a capital A ” . Canadian ya c h t s-
man Gerry Roufs uttered those words before the
sea swa l l owed him up during a violent storm bet-
ween Australia and Cape Horn early last ye a r.
His death is an awesome reminder of the ve ry
real dangers incurred by these adve n t u r e rs ,w h o s e
t h rilling exploits grip the public’s imagi n at i o n .
Frenchman Christophe A u g u i n , who won the
1996-97 Vendée Globe, the dangerous round-
t h e - world race via the South Pole that took Roufs’
life,is another example of bravery.
Auguin, Roufs and other weather-beaten
heroes like them are too modest to cry victory
over the elements. Florence Arthaud, the first
woman to win a transatlantic race, is one of the
grittiest figures in the world of long-distance
racing. On land she is surrounded by a circle of
friends, but she loves being alone on the ocean.
The yachtswoman’s intense relationship with
the sea led her to give up everything at eigh-
teen, including medical school and a cozy life
with her family in Paris’ chic 16th arrondisse-
ment. Arthaud, who has been nicknamed “the
sweetheart of the Atlantic”, says she was drawn
to sailing because it brings her back to life’s
basics: eating, sleeping and surviving.
Solitude is the recurring theme in the lives of
all these sea-fa r e rs. From England’s
Tr a n s atlantic along the historic route betwe e n
Plymouth and Newport , which made the legen-
d a ry French yachtsman Eric Tabarly fa m o u s , t o
the Vendée Globe, which does not allow compe-
t i t o rs to receive any assistance or stop off at
p o rts of call, long-distance racing is first and
foremost a personal challenge. Isabelle A u t i s s i e r ,
a Frenchwoman from the Pa ris suburbs and one
of five sisters , s ays that sailing “makes me feel
totally self-sufficient. I do just what I wa n t , w h e n
I wa n t . M aybe I’m really trying to prove some-
thing to myself—or to others ” .
Alain Bombard, who vo l u n t a rily cast himself
a d rift in an inflatable dinghy in 1952, s ays one
of the century ’s wildest exploits was Gérard
d ’ A b ov i l l e ’s solo voyage across the Pa c i fic in a
r ow b o at . Like a modern - d ay galley slave , he set
out from Japan in July 1991, reaching the We s t
Coast of the United States in November of the
same ye a r. D ’ A b ov i l l e , the total solo adve n t u r e r ,
f u l filled his wildest dreams and proved to the
world that willpower can move mountains.
A l t h o u g h , in his own wo r d s , he did not spend “ a
single enjoyable moment” on the lonely cros-
s i n g, D ’ A b oville achieved his goal. “I thought
for sure crossing the Pa c i fic was impossible, bu t
mulled the idea over in my mind a long time.
W h at I liked about it was reaching my goal. I
got a huge thrill out of slowly working my way
across the wo r l d ’s biggest ocean, which cove rs
half the globe.”
D r. Jean Y ves Chauve , a long-distance
racing specialist and the official physician for
most of the sport’s major events, says that, in
addition to a love of taking risks and accepting
challenges, these far-roving adventurers seek a
very personal kind of “retreat” from the world.
As he sees it, solo long-distance yachtsmen—
and women—are eager to discover the unk-
nown latitudes of their own minds, most likely
coming home stronger and wiser.
The experience changes some of them fore-
ve r. B e rnard Moitessier, who inspired many
people to start sailing, n e ver went home from the
first round-the-world race, the Golden Globe,
organized by the British in 1969. Although in the
l e a d , after sailing past Cape Horn the gr e at sea-
man decided to set out around the world a
second time instead of heading for England. H e
d i d n ’t drop anchor until reaching Po l y n e s i a .
“ W h at does it mean to go round the wo r l d , s i n c e
the horizon never gets any closer?” he pondered

in La Longue Route, a firs t - h a n d
account of his voya g e .
Many will set out in search of
a world Isabelle Autissier calls
“the other side”, looking for the
unusual beauty that Moitessier
found so stunning in these latitudes. The far
south of the A t l a n t i c, Indian and Pa c i f i c
oceans—the roaring forties, the screaming fif-
ties—is a boundless watery wilderness where
none but a few thrill-seekers would ever dare to
venture. Cam Lewis, who in 1993 became the
first yachtsman to sail around the world in less
than eighty days, wrote in his log book about
not seeing any land, ship, plane or sign of
human life for weeks. He described the sense of
peace that came over him on the open sea and
what it was like listening to the sound track of
The Big Blue in stereo as the boat rode the
crests of the waves in a violent storm, giving
him just enough time to glimpse the vast
expanse of ocean before plunging into a trough
again.
Yet even when they take all the necessary
precautions, those who venture out on to the
open sea  risk their lives. Especially since the
high-tech craft they sail today zoom ahead at
amazing speeds.The corporations that sponsor
them want to see their investments pay off.
Speed is the name of the game. A case in point
was the 1998 Whitbread round-the-world race
that pitted the best international racers against
each other. New Zealander Grant Dalton
wrote in his log book that this way of sailing is
unsafe, but wondered whether he and his fel-
low competitors had any choice. If you don’t
want to finish last, you have to tear ahead at the
risk of being smashed to bits.
Advertisers have been quick to seize upon
the public’s fa s c i n ation with long-distance
yacht racing as a way of reaching promising
new markets.The genuine seaman, Dr. Chauve
says, has the power to make others experience
adventure vicariously. These races do have a
strong impact on the collective imagination. A
million people turned out in the Breton port of
Saint Malo to watch the start of the Rum
Route race in 1994. Several hundred thousand
onlookers welcomed Christophe Auguin on his
return when he reached the French Atlantic
port of Les Sables d’Olonne. On a chilly win-
ter’s day a crowd over 300,000-strong cheered
on Bruno Peyron and his crew as their catama-
ran finished a round-the-world voyage in less
than 80 days. The yachtsman from La Baule
got some idea of the public’s enthusiasm from
the thousands of messages that poured in
during the hair-raising adventure. “I’m thin-
king of you all every day. It helps me forget the
metro and the blues,” said one message from
Pa ri s. A hospital surgeon followed eve ry
moment, writing “hang in there—we’re kee-
ping up with you hour by hour.We admire your
courage and willpower.” A message from the
French Alps read, “you fellows are doing what
other people only dream about.”
In countries other than France, the excite-
ment of experiencing these adventures vica-
riously runs even higher.The United Kingdom
has knighted its gr e atest ya c h t s m e n . N e w
Zealand made eight attempts to win the presti-
gious America’s Cup before succeeding at last
in 1995. It was a great triumph for the three
million New Zealanders, who live in the teeth
of the wind and the sea all year round, and
they’re counting on a repeat performance when
Auckland hosts the America’s Cup in 2000.
But national feelings should not come into play
here.The sea has no borders. It is open to every
dreamer. All it takes is a little humility on the
part of those setting out and imagination on
the part of those who stay ashore. As Bernard
Moitessier wrote about his joy at being before
the mast, “Wind, sea, boat and sails, a world
that is both compact and considerable, without
beginning or end, a part and yet the whole of
the universe, my private universe, all my own.”

We tend to view the marine world as an
i n finite food supply, a bottomless pit for
waste and a “common space”where we
can play and fig h t , as and when we please.H owe-
ver, this is quickly changing as the world meta-
p h o rically “ s h ri n k s ” , as the oceans no longer pre-
sent the obstacle they once were to travel or
c o m m u n i c ations and as we explore their furt h e s t
depths.We have entered a new era of fierce com-
petition for marine resources and space.
Sixteen of the world’s 23 mega-cities (with
over 2.5 million inhabitants) are on or close to
the sea. In China about 100 million people
have moved from land-locked provinces to new
coastal economic zones since 1990. Coastal
t o u ri s m , f i s h e ries and offshore petroleum
industries are major sources of revenue for
many countries, particularly small developing
island states.
Despite air travel, the oceans are still the
great highways for trade, with ships transpor-
ting 80 per cent of international cargo. Indeed,
the oceans largely make economic globalization
possible by offering a cheap means of moving
commodities around the world. Tens of thou-
sands of vessels are at sea at any one time, all
needing a shore to dock, load, unload and dis-
pose of waste. Until recently the oceans were
the obvious solution for waste disposal in gene-
ral.Whole industries have been built up around
dumping domestic sewage, industrial waste,
decommissioned oil rigs and nuclear waste at
sea.
G ove rnments and their military forces,
multinationals and local industry all have a
major stake in the marine world. So it is not
surprising to find increasing conflict between
and among these actors. Some of the most hea-
ted disputes have occurred in the fisheries sec-
tor. As stocks collapse after decades of overfi-
shing, vessels from different nations are chasing
the remaining fish in a cut-throat competition
that has in some cases escalated into violence.
The North Atlantic “cod wa rs ” b e t we e n
Canadian and Spanish trawlers in the early
1990s have probably attracted the most atten-
tion. In a heated dispute ten years earlier, a
Danish vessel deliberately sailed into UK
waters to catch forbidden fish and face arrest
by the Royal Navy.
In the rivalry for marine resources, environmental
concern should not be seen as just another
competing use of the oceans.

In winter, the sea wind
unleashes fury, salt, foam
from enormous waves, and
then nature looks oppressed,
a victim of these terrible
forces.

(1904-1973, Chile): Memoirs
  and confli c t s
Susan Wells and Gordon Shepherd*
The real culprit in all these clashes is the
over-capacity of the world’s fishing fleet, which
grew twice as fast as catches between 1970 and
1990, largely due to huge government subsi-
dies. Artisanal fishermen in developing coun-
tries in West Africa, for example, now find their
resources plundered by “distant-water” fleets
from the European Union which pay scant
regard to the needs of local communities or
ecosystems. The EU now has a network of
fishing access agreements with nineteen
African countries, for which licence fees often
represent a tiny proportion of the value of the
catch. Fishing conflicts have even reached the
World Trade Organization; recently the United
S t ates tried to exclude tuna and shri m p
imports from certain countries using catch
techniques which kill dolphins and sea turtles.
Perhaps the greatest conflict to be resolved
is that between human activities
and healthy seas. The environ-
mental community and its non-
g ove rnmental organizat i o n s
(NGOs) are often seen as sepa-
rate “stakeholders”, interested in
simply preventing anyone from
using the oceans. They are vie-
wed as animal “huggers”, espe-
cially given the attention paid to
sea turtles or whales. And yet, the major role of
most NGOs is to develop ways of ensuring the
long-term health of the planet.
Environmental concern must cease to be
seen as a competing “use” of the oceans, and
be recognized instead as a fundamental com-
ponent of all marine activities. Aside from a few
exceptions like military exercises and shipping ,
human activities which depend on the marine
environment require a healthy ocean. Marine
parks and reserves, for example, may appear to
compete with space for resorts and marinas, yet
they play a vital role in protecting habitats on
which fisheries depend and tourism is based.
Most of the issues covered by the media as
conflicts between opposing camps are really
about basic questions over access to and sustai-
nable use of the ocean, from the public outcry
over French nuclear testing in the South Pacific
to NGO clashes with multinational oil compa-
nies such as Shell over oil spills and the dispo-
sal of rigs on the seabed. A similar “conflict” is
brewing over developing new submarine fossil
fuel sources, which flies in the face of all that
we know about climate change.
In some cases, the damage predicted has
not materialized or the potential impacts have
been impossible to prove. But the concerns are
still valid. We know so little about the oceans
that it would be foolish to take anything other
than a precautionary approach. This is clearly
reflected in the United Nations Law of the Sea
Convention, although it is important to note
that work remains to be done because the
convention ignores a crucial issue of the future:
genetic resources of the high seas.
Yet international agreements and regula-
tions can only go so far. We need to build a
broad public constituency through initiatives
like the International Year of the Ocean. The
momentum is growing. A 1997 poll in the
USA, for example, found that 55 per cent of
A m e ricans believe that ocean
exploration should take prece-
dence over space exploration.
At the same time, e c o n o m i c
dependence on marine resources
opens the way to creating social
and economic incentives for their
sustainable use. Eco-labels on pro-
ducts and services are starting to
make a difference to consumers.
C o m p a n i e s , NGOs and intern ational agencies
are looking into new ways of certifying fis h e ri e s
management and aquaculture, in part i c u l a r.
Moving beyond consumers,we need to shift
the balance of power between all stakeholders
so that coastal communities can reassert their
rights to their marine resources. This is not just
a pipe-dream. In the Pacific, authorities are for-
mally recognizing the traditional structures and
techniques revived by local communities to
manage their marine resources. In Mauritania,
the Imraguen (a fishing community) now have
exclusive fishing rights in the resource-rich
Banc d’Arguin Marine Park.
The time has come to bridge these scattered
i n i t i at i ves by reinforcing intern ational and
regional co-operation. This is not simply a
question of good intentions but a realistic stra-
tegy for resolving the my riad of mari n e
conflicts. The stakeholders have everything to
gain in respecting what may well be the world’s
last wilderness. ■

Eve rything flows in the ocean. It is simply
impossible to manage ocean uses in isola-
tion,without recognizing their interaction.
From fishing to offshore oil deve l o p m e n t , a c t i-
vities interact.W h at happens in one ocean area is
likely to affect others , f l owing across political
boundaries or even the world ocean as a whole.
Hundreds of thousands of pages have been
w ritten about “ i n t e gr ated coastal manage-
ment” designed to take  all these interactions
into account. However, one aspect has been
avoided as far as possible at all the intergovern-
mental conferences because of its politically
highly sensitive nature: the interaction between
military and peaceful uses of the oceans.
This interaction may be of a specific nature.
We have seen problems arise from the exemp-
tion of naval vessels from the environmental
protection rules of the Law of the Sea
Convention.Then there are accidents, such as
collisions involving nuclear naval vessels and
the loss of nuclear weapons at sea.A number of
such incidents have occurred.
The conflict,however,is deeper. And it may
not be possible to ignore it much longer. The
management of peaceful ocean uses is too clo-
sely linked to the control of military uses. This
general problem is related to an elementary
fact: without peace and security there can be
neither economic development nor environ-
mental conservation. The next inevitable step
lies in the integration of sustainable develop-
ment and security.
This integration could be best pioneered at
the regional level. While a number of regional
seas programmes are already in place, the
Mediterranean offers a unique opportunity. By
establishing a regional commission on sustai-
nable development, Mediterranean states have
Did sea define the land or
land the sea?
Each drew new meaning from
the waves’ collision.
Sea broke on land to full
identity.
Seamus Heaney 
(1939- Ireland):
“Lovers on Arran”
Peace for the high seas
moved from a sectoral to a comprehensive
approach, opening participation to any high-
level minister involved in ocean affairs. There
would be no reason to exclude defence minis-
ters from this commission, whenever an issue
of regional security conflicts with the peaceful
uses of the sea and coastal regions. These
ministers might form a “virtual regional securi-
ty council” within the commission and promo-
te naval co-operation for peaceful purposes.
In the absence of armed conflict, naval
regional co-operation could extend to joint sur-
veillance and enforcement of pollution regula-
tions or fishing agreements. This co-operation
is already seen in the South Pacific and the
Eastern Caribbean.
Naval co-operation should also extend to
h u m a n i t a rian activities such as search and
rescue, disaster relief or hydrological surveys
and other forms of oceanographic research. In
institutional terms, this is a simple extension of
a process already in course.
Regional seas should be declared, wherever
possible, nuclear-free zones. This is another
way of integrating environmental and political
security while, at the same time, interpreting,
developing and implementing the new prin-
c i p l e , e n s h rined in the Law of the Sea
Convention (Article 88), reserving the high
seas for peaceful purposes. This also includes
the exclusive economic zones.
Promising beginnings have been made with
the Declaration on the Indian Ocean as a Zone
of Peace and the Antarctic Treaty. The Latin
A m e rican Nuclear-Free Zone (established
through the Treaty of Tlatelolco) should now
be extended to the Caribbean. And new zones
wait to be established within the Baltic, the
Arctic, the Mediterranean and the Asian Seas.
Special regional arbitration tri bunals could
make another important contri bution by sett-
ling disputes. Not all regional seas progr a m m e s
will be able to move in this direction at the same
p a c e . Power-political constellations may be
impediments requiring less or more time to
ove r c o m e . But the time has come to put the
issue on the agenda for the next century. ■

In June 1992, heads of state from eleven coun-

ri a ,G e o r gi a ,G r e e c e ,M o l d ova ,R o m a n i a ,R u s-
s i a , Turkey and Ukraine—signed a treaty in
Istanbul setting up the Black Sea Economic Co-
o p e r ation Regi o n .I n c o n c e i vable fifteen ye a rs ago,
this initiat i ve is one of the most dramatic changes
to have taken place in the region since the fall of
the Berlin wa l l .W h at e ver the part i c i p a n t s ’c a l c u-
l at i o n s , tactical considerations and ulteri o r
m o t i ve s , the project illustrates their desire to ease
tensions in the region and establish dialogue.
Two major changes have swept through the
Black Sea regi o n . F i rs t , the herm e t i c a l l y - s e a l e d
border between Tu r k e y, a member of NATO,
and its Wa rs aw Pact neighbours opened up.
S e c o n d , r e l ations between the former Sov i e t -
bloc countries are radically different today from
w h at they were before 1989. In this new
c o n t e x t , r e gional security will probably conti-
nue to hinge on the two main Black Sea powe rs ,
Russia and Tu r k e y, especially since access to the
B o s p h o rus and Dardanelles straits is likely to
remain on the agenda. But that issue will no
longer be framed in the same way it was duri n g
the Cold Wa r. Economic and env i r o n m e n t a l
m at t e rs , especially the transport of oil from
R u s s i a , Kazakhstan and A z e r b a i j a n , will be
more important than they were in the past.
Passage through the straits is at the heart of
the issues concerning the Black Sea because
the transport of oil and gas from the Caspian
Sea is one of the pivotal questions in the region
t o d ay. The 30-year contract for exploiting
Azerbaijani oilfields signed in September 1994
was called the “deal of the century”.The agree-
ment provides for the extraction of 511 million
tonnes, half of which are earmarked for export.
Planned investments amount to $7.5 billion.
Seventy per cent of the profits will go to
Azerbaijan while the members of the consor-
tium, made up of Azerbaijani, Russian and
Western companies, will split 21 per cent.
Three smaller consortiums have been formed
since.
Two proposed pipeline routes were ruled
out from the start. The United States was
opposed to the so-called “Iranian” route, and
Azerbaijan opposed another that would have
run in a straight line through Armenia. Two of
the three options still under considerat i o n
involve the Black Sea.
The first consists of using the existing,
ageing pipeline that connects Azerbaijan and
the Russian Black Sea port of Novorossiysk.
That option is financially advantageous and
meets with Moscow’s approval, but Turkey
raises objections on security and environmental
grounds, especially in relation to the cities of
Istanbul and Canakkale.
The second solution would be to build a
new pipeline through Georgia and Tu r k e y. Two
va riants are possible. In the firs t , more likely
c h o i c e , the pipeline would end up at Supsa, a
G e o r gian Black Sea port . In the second, i t
would branch off at Tbilisi and lead to the
Turkish Mediterranean port of Ceyhan. T h at
solution is ve ry expensive , but would have the
a d vantage of “cutting the cake in two ” a n d
decreasing consumers ’ energy dependence on
R u s s i a . H owe ve r , s e c u rity is a concern since the
Kurdistan Wo r k e rs Pa rty (PKK) has already
announced its intention to sabotage the project.
The possibility remains of shipping oil via
the Black Sea, to the Bulgarian port of Burgas
and thence to the Greek port of
Alexandropolis. That would pose several pro-
blems, including passage into the Aegean Sea,
which is disputed by Athens and A n k a r a .
Another obstacle is that this solution would
bypass Turkey and its high cost could only be
met by the European Union, which would put
a further strain on its relations with Ankara.
A host of factors will influence the choice of
a pipeline route, including the clout wielded by
the United States and other powers such as
China, especially in regard to the transport of
oil from Kazakhstan. Oil, regional co-operation
and military rivalries are some of the issues that
still make the Black Sea one of the world’s most
sensitive geostrategic areas. ■

The cod collapse 
44 THE UNESCO COURIER
T he fish plant in the Newfoundland town of
Trepassey sits mainly idle on Canada’s nor-
theastern shore–a depressing reminder of
the days when cod were plentiful and the streets
bustled with 1,400 working residents.
Trepassey is practically a ghost town now.
The Sunday-night bingo game which used to
draw hundreds of residents now sees about a
dozen people gambling for a measly jackpot.
The community used to screen movies in the
parish hall but no one can afford admission
these days, and many of the young people have
left anyway. Families drift out of town almost
e ve ry we e k , abandoning homes they know
they’ll never sell. “Some of them didn’t even
bother to board their windows,” says Don
Corrigan, a veteran fisherman who still lives in
Trepassey. “They just locked the doors and
moved on. They’ve no intention of coming
back.”
This is the human side of an environmental
disaster. The cod collapse devastated entire
communities in Newfoundland, leaving most
people with no other skills to fall back on.
Today, sustained only by government assistan-
The once prolific north Atlantic cod have virtually

ce, fishermen fester with helpless anger: How
did we let the cod die?
“The cod stocks failed because of greed,”
says Dr. Richard Haedrich, a respected fishe-
ries biologist at Newfoundland’s Memori a l
University, “People wanted all the money they
could get out of the fish.”
After greed, the answer gets more complex,
involving a tangle of government rivalries and
scientific arrogance. In the end, the cod were
defeated by fishermen who became too good at
fishing, scientists who ignored what they didn’t
know and politicians who refused to make the
tough decisions—until it was too late.
By the time Canada’s fisheries minister
John Crosbie closed the northern cod fishery in
July 1992 and threw 40,000 Canadians out of
Curbing the mighty shrimp 
With “prawn farm is prison farm” as his slogan, S. Jagannathan led thousands of
India’s poor farmers and fishers in a seven-year struggle to ban the country’s lucrative
shrimp industry—a Herculean feat as India is one of the world’s top producers. Despite
outbreaks of police violence, passive resistance groups rallied the support of environ-
mental and consumer groups at home and abroad before convincing the Indian Supreme
Court that people’s fundamental rights had been violated by the industry.
“While millions of people were denied a square meal a day, the country was being
forced to produce shrimp for the affluent abroad,” says Jagannathan,an 85-year-old dis-
ciple of Gandhi.“Even as the government was withdrawing subsidies from the farmers,
hundreds of millions of rupees were given as loans and subsidies to big business entering
shrimp farming.”
With fish stocks plummeting,aquaculture had been hailed as a godsend,particularly
for developing countries interested in a new cash crop. Investors streamed into India’s
coastal states like Tamil Nadu,where the area under shrimp cultivation rose from 250 hec-
tares in 1991 to 2,000 in 1995 and production grew from 450 to 3,000 tonnes.
Suddenly, local communities found the “outsiders” (shrimp cultivators) alienating
them from the land they had depended on for generations. At the same time, saltwater
and chemicals used for fertilizer and feed were seeping out of the vast ponds of brackish
water used to grow the shrimp. The run-off and salinization damaged crop lands, man-
groves, drinking water and groundwater aquifers. The brackish water ponds also drained
fresh water supplies as saline levels rose with evaporation.“To raise one tonne of shrimps
requires 50 to 60 million litres of water, half of which is fresh water,” says Bisham Gujja
of the World Wide Fund for Nature. In addition,about 2.5 million cubic metres of effluent
were discharged off the east coast daily.
Presented with these reports, the Supreme Court ruled in December 1996 that vir-
tually all shrimp farms within 500 metres of the high tide line had to be closed by 31
March 1997 and a new aquaculture authority was to apply the “polluter pays”principle.
However, farms continue to operate through “flimsy technical arguments”, says Gujja.
“But investors have pulled out of the industry. Even if the law is amended,aquaculture in
India will never be the same because investors will be careful to follow environmental
regulations and avoid displacing people—at least,that is what the hope is.” G. B. T. ■
their $500-million a year industry, decades of
over-fishing had decimated the ground fish
stocks and virtually emptied one of the most
bountiful areas of the Atlantic. At the time, Mr.
Crosbie tried to pacify fishermen by saying the
moratorium would be over in two years. Not
twelve months passed and Mr. Crosbie was for-
ced to amend his overly optimistic time line: it
would be at least half a decade before the cod
returned. Six years later, the cod stocks remain
at the lowest level observed in history—what
one senior fisheries bureaucrat termed “a cala-
mity of almost biblical proportions.” More
recently, cod was listed as “vulnerable” on
Canada’s endangered species list.
The collapse of the North Atlantic cod is a
tragedy with few innocents. Fishermen, both

offshore and inshore, were guilty of misrepor-
ting their catches, of swarming the cod on
s p awning gr o u n d s , of dumping tonnes of
unwanted fish overboard to rot on the ocean
floor.The days of the radar and high-tech traw-
lers—both foreign and domestic—meant that
entire schools of fish could be easily hunted
down and sucked out of the Atlantic.
Scientists, meanwhile, consistently overesti-
mated the size of the stocks. Fisheries science,
at best, is imprecise. Too little is known about
the nature of the cod and its relationship to the
ocean food chain, predators like seals,and tem-
perature changes. But scientists relied too hea-
vily on offshore catch rates for population esti-
mates, and confused efficient, modern fishing
with what was really happening in the ocean.
With the scientists guessing too high, fisher-
men slashed a far larger portion of the cod bio-
mass than the quotas intended.
“They weren’t fishing what was produced,”
says Dr. Haedrich, “They were fishing what
was producing. Scientists never admitted how
great the uncertainty was and when decisions
were made they fell on the side of what was
favourable economically, rather than what was
conservative ecologically. Nobody stuck up for
the fish.”
Protecting the cod fell to the federal
Department of Fisheries and Oceans. But even
when government scientists warned in the late
1980s that the stocks were in trouble, politi-
cians in Ottawa hesitated to lower quotas and
slice into the fishermen’s income.The industry
was already indirectly subsidized,crowded with
fish processing and canning workers and fisher-
men who work for several weeks and then claim
unemployment insurance for the rest of the
year. Catching less fish would mean hardship
particularly for the people in Newfoundland
who have few other employment options. It
would force layoffs—and the possible closure—
of fish plants. Faced with this reality and inten-
se lobbying from provincial politicians to main-
tain the fishery, the government in Ottawa set
quotas based on social and economic factors,
not science.
Today, in the out ports of Newfoundland,
fishermen forced into poverty have begun to
give up. Many of them no longer expect to see
the cod return in their lifetime.They talk about
selling their licences back to Ottawa and wal-
king away from the sea for good—a painful step
for people who thought they’d fish forever.
The morat o ri u m , s ays Newfoundland

thing I ever worked for. I made my living from
the sea all my working life—where am I going
to turn?” ■

Waste and want
Some 200 million people work in fishing worldwide (industrial and self-employed
combined),while as many as 500 million depend on the oceans indirectly through jobs in
tourism, shipping,oil and gas and other aspects of the fishing industry. In 1996 seafood
production, including aquaculture, was valued at $120 billion. Half the world’s catch is
exported, especially to the developed countries, which absorb 80% of imports in value.
One billion people depend on the sea for their main source of food every day. Global
export earnings from fishing exceed those from coffee, tea, cocoa and sugar. But post-
catch losses are very high,precisely in those places where the need is greatest. In Africa,
losses to self-employed fishermen due to poor unloading,transport and packaging condi-
tions, as well as the hot climate, range from 25% to 50% of the catch.
Aquaculture is booming.Farmed fish production tripled over the last decade, reaching
230 million tonnes in 1996. Farmed salmon output rose from around 34,000 to 300,000
tonnes, shrimp from 50,000 to 720,000 tonnes. Shrimp production has increased six-fold
in Asia and Central America.Aquaculture already meets 20% of world demand for sea-
food and could grow by another 70% between now and 2010. The problem is, instead of
reducing food shortages the industry invests in the production of expensive seafood that
only those in developed countries can afford.What is more, since most of the farmed spe-
cies are carnivorous, aquaculture consumes huge amounts of animal protein that would
go to much better use on children’s plates. J. S. ■

Children feel sorry for dolphins choked by

feration of jellyfish that float around in the deep
blue sea. Scientists observe and measure pollution,
and explain that they do not know how long the
ocean can stand such stress. D e f e n d e rs of the
environment shout themselves hoarse:“The sea
is not a garbage can! Stop the damage.”
Each ye a r , three to four million tonnes of
petroleum end up in the sea. The “black tides”

the gr e ater danger comes from the thousands of
tonnes discharged into the wakes of ships.
“Accidents such as those of the To rrey Canyo n
(1967) or the Amoco Cadiz (1978) are impressi-
ve ,” recalls Ray Gri f f i t h s , f o rmerly in charge of
the Marine Pollution Programme of UNESCO’s
I n t e r g ove rnmental Oceanographic Commission
( I O C ) , “ but the marine environment is the vic-
tim of silent abu s e , with heavier consequences in
the long ru n , from the tanker degassing and
waste oils from tank washing at sea.”
The shipowners’ lack of scruples is, howe-
ver, responsible for only 25 per cent of marine
pollution by hydrocarbons. According to Tony
Knap of the Bermuda Biological Station for
Research, this proportion is even declining. Tar
concentrations in the open ocean are decrea-
sing as the techniques for transporting and
handling petroleum products improve. On the
other hand, 60 per cent of this type of pollution
is of land-based origin, essentially due to the
discharge of used motor oil through urban
sewer systems. The remaining 15 per cent
comes from offshore oil-plat f o rms for the
extraction of natural gas and petroleum.
F r a n c e ’s Research Institute for the
Exploitation of the Sea, Ifremer, has drawn
attention to another danger: the ever increasing
shipment of toxic products, explosives and
industrial and nuclear wastes by sea. The sea
continues to wash ashore barrels and contai-
ners from cargo vessels.
Stowaway bacteria
Worse still, all kinds of “clandestine passen-
gers” are shipped, in spite of themselves, from
one end of the planet to the other: these are the
bacteria, viruses and other organisms in sea
water taken on board with ballast water. On
arrival, this water is discharged without treat-
ment or filtration. Consequently more than
3,000 species of animals and plants are trans-
ported each day. According to James Baker, the
Administrator of the United States National
Oceanic and A t m o s p h e ric A d m i n i s t r at i o n
(NOAA), 80 million tonnes of “foreign” water
are thus discharged into A m e ri c a ’s coastal
waters each year. In the San Francisco area, he
says, 212 exoteric species have been identified.

dred or so new wild species in the last few
years, of which the most famous is the “killer
alga” (Caulerpa taxifolia), said to have been
released from the aquaria of the
Oceanographic Museum in Monaco. These
intruder species may be responsible for the
disappearance of some native fauna or flora
and for the disturbance of local ecosystems.
The consequences of increasing mari t i m e
shipping are thus ve ry va ried and sometimes
u n e x p e c t e d .Ye t , just as for hydrocarbon pollu-
t i o n , shipping is not the only factor responsible.
In fa c t , it accounts for only 10 per cent of all
m a rine pollution. More than three-quart e rs of
m a rine pollutants ori gi n ate on land. They get
into the sea by run-off directly from the land or
via ri ve rs. They can also get there by direct
discharge or via the at m o s p h e r e , G riffiths adds.
The main reasons are the lack of sewerage infra-
s t ru c t u r e , i n t e n s i ve agriculture and industry.
About 70 per cent of wastes discharged into the
Pa c i fic receive no form of prior treat m e n t ,
according to the UN Env i r o n m e n t
P r o gr a m m e ’s (UNEP) 1997 report on The Stat e
of the Env i r o n m e n t. And according to a UNEP
r e p o rt on the Mediterr a n e a n , 1.7 billion cubic
metres of municipal waste water are discharged
d i r e c t l y, of which three-quart e rs is untreat e d .
The North and the South are in the same
boat, the developing countries being increasin-
gly handicapped by the strong populat i o n
increase, lack of financial means and expertise,
all of which prevent them from putting a stop
to the problem. In France, for example, the
water consumed by one third of the population
is still not purified. In Egypt, Alexandria Bay is
being asphyxiated, essentially by the discharge
of sewage, to the extent that some places, such
as the roadstead of Aboukir, are considered to
be biologically dead.
The application of pesticides, herbicides and
other poisons in intensive agriculture allows one
p a rt of the planet’s inhabitants to have affor-
dable food, but depri ves eve rybody of cert a i n
m a rine delicacies. The excess of these chemical
products is washed off the land into ri ve rs and
hence into the sea and “ m ay affect the gr ow t h
and development of marine organisms, n o t a b l y
c rustacean larvae and juve n i l e s ,” G ri f f i t h s
e x p l a i n s. “They may also modify the stru c t u r e
of phytoplankton communities and disturb
p h o t o s y n t h e s i s ” .Wo rse still, the phosphates and
n i t r ates in chemical fert i l i z e rs , which also indi-
rectly enter the sea, p r ovoke “red tides”, m a s s i-
ve outbreaks of unicellular algae. “The tox i n s
they contain progress up the food chain into the
bodies of the top predat o rs , such as the big
fishes in the same area” which is not without
danger to those who eat them. “These  red tides
can also use up the oxygen dissolved in the
wat e r ” to the point of asphy x i ating local fa u n a .
The winds transport many agricultural pollu-
tants over thousands of kilometres, e ven as fa r
as the Antarctic and the A r c t i c. A b n o rm a l l y
high amounts of these chemicals have been
found in the bodies of Inuits, who are major
c o n s u m e rs of marine animal fat s , in the A r c t i c,
and also in the A n t a r c t i c ’s Adélie penguins.
Choked waters
The Baltic Sea is asphyxiated by industrial pol-
lution, with paper-pulp producers discharging
annually 200,000 tonnes of chlorinated pro-
ducts and mercury. E ve ry w h e r e , i n d u s t ri e s
dump their effluents into bodies of water and
their gases into the atmosphere. For example,
66 billion cubic metres of industrial wastes are
discharged annually into the Mediterranean.
The ocean absorbs enormous quantities of
mineral oils, detergents, phosphates, and heavy

depth of 150 to 200 metres, which limits the
available living space for marine organisms,
and especially of slow-growing demersal fish
species,” UNEP warns. Phytoplankton stocks
have fallen by 80 per cent since 1951 along the
coast of California, probably due to global war-

Oceanography. Biodiversity is declining, but it
seems we do not know enough to act. ■

THE UNESCO COURIER 49
When the U. S .war correspondent Martha Gell-
h o rn visited the British V i r gin Islands in the
1 9 4 0 s , she came across a cove “where nothing
had changed since time began, a half circle of white
s a n d ,flanked by huge squarish smooth rocks .. .and the
water turquoise blue.”When she returned many ye a rs
l at e r , she found her cove “full of sun-tanned bodies
and ringed by boats . . . there were bottles and plastic
d e b ris on the sea-bed and picnic litter on the sand.”
To u rism has taken over the Cari b b e a n : in 1997
more than 14 million people took their holiday s
t h e r e , with some three million more dropping in
from cru i s e s. “ Tar balls” on beaches indicate that oil
t a n k e rs and other ships dump their oil and garbage
overboard (despite laws against such practice), w h i l e
pollution off Florida and in the Gulf of Mexico is
causing serious concern .
H owe ve r , it is the eve r - gr owing cru i s e - s h i p
i n d u s t ry which is a particular focus of concern for
the Caribbean Sea. The larger and newer cru i s e
ships have adopted a “ gr e e n e r ” a p p r o a c h , w i t h
m o d e rn waste-processing fa c i l i t i e s , according to the
Center for Marine Conservation Organization in
Wa s h i n g t o n . Yet a report by the Economist
Intelligence Unit concluded that “there is much evi-
dence that dumping of rubbish at sea does take
p l a c e .”
It is not just the seas that have been affected by
the demands of the tourist industry. Those fragi l e
ecosystems surrounding so many Caribbean islands,
the coral reefs, are under stress as we l l . In To b a g o,
t o u rists destroy exposed coral by walking on it in
plastic sandals; in the Bahamas souvenir shops loot
the reefs for stock, loading their shelves with shells,
dead coral and seahors e s ; in Granada, beach ve n-
d o rs sell earrings made out of rare black coral.
Belize has the second longest barrier reef in
the world and well-publicized conservation pro-
jects working to protect it. Yet its two mari n e
n ature reserves have shown signs of env i r o n m e n-
tal degr a d at i o n — a s s o c i ated with too many
people visiting a too fragile site.
In the Cayman Islands the local wat e rs p o rt s
a s s o c i ation has complained to the gove rn m e n t
about the damage done by cruise ships dropping
anchor on the reefs. G ove rnment scientists have
a c k n owledged that more than 300 acres of coral
reef have already been lost to cruise ship anchors
in the harbour at George Tow n , the capital of
Grand Cay m a n . Proposals to increase the num-
ber of cruise ship moorings continue to threat e n
the reefs. And by destroying the reefs, you des-
t r oy the tourist industry.
Short-term pro fit s
While cruise ships bring waste on to the land,
waste from the land is also dumped in the sea. A
1994 study by the Caribbean To u ri s m
O r g a n i s ation (CTO) showed that waste wat e r
t r e atment facilities in many hotels were of “ l i m i-
ted value with regard to the treatment of micro-
b i o l o gical and nutrient remova l ” .The report also
noted that 80-90 per cent of inadequately treat e d
s e wage was disposed of in coastal wat e rs , n e a r
h o t e l s , on beaches and around coral reefs and
m a n gr ove s.
Since then, there has been increasing awa r e-
ness among hotels and tourist boards of the env i-
ronmental costs to the tourist industry of irr e s-
ponsible policies. At least, in theory.The truth is
t h at although lip-service is paid to env i r o n m e n t a l
awa r e n e s s , there is little enforcement of the limi-
ted legi s l ation that does exist. Or as Calvin
H owe l l , the former head of the Cari b b e a n
C o n s e rvation A s s o c i at i o n , e x p l a i n e d : “The pro-
blem has been exacerbated by an attitude that
a p p r oves of short - t e rm rather than long-term
sustainable deve l o p m e n t .” The evidence for this
is that foreign deve l o p e rs are still moving in to
c r e ate resorts and golf courses on coastal lands.
The CTO has on many occasions appealed to
the region “as a matter of urgency ” to put toge-
ther an environmental plan. This has yet to hap-
p e n . Early in 1998, m a n a g e rs from Cari b b e a n
m a rine sanctuaries in more than twenty of the
r e gi o n ’s countries discussed ways of counteri n g
the threat to marine resources. Once again, c o -
o p e r ation was the theme.“ We need to look at the
C a ribbean as one system,” said Richard Curry of
the Biscayne National Park near Miami. B u t
another question remains: when will gove rn-
ments get the message? ■

50 THE UNESCO COURIER
‘It ’s your first trip offshore, i s n ’t it?”The ques-
tion needs no formal response. Only a new-
comer to Conoco’s Viking B gas plat f o rm
could get lost in a dreamy gaze to the horizon or take
a hesitant step on the metal gr ates of the decks,
m e s m e rized by the sight of the North Sea rolling
t h i rty metres below.
For offshore initiat e s , the sea appears to be a
n o n - e n t i t y. The waves just fade into the back-
ground framing daily life.The closest you come
to actually feeling them is when the crane
rumbles to unload cargo—the vibrations gently
rocking the plat f o rm perched on giant metal legs
140 kilometres off the coast of Lincolnshire
( U K ) . Outside of a power fa i l u r e , you wo n ’t
e ven hear the waves roll above the hum, gri n d
and whine of the equipment that keeps about six
million standard cubic metres of gas surgi n g
daily through pipelines lining the seabed to
s h o r e .
“At firs t , yo u ’re just fa s c i n ated by the sea,”
s ays Vera Swa n , one of the few female employe e s
on the cat e ring staff looking after the crew of
s e venty-odd men. “ You get worked up over sun-
sets and stand quietly with the others. But after
six ye a rs , I forget that I am out to sea.”
“I’m new out here,” s ays Steve Slinger. “ S o
the sea is still a novelty for me. I thought the
N o rth Sea was grey but it can be a beautiful tur-
quoise blue. I’m still in the phase of looking out
and thinking ‘ Wow ! ’ But that will probably
p a s s ,” he say s. “The hard part is not being able
to go for a long wa l k .You feel penned in by the
wat e r. But I didn’t come offshore to admire the
wave s. I came because the money is good. A t
f o rt y - five , I ’ ve got no formal qualific ations but a
lot of work experi e n c e . Where I come from in
S c o t l a n d , you are doing quite well by making
£15,000 [$25,000] per ye a r.” S a l a ries offshore
range between £28,000 [$45,000] and £70,000
[$115,000] for senior managers.
Money-making clearly surpasses sea-fa ri n g
as the main offshore at t r a c t i o n . H owe ve r , it is
the routine of plat f o rm life which seems to
d r own out any romantic notions of life at sea.
“ I t ’s just not the same as when yo u ’re on a ship
and you actually go somewhere,” s ays Hank
R aw l i n s , who has worked offshore twe n t y - t h r e e
of his fif t y - five ye a rs. On the plat f o rm , e ve ry-
thing is progr a m m e d . After two weeks of holiday
at home, crew members arri ve by helicopter for
f o u rteen days of twe l ve-hour work shifts, e s s e n-
tially spent adjusting, testing and maintaining
the machinery used to measure and compress
the gas piped in from five remote-controlled
fields nearby. The slightest adjustment requires
c o n s u l t ation with a superv i s o r. “ You can feel like
a robot,” quips crew-member, Mick Draper,
“until you realize just what you are sitting on.
Remember how easy it is to light your gas hea-
ting system at home and consider that out here,
the gas pressure is 1,500 times that .”
But once the shift is ove r , the biggest decision
m ay be whether to have rice pudding at dinner or
a work-out in the gym. For Viking life is surp ri-
singly civilized. S t e wardesses make the beds
e ve ry morn i n g, with fresh laundry folded at the
door and meals waiting in the mess hall.
E venings are spent flipping through the daily
tabloids (delivered by helicopter) or the televi-
sion channels.While alcohol is strictly forbidden,
smoking is perm i t t e d . And home no longer feels
so far away with free telephone calls ava i l a b l e .
Yet for all the creature comfort s , the sea still
sneaks up on the plat f o rm .The sea is so much a
p a rt of daily life that people stop seeing it. Fo r
e x a m p l e , you start preparing for a possible plun-
ge into the fri gid waves (2-60C) before even lea-
ving the coast. C r e w - m e m b e rs and visitors alike
actually practise finding their way out of heli-
c o p t e rs which have crashed and spun upside
d own in the murky, cold water of special pools.
Once offshore, no one dares walk the deck
without donning a bright red suit. If anyo n e
does slip off, a surveillance team can spot and
scoop them up with a “mother ship” and her
“ d a u g h t e r ” constantly patrolling the plat f o rm
p e ri m e t e r.
With so much attention paid to the lives the
sea may take, it is easy to overlook what it gi ve s.
Fishing was a favo u rite pastime until the heli-
copter pilots began complaining about the
smells of dinner-packages taken home. B i r d s
literally drop in, exhausted by the North Sea’s
The sea is so much a part of
daily life on a North Sea gas
platform that you almost forget
it’s there.

d i m e n s i o n s. Suddenly another day spent adjus-
ting machinery gi ves way to tenderness and
c u ri o s i t y, as crew-members flock to the lost
c r e at u r e s , feeding them, c h a rting their arri va l
and even taking them ashore by helicopter.
More import a n t l y, “ you find confid e n c e ,”
s ays June Cerey, who does V i k i n g ’s laundry
d u ring the night shift. After raising her sixteen-
year-old son, she decided at the age of thirt y - five
to carve out a new life for herself offshore. A f t e r
getting past the usual jitters of walking the gr a-
ted decks and feeling a “ wee bit scared” of the
h e l i c o p t e r , the real challenge lay in wa l k i n g
through the mess hall during dinner. “ I ’d get so
e m b a rrassed at being the only wo m a n . T h e y ’r e
not the ‘rough and ready’ guys I expected, bu t
real family men. S t i l l , it takes some confid e n c e .”
“There is also a real sense of freedom,” s ay s
Bob T h o rp e , one of V i k i n g ’s two superv i s o rs.
“Out here, you concentrate on your wo r k
without eve ry d ay wo rries like a broken wa s h i n g
m a c h i n e . You get job sat i s fa c t i o n . Then you go
a s h o r e , and you focus on your home and fa m i l y.”
A b ove all else, the sea imposes self-reliance.
“If there is an emergency, you cannot call an
a m bulance or fir e m e n ,” s ays T h o rp e . “ We rely
on ours e l ve s. This is why you don’t find the ste-
reotypical macho guy out here. Men like that
tend to be ri s k - t a k e rs , thinking they’re ‘too big’
to follow safety procedures. They just don’t last
long because the rest of the crew wo n ’t accept
t h e m , especially since Piper A l p h a .” This is the
name of another North Sea plat f o rm which
exploded ten ye a rs ago, killing 167 of the 226
c r e w - m e m b e rs. A lethal mix of major design
flaw s , poor safety planning and incompetent lea-
d e rship set off the fir e .The sea proved to be the
final escape. The sole surv i vo rs were those who
jumped ove r b o a r d .
Besides the gi ve and take, the sea also
demands respect, which may have been long in
c o m i n g . When the North Sea drilling industry
first began in the 1970s, e nv i r o n m e n t a l
c o n c e rns were non-existent. To d ay companies
like Conoco can no longer ignore them.
According to the ru l e s , the only thing to be
dumped off Viking is human wa s t e . C h e m i c a l s ,
f u e l , bits of broken tools are carefully collected
for disposal onshore.Yet despite all the precau-
t i o n s , gas leaks, p ri m a rily into the at m o s p h e r e ,
c o n t i n u e , e ven though they are a far bigger pro-
blem on drilling plat f o rm s.
On a more personal leve l , it is the sheer force
of the sea which captures the crew’s imagi n at i o n
and respect. “I have been offshore for about ten
ye a rs ,” s ays Paul Preston. “I can walk past the
waves in the morning without really seeing
t h e m . But I am still taken by the sea. D u ring a
s t o rm , you see the strength of it and imagine the
violence it can do. T h at ’s when I realize what a
minuscule dot we are on. M aybe you need to
forget that you are surrounded by the sea.
Because if you began thinking about all that can
go wrong, you could never work out here.” ■

The largest treaty ever negotiat e d , the United
N ations Convention on the Law of the Sea
is a fairly recent deve l o p m e n t ,e n t e ring into
force on 16 November 1994.Yet its roots stem
back to the early 1950s when the UN Intern at i o-
nal Law Commission was set up with the task of
codifying and developing intern ational law,a gr e at
deal of which is unwri t t e n ,a rising from the consis-
tent practice of stat e s. While this customary
approach is excellent for establishing pri n c i p l e s ,
t r e aties are needed to work out the essential details.
For more than 300 ye a rs , it was simply
accepted that coastal states are each entitled to
s overeignty over a body of water immediat e l y
beside the coast. This sovereignty was absolute
Over the last fifty years, international maritime law
has developed very rapidly. This is hardly surprising
given the unprecedented demands now put upon the
oceans, their resources and the marine environment.

except for the right of innocent passage by
foreign merchant ve s s e l s. H owe ve r , i n t e rn at i o-
nal law did not, for example, d e fine the exact
extent of this “ t e rri t o rial sea” (which was three
and is now twe l ve nautical miles) or the condi-
tions of “innocent passage”. So in about 1951,
the Intern ational Law Commission began wo r-
king to resolve these old issues as well as some
new ones: namely the conservation of the

ment on the continental shelf.

resources in what were still regarded as the high

demand led A m e rican experts to look closely at
the seabed of the Gulf of Mexico beyond the
three nautical mile limit. Yet there was a pro-
b l e m . While companies were not prohibited
from exploring beyond that limit, they enjoye d
no legal security in conducting operat i o n s
t h e r e . They also had no “ l e g a l ” rights to any
petroleum they might fin d . In order to prov i d e
a proper legal foundation for offshore petro-
leum activities (and the steep investment requi-
r e d ) , the A m e rican gove rnment proposed that
all coastal states should have the right to extend
their jurisdiction to the edge of the “ c o n t i n e n t a l
s h e l f” .
This proposal was accepted with gr e at
enthusiasm throughout the wo r l d . H owe ve r , t h e
m o t i ves for agreement were not all the same.
For some countri e s , the extension was a cloak
for control over the adjacent fis h e ry. This fun-
damental difference prompted the Intern at i o n a l
L aw Commission to step in and lead the way to
the First United Nations Conference on the
L aw of the Sea, c o nvened in Geneva in 1958.
Yet despite the fact that four Conve n t i o n s — o n
the Te rri t o rial Sea and Contiguous Zone, t h e
High Seas, the Living Resources of the High
S e a s , and the Continental Shelf—were accepted
and signed, there was an obvious dive r g e n c e
b e t ween countries in favour of fis h e ries juri s d i c-
tion and those opposed. As a result, there we r e
major gaps in some of the treat i e s.
A second conference convened in 1960 to
r e s o l ve the issue was an absolute fa i l u r e . F r o m
then on, s t ates which considered that they had
been victimized by the lack of jurisdiction felt
obliged to take the law into their own hands.
C o u n t ries like Iceland started enforcing exclu-
s i ve fis h e ries zones to 12, then 50, then 200
nautical miles. O t h e rs followed suit; s o m e
w i l l i n g l y, o t h e rs less so, but the former eve n-
tually prevailed over the latter while the
C o nvention was still being negotiat e d .
M e a n w h i l e , p r o gress was made in dealing
with mineral resources. C o u n t ries looked
favourably upon the Convention on the
Continental Shelf of 1958 which recognized
“ s overeign rights for the purposes of explora-
tion and exploitat i o n ” on the seabed and sub-
soil of the shelf. It is important to note that the
t e rms “ s ove r e i g n t y ” or “ ow n e rs h i p ” are careful-
ly avo i d e d . The Conve n t i o n ’s framers did not
want to suggest that countries exercised absolu-
te rights beyond the limits of the terri t o rial sea,
because this might ultimately endanger the free-
dom of the seas.
Rights and fre e d o m s
The problem lay in defining the extent of these
ri g h t s. A fixed limit was seen as art i fic i a l . On the
other hand, a reference to the geographical fea-
ture “continental shelf” would not please coas-
tal states like Chile which does not have a nat u-
ral shelf of significant extent. So the edge of the
“ l e g a l ” continental shelf was fixed at the 200-
metre isobath (the wo r l d ’s average shelf edge
d e p t h ) , or beyond “to the point where the depth
of the superjacent wat e rs admits of exploita-
t i o n ” . In other wo r d s , all countries were gua-
ranteed a minimum of control to a 200-metre
d e p t h , while those that had the technology to
exploit deeper could still do so. We must
remember that in 1958, 200 metres seemed to
be an extraordinary depth.The problem wa s , o f
c o u rs e , t h at science and technology deve l o p e d
faster than anyone had thought possible.
So by the early 1970s, it looked as if indus-
t rialized coastal states were about to carve up
the wo r l d ’s ocean space. This was unacceptable
for a number of reasons. F i rs t , it looked like a
bonanza for coastal states at the expense of their
land-locked cousins. S e c o n d , accidents of poli-
tical geogr a p hy sometimes resulted in curi o u s
b o u n d a ri e s. C o u n t ries with relat i vely long
coastlines were clearly going to do better than

o t h e rs. Po rt u g a l , or Chile with its 4,200 kilo-
metres of coast would have a relat i vely vast area
of ocean space compared, s ay, to Spain.
There was also a serious ethical problem. I f
n ational jurisdiction was allowed to spread
u n c h e c k e d , it would be virtually impossible to
fairly distri bute the oceans’ r e s o u r c e s. To coun-
ter this, attention turned to limiting this juri s-
diction and recognizing the areas beyond as the
“common heritage of mankind”.
G i ven the dimensions of the problems, t h e
time was clearly ripe for another intern at i o n a l
c o n f e r e n c e . For example, the archipelagic stat e s
wanted recognition of their ri g h t s
to the wat e rs between and around
their islands. Landlocked stat e s
wished to have their rights of
access to marine resources clearly
a rt i c u l at e d . And there was an
urgent need for detailed ru l e s
regarding the preservation of the
m a rine environment—a topic vir-
tually ignored in 1958. And who
was to gove rn and profit from the
area beyond national juri s d i c t i o n ?
There was also some feeling that
the Intern ational Court of Justice could not pro-
perly resolve these issues. A tri bunal was needed
to specialize in the Law of the Sea.
A third UN conference ended in December
1 9 8 2 . All the part i c i p ating countries voted for
the Convention except four—Israel, Tu r k e y, t h e
United Stat e s , and Venezuela—and seve n t e e n
t h at abstained. Until recently, the countri e s
becoming full parties to the Convention we r e
found in A s i a , A f ri c a , and South A m e ri c a .T h i s ,
and the continuing refusal of the United Stat e s
e ven to sign the Conve n t i o n , led some observe rs
to dismiss the conference results, but it is now
clear that such judgments were premat u r e .
The major difficulty lies with mining the
deep seabed, which is the area considered to be
the common heritage of mankind. US firm s
p r e vailed on the Reagan administration not to
s i g n , much less rat i f y, the Conve n t i o n .
H owe ve r , a compromise on the regime for such
mining was reached in 1994 which should
p r ove acceptable to all (and is to the industri a-
lized countri e s ) .
Yet as in 1958, not eve rything is perfect. Fo r
e x a m p l e , C a n a d a ’s east coast has one of the
wo r l d ’s most extensive continental shelve s.
According to the Conve n t i o n , petroleum activi-
ties in this area are firmly under Canadian juri s-
d i c t i o n . H owe ve r , control over living resources
extends only to 200 nautical miles through the
c r e ation in 1994 of the Exclusive Economic
Z o n e s.The problem is, C a n a d a ’s shelf goes we l l
b e yond this distance, with species swimming in
and out of the zone. S o, in theory, foreign ve s-
sels can remain just outside Canadian juri s d i c-
tion and catch as many fish as they please, to the
possible detriment of Canadian fis h e rs who are
obliged to follow Canadian rules in or out of the
z o n e . This has led to both a confrontation and
t r e aty between Canada and Spain; the problem
was resolved by an A greement on High Seas
F i s h e ries in 1995.
C o n s e rvation and control are the raisons
d’être of the law of the sea. The concept of the
“common heritage of mankind”
recognizes that a country should
not have the right to exploit a
resource (e.g. the deep sea-bed)
merely because it has the capacity
to do so.The common heritage is
held in trust for the peoples of all
c o u n t ri e s.The Convention forbids
e x p l o r ation or exploitation there
without a mandate from the
I n t e rn ational Seabed A u t h o ri t y
(established by the Conve n t i o n

THE UNESCO COURIER 55
International maritime tre a t i e s
While the United Nations Convention on the Law of the Sea deals in more general terms with the different uses of
the seas, there are a number of treaties and instruments on more specific aspects of marine affairs. Here are some
examples:
Maritime safety:
International Convention for the Safety of Life at Sea (SOLAS)
Adopted in 1974,entered into force in 1980, 137  Contracting States.
The most important of all treaties dealing with the safety of merchant ships, its first version was adopted in 1914,
after the Titanic disaster in 1912.It is updated by periodic amendments to keep pace with technical developments in
the shipping industry.
Marine pollution from vessels:
International Convention relating to Intervention on the High Seas in cases of Oil Pollution Casualties.
Adopted in 1969,entered into force in 1975,72 Contracting States. It affirms the right of a coastal State to take such
measures on the high seas as may be necessary to prevent, mitigate or eliminate danger to its coastline following a
maritime casualty.
Convention on the Prevention of Marine Pollution by Dumping of Wastes and Other Matter. Adopted in
1972,entered into force in 1975,77 Contracting States.It prohibits the dumping of certain hazardous materials from
vessels, aircraft,platforms or other man-made structures, requires prior permits for the dumping of a number of other
identified materials and wastes.
International Convention for the Prevention of Pollution from Ships (MARPOL 73/78)
Adopted in 1973. Due to the technical complexity and wide scope of the Convention, various parts of it have ente-
red into force at different dates. Although Annex IV concerning sewage has been accepted by 70 states, their mer-
chant fleets represent only 41.47% of world tonnage. Until countries with the largest fleets have accepted and the
required minimum percentage of 50% is achieved, this annex will not enter into force.
This is the most important and ambitious of all international treaties on marine pollution, covering all the tech-
nical aspects of accidental and operational pollution from ships, except the disposal of waste by dumping and pollu-
tion arising out of the exploration and exploitation of sea-bed mineral resources.
International Convention on Oil Pollution Preparedness, Response and Cooperation. Adopted in 1990,ente-
red into force in 1995,38 Contracting States. It combats major incidents or threats of marine pollution,requires ships
and operators of offshore units to have oil pollution emergency plans, calls for the establishment of stockpiles of oil
spill combating equipment and the holding of combating exercises.
Marine pollution from land-based activities:
No global agreement exists dealing specifically with the prevention and control of marine pollution from land-based
activities. However, the non-binding “Global Programme of Action for the Protection of the Marine Environment from
Land-based Activities” was adopted in Washington on 3 November 1995 and is expected to enhance proper mana-
gement of land-based activities that could cause marine pollution.
Liability and compensation:
International Convention on Civil Liability for Oil Pollution Damage. Adopted in 1969,entered into force 1975,
100  Contracting States. Brought about by the Torrey Canyon incident of 1967,the Convention ensures that adequa-
te financial compensation is available to persons who suffer oil-pollution damage from ships and places the liability
for such damage on the shipowner.
Convention on Civil Liability for Oil Pollution Damage resulting from Exploration for and Exploitation of
Seabed Mineral Resources
Adopted in 1977, not yet in force. It is designed to ensure that adequate compensation is available to victims of pol-
lution damage from seabed activities by means of the adoption of uniform rules and procedures determining ques-
tions of liability.
International Convention on Liability and Compensation for Damage in Connection with the Carriage of
Hazardous and Noxious Substances by Sea. Adopted in 1996,not yet in force. The Convention makes it possible
for the equivalent of $250 million to be paid out in compensation to victims of accidents involving chemicals;covers
not only pollution but also the risks of fire and explosion. ■

56 THE UNESCO COURIER
When international environmental policy
first became a widespread topic of dis-
cussion in the early 1970s, some people
suggested holding industry and states liable for
damage caused by marine pollution.L at e r ,F r a n-
ce’s first Environment Minister, Brice Lalonde,
grabbed headlines by declaring “the polluters will
p ay ” , and state invo l vement in env i r o n m e n t a l
issues was perceived as an encouraging sign.Yet,
25 years later,little progress has been made.
When people hear the words “ m a rine pollu-
t i o n ” , they usually think of accidental fossil fuel
s p i l l s. But most oil slicks are caused by intentio-
nal discharges from ships at sea, which wo u l d
r ather risk being caught in the act and fined than
p ay a special fee to use waste reception fa c i l i t i e s
in harbour. E x p e rience shows that this fee,
which cove rs the cost of waste storage, t r e at m e n t
and disposal, has a perve rse effect by creating an
i n c e n t i ve for tankers to empty their holds at sea
to avoid paying it. If it were automatically inclu-
ded in the overall harbour fee, the fin a n c i a l
i n c e n t i ve to dump at sea would disappear and
m a rine pollution would be reduced.This theory
was proven when a pilot project implemented
b e t ween 1988 and 1991 by German L ä n d e r w i t h
seacoasts led to a significant decline in the num-
ber of oil-coated birds, d e m o n s t r ating the mea-
s u r e ’s effective n e s s.
Without indulging in conspiracy theories,
environmentalists question the ties between the
so-called dirty industries and governments,
including intergove rnmental organizat i o n s.
The Intern ational Maritime Organizat i o n
(IMO), the United Nations agency that regu-
lates shipping, is a case in point. The dues of
IMO member States are determined by the
tonnage of their fleets, which gives countries
with the most super-tankers an obvious advan-
tage. As a result, some IMO delegations inclu-
de members of the oil industry who “repre-
sent” the countries that lend their flags at sea.
IMO says that the fund set up in 1971 to
Sea tribunal
m a kes a slow start
Marine pollution has been punishable by a fine imposed by an international court since
the International Tribunal on the Law of the Sea was set up under United Nations aus-
pices in October 1996. The tribunal is also in charge of settling disputes over the demar-
cation of territorial waters, fishing areas and navigation zones. Its decisions are binding
on the 125 countries that have ratified the International Convention on the Law of the
Sea.
The court is made up of 21 elected members, including five from the group of African
states, five from the Asian group, four from Latin America and the Caribbean,three from
eastern Europe and four from the Western world and countries not associated with any
group, based on the geographical classification used in the United Nations. Judges, diplo-
mats, researchers and professors, the members are all experts in maritime disputes.
After election,lots are drawn to determine which judges will serve terms of three, six
or nine years.The Tribunal’s statutes also provide for a rotation system leaving seven seats
empty so that a partial election may be held every three years. Even after their terms of
office have ended, the judges finish work on cases they have begun.
So far, the only case that has come before the Tribunal, which sits in Hamburg,
Germany, is a dispute between Saint Vincent and the Grenadines and the Republic of
Guinea. In November 1997 the Caribbean island nation went to the court to ask for the
restitution of a freighter Guinea had confiscated for smuggling inside its territorial waters.

THE UNESCO COURIER 57
“The Mediterranean is dying!”exclai-
med Captain Ja c q u e s - Y ves Cous-
teau in the late 1960s. His cry of
a l a rm and many others pushed the Mediterr a-
nean countries to try to reverse the degradation
threatening a sea that has cradled several civili-
z ations and intensive trading networks dat i n g
back thousands of years.
The Mediterranean Action Plan, which was
adopted in 1975, focuses on marine pollution.
But the problem originates with land-based
activities, and cannot be dissociated from the
speed of social and economic change and the
almost total lack of planned management of
coastal areas.
The Mediterranean is under gr owing pres-
sures that have increased needs in eve ry area.
The population of the countries around its ri m
is expected to rise from 400 million today to 550
million in 2025, with the eastern and southern
shores accounting for two-thirds of the gr ow t h .
Coastal areas are heavily built up and during the
same period the coastal population will increase
from 150 to 220 million. L a s t l y, t h e
M e d i t e rranean is the wo r l d ’s leading tourist des-
t i n at i o n . It attracted 100 million visitors in 1997
and the figure is set to double by 2025.
These concerns have led to the develop-
ment of a series of alternative scenarios. Some,
based on the continuation of present trends,
forecast a grim future. Alternative scenarios
suggest ways of reversing the damage and pro-
moting sustainable development. Regional co-
operation will be all-important, for the Action
Plan cannot succeed unless the countries on
the northern shores help their southern neigh-
bours. The European-Mediterranean partner-
ship programme launched in 1995 to turn the
basin into an area of peace and a free trade
zone by 2010 may be the first step towards
achieving this goal. ■

compensate damage from oil spills has already
d i s t ri buted some $267 million—a pittance
considering that in Germany cleaning up an
oil-fouled beach costs between $2,800 and
$5,500 per tonne of sludge. What’s more, the
fund does not cover damage caused by routine
discharges at sea.
IMO policy towards the offshore industry
has also been criticized.The suggestion in 1996
that operational discharges of wastes from off-
shore installations should be regulated like ope-
rational discharge from ships had the oil indus-
try up in arms. To this day, the offshore indus-
try’s discharges are still excluded from the
London Convention, which regulates the dum-
ping of wastes at sea.
Similarly, when in 1995 Denmark’s govern-
ment proposed a moratorium on the submer-
sion of offshore oil rigs, countries with very
strong ties to the oil industry closed ranks and
protested against the measure to protect their
short-term interests, opposing a policy that
could have given the steel recycling industry a
major boost. ■

58 THE UNESCO COURIER
The Dôme Flore oilfield off the coast of Sene-
gal and Guinea-Bissau, 70 kilometres sou-
thwest of the Casamance river, has caused
the two countries plenty of headaches since it wa s
discovered by France’s Total company in 1960.
The only known offshore oilfield within their eco-
nomic zone,which is also rich in fishing resources,
its reserves are put at 100 million tonnes of heav y
oil and only one million tonnes of light.Clearly,
the economic stakes are high.
Senegal-Guinea Bissau
Agreeing to share
After 16 years of legal battles and a few
skirmishes in 1991, the two countries opted for
a pragmatic settlement of their territorial dis-
pute and in October 1993 signed an agreement
to manage and develop their mari t i m e
resources jointly. Until then, such an outcome
had seemed a remote possibility.
The earliest negotiations date back to 1977.
When the two countries failed to reach agree-
ment, they decided in 1985 to take the case to
arbitration before a tribunal. Four years later
the court upheld a Franco-Portuguese agree-
ment of 1960 establishing the maritime boun-
dary between their two colonies. But Guinea
Bissau rejected this decision, arguing that the
tribunal had failed to provide a map showing
the exact boundary, as the two parties had
requested.
In March 1991, Guinea-Bissau lodged an
appeal against the decision with the
‘The Oceans,a Heritage for the Future” is the
theme of EXPO ’9 8 , the 20th century ’s last
gr e at intern ational exposition. C o i n c i d i n g
with the 500th annive rs a ry of Po rtuguese nav i g at o r
Vasco da Gama’s explorat o ry journey to the Indies,
the exposition is being held in Lisbon,the capital of
Po rt u g a l , from 22 May to 30 September.
With over 145 countries taking part , and an
expected 15 million visitors , EXPO ’98 offers a
unique opportunity to increase public awa r e n e s s
about the ocean and about United Nations acti-
vities in this fie l d .The UN pav i l i o n , set up under
the joint leadership of UNESCO and the United
N at i o n s , is highlighting the whole range of co-
o p e r at i ve ocean-related activities carried out by
the United Nations fa m i l y, as well as the monito-
ring and research activities of UNESCO’s
I n t e r g ove rnmental Oceanographic Commission
( I O C ) . This public inform ation campaign is
taking place within the context of the
The Year of   
International Court of Justice at The Hague.
Dismissing the appeal eight months later, the
Court upheld the Franco-Portuguese agree-
ment of 1960 and asked both parties to agree
on a border between their respective exclusive
zones.
Guinea Bissau went along with the offer of
b i l ateral talks and eventually accepted the
C o u rt ’s ve r d i c t . In 1995 the two countries set
up a joint body called the Management and Co-
o p e r ation A g e n cy (AG C ) , for the joint deve l o p-
ment of resources located between azimuths
268° and 220°, s t a rting from Cape Roxo on the
land frontier between the two stat e s.
The countries agreed on an equitable share-
out of fishing resources, but not of oil.In accor-
dance with the decision of the International
Court of Justice at The Hague, 85% of oil pro-
fits will go to Senegal and 15% to Guinea
Bissau. If new oil reserves are discovered, the
20-year agreement will be revised accordingly.
Senegal and Guinea Bissau have realized
that they are better off getting along with one
another than prolonging the dispute.The batt-
le of Dôme Flore will not take place. ■

million Ecus, and the deal cannot be revised
until it expires—a concession insisted on by
Brussels to ensure the stability of the agree-
ment, which calls for, among other things, the
creation of a Moroccan-European commission
that will meet once a year to make sure the
accord is being followed and to settle disputes,
if any. But the only time the commission has
met was in 1996. A second meeting, i n
December 1997, was suspended after it had
barely begun.
Stressing the alarming drop in its fis h i n g
r e s o u r c e s , which experts put at 27 per cent in
1 9 9 7 , Morocco decided to unilaterally increase
the replenishment period to four months instead
of the two provided for in the agr e e m e n t . On 27
A p ri l , d u ring Spanish prime minister José Mari a
A z n a r ’s visit to Rabat , his Moroccan counter-
p a rt , A b d e rrahman Yo u s s o u fi, said co-operat i o n
on fishing must take new forms in the future.
And in May, M o r o c c o ’s fis h e ries minister ru l e d
out any possibility of renewing the present
a greement as it now stands. In the same breat h ,
he decided to close the area along the Saharan
coast between Boujdour and Dakhla to fis h i n g
for a one-year peri o d , r e n e wable if need be, i n
order to preserve sardine
s t o c k s.

Morocco- European Union
C o - o p e ra t i o n in choppy waters
For the past ten years,the question of fishing
rights has been a stumbling block in rela-
tions between Morocco and the European
Union (EU). With a coastline of nearly 3,500
k i l o m e t r e s , Morocco offers major possibilities
t h at have kindled a keen interest on the part of the
E U. F i ve hundred Spanish vessels fish in Moroc-
c o ’s exclusive economic zone—95% of the
Union’s fishing fleet operating in the area.
Three four-year agreements have been suc-
cessively concluded, largely concerned with
granting the EU fishing rights in Moroccan
waters in exchange for financial compensation.
The first agreement, signed in March 1988,
was brought to a more or less successful
conclusion. The second, signed in May 1992,
was revised midway through before being cut
short. Morocco’s fishing resources were deple-
ted, so that in view of the need to preserve
stocks, the two parties agreed to scuttle the
deal one year before it was due to run out.
Nine months of tough negotiations ensued
before a third agreement was signed in
November 1995, which is still in force. The
accord entitles the EU to new fishing rights off
the Moroccan coast in return for a total of 500
I n t e rn ational Year of the Ocean (IYO ) , which has
been proclaimed by the United Nations for 1998
and for which UNESCO is the lead agency.
I YO activities are designed to achieve three
o b j e c t i ve s : to make people aware that mari n e
resources are not inexhaustible and that the
ocean cannot absorb indefinitely all the pollu-
tion caused by uncontrolled deve l o p m e n t ; t o
p e rsuade gove rnments to gi ve the oceans the
p ri o rity they deserve ; and to develop a more
e f f e c t i ve system of global scientific co-operat i o n
to improve our understanding and management
of marine ecosystems and ocean resources.
EXPO ’98 is the most spectacular of the
wide range of IYO activities, but there are
many others. On IOC’s initiative, an Ocean
Charter has been drawn up.This is not a legal-
ly binding document but a declaration of com-
mitment in which the signatories—governmen-
tal authorities and private bodies—pledge to
initiate and respect co-operative actions to pre-
serve the oceans and coastal areas. UNESCO
is also preparing an ocean education package
and a beach clean-up project. IOC is preparing
an overview of current scientific knowledge,
the first phase of which will be published by the
end of the year. Also in the works are an ency-
clopaedia and an electronic atlas. Many coun-
tries are contributing to IYO, most important-
ly by holding high-level scientific conferences
on ocean-related matters.The calendar and the
themes of these conferences are featured in the
I YO website (http://www. u n e s c o. o r g / i o c / i yo /
iyohome.htm). Research and training cruises
are taking place aboard Russian, Norwegian,
Chinese, Indian, Korean, Indonesian, Cana-
dian, Malaysian and other vessels, which use
their ports of call to draw public attention to
the need for marine conservation. ■

Don is from Sri Lanka. I met him in the
Greek port of Piraeus.A victim of his coun-
t ry ’s civil wa r , his wife and two of his three
children were killed when someone blew up the
bus they were on.To support his surviving child,
Don decided to go to sea.In Madras,he embar-
ked on a freighter bound for Canada.
When the ship called at Halifax, Nova
Scotia, Don checked the time it was due to
leave before going ashore. But when he came
back earlier than the scheduled embarkation
time, the ship was gone. He had no identity
p a p e rs—the captain had confis c ated them
when he signed up—and no money. He was
taken in at a seamen’s hostel where he mana-
ged to find legal assistance.
To prove he was telling the truth, Don
wrote a long, detailed report on the ship’s cargo
and on events that had occurred during the
voyage and gave the names of the rest of the
crew.The document was sent to the Center for
Seamen’s Rights in New York, where it was
checked and certified as accurat e . T h e
Canadian agents of the ship’s Greek owner
were ordered to buy Don a plane ticket home,
but they refused to pay him his back wages.
Don, who still works at sea despite his
ordeal, is a modern-day galley slave—exploi-
ted, badly paid or not paid at all—recruited by
a front company to crew dilapidated ships
often flying a flag of convenience.
One-third of the world’s 37,000 cargo ships
fly such flags.There is no link between the shi-
powner and the country of registration. All the
owner has to do is sign up at a consulate anyw-
here in the world and pay. According to one
London University transport economist,“com-
panies register their ships under these flags so
as to maximize profits and minimize costs by
avoiding economic regulations and require-
ments which apply to vessels registered in their
own countries.”
They are spoiled for choice—twenty-seven
countries offer the facility, which is purely a
matter of money. Registering a ship in Cyprus
is 65 per cent cheaper than in Greece and even
less expensive if the country chosen is a tax
haven like Panama, Bermuda or Gibraltar.
Such flags mean there are no rules on hiring
practices or working conditions to follow. The
crews have no trade union protection or social
security benefits. In fact, they have no rights at
all.
On the dockside in Piraeus, seamen from
the Philippines, Malaysia, Ghana and Chile all
had grim tales to tell. One man who refused to
clean the ship’s toilets was tethered to the mast
by a 1.5-metre chain for two days without
water on the equator, and then locked in his
cabin. Another told how his ship ran out of
food for the last eight days of its voyage and the
crew survived by catching a shark.Another sea-
man recalled how his ship’s freezers, full of
Senegalese shrimps, broke down and the crew
had to eat their rotting contents day after day.
Yet thousands compete for such jobs, ready
to pay anything from $300 to $1,000 to be
taken on, after buying a passport, seaman’s
papers and sometimes an officer’s or engineer’s
certificate, all of them available on the quiet at
ports from Piraeus to Lagos. Some captains
confiscate the crew’s papers as soon as they
embark, reducing them to slaves.
International organizations concerned with
these issues have their work cut out.After more
than a decade of negotiations, the United
N ations Conference on Trade and
Development (UNCTAD) drafted an interna-
tional ship regi s t r ation agreement in 1986
aimed at preventing shipow n e rs
from dodging their responsibilities
by vanishing into thin air whenever
a problem arises.Twelve years later,
it is still not in force because fewer
than forty countries have ratified it.
A code of conduct has been appro-
ved by fif t y - s e ven countries bu t
rejected by those which offer flags
of convenience.
In 1996 the Intern at i o n a l
Labour Organisation adopted
seven new recommendations on the
hiring of seamen and their pay,
hours and working conditions. The
countries that ratify them agree to
carry out inspections and publish
Recruited by unscrupulous shipowners to sail in rust buckets flying
flags of convenience, many sailors leave their rights ashore.
The sea.What joy to
know it is so near. Of
course we seldom went to
the sea, but that doesn't
matter. It's there, and
that's that, behind the
mountains, a few dozen
kilometres from home . . .

mountains that we
seldom went to the sea.

THE UNESCO COURIER 61
Tre a s u re h u n t e rs 
b e w a re
Faced with advanced technology, laws full of loo-
pholes and the growing number of treasure hunters
and sports divers, several international organizations,
working under UNESCO’s auspices, are drawing up an
international convention to preserve underwater heri-
tage. But what exactly would it aim to protect?
According to a draft of the text presented in April
1998 by the secretariats of UNESCO and the United
Nations Division for Ocean Affairs and the Law of the
Sea,“underwater cultural heritage means all traces of
human existence, including sites, structures, artifacts,
and human remains, together with their archaeologi-
cal and natural contexts, as well as wrecks, such as
vessels, aircraft or other vehicles or any part thereof,
their cargo or other contents, together with their
archaeological and natural heritage.”
But this definition “only applies to heritage which
has been lost or abandoned and submerged for at
least 100 years,” explains Graham Henderson, the
chairman of the International Council on Monuments
and Sites’ (ICOMOS) International Committee on
Underwater Cultural Heritage. “It would be left up to
states parties to introduce national legislation cove-
ring sites underwater for less than this period. But it
would leave the Titanic, which sank in 1912, for
example, unprotected.Nor does it apply to any milita-
ry craft or their contents owned or operated by a
state.”
The Titanic case also illustrates the problem of
heritage sunk in international waters, where the “fin-
ders keepers” rule still prevails. The draft proposes
three solutions. States could either exercise tighter
control over the activities of their nationals; ban the
use of their ports by ships engaged in improper exca-
vations; or forbid the entry of improperly raised arti-

a long one and there is only a slender possibility that
participants will agree on a final version of the
convention before 2000.
In the meantime, treasure hunters can carry on
searching for wrecks. They respond to the reproaches
of legal “purists” by maintaining that they are just as
useful as archaeologists because without their activi-
ties many treasures would remain undiscovered. The
fact is, however, that they often act more like looters
than enlightened amateurs. S. W. ■

For outsiders , they are the “sea nomads”.
Admittedly peaceful, simple folks, they are
h owe ver mistrusted as fugi t i ve pagan sava g e s.
Their houseboats look dirty, crowded with chil-
d r e n , women cooking and a tangled mess of hou-
sehold belongings likely to include a cackling
rooster among the Bajau and a dog among the
M o k e n . Moored along beaches, l a g o o n s ,e s t u a ri e s
and even the backwat e rs of beach-front hotels,
their floating communities are scattered throu-
ghout Southeast Asia.
They form three distinct cultural gr o u p s
stemming from archipelagic env i r o n m e n t s : t h e
Orang Laut from estuaries of the Lingga-Riau-
Straits of Malacca mudflat s , the Moken from
the Mergui Archipelago and the Bajau from the
Sulu Archipelago of the Philippines, in the adjoi-
ning islands of East Born e o, and those of eastern
I n d o n e s i a , in particular the coasts of Celebes
and Flores.
Their numbers remain somewhat of a my s t e-
ry, p a rtly due to imprecise census-taking.W h i l e
they are counted as citizens in the countri e s
where they are found, they are considered as
ethnic minorities subject to discri m i n ation reser-
ved for “ o u t s i d e rs ” .
A n t h r o p o l o gists put their total population at
about 35,000. Yet they estimate that probably
not even one third of this number still live by tra-
dition—meaning with the sea, not simply on the
s e a , nor by it—because of sedentari z at i o n .T h i s
distinction is important but often ignored as
m a ny anthropologists and others continue to
oppose land and sea people, as if the two ways of
life contradicted one another.The boat dwe l l e rs ,
in fa c t , o s c i l l ate between sea and land.
The Moken compare themselves to their
“ mythical sister” the turt l e . They live betwe e n
t wo elements, water and land. Moored in a
lagoon or the leeward edges of an island, t h e i r
h o u s e b o ats are removed from the threats of
coastal predat o rs but not far enough to be swe p t
away by ebbing curr e n t s.

With va ri at i o n s , their houseboats are the
o u t ri g g e rs with mounted roofs common to
Southeast Asia and the Pa c i fic. The Moken
k a b a n g, for example, “are a marvel of ingenuity,”
according to anthropologist Pierre Ivanoff who
studied them in the 1950s and 1960s. “ S t a b l e ,
l i g h t , able to carry five to eight people, they are
capable of withstanding the wo rst storms of the
Indian Ocean. They are seven to ten metres
l o n g, and one and a half metres wide. . . . Not a
single nail is used in constru c t i o n : the va ri o u s
sections are secured with wood and bamboo
p e g s , strands of rattan or va rious creepers ,” w i t h
palm leaves used for roofs and sails.
Again to outsiders, the boats look crowded.
There is barely enough room to stand, let alone
walk. Older men find their legs gnarled from
the lack of movement.Yet here we fall into the
trap of comparing our perception of space on
land and at sea with theirs. With endless hori-
zons as a backdrop for the constant interplay
between water, air and light, these people live
open and free.
The monsoons shape and regulate their live s.
As the waves rise dangerously high with the
r a i ny season, they seek the protection of the
s h o r e . The Orang Laut are settled on fixed sites
in estuari e s , while the Moken and Bajau move
from one temporary mooring to another in
lagoons or along beaches and the leeward edges
of islands.This time is largely spent constru c t i n g
For centuries the waves have shaped the lives of
the Orang Laut, Moken and Bajau. How much longer
can the traditions of these small Southeast Asian
communities withstand the pressures of ‘modern’
development?

b o ats or repairing them, while food is found
hunting wild pigs, g at h e ring fruits and ve g e-
tables and digging up tubers like ya m . Once the
d ry season sets in, they ship off again.
The Moken also move from island to
island, hunting sea turtles and collecting sand
worms, shellfish, and clams for food. But para-
dox of paradoxes, they avoid the main fruit of
the sea—fish! Sea-slugs are the closest they
come and even these creatures are collected
only to be sold to the Chinese,
who love them. In contrast, the
Orang Laut and the Bajau run
after the fish, with the first group
scouring estuary habitats and the
second sifting through coral reefs
and mangroves.
C l e a r l y, the sea represents
life. Children are always born on the house-
boats, never on land. They play either on the
strands or swimming around the boats.Women
would never think of cooking ashore, even
during the rainy season when their boats are
moored along beaches.
In contrast, death and illness are bound to
land. All of the sea people go ashore to heal or
to bury their dead. Older people who feel that
they have outlived their usefulness to the com-
munity often discreetly ask to be left on a
deserted isle to die.
While spirits (h a n t u) roam eve ry w h e r e — o n
t r e e s , under water and rocks, in caves and eve n
the air, their sole requirement of the sea-people
is respect. The sea people believe that failure to
respect the environment—the abode of the spi-
rits—results in illness, c o n flict and deat h . A
fis h e rman who dares to cast a net during the
r a i ny season without performing the prescri b e d
ritual inevitably suffers. The only cure lies in
exorcism and appeasement. B a s i c a l l y, a shaman
e n t e rs into a trance to invite the spirit to inhabit
a wooden human image which is then brought
to an island designated for the spiri t s. The dead
are bu ried in common island cemeteri e s.
These associations of illness and death do
not mean that land is the domain of evil or suf-
f e ring for the boat - d we l l e rs. It simply signifie s
t h at there are things which belong to the land

for the Chinese, and the Bajau trepang (sea

These tasks were considered to be low l y, wo rt hy
only of sava g e s. And ye t , had it not been for
these specialized roles, the sea people wo u l d
h ave lost their cultural identity long ago.
I n d e e d , it looks as if fear of conve rsion to
I s l a m , which swept the region from the four-
teenth century on, gr e atly motivated the sea
people to stay offshore. It is their best way of sur-
viving and conserving their beliefs. All three
groups are bound by a common thread: t h e
opposition between us and them; O rang sama
and O rang baga i, i n s i d e rs and outsiders.
Whereas their communities are structured on
fleets organized around kinship pri n c i p l e s ,
human relations are gove rned by the more flu i d
distinction between us and them. H i s t o ry has
instilled in them a fear of those who do not
belong to them. And their instinct is to fle e —

A l g e ri a , the women of entire villages have

While men may also be victims of rape
and sexual mutilation during arm e d

violence is usually targeted specifically at
wo m e n . But women are often reluctant to

social stigma or because they feel that it is
useless to report the crime in conditions of
chaos and societal breakdow n . The extent
of sexual violence often becomes evident
long after the world knows the extent of
Life must go on
Juan Boggino and Diane Kolnikoff are psychotherapists at a counseling centre run by the Primo Levi
organization in Paris, which helps refugees who have been tortured.Some of them,like the Haitian
woman who has just arrived at the centre, are victims of rape. “She left her country after being
raped in prison,” says Kolnikoff. “She abandoned the child conceived during the rape and came to
live alone in France. Since then,she has given birth to another baby, but still has thoughts of infan-
ticide even though the second child has nothing to do with her past.” Hers is one of many heart-
rending stories, such as that of an African woman who is “always dreaming she has a weight on
top of her that keeps her from moving.”
Even years later, “the suffering never goes away,” says Boggino. It manifests itself as a “deep
breakdown of the individual and feelings of shame and humiliation that are especially strong since
the crime was committed in front of witnesses, the family, the village. Young women who were vir-
gins at the time of the rape say no one will ever want them. It is impossible for them to imagine
having a normal relationship with a man.” Horror gives way to the absurd. These women feel guil-
ty rather than victimized. They cannot accept that “their torturers were the inhuman ones. They
wonder why they survived while others died. They tell themselves their lives were spared because
they let themselves be raped.”
Nightmares, amenorrhoea, repeated illnesses, fear of physical contact and frigidity are the
most common symptoms of their emotional suffering. For these women,silence is suffocating while
speech is golden.It allows them to talk about what happened,to cry, to express their feelings and
their anger. Speaking lets them separate themselves from the torture they went through,explains
Kolnikoff. It allows them to live “with”rape rather than “in”it.After psychotherapy, some of them
manage to feel comfortable with their bodies again,to give and receive pleasure and even to love
the children “born of bad memories,” provided they accept them as their own.
Talking about the rape also makes victims feel they have a right to point a finger of blame at
the culprit,which allows them to shed feelings of guilt and shame. “But these women need to be
believed. That’s where the law and the courts have a decisive role to play.” No cure is possible
unless the rapists are named and brought to trial. S. Bou ■

who are often known as “e n fants des mau-
vais souve n i rs”(children of bad memori e s ) .
The same pat t e rn is true of the form e r

No one would deny that prevention is
better than cure. But in the poorest
countries,should treatment of Aids
p atients be neglected in favour of preve n t i o n
on the grounds that caring for them is pro-
hibitively expensive?
Thirty million people worldwide are
infected with the virus that causes Aids,
and over 90 per cent of new cases of
contamination occur in countries of the
South. Africa south of the Sahara alone
has two-thirds of all reported cases. The
disease is out of control in Asia—five mil-
lion people in India may be HIV-positive.
Meanwhile,the number of reported cases
continues to diminish in Europe and fell
by 27 per cent in 1997, says the World
Health Organizat i o n ’s European
Monitoring Centre. Mortality rates from
Aids are down in all the industrialized
groups and then governments around the
world to condemn these acts and call for
an international tribunal to hold the per-
petrators accountable. Following several
Security Council resolutions condemning
the massive , organized and systemat i c
detention and rape of wo m e n , t h e
International Criminal Tribunal for the
Former Yugoslavia was founded in 1993.
From the beginning, one of the purposes
of setting up this court was to prosecute
crimes of sexual violence. The tribunal
was the first to recognize crimes of sexual
violence as war crimes and as “grave
breaches” imposing on states the duty to
search for the allegedly guilty persons and
bring them to court or extradite them for
prosecution elsewhere.This is something
new. Sexual violence is not explicitly cal-
led a grave breach in the main law of war
documents—the 1949 Geneva
Conventions and their 1977 Additional
Protocols. However, it is generally accep-
ted that these crimes meet the criteria of
“willfully causing gr e at suffering or
serious injury to body or health” and
“torture or inhuman treatment”.
Sexual violence can also be regarded as
a crime against humanity, like murder,
e x t e rm i n at i o n , e n s l ave m e n t , d e p o rt at i o n ,
i m p ri s o n m e n t , t o rture or pers e c u t i o n ,
depending on the surrounding circum-
s t a n c e s. H i s t o rically howe ve r , c rimes of
sexual violence have rarely been prosecu-
ted under any of these headings. O n e
exception was the To k yo World War II tri a l ,
where several Japanese officers were char-
ged and held liable for the rape of 20,000
women during the occupation of Nanking
(China) in 1937.
D u ring the prosecutions of top-ranking
World War II criminals at Nuremberg, r a p e
was not listed as a crime against humanity.
H owe ve r , it was prosecuted in the nat i o n a l
t rials that followed Nuremberg, and it is
n ow accepted as belonging on the list.
Both the Yu g o s l av and Rwandan Tri bu n a l s
explicitly include it in the definition of
c rimes against humanity.
The experience of these two tri bu n a l s
has demonstrated both the progress that
has been made and the difficulties that have
a risen in prosecuting crimes of sexual vio-
l e n c e .To dat e , t wenty-six people have been
charged with committing sexual at r o c i t i e s ;
h owe ve r , m a ny of them are still at large. I n
June 1996, the first indictment dealing
solely with sexual violence and enslave m e n t
c rimes was issued. It alleges that , in 1992
when the city of Foca (south-east of
S a r a j e vo) was ove rrun by Serb forces,
Muslim and Croat women were detained
and repeatedly beaten and raped. Only one
of the eight men accused in this indictment
t u rned himself in to the tri bu n a l .
Few pro s e c u t i o n s
U n f o rt u n at e l y, the Rwanda Tri bunal has
publicly charged only two people with
c rimes of sexual violence, both in 1997—
three ye a rs after it was founded. The firs t
was Je a n - Paul A k aye s u , the mayor of Ta b a
c o m m u n e . E ven though there had been
r e p o rts of widespread sexual abuse in
Ta b a , he was not initially charged with
these cri m e s , and it was not until witnesses
t e s t i fied about rape, and a coalition of
human rights and wo m e n ’s organizat i o n s
submitted a bri e f, t h at the prosecutor
amended the indictment to add sexual vio-
lence to charges of genocide, c ri m e s
against humanity and war cri m e s. This is
the first case before the Rwandan Tri bu n a l
in which someone is specifically charged
with crimes of sexual violence, and the firs t
to address the issue of a leader’s responsi-
bility for encouraging or allowing others to
commit rape.
G ove rnments are now in the process of
finalizing the statute of a perm a n e n t
I n t e rn ational Criminal Court . This court
will be able to build on the advances of the
Yu g o s l av and Rwandan Tri bunals and will
hopefully reve rse the historical trend. ■

assistance to developing countries, insti-

and reasoning in terms of cost-effective-

ethical dimension.
The ethical question exists at three

d e velopment aid, should funds be earm a r-
ked to pay for expensive Aids treat m e n t ?
Should nothing be done until the new
d rugs are available for all? Given the high
cost of retroviral dru g s , would it be ri g h t
to select some patients for treatment and
not others? It will take at least another ten

countries.Would the results have been the
same if prevention had been the only stra-
tegy used? Could so much have been
achieved with the same meagre funds
allocated to the countries of the South,
where per capita spending on Aids is 100
times lower than in the developed world?
Yet the European Commission, the
leading international contributor to Aids
programmes in the developing nations,
and the World Bank, in its 1997 report
Confronting Aids, say the money should be
spent almost entirely on preve n t i o n .
World Bank experts argue that treating
Aids patients would be at the expense of
caring for victims of other diseases which
are just as deadly, especially since anti-
Aids drugs are expensive and complicated
As Aids continues to spread
in most countries of the
South, should its victims be
deprived of access to
treatment? A moral case is
increasingly being voiced
against the cost-effective
approach to medicine.
Right now, access to care in the vast
majority of developing countries is limi-
ted at best to treatment for opportunistic
infections. Moreover, medical treatment
is usually not free, so the poorest people
have no access to it. Do we have the right
to ignore the plight of these suffering mil-
lions? A recent study in Thailand showed
that the rate of HIV transmission from
mother to foetus could be halved by
administering AZT over a short period to
pregnant women before they give birth.
Since 550,000 babies are born with the
HIV virus each year, it is easy to imagine
how many lives AZT could save.
High stakes
The debate has been raging for some
t i m e . A rnaud Mart y - L ava u z e l l e , p r e s i-
dent of Aides, a French non-governmen-
tal organization,says it started at the 1994
i n t e rn ational conference on Aids in
Yokohama. “We really became aware that
it wasn’t enough to rely on prevention
strategies alone,” he says. “With the new
drugs and the need to transform the
disease’s image, we believed it was neces-
sary . . . to include the dimension of
access to care.” Specialists increasingly
blame the failure of prevention pro-
grammes on the lack of simultaneous
treatment. Indeed, it is difficult to see
how prevention could work if no treat-
ment is offered after a positive HIV test.
The idea that prevention and treatment
must go hand-in-hand to provide an
across-the-board response to the epide-
mic is making headway. “Of course pre-
vention is essential. But it would be une-

C h i l d ren 
behind bars
Aminor in Madagascar has been serving a two - year prison sentence since 1996 for stea-
ling a pineapple. H e ’s lucky. In another country he might have been immediately put
to death,like the homeless child in the village of Kounbra (Chad),who was found
lying in a pool of blood and abandoned to the mercy of a pig, on a soccer field.In January
1997 he was shot for petty theft,says the human rights group International Prison Watch
( I P W ) .The organizat i o n ’s report on children in pri s o n , published in May 1998, d e s c ri b e s
conditions in the 51 countries where data are available.
No one knows exactly how many children are imprisoned around the world, and for
good reason.The question is too thorny, and the definition of a minor varies from one
country to the next. In South Africa, Bangladesh, Ireland, Pakistan and some states in
the United States, seven-year-old children are held responsible for criminal acts. In
Mali, Romania, the United Kingdom, Turkey and Viet Nam the age varies from ten to
fourteen.In Mauritania and Luxembourg, children can be detained at any age. In 1995
nearly 70,000 minors were incarcerated in the United States, and in 1997 there were
1,200 in prison in South Africa and between 15,000 and 20,000 in Indonesia.
Sometimes placed in the same penitentiary facilities as adults, minors are the vic-
tims of many abuses. In Mauritania cases have been reported of children who are strip-
ped naked, bound hand and foot, exposed to the sun and beaten with truncheons or
electric cords. In American prisons, 40,000 minors are raped each year.
In the southern countries, their diet is usually spartan. In Burundi, for example,
they are entitled to just one 300-gramme ration of beans or manioc flour a day. National
legislation makes provision for medical care, but the reality is quite different. In some
Russian prisons, scabies, tuberculosis and typhus are rampant among minors.
At Tongi prison in Bangladesh, young inmates receive training. Yet in a wealthy
country like Luxembourg , no provision is made for their education.
Generally speaking, none of the countries mentioned in the IPW report has found
a just way to treat minors who have broken the law. S.A.O. ■
thical and counter-productive to write off
the millions of people with Aids as a lost
cause. The long-standing dichotomy bet-
ween prevention and care is really a thing
of the past,” says Dr. Awa Marie Coll
Seck, director of the United Nations’
UNAids programme.
On 5 November 1997, U N A i d s
announced the start of an initiat i ve aimed
at improving access to HIV drugs in deve-
loping countri e s. Four countri e s — V i e t
N a m , U g a n d a , Chile and Côte d’Ivo i r e —
are taking part . To implement the pilot
p r o grammes they will have to gear their
health care infrastructures and drug distri-
bution systems to the special needs crea-
ted by HIV, and their ministries of health
will have to provide the bulk of the fun-
d i n g . A f rican organizations of people
living with the Aids virus are hopeful that
r e t r oviral drugs will soon be available in
their countri e s , but so far none of the pilot
p r o grammes has really got under way.
Political overtones
The debate has spilled over into the politi-
cal arena, which may speed things up. O n
7 December French President Ja c q u e s
C h i r a c, addressing the 10th pan-Afri c a n
conference on A i d s , in Abidjan (Côte
d ’ I vo i r e ) , s a i d , “it would be shocking,
unacceptable and contrary to the most
basic principles of solidarity to adopt a
t wo-speed approach to A i d s. . . . We must
do all we can to extend the benefits of the
new treatments to needy people in A f ri c a
and the rest of the wo r l d .” The next day
French health minister Bernard Kouchner
suggested setting up an Intern at i o n a l
Therapeutic Solidarity Fund with the aim
of making access to treatment easier. T h e
fund was discussed at length during the
G8 summit held in Birmingham (UK)
from 15 to 17 May. The snag: finding the
$5 billion funding. T h at may take some
t i m e , although several promising leads are
already being explored. For example, t h e
m u l t i n ational pharmaceutical company
Glaxo Wellcome has announced it will
supply pregnant HIV- p o s i t i ve women in
d e veloping countries with AZT at 50 to 70

that many people will still be left out.
“The only humanistic policy that can be

they are no more than that. ■

S I G N S O F T H E T I M E S
THE UNESCO COURIER 69
The situation started to change shortly
before the break-up of the Sov i e t
U n i o n .The key event was the aboli-
tion of censorship in 1989 which sparked
off a publishing boom. New co-operatives
joined the 300 stat e - owned publishing com-
p a n i e s , p rinting massive editions (from
50,000 to 100,000 copies) of works by pre-
viously banned authors including Akhma-
t ova ,T s ve t aye va , M a n d e l s t a m , B e r d yaye v
and Solov ye v. Foreign literature publishing
also took off, as large numbers of pirate edi-
tions were published, often of poor quality.
The number of publishing companies rose
to almost 6,000 in 1993, but so many of
them were putting out the same works that
the market was soon flooded.
The first ye a rs of the decade provided a
foretaste of things to come. But perestroika
did not really get into full swing until 1992,
when the first publishing companies we r e
p ri vat i z e d . The state did not relinquish
control over the industry, but set up a kind
of share-holding system in which it could
pull strings while offloading some of its fin a n-
cial bu r d e n .When this happened, the my t h
of the flo u rishing Soviet publishing industry
c o l l a p s e d . Under the old regi m e ,p rint ru n s
of some titles were enormous and tiny for
the rest; e d i t o rial decisions were made arbi-
t r a rily and party literature was gi ven pride of
p l a c e ,a u t o m atically bought by the unions,
sent free of charge to municipal and ru r a l
l i b r a ries and shipped to the people’s republics
of eastern Europe.Those days were ove r.
This first stage showed that publishing
was in a shaky condition. It is true that lack
of market experience and the new economic
s i t u ation were obstacles to profit a b i l i t y.T h e
sudden cuts in state subsidies, the break-
up of the centralized distri bution system,
s o a ring costs of paper,production and ship-
ping dealt a deat h - b l ow to the one-time
giants of Soviet publishing such as Sove t s k y
P i s at e l , M o l o d aya Gva r d ya , P r o gress and
D e t s k aya Literat u r a , which specialized in
books for young people. B e t ween 1990 and
1993 the number of published titles plum-
meted from 41,000 to 29,000 and the num-
ber of copies printed fell from 1.5 billion to
950 million.
The new Russia tried to gi ve publishing
a second chance. A bill relating to publi-
s h e rs ’ and authors ’ rights was passed in
1993, and a federal law concerning aid to
publishing and the media,which provided
for pri vat i z at i o n , tax breaks and other fin a n-
cial incentive s , came into force on 1 Ja n u a ry
1 9 9 6 . This legi s l ation spurred on the pri-
vate sector, which today produces nearly
two-thirds of the books published in Rus-
sia—a total of 420 million copies and more
than 36,000 titles.
An uphill job
But these figures are just one side of the
c o i n . The Russian publishing industry is
still beleaguered by a host of problems, o f t e n
r e l ated to the drop in purchasing powe r.
Russian citizens cannot afford to buy books,
e ven school textbooks.W h at is more, m a ny
local publishers are not in a position to sup-
ply the fragmented market,so that there is
a fla grant imbalance between the country ’s
central regions and the outlying areas, e s p e-
cially Siberia and the Far East.In the cen-
tral areas, the number of books ava i l a b l e
per inhabitant is in the hundreds. On the
p e ri p h e ry, it is less than twe n t y.W h at ’s more,
the January 1996 law is arbitrarily applied
and publishers rarely benefit from the adva n-
tages it offers. E ven public sector publishing
companies are feeling the pinch. In 1996-97,
only twe n t y - five books were published with
state participation.And most of them were
printed to commemorate Moscow’s 850th
anniversary.
For the most part , these aberr at i o n s
penalize small- and medium-sized compa-
n i e s.Large firms are doing quite we l l ,e s p e-
cially if they reach a wide public. S c i e n c e
fic t i o n ,t h ri l l e rs and love stori e s , once almost
impossible to fin d , are best-sellers today.
Demand is rising, especially because these
books cost between 12 and 15 roubles (from
$2 to $2.50, as of 15 June)—the ave r a g e
s a l a ry in Moscow is 1,000 roubles a month
($164) and from 300 to 500 roubles ($49 to
$82) a month elsewhere in Russia.
There is also a flo u rishing market for
c o o k b o o k s , d o - i t - yo u rself books, h e a l t h
Russian publishing is
moving along the bumpy
road to the free market.

companies Eskimo, O l m a - P r e s s ,AST press,
A rmada and Centrp o l i graf in the lead.T h e
best-selling unive rsity textbooks,which cost
an average of 20 roubles,are on law, busi-
ness, finance and information technology.
The main publishing companies in this area,
which include Infra-M, S p a r k , F i n a n cy i
Statisika and Prior, are also in the private
s e c t o r. These new leaders in mass publi-
shing have also solved distri bution problems.
Most of them have their own warehouses,
t r a n s p o rt ation and computerized sales
management systems.
With print runs of 15,000 to 20,000
copies,Vagrius and Terra,the main literary
p u b l i s h e rs , are able to sell their books at
c o m p e t i t i ve prices ranging from 20 to 30
r o u b l e s. They also work with wholesalers
and have an extensive point of sale netwo r k
in Moscow and the regions.
The situation is quite different for publi-
s h e rs such as Sabascnikov, whose print ru n s
are 5,000 copies or less. It is hard for them
to make a profit , especially since their books
are produced in Italy and sold in Russia.A t
50 roubles each, these publishers are hav i n g
a hard time winning market share. S i n c e
their books sell poorly, they cannot start
m a ny new projects and have to make do
with publishing three or four titles a year.
Rethinking 
the book industry
In addition to shipping costs and commis-
sions skimmed off by wholesalers , s m a l l
companies have to cope with the prohibitive
b o rr owing terms laid down by Russian
b a n k s , which charge from 40 to 60 per cent
interest a ye a r.The 17 per cent interest rat e s
of the European Bank for Reconstruction
and Development are attractive, but those
loans are hard to come by.
A u t h o rs are also going through hard
t i m e s.There are no literary agencies in Rus-
s i a , and wri t e rs have as much trouble fin d i n g
a publisher as defending their ri g h t s.This is
t rue even for successful authors like A l e x a n-
der Marinina,who has been dubbed “king
of the thri l l e r ” . B e gi n n e rs are even wo rs e
o f f.L i t e r a ry awards such as the Bouker and
Antibouker prizes usually go to established
authors and publishers.
Where translation is concerned there is
also a lot of catching up to do. Money is the
decisive factor,and publishers favour clas-
sics because they cannot afford to pay copy-
right and promotional costs. Grants from
the Soros Fo u n d ation and France’s Pushkin
p r o gramme have funded new translations of
Togouna week in D j e n n é
The people of Djenné (Mali) will remember Heritage Week for a long time.From 12
to 18 May, decision makers , r e s e a r c h e rs and local representat i ves gathered in the
ancient tow n , which has been on UNESCO’s World Heritage List since 1988, to dis-
cuss ways of preserving its remarkable earthen architecture while taking the residents’
needs into account.“Togouna”week,named after a Dogon concept meaning a place for
dialogue, thought and exchange,was organized by the ministry of culture, sponsored by
Adam Ba Korané,wife of the chief of state and a historian,and chaired by the minister of
culture,Aminata Dramane Traoré.According to Sirandou Bocoum,a representative of a
Djenné wo m e n ’s gr o u p,“Difficult restoration rules are imposed on us.We are not allowe d
to change the present dimensions of our houses, but they are ve ry small.To d ay we need spa-
cious living rooms to entertain guests.The old entrance halls just wo n ’t do any m o r e .A little
m o d e rnity wo n ’t make our architecture any less authentic,” she say s , adding that the ru l e s
are forcing the townspeople to live in a “perpetual ghetto”. Papa Sy, chairman of an orga-
n i z ation called Djenné-Pat rimoine (Djenné-Heri t a g e ) , shares her point of view. “ T h e
main thing,”he say s ,“is to preserve the façades and other aspects of the appearance of our
homes.The rest should be up to the owner to decide.”
Heritage Week participants demanded that restoration projects underway be redesi-
gned to satisfy the townspeople’s needs. But above all, they asked to take part in futu-
re heritage management projects. Making cultural heritage profitable was also discus-
sed during “Togouna” week.To spread the benefits among as many people as possible,
it is necessary to promote local creativity and the development of economic activities
linked to tourism, such as crafts.
Admittedly, that is a tall order. Meanwhile, Djenné’s Heritage Week proved that
people are more likely to accept a  participatory approach to heritage management than
the top-to-bottom decision-making that has been the rule until now. As the minister of
culture said, the aim of preservation is to foster sustainable human development that
combines economics with culture. Bamba Kiabou ■

There is still a long way to go. In future,
Russia’s publishing industry, including the
production and marketing sides,will have to
be totally rethought.A fresh injection of aid
is indispensable,especially for school text-
b o o k s , u n i ve rsity textbooks and librari e s.
Sales and marketing strat e gies must be
r e va m p e d .Marketing centres already exist,
but aesthetically Russian books still leave
much to be desired.The time has also come
to consider co-editions with We s t e rn publi-
shers. ■

THE UNESCO COURIER 71
‘A d ay ’s walk from Imbra-Chri s
there are buildings that to my
mind are unlike any to be seen
e l swhere in the world and in such gr e at num-
b e r.There are churches hewn entirely out of
the living rock, which is sculpted with gr e at
i n g e n u i t y.”Francisco A l va r e z , the chaplain
of an early sixteenth-century Po rt u g u e s e
d i p l o m atic mission to A b y s s i n i a ,h e s i t ated to
say more about the wonders he had beheld
in Lalibela. Had he found the wo r d s , h e
thought,no one would have believed him.
Lalibela is a medieval monastic com-
plex perched at an altitude of 2,700
metres, where the sky meets volcanic rock
t h at solidified as it flowed down the
mountainside. It is a holy city inspired by
a dream, which may explain its airy grace
and the awe visitors feel when they behold
it. Legend has it that King Lalibela was
born in Roha,on the site of the little town
of 10,000 inhabitants which today bears
his name, some 700 kilometres from
Ethiopia’s capital, Addis Ababa. At his
birth, a swarm of bees enveloped him,
thus giving rise to his name, which means
“the bees know he will be great.” During
L a l i b e l a ’s childhood the throne of
Ethiopia was occupied by his brother
who, fearing the oracle’s words would
come tru e , poisoned him. The yo u n g
prince fell into a coma that lasted three
days. This “near-death experience”, as it
would be called today, was regarded as a
miracle. God had Lalibela brought up to
heaven and ordered him to have churches
hewn out of the living rock. In the early
twelfth century, when Christians despai-
red at seeing Jerusalem fall into the hands
of the Muslims, Lalibela came to the
throne and had eleven monolithic
churches carved out of the pink tufa.
French archaeologist Francis A n f r ay,
who has spent thirt y - t wo ye a rs in
E t h i o p i a , s ay s , “This imposing complex of
churches is the only one of its kind in the
wo r l d ,” which is one reason why Lalibela
is on UNESCO’s World Heritage List.
Another is that it’s a living site where 350
p ri e s t s , 250 deacons, 450 monks and 400
students still wo r k , study and wo rs h i p.T h e
r e l i gious services held there have not
changed in 800 ye a rs. E t h i o p i a ’s Ort h o-
d ox Christians consider it a second Holy
L a n d . The local stream is even called the
Jordan and there is a mountain named
Mount Ta b o r. E t h i o p i a ’s leading pilgri m a-
ge site, Lalibela sometimes we l c o m e s
20,000 to 50,000 believe rs at a time, e s p e-
cially during the peak Chri s t m a s , E p i-
p h a ny and Easter seasons. M a ny of them
trek to the complex on foot.
A deteriorating site
The churches have deteriorated over the
centuries, but by and large they have
withstood wars, invasions and the torren-
tial rains that drench the highlands from
June to September. But as the twentieth
century draws to a close, Lalibela’s rock
churches face new threats.They will need
the protection of Egzia Beher, t h e
Ethiopian Christians’ word for God, to
survive the expected wave of tourists.
“The gove rnment wants Lalibela to
attract as many visitors as possible,” says
Jara Haile Mariam, director of cultural
heritage at the culture and information
ministry. The goal is to help offset the
area’s extreme poverty. Tarja Laine, of
Finland, has carried out a detailed study
of the site and co-ordinates a develop-
ment project managed by the Finnida co-
operation agency. “The environment is
extremely eroded,” she says. “It will not
support any more forestry or farming.
Tourism is the only way for the people to
upgrade their living conditions.”
Right now, most of the population
lives below the poverty line and 97 per
Modern tourism is a mixed blessing for an extraordinary complex of medieval churches
hewn from the living rock of the Ethiopian highlands.

cent suffers from malnutrition.The infant
mortality rate is 153 per thousand and 68
per cent of the inhabitants can neither
read nor write. One adult in three is
unemployed and most of the rest eke out
a living selling firewood or as day labou-
rers.The churches are the town’s only real
source of wealth. In addition to the clergy
and students associated with them, they
provide work for those members of the
community who live from the touri s t
trade. An entrance ticket costs 100 birrs
($12) for a non-Ethiopian, which is twice
the monthly wage of half the inhabitants
of Lalibela. A young guide can earn more
in three hours than his father does in a
month! But the site still only draw s
10,000 tourists a year, who spend an ave-
rage of two days there. They complain
about poor sanitation infrastru c t u r e s ,
rude and underqualified guides, harass-
ment from beggars and high admission
prices.
Still, medieval Lalibela is slowly but
surely catching up with the twentieth cen-
tury. Five years ago it was impossible to
reach the medieval complex by road
during the rainy season.A few kilometres
from the centre, an acacia tree still cast its
shade over the single, narrow, red clay
airstrip. Since 1997 a new road has led to
the town, which has a real airport and
telephone service. A development plan
drawn up in 1996 calls for the building of
restaurants, souvenir shops, a museum, a
parking lot,a crafts centre, a post office, a
bank and other amenities. And electricity
is on the way. “But the power plant was
built too close to the churches, and the
cables spoil the scenery,” says Laine. “If
the ministry of culture had been consul-
ted, that mistake would have been avoi-
ded. The problem is, the ministry does
not have enough influence to control
development of the site.” Haile Mariam
says “there is a conflict between conserva-
tion and deve l o p m e n t ” and that the
government bodies in charge of tourism
and planning should be more sensitive to
the preservation of heritage.
“In the long run tourism will kill
Lalibela the same way it killed Mont Saint
Michel in France,” says Anfray. “We must
try to limit the damage.” Pietro Laureano,
an Italian architect working for UNES-
CO, adds, “I worked on the site of Petra
in Jordan. It’s a disaster. Hotels have been
built helter-skelter, even though the tradi-
tional local villages could have accommo-
dated tourists. Lalibela may develop in
the same disorderly way if we don’t give
the inhabitants and tour operators guide-
lines for protecting the perimeter around
the churches.” Mariam is campaigning for
the creation of “satellite villages” but ack-
nowledges that Ethiopia is too poor to
fund new infrastructures.
But the worst-case scenario can still
be avoided. “No irreparable damage has
been done,” Laine says reassuri n g l y.
What’s more, increased tourism could
spur intelligent development of the site.
According to a 1996 study conducted for
Finnida, visitors are overwhelmingly in
favour of protecting the perimeter around
the churches, which they fear will turn
into a “Holy Hollywood.” Sixty per cent
complained about the churches’ p o o r
condition and 83 per cent regret that they
are covered by shelters—sheet metal and
wooden structures that will, it is hoped,
prevent leaks from further damaging the
landmarks until a better solution is found.
“They’ve been talking about restoring the
churches for thirty years,” Anfray says.
“Work financed by an American founda-
tion started under the auspices of UNES-
‘In the long run tourism
will kill Lalibela, just as it
has killed Mont Saint-
Michel in France. We
must try to limit the
damage. ’

CO in 1967.Then the war broke out.The
government didn’t ask for the restoration
campaign to start up again until 1993.”
Political instability and the top-to-bot-
tom reorganization of the country after
the Mengitsu regime fell in 1991 put pre-
servation efforts on hold. Since then,pro-
jects have been designed but they remain
on the drawing board.“Various Ethiopian
a u t h o ri t i e s , the church, the European
Union and UNESCO are all involved in
restoration,” says Anfray. “That adds up
to a heck of a lot of people and organiza-
tions.” Bureaucracy and the Ethiopian
civil war have not been the only stumbling
blocks. After decentralization measures
were implemented in 1995 and 1996,
heritage preservation fell to the federal
ministry of culture, but carrying out the
projects and local planning schemes are
within the province of the region.There is
also interference from the newly created
municipality and the clergy, w i t h o u t
whom nothing can be accomplished in
Lalibela.
M o r e ove r , UNESCO and the
European Commission, both of which are
i nvo l ved in developing Lalibela, h ave
conflicting preservation pri o ri t i e s.
UNESCO cannot afford to restore the
rock churches, and restoration falls outsi-
de the Commission’s sphere. All the
European Commission can do, s ay s
Anastase Zacharas, who is in charge of
the dossier at the European Commission,
is safeguard Ethiopia’s tourist potential.
Conflicting priorities
Europe is going to funnel 4.7 million of the
200 million Ecus it has earmarked for
d e velopment in Ethiopia between 1996
and 2000 largely into the construction of
at t r a c t i ve high-tech shelters to cover the
c h u r c h e s. The process is underway.
Architecture firms around the world have
been invited to tender bids, the winner will
be announced in March 1999 and the
s h e l t e rs will be completed by December
2 0 0 0 . This will leave a million and a half
E c u s , which will be used to carry out stu-
dies on the reasons why the churches and
the trenches that once formed a water drai-
nage network have deteri o r ated and to pay
s p e c i a l i s t s. M e a n w h i l e , UNESCO and the
Ethiopian department of preservation of
cultural heritage would like to see restora-
tion work begi n .Their experts have appro-
ved a pilot project calling for the use of tra-
ditional building methods and unsuccess-
fully tried to include it in the European
U n i o n ’s package. “ We have a lot of money
for the shelters but much less for conserva-
t i o n . There is no choice. It doesn’t make
s e n s e . People have been waiting for ye a rs
for the churches to be repaired.We have to
produce something or we lose credibility,”
Haile  Mariam says regr e t f u l l y.
“Our bureaucratic systems are too
rigid to fund small-scale operations like
pilot projects,” s ays Zacharas, w h o
believes the shelters are a necessary but
temporary evil.“They’ll be able to protect
the churches for ten year s. Then Ethiopia
will have to find the money to fund the
work.” In other words, it won’t be starting
tomorrow. But heaven can wait. . . . ■

‘I f you want to eat an elephant,you can’t
do it in one mouthful,” s ays Noah
S a m a r a .“ You have to eat it bit by bit.”
For the past seven ye a rs ,he has been using this
little-by-little approach to spread digital radio
by satellite around the wo r l d .
With an almost missionary zeal and
dogged skill, M r. Samara heads
Wo r l d s p a c e , a company whose aim is to
b ring the rich man’s radio to an audience of
the poor.The project was initially designed
for A f rica but later expanded to include the
more economically bu oyant countries of
the South.
Worldspace will provide a broad range
of programmes transmitted digitally and by
s at e l l i t e , with CD-quality sound, to four
billion people who live in developing coun-
t ri e s. Each satellite will carry three gr o u p s
of 100 frequencies, making it possible to
transmit around 100 stereo channels. T h i s
is a revolution in regions where the choice
is still ve ry limited (one station for eve ry
30,000 people in North A m e ri c a , c o m p a-
red to just one for eve ry two million in the
Third Wo r l d ) . “ We want to create a show-
case for local cultures,” s ays Samara, a
f o rt y - o n e - year-old A m e rican Muslim of
Sudanese-Ethiopian ori gi n .“ To d ay the sta-
tions of the North dominate the South. B u t
I’m sure amazing things are happening in
K e nya which would interest people in
S e n e g a l , for example.”
The programmes are picked up by
small portable receive rs with a tiny sat e l l i t e
antenna and, b e ginning in the year 2000, a
colour screen for multimedia (wo r d s , p i c-
tures and sound). The receive rs can be
plugged into a personal computer and
r e c e i ve personal messages. Four major
Japanese companies—Hitachi, M at s u s h i t a ,
S a nyo and Victor—recently signed deals to
m a n u facture and sell the devices.
Washington-based Worldspace has rai-

A l c atel and signed launch contracts with
A ri a n e s p a c e . The first satellite will go into
orbit over A f rica in October 1998 and the
t wo others over Asia and Latin A m e rica in
1 9 9 9 .
“The appealing thing about Wo r l d s p a c e
is that they really know how to sell their

is where the future
l i e s ,” s ays Littardi.“ B u t
there are three big question marks. F i rs t , we
c a n ’t be sure of how good reception will be
in urban areas. The signal can be blocked
by bu i l d i n g s , tunnels and so on.Wo r l d s p a c e
s ays there are solutions, such as eart h -
based retransmission of the signal.” But this
would make the system too expensive .
The second, perhaps most import a n t
q u e s t i o n , is whether people will buy the
r e c e i ve rs. “ I t ’s a gamble because all new
technology penetrates the market at the
t o p, in the rich countri e s , and then spreads
d ow n wa r d s , first to the elites in the poor
c o u n t ri e s , and then to the rest of the popu-
l at i o n ,” s ays Littardi. “ Worldspace is try i n g
to do the opposite. It will all depend on the
selling price of the receive rs.”
Samara reckons that the consumer will
h ave to pay about $200 to start with,
“which is an astronomical sum for most
A f ri c a n s. But even if the price never drops,
there are already 300 million households
which can afford it in the area we ’re cove-

Olympus satellite experiment in Europe in
the late 1980s. “ We paid a lot of attention to

Noah Samara — a businessman with
the missionary spirit
Forty-one-year-old Sudanese-Ethiopian businessman Noah Samara spent his childhood in
Ethiopia,a country steeped in mysticism and the place where the idea of African unity took
shape. “The most beautiful childhood memory I have dates back to the early 1960s, when
I was seven. My father took me to the United
Nations Economic Commission for Africa where
the OAU (Organization of African Unity) was
created. Addis Ababa was seething with excite-
ment. Nasser, Nkrumah, Kenyatta, Senghor, all
the giants were there. I remember them planting
trees with Haile Selassie to symbolize African
unity. It’s incredible to think how much hope
there was.”
But then disillusionment set in, and Samara
left Ethiopia to study abroad.“I went to school in
England and the United States and forgot every-
thing.” But he learned new things. “America
taught me not to be afraid of dreams and that
collective will begins with the individual.” To cut
a long story short,living in the United States hel-
ped him ally his desire for personal success with
his childhood dreams. “Doing business is fantas-
tic when you can combine it with doing some-
thing good for society. Many people are convin-
ced that doing good is not compatible with
making money. But I don’t agree.”
Samara had a career with the International
Telecommunications Union before deciding to return to Africa to cure it “of a disease that
is probably more serious than Aids”—the lack of infrastructures that would democratize
access to information. “This situation is unacceptable and has created a vicious circle of
dependence. I feel that an African Renaissance is going to happen and I am convinced that
it will be caused by things like Worldspace. What we want to do is bring about a vertical
globalization of information, affecting not just the elite but going all the way down to
grassroots level. You need a critical mass to make a change. And how do you get a critical
mass? Through mass media.” S. Bou. ■

an estimated seven million people worldwide. Enthusiasts
say this operating system is a refreshing alternative to
commercial software.
least partly protected from market forces.
At stake are the free movement of ideas
and the dynamism of research. “Free soft-
ware is an area of technical wo r k , bu t
a b ove all, it is a matter of ethical philoso-
p hy,” s ays Richard Stallman, an A m e ri c a n
computer pioneer and head of the Free
S o f t ware Fo u n d at i o n .
“Computer pro-
grammes can be nat u-
rally duplicated to infi-
n i t y, like theorems,”
s ays Bernard Lang of
the French Institute
for Computer and
A u t o m ation Research
( I N R I A ) . “But nowa d ays the rules of the
m at e rial world are being imposed on the
i m m at e ri a l . Research is controlled by a few
s o f t ware companies. They use propri e t a ry
s t a n d a r d s and fo rm at s, which nobody
u n d e rs t a n d s , to cling to their monopoly. A s
a result, they are forced to constantly chan-
ge their products before other companies
figure out how they’re made. This control
over standards kills competition and fetters
c r e at i v i t y, whereas freeware is a source of
constant innovat i o n .”
Linux proves the point. Available free
of charge on the Intern e t , it is part of cy b e-
r h u m a n i t y ’s shared heri t a g e .The progr a m-
me uses public stan-
d a r d s , is close to the
Unix operating system
and works equally we l l
on a Mac or a PC and
e ven on slower compu-
t e rs. Linux meets three
f r e e ware cri t e ri a . I t s
source code is ava i l a b l e ,
so anyone can take part in developing it or
can modify it to suit their needs; it can be
freely copied and redistri bu t e d ; and anyo-
ne can improve it, as long as they make the
source code for the changes available to
e ve ryo n e .
“Linux isn’t just one big entity,” s ay s
R o b e rt Yo u n g, president of Redhat
S o f t wa r e , an A m e rican firm that distri-
butes the product. “ I t ’s a collection of lots
of little part s. Each has its own team of
p r o gr a m m e rs on the Internet and a team
leader who approves or rejects the altera-
tions suggested. And the ultimate boss is
To rva l d s.”
Linux enthusiasts, most of them engi-
n e e rs and science students, u n a n i m o u s l y
laud the product. “ I t ’s quick, compact and

companies turning to Linux? Because it
d o e s n ’t crash and it works ve ry we l l . A n d
w hy is it so good? Because it has the wo r l-
d ’s biggest team of software engi n e e rs who
are constantly improving it, just for the
l ove of it.” T h at ’s the spirit of the cy b e r-
c o m m u n i t y. “Free software is a communi-
ty project and eve ryone who depends on it
ought to look for ways to contri bute to
building the community,” s ays Stallman.
People who work on it don’t make money
but they do earn a reputation—not such a
bad deal. To rvalds was an unknown stu-
dent in Helsinki. Because of Linux, e ve ry
firm in Silicon Valley wanted to hire him
when he gr a d u at e d .To d ay he is working at
Tr a n s m e t a , a new A m e rican high-tech

Another big advantage Linux offers is
efficient “ a f t e r - gi ve away serv i c e .” “If yo u
h ave a problem,” s ays Roure, “ you log on
to a discussion group and even at two in
the morning you’ll always find someone
who knows someone who has an answe r.
I t ’s free and takes 20 minutes. If there’s a
hacker at t a c k , for example, the group will
tell you ‘ h e r e ’s how to defend yo u rs e l f.’ I t ’s
i nva l u a b l e . With commercial softwa r e ,
yo u ’re completely at
the company ’s mercy
and it may be we e k s
before you get an ans-
we r.”
Another fan is
L e c t r a - S y s t è m e s , t h e
wo r l d ’s leading com-
puter-assisted textile
m a n u fa c t u r e r , which recently started using
L i n u x . “The system is generally popular
with our customers ,” s ays Pierre Ficheux,
a senior exe c u t i ve with the company,
“especially the ones who don’t know any-
thing about computers and think it’s
W i n d ow s ! ” With no head office, no stock
exchange quotation and no adve rt i s i n g
v i s i b i l i t y, Linux makes some people feel
u n e a s y. “ We don’t use Microsoft much,
but we ’ ve kept it to reassu-
re our customers ,” s ay s
R o u r e . “ People think any-
thing that ’s free must be

L i n u x ’s main draw-
back is its complexity.
“Most computer-illiterat e

according to Roure. “ I t ’s still pri m a ri l y
used for complex applications like setting
up network serve rs or for simulat i o n . B y
the way, it was used to create most of the
special effects in Ti t a n i c.”
Young explains, “Most companies
want a specific application—for example a
firm of architects wants a drawing pro-
gramme—and only afterwards bother
about what operating system it uses. L i n u x
has far fewer applications than W i n d ow s
and that ’s the main problem. But it’s only
been in professional use since 1995 and
things are changing ve ry quickly.”
The outlook for Linux is bri g h t . A
number of pri vate firms are starting to live
off it. They are prospering and creat i n g
jobs by offering Linux users services for a
f e e . A case in point is Redhat Softwa r e ,
with 40 employees and a $6 million turn o-
ve r in 1997, a figure expected to rise to $10
million this ye a r. Founded in 1995, R e d h at
specializes in custom-made systems and
sells Linux on a CD-ROM updated eve ry
six months. “ We ’re playing with 450 pro-
gr a m m e s ,” s ays Yo u n g, “including com-
mercial software compatible with Linux.
We put it together according to our custo-
m e rs ’ needs and set an
overall framewo r k . I n
1997 we had 150,000
c u s t o m e rs , 80,000 of
them in the U. S . a n d
50,000 in Europe. O u r
C D - ROM costs $50, o r
nothing if you dow n-
load it from the
I n t e rn e t , which is what most of our two
million or so users do.”
So why pay? “ I t ’s like asking people
who buy bottled water why they don’t
d rink it out of the tap. The answer is that
they don’t trust it.We ’re also selling simple
i n s t a l l ation as well as trouble-shooting in
case of a problem.”
Young is keeping a cool head under his
red hat . The battle against the Microsoft
empire has not been wo n
ye t . “So far they have n ’t
caused us any trouble,”
he say s. “ T h at ’s a bad
s i g n . They see us as an

t h r e atening experi m e n t .
We get far more new cus-
t o m e rs from Unix than

78 THE UNESCO COURIER
■ You’re a star of African music. But is
there such a thing as African music?
There are countless kinds of music in
Africa. Every region has its own traditio-
nal sounds. Then there’s modern African
music, which combines local and foreign
influences, and that’s what I’m part of.
The two currents inspire each other.
Traditional music is more vibrant when
m o d e rn perform e rs make use of its
potential and variety.
■ What does music mean to you?
It’s a kind of natural force. Especially in
Africa, where there’s something musical
in the air, in people’s bodies, in the way
they move. Africans don’t read much.
They listen. And they listen with their
bodies. The first thing about a song is its
rhythm. But you can use its power to
convey a message, to express commit-
ment or to make people happy.
■ How do you write your songs?
Fifteen or twenty of my compositions
came naturally.The rest I had to work on.
To write them, I shut myself away and
concentrate on a single topic. Today I
must say that Africa has never been so
ready to assert itself on the world stage.
The head of the United Nations is an
African. African culture is like a moving
train. Its locomotive is music which can
produce universal melodies.
■ How did you come to World Music?
Gradually. I started out when I was thir-
teen, singing with friends.Then I was in a
more modern group, which played tradi-
tional music on modern instru m e n t s.
That way I got to play in nightclubs in
Dakar.Then my music took off. It started
travelling and I was invited to follow it.As
I listened to other kinds of sounds,
through meeting stars like Peter Gabriel,
I came up with a new form of expression.
■ What obstacles have you encountered
in the course of your career?
At first my father was against it. He said
people looked down on musicians and he
was afraid that might rub off on him. He
didn’t want to see me drinking or taking
drugs. In my country, the relationship
between parents and children is heavily
influenced by tradition and Islam. Even
after the age of twenty, children must
obey their fathers. I was very young and I
did a deal with mine: I’d behave myself
totally as long he let me be a musician. I
also thank God and my father for giving
me good health and enabling me to be a
role model for young people. But I don’t
condemn people who drink or smoke
dope. Some of them are very talented.
■ Many African musicians live in Western
countries, but you don’t. What keeps
you in Senegal?
My family, in the broadest sense of the
word. Not just my wife and children. A
family is really something. I’ve agreed to
take over from my father and keep an eye
on everything and everyone.That’s what
Youssou N’Dour
A f r i c a ’s world musician
The rise of a s t a r
With his round face, slender physique and
deceptively adolescent appearance, 39-year-
old Youssou N’Dour seems younger than his
age.
Even though his mother was a singer, a
future as a star of “world music” was hardly
on the cards for a boy born in a poor district
of Dakar, Senegal.His dream was to become
a footballer.
His father, a mechanic, gave him a strict
upbringing and wanted young Youssou to be
a model child,like his 20 brothers and sisters.
N’Dour, whose schooling went as far as
secondary level, managed to convince him
that it was possible to be a musician without
becoming a juvenile delinquent. In 1979,
when he was 20, he formed his own group,
l’Etoile de Dakar (which became Le Super
Etoile in 1981) and created his own style of
music, Mbalax, from the name of a traditio-
nal Wolof dance.
It took him 15 years to win international
recognition. This came in 1986 when he
caught the attention of Peter Gabriel.
Through Gabriel,N’Dour got to know a num-
ber of famous English-language singers who
introduced him to the state-of-the-art tech-
nology of the major recording studios.
In 1989 N’Dour really reached the top in
world music with his album The Lion, and
then went on to work with pop stars like
Neneh Cherry, with whom he shared a gold
disc in 1994 for their song Seven Seconds.
Twenty-six years after he started singing,
N’Dour is the author of 115 songs. His fame
spread even wider when his song La Cour des
Grands was chosen as the official anthem for
the 1998 World Cup. But he has always kept
his feet on the ground and keeps a cool head
even when talking about issues like racism,
drugs or poverty. He discusses them with the
same gentleness found in his songs.
S. A. O. ■
A leading figure in World Music, Senegal’s Youssou N’Dour
wants to use his success to aid humanitarian causes and
encourage the development of talented young African
musicians.

keeps me at home. Pe r f o rm e rs leave
Senegal because there’s nothing there to
help them fulfil their potential. This has
made me want to change things. But I can
go whenever I want to. There’s an airport
in Dakar and you don’t need an exit visa
to leave.
■ You bring the people around you into
your creative universe. How do you
reconcile loyalty to friends with the
need for quality?
I started from nothing. Just me and a few
musicians. I really had to talk them into
forming a group. At the time, everyone
was afraid people would look down on
them. Relatives and friends were the first
people to join me.Then other people did.
But first and foremost I’m a professional.
When someone has to be fired I don’t
hesitate, whether it’s a member of my
family or not. It’s all in the way you go
about it. For example, if someone in my
studio isn’t getting anywhere, I tell them
to go and work with the sound techni-
cians. They soon get fed up and leave of
their own accord.
■ What are you doing to encourage
artistic creativity in Senegal?
I started a record label, Gololi, which in
Wolof means the bells which horses have
round their necks. It works with the stu-
dio I have in Dakar, called Xipi (“open
eyes” in Wolof).The label produces seven
artists a year and their work is distributed
in Senegal and internationally through
our partners, foreign record companies
which have faith in us.That’s how Cheikh
Lo, a Senegalese musician I produced,
was launched.The critics have given him
rave reviews, and World Circuit is distri-
buting him successfully. I’m also working
so that one day Senegalese can take over
the recording and technical side of their
music. At the moment, we’re 90-per-cent
dependent on Westerners. That’s not a
bad thing in itself but local professionals
can do better because they know the lan-
guage and understand our music more
quickly. So I organize training sessions,
sometimes pay for courses in Paris and
take young people on tour abroad. About
80 per cent of the professional performers
in Dakar today started out with me.
■ Do you think governments should help
encourage artistic creation?
The state should protect the rights of
artists but let creativity develop freely.
Pirating is a plague in Africa. Performers
can’t make a living from their own work.
At least half my songs are copied in
Senegal and up to 80 per cent elsewhere
in Africa. Governments should fight that
by strengthening and enforcing copyright

laws. At the moment, if a guy is caught
bringing an illegal truckload of pirated
cassettes into Senegal, weeks go by before
they can be confiscated. By that time, he’s
sold them.
■ Why aren’t you involved in distribution?
You can’t do everything—write, produce,
manufacture and distribute as well. The
traditional outlets are there, especially in
the markets. They shouldn’t be destroyed
but built up with organization.
■ Do you promote new talent by working
with other African stars to co-ordinate
efforts across the continent?
Indirectly. But there isn’t much co-opera-
tion. Performers can only help by finding
backers at government level. Then it’s a

a teenager is having work done on it and is for the moment uninhabited.
A childhood friend, A.N., says: “Youssou N’Dour is from here. As a child, all he knew was the
Medina.” With a hint of nostalgia in his voice, he recalls long hours spent drinking tea together, playing
football or performing with the Khandrang Jazz band,formed at the end of the 1960s with a group of
friends whom the future star introduced to singing. They accompanied him on castanets.
Hardly anything is left of those days. As he became famous, the singer stopped seeing his “real”
friends of old,says A.N.,hastening to add that this is because “You”,N’Dour’s nickname in these parts,
has “bad advisers.” But,he says, “he’s a good guy and if he came by in his car, he’d stop and say hello
to me.”

Almadies, near Yoff airport.“But we’d love it if he
dropped by,” says one woman,obviously proud of
the singer’s success.
Another local, Aziz, says that if “You” was
more visible, the fans would not run after him so
much. Aziz, who has a degree in management
from a European university and was a playmate of
N’Dour’s, says the singer is warm-hearted, but
complains that he has not used his wealth to do
anything to help relieve the Medina’s chronic
youth unemployment problem.
Abdoulaye Camara is permanent secretary of
“Harmony and Initiative in the Medina” (Cime),
an association set up last year after a suggestion
made by N’Dour, its president. He sees things
quite differently. “He comes to three-quarters of
our meetings and if he can’t make it he always
lets us know,” he says. Camara is proud that many
people are keen to fund the activities of “You’s”
association. The singer, his hero, is “manna for the
Medina,” he says.
An onlooker adds that everyone in the
Medina is fond of N’dour because of his “modes-
ty, efficiency, kindness and sense of friendship.”
True or false? Aziz the young professional who
wants “You” to do something specific,had never
heard of the association and says when asked
about its impact that he’ll “believe it when he
sees it.”

THE UNESCO COURIER 81
matter for ministers of culture, who have
to push through laws and make sure
they’re in line with regulations set up by
i n t e rn ational bodies such as the
Organization of African Unity.There’s no
point in passing a law in Senegal if there
isn’t one in Mali.
■ Is there a balanced relationship
between artists from countries of the
South and the labels in the North?
Even though I’m with Sony, I think major
record companies have failed, in spite of
the big investments they’ve made in
African music over the past decade.They
interfere with the creat i ve process by
trying to push modern songs instead of
helping artists to do their creative best.
They’re like banks—if you’re not profi-
table, they drop you. I learned that lesson
the hard way when Virgin dumped me.
They expected me to sell as well as Peter
Gabriel or Phil Collins, two of their stars.
I sold a quarter of a million discs but it
wasn’t enough.They wanted a million.
■ Is there an alternative to this system?
We have to create A f rican recording
labels. Bob Marley reached the whole
world because he got help at home, in
Jamaica. Our music must be created in
Africa, but we musn’t stop travelling,
meeting other artists and listening to
other sounds. My dream is to change the
system. When my contract with Sony
expires in about five years time, after I’ve
made the three albums I owe them, I’ll
come back to my own label and cut a sales
deal with Sony. Whatever happens, you
have to stick with an international label if
you want to get distributed.
■ You campaign for humanitarian causes,
including the fight against poverty.
Where do you start in Africa?
By communicating. Everyone must have
the right to voice an opinion—the poor,
the rich, the middle class. They don’t
know each other and their paths never
cross. I want to use my music to bring
them together. I perform everywhere—
from city suburbs to the poorest villages.
When there’s no electricity, we make do
with a generator to try and put on as good
a show as we would in Paris. Artists have
power and should use it to get their mes-
sages across.
■ Which is more important, working at
the grassroots or at the international
level?
They go together. At first, I was encoura-
ged to work with organizations like UNI-
CEF, for which I’m a “goodwill ambassa-
dor,” and Amnesty International. They
opened my eyes.You see your own coun-
try clearer when you’re far away. Working
with these organizations gave me the idea
of setting up an association in the neigh-
bourhood where I was born, the Medina,
a wonderful ragbag of contradictions.
Like my music.
■ But you left to live in a smarter part of
town.
I live in A l m a d i e s , but my heart ’s still in the
M e d i n a . I go back there ve ry often, my
best friends live there and there’s no reason
to think I wo n ’t return to live there one
d ay.
■ How does your organization work?
I contribute 250,000 CFA francs (about
$420) a year.We started out with an exhi-
bition to help young people to get to
know the neighbourhood’s history and
problems. We’d like to see the local archi-
tecture more in line with the Medina’s

needs. Meanwhile, we’re tackling the rub-
bish problem by organizing set setal days,
when everyone joins in cleaning up—
sweeping up and painting bright murals
over anti-government graffiti.
■ You’re a political fireman, then. Don’t
you think opposition is necessary?
Neighbourhood walls aren’t the best
place to protest against the government.
It’s better to do that through politics.
■ You even endorsed Ibrahim Bare
Mainassara’s January 1996 coup in
Niger by giving a concert there two
months later. Why?
I wanted to help calm things down, to
make the people of Niger smile again. I’m
dead against any kind of violence. It’s bet-
ter to have an illegal government than
civil war.
■ You campaign for human rights, yet
you’re in favour of polygamy. Isn’t there
a contradiction there?
I’m a practising Muslim and Islam allows
polygamy. Anyway, is it really a denial of
human rights?
■ It’s against equality between the sexes.
Are you in favour of polyandry?
No. Anyway, for the moment I’ve only got
one wife. But I believe religion comes
before all else.
■ Even human rights?
Yes and no. Polygamy aside, I’m in favour
of human rights. I’m against female cir-
cumcision and believe in the emancipa-
tion of women. But I also think women
should remain the guardians of African
values, like family harmony.
■ People say you’re a multi-millionaire. Is
that in CFA francs or dollars?
I’ve worked hard.But I don’t measure my
success in terms of money. Instead I try to
make it an example for other Africans to
follow. I reinvest some of my fortune to
help them along that path. The World
Cup song will bring in a lot of money.
Some of it can be used to fund a large-
scale humanitarian effort in A f ri c a .
Several associations are working on that.
Nothing’s decided yet, but I’d like to
extend my activities to this kind of thing
in Africa. We need it, don’t you think? ■
Interview by Sophie Boukhari 
and Seydou Amadou Oumarou
Birth of a myth
Youssou N’Dour’s talent and charisma are not
enough to explain his international success. H i s
breakthrough on the pop scene, which took
place at the same time as World Music wa s
catching on in the West during the 1980s, i s
partly the result of a non-stop communications
e f f o r t . “His press attachés have succeeded in
positioning him in the place he deserves,” s a y s
François Belorgey, former director of the Fr e n c h
cultural centre in Dakar. “He was already tre-
mendously popular at home.”
The singer soon “realized how necessary it
is to cultivate a commitment compatible with
his artistic intelligence,” says Senegalese uni-
versity teacher Ousmane Diakhaté. He was ins-
pired by musicians like Peter Gabriel, a human
rights activist. His sensibility did the rest. H i s
appeal is based on the “ s i n c e r i t y ” of his huma-
n i t a r i a n i s m , says Mr. B e l o r g e y.
His attachment to his country’s culture and
his climb to the top of the charts have made
him a role model for local young people, a d d s
M r. B e l o r g e y. They can identity with the soft-
s p o ken native of the Medina, a poor Dakar
n e i g h b o u r h o o d . That is explained, M r.D i a k h a t é
s a y s, by “the need for a myth” which appears
in times of  crisis, when people want to be
r e a s s u r e d . S. A . O. ■
