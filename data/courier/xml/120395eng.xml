They come from the hills of the Philippines, the offices of Silicon
Valley, the Andean cordillera and the fishing villages of India. But
despite their different agendas, these groups have found common
ground and given birth to a worldwide social movement that has
stayed in the limelight since Seattle. Who are these new citizens
making their voices heard on both the local and global stage? Do
they have a viable alternative to unfettered,free-market
globalization?  What stands behind their call for “democratic
world governance”?

A PIROUETT E
A ROUND POVERTY
◗ Photos by Richard Emblin, text by Oscar Collazos
Two enthusiastic and seasoned choreographers open new horizons for underprivileged children
in Cartagena by introducing them to modern dance
◗ Richard Emblin is a Canadian photographer 
living in Colombia.
Oscar Collazos is a Colombian writer and columnist
who has written some 20 books. His most recent works
published in Spanish include Goodbye to the Virgin
(1994) and Dying with Dad (1997). An earlier book,
Young, Poor Lovers was published in English (Aims
International Books, 1983).

A l varo Restrepo, a Colombian dancer
and choreogr a p h e r , could have pur-
sued his career anywhere in the
world—in New Yo r k , where he was trained,
or in Europe, where he first made his mark.
But in 1993, he decided to sacri fice all this to
introduce modern dance to Colombia—
where the discipline was barely know n — a n d
to teach it to disadvantaged children bet-
ween 10 and 15 ye a rs old. He teamed up
with Marie-France Delieuvin, p r o gr a m m e
director at the National Centre for Modern
Dance in A n g e rs , F r a n c e , and their joint
e n d e avour has produced astonishing results.
In 1997, four ye a rs after sowing the
seeds of the new art form in Bogotá and

Restrepo and Delieuvin’s bridge is two -
way. It has led a pair of dedicated perfor-

most wretched slums, while also linking the
project to professionals in Europe and

Cartagena. He eventually ended up with a
smaller group of 90 young dancers stri v i n g
to hone their skills in a discipline that tou-
ched the ve ry roots of their cultural and
p e rsonal identity. After a few months,
through a kind of natural selection that left
only those determined to take part in a
c r e at i ve project, 22 of the children quali-
fied for membership in the Experi m e n t a l
Troupe of the Academy of the Body.They
were crossing the bri d g e , t r avelling from
one side of the river to the other.
From outcasts
to performers
D ri ven on by their pove rty sticken
b a c k gr o u n d s , the chosen boys and gi r l s —
n ow more mat u r e ,with deeper voices and
changed bodies—are often tempted to
shirk off school to rehearse their new
dance projects eve ry d ay in the beautiful
colonial-era cloisters of the 16th-century
San Francisco conve n t , leant especially to
the troupe by a religious foundat i o n . I t s
w i d e , empty court yard is flanked by the
Centennial Park and the city’s modern
c o nvention centre, while the old neigh-
bourhood of Getsemaní lies just behind.
Without the free classes at the A c a d e my,
these children—most of whom come from
the city’s Nelson Mandela neighbourhood,
home to families forcibly displaced by
C o l o m b i a ’s civil wa r — would continue
living like outcasts, scraping through life.
But in the three short years the Academy
has been around,they have become teena-
g e rs and gr own from average pupils in out-
lying schools to performers of an art form,
m o d e rn dance, which once seemed remote
and inaccessible. The children have also
come to understand that they could lead
c r e at i ve live s , e ver since Restrepo, w i t h
unshakeable faith and endurance, arrived
in their midst and began mounting shows
with them that have started to attract public
acclaim.

Besides training its members , the El
Puente troupe has also attained high
professional standards, while some for-
mer members have become dance tea-
c h e rs in their own ri g h t . The nat u r a l ,
almost inborn Caribbean sense of rhy t h m
has produced dancers imbued with a pos-
sibly more abstract and certainly more
symbolic way of expression, yet one which
u l t i m ately springs from the gr e at tradi-
tions of modern dance.
Tours
and troubles
With meagres resources and a make-
shift organization patched up by the
u n fla g ging enthusiasm of teachers and stu-
dents alike, the A c a d e my of the Body has
staged two arts festivals in Cart a g e n a , i n
1998 and 1999, and presented three of its
own show s.The troupe has also at t e n d e d
f e s t i vals in Colombia and Europe.
After their performances abroad, i n-
cluding one that took them to Pa ris in
A p ril 2000 and gave them a chance to
m a rvel at wealth they could not dream of,
the children returned to the pove rty of
their tiny homes to grapple once more
with life in the slums. But this time they
came back with the confidence of
h av i n g s t a rted to do something special in
t h e i r l i ve s.
It hasn’t all been a bed of roses. D e s p i t e
the support of public bodies and pri vat e
firm s , money problems still loom over the
A c a d e my. But the iron will of Restrepo
and Delieuvin is rooted in a dream, o n e
t h at often ove rrides the reality that sha-
ped it. The dream lives on because tea-
c h e rs and students in Cartagena seem to
u n d e rstand that the rewards of pers i s t e n c e
are mightier than the pull of despair. ■

How can the ecological balance of Venice be reconciled with the demands of industry? Is the highly
controversial construction of mobile floodgates the solution? The decision will be made by 20 01
◗ Italian journalist, editor in chief of the magazine
Airone
■
The traveller to Venice should arri ve
at the end of a summer’s aftern o o n
to see the sun turn into a huge red
disk and swell until it casts the lagoon’s
f u rthest islands in a fie ry glow before sin-
king into the sea.T h e n , when the last tou-
rist has left Saint Mark’s Square,Ve n i c e
once again becomes magi c a l . In streets
t h at are empty at last, the inhabitants of
the wo r l d ’s most beautiful city open their
d o o rs , letting the few lingering visitors
c atch a glimpse of a time-wo rn , h i s t o ry -
laden monumental staircase, or a hidden,
tree-shaded garden where Giacomo Casa-
n ova may have awaited one of his mis-
tresses two and a half centuries ago. It is
the moment when the souvenir shop signs
go dark and the Ve n e t i a n s ’w i n d ows light

Each day, they are fewer and older. I n
1 9 5 1 , about 175,000 people lived on one
of the 118 islands connected by 160 canals
which form the historic centre of Ve n i c e .
In 1998, a mere 68,000 remained, a n d
t h at figure will likely drop to 40,000 by
2 0 0 5 . If students are not counted—they
are lodged by landlords who do not
declare them to avoid paying taxe s —

The Venetians are leav i n g, and they

vision network) and the banks. To u ri s t s ,

c h u r c h e s , c o nve n t s , m o n a s t e ri e s , p a l a c e s
and bordellos is turning into a huge eat i n g
p l a c e . From 1976 to 1991, the number of
p i z z e ri a s , restaurants and hotels increased
by 144 per cent.
Confronting the sea
with picks and shovels
Will Venice gr ow old and die like its
inhabitants? T h at is any b o d y ’s guess: t h e
t ruth is hard to come by in this labyri n-
thine city.Venice is the city of “ p e r h a p s ,”
as unstable as the lagoon’s ecologi c a l
b a l a n c e . It is impossible to imagine the
city without its lagoon, an uncert a i n
s p a c e , neither land nor sea, whose ve ry
name expresses absence: l a c u n a is Lat i n
for “ l a c k .” This precarious and prov i-
sional place emerged little by little as the
ri ve rs , t o rrents and streams that flow
across the plains on their way to the
A d ri atic deposited millions of cubic
metres of silt.
The lagoon is not part of the sea; it is
s e p a r ated from the A d ri atic by 50 kilo-
metres of sandbars that end with the
mouths of the Lido, Malamocco and
C h i o g gia port s. E ve ry six hours , the tides
run through the bars , flowing in as salt
water and receding as bri ny wat e r. Like a
gigantic lung made up of thousands of
bronchial tubes, the lagoon breat h e s. It is
not only formed by islands high enough to
stand up to the sea’s equinox tides.B a r e n e,
the sandbars that emerge at low tide, a r e
complex ecosystems, home to plants and
animals which have adapted to this
e nvironment oscillating between air and
wat e r.Ve l m e are the mud-flats visible at low
tide while g h e b i are channels that are
green with mire and seaweed through
which the water leaves the lagoon at low
t i d e .
The lagoon was bound to disappear
u n t i l , one day, a group of bold men
decided to make something solid out of an
unstable mass.T h e n , from one generat i o n
the next, the Venetians battled the ele-
ments like funambulists walking a tight-
r o p e . Prepared with shovels and picks to
confront the sea’s efforts to upset the
d e l i c ate equilibri u m , they had only one
thing in mind: to preserve the existence
and richness of Ve n i c e , the city of stone
and marble that they built on spongy
m a rs h l a n d , as if it were on t e rra firm a.
Venice was a utopia: the wo r l d ’s most
f r a gile city, but powerful enough to rule a
fa r - flung empire.
Those stubborn people started by
d rying out the land, d i g ging canals and
d e v i ating ri ve rs. For example, as part of a
huge project begun in 1501 and com-
pleted two centuries lat e r , they changed
the course of the lagoon’s three main
wat e r way s : the Sile, the Piere and the
B r e n t a . T h e n , and with increasing
f r e q u e n cy, they launched major public
and pri vate building projects to furt h e r
t h e civil and military development of
t h e “most serene republic.” These pro-
j e c t s enabled merchant vessels and
wa rships boasting the biggest drafts of
their time to enter the harbour or the
A rs e n a l .
“Although with each project the tech-
nology became  more aggr e s s i ve than the
simple shovels and picks of the early day s ,
these interventions have always gi ven the
lagoon enough time to develop a new
b a l a n c e ,” s ays Stefano Boat o, professor of
city planning at the Unive rsity of Ve n i c e .
The same was true during the operat i o n s
c a rried out in the second half of the 19th
c e n t u ry, when Venice was defin i t i vely inte-
gr ated into the Kingdom of Italy (1866)
after changing hands several times bet-
ween France and A u s t ri a .
It was not until much lat e r , b e t we e n
1952 and 1969, t h at the city was dealt its
h a rshest blow. A straight, 15-metre deep
canal was dug so that oil tankers could
b e rth at the industrial port of Marghera.
At the same time, highly polluting che-
mical and petrochemical plants were bu i l t
across the lagoon, pumping more and
more water out of the aquifers and pou-
ring more and more poison into the wat e r.
“At that time, the delicate balance that
had always existed, and that Ve n e t i a n s
had always managed to maintain ove r 1 9
c e n t u ries of interacting with nat u r e , wa s
b r o k e n . The situation is becoming alar-
m i n g,” s ays Boat o.
Aquatic highways for
tankers and tourists
The lagoon, a unique ecosystem
f o rmed of fresh wat e r , b rine and salt
wat e r , is inexorably turning into an arm of
the sea in its central portion and a swa m p
around the edges. D u ring the time of the
r e p u b l i c, it was forbidden to dig canals
more than four metres deep. To d ay, t h e r e
are ve ritable aquatic highways ove r
2 0 metres deep. Oil tankers , f r e i g h t e rs
and powerful speedboats that can carry
hundreds of tourists create waves that
d e s t r oy the sandbars and mud-flat s , a n d
cancel out the natural movements that
once slowed down the advancement of
the tides.
All these disruptions increase the
erosion that is ruining the depths of the
lagoon and eating away at the founda-
Life goes on: when the waters rise, the temporary footbridges are brought out.

tions of bu i l d i n g s. The Venezia Nuova
C o n s o rt i u m , a group of public and pri vat e
companies which the Italian Public Wo r k s
M i n i s t ry and Ve n i c e ’s Water Depart m e n t
h ave put in charge of carrying out pre-
s e rvation work in the lagoon, s ays that
1 . 2 million cubic metres of soil are wa s h e d
away each ye a r , while the province of
Venice puts the figure at four million.
The mussel fis h e rmen who “ wo r k ” t h e
floor of the lagoon using a fishing method
t h at is outlawed but tolerated also contri-
bute to the erosion.
To make mat t e rs wo rs e , fishing zones
s u rrounded by dikes limit the tides’ a r e a
of expansion.Twenty ye a rs (1950-1970)
of pumping subterranean water lowe r e d
the city’s ground level by 10 centimetres.
L a s t l y, the A d ri atic is ri s i n g, wo rsening the
floods to which the city and the surr o u n-
ding area fall victim.
As a result, in 1990 Venice was 23
centimetres lower than in 1908. F u rt h e r-
m o r e , b e t ween 1965 and 1995, the Ve n e-
tians “ f o r g o t ” to clean the city’s canals, a
practice that their ancestors considered
indispensable for reasons both physical (to
i m p r ove the circulation of tidewater) and
hy gienic (to wash out accumulated wa s t e ) .
The neglect has proven costly. On the
one hand,Venice is beleaguered by over 50
d ays a year of acqua alta (“high wat e r ” ) ,
which floods many of the streets and
s q u a r e s. On the other, with increasing
f r e q u e n cy the tides are so low that ve s s e l s
can no longer sail on the canals.
Hard work for
meagre results
On November 4, 1 9 6 6 , a gi g a n t i c
acqua alta entirely submerged Venice and
the lagoon’s islands for 24 hours , c a u-
sing tremendous damage to the city’s eco-
n o my and art wo r k s , and sending a wave
of panic around the wo r l d . If the wat e r
had risen a little higher, the wo r l d ’s most
beautiful city might have been lost. A n d
the flooding could reoccur at any time!
The shock triggered countless initiat i ve s :
Italian and intern ational commissions
were set up, studies conducted, l aw s
passed and projects proposed. M a j o r
i n t e rn ational bodies went on the alert ,
UN E S C O chief among them. The organi-
z ation moved its office for science and
technology in Europe to Venice and
u n d e rtook the grandiose “Project Ve n i c e ,”
an initiat i ve that has gi ven rise to a pro-
fusion of studies and meetings to pore
over all the problems of the city and its
l a g o o n : geology and morp h o l o g y, t h e
wat e r ’s dynamics, chemical and biolo-
gical processes, c o n t a m i n at i o n , d e m o-
gr a p h i c s , traffic and cleaning up the
c a n a l s.
No other city in the world has been
studied in such detail. None has been so
painstakingly dissected to determine the
reasons for its rise and fa l l .A n d , it must
be added, n e ver has so much hard wo r k
produced such meagre results.
All things considered, and at the ri s k
of ove rs i m p l i f y i n g, this complicated bu s i-
ness can be summed up in two sentences.
They are written in bu r e a u c r atic jargon in
l aw 798, the most important piece of
l e gi s l ation concerning Venice passed since
the 1966 flo o d . The first sentence say s
t h at the work to save Venice must “ r e s t o r e
the hy d r o g e o l o gical equilibrium of the
l a g o o n ,s l ow down and reve rse the process
of degr a d ation and eliminate its causes.”
In other wo r d s , e ve rything must be
done to clean up the canals and to restore
their depth to acceptable levels (other
l aws specify 12 metres), to re-open the
fishing lagoons, and to recreate the sand-
b a rs and mud-flat s. But a harm l e s s - s o u n-
ding sentence in the same law specifie s
t h at all these operations must be carri e d
out while “ p r e s e rving the area’s produc-
t i ve and economic interests.”
In other wo r d s , the bottoms of the
canals must be raised but oil tankers must
not be prevented from travelling through
t h e m , the size of the lagoon’s harbours
must be reduced but the current level of
t r a f fic must be maintained, the tidal swe l l s
must be contained but vessels must be
a l l owed to continue carrying swa rms of
t o u rists to the islands of Torcello and
M u r a n o. The law ’s authors seem to be
the direct heirs to the play w right Carlo
Goldoni and his Harlequin who serve d
t wo masters.
The system of mobile dikes and flo o d-
g ates planned as a solution has been a
bone of contention for nearly 20 ye a rs ,
setting off many debates and discussions
b e t ween engi n e e rs and politicians. It is
called MO S E, the Italian name for Moses
and an acronym that stands for M o d u l o
S p e rimentale Elettromeccanico, a prototype
flo o d g ate that was tested in the Tr e p o rt i
canal between 1988 and 1992. After ye a rs
of studies and numerous va ri at i o n s ,P r o-
ject Moses was adopted by the Ve n e z i a
N u ova Consort i u m .The plan is to equip
the entrances of the Lido, C h i o g gia and
Malamocco ports with a system of mobile
flo o d g at e s : chests that are 20 metres wide,
20 to 30 metres high and four to five
metres deep.
In normal conditions and as long as
the tide’s amplitude does not exceed one
m e t r e , the wat e r - filled chests will lie on the
floor of the canal.When the tide is dubbed
“ e x c e p t i o n a l ” (an average of seven a ye a r
and 20 in 1996), a hydraulic system will
fill the chests with air to raise them. S i n c e
the chests are connected to the canal’s
floor with stakes dri ven into the mud,
The city’s delicate equilibrium was upset by the digging of a canal deep enough to allow oil tankers to berth
at the industrial port of Marghera.
No other city in the world
h a s been studied in such
d e tail. None has been so
p a i n s takingly dissected

they work by rising like a gate that closes,
becoming dikes that cut the lagoon off
from the sea. Under the plan, 18 flo o d-
g ates will be set up at the entrance to
t h e p o rt of Chioggi a , 20 at Malamocco
and two sets of 20 and 21 separated by
a n i n t e rm e d i ate harbour basin at the
entrance to the Lido.
Furor over floodgates
According to estimat e s , this enorm o u s
task will require eight ye a rs , 6,000 wo r k e rs
and 3,700 billion lire (approx i m at e l y
$ 1 . 8 b i l l i o n ) .The city of Venice puts the
p r o j e c t ’s total cost at 5,334 billion lire
(in 1992 pri c e s ) , or some $2.6 billion—
not including maintenance.
“These mobile dikes must be bu i l t ,”
a f firms Philippe Bourdeau, a professor
at Bru s s e l s ’ Free Unive rsity and chairm a n
of the intern ational committee of expert s
named by the Italian gove rnment to eva-
l u ate the project. “The mobile flood-
g at e s ,” he say s ,“ a r e , along with raising the
ground level and the other planned mea-
s u r e s , the best way to save Venice for the
next 100 ye a rs.”
“These mobile dikes must be abso-
lutely avo i d e d ,” replies Stefano Boat o,
along with the Green Pa rt y, the Italia
Nostra environmental gr o u p, G r e e n-
p e a c e , the World Wildlife Fund for
N ature (WWF) and other env i r o n m e n t a l
o r g a n i z at i o n s , which say that the pro-
ject would have a disastrous effect on
the fragile ecosystem. But the munici-
pality of Ve n i c e , together with the Env i-
ronment and Cultural Heritage minis-
t ri e s , are leading the camp of those
i nvoking the precautionary pri n c i p l e .
They argue that the lagoon’s geomor-
p h o l o gi c a l , hydraulic and biologi c a l
balance must be restored—for example,
by cleaning up the canals, which began
in 1998 (see box ) , and raising the gr o u n d
l e vel—before any decisions about the
mobile dikes are made.
In addition to this controve rs y, o t h e r
questions have ari s e n . For example, t h e
c i t y ’s autonomy is at stake. The Depart-
ment of Wat e r , which depends on the
Public Works Ministry in Rome, and the
companies that make up the Consort i u m ,
which include major public and pri vat e
c o rp o r ations (such as Fiat ) ,h ave few or no
ties with Ve n i c e , whose population has
been accustomed to solving its problems
alone for 2,000 ye a rs.
Fear of
oil spills
And then there is the economic aspect:
$2.6 billion, a sum that rises with each
passing day, is a tremendous amount of
m o n e y. If all of it is allocated to a single
p r o j e c t , w h at will be left for other initia-
t i ves and for the small Venetian companies
t h at could carry them out? When all is
s a i d and done, the big corp o r ations in
M i l a n , Tu rin and Rome would reap the
b e n e fits and Venice would have to settle
for the cru m b s.
The debate has been raging for a long
t i m e . In November 1998, the project’s
e nvironmental impact commission,
appointed by the Environment Ministry
and chaired by Maria Rosa V i t t a d i n i , a n
architecture professor at the Unive rsity of
Ve n i c e , issued a negat i ve assessment and
requested the Consortium to review the
entire project. One month lat e r , a minis-
t e rial commission published a similar
r e v i e w, which was annulled in June 2000
by the regional administrat i ve tri bunal of
the Ve n e t o.The latest news is that ,d u ri n g
a meeting of experts held in Rome in July
2 0 0 0 , P rime Minister Giuliano A m at o
said the final decision would lie with his
office and that it would be made at a
cabinet meeting by the end of the ye a r.
But what if Ve n i c e ’s real problems is
not the exceptional tide, such as the one
t h at struck the city in 1966? And what if
the next disaster comes not from the
lagoon but from the sea? Each ye a r ,
2 5 million tons of freight is shipped on the
l a g o o n , half of which is oil and petro-
leum products. A single oil tanker accident
would be enough to cause incalculable
damage to the ecosystem, c over the canals
with a thick coat of petroleum and leave
gr e a s y, viscous streaks on the founda-
tions of palaces and churches foreve r. O n
N ovember 29, 1 9 9 5 , five tons of light fuel
spilled into the lagoon, f o rming a huge
slick that drifted for four day s.Was that a
wa rn i n g ?
In the city of masks, the fie ry glow of
the beautiful red sunsets over the city’s
palaces and churches, which enchant tou-
rists the year round, m ay not be solely
the gift of nat u r e .T h at extra shade of red
m ay well come from air pollution ari s i n g
from Marghera’s petrochemical fa c i l i t i e s.

Any city can be compared with a big machine
that needs to be overhauled and repaired on
a regular basis.
This analogy is especially apt for Venice, with
its fif ty-something kilometres of canals that accu-
mulate nearly half a million cubic metres of waste
and mud each year, its 454 bridges and its
100 kilometres of banks lined by the cellars of
palaces, churches, monasteries and convents,
pictures of which are reproduced in art books
around the world.
Although the city’s regular maintenance
would seem an obvious necessity, it took years of
discussions to come about. The result is called
Insula, a mixed company (52 per cent of the
shares are owned by the municipality and
48percent by four private companies) set up in
July 19 97 to manage the urban machine of Ve n i c e .
In slightly less than three years, Insula, basing its
work on a huge mass of studies conducted by
UNES CO in Venice, has dredged over 22 kilometres
of canals, extracted 123,000 cubic metres of mud
and restored 79 bridges. Soon it will start laying
fibre optic cables, because to survive, Ve n i c e
must also be on the cutting edge of science and
research. ■
At exceptionally high tide, a hydraulic system fills
the chests with air. They lift and turn into gates
that cut the lagoon off from the sea.

B e nyao turn away hundreds of appli-
cants seeking to study at their school,
l o c ated in a former paint fa c t o ry in we s t e rn
B e i j i n g . I t ’s not because they’re choosey:
they know all too well that these children
may not have another chance of stepping
into a classroom. But there is simply not
enough space to satisfy demand.
This unlicensed school caters to over
1,300 children from 28 Chinese prov i n c e s.
“ M a ny of the kids have to ride four different
buses to get here in the mornings, it takes
them up to two hours,” says Li.“And they
work hard knowing how difficult it is for
their parents to afford it.”W h at makes these
children different from other city-dwellers
is simply that they belong to China’s “ flo a-
ting population,” a label used to describe
people who are not permanently regi s t e r e d
in their current place of residence. Most are
the children of peasants who have left the
poverty-stricken countryside in search of
work in big cities.
E m p l oyed in menial jobs with no secu-
rity or healthcare, m i grants are responsible
for the lion’s share of the tough physical
labour that has transformed urban skylines
in the past decade or so.While the govern-
ment puts the “ f l o ating populat i o n ” at
100 million,Western analysts estimate the
figure closer to 150 million, making the
phenomenon one of the largest ru r a l - t o -
urban migrations in history.
This migr ation began in 1979, w h e n
the commune system was dismantled.A gri-
cultural productivity boomed, f e wer hands
were needed to work the land, so families
headed to cities such as Beijing and Shan-
ghai. In the mid-1980s, as rural incomes
steadily fell, the trickle became a flo o d ,
prompting municipal authorities to tighten
m i gr ation ru l e s. M i grants would now be
required to get temporary residence perm i t s
and letters of employment before coming to
the city. In practice, tens of millions never

obtain such permits. As such, they are not
r e gistered in the place where they are living,
c o n t r a ry to permanent migrants whose
m ove is officially sanctioned.Their tempo-
r a ry status exposes them to widespread dis-
crimination.When it comes to education,
their only option, until recently, has been to
enroll their children in an unlicensed school.
Li Shumei left Henan Province in 1993
to work in a clothing market in Beijing.At
the time, she say s , there were no schools for
migrant children in the capital. Nor were
they allowed to enroll in city schools. A
f o rmer teacher, she started educating a few
children in her home before starting up a
school with her husband.“ For our pupils in
the lower grades, the level of Chinese and
m at h e m atics is about the same as in regular
s c h o o l s ,” said Li. Te a c h e rs have to make
do with a lack of books and other mat e ri a l s ,
but Li explains that one of the gr e at e s t
challenges is to help pupils overcome a
sense of inferi o rity wrought by their second-
class stat u s. And because the school is unli-
c e n s e d , they face difficulties re-enteri n g
the educational mainstream to continue in
higher gr a d e s , though many, once they
reach the age of 12, return to their home
p r ovinces to continue their schooling while
living with relatives.
Some of school’s teachers are recent
gr a d u ates from the students’ home pro-
vinces, others are retired instructors from
B e i j i n g .Their wages are less than half those
paid in the mainstream, with no benefit s.A l l
expenses incurred in running the school,
including salaries, are derived from paltry
tuition fees—about $100 a ye a r. Li was for-
t u n ate enough to receive a generous dona-
tion from a retired couple in Los Angeles
who read about the school in an overseas
Chinese newspaper. The funds were put
towards relocating the school when police
ordered its removal from an earlier site.
According to the Ford Fo u n d at i o n ,t h e r e
are between 200 and 300 unlicensed schools
o p e r ating in the capital which struggle to
p r ovide schooling for an estimat e d
1 0 0 , 0 0 0 m i grant children, m a ny of whom
r e c e i ve no education at all. D o r o t hy Solinger,
a political science professor at the Unive rs i t y
of California at Irvine and author of C o n t e s-
c i t i e s ,” said Solinger. “The municipal
g ove rnments in some cities are now more
p e rm i s s i ve about letting parents set up
schools of their ow n . More migrants can
afford to pay the extra fee required for their
children to attend city schools, not to men-
tion that some migrant parents can now
afford to purchase the card which enables
their children to attend city schools on city
t e rm s.”
O ver the ye a rs howe ve r , people from the
provinces have become accustomed to fen-
ding for themselves to provide education.
“ We actually prefer it when the gove rn m e n t
leaves us alone,” says Chen Yi Fu. “When
they visit the school, they usually either try
to close us down or fine us for va ri o u s
things.”
But with the likelihood that China will
soon join the World Trade Organization and
compete in world agricultural markets, a
large portion of the country’s 800 million
farmers might find it even more difficult to
s u rv i ve in the country s i d e . If current trends
continue, there is little doubt that migrant
e d u c at i o n , and more broadly, m i grant ri g h t s ,
will become an increasingly pressing issue on
the government’s books. ■

t h at only 40 per cent of migrant children
b e t ween five and twe l ve attended school in
B e i j i n g, compared with 100 per cent of nat i ve
c h i l d r e n .This situation is mirrored in other
booming cities like Shenzhen and Shanghai.
Chen Yi Fu, p rincipal of the Hu Wan Ele-
m e n t a ry school in nort h - e a s t e rn Shanghai,
e s t i m ates that “in some migrant communities,
only 20 to 30 per cent of children go to
s c h o o l .” O f ficial statistics differ.According to
a 1996 study conducted by the Depart m e n t
of Basic Educat i o n , the average enrollment
r atio of migrant children stood at 96.2 per
c e n t .The study at t ri buted non attendance to
ove r c r ow d i n g, high fees and an unfavo u r a b l e
home env i r o n m e n t .
Media exposure and pressure from
s e veral delegates from the National Pe o p l e ’s
C o n gress led to a change in the law in May
1 9 9 8 .The central gove rnment decreed that
unlicensed schools could exist and that it is
u n l awful for large municipalities to deny
entrance to migrant children between six
and 14 who had lived for more than six
months in the area. City gove rnments often
responded by jacking tuition fees to impos-
sibly high levels for  migrants—up to $440
a n n u a l l y, when the average yearly income
of a migrant worker in Beijing is an esti-
m ated $600. And to dat e , only a handful of
c i t i e s , such as Wuhan and Guiya n g, h ave
granted legal status to migrant schools
according to the Pe o p l e ’s Economic Jo u rn a l.
For Chen Yi Fu,a native of Anhui Pro-
vince, “the Shanghai government doesn’t
feel they are responsible for educating our
children, even though the latter belong to
families from rural areas who do all the
hard jobs.” Y i F u ’s school cat e rs to chil-
dren from 13 provinces, who pay close to
$100 per year for tuition. “They are the
lucky ones,” he said, bemoaning the $7,000
rent he has to pay each year to the army,
which owns the land.
Besides the 1998 law howe ve r , t h e r e
are signs that the situation is slowly chan-
gi n g . Recognizing that China’s economic
miracle has clearly not benefitted all regi o n s ,
the central gove rnment has embarked on a
m a s s i ve scheme to invest in the country ’s
h i n t e r l a n d . M o r e ove r , “there are indica-
tions that in some respects, things are get-
ting slightly better for rural migrants in big
“ We actually prefer it when
the government leaves us
alone. When they visit the
school, they usually either try
to close us down or fine us for
various things.”
One of the greatest challenges
is to help pupils overcome
a sense of inferiority wrought
by their second-class sta t u s .
EDUCAT IONAL LEAPS
When the People’s Republic of China was
proclaimed in 1949, a mere 20 per cent of
the country’s primary school-age children were
enrolled in school while 80 per cent of the popu-
lation was illiterate. Education has been an
unwavering priority of this country of 1.2 billion
people. After efforts at universalizing primary
e d u cation, the government passed a law in 19 8 6
extending compulsory education to nine years.
The country has recorded some remarkable
achievements over the past fif ty years. In 19 9 8 ,
the net enrollment ra t i o1 of primary school-age
children reached 98.9 per cent , while adult illi-
t e ra cy stands at 16 . 37 per cent, according to a
r e p o r t2 prepared for the World Education Fo r u m
in Dakar (Senegal, April 20 0 0 ) . The report
stresses that efforts are now being focused on
improving access to education in poor regions
and those with minority populations, facilitating
f u n d raising for educational purposes and ra i-
sing the overall quality of teachers. ■

N
ow that globalization has reached the furthest cor-
ners of the planet, the world is said to have been
globalized —either for better, as some argue (pp
1 9 - 2 0 ) ,or for worse according to the critics (pp 20-21).Fa c e d
with the universal and uniform spread of this revolutionary
p r o c e s s, these critics have created a kind of international
opposition movement made up of previously fragmented
g r o u p s, drawn together by the inseparable nature of local
and global issues. Seattle was their spotlight.
This dossier offers a guided tour through this constellation
of movements opposed to the current style of globalization
and spearheaded by NGOs (pp 24 to 32).Though their back-
g r o u n d s, demands and actions are radically different, t h e s e
U. S. environmental activists, Philippine ethnic minorities, i n d i-
genous groups in Ecuador, peasants in Burkina Fa s o, I n d i a n
fisherfolk or janitors in Silicon Valley have joined to attack the
same targets and support the same aspiration:a new notion
of citizenship that balances the might of business with a
much stronger political realm. Sharing experience and capi-
talizing on knowledge have thus become key elements in
their strategy (p 33).
But what shape should the future “democratic world
g o v e r n a n c e ”t a ke? Current plans are still vague (pp 34-35),
while the legitimacy of these NGOs appears to rest solely
upon the relevance of the issues they raise and their ability to
develop ideas that can be turned into action (pp 35-36). ■

16 The UNESCO Courier - September 2000
Ma ny view globalization as a technology-
d ri ven global order that has led to an inten-
s i fic ation of interconnectedness among
nations.This, however, is merely one facet of glo-
b a l i z at i o n , and does not presuppose the ideolo-
gical homogenization or the rapid retrenchment of
the welfare state that is currently underway.
The dispute over globalization is not about the
i n t e n s i fic ation of global interconnectedness. R at h e r ,
it  is over the vision of the global system that globa-
l i z ation projects.This vision entails a global economic
system with identifiable rules of behaviour in trade,
fin a n c e , t a x at i o n , i nvestment policy, i n t e l l e c t u a l
property rights, and currency convertibility, all of
which are crafted along neo-liberal principles with
minimal governmental regulation. As the political
economist Ellen Wood per-
ceptively notes, this vision
of a global system repre-
sents a new phase of capi-
talism which is “more uni-
ve rs a l , more unchallenged,
more pure and more una-
d u l t e r ated than eve r
before.”
For many cri t i c s , g l o-
balization is essentially an
a n t i - d e m o c r atic process that excludes the interests
of a wide range of groups. But the process is not
shaped by market forces alone. It is only made pos-
sible by the acquiescence if not active support of
g ove rn m e n t s , especially those in advanced countri e s.
G ove rnments in developing countri e s ,m e a n w-
hile,are often said to be unable to stand up to glo-
b a l i z ation without incurring severe costs. T h e
g ove rnment of South A f ri c a , for example, c o u l d
be punished by capital flight if it insists on imple-
menting its agenda of social reform .The masses of
South Africa,however,are likely to sustain heavier
costs if the gove rnment abandons its reform i n g
m a n d at e . Faced with such a dilemma, g ove rn m e n t s
h ave generally selected the side of capital for a
simple reason: as the economist Paul Krugman has
noted, the collapse of communism has taken the
heart out of opposition to capitalism.
The list of problems caused by globalization is
l o n g . In low-income countri e s , such as those in
Sub-Saharan A f ri c a , where gove rnments have been
unable or unwilling to provide their populations with
e ven the most basic protection from the new phase
of global capitalism and structural adjustment
programmes,the people’s plight has been particu-
larly severe.
Opponents of globalization are addressing
genuine problems. But it is uncertain whether they
will succeed in reversing globalization or even in
m i t i g ating its adve rse impacts.To begin with, m a ny
of them are badly organized. Most of them have also
rallied around specific issues instead of art i c u l at i n g
a comprehensive counter vision.At this point, the
counter vision they project appears to be a global
system which is not shaped by the narr ow interests
of capital but which accommodates the interests of
diverse social groups. This
v i s i o n , h owe ve r , is not ye t
well developed.
Furthermore,these op-
ponents have yet to deve l o p
viable strat e gies to constrain
g l o b a l i z at i o n . Some argue
for weakening or even abo-
lishing institutions such as
the World Bank, the Inter-
n ational Monetary Fund,
and the World Trade Organizat i o n , which they view
as agents of globalizat i o n . But to the extent that these
organizations are effective agents of globalization,
it is unclear why business interests and gove rn-
ments would allow this to happen.The relevance of
these bodies is only likely to decline if Third World
c o u n t ri e s , especially middle-income ones, b e gin to
reduce their dependence on them under pressure
from their populations.
Yet the main problem faced by these critics is
that many of them do not see the relevance of the
s t at e . A successful struggle for genuine popular
democracy can liberate the state from the grip of
c o rp o r ate and financial interests, t u rning it into a cri-
tical agent for the promotion of broad social inter-
e s t s. M a ny NGOs rely instead on civil society,
though this cannot substitute the state in policy-
m a k i n g .The struggle against globalization is essen-
tially a struggle for democracy:the state cannot be
bypassed, but must be won. ■

of non-gove rnmental challenges to politics as

This worldwide explosion of NGOs (non-
g ove rnmental organizations) actually began
about thirty ye a rs ago, in response to the inter-
twined crises posed by pove rt y, p o p u l at i o n ,
and environmental degr a d at i o n . Po p u l at i o n
gr owth can lead to deforestation or soil exhaus-
t i o n , and thus increased pove rt y. The lat t e r
fuels migr ation to giant urban centres, or to
more remote areas where the cycle begins anew.
M o r e ove r ,e nvironmental destruction by mul-
t i n ational corp o r ations can further pove rty by
d i s rupting the traditional co-existence betwe e n
people and the land.
N G O s , including the grassroots move m e n t s
f e atured in this issue,h ave focused on these pri o-
rities for some time and have pushed gove rn-
ments to do so as we l l . The recent surge of
activism testifies not to a change in purp o s e , but a
gr owing realization that certain shared problems are
p a rtly caused by the common root of globalizat i o n .Ta r-
gets like the agencies of intern ational trade and fin a n c e
are hardly new, though their current prominence
r e flects an era of much gr e ater NGO co-ordination in
the face of rapid economic change and unresponsive

The real question, h owe ve r , is whether a gr ow i n g
global civil society, e ven in concert with willing gove rn-
m e n t s , could begin to match the magnitude of the
global challenge. No one alive today can answer this
q u e s t i o n , but an ove rview of what is happening may
p r ovide some clues.

d e m o c r at i z at i o n .As of 1995 there were an estimat e d
20,000 INGOs with branches in at least three countri e s ,
plus 5,000 or more nort h e rn NGOs working intern a-
tionally that are based in only one developed country.
Although INGOs have quadrupled in number
since 1970, their contri bution to relief and deve l o p m e n t
pales beside the demands posed by increasing numbers
of complex human emergencies. In 1995 only about
$10 billion of $60 billion in ove rseas deve l o p m e n t
assistance flowed through NGOs.
Yet these organizations have become prominent
global playe rs.They lobby official intern ational orga-
n i z ations with increasing frequency and success, a n d
h ave become important actors in agenda-setting mee-
t i n g s. From the Montreal Protocol regulating ozone
emissions in 1987 to the 1994 Cairo Po p u l ation Confe-
rence and the 1995 Beijing Wo m e n ’s Conference, t h e y
h ave accompanied their partner organizations in kee-
ping such issues as human ri g h t s , women and env i-
ronmental deteri o r ation on the front bu rn e r.
The most dramatic chapter in the NGO story has
been their proliferation in the global “ S o u t h .”B e gi n n i n g
about thirty ye a rs ago, increasing numbers of we l l - e d u-
c ated young people took advantage of foreign fin a n c i a l
assistance to create NGOs. Although a few organizers
c r e ated local “ c o u n t e rp a rt s ” to INGOs, most others used
funds from several donors to
d e fine their own progr a m m e s.
S e veral of these organizat i o n s
p r ovided protection from poli-
tical repression.
Almost eve ry w h e r e , t h i s
process depended on part-
n e rships between two types of NGOs: grassroots orga-
n i z ations (GROs) and grassroots support organizat i o n s
( G R S O s ) . Grassroots organizations have local mem-
b e rs and help develop their own communities.A l t h o u g h
s o m e , such as wo m e n ’s gr o u p s , are new,o t h e rs evo l ve d
from traditional community organizations such as
r o t ating credit societies that have existed for thou-
sands of ye a rs.There are now probably several hundred
thousand GROs in A s i a ,A f rica and Latin A m e ri c a .
Faced with the deteri o r ation of their env i r o n m e n t
and the increasing impove rishment of the 1980s,G RO s
and local individuals began organizing networks and
m ovements among themselve s.A network of lane com-
mittees in Oranji, Pa k i s t a n , for example, has prov i d e d
clean water and sewage for 100,000 people. An esti-
m ated 50,000 largely professional GRSOs, m e a n w-
h i l e ,help channel intern ational support to these lowe r
l e ve l s. In Bolivia, for example, a set of GRSOs focuses
on propagating solar greenhouse technologi e s.
Other organizations work on corruption or human
ri g h t s.An anti-corruption centre in Maharashtra,s u p-
p o rted by a GRO netwo r k , succeeded in getting fort y
local revenue offic e rs dismissed and has receive d
requests for help from other localities intent on purs u i n g
complaints through the court s.This type of political
activism sometimes reaches the global leve l , as the
Philippine indigenous leader V i c t o ria Ta u l i - C o rp u z
explains  (p. 2 4 - 2 5 ) .
The retreat of authori t a rian ru l e , m e a n w h i l e ,h a s
led to the creation of new types of NGOs concentrat i n g
18 The UNESCO Courier - September 2000
on broader democratic processes such as public deli-
b e r at i o n , voter regi s t r ation and election monitori n g,a n d
e ven to the election of some grassroots leaders to local
o f fic e . M a ny NGOs also advo c ate major political
c h a n g e s , though protests are not always at the street-
l e ve l .A Brazilian NGO, for instance,p r ovides citizens
with a toll-free “ green phone” to report env i r o n m e n t a l
c ri s e s.Nor is there a clear distinction between advo c a cy
and collaborat i o n . One network in India, the Inte-
gr ated Child Development Serv i c e , campaigns for
political change through both NGOs and “ c h a p t e rs ”
in federal and state gove rn m e n t s.
Stronger civil societies are also emerging in Cen-
tral and Eastern Europe,and the former Soviet Union.
Only a minority of the estimated 75,000  “ E a s t e rn ”
NGOs were previously tied to Communist regi m e s ,
with the rest created or resurrected by an inflow of
foreign assistance after 1989. Because these NGOs
emerged with the collapse of gove rnmental social ser-
v i c e s , they are more likely to be service prov i d e rs than
tied to members at the local leve l .I n d e e d , some form s
of local organization such as co-operat i ves acquired a
bad name under Communism.
Among the more innovat i ve NGOs in this regi o n
are those organized in response to the emerging env i-
ronmental crises of the 1980s. O ri gi n ating as quasi-
opposition move m e n t s ,t h e y
h ave continued to challenge
g ove rn m e n t s. M i c r o c r e d i t ,
i n i t i ated in the deve l o p i n g
wo r l d ,has also gained at least
a toehold in the transitional
c o u n t ri e s.
The non-profit sector has also gr own in the deve-
loped countri e s. In the United Stat e s , for example, 7 0
per cent of non-profit organizations are less than thirt y
ye a rs old. E ven more recent are the protest and other
social change movements fuelled by the gr owth of the
I n t e rn e t , such as those described by student activist
Andrea del Moral (p. 2 2 - 2 3 ) .
If nothing else, this ove rview highlights the diffi-
culties in mapping a complex, vast and dynamic global
civil society still in its infa n cy. On a global leve l ,s o m e
business networks focus on sustainable deve l o p m e n t ,
and national NGOs as dive rse as the Grameen Bank
in Bangladesh and Working Capital in New Hampshire
( U.S.) promote bu s i n e s s e s. T h u s , the non-gove rn-
mental challenge to mindless globalization is not oppo-
sition to profit s , but rather support for broader ow n e r-
ship and competition. Most import a n t l y, t rue civil
society is more than a collection of NGOs, but rat h e r
a measure of how citizens associat e , talk and act toge-
ther in public life.
Much has been made of the Internet and how it
m ay contri bute to a stronger civil society.Yet though the
I n t e rnet has helped create global coalitions on hundreds
of issues,billions of people still have no access to a tele-
p h o n e , much less to a computer. E ven if people gain
a c c e s s , they may be more likely to see an adve rt for a
soft drink than learn how to purify wat e r. U l t i m at e l y,
the contri bution of the Internet to the gove rnance of
g l o b a l i z ation will depend on the human ties that are
established off-line. ■

The other face of globalization
September 2000 - The UNESCO Courier 19
“Gl o b a l i z at i o n ” has become today ’s bu z z-
wo r d . It has also become a battle gr o u n d
for two radically opposed gr o u p s.T h e r e
are the “ a n t i - g l o b a l i s t s ” who fear globalization and
stress only its dow n s i d e , seeking therefore powe r f u l
i n t e rventions aimed at taming, if not (unwittingly)
c rippling it.Then there are the “ g l o b a l i s t s ” (a class
to which I belong) who celebrate globalization ins-
tead, emphasize its upside, while seeking only to
ensure that its few rough edges be handled through
a p p r o p ri ate policies that serve to make globalizat i o n
yet more attractive.
Many anti-globalists consider the central pro-
blem of globalization to be its amorality, or even its
immorality. But these critics have too blanket an
approach to globalizat i o n .The word cove rs a va ri e t y
of phenomena that characterize an integr ating wo r l d
e c o n o my : t r a d e , s h o rt - t e rm capital flow s , d i r e c t
foreign investment, immigration, cultural conver-
gence et al.The sins of one of the above cannot be
visited upon the virtues of another. Some are benign
even when largely unregulated whereas others can
be fatal if left wholly to the marketplace.
In part i c u l a r , the freeing of trade is largely
benign: if I exchange some of my toothpaste for
some of your toothbrushes, we will both be better
off than if we did not trade at all.It would require
a wild imagination,and a deranged mind,to think
that such freeing of trade leads to debilitating eco-
nomic crises. But only ideologues would deny that
the hasty freeing of short - t e rm capital flow s ,u n d e r
pressure from what I have called in Foreign Affairs
(May 1998) the US-Treasury Complex, was what
helped to precipitate the huge Asian financial cri s i s.
E q u a l l y, it is illogical to believe , as non-economists
who fear globalization do, t h at freeing of trade is bad
because the freeing of short-term capital flows led
to a debilitating financial and economic crisis and
could do so again. In fact, while there are some
obvious similarities between free trade and free
capital flow s — e . g . t h at segmentation of markets
c r e ates effic i e n cy losses—the economic and political
d i s s i m i l a rities are even more compelling and
policymakers cannot ignore them.
Anti-globalist critics are in fact often reacting
viscerally to a much larger issue: the victory of capi-
talism over its arch ri va l ,c o m m u n i s m . For campus
idealists who have always looked for altern at i ves to
w h at they conventionally consider to be the greed and
lack of social conscience that characterize capita-
l i s m , the situation is psychologically intolerable.
Some have turned to street theat r e , nihilism and the
anti-intellectualism that has been manifest in the
last few ye a rs. The more sophisticated have suc-
cumbed to a stereotypical representation of corp o-
r ations as the “ e v i l ” forces of capitalism that have cap-
tured the stat e , d e m o c r atic institutions, and eve n
i n t e rn ational bodies such as the World Trade Orga-
n i z at i o n .
W h at these critics often forget is that certain eco-
nomic freedoms are basic to prosperity and social
well-being under any conditions, and are thus of the
highest moral va l u e .P r o p e rty rights and markets, f o r
i n s t a n c e ,p r ovide incentives to produce and allocat e
resources effic i e n t l y, and can in turn strengthen
d e m o c r a cy by allowing a means of sustenance out-
side pervasive government structures.The quality
and breadth of democracy can then be enlarged as
excluded gr o u p s , such as women and the poor, a r e

pulled into literacy, gainful employment and better
health through higher public spending or the spread
of economic incentives.
Critics nevertheless go on to maintain that the
global spread of free markets and free trade is res-
ponsible for continuing poverty in poor countries,
and for alleged growth in inequality between and
within countri e s. Labour unions in the rich countri e s
also fear that their workers are being hurt by trade
in cheap labour-using goods from poor countries.
But I do not think these concerns are we l l -
f o u n d e d . In India which has almost a quarter of the
wo r l d ’s poor, there is good evidence that autarchic
and anti-market policies produced abysmally low
gr owth rates at 3.5 per cent annually over a quart e r
of a century, with a correspondingly negligible impact
on pove rt y. Since gr owth rates picked up since the
1 9 8 0 s ,p ove rty has declined. Higher gr owth rates in
t u rn depend on several fa c t o rs ; but openness to
trade and direct investment and a skilful use of mar-
kets are definitely an important contri bu t o ry fa c t o r.
As for inequality among nations, it is precisely
those countries that embraced integration into the
world economy, i . e . the Far Eastern Four and then the
ASEAN countries, which raced ahead with dramatic
gr owth rates whereas several countries of A f ri c a ,
L atin A m e rica and Asia that looked inwards failed to
Since the early 1980s, when the T h at c h e rite and
Reaganite revolutions were in full sw i n g, the doc-
t rine of neo-liberalism appears to have staked
itself out across the countries of the world without
meeting much serious opposition.But negat i ve reactions
to the spread of free market philosophy have ensued as
the damage it has caused — in terms of inequalities,
i m p ove ri s h m e n t , social exclusion and env i r o n m e n t a l
d e s t ruction—come to light.
S u p p o rt e rs of the free market advo c ate deregulat i o n
to the extent that all human activity would be run by the
p ri vate sector,while public authorities would be left to
manage the tools of coercion and law within a gi ven ter-
ri t o ry :n a m e l y, the army,the judicial system,and (if only
in part) the police and pri s o n s. On the other side, s u p-
p o rt e rs of a more humane economy, who have gr ow n
hugely in number over recent ye a rs , back a rather dif-
ferent formula for the good society:“ yes to the market
e c o n o my,not to the market society.” In other wo r d s ,t h e y
insist on the need to resurrect and re-establish regula-
tion in new and va ried forms so that it can cover today ’s
global dimensions of economic activity.
The differences between these two broad schools of
thought is at least three centuries old, b e ginning when
the old divine order— in which political authority wa s
enmeshed —collapsed.At the start of the 17th century,
Galileo confounded the Scriptures by proving that the
E a rth rotated around the Sun. S h o rtly after, p h i l o s o-
p h e rs such as Thomas Hobbes and John Locke argued
t h at the social order was not grounded in Prov i d e n c e ,
but in the decisions of individuals.The medieval dogma
holding that all power came from God, who assigned
each person his or her “ n at u r a l ” place in society, wa s
s h at t e r e d .From then on, societies faced a new challenge:
d e fining the “social contract” t h at linked people with
each other and with the stat e .
deliver growth and also made little dent on poverty.
The evidence on trade and investment impove-
rishing our wo r k e rs is also flawe d . My own research
suggests that the dow n ward pressure on wo r k e rs ’
wages due to technical change has been dampened,
not magnifie d , by trade with the poor countri e s.
Research also shows that big corp o r ations use abroad
t e c h n o l o gies similar to those at home, instead of
exploiting lower standards or forcing them yet lowe r
through their financial clout.
One result of these mistaken arguments against
g l o b a l i z ation has been an insistent clamour for cert a i n
e nvironmental and labour standards to be linked to
rules on intern ational trade. But by seeking to creat e
new “ o b s t a c l e s ” to free trade, you undermine the
freeing of trade, while mixing up trade with a moral
agenda undermines that ve ry moral agenda. It gi ve s
other countries the definite impression that yo u
a r e using ethical rhetoric to mask protectionist
s e l f-i n t e r e s t .
The notion that global free trade and inve s t-
ment are responsible for pove rt y, i n e q u a l i t y, l owe ri n g
of standards and harming social progress is little short
of astonishing.Yet it is gi ven curr e n cy by nat i o n a l
politicians and intern ational bu r e a u c r ats who think
t h at going along is a way of getting along. In deny i n g
the virtues of globalizat i o n , they actually harm the
ve ry causes they profess to embrace. ■

Two radically opposed forms of contract were put
f o r wa r d .The first “ p o l i t i c a l ”f o rm placed its trust in the
good will of individuals, who could freely decide the
shape of the new social order.The second “ e c o n o m i c ”
option suspected that this trust in fa l l i b l e ,fickle human
n ature was open to abu s e .A new social order, these lat t e r
t h e o rists maintained,needed rock-solid foundat i o n s —
namely economic “ l aw s ,” which are “ n at u r a l ” and thus
u n c h a n gi n g .
The first such law is that eve ryone acts pri m a rily out
of his or her own personal interest, the main thrust of
which is a desire for ri c h e s. This impulse is shared
u n i ve rsally in all societies, the theory goes,and will eve n-
tually be the best method for organizing all of them.A s
a result, the market theory took its first step towards a
utopian vision in which eve rything is subjected to its
ru l e s.
It is false to claim, as many neo-liberals do, t h at
t o d ay ’s enhanced market ideology is essentially modern ,
and that the revival of tougher “ p o l i t i c a l ” r e g u l at o ry
mechanisms to check the supremacy of pri vate interests
over the public good would be a step backwa r d s.
September 2000 - The UNESCO Courier 21
The other face of globalization
Scottish economist Adam Smith outlined the funda-
mentals of the free market two centuries ago; r e g u l at i o n
came much lat e r.
In the 19th century, a number of ve ry tightly
controlled national and intern ational markets gave
way to a much more open market. The pendulum
swung again, h owe ve r , and as a result of the market’s
failure to deliver a wo r k a b l e , peaceful society, m a r k e t s
were refined so that they today include “ ru l e s ,i n s t i t u-
tions and networks that control and monitor the crea-
tion of supply and demand and the relationship bet-
ween them,” according to French economist Je a n
G a d r e y. But these interventions are now being chal-
lenged by a new wave of deregulat i o n . D e fining a
market economy, s ays Gadrey, has hence become an
“extremely contentious and political” issue—as well as
a ve ry urgent one.
A second flawed argument used by neo-liberals is
t h at the market economy is the only source of we a l t h ,
and in part i c u l a r , wealth for all (the notorious “ t ri c k l e -
d ow n ”t h e o ry ) .The past 20 ye a rs ,h owe ve r ,h ave testi-
fied to widening inequality,with the three richest people
n ow wielding a fortune gr e ater than the combined
GDP of the wo r l d ’s 48 poorest nat i o n s.
The third error committed by today ’s free-marke-
t e e rs is their denial of the fact that the real economy in
fact rests on three foundat i o n s , as the Hungari a n
é m i gré political scientist Karl Po l a nyi argued. In a
market economy, the terms of trade are fixed by pri c e s
t h at va rious participants in the markets decide upon on
the basis of their interests. But hidden in these calcu-
l ations are all sorts of non-market va riables and contri-
bu t i o n s ,s t a rting with gove rnment aid and subsidies to
firm s.
In the non-market economy, the distri bution of
goods and services is largely handled by the public
s e c t o r , which operates according to the rules set dow n
by democratically elected authori t i e s.This is the “ we l-
fare stat e .”But beyond this, in the third,n o n - m o n e t a ry
e c o n o my, the pri o rity rests on reciprocity, with ser-
vices distri buted by groups or people according to the
social links that bind them together, whether in fa m i-
l i e s ,a s s o c i ations or mutual support gr o u p s.
F i rms benefit from training and teaching conducted
in the home,and thus draw on a fund of “social capital.”
L i k e w i s e , in the expanding service sector,businesses take
a d vantage of intangible investments like educat i o n ,
which depends largely on the public sector, as well as
on orders and investments from public authori t i e s.
They also depend heavily on the political decisions
made by gove rn m e n t s.
These examples go to prove that neither the oft-
mentioned distinction between a market and non-
market economy nor the claim that the former is the
only source of wealth surv i ve critical examinat i o n .I n s-
t e a d , we should adopt a more realistic and less ideolo-
gically dri ven model: t h at of a plural economy. By put-
ting these va rious beliefs up for discussion, we can
escape the tyranny of a market conceived as an abstract
and impersonal norm imposed on eve ryo n e . To m o r-
r ow ’s humane economy can only be built through the
interaction of regulated markets, s t ates and democrat i c
civil societies. ■

The world’s GDP(US$ billions) The world’s GDPper capita (1995 US$)
While the world is growing richer, inequality is increasing and extreme poverty remains deeply
e n t re n c h e d , as critics of globalization’s current style are quick to underline.
Global GDP has grown fivefold in real terms over the
past 25 years (top left), though over the same
period global GDP per capita only increased 3.5 times
( a b o v e, l e f t ) .This growth, h o w e v e r, has not been shared
by all.
The absolute number of people living on less than
a dollar a day in developing countries has remained
practically unchanged (slightly fewer than 1.2 billion)
over the past decade  (below).The income gap between
the richest and poorest 20 per cent of world population
has more than doubled over the past 40 years (oppo-
site page, top left),and nearly tripled if we look at the

◗ Freelance journalist based in
New York City
“ Eat your food. Children in Ethiopia are star-
v i n g .” It is a familiar refrain at the A m e ri c a n
dinner table to which scores of children have
r e p l i e d : “Send them my broccoli!” But to Andrea del
M o r a l ,n ow 22, the question sparked confusion.W hy
were children starving? “I still don’t understand it,” s h e
a d m i t s ,“ i t ’s not about not enough food in the wo r l d .”
T h at she continues to pursue the question sets her
a p a rt from her peers. A nat i ve of we a l t hy Seat t l e ,
Wa s h i n g t o n , she has turned her back on lucrat i ve job
o p p o rtunities to consider the co-existence of prosperi t y
and starvat i o n .
But the solution remains elusive . Looking back on
a year of hard-core activism that has included the Wo r l d
Trade Organization (WTO) protests in Seattle and
Wa s h i n g t o n , D. C . , teach-ins and cross-country road-
t ri p s , del Moral says fru s t r ation and hard lessons from
the world of global politics have forced her to re-eva l u at e
h ow she can help bring down the corp o r ate forces that
she believes are undermining food securi t y.
With close-cropped curls and baggy carp e n t e r ’s
p a n t s , she describes her look as “a little bit punk,” bu t
she is no arrogant rebel. Del Moral is thoughtful, a rt i-
c u l at e , with an easy, sometimes self-deprecating laugh.
T h at a young woman who has never known hunger
should make it her vo c ation comes as a surp rise even to
her own parents. But del Moral credits them for plan-
ting the seeds. Her father is a botany professor and her
mother works for the U. S .g ove rn m e n t ’s Env i r o n m e n t a l
Protection A g e n cy. “I grew up with that ethic [of env i-
r o n m e n t a l i s t s ] ,” she say s , adding that “ my family alway s
encouraged me to make my own decisions.”
But to the dismay of her parents, del Moral aban-
doned her studies at a Montreal unive rsity to purs u e
activism full-time.S u rviving on money earned tutori n g
and taking on odd acting roles, she began her subve r-
s i ve education with a band of like-minded twe n t y -
somethings in Montreal.While mounting street play s
i l l u s t r ating the nightmarish creations of genetic engi-
n e e ring gone wrong,the troupe began plastering mock-
labels on genetically modified foods and holding
d e m o n s t r ations outside the city’s superm a r k e t s.
Like thousands of other activists around the wo r l d ,
it was on the World Wide Web that del Moral first heard
the buzz about the WTO’s November 1999 meeting in
S e at t l e .“At first I didn’t know what the WTO wa s ,” s h e
a d m i t s. By tapping into dozens of “ l i s t - s e rve s ” a n d
email discussion gr o u p s , del Moral soon began flu e n t l y
using terms like “ c o rp o r ate seed supply”and “ b i o p i r a cy.”
Practice before preaching
She also deepened her knowledge of the Bretton-
Woods institutions and their sister, the WTO. She now
realizes that “these institutions were not formed by
people saying ‘ l e t ’s control the wo r l d ’ .They were creat e d
with good intentions that went wrong.” For del Moral,
“The big organizations are power structures that are in
complete contradiction with direct democracy, which has
the most potential for freedom.”While she unders t a n d s
the need for intern ational bodies to regulate and har-
monize the laws of different countri e s , del Moral fears
t h at these organizations are more concerned with pro-
fits than with people, and advo c ates dismantling them.
In the months prior to the Seattle protest, del Moral
t r avelled across the country,attending demonstrat i o n s ,
workshops on civil disobedience and classes in Social Eco-

I g o ro t s: in defence of home
◗ Victoria Ta u l i - C o r p u z
In the mid-1970s, the Igorot people won fame for fighting the largely World Bank-funded
C h i c o River Dam pro j e c t . N o w, their survival is increasingly linked to changing the rules of
international tra d e, as a leading advocate explains
Ihad become a student activist after living in
Manila at the height of the anti-Vietnam Wa r
m ove m e n t , but I was firmly convinced that my
future lay in going back home to help organize my
n at i ve people, the Igorots1. Since martial law had
been declared in 1972, the only legi t i m ate way for
us to operate was through NGOs. Six ye a rs later I
c r e ated one to organize villagers and set up com-
munity-based health progr a m m e s.
l o g y, the philosophy of living by nat u r e ’s example in
which organic fa rming is central.She soon discovered her
knack for addressing crow d s. But after speaking to more
and more people, she began to realize the limitations of
her theori e s.She recalls meeting with a fa rmer in we s t e rn
C a n a d a , who agreed that big corp o r ations like Nabisco
were manipulating the price of his harvest for their pro-
fit s , but didn’t see how organic fa rming would solve his
financial problems.“ For him it was about profits not pro-
d u c t i o n .We thought about how we could help, but we are
just city kids,”s ays del Moral,“I have no place telling these
kinds of people I have the solutions.”
Disappointed by that encounter,del Moral decided
to learn to practice what she was preaching in the
context of the global economy.She figured the best place
to get the big picture was in Seat t l e .
Del Moral arri ved in her hometown on the eve of
T h a n k s giving—ironically the A m e rican harvest holiday
a s s o c i ated with ove r - e at i n g . No one anticipated the
extent of the violence that erupted in Seattle from
N ovember 30 to December 3.Television images beamed
around the world showed a deva s t ated city in a state of
e m e r g e n cy ; riot police in bulletproof armour beat i n g
back protestors ,a rmed National Guardsmen roaming
the streets and gr a f fiti-ed storefronts.
As WTO d e l e g ates arri ve d ,s e c u rity was bolstered.
Stepping into the streets she had roamed as a child,d e l
Moral felt the ground shift.Her first encounter with ri o t
police in a parking garage marked a moment of
t ru t h : she and her fri e n d s , a rmed only with big
i d e a s , were about to engage in a battle with fa r
m o r e p owerful forces. “At that moment” s ays del
M o r a l , “I realized a sort of war was being waged upon
us and this (the police) was its visible manifestat i o n …
I wish I could carry that realization around with me
e ve ry day.”
While she steered clear of the front lines to avo i d
a rr e s t , sleepless nights and days spent dodging the
police left her bat t l e - we a ry. Once again, del Moral
wondered if she was making the best use of her energy.
“ We will never take down industrial agri c u l t u r e ,” s h e
recalls asking hers e l f,“so why are we doing this?”
Committed to change but still searching for her
place in the anti-globalization move m e n t , del Moral
has retreated from the front lines, d e voting herself to
organic fa rm i n g . On a six-acre fa rm in the quiet hills of
Ve rm o n t , she earns $50 a week tilling the land, and expe-
rimenting with seed saving and ancient fa rming tech-
niques which she believes still hold the key to solving
world hunger. ■

1. The Igorots are indigenous people from six ethno-
linguistic tribes—the Ibaloy, Kankana-ey, Ifugao, Kalinga,
Apayao/Isneg and the Bontoc—living in the rugged
Cordillera region in the northern Philippines. All six tribes
share common traits, including religious beliefs based on
nature.The total population of Igorots in the region stands
at 1.2 million according to the 1995 census.
We raised the social and political awareness of our
p e o p l e , and mobilized them against the dictat o r-
ship of Ferdinand Marcos. We understood that we
were oppressed and discri m i n ated against as indi-
genous people, and that therefore we should stru g g l e
for self-determ i n ation and regional autonomy. I n
the 1980s, the gove rnment was finally forced to
cancel the Chico River Dam Project because of our
sustained opposition. This project would have dis-
placed around 300,000 Igorots.
At the time we could already see the value of
i n t e rn ational networking to gather support for our
s t ruggles against military rule in many of our com-
m u n i t i e s.We discovered the Unive rsal Declaration of
Human Rights, and used it to strengthen our cause.

v i o l ations of indigenous peoples. Since the crea-
tion in 1982 of a UN Working Group on Indigenous
Po p u l at i o n s , indigenous peoples have regularly taken
p a rt in drafting minimum standards for the protec-
tion of their ri g h t s. I am, h owe ve r , a strong believe r
in the pri m a cy of local and national struggles ove r
i n t e rn ational action.Without strong resistance on
t h e gr o u n d , i n t e rn ational campaigns will fa i l .T h e
fa l l of the Marcos dictat o rship came about
p ri m a ri l y because of the protests of the poor majo-
ri t y, which had built up for more than 20 ye a rs
within the country. Only once the regime became
widely unpopular did the elite Filipinos and the
i n t e rn ational community start to withdraw some
s u p p o rt from it.
But I have also seen how decisions or agr e e-
ments reached by intern ational institutions like the
World Bank and the Intern ational Monetary Fund
( IM F) can erode gains achieved locally. From the
l ate 1970s to the 1980s, I helped to set up commu-
nity-based health progr a m m e s , only to see the stru c-
tural adjustment policies and programmes of the
World Bank and IM F lead to budget cuts in health,
while liberalization of our investment and trade law s
set back much of our progr e s s.
The struggle for ancestral land ri g h t s , for ins-
t a n c e , was undermined by the Mining Act of l995,
which allows foreign mining corp o r ations to have
100 per cent foreign equity and a 75-year lease on a
maximum of 81,000 hectares of mineral lands. T h e
Indigenous Pe o p l e s ’ Rights Act (IPRA), a new law
passed in 1998, r e c t i fied some of the damage but fa l l s
s h o rt of what we wa n t . The mining corp o r at i o n s
h ave neve rtheless filed a suit in the Supreme Court
questioning its constitutionality.
We were told that to deve l o p, we have to shift
from producing for our domestic use to producing
for the world market. But those who shifted to cash
crop production are now going bankrupt because of
the dumping of highly-subsidized, i m p o rted agri-
cultural products from foreign countri e s. C h e a p
r e a d y - t o - f ry sliced potat o e s ,c o rn , oranges and pears ,
frozen-dressed chicken and other foods are being
dumped in the country, d e s t r oying the livelihoods of
tens of thousands of fa rm e rs. The commitments of
the Philippine gove rn m e n t , p a rticularly relating to
a griculture as part of the Uru g u ay Round of the
General A greement on Ta riffs and Tr a d e , has allowe d
this to happen.
This situation is not unique to the Philippines.
Our Quechua sisters from Pe ru share a similar story.
Their potatoes are now left to rot in the fields because
they cannot compete with cheap, dumped processed
p o t ato slices from North A m e ri c a .I m p o rted maize or
c o rn has also destroyed the traditional corn produc-
tion of indigenous peoples in Mexico. Food insecu-
rity and the loss of livelihoods are wo rsening each day.
Of cours e , we argue that our gove rnments should
be blamed because they signed these agr e e m e n t s ,a n d
also because they push an unsustainable economic
model that is debt-dri ve n , e x p o rt - o riented and
i m p o rt - d e p e n d e n t .
In our own voice
But we are not blind to the powe rs of the Wo r l d
Trade Organizat i o n , the IM F and World Bank, a n d
bodies like the Organization for Economic Coope-
r ation and Development (OE C D) or the Group of
E i g h t . Those economies that do not fall in line
become pari a h s.The globalization of the production
and consumption systems of the few elite countri e s ,
c o rp o r ations and individuals is a threat to the conti-
nued existence of dive rse and sustainable indige-
nous live l i h o o d s.
This is the main reason why Tebtebba was set up
in 1996. After doing work on the local and nat i o n a l
l e ve l s , I felt that there was a gap. Global decisions
directly impact on our daily lives and can erode
gains achieved through ye a rs of hard wo r k . Yet we
h ave no chance to influence these decisions. O u r
absence in the global arena allows others to speak for
u s , and in many instances we are misrepresented.
Tebtebba is a Kankana-ey-Igorot term for discours e
and I thought this was an appropri ate name for an
Indigenous Pe o p l e s ’I n t e rn ational Centre for Po l i cy
Research and Educat i o n .
Indigenous peoples are pushing hard for the UN
to adopt the Declaration on the Rights of Indigenous
Pe o p l e s , and are campaigning to slow down or halt
unfettered globalizat i o n . Tebtebba took the lead in
researching and writing on globalization and indi-
genous peoples. In Seat t l e , we adopted the “ S e at t l e
D e c l a r ation of Indigenous Pe o p l e s.” Among other
t h i n g s , this called for the removal from the WTO o f
the Tr a d e - R e l ated Aspects of Intellectual Propert y
Rights—a legal device allowing corp o r ations to
a p p r o p ri ate our dive rse biological and genetic
r e s o u r c e s , along with our traditional know l e d g e ,
and to patent life itself.
We still have a long way to go.We need all kinds
of part n e rs h i p s , e ven with gove rn m e n t s , to bri n g
about a world which allows us to exist as distinct
peoples and where social, economic and env i r o n-
mental justice reigns. ■

The other face of globalization
September 2000 - The UNESCO Courier 27
Luis Macas is one of the most prominent leaders
and thinkers in Ecuador’s indigenous people’s
m ove m e n t .I nva riably dressed in the distinctive l y
dark poncho and sombrero from his village of Sara-
g u r o, in the country ’s we s t e rn highlands, he manages
the Internet edition of a newsletter published by the
Institute for the Knowledge of Indigenous Culture.
Macas heads this Quito-based body, h aving serve d
stints as president of the Confederation of Ecuador’s
Indigenous Nationalities (CO N A I E) and as a nat i o n a l
deputy for the Pachakutik move m e n t .
The CO N A I E and its political wing Pa c h a k u t i k ,
which today has six deputies in the 123-seat unicameral
E c u a d o rian parliament, was one of the main gr o u p s
i nvo l ved in a popular uprising in Ja n u a ry 2000 that
shocked the world by seizing control of the gove rn m e n t
and parliament in Quito. Allied with a group of yo u n g
m i l i t a ry offic e rs rebelling against corru p t i o n , the indi-
genous groups forced the then President Jamil Mahuad
to resign and flee the country, though the insurgents
failed to secure one of their main objective s :s t o p p i n g
a bid to dollarize the economy, which wiped out the
n ational curr e n cy, the sucre, with the stroke of a pen.
Niches of local power
For Luis Macas, a restored sense of identity is not
only important for indigenous people, who make up a
third of the country ’s 12 million people, but for Ecua-
d o rian society as a whole. Once indigenous people
complete their period of “ s e l f - d e fin i t i o n ” t h r o u g h
s t ruggles for land and preservation of their ancestral cul-
t u r e , Macas argues, “ethnic differences can be super-
s e d e d ”and political plans drafted for the whole society.
Macas places gr e at hope in the niches of local
p ower won by Ecuador’s indigenous movement in
M ay 2000, when they romped to victory in 27 tow n
halls and five provincial districts out of 22—a totally
unparalleled event in recent Latin A m e rican history.
According to Macas, success at the ballot box needs
to be conve rted into better training for local indigenous
l e a d e rs and gr e ater democratic part i c i p ation by com-
m u n i t i e s :“there are two bases, the technical and the poli-
t i c a l , and we have to strengthen both,” he declares.

m u n i t i e s ,C u ricama combines a long career as leader of
his people’s campaigns with an extraordinary manage-
rial dynamism.“ You’ll never find me inside my offic e ,”
he explains,“I’m always on the road.” Re-elected twice
since 1992, this Quechua from the country ’s central
highlands who started work as a builder at the age of 17,
has revolutionized his distri c t , promoting public part i-
c i p ation in local assemblies, and combining the m i n ga—
the Quechua people’s traditional community wo r k — w i t h
assistance from leading foreign organizat i o n s.The results
are there for all to see: r o a d s ,
d rinking wat e r , i rri g at i o n
c h a n n e l s , r e f o r e s t ation and
replenishment of the local fis h
stock in places where previous
g ove rnments sowed only pove rty and pat r o n a g e .A few
months ago he created the Indigenous Chamber of
C o m m e r c e , which local people hope will adve rtise and
sell their products within the country and abroad.
M a riano Curi c a m a , who has travelled to 14 countri e s ,
is not afraid of globalizat i o n : “If we don’t jump on this
c a r , we’ll be left by the side of the road,” he declares.
Miguel Lluco, a former national deputy and
n ational co-ordinator of the Pachakutik move m e n t ,i s
also convinced that his people’s horizons will have to
w i d e n : “Ecuador can’t be an exception in this process
of globalizat i o n ,” he say s. The bloodless uprising in
Ja n u a ry, he acknow l e d g e s , was “the inevitable refle c-
tion of a global situation that has been imposed on us
through dollari z ation and the globalization of cur-
r e n cy exchanges, and which threatens to disrupt the
d e velopment of our own political agenda.
“ T h at ’s why it’s so vital to build up links with people
who are campaigning and proposing altern at i ves across
the wo r l d . If we had stayed put in Ecuador with the
local land conflicts of the 1960s, when eve ry village
fought with its own landlord as if it were engaged in a pri-
vate bat t l e , we would never have made all this progr e s s
in indigenous people’s organizat i o n . People in the Firs t
World can provide us with a lot, while we can promote
our values and community vision.”
Until the age of 13, when on one moonlit night he
left the rustic house where he lived with his illiterat e
peasant family and headed to
the sugar cane plantat i o n s
on the coast, Miguel Lluco
knew nothing outside his
small corner of the A n d e s.
On the basis of his experience as a labourer, s h o e s h i n e
b oy, ice-cream salesman, c a rp e n t e r , union leader,
p o l i t i c i a n , d e p u t y, and indefatigable defender of the
“ i n t e gral human being,” as he likes to put it, L l u c o
weighs up the risks and opportunities of a globalized
wo r l d :“I see it in the same way as the course of my life,
from my village of Sacaguan, to discove ring the neigh-
b o u ring town of Guamote and its school, then on to
the situation of Ecuador and Latin A m e rica as a
w h o l e , until I started to wonder ‘ W h at do they think
in the First Wo r l d ? ,’ ‘ H ow do we build a form of com-
m u n i c ation and perhaps co-operat i o n ? ’ ”
The future of the first Latin A m e rican country to

Ecuador and the North gi ve to these questions. ■

with the Textile Fibre Company (SO F I T E X) , which ru l e s
the cotton industry and has a monopoly on input and

The other face of globalization
September 2000 - The UNESCO Courier 29
Appealing to popular opinion, Ouédraogo and his
o r g a n i z ation asked a pri vate newspaper, Le Pay s, to see
for itself. SO F I T E X c o u n t e r - attacked by staging a pro-
paganda tour of a cotton-gr owing region for other news-
p a p e rs.T h at is when the FE N O P r e c e i ved unexpected
s u p p o rt from L’ I n d é p e n d a n t, directed by the fa m o u s
i nve s t i g at i ve journalist Norbert Zongo, who was assas-
s i n ated on December 13, 1 9 9 8 .Protests swelled and the
g ove rnment had to calm things dow n : it wiped out all the
debts that fa rm e rs had contracted to purchase the pes-
t i c i d e s. This was the first time in any fa rm e r ’s living
m e m o ry that the State backed down in the face of
a n gry protests.
The FE N O P is proud of that victory, but it had to keep
on fig h t i n g, this time on the broader front of fa rm
i n d u s t ry liberalizat i o n . In the 1980s,s t ructural adjustment
policies had dealt severe blows to fa rm aid such as sub-
sidized fert i l i z e rs and training. M o r e ove r ,l ower import
duties helped to increase competition between nat i o n a l
and foreign products on the domestic market. I n t e r g o-
ve rnmental accords signed in Ja n u a ry 2000 in the fra-
m e work of West A f ri c a ’s regional integr ation policy only
f u rthered the trend towards lower customs barri e rs.
A n d , as usual, nobody asked small fa rm e rs what they
t h o u g h t .
In this context, the FE N O P s t a rted two bat t l e s ,
o n e against bananas from Côte d’Ivo i r e , the other
against rice from A s i a , both symbols of trade liberaliza-
t i o n . But the struggle against bananas from Côte d'Ivo i r e
seems futile. E ven though they do not taste as good as
Burkina Fa s o ’s smaller fru i t , they look better and cost
l e s s. G r own on large, m o d e rn plantat i o n s , they also
b e n e fit from better agricultural conditions and a more
clement climat e .
The battle against Asian ri c e , which is gr a d u a l l y
replacing local gr a i n s , seems off to a better start bu t
depends on untangling a web of corru p t i o n .“ We have
conducted an inve s t i g at i o n ,” s ays Ouédraogo,“to show
t h at a ton of that rice costs 25 per cent less on the
market at Ouagadougou than it would if the import e rs
paid all the duties.”He adds that Burkina Fa s o ’s rice “ i s
of better quality because it comes from recent harve s t s ,
while the imported rice is sometimes seven to 10 ye a rs
o l d .And there is not a shadow of a doubt that chemical
p r e s e rvat i ves had to be added to keep it from spoiling.
But many consumers are unaware of all that .”
Winning market shares
without selling out
According to its leaders , the FE N O P is fighting so that
p r o d u c e rs are no longer left out of the global economy
and can win positions on future markets.The group goes
out into the field to inform and train fa rm e rs , while pro-
ducing films for national television about promising
c r o p s , such as oil seeds, shea and sesame. For example,
few fa rm e rs know that sesame brought in some $4.2 mil-
lion two ye a rs ago.T h at tidy sum was harvested because
of the quality of Burkina Fa s o ’s crop, gr own without fer-
t i l i z e rs (because fa rm e rs cannot afford them) at a time
when organic products are becoming increasingly
popular in Europe and A s i a .
So opening up borders sometimes has positive
e f f e c t s. But Burkina Fa s o ’s fa rm e rs must be careful not
to sell their souls to the devil. “ T h at is also what we
d e f e n d . A kind of citizenship agri c u l t u r e ,” s ays Oué-
d r a o g o.“Like José Bové in France. In September 1999,
we even adopted a motion of support for the impri s o n e d
French fa rm e r.”Faced with a gove rnment that is seeking
to divide and denigr ate the fa rm e rs ’ m ove m e n t , t h e
FE N O P k n ows it needs allies. At the beginning of July
2 0 0 0 , the group helped to set up a regional organizat i o n
of West A f rican fa rm e rs ’ m ovements and maintains
contacts with Via Campesina, a worldwide move m e n t
to support fa rm e rs ’ cultures and stru g g l e s.The Sahel and
M c D o n a l d ’s may not be at war ye t , but fa rm e rs ’o r g a-
n i z ations are gearing up for the fray. ■

were accepted by the Cabinet,and since 1996,the
government has stopped giving new licenses. For
probably the first time, a fishing community changed
the policy of globalization through protest.
Your movement has also expressed particular
concern over shrimp production for export.
First of all, you have to ask why aquacultures
[ s h rimp fa rms] exist. I t ’s because a particular va ri e t y
like shri m p, cuttle fish or salmon is already depleted,
and is no longer available in the marine sector. B u t
the ve ry fact that it is a monoculture means trouble,
because it depends on a high use of pesticides and
a rt i ficial manure.This pollutes the entire area.T h e n
the paddy-fields,which are meant for the people’s
basic needs, are conve rt e d . Then the mangr ove s
are destroye d , though they are the breeding gr o u n d
for many species. By bringing in saline water, you
pollute the drinking water meant for local people.
The entire development [around 200,000 hectares
of coastal land have been converted into shrimp
fa rms] is displacing coastal people and fishing com-
m u n i t i e s. And all this intensive aquaculture of
shrimps is controlled by big companies,big inves-
t o rs and big rich people—and funded by the Wo r l d
Bank.It is a philosophy of rape and run: you make
the money fast,then you run away.
In 1996, the Supreme Court ordered all the aqua-
culture fa rms in the country to be abolished. But instead
of abolishing them,the gove rnment and political part i e s
sided with the World Bank and multinational companies,
and ordered a review of the judgement.They then intro-
duced a new Aquaculture A u t h o rity bill, which is pen-
ding approval by the Upper House of Pa r l i a m e n t .F i s h e r-
people are ve ry angry about this.
How has the experience of Indian fishermen
differed from that of other fishing communities
around the world?
Whether in India, the U. S . or Europe, s m a l l
b o ats and small communities have no chance of sur-
vival.Everywhere the pattern is the same:only the
big will survive,and the rest will be wiped out.
But globalizat i o n ’s victims can change the situa-
t i o n . From Senegal to Brazil, from Canada to South
A f ri c a , fis h e rpeople are struggling against destru c-
tive fishing and the stronghold of multinationals.
Local communities should be the custodians of
this natural capital. ■

The last ten years have been marked by a series of
protests by fisherpeople across India, in which you
have been deeply involved. Why are fishing
communities so angry?
In 1991 India introduced its new economic
policy, which marked the beginning of a new deep
sea fishing policy. Huge foreign ve s s e l s , wo r k i n g
under the guise of joint ventures and fees paid to the
g ove rn m e n t , were gi ven licenses and started coming
into Indian wat e rs.There are some 25,000 such ve s-
sels around the world.They have depleted all the
oceans apart from the Indian Ocean, and are a
t h r e at to over 100 million people in deve l o p i n g
countries who depend on fisheries for their liveli-
h o o d . So this new policy was clearly going to affect
Indian fisherpeople, and probably displace them.
Ten million fis h e rpeople went on four all-India

changing the entire deep sea fishing policy. These

While some circuit board assembly lines have
since been exported abroad, to Ta i wa n ,K o r e a ,I n d i a
and East Germ a ny, j a n i t o rs need not wo rry that their
e m p l oye rs will pull out and move elsewhere. T h e
gleaming office buildings in Cupertino and on the
man-made lake at Redwood Shores are not going
away.
But the janitors have also been caught in the cha-
r a c t e ristic bind of the new economy. Conditions of
e m p l oyment in California have gr own increasingly
tenuous as the new economy goes from strength to
s t r e n g t h .According to Working Pa rt n e rs h i p s , a labour
think-tank based in San Jo s e , 45 per cent of Califor-
nians now have no more than two ye a rs ’ tenure in their
c u rrent jobs,and temporary employment agencies bet-
ween 1993 and 1998 expanded by 182,900 people —
more than the net job gr owth in the software and elec-
tronic industries combined. The trend towa r d
o u t s o u r c i n g, as businesses pare down extraneous
e m p l oyees to concentrate on their core bu s i n e s s ,h a s
been felt throughout the wo r k f o r c e .
Fo u rteen ye a rs earlier, wo r k e rs like Mendoza
would have been in-house employees earning as
much as $14 an hour at such firms as Hewlett Pa c-
k a r d . But in the economic slump of the early 1990s,
the high-tech firms reaped a bonus, spinning off jani-
t o rial wo r k , along with such services as landscaping
and securi t y, to competing independent contractors
and substantially bri n ging down the cost of janitors ’
l a b o u r , to around $8 an hour.

V icente Mendoza, an immigrant from Mexico,
t r avels about 15 miles (24 km) through the
rush hour traffic each morning from Oakland,
C a l i f o rn i a , to his first job in San Ramon, where he
s h ows up to work in a restaurant at 9 a.m. After five
h o u rs of wo r k , he stops home again for a couple of
h o u rs , then crosses the San Mateo Bridge over the San

Micro Devices, 26 miles (40 km) away in Sunny-
va l e .H e r e , he works as a janitor for his second shift of
the day, from 6 p. m . to 2.30 a.m.The office wo r k e rs
are gone; only a few late night stragglers see him
push his cart around, loaded with cleaning fluid and
m o p s. By the time he gets home again, i t ’s 3:15 a.m.
I t ’s surp rising he had any energy left over to

j a n i t o rs in Service Employees Intern ational Union,
Local 1877, who came out with the Justice for Ja n i-

working out of the public view, they were determ i n e d

Tenuous contracts
In this they succeeded. L ow-paid wo r k e rs in a
high-tech economy, they managed to capture at t e n-

gr owth in Silicon Va l l e y.Working relentlessly to try to
make ends meet, they have been left behind by an
i n d u s t ry that has gr own faster and produced more
wealth than any other in the history of the wo r l d .
At the World Trade Organization protests in Seat t l e
in December, there was little talk of this vo l atile nexus
of the world economy.And ye t ,according to one of the
S e attle protesters , Raj Jayadev—a young Bay Area acti-
vist who grew up in San Jose as the son of Indian
i m m i grants—Silicon Valley brings together the key
issues raised by globalizat i o n .
“The labour stru g g l e , the environmental degr a-
d at i o n , the inequities, the falling standards of living,
the importance of immigr ation — it’s all played out
on the shop flo o rs of Santa Clara County,” he say s.
Jayadev describes how he worked on the assembly line
at Hewlett Pa c k a r d , lifting boxes with an electri c a l
e n gineer from the Punjab, an Eritrean with a degr e e
in finance and a plant owner from Kerala, I n d i a , all of
whom were acutely conscious of their drop in stat u s.

The Silicon Valley giants in turn argued that they
had no responsibility for the wo r k e rs that the sub-
c o n t r a c t o rs brought in to sweep their marble halls.
Ja n i t o rs ’l e a d e rs ,h owe ve r ,h ave not hesitated to exploit
their position as a symbol of the vast disparities of
wealth in the area. “It was a larger question that
brought so much at t e n t i o n :W h at are we going to do
with our poor in today ’s booming economy ? ” s ay s
Mike Garcia, the president of the local janitors ’u n i o n .
“These people were working two to three jobs and
t rying to raise a fa m i l y. M e a n w h i l e ,t h e y ’re cleaning
the edifices of the fil t hy ri c h , the ove rnight billio-
naires and millionaires. H ow could they explain that
their janitors are living two to three families in a
g a r a g e ? ”
Tom Csekey, the union’s vice president, has spent
the last decade with Garcia building up union repre-
s e n t ation among janitors in the Bay Area from about
25 per cent of the janitorial workforce to more than
75 per cent this ye a r. In 1996, they were able to get a
living wage ordinance passed in Los A n g e l e s ; t h e
u n i o n ’s recent struggles have centred on immigr at i o n
issues and health insurance. “ We devised a strat e g y
where we were able to talk not so much about wa g e s
as about the conditions the wo r k e rs live in,” s ay s
C s e k e y.“The backdrop was going to the clients and
s ay i n g : ‘These people work within your wa l l s.Yo u ’ ve
got some level of responsibility here.’ ”
And fin a l l y, faced with a chorus of protest from
other unions, C atholic bishops and local politicians,
e xe c u t i ves at the biotech firm Genentech and the
t e l e c o m m u n i c ations company Pa c i fic Bell we r e
shamed into admitting responsibility for wo r k e rs they
had refused to acknow l e d g e .
The contract the janitors settled in June,w i t h o u t
going on stri k e , was the most generous in the history
of the union. It provides for an eight per cent annual
increase in their hourly pay over the next three ye a rs ,
from $7.64 or $8.04,depending on which county they
work in, to $9.64 or $10.04. But that is hardly going
to help them move out of the conve rted garages they
l i ve in, where a small two-bedroom house can fetch
$ 7 5 0 , 0 0 0 .
After prevailing both in the Bay Area and in Los
A n g e l e s , the union is now concentrating on the jani-
t o rs of Sacramento.The expiration of the contracts it
has just negotiated has been synchronized, so that in
three ye a rs , 14,000 janitors across California will be
acting in concert .
The dispossessed
Much of the workforce of Silicon Valley is as ye t
u n o r g a n i z e d , from the crews at Internet start - u p s
who work 14-hour days and camp out in their offic e s
to the lower echelons. In the almost entirely non-
unionized “clean rooms” t h at assemble circuits,A s i a n
wo r k e rs are often wa ry of joining a union, s o m e t i m e s
because their immigr ation status is uncert a i n .
But among the ranks of the janitors ,m a ny of whom
are also undocumented, the Mexican tradition of orga-
nizing is strong. “They understand the concept of
u n i o n i z at i o n ,”s ays Garcia.“ T h e y ’re not confused at all
t h at our powe rs lie in our ability to come together.”
Garcia is anxious to make common cause with the
increasingly dispossessed middle classes.The stri k e ,
he feels,has helped to turn around the climate of xe n o-
phobia that swept through California over proposed
a n t i - i m m i grant legi s l at i o n . “ People look at immi-
grants in a much more positive vein today,” he say s ,
“as hard-working people trying to advance them-
s e l ve s.”
M a rianne Steeg, staff director of the South Bay
Labor Council, argues that the janitors ’s t rike helped
to draw attention to questions of the area’s social
c o n t r a c t , putting the need for affordable housing,
t r a n s p o rt ation and health care firmly at the top of the
political agenda.
“School teachers , fir e m e n , health wo r k e rs — so
m a ny of our wo r k e rs who can no longer afford to live
here —no longer identify with the upper-middle class,
but with the working poor,” she say s , adding that the
s t rike put a dent in the shining armour of the high-tech
firm s.“They can no longer claim that the prosperi t y
of Silicon Valley means prosperity for all.” ■

The other face of globalization
September 2000 -The UNESCO Courier 33
It all starts with a sense of powerlessness, sprin-
ging from a paradox that can be formulated in
many different ways but which boils down to a
simple tru t h : humanity will have to make some
pretty fundamental changes if it wants to surv i ve .We
clearly cannot rely on the main political and eco-
nomic playe rs — i m p risoned in their agendas, h a m-
pered by short-sightedness and practical
constraints—to take up the challenge.Instead,it’s
up to the ordinary citizens to organize on a global
s c a l e , and change from being powerless to taking a
s t a n d , joining the debate and drafting a different way
forward.
The Charles Léopold Mayer1 Foundation for
Human Progress was set up in 1982 in Geneva
with the aim of linking activism in the world to
study of the future.At the time, our societies, t h o u g h
richer and wiser than ever before, seemed singularly
unable to satisfy the hopes
and most basic needs of
their members. We had
to weave a closer relation-
ship between thought and
a c t i o n , b e t ween adva n c e s
in knowledge and possibilities for human progr e s s.
The foundation started out by support i n g
e n d e avo u rs that brought these elements together—
a novelty at the time—but these initiat i ves still
remained isolated “ p r o j e c t s.” For example, o n e
project in Brazil invo l ved assistance in building a net-
work across 10 regions to gather inform ation on tra-
ditional branches of knowledge and contrast the fin-
dings with modern science. In Tanzania, a project
aimed to improve agricultural training by making it
more attuned to small farmers’ needs.
While involved in these projects, we made two
d i s c ove ri e s. F i rs t l y, we found that solutions to pro-
blems must be made on the basis of each part i c u l a r
social context, though the problems themselves are
broadly the same.A common denominator of issues
cropped up in all the projects, no matter where
they were taking place. But these shared characte-
ristics were often hidden by the sheer complexity of
local circumstances, ri gid mindsets, i n s t i t u t i o n a l
factors and different schools of knowledge.
This common denominator became the ve ry
basis of our programmes, and explains the impor-
tance we have attached to establishing netwo r k s.
Equipping some of our partners with Internet, a
potentially formidable tool for democratic progr e s s ,
has thus become one of the foundation’s priorities.
Our second discovery was that the most useful
knowledge for future action comes from practice,
namely from one’s own experience and that of others
– experience that must be identified and recorded so
others can learn from it. Hence the need to store
information and circulate it by creating a tool for
communication that can become a type of “collec-
t i ve intelligence.” Since 1986, the foundation has gr a-
dually built up an intern ational database for shari n g
experience,establishing first of all norms for orga-
nizing and distri buting the inform at i o n .To d ay, t h i s
c o rpus of shared experience cove rs a wide area,
from the geopolitics of drugs and social exclusion in
Asia to the management of difficult neighbourhoods
in nort h e rn France and innovat i ve educat i o n a l
methods in Brazil. S o m e
8,000 contri butions from
citizens and local, regional
and national institutions,
research centres and NGOs
are gathered in the dat a -
base, while the Association of Chinese Mayors has
expressed interest in adopting it for future use.
By enabling some of our netwo r k ’s members to
become more knowledgeable than recognized
experts in the field, these tools are among the key
elements that will help take “civil society” into its
third historical phase.A first period of protest was
f o l l owed by part i c i p ation in major world foru m s ,t o
which we brought a critical vo i c e .N ow we are gea-
ring up for a new era of initiat i ve by connecting the
a l t e rn at i ve strat e gies and visions that people around
the world are searching for, weighing up and inve n-
ting.All these alternatives are based on the simple
premise: think locally, act globally.
This new unity, built over time and striving to rea-
lize a common goal through respect for the part i c u-
l a rities of eve ry place, is the essence of the Alliance for
a Responsible and United Wo r l d . Set up in 1993, it has
p a rt n e rs in 115 countri e s , and made its most recent
project a bid to “encourage the definition and prac-
tical application of a form of ‘ world gove rn a n c e ’t h at
meets the challenges of the 21st century.” ■

A s protest movements go,the mass gat h e rings that shou-
ted down trade representat i ves and finance offic i a l s
over the past year in Seat t l e ,Washington and Bang-
kok bore few of the hallmarks of traditional opposition.T h e r e
was no formal hierarchy to speak of, no single nat i o n a l i t y, n o
clear shared cause. In the eyes of one pro-business gr o u p,t h e

Yet though the dive rsity of the groups—from nort h e rn

ve ry va riety stands at the heart of their political project. I n
place of the uniform spread of commercial va l u e s ,d e rided by
leading U. S . campaigner Lori Wallach as a “one size fits all
p h i l o s o p hy,” they plead for new distri bution of power that is
porous enough to allow room for other interests.
“ T h e r e ’s been an invasion in inappropri ate spaces by
u n a c c o u n t a b l e , unalterable trade ru l e s ,” declares Wa l l a c h ,
whose public profile has soared since helping to c o - o r d i n at e
the Seattle protests as director of
the Public Citizen’s Global Tr a d e
Wat c h . “A ve rsion of the rules has
been imposed that has much more
to do with corp o r ate input than
the input from public interest . . . T h at ’s the democracy
d e ficit in the global economy.”
In the eyes of campaigners , the rapid, g ove rn m e n t -
a p p r oved spread of the free market has stripped political
d e b ate of any interest in the virtues that found a good society
or legi t i m ate global order.But the questions remain: h ow can
the corp o r ate bottom line be eclipsed with the least economic
damage? W h at reforms are needed, and where?
According to Walden Bello, e xe c u t i ve director of the
Bangkok-based Focus on the Global South, g l o b a l i z at i o n
must be rescued from its current “ m o n o l i t h i c, u n i f o rm and
u n i ve rsalistic character” t h at has seen transnational corp o-
r ations account for a majority of the wo r l d ’s exports and global
inequality more than double since 1960.
A chief culpri t ,he argues, is “the free market biases of the
f r a m e work pushed by the trinity of the World Trade Orga-
n i z ation (WTO) , the World Bank and the Intern ational Mone-
t a ry Fund (IM F) , which are fundamentally antithetical to the
s o rt of dive rse world that is conducive to equity. It is vital to◗ UNESCO Courier journalist
cut them down to size—make them just ordinary
a c t o rs among a plural set of actors in the global eco-
n o my.”
But the problem, as many activists agr e e , is that
there are scanty fora for these demands to be heard and
acted upon. N ational gove rnments are seen as weak in
the face of global fin a n c e , or in the case of deve l o p i n g
n at i o n s ,h a m s t rung by the obligations of IM F- s p o n s o r e d
debt reduction programmes and foreign aid. B u s i n e s s
itself has no wish to see its wings clipped, while inter-
n ational bodies—from the United Nations to the
WTO ’s infamous “ green room” trade talks, a l l e g e d l y
d o m i n ated by rich nations—appear saddled with unde-
m o c r atic structures and practices.The only way out,
c a m p a i g n e rs argue, is a radical remake of gove rn a n c e .
In the short - t e rm , the pri o rities are clear. For Wa l-
l a c h , the punch-drunk WTO must be swiftly leve l l e d :“ i t ’s
s h rink or sink for the WTO,”she say s.“ M a ny of our cur-
rent env i r o n m e n t a l , l a b o u r
and human rights agr e e-
ments are illegal trade bar-
ri e rs under WTO ru l e s.”
Besides a shrunken trade
o r g a n i z at i o n , activists also call for the wo r l d ’s two
main lending bodies to be stripped of the power to pres-
c ribe standard austerity packages. In Bello’s opinion,
the IM F and World Bank need to be balanced by an
a rr ay of other bodies including regional trading blocs
like AS E A N,strong labour and environmental agencies,
and an official body to represent developing coun-
t ri e s.This would gi ve “more space to take independent
p aths to deve l o p m e n t ,” he argues.
O ver the longer term , the proposals become hazier.
Essentially defensive in nat u r e , few NGOs invo l ved in
the campaign against globalization have drawn up
detailed blueprints for a new world power stru c t u r e .T h e
ideas that have been suggested tend to stress the need
to reinforce global bodies so they can patrol the new
breed of footloose corp o r at i o n s , while bri n ging the

The other face of globalization

for solid gro u n d
◗ Candido Grzybowski
The role of NGOs should be to foster the emergence of a worldwide civil society, the first step
t o w a rds making globalization a more democratic affair
◗ Sociologist,director of
the Institute of Social and
Economic Analysis (IBASE),Rio de
Janeiro, Brazil
NGOs were not born ye s t e r d ay, but the ri s i n g
number of conflicts that have reve r b e r at e d
in recent decades around a world globali-
zed in the neo-liberal mould has led
them to multiply and dive rsify into highly visible
b o d i e s.
Who are the main playe rs in this process of glo-
b a l i z ation? Gove rnments (politics) and the market
(the economy) are the twin pillars supporting the
p r o d u c t i ve systems and structures of modern
s o c i e t i e s. So who has the legi t i m ate right to change
them? The societies themselve s , for they alone
are made up of citizens grouped together as a
p e o p l e , a nation or a country.The right does not
belong to gove rn m e n t s , s t ate  stru c t u r e s , c o rp o-
r ate  exe c u t i ves  or markets. This is why, a s
whole arsenal of global gove rn a n c e : a more demo-
c r atic United Nations to include civil society repre-
s e n t at i ve s , a code of ethics for worldwide bu s i n e s s e s ,
and new global agencies for competition, i nve s t m e n t
and cri m e .
Of all levels of gove rn a n c e ,the nat i o n - s t ate seems the
least favoured by NGOs. Either as a result of the flawe d
d e velopment and environmental destruction forged by
c o u n t ries such as Brazil and India since World War II, o r
as a result of current political fa i l u r e s , few groups favo u r
giving gr e ater powe rs to national exe c u t i ve s. E ven Wa l-
lach is quick to stress that unive rsal trade rules of a
basic anti-tariff nature are essential.
In contrast, s e veral activists in developing countri e s

For some NGOs,h owe ve r ,neither global reform nor
local powe rs are the key to gr e ater equity and sustainable
d e ve l o p m e n t . I n s t e a d , the mission is to educat e ,
enlighten and conve rt , so that the driving force of cor-
p o r ate gr owth —the tastes of each global consumer—
are restrained.“If the world lived like the A m e ricans or

36 The UNESCO Courier - September 2000
N G O s , our attention  is directed at civil society
i t s e l f.
At the global leve l , our basic task is to foster the
emergence of a worldwide civil society as a pre-
condition to calling for a new style of globalizat i o n :
“ world gove rn a n c e .” Our mission is to encou-
rage the re-founding of globalization along more
d e m o c r atic lines by taking part in public debat e
and promulgating the concept of world citizenship.
The political stances we take and our lobbying
a c t i v i t i e s , t h e r e f o r e , do not come out of the blue,
but are efforts to transmit the main currents and
a s p i r ations of public opinion and make this opi-
nion stronger and clearer.
The tripartite
m i ra g e
All NGO actions
are based on a ob-
vious pri o ri t y, n a m e l y
t h at of support i n g
social protests and
public pressure duri n g
major negotiat i o n s
taking place within
the main circles of
p owe r. T h at is why
t h e a greements we
conclude and the
alliances we forge are
a b ove all else aimed
at organizations and
m ovements ari s i n g
from civil society.
T h at is also why we
build foru m s , c o-
alitions and netwo r k s
t h at straddle nat i o n a l
b o r d e rs. On the basis
of our approach, we
can think globally, s e t
up links between the
p a rticular and the
u n i ve rs a l , swap expe-
riences and keep ours e l ves regularly inform e d .
To d ay, global power is monopolized by major
m u l t i l ateral organizat i o n s , and is fundamentally
a n t i - d e m o c r atic in its structure and wo r k i n g s. I n
their current form , these organizat i o n s ’ claims to
embody democracy and unive rsal citizenship ri n g
h o l l ow. In fa c t , their only possible claim to legi t i-
m a cy is through the vo t e . But not all the nat i o n a l
g ove rnments represented in intern ational orga-
n i z ations have been elected by popular suffrage,
and ve ry few of them represent all the different
social forces that go into making up their nat i o n s.
Does this mean that NGOs, which are sup-
posed to embody civil society, should claim to
represent these peoples? Does it mean that our
goal should be to win a place at the heart of a
future new world democratic order? Does it mean
t h at we are fully entitled to a seat in some new tri-
p a rtite structure—made up of gove rn m e n t , c o m-
panies and civil society—that some people are
campaigning for? In my opinion, all of that is just
a mirage; e ven wo rs e , we risk losing sight of our
most useful and most legi t i m ate purpose if we
embrace that vision.
Small players,
big issues
NGOs are not out to conquer power or win
e l e c t i o n s , be they wo r l d ,n ational or local bodies.
We are not set up like political part i e s , e ve n
though our activities are public and seem highly
p o l i t i c i z e d .We cannot even present ours e l ves as
r e p r e s e n t at i ves of civil society because civil
society has not entrusted  us with  any such
m a n d at e .
So what do we want? To reach out, m o b i l i z e ,
e d u c at e , get across
m e s s a g e s , s u g g e s t ,
i n n ovat e ,p e rsuade and
politically strengthen
va rious groups in civil
society and, more spe-
c i fic a l l y, those excluded
from the decision-
making process. We
want to gi ve a voice to
i d e a s , va l u e s ,q u e s t i o n s
and proposals that
i nvo l ve social justice, a
more equitable distri-
bution of we a l t h , r e s-
pect for the env i r o n-
m e n t , the stru g g l e
against pove rty and
social exclusion.
Who are we? Small
p l aye rs , compared to
the other pillars of civil
s o c i e t y, such as trade
unions and profes-
sional organizat i o n s ,o r
bodies in the state or
the market. But we are
also—and this is something new—“big” p l aye rs ,
because our mission and our field of action are not
limited to a gi ven society, n ational economy or
single gove rn m e n t . Our task is to form a bri d g e
b e t ween the local and the global: in other wo r d s ,
to deal with what is unive rs a l , with what is
common to all humanity. Human ri g h t s , s o c i a l
c rises and environmental protection are global
i s s u e s.We deal with them in specific situat i o n s , bu t
our pers p e c t i ve is always planetary.
So where does our legi t i m a cy lie? In the qua-
lity of the va l u e s ,p rinciples and ideals we defend.
In the relevance and the importance of the issues
we raise. In the inve n t i veness of the proposals we
put forwa r d . Our only source of legi t i m a cy is our
ability to develop ideas aimed at action—ideas that
are up to the standards of public duty to which we

especially true in the case of dru g - t a k i n g
(or doping) in sport , which can be seen as
the logical outcome of a perform a n c e -
based type of medical practice. O d d l y
e n o u g h , discussion about doping is gene-
rally reduced to a few clichés: it is branded
as unethical in light of an imagi n a ry spor-
ting ideal. Calls are made for better dru g -
testing and stiffer punishment for “ c h e at s ”
and their accomplices. But this skates ove r
the real issue—the pressures of competi-
tion in sport—and hides it even furt h e r
from the public, d o c t o rs and authori t i e s.
Doping in high-pressure sports can
hardly be equated with reckless or rash
b e h av i o u r. On the contrary, it requires the
conscious invo l vement of the competitor
who personally controls the state of his
or her own body and training.The at h l e t e
is led to take drugs daily to reduce fat i g u e
and to increase muscle powe r , or to recove r
quickly from an injury or excessive trai-
n i n g, for example. The scandal over the
Tour de France bicycle race in 1998
s h owed how ri d e rs knowingly and pers o-
nally take banned substances in order to
endure tough training and back-to-back
races throughout a whole season.
So the real ethical debate rests solely on
medical practice. It means we should refle c t
on how doctors respond to requests from
athletes at all leve l s , for doping is also on
the rise among amat e u rs and children.
The scandal over the Tour de
France bicycle race in 19 9 8
showed how riders knowingly
and personally ta ke banned
s u b s tances in order to endure
tough training and back-to-
back races throughout a whole
s e a s o n .
At the 43rd A m e rican Health
C o n gr e s s , held in Washington in Sep-
tember 1996, Thomas H. M u rr ay, of the
Center for Biomedical Ethics at Case We s-
t e rn Reserve Unive rsity (Cleve l a n d ,O h i o ) ,
recounted how a mother asked for gr ow t h
h o rmones for her son to improve his spor-
ting perform a n c e . There are two fa c t o rs
behind this request. F i rs t , a d vances in
medical biotechnology have made it pos-
sible to produce artificial horm o n e s.
S e c o n d , the dri ve to win draws the doctor
into altering the body to make it perform
b e t t e r.
All medical codes of ethics condemn
d o c t o rs acceding to such requests. T h e
World Medical A s s o c i ation calls on eve ry
doctor to “oppose and
refuse to administer or
c o n d o n e ” methods that
aim at “an unnat u r a l
increase or maintenance
of performance duri n g
c o m p e t i t i o n ” or which
“ a rtificially change fea-
tures appropri ate to age
and sex” (1981 Declara-
tion on Principles of
Health Care for Sport
M e d i c i n e , amended in
1 9 9 9 ) .
Hormone boosts
But many doctors
must still deal with the
consequences of sport i n g
a c t i v i t y. P hy s i o l o gi c a l l y,
s p o rt depletes a pers o n ’s
n atural reserve s ,e s p e c i a l l y
h o rm o n e s. I n t e n s i ve train-
ing for example, uses up
the male hormone testos-
terone faster than the
body replaces it. A doctor
can put an athlete on sup-
plements to make up for
t h at loss, just as iron or
vitamins are prescri b e d
for people lacking them.
So a deficiency in the
body is made up for
without any regard for
w h at might have caused
it in the first place—such
as malnutri t i o n , ove r wo r k
or disease.
We do not yet have a
s e p a r ate branch of medi-
cine dealing with perfor-
m a n c e . So fa r , it is just a
few doctors straying from
the ori ginal purposes of
m e d i c i n e . In the ri c h e s t
c o u n t ries and among the
elites in poor nat i o n s ,
such medicine is in
demand as a medical prop to cope with
the new emphasis placed on perform a n c e
in all spheres of life. This is also ve ry
similar in principle to anti-ageing treat-
m e n t s , where health care is being adjusted
to the fact that people are living longer.
H o rmone replacement therapy in elderly
people is aimed at “ i m p r oving the quality
of life to match the extra number of ye a rs
g a i n e d ,” according to Dr. B runo Deli-
g n i è r e s , head of the endocrinology serv i c e
at the Necker Hospital in Pa ri s. Here too,
h o rmonal adjustment is being prescri b e d
because of progress in life sciences and
p at i e n t s ’ requests for drugs to alleviate the
effects of ageing.The doctor is responding
to a pers o n ’s natural desire to improve
their physical condition. Just like cos-
metic surgery and treatments for impo-
t e n c e , which have been boosted by the
i nvention of the drug V i a gr a , medicine is
t u rning towards satisfying desires, s p u rr e d
by images of well-being and yo u t h .T h e
pressure to get, maintain or preserve an
“ e f fic i e n t ” body and a “ s l i m ” figure is
steadily increasing. The same goes for
reducing pain during childbirt h , old age
and of course in eve ry d ay life, w h i c h

includes sporting activity.
So one might think there is nothing
wrong with prescribing drugs which
i m p r ove the quality of an at h l e t e ’s life,
marked by intense physical activity. F i g h-
ting against stress, r e c ove ring from long-
t e rm fat i g u e , using anti-inflammat o ry
d rugs to reduce pain caused by intense
e xe rtion become normal gi ven social
e x p e c t ations of chemically-assisted we l l -
b e i n g .
But testosterone and related products,
such as nandrolone, are classified as ana-
bolic steroids and are the substances most
frequently detected during drug testing.
When taken in big doses, together with
s u f ficient food and training, t e s t o s t e r o n e
increases body mass, strength and muscle
p ower as well as aggressivity and resis-
tance to fatigue and pain. C o rticoid dru g s
also reduce pain and help a person to tire
less easily. So these substances are ve ry
suitable for easing the physical effects and
p s y c h o l o gical pressures of competitive
s p o rt .
The crucial issue lies in deciding where
medical efforts to restore equilibrium end
and efforts to improve performance begi n .
An art i ficial dividing line has been draw n .
A scale has been devised to measure the
quantity of “ s u p p l e m e n t s.” Medical tests
can now detect if a person has taken
“ u n r e a s o n a b l e ” amounts of substances
t h at are no longer banned, but tolerated up
to a certain point.
The good health riddle
Medical ethics do not require a doctor
to ask whether someone is “ c h e at i n g ”
under the rules of sport . A doctor does not
h ave to take a stand on demands made in
fields other than his ow n .The problem is
h ow to define the state of health that the
doctor aims for, not the level of doping.
The World Medical A s s o c i at i o n ’s Geneva
D e c l a r ation (adopted in 1948 and
amended in 1983) is clear: “The health of
my patient will be my first considera-
t i o n ,” a doctor is supposed to pledge. S o
it naturally condemns “procedures to
mask pain or other protective symptoms
if used to enable the athlete to take part
in an event when lesions or signs are pre-
sent which make his part i c i p ation inad-
v i s a b l e .”
D o c t o rs (in sport or otherwise) who
engage in these practices are not perfor-
ming their duty towards patients (which
i nvo l ves prescribing a halt to painful acti-
vity) but are complying with the demands
of sport . From an ethical standpoint, a
desired performance must not be taken
into account in the course of diagnosis or
t r e at m e n t . Medical ethics condemn any
action dictated by interests or pressures not
r e l ated to the goal of good health.
This is where the debate gets really
t ri c k y, because in modern parlance and
in the language of doping in sport , g o o d
health is understood to mean the absence
of illness or lasting after-effects. H owe ve r ,
since 1940, the World Health Organizat i o n
has defined good health as a combined
s t ate of phy s i c a l , emotional and social
we l l - b e i n g . The Centre for Health Pro-
motion at the Unive rsity of To r o n t o, p o i n t s
out that good health is not an end in itself
but a means to a balanced life.
This makes good health a quest for
well-being based on individual aspirat i o n s
in a particular social and cultural context.
Put this way, it becomes something extre-
mely subjective and changeable according
to the time and place as well as the sex, a g e
and social class of the person invo l ve d .
Each individual decides on the basis of
his or her own life and cultural env i r o n-
ment a relationship to we l l - b e i n g, p a i n
and illness.
S p o rt presents doctors with a paradox .
Most of them believe physical activity
makes for a balanced life. But they are
also well aware that competition upsets
this balance, and that chemical-based treat-
ments can be prescribed to supplement
d e f i c i e n c i e s. If they respond to such
d e m a n d s , they are only reinforcing the
a l i e n ating emphasis put on performance at
all costs, of which sport is just the most
s t riking example.
Science
at the altar
of performance?
But doctors can still, without any
qualms of conscience, refuse to play the
game and deplore the effects of a hectic
life-style imposed by the obligation to
p e r f o rm . Acting in the interest of pat i e n t s ’
we l fare invo l ves teaching them how to
p u rsue a balanced life. A doctor’s duty is
to tell patients why they are ill. If this
can be done without problem where obe-
sity and the dangers of smoking or dri n-
king are concern e d , the same goes where
the dangerous effects of sport are
i nvo l ve d .
S p o rt medicine is a forerunner of the
medicine of the future—a medicine at
the behest of institutions in the bu s i n e s s
of boosting effic i e n cy. It runs the risk of
u s h e ring in a common norm dictat i n g
p e o p l e ’s appearance (through cosmetic
s u r g e ry ) , character (through prenatal dia-
gnosis) and social behav i o u r , n a m e l y
through the demand for performance in
all fie l d s , be it professional, sexual or spor-
t i n g . ■

qualities of the body, the will and the mind by uni-
fying them into a perfectly balanced entity. Uniting
sport, culture and education, Olympism wishes to
create a way of life based on contentment born of
effort, on the educational value of setting the
example and  on the respect of universal ethical prin-
c i p l e s . ”

of prohibited classes of drugs and of banned
methods.” ■

40 The UNESCO Courier - September 2000
You spent three weeks in Kosovo in October
1999 documenting damage to cultural
heritage. What were your main findings?
K o s ovo ’s 600-year-old Islamic heri t a g e
suffered large-scale deva s t ation during the
“ethnic cleansing”o p e r at i o n s.More than one
third of the regi o n ’s 600 mosques were des-
t r oyed or seriously damaged.A standard tech-
nique was to pack the base of the minaret with
e x p l o s i ves so that the stone spire would col-
lapse onto the building and smash the dome.
We found racist anti-Albanian and anti-Isla-
mic gr a fitti inside,Korans with pages ri p p e d
out and smeared with feces, and crosses car-
ved into the mosques’ m i h ra b s [ p r ayer niche].
Valuable collections of Islamic manuscri p t s
were bu rn e d .The 500-year-old mosque and
h i s t o ric centre of Vu c i t rn was set afire and
completely bulldozed by Serb paramilitari e s.
Of Kosovo ’s four we l l - p r e s e rved Ottoman-
era urban centres,only one, P ri z r e n ,e s c a p e d
such deva s t at i o n .
The other gr e at loss are the k u l l a s —s t o n e
mansions typical of Albanian residential archi-
t e c t u r e .They tended to belong to the more
prominent Albanian families and had been in
the same hands for 150-200 ye a rs. As such
they were filled with art i facts and documents
and were regarded as symbols of A l b a n i a n
culture in Kosovo. Barely ten per cent of the
r e gi o n ’s 500 k u l l a s s u rv i ved the wa r.All this
d e m o n s t r ates that the damage was clearly not
c o l l at e r a l . It was ve ry intentional.
There have been allegations that the Serbian
heritage also suffered damage.
As soon as the conflict broke out, B e l gr a-
d e ’s Inform ation Ministry and several conser-
vation institutes claimed that NATO was deli-
b e r ately targetting Serbian pat rimonial sites.
We visited each one of the sites for which
damage was claimed and found these allega-
tions to be unsubstantiat e d .At the end of the
wa r ,K F O R1 troops were stationed to guard
the most famous monasteries and churches.
H owe ve r ,m a ny village churches became easy
targets for revenge by returning Kosovar vil-
l a g e rs.A majority of the attacked bu i l d i n g s
were built in the 20th century, and quite a
large number during the 1990s.These we r e
seen as political monuments and were espe-
cially targetted. Since the end of the wa r ,a s
far as we can tell, about 40 churches have been
badly damaged and 40 vandalized to some
e x t e n t .While most were modern , about a
dozen were genuinely ancient stru c t u r e s.
Where do reconstruction efforts stand? 
The buildings being restored are those that
can be fixed quickly, which means concrete
frame modern bu i l d i n g s. U n f o rt u n at e l y, t h e
UN agencies in charge in Kosovo don’t have
much of a budget for reconstruction projects
and the fate of cultural heritage has not ranked
ve ry high among the intern ational commu-
n i t y ’s concern s. Our Kosovo Cultural Heri-
tage Project recently obtained funding for the
r e c o n s t ruction of three damaged histori c a l
monuments in Kosovo2. Another initiat i ve
enabled the Institute for the Protection of
Monuments of Kosovo to clear the ru b b l e ,
stabilize and cover with plastic sheeting close
to 100 of the most endangered histori c
bu i l d i n g s. In the case of the mosques, S a u d i -
based Islamic aid agencies are bri n ging their
own sectarian agenda to reconstru c t i o n , as it
happened in Bosnia.They notably frown on
all decorations and consider some practices
common elsewhere in the Muslim world to
be ve r ging on the idolat r o u s.
Are the Albanians intent on rebuilding their
heritage at this point? 
There is a tremendous desire to rebu i l d
their own heri t a g e . People are immensely
d e voted to it and that ’s why it was targetted.
But there is a lack of funding, and above all,
a lack of expert i s e .Through our project, we
hope to establish methodologies adapted to
the local context and foster links between local
and foreign professionals. ■

In the former Yugoslavia, the destruction of cultural heritage erased a common identity in cities
and fulfilled an archaic dream in the countryside
t h at generals and politicians are being prose-
cuted by the Intern ational Criminal Tri bunal for
the former Yu g o s l av i a .
Other terms emerged during these wa rs :
“ u r b i c i d e ” to describe the bombing of cities
such as Mostar and Sarajevo in Bosnia and
H e r z e g ov i n a ,and “cultural cleansing” or “ c u l-
tural genocide” to indicate the fate of mosques,
c h u r c h e s ,m u s e u m s ,a r c h i ve s ,l i b r a ri e s ,s c h o o l s ,
and so on. I n e v i t a b l y, these terms were part of
a propaganda wa r , but all too often, t h e y
r e flected the new landscapes of Croat i a ,B o s n i a
and Herzegov i n a ,and more recently,of Kosovo.
The deliberate destruction in wa rtime of
cultural heritage is no historical nove l t y.S o m e-
times destruction has been an affair of pillagi n g

In 1991, in the early days of the Cold
Wa r ’s end, We s t e rn Europeans we r e
shaken by television images of a dow n p o u r

f o rmer Yu g o s l avia were subjected to wa r.W h i l e
m o d e r ate commentat o rs referred to a cam-
paign of “ethnic cleansing,” those targeted by
the violence spoke of “ g e n o c i d e .” It is precisely
on this count and for crimes against humanity
for profit , at others it has been part of the
widely recognized right to annihilate the

t own centres were reduced to rubble out of
m i l i t a ry necessity.D u ring World War II, l a r g e
G e rman urban centres disappeared as part
of strat e gic “area bombing” by Common-
wealth airforces.
But there are other reasons.The phy s i c a l
genocide of Europe’s Jews by the Nazis wa s
accompanied by a cultural genocide—the des-
t ruction of synagogues, c e m e t e ries and other
landmarks and treasures.
In the case of the former Yu g o s l av i a , t h e

T HE MOS TAR BRIDGE :
REBIRTH OF AN EMBL EM 
It took no more than 30 minutes for Stari Most
(“The Old Bridge”), the emblematic symbol of
Mostar’s multicultural past, to be destroyed by
bombardment from a Croatian army tank on
November 9, 1993. Completed in 1566 after nine
years of work, the bridge, designed by the Ottoman
architect Mimar Hayruddin, once rose high above
the emerald waters of the Neretva, connecting its
east and  west banks. 
The 29-metre-long stone arch bridge, a World
Heritage site, gave the town its name and stimulated
its blossoming from a tiny medieval settlement to a
thriving trading centre that attracted merchants and
t ravellers from across the region. This is where loca l
couples romanced and young men dove into the
river below in a famed annual contest. At the out-
break of the war, inhabitants cushioned the bridge
with car tyres in an attempt to protect the struc-
ture. It was first damaged in 1992 by Yugoslav Army
shelling.
As soon as the bridge was destroyed, loca l
architects and heritage experts who had fled the city
started building a network to plan the reconstruc-
tion. In 1997, Hungarian military divers from the
NATO-led peackeeeping force in Bosnia salvaged
the bridge’s stone blocks from the river bed and
hoisted them from the water with technical assis-
tance from the Hungarian bridge building com-
pany Hídépítö Rt. In 1998, UNES CO, the World Bank
and the City of Mostar launched a project to rebuild
the bridge. Due to extensive damage, less of the sal-
vaged stonework will be reused than expected and
stones will likely be extracted from a nearby quarry
used by Stari Most’s builders.
And Mostarians are already preparing to see
their city’s emblem resurrected. More precisely,
the party begins on September 15, 2004 at 5 p.m.,
a date chosen in the midst of the war by Mostarian
architects whose life work is now dedicated to
rebuilding their town. ■
reminds us that sacral buildings have been
d e s t r oyed time and time again in the Balkans.
The longstanding belief that the Ottoman
a rm i e s , in the 15th century, were gentle with
C h ristian heritage might well be a my t h .L at e r ,
in the 19th century, the conquering Hapsbu r g
a rmies and Catholic administrat o rs in Croat i a
t u rned a handful of mosques into churches and
d e s t r oyed the rest.More recently,d u ring Wo r l d
War II, m a s s i ve destruction of Serbian
O rt h o d ox churches was carried out in Croat i a
and parts of Bosnia and Herzegovina by the fa s-
cist Ustasha forces. Ruins in Eastern Slavo n i a
and Krajina,prominently Serb areas of Croat i a ,
stand as tangible reminders of this peri o d .
But the more recent events are of a sin-
gularly different nat u r e .We are not referring to
foreign powe rs invading a terri t o ry and swe e-
ping aside eve rything in their wa k e .We are in
the presence of old societies which were to
some extent integr at e d , but in the process of
breaking up.The Serbian inhabitants of Croa-
tian Krajina were not newcomers to the regi o n
in 1991. C r o at s , Muslims and Serbs have
l i ved together in Bosnia and Herzegov i n a
since the 16th century.And more recently, i n
the 20th century,m i xed marriages in cities and
t owns played a significant role in we aving the
social fa b ri c. In the country s i d e ,where people
often settled by ethnic belongi n g, the situat i o n
was different. A c c o r d i n g l y, d u ring the wa r ,
when Muslims, C r o at s , Serbs or Kosova r
Albanians were chased out of their villages
while their mosques and churches were mined
or bu rn e d , it was the “other”—“the forei-
gner”—who was being removed from the
r e gi o n .The public dream of the nat i o n a l i s t s
(and sometimes the unavowed secret dream of
the villagers) was thus fulfil l e d : to be finally at
p e a c e , alone among our own people. T h e
mythical pure rural world was creat e d .
In the cities and towns of Bosnia and Her-
z e g ov i n a , d e s t ruction had a different signifi-
c a n c e . It was common to hear in Sarajevo
and Mostar that synagogues, C h ri s t i a n
churches and mosques are only 100 metres
from each other.This may not in fact be tru e ,
but in people’s minds, it wa s.The cities enjoye d
gr e at religious foundations and were home
to the finest Ottoman sacral heri t a g e .A sense
of integr ation had developed through a
common attachment to places and shared
s p a c e s.The coexistence of religious traditions
p r ovided people with a common sense of
ow n e rship of sacral heri t a g e .S e r b s ,M u s l i m s
and Croats also took equal pride in their
secular bu i l d i n g s , such as the Sarajevo Nat i o n a l
and Unive rsity Library.
“Ethnicized” herita g e
All this was profoundly changed by wa r.
Although we perceive destruction as barbari c,
it is seen as an act of creation in the eyes of its
p e rp e t r at o rs. In the countryside of Croat i a
and Bosnia and Herzegov i n a , it was the crea-
tion—or the liberation—of a mythical ru r a l
s o c i e t y, with the symbols of the unwa n t e d
other—his minarets or church steeples—eli-
m i n ated from the hori z o n .But in the cities of
Bosnia and Herzegov i n a , a common civic
identity was destroye d , and along with it, t h e
“ o t h e r ” inside the people. Secular and sacral
h e ritage became ethnicized: before the wa r ,
nobody in Mostar would have said that the Old
B ridge was a “ M u s l i m ” m o n u m e n t . Its des-
t ruction by Croat tanks turned it into one. I n
Bosnia and Herzegov i n a , the impove ri s h m e n t
of the post-war cities is appalling, not simply
because they are largely emptied of another
ethnic group or of gr e at sacral bu i l d i n g s.T h e
s u rviving bu i l d i n g s , e ven intact, are simply
ghosts from another age: the “ o t h e r ” has been
e l i m i n ated at all leve l s , inside people and out-
side on the streets.
In this context, the restoration and rebu i l-
ding of cultural heritage can take on political
and dow n right divisive dimensions: it is no
longer a question of rebuilding what was held
in common, but only “ w h at was ours.” T h e
technical problems of reconstruction are infi-
nitely less important than the “ d e - e t h n i c i z a-
t i o n ” of heri t a g e , and it is difficult to imagi n e
h ow the Balkan societies will be able to ove r-
come this problem.The only hope of restori n g
a once commonly held landscape lies in a
commitment to do so by the ethnic or nat i o n a l
group that carried out the cri m e s. ■

Children have always used their toys
and playthings to create models for
u n d e rstanding their wo r l d . Fifty ye a rs
ago, the genius of Swiss psychologist Jean
Piaget showed it is the business of childhood
to take objects and use how they “ wo r k ”t o
construct theories of space,time,number,
c a u s a l i t y, life and mind. At that time, a
c h i l d ’s world was full of things that could be
understood in simple, mechanical ways. A
b i cycle could be understood in terms of its
pedals and gears, a windup car in terms of
its clockwork springs. Children were able
t o take electronic devices such as basic
radios and (with some difficulty) bring them
into this “mechanical” system of unders-
tanding.
Revisiting Merlin
But in the early 1980s, a first generat i o n
of computer toys changed the traditional
story.When children removed the back of
their computer toys to “ s e e ” h ow they
worked, they found a chip, a battery, and
some wires. Sensing that trying to unders-
tand these objects “physically” would lead
to a dead end,children tried to use a “psy-
c h o l o gi c a l ” kind of unders t a n d i n g . T h e y
asked themselves if the games we r e
conscious, if they had feelings and even if
they knew how to “cheat.” Earlier objects
encouraged children to think in terms of a
distinction between the world of psychology
and the world of machines, but the com-
puter did not. Its “ o p a c i t y ” e n c o u r a g e d
children to see computational objects as
psychological machines.
Among the first generation of compu-
t ational objects was Merlin, which chal-
lenged children to games of tic-tac-toe. Fo r

playing with his friends on the beach, wat-
ched his friend Craig perform the “ w i n-
ning tri c k ,” but when he tried it, M e r l i n
did not slip up and the game ended in a
draw.
R o b e rt , confused and fru s t r at e d ,t h r e w
Merlin into the sand and said,“Cheater. I
hope your brains break.” He was ove r h e a r d
by Craig and Greg, aged six and eight, w h o
s a l vaged the by-now ve ry sandy toy and
took it upon themselves to set Robert
s t r a i g h t . “Merlin doesn’t know if it cheat s ,”
s ays Craig. “It doesn’t know if you break it,
R o b e rt . I t ’s not alive .” Greg adds, “ I t ’s
smart enough to make the right kinds of
n o i s e s. But it doesn’t really know if it loses.
And when it cheats it don’t even know it’s
c h e at i n g .” Je n ny, s i x ,i n t e rrupts with disdain:
“Greg, to cheat you have to know you are
cheating.Knowing is part of cheating.”
In the early 1980s such scenes were not
u n u s u a l . Confronted with objects that
s p o k e ,s t r at e gized and “ wo n ,” children we r e
led to argue the moral and metaphy s i c a l
s t atus of machines on the basis
of their psychologies: did the
machines know what they we r e
doing? Despite Jenny’s objec-
tions that “ k n owing is part of
c h e at i n g,” children did come to
see computational objects as exhi-
biting a kind of know i n g . By doing
s o, they recast the Piagetian framewo r k
in which a definition of life centred around
“moving of one’s own accord.”
Observing children in the world of the
“traditional”—that is non-computional—
o b j e c t s , Piaget found that at first they consi-
dered eve rything that moved to be alive .
Then only things that moved without an
outside push or pull. Gradually, children
refined the notion to mean “life motions,”
namely only those things that breathed and
grew were taken to be alive.
Motion gives way
to emotion
Children broke with this orderly cate-
g o ri z ation by making distinctions about
“machines that think.” Their discussions
about the computer’s aliveness came to
centre on what the children perceived as the
computer’s psychological rather than phy-
sical properties. To put it simply, motion
gave way to emotion and physics gave way
to psychology as criteria for aliveness.
In the 1980s, the computational objects
t h at evoked “ a rt i ficial life” (the “ S i m ”s e ri e s ,
for example, assigns the task of creating a
functioning ecosystem or city) strained that
order to the breaking point. Children still
t ried to impose strat e gies and cat e g o ri e s , bu t
they did so in the manner of theoretical
b ri c o l e u rs , or tinkerers , making do with
whatever materials were at hand and with
a ny theory that fit a prevailing circum-
s t a n c e . When children confronted these
new objects and tried to construct a t h e o ry
about what is alive , we were able to s e e
them cycling through theories of “ a l i ve-
ness.”
“Sort of alive”
robots
An eleven-year-old named Holly wat-
ched a group of robots with “ o n b o a r d ”
c o m p u t ational intelligence nav i g ate a maze.
As the robots used different strategies to
reach their goal, Holly commented on their
“personalities”and “cuteness.” She finally
came to speculate on the robots’ “ a l i ve-
ness” and blurted out an unexpected for-
mulation:“It’s like Pinocchio [the story of
a puppet brought to life]. First Pinocchio
was just a puppet. He was not alive at all.
Then he was an alive puppet.Then he was
an alive boy. A real boy. But he was alive
e ven before he was a real boy. So I think the
robots are like that . They are alive like
Pinocchio but not like real boy s.” S h e
cleared her throat and summed up:“They
are sort of alive.”
Robbie, a ten-year-old who has been
gi ven a modem for her birt h d ay, put the
emphasis on mobility when she consi-
dered whether the creat u r e s
s h e has evo l ved while
c r e ating a vir-
tual ecosystem
through the
game SimLife
were alive.“I
think they are
a little alive in
the game, but
you cannot
s ave your game [when you turn it off], so that
all the creatures you have evo l ved go away. B u t
if they could figure out how to get rid of that
p a rt of the programme so that you wo u l d
h ave to save the game and if your modem
were on, then they [the creatures] could get
out of your computer and go to A m e ri c a
Online [an Internet Service Provider].”
The resurfacing of motion (Piaget’s
classical criterion for how a child decides
whether a “ t r a d i t i o n a l ” object is alive) is
n ow bound up with notions of a presumed
p s y c h o l o g y : children are most likely to
assume that the creatures in Sim games
h ave a desire to “get out” of the system
and evo l ve in a wider computational wo r l d .
Through the 1990s, children still spoke
easily about fa c t o rs which encouraged them
to see the “ s t u f f” of computers as the same
“stuff” of which life is made. I observed a
group of seve n - year-olds playing with a set
of plastic transformer toys that can take
the shape of armoured tanks, r o b o t s , o r
people.The transformers can also be put
into intermediate states so that a “robot”
arm can protrude from a human form or a
human leg from a mechanical tank. Two
of the children are playing with the toys,
mixing human and machine parts. A third
child insists that this is not right.The toys,
he say s , should not be placed in hy b ri d
s t at e s. “ You should play them as all tank or
all people.”An eight-year-old girl comfort s
the now upset third child. “ I t ’s okay to play
them when they are in-between.It’s all the
same stuff,” she said,“just yucky computer
‘cy-dough-plasm.’”
This comment reflects a cy b o r g
consciousness among today ’s children: a
tendency to see computer systems as “sort
of” alive, to fluidly cycle through various
e x p l a n at o ry concepts, and to willingly trans-
gress boundaries.
Feelings for
Furby
Most recently, the transgressions have
involved relationships with “virtual pets”
and digital dolls (the first and most popular
of these were Tamagotchis and Furbies)
which raise new questions about the boun-
d a ries of what children consider as life.
What these objects have that earlier com-
p u t ational objects did not is that they ask the
child for nurturance.They ask the child to
assess the object’s “state of mind”in order
to develop a successful relationship with
the object. For example, in order to grow
and be healthy, Tamagotchis (imagi n a ry
c r e atures “ h o u s e d ” in small screened
devices) need to be fed, cleaned and
a m u s e d . Going a step furt h e r , the furry
electronic pets called Furbies simulate lear-
ning and lov i n g .They are cuddly, they speak
and play games with the child. Furbies add
the dimensions of human-like conve rs a-
tion and tender companionship to the mix
of what children can anticipate from com-
putational objects. In my research on chil-
dren and Furbies, I have found that when
children play with these new objects they
want to know their “ s t at e ,” not to get some-
thing “ ri g h t ,” but to make the Furbies
h a p p y. Children want to understand Furby
language, not to “win” in a game over the
F u r b i e s , but to have a feeling of mutual
r e c o g n i t i o n .They do not ask how the objects
“ wo r k ,” they take the affectively charged
toys “at interface value.”
In my previous research on children
and computer toys,children described the
life-like status of machines in terms of their
c o g n i t i ve capacities (the toys could “ k n ow ”

t h i n g s ,“ s o l ve ”p u z z l e s ) . In my more recent
s t u d i e s , children describe the new toy s ,
Furbies, as “sort of alive,” which reflects
their emotional attachments to the toys and
their fantasies that the Furby might be emo-
tionally attached to them.When asked whe-
ther the Furbies are alive , children tend
not to speak about what the toy can do and
focus instead on their feelings for the “ p e t ”
and how it might feel about them.
Emotional vulnerability
“Well, the Furby is alive for a Furby,”
says Ron, six. “And you know, something
this smart should have arm s. It might wa n t
to pick up something or hug me.” Kathe-
ri n e , age five ,a s k s : “Is it alive? We l l , I love it.
It’s more alive than a Tamagotchi because
it sleeps with me. It likes to sleep with me.”
Je n , age nine, focuses not on what the object
offers her, but what she can do for it. “I
really like to take care of it.So, I guess it is
alive, but it doesn’t need to really eat, so it
is as alive as you can be if you don’t eat. A
Furby is like an ow l . But it is more alive than
an owl because it knows more and you can
talk to it. But it needs batteries so it is not
an animal. It’s not like an animal kind of
alive.”
Today’s children are learning to distin-
guish between an “animal kind of alive ”
and a “Furby kind of alive .”The cat e g o ry of
“sort of alive” becomes increasingly used.
Pe r c e i ved intelligence or “ k n ow i n g ” is ano-
ther key distinction.
Over the past five decades, research in
a rt i ficial intelligence has not even come
close to creating a machine as intelligent as
a person. But it has succeeded in contri-
buting to a certain deflation of our lan-
guage in terms of how we use the wo r d
i n t e l l i g e n c e . It is now commonplace to talk
about intelligent machines when we really
are talking about machines that play chess
or assess mortgage applicat i o n s.These feat s
are wo n d r o u s , but intelligence used to mean
a gr e at deal more than that .We now face the
prospect of a similar deflation of language
in talking about affect and emotion. Chil-
dren talk about an “animal kind of alive”
and a “Furby kind of alive.”Will they also
talk about a “people kind of love” and a
“computer kind of love”? 
These questions bring us to a different
world from the old “AI [art i ficial intelligence]
d e b at e s ” of the 1960s to 1980s in which
r e s e a r c h e rs argued about whether machines
could be “ r e a l l y ”i n t e l l i g e n t .The old debat e
was essentialist. The new objects sidestep
such arguments about what is inherent in
them and play instead on what they evoke in
u s : when we are asked to care for an object,
when this cared-for object thri ves and offers
us its attention and concern , we experi e n c e
it as intelligent, but more import a n t , we feel
a connection to it.The old AI debates we r e
about the technical abilities of machines.T h e
new ones will be about the emotional vulne-
rabilities of people. ■

Nearly everyone is familiar with the United
Nations Children’s Fund through its greeting
cards. Yet the activities of this 1965 Nobel Pe a c e
Prize laureate go far beyond Christmas fund-ra i-

far cry from its original mandate in 1946 to meet
the emergency needs of children in post-war
Europe and China.
Today, the organization continues to provide

T IM BERNERS - L EE :
T HE WEB’S BRA INCHIL D
A staunch idealist, the British inventor of the World Wide Web is worth more than his weight
in gold. Tim Berners-Lee has shunned opportunities in the private sector to captain an
international consortium grouping the Web’s who’s who. His foremost goal: to keep on
improving the Web for the common good.
How do you account for the Web’s formidable
growth in the last 10 years?
The Web initially spread because of exis-
ting Internet infrastructure set up during the
1970s. By the time I had the idea for the
Web at the end of the 80s, computers in
m a ny unive rsities and institutes in the
United States and in Europe were already
connected to each other by cables exchan-
ging inform at i o n . So you have to gi ve credit
to those pioneers who put together such a
network before the Web’s arrival.
The Web spread fast because it wa s
decentralized and no one was controlling its
growth.The fact that anybody can start a
server or run a browser,without having to
register with any central authority, is what
a l l owed it to gr ow rapidly.There were enthu-
siasts all over the world who realized what
the world could be with the Web and
directed their efforts at developing it.
Also the Web’s openness is a powerful
at t r a c t i o n . E ve ryone can not only read
what’s on the Web but can also contribute
to it. Everybody is in a sense equal.This
sense of boundless opportunity also led to
its remarkable growth.
Does the Web stand to benefit those traditionally
on the margins of technological innovation?
It is obvious that the present imbalance
in society is unhealthy for the whole wo r l d .
But do not look to innovations alone for sol-

ving global issues. It is for people to make
decisions on how to manage themselve s
and it requires a lot of effort on all sides to
s o l ve va rious problems. We ’ ve had many
tools in the past and Internet can be another
tool in addressing those challenges.
The basic idea of the Web is that it is an
i n f o rm ation space through which people
can communicate, but communicate in a
special way, by sharing their knowledge in
a pool.The Web is more of a social creat i o n
than a technical one. It has not changed any-
thing fundamentally in the way human
beings think, read and communicate with
each other. It has gi ven people gr e at e r
choice than ever before by simply prov i-
ding information. Advantages of the Web
range from enhanced collaboration bet-
ween people in different countries to reading
a newspaper sitting in a remote village.
Though the Web has gi ven us many
c h o i c e s , we still don’t know how to use
those choices to our advantage. I hope the
fact that each individual has more choice
now will give us greater power to reformu-
late our society.
In your book Weaving the Web, you talk
about the danger of the Web being controlled
by a select group of companies or commercial
deeds blocking its growth. What would the
consequences be?
The danger is when large companies
t h at sell computers and software effective l y
s t a rt to control what inform ation you receive
on the Intern e t . Companies which offer free
c o m p u t e rs or Web brow s e rs could prevent a
user from utilizing or accessing progr a m m e s
of their commercial  competitors. E ve n
Internet Service Providers (ISPs) can have
commercial deals with certain Web sites,
making them easier to access than other
sites.This is already starting to happen.
On the one hand, people feel it’s reaso-
nable for a company to influence yo u r
I n t e rnet access if they provide you with
free computers and software progr a m m e s.
But on the other, it’s really important that
the right of the individual to access unbiased
i n f o rm ation be upheld.The point is that one
should not masquerade the other.
I’m not sure to what extent people rea-
lize or can measure whether their at t e m p t s
to access different websites are being
affected by commercial concerns. It’s also
ve ry difficult to find a balance between the
right of a company to offer a service which
is subsidized and the right of somebody to
h ave unbiased access.We have yet to find a
good social arrangement
Another danger is that if a company
establishes a monopoly, it will start making
arbitrary changes to universally accepted
Web standards.This would force competi-
t o rs to concentrate their efforts on mat-
ching these rather than coming out with
new, bright ideas to improve the product.
This would affect the Web’s overall deve-
lopment.
The Web has allowed a much greater flow of
information which some countries are seeking
to regulate and control. How do you react to
this?
I know that some countries are contem-
plating or attempting to control informa-
tion available to individuals on the Intern e t .
My feeling is that it is ve ry difficult to
a c h i e ve because the Internet allows infor-
m ation to flow in many different way s.Yo u
are only a small hole in this vast system. I n
a way, controlling or regulating inform at i o n
is bad for the relationship between a
g ove rnment and the people and, in the
long term,for the stability of the country.
There have also been calls for wides-
pread censorship on the net. But in most of
the Western world, censorship is a deroga-
tory term for one body trying to control
what information another body has access
t o. H owe ve r , there is a gr owing recogni-
tion that parents have the right and the
duty to protect their children from viewing
undesirable sites.This led our Web Consor-
tium to develop systems like the Platform
for Internet Content Selection (PICS) that
enables adults to control children’s access
to different websites.
The large number of filtering software
tools on the market are more effective than
g ove rnment censors h i p.A nat i o n ’s laws can
r e s t rict content only in that country bu t
fil t e rs can block content no matter where it
comes from on the Web. Fundamentally, it
is for the people to determine the type of
social mechanisms and regulations that will
benefit society.
There have been rising concerns over surfers’
privacy. How is this being tackled?

CI T IZ EN TIM
In a field churning out dot.com millionaires
e v e ry other week, Tim Berners-Lee stands in a
league apart. The London-born and ra i s e d
B e r n e r s - Lee could easily have become one of the
world’s wealthiest men by commercializing his
invention. Instead, he chose to focus his efforts
on improving and universalizing the We b .
A physics graduate from Oxford University ,
B e r n e r s - Lee started working for the Geneva-
based CERN (European Particle Physics
L a b o ra t o ry) in 1980 where he wrote a
p r o g ramme called E n q u i re that could store and
r e call information based on random associations.
That set the tone for the future development
o f the World Wide Web, which he invented in
l a t e 19 9 0 .
B e r n e r s - Lee wrote the HTML (HyperTe x t
Markup Language) establishing links with other
documents in a computer and designed an
addressing scheme that gave each web page a
unique location, or URL (Universal Resource
Lo cator). Then he developed a set of rules ca l l e d
H TTP (Hypertext Transfer Protocol) for
t ransferring information across the Net. In 19 91,
he made the programmes freely available for
Internet users across the globe. For the next tw o
years, he continued working on improving the
design of the Web with feedback from Internet
users. 
After leaving CERN in 1994, Berners-Le e
headed for the Massachusetts Institute of
Te c h n o l o gy’s (MIT) Labora t o ry for Computer
Sciences in Boston, where he is director of the
World Wide Web Consortium (W3C). The
organization, which is comprised by more than
300 members from the global industry including
giants like Microsoft and IBM, sets technica l
standards for the Web. 
Hailed by T i m e magazine as one of the 10 0
greatest minds of the 20th century, the 45-year-
old Berners-Lee remains a paragon of modesty
despite the astonishing growth and success of his
invention. Sitting in his office at the W3C, he
asserts that the Web is just in its infancy. ‘‘The
ultimate goal is to support and improve our web-
like existence in the world,’’ he says, explaining
that the Web offers an unprecedented means to
achieve greater freedom and social growth. “We
are a still a long way from realizing its full
p o t e n t i a l . ” ■

person to dictate what can and cannot be
done with his or her own personal infor-
m at i o n . For consumers using the Intern e t ,
the gr e atest pri va cy concern is that after
t h e y ’ ve ordered a number of products, c o m-
panies will have accumulated enough per-
sonal inform ation to harm or take adva n t a g e
of them.With consequences ranging from
junk mail to the denial of health insurance,
the problem is serious.
Users should be aware of how various
websites use their personal inform at i o n .I n
a way, p ri va cy concerns are a leading impe-
diment to the further gr owth of We b - b a s e d
c o m m e r c e , but I think sites should highlight
the need for consumer privacy.With these
c o n c e rns in mind, our Consortium has
d e veloped a new tool called P3P (Plat f o rm
for Privacy Preferences Project). It would
a u t o m atically communicate to users a we b-
site’s stated privacy policy and compare it
with the user’s own pre-set policy prefe-
r e n c e s. If a Web site’s pri va cy policy does not
suit the user’s interests,they can stop then
and there.
A responsible website should have a pri-
va cy policy at the bottom of the home page.
Failing that, I believe there ought to be a
legally enforced default policy that offers
individuals the highest protection.The issue
of privacy has been addressed to a certain
extent in Europe where companies have to
keep secure the information they hold on
c u s t o m e rs , and are barred from combining
d atabases in ways that are legal in the
United Stat e s. M a ny people in the U. S .a r e
starting to realize the need for more regu-
lation of privacy and the need for greater
protection of the individual and society.
There has been a spurt of Internet-related
patents in recent years. What effect are these
having on the Web’s development?
The awarding of Intern e t - r e l ated pat e n t s
poses a danger to the We b ’s unive rs a l i t y
and can kill good ideas.There was a widely
held assumption in the We b ’s first five ye a rs
t h at a common good was to be gained from
putting together a far-reaching infrastruc-
t u r e . N ow a huge amount of business is
being done on the We b. The ability to
control any part of it through patent claims
will be very lucrative. In some cases busi-
nesses may be able to gain money simply by
threatening to take legal action.This has a
dampening effect on people working toge-
ther to create a universal Web.
For example, people in the WWW pro-
fession meet often to discuss technological
i m p r ovements and innovat i o n s , f r o m
i m p r oved graphic or video conferencing
systems to ways of wiring the deve l o p i n g
world.These projects have the potential to
b e n e fit many people but are sometimes sud-
denly abandoned because of fears or
ru m o u rs of legal action from a company
h aving patent claims to that technology.
C u rr e n t l y, in the U. S . (unlike in many other
c o u n t ri e s ) , it is possible to patent part of
the way a programme does something.
Some of the recent Intern e t - r e l at e d
p atent awards have been derided by the
Web community. They are effectively res-
tricting the use of technologies that could
expand the use and unive rsality of the
I n t e rn e t . I hope that ve ry soon patents will
only be considered valid if they represent a
real novelty or a really bright idea. I have ye t
to see a patent like this in the field.
There is no way to judge the authenticity or
reliability of information on the Web, making
users highly vulnerable. Is this likely to
change?
We are not using all the technology ava i-
lable to verify the authenticity of a website
or a person you come across. M o r e
a d vanced tools will soon be introduced.
With the help of new brow s e rs and by using
digital signatures, you will soon be able to
actually ensure that the document or the
website you are referring to was in fa c t
g e n e r ated by its claimed author.With regard
Surfing the Web in a Dakar slum is a rare luxury on the African continent, where only 3.5 inhabitants out of 1,000 have access to the Internet, compared with 14.1

use to access it. If you analyze the recent
v i rus at t a c k s , you’ll find it’s computers ru n-
ning the same software produced by the
same company that are usually coming
under attack by hackers. While it’s advan-
tageous to have many people running the
same software, there is a need for alterna-
tive types of products in order to build up
resistance to virus attacks.
There have been proposals that Internet users
in developed countries be taxed in order to
wire the rest of the world?
I do think that the developed wo r l d
owes a gr e at debt to the developing one
and Internet access adds one line to that
debt. However, it is not obvious whether
taxing all Internet users in general is a smart
idea. It has to be done on a selective basis.
I feel that those who can afford large
amounts of Internet access—those for ins-
tance who are in position to get videos-on-
demand or use the Web extensively for com-
mercial purposes—can be taxed.
One could also argue that introducing a
tax might discourage some countries from
i nvesting in the Intern e t , which is deve l o p i n g
so rapidly right now.The only place where
you could gi ve serious thought to a tax is the
U. S . , and perhaps Finland. Other deve-
loped countri e s ,which are trying to catch up
with the U. S . , m ay be a bit reluctant to
to electronic messages, new and secure
c o m m u n i c ation protocols allow us to make
sure that nobody can sneak in and alter a
message along its way.
Now the question is how do you know
whether a particular document or person
you come across while surfing on the net is
reliable.You just can’t do that.There is no
i n f r a s t ructure set up at the moment by
which you can actually check the reliability
of a person or of a site you are visiting.W hy
should you believe in somebody about
whom you have never heard of? I think
people will have to learn whom they can
trust on the Web.
Take a book for example. You read it
because it was referred to you by reliable
s o u r c e s. In the same way somebody yo u
k n ow may point to a web site.Trust is alway s
t r a n s f e rred from one individual to another.
We have to set up a “Web of trust.”
Some people initially thought of the
Web as an anonymous space separated from
reality in which there was no individual
responsibility.This is not the case.Anyone
who sends a fraudulent message is sitting
somewhere and is naturally subjected to
local laws. If someone makes forged tran-
sactions, the fact that they did it electroni-
cally doesn’t in any way absolve them of
their responsibility under the law.
Thanks to the Web, the world has become a
global village. But we have recently witnessed
a rising incidence of hackers paralyzing public
utility systems with viruses. Can systems
become more resilient?  
While the Internet is a decentralized
s y s t e m , I think the principle danger it fa c e s
now is the lack of diversity in the tools we

c u l t u r e . E ven in European countri e s , i t
was difficult for the Web to get start e d
because you didn’t have a huge monocul-
ture or monolingual audience waiting eve-
ry w h e r e . Getting over this barrier in coun-
tries with smaller linguistic audiences will
be very difficult.
Could you elaborate on the “Semantic Web”
you are working on at the moment?
My dream for the Web has two part s. I n
the first, I see the Web becoming a much
more powerful means for collaborat i o n
among people. In the second, c o l l a b o r a-
tions extend to computers. M a c h i n e s
become capable of analyzing all the data on
the Web — the contents, links and transac-
tions between people and computers.
The Semantic Web would be able to
take inform ation from different databases on
the We b , from catalogues and we ather sites
to stock price inform at i o n , and to allow
this data to be processed by computers. At
the moment, this cannot be done because
the data available on the Web is not in a form
t h at can be understood or conve rted by
c o m p u t e rs for direct analysis. This is
because the Web pages are designed only for
human readership.
The Semantic Web would also answer
many people’s prayers for a logical search
engine that gives you solid results. Right
now, search engines come up with thou-
sands of Web pages in response to a request.
It is impossible to search what ’s in all those
pages. With the Semantic Web, the search
engine would go out and say “Well,here is
an object which I can mat h e m atically prove
to you matches the criteria requested.” In
s h o rt , search engines will become more
meaningful and effective . Once the two -
part dream is achieved, the Web will be a
place where the whim of a human being and
the reasoning of a machine will co-exist in
an ideal, powerful mixture. ■

introduce taxation.
It is still difficult to get an Internet connection
in the South because of the lack of telephone
lines.  Are there solutions to this?
Te l e c o m m u n i c ations departments in
m a ny developing countries are still bu r e a u-
c r atic and would never agree to shari n g
a nything with anybody or to allow any com-
petition that would improve access. O n e
option is to rethink the technology altoge-
ther.We should start off by expanding the
use of wireless technologies for basic com-
munications in rural areas. Once networks
h ave been built up, walkie-talkies could
e ventually be merged with the Intern e t
without any input from telecommunica-
tion ministri e s. The system would be a
decentralized one in which there would be
no need to apply for an Internet address or
a domain name. Research is already going
on in this field and I strongly feel that com-
mercial production of this technology
should start soon to expand Internet access
in Southern countries.
H owe ve r , it may be difficult for this
technology to be deployed in some countri e s
because it would threaten the existing
monopoly of telecommunication compa-
nies or government control over commu-
n i c at i o n s.The United Nations could play a
role in spreading the idea among its member
S t ates as this technology offers ve ry exciting
possibilities.
I also think subsidies should be put
t owards translating inform ation on the
I n t e rnet into different languages. It is

cultures and not just broadcast American

T HE NET
A ND THE WEB
A s Berners-Lee puts it, the Web could
not exist without the Net. First developed
for military purposes by the U.S. Department
of Defence in the 1960s, the Internet is
a network of networks. It refers to millions
of computers around the world connected
to each other by telephone wire, cable and
satellite. The Web, a part of the Internet,
is a worldwide collection of text and
multimedia files linked to each other via a
system of hypertext documents. The Hypertext
Transfer Protocol (HTTP) was created by
Berners-Lee in 1990 at CERN, the European
Particle Physics Laboratory, as a means of
sharing scientific data internationally, instantly
and inexpensively. With hypertext, a word or
phrase can contain a link to another text.
To achieve this, Berners-Lee developed a
programming language called HTML,
which allows users to easily link to other
pages or network services on the Web. ■
