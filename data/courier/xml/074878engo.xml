Mayan stela
This sculpture of a figure in ceremonial dress, surrounded by hieroglyphs and other motifs,
is a detail from a Mayan stone stela found in the jungles of Guatemala in the Department of
Peten. It is executed with the vitality and lavish detail characteristic of Mayan stone
carving. The stela dates from around 850 A.D. and was discovered in the ruins of Seibal,
one of the remarkable cities built by the Mayas in Central America and southern Mexico.

Urban development in the name
of "progress' is today threatening
the heart of many ancient cities
with destruction. Unesco has been
waging an international campaign
for many years to save these
irreplaceable buildings and
quarters and has advocated that,
instead of being demolished,
the architectural treasures of
the world's historic cities
be given new uses and be adapted
where possible to the needs
of modern life. Left, two figures

Integrating historic sites
into modern urbanism
THE preservation of historic
towns and sites is a problem
that arises even in countries where
urbanization has only recently begun.
Some capital cities which were no
more than villages at the end of the
19th century already face problems
of growth and a difficult choice bet¬
ween the preservation and moderniza¬
tion of their historic centres.
Such problems are even more
frequent in towns with centuries, if not
thousands of years, of history behind
them. Violent controversies may be
caused as much by misunderstandings
as by conflicting interests. Some
projects for urban renewal In historic
city centres arouse strong feelings so
confused that they are sometimes
wrongly seen as new quarrels between
the Ancients and the Moderns.
At first sight, the notion of a historic
town or locality presents no difficulty
for anyone. It seems quite clear in
brochures and other tourist literature
publicizing "cities of artistic and his¬
toric interest".
However, the places whose age and
picturesque qualities get all the lime¬
light are as a rule the best protected
or at least the best provided with
means for ensuring their preservation.
Many other cities of equal merit,
whose sites are less accessible or
whose architectural worth is less
easily discerned, remain neglected.
Today's rapidly expanding towns
are better known for their vigorous
growth than for the vestiges of their
past. But now they are discovering
the charm of their old quarters which
seemed commonplace to the tourists
of former times, interested only in the
"remote" or "great" periods.
City buildings do not always need
to have defied the centuries in order
to be considered as venerable. They
may be classified as historic because
they were once the childhood homes
of famous persons or the scene of
outstanding events in the recent his¬
tory of a nation.
The notion of a town or quarter of
historical interest thus covers a wide
variety of places: ghost towns,
forgotten cities among whose ruins
nomads now pitch their tents, over-
populated towns bursting with life.
Some are legendary cities, known the
world over; others are remote villages
whose stones reveal their history to
only a handful of scholars. .
Some ancient cities, raised In the r

)V space of a few years, have retained
an astonishing unity of style and the
stamp of the age in which they were
built. Others, which have been con¬
tinually developing, are a disconcerting
mixture of periods and styles like
manuscripts in which old writing has
been rubbed out to make room for new.
All these groups of historic buildings
have one thing In common: they are
generally thought to be ill adapted to
modern life. When their raison d'être
political, religious, military, cultural
or economic has moved elsewhere
or disappeared completely through
changes in religious, social and
technological conditions, these build¬
ings lose some of their original uses
and are poorly equipped to fulfil new
ones as commercial centres, for
example.
Once the wealthier and more enter¬
prising sections of the population
move out to new towns, the whole
character of a city changes radically.
People from low income groups move
in, renting accommodation In former
palaces, mansions, stately homes and
ancestral dwellings. They cannot
afford to maintain these buildings,
which almost inevitably become dilapi¬
dated. Trade, previously geared to
the needs of a prosperous, structured
and diversified society, adjusts to the
requirements of more modest and
relatively deprived groups.
Needless to say, not all towns and
quarters of historic interest have
suffered the same fate: some are
empty, some bubble with vitality;
others have kept or regained their
former prestige.
If a historic city has ceased to fulfil
the purposes intended by its builders,
are we to conclude that it no longer
has a "raison d'être"? Or ought we, on
the contrary, to endow it with new
functions? And if so, what are they?
At all times towns and cities have
changed in appearance, sometimes
with brutal speed, for wars and fires
have been powerful forces of urban
development. But when a town or
city was rebuilt after a disaster, its
new appearance did not necessarily
conflict with the original vision of the
master builders of former times. The
world of Its inhabitants would change
very little.
The new buildings which replaced
the old were usually built on the same
site and followed the same layout.
Succeeding generations saw their
town grow or shrink, become beautiful
or ugly, expand or close in on itself.
In other words, cities changed gradu¬
ally. During one man's lifetime, his
city would stay the same.
In our time, there has been a radical
break with this process. Today, for
the first time in history, every city in
6
the world Is being rapidly transformed,
and in accordance with a uniform
pattern. The disappearance of old
city centres and quarters should not
be an inevitable consequence of urban
expansion, but this is what is
happening everywhere.
Our industrial civilization is the first
to possess both the financial means
and the technical resources to demo¬
lish old buildings on a large scale and
almost immediately to replace them
with new and totally different ones.
This Is why the issues involved
when old towns are threatened with
demolition often seem so confused.
Only in modern times have we become
aware of the problem and Its inherent
contradictions.
The ancient city existed as an un¬
questioned presence which no more
gave rise to value judgements, to
acceptance or rejection, than did the
presence of a mountain or a river.
But once Its existence is questioned
It becomes historic, and Is' either
extolled or dismissed as alien to the
modern world, a treasure for some,
a source of embarrassment for others.
Large-scale demolition of historic
centres or quarters Is generally justi¬
fied on the grounds of "progress" by
the public authorities which either
decide on demolition or allow It to take
place. The needs and advantages of
progress are expressed from a wide
variety of viewpoints.
Traditional cities have been and still
are condemned on aesthetic grounds.
Cultural and political changes can
provoke curiously hostile reactions to
works of the past. What is ancient
may be regarded simply as old, dirty,
unseemly.
This attitude, still widely found in
some countries which seek to hide the
most typical examples of old archi¬
tecture and town planning, brings to
mind the contempt in which neo¬
classical Europe long held what it
termed the "barbarism" of Gothic
castles and cathedrals. The results
are disastrous when the authorities,
anxious to modernize their capitals,
apparently feel nothing but shame for
the evidence of their national culture,
whose purity, moreover, they claim
to defend.
Social considerations also play an
important part. Badly cared for,
overcrowded and often neglected by
the public health and maintenance
services, historic buildings used for
housing can all too easily become
classed as "Insanitary". Old town
centres are sometimes regarded as
hotbeds of disease and epidemics, fit
only for radical and over-simplified
"cleaning-up" measures as though
demolition were the only cure for
unhygienic conditions.

THE HERITAGE OF
NEPAL
Photo © Yvette Vincent-Alleaume, Paris
The largest Buddhist "stupa " or shrine in the Kathmandu Valley is that of
Bodhnath (above). Nepal's thousands of stupas range from simple,
hemispherical mounds of earth to elaborate stucco-covered edifices
topped with a tower painted with four pairs of all-seeing eyes, as at
Bodhnath. (For another view of the Bodhnath stupa, see centre colour
page, and for aerial view of the same stupa, page 34; see also photo story
on pages 28-29 for the significance of the eyes on stupas.) .
Rising like a giant staircase from the
low-lying Terai plain to the towering
heights of the Himalayas, the Kingdom of
Nepal is a confluence of peoples, languages
cultures and religions. Its cultural and
historic heart, the Kathmandu valley,
with nearly four-fifths of all the country's
historic monuments, is also the area of
Nepal most affected today by moder¬
nization and urban development.
Nepal thus faces a complex problem of
harmonizing social and economic develop¬
ment with the preservation of a rich and
unique cultural heritage and a natural
environment of Imposing beauty.
Since 1968 Unesco has been assisting
Nepal in the preservation of its historic
monuments. It has helped in the restora¬
tion of the Hanuman Dhoka palace in
Kathmandu, where the king will be crown¬
ed in February 1975 (see page 8). It has
also aided Nepal in setting up a conser¬
vation laboratory at the National Museum
in Kathmandu and is training specialists
in restoration techniques, locally and
through fellowships for study abroad.
To assist Nepal in making a total
approach to the problems of conservation
and economic growth, Unesco is now
launching its first integrated enterprise in
cultural conservation and development.
Next May, Unesco will send a special
team of experts to Nepal, in co-operation
with the U.N. Development Programme,
comprising specialists in the fields of
economics, architecture, urban and rural
planning, sociology, archaeology, public
health, museology and legal questions.
The Unesco team will benefit from earlier
surveys made by the Nepalese Govern¬
ment, in collaboration with Unesco and
the United Nations, on town planning and
the conservation of monuments and the
natural environment and plans for econo¬
mic development. It will also make use of
the first detailed inventory of all the
monuments and sites in the Kathmandu
valley, just completed (see page 30).
Using this information and making new-
on-the-spot surveys, the Unesco team
will prepare a master plan for the cultural
development of the Kathmandu valley
which, while preserving its monuments;*
will respect the needs of the people and
protect the natural environment.

Kathmandu's
ancient palace
where Nepal's kings
are crowned
First stage of a Unesco plan
for restoring the monuments
of the entire Kathmandu valley
by Raj Mukunda
IN Kathmandu on February 24, 1975,
Birendra Bir Bikram Shah Dev will
be formally crowned King of Nepal in a
courtyard of, the ancient royal palace
of Hanuman Dhoka. Like generations
of their forefathers before them, the
Nepalese will flock to the capital from
all parts of the country to acclaim the
newly-crowned King. As the age-old
rituals are performed, and the King
is presented to the people, all Nepal's
religious, cultural, political and his-
RAJ MUKUNDA, of Nepal, is lecturer in Ne¬
palese history at Tribhuvan University in Kath¬
mandu, the capital of Nepal.
torical traditions will surge to life in
an outburst of jubilation and festivity.
While ancient Vedic hymns are
chanted, King Birendra will be anointed
and washed by Brahman priests.
Then, enthroned on a dais facing to the
east, he will be solemnly instated, as
Nepal's superb helmet-like crown,
encrusted with pearls, diamonds,
rubies and emeralds, and crested by
billowing bird of paradise feathers is
placed on his head.
As the young King leaves the palace,
to be borne on a towering elephant
through streets packed with his sub¬
jects, he will follow another ancient
custom. He will offer flowers and
coins to the Hindu and Buddhist
images. The Palace where the
coronation ceremony will take place
is called Hanuman Dhoka because the
image of the Hindu deity Hanuman is
standing on the main gate.
The ceremony in the courtyard of
the Hanuman Dhoka will mark Blren-
dra's religious consecration. On
coronation day he will become, in the
eyes of all the Nepalese, the incar¬
nation of the god Vishnu, the defender
of good order, as the main duty of the
King is to protect his country and his
countrymen.
This relationship will be expressed
symbolically In the palace courtyard,
where the King will sit on a throne
backed by a golden canopy carved in
the form of a nine-headed cobra,
representing Vishnu.
Hanuman Dhoka Palace is set in
the heart of Kathmandu, a city founded
in 723 and capital of Nepal since the
middle of the 18th century.

The Palace roofs rise tier upon tier
from Durbar Square. Inside there is
a whole bewildering network of irregu¬
larly connected courtyards, nestling
between pagodas, shrines, columns
and statues. They all form part of the
extensive and rambling Palace.
These buildings are of great beauty
and historical interest. But like
many Nepalese monuments they have
suffered harshly from the ravages of
time. They have been rocked by the
earthquakes which periodically hit the
Kathmandu valley one tower was
particularly shaken by an earthquake
in 1934 and now leans crazily to the
north. They are exposed to the annual
drenching of the monsoon. Much of
the delicately carved polychrome
woodwork which supports the roofs Is
rotten and in dire need of restoration.
Several years ago the Nepalese
government appealed to Unesco for
help in restoring and reconstructing
its great historical monuments. In
1968 a Unesco mission recommended
that certain parts of Kathmandu valley
should be designated as "historic
districts" and then in 1970 Unesco
declared that it was prepared to
initiate a programme for the conser¬
vation of temples and their environ¬
ment in this valley.
The first conservation programme to
be carried out by Unesco, in collabo¬
ration with the Nepalese government
and with the United Nations Develop¬
ment Programme financing experts and
equipment, is a project to conserve
Hanuman Dhoka. The aim of the
project is not only to restore the
Palace but to train a conservation
team for work elsewhere in Nepal.
It was decided that the first stage
in the project should be the conserv¬
ation of "Nassal Chowk", the court¬
yard in which the coronation ceremony
takes place.
Each of the 14 big courtyards, or
chowks, in the Palace compound is
dedicated to a different divinity. For
instance the coronation courtyard is
dedicated to the god Nartesvara,
Nepal's "Lord of the Dance." Only
one courtyard is generally open to the
public. The rest are closed except
on the occasion of the great religious
festival known as "Durga Puja" (Durga
worship), which is celebrated every
autumn In Nepal. The Durga Puja is
as important a festival for all the

FOREST OF SCAFFOLDING surrounds two of the four
towers of Hanuman Dhoka palace (bottom of page) during
restoration work now in progress. Among the most
beautiful features of the palace are the carved wooden
polychrome struts (left) which support the overhanging
roofs. In the meticulous task of restoration (below),
Nepalese craftsmanship is being extensively used, and the
Hanuman Dhoka Conservation Project is helping to train a
team which will carry out restoration work on other
monuments in the Kathmandu valley.
E
k*j,- Nepalese as Christmas is for the
Christian world.
To the north of the main palace area
rise three tall stone pillars. On top
of two of them are bronze statues of
Nepalese kings; the third supports an
attendant lion. They guard the holy
Temple of Taleju.
The temple, which forms part of
Hanuman Dhoka Palace, is normally
open only to priests, but during Durga
Puja thousands of people climb the
long flights of stairs up to it to pay
homage to Durga. The private chapel
of many Kings of Nepal, Taleju
Temple is a massive three-roofed
structure. Each roof Is supported by
carved and gilded struts, which stand
out against a sombre dark red, brown
and black background. Bells hang
from the roofs and tremble gently in
the wind.
Hanuman Dhoka is also the scene of
Nepal's annual Indrajatra festival,
which lasts for eight days and, like
other religious festivals in Nepal, Is
celebrated by both Hindus and
Buddhists. On the first day a long
wooden pole is erected before
Hanuman Dhoka in order to propitiate
the god Indra. Then, against a back¬
ground of gilded pagodas, classical

dancers wearing ornately decorated
masks and headdresses gather in a
courtyard of the palace to celebrate
the visit of the god Indra.
Perhaps the most beautiful courtyard
in Hanuman Dhoka is that known as
"Lohan Chowk", which is enclosed by
the "House of Enjoyment" built by
the great 18th-century ruler Prithvi
Narayan, who united the kingdom of
Nepal. The House of Enjoyment, now
in an advanced state of disrepair,
contains some fine carvings and
architectural details. Unesco Is
helping In its restoration. It has been
proposed that it be used as a museum
of Nepalese history, art and archi¬
tecture.
Visitors to the Lohan courtyard are
invariably surprised by the towers
which rise at each corner. Each one
is built in a different style. One is a
majestic nine-storey construction, with
three overhanging roofs. Another has
a Bengali "elephant's ear" style roof.
A curious story surrounds the
construction of the four towers. When
planning his palace the King is said
to have asked four towns In his
kingdom to nominate their best builders
and architects, and each town in this
co-operative competition built a tower.
The tallest and most spectacular, the
nine-storey Bhasantpur Tower, was
built by Kathmandu itself. The three
others were named after the cities
which built them: Lalltpur (also known
as Patan), Bhaktapur (also known
as Bhadgaon), and Kirtipur. Each
tower looks out across the valley to
the town which built it. All four are
now to be restored with Unesco's help
as part of the Hanuman Dhoka Con¬
servation Project.
Almost 100 feet high, Bhasantpur
tower's nine storeys are connected by
steep, narrow staircases, and on each
storey there is a heavy trapdoor which
can be bolted from above. From its
balconies one commands the view
once enjoyed by the monarchs of
Nepal, who came to sit there in
cushioned splendour to survey their
kingdom. Durbar Square below teems
with market traders; behind rise the
tiered roofs of the Palace. The whole
of the interior of this tower will be
renovated as part of the current
programme.
The restoration of Hanuman Dhoka
is only the first stage in the collabo¬
ration between the Nepalese Govern¬
ment and Unesco. Unesco has already
surveyed the principal monuments
of the entire Kathmandu Valley (see
article page 17). In this way the
rich cultural and artistic heritage of
Nepal, the cross-roads of two great
Asiatic civilizations, will be saved.

This five-roofed pagoda dominates the courtyards of
Hanuman Dhoka Palace with its striking circular roofs.
It stands in the eastern part of the palace, near one of
Kathmandu's largest temples, which is so sacred that
it is closed except for the annual celebrations in honour
of its patron goddess, Durga.

Left, typical Nepalese mountain village, dominated
by the mighty snow-covered Himalayan massif
of Annapurna. Below, detail from a 16th-century
Nepalese illuminated manuscript, depicting the serpent,
which figures in the legendary origins of Nepal.
The story goes that Nepal's Kathmandu valley was once
a lake filled with serpents and hemmed in by mountains.
A hero is said to have cloven the mountains with his sword
and the water flowed out, carrying the serpents away.
FROM time Immemorial Nepal
has been a land where people
have sought and found peace. The
scriptures, epics and such famous
works of the Hindus and Buddhists as
the Ramayana, the Mahabharata, the
Puranas, the Buddhacarita and others
have told of tribes, races and dynasties
of brave and cultured people who
lived and ruled there.
In the shadow of the Himalayas,
hermits, philosophers and thinkers
meditated upon man and human
happiness. In the eastern lowlands of
Nepal, the saints Yaguanvalkya and
his wife Gargl preached a kind of
human dignity and nobility that could
lead men to the divine. Janak, King
of Bideha, the prototype of the perfect
ruler and ideal man, established lasting
ethical and moral precepts. His
daughter, Sita, came to symbolize the
ideal of Asian womanhood, and she
and her husband, Rama, are the subject
of the Ramayana, composed by the
poet-saint Valmlki near the Gandak
river in southern Nepal.
This epic, loved and cherished over
most of Asia, has been an endless
literary and artistic source of inspi¬
ration. The philosopher-saint Kapil
meditated on the immortal figure of
the Buddha, the Enlightened One, who
said to his disciples: "I teach only
two things: the cause of human sorrow
and the way to be free from it."
This is the heritage of Nepal and
of its people, thinkers, poets and
artists. Stupas, pagodas and temples
honour Shiva, god of peace and

popularly known as the White Dagoba,
which he had placed on a hillock in
the Central Park in Peking.
The rise of the Hans of China and
Mongolia carried his fame and in¬
fluence to Mongolia where he was
known as Bolbo-Khu (Bolbo being the
Mongol for Nepal, and Khu meaning
young man in that language), and was
accorded god-like status utter the
name of Bolbo-Khu before a simple
Mongol, and his head will bend in
reverence.
The Nepalese have never fought in
the name of god or religion, and have
no word for a crusade or holy war.
Battles and fighting did of course
occur during Nepal's long history, but
the total number of people lost in all
of them does not exceed a thousand.
There have been no quarrels over
language, or between sects. And yet
Nepal is the home of the Gurkhas,
whose bravery and valour were dis¬
played in helping to defend the world
against tyranny in two world wars.
In this there Is no paradox. Nepal
is proud of Its age-old liberty and
independence. It has never been a
colony of any foreign power. The
people defended both themselves and
others who called upon them for
assistance. Non-alignment, opposition
to all forms of racialism, colonialism
and exploitation; peaceful co-existence
and friendship for all these have
been the guiding characteristics of
Nepal's foreign policy.
However, Nepal had to undergo the
nightmare of a century of family auto¬
cracy under the Ranas (from 1846 to
1951) before democracy was restored
by King Tribhuvan. The reign of his
son and heir. King Mahendra, was one
of reconstruction and progress. He
installed the Panchayat system in
1962.
The main purpose of the Panchayat
system is to ensure maximum partici¬
pation of people in government and
administration by encouraging the
development of local government
institutions at different levels, and
making them Into an integral part of
the structure of national government.
The basic unit Is the village Pan¬
chayat or council of village people,
always a traditional concept in Nepal¬
ese society, but now given a new form
and new functions. There are two
political bodies at the village level: the
Assembly, which includes all adult
members of the village; and the Pan¬
chayat, or executive, consisting of
eleven members elected by it on the
basis of adult franchise.
The successor of King Mahendra,
the present King Birendra Bir Bikram
Shah Dev, has come to the throne with
new ideas and a deep understanding
of world affairs and of the contem¬
porary problems facing his country.

by Ernest A. Connal/y
NEPAL remained an enigma to
most of the world until it was
opened to foreign visitors less than
two decades ago. A land-locked
kingdom stretching 500 miles along
the southern slopes of the Himalayas,
it is bordered by China (Tibet) on the
north and India on the south. Its
terrain varies from the jungles of the
Terai to the snowy peak of Mount
Everest. Kathmandu, the capital city,
ERNEST A. CONNALLY is head of the office
of Archaeology and Historic Preservation of
the U.S. National Park Service, in Washington
D.C. In 1968 Unesco sent him to Nepal to
advise on the preservation of Nepal's historic
monuments and the promotion of cultural
tourism. The author has written a more extensive
presentation of the subject in a report on his mis¬
sion which he prepared for Unesco entitled
"Nepal Cultural Tourism."
stands in a valley at an elevation of
4,500 feet.
Unified as a kingdom just two
centuries ago, Nepal is a geographic,
ethnic, and cultural combination. With
a population approaching 12 million,
its peoples represent six or seven
major ethnic strains. It is a land of
regional distinction in social custom
and dress. It is a land of three
languages, a dozen dialects, and two
major religions.
Officially Hindu, the country is also
heavily Buddhist. Temples of both
often stand side by side, with some
practices of faith tending to mingle.
Inscriptions on the monuments are
usually rendered in a version of
Kiranti, the old Sanskrit-derived
literary language. The major modern
tongues are Nepali and Newari, while
some dialects of Hindi are spoken
along the Indian border. Although
Nepali is now the lingua franca, it is
less than 200 years old, having dev¬
eloped, with the unification of the
kingdom, from Gurkali with borrow¬
ings from Hindi. Newari is the old
language of the people of the Kath¬
mandu .Valley, who knew themselves
and their speech as Nepali. The term
Newari came into standard use only
after It was adopted by missionaries
in the late 18th century. A synonym
for Nepali, the name was merely
spelled according to a dialectical
pronunciation.
The modern name Newari therefore
denotes not only the language but also
the people of the Kathmandu Valley.
Their ancestors were the original
Nepali, whose cultural hegemony pro-
vided the kingdom with its name, its
most important style in art and
architecture, and its major monuments.
The Kathmandu Valley is the cultural
and historic heart of the kingdom. In
this valley rises the sacred Bagmati
River, flowing down to India. In this
valley stand the important cities of
Kathmandu, Patan, and Bhadgaon.
The early history of the valley is
obscure. It is certain, however, that
Its ancient inhabitants absorbed
several waves of Indian immigration.*
Indian influence is strongly evident,*

, and it is possible that the valley was
subject to the Indian Emperor Asoka
in the 3rd century B.C. Although
Siddhartha Gautama, eventually known
as Buddha, was born (c. 563 B.C.) at
Lumbini on the southern frontier of
modern Nepal, he made his career
in India. And It was from India that
the gods of Buddhism and Hinduism
came ready-made to Nepal, where they
assumed each others' attributes and
assimilated virtues of the old animistic
belief. Nevertheless, ancient fetishes
are still venerated and blood sacrifice
persists.
Apparently the gods gradually pen¬
etrated the valley through commercial
and dynastic connexions with India.
From the middle of the 4th century
to the middle of the 8th the valley
was controlled by the Licchavi and
other dynasties related to princely
Indian clans influenced by Gupta
civilization. It was in these centuries
and under that cultural stimulus that
Nepalese art emerged.
The earliest existing pieces of figure
sculpture are dated to the 5th century.
In the 7th century Chinese travellers
remarked the skill of Nepalese artists.
They mentioned the temples of both
faiths standing side by side, as we
see them today; and they described
a seven-storied tower of the royal
palace at Deopatán and multi-storied
temples on the hills.
It is possible that the Chinese
travellers were describing pagodas,
which they regarded as novelties. In
any case, it Is certain that basic forms
in art and architecture had been
established by the mid-7th century,
from which time the Newari style
radiated its influence beyond the valley
to Tibet and finally to China. In the
13th century, Newari artists were
summoned to the service of Kublai
Khan.
Evidently the cities of Kathmandu,
Patan, and Bhadgaon had not come'
into existence at the time of the
Chinese visit in the 7th century,
although by that time each may have
had a nucleus in the form of a religious
shrine. The cities came into im¬
portance only under the Malla dynasty
in 1200 A.D.
In Nepal religion is more than a
faith; it is a way of life, integrated
with all human action and always
visibly evident. Thus an early English
traveller to this remote, enigmatic land
was prompted to observe that there
were as many gods as men and as
many temples as houses. Among the
multitude of temples are three readily
recognizable types: pagoda, stupa,
sikhara.
The pagoda is by far the most dis¬
tinctive and most numerous type. In
all the variety of sizes in which it is
found, the pagoda-temple characteris¬
tically consists of a square chamber
containing the cult ¡mage, above which
rises a series of progressively dimi¬
nishing hipped roofs. The tiers of roofs
vary in number from two to five, three
being commonest. The chamber is
18
usually constructed of brick, while the
roofs are covered with small tiles or,
in some cases, sheet metal. In a
few extraordinary instances the sheet
metal is gilded.
The roofs are usually supported by
wooden struts, carved and polychrom-
ed, and the eaves are graced with
a fringe of small bells. In larger exam¬
ples the cult chamber is surrounded
by a colonnade of carved wood. The
temple stands upon a paved terrace
or platform. It is sometimes situated
within an enclosed courtyard, spacious
or restrictive; often it rises solo on a
high stepped platform located at some
irregular plaza within the town.
As an architectural form, the pagoda
may have been developed before the
7th century; however, It Is doubtful
that any existing example can be dated
earlier than the year 1400. The Temple
of Changu Narayan at Changu, the
construction of which is dated to 1401,
may be the oldest existing pagoda.
While the pagoda Is used by Hindus
and Buddhists alike, the stupa is pecu¬
liar to Buddhism alone. Characteristi¬
cally, the stupa is an artifical mound
of hemispherical shape and symbolic
meaning. Scattered throughout the
kingdom are numerous stupas that are
mere mounds of earth of varying size.
Others are regular architectural cons¬
tructions in brick and stucco, also of
various sizes.
The two largest and most Important
examples in the valley are Bodhnath at
Baudha and the Swayambhu or Swa-
yambhunath stupa at Sengu west of
Kathmandu. The latter consists of the
characteristic large mound finished
with stucco and periodically white¬
washed. Atop the mound ¡s a cubical
tower painted on its four faces with
pairs of all-seeing eyes. It is surmount¬
ed by a spire of successively diminish¬
ing rings of burnished metal culmi¬
nating jn a delicate gilded umbrella.
The stupa is situated on a platform
on a hill. It Is surrounded by a host
of small temples and lesser monu¬
ments, some in cut stone, and a num¬
ber of monastic buildings.
The Introduction of the stupa into
Nepal Is claimed as early as the 3rd
century B.C. However, the dates of
existing stupas are very uncertain.
The sikhara is a North Indian temple-
form, an apparently recent importation,
clearly revealing its origin. It is char¬
acterized by a tall slender dome, sug¬
gesting the shape of a folded umbrella,
usually rising above colonnaded plat¬
forms. The umbrella-like dome is built
hollow, the shell being laid in corbel¬
led masonry, stone or brick.
The brick examples are plastered on
the exterior. Fairly common, they can
be found here and there among the
pagodas. A conspicuous, rich example
in cut stone Is the Temple of Krishna
Mandir (dated about 1630) in Durbar
Square, Patan. Although the sikhara
is most readily identified with Hin¬
duism, the form is used by Buddhists
as well. The Mahabaudha Temple in

AN ART THAT CONCILIATES GODS AND MEN (Continued from page 18)
Patan (south of Kathmandu) is an
extraordinary version in moulded terra
cotta.
The temples rarely stand isolated
from their surroundings. They are in¬
tegrated into the neighbourhoods of
the cities and towns, and they are
found In monumental groupings both
urban and rural. The sensitive compo¬
sition of these ensembles, which are
particular expressions of an old and
unique civilization, clearly demons¬
trates the Newari genius In ordering
the environment.
Everywhere one sees evidence of
that thrifty regard for the land that
suits the needs of a long-established,
agriculture-oriented society. Every¬
where one sees terraced fields lying
at the foot of surrounding hills, forming
the picturesque scenery that Is
characteristic of the valley.
One can see the same attitude
expressed in the stepped platforms of
the temples, which figure so impor¬
tantly in community life, and in the
compactness of the temple groups and
their overall terraced structure.
In Patan, the Temple of Red Mach-
hendra, venerated by both Buddhists
and Hindus, is a rich pagoda standing
on a low platform near the centre of a
large grassy quadrangle enclosed by
secular buildings. The temple precinct
serves as a public space, and play¬
ground, in the daily life of the people.
On the platform about the temple are
low columns supporting some of the
valley's finest and most delicate bronze
sculptures.
The ground plan of the temple group
at Changu shows temples of several
sizes and lesser monuments on a
terrace enclosed by low colonnaded
structures, with approaching stairs and
a pool. Pools are often conspicuous
features in temple complexes, the use
of water having been remarked by
travellers since the 7th century.
The Newari's strong sense of com¬
munity, together with their sensitive
RELIGIOUS TOLERANCE. Buddhism
and Hinduism in Nepal are practised
side by side and even draw on each
other's spiritual traditions. An example
of this spirit of harmony is
the religious festival shown here, where
a Buddhist lama from the stupa of
Bodhnath occupies a place of honour
before a Hindu temple at Bhadgaon.
Seated at right of photo with a prayer
wheel in his hand, he watches two
masked dancers, representing demons
in the Buddhist pantheon. A long
serpent hangs down from the roofs of
the Hindu sanctuary, the worship of
Nagas (serpents) being an ancient
Nepalese and Hindu cult.

regard for the landscape and their
thrifty use of space, produced a sus¬
taining balance in the building of
towns, which was achieved through
physical devices.
The irregular pattern of circulation
indicates a process of organic growth,
with consequent variety of view and
spatial transition. The uniformity of
house design, however, provides con¬
sistency, while throughout the overall
pattern there is an even balance bet¬
ween built-up and open areas.
Among the open areas are walled
green spaces for private use and
accessible public spaces of varying
size for community purposes. And
finally there is the rectangular temple
square, with its rich monuments inte¬
grated near the centre, and on the
edges of the settlement the usual
water tanks and terraces.
An important visual aspect of the
Newari legacy are the townscapes,
resulting from the natural terrain and
appropriate ways of building on it.
Although individuality is not lacking
among the towns, there are many
common characteristics which are per¬
ceived on approach, as to Chapagaon,
by traditional paths that were never
meant for means of transport other
than pedestrian.
The rush to modernity poses a
serious threat. Immediate effects are
already evident in the city of Kath¬
mandu and the Kathmandu Valley.
Serious intrusions into the compact
consistency of the historic core of
Kathmandu followed the earthquake
of 1934, which provided the occasion
for opening several wide straight
streets and rebuilding in a dull aca¬
demic style, the white stucco of which
stands in sharp contrast to the tradi¬
tional buildings of natural brick and
carved wood. Because of their increas¬
ing size, concrete construction, and
stucco finish, the new buildings intro¬
duce a jarring note in the historic
urban core.
Industrial development threatens to
conflict with cultural values. Road
construction is often undertaken with¬
out sufficient regard for the old
traditional balance between the natural
and the man-made in the countryside,
or without sufficient respect for tra¬
ditional built-up areas.
At Baudha, the main street has been
widened by the removal of houses
along one side of the old road. Their
replacements are unsympathetic to the
old houses on the opposite side, which
were suffered to remain and need res¬
toration. Furthermore, the old gateway
to the Important Bodhnath stupa was
destroyed. Small and restricted, like
a keyhole, it provided a sudden and
dramatic revelation of the monument
as one entered the sacred precinct
from the road. Now there is an open,
axial approach and the old spatial
control is gone.
Although some restoration work is
being done on the temples, the great
majority suffer steady decay. It Is
estimated that some wooden construc¬
tions will be lost through structural
failure within ten or fifteen years.
Meanwhile on many temples we can
see makeshift protective devices in
the prevalent corrugated iron roofs
and the stiffeners added to the carved
wooden struts that support the eaves.
Apparently it is the rise of tourism
that has prompted the pilfering of carv¬
ed wood, metal work, inscriptions,
and other decorative Items from the
temples. Presumably these objects are
destined for the clandestine curio
market. The problem seems to be
growing and is serious for a number
of reasons.
Among them is the loss of those
small metal plates, so easily portable,
bearing inscriptions pertaining to the
construction of the temple, which may
be otherwise unrecorded. Once it is
detached there is practically no way
to determine to what specific temple a
plate may belong.
Another loss, of course, is artistic.
For example, the temple of Vishnu in
Patan has been stripped of its copper
repoussé door surround and other
metal work. Other monuments have
suffered the same indignity, and the
problem of adequate control is very
difficult.
Several important steps have been
taken by His Majesty's Government
for the preservation and development
of historic sites and monuments. A
National Planning Commission has
been created at the ministerial level.
It is composed of five members, all
recognized as leading professionals,
including a member for regional deve¬
lopment.
The formation of the Planning Com¬
mission provides the most promising
means for ensuring inter-ministerial
coordination in all phases of economic
and physical development, Including
the preservation and development of
the Kingdom's rich and unique legacy
of historic cities, towns, sites, and
monuments.

Lotus eyes of the Buddha
Text © Copyright - Reproduction prohibited
i\ccording to Buddhist tradition, the first great stupas
were built during the reign of the Indian emperor Ashoka
in the third century B.C. and were erected in the region
of present day Nepal. The Tibetan Chörten is derived
from the Indian Stûpa or Caitya, and its architecture
developed from the pre- Buddhistic autochthonous Indian
grave-mound. Under these mounds the saintly ascetics
were buried; their bodies were seated on the ground in
Yoga posture and then covered over with earth. These
dome-shaped graves, or tumuli, of the saints were
regarded as holy places.
In Nepal today the former sepulchral mound rises as
the gigantic dome of a temple, and from these famous
Nepalese Eye-Chörtens, the eyes of Buddha above the
coupola gaze in four directions. Analogous but smaller
Chörtens were built in the far east of Bhutan; according
to local reports, they were constructed at the end of the
eighth century.
The basic structure of a Chörten consists of a square
foundation symbolizing the earth, a dome symbolizing
water, and thirteen tapering steps of enlightenment
symbolizing the element of fire. These steps lead to a
stylized parasol, the symbol of wind, which is topped in
the ethereal sphere by the well-known "twin-symbol"
uniting sun and moon, which is the shimmering crown of
a Chörten.

The valley of Kathmandu
From temple precincts to terraced
rice-fields, an extraordinary civilization
flourishes in harmony with nature
The first complete survey-inventory of the cultural and historical monuments of the
Kathmandu valley in Nepal has recently been completed by Carl Pruscha of Austria, a
U.N. town planning specialist, in collaboration with Nepalese experts. Covering well
over 800 monuments, settlements, sanctuaries and nature preserves, the inventory will
serve as the basis for Nepal's global plan for the preservation of its rich cultural and
natural heritage. The preservation plan and the detailed inventory of the Kathmandu
valley's monuments and sites are to be published as a two-volume study early in 1975
by the Government of Nepal with financial support from Unesco, the John D. Rocke¬
feller III Fund and the Austrian Government (1). Entitled "The Kathmandu Valley: The
Preservation of Physical Environment and Cultural Heritage (A Protective Inventory)",
the study was prepared by Carl Pruscha, in conjunction with Nepalese colleagues.. In
the article that follows, Carl Pruscha describes the main features of the Kathmandu
valley and its historic sites set in an environment of extraordinary beauty.
(1) Published by Anton Schroll Publishers (Vienna, Austria,' and Munich, Fed. 'Rep. of Germany). The two volumes
(296 and 264 pages) are illustrated with 873 black and white photo reproductions and 831 line-drawings, and have an
explanatory text in English. Price, for the two volumes, about US. $65.

The Nepalese mastery of the art of shaping their environment is revealed both in their
temple architecture and in the intensively cultivated terraced hillsides where they grow
rice and other crops. These terraces harmonize perfectly with the steps and staircases
of many of Nepal's temples, such as Pashupatinath Temple (opposite page), Nepal's
national shrine, which stands on the banks of the sacred Bagmati river near Kathmandu.

CARL PRUSCHA of Austria, is an architect,
town planner and landscape artist, and has been
working since the beginning of 1965 in Nepal
for the United Nations. He helped the Nepal
government to set up a Department of Physical
Planning, and between 1967 and 1973 was its
regular consultant. He helped direct and carry
out Nepal's major monument survey in the
Kathmandu valley.

or the hand of man, are already damag¬
ed or destroyed. The few that still
remain to us are today threatened by
an almost irresistible tide of ugliness
and defacement.
Thus we often find ourselves
looking back in a spiritual search for
the old lost havens of the world. In
our hunger for a Shangri-La we are
drawn back to the snow-capped roof
of the world, the Himalayas. There,
on any mountain peak, we seem to
glimpse the Hindu god Shiva, whose
icy locks melt into the valleys and flow
in many tributaries to the Ganges.
Between these cold mountain
streams rushing down into the depths,
we find an oval-shaped island of
tranquillity the valley of Kathmandu.
It is not hard, seeing it, to believe the
legend that this was once a great lake.
In the centre of the lake lay a small
island, on which the primordial Buddha,
Vairocana, sprang from a lotus bud.
When Manjushri, the bodhisattva
(or future Buddha), personifying
supreme wisdom, travelled from Tibet
to worship the primordial Buddha, he
first used his sword to cleave gaps in
the chain of hills surrounding the
valley, to let the waters drain away.
This one-time island now a hill
became the site of one of the
oldest Buddhist temples in the world.
This Stupa of Swayambhunath (the
self-existent Lord) displays in many
versions the Buddhist Mándala, a
graphic mystic symbol of the universe,
combining the geometric forms of the
circle and the square.
A steep flight of stairs leads up to
the stupa from the east. On the top¬
most level stands Akshobhya (one of
the five "Buddhas of Meditation"), his
right hand pointing down to the earth.
Akshobhya's colour is blue, his element
is the air and his symbol is the vajra
(see photo page 37). To the south
is the Buddha Ratnasambhava making
the gift-bestowing gesture. His colour
is yellow, his element is the earth and
his symbol is the jewel. To the west
stands the Buddha Amitabha in the
posture of meditation. His colour is
red, his element is fire, and his sym- ^

k bol is the lotus. To the north is the
Buddha Amoghasiddhi, the fifth Buddha
of Meditation, in the posture of
protection. His colour is green, his
element is water and his symbol is
the sword. In the centre of the stupa
is the primordial Buddha himself, Vai-
rocana, making the gesture of teaching.
His colour is white, his element is the
ether, and the wheel is his symbol.
However far back in time this
Buddhist holy place was founded, its
presence in the valley has made it
the focal point and cradle of an
unusual civilization, spanning many
centuries, and still flourishing today.
The valley of Kathmandu, a unique
centre of peace and serenity, is still
filled with the spiritual strength which
inspired its original inhabitants to
found this civilization.
The highly fertile soil of the old lake
bottom provides the local population
with their material needs. The symbol
of this dependence on nature's bounty
is the rice shoot, whose production
imposes a basic set of rules for
keeping man in touch with his environ¬
ment. These rules have never been
written down, but they are universally
seen as the basis for the survival of
the population and the preservation of
a healthy environment. They hold the
streams to be holy; they determine the
amount of land that should be' culti¬
vated, and they preserve the integrity
of woods and forests.
Settlements and towns have been
set up on terraced slopes but always
close to streams and groves, and often
in the proximity of sacred rivers on
whose banks the ritual cremation of the
dead takes place.
The settlements themselves, per¬
fectly fitted into the contours of the
land, are as compact as possible and
laid out in concentric rings according
to occupation from priests, merchants
craftsmen and farmers down to those
who carry out the lowliest tasks in
the community.
The handing down of role and
function over the generations within
the settlements rules out any outward
spillover into further rings, which
imposes an upward, vertical growth
pattern on the population. Once the
limits of this have been reached,
daughter settlements spring up outside
the original site, but following the
same pattern. In this way, 29 settle¬
ments of varying sizes have grown up
around the three royal cities of Kath¬
mandu, Patan and Bhadgaon.
While the basic occupation of the
population is the cultivation of rice,
each settlement also has its own
typical manufacturing speciality. Thus
Thimi is well-known as the centre for

THE 'MÁNDALA'

that of the mándala, the geometric

I he Buddhist sanctuary of Bodh¬
nath, to the east of Kathmandu,
should first be viewed from the air.
Only from this vantage point does
its form of a mándala, or mystic
symbol of the universe, stand out
with striking clarity. One first
distinguishes a triple circle forming
the outer corona of the monument:
the houses of Tibetan pilgrims, the
circular street, and the first wall
surrounding the stupa, around which
the faithful walk ritually to the left.
The triple circle symbolizes the
wheel of reincarnations, the endless
cycle of life and death, the temporal
world, constantly beset by unrest,
from all of which Buddhist teaching
seeks to free us.
The Infinite and Eternal, constant
and immutable, is represented by
the monument itself, the stupa
with the "all-seeing eyes of Sup¬
reme Buddhahood" gazing from it.
All around it, hollowed within the
outer wall, is an immense niche
containing prayer-wheels, worn and
dented from use by generations
of pilgrims. Behind them, deco¬
rating the rear of the niche, is
a frieze of blue and orange Buddhas
whose colours are renewed on the
occasion of each pilgrimage.
Within the enclosure, five terraces
serve as the pedestal of the stupa
itself, representing the five elements
(ether, air, earth, fire, water) and
the five directions (The Zenith,
East, South, West, North). Symbol
of the immutable celestial world, the
dome nevertheless does sometimes
change in colour. When I saw it
first, shortly after it had been struck
by lightning, it was dingy and
greyish with piles of blackened
wood at its base. But at the time of
pilgrimages it is whitewashed all
over and then covered with saffron
offered by the pilgrims.
The spectacle of this ochre-col¬
oured dome, blending perfectly
with the gilded bell-tower of the
stupa during these festive occasions,
is enhanced by myriads of prayer-
banners rising towards the summit
of the monument and to the sky.
These fluttering streamers, brought
as offerings by the pilgrims, are
inscribed with the texts of Tibetan
prayers. There are white ones
representing clouds, others as blue
as the sky, green representing water,
yellow symbolizing the earth, and
red ones the colour of fire.

VALLEY OF KATHMANDU (Continued from page 32)
pottery, Sankhu for its cotton-weaving,
Khokana for its oil-pressing industry,
and the tiny village of Pyangaon for
basket-weaving.
The houses in the Kathmandu valley
are built of tiles, either fired or wind-
dried. The roofs, built in heavy wood
with wide guttering, are covered by
small rectangular fired tiles, which
from a distance give the impression
that each house has been topped with
a hand-woven woollen blanket.
The dwellings, set up on tiny patches
of land, have storage space for tools
on the ground floor, bedrooms on the
first floor and a big living room and
kitchen on the second. The dining
room and private prayer room are on
the top floor. The houses are normally
built round an inner courtyard, to allow
the inhabitants to live together as
though forming a single big family.
Since the houses are too small to
allow much social communication
outside the immediate family, covered
platforms have been built at cross¬
roads and squares, where the men of
the town can meet and talk together.
The women have their own meeting
places by the springs, where they go
daily to bathe, wash clothing and to
fetch drinking water.
In the centre of each town can be
found special gathering places built
round the symbol of godliness, the
many-roofed pagodas constructed on
stepped pyramids. This particular
architectural form, which the in¬
habitants of the Kathmandu valley
claim to have invented, can now be
found in the area in a hundred different
versions.
These pagodas with their steps are
often used by hundreds of spectators
as vantage points from which to watch
the frequent and often lively festivals,
while their spreading roofs offer shade
and protection from the rain.
But it is not only within the towns
and settlements that holy places can
be found. They exist also in great
numbers in the open country beyond.
These sanctuaries are smaller but
sometimes more important, since many
can be traced back to ancient
times. Some are built of pipal trees
of giant size, or undressed stone.
Many such holy places are no more
than chambers dug in the soil per¬
haps as a sign of the close link with
the Earth Mother.
All these many holy places, without
exception, harmonize with their natural
surroundings, in settings which under¬
line their significance. The majority
of sites are by streams and rivers,
such as those of Pashupati and
Guheshwari, Gokarna. Sankhunul and

GUARDIANS
OF
THE
SHRINES

of steps leading up to Nepal's
tallest pagoda, the five-storey
Nyatapola Temple at Bhadgaon.
In Nepal, where there is a long
tradition of religious tolerance,
pagodas are used by Hindus and
Buddhists alike. A form of
Buddhism widely practised in
Nepal is Tantrism, so named
after its Holy Scriptures, the
Tantra. An important ritual
object of Tantric Buddhism is the
"vajra", or thunderbolt, symbol
of the Absolute. Photo right
shows a huge vajra on the terrace
of Swayambhunath stupa near
Kathmandu. Most vajras are
much smaller in size and are held
in the hand by monks as a sacred
sceptre.
Chobar. Many are set by springs and
pools, as at Buddhanilkhantha, Goda-
vari or Balaju. Others, such as Chan-
gunarayan, stand on hilltops. Forests
and grottoes have also been chosen
as sanctuaries for many divinities.
The sites are regularly visited by the
inhabitants of the valley, either singly
or in groups. Once a year thousands
of persons make their way across the
fields on pilgrimages to the most
important sanctuaries.
The care and veneration shown by
the valley's inhabitants for their settle¬
ments and towns, their temples and
holy places, is closely matched by
their concern for the natural environ¬
ment, in the sowing and harvesting of
the rice which is their staple diet.
Thus, farming becomes an artistic
creation. Over the centuries, the face
of the land has been shaped by this
process. Thousands of terraces have
been constructed and the landscape
veined by countless canals to irrigate
the growing rice. This great task of
landscaping has been carried out with
no other tools but simple hoes.
Now the valley has hardly an acre
of land which has not been pressed
into use. Here man has genuinely
conquered the earth but without
destroying it. In close creative inter¬
play, man and nature have developed
together.
When the dry winter etches the grey
tones of the terraces against the
white backdrop of mountain peaks,
the handiwork of man is most clearly
seen for a few short weeks. Soon
the heavy monsoon rains turn the
picture Into a waterscape, with
hundreds of small lakes rising in tiers.
Then, very soon, the rice begins to
grow looking from a distance like
light moss and fills the landscape
with innumerable shades of green.
Finally comes the ripening, and the
rice takes on a burning brightness
ranging from yellow to orange.
The settlements themselves, built of
the same material and the same earth,
also change with the seasons, always
maintaining their essential relationship
with the soil on which they stand.
Until now this people has preserved
intact its environment, maintained its
traditional way of life based on its
system of the extended family and
continued undisturbed its communion
with the spiritual and the infinite.
But today the people of the Kath¬
mandu valley face a critical choice:
whether to build their future quietly
on the foundations of their past, and
go on living in their own paradise, or
whether to opt for a 20th-century way
of life so often beset with commercia¬
lism and the errors of misapplied tech¬
nology.
Is it not the duty of the entire world
community to help them in seeking a
solution to this problem ?

WHAT FUTURE FOR OUR ANCIENT CITIES ?
Continued from page 6
Sanitary considerations often go
hand in hand with other concerns
closely related to politics or the
problems of policing a city. Slum
buildings can provide a refuge for
swarms of unskilled workers, unsettled,
difficult to keep track of and viewed
with suspicion by better housed and
more prosperous citizens. Such ac¬
commodation then becomes suspect
and a target for rigorous action, which
is another aspect of the "cleaning-
up" process.
Then there is the spectre of popu¬
lation pressure. In some big cities,
extremely rapid growth calls for a
judicious use of space, and some
technicians would not hesitate to tear
down two- or three-storey buildings in
a historic centre and replace them
with high-rise constructions. They
imagine that this will increase the
amount of accommodation, although
experience has often shown that this
is an illusion, since redevelopment
schemes in city centres generally
encourage the building of offices and
banks rather than new houses.
Some clearer motivations are ex¬
pressed in economic terms. Historic
towns or localities overcrowded with
people who are poor if not actually
destitute, appear to be unjustifiably
occupying space and preventing it
from being put to more profitable use.
To let these buildings stand, goes
the argument, means restoring hun¬
dreds of buildings, constructing miles
of roads, and laying endless lengths
of cables. Even if this kind of pro¬
gramme caused property values to
rise, it would still be unprofitable, and
thus in many countries financially
unacceptable to the authorities.
On the other hand, urban develop¬
ment schemes which are initially
presented as partial renovation pro¬
grammes but are designed to spread,
seem infinitely more profitable. And
so they are for some.
The most frequent cause of demo¬
lition is a controversial though still
widely practised form of town planning,
in which the needs of traffic take
precedence over everything else.
By first opening up a few roads in
a town of historic interest, so as to
reduce traffic congestion, and then
laying out avenues, crossing the town
in various directions, it is thought that
the town's essential historic features
buildings, a celebrated view, a
restored quarter will have been
preserved.
The truth is that the original layout
will have been distorted, the city
disfigured and disorganized and soon
destroyed as an urban ensemble.
This process has happened too often
over the last 50 years to need elabor¬
ation. Whenever short-term planning
gives absolute priority to the road
system and the needs of motor traffic,
it regards groups of buildings from the
pre-industrial era as obstacles and
treats them as such, irrespective of
their size and value as monuments.
Some villages of historical interest
are subject to the same pressures, in
spite of or because of their renown.
Although city-dwellers who buy houses
in these villages as week-end homes
may respect their style and pro¬
portions, the same cannot be said for
the shop-keepers, craftsmen, con¬
tractors and developers who pro¬
liferate in their wake.
The more a village is uniform in
style and appearance, and the more
harmoniously it fits into the landscape,
the more vulnerable it is. It can be
spoiled within a few years by devel¬
opers who were originally attracted by
its solitude, its uniqueness and its
historic charm in other words, by its
"undeveloped" state.
Local and State authorities who are
thinking of protecting a historic
locality, town or site, have usually
gone beyond the stage of making out
a case for the preservation of cultural
property. Yet nearly always they
have to overcome the kind of argu¬
ments and practices described above.
They should realize that calculations
for urban renovation projects are not
always reliable guides, except in
quantitative terms which do not take
into account every aspect of the
social costs involved.
The quality of life in a city cannot
be measured in financial terms. The
urban development schemes which are
most successful in the eyes of their
promoters are not necessarily those
which, in the long run, are beneficial
to the community.
Some highly industrialized countries
have also become aware in recent
years that if millions of old dwellings
were repaired and restored, they would
last as long as, if not longer than,
present-day constructions. As such
they represent a considerable capital
asset, which would be almost totally
lost if they were demolished.
Thus a rational housing policy
should consider preservation as part
of its overall approach to housing.
especially since the renovation of old
dwellings will continue to be for a
long time to come the chief means of
providing homes for the poorer mem¬
bers of the community. Bringing new
life to historic localities, in particular,
has become an economic and social
necessity as well as a cultural one.
Today, when attempts are being
made to redefine the goals of progress
and to measure them against the
hazards of growth, and when defenders
of the environment are challenging
many forms of destructive exploitation,
it has become quite clear that old
towns are among the irreplaceable
resources which no country can afford
to sacrifice.
An international
inquiry on
national laws
for the protection
of historic sites
IN 1973, at Unesco's request, the
International Council of Monu¬
ments and Sites carried out an inquiry
among its 45 national committees on
current laws and regulations for the
protection of historic sites and towns
and groups of ancient buildings.
The results of the survey show
strikingly that protection is inadequate
in almost every country and that diffe¬
rent countries have adopted different
measures.
Very few of them have special laws
or regulations for the preservation of
historic quarters, towns or sites, drawn
up and enforced jointly by the two
authorities usually responsible for such
measures, that is, the historic monu¬
ments services and those in charge of
building and town planning.
From the survey it appears that this
is the case only in France and Bulgaria.
Elsewhere the protection of historic
quarters is covered by laws for the
safeguarding of the cultural heritage
(as in Czechoslovakia, Hungary,
Mexico, Poland, Tunisia, Venezuela
and Vatican City), or comes under
building and town-planning (in Den¬
mark, Finland, and Luxembourg).
In other countries the system is still
more complex, and historic localities
are protected by various laws and
regulations, dealing either with the
protection of the cultural heritage

<![CDATA[
To preserve these towns in all their
diversity is to give the people who
live in them today a longed-for
opportunity for social life. The
modern town-dweller is not filled with
nostalgia for the past, but Tie yearns
for an art of living, and this should
not be rejected when the only
alternative offered to him is the cult
of the motor car, in a world of steel
and concrete.
It is precisely because anonymity
and isolation seem impossible in old
towns and quarters that they are today
attracting the children and grand¬
children of those who deserted them.
And partly for the same reasons they
are attracting builders with highly
original ideas. Many architects and
town planners believe that the old
towns disparaged by their predeces¬
sors are not just relics of the past but
models from which they can draw
inspiration.
Many young people feel strongly
that these historic towns and buildings
must be preserved. In some countries
it is the young who most of all frequent
the old parts of cities and when
necessary fight to save them from
destruction. Perhaps they feel that
when an old town is destroyed,
something more than its familiar
streets is destroyed with it.
For an overwhelming majority of
people, untouched by the culture
acquired from books, old cities are
the only historical evidence they can
perceive and understand. Old cities
are the repositories of the struggles,
customs and aspirations of those who
gradually shaped the world in which
we live.
In its old towns and cities, more
surely than in its national language, a
country can discover the roots of its
personality. For the generations of
our time, cut off from the common
past, historic cities are becoming the
collective memory of mankind. The
disappearance of such places would
condemn them to live in the uncer¬
tainty and isolation of men with no
remembrance of the past.
or with town-planning, which have
usually been drawn up separately by
each of the authorities concerned (as
in Spain, Italy and U.K.).
A number of countries still have no
protection system, though some of
them are currently preparing new laws
and regulations.
Only in a few of the countries
covered by the survey do laws for the
protection of historic localities and
sites require a detailed inventory to
be drawn up of the buildings in the
protected area. This is essential if
the laws are to be effectively applied.
In Bulgaria, Cyprus, Czechoslovakia,
France, Italy, Mexico, and Spain these
inventories are now being prepared.
In other countries, quite a large
number of national committees of the
International Council of Monuments
and Sites (Cyprus, Finland, Italy,
Luxembourg, Mexico, Switzerland, Tu¬
nisia and Venezuela) consider that the
national lawmaking machinery is in¬
adequate. This applies particularly
to financing and the supervision of
restoration and renovation.
Finally, even where laws are
deemed adequate, as in Bulgaria,
Czechoslovakia, Denmark, France,
Hungary, Poland and Spain, problems
arise in implementing them. The main
difficulties are a lack of supervision,
penalties which are too light or not
enforced, lack of interest or under¬
standing by authorities and individuals,
and shortage of funds.
An international agreement on these
questions would thus be of service to
all those concerned with the protection
of historic localities and towns.
In Unesco's view, action for the pre¬
servation of ancient cities comes
within the broader context of several
crucial modern problems including the
need to improve the quality of life. A
series of international recommenda¬
tions or conventions sponsored by
Unesco has carefully defined the
principles and aims of the preservation
of the environment.
The Recommendation concerning
the protection of the beauty and
character of landscapes and sites,
adopted in 1962, for instance, warns
against the dangers of "uncontrolled
urban development". The Recommen¬
dation on the preservation of cultural
property endangered by public or
private works, adopted in 1968,
stresses that it is urgent to "harmonize
the preservation of the cultural heritage
with changes due to social and
economic development."
Similarly, the Recommendation con¬
cerning the protection, at the national
level, of the cultural and natural
heritage, adopted in 1972, recognizes
that it is "essential for human equilib¬
rium and development to preserve a
setting in contact with nature and the
evidence of civilization bequeathed by
past generations."
Lastly, the Convention on the pro¬
tection of the world cultural and
natural heritage, also adopted in 1972,
declares that "the deterioration or
disappearance of any part of the
cultural or natural heritage constitutes
a harmful impoverishment of the
heritage of all nations."
It is with these ideas in mind that
Unesco is now drawing up an inter¬
national regulation for the protection
of historic localities, cities and sites
and their integration into a modern
environment. Preservation, in this
context, means planning based on a
global concept of the environment.
Thus, far from being restrictive, it
forms an integral part of the economic
and social development of the whole
urban or rural environment.
Following more consultations, it is
hoped that this international regulation
will be ready in 1976, and that it will
encourage States to adopt effective
legal measures.
Two conclusions can already be
drawn. The first is that the protection
of historic cities and localities, and
especially their maintenance and
restoration (as in the case of natural
and archaeological sites) must become
an integral part of the reorganization
and development of the urban area
or region concerned.
This decision must be taken at the
highest level by authorities responsible
for overall development. In certain
cases it must be taken by the govern¬
ment itself and, in any event, it should
involve not only the minister for
culture, but also the ministers for
economic affairs, development or
equipment, planning and finance.
Only such authorities are able to study
ways and means, authorize operations
and make financial provision.
Neither competence and devotion
at subordinate levels nor the en¬
thusiasm and alertness of cultural
organizations can replace this political
determination. Maintenance and res¬
toration is a component of global
planning and an integral part of the
reorganization of a locality or region.
Only a government decision to protect
and restore historical centres can
ensure that laws will be drawn up,
funds will be made available and other
measures taken.
The second conclusion is that the
cultural renewal of a town, locality or
village would be meaningless if no
way was found to arouse the interest
of local people who, in any case, must
participate in the project. It some¬
times happens that the renovation of
old quarters is mainly due to the effort
of private individuals, the authorities
providing only legal advice and
technical aid. Yet even when auth¬
orities make a more important con¬
tribution, the participation of the
community is still indispensable.
Historic cities, it has been said, must
be preserved for mankind and for pos¬
terity. This is true. But first and
foremost they must be protected and
restored for the men and women who
live in them, with their collaboration
and for their benefit. M

15 cities launching
major preservation operations
DURING the past 15 years Unesco has mobilized interna¬
tional aid for the conservation and restoration of monu¬
ments and other cultural treasures in many parts of the
world. In particular it has been directly associated with
operations for the protection and renovation of historic
cities and sites. The following brief account of several of
these projects shows how Unesco is helping some of its
member states to preserve historic sites, while integrating
them into modern urbanism.
Kyoto (Japan)
In September 1970, the Japanese
National Commission for Unesco and
the Agency for Cultural Affairs of the
Japanese Ministry of Education orga¬
nized an international symposium on
the preservation of historic localities,
particularly in the ancient city of Kyoto,
Japan's former capital.
The symposium, held in Kyoto,
showed that the concept of a
historic locality was not legally or
administratively recognized in Japan
and that commercial development, ur¬
ban renovation projects, and changes
in social and economic patterns of
daily life were seriously endangering
the quality of the environment in one
of the most beautiful of Japanese cities.
In April 1972, following the interna¬
tional symposium, the Kyoto Munici¬
pality decided:
To designate seven scenic beauty
zones in the city. Within these zones,
areas around five major historic monu¬
ments and two historic localities locat¬
ed east of the Kamo River were to be
placed under the protection and control
of the municipality;
To limit the construction of large
modern structures in more than half
of the city.
The Municipality also designated his¬
toric areas where examples of tradi¬
tional architecture are to be preserved
and in which it will grant subsidies
to enable private owners to repair
buildings in poor condition. Any new
construction in these areas must har¬
monize in height and design with
existing buildings.
Ouro Preto (Brazil)
Vila Rica, which changed its name
to Ouro Preto (Black Gold) in 1823
after the proclamation of independence
by Brazil, was the seat of the Minas
Gerais State Government until 1897.
As the centre of a region immensely
rich in gold deposits, Ouro Preto
played a leading part in Brazilian
history in the 18th century. Starting
as a camping ground for the "Bandei-
rantes" who poured into Minas Gerais
when the gold rush began in 1698,
it speedily became a town where
baroque art and architecture flourished
and on which talented artists such as
the famous 18th-century sculptor, "O
Aleijadinho" left their mark.
Almost entirely abandoned at the
close of the 19th century when the
deposits had been worked out, the
town remained as one of Brazil's his¬
toric and artistic shrines.
As a result of the current economic
explosion in Brazil, Ouro Preto is again
becoming a vigorous and flourishing
town as well as an outstanding centre
of cultural tourism. In consequence,
the cultural heritage which gives it its
special charm and interest is threaten¬
ed by the wave of modernization and
change, and a programme of adaptation
to contemporary needs is called for.
The Brazilian federal and regional
authorities have realized the necessity
of preserving for modern Brazil this
splendid illustration of a chapter in
the country's short but eventful history.
Since 1968, at their request, several
missions of Unesco consultants and
staff have studied ways of promoting
the development of the town while
preserving its unique character.
The missions led to the drawing up
of a master plan for safeguarding
Ouro Preto. The plan proposes town-
planning regulations laying down stan¬
dards for new construction in the
town itself and on the surrounding
hills which were threatened by a proli¬
feration of new buildings ill-suited to
the natural and urban landscape.
The master plan outlines solutions
for traffic and parking problems and
comprises a programme for renovating
the whole urban infrastructure, inclu¬
ding the sewage and the drinking
water systems, and the electricity and
telephone services, as well as a plan
for the preservation of open spaces
and the restoration of many historic
buildings. It also proposes the setting
up of an organization to be responsible
for co-ordinating and carrying out
these programmes.
Isfahan (Iran)
Isfahan, whose history goes back
more than 2,000 years, consists of
two distinct parts: the Safavid town
with its splendid monuments, and
buildings dating from the pre-Safavid
period, including one of Isfahan's
architectural glories, the Juma Mosque.
From the point of view of world
culture, town-planning and tourism, this
Iranian city-monument ranks on a par
with Venice. As the cultural influence
of Venice spread through the West,
so Isfahan influenced the culture and
art of the East. As it stands today,
its splendid skyline virtually intact,
Isfahan offers an enchanting spectacle.
Yet Isfahan is in imminent danger
on account of its rapid growth. Its
population has doubled during the last
ten years because of the introduction
of industry and the inflow of immi¬
grants from the surrounding farmlands.
Though new industrial plants may
not be built within a radius of 50 km
of Isfahan, their existence never¬
theless creates new needs within the
city itself. Thus urban development on
a large scale has become necessary
in order to improve living conditions
and ease the flow of goods and traffic
in the city. This has led to the building
of a new airport, railroad and univer¬
sity, and modifications in the layout of
certain streets.
Iran, like many other countries, thus
faces a crucial problem: how to pro¬
vide for a city's modernization and eco¬
nomic growth while preserving its
cultural heritage. In Isfahan, the Iran¬
ian government has set itself four
objectives: to renovate and preserve,
to modernize and expand.
A special commission under the
patronage of H.M. the Empress of
Iran has been formed to co-ordinate
the work of the various government
services responsible for carrying out
the plan.
Unesco has helped in the prepara¬
tion of the Isfahan project by provid¬
ing experts for planning and consul¬
tation. So far five advisory missions
have been sent to Iran under the United
Nations Development Programme, and
further missions are scheduled for the
near future.
Unesco is also, or will soon be,
associated with national activities for
the protection and restoration of the
Medina of Tunis, the Casbah of Al¬
giers and the Medina of Fez (Morocco),
for the abbey and site of the town of
Echternach (Luxembourg) and the
towns of Herat (Afghanistan), Lahore
(Pakistan), San Salvador de Bahia
(Brazil), Cuzco (Peru), Cartagena
de Indias (Columbia) and Gondar
(Ethiopia), as well as the palace of
Fumban (Cameroun) and historic monu¬
ments in Senegal at St Louis and on
the island of Gorée. An outstanding
example of aid given by Unesco for
the conservation of ancient cities is
the international campaign it launched
in 1966 for the preservation of Venice. ifT

An African named
for first time
Director-General
of Unesco
The first African to become Direc¬
tor-General of Unesco was elected
by Unesco's General Conference on
November 14, 1974. He is Amadou
Mahtar M' Bow, of Senegal (at right
in photo above), who will serve
for a six-year term, succeeding René
Maheu, of France (above left), who
was Director-General since 1962.
Taking the oath of office,
Mr M'Bow declared: "From now
on I am a citizen of each of your
countries, the servant of all the
Member States in their totality."
He told delegates from Unesco's
135 member countries he was cer¬
tain that millions of men and women
would consider his election "as a
step towards eliminating the preju¬
dices which have so often and so
tragically marked world history, and
as proof of a desire to base Interna¬
tional co-operation on more equitable
grounds.
"Since each of us Is marked by
the environment in which he was
born and grew up", he said, "it is
first of all in the spirit of the African
people, and in their wisdom that I
shall find guidance for my actions.
I interpret your vote as a mark of
consideration and esteem for the
regions and peoples those of the
Third World which have for so long
been restricted to a marginal role
In taking decisions and exerting
influence at a global level."
Today, more than ever, said
Mr M'Bow, Unesco cannot afford to
trail world events "but must reso¬
lutely take its place In the vanguard
of the double movement of emanci¬
pation of peoples which charac¬
terizes our time."
UNESCO'S GENERAL CONFERENCE ENDS
THE 18th session of Unesco's General Con¬
ference, which opened on October 17, 1974,
closed on November 23 after electing a new
Director-General, Mr. Amadou Mahtar M'Bow,
and adopting Unesco's programme and a budget
totalling $169,992,000 for the period 1975-1976.
The General Conference of Unesco Is com¬
posed of the government representatives of all
Unesco Member States.
During this session, which elected Mrs. Magda
Joboru, of Hungary, President of the General
Conference, the number of Unesco Member
States rose from 132 to 135 with the admission
of the People's Republic of Korea, Guinea-Bissau,
and the Republic of San Marino. Representatives
of fourteen African liberation movements were
accepted as observers as well as the Palestine
Liberation Organization. The Conference ex¬
pressed "the firm hope that Palestine will rejoin
the community of nations within the International
organizations including Unesco."
Following a debate on general policy, the
Conference adopted a resolution which recalls
that "hundreds of millions of human beings,
threatened by poverty, hunger, disease and
Ignorance, have not yet reached the threshold of
human dignity." This resolution also affirms that
"the defence and promotion of human rights
and fundamental freedoms and the struggle
against incitement to war, colonialism, neocolo¬
nialism, racialism, apartheid and all other forms
of oppression and discrimination are an essential
duty for Unesco."
In the course of the Session, the General
Conference voted after long debate several
resolutions concerning Israel.
Since the Unesco General Conference of
1968, the Organization had on repeated occasions
Issued urgent appeals to Israel to "desist from
any alteration of the cultural and historical
character of Jerusalem, particularly with regard
to Christian and Islamic religious sites". Earlier
this year the Unesco Executive Board at Its
94th Session (May 20 to June 28, 1974) had
"condemned Israel's persistent violation of the
resolutions adopted by the General Conference
and the Executive Board in this regard". On
November 20, 1974, the Unesco General Confe¬
rence voted a resolution which "condemns Israel
for Its attitude which Is contradictory to the alms
of the Organization as stated in Its constitution".
The resolution invites the Director-General "to
withhold assistance from Israel in the fields of
education, science and culture until such time
as it scrupulously respects the aforementioned
resolutions and decisions."
In addition, the General Conference voted a
resolution calling on Israel "to refrain from any
act hindering the populations of the occupied
Arab territories in the exercise of their rights
to national education and cultural life."
The General Conference adopted a number of
resolutions concerning world peace, human
rights, equality for women and the establishment
of a new International economic order, etc. A
resolution concerning Chile was adopted, calling
for the immediate cessation of violations of
human rights and fundamental freedoms in Chile
and requesting the Director-General to take
measures to secure full respect for human
rights in that country.
At the close of the General Conference the
new Director-General, Mr. Amadou Mahtar
M'Bow, launched "an urgent appeal for tolerance
and understanding". "We must avoid at
Unesco's General Conference those conflicts that
take on the character of systematic confron¬
tations. We should perhaps even avoid the
adoption of resolutions, even with large majori¬
ties, that could result in deep bitterness in
certain quarters... The golden rule for an
organization such as Unesco should always be
the search for a consensus through patient and
open dialogue."
ISRAEL AND UNESCO
A statement by the Secretariat of Unesco
IN the light of misunderstandings, reflected in
some press reports during the past few weeks,
of resolutions voted by the last session of the
General Conference of Unesco that affect Israel,
the Secretariat of Unesco wishes to underline the
following facts:
1) Israel has not been "excluded" from Unesco.
Nothing in any of the resolutions passed affects
Israel's continuing membership in Unesco. As a
Member State it is able to participate In all
activities of the Organization as in the past,
including all meetings and conferences. Israeli
scientists, educators and cultural specialists will
be called upon to contribute to the Organization
as they have done in the past, and the hope Is
that they will continue to do so.
2) Israel has not been included in the European
Regional Group of Unescoone of the five
regional groupings for programme purposes
established by the General Conference as Israel
had requested. However, it can participate, as
an observer, in European or other Regional
Conferences, as has been the case In the past
3) Regarding Jerusalem, the General Confer¬
ence invited the Director-General to "withhold
assistance from Israel in the fields of education,
science and culture until such time as it scru¬
pulously respects" previous General Conference
resolutions concerning the cessation of archaeolo-
Unesco awarded John XXIII Peace Prize
The John XXIII Peace Prize has been
awarded this year to Unesco for Its work
in promoting human rights and International
understanding. Founded In 1963 by Pope
John XXIII, the prize has only once pre¬
viously been awarded. The award was
announced by the representative of the
Holy See on November 14, 1974 during
ceremonies honouring Unesco's outgoing
Director-General, René Maheu. On this
occasion Unesco's General Conference
paid a long tribute to Mr. Maheu for his
outstanding leadership and devotion which
had enabled Unesco "to become an effec¬
tive force In the effort to promote peace
and human rights."
gical excavations, the protection of monuments
and the preservation of the historic character
of the city of Jerusalem. The Director-General
intends to execute this resolution faithfully, and
has already so Informed the General Conference.
At present, the consequence of this resolution Is
Interpreted to mean only the withholding of aid
under Unesco's Participation Programme (Israel
received $24,000 In 1973/1974).
4) Regarding possible assistance to the Pales¬
tine Liberation Organization, the Secretariat has
received no such request, which, according to
the pertinent resolution, should come through the
League of Arab States. An authorization for
aid under the Participation Programme was part
of broader decisions to associate African
liberation movements recognized by the Orga¬
nization of African Unity, as well as the Palestine
Liberation Organization, recognized by the League
of Arab States, with the activities of the
Organization. Assistance has already been
provided by Unesco to African liberation move¬
ments In the field of education.
5) Finally, an additional resolution of the
General Conference invited the Director-General
to "exercise full supervision of the operation of
educational and cultural Institutions In the
occupied territories and to co-operate with the
Arab States concerned and the Palestine
Liberation Organization with a view to providing
the populations In the occupied territories with
every means of enjoying their rights to education
and culture". The Director-General is studying
the means of carrying out this resolution. The
General Conference has been advised that a
good deal of Information will have to be gathered
and consultations initiated before certain practical
problems of Implementation can be presented
to Unesco's Executive Board for advice.

Letters to the Editor
AL-BIRUNI
'LIKE FINDING A TREASURE'
Sir,
My mother, Elise Gillette, is an ardent
"Courier" fan. She writes of the num¬
ber on al-Biruni (June 1974): "I'd never
even heard of him. The section on
philosophy stumped me, but the rest
was like finding a treasure."
A. Gillette
Paris, France
Sir,
I found your special issue devoted to
al-Biruni a mountain of boredom. What
the world owes to this scholar could
surely have been summed up in a single
article.
Bernard Hermel
Fontenay-le-Fleury, France
Sir,
I enjoyed your issue on al-Biruni,
since one has too few opportunities for
learning about the great figures of Asian
culture.
By acting as a link between the
world's cultures, the "Unesco Courier"
fulfils an important Unesco ideal. Con¬
gratulations on the whole issue on
the translations of al-Biruni's writings,
the high-quality presentation of the
texts, and the photos, which not only
illustrate the contents of the articles but
communicate thoughts and ideas which
cannot be expressed in words.

POP OR MO POP ?
Sir,
Your query to readers, "Want an
issue on pop music?", produced a fasci¬
nating crop of replies for your letters
page (April 1974 issue) with some
revealing attitudes for and against pop
music.
A continuing controversy indeed calls
for an assessment to be made, but I
fear that this kind of "prophecy" is
beyond the scope of the "Unesco Cou¬
rier". It might be more reasonable to
let passions abate before trying to
reach an unbiased judgement.
The "Unesco Courier" has been de¬
voting much space to music and paying
little attention to drama, the theatre,
the variety show, pantomime and the
circus, an art as ancient as the hills yet
always young. I would like to see the
circus and the theatre given place on
your pages.
Alexander Stepanov
student
Moscow, U.S.S.R.
Sir,
Unlike opponents of pop music, I
would welcome an issue with a com¬
prehensive analysis of this trend in
music. Is it something entirely new
in melody, harmony and other modes of
musical expression? Or is it not as
original and revolutionary as its admi¬
rers, who don't seem hard to please,
would have us believe?
The views of pop music devotees are
hardly convincing. Is pop music only
attractive because of its "violence and
despair and its planetary use of instru
ments from every continent"? No one
could object to a wide use of various
national musical instruments, but I be¬
lieve that most people today would
find it hard to agree with the idea that
the future belongs to those whose
hearts are filled with "violence and
despair".

EIGHT CENTURIES
OF WALDENSIAN HISTORY
Sir,
This year has seen the commemo¬
ration of the eighth centenary of Wal-
densian beliefs and teaching. The
Waldenses suffered persecution during
seven centuries. Theirs was not only
a philosophical and religious movement,
but also offered an early example of
social emancipation in that women took
an active part in the life of Waidensian
communities.
Equally extraordinary for the Middle
Ages is the fact that most Waldenses
learned to read and write. It was they
who in 1532 commissioned and publish¬
ed the first Bible printed in French,
known as the Neuchatel Bible, and later
the Lyons Bible. To pay for its publi¬
cation, Waidensian peasant communi¬
ties between them collected 1,500 gold
ecus. Such a unique enterprise is
perhaps worth recalling.
J. Groffier
Amicale du Luberon
Apt, France
Editor's Note : Jean Groffier is the
author of a book on the history and
philosophy of the Waidensian movement,
which was founded in 12th-century
France, entitled "Qui sont les Vaudois?"
(Who are the Waldenses?) published by
Editions Reboulin, Apt-en-Provence,
France.
MEAT-EATING SUPERSTITION
Sir.
In his article, " Can the Earth feed
the Growing Multitudes ? " (July-August
1974 issue) Roger Revelle states that
a large fraction of available agricultural
land is needed to produce food for
livestock.
This is surely a complete superstition,
since livestock are not necessary for
the human diet or survival, and in fact
their breeding could be steadily
reduced, and the freed land used for
the production of protein foods for
human consumption.
There is already a large literature on
this subject, to which I hope you will
give full publicity In future issues.

vegetarian but much of the world,
unfortunately, is not.
IN COPERNICUS' FOOTSTEPS
Sir,
I was so fascinated by the number
of the "Unesco Courier" entitled "Co
pernicus, a new vision of the universe"
(April 1973), that I have decided to
study astronomy. I very much admire
Copernicus and the other pioneers of
modern astronomy, Galileo, Tycho
Brahe, Kepler and Newton.

RUSSIA'S FIRST
PRINTED TEXT-BOOK
Sir,
This year, 1974, the Soviet public is
celebrating the 400th anniversary of the
first Russian printed text-book. The
text-book was compiled and printed by
Ivan Fyodorov, some time before Feb¬
ruary 1574, in Lvov, a major cultural
centre in Western Ukraine, then part of
Poland.
The text-book is based on material
of Moscow origin but also contains the
Serbian version of a Bulgarian book.
It was used not only by Russians,
Ukrainians and Byelorussians but also
by southern Slavs. Thus we might say
that Russia's first printed text-book sym¬
bolizes the cultural collaboration among
the six Slavonic peoples.

NEW VISTAS
IN SPECIAL EDUCATION
Sir,
My warmest congratulations on your
March 1974 issue on the Handicapped.
Your title, "New Vistas in Special
Education" for my article published in
the issue, could not have been bettered.
It was a happy co-incidence that this
number appeared when it did, for the
World Confederation of Organizations
of the Teaching Profession held its
annual conference in Dublin, in April,
and the theme was education for pupils
with special needs. The "Unesco Cou¬
rier" was available In the English and
French editions and the whole magazine
was the source of many favourable
comments from the participants at this
international conference.
The issue also makes excellent back¬
ground reading for the paper I am
delivering at a conference on the train¬
ing of personnel for the multiply handi¬
capped, being held this year in Sao
Paulo, Brazil.

POWER FROM THE SUN
Sir,
Congratulations on your issue "Power
from the Sun" (January 1974). To my
mind this is the ideal kind of subject
for the "Unesco Courier". It is topical,
it has great economic (and therefore
human) interest, and it could greatly
help to improve conditions of life in
still developing countries (not forgetting
more fortunate countries).
