The UNESCO Courier  April-June 2018   |   3 
As you begin reading 
this April-June 2018 issue 
of the Courier, you are 
living in the Phanerozoic 
eon, the Cainozoic era, 
the Quaternary period 
and the Holocene epoch. 
These are all subdivisions 
of our planet’s geological 
timescale, to which a new bar 
will probably soon be added 
– the Anthropocene.
The Earth entered the Holocene 
(from the Greek “entirely” and “recent”) 
more than 10,000 years ago. But human 
activities have had such a significant and 
generalized impact on the planetary system that, 
for the past few decades, scientists have been 
wondering whether we should be speaking 
of a new epoch. To describe this new epoch, 
the American biologist Eugene F. Stoermer initially 
coined the term Anthropocene (from the Greek 
“human being” and “recent”), popularized in the 
early 2000s by the Dutch atmospheric scientist 
and Nobel laureate in chemistry, Paul Crutzen. 
Since then, it has stirred up endless debates in the 
scientific community and caused a great deal of 
angst among those who have heard about it. 
It is now up to the international community of 
palaeontologists, geologists and stratigraphists 
– in particular, the International Commission 
on Stratigraphy and the International Union 
of Geological Sciences (IUGS) – to determine 
whether there is indeed a new geological epoch 
or whether the Anthropocene will go down in 
future encyclopaedias as a philosophical construct 
aimed at alerting humans living in the twentieth 
and twenty-first centuries of the threats their 
activities posed to the planet.
While awaiting this verdict, the scientists continue 
to argue, plead and quarrel. How should we date 
the beginning of this hypothetical new epoch? 
In other words, how long have we supposedly 
been responsible for a process that could prove 
fatal for our planet? For some, the Anthropocene 
is just another name for the epoch that we call 
the Holocene. 
After all, humans began to exert pressure 
on the environment over 10,000 years ago 
– since their sedentarization and the invention of 
agriculture. For others, the Anthropocene started 
with the industrial revolution, in the eighteenth 
century. Still others view the beginning 
of the Anthropocene as coinciding with 
the release of the first atomic bomb in 1945.
In spite of these disagreements, all but a very 
few acknowledge that in the last half-century, 
the state of the planet has deteriorated more 
rapidly and more dramatically than ever 
before. There are gigantic amounts of plastic 
on beaches and in the seas; an unprecedented 
development of new substances that are 
covering the Earth’s surface and which are 
rarely recycled; soils that are overflowing with 
fertilizers; increasing acidity of the oceans; 
unprecedented levels of pollution; the erosion 
of tropical forests; the disruption of ecosystems; 
the massive extinction of species and a drastic 
loss of biodiversity, and global warming at an 
alarming rate – the list goes on.
Who is to blame for all this? “Humans!” is 
the resounding reply of most scientists. 
It remains to be determined whether we 
– the world’s rich and poor – should all bear 
the same burden of responsibility. There are 
some who blame, above all, the capitalist 
system created by the West, and speak 
of the Capitalocene or Occidentalocene. 
Are we all heading for a catastrophe? The voices 
of doom are prophesying the end of the world! 
Concepts like Chthulucene and Thanatocene 
are being put forward to warn us that there is 
a monster on the loose, that death is stalking 
us. Some more moderate experts are just 
as concerned about the indecision, and 
therefore, inaction, of our decision-makers. 
“It seems as though humanity is being lethargic 
– waiting for the end of the film, when the 
heroes arrive to sort everything out, and we can 
all live happily ever after,” as one of the articles 
in this issue concludes.
Meanwhile, the debate rages on, the solutions 
are slow to come. The Courier takes stock 
of the situation.

Aerial photograph documenting 
deforestation in the northern 
area of Pará State, Brazil (2013). 
According to the French newspaper 
Le Monde, Brazil reduced 
deforestation by 84 per cent between 
2004 and 2012 before it started 
to increase again. 
They proposed that the beginning of 
this new epoch should be symbolically set 
at 1784, the year in which Scottish inventor 
James Watt substantially improved upon 
the steam engine with new inventions 
– it also corresponded to the beginning 
of the Industrial Revolution and the use 
of fossil fuels.
 From 1987 to 2015, a vast, 
multidisciplinary research project, 
the International Geosphere-Biosphere 
Programme (IGBP), collected a mass 
of data on anthropogenic changes 
to the Earth system. 
Other research, started in the 1950s 
and based on samples of ancient ice 
from the Antarctic and the present 
composition of the atmosphere 
– analysed at the Mauna Loa observatory 
in Hawaii, United States – have revealed 
an accelerated build-up of greenhouse 
gases (GHG), essentially carbon dioxide 
(CO2). In 1987, the Intergovernmental Panel 
on Climate Change (IPCC) was set up to 
evaluate the impact of these phenomena 
on climate.
The Great Acceleration
By pooling this data, in 2009 and again 
in 2015, environmental scientists Johan 
Rockström (Sweden), Will Steffen (US) 
and their colleagues at the Stockholm 
Resilience Centre drew up a list of the nine 
planetary boundaries that it would be 
dangerous to cross. 
Liz-Rejane Issberner and Philippe Léna
The term Anthropocene 
was coined to take into 
account the impact of the 
accelerated accumulation of 
greenhouse gases on climate 
and biodiversity, and also 
the irreversible damage caused 
by the over-consumption of 
natural resources. But do we 
need to turn this into a new 
geological epoch? While the 
debate continues among 
scientists, solutions have yet 
to be found. We are, in effect, 
witnessing a collective form of 
denial – the result of a naive 
faith in progress, consumerist 
ideology and powerful 
economic lobbies.
The term Anthropocene appears in 
the titles of hundreds of books and 
scientific articles and in thousands 
of citations. Its use in the media also 
continues to grow. Defining Earth’s 
most recent geological epoch in which 
human actions have started to provoke 
biophysical changes on a planetary scale, 
the word was coined in the 1980s by 
American biologist Eugene F. Stoermer 
and popularized in the early 2000s by 
Paul Crutzen, the Dutch atmospheric 
scientist and winner of the Nobel Prize 
in Chemistry 1995. The scientists noticed 
that these changes were leading the Earth 
system away from the relative equilibrium 
it had known since the beginning of the 
Holocene, 11,700 years ago.

Four of these boundaries have already 
been crossed – climate change, 
vegetation cover, biodiversity loss and 
extinctions (the Sixth Extinction) and 
biogeochemical flows – with phosphorus 
and nitrogen cycles playing a particularly 
crucial role. They also showed that all 
available indicators on the consumption 
of primary resources, energy use, 
population growth, economic activity 
and biosphere degradation, skyrocketed 
after the Second World War. This period 
was dubbed the Great Acceleration. 
Other observers have even spoken, 
since the 1970s, of a period of hyper-
acceleration. These trends are believed 
to be unsustainable. 
Metaphor or real 
geological epoch?
There seems to be a consensus that several 
parameters of the Earth system have recently 
started to develop beyond the spectrum 
of the natural variability of the Holocene 
– it is now more or less accepted that 
the term Anthropocene be used, to specify 
changes that are of human origin. A handful 
of scientists have nevertheless decided to go 
beyond using the term metaphorically or as 
a practical, interdisciplinary reference tool. 
They have proposed that the Anthropocene, 
just like the Holocene and the Pleistocene, 
should be elevated officially to the rank of 
geological epoch. 
An Anthropocene Working Group (AWG) 
has been set up to present this proposal 
to the International Union of Geological 
Sciences (IUGS). But for a new epoch to be 
named by stratigraphers, there has to be 
an observable and universal rift between 
the sedimentary layers of two epochs. 
Although the presence of anthropogenic 
carbon has been noted in sediments 
since the 1850s, this is not considered 
to be sufficient. 
After all, who’s responsible for crossing 
the biogeophysical boundaries if not 
Western humans and a particular 
socio-economic system? This has 
led to several alternative proposals – 
Occidentalocene, etc. Others, such as 
specialists in global or environmental 
history, feel that there is no ontological 
discontinuity and that the exceptional 
nature of Western growth 
(the Great Divergence) will have to be 
repositioned in the longer term.
According to them, humans have always 
– or at least for the last 40,000 years 
– had an increasing impact on their 
surroundings. They have contributed, 
for example, to the disappearance of 
American and Australian megafauna. 
Some  researchers are thus arguing for 
a long Anthropocene, with sub-periods, 
such  as capitalist industrialization 
(1850-1950) and the Great Acceleration. 
Most, though, recognize the need to 
abandon a linear and deterministic vision 
of historical time. 
The AWG is therefore suggesting that 
the change of epoch should be in 1950, 
the year in which various chemical 
constituents and plastic particles of 
anthropogenic origin began to appear in 
sediments. This is also the beginning of the 
Great Acceleration. In any event, a possible 
failure to recognize the Anthropocene 
as a geological epoch would in no way 
invalidate the scientific use of the term as 
it stands today.
The concept of the Anthropocene has 
sparked several controversies in spite of 
its brief existence – the term itself has been 
queried. Historians and anthropologists 
have questioned the reference to 
anthropos, the generic human being.

photographers Guillaume Bression and 
Carlos Ayesta in the no-go zone around

plastic to depict radiation, which is both 
invisible and odourless.

The UNESCO Courier  April-June 2018   |   9 
Since the end of the Second World War, 
several scientists have warned of the 
non-generalizable and unsustainable 
character of the Western economic model. 
No boundary had yet been crossed, 
and humankind had consumed less 
than one planet. But the process had 
been set in motion. In the early 1970s, 
the situation worsened, the warnings 
multiplied, and the scientific data 
accumulated. On both these occasions, 
a historical change of course would 
have been possible. It has become more 
difficult today.
Collective denial
Why are we refusing to see this? 
There could be a number of reasons: 
a blind faith in progress and development 
– in other words, in a system which 
increases available wealth indefinitely 
– and a belief in the capacity of science 
and technology to solve all problems 
and negative externalities (like pollution, 
for example); powerful interests that 
benefit from this process and carry out 
intense lobbying; the media takeover 
of the minds of consumers, creating 
a hunger for individual consumption, 
as much for comfort as to set oneself apart 
and be recognized.
It is surprising that the human and 
social sciences have avoided this issue 
for so long, given that it will determine 
the future of humanity. Besides being 
anthropocentric by definition, 
these disciplines believe that the 
field belongs to the natural sciences, 
par excellence. 
The emergence of the concept of 
the Anthropocene confers upon them 
the responsibility of explaining how human 
societies have been able to provoke changes 
of such magnitude to the modus operandi 
of the planet, and what differentiated 
impacts they will have on the world map. 
The social sciences and humanities should 
be developing and acquiring new subjects 
and knowledge to respond to the questions 
raised by this new epoch – including natural 
disasters, renewable energy, the depletion 
of natural resources, desertification, ecocide, 
widespread pollution, migration, social and 
environmental injustice.
The slow and feeble reactions of politicians 
– and of societies in general – to climate 
change, is also astounding. A mathematical 
analysis of networks of citations has shown 
that in scientific articles on the subject, 
there has been a consensus, since the 
early 1990s, that climate change exists. 
Given that the crisis is worsening, it is hard 
to understand why efforts to reduce GHGs 
have been so half-hearted. What obstacles 
are preventing international negotiations 
from being more effective? Besides the 
intentionality of these so-called obstacles, 
there is no doubt that communications 
between science and society are sluggish, 
at least when it comes to the climate 
question. To address this, the IPCC has 
adopted a new approach for its Sixth 
Assessment Report (AR6), designed to 
raise awareness among the general public, 
not just decision-makers.
Overcoming deadlocks
One of the stumbling blocks of the 
Anthropocene is that to tackle it, the 
delicate subject of environmental justice has 
to be addressed. Climate change will amplify 
the existing risks, and create new ones, 
for natural and human systems. Yet these 
risks are not distributed equally, generally 
affecting disadvantaged individuals and 
groups the most. But it is not easy to find 
a satisfactory solution to this problem, 
given the heterogeneity of countries in 
terms of their level of development, size, 
population, and natural resources, etc.

What’s more, the human ecological 
footprint has already overtaken, by fifty 
per cent, the planet’s capacity for 
regeneration and absorption, and eighty 
per cent of its population lives in countries 
whose biocapacity is already smaller 
than its ecological footprint. A country 
like Brazil (and other countries on the 
American continent) still possesses a 
large biocapacity surplus, even though 
it consumes 1.8 planets. But twenty-six 
per cent of its GHG emissions are due 
to deforestation. A significant part of its 
ecological footprint comes from exporting 
primary products, which is the reason for 
a large proportion of this deforestation. 
The competitive globalized system tries to 
find supplies at the least cost, encouraging 
extractivism in many countries, and land-
grabbing in others. 
Even if it were possible to suppress all 
carbon dioxide emissions in high-revenue 
countries right now, it would still not 
be enough to reduce the global carbon 
footprint and meet the limits imposed 
for the biosphere until 2050. In other 
words, in spite of the considerable 
differences in the size of their economies 
and their reserves of natural resources, 
all countries need to try to remedy 
the most pressing problem of the 
Anthropocene – by drastically reducing 
their GHG emissions. 
This is exactly what leads us to the 
deadlocks that usually arise in international 
negotiations – the search for culprits that 
then dissuades countries from making 
commitments, for fear of compromising 
their economic growth and their jobs, 
or antagonizing powerful interests. The 
solution that was reached in the Paris 
Agreement, signed on 22 April 2016, 
was to ask countries to make voluntary 
commitments, rather than impose criteria 
established on a planetary scale. This 
means each country commits to meet 
targets for reducing its emissions in line 
with what it considers to be viable.
This approach has helped to overcome 
deadlocks and to make action possible. 
But  it has also created a tangle of 
assessment criteria that complicates 
comparisons between national efforts. 
Also, in spite of its universal character, 
the Paris Agreement does not provide for 
sanctions against countries that default 
on their commitments. This is a sign of the 
weak governance of the climate question 
which, in the absence of an institution 
mandated to carry it out, is incapable of 
prevailing over the economic interests of 
countries and enterprises.
Submerged under contradictions, 
dilemmas and ignorance, the extremely 
serious environmental issues of the 
Anthropocene are not getting the 
required level of priority on national and 
social agendas.

Francisca Chagas dos Santos in 
Rio Branco, Brazil, March 2015. 
Photo from the Submerged Portraits 
series, one of four parallel elements of 
the Drowning World project started 
in 2007 by South African photographer, 
Gideon Mendel, which highlights 
our vulnerability to global warming, 
through the personal stories of victims. 
The more I read into climate change 
science and eventually, into geology 
and biology, the more I realized that 
how late we have come in the history 
of evolution. And that, not accidentally, 
because complex creatures like humans 
can only come very late in the story of 
evolution. The planet developed life and 
its conditions changed to eventually help 
sustain complex multicellular forms of life. 
This realization jolted me out of my habit 
as a modern historian − mainly of modern 
South Asia and the colonial period. 
Normally I used to deal with a world 
that was not more than 500 years old 
– the news of climate change altered that. 
Like many historians, I used to think 
of the natural world as a backdrop, 
where the main actors were human. 
The assumption within which many 
of us worked − that what matters in 
human history is what humans do to 
one another − didn’t seem untrue, 
but it seemed limited. 
Dipesh Chakrabarty, 
interviewed by Shiraz Sidhva
While modern technological 
advances have allowed us to 
flourish as a species, we may 
have catapulted ourselves out 
of the Darwinian evolutionary 
scene. Human beings have 
acquired the role of a geological 
force, capable of stalling 
an Ice Age – and possibly driving 
another Great Extinction of life 
in the next 300 to 600 years. 
It may not be easy, but, argues 
historian Dipesh Chakrabarty, 
it is not too late to change course.
Humans are a

You have said that anthropogenic 
explanations of climate change spell 
the collapse of the age-old humanistic 
distinction between human history 
and natural history. Could you elaborate?
Until recently, we have thought of human 
history purely in terms of recorded history, 
which goes back a few thousand years. 
A pre-history adds a few more thousand 
years. But climate change science has 
required us to think about the place 
of humans in the history of the planet 
since they appeared. Because you had to 
understand what the planetary processes 
were and how the planet has managed 
to keep in place, not just the climate,

A lot of history told two stories 
− how humans eventually came to free 
themselves from the constraints placed 
on them by nature and natural causes; 
and how humans came to think of freeing 
themselves from the oppression of 
other humans. 
As I have become aware now, the history 
of our evolution plays a very significant 
role, even in our short-term histories. 
For instance, humans cannot ever make 
any objects that we handle without the 
assumption that we have opposable 
thumbs. This is a matter of a very slow 
evolutionary history, which we usually take 
for granted. So we would talk of what kind 
of swords the Mughals produced, or what 
kinds of knives were used in Baghdad 
– assuming that there’s always a human 
hand capable of holding or wielding these. 
That hand also has a slow history, which is 
the history of evolution. 
What do you mean when you say humans 
exert a geological force today? 
Human actions are now changing 
the climate of the whole planet. 
Taken together, we wield a kind of force 
that is so great that it can change the usual 
cycle of Ice Ages followed by interglacial 
periods – a cycle of, let us say, 130,000 
years. We have somehow acquired the 
role of a geological force − thanks to our 
pursuit of technology, population growth, 
and our capacity to spread ourselves all 
over the planet.
So far we have thought of human beings 
as biological agents, because we do things 
to our environment and to ourselves, 
we carry diseases, etc. We now have to 
scale up our imagination of the human 
− we are actually changing the face 
of the planet. It’s not just its face we’re 
changing − one of the places of the planet 
that human beings have transformed, 
and where our transformation will remain 
for the very long term, are the coastal 
sea beds − through deep-sea fishing, 
mining, etc. We can no longer separate 
the biological agency of humans from their 
geological agency. 
Several historians of the long term 
have suggested that, as we developed 
a big brain and developed technology, 
we began to grow at a pace much faster 
than the evolutionary pace. The argument 
is that if we acquired deep-sea fishing 
technology at the pace at which 
evolutionary changes usually happened, 
then the fish would also have had time 
to learn how to avoid our dragnets. 
But we developed so much faster, 
that our ecosystem didn’t have time to 
readjust. It’s a fascinating idea that this one 
species has kind of catapulted itself out of 
the Darwinian evolutionary scene. And it 
is having such an impact on the history of 
life that many biologists say that we might 
be driving the Sixth Great Extinction of life 
in the next 300 to 600 years.

Could you explain your thesis that 
the history of capital must be crossed 
with the history of the human species? 
People who study capitalism don’t 
study evolutionary biology. But if they 
did, they might find a species called 
Homo sapiens that was once able to 
invent a modern industrial society or 
capitalism, or whatever you want to call it 
− that became its strategy for taking over 
the whole planet, and dominating life on it. 
The spread of human beings all over the 
planet has only been possible in the last 
few thousand years. Capitalism is not as 
old as us, but if you look at what happened 
with the coming of big sailing ships, 
and then steamships, you can see that 
the continent of Europe itself distributed 
its population all over the world. 
So couldn’t one argue that capitalism was 
the strategy for the species to take over 
the whole planet? Now that does mean 
the differentiation between rich and poor 
people, I agree, but both the rich and the 
poor are members of the species.

Your remark that “the poor participate 
in the shared history of human evolution 
just as much as the rich do” has been 
critiqued by some of your colleagues. 
Could you explain? 
I am as perplexed by Andreas Malm’s 
response to some of my propositions 
that I thought were pretty much 
unexceptionable, as he is by my 
statements. I think the way he interprets 
my quote in his article (see page 24) is 
a little misleading. It gives the impression 
that I had suggested that the poor 
are immediately as responsible for carbon 
emissions as the rich. 
I have never made such a claim, 
for everyone knows that the poor do not 
emit as much greenhouse gases as the 
rich, and that only a handful of nations 
are responsible for the major portion of 
anthropogenic emissions of these gases. 
So that is not the point. 
The point is that Indian and Chinese 
arguments in defence of the use of coal 
and other fossil fuels (though this is being 
somewhat mitigated by the falling price 
of renewable sources of energy) in the 
interest of moving people out of poverty, 
acquire their significance from the fact that 
these are extremely populous nations and 
the number of poor people concerned is 
very large indeed.
The history of population, I suggested, 
belongs to two histories at once: 
the history of modernization, public 
health programmes, modern medicines, 
including antibiotics (in the production 
of which fossil fuels play a role), 
the eradication of pandemics, epidemics, 
and famines, etc; and the history of 
the human species. How could one 
deny that even poor humans belong to 
the species Homo sapiens? Don’t poor 
people have opposable thumbs? Are they 
not part of our evolutionary history? 
Never in the history of biological life on 
this planet have we had a species that 
managed to spread itself all over the world 
(that happened thousands of years ago, 
long before there was mass poverty) as 
humans have, and that also rose to the 
top of the food web in so short (in terms 
of evolutionary time) a period. If we do 
manage to improve the lives of seven 
billion, or eventually, nine billion people, 
the pressure on the biosphere will only 
increase. However, this is not an argument 
in favour of not improving the lives of 
the poor.
What I have tried to show in my work is 
the implication of most human beings’ 
desire to industrialize and modernize. Take 
the examples of Jawaharlal Nehru (India), 
Gamal Abdel Nasser (Egypt), Julius Nyerere 
(Tanzania) and other Third World leaders 
of the 1950s and 1960s. They all wanted to 
modernize their countries − not as people 
who were just fascinated by technology, 
but because they thought it was the ethical 
thing to do. The reason Nehru wanted to 
build dams was mainly to grow more food 
(through irrigation) and save people from 
dying in famines. 
The focus of political thinkers since 
the 1970s has been on human rights and 
on the flourishing of every individual 
human, irrespective of the numbers. 
Climate change and the attendant scientific 
propositions came at a time when we were 
enjoying precisely those things that climate 
scientists say may imperil our existence 
in the long run. 
How much is globalization responsible 
for this?
We have globalized in the last thirty 
or forty years, and this has been made 
possible by increasing the technologies of 
connectivity. We all like the fact that we can 
communicate with our loved ones across 
the globe on a daily basis, or that we can 
fly across the world in a matter of hours 
to explore other countries or do business 
there, or to visit friends and family.

The globalization story means that we 
have actually come to love what could 
lead to our geological end − the capacity 
to impact the planet on a massive scale. 
But in terms of our life experiences, we see 
it as a condition for human flourishing. 
There’s a natural inertia in us, born out of 
historical attachments – to institutions, 
family structures, globalization – and all we 
are capable of thinking of is our immediate 
future. Humans think in terms of seventy to 
eighty years, of three or four generations, 
at most. This makes it very hard for us to 
come together and act in a synchronized 
manner to fight climate change. We see 
how difficult climate change negotiations 
− under the United Nations Framework 
Convention on Climate Change (UNFCCC) 
− have been. Besides, every country is also 
invested in its own development agenda.
Now that we are aware that we are not the 
masters and owners of nature, what kind of 
stories do you suggest we tell? 
I think we should no longer tell stories 
of human hubris. I think the older story, 
that we are controlling nature, was a 
wrong story. The story we should tell is 
that here is a planet, which luckily for us, 
developed complex forms of life. We came 
to be here, and now we know that there 
is a planet-wide climatic system, that 
planetary processes − the geobiological 
and chemical processes − are important to 
our survival and to the survival of complex 
life. For instance, if you destroy soil, it takes 
millions of years to regenerate. 
So we should definitely be less profligate, 
we should somehow find a way of living 
where we live, rationally, intelligently, and 
not consume so much. We also need to 
find some rational, democratic, non-violent 
and poor-friendly ways of bringing the 
population down. 
How we get there is the most difficult 
question today. It’s also very hard in 
today’s world to tell people not to travel, 
or not to avail of the benefits of new 
technologies like smartphones, which 
we know deplete rare-earth materials. 
It is important to acknowledge our 
contradictions − between what we desire 
at the moment and the knowledge 
we have on climate change. 
We need to have a different kind of society 
– we cannot sustain the current kind of 
capitalism for the next 100 or 200 years. 
It’s not wrong to delegitimize consumerism 
and re-educate our own desires. And it is 
our responsibility to keep up this message, 
at universities and schools.
You have said that a crisis is a good time for 
renewed creativity. 
As the crisis deepens, so will the creative 
responses to it. I think there will be 
charismatic leaders who will break the 
shackles of consumerism and inspire us, 
as Mahatma Gandhi once did.

In the geological blink of an 
eye, a new sphere has emerged, 
and is evolving at a furious 
pace. Weighing thirty trillion 
tons, this is the technosphere. 
It includes a mass of carbon 
dioxide which is industrially 
emitted into the atmosphere 
– the equivalent of 150,000 
Egyptian Pyramids!
The Earth that sustains us may be 
considered in terms of different spheres. 
There is the lithosphere, made up of 
the rocky foundations of our planet; 
the hydrosphere, representing our 
planet’s water; and the cryosphere, 
comprising the frozen polar regions and 
high mountains. The atmosphere is the 
air we breathe, and we are also part of 
the biosphere, made up of the Earth’s living 
organisms. These spheres have been in 
existence, in one form or another, for most, 
or all, of our planet’s 4.6-billion-year 
existence. Most recently, a new sphere has 
emerged – the technosphere.
The technosphere, in the sense that we 
understand it, is a concept that has been 
developed by the American geologist 
and engineer Peter Haff, Professor 
Emeritus at Duke University, in the United 
States. Like the Anthropocene, it is 
growing rapidly in recognition – having, 
for instance, been the focus of a recent 
major initiative of Haus der Kulturen 
der Welt (House of World Culture), 
the international centre for contemporary 
arts in Berlin, Germany. 
Like the Anthropocene, the technosphere 
is controversial, not least because of 
the role – and constraints – it affords to 
humans. It suggests that we have far less 
freedom, collectively, to guide the Earth 
system, than we may think we have. 
The technosphere encompasses all of 
the technological objects manufactured 
by humans, but that is only part of it. 
It is a system, and not just a growing 
collection of technological hardware. 
This distinction is crucial, and may 
be illustrated by comparison with 
the more established concept of the 
biosphere. Originally coined by the 
nineteenth-century Austrian geologist 
Eduard Suess, the term biosphere was 
developed as a concept by Russian 
scientist Vladimir Vernadsky in the 
twentieth century. He propounded that 
it was not just the mass of living things 
on Earth, but the combination of that 
mass with the air, water and soil that 
sustain organic life and the Sun’s energy 
that largely powers it. More than the sum 
of its parts, the biosphere interlinks and 
overlaps with other spheres of the Earth, 
while having its own dynamics and 
emergent properties.

technosphere

Republic of the Congo (2015).

Tampering with nature
The technosphere, similarly, comprises 
not just our machines, but us humans too, 
and the professional and social systems 
by which we interact with technology 
– factories, schools, universities, trade 
unions, banks, political parties, the internet. 
It also includes the domestic animals that 
we grow in enormous numbers to feed 
us, the crops that are cultivated to sustain 
both them and us, and the agricultural soils 
that are extensively modified from their 
natural state to carry out this task.

Forming future fossils
One analogy here may help show the 
striking nature of this planetary newcomer. 
Technological objects, including 
mobile phones, may be considered 
technofossils geologically, because they 
are biologically-made constructs that are 
robust and resistant to decay; they will 
form future fossils, to characterize 
the strata of the Anthropocene.
Plastiglomerates, facsimiles of 
hypothetical future geological matter, 
made for the Manufacture of Rocks 
of the Future project, started in 2013 
by French  artist Jean-Pierre Brazs. 
The technosphere also includes roads, 
railways, airports, mines and quarries, 
oil and gas fields, cities, engineered 
rivers and reservoirs. It has generated 
extraordinary amounts of waste 
– from landfill sites to the pollution of air, 
soil and water. A proto-technosphere of 
some kind has been present throughout 
human history, but for much of this time, 
it took the form of isolated, scattered 
patches that were of little planetary 
significance. It has now become a globally 
interconnected system – a new and 
important development on our planet.
How big is the technosphere? One 
crude measure is to make an assessment 
of the mass of its physical parts, from 
cities and the dug-over and bulldozed 
ground that makes up their foundations, 
to agricultural land, to roads and railways, 
etc. An order-of-magnitude estimate here 
came to some thirty trillion tons of material 
that we use, or have used and discarded, 
on this planet. 
The physical parts of the technosphere 
are also very various. Simple tools like 
stone axes were made by our ancestors 
millions of years ago. But, there has been 
an enormous proliferation of different 
kinds of machines and manufactured 
objects since the Industrial Revolution, 
and especially since the Great Acceleration 
of population growth, industrialization 
and globalization of the mid-twentieth 
century. Technology, too, is evolving 
ever faster. Our pre-industrial ancestors 
saw little technological change from 
generation to generation. Now, in the 
space of little more than one human 
generation, mobile phones – to take but 
one example – have been introduced to 
mass public use and have gone through 
several generations. 
Nobody knows how many different kinds 
of technofossils there are, but they already 
almost certainly exceed the number 
of fossil species known, while modern 
technodiversity, considered this way, 
also exceeds modern biological diversity. 
The number of technofossil species is 
continually increasing too, as technological 
evolution now far outpaces 
biological evolution.

While almost all of the biosphere’s 
energy comes from the Sun, some of the 
technosphere is powered by solar energy 
too – and other renewable resources such 
as wind-power, but most is powered by 
the burning of hydrocarbons including oil, 
coal and gas. These non-renewable energy 
sources in effect represent fossilized 
sunshine that has been amassed deep 
in the Earth over hundreds of millions of 
years, and that is now being expended 
in just a few centuries. 
Humans have used power sources such as 
watermills for millennia, but the enormous 
burst of energy now needed to power 
the technosphere is on a completely 
different scale. One estimate suggests 
that humans have collectively expended 
more energy since the mid-twentieth 
century than in all of the preceding eleven 
millennia of the Holocene.
Inundated with waste
The technosphere, though, differs from 
the biosphere in one crucial respect. 
The biosphere is extremely good at 
recycling the material it is made of, and this 
facility has enabled it to persist on Earth 
for billions of years. The technosphere, 
by contrast, is poor at recycling. Some of 
the waste is all too obvious, like the plastics 
accumulating in the world’s oceans and on 
its shorelines. Other kinds, being colourless 
and odourless, are invisible to us, like the 
carbon dioxide from the burning of fossil 
fuels. The mass of industrially-emitted 
carbon dioxide in the atmosphere is now 
enormous – nearly one trillion tons, which 
is the equivalent of about 150,000 Egyptian 
Pyramids. This rapid growth in waste 
products, if unchecked, is a threat to the 
continued existence of the technosphere 
– and the humans that depend on it. 
The technosphere is an offshoot of the 
biosphere and, like it, is a complex system 
with its own dynamics. The capacity of 
our species to form sophisticated social 
structures and to develop and work 
with tools were important factors in its 
emergence. However, Haff emphasizes 
that humans are not so much creators 
and directors of the technosphere, 
as components within it, and therefore 
constrained to act to keep it in existence 
– not least because the technosphere 
keeps most of the current human 
population alive, through the supplies of 
food, shelter and other resources that it 
provides. Its development has allowed the 
human population to grow from the few 
tens of millions that could be kept alive by 
the hunter-gatherer mode of life in which 
our species evolved, to the 7.3 billion 
that inhabit the planet today. Just one 
technological innovation – artificial 
fertilizers made using the Haber-Bosch 
process – keeps about half the human 
population alive. 
The technosphere today is not evolving 
because it is being guided by some 
controlling human force, but because of 
the invention and emergence of useful 
technological novelties. There is now 
a kind of co-evolution of human and 
technological systems.
Altering planetary 
conditions
Currently, the technosphere might 
be regarded as parasitic on the 
biosphere, altering conditions of 
planetary habitability. Obvious 
consequences include greatly increased 
(and accelerating) rates of extinction 
of species of plants and animals, and 
changes to climate and ocean chemistry 
that are largely deleterious to existing 
biological communities. These changes 
can in turn damage both the functioning 
of the biosphere and human populations. 
Ideally, therefore, humans should try to 
help the technosphere develop into a form 
that is more sustainable in the long term. 
Nevertheless, humans collectively have 
no choice but to keep the technosphere 
operative – because it is now indispensable 
to our collective existence. 
Working out the degrees of freedom, 
within this context, for effective 
socio-economic and political action, 
is one of the challenges that the evolving 
technosphere presents us with. A first 
step here is to more fully understand 
the workings of this extraordinary new 
phase in the evolution of our planet. 
Here, there is  still much to do.

Many scientists view the massive 
disappearance of several 
varieties of Central American 
frogs as a sign of the Sixth 
Extinction. This is one of 
the indications that we are 
entering the Anthropocene, 
that some believe will mean 
the wiping out of a quarter 
of  the world’s mammals, 
forty per cent of amphibians, 
corals, and many other species. 
In Panama, scientists and 
national leaders are in a race 
against time to prevent 
a legendary species, the golden 
frog, from disappearing 
forever. Investigations have 
shown that humans are indeed 
responsible, having introduced 
into South America an invasive 
fungus that is highly toxic 
to amphibians.
According to a pre-Columbian legend 
from the heartlands of Central Panama, 
the golden frog brings good luck. Anyone 
who sees one or manages to capture one 
will have a happy future. Its bright yellow 
livery, speckled with coffee-coloured 
patches, was a source of delight for 
indigenous tribes, who thought that when 
the amphibian died, its tiny body turned 
to solid gold.
The little frog that 
lost its lustre
Discovered on the outskirts of the small 
town of El Valle de Antón and the Altos 
de Campana National Park, and endemic to 
the central area of the Isthmus of Panama, 
the golden frog – Atelopus zeteki – has long 
frequented and decorated the streams and 
rivers of the Panamanian jungle.  
Panama has made the golden frog 
an ecological and cultural symbol, 
even dedicating a national day – 14 August 
– to it. The frog is so popular that it 
adorns arts and crafts objects, jewellery, 
festival posters, and even lottery tickets. 
It also lends its name to hotels, craft beers 
and boutiques. This hasn’t stopped 
it from disappearing from the forests 
of the isthmus, though.
According to Panamanian herpetologist 
Roberto Ibáñez, a researcher at the 
Smithsonian Tropical Research Institute 
(STRI) in Panama, the first signs of decline 
were noticed between 1993 and 1996. 
Edgardo Griffith, a Panamanian biologist, 
remembers seeing dying frogs at the end 
of 2005, during an expedition in El Valle 
de Antón. 
It was not known why they were dying, 
but Griffith’s alarm coincided with other 
research questioning the status of the 
amphibian. The frogs were seen for the last 
time in the wild in 2007 – in a short video 
scene shot by the BBC for one of its Life 
in Cold Blood documentaries on reptiles 
and amphibians.
The cause of this massacre turned out 
to be Batrachochytrium dendrobatidis 
(also known as Bd), a chytrid fungus that 
is threatening the global population 
of amphibians by transmitting 
chytridiomycosis, a disease which, Ibáñez 
explains, “infects the frog’s skin, disturbing 
the way it functions”.

During the Golden Frog Festival, 
held every year at Smithsonian’s Punta 
Culebra Nature Center in Panama City, 
children learn more about the amphibian 
that has become the ecological 
and cultural symbol of their country.
One of the functions of the frog’s epidermis 
is to maintain the balance of water and 
mineral salts between the animal’s body 
and its environment. In frogs infected 
with Bd, the transport of electrolytes is 
disrupted, reducing concentrations of 
sodium and potassium in the blood, and 
leading to cardiac arrest.
An invasive fungus 
Where does Bd come from? Probably 
Africa. This is at least is the most widely 
accepted hypothesis among Panamanian 
biologists. The Bd chytrid occurs naturally 
in the epidermis of the South African 
amphibian, Xenopus laevis – the frogs were 
used extensively in human pregnancy 
tests starting in the 1930s. Unaware that 
Xenopus laevis was the vector for this 
disease, the amphibian test was exported 
to other parts of the world, causing the 
disease to spread.
In Panama, it is thought that the fungus 
was transmitted through contact with 
these amphibians, says Ibáñez. He points 
out that the chytrid has already spread 
throughout the country and is now 
infecting other amphibian species. 
As a result, the International Union 
for Conservation of Nature (IUCN) has 
classified Bd as one of 100 of the world’s 
worst invasive alien species, because of its 
“disastrous impact on biological diversity”.
Griffith describes it as a “very effective 
organism, which reduces biodiversity, 
changes demographics and the dynamics 
of reproduction, and wipes out 100 per 
cent of the individuals of certain species”. 
It is present everywhere – in Panama as 
well as in other Latin American countries.
A Noah’s Ark for 
amphibians 
Though no effective treatment against 
the disease is available today, scientists 
hope to reintroduce the golden frog 
to its natural habitat one day. In 2011, 
the government launched an Action Plan 
for the conservation of the amphibians 
of Panama. Involving three components 
– research, conservation, and education 
– it is a first step towards resolving 
the problem. The El Valle Amphibian 
Conservation Centre (EVACC Foundation), 
led by Griffith, is also working for the 
preservation of the golden frog – although, 
at this stage, it is still being kept in 
captivity. The Centre’s zoo is home to 
around 4,500 frogs, 1,000 of which are 
of the golden variety.
At the other end of the country, in Gamboa 
– at the edge of a tropical rainforest 
in the former Panama Canal area – 
Ibáñez directs the Amphibian Conservation 
and Rescue Project. Created ex situ in 2009, 
the project aims to ensure the reproduction 
of endangered species, especially those 
affected by the chytrid fungus. It’s a 
kind of Noah’s Ark, which uses captive 
specimens in an endeavour to reconstitute 
populations of the most threatened 
species – until an effective treatment is 
found for the Bd fungus. Based twenty-two 
kilometres outside Panama City, the centre 
holds 1,200 examples of frogs belonging 
to nine species – with the exception of 
the golden frog. But Ibáñez says he hopes to 
receive some specimens of Atelopus zeteki 
from EVACC by the end of 2018.
Will the golden frog regain its former 
lustre? The scientists are convinced it will. 
Until then, we must hope that the little 
creature will, itself, have the happy future 
it symbolizes for the people of Panama.

Climate change, by altering the world’s 
physical landscape, is also changing 
its geopolitical landscape. If governments 
are unable to mitigate this, the risks 
of conflict and instability will increase, 
and become more difficult to manage. 
This is the case in many regions 
around the globe. However, the Horn 
of Africa is particularly vulnerable, 
given a combination of structural fragilities 
and the significant exposure to climate 
change risks. This raises the likelihood 
of conflict and instability on the peninsula. 
Caitlin E. Werrell and Francesco Femia 
The effects of global warming 
on the world’s physical landscape 
often lead to geopolitical 
changes that threaten 
to destabilize already vulnerable 
regions, like the Horn of Africa. 
The stresses on natural resources 
undermine the capacity of 
nations to govern themselves, 
and increase the chances 
of conflicts. When compared 
to other drivers of international 
security risks, climate change 
can be modelled with a relatively 
high degree of certainty. 
But between predicting 
and preparing, there is still 
a long way to go.
The current rate of climate change 
– higher seas, decreased ice in the 
Arctic, melting glaciers, extreme rainfall 
variability, and more frequent and intense 
storms – are scenarios that settled 
human societies have never experienced 
before. These dynamics will impact 
the foundational resources that people, 
nations – and the world order built on 
those nations – depend on for survival, 
security and prosperity: particularly food 
and water. These impacts are already 
contributing to increased state fragility 
and security problems in key regions 
around the world – conflict in the Middle 
East and Africa, tensions over fisheries 
in the South China Sea, and a new political 
and economic battleground in a melting 
Arctic Ocean. 
Climate change raises 
conflict concerns
A fragile epicentre 
Over time, climate change stresses 
on natural resources – combined 
with demographic, economic and 
political pressures on those resources 
– can degrade a nation’s capacity to 
govern itself. This includes its ability 
to meet its citizens’ demands for basic 
resources – like food, water, energy and 
employment – also known as its output 
legitimacy. The threat to output legitimacy 
can contribute to state fragility, internal 
conflict, and even state collapse. 
Seen through this lens, climate change 
may present a serious challenge to state 
stability and legitimacy in the Horn 
of Africa – a region already grappling 
with numerous challenges before climate 
change became a factor.

These challenges have recently been 
confirmed by the United Nations Security 
Council in a January 2018 Statement 
by its President: “The Security Council 
recognises the adverse effects of climate 
change and ecological changes among 
other factors on the stability of West Africa 
and the Sahel region, including through 
drought, desertification, land degradation 
and food insecurity, and emphasizes 
the need for adequate risk assessments 
and risk management strategies by 
governments and the United Nations 
relating to these factors.” 
An elderly woman, displaced 
from her home during the Sudan 
conflict in 2008, waits for her ration 
of emergency food aid. 
Rising sea levels threaten to inundate 
critical infrastructure in these cities, 
contaminate freshwater supplies through 
saltwater intrusion, reduce arable land, 
and potentially displace large numbers 
of people.
The Gulf of Aden is a critical waterway 
along the Horn of Africa. As climate 
change further narrows economic 
opportunities in the region, an even 
greater increase of piracy along the coast 
is likely. Indeed, research has shown that 
there is a significant overlap between 
countries showing a high incidence of 
piracy attacks (off the coasts of Somalia 
and Eritrea), and the most significant 
climate vulnerability in Africa. This paints 
a worrying picture of the kinds of 
overlapping risks that can perpetuate 
state failure in the Horn.
Ocean acidification and warming are 
contributing to the migration and 
depletion of fish stocks around the world, 
including along the coast of the Horn 
of Africa – though the lack of extensive 
monitoring in this region means there is a 
gap in the knowledge of the extent of the 
impacts. Changing ocean chemistry and 
temperatures can increase the likelihood of 
international tensions between countries 
and subnational actors of the Horn that 
share a coastline – including a heightened 
potential for conflict over fishing, as their 
respective fishing fleets roam into 
neighbouring waters, or compete over 
dwindling stocks in international waters. 
Droughts, coupled with other factors, 
are already increasing pressure on 
people in Africa and elsewhere to move. 
Those without the means to move also 
risk becoming “trapped”, or unable to 
move to more secure locations. In the 
future, decreases in precipitation in the 
Horn, and increases in extreme weather 
events, will likely increase the rate and 
scale of migration. According to Robert 
McLeman of Canada’s Wilfrid Laurier 
University: “States that are already 
politically fragile are the most likely 
future epicenters for climate-related 
violence and forced migration events” 
(Epicenters of Climate and Security, 
June 2017). Indeed, of the twenty 
highest-ranked countries that are deemed 
fragile states, twelve are situated in areas 
of the Middle East, South Asia, and Africa, 
where climate change is expected to 
create heightened levels of water scarcity. 
That includes five countries of the Horn: 
Eritrea, Kenya, Somalia, South Sudan 
and Sudan.
According to the Fragile States Index of 
The Fund for Peace, the Horn of Africa 
includes some of the most vulnerable states 
in the world – Somalia, Ethiopia, Eritrea, 
Kenya, Sudan and South Sudan. The region 
also exhibits some of the clearest indications 
of a connection between climate change 
and conflict – namely, conflicts between 
agricultural and pastoral communities 
precipitated by climate-exacerbated 
droughts and water variability. 
For example, prolonged 
climate-exacerbated extreme drought, such 
as in Somalia in 2011, can add additional 
stresses to already tense and resource-scarce 
scenarios. These stresses could increase 
tensions and conflict between communities, 
and precipitate the need for people to move 
– impacting the prices of livestock and other 
goods. This could also lead to an increase 
in malnutrition and disease outbreaks, and 
adversely impact food security (For more 
information, see: American Journal of 
Agricultural Economics, Volume 96, Issue 4, 
1 July 2014, pp. 1157–1182). 
Local tensions over access to food 
and water resources can spill over into 
neighbouring countries, as people seek 
to find additional resources and safety 
– placing more strain on the resources 
of those countries, which could amplify 
tensions. In these instances, climate change 
does not directly cause conflict over 
diminishing access to water, for example, 
but it multiplies underlying natural-resource 
stresses, increasing chances of a conflict. 
These are scenarios that, in the absence of 
better governance and natural resource 
management, are going to become 
increasingly pronounced in the future.
Changing geopolitical 
landscape
Several studies, combined with models and 
foresight exercises, show with increasing 
accuracy, the way in which changes in 
climatic conditions can, if left unmitigated, 
scale up to higher-order security situations, 
including a higher likelihood of conflict. A 
lot of the research to this point, however, 
has focused on the links between climate 
change, increased rainfall variability, 
and conflict. Other scenarios in which 
climate impacts and security intersect and 
combine to form the foundation of a new 
geopolitical landscape include:
Urbanization is occurring rapidly in 
the Horn of Africa, including along the 
coast. Coastal cities with burgeoning 
populations, like Mogadishu (Somalia), 
Djibouti City and Mombasa (Kenya) are 
vulnerable to sea-level rise.

Changes in water availability, including 
increased scarcity of, and access to, water 
exacerbated by a changing climate, 
also open up opportunities for states 
and non-state actors to use water as a 
weapon. In a recent study by Marcus 
King of George Washington University, 
United States, discusses how Somalia has 
been especially prone to this nexus of 
climate, conflict and water weaponization 
(Epicenters of Climate and Security, 
June 2017). In 2011, Somalia was hit by 
regional droughts that have been linked 
to climate change. During this time, as 
King notes, jihadist fundamentalist group 
“Al-Shabaab changed its traditional 
guerilla tactics and started to cut off 
liberated cities from their water sources 
so that they could demonstrate at least 
some kind of power and presence. 
Climate change, lack of food and 
continued conflict involving water 
weaponization took an enormous social 
toll. Limited access of humanitarian 
agencies exacerbated by al-Shabaab’s 
actions led to more than a quarter million 
deaths and hundreds of thousands 
of displaced persons.”
A small silver lining
While droughts and extreme weather 
events are not new to this region, the rate 
of change and the decrease in recovery 
time between extreme weather events 
will place additional pressures on 
governments already stretched thin. 
These dynamics can make state instability 
and conflict more likely and enduring. 
However, there is a small silver lining 
– climate change, especially when 
compared to other drivers of international 
security risks, can be modelled with 
a relatively high degree of certainty. 
While significant uncertainties in 
predicting local-scale climatic changes 
remain, existing projections from climate 
models paint a fairly clear picture of what 
the future holds. This provides a basis 
for governments and societies to plan 
accordingly. However, this heightened 
predictive capacity does not, by itself, 
lead to preparedness. 
Changing minds, 
not the climate
UNESCO has more than thirty 
programmes to help us understand 
and deal with the challenges posed 
by climate change, and to raise 
awareness of the ethical implications 
raised by this major issue of our times.
By defining the global ethical 
principles surrounding climate 
change, the Organization provides 
guidelines for decision-making and policy choices to help counteract the morally 
unacceptable damage and injustice it brings. The mainstays of the Declaration of 
Ethical Principles, adopted in November 2017, include the prevention of harm, 
a precautionary approach, equity and justice, sustainable development, solidarity, 
scientific knowledge and integrity in decision-making.
UNESCO also helps Member States to adapt to climate change, to mitigate 
its impact, to educate societies on sustainable development (ESD) and to assess 
the risks of natural disasters. Through its International Hydrological Programme 
(IHP), UNESCO facilitates scientific cooperation to assess and monitor changes 
affecting water resources. Its Man and the Biosphere Programme (MAB) aims to 
improve the livelihoods of people while preserving ecosystems. The biosphere 
reserves managed by MAB, along with the World Heritage sites and the global 
geoparks network, all act as observatories for climate change.
The Organization pays particular attention the health of the oceans, which 
regulate the climate and capture nearly a third of carbon emissions. As a result 
of the increase in greenhouse gas emissions, coastal pollution, overfishing 
and population pressures, the coasts and marine ecosystems are undergoing major 
changes. These particularly affect Small Island Developing States (SIDS), for which 
UNESCO has formulated an action plan.
UNESCO’s strategy is part of a comprehensive approach defined by the United 
Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change (UNFCCC). Since the 2015 
Paris Climate Change Conference (COP 21), UNESCO has presented its various 
initiatives at each of the annual conferences. Its exhibition stands have become 
meeting places to promote debates and discussions with the public and civil 
society. The need to change mentalities is no longer in dispute. What is needed 
is an in-depth understanding of the issues underlying this global challenge. 
This involves raising awareness and educating people about sustainable 
development. “Changing minds, not the climate” is UNESCO’s central message 
on the issue.

The combination of “unprecedented risk” 
and “unprecedented foresight” underlines 
the case for a “Responsibility to Prepare” 
(Briefing to the UN Security Council, 
December 2017) – a responsibility 
of sub-national, national, 
and intergovernmental institutions to 
build climate resilience into the Horn 
of Africa’s regional order. A failure to meet 
this responsibility could significantly 
strain regional stability in the Horn, 
and around the world.
Caitlin E. Werrell and Francesco Femia 
are the Co-Founders and Presidents 
of the Center for Climate and Security. 
The Washington DC-based, non-partisan 
policy centre, which has a team 
and an Advisory Board of distinguished 
security and military experts, is the only 
institution exclusively focused on 
the security risks of climate change.

Roads were being rebuilt and new 
settlements constructed to house 
the survivors.
Six weeks after I left, on 18 September 
2017, Hurricane Maria suddenly 
accelerated to a Category 5 system 
– one of the most explosive 
intensifications of a hurricane on record 
– and slammed straight into Dominica. 
Over one night, the green island turned 
brown. The extraordinarily ferocious 
winds simply blew away the forest cover. 
Andreas Malm
Climate change is not 
the creation of the mere 
existence of billions of humans 
who inhabit the planet, 
but is wrought by the few 
who control the means of 
production and make the central 
decisions about energy 
use, argues Andreas Malm. 
In what is more Capitalocene 
than Anthropocene, a head-on 
confrontation with fossil capital 
is imperative if we are to prevent 
extreme climate events 
like the hurricanes that have 
devastated Dominica. 
Dominica used to be an emerald hill-range, 
rising straight out of the Caribbean Sea. 
When I visited the island nation in August 
2017, it remained covered by impossibly 
green woods, every peak and ravine 
bursting with vegetation. The most 
mountainous island in the region, with 
the greatest intact forest cover, it was a 
marvel of natural splendour, but poor. 
Most of the 70,000 inhabitants – the vast 
majority, African descendants – subsisted 
on small-scale farming. The banana, 
plantain and yam were supplemented with 
some fishing and a little bit of tourism.
The island had already suffered an early 
blow. In 2015, Tropical Storm Erika poured 
out torrents of water over the hills, until 
some of them gave way and collapsed. 
At the time of my visit, the country 
was still licking its wounds from that 
disaster, clearly visible in the south-east, 
where the slopes were cut up by the 
landslides that had carried away top-soil 
and trees and houses. 
The view from Dominica: 
Anthropocene 
or
 Capitalocene? 
Incalculable sense 
of loss
Leaves and branches were scattered 
over the sea, naked trunks left standing 
in what looked like clear-felled areas 
– if Erika had scratched the island, 
Maria flayed it. This time the entire 
infrastructure – houses, roads, bridges, 
hospitals, schools – was pulverized 
and the agricultural sector obliterated. 
The financial cost was estimated at twice 
the country’s Gross Domestic Product 
(GDP), but, as the IRIN news agency 
reported, “the deeper sense of loss is off 
the spectrum”.

The Anthropocene narrative is flawed 
because it distorts and obfuscates that 
reality – not by saying that human actions 
have caused climate change, which is an 
incontrovertible fact, but by sliding from 
that observation into the depiction of the 
human species as a unified protagonist. 
It is anything but. 
For the past few thousands of years, as long 
as class societies have existed, Homo sapiens 
has been a deeply fractured entity, and never 
more so than in this rapidly warming 
world – where the world’s eight richest 
men own as much wealth ($426 billion) as 
the poorest half of the world’s population 
combined ($409 billion), according to Oxfam, 
the charity (January 2017). 
In the first month after Maria, a fifth 
of the population picked up what few 
possessions could be salvaged, and left. 
Those who stayed spoke of themselves as 
soldiers on a battlefield: martial discourse 
swept the country. Five days after the 
hurricane, Prime Minister Roosevelt Skerrit, 
himself now homeless, addressed the 
United Nations General Assembly: “I come 
to you straight from the frontline of the 
war (…). As Dominicans bear the brunt 
of climate change, we are shouldering 
the consequences of the actions of 
others, actions that endanger our very 
existence, and all for the enrichment of 
a few elsewhere.” 
The descendants of the slaves that inhabit 
Dominica had done nothing to heat up this 
planet, and neither had the tiny surviving 
indigenous population. Subsistence 
farmers who resorted to taxi-driving 
or street-vending to supplement their 
incomes, they had negligible carbon 
footprints and zero power over global 
energy supplies. Yet, in the assault from 
the hyper-hurricane, the main victims were 
precisely these farmers: they were killed, 
their lives laid to waste, the very land they 
stood on destroyed. 
Are we all responsible?
In the discourse about climate change, 
as it has developed in Western academia, 
media and policy-making circles over 
the past decade or so, another storyline 
has taken hold. It says that the problem 
has been created by all of us. Global 
warming is the fault of the human species 
as a whole. We live in the Anthropocene, 
the epoch when our particular species 
has overtaken the natural forces in 
determining the trajectory of this planet, 
most obviously in the realm of climate 
– and so humans in general are responsible 
for the ensuing catastrophes. 
An explicit statement of this logic can be 
found in one of the most celebrated books 
on the topic in recent years – Indian author 
Amitav Ghosh’s The Great Derangement: 
Climate Change and the Unthinkable (2017), 
where we learn that global warming 
“is the unintended consequence of the 
very existence of human beings as a 
species.” More than that, it is “the product 
of the totality of human actions over time. 
Every human being who has ever lived has 
played a part in making us the dominant 
species on this planet, and in this sense 
every human being, past and present, 
has contributed to the present cycle of 
climate change.” On this view, the average 
coffee-grower on Dominica contributed to 
Maria merely by dint of belonging to the 
Homo sapiens species. So did her ancestor 
slaves who were brought to the island. So 
did the Kalinago people, living there in 
peace before Europeans made landfall on 
the island in 1492. 
Flawed narrative
It is exceedingly difficult to see what 
scientific grounds there could be for such 
a view, but a multitude of intellectuals 
expounding on the Anthropocene 
have made similar statements. To pick 
just one other case, historian Dipesh 
Chakrabarty (see page 11) , perhaps the 
most influential interpreter of the concept 
in the humanities and social sciences, has 
argued that when it comes to producing 
climate change, “the poor participate 
in that shared history of human evolution 
just as much as the rich do.” (Chakrabarty 
D, 2014, Climate and Capital: On Conjoined 
Histories, Critical Inquiry 41, no. 1, 
The University of Chicago Press Journals.) 
On this view, Maria was more a suicide 
than a blitzkrieg. It was a case of the 
chickens coming home to roost among 
some of their original breeders, with no 
particularly flagrant injustice involved. 
From the denuded hillsides of Dominica, 
the reality, of course, looks very different.

The people of Dominica and their many 
fellows of misfortune around the world 
– set to multiply every coming year 
unless a head-on confrontation with 
fossil capital begins right about now 
– have never lived in what is termed the 
Anthropocene and their actions cannot 
be blamed for causing harm to the planet. 
They suffer the blows from an age more 
appropriately labelled the Capitalocene. 
It is a form of structural, systematic 
war, but we can expect the sudden 
shock-and-awe events to become more 
frequent in the years ahead. A more open 
question is when, or if, the fight-back will 
ever begin. Blaming the human species 
won’t make it happen.
Andreas Malm (Sweden) teaches human 
ecology at Lund University, Sweden. 
He is the author of several books, including, 
most recently, The Progress of This Storm: 
Nature and Society in a Warming World (2018).
Wealth is known to correlate closely with 
carbon dioxide emissions. It is the sign of 
profits from business-as-usual and the best 
proof against its consequences. Soaked 
in fossil fuels, it is the engine of the storm. 
Plastic epidemic
We are being told that climate change is 
created by an anonymous mass of millions 
and billions of humans, when, as American 
geographer Matt Huber has recently 
argued, it is in reality, a very narrow 
segment of the species that controls 
the means of production and makes the 
central decisions about energy use. That 
segment operates with one goal in sight 
– expanding its riches further. The process 
is known as capital accumulation, 
and it grinds on relentlessly, with no regard 
for the fate of Dominicans or the ever more 
desperate alarms from climate science. 
To take but one example, in December 
2017, The Guardian newspaper 
reported that the production of plastics 
in the United States is set to increase 
by forty per cent in the next decade 
– since ExxonMobil, Shell and other fossil 
fuel corporations have used the ongoing 
shale gas boom to invest massively 
in new plastic plants. They will lock 
the American – and by extension, the 
global – economy, even deeper into its 
addiction to plastic products. These will 
eventually make their way to beaches 
around the world, and to fossil fuels, the 
heat from which will find new islands to 
devastate. From the standpoint of capital, 
that is exactly the right thing to do: 
invest in the production and consumption 
of fossil fuels to generate profit. 
It is this process that has fuelled global 
warming from the very start.

Francis Chateauraynaud, 
interviewed by Régis Meyran
The debates sparked off by 
the Anthropocene have real 
scientific stakes, since they 
could play a role in forging 
a global model of the evolution 
of planetary equilibria. 
But the interpretations could 
get distorted by those who 
use the term to prophesy the 
end of the world – an approach 
which is counter-productive, 
argues Francis Chateauraynaud.
You have been studying scientific 
controversies for a long time. What do 
you think of the debates around the 
Anthropocene?
This is an important debate – scientists 
are looking for a global model for the 
planet, which, for the time being, has 
not been consolidated. It’s a question of 
establishing a formal system that sets 
the laws governing the functioning of 
Planet Earth, by thinking on a global 
scale and integrating many variables 
that were previously disconnected. 
With the computing power available to us 
today, it is possible to construct a model 
of the biosphere and to run simulations 
to study the variations that occur when 
parameters − such as ocean temperatures 
and acidity – change.
Stop the
 catastrophist
discourse!
As a hypothesis, the Anthropocene 
is of interest to both geologists and 
archaeologists, who deal with radioactive or 
chemical residues in the soil. The question 
remains whether it is really necessary to talk 
about a new geological epoch that would 
follow the Holocene. The relevance of the 
term Anthropocene will certainly become 
clearer over time, and it is normal that it 
should be debated. Some authors, such as 
the American academic Jason W. Moore 
and Swedish author Andreas Malm, 
prefer to speak of the Capitalocene. 
This reclassification is questionable, though, 
given the large ecological footprint of the 
former Union of Soviet Socialist Republics 
(USSR) in the twentieth century.
In fact, it is not so much the term 
Anthropocene that poses a problem as 
the predictability of the model, on the 
one hand, and the temptation to embrace 
catastrophism or determinism, on the other.

Speculation, Passion and Anxiety, 
acrylic on canvas, 2001, by the French 
and Canadian artist-philosopher 
Hervé Fischer.
Could you tell us more about this tendency 
towards catastrophism?
One problem comes from the way in 
which many experts speak on behalf 
of all humanity, by using the pronoun 
“we”. The historian Dipesh Chakrabarty 
has questioned the function this “we” 
might serve. To attribute phenomena to 
humanity as a whole is to forget or mask 
the fact that many people, who are living in 
poverty or are from minorities, play almost 
no part in the advent of the Anthropocene.
The other problem is the idea that “we” 
have already embarked on this fatal 
trajectory. To give you an example, 
in November 2017, the French daily, 
Le Monde, published an open letter 
“to humanity” signed by 15,000 scientists, 
titled “It will soon be too late”. 
There are always individuals, groups, 
cities or regions that are inventing 
alternatives and new possibilities. 
The book that I co-authored with 
Josquin Debaz, Aux bords de l’irréversible 
[On the Edge of the Irreversible, 2017] 
traces the emergence of a multiplicity of 
“counter-Anthropocenes” – other possible 
worlds that are forged in the interstices. 
While they often appear as forms of 
“resistance”, they generate other modes of 
acting and of the perception of the world.
Take, for example, the plan to 
build a new international airport at 
Notre-Dame-des-Landes in France. 
First initiated in the 1960s, the project was 
relaunched in the early 2000s. Found to be 
inconsistent with the COP21 (Paris, 2015) 
declarations on combating climate change, 
it was finally abandoned in January 2018 
under pressure from activists. Central 
to the civic resistance organized by the 
citizens of Notre-Dame-des-Landes was 
their collective ability to reverse the order 
of priorities.
The movements around farmers’ seed 
systems and permaculture are inspired 
by the functioning of traditional 
ecosystems and knowledge, while aiming 
for self-sufficiency. As with cities in 
transition, multiple collective experiences 
work together to redefine and manage 
common goods, fuelling new ideas 
for shaping policy.
The future remains open. Every humanist 
has a duty to prove the prophets 
of catastrophism wrong. There are 
countless places on this planet 
where people are already struggling 
to overcome the devastating effects 
of the techno-industrial hubris.
Francis Chateauraynaud (France) is 
a sociologist and Research Director at 
the École des Hautes Études en Sciences 
Sociales (EHESS, School of Advanced 
Studies in the Social Sciences) in Paris. 
His most recent book, co-authored 
with Josquin Debaz, is Aux bords 
de l’irréversible. Sociologie pragmatique 
des transformations (2017).
While a measure of reversibility is implied 
in the adverb “soon”, a marker like “too late”, 
and the repetition of stock phrases 
such as “we have failed” or “we did not 
succeed in”, put us on the slippery slope 
of catastrophism.
The global thinker (the intellectual who 
thinks of the world in its global dimension) 
finds a form of legitimacy here for his 
flights of fancy and can unfold a great 
narrative, encompassing all the complexity 
of the world in a few stock phrases. Even 
the French sociologist Bruno Latour has 
entered the field, with his book Face à 
Gaïa (2015). The temptation to prophesy 
fuels writings on “collapsology”, like the 
book by French researchers Pablo Servigne 
and Raphaël Stevens, Comment tout peut 
s’effondrer [How Everything Might Collapse, 
2015]. While these authors base their 
arguments on data that few would dispute, 
the way in which they are assembled into 
an end-of-the-world narrative is problematic.
The main criticism against the catastrophist 
argument is that it doesn’t work. 
The “heuristics of fear” theory, put forward 
years ago by the German philosopher 
Hans Jonas (1903-1993) – who believed 
that only fearing the worst was enough to 
raise consciousness – is no longer relevant 
in the contemporary context. It’s all very 
well for great minds to sign ominous 
open letters, but this doesn’t bring us any 
closer to solutions. The task of scientists 
is not to announce the inevitability 
of a catastrophe, but to tackle problems 
at different levels of action.
Catastrophist arguments may be futile, 
but they are successful...
Not only are they successful, 
they also provoke hostile reactions. 
Ecology ends up getting confused 
with catastrophism. Groups like the 
Association française pour l’information 
scientifique (French Association for 
Scientific Information (AFIS)) have even 
back-pedalled, proclaiming that we 
have never been happier on this planet. 
In these polemics, the arguments of 
groups like AFIS are all the more successful 
because they do not call on the public 
to do anything.
Concretely, though, can we avoid a 
catastrophe?
First of all, there are many kinds of 
catastrophes. To announce a final global 
catastrophe is to ignore the real facts. 
It is important to avoid endorsing a 
closed-off vision of the future, even if it is 
supported by institutions, and to unlock 
possible futures.

A lexicon 
for the Anthropocene
Geological epoch: 
The geological timescale is 
characterized by different kinds 
of time units – eons, eras, periods, 
epochs, and ages. To be recognized 
as such, each subdivision must have 
palaeo-environmental (climatic features), 
palaeontological  (fossil types) and 
sedimentological (resulting from 
erosion by living beings, soils, rocks, 
alluvion, etc.) conditions, that are similar 
and homogenous. The International 
Commission of Stratigraphy and 
the International Union of Geological 
Sciences (IUGS) set the global standards 
for geological timescales. We are currently 
living in the Holocene epoch, which is 
associated with human sedentism 
and agriculture. If all the above conditions 
are met, the Anthropocene could soon 
be defined as a new geological epoch. 
Capitalocene: This term was put 
forward by American environmental 
historian and historical geographer Jason 
W. Moore, who preferred to use the term 
Capitalocene rather than Anthropocene. 
According to him, it is capitalism that 
has created the global ecological crisis 
leading us to a change of geological era. 
A variant of the Capitalocene, the notion 
of Occidentalocene, affirmed notably by 
the French historian Christophe Bonneuil, 
holds that responsibility for climate change 
lies with industrialized Western nations 
and not the poorest countries. 
Co-evolution of genes and culture: 
According to American sociobiologist 
Edward O. Wilson, genes have made 
possible the emergence of the human 
mind and human culture (language, 
kinship, religion, etc.) and, conversely, 
cultural traits could favour genetic 
evolution in return. This happens through 
the stabilization of certain genes that give 
a selective advantage to members of the 
group in which the cultural behaviour 
is observed. Several anthropologists 
and biologists have criticized this idea 
of “co-evolution” between genes and 
culture, arguing that the transmission of 
cultural traits is a volatile phenomenon 
that does not obey the laws of Darwinian 
evolution. They also argue that, over 
the past 50,000 years, humankind 
has experienced significant cultural 
transformations, whereas the human 
gene pool has remained unaltered 
(with only a few exceptions).
Ecological footprint: According to 
the Global Footprint Network, this term 
is “a measure of how much area of 
biologically productive land and water 
an individual, population or activity 
requires to produce all the resources 
it consumes and to absorb the waste 
it generates, using prevailing technology 
and resource management practices”.
In order to understand 
the ongoing debates about 
the Anthropocene, it is not 
enough to know just the word 
– coined in 1980 by American 
biologist Eugene F. Stoermer 
and popularized in the early 
2000s by the Dutch atmospheric 
scientist Paul Crutzen. 
Here is an overview of some 
key technical terms.
Biocapacity: This concept was 
first put forward in the early 1990s 
by the Swiss sustainability advocate, 
Mathis Wackernagel, and Canadian 
ecologist William Rees. Their research 
on the biological capacity of the planet 
required by a given human activity, 
led them to define two indicators: 
biocapacity and the ecological footprint 
(see below). Since 2003, these two 
indicators have been calculated and 
developed by the Global Footprint 
Network, which defines biocapacity as 
“the ecosystems’ capacity to produce 
biological materials used by people and 
to absorb waste material generated 
by humans, under current management 
schemes and extraction technologies”.

Great 
Divergence: 
The expression 
“Great Divergence”, 
coined by American 
historian Kenneth Pomeranz, 
designates the industrial 
boom that has separated Europe 
from China since the nineteenth 
century. According to Pomeranz, it was 
the unequal geographical distribution 
of coal resources and the conquest 
of the New World that gave the decisive 
impetus to the European economy.
Planet (as a unit of measurement): 
The ecological footprint has a “planet 
equivalent”, or the number of planets 
it would take to support humanity’s 
needs at any given time. In order 
to determine a country’s ecological 
footprint, we measure the number 
of planets that would have been needed 
by the world’s population if it consumed 
as much as the population of that 
country. According to the World Wildlife 
Fund (WWF), “every year, humanity 
consumes the equivalent of 1.7 planets 
to meet its needs”. 
Sixth Extinction: The Great Extinction 
is the term given to a brief event in 
geological time (several million years) 
during which at least 75 per cent of 
species of plants and animals disappear 
from the surface of the earth and the 
oceans. Of the five Great Extinctions that 
have been recorded, the best known is 
the Cretaceous-Tertiary, 66 million years 
ago, which included the disappearance 
of the dinosaurs. The American 
biologist Paul Ehrlich has suggested 
that we have now entered the sixth 
Great Extinction (although, for the time 
being, its destruction in terms of number 
of species is considerably less than in 
the five others) – 40 per cent of the planet’s 
mammals will have seen their habitat 
range reduced by 80 per cent between 
1900 and 2015.
Spheres: For the Russian mineralogist 
and geologist Vladimir Vernadsky, 
who devised the concept of biosphere 
in 1926, Planet Earth is made up of the 
intermeshing of five distinct spheres 
– the lithosphere, the rigid, rock outer 
layer; the biosphere, comprising all living 
beings; the atmosphere, the envelope 
of gases known as air; the technosphere 
resulting from human activity; and the 
noosphere, the part of the biosphere 
occupied by thinking humanity, including 
all thoughts and ideas. Other authors 
have since added to this list the notions 
of hydrosphere (all the water present 
on the planet) and cryosphere (ice).
Technodiversity: The word biodiversity 
refers to the diversity of ecosystems, species 
and genes, and the interaction between 
these three levels, in a given environment. 
By analogy, technodiversity refers to 
the diversity of technological objects and 
the materials used to make them.
Technofossils: Fossils are the mineralized 
remains of individuals that lived in the past. 
By analogy, technofossils are the remains 
of technological objects. 
Technosphere: The technosphere refers 
to the physical part of the environment 
that is modified by human activity. 
It is a globally interconnected system, 
comprising humans, domesticated 
animals, farmland, machines, towns, 
factories, roads and networks, airports, etc.
Great Acceleration: Scientists are 
in agreement that, since the 1950s, 
ecosystems have been modified more 
rapidly and profoundly than ever 
before – under the combined effects 
of the unprecedented increase in mass 
consumption (in countries belonging 
to the Organisation for Economic 
Co-operation and Development (OECD)), 
dramatic population growth, economic 
growth and urbanization. The American 
chemist Will Steffen dubbed this 
phenomenon the “Great Acceleration”.

An ordinary day in 
the life of Qello
Text: Katerina Markelova
Photos: Ignacio Marín
If Qello, the heroine of this photo feature 
(shot in November 2017) goes to school 
today, it is because she is lucky. Just 30.4% 
of Ethiopian girls of secondary school age 
are able to go to school (UNESCO Institute 
for Statistics (UIS), 2015). 
Qello, who is 13 years old, has already 
taken the first step towards realizing 
her fundamental right to education 
– she has not abandoned primary school, 
like 61% of her young compatriots (UIS, 
2014). But will she be able to enter upper 
secondary school? Only 17% of girls 
(gross enrolment rate*) passed this level 
in 2015. 
In Ethiopia, in spite of a relatively high 
rate of enrolment of girls in primary 
school – 82% in 2015 – only one girl in 
two (47% in 2007) between the ages 
of 15 and 24 years can read, write and 
understand a short and simple text 
about their daily lives. This is the logical 
consequence of an acute shortage 
of teachers – there was one teacher for 
fifty-five pupils at the primary level in 2011.
Will Qello’s little brother face as many 
obstacles during his schooling? He will 
have a slightly better chance of going to 
primary school (the enrolment rate for 
boys was 88.5% in 2015), and secondary 
school (31.4% in 2015). 
Once she returns home with the firewood, 
Qello makes some coffee.

Qello spends a few minutes on herself, taking a morning wash. 
He will also probably spend one more year 
at school – the school life expectancy** 
for boys was 8.9 years in 2012, compared 
to 7.9 years for girls. 
Even though boys and girls have almost 
equal access to compulsory schooling 
(from 7 to 14 years), the situation 
in Ethiopia is not very encouraging. 
About 2.2 million children and 4.6 million 
adolescents (2015) have had no schooling 
in this sub-Saharan African country with 
a population of 102 million.
Today, 59 million children, or 9% of 
the primary school-aged population 
worldwide, do not go to school. Just over 
half of these children live in sub-Saharan 
Africa, a region with the highest rates 
of exclusion from education. 
Some 17 million of them are girls 
– 9 million girls between 6 and 11 
will never go to school, as against 
6 million boys (UIS).
Gender equality is Target 1 of Sustainable 
Development Goal 4, which aims to 
ensure equal and quality education for 
all, and to promote lifelong learning 
opportunities by 2030. UNESCO, 
as the United Nations specialized 
agency for education, was entrusted 
to lead the Education 2030 Framework 
for Action, adopted in November 2015.  
The main responsibility for implementing 
this agenda lies with governments, 
with UNESCO and its partners providing 
support through advice on coordinated 
policy formulation, technical assistance, 
capacity-building and monitoring 
of progress at the global, regional 
and national levels.
*Gross enrolment rate: the number 
of students enrolled in a given level 
of education, regardless of age, 
expressed as a percentage of the official 
school-age population corresponding  
to the same level of education. 
**School life expectancy: 
the number of years a child is likely 
to spend in the school and university 
education system.

Back from school, Qello prepares a meal for the family. Traditionally, domestic duties are seen as essential “training” 
for girls, preparing them for their future lives as wives and mothers. 
“Two‐thirds of Qello’s girlfriends will be forcibly married at an early age. The vast majority of them will drop out 
from school soon after their wedding day,” explains Ana Sendagorta, Director of the Pablo Horstmann Foundation.

My intention is to think about a major 
crisis – the ecological crisis, which we 
agree, defines the era we are living 
in − by showing how the history of 
philosophy can shed light on it and give 
us guidance on the actions we must take 
to deal with it. More precisely, I would 
like to show how there is continuity 
between the way philosophy helps us 
to consider a policy of humanity and 
the way it illuminates a policy of the 
“humanization of the Earth”, in the 
words of the French philosopher and 
theologian Pierre Teilhard de Chardin 
(1881-1955). I use this expression as 
signifying the duty and the responsibility 
that the human has to act accordingly, 
from the moment he understands that 
nature is entrusted to him and to humanity 
in the future. It forbids me to consider 
myself as “nature’s master and owner”, 
to cite the well-known phrase by the 
seventeenth-century French philosopher, 
René Descartes.On this point, regarding 
a philosophy that is simultaneously 
spiritual and ecological, I would like to 
evoke the ideas of the Andalusian scholar 
Abu Bakr Ibn Tufayl (1105-1185). They are 
masterfully expressed in his magnum opus, 
the philosophical novel Hayy ibn Yaqzān. 
He presents the idea that humans realize 
their humanity fully only when they reach 
ecological consciousness − which allows 
them to simultaneously understand 
the evolution of their own becoming 
and the responsibility which is incumbent 
on them to protect life on earth.
We, the servants and tenants of
Earth
Souleymane Bachir Diagne
To meet the challenge that the global ecological crisis presents 
today, there is an urgent need to draw on humanity’s philosophical 
and spiritual repertoire – because it teaches us valuable lessons on 
the importance of taking care of life in all its forms. Souleymane Bachir 
Diagne draws on this source here, by blending the philosophical novel 
of a twelfth-century Andalusian scholar, African words of wisdom 
and thoughts from Western philosophers. We are not nature’s masters 
and owners, the Senegalese philosopher warns us.
Homo perfectus
The Arabic philosophical fable, after 
its translation into Latin in 1671, 
under the title Philosophus autodidactus, 
and later into English, was a source of 
inspiration for many writers, including 
the English writer, Daniel Defoe, 
the author of Robinson Crusoe. Indeed, 
the Andalusian philosopher’s novel is 
the story of the survival of Hayy, a child 
abandoned on an island that has never 
known a human presence, and who is 
rescued, protected and fed by a doe. 
When the animal dies, he learns to use his 
hands, his practical and then theoretical 
intelligence, in an ontogeny (the origin 
and development of the individual 
organism, from conception to death) 
that recapitulates phylogeny (evolution 
of the species over the ages): the child 
develops into homo perfectus, the insān 
kāmil of Islamic mysticism. 
In other words, he becomes an 
accomplished human who rediscovers 
not only the essence of civilization 
(and especially fire), but also the sense of 
transcendence that leads him to the idea, 
and then to the experience of the divine. 
We find an echo of the Philosophus 
autodidactus in the philosophical debate 
about the tabula rasa, the clean slate 
that represents our ability to know 
before experience begins to record 
our knowledge on it. 
With the Ideas Section, this issue 
of the UNESCO Courier marks 
the celebrations of the World 
Day for Cultural Diversity 
for Dialogue and Development, 
21 May, and the International Day 
for Biological Diversity, 22 May.

Photograph of the Careto man, by French 
photographer Charles Fréger, taken 
during the Carnival in Lazarim, Portugal. 
It is part of the Wilder Mann series 
(2010-2011), which took Fréger across 
eighteen European countries in search 
of images of the “savage man”.
The caliph of God 
on Earth
The first shock that sets in motion the 
practical and theoretical intelligence of 
the child is the question that confronts 
him, plunging him into suffering and 
incomprehension, at the moment his 
mother, the doe, dies − what is this 
thing, life, which has left the body of the 
mother and made her forever deaf to 
her child’s calls? To answer this question, 
Thus we have underlined the continuity 
between the idea illustrated by the novel 
about Hayy and An Essay Concerning 
Human Understanding by the seventeenth-
century English philosopher John Locke.
We should note, in passing, that the 
teaching of the history of philosophy as 
it is presented in most textbooks leaves 
little room for a work as important as 
Ibn Tufayl’s, or for the intellectual tradition 
to which it belongs − this calls for another 
way of teaching the history of philosophy, 
which does not make it a purely 
European matter.
Hayy devotes himself to the practice 
of dissecting dead animals, and then 
attempts to surprise the vital principle in 
living animals by performing vivisections 
on them − not seeing, in his ignorance and 
his innocence, the cruelty of his actions. 
He abandons this research, again because 
of failure. Later, when he attains full 
awareness of self, God, Creation and his 
own place within it and responsibility for 
it, Hayy will understand his responsibility 
to be the guardian of life, in all its forms. 
He will take from nature only what is 
necessary for his sustenance, ensuring that 
the capacity for renewal of life is perfectly 
preserved, and that nature reconstitutes 
what it gives him.
Ibn Tufayl’s insistence on Hayy’s ecological 
consciousness is a philosophical illustration 
of Koranic anthropology that defines 
the human as “the caliph of God on 
Earth”. The word caliph, which means 
substitute, and the best translation for 
which is no doubt lieutenant – or more 
precisely lieu-tenant, place-holder, in 
French etymology – teaches humans 
what they have to be and defines 
their responsibility to watch over their 
environment, namely the Earth. Moreover, 
this word caliph, in spite of what we 
hear today, has in the Koran only this 
meaning, denoting the destination of 
the human. An important message from 
Ibn Tufayl’s book is, therefore, that the 
human is guardian of the Earth for itself 
and for the generations to come, because 
the human is originally the depository 
of what makes him the placeholder of God 
on Earth. Today, we need more than ever 
to heed this responsibility, without it being 
necessarily linked to a religious meaning.

To be the receptacle of what makes me 
a placeholder of God on Earth makes 
me understand that “making humanity 
together” is the opposite of depredation. 
It gives me the duty to look after life in 
general − to think that although animals, 
for instance, do not themselves formulate 
rights that must be recognized as declared, 
these are not any less real to me, because 
my humanity obligates me to them.
Making humanity 
together
I’ll sum up my point in one word: ubuntu. 
This Bantu word gained worldwide 
fame when it was used by South 
Africans Desmond Tutu and Nelson 
Mandela. It literally means “to make 
humanity together” − to create, thanks 
to other people, the human that I have 
to become, and at the same time, create 
“one humanity” with others.

In my opinion, I am not one of those 
people who go overboard in their 
efforts to bring down anthropocentrism 
– and for whom the different kingdoms 
should be self-represented in a sort of 
“natural contract” replacing the social 
contract. It is not necessary to dissolve 
humanity to forbid it to behave, as another 
seventeenth-century philosopher, 
Baruch Spinoza, wrote, “like an empire in 
an empire” − to make humans understand 
that they are not free nor separate from 
natural necessities. On the contrary, 
we must affirm our humanity, but affirm 
it as ubuntu. Ubuntu is a philosophical 
concept with universal scope and it 
seems to me that it encompasses the 
meaning and the role of the humanities 
− in particular, the philosophical 
humanities. By showing how these can 
enlighten us, I want to emphasize their 
contribution, even their “utility”. But it is not 
a matter of exaggerating what philosophy 
can do, nor of giving in to the imperative of 
the profitability of knowledge, considered 
solely from the point of view of its 
technical implementation – by insisting 
on the use to be made of it.
Instead, when it comes to the thought and 
action required by the major crises of our 
time, I want to show that we can, we must, 
rely just as much on a philosophical novel 
written in the twelfth century in Muslim 
Spain as on Western philosophical thought, 
or African words of wisdom. To meet the 
challenges of changing times, we need to 
revitalize ourselves by delving into what 
humans have thought all around the world 
and at different times.
In other words, I want to recall that 
philosophy, and the humanities in general, 
are what give meaning to an education 
aimed towards the total, complete human 
−the homo perfectus – who is able to use 
the knowledge of history to invent a future 
we must build all together.

Creolizing 
the idea of humanity
Mireille Delmas-Marty
How can we protect and 
promote the diversity 
of cultural expressions, 
while resisting relativism and 
imperialism, and reconciling 
the universalism of human rights 
with the pluralism of cultures? 
Mireille Delmas-Marty, a member 
of the Institut de France and 
a jurist specialized in the study 
of the internationalization of law, 
shares her perspective on the 
issue. She advocates “reciprocal 
creolization”, a dynamic and 
evolving process of coordinating, 
harmonizing and sometimes 
unifying, differences.
Protecting and promoting the diversity 
of cultural expressions is one of the 
priorities that UNESCO’s Member States 
have set for themselves at the dawn 
of the third millennium. By signing 
the 2005 Convention, they defined 
cultural diversity as a common heritage 
of humanity that must not only be 
protected – as an established, permanent 
treasure – but also promoted, because it is 
a living treasure, and therefore renewable 
and evolving.
Cultural diversity had already been 
elevated to the rank of common heritage 
of humanity in the Universal Declaration of 
2001, unanimously adopted by UNESCO’s 
General Conference in November of 
that year. The text affirms that cultural 
diversity is, for humankind, “as necessary 
as biodiversity is for nature”.

It was the first major intergovernmental 
meeting held just after the 11 September 
attacks in the United States, 
and UNESCO wanted to proclaim loud 
and clear its rejection of the theory 
of the clash of civilizations and its refusal 
to sanctify differences. 
Recalling this context seems to me entirely 
necessary, because since 2001, we have 
been engaged in a kind of permanent 
global civil war, which sustains genuine 
religious frenzy and terrorizes entire 
populations. This has resulted, in particular, 
to the mass exodus of populations 
that we are experiencing today, and in 
the identity tensions of the countries of 
immigration − that are closing themselves 
off on their differences, in the name 
of a supposedly threatened national 
identity. All these current events compel 
us to develop increasingly effective tools 
for cultural pluralism.

Are pluralism 
and universalism 
incompatible?
It must be recognized, however, 
that the text of the 2005 Convention 
contains an underlying contradiction, 
which is not easy to resolve, between 
pluralism − which the 2001 Declaration 
describes as giving “policy expression 
to the reality of cultural diversity” 
− and universalism, which is enshrined 
in the 1948 Universal Declaration of 
Human Rights and, more broadly, 
in human rights law.
The risk of contradiction is twofold, 
because by posing the principle of “equal 
dignity of all cultures” (Article 2 of the 2005 
Convention), cultural pluralism, if limited 
to juxtaposing differences alongside each 
other, could lead to a certain relativism 
of values  and, consequently, to a kind of 
negation of universalism.
Conversely, the universalism of human 
rights could lead to the negation of 
pluralism, if it were to force the fusion of 
all cultures and the disappearance of all 
differences. In such a case, this universalism 
would be the new garb of an imperialism 
that does not speak its name.
The drafters of the 2005 Convention saw 
this difficulty clearly. They laid down the 
fundamental rule in Article 2: “No one may 
invoke the provisions of this Convention 
in order to infringe human rights and 
fundamental freedoms as enshrined 
in the Universal Declaration of Human 
Rights or guaranteed by international law, 
or to limit the scope thereof.”
In other words, differences are only 
permitted if they are compatible with 
human rights. The difficulty is that 
the guarantee is not the same for all rights. 
For “non-derogable rights”, such as equal 
human dignity (prohibition of torture and 
other inhuman or degrading treatment), 
the protection is absolute and applies even 
in the event of war or terrorism, marking 
in principle, a common limit to the diversity 
of cultures. Other rights (privacy, religious 
freedom) are subject to restrictions, 
when the purpose is legitimate and 
the restrictions proportionate.
It is fair to say that the drafters of the 2005 
Convention set a goal, but that they did 
not provide the “user guide” to prevent 
pluralism from rhyming with relativism 
and universalism with imperialism.
As a jurist, my contribution to the 
reflection on the tools of cultural pluralism 
would be to propose, if not a set of 
instructions, at least a few ways to try 
to reconcile pluralism and universalism, 
and some means to try to bring cultures 
closer together.
We know that many conflicts are the result 
of ignorance of the Other, but we often 
forget to look for their origin in the 
ignorance of our own culture, which is a 
key factor. Opening up ways to broaden 
our knowledge of different cultures, 
including our own, is essential, I think, 
because it makes it possible for everyone 
to avoid conceiving the universal as 
an extension of their own culture. 
In other words, it is necessary to pluralize 
the universal.
But where should these paths, which open 
to the widening of our knowledge of 
different cultures, lead? My answer 
is: to the rapprochement of cultures. 
It is one step further, not just to merge 
cultures, but to make them more 
compatible with each other. I would call 
that ordering pluralism. 
Pluralizing the universal
Sensory perceptions – hearing, sight, 
smell, taste and touch – constitute the first 
tool for a true knowledge of different 
cultures. We know to what extent concerts 
or festivals, for example, contribute 
to expanding our knowledge through 
sensory perceptions.
The second tool comprises cognitive 
representations – the acquisition of 
knowledge through reason, and not 
necessarily through the senses. 
These include educational, philosophical, 
economic, sociological, ethical and 
legal discourse. For example, the role of 
libraries, cultural institutions or the People’s 
Universities of ATD Fourth World.
These are based on the convergence of 
knowledge, a notion on which I would 
like to dwell on briefly. Since 1972, 
the Fourth World People’s Universities 
have been investing in the sharing 
of knowledge between the learned 
and those who know – that is, between 
the knowledge of scholars and the 
knowledge of experience. The cooperation 
between cultural institutions is also 
based on the idea of mixing together 
several cognitive paths. In the field of 
art, we have a large number of examples 
of this kind of cross-over. For example, 
French composer Pierre Boulez who, 
in the late 1980s, shed light on the process 
of musical composition, by evoking the 
lessons of the Swiss artist Paul Klee of 
the Bauhaus School of Design in Weimar, 
Germany (from 1921 to 1931).

The combination of the sensory and 
the rational – and we know that these 
two capacities are linked – is undoubtedly 
the one that opens the widest perspectives 
for our knowledge of different cultures. 
Today, this combination is facilitated by 
new technologies, as admirably illustrated 
by the Museum of World Culture in 
Gothenburg, Sweden, inaugurated in 2004, 
or the Mucem (Musée des Civilisations de 
l’Europe et de la Méditerranée) in Marseille, 
France, established in 2013.
Whichever path we take – sensory, 
cognitive or combined – we have 
several ways to order pluralism, 
without suppressing it.
Going beyond fixed 
metaphors
To avoid both the relativism and 
imperialism of values, an interactive 
and adaptable dynamic is necessary. 
The rapprochement of cultures must be 
understood as a process, a movement 
that encourages us to go beyond 
the fixed metaphors – human rights 
seen as the foundations, pedestals, 
pillars or roots of various cultures 
– and give preference to the metaphor 
that presents human rights as the common 
language of humanity. It suggests three 
processes, the dynamic effect of which 
is growing: from intercultural exchange 
(dialogue) to the search for equivalences 
(translation), and even to reciprocal 
transformation (creolization).
Dialogue, or intercultural exchange, 
improves the understanding and 
knowledge of the Other and thus facilitates 
rapprochement, but does not guarantee it. 
As an example, I summarize here the judges’ 
dialogue on the death penalty, triggered 
in 1989 by a bold interpretation of the 
European Court of Human Rights (ECHR). 
The court had ruled that the extradition 
to the United States, of a man facing a 
death sentence violated the prohibition 
of inhuman or degrading treatment or 
punishment. By its potential applications to 
various third countries, this case law would 
have an influence throughout the world. 
It seems to have favoured a turnaround 
in 2001 by the Supreme Court of Canada, 
which is largely based on the decision of 
the ECHR. It was also used by the Supreme 
Court of Appeal of South Africa in 1995, 
to support the judgement on the death 
penalty as contrary to the prohibition of 
cruel, inhuman or degrading treatment.

But dialogue remains subject to 
the goodwill of the actors and, 
in this sense, its contribution to 
the rapprochement of cultures is limited 
to coordinating differences.
The second way, which goes further 
in the recognition of common values,  
is translation. A true “miracle”, according 
to French philosopher Paul Ricœur 
(1913-2005), it “creates a resemblance 
where there seemed to be only 
plurality”. I would add that translation is 
“miraculous” in that it respects differences, 
while seeking equivalences that can 
make these differences compatible. 
Translation is a means of harmonizing 
differences, an approach that contributes 
to rapprochement on the principle of 
musical harmony, as defined by Plato in 
The Symposium: “From contrary elements, 
such as sharps and flats, the art of music, 
by making them agree with each other, 
produces harmony.”
That said, we often encounter 
untranslatable concepts, and the 
misunderstandings they cause. 
For example, in Article 1 of the Universal 
Declaration of Human Rights, we read that 
“all men are endowed by nature with reason 
and conscience”. Initially, only “reason” was 
mentioned. But one of the drafters of the 
Declaration, Zhang Pengchun of China, 
remarked that if the declaration was to 
be universal, the notion of reason alone 
was not enough. He proposed adding the 
Chinese term liangxin, which translated 
to conscience. In reality, the equivalence 
between liangxin and conscience is weak, 
because the Chinese term, derived from 
the characters lian and gxin, evokes moral 
conscience in the Confucian sense, that is, 
a conscience that favours otherness.
To solve this type of difficulty, we would 
need to go even further, by implementing 
the third means mentioned above: 
hybridization or, to avoid possible 
misunderstandings, creolization. 
I use the word creolization in the way it was 
used by the French poet Edouard Glissant 
(1928-2011), when he suggested opening 
up our particular poetics, one with the 
other. In other words, creolization makes it 
possible to unify differences by integrating 
them into a common definition.
In his book, La Cohée du Lamentin (2004), 
Edouard Glissant wrote: “Creolization is 
not a simple mechanism of inter-breeding. 
It is a mixture that produces something 
unexpected.” To produce the unexpected 
is to find − beyond dialogue and 
translation, but thanks to them − a new, 
truly common meaning. It is a way 
of overcoming differences.

Errance, 2012, by Haitian artist 
Sergine André
A shift from the poetic to the legal realm 
will allow me to examine the example 
of a concept with a universal vocation, 
the legal significance of which is evolving: 
crime against humanity.
Towards a mutual 
transformation 
The notion of crime against humanity has 
a collective dimension – “a widespread or 
systematic attack on a civilian population” 
– and implies the depersonalization of 
the victim. First used in the charter of the 
International Military Tribunal at Nuremberg 
in 1945, this concept is implicitly part of the 
Western perception of humanity, which is 
based on the idea that each human being 
is an individual, and equally, a member 
of the human community.
But the concept has gradually been 
extended to the destruction of 
cultural property. In 2001, the judges 
of the International Criminal Tribunal 
for the former Yugoslavia (ICTY) 
ruled that when the destruction and 
degradation of buildings dedicated to 
religion or education is perpetrated 
with discriminatory intent, it amounts to 
“an attack on the very religious identity 
of a people. 
As such, it almost exemplifies the notion 
of crime against humanity, because 
in fact it is humanity as a whole that is 
affected by the destruction of a specific 
religious culture and cultural objects that 
are attached to it.” [ICTY, Prosecutor v. 
Dario Kordic and Mario Cerkez, IT-95-14/2, 
Judgement, February 26, 2001].
The question also comes up regarding 
Iraq. “The destruction of objects tracing 
the history of a people is an eloquent 
way of uprooting them, depriving them 
of their origins and destroying them 
in their soul,” says French-Iranian jurist 
Pejman Pourzand (Radio Notre Dame, 
6 March 2015]. Other commentators have 
referred to this kind of destruction as 
a “crime against the history of humanity”.
To ensure genuine creolization through 
a reciprocal transformation, it would 
be necessary to integrate cultures 
that value the links between individuals 
of the same national community 
− as suggested by the Zulu word 
ubuntu (which, roughly translated, 
means common humanity) from South 
Africa, the Japanese term uchi-soto 
(the distinction between group members 
and others), or the previously-mentioned 
Confucian term, liangxin (conscience).
It would also be necessary to associate 
the cultures that impose duties on 
humans towards nature, like those that 
protect Pachamama (Mother Earth), 
for example, inscribed in the constitutions 
of Ecuador and Bolivia. This is perhaps 
how we should understand the proposal 
that is currently being circulated, 
to extend the notion of crime against 
humanity and genocide to ecocide 
–  that is, the irreversible and serious 
damage being caused to the equilibrium 
of the ecosystem.
In order to endow the notion of crimes 
against humanity with a truly universal 
vocation, other traditions should enrich 
the Western vision of humanity itself.
The rapprochement of cultures, 
the theme of the ongoing International 
Decade (2013-2022), involves many 
paths that make it possible to resist 
both relativism and imperialism, 
and to reconcile the universalism 
of human rights with the pluralism 
of cultures. These are the paths that lead 
to reciprocal humanization.

A missive for
youth
Abdourahman A. Waberi
“An old African teacher used 
to say: There is my truth and 
your truth, but the truth is in 
the middle. To get close to it, 
everyone must move slightly 
out of their truth to take a step 
towards the other.” This is one 
of the lessons that Amadou 
Hampâté Bâ wanted to transmit 
to young people on his continent 
and elsewhere, in a letter written 
in the 1980s. Today, this letter 
takes on a prophetic quality.

From one end of the Sahara to the other, 
a large segment of African youth have 
experienced only precarious lives. 
Destitute  and disoriented, these young 
people throw themselves body and soul 
into a hazardous adventure. For them, 
to face the desert, the smugglers, 
the barbed wire, the waves of the 
Mediterranean, seems more bearable 
than the feeling of falling by the wayside, 
rotting on the vine. What else can they do? 
Move, flee, opt for migration and perish 
in the sea if they must. When questioned, 
the shipwreck survivors emphasize 
the lack of means of subsistence. 
Crossing the Sahara to be sold as a slave 
in Libya or joining the Boko Haram 
is neither an option nor a life plan.
Growing up in slums, these youth did 
not have the opportunity to appreciate 
the legacy of elders who were generous 
with advice and other lessons of life. 
Among them, is an emblematic figure for 
the entire African continent – the Malian, 
Amadou Hampâté Bâ (1901-1991), the man 
to whom is attributed the now-famous 
dictum: “In Africa, when an old man dies, 
a library burns down.”
What he really said was: “I consider 
the death of each of these traditionalists 
as the burning of an unexploited 
cultural fund.” It was 1 December 1960, 
and Hampâté Bâ was then the head 
of Mali’s delegation at the UNESCO 
General Conference.

Whether they like it or not, all humankind is 
sailing on the same raft: when a hurricane 
rises, everyone will be threatened at 
the same time. Is it not better to try to 
understand and to help each other before 
it is too late?”
The wise man of Bandiagara then 
encourages these young people 
– growing up and developing in a bipolar 
world where interest groups clash and 
tear each other apart – to “gradually 
produce a new mindset, more oriented 
towards complementarity and solidarity, 
both individual and international.” 
Because we cannot stress often enough 
that “in our times, so fraught with threats 
of all kinds, people must emphasize not 
what separates them, but what they 
have in common, with respect for the 
identity of each. Meeting and listening 
to the other is always more enriching, 
even for the blossoming of one’s own 
identity, than conflicts or sterile discussions 
to impose one’s own point of view.”
Macho Nne / Caribbean Peacock, 2014, 
from the C-Stunners series by Kenyan 
artist Cyrus Kabiru. 
Mali had just joined the Organization as 
an independent country. In his speech, 
he pleaded for the “gigantic oral 
monument to be saved from destruction 
by the deaths of traditionalists who are 
its only repositories [and who] are, alas, 
in the decline of their days.”
I used to say to myself that as a teenager, 
I would have liked to have had Hampâté 
Bâ as my grandfather. Honesty forces 
me to recognize that I probably would not 
have had the ears to listen to his advice. 
The old boubous, the hoary heads 
and their traditional values did not attract 
me. I condemned in advance, this world 
that seemed to me passive and obsolete. 
I rejected its rules on principle. 
I  was terribly wrong.
If today’s world, in Africa and elsewhere, 
desperately needs tutelary figures like 
the author of The Strange Destiny of 
Wangrin, it is because the rupture between 
the generations seems to be complete. 
The family circle has shrunk considerably. 
Worse, it is no longer the solid foundation 
of awakening and transmission that 
it was yesterday.
“My dear young 
people…”
Six years before his death in 1991, 
Hampâté Bâ wrote a letter dedicated to 
youth that reads like a testament. “The man 
who speaks to you is one of the first-born 
of the twentieth century,” he says. He then 
issues an alert: “Young people, last-born 
of the twentieth century, you live in a time 
which is at once terrifying, for the threats 
it imposes on humanity, and enthralling, 
for the possibilities it opens up in the field 
of knowledge and communication 
between people. 
Just as the beauty of a carpet is the variety 
of its colours, the diversity of people, 
cultures and civilizations makes up 
the beauty and wealth of the world. 
How boring and monotonous would 
be a uniform world where all humans, 
fashioned according to the same model, 
thought and lived in the same way! 
Having nothing more to discover in others, 
how would one enrich oneself?

The generations of the twenty-first century 
will experience a fantastic encounter of 
races and ideas. Depending on how they 
assimilate this phenomenon, they will 
ensure its survival or cause their destruction 
by deadly conflicts. In this modern world, 
none can take refuge any longer in their 
ivory towers. All states, whether strong or 
weak, rich or poor, are now interdependent, 
if only economically or in the face of the 
dangers of global war.

Whether individuals, nations, races 
or cultures, we are all different from each 
other; but we all have something similar 
too, and that is what we must look for, 
in order to be able to recognize ourselves 
in the other and to converse with him. 
Then our differences, instead of separating 
us, will become complementary 
and a source of mutual enrichment
Eloquent and precise, the writer uses 
striking images to make his point: 
“Human life is like a big tree and every 
generation is like a gardener. The good 
gardener is not the one who uproots, 
but the one who, when the time comes, 
knows how to prune the dead branches 
and, if necessary, proceed judiciously with 
beneficial grafts. To cut the trunk would 
be to commit suicide, to renounce one’s 
own personality and to assume artificially 
that of others, without ever completely 
succeeding. Again, let’s remember the old 
saying: The log has spent a lot of time 
in the water, it may float, but it will never 
become a crocodile!” 
“Young people, be this good gardener,” 
Hampâté Bâ exhorts. “Then, well-rooted 
in yourselves, you will be able to open 
to the outside, without fear and without 
harm, both to give and to receive.”

 The land was not the property of humans, 
but a sacred trust entrusted to them by 
the Creator and of which they were only 
the managers.”  
In the era of the Anthropocene – the result 
of the divorce between humankind and 
nature – this lesson of our ancestors invites 
us to seriously question the way of life 
that we have adopted, which is destructive 
of both traditions and the environment.
Open-mindedness, diversity, dialogue 
and mutual understanding –these are 
the four pillars that bear the message 
of this precious letter from Hampâté 
Bâ. The time has come to put it in the 
hands of everyone, young and old, 
in Africa and elsewhere. 
Storyteller, writer, poet, ethnologist, 
spiritual leader, numerologist, diplomat, 
Hampâté Bâ defined himself as “a graduate 
of the great university of the Word, 
taught in the shadow of baobabs”. 
Having taken some unusual paths to reach 
the higher spheres of knowledge, he made 
it his mission to pass on the baton to us 
– regardless of our beliefs, our skin colour 
or our age.

When I was 15 or 16, my father gave 
me a book about the fashion house of 
Chanel. I discovered French haute couture, 
and realized that there is a grammar in 
fashion that I wanted to study. I had received 
different awards for art between the ages 
of 6 and 12, but I did not want to study 
art. I wanted to do something different. 
I wanted to go to London. Over six months, 
the London College of Fashion refused 
my application, but they finally accepted 
me, with many conditions attached.
Bibi Russell: 
Finding magic 
in fingers
Interview by Krista Pikkat (UNESCO) and Jasmina Šopova 
Here, she teaches and motivates the girls, 
some of whom are victims of child 
trafficking, to develop income-generating 
skills. “I can’t believe that in the twenty-first 
century, when everyone is talking about 
women’s empowerment and equal rights, 
we are still selling our girls!” she says, 
pointing out that destitute girls in the state 
are sold for less than $100. “If I have the 
strength to finish this difficult work, I hope 
it will open doors for these girls to start 
a new life filled with dignity and love.”
Russell’s efforts are paying off. On 7 March 
2018, thirty-three girls from the shelter, 
including six Rohingya refugee kids, 
walked the ramp at a fashion show 
organized by the government in Kolkata 
and conceived by Russell. They were 
wearing clothes designed by their friends 
at the Home, who have been trained 
by Bangladesh’s best-known designer.
Since the late 1990s, Russell has been 
working to develop traditional textiles 
and handicrafts, giving a chance 
to thousands of people to rise out of 
poverty thanks to their “magic fingers”, 
as she puts it.
Fashion design was your true passion and 
vocation, though you first became famous 
as a top model. How did a young girl from 
Bangladesh decide to go to a fashion school 
in London? 
At home, my mother used to sew clothes for 
us. My sisters never complained, but I was 
never quite happy with the clothes. 
So when I was 10 years old, my father 
bought me a sewing machine. You can 
barely hold a pair of scissors properly when 
you’re 10, but I started experimenting.
UNESCO’s Artist for Peace and 
well-known designer Bibi Russell has 
achieved a tour de force: thanks to her, 
the humble gamuchas – traditional 
cotton towels that people in South 
Asia generally use to wipe their hands 
and faces – rival the most prestigious 
pieces on fashion podiums all over the 
world. But her real success is away from 
these podiums, in hundreds of weaving 
workshops in her country, Bangladesh, 
but also in Uzbekistan, Colombia, India.
In December 2017, she took part in India’s 
Rajasthan Heritage Week, showcasing 
her khadi collection. The show was 
her tribute to Mahatma Gandhi and to 
the traditional Rajasthani weavers who 
created the homespun cloth.
Russell also participated in 
the Commonwealth Fashion Exchange 
in February 2018, with an exhibition 
showcasing sustainable fashion 
from the Commonwealth countries. 
It was launched at Buckingham Palace 
with the support of the Queen and 
the Duchess of Cambridge. 
The designer with a difference is now 
working on what she calls “a difficult 
and emotionally very engaging project”. 
With the direct support of Mamata 
Banerjee, Chief Minister of West Bengal, 
she has been working at the Liluah 
Home, the state’s largest shelter for girls, 
since September 2017. 
With this interview, The UNESCO Courier 
marks the celebration of the World 
Day for Cultural Diversity for Dialogue 
and Development, 21 May.

Bibi Russell with craftspeople 
in Rajasthan, India. 
I think parents must teach their children 
more about their culture and traditions 
so that these traditions do not die.
When you returned to Bangladesh, 
you started a small tailor’s workshop, 
which grew into Bibi Productions in 1995. 
Most traditional weavers live in villages. 
Why did you decide to base your company 
in Dhaka, the capital?
I only have one office located in Dhaka. 
I need an office from which we can 
connect to the rest of the world. 
But I spend 99.9 per cent of my time in 
villages. We work with craftsmen from 
different parts of Bangladesh. They are 
not from privileged families, and each 
one of them – starting from the person 
who makes tea in my office – feels that 
Bibi Productions is theirs.
I have done this for the people of 
Bangladesh, and Bibi Productions belongs 
to the country.
How would you define the philosophy 
behind Bibi Productions?
We cannot say that Bibi Productions is 
not-for-profit, but we make very little 
profit. Our focus is on saving and reviving 
the crafts and supporting the craftspeople, 
and on raising their awareness about the 
importance of education and health.
I see the difference since I started 
Bibi Productions in 1994. All the 
people working either in the office 
or in the villages have no more than 
two or three children. They know how 
to better manage the money they 
make, and their standard of living has 
improved. Having come out of poverty, 
they understand the importance 
of their children going to school. 
Education and health is the backbone of 
any economy in any country.
How many people does 
Bibi Productions employ?
We have some thirty people from 
different corners of Bangladesh working 
in the office. There are people who first 
thought they would not have the skills 
and knowledge to work in the office. 
But I am able to recognize people with 
a positive attitude.
In addition, we work with thousands 
of craftspeople. I cannot say their exact 
number, but they are around 100,000. 
You think that’s huge? It is not even one 
per cent of the weavers in the country! 
I wish that I could feel that I have reached 
the first step of the ladder before I die 
– there is so much more to be done. 
In countries like India, Bangladesh, 
Central Asia, agriculture is the most 
important sector of the economy. 
People working in agriculture and 
handicrafts live side by side. I work 
with people who do things by hand: 
Fashion for Development is what I am.
How did the idea of Fashion 
for Development start?
It started when I held my first show at 
UNESCO, in 1996. Designers are very 
rarely given recognition by United 
Nations agencies, but the Organization 
recognized the link between fashion and 
development, education and health. 
UNESCO’s “Weavers of Bangladesh” show 
was covered by twenty-nine television 
channels around the world. It was 
supported by Federico Mayor, the then 
Director-General of UNESCO, and Queen 
Sofía of Spain. If the media made me Bibi 
the model, these two people, who believed 
in me from the start, gave me priceless 
support in my career as a designer. I also 
received a lot of international support. 
Since then, I have been invited to top 
universities in the world, which now work 
on fashion for development, and to the 
World Economic Forum (WEF), because 
they realize the importance of the creative 
economy and the social economy.
After twenty years in the West, where you 
built a successful career as a top model, 
you returned to Bangladesh in 1994. 
What made you do that?
Since I was young, I had a dream. I could 
not understand why Bangladeshi 
people were thought of as poor. For me, 
the country was rich with colours and 
music! When I went to Europe, my dream 
went with me. One day I knew that I was 
mentally and physically ready to go 
back home.
I believed that the people of Bangladesh 
needed me as much as I needed 
them. You need two hands to clap. 
Today, after more than twenty years of 
experience, I know I was right. They know 
I respect them and help them restore their 
human dignity. That is the most important 
thing. On the other hand, they give me 
so much love and affection! This gives me 
the strength to go forward. Nothing in the 
world can take me away from this work.
I have never turned my back on 
my country. My parents always lived in 
Bangladesh, so I returned home regularly 
even when I lived abroad. I was born in 
Bangladesh and spent my childhood there. 
I think childhood has a major impact on 
your life.
I have a wonderful family. My parents 
taught me to appreciate our culture as 
well as the culture of other countries. 
Bangladesh used to be a part of India, 
which was governed by the British and 
the Mughals. Thanks to the education 
my parents gave me, I learned all about 
Greater India and about the culture of 
other countries as well.

Our guest
The UNESCO Courier  April-June 2018   |   53 
In 1999, UNESCO designated you as a 
Designer for Development. Then, in 2001, 
you were made an Artist for Peace. What do 
UNESCO’s recognitions mean to you?
What I am today is thanks to UNESCO. 
But also, thanks to my work, people realize 
that Bangladesh does not only have 
problems, it is also a wonderful country.
When I was designated Designer for 
Development, I returned home and 
showed the certificate to the weavers. I told 
them that the honour was for them, not 
just for me. You can change people’s minds 
when you respect their human dignity.
Any recognition gives you strength. I am 
a fellow of the University of the Arts, 
London. This recognition is given to 
me for the contribution I have made to 
promoting handloom. I have received 
the highest award from the Bangla 
Academy, Bangladesh’s national language 
authority, established in 1955 on the 
model of the French Academy. And the 
biggest designers in the world have also 
recognized the work I do for development. 
The international recognition helps me 
a lot in my work of promoting Fashion 
for Development.
What defines your work as a fashion 
designer?
Everything we do at Bibi Productions 
is natural and handmade. I have never 
used synthetic fabrics or artificial colours. 
I don’t expect people to wear natural and 
handmade all the time, but even if you 
have four or five outfits, wear them every 
now and then!
My models are inspired by traditional 
design. Of course I change colours, 
I simplify the design, but I never change 
the traditional way of weaving cotton 
or silk. 
Among my biggest sellers are 
my accessories and scarves. My bangles 
are made out of water hyacinth, a plant 
that grows widely in Bangladesh. I now 
have women in six villages making these 
bangles. And my gamuchas are promoted 
by the Spanish actor, Antonio Banderas, 
so I do not need to spend money on 
publicity. I would never do that anyway 
– Bibi Productions is a self-funded project, 
and hundreds of people depend on me 
for their livelihoods.
How has your work evolved?
When I started working in Cambodia, 
I began recycling and today, I have become 
an expert at recycling! In Bangladesh, 
I make things out of what people 
throw away.
I was also inspired by the “rickshaw 
art” in Bangladesh to make spectacle 
frames that I personally wear very often.
But the real “revolution” was brought 
about with our design for young people. 
We do jeans in different colours, saris in 
a different way, modern blouses, etc.
How do you balance your family life 
with your professional activities?
I know married life, I have two children. 
When my kids were around 9 or 10, 
I had to make them realize that I have 
a dream, and that if I do not pursue it, 
I would be frustrated. Today, my parents 
have both passed away, my children live 
abroad, but the craftspeople I work with 
never allow me to feel alone. These are 
ordinary people, who need their wages on 
the first day of the month to pay the rent. 
They are not my family, but they mean 
more than anything to me.  
Since I returned to Bangladesh, I started 
to support street children. I gave them 
some money on the condition they went 
to school. I became their guarantor for 
NGO (non-governmental organization) 
schools, where street children are not 
usually accepted. It was first one child, 
then another – now they are more than 
a hundred! They are my source of joy 
when I am in Dhaka.
Bibi Russell pays tribute to 
the craftswomen of Barmer, Rajasthan, 
whose work was presented at a fashion 
show to celebrate Rajasthan Day 
in the Indian state, March 2017.

These include cultural institutions, 
museums, civil-society groups, startups, 
non-governmental organizations (NGOs), 
embassies and international organizations. 
Not surprisingly, about 150 libraries across 
Greece will implement several special 
programmes within the summer reading 
campaign, led by the National Library 
of Greece. 
Municipal programmes and organizations 
will also participate in the year’s activities 
– including the City’s Athens Culture 
Net and Open Schools, both funded by 
the Stavros Niarchos Foundation; 
Technopolis, the industrial museum and 
cultural complex; OPANDA, the Youth, 
Culture and Sports Organization, 
the civil-society platform SynAthina 
and refugee programmes.
One million visitors 
expected
The programme features a vivid patchwork 
of over 250 events and activities, 
all revolving around the world of books, 
learning and knowledge. With a million 
visitors expected, the city aspires 
to provide a literary backdrop to cater 
to all tastes and ages. 
Besides spreading a love for books 
and learning, it hopes to foster open 
dialogue − not only for the creators, 
stakeholders and the intellectual elite, 
but most importantly, for all its citizens. 
Books and reading are melded with art 
and  creativity, focusing on learning, 
but also exhibiting that books can bring 
joy and pleasure to readers. 
At a time when the country is going 
through financial hardships and the book 
industry is facing a crisis, financing 
the event has had its challenges. Even so, 
the City of Athens has allocated a budget 
of €500,000 for communications to 
support the event, and contribute to 
the book activities of OPANDA. Donations 
from institutions, sponsors, and embassies 
that will directly support the programme 
amounted to another €500,000 (at the end 
of February 2018) and was expected to 
increase. What surprised and motivated us 
was the interest and willingness of most 
participants to commit and undertake 
actions, using their own means to be a part 
of this very special event for the city.

Athens, the Greek capital, 
kicks off a year-long 
celebration of reading, 
culture and knowledge as 
UNESCO’s World Book Capital 
2018, starting 23 April. 
“Books everywhere” is the motto 
this year, which means books 
and a feast of related activities 
are open to everyone, to be 
encountered and savoured in 
every corner of this historic city.

Book lovers in Athens and those visiting 
it, are in for a treat. Proud of having been 
named World Book Capital for 2018, 
the ancient capital kicks off its global 
cultural event to celebrate books in myriad 
ways, in April 2018.
In preparation for the event, the City of 
Athens has worked hard to translate the 
vision of the Mayor of Athens, Georgios 
Kaminis, into reality. The aim of the mayor 
− and his team of seven people working on 
the event − has been to involve citizens of 
various social, ethnic and age groups and 
to diffuse the book and reading culture 
throughout all of Athens’ neighbourhoods 
via smaller, localized activities. This is 
expected to increase the self-esteem of the 
people and contribute to social integration 
and coherence. Additionally, the city’s 
creative forces would be merged with a 
common cultural goal: to leave a solid 
legacy, in terms of physical evidence and 
in the mindset of its citizens, encouraging 
them to love and read books, long after 
the year has gone by. 
To make this possible, the City has joined 
hands with over 150 institutions where 
learning takes place, and with writers 
and the publishing industry.

Today, young Africans know very little 
about our traditional heritage, and would 
rather spend their time discovering 
Hollywood films, or playing games on the 
internet. Instead of passing down our own 
culture to our children and grandchildren, 
and having them create their own art 
based on that culture, they are paying for 
foreign entertainment. 
We Live in Silence VIII, 
by the Zimbabwean artist and plastician, 
Kudzanai Chiurai, 2017.
The outcome is that our youth is 
disconnected from both our traditions 
and the work of contemporary African 
authors and thinkers.
Yet, our youth is as talented anywhere 
else in the world. I have witnessed 
young girls and boys produce the most 
beautiful music with the most rudimentary 
instruments, or making some of the 
best short films using their smartphones 
– all without any formal training. 
Filling 
the cultural vacuum
Lucy Mushita
Southern Africa’s youth are as 
talented as young people anywhere 
else. But with disappearing local 
traditions, and the lack of avenues to 
channel their creativity, they live in 
a cultural vacuum. Consuming content 
that is bombarded on the internet 
is not enough – these young people 
need to be given access to the right 
tools and opportunities, and to be 
guided and encouraged to craft 
their own stories. 
The African continent is overflowing 
with talent: musicians, writers, poets, 
philosophers, dancers and other artists. 
These artists and their creative work are 
the conduits through which cultures 
pass from one generation to the next. 
But many of them have lived in exile: 
Kenyan writer Ngugi wa Thiong’o, Nigerian 
playwright Wole Soyinka, Congolese 
novelist and chemist Emmanuel Dongala, 
French-Congolese author Alain Mabanckou 
and Zimbabwean musician Thomas 
Mapfumo. The list goes on. Some exiled 
Africans are teaching at prestigious 
universities abroad where their real value is 
appreciated – while students in their home 
countries are deprived of their wisdom.
At the same time, traditional oral literature 
is disappearing from our cultural scene. 
When I was young – I grew up in a small 
village during apartheid in Southern 
Rhodesia (now Zimbabwe) – my identity 
and cultural needs were nourished 
through this literature that elders conveyed 
through stories recounted in the evenings. 
Involving acting and singing and dancing 
in the community, these “lessons” 
complemented the formal education 
we received.
It was in school that I read the classics by 
numerous icons of English, French and 
American literature. These books did not 
reflect our reality, and were devoid of 
thoughts that might have given us any ideas 
of equality with Whites. But regardless of 
the censorship, reading opened up a whole 
new world for me – introducing me to 
other cultures and to philosophical thinking 
and reasoning, which led to questioning 
the status quo.

Young people would greatly benefit from 
e-resources in forms of downloadable 
books. The same applies to visual artists, 
whose work needs galleries to exhibit 
their genius. It is also essential to develop 
policies governing intellectual property 
to protect their work. 
Lack of funds?
How can Southern Africa shape public 
policy to fill this cultural vacuum with 
relevant content? How can African youth 
learn to reflect before regurgitating 
whatever comes their way? How can 
the region reject that which is toxic and 
incorporate that which is untainted, 
into their own creative work? 
The common argument about a lack 
of funds may be valid in many cases. 
But it is interesting to note that nearly 
every Southern African country spends 
millions on football stadiums and on the 
inflated salaries of footballers. It is true 
that sport must be promoted and that 
football stadiums are generally profitable. 
One solution could be to create a strategy 
in which sports and culture were merged. 
Revenue from stadiums, for example, 
could be channelled to fund libraries, 
cinemas, theatres, music centres. 
Another frequent political argument is 
that any investment should create jobs. 
Take the example of Hollywood, which 
employs thousands, if not millions, 
directly or indirectly – economically 
benefiting the United States, besides 
allowing it to use its soft power. 
Now that technology is available to us, 
we too are in a position to craft our own 
stories – through literature, cinema, 
and art. 
Homegrown success
Being creative doesn’t have to be 
prohibitively expensive. In 2016, the Italian 
publisher 66thand2nd, published La felicità 
degli uomini semplici (The happiness 
of simple men), a book of short stories 
on soccer in Africa, by African writers. 
In Italian and at €18 a copy, not many 
Africans can afford it. 
By contrast, Neria, the homegrown 1993 
arthouse film scripted by Zimbabwean 
author and filmmaker Tsitsi Dangarembga 
and directed by fellow-Zimbabwean 
Godwin Mawuru – which explores gender 
issues – was more accessible and remains 
the highest-grossing film in Zimbabwe’s 
history. 
While it was nearly impossible for someone 
of my generation to write their own stories 
while growing up, today’s African youth 
have both the possibility and the tools at 
their disposal to do so. Women writers and 
philosophers – like Ken Bugul (Senegal), 
Kidi Bebey (France-Cameroon), Nadia Yala 
Kisukidi (born in Belgium, of a Congolese 
father and a French-Italian mother), 
Virginia Phiri (Zimbabwe), Chimamanda 
Ngozi Adichie (Nigeria) – are all writing 
their stories, and Africa needs to listen to 
and engage with them. Most world-views 
of Africa continue to be tainted by colonial 
points of view – African voices, if provided 
the right platforms, could change that. 
Lucy Mushita (Zimbabwe) is a novelist 
and essayist. Born in Southern Rhodesia, 
she grew up in a small village during 
apartheid. Her novel Chinongwa 
(published in South Africa in 2008, 
and in France in 2012) explores this period 
of her life, before she left her country 
in 1986, for France, the United States 
and Australia – eventually making Paris 
her home.
With this article, the Courier marks 
the celebration of UNESCO’s Africa Week 
in the month of May.

Decolonizing politics
These new African icons are disconcerting 
– as much because of what they say and 
the way they say it, as by the way they 
dress, which breaks with the traditional 
suit-and-tie of politicians. The decolonial 
dimension of their projects represent a 
real challenge to the political classes and 
even the general public, largely because of 
their horizontal (rather than hierarchical) 
reach, combining real political action with 
a social stance. 
Young people are getting politically 
involved in new ways – creating startups, 
using digital forms of activism and forming 
citizens’ groups. Yet none of these initiatives 
can replace politics, which is the only way 
to change the course of a country’s history, 
to halt the perpetuation of inequalities, 
and to restore a sense of dignity to millions 
of people. Much needs to be done urgently 
in Africa, but, above all, there is a need 
to foster the emergence of a new kind of 
dialogue among youth – using with other 
methods and other players if necessary, 
and with the ultimate aim of seizing 
power democratically. 
One alternative is gradually taking 
shape and deserves careful attention. 
New political youth movements are 
appearing, springing up from urban 
cultures and suburban neighbourhoods. 
Examples include Y’en a Marre (“We’ve had 
enough”), a group of rappers in Senegal, 
Le Balai Citoyen (the People’s broom), 
in Burkina Faso and Filimbi and LUCHA 
(Lutte pour le Changement, or Struggle 
for Change) in the Democratic Republic 
of the Congo (DRC). 
These civil society movements are a breath 
of fresh air compared to the drab and 
essentially interchangeable political classes. 
The message of these new elites breaks 
with classical political-speak – it is raw, 
direct and delivered in a language that 
can be understood by those to whom it 
is addressed, which explains its success. 
So, when Y’en a Marre campaigned 
to get people to register to vote in 
2011, the turnout at the elections was 
unprecedented. It was the same for 
the symbolic street-cleaning operation 
in Ouagadougou, after the popular 
uprising of October 2014 against a 
proposed amendment to the Constitution, 
which would have allowed Burkina Faso’s 
former president, Blaise Compaoré, 
who had been in power since 1987, 
to stand again in the presidential elections. 
Young Africans:
reinventing politics
Hamidou Anne
Many young people in Africa 
are taking a stand against 
the current politics in their 
countries. As civil-society 
campaigners who are active 
on social media networks, 
they are challenging the 
established authorities – using 
rap and graffiti, and bringing 
traditional cultural codes up 
to date. Supporters of direct 
democracy, they are preparing 
the way for a society that is less 
hierarchical and ‘decolonized’, 
at last.
The African political classes have failed in 
their mission to build nations characterized 
by justice and progress, in spite of a 
number of significant and very welcome 
advances. Adding the non-existence of 
credible alternatives among the opposition 
parties, we are forced to admit that politics 
in general have reached a low point. 
This impasse is leading large numbers of 
young people en masse to adopt a stance 
of defiance – which could be summed up 
by the phrase: “they’re all the same”.

strategies, offers a model for how a 
political organizational structure in Africa 
might work.
These groups have proven their 
effectiveness. In Senegal, during the 
mobilization of 23 June 2011, and in spite 
of police repression and surveillance 
by intelligence agencies, Y’en a Marre 
triggered a massive movement. 
This helped to torpedo amendments to 
the Constitution by parliament that would 
have allowed the re-election of Abdoulaye 
Wade – and probably ensuring that his son 
took over when he stood down.
Young Africans:
reinventing politics
Crowds cheering the caravan of 
Balai Citoyen, during the demonstration 
against the constitutional revision 
project in Ouagadougou, Burkina Faso, 
October 2014.
These youth movements are deeply 
political, even if they unconsciously or 
tactically hide behind a ‘social’ label. 
They also show no desire to participate 
directly in elections.
These movements are all attempts to 
decolonize politics. They aim to return 
politics to the people – into the hands 
of citizens who have hitherto been 
excluded from the democratic process 
and consulted only to add their stamp of 
approval by voting. Interestingly, the way 
these groups are organized is a form of 
direct democracy. Through a network of 
local branches, Le Balai Citoyen enables 
people across the nation to take part in 
decision-making. With a slightly more 
limited horizontal dimension – because of 
the notoriety and massive popularity of its 
leaders – Y’en a Marre also allows everyone 
to join in the process of consultation. 
This kind of transversal connection does 
not exist in conventional politics. 
Art at the service 
of politics
By using music, dance, graffiti and 
references borrowed from street poetry, 
these movements are succeeding in 
bringing together young people who 
understand the language and codes of 
their neighbourhoods. On the streets and 
via the internet, they are calling for an 
alternative dialogue and for projects that 
give wings to their dreams. These new 
players in African politics are employing 
a range of cultural references to support 
their actions. Rap music, for instance, 
has been a powerful vector for getting 
the message of opposition across. 
Other statements include using national 
languages (Wolof by Y’en a Marre and 
Moré by Le Balai Citoyen) or wearing 
an Amílcar Cabral hat (named after 
the emblematic leader of the struggle 
against the Portuguese colonization 
of Guinea-Bissau). 
As beacons of hope, the responsibility of 
these movements is great. They represent 
political forces that are uninhibited, free, 
and unencumbered by colonial burdens. 
It is thanks to them that the continent 
no longer conjures up only images of 
pity, generated by poverty, famine, 
AIDS and war. We are on the threshold 
of a radically emancipating project. 
Much like the anti-austerity Indignados 
movement in Spain, which gave rise to 
the far-left Podemos political party in 
2014, these groups will sooner or later be 
called upon to stand in general elections. 
We could then witness a decolonial 
turning point vis-à-vis Western countries 
– with the possibility of societies founded 
on our own social and cultural realities.

“I go out by boat six hours a day, quite 
aways – from one side of the lake to 
the other, depending on the weather. 
I see nothing but an endless flat land... 
that’s where my ancestors were. I keep 
warning my sons: “Just look at the land and 
it will tell you the story it has to tell you. 
You don’t want hear it? Yet you can say it by 
heart.” Who is this man who asks his sons to 
listen to the voice of their land and chooses 
to cross a frozen area of over 30,000 square 
kilometres? His name is Raymond Tutcho. 
He lives close to the Great Bear Lake, 
the last large pristine Arctic lake. 
Respecting nature and their elders is 
deeply rooted in the minds of his people 
– not more than 600 souls, almost all of 
whom are Sahtuto’ine Dene. Dene people 
are an aboriginal group of First Nations 
who inhabit the central Northwest 
Territories of Canada. 
Listen to the 
voice of the lake 
Chen Xiaorong
The Bear Lake People 
in the central Northwest 
Territories of Canada have 
taken their destiny into 
their own hands. After decades 
of efforts, they won the right 
to self-governance in 2016. 
That same year, they also 
managed to inscribe their 
territory, Tsá Tué, in UNESCO’s 
World Network of Biosphere 
Reserves. They are on the 
right track to keep alive 
the water’s heart, on which 
their own survival depends.

They live in Déline, a small settlement on 
the western shore of the lake. Sahtuto’ine 
means the ‘Bear Lake People’ and Déline, 
‘where the water flows’. Tutcho is chief 
of the new Déline Got’ine government 
(DGG), Canada’s first indigenous, 
public self-government, formed 
in September 2016. 
Unique relationships
The lake has a Tudze, the Sahtuto’ine 
believe. This ‘water’s heart’ beats at the 
bottom of the lake, pumping its life-giving 
waters through the world’s rivers and 
oceans. The pristine wilderness of the Great 
Bear Lake forms the foundation of their 
cosmology, history and traditional law, and 
of Déline’s renewable resource economy.

A constant message from their elders is 
that they must be responsible custodians 
of the things gifted to them by the earth. 
As long as these gifts are looked after 
and kept in good condition, they, in turn, 
will continue to bestow their bounty 
on the people. 
“We have unique relationships with 
the lake and its surroundings that go 
back thousands and thousands of 
years,” explains Charlie Neyelle, Elders’ 
Representative of the government’s Main 
Council. “Some have prophesied that Great 
Bear Lake will be the last place where the 
water will be alive because the water’s 
heart is still beating,” he says, adding: 
“But if we kill it and if it dies, everything 
will die. To prevent that from happening, 
we need to educate people about the 
importance of water.”
“We don’t value money,” explains elder 
Leon Modeste. What the community is 
worried about is that modernization will 
bring more development projects to 
the reserve, upsetting the natural balance.
Managing 
their own lands
Though the elders of Déline have long 
exhorted everyone to live in harmony with 
their surroundings, climate change and 
increasing development pressures mean 
that drawing on traditions and taking 
other measures to preserve their way of life 
has become imperative. 
The community relies on harvesting fish 
and wildlife to provide for much of its 
needs. Its renewable resource economy 
includes limited – but increasing – tourism 
and infrastructure development.
The establishment of the indigenous 
public DGG has helped the economy 
tremendously. Hard-won after decades 
of political activism, self-rule has meant 
that the Déline community now has one 
government, with one set of rules – making 
it easier to preserve their culture, language, 
spiritual practices and land-based way 
of life. 
For instance, when it was noticed that 
the number of caribou dwindled from 
500,000 fifteen years ago to 60,000 due to 
climate change, the DGG introduced limits 
on hunting the animals. “We all honour 
these rules,” explains Leonard Kenny, 
Community Economic Development 
Officer of the DGG. However, other 
animals, like moose, continue to be hunted 
“to a certain extent,” he adds.
Dene’s spirituality includes appreciating 
all the elements of the world. 
Animals, birds, fish, thunder, lightning, 
water, rocks, all possess a living force 
and must be respected. All of nature is 
alive, and everything has its own spirit. 
Thus, by obeying laws and being effective 
stewards of the land, the essence of being 
Sahtuto’ine is retained by the community.
In 2013, Déline elders and key community 
agencies held talks on setting up 
a biosphere reserve. The Tsá Tué 
biosphere reserve steering committee 
was formed the following year. 
The partnership between government 
and non-government organizations has 
broadened the consensus about the critical 
role indigenous people play in managing 
their own lands. 
In March 2016, Tsa Tué was added to 
UNESCO’s World Network of Biosphere 
Reserves. The event was unanimously 
hailed and celebrated by the community. 
“The lake can’t speak for itself, we are 
going to be the voice for the lake,” 
enthused Gina Bayha, a coordinator for 
the biosphere reserve. 
The Tsá Tué Biosphere Reserve Stewardship 
Council, comprised of Déline residents, 
is in charge of biosphere implementation. 
It includes representatives of the Déline 
Renewable Resources Council, other key 
Déline agencies, Parks Canada, elders and 
youth. Decisions of the council are based 
on consensus. 
Spanning an area of 93,300 square 
kilometres, Tsá Tué is the largest biosphere 
reserve in North America. It includes the 
Great Bear Lake on the Arctic, the largest 
lake lying entirely within Canada, and part 
of its watershed within the Déline District 
of the Sahtu Settlement Region.
Huge expanses of pristine boreal forest 
and taiga, rivers and mountains cover 
much of the watershed, which is divided 
into three ecological zones: the Taiga 
plains in the west; the Taiga shield to the 
south-east, which includes the drainage 
area of the Camsell River; and the Southern 
Arctic ecological zone on the north-eastern 
edge of the lake. Within these eco-zones, 
the lands are further classified into 
nine ecological regions and a total of 
twenty-two eco-districts. Each of these 
smaller areas have a distinct combination 
of landforms, permafrost (perennially 
frozen ground), soils, climate and biological 
communities which makes them unique.
The waters of Tsá Tué are largely 
unpolluted, its fisheries are in good shape, 
and there is an abundance of wildlife. 
The animals found here in large numbers 
include the barren ground caribou, 
grizzly bear, moose and muskox, and a 
variety of migratory birds, attesting to 
the high degree of ecological integrity 
in the reserve. 
The people of Great Bear Lake essentially 
live off the renewable resources offered 
by the lake.

Nightfall at Great Bear Lake.  
The natives believe that Tudze, 
or “Water Heart” lives and breathes 
in the depths of this lake, 
the last to remain intact in the Arctic. 
Don’t let modernity 
kill the heart
Reconciling tradition with modern living 
while ensuring that indigenous people 
can safeguard their economic and social 
well-being is often difficult – with Canada’s 
First Nations people, this is no different. 
Modern life is intrinsically linked to 
modern technologies, the use of which 
depends on the knowledge of modern 
languages. Younger people learn English, 
and gradually lose their connections 
to their tribal language.
According to UNESCO's Atlas of the 
World’s Languages in Danger, there are 
eighty-eight endangered languages in 
Canada. Among them, Sahtúot’įnę Yatį́, 
spoken by the Bear Lake People and 
spread over four communities in Canada 
(1,100 speakers in 2006) is considered 
‘definitely endangered’, which means that 
children no longer learn the language as 
a mother tongue in their homes. It is only 
two steps away from becoming ‘extinct’. 
How then is the knowledge and wisdom 
that elders possess transmitted to younger 
generations? As its languages disappear, 
indigenous knowledge is disappearing too.
On 6 December 2016, Canadian Prime 
Minister Justin Trudeau announced 
his commitment “to enact an Indigenous 
Languages Act, co-developed with 
Indigenous Peoples, with the goal of 
ensuring the preservation, protection, 
and revitalization of First Nations, Métis, 
and Inuit languages” in the country.
The DGG is working on strengthening 
the education system and plans to 
pass their own laws to make sure that 
the Déline are taught and encouraged 
to use their aboriginal language 
at their workplaces.
These efforts reflect both the spirit 
of open-mindedness in Canada and 
a return to traditional sovereignty 
within modernized governance 
structures. It offers important lessons 
for other biosphere initiatives to forge 
new relations of respect, harmony 
and solidarity between humanity 
and the planet.
The Tsá Tué experience, it is hoped, 
will encourage more indigenous 
communities to manage their own 
biosphere reserves.

Biosphere Reserves
UNESCO’s World Network of 
Biosphere Reserves is the centrepiece 
of UNESCO’s Man and the Biosphere 
Programme (MAB), launched 
in 1971. It aims to promote solutions 
by reconciling the conservation 
of biodiversity with its sustainable 
use. Comprising terrestrial, marine 
and coastal ecosystems, biosphere 
reserves are special places for 
testing interdisciplinary approaches 
to understanding and managing 
changes and interactions between 
social and ecological systems, 
including conflict prevention and 
the management of biodiversity. 
They are nominated by national 
governments and remain under 
the sovereign jurisdiction of the states 
where they are located.

The UNESCO Courier, October 1961. 
I knew that I would find a variety of 
opinions in its pages, and a vision that 
was not apolitical − that is not the point 
– but objective; an analysis of the subjects 
that was both balanced and thorough 
at the same time. 
I still have a particularly vivid memory 
of the issues dedicated to the Nubia 
campaign. I was a high-school student 
back then, and knew nothing about the 
Abu Simbel temple. In the Courier issue 
of February 1960, Save the Treasures of 
Nubia, I learnt that the construction of the 
Aswan Dam across the Nile in Egypt would 
flood 3,000-year-old monuments. This was 
at the end of the 1950s, and UNESCO 
mobilized the whole world to save them. 
I came from very modest beginnings 
− my grandparents were illiterate and my 
parents barely knew how to read and write. 
My knowledge came from my studies in 
the public-school system of my country, 
Uruguay, and from my reading. Between 
the ages of 12 and 17, I regularly read the 
UNESCO Courier and that is how I absorbed 
culture. I can still see the images on the 
magazine’s covers, and so many questions 
that shook the world − of science, culture, 
and education during the past century 
− come back to mind. Many of these issues 
still make headlines and remain relevant 
− the challenges posed by illiteracy, 
access to water, preserving the world’s 
historical heritage, etc.
Since it was launched in 1948, the journal 
rapidly gained enormous prestige because 
of its open-mindedness – which made 
it a reference source for hot topics 
and controversial issues. 
Roberto Markarian 
In the 1960s, a teenager dreamed 
of escaping the cramped 
confines of his home in a poor 
neighbourhood in Montevideo, 
where he lived with his parents, 
who were barely literate. 
He wanted to go far, and went 
on to pursue a brilliant career in 
pure and applied mathematics 
in Brazil. He was eventually 
elected rector of the University 
of the Republic in Uruguay, 
in 2014. But before that, Roberto 
Markarian attended another kind 
of school – that of free thought 
– which he discovered within

The UNESCO Courier is 70!70
64   |   The UNESCO Courier  April-June 2018
Back cover of the Courier 
of February 1967.
The Organization garnered tremendous 
international support to undertake 
the monumental effort of entirely 
dismantling the majestic Abu Simbel 
temple and rebuilding it at another 
location, several metres higher − so that 
twice a year, the rays of the sun would 
penetrate the temple’s inner sanctuary, 
just as they did in its original location.
A formative journal
Impressed by the four colossi of Rameses 
II, I read, in an issue entitled Abu Simbel, 
Now or Never (Courier, October 1961), 
this detailed explanation by Peter 
Ritchie-Calder, the famous British scientific 
writer: “A narrow passage leads to the inner 
sanctuary where are seated the statues 
of the three gods to whom the temple is 
dedicated, and Rameses himself. 
And here is seen the purposeful ingenuity 
of the architects and engineers. Like skilful 
stage-lighters, they contrived that the 
rising sun would penetrate 200 feet into 
the heart of the mountain, to illumine 
the faces of only three of the immortals. 
The fourth, the god of the Underworld, 
Ptah, on the extreme left remained 
eternally in darkness. This essential feature 
of Abu Simbel was one of the things taken 
into account in deciding how the temple 
should be finally preserved from the rising 
waters of the High Dam.”
Year after year, the Courier reported 
on every step of this unprecedented 
international undertaking − The Nubian 
Campaign is Launched (May 1960), 
“An Account of Excavation in Nubia during 
1961-1962” (November 1962), Victory in 
Nubia (December 1964), “Dismantling Abu 
Simbel” (November 1965), “Rameses finds 
a New Home” (February 1967), The Greatest 
Archaeological Rescue Operation of all Time 
(February-March 1980) − thus echoing one 
of the greatest victories of international 
solidarity, as the title of an article in the 
August-September 1971 issue suggests.
At the time, the Courier’s collaborators 
included Albert Einstein, Claude 
Lévi-Strauss, Jorge Amado, Bertrand 
Russell, Robert Capa – I discovered who 
they were, what they did and what 
they thought, by reading the journal. 
They enabled me, as the watchword of 
the UNESCO Courier professed back then, 
to look through “an open window onto 
the world”.
When, in the mid-1960s, I started university 
life to study engineering and mathematics, 
I dedicated much of my time to union 
activities and the university’s management, 
and stopped regularly reading the Courier. 
But fortunately, in spite of the vagaries 
of my country’s history, I managed to save 
nearly all the issues I had − bound together 
with a system of metal wires that would 
seem slightly outdated today. 
As for the Courier, it continued its existence 
until 2001, when its monthly publication 
stopped. A lack of financing and 
support forced it to close down in 2011. 
We thought that was the end of it.
A call to humankind
But five years later, the magazine 
reappeared. The first issue of the revived 
Courier was published in April 2017, 
with the motto: “Several Voices, One World”. 
Now a quarterly, it continues to enrich 
the collection. You can access the entire 
collection, from 1948 to the present, 
in the digital archives. Most of the archives 
are available in English, Spanish and 
French, but issues from the last few years 
can be found in many more languages on 
the journal’s website. It is worth the detour. 
I recommend it. Reading the Courier, 
you will discover a serious vision of 
the major current issues facing humanity. 
Its massive ambition – it is one of 
the greatest past and current merits of 
UNESCO – is to promote links between 
various forms of thought, different 
ways of looking at problems, and a call 
to humankind.©

The UNESCO Courier, December 1964.
To reiterate what I have already stated, 
the journal’s major contribution is the 
promotion of a culture which encompasses 
both a diversity of opinions and respect. 
This is the culture − and I say this with 
the utmost sincerity, recalling my family 
background − I acquired by reading the 
Courier with passion and enthusiasm. 
I was a young boy who was eager to learn, 
and through its pages, I found a source 
to do so. This is why I write these lines.
The importance of UNESCO and its Courier 
in today’s world, and tomorrow’s, is even 
more significant, as the fundamental 
principles of the Organization’s Constitution 
are being put to the test by those who 
promote “the mutual incomprehension 
between peoples” and contradict 
these principles “by exploiting ignorance 
and prejudice”. Let us not forget this.
Human dignity: 
the compass guiding 
your journey through 
the world’s cultural 
landscapes
Today there are no more unexplored 
continents, unknown seas or 
mysterious islands. But while we can 
overcome the physical barriers to 
exploration, the barriers of mutual 
ignorance between different peoples 
and cultures have in many cases still 
not been dismantled. A modern Ulysses 
can voyage to the ends of the earth. 
But a different kind of Odyssey now 
beckons – an exploration of the world’s 
many cultural landscapes, the ways 
of life of its different peoples and 
their outlook on the world in which 
they live. It is such an Odyssey that 
the UNESCO Courier now proposes 
to you, its readers. Each month 
contributors of different nationalities 
will provide from different cultural 
and professional standpoints an 
authoritative treatment of a theme of 
universal interest. The compass guiding 
this journey through the world’s 
cultural landscapes will be respect for 
the dignity of man everywhere.

At their highest expression, 
Egyptian conventions were designed 
to mediate between ephemeral men 
and the controlling stars. It is an art 
that consecrates night.
That is what we all must feel before the 
Sphinx at Gizeh, as I remember doing last 
time I saw it at twilight. I thought then, 
how the second, furthermost pyramid 
enfolds the view, and how it makes this 
colossal deathmask seem like the guardian 
of some trap set to lure the heaving desert 
and the darkness. This is the hour when 
the oldest fashioned forms recapture 
the soft murmur with which the desert 
echoes the timeless devotions of the 
East; the hour when they restore to Ufe 
these places where the gods were heard; 
when they banish the immensity of chaos 
and order the stars which seemingly 
emerge from night simply to gravitate 
round them.
In such a way, during three thousand 
years, Egyptian art translated the temporal 
into the eternal.
Let there be no misapprehension about 
this today: it is not as a witness to the past 
that it moves us, nor as what used to 
be called beauty. “Beauty” has become 
one of our age’s most potent mysteries, 
the inexplicable quality which brings 
the Egyptian masterpieces into communion 
with the statues of our own cathedrals, or 
the Aztec temples, or the Indian and Chinese 
grottoes; with the paintings of Cézanne 
and Van Gogh, with the greatest dead and 
the greatest living artists; with, in short, the 
whole treasury of the first world civilization.
This is an immense regeneration, of which 
our own Renaissance will soon seem a 
diffident prefiguring. For the first time, 
men have discovered a universal language 
of art. We feel its influence acutely, even 
if we only partly understand its nature. 
This tremendous storehouse of art, of which 
we are now becoming conscious, draws 
its force no doubt from its being the most 
signal victory of human effort over death. [...]
The emotion we share with the creators of 
these granite statues is not even one of love, 
nor a common feeling for death nor even, 
perhaps, a similar way of looking at their 
work; yet before their work, the accents 
of anonymous sculptors forgotten during 
two thousand years seem to us as much 
untouched by the succession of empires as 
the accents of mother love. [...]
One could not too highly praise your 
[Mr. Director-General of UNESCO] having 
conceived a plan so magnificent and 
so precise in its boldness one might say, 
a kind of Tennessee Valley Authority 
of archaeology. [...]
Your appeal is historic, not because it 
proposes to save the temples of Nubia, 
but because through it the first world 
civilization publicly proclaims the world’s 
art as its indivisible heritage. In days 
when the West believed its cultural 
heritage had its source in Athens, it could 
nonetheless look on with equanimity while 
the Acropolis crumbled away.
The slow flood of the Nile has reflected the 
melancholy caravans of the Bible, the armies 
of Cambyses and Alexander, the knights 
of Byzantium and Islam, the soldiers of 
Napoleon. No doubt when the sand-storm 
blows across it, its ancient memory no 
longer distinguishes the brilliant notes of 
Rameses’s triumph from the pathetic dust 
that settles again in the wake of defeated 
armies. And when the sand is scattered 
again, the Nile is once more alone with its 
sculpted mountains, its colossal effigies 
whose motionless reflection has for so long 
been part of its echo of eternity.
But see, old river, whose floods allowed 
astrologers to fix the most ancient date in 
history, men are coming now, from all parts 
of the world, who will carry these giants 
far away from your life-giving, destructive 
waters. Let the night fall, and you will 
reflect again the stars under which Isis 
accomplished her funeral rites, the star of 
Rameses. But the humblest worker come to 
rescue the statues of Isis and Rameses will 
tell you something you have always known 
but never heard from men before: that there 
is only one action over which indifferent 
stars and unchanging, murmurous rivers 
have no sway: it is the action of a man who 
snatches something from death.

Cultural heritage sites face an unprecedented 
escalation of damage and destruction today. 
The rebuilding of these sites could play 
an essential role in reinforcing the  identity 
of populations.  
This issue examines the restoration of  
some of the world’s most significant sites. 
It explores  the lessons learned from 
the reconstruction of  mosques in Timbuktu 
(Mali) and the Mostar Bridge 
(Bosnia and Herzegovina). It also discusses 
the issues raised by the potential  
rebuilding of  devastated sites in Syria 
and Afghanistan in the future.
