Terra-cotta twosome
This terra-cotta double vase (31 cm high) dates from the 19th century of the pre-
Christian era when it was fashioned by an Anatolian ceramist in the form of two figures
joined together by a bridge-like handle. The figures seem to have been caught in a mo¬
ment of open-mouthed expostulation, rendered by the craftsman with humour and an
economy of means which appear astonishingly modern. The vessel was unearthed at
Kiiltepe in Turkey, one of the sites where archaeologists have brought to light many
vestiges of the ancient Hittite civilization of Asia Minor (see also page 9).

Mustafa Kemal Atatürk, father of modern Turkey, was born
one hundred years ago. To mark the centenary, the Turkish
permanent delegation to Unesco organized a series of
cultural events in Paris earlier this year, including exhibitions,
concerts and dancing displays. It was through the
educational and cultural reforms brought about by Atatürk
that the Turkish people, especially young people and women,
were introduced to the twentieth century world, as will be
seen in the following three articles published in this issue of
the Unesco Courier.
ATATÜRK
o
The birth of a modern nation amid
the ruins of the Ottoman Empire
by Bülent Tanör
BÜLENT TANÖR, is professor at the law faculty
of Istanbul University. He is the author of full-
length works on aspects of constitutional law,
such as freedom of opinion and social rights, and
of studies which have appeared in various
specialized journals.
MUSTAFA Kemal Atatürk first
appeared on the stage of
modern history as the victo¬
rious leader in Turkey's War of In¬
dependence (1919-1922), but later, the
far-reaching changes he brought to his
country over more than a decade
(1922-1935) were to reveal his capacity
as a great reformer. His life and work
are part of the story of one of the great
movements of the twentieth century
the uprising of oppressed peoples
against colonialist and imperialist
domination.
The end of the First World War saw
the dismemberment of that amorphous
amalgam of nations and religions, the
Ottoman Empire, and, when on 19 May
1919, Mustafa Kemal landed at the
Black Sea port of Samsun to organize
national resistance against the foreign
invasion, he described his country's
situation in these words:

Turkey's capitals,
old and new
Two continents, Asia and Europe, meet at Istanbul linked by a bridge 1,074 metres
long (above) that spans the narrow straits of the Bosphorus which stretch
31 kilometres between the Black Sea and the Sea of Marmara. Combining boldness
and grace, this ultra-modern structure, opened to traffic in 1973, puts the stamp of the
future on Turkey's ancient capital with its Byzantine and Ottoman past. From Istanbul
the road leads into the heart of Anatolia to Ankara (below) which Mustafa Kemal
Atatürk (opposite page) designated in 1923 as the country's new capital. Ankara's
population was then 30,000; today it has reached the 2 million mark.

<![CDATA[
j "The group of Powers to which the
Ottoman Empire belonged has been
defeated in the war. Everywhere the Ot¬
toman army is in disarray. A harsh ar¬
mistice has been concluded. The long
years of the Great War have left the na¬
tion exhausted and impoverished. The
men who dragged the people into that
war have abandoned them and fled, to
save their own skins... The Cabinet is
without strength, dignity or courage; it
is entirely subject to the will of the
Sultan and is ready to agree to any ar¬
rangement that will guarantee its own
safety and that of the Sovereign. The
army has been and continues to be
deprived of arms and ammunition. The
Allied Powers have no intention of
observing the terms of the armistice.
Under various pretexts, their fleets and
armies are installed at Istanbul. The
Vilayet of Adana is occupied by the
French; Urfa, Maras and Aintab by the
English. At Adalia and Konya, there are
Italian troops... At Merzifon and Stam-
bul, English troops."
In response to this disastrous situa¬
tion dozens of centres of resistance in
the form of local committees or guerilla
movements soon sprang up throughout
Anatolia and Thrace.
At this point Mustafa Kemal decided
on a course of action suited to the cir¬
cumstances. Unlike the "Unionist"
Young Turks in the second constitu¬
tional period of the Ottoman Empire
(1908-1918), he did not wish to gain
power through armed insurrection. He
knew that a move for independence
could succeed only if it was carried out
with and by the people. National revolu¬
tion could be based only upon
democratic principles. First of all,
therefore, he had to create a political
framework for resistance.
Before taking on a military character,
therefore, the Turkish independence
struggle was first fought on the political
level. The transformation of local
assemblies first into regional bodies,
then into a national one (the Grand Na¬
tional Assembly of Turkey), bears
witness to this political and popular
aspect of the anti-imperialist combat.
What sort of man was Mustafa
Kemal? Born in 1881 into a middle-class
family at Salónica, he received his
education in military schools, which
were virtually the only road to advance¬
ment for the young men of Turkish-
Muslim society. His military career very
soon brought him into contact with the
political realities of a declining empire.
While still at cadet-school he became
involved in the liberal plots against the
despotism of Sultan Abdul Hamid II,
who was to be overthrown by the liberal
revolution of 1908-1909.
When he was posted to Syria he
became convinced that only a Turkish
national state which ceased oppressing
other peoples could benefit the Turks
themselves. His experiences with the
6
leaders of the Young Turk movement
brought home to him the need for the
separation of civil and military power,
with the latter subject to the former.
Though Kemal was opposed to the
pro-German and adventurist policy of
the Young Turk faction when it was in
power before and during the First
World War, this did not mean that he
favoured a policy of submission to the
Allies. His aim was to free his country
from dependence of every kind, and
when he was posted to the Caucasus
front during the Russian revolution of
October 1917, his contact with Russian
prisoners of war gave him a deeper

knowledge of the revolutionary aims of
neighbouring peoples.
With his gifts of observation and
analysis, his intuition and prudence,
Mustafa Kemal was a good strategist,
not only on the battlefield but also in
the political struggles he was to face.
His strategy during the war of liberation
was to unite the various anti-imperialist
elements (reconciling the intellectuals,
for example, with the landowners and
notables) in order to speed the coming
of national independence. Once in¬
dependence had been achieved, he
launched into a programme of reforms
that was to turn military victories into
civil triumphs. For the job facing
Kemal's forces immediately after the
war of independence was essentially
that of creating a national State and a
national society. This meant breaking
completely with the old political and
social systems.
With independence gained and the
concessions made by the Ottomans
rescinded by the Treaty of Lausanne
(1923), the new Turkey was in a posi¬
tion to start out along the road to pro¬
gress and reform, free from all foreign
interference and intrusion. Moreover,
Mustafa Kemal and his comrades, now
in full control of the internal situation,
enjoyed the support of the people who,
for the first time in their history, had the
experience of co-operating with their
rulers. Indeed, with its breadth of scope
and its essentially political nature, the
Anatolian movement, in which all
classes of the population had taken
part, guaranteed at least the peoples'
tacit consent to the planned reforms.
Resistance came only from religious
fanatics and a small backward-looking
section of the elite. For the first time in
Turkish history, the spirit of revolu¬
tionary reform found itself in a
favourable climate.
What were the main achievements of
the Kemalist period in Turkey? First, the
suppression of the Sultanate (1922), the
setting up of the Turkish Republic
(1923) and the abolition of the Caliphate
(1924) three complementary acts bas¬
ed on one principle: national sovereign¬
ty. This principle had been the
Kemalists' watchword ever since the
beginning of the War of Independence,
and it became an ideological and
political instrument for the building
of a democratic national State on the
ruins of an obscurantist, reactionary
monarchy.
By separating the caliphate from the
sultanate, and doing away with the lat¬
ter, the new Turkey was making a
move, unprecedented in the Islamic
world, towards the separation of
spiritual and temporal powers. It was
only a first step. Since the Caliphate
continued to exist as ah institution, the
dualism persisted and was to make
itself particularly felt after the proclama¬
tion of the Republic in 1923.
This equivocal situation ended in
1924 when the Caliphate was abolished,
thus concluding the struggle against
any power, whether Islamic or Chris¬
tian, smacking of Ottoman interna¬
tionalism. The Muslim caliph was
deposed and expelled, as was the Or¬
thodox patriarch who had symbolized
the internationalism of the Eastern
Church by virtue of political powers that
the Treaty of Lausanne had terminated.
These changes in the period 1922 to
1924 showed clearly the Turkish
reformers' determination to bring about
the secularization of the State. The
nature of Turkish public law altered and
the principle of conformity to Qur'anic
law gave way to that of conformity to
the "national will", or "national
sovereignty" principles which were

solemnly recognized and established by
the Constitutions of 1921 and 1924.
This secularization of the machinery
of State was to end in the dissolution of
the Qur'anic courts, the elimination of
Islam as the State religion (1928) and
the inclusion in the Constitution (1937)
of a statement of the principle of
sécula rity.
The need for a similar transformation
was apparent also in the realm of
private law which, in spite of earlier at¬
tempts at reform, still suffered from the
defects of religious legislation and the
conflicts arising from clashes of
religions and cultures. Far from being
eliminated, their difficulties had been
aggravated by the creation of a hybrid
legal "system" in which laws of
religious origin existed side by side with
other laws of lay origin. The new
republican legislation put an end to this
duality by modernizing and secularizing
the entire legal code.
In this connexion, the adaptation to
Turkey's purposes of the Swiss civil
code was an important event, especially
in the fields of economic law and the
rights of women. The adoption of
modern principles concerning property
and contract law facilitated the
development of a capitalist production
system within a semi-feudal society. As
for the status of women, the institution
of monogamie civil marriage and the
recognition of legal equality between
men and women already constituted a
'.'legal liberation" of women, a prelude
to their emancipation. Here again we
see how Mustafa Kemal Atatiirk's vi¬
sion was in accord with the movement
of history.
During the First World War, Turkish
women, forced to fill the place left by
their husbands away at the front, had
made their appearance in society and
the world of work, and this led to the
movement for the abolition of that sym¬
bol of discrimination, the veil.
Later, Turkish women took part in
the War of Independence, either
fighting, dressed like men, or behind
the lines, working to feed the army,
organizing demonstrations, starting
clubs, etc. In fact, just like men, Turkish
women were fully involved in the
struggle. In 1921, a French journalist
asked Mustafa Kemal what would
become of women in a Turkey already
"so profoundly changed". He
answered: "They will have complete
equality... they have won their
freedom.'.' Thus when Turkish women
were at last accorded their rights, these
were not granted as a favour or out of
some political caprice; they had been
established through a process of
historical evolution strongly marked by
Atatürk's influence.
Reforms in culture and education
were no less important. In 1924 the
whole education system was unified .
and laicized under a national ministry, r
From steppe to lecture-room
Immediately the republic was proclaimed, Atatürk set about implementing his programme
of reforms throughout the country. He took it upon himself to involve the humblest folk,
such as the Anatolian camel-drivers and shepherds with whom he is seen in top photo,
and to introduce modern techniques (above) into a rural world where farming practices
had changed little since medieval times. He was the architect of a secular legal system
which redefined the status of the citizen. Below, Atatürk with students at the Law

, This reform affected not only centres of
Muslim religious teaching but also
foreign schools which disseminated a
cosmopolitan and alienating culture.
From that time on, if they wanted to
survive, they had to conform to modern
lay principles.
Next came a major break with "tradi¬
tional" culture, the adoption of a
Latinized phonetic alphabet, which was
made compulsory in 1928. This reform
made it easier for very wide sections of
the population to learn to read and
write. It also contributed to the enrich¬
ment of the Turkish language, whose
development had been hampered, if not
paralysed, by the use of an alphabet
completely alien to it. "A nation must
have plenty of courage", said the
French writer, Georges Duhamel, in the
1950s, "to carry out a revolution of this
kind in an orderlyfashion and simply by
legal enactment."
"Positivism", in the sense of a
secular philosophy, is the best word to
describe the true nature of republican
education in Kemal's Turkey. And this
once more is inseparable from the
democratic and national character of
the Turkish revolution.
In spite of some resistance and a few
vain attempts to turn back the clock,
the objectives of this revolution have, to
a large extent, been achieved in
present-day Turkey. It is already possi¬
ble to speak of a consensus on this
point among the country's most in¬
fluential political and social forces.
Mustafa Kemal's thought and actions
have left such a deep and durable im¬
print on the history of his country that it
is easy to understand why the Turkish
people, through their representatives in
the Grand National Assembly, bestow¬
ed on hin the name "Atatürk", or,
"Father of the Turks".

Archaeological
treasure trove
Few countries in the world are as rich in
archaeological remains as Turkey, where
the most diverse civilizations succeeded
one another over a period of some
7,000 years. Vestiges of Neolithic and
Chalcolithic settlements are to be found
there along with relics from the cultures of
the Assyrians, Hittites, Phrygians, Urartu,
Persians, Greeks and Romans, as well as
the monuments of Byzantium and the
Seljuk dynasties. Atatürk Infused new life
into Turkish archaeology and conservation,
for until his time the prospection, study
and restoration of the country's rich
heritage of sites and monuments had been
severely restricted by lack of resources.

In the heart of the Hittite empire
Some 150 kilometres east of Ankara, at Bogazköy in the heart of Anatolia stand the ruins of Hattusa (below). This
ancient city built during the first half of the second millennium BC was the capital of the powerful Hittite empire.
During the last half century thousands of clay tablets from the royal archives of Hattusa (inscribed in seven
hitherto unknown languages) have been deciphered, revealing the economic, political and religious structures of
the Hittite world and the civilization that existed in Anatolia as early as the third millennium BC. Among the art
treasures left by the Hittite empire, which grew to rival the Egypt of the Pharaohs, are rock carvings, ceramics
(see page 2), copper and bronze figurines, depictions of animals, and curious objects such as the solar disc (above)
from Alaca Huyük, which is also the site of the inscrutable head hewn out of the living rock (left).

ATATÜRK O

the voice of the people
Ottoman, the tongue of a chosen few,
was a language barrier to development
by Cetin Altan
TURKEY'S unremitting struggle to
pursue its development in the last
half century constitutes a particu¬
larly notable chapter in the history of
the modern world.
The reason for this lies in the cir¬
cumstances of Turkish history. The Ot¬
toman empire is the first and only case
of an Islamic empire which, having sur¬
vived until the early part of the twen¬
tieth century, was transformed into a
modern secular republic.
In 1922, after the fall of the Ottoman
dynasty, Turkey was a vast country
with a population of fifteen million, 80
per cent of whom were illiterate. The
home of an impoverished peasant
society, it was a land without a com¬
munications network, lacking port

facilities, and bereft of water and elec¬
tricity supplies.
The imperial language did not long
outlive the Sultanate, for incredible
though it may seem, the language
which had been that of the Ottoman
empire for six centuries was totally
obliterated within two decades. How
and why did this come about?
In spite of an apparent religious
cohesion and an original system of
government, the Ottoman empire never
fully succeeded in welding together the
masses of which it was composed. This
is why it was known as the Ottoman
and not the Turkish empire. Further¬
more, the Ottomans spoke not Turkish
but Ottoman, an artificial language
which the people did not understand.
Ottoman was used at court and among
the élite, but nowhere else. The people
spoke Turkish.
Unlike Latin and ancient Greek, Ot¬
toman was not an "archaic" tongue.
Nor was it a homogeneous language
like Arabic and Persian, spoken by large
numbers of people and shaped by
popular cultures. It was a curious
hybrid, a mixture of Arabic, Persian
and Turkish which neither Turks nor
Persians nor Arabs could easily
understand.
And so it is not surprising that Ot¬
toman should have died out so quickly
and so completely, to the point where
only a few dozen people, specialists for
the most part, can read and understand
the language in Turkey today.
The fact that the people and their
rulers spoke such radically different
languages perpetuated a split in
Turkey's cultural life. On the one hand
there was a popular Turkish literature
produced by the people, and on the
other an Ottoman literature created by
court and palace poets. The people
took no interest in Ottoman literature,
which they did not understand, while
10

popular literature won few devotees at
court where it was held to be "coarse".
This strange cultural hiatus formed
the background for many an odd
episode in Turkish history. When the
Sunnite Muslim Sultan Selim I set out
to conquer Persia in 1512, for example,
he wrote poems strongly influenced by
the Persian language. His opponent
Shah Ismail I, the Shiite ruler of Persia,
wrote poems in Turkish. The Shah of
Persia who, wrote in Turkish was to be
vanquished by the Ottoman Sultan who
wrote in Persian.
The literary dualism between Turkish
and Ottoman continued for centuries.
Not until the second half of the nine¬
teenth century did Westernizing in¬
fluences begin to appear in literature.
and even then they were too slight to
bring about a rapprochement between
Ottoman literature and the Turkish
language.
All thinking on the subject of social
change was confined to closed Ot¬
toman circles which patterned
themselves on the Western model of
what an intellectual should be, and
were always cut off from the people
since the language in which they for¬
mulated their ideas was Ottoman.
These Ottoman intellectuals were
regarded as "Westernized" and
"snobs" by the people, who used them
as a boundless source of inspiration for
characters who could be satirized in
shadow theatre (karagóz) and popular
drama.
unsuitable vehicle for noble literary ex¬
pression. There ensued a long and
violent series of polemics between the
supporters of the "shepherd's
language" and their opponents.
The ultimate victory of Turkish over
Ottoman only came with the reforms in¬
troduced by Atatürk, notably the
replacement of the Arabic by the Latin
alphabet in 1928 and the creation of the
Turkish Language Society for the
Purification of the Language.
The cultural duality which was so
marked a feature of the Ottoman Em¬
pire goes some way to explaining why
Turkey, in spite of possessing the
necessary resources for a rapid
emergence from under-development,
should have been so handicapped in its
Stylized signature of Sultan Selim III, left,
exemplifies the gap that used to exist
between the written and the spoken
language in Turkey. The court language,
Ottoman, strongly influenced by Arabic and
Persian, was not understood by the people
and was a brake on social and cultural
development. To remedy this situation
Atatürk reformed the educational system,
introduced the Latin alphabet in place of
Arabic characters, changed the system of
weights and measures, the calendar and
the way of writing figures. Right, Atatürk
visits a high school class.
A closed book to the masses, restricted to
a few initiates, scholars and high officials,
Ottoman became the prisoner of Its own
exclusiveness.
Nevertheless, a Turkish literary
movement soon emerged, even among
the élite, to stand out against the Ot¬
toman literary tide. Its task was not an
easy one. Turkish, always excluded
from élite literature, was frowned on as
an insufficiently sophisticated instru¬
ment of expression. It may be true that
Ottoman lent itself to a greater richness
of metaphorical language; the fact re¬
mained that it was an artificial language
which the people did not understand.
The "Young Turks", who champion¬
ed the extension of liberties and called
for the establishment of a constitutional
monarchy, were the originators of this
attempt to introduce Turkish into "high
literature". But their move brought pro¬
tests from certain intellectuals, sup¬
porters of the Young Turks in political
matters, who claimed that Turkish was
a "mere shepherd's language" and an
advance along the road to economic
and social progress.
The linguistic drawback was always
an obstacle to enrichment of thought.
Since Arabic remained the language of
religion and Ottoman the language of
the notables, the Turkish-speaking
masses were inevitably excluded from
cultural exchanges which only took
place within certain social groups and in
certain specific fields.
Religious and secular leaders, en¬
trenched behind an Arabic which they
professed to command completely and
an Ottoman which no one understood,
so intimidated the people that even to¬
day there are those who believe that it is
a sin to translate the Qur'an into
Turkish.
The fact that printing was introduced
into Turkey almost three centuries after k
its invention, that both popular and Ot- r

toman literature consisted almost ex¬
clusively of poetry until the middle of
the nineteenth century (the first Turkish
novel was written around 1890), and
that interpretation of the Qur'an had to
conform to certain prescribed norms-
all these factors had a sterilizing effect
on social thought and intellectual
creativity.
A society in which rulers and ruled do
not speak the same language, in which
there is no philosophical speculation,
no fiction, no printing, no theatre and
no painting, is bound to meet obstacles
when breaking free from the fetters of
the past, pursuing its destiny and
building its future.
If we are here emphasizing the
linguistic aspect of the Ottoman
heritage, this is not to deny that
obstacles to development are always
extremely complex and diverse.
Steps to Westernize Turkey had
already been taken as early as 1839
when Sultan Abdulmecit and his vizier
Reshid Pasha decided to carry out a
number of major reforms in law, educa¬
tion and cultural life. But faced with a
mounting foreign debt, the Ottoman
empire's search for renewal ended in an
economic cul-de-sac.
Although the Ottoman reformers set
their eyes on European "modernism",
they never took European systems of
production as their model. Concen¬
trating instead on European-style pat¬
terns of consumption which .then
prevailed in the wealthy quarters of
Istanbul, they fell victim to a colossal
misunderstanding. They did not realize
that if Westernization were to become
an economic fact, then it had to be
expressed above all in new forms of
production.
When Turkey became aware of what
had gone wrong, it was too late. More
and more obstacles had arisen to block
the road to economic development, and
society still lacked the dynamism which
could have overridden such barriers.
There were not enough cadres and the
country's technological potential was
too weak. The opening to the West did
not lead to a real industrial revolution.
Not until the end of the Ottoman em¬
pire did Kemalist Turkey set course for a
veritable renaissance. Under the drive
of Atatürk, rigid dogmas were shat¬
tered, rulers and ruled began to speak
and write the same language,
weaknesses in intellectual and artistic
creativity were remedied, and the
numbers of cadres and technicians
increased.
In spite of demographic growth
(Turkey today has a population of over
45 million) the illiteracy rate has drop¬
ped from 80 per cent to 30 per cent.
Modern Turkey is thus well on the
way to emancipating itself from the
conditions which it once knew, those of
a vast, inward-looking rural society.

The village bards of Anatolia
sing a new song
FOR centuries travelling minstrels have roved the Anatolian
countryside. Though they are still called by their traditional
name of asik (or lover, pronounced ashik) they are no longer the
timorous poets of old seeking the beloved. "The black earth is my
only true love", sang Veysel (above), one of the most popular asik
of this century, as he went from village to village. Today's asik
see themselves as "lovers of the truth". Theirs is no longer an
improvised art aimed at illiterate audiences, for they themselves
have learned to write. Many of them took part in Atatürk's
national revival and literacy drive ; others were associated with the
famous "village institutes" which produced some of the great
writers of peasant origin who are the pride of modern Turkish
literature.
Many of the asik, keeping up the old tradition, still wander
through the countryside. But today their music is published and,
with the spread of radio and television there is scarcely a village
where one cannot buy asik records and cassettes. Moreover, with
the changes that have swept Turkey in the last half century the
content of their message has changed and so has their style.
Many asik of the present generation take up political and ethical
issues such as nuclear energy, decolonization, disarmament or the
conquest of space; they have become more caustic in their
criticism and more pressing in their demand for social justice.
Another novelty is that women have now joined their ranks. For
example, Sahtuma, a blind poetess from a village in eastern
Anatolia, sings of the plight of the poor peasant woman: "She
divides her loaf into forty portions/she tills the soil for little
return/she rocks her baby's wooden cradle...". Today the most
popular asik, abandoning time-honoured clichés, are concentrating
on more serious themes. They sing of the afflictions of the
contemporary world, describing man's striving, his hopes,
disillusion, joys and doubts. For, as the peasant poet Hasan
Devrani has written, "It would be disgraceful for a poet to show
the world upside down. I, for one, would be ashamed".

ATATÜRK O
In the avant-garde of literature
ANEW
GENERATION
OF TURKISH WOMEN
by Guzin Dino

The Constitution of the Turkish Republic made primary education compulsory for
girls ás well as for boys. This schoolgirl seems to have taken to heart the advice
given to Turkish women by Atatürk in 1925: "Let them show their face to the world
and observe it attentively with their own eyes...".
OVER the past fifteen years,
women writers have come to
play a significant role in the lit¬
erary avant-garde in Turkey. With their
special sensibility they have brought a
breath of fresh air to Turkish literature.
This phenomenon is of particular
significance because it calls into ques¬
tion the many prohibitions and aliena¬
tions that have long been a constraint
on the social and private life of women
in Turkey, a problem they share with
women in the rest of the Third World
(not to mention Western women, who
also have problems of their own).
When they took up arms in the war of
independence, Turkish women were
among the first women in the Muslim
world to fight for the liberation of their
country. Today, expressing themselves
with amazing freedom and daring, they
bring the same courage to bear in their
attack on conservative social attitudes.
This does not mean, however, that
Turkish women writers are "feminists".
In their view, to make a special case of
women, even in their own defence,
would amount to a concession, an ac¬
ceptance of the segregation of the
sexes.
The position of women writers in
contemporary Turkish letters can be
better understood if it is remembered
that in the 1950s a strong current of
writing of peasant origin had emerged
in parallel with the literary output of
urban intellectuals. These writers spoke
for the first generation of Turkish
peasants who, after centuries of il¬
literacy and hardship, thanks to school
reform and the good work of rural in¬
stitutes, were at last able to draw public i
attention to their often formidable I

Four
leading
lights
Portraits of four prominent figures in modern Turkish literature. Halidé Edip Adivar (1884-1964) was
a leading member of the first generation of Turkish women writers. Nezihe Meric broke away
from conventional narrative style with her earliest short stories published in 1951. In her writings,
as in later work by Furuzan and Adalet Agaoglu written in the 1970s, the harshness of social
reality can be glimpsed through a poetic and at times minutely detailed evocation of experience.
y problems. This they did in a language
that revealed the richness of their
popular culture and their acute sensibili¬
ty, heightened by centuries of social
constraints. When peasant writers
found their voice it was as if a time-
bomb had exploded. In just the same
way, the vigour of present-day
women's writing can be explained by all
those centuries of enforced silence. In
fact, the voices of these two social
groups, the last to make themselves
heard, constitute the two most striking
and original developments of the last
twenty years.
It must be remembered that, for five
hundred years, Turkish women had
borne the heavy burden of the wars of
the Ottoman Empire and, from the nine¬
teenth century until 1923, that of semi-
colonization. Perhaps that is why there
has always been a popular tradition that
portrays woman as the singer of death,
the keening mourner not only at
funerals but whenever great disasters
strike the community.
Society and popular oral traditions
have reserved for women the melan¬
choly task of improvising agit, or
elegiac poetry. Some of these works
have been written down and published.
Many of them are masterpieces.
The numerous modern women
writers I wish to refer to here have
benefited from the first social advances
brought about by the Republic. Borne
on this current they have been able
since 1954 to make a stand against a
social hierarchy and a strict morality
based on values that were challenged in
the general disturbance that followed
14
the war. But whereas men writers
sought to situate themselves among
modern, mainly Western, currents of
writing and thought, female Turkish
novelists and story-writers, braving the
uncertain climate of a real transform¬
ation, have opened up a new universe,
describing it in an original language nur¬
tured by the frustration of their own ex¬
istence. A new facet of the Turkish soul
has come to light, an awareness of the
strangeness of ordinary, everyday life,
hitherto unknown or ignored in
literature.
Here again, it is not a matter of
"feminism", or of literature concerned
only with women. But it is thanks to
women that Turkish literature today
shows society a more complete and
truthful picture of itself, at several levels
of writing, from the conscious to the
unconscious, from the most lucid kind
of vision to the wildest of fantasies.
Let us take Leyla Erbil, for example.
Her first stories, published in 1956, aim¬
ed at dispelling the conventional mys¬
tique about the character of "the Orien¬
tal woman". She describes a social
crisis that concerns not only Turkey and
not only women; it has to do with ex¬
istential problems of our time.
The passage I am about to quote is a
new kind of funeral lament the
speaker is a widow. The traditional agit
tell of ineffable grief for the departed,
but here the widow mourns her own
wasted life, with its long succession of
frustrated desires and disappointed
hopes: it is a statement of failure.
"You're dead. So you're really dead.
And what is going to become of me?
It's no joke being the wife of a dead civil
servant... Will a dead man's pay be
The
snake-queen
Shameran, a traditional
character In Turkish fairy¬
tales made a notable come¬
back recently in a short
story by the novelist Nazll
Eray. Half-woman, half-
snake, the beautiful
Shameran, right, was also a
favourite with folk artists,
including painters on glass.

Emancipation
"Any man who speaks to a woman In
public or who makes signs to her is liable
to punishment under article 202 of the Code
of Criminal Procedure". This rule was still
in force In the Ottoman empire less than a
century ago, and up to the end of the First
World War men and women travelled
separately in public transport. The new
Civil Code adopted in 1926 eliminated
discrimination in civil law and gave women
the same rights as men. Photo right shows

She is taking stock of an unsatisfac¬
tory life, devoid of real love. One would
really need to quote the whole text to
get the full effect, made up of an ac¬
cumulation of little touches conveying
bitterness and despair. Leyla Erbil's
story has no novelistic plan and remains
ambiguous in both meaning and form.
To achieve this result she uses language
situated somewhere between imagina¬
tion, fantasy, the real and the
remembered.
There are many of these women
novelists and short-story writers, work¬
ing at the frontiers of contemporary
literature: Nezihe Meriç, Adalet
Agaoglu, Furuzan, Sevim Burak, Sevgi
Soysal (who died recently), and Tomris
Uyar, to mention only the best-known.
The dominant feature of Nazli Eray's
work is the strangeness of her subjects.
She renews the spirit of traditional folk¬
tales, making fantasy seem both sur¬
prising and perfectly natural.
One of the stories in / Knew the
Night, a collection published in 1980, is
about Izzet Efendi, who has a snake liv¬
ing inside him, which he feeds on milk:
this is related in a matter-of-fact way,
quite naturally, as it were.
When Marusia falls in love with Izzet
Efendi, the snake gets up to its tricks,
squirming and wriggling inside Izzet
Efendi's entrails whenever it hears
Marusia's voice. One day "they sat
down side by side on the divan. Her
plump white arm was against Izzet
Efendi's shirt. Then he told her
everything. Marusia was horrified.
There was a snake then, as well as her,
inside Izzet Efendi? How was it possi¬
ble? She burst out sobbing. She asked
Izzet Efendi to get rid of the snake, to
put it out. She wanted to be the only
one inside Izzet Efendi..."
The obsessive presence of this snake
in Eray's story has an unexpected con¬
nexion with themes found in folk-tales.
Was not the legendary Queen of the
Snakes (Shameran) half woman, half
serpent? Does not the collective im¬
agination at work in fairy stories, like
the Anatolian paintings on glass, give
her a surpassingly beautiful face and
the body of a reptile?

The collection contains other comical
and startling phenomena a mermaid
who is raped and then hauled off to the
police station with her attacker, a
grandmother with goat's feet, and an
old maid who finds a husband inside a
sort of Twelfth Night cake wrapped up
in mauve paper. All these elements re¬
mind one of folk-tales and are endowed
by Nazli Eray with a symbolic
psychological or social truth that ac¬
quires a new dimension from its admix¬
ture of strangeness.
Sometimes Nazli Eray grafts a very
personal and modern kind of fantasy on
to the traditional variety. In The Man on
the Plain the woman who tells the story
is walking to Chicago with a black
American. He describes the city, which
he got to know when he was a lift atten¬
dant in a skyscraper. The narrator
becomes slowly immersed in the vast
town and somehow finds herself in the
very lift that was the pride and joy of her
companion in his youth.
"In the lift there are just the black and
me. The black pushes thousands of
buttons. In the middle of Chicago, in
this enormous hotel, we are shooting
up and down like lightning. The black
man says, 'Say, sister, I'm happy. I'm in
control. Look, this lift goes just where I
want it to go.' We're going up and
down the building like lightning. I got,
jealous of the black. 'Yes', I said, 'but
the lift can only go up and down right
here in this building'. "
An ambiguous story. Why do these
two meet? Is it because there is a
parallel between the situation of the
woman who has broken away, or who
wants to break away, from oppressive
constraints, and that of the black, trap¬
ped by the effects of technological or
social automation? At all events, we
have here a proof that women writers
are also crossing geographical frontiers
in the search for answers to their
problems.
Let us also consider Sevim Burak.
Her work surprises, shocks and
disconcerts the reader, as she plunges
us straight into the strangeness of the
ordinary. "When one is living", said
Sartre, "nothing happens. The scenery
changes and people go in and out, that
is all." That is how it is in Sevim Burak's
stories. The most amazing things hap¬
pen unobtrusively.
One short story, published in 1965, is
made up of entries in the private diary
of Bilal, an insignificant individual who
lives beside the Bosphorus. He doesn't
want children, but his mistress is preg¬
nant. From the Diary, with all its trivial
details, there gradually emerges a
question.
"September 3rd, 1930. Zembul got HI
during the night, so I wasn't up until
late this morning. My watch had stop¬
ped. I went down to the quayside to put
it right. Then to the butcher's for a
pound of mince and half a pound of
meat for the kebab. Came home. "
Twenty-six pages of trite entries in
the same vein bring the reader to a
dramatic leap or skid out of the rational
world. So for April 25th we read: "I had
to rest on the bed for an hour or two. A
needle that had got stuck in my left heel
was giving me a lot of pain (...)

soldered to their feet had probably served to fix them
to a base.
Despite the fact that they had been immersed in
water for hundreds of years the figures were of ex¬
ceptional interest. Their discovery was to add con¬
siderably to our knowledge of Greek art in the fifth
century BC, for they.belong to a style of which there
are very few known examples apart from the statue
of Zeus or Poseidon in the National Museum in
Athens, the Charioteer of- Delphi, and the
Chatsworth Head in the British Museum in London.
In fact, the Congress of Magna Graecia Studies, held
in Taranto a little more than a month after the
discovery, recognized them as authentic examples of
classical Athenian art.
Later, they were attributed to Phidias, the greatest
sculptor of ancient Greece who lived in Athens bet¬
ween 490 and 431 BC. At the request of the Athenian
statesman Pericles, Phidias sculpted a series of
monuments which are known to us through various
literary documents. And it was Phidias together with
his pupils who carved the frontispiece and friezes of
the Parthenon in Athens.
Specialists believe that the Riace bronzes belong¬
ed to a group of eleven statues of heroes that were
intended to decorate the temple at Delphi. Among
the arguments used to support this theory is the
striking resemblance between the head of the long¬
haired warrior and a relief in frit (soft porcelain) by
Phidias, now in the Heidelberg Museum in the
Federal Republic of Germany. The relief is a portrait
in profile of Codros, one of the very heroes whose
statues were destined for the Delphi temple.
Though no firm conclusion has yet been reached
about the origin of the Riace bronzes, there is no
doubt as to their importance. It is impossible to re¬
main unmoved by their beauty, for they have a
radiance which one only finds in great works of art.
How did these statues come to be stranded on the
sea bed off Riace? Situated in the extreme south of
the Italian Peninsula, Calabria formed part of Magna
Graecia and in the seventh and sixth centuries BC the
whole area was colonized by the Greeks. Rich and
cultured communities developed there, including the
prosperous city-ports of Crotone, Loci and Reggio
on the Ionian Sea.
To which of these ports was the ship carrying the
statues bound? So far, no one has been able to
answer this question. It is thought that the vessel
foundered and sank along with its cargo and that,
later, the wooden wreck broke up and, relieved of
the weight of the bronzes, drifted away in heavy
seas. In 1973, a handle from one of the warriors'
shields was discovered on the sea bed nearby, along
with thirty lead rings used to attach the rigging in
ancient vessels.
After being exhibited at the Archaeological
Museum in Florence where their restoration had
been completed, the statues were installed in their
permanent home at the Magna Graecia Museum of
Reggio di Calabria. Crowds of visitors flock to see
them daily, including thousands of tourists from
Pompeii and the Gulf of Salerno who cross the wild
and beautiful hills of Calabria to catch a glimpse of
the Riace warriors, while television teams from
Europe, America and Japan have travelled to Reggio
to film these masterpieces of ancient art.
Seven years elapsed between the discovery of the
statues by Mariottini and the day they were exhibited ^
in public for the first time, for their restoration had f

^ proved a laborious task calling for extreme care and
long and patient efforts.
The early cleaning operations carried out at the
National Museum in Reggio di Calabria had taken
two years. From there, the bronzes were sent to the
Antiquities Restoration Centre of Tuscany in
Florence where they underwent a very thorough ex¬
amination using gamma ray equipment. A complete
X-ray picture of the statues was built up, for it was
important to know their internal structure and the
thickness of the various parts in order to choose ap¬
propriate restoration materials and tools. Defects in
the metal casting had to be discovered, as well as the
state of preservation of the less visible parts.
The X-ray pictures also provided important data on
the alloys used in the fifth century BC, and on
ancient metallurgy in general.
As to the statues themselves, it was established
with certainty that the right arm of the warrior wear¬
ing a helmet was not part of the original cast: it had
been soldered on to the statues at a later date to
replace an arm accidentally destroyed or damaged
possibly during an earthquake.
Following the X-ray examination, the statues
underwent further very meticulous cleaning opera¬
tion. Scalpels, percussion tools, compressed air and
even ultrasonic techniques were all used in turn to
clean the more inaccessible parts, such as the
crevices in the warriors' beards.
The work was handled with such care that it has
been possible on very limited surfaces to expose the
original patina. This opens an important field for ar¬
chaeological research and the exposed parts had to
be carefully protected.
Research has also revealed that metals other than
bronze were used for certain parts of the statues.
The teeth of the long-haired warrior are in silver, and
the eyes of both figures are outlined in silver, while
their lips and hair are of copper. Ivory was used for
the white of the eyes, and frit and amber for the iris.
Other examinations showed that the inside of the
bronzes, which had been inaccessible when they
were first cleaned, contained burrs of castings mixed
with silt and sand that had seeped in during the
statues' long stay under water. These humid
substances were dangerous deteriorating agents and
had to be eliminated. But to do this the lead pins had
first to be removed with extreme care so as to avoid
damaging the feet, not to mention the pins which are
themselves of considerable archaeological interest.
Cleaning the inside of the statues proved to be one
of the most delicate parts of the whole restoration
process. Instruments were specially made for the
purpose, including optical apparatus enabling the ex¬
perts to follow each stage of the operation second by
second, and mechanical and hydraulic instruments
capable of softening hard substances and of extrac¬
ting them.
Two more years of research proved necessary
before every tiny spot of corrosion could be located
and eliminated.. But the Riace warriors have now
been given a clean bill of health and are ready to face
the coming centuries. Restorers, however, advise
against any further travelling: they fear possible ac¬
cidents during transport or damage caused by vari¬
ations in temperature and humidity.
After 2,500 years of wandering, the bronze war¬
riors have at last found a permanent home in
Calabria, not far from Greece where they were born.

The golden age
of classical Greek art
Every detail of the Riace bronzes reveals the degree of mastery attained by
Greek art in the 5th century BC. Above, the head of the long-haired "Young
Warrior". Below, the feet on which he stands with perfect poise. Right, the
hand that held the spear. Using the latest techniques, Italian restorers spent
seven years bringing the bronzes back to life. Not a square centimetre of
the warriors' bodies, inside as well as out, escaped their meticulous
scrutiny. The research has yielded important data on ancient techniques of
casting and statuary and on the metallurgy of bronze.

In 1965, ten years after the death of
Teilhard and Albert Einstein, Unesco
organized an international symposium as
a joint tribute to two men who were so
different In so many respects, but whose
thinking was so profound and universal.
In September 1981, to mark the
centenary of Teilhard de Chardin's birth,
forty specialists in various disciplines of
the exact and human sciences attended a
symposium on Teilhard's work, held at
Unesco headquarters In Paris. On the
following pages the Unesco Courier
presents extracts from some of the con¬
tributions to the symposium in which
scholars from every continent took part.

TEILHARD DE CHARDIN
philosopher, palaeontologist, theologian
O
A bold vision
of the universe
by François Russo
PIERRE Teilhard de Chardin, the
theologian, philosopher and
scholar, whose thinking and
work have made a valuable contribution
to religious, philosophical and scientific
thinking by suggesting an outline for a
civilization of the Universal... It was in
these terms that Unesco's General Con¬
ference in Belgrade in 1980 expressed
its unanimous decision to celebrate in
1981 the centenary of Teilhard's birth.
In accordance with the wish of the
General Conference, an international
symposium on Teilhard's life and work
was held at Unesco Headquarters in
Paris in September 1981. It was attend¬
ed by some forty palaeontologists,
specialists in prehistory, ethnologists,
philosophers and theologians, who had
come from eighteen countries and
every continent. The Director-General
of Unesco, Mr. Amadou-Mahtar M'Bow,
and the President of France, Mr. Fran¬
cois Mitterrand, each gave an address
at the closing session.
FRANÇOIS RUSSO, philosopher and historian
of science, is adviser to the International Catholic
Centre of Unesco, in Paris.
Such a tribute may have caused sur¬
prise in some quarters. Although the
scientific work of Pierre Teilhard de
Chardin may still have the esteem of
palaeontologists and prehistoria ns,
among scientists working in other
disciplines it is far from being so well
known and appreciated, and the
general public is even less familiar with
it. As for his philosophical and religious
thinking, it seemed to have faded into a
certain obscurity, after arousing wide
interest and enthusiasm during the
decade following his death (the Roman
Catholic authorities did not authorize
the publication of his writings in these
fields during his lifetime).
The Unesco symposium showed that
Teilhard's personality and the various
aspects of his thought still command
the attention of noted specialists, even
if many of them do not share his
religious convictions.
Pierre Teilhard de Chardin was born
in Auvergne, France, on1 May 1881, in¬
to a well-do-do Christian family.
Nothing in his childhood, save an early
fascination with rocks and minerals,
foretold that he would become a man of
grand perspectives and an indefatigable
explorer, enthralled both by the future
and by the past of the world and
mankind.
In 1899, he joined the Jesuit
novitiate. His years of religious training,
begun in France, took him to the British
island of Jersey where he became in¬
terested in mineralogy and geology
while still pursuing his philosophical
studies. Next they took him to Egypt,
where he taught physics at the College
of the Holy Family in Cairo and confirm¬
ed his taste for the earth sciences, and
then to Hastings in England, where he
devoted his leisure hours from theology
to palaeontology.
However, it was not until 1912 that
he really embarked on his scientific
career. At the Museum of Natural
History in Paris, he met Marcellin
Boule, famous for his work on the
Neanderthal skeleton from La Chapelle-
aux-Saints in France. Then came the
war, in which Teilhard served as a
stretcher-bearer from 1914-1919. Dur¬
ing this period he wrote the essays
which were later collected and publish¬
ed under the title Écrits du Temps de la
Guerre (Wartime Essays). ~
With the coming of peace, he return¬
ed to his work in Paris at both the v

, worked notably with a young student
named Jean Piveteau, now a member
of the French Academy of Sciences,
and at the Institute of Human Palaeon¬
tology, where he made the acquain¬
tance of Abbé Henri Breuil, whose
discoveries, especially in the field of
prehistoric art, would become widely
known.
In 1922, Teilhard submitted his doc¬
toral thesis on "mammals of the French
early Eocene". The year 1923 was of
decisive importance for his scientific
career, for it was then that he visited
China for the first time. He remained
there until 1946, returning to France
several times for short visits and under¬
taking missions to Ethiopia and Somalia
in 1928-1929, and later to India, Burma,
and Indonesia.
Teilhard returned to France in 1946,
and the following year was offered a
chair at the Collège de France, which
his religious superiors, uneasy about his
audacious views, forbade him to ac¬
cept. For the same reasons he was ask¬
ed to leave Paris in 1951. He settled in
New York where the Wenner Gren
Foundation for Anthropological
Research sent him on two short, but
important, missions to southern Africa
in 1951 and 1953. Teilhard died in New
York, on Easter Sunday, 10 April 1955.
Teilhard de Chardin's scientific work,
published in eleven volumes, comprises
over 4,000 pages. No matter how
unified his thought may be, his scien¬
tific work was not in any way "cor¬
rupted" by his religious and
philosophical views, although it was
nourished by them. It forms a clearly
autonomous unit in his work as a
whole.
Although Teilhard's scientific interest
primarily concerned the origins of man,
this subject occupies only a small frac¬
tion of his scientific writings, which are
devoted primarily to the geology of
China and, to a lesser degree, of other
parts of Asia. There are two reasons for
this. First, Teilhard understood very
early on that a convincing explanation
of the origins of man presupposed a

tombs of the emperors of the Ming dynasty which ruled China from
the 14th to the 17th century. 1935 was also the year of Teilhard's first
visit to Java and the sites where specimens of Pithecanthropus
(Java Man), had been discovered.
A coherent picture of the world
Teilhard anticipated the research of science which attempts to bring
together in a single whole the laws of the infinitely great and the infinitely
small...
According to Teilhard, an ¡mage of the whole world could be arrived at as
the result of a complete system of knowledge in which Man occupies the
principal place. "True Physics", he wrote, "is that which will one day suc¬
ceed in including Man in his totality in a coherent picture of the world." Our
epoch is that of a great synthetizing of knowledge and of philosophical
debates on the "anthropologization" of the sciences, and at such a moment
such an approach seems particularly necessary and precious.

geological investigation carried out in
great detail. Second, when appointed
to the Chinese Geological Service in
1929 Teilhard was called to undertake
numerous geological missions in almost
all the regions of China along with his
compatriot Father Emile Licent, a
number of Chinese geologists, and
other scientists from Europe and
America. In particular, he was a
member of the Chinese branch of the
French Haardt-Citroën expedition in
1931-1932.
Teilhard was also to play an impor¬
tant role in the excavations at the
famous site of Chou-K'ou-tien near
Peking. If he did not discover in China,

or Sinanthropus, the stage in the evolu¬
tion of man which preceded Homo sa¬
piens, he was one of the principal
organizers of the team which explored
the site for more than ten years and
made a noteworthy contribution to the
proof that Sinanthropus knew of fire
and could make tools.
Although less exhaustive, Teilhard's
work on human palaeontology in the
south and east of Africa also deserves
consideration. Teilhard anticipated the
belief that greater efforts in the search
for the origins of man should be con¬
centrated in these regions where
outstanding discoveries have been
made since the beginning of the 1960s
in connexion with the first hominids,
Australopithecus and Homo habilis,
which could be the ancestor of Homo
erectus.
What distinguishes Teilhard from the
majority of the great scientists of our
era is that he wished, without in any
way impairing his scientific work, to be
more than a scientist in the strict sense
of the term. It was not that he under¬
rated science; on the contrary, no one
more than he has proclaimed its full
scope and significance. But he was cer¬
tain, nonetheless, that what he had to
say went further than science.
Moreover, he intended to conduct in¬
vestigations into the Totality of the
Universe, of Man and of Humanity from
an evolutionary and dynamic viewpoint,
proposing to study not only their past,
but their future in the light of their past.
His message is marked by so pervasive
a concern for synthesis and unity, that,
as Mr. Amadou-Mahtar M'Bow noted
at the Unesco symposium, "his
thought, like a musical composition,
cannot be understood in fragments".
However, to explain it, it must be divid¬
ed into certain major theses, distinct,
but closely interrelated.
These theses may be grouped into
two categories, although Teilhard
himself never presented them in this
way. The first category consists of
those views directly linked to science,
more exactly, to palaeontology and the
theory of evolution. The second con¬
sists of ideas further from science
which issue especially from his
philosophy and Christian faith.
The awakening planetary consciousness
According to Teilhard de Chardin, the human community is undergoing a
radical transformation of consciousness. We are evolving from a state of
tribal-national awareness to global consciousness. Through a process which
he calls "planetization", the forces of evolution have shifted from
divergence to convergence. When mankind first appeared on the earth,
groups diverged into separate tribal units. However, the spherical shape of
the earth, the increase in population and the rapid development of com¬
munication in recent times have caused consciousness to converge and in¬
tensify. Out of this process, global consciousness is emerging...
Teilhard's concept of religion helps us understand the religious
phenomenon of our times in both its ecumenical and secularizing trends. His
concepts of the convergence and complexification of consciousness clarify
the meeting of religions. His understanding of the spiritual power of matter
makes it possible to see the process of secularization in a spiritual light. Yet
his thought is not merely a harmonious synthesis to be admired at leisure,
but the call of a prophet ringing out across the future, challenging the
religions to be active forces in our time to harness and direct human energies
at this critical moment in history: so that the secular will reach fruition in the
spiritual and the spiritual wiil encompass and activate the energies of the
secular. It is in this sense that Teilhard's thought has had and, I believe, will
continue to have an impact on the religious consciousness of the twentieth
century.
Ewert H. Cousins
Philosopher, Fordham University, New York
(Extract from an address given at the Unesco symposium
16-18 September, 1981)
Among the theses in the first
category there is, first of all, the law of
complexity-consciousness, which had
been sketched out before him, but
which he expounded in its full scope.
According to this, the course of evolu¬
tion offers us two intimately related,
parallel forms of growth, one in com¬
plexity, especially of the nervous
system and the brain, the other in the
psyche and consciousness.
This law, fundamental for Teilhard,
hardly goes beyond science in the strict
sense. Is it not remarkable, as the
Unesco symposium clearly demon¬
strated, that this law is almost
unanimously acknowledged today by all
those who seek to understand the
process of evolution, no matter what
their philosophical and religious
convictions?
More personal, less commonly ac¬
cepted, although rooted in the direct
extension of the law of complexity-
consciousness, is Teilhard's basic view
that the appearance of life is not an ac-
Science and technology the new factor
Teilhard de Chardin was one of the earliest thinkers in the West to realize
that modern science and technology are not just an extension of the old
tradition, but represent an entirely new factor in the universalization of
mankind which no creative theologian could afford to ignore.

cident, an anomaly, but the result of an
inevitable process, the ascent of the
Spirit crowned by the appearance of
man. Evolution, which had formerly
moved along diverging paths, began to
converge toward man, its final blos¬
som. Teilhard summarizes this view in
his great work Le Phénomène humain
(The Phenomenon of Man), as follows:
"The centre of perspective, Man is at
the same time the centre of construc¬
tion of the Universe".
Another of Teilhard's ideas, closely
linked to science but going further than
it, specifies the nature of the evolutio¬
nary process. This process is a con¬
stant progression, but with critical
points or thresholds such as the pas¬
sage from matter into life, the birth of
reflexion linked to hominization. Here
Teilhard went along with the formula of
Julian Huxley, the distinguished British
biologist who was Unesco's first
Director-General: "The appearance of
man is evolution become conscious of
itself".
Another threshold brings us to the
second category of Teilhard's major
ideas, those which are less directly, if at
all, related to science, and concern the
spreading of Humanity all over the
earth. This process is undoubtedly a
fact, but from it Teilhard draws con¬
sequences for the future of Humanity
which go far beyond this simple fact.
This point is demonstrated by the
way Teilhard develops his major views
on the future of Humanity "taken in the
mass". He does not tell us what will
necessarily happen, but under what
conditions Humanity can be "saved".

^ Humanity is free to submit to them, but
there is no guarantee that it will avoid
catastrophe: "There is no summit
without an abyss", he writes.
Those conditions, which he believes
that all men no matter what their con¬
victions must recognize as the sole path
to the true fulfilment of Humanity, are
found essentially in the idea of con¬
vergence. Humanity unites not like ants
in an ant hill, but in a union in which
people are not uniform, much less
crushed, but attain their full develop¬
ment, each with his or her own
originality and specific vocation. In his
famous phrase union differentiates,
Teilhard summarizes this view which
implies that by going beyond the
horizons of religions, which he con¬
siders too constricting, we work for the
realization of universal love love of the
earth, love of great human enterprises,
which he styles as "faith in man"; love
which should unite all man by guiding
them toward a "supreme Someone".
Teilhard puts the progress of
knowledge, the sciences, in the
forefront of these human enterprises.
More than most contemporary scien¬
tists, he recognized the full significance
and value of research. The pursuit of
knowledge is far more than a game, far
more than a search with utilitarian aims.
In giving himself to science, man must
aspire "to know in order to be more".
Although religions, even the Chris¬
tianity which was his own faith, still
often show little interest in science,
because they underestimate it or even
fear that it may do them harm, Teilhard
believed that religions should co¬
operate with science and that only thus
would Humanity find true unity.
Even if at one point in his life Teilhard
believed that the major world religions
did not attach as much importance to
this question as he would have wished,
in his later writings he fully appreciated
what each of them could contribute to
convergence, union, and the spiritua-
lization of Humanity. Seeing Humanity
as destined to converge towards unity,
Teilhard formulated the concept of
what he called the Omega point, a point
of ultimate convergence marking the
final perfection of Humanity.
At first Teilhard presented this
Omega point as an idea arising out of
pure philosophic deduction. It was only
later, realizing that only Christians were
following him, that he affirmed, without
confusing them, the junction of the
Omega point and Christ. The universal
Christ embraces all things, gives them
their full content, and is alone capable
of uniting them in a love of which he is
the true source.
It is not hard to understand why the
ideas in this second category, the
specifically religious concepts con¬
sidered above, have not convinced
everyone, far-reaching as they are.
28
Moreover, although Teilhard was
concerned with the future of Humanity,
it may seem surprising that he gave so
little consideration to art or culture, to
political realities such as the State and
nation, and more seriously, to human
malice, to the problem of Evil, the im¬
portance of which he minimized and the
origins of which he insufficiently ex¬
plored. But do not all great thinkers
have their weaknesses?
However lyrical Teilhard's philoso¬
phical and religious writings may be,
they are with rare exceptions of a high
intellectual quality. But Teilhard was
not a pure technician of thought. No
matter how valid his thinking may be,
he developed it to serve a course of ac¬
tion, the complete and genuine fulfil¬
ment of Humanity.
This accounts for the warmth, for the
occasional vehemence, of what he has
to say. He undoubtedly wished to con¬
struct a synthesis, but above all he
wanted to say what he had "seen" and,
in his own words, "to express fervent
views". These views have had their im¬
pact on so many different minds,
cultures and convictions.

The indefatigable globe-trotter
Throughout his life Teilhard travelled, with little respite, through Asia, Africa, America and
Europe In a passionate quest for material to help him develop his bold synthesis of the
evolution of man and the universe since earliest times. Except during wartime, he rarely
spent more than two years at a time on the same continent. In 1931, after returning from
the United States, he took part as a geologist in the French Haardt-Citroën expedition, a
motorized trek which in the face of extreme difficulties opened up a route through Asia
from Beirut to Peking. For six months Teilhard travelled through northern China (top
photo, the expedition makes Its way through the Toksum Pass; above, in the Gobi desert).

RESEARCH:
A VITAL
HUMAN
ACTIVITY
"Not so long ago, those engaged in research
were the 'odd' and the unusual; few in
number, they were generally considered ex¬
ceptional individuals, in short, 'eccentrics'. To¬
day, research workers number millions and
these 'organized millions' cover almost every
conceivable sphere of activity. In terms of
numbers employed, in terms of money in¬
vested, in terms of energy expended, research
is tending increasingly to become the major
concern of the world. From being a luxury or a
diversion, it has moved to the noble status of
a vital human activ'rty-just as vital, in fact, as
nutrition and reproduction! Our epoch is often
described in terms of the rise of the masses. It
could just as easily (and, in effect, the two
events are basically compatible) be characteriz¬
ed in terms of the rise of research...
"If research occupies an increasingly large
place in human activity, it is not the result of a
whim, fashion, or chance, but simply because
man, in becoming adult, is irresistibly driven to
take responsibility for the evolution of life on
earth and because research is the very expres¬
sion (in a considered state) of this evolutionary
effort not only to subsist, but to 'be' more ful¬
ly, not only to survive, but to go beyond mere
survival towards 'higher' life in an irreversible
way."

History under the geologist's hammer
Early in his career, Teilhard realised that a far-reaching geological
investigation was indispensable to any inquiry Into the origins of man.
He rarely travelled without his geologist's hammer (above, Teilhard in
northern China in 1932). As an adviser to the Chinese National Geological
Service, he for many years took an active part in the excavations at
Chou-K'ou-tlen near Peking (photo far right, taken in 1929), which led to
the major discovery of Sinanthropus (Peking Man). Right, Teilhard with
some of his colleagues, the Chinese geologists Pei Wen Chung and C.C.
Young, Davidson Black of Canada, and George Barbour of the U.K.
"Whenever we visit sites where Teilhard de Chardin worked, we refer to
his studies and we cannot fail to be impressed by his spirit of
abnegation, his sense of anticipation and the quality of his contributions
to Chinese studies." This tribute to Teilhard de Chardin was made at the
Unesco symposium in September 1981 by Zhu Ming Zhen and Li Yan
Xian of the Peking Institute of vertebrate palaeontology and
paleoanthropology.

o
THE TEILHARD PHENOMENON
by Yves Coppens
IN the present state of our knowledge of
general palaeontology it seems surpris¬
ing that Africa was not at once iden¬
tified as the only part of the world where
there was a prospect of finding the first
traces of the human species."
These were the extraordinarily prescient
words used by Pierre Teilhard de Chardin in
New York in September 1954.
Less than five years later the greatest
palaeontological adventure of all time was to
start in East Africa: along a 2,000-kilometre-
long fault, where sediment had been trap¬
ped and built up, eight major international
expeditions or more than 500 people were
over fifteen years to collect hundreds of
thousands of fossil bones, including hun¬
dreds of hominid remains. The history of the
human species was thus pushed far back in
time: we now speak in terms of four million
years for man, three million for the first
stone tools, nearly two million for the first
building and 1.5 million years for the first
rites.
I cannot help thinking what intense
pleasure it would have given Pierre Teilhard
de Chardin to have lived through this quite
recent period.
The reason why I begin with this pro¬
phetic quotation, and a brief summary of
what we have discovered and learnt since
Father Teilhard de Chardin's death, is to link
the world of learning of the 1950s with that
of today. But it is also by way of a reminder
that Pierre Teilhard de Chardin was first and
foremost a palaeontologist.
Pierre Teilhard de Chardin's passion for
palaeontology was sparked on the day when
he first met Marcellin Boule, Professor of
Palaeontology at the Museum of Natural
History in Paris.
"Do you remember our first interview,
some time around the middle of July,
1912?" he once wrote to Marcellin Boule.
"On that day, about two o'clock I knocked
timidly on the door of the laboratory on the
Place Valhubert which I have so often walk¬
ed through since. It was your last precious
evening before you went on holiday, and
you were very busy. But you saw me all the
same and suggested that I should come and
work with you at your school, the Ecole de
Gaudry. That was how, in a matter of five
minutes, I embarked on what has been my
life ever since, namely research and adven¬
ture in human palaeontology. Never, I
believe, did Providence play such a key role
in my life..."
For eleven years, Pierre Teilhard de Char-
din assiduously haunted the famous collec¬
tions of the Institute of Palaeontology at the
Museum.
Although his departure for China in 1923
marked the beginning of long spells abroad
and of much travelling all over the world,
this very active life never prevented him,
every time he was in Paris, coming back to
work in this great institution at the Jardin
des Plantes where, at the age of thirty-one,
he had been "bowled over by fossils".
Thus in addition to his life as a thinker and
writer, and as a priest, Pierre Teilhard de
Chardin led a full life as a palaeontologist.
His output of scientific work was that of an
excellent research worker, as if he had done
nothing else in his life: from five or six to
twelve or thirteen articles or papers a year,
or a total of over 250 titles in some forty
years of research.
This scientific work illustrates the way in
which palaeontology commonly runs into
geology at one end (since you must start
with the matrix in order to understand where
fossils come from) and into prehistory at the
other (since all through time and its deposits
the quest, consciously or otherwise, is for
Man).
Pierre Teilhard de Chardin was so well
aware of this that the first research institute
he founded in Peking in 1940 with Father
Leroy, was the one he called the Institute of
Geobiology (Earth and Life).
From 1929 onward he closely followed
most major work in human palaeontology.
During his long stays in China, for instance,
he took part with Davidson Black, George
Barbour, C.C. Young and Pei Wen Chung in
the excavation of the famous Chou Kou
Tien deposit near Peking, and also with
Franz Weidenreich in the study of Sinan¬
thropus remains. He also went to Java in
1935 and 1938 to visit the famous Pithecan¬
thropus sites at Trinil and Sangiran with
Ralph von Koenigswald. Then he went, also,
on two occasions, in 1951 and 1953, to
study the Australopithecus caves in South

A NEW GENERATION OF TURKISH WOMEN
CONTINUED FROM PAGE 17
November 19th. Went to the grocer's to
buy a can of paraffin. "
The author then intertwines descrip¬
tions of how this peculiar needle works
its way through Bilal's body with the
triviality of daily events like the eternal
buying of cans of paraffin and the
calculation of the distance between
Bilal's house and those of the people he
knows.
"Today, Monday 30th June, 1931, at
two o'clock, the needle started to move
again, towards my back... At about six
it came to a halt and so did the pain. I
went out and walked to the house of
Anastasia, the midwife. I make the
distance between my front door and the
door ofAnastasia the midwife 63 of my
own paces. . . "
The needle's stealthy progress, the
various pains it causes and the constant
buying of cans of paraffin produce a ris¬
ing frenzy, yet daily life goes on, as flat
as ever. "The needle has started going
towards my heart. Realizing that it
would reach my heart, I began to walk
southward. In this direction, the garden
walls, the garden gates, the distance
along the walls of the houses, the
single-width doors, the pine-trees, the
woodwork, the stretch of houses and
the length of the street totalled
604 feet".
Gradually the end approaches. Under
the inexorable threat of the needle, Bilal
finally sets fire to the four hundred cans
of paraffin he has stored away in the
cellar. Everyone, relatives and
neighbours, goes up in flames with the
house. No-one really knows whether
the fire started in the cellar or not, and
anyway what does it matter? For fire
breaks out where it was not expected:
"The door-bell rang... Zembul rushed
to answer it; in her hands, too, she was
holding flames." An ending in which
nothing is explained but which, with the
almost epic density of its presentation,
exercises an extraordinary fascination.
It can be seen from these quotations
that some women practise a type .of
writing in which escape into the im¬
agination and dream-fantasy compen¬
sates for the dreadful monotony of life,
using a system of mirrors to conjure up
a reversed ¡mage of reality.
But there are other women who
grasp reality with both hands, yet still
display rare poetic sensibility. Social
reality is discreetly but clearly present in
the stories of Furuzan, Adalet Agaoglu,
Sevgi Soysal, Nezihe Meriç, Tomris
Uyar and many others...
Already in 1951 Nezihe Meriç was
breaking away from conventional nar
rative. Her first stories and subse¬
quent ones did not have plots, but
they re-created moods and poetic
moments. She has a gift for capturing
those fleeting instants in which the
essence of life can be experienced with
quivering intensity.
The distinguishing mark of Furuzan,
ever since her first collections of stories
came out in 1971, has been the quality
of her style. Her tales, some of them
verging on melodrama, are about the
lives of rich peasants in the south; she is
interested in the aimless existence of
characters who are looked upon as
"social problems": orphan girls,
deserted wives, soft-hearted pro¬
stitutes, homesick emigrants from
remote parts of the Ottoman Empire,
wretched skivvies, caretakers of
decrepit mansions owned by
unscrupulous masters.
But the writer's sensibility and her
desire to re-create the real, deep life of
her homeland dominate all: "In the
country, the days had grown shorter.
The apricots had been spread out to
dry. Some of the fruit on the mulberry-
tree was as black as sloes. In the kit¬
chen, the smell of food reminded one of
peppery 'tarhana' soups. Now the sleek
red tomatoes and shiny pimentos for
stuffing had lost their flavour. The old
THE TEILHARD PHENOMENON
Africa under the leadership of Revil Mason,
Van Riet Lowe and John Robinson.
Prehistoric industries were also part of
Father Teilhard's field of interest. When
prospecting for fossils, he was also looking
for traces of Man: in this way he came to
discover many Palaeolithic and Neolithic
sites in China, India, Burma, at Djibouti and
in Ethiopia, to visit many others and to make
attempts at synthesis.
In geology he produced many very impor¬
tant pieces of work. It is very evident that
Teilhard insisted on making a fundamental
study of the structure of a deposit before
starting to collect. I think he must have writ¬
ten on the geology of all the sites he had oc¬
casion to study or visit from Jersey to Java,
and of course throughout China.
What emerges from this considerable
volume of scientific work, which never¬
theless represents only .part of Pierre
Teilhard de Chardin's output and thought?
First, it is obviously work in subjects dealing
with the past palaeontology, geology and
prehistory.
It is also field work. Teilhard travelled the
world with his geological hammer in his
hand, rushing off the moment an outcrop
appeared which revealed the deep structure
of the earth, undismayed by distances,
32
climates or people. Struck down by a
myocardial infarction in 1947, he wrote, "On
the morning... of 1 June, heart attack...
Then a spell in hospital... And a turning-
point in my life. Compulsory abandonment
of the great life in the field. Today, at this
very moment, I should be in the plane to
Johannesburg..."
Next, it is synthetical in approach, at
every level. Each chance find, each analysis
of a phenomenon, a fossil or a prehistoric
object, was an excuse to write a comprehen¬
sive study on the problem in question.
Moreover at another level Pierre Teilhard de
Chardin was obviously a past master at link¬
ing his geological studies with his work on
the content of the strata studied, the fossils
and the flints. At yet another level one of the
original features of Teilhard's thought was
that he saw Man and Life in their earthly and
cosmic contexts, and hence could relate ap¬
parently isolated phenomena to the general
evolution of the Universe.
Then again it is international, or perhaps
cosmopolitan, in character. Not so much in
its subject-matter (which is nothing if not
universal) as in the way it was approached
and carried out. Pierre Teilhard de Chardin
worked in Europe, Asia, Africa and America.
He lived for nearly twenty years in China,
and collaborated a great deal with C.C.
Young, Pei Wen Chung, Yang Kieh and
H.C. Chang. He lived in the United States
and was a research associate at the Wenner-
Gren Foundation for Anthropological
Research.
Lastly, allow me to recall another feature
of Pierre Teilhard de Chardin's work which is
unusual and yet not negligible, namely his
scientific poetry.
"Some thousands of millions of years
ago, not, it would appear, by regular pro¬
cess of astral evolution, but as the result of
some unbelievable accident (a brush with
another star? an internal upheaval?) a frag¬
ment of matter composed of particularly
stable atoms was detached from the surface
of the sun. Without breaking the bonds at¬
taching it to the rest, and just at the right
distance from the mother-star to receive a
moderate radiation, this fragment began to
condense, to roll itself up, to take shape..."
And on the origin of Man, "With
hominization, in spite of the insignificance
of the anatomical leap, we have the beginn¬
ing of a new age. The earth 'gets a new
skin'... Man came silently into the world".
H Yves Coppens

<![CDATA[
lady of the house, sprightly as a young
girl, but small and wizened, was putting
the bedclothes away in cupboards built
into the walls. She placed muslin
lavender-bags between the sheets. The
house was getting ready for another
summer, with the clean, scoured torpor
of a Turkish bath. Fuchsias, begonias
and stonecrop stood in a row by the
window in the passage. "
This "lady" had been no such thing
when she was merely servant to the rich
landowner whom later, after his wife
died, she finally married. Told in the
first person by the maid turned mistress
on the death of her husband, the story
uncovers the psychology of a woman,
once downtrodden herself, who now
rules her servants with a rod of iron.
She has got what she wanted, but she
is not safe from misfortune. Vedat, the
youngest of her three sons, is a rebel.
"The harm that has befallen my son is
worse than the pain of love. Why didn't
we teach him to be like other people?
My Vedat is going to his ruin for
nothing. For nothing. "
Her eldest son arrives during the
night on the train from Ankara, and tells
her that Vedat, the student, has been
arrested. The mother collapses on to
the divan covered in its white dust-
sheet. She feels a sudden pain in her
stomach. "Shall we go to my son
tonight?, she thought. We could hire
Omer's taxi, though it is as much as
Omer's taxi can do to get as fat as Six
Willows... Suddenly she realized that
they could go nowhere that night. "
In most of Furuzan's stories, as in
those of other Turkish women novelists
today, there is no proper ending. Reali¬
ty acquires its full meaning in bits and
pieces, by the assembling of small in¬
dividual facts.
Lie Down to Die is a novel by Adalet
Agaoglu published in 1973. It describes
different facets of the evolution of
Turkish society between 1938 and 1968.
The author pursues a relentless quest
for the identity of the Turkish female in¬
tellectual. "Atatürk died in 1938",
Adalet Agaoglu wrote in the preface to
her first novel. "Within the limits of his
powers and in a precise situation,
Atatürk showed Turkey how to go
about taking her place among the coun¬
tries of the developed world. He died in
1938. What happened then? What kind
of education was received by the peo¬
ple who finished primary school in the
year of his death? The first or second
generation of recruits in the literacy
campaign! What was the world situa¬
tion, what was Turkey's situation,
when they were at the learning stage?
What did they know about that period
of rapid mutations?"
The principal female character in
Agaoglu's novel breaks cynically
through all the prohibitions that have
oppressed women for centuries, yet she
still retains a feeling of guilt. Adalet
Agaoglu, like Leyla Erbil, wants to
define her position in relation to the old
beliefs and the old taboos, in relation to
men, in fact, within a society where
tradition is in conflict with modernity
and all its challenges.
So it is the transformation of Turkish
society under the impact of progress
and republican reforms that provides
women as well as men with raw
material for the novel. But women have
a direct knowledge of their problems
and can reproduce this knowledge with
all its nuances, speaking as it were for
all those other women who are not
lucky enough to be able to liberate
themselves, even through writing.
In present-day Turkey no one can
escape the burning political and social
problems of the age. Sevgi Soysal, who
died at the height of her powers, came
to fame with a marvellous short novel
entitled Aunt Rosa, the story of an ec¬
centric old lady who lives on two levels,
so that humdrum reality mingles with
the magic of fancy.
Around 1972 Sevgi Soysal set down
in masterly fashion her observations on
the world of prison. With perfect insight
and frankness she describes the abyss
that separates a peasant woman who
has nothing in the world, but who lives
her life, in spite of her crime, in a sort of
innocence, and a political militant, con¬
scious that any communication bet¬
ween them is impossible; each of the
women exists alone in her only discerni¬
ble reality.
The lucidity shown by Turkish
women is proof of their entitlement to
their place in the world of art a world
which is neither masculine nor
feminine and a most convincing re¬
affirmation of an intelligence and a
sensibility that have never faltered.
The 1950-1980 generation of women
writers was preceded by other talented
authors. Among these, the prestigious
name of Halidé Edip Adivar
(1884-1964), who fought beside Atatürk
in the armed struggle, occupies an im¬
portant place in Turkish literary history.
But the real artistic flowering of
women sprang from an ideological and
practical determination that originated
with Mustafa Kemal Atatürk. The laws
giving women the right to vote (much
earlier than in many other countries),
the modern civil code and the
numerous educational reforms design¬
ed to help women to catch up with men
in the field of cultureall these made
the feminine renaissance possible.
But Atatürk's campaign in this sphere
was essentially a defence of Turkish
women's fundamental role, a radical
change of attitude away from the old
patriarchal tradition.
As soon as the country had been
liberated and the Republic proclaimed
in 1923, the problem was brought out
into the open. "To live is to function",
Atatürk declared; "therefore if one
organ of a society functions while the
other is inert, that society is paralysed.
One of the urgent needs of our time is
to ensure the rehabilitation of women in
all spheres. "(1).
Addressing a crowd in the little
Anatolian town of Kastamonu, on 27
August 1925, Atatürk stressed again
the need to do away with antiquated
customs. "In my travels, not only in the
villages but in the towns and cities too, I
have seen our womenfolk carefully con¬
cealing their face and eyes. Now, my
male comrades, this is partly the result
of our selfishness. "
Still on the subject of Turkish
women. President Atatürk concluded:
"Let them show their faces to the world
and let them contemplate that world
with their own eyes: there is nothing to
fear. "
The new generation of Turkish
women writers are turning his message
into a reality. They are showing their
faces to the world, and they are gazing
on the world "with their own eyes".

Unesco medal marks
TEILHARD DE CHARDIN
centenary
To mark the centenary of the birth
of the French theologian,
philosopher and palaeontologist
Pierre Teilhard de Chardin, Unesco
is issuing a commemorative medal in
gold, silver and bronze. The medal
was designed by the French artist
Paul Belmondo and struck at the
Paris Mint. The obverse side shows
a portrait of Teilhard de Chardin,
and the reverse a map of the world
with, in its centre, the Greek letter
"omega" which, for the philo¬
sopher, was the convergence point
of the earth's evolution.
The inscription on the reverse
side, La compréhension et le respect
sacré de l'humain (Understanding
and respect for all that is human), is
taken from a letter written by
Teilhard de Chardin to Father
Auguste Valensin in February 1928.

medal issue, please write to:

gramme, Unesco, 7, place de
Fontenoy, 75700 Paris (France).
Myths about cancer
According to the World Health Organiza¬
tion, two myths about cancer need to be
dispelled: one is that cancer is unavoidable,
and the other that it is essentially a disease
of the industrialized countries. Contrary to a
common belief, most of the 37 million peo¬
ple suffering from cancer today live in the
developing world. Each year, five million
new cases are recorded in these countries
against three million in the industrialized
countries. Cancer remains one of the three
main causes of death throughout the world,
and, despite progress made by research,
practice often lags behind theory, especially
in the Third World: prevention measures are
not applied properly and many cancer
patients lack adequate treatment or pain¬
killers.
'The ABC of Copyright'
A booklet just published by Unesco explains
in terms accessible to the layman various
questions concerning copyright. The work.
The ABC of Copyright (73 pp. 20 F), gives a
thumbnail sketch of copyright history,
presents various concepts of national
legislation, and examines such issues as the
moral and economic rights of authors. One
chapter deals with the international dimen¬
sions of copyright protection, particularly
with the Universal Convention administered
by Unesco, and another with copyright in
developing countries.
Jan van Rusbrock (1293-1381)
Six hundred years ago, the theologian
and mystic Jan van Rusbrock, known as
"the Peerless", died at the age of 88 at
Groenendal Abbey in what is today
Belgium. This monastic community
devoted to meditation, of which van
Rusbrock was the first abbot, had a wide
reputation. Van Rusbrock himself exer¬
cised far-reaching influence through his-
writings which, by the nobility of their
style and thought, rank among the great
literary works of the Dutch language.
They have been translated into many
languages and their impact has been felt
far beyond the borders of Belgium,
where van Rusbrock's memory con¬
tinues to be cherished.

Buy a card and help a child
Hundreds of millions of children throughout the developing world suffer from depriva¬
tion. They are hungry and lack schools and medical supplies. By purchasing the greetings
cards issued by UNICEF the United Nations Children's Fund each of us can help these
children. One quarter of UNICEF's resources are provided by voluntary contributions. In
1979, 106 million cards were sold. The cards, as well as useful presents such as engagement
diaries and games, are available from UNICEF sales points throughout the world.
Picasso's Child with Dove (left) reproduced by courtesy of the National Gallery, London,
is one of sixty reproductions offered by museums and artists in many countries' that are in¬
cluded in this year's greetings cards series.
The UNICEF 1982 engagement diary is illustrated by 67 photos in colour and black and
white on the theme "Fathers and Children".
By buying one greetings card you can enable UNICEF to provide enough salt to treat six
children suffering from severe dehydration, and ten cards will provide 5,000 vitamin C
tablets or four stethoscopes for a health centre.

This face with eyes of ivory, lips of copper and silver teeth, belongs to a
remarkable lifesize statue of a fifth-century-BC Greek warrior, one of a pair
discovered on the Ionian Sea floor in 1972 by an Italian diver. The statues are
thought by some specialists to be the work of the great Greek sculptor
Phidias. Photo shows the face as it appeared, after seven years of meticulous
cleaning operations, to the crowds which flocked to see this major find of
twentieth-century archaeology on display at Reggio di Calabria in southern
