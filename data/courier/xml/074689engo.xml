OF THE CHIP

THE beginning of World Com¬
munications Year finds us living
through a communications-infor¬
mation revolution with profound implica¬
tions for every aspect of human society.
Our homes, schools and hospitals, our
cultural and leisure activities, the working
environment of office, farm and factory,
the very concept of "work" itself, will all
be radically transformed before the cen¬
tury is out. So far-reaching do these
transformations promise to be that histo¬
rians of the future are likely to look back
on the present decade as a turning point in
(he evolution of human society.
Smooth transition to the new information-
rich, communications-based society will
not be easy. The way we handle the new
communications technologies will be all
important and it is with an analysis of the
cultural, social, economic and political
problems involved that this issue of the
Unesco Courier begins.
For the Third World, the establishment
ofsound communications infrastructures
(which it is the prime objective of the
World Communications Year topromote)
a sine qua non of development. But
although the new technologies look temp¬
tingly like the breakthrough that could
help to close the development gap, it is on¬
ly natural that, for countries that have
suffered the colonial experience, hopes
for the future should be mingled with
serious doubts and fears.
The central section of this issue is con¬
cerned with the electronic "nuts and bolts"
of the communications-information revo¬
lution which has been brought about by
the rapid convergence ofa number ofnew
technologies^ The most important of these
are: the development of cheap, reliable
microprocessors with vast information-
handling capacity which permit wide
spread and easy access to information net¬
works and data banks and offer enormous
educational opportunities; telecommuni¬
cation satellites that make possible low-
cost, long-range, transmissions; audio¬
visual recording andplayback devices that
permit decentralized production and pre¬
sentation of multimedia material; the
development ofopticalfibres which make
possible piped, interference-free transmis¬
sion of huge quantities of information,
entertainment and educational program¬
mes; and, finally, the expansion and more
efficient use of the broadcastingfrequency
spectrum which has made possible the
rapid development of local and "citizens'
band" type radio broadcasting.
Experience shows that children all over
the world, whatever their social back¬
ground are fascinated by computers and
can handle with ease a device which many
adults still regard with a reticence border¬
ing on fear.
The computer's educational possibilities
are immense, provided that it is pro¬
grammed to respect the user's linguistic
background and cultural identity, a point
on which children themselves have strong
views.
Finally, the last section of this issue of
the Unesco Courier looks more closely at
the practical contribution communica¬
tions technology can make to develop¬
ment, points out some of thepitfalls to be
avoided in what looks like being the most
massive transfer of technology ever at¬
tempted, and gives concrete examples of
what Unesco has done and is doing in the
struggle to introduce a new and more
equitable international communication
order.

We must work together to enable the modern
communication media to contribute increas¬
ingly to the flowering offreedom and to the
development of mutual understanding and
respect among nations, as well as to the pro¬
motion ofgeneral socialprogress within each
nation.
Amadou-Mahtar M'Bow
Director-General of Unesco
Communication
in the
service of man
INFORMATION has become a key
resource. The industrial society
whose hallmark has for long
been man's power over things and
over nature also seems to be on the
way to becoming what some have
called the information society,
characterized by an enormous in¬
crease in man's power to extend,
store and order his knowledge, to
produce information and disseminate
it instantaneously, and the capacity to
create organizations that encompass
all aspects of life in society. Informa¬
tion has always been a fundamental
element in human organization and
the cohesion of societies, and the in¬
formation revolution has far-reaching
consequences, in the more or less
long term, for social organization.
The close relationship between
communication and all types of
power, the importance of com¬
munication as a source of wealth, at
national and at world level, together
with the influence that it exerts on
the various societies and on inter¬
national relations, go a long way
towards explaining the scope and in¬
tensity of the debate on the subject.
At national level, the division of
responsibilities between the public
and private sectors, the place allot¬
ted to the press, broadcasting and
the cinema, the status of journalists
and other professional com¬
municators, the influence that they
exert in different ways and, in par-

cation in the Service of Man", Major Pro¬
gramme III of Unesco's Medium-Term Plan
(1984-1989).
ticular, the impact of certain televised
and cinematographic messages and
publications, particularly on the
minds of inexperienced young peo¬
ple, are the subject of continual
discussion in many countries. The
same problems recur at international
level.
Modern telecommunication tech¬
nology enables those with access
thereto to broadcast messages which
can be received instantaneously
throughout the world. Thanks to
communications satellites, this is
already true of radio, and will soon be
so for television. However, the
electromagnetic spectrum still re¬
mains very unequally distributed,
and few countries have the means of
developing or even benefiting from
the appropriate technologies.
The impact that the messages
transmitted by this means can have
on mutual understanding between
peoples and between nations and on
the maintenance of peace is
undeniable. Clearly, then, the inter¬
national community cannot ignore
the problem of the content of these
messages, which are potentially of
the gravest significance for the
future development of peoples and
indeed of all mankind. This is why
mankind has always attached import¬
ance to the role that .the media play,
or can potentially play, in eliminating
prejudice and helping to bring about a
world where mutual understanding
will hasten the coming of peace and
the advent of societies that are more
just, more respectful of human
rights, and more concerned to do
away with ignorance, disease,
hunger and poverty.
The development of the cultural
and the communications industries
may encourage a dialogue serving to
promote better understanding bet¬
ween peoples and their cultures, but
it may also lead to serious forms of
cultural alienation if these industries
remain concentrated solely in certain
areas of the world, if the products
and the messages which they create
are typical only of certain cultures
and if the flow of these is a one-way
flow only. Clearly, it is vital that the
capacity to produce and disseminate
such products and messages should
be shared more fairly. It would seem
that a better balance should be
struck between those who produce
and export cultural products and pro¬
grammes and those who generally
have no choice but to receive them.
The problems generated by com¬
munication in the service of man are
closely linked to the rapid develop¬
ment of technologies for collecting,
storing, reproducing and disseminat¬
ing signs and images. The introduc¬
tion of information technology and
certain news transmission and dis¬
tribution techniques, the new sys¬
tems of reproduction, printing,
sound and audio-visual recording
and, above all, the wide dissemina¬
tion of some of these techniques
among the public are transforming
the industrial structures of com¬
munication and affecting all those in¬
volved therein; cable and satellite
transmission holds out new pros¬
pects, but also entails major changes
in the respective roles of the different
participants in the communication
process.

An instrument so versatile that its applications seem almost limitless, the computer is at the heart of the communications
revolution. In addition to developing telecommunications facilities, computers are today used by creative artists to com¬
pose and perform music, draw pictures, make designs (like the cover of this issue, detail above) and even write poems.
The rate at which technological
transformations are occurring in the
communication and information field
is so rapid that a continuous process
of catching up has become
necessary, making forward planning
and decision-taking increasingly dif¬
ficult, particularly in the case of
countries with limited resources.
While such transformations affect
first and foremost the production of
software and the manufacture of
equipment serving to transcribe and
record the messages, they have a
particular bearing on the processes
by which information and messages
are stored, transmitted and received.
Although the race to achieve
miniaturization, increased output
and a reduction in cost prices may
foster an increase in productivity, it
nevertheless makes for an ever more
rapid rate of obsolescence. The oldest
means of communication, such as
books and newspapers, are no longer
immune to such upheavals, which
may have very serious repercussions
for them. The transformations affec¬
ting the various aspects and forms
of communication manufacturing
methods, transmission and reception
processes and techniques can in¬
fluence not only the future of the
various media, but also, and more
radically, that of the written and
printed word. The formulation and
implementation of communication
and information policies matching
the requirements of the different
countries accordingly requires a per¬
manent command of scientific and
technological knowledge as well as
of economic and industrial practices.
Foremost of the prospects opened
up by the technological development
and increased potential of com¬
munication is its growing role as an
instrument of education and culture.
With the added value conferred upon
it as a medium of education, com¬
munication creates an international
environment that complements if not
competes with schooling, and
deprives the educational system of
the monopoly it has long held over
education, while itself becoming a
subject to be taught and studied. A
reciprocal relationship is thus emerg¬
ing between communication and
education, one that is undoubtedly
destined to develop, and that it is
vital to make both positive and fruit¬
ful, particularly within the context of
education conceived as a lifelong
enterprise and hence based on the
link between formal and non-formal
schooling, and designed to provide
everyone, throughout their lives,
with the chance to bring their
knowledge and know-how up to date
and to acquire new skills.
In the same way, a growing in¬
terdependence is emerging between

and culture. In
modern society, the communication
media are pre-eminent instruments
for the dissemination of culture, but
nevertheless pose serious threats to
the cultural identity of many peoples.
Increased access by the widest
possible public to the various media
of culture can be extensively
fostered by the mass communication
media, in particular through mass
production processes and tech¬
niques. The emergence of industrial
structures in the field of culture can,
of course, stimulate creativity and
facilitate the dissemination of
culture; at the same time, however,
it may give rise to serious problems
and real dangers for a whole range of
cultures.
The very etymology of the word
"media" indicates that they are
instruments for linking and, hence,
for bringing men closer together. But
in increasing the number of those
receiving the same message, the
media have often deprived in¬
dividuals of certain opportunities for
interpersonal communication, and
have thereby even created a gulf bet¬
ween them. They have thus in¬
troduced an imbalance into the
dialogue within societies, creating in¬
equalities between a minority engag¬
ed in transmitting messages and the
majority who are "on the receiving
end". Readers, listeners and viewers
are often mere passive receivers.
In many countries, machinery has
been set up to secure wider par¬
ticipation by the public in programm¬
ing and programme production, as
well as in media management. This
democratization of communication
takes various forms, according to the
circumstances. The development of
decentralized media can serve to
foster greater participation, in par¬
ticular in the field of rural com¬
munication and rural development,
and may enable underprivileged sec¬
tors of the public to receive more
abundant information emanating
from a wider range of sources and
better suited to their particular re¬
quirements; it may at the same time
offer them the chance to be not
merely passive receivers, and to
make their concerns and points of
view known.
The media lie at the heart of
various problems dealt with in
Unesco (literary and artistic creation,
protection of copyright and disse¬
mination of a wide range of works).
Making, as they do, extensive use of
intellectual and artistic works the
media provide intellectually creative
people and different types of artist
with enormous opportunities for
work and self-expression. They sti¬
mulate creativity as well as raising
the problem of the protection of
authors and the dissemination of
their works. In this respect, it seems
desirable to find a balance between
overprotection which might be
detrimental to the dissemination of
works of use to a wide public and
the abuses which might, conversely,
harm the artists.
Communication and information
have become major economic forces
of our time alike at national and inter¬
national levels. Representing as they
do an ever larger proportion of the
gross national product of the in¬
dustrialized countries, they con¬
stitute a dynamic sector that offers
considerable growth prospects and
hence new job opportunities. In a
single major industrialized country, it
has been calculated that in 1 982 the
communications market as a whole
already amounted to 21.3 thousand
million dollars, and that this market
should total 103.1 thousand million
dollars in 1990, that is, an increase
of 490 per cent in eight years. Com¬
munication is becoming the key ac¬
tivity in the most highly industrialized
countries, where already more than
half the working population is direct¬
ly or indirectly engaged in producing,
processing and distributing informa¬
tion. Communication and informa¬
tion have thus become the advanced
sector of the growing economy.
However, the situation is by no
means the same in all countries. The
huge disparities that exist at interna¬
tional level in the production and cir¬
culation of messages and pro¬
grammes is today a recognized fact.
In 1978, the developing countries,
representing 70 per cent of the
world's population, commanded on¬
ly a small fraction of the media of
Right, as part of a Unesco project in Mali, a group of men and
women who had neither used video equipment nor had even
seen television before were successfully trained to make
their own video programmes for use in support of the coun¬
try's Women's Literacy Programme.

World
Communications
Year
COMMUNICATIONS and development are in¬
separable. Effective communications services
are vital to the rational management of
economic activities in the complex world of today.
Without adequate communications infrastructures the
developing countries cannot hope to achieve any real
measure of self-sufficiency, they will be denied access
to the store of knowledge accumulated in the world's
data banks, development strategies will have little
chance of achieving lasting success and the grand
design of establishing a new international economic
order will be seriously compromised.
It was in recognition of "the fundamental impor¬
tance ofcommunications infrastructures as an essential
element in the economic and social development of all
countries" that, in proclaiming 1983 World Com¬
munications Year, the General Assembly of the United
Nations deliberately added the sub-title Development
of Communications Infrastructures.
The purpose of the World Communications Year is
thus to increase the scope and effectiveness of com¬
munications as a force for economic, cultural and
social development.
Two difficulties immediately come to mind. Firstly,
the cost of establishing viable communications in¬
frastructures appears, at first glance, to be alarmingly
high given the present state of the world economy. It is
vital therefore to recognize the multiplier effect ofcom¬
munications which have become the keystone of the
economic edifice.
Secondly, the very rapid rate of advance in com¬
munications technologies and the bewilderingly wide
variety ofsystems available, not all of which are com¬
patible with each other, makes selection of the type of
technology to be adopted extremely difficult.
Government leaders and decision-makers are thus
faced with choices which are difficult to reconcile. Only
through a concerted effort of planning and co¬
ordination at both the international and the national
level will viable solutions be found.
The activities to be undertaken during World Com¬
munications Year are therefore designed to achieve the
following objectives:
to focus attention on the need to develop national
communications infrastructures An view of their
primary importance in the overall development
process;
to ensure proper co-ordination in the establishment
of these infrastructures so that all sectors ofa country 's
economy can make a balanced, complementary con¬
tribution to its total socio-economic development;
to inform planners, decision-makers and the public
about the opportunities offered by the new techniques
and systems available so that they will be able to make
rational and informed choices;
to mobilize national and international resources for
the intensive development of communications in¬
frastructures, particularly in the poorest regions;
to make proposals for the elaboration of a global
communications policy within the context of national
and international development strategies.

communication: 22 per cent of book
titles published, 17 per cent of total
newspaper circulation, 9 per cent of
newsprint consumption, 27 per cent
of radio transmitters, 18 per cent of
radio receivers, 5 per cent of televi¬
sion transmitters and 12 per cent of
television receivers.
Far from diminishing, these dis¬
parities, which also affect certain in¬
dustrialized countries, have on the
contrary been constantly increasing
as technology has developed. Dis
parities between rural and urban areas
are also particularly marked throughout
the world.
Communication and information
may be regarded as the nervous
system of contemporary societies;
they play an essential role in
economic and social development,
and the present disparities in
capacities for communicating and
acceding to information serving to
promote progress, in particular scien¬
tific and technical information,
reflect the very serious inequalities
existing in the world between dif¬
ferent nations. In order to vanquish
poverty, to combat illiteracy, to in¬
crease their educational potential, to
master science and modern tech¬
nology, and to ensure the full flower¬
ing and enrichment of their own
cultures, the countries of the Third
World need to increase their capa¬
cities to create, disseminate, receive,
store and utilize information in ever
greater quantities.

Doubts, fears and hopes
by Jean Ping
AS a result of the stupendous
achievements of modern science
and technology, instruments
of communication have become so
sophisticated that no part of the world
is today isolated; our planet is thus
neither more nor less than a "global
village".
However, this great human victory is
also a two-edged sword. Used construc¬
tively, it serves to transmit knowledge,
fight illiteracy, encourage respect for
human rights and the rights of peoples,
consolidate national unity, foster inter¬
national understanding, and promote
economic and socio-cultural develop¬
ment.
But it can also be used, along quite
different lines, to subjugate man, to in¬
cite to war or racism, to restrict the
liberty and sovereignty of peoples, to
encourage cultural alienation, and to
propagate "disinformation".
A growing number of Third World
countries are interested in the immense
possibilities opened up by the
technological explosion in communica¬
tion. Whoever disposes of technology
disposes of communication and thus,
also, of power.
However, a small number of in¬
dustrialized countries and transna¬
tional corporations possess a virtual
monopoly of these high technologies
(electronics, informatics, telematics,
satellites, etc.). It is actually in this field
that the gap between developed and
developing countries is widening the
most seriously, and may have the most
grievous consequences.
The first of these consequences con¬
cerns the technological dependence
which is exemplified notably by the
"structural grip" of the North, and the
transnational' control over research
and development, the sale of patents
and licences, the delivery of equipment
and software, the provision of spare
parts and maintenance services, or the
operation of artificial satellites.
The second has to do with "absorp¬
tion capacity". The speed of technical
progress very often exceeds the capaci¬
ty of developing countries to absorb
and master such highly specialized
technology, which can only be of
benefit to them if a minimum of condi-

man of the working committee on information
and communication at Unesco of the "Group
of 77".
8
tions favourable to its assimilation
already exist (specialists, qualified per¬
sonnel, training and research centres).
Unfortunately, certain technological
choices are imposed by the transna¬
tional corporations with reference to
their own interests (profits, marketing
strategy, dumping) and not the real
needs and local conditions of the
receiving countries.
Another major consequence is that
the tensions between modernity and
tradition usually reveal themselves in
the downgrading, the marginalization
and even the disappearence of certain
traditional modes of interpersonal
communication; this unequal impact
may even lead to ethnocide. Almost in¬
variably the result is an impoverish¬
ment of the cultural heritage of
humanity and an increase in the feeling
of isolation on" the part of individuals
with, on the one hand, a majority of
"receivers" forced into a passive role
as listeners, and on the other, an active
minority of "transmitters".
It is only one step from a
technological grip to an economic grip,
a step which it is all the easier to make
since communication has become a key
economic resource in international ex¬
changes. It has been calculated, for ex¬
ample, that one European country will
draw 85 per cent of its foreign earnings
from the sale of information in one
form or another (patents, licences,
royalties, technical know-how, etc.)
But the situation is very different in
the Third World, since the interna¬
tional division of labour inherited from
the colonial situation has "specialized"
our countries in the production and ex¬
port of raw materials and the import of
services and manufactured goods.
The communications industry is in¬
creasingly characterized by excessive
oligolopolistic concentration and a
growing transnationalization, as the
Dutch specialist Cees Hamelink
pointed out when he wrote that "75 per
cent of the current market in com¬
munications is controlled by some
80 transnational corporations", all of
them belonging to the industrialized
world. This is an indication of the ex¬
tent to which communication, as a ma¬
jor economic resource, is unequally
distributed in the world.
These inequalities naturally play a
part in- increasing the economic
dependence and accentuating the im¬
balances to which the developing world
is subject: excessive indebtedness,
chronic built-in balance of payments
deficits, deteriorating terms of trade,
imported inflation; in short, the
development of under-development.
Thus it could not be more clearly ap¬
parent that the New International In¬
formation and Communication Order
is an indispensable precondition for the
establishment of a new, more just and
more equitable international economic
order.
There is no need to stress the increas¬
ingly close links between communica¬
tion and culture. But, if it is now
recognized that the mass media in con¬
temporary societies are privileged in¬
struments of cultural diffusion and im¬
portant centres of artistic creation, it is
nonetheless true that they also
engender "perverse effects" which pre¬
sent serious threats and real dangers for
the cultures of many peoples.
This is due notably to the fact that
the developing countries attach too
high a priority to infrastructure
("hardware") in comparison with the
content of the message and everything
covered by the notion of software.
Once the equipment is installed, there
usually ensues a veritable invasion of
imported programmes which reflect
foreign cultural models, with attendant
risks of the erosion of endogenous
values and cultural alienation.
This is the case with cinema and
television through which these im¬
ported models go down into the street
and contribute to the moral disintegra¬
tion of traditional societies.
The same goes for the transnational
cultural industries which propagate in
our countries the uniformizing and
homogenizing model of what Francis
Balle has called a new "standardized,
average, mildly euphoric culture,
against a background of commonplace
ideas, produced according to an in¬
dustrial technique". Likewise the great
organs of information which usually
convey a deformed and incomplete im¬
age of the developing countries, giving
prominence to the sensational and the
scandalous.
This makes it possible to understand
why the international community can¬
not be indifferent to the problem of the
content of messages. What, for exam¬
ple, will be beamed tomorrow across
national frontiers by direct satellite
television? What language? What
culture? What politics? Such questions
fuel the anxieties, the fears, the frustra¬
tions, but also the hopes, of the
developing world.

Thepromotion ofrural communication meritsparticular attention,
to the extent that it makes it possible to offer to the widest strata of

Communications between peoples and cultures with the discoveries
ofscience and technology which enable man to cross time and space
at a speed unthinkable to most of us has created and will further
create new dimensions in the life of human societies. Indonesia
believes that communication and information as a cultural force,
which also transmit the cultural values and identity ofevery nation,
deserve our earnest attention with a view to developing them in such
a way that services and support to the overall development plans of
Unesco's Member States may be provided.
Indonesia
In few areas has there been so much technological development as
in communications; those who possess these media tend to use them
to communicate and diffuse unilaterally their ideas and concepts of
reality, while thepoor countries remain in conditions of inequality,
lacking mechanisms whereby they can make their voices heard and
at times exposed to the process whereby their image is manufac¬
tured, with grave distortions, by others. We believe that in thisfield
it is necessary to pursuepolicies based on equity and on the democra¬
tization of means of expression.

There is also an indispensablefactor ofdevelopment, at the present
time, which constitutes a kind oftransmission belt in each and every
one of the usual activities of society: communication. It has been
wisely remarked that communication is power. As a result of the
coincidence and complementarity of a series of closely interrelated
technologies, the world ofcommunication has undergone rapid and
accelerated change which accountsfor its constantpresence in most
aspects of the life ofsocieties. Of course it is obvious that the pro¬
gress ofcommunication and information in the developing countries
is crucial for their economic, political and social development, and
to bring this about it is indispensable to count on the solid and equi¬
table support of the international community.
Panama
// is a fact that the new international information and communica¬
tion order is dialectically linked to the new international economic
order. The tenacity with which the wealthy oppose the latter thus
explains, essentially, the multiplication ofthe barriers raised against
any profound change in thefield ofcommunication. The extremely
rapid development of information technologies, which remain the
preserve ofa tiny minority ofadvanced countries, may even, ifcare
is not taken, lead to a new strengthening of monopolies and an
aggravation of disequilibria. It is thus particularly opportune that
Unesco should stimulate andfurther reflexion on questions related
to data banks, for example, asprovidedfor in the majorprogramme

With its thousands of components, this microprocessor,

WITH electronic watches and

"macro-impact" on the social and
economic life of human beings, and
in two specific domains in particular.
In the first place, working condi¬
tions and the actual distribution of
jobs are undergoing profound
changes as a result of the process of
automation. This process began
some thirty years ago, but although
	
ALEKSANDR FEDOROVICH BARYSHEV is
a Soviet specialist in the application of compu¬
ter technology to control systems. A member

trol Sciences, heis the authorofa series ofstu¬
dies concerning automation, a field in which he

innovations.

the problems involved have been
discussed throughout the interven¬
ing period, it is only during the last
few years that their importance and
urgency have been fully recognized,
with the appearance on the world
market of the microprocessor a
piece of electronic equipment which,
in fact as well as in theory, is capable
of taking the control of entire
manufacturing activities and of many
service industries out of human
hands. It is hard to conceive all the
social and economic implications of
this development.
Secondly, microprocessors have
proved to be by far the most efficient
instruments from the technological
and economic points of view alike
for handling the vast and rapidly in¬
creasing flow of information, whose
role in the affairs of the modern world
cannot be overestimated.
Before going further, let us recall
the basic characteristics of the
microprocessor itself, the most
precocious child of semiconductor
technology, whose own rapid
development has made it possible to
implant what are known as in¬
tegrated circuits on tiny (no greater
than 5x5 mm) slices of silicon, call¬
ed "chips". Depending on the densi¬
ty of the circuits, this process is
known as large-scale or very large-
scale integration (LSI and VLSI). At
first, these systems were used for
memorizing operations, and for cer¬
tain logical operations. Later, and as
a result of the increased sophistica¬
tion of the integrated circuits, it'
became possible to place on a single
silicon chip the means of carrying out
logical, memorizing and input/output
functions, and of relating these func¬
tions to each other.
This breakthrough led to the cre¬
ation, in 1971, of the first micro¬
processor, a piece of equipment
which carries out the functions of
one of the basic components of a
conventional computer the central

processing unit, or CPU. In other
words, the microprocessor is
capable of deciphering and executing
the instructions contained in a pro¬
gramme (which, in a computer, is
committed to its memory, the se¬
cond basic component), and of con¬
trolling the process of acceptance
and supply of information (the in¬
put/output component of a com¬
puter). Infinitely smaller than a con¬
ventional computer, and consuming
far less power, the microprocessor,
when it is connected to appropriate
external elements, actually becomes
a "microcomputer".
The development of micro¬
processors and microcomputers
alike is taking place at great speed. If
the past 30 years have seen the ap¬
pearance of only four successive
generations of computers, a fourth-
generation microprocessor made its
appearance only eight years after the
first. This means to say that, at the
present rate of progress, a new
generation is emerging every two
years, to become obsolete after a
period of three or four years.
Microprocessors and microcom¬
puters are playing a significant role in
the development of many different
branches of industry. According to
the Soviet scientist, Academician
Gury I. Marchuk, microelectronic
technology will; in the forseeable
future, have been applied in more
than 200,000 different devices and
systems in industry and in the home.
This is indeed a technological
revolution!
Specialists reckon that some 250
million units and systems incor¬
porating microprocessors were in
use throughout the world at the end
of 1980, and that between five and
ten thousand million will be in service
in the year 2000.
They are being more and more
widely used in many fields, notably in
medicine. Microprocessors enable
sophisticated methods of calculation
to be perfected, to make more ac¬
curate diagnoses of illnesses of the
cardiovascular system and brain ill¬
nesses, through such processes as
electrocardiography and tomo¬
graphy, and to check the patient's
psychophysiological characteristics.
They are also used for the continuous
supervision of patients during the
post-operatory period, and in the ap¬
plication of intensive therapy. In this
way they make it possible to take the
necessary measures and con¬
siderably facilitate the work of the
medical staff.
Microprocessors also play an im¬
portant role in the production of con¬
sumer goods, cars, games and toys,
apparatus in everyday use, house¬
hold computers, etc. The number of
machines of this kind, which stood at
80 million in 1980, could reach 200
million in 1984. The application of
microprocessors and microcom¬
puters is developing above all in the
leisure industry and in the automobile
industry.
The promise of the microprocessor
lies in the manner in which it com¬
bines low cost, size and power con¬
sumption with high information-
handling capacity and reliability.
Thus, for example the first
microprocessor, "lntel-8008", cost
$360, whereas an improved version,
which appeared two years later, cost
less than $30. Today far more
sophisticated microprocessors such
as "Intel 8080" and "Zilog 80" cost
between 4 and 5 dollars and this
trend towards reduced costs is
continuing.
The format of today's pocket
calculators is determined by the size
of the keyboard, and not by the
printed circuits they contain. Indeed,
the information-handling capacity of
such circuits is steadily increasing.
Between 1975 and 1978, the pack¬
ing density of a silicon chip measur¬
ing 1 mm2 grew in a ratio of
1 :80,000. If this trend is maintained,
a single chip may well be carrying up
to 109 electronic elements by the
mid-1990s, although this will de¬
pend on the solution of a great
number of outstanding problems. In
recent years, the reliability of
microprocessor circuits has increas¬
ed three to four times.
The appearance of micro¬
processors and microcomputers
forms part of the phenomenon
which, in many circles, is called the
"information revolution", defined by
the Canadian scientist T.R. Ide as a
combination of developments in
telecommunications on the one
hand, and in computer technology on
the other.
In essence, the computer is an "in¬
formation machine". Information ar¬
rives from the external environment
via its input mechanism; the machine
stores this information, processes it
according to a predetermined set of
rules, and then produces the results
via its output system. In other words,
the computer establishes a relation
between different facts, evaluates
analogies, and carries out other func-
tions;it interacts with, and helps to
change, its environment, thereby
revealing itself capable of replacing
human intervention in many intellec¬
tual processes.
At this point, we might pause to
consider the biological aspects of the
development of information. The
Swiss scientist, B. Fritsch, has sug¬
gested that the first great quan¬
titative jump forward in this process
occurred during the Stone Age,
when men began to assimilate a
greater amount of information direct¬
ly from their immediate surroundings
(than as a result of transmission from
generation to generation). The se¬
cond jump took place some 5,000
years ago, with the invention of dif¬
ferent forms of writing, which made
it possible to store information
elsewhere than in the human brain;
the invention of printing was merely
a qualitative refinement of this
breakthrough.
The creation of microprocessors
may be seen as the third spectacular
jump as far as the development of in¬
formation is concerned. Again for the
first time in history, it has become
possible to store not only informa¬
tion, but also intellect.
When we bear in mind that the first
of the above three stages covered a
period of a hundred million years, the
second several millennia and the
third only a matter of decades, we
realize that the entire process of in¬
formation development is ac¬
celerating at an almost unbelievable
rate.
The "information" content of
automation is becoming increasingly

^ apparent. In fact, automation is only
an efficient process when it is back¬
ed by an economic and well-orga¬
nized capacity to collect, conserve,
analyse and transmit information. All
control systems function on the
basis of information-handling in the
sequence: input processing out¬
put; the role of microprocessors in
such systems is to furnish the
capacity to process information in¬
puts and to devise control operations.
At the beginning of the 1 960s, the
famous Soviet mathematician,
Academician Victor M. Glukhov,
drew attention to the need to in¬
troduce automation into control pro¬
cedures. Under his direction, the first
project was drawn up for a network
of State computing centres which
would be established to reorganize,
without using paper as a medium,
the mechanisms of administrative
and economic management, from
plant to "Gosplan" level.
Later, from 1965 to 1970, the
Soviet Union carried out a pro¬
gramme of automatized manage¬
ment at plant level and in various
ministries. The experience thus ac¬
quired made it possible to define the
task of computing centres in the
State network: they would con¬
stitute the technical basis of a global
automatized system for collecting
and processing management and
planning information. This is an am¬
bitious programme which is taking
more than a decade.

telephony has been a major
life-saving factor, enabling
doctors and nurses to in¬
tervene during the crucial
early period after a serious ac¬
cident, a heart attack or other
emergency. Left, all the

But what of the information itself?
The current rate of growth of scien¬
tific and technical information is
estimated at 12.5 per cent per year.
In other words, we are faced with a
paradoxical situation in which men
are called upon to exercise tighter
and tighter management over the
economy, and where the number of
decisions they must take, based on
factual information, is increasing ex¬
ponentially from year to year.
It is in this context that
microprocessors and other types of
microelectronic equipment come in¬
to their own, as the basis for highly
cost-effective information systems.
For example, the total amount of in¬
formation required to enable a
university student to complete his
education may be expressed in 3.1
x 107 words, incorporating 1.64 x
108 signs; modern electronics
makes it possible to store all this in¬
formation in no more than the
volume of space occupied by a
packet of cigarettes.
Improved accessibility of informa¬
tion is not only changing the face of
education. The application of micro¬
electronics is transforming the pat¬
tern of job distribution not only
within individual enterprises, but in
entire branches of the manufacturing
and service industries. The propor¬
tion of research and development
(R & D) personnel in factories pro¬
ducing office and management
equipment has, for example, increas
ed significantly in recent years. Ac¬
cording to the Italian scientist Bruno
Lamborghini, the proportion of the
employees of one large Italian com¬
pany engaged in research rose from
5.6 per cent in 1 970 to 9 per cent in
1978; during the same period, the
proportion of production workers fell
from 45 per cent to 31 per cent.
Similar trends have been observed
in a number of Western European
countries. These changes call for a
radical modification of educational
systems. Rapid growth in the ap¬
plication of microelectronics, the
rate of renewal of techniques and
technologies and the increasing out¬
put of microelectronic products are
leading to a situation where it is
essential to relocate large numbers
of workers, and to train them for new
tasks.
In many fields of human activity, a
thorough renewal of knowledge and
skills is already required every five or
six years, and it is possible that this
period will be considerably reduced
in the future. Conditions are thus ripe
for lifelong education a concept
which Unesco has consistently
advocated and, in the opinion of
some specialists, for the incorpora¬
tion of basic instruction in informa¬
tion processing and microelectronic
technology in general education
programmes.
It is not surprising, therefore, that
many scientists and specialists
throughout the world believe that the
solution of the problems posed by
the widespread application of
microelectronics is closely related to
the issues of education, science and
culture. This view was clearly ad¬
vanced, for example, during the First
European Conference on the Socio-
Economic Problems and Potential of
the Application of Microelectronics
in the World of Work, held in the
Netherlands in September 1979 and
at the meeting of the Club of Rome,
in Austria, in February 1982.
Microelectronics opens up qualita¬
tively new possibilities for individual
development; but at the same time it
makes increased demands as far as
the numbers and skills of scientific
and technical personnel are concern¬
ed. The compulsory secondary
education provided in the Socialist
countries lays the necessary founda¬
tion for proceeding to a technical and
university education, and thus
seriously addresses the problem of
creating a completely new type of
worker one who has received
higher, specialized education.

In the Socialist countries, the
changes brought about by microelec¬
tronics in the world of work have a
generally positive character,
although the possibility that they
may exercise a negative influence on
certain groups of workers or on cer¬
tain situations cannot be excluded.
But, under conditions of full employ¬
ment, these negative aspects can be
countered by the reorientation and
re-education of the workers concern¬
ed, so that they may apply their
energies and knowledge more effec¬
tively in other fields of productive
activity.
Study of the social and economic
consequences of the spread of these
new technologies forms part of a co¬
operative programme adopted by the
Council for Mutual Economic
Assistance (Comecon), in July 1 982,
with a view to promoting the
development of microprocessors and
their'application in member countries
over a period extending up to 1990.
The programme lays emphasis on the
training and recycling of intermediate
and high-level technicians in this
field.
According to figures from the US
Bureau of Labor Statistics, automa¬
tion may, by the end of this century,
lead to a situation where no more
than 10 per cent of the country's
workforce are employed in manufac¬
turing industry. At present, in a
number of non-Socialist industrializ¬
ed countries, the figure ranges bet¬
ween 35 and 50 per cent.
The introduction of microelec¬
tronics poses special problems in the
developing countries. In so far as the
development of the appropriate tech¬
nology demands an impressive
amount of initial capital investment,
as well as a firmly established scien¬
tific and technical infrastructure, it is
particularly difficult for these coun¬
tries to carry out their own R&D ac¬
tivities in the fields of computers and
telecommunications.
Furthermore, the development of
information systems on an interna¬
tional basis has political, as well as
economic implications for the
developing countries. Their govern¬
ments cannot obtain control over in¬
formation emanating from locally-
implanted manufacturing or service
industries, because the archives and
data banks in which this information
is stored are concentrated, as a rule,
in the hands of transnational corpora¬
tions, which thereby retain control
over the information itself.
The economic implications of the
problem lie in the fact that informa¬
tion tends to flow towards centres
where it can be most effectively and
economically processed, which
means, once again, in the direction of
the transnational corporations.
As we said at the beginning of this
article, it is still difficult to present a
comprehensive picture of all the
social, economic, organizational,
scientific and technical problems
posed by the ever-widening applica¬
tion of microelectronics and by the
growth of microelectronic infor¬
mation-handling capacities. Never¬
theless, it is certainly not too early to
consider, with every justification for
doing so, that the development of
the microprocessor may well go
down in history as the world's fourth
industrial revolution.

Anatomy
of the computer
FIVE hundred years ago, in Renais¬
sance Europe, culture was disse¬
minated by the newly-born printing
press. At the heart of the modern revolu¬
tion in communications technology is the
microcomputer.
WHAT IS A COMPUTER ? A computer
is a tool. A tool operates by taking raw
material and converting it into a product.
It is a device which performs a process.
The process is determined by people.
The computer's raw material consists
of facts or data. The product that it
generates from this raw material is infor¬
mation: The device is an array of elec¬
tronic and mechanical gadgetry which is
known as hardware. A computer is en¬
tirely dependent on instructions supplied
to it by its human users. These instruc¬
tions, or programs, which tell the com¬
puter how to carry out specific processes
or tasks are known as software.
WHAT COMPUTERS DO is to perform
prodigious feats of arithmetic, handling
millions of numbers per second. They
achieve these dazzling exploits not
because of any superhuman powers of
intelligence but because they can carry
out a few extremely simple operations
accurately and very fast.
HOW DO THEY DO THIS ? The inside
of a computer is a complex maze of on-
off switches which are used to perform
the computing activities and can also
store information in the computer's
memory. Because they are assemblies of
switches, computers work by using the
binary system of numbers. In the binary
system any number can be described by
the values 1 or 0, which can be repre¬
sented by turning a switch on (to mean 1 )
and off (to mean 0). All information in the
machine is thus reduced to two expres¬
sions, which can be variously defined as
zero (0) and one (1 ), off and on, or no and
yes, corresponding to the presence or
absence of an electrical charge at a par¬
ticular point. Early computers relied on
electromechanical on-off switches called
relays which physically opened and
closed. Today hundreds of thousands of
them can be etched on to a minuscule
fragment of silicon the microchip. The
heart of the machine is a central pro¬
cessor, a special chip on which instruc¬
tions are stored and obeyed.
Unlike the decimal system which uses
ten digits (0 to 9), the binary system uses
only two digits, 0 and 1, which can be
used to describe any number. To create a
2, you simply move 1 a column to the
left, just as you do to create a 10 in the
decimal system. Thus if zero is represent
ed by 0 and one by 1 , then two is repre¬
sented by 10, three by 1 1, four by 100,
five by 101, and so on. Thus the com¬
puter solves complex problems by break¬
ing them down into long strings of Os and
1s. (Because the computer performs its
calculations using binary numbers, com¬
putar scientists coined the word bit, from
Binary digIT, to describe the smallest
piece of information it can handle).

Programming means giving instruc¬
tions to a computer before it begins work
on what it must dó and how the work
must be done. Instructions are fed into
the computer by various methods such
as a typewriter-style keyboard which, in¬
stead of typing letters, sends electrical
impulses into the system. They are "writ¬
ten" in one of the "languages" which
computer scientists have devised to
translate human wishes into some varia¬
tion of the computer's two-word voca¬
bulary, explained above. A program thus
really involves setting up a number of
switches to go on and off to order.
The control unit in the machine's cen¬
tral processor acts on the instructions
given by the user to fetch information
from the computer's memory. This infor¬
mation is used by an arithmetic and logic
unit, which also forms part of the central
processor, for the required computing
operations.
Answers to problems can be presented
in various ways; they may be printed or
displayed on a visual display unit, which
is like a TV screen.
In addition to ordinary alphabetic or
numeric characters, the computer can
have special graphics, characters for
creating diagrams on the screen. Detail¬
ed pictures can be created by turning on
and off hundreds of thousands of
separate dots on the screen. This is how
the figure of Rodin's Thinker on our cover
was produced.
How a computer thinks
A decision tree is one way in which a computer can be made to "think".
The tree is an ordered set of rules that leads the computer to reach a conclu¬
sion. This simple diagram shows how a computer would use the decision
tree to identify one animal from among a number of possibilities. First the
computer determines whether the animal is a mammal. This example
assumes that the computer can answer that question either by carrying on
a dialogue with a person at a terminal, or by being able to analyse various
pictures of animals with a camera eye. If the animal is a mammal, the com¬
puter decides if the mammal is a carnivore. If it is a carnivore, the machine
looks for stripes to choose between a tiger and a cheetah.

The office of the future

Japan hooks up
for the 21st century
THE establishment of a nationwide,
error free, high-speed information
network during the early years of
the 21st century is the objective of the Nip¬
pon Telegraph and Telephone Public Cor¬
poration (NTT) of Japan. In a paper
presented at a symposium organized by
IDATE (Institut pour le Développement et
l'Aménagement des Télécommunications et
de l'Economie) and held at Montpellier,
France, in October 1982, Masatoshi Murata
of the commercial bureau of the NTT
described this ambitious project which will
make full use of recent advances in digital
telephone, optical fibre, computer and
satellite communication technology.
The basic technology for this revolu¬
tionary Information Network System, as it
is to be called, already exists, although its
integration into a homogeneous system will
raise complex technical problems. But what
advantages does it offer to ordinary men
and women and what effect will it have on
their personal lives and on the society in
which they live ?
Masatoshi Murata painted the following
picture of life with the system:
In the home
Daughter holds a three-way telephone
conversation with two of her friends.
Mother makes a long-distance call while
keeping an eye on the displayed call charge.
Father sends invitations to a dinner party
using the facsimile service.
Son scans a list of part-time jobs
available.
Daughter plays a computer game.
Father consults the bus time-table.
Mother consults the price list of her local
store and places an order.
In the department store
Salesgirls compile and send out price lists
16
and details of special offers and receive
orders from home terminals.
At school
A teacher sends a list of questions to
students at home and receives answers from
them.
At the local government office
A clerk despatches facsimile copies of
driving licences and other documents
directly to applicants' homes.
A public relations officer sends a publica¬
tion simultaneously to a number of com¬
munity leaders.
Documents are passed by facsimile bet¬
ween the headquarters and branch offices.
Discussions in the municipal assembly are
telecast to television receivers in community
centres.
Lectures and discussions are held in a
community centre and are telecast to televi¬
sion receivers in other community centres.

Municipal government information, in¬
cluding lists of government-sponsored
meetings, welfare services, application pro¬
cedures, etc., is instantly available to the
public.
At the office
A comprehensive office work station is
installed beside the manager's desk. It in¬
corporates a facsimile machine and a word
processor to enable him to send or receive
various forms of documents instantaneous¬
ly. It can also be used as a data storage ter¬
minal to gain access to the management
control and inventory control system.
Video teleconference calls are used as a
substitute for physical travel.
Terminals are used to give computer-
assisted education to employees.
Some employees work at home rather
than at their office.
Offices are relocated to rural areas and
are connected to headquarters via com¬
munications lines.
This by no means exhaustive list of the
possibilities the system offers (the possible
uses of the system for banking procedures,
for example, are immense) gives some idea
of the social transformation that introduc¬
tion of the system would involve.
Some of the advantages of the system can
be seen immediately. More workers could
work at home or at small offices near their
homes equipped with office automation ter¬
minals, thus avoiding the daily misery of
commuting. Much of the drudgery of work
would be eliminated, leaving more time for
really creative employment. A whole new
world would be opened up for physically
handicapped people and those who, for one
reason or another, are housebound. All
citizens would be better informed about,
and thus be able to take fuller advantage of,
local events, government services and
locally-available leisure-time activities.
There might, however, also be a number
of adverse effects. A society that became
over-dependent on such a closely-knit, all-
pervasive system might be very vulnerable
to technical failure; with a great number of
terminals linked to an integrated system
personal privacy and corporate security
might be put at risk; over-centralization of
information might result in over-
centralization of power; and, finally, if
home terminals were not sufficiently "user
friendly", some sections of the population
might, paradoxically, find even greater dif¬
ficulty in obtaining access to information.
The NTT is well aware of these dangers.
A model system is to be put into operation
towards the end of 1984 which will serve
some 10,000 subscribers in the Musashino
and Mitaka area, a suburb west of Tokyo.
It will also accommodate a limited number
of subscribers in the Tokyo metropolitan
area who will thus be able to communicate
with the inhabitants of Musashino and
Mitaka. The model system will serve not on¬
ly to test the technical feasibility of each ele¬
ment of the network and to verify construc¬
tion and maintenance techniques, but also
to provide a first hand guide to the overall
impact of the system on individuals and on
society as a whole.
Communicating
with glass
and light
OPTICAL fibres, hair-thin strands of
pure glass carrying information
as pulses of light, have been
described as "probably the biggest
breakthrough Nn telecommunications
since the invention of the telephone". All
kinds of communications can be carried
along the same optical fibre cable-
speech, text, photos, drawings, music,
computer data, etc. at higher speeds
than have been previously possible.
The fibres, made from glass so pure
that a block of it 20 km thick would
theoretically be as transparent as a win¬
dow pane, have many advantages over
metal wires. Small, light and easy to han¬
dle, they are made from an abundant raw
material, sand. They can carry the same
number of telephone calls as metal
cables ten times as thick dozens of
fibres, carrying around 100,000
telephone calls, could all pass through
the eye of a needle at the same time
and they are immune to electrical in¬
terference which affects the quality of
calls. An optical fibre cable the thickness
of a finger could bring a hundred TV
channels to a receiver.
The tiny strands are playing a key role
in the digital revolution which is sweep¬
ing through modern telecommunica¬
tions. The telecommunications network
developed for the telephone used a
system which turned the air pressure
waves created by speech into con¬
tinuous and variable "analogues" of
electrical waves and turned them back to
speech at the receiver. Expensive con¬
version equipment or separate networks
were needed to handle text, TV or com¬
puter data. In the digital world, however,
all forms of information are translated in¬
to bits, the standard internal language of
today's computers (see page 14), and
represented as pulses of light. Informa¬
tion in this form can be processed easily
and sent anywhere in seconds in a single
multi-purpose network. Optical fibres are
ideal for digital working and open the
door to a host of services not possible on
an analogue system.
Each strand of fibre consists of an inner
core to channel the light and an outer
cladding to keep it in by reflecting it back
along the core. To make the glass for the
fibres, the ingredients are deposited as
gases on the inside of a hollow silica tube
at temperatures of around 2000°C. The
tube is collapsed under intense heat to
form a solid glass rod about 1 cm in
diameter which already has the structure
of the fibre which will be drawn from it.
The rod is then loaded into a furnace,
drawn into fibre and coated with a resin
to protect it and increase its flexibility.
Tiny crystals the size of a grain of salt are
used to produce the light which carries
information along the fibres. This passes
through a lens into the fibre. At the other
end a receiver reverses the process and
turns each light pulse into an electrical
signal. Optical fibres will have countless
applications in tomorrow's "information
society".

Computers and literacy
in traditional languages
by Robert W. Lawler in collaboration with
Mamadou Niang and Moussa Gning
As computers become increasingly common and less expensive in the in¬
dustrialized nations, many more countries are entering the computer revolu¬
tion. This is a time ofdecision for a major issue: will uniformity or pluralism
be served by the technology of intelligent machines?
Computing machines are a malleable technology. Will that technology be
shaped to serve different human values with reason and sensitivity? Will it be
adapted so that it can be assimilated by the various, different cultures of the
world? Or will we see intelligent machines applied without the guidance of
human values? Will the technology be "transferred" from the industrialized
nations with more haste than understanding?
If one favours pluralism more than uniformity, it is important to ask how
the promise of the computer revolution can be shaped to fit various cultures
in a fashion congenial to the uniqueness of each. The transfer of ideas is more
important than the transfer ofmachines. We explore the adaptation of a com¬
puter application idea by describing in detail work I did with my daughter in
the United States and how colleaguesfrom Senegal are trying to make use of it.
MICROCOMPUTERS are pouring into homes and
schools in the industrialized countries and will
soon be flooding the world. It is hardly too soon
to wonder what effects computers are likely to have on our
children. Will computers change the way children learn? Will
computers change the sorts of people children become? I
believe the answers may well be yes, and although it is too
early for conclusive proof, I can offer here a story that sup¬
ports my belief.
I have worked in the computer industry for sixteen years,
and when my children were born I became interested in the
potential impact of early computer experiences on children's
learning. Several years ago, in collaboration with a computer
language project at the Massachusetts Institute of
Technology, I began an intensive study of how daily access
to a computer influenced the way my two older children
then aged six and eightlearned the basics of arithmetic. By
the time their younger sister Peggy turned three, a microcom¬
puter had become standard equipment in our household, and
I began to develop several programs to give Peggy access to
the machine. Playing with these programs in her own way
and on her own initiative over the following months, Peggy
began to do something that looks very much like the beginn¬
ings of reading and writing.
What is it really like to bring a microcomputer in your
home and let your three-year-old play with it? The answer
depends on who you are, your knowledge and values. The

computer entered my home and my family life because it is
a part of my work. It was my pleasure to write some simple
programs for my daughter's entertainment and edification.
My interests in children and computers led me to gather a
great deal of information about what Peggy knew before her
first encounter with the computer and afterwards. Between
her ages of three years three months and three years ten
months, Peggy began to read and write. The following
sketch of how this happened is based on my own observation
of only one child's learning; it is fair to say, however, that
I have an enormous amount of detailed information about
what this particular child knew and how that knowledge

changed over a long period of time. I believe this sketch will
be of general interest because Peggy's story provides some
advance information about how computer experience may
affect our children.
In the USA children typically learn to read around the age
of six. Most learn to read at school. A few teach themselves
to read earlier. Peggy, at the age of three, even living in a
bookish family, did not know how to read in any substantial
sense before her computer experience. Her knowledge of let¬
ters at three years, three months was quite specific and
limited. She recognized only a few letters as distinct symbols
with any meaning. For example, she knew that "P" was the
first letter of her name. She also recognized "G" as the
"mummy letter" because her mother's name is Gretchen.
What was Peggy's knowledge of spelling like? One inci¬
dent gave me some inkling. My oldest daughter was learning
a bit of French: one day Peggy claimed that she knew how
to "spell French^ and continued, "un, deux, trois, quatre,
Peggy adding a house.
cinq." At another time her spelling of "French" was "woof
boogie jig." Peggy saw the process of spelling as decompos¬
ing a meaningful word into a string of essentially mean¬
ingless symbols and had not yet learned any of the standard
spellings of words.
Peggy's ability and willingness to identify a string of sym¬
bols as a particular word came from a very specific beginn¬
ing. After receiving a gift book from her older sister (who
then wrote Peggy Lawler on the flyleaf), Peggy interpreted
all small clusters of alphabetic symbols as "Peggy Lawler."
At a later point in time, as a consequence of being often read
to, she became able to recognize a single, two letter word,
"by", which appeared on the title page of every book we
read to her. There is no reason to believe she had any idea
of what "by" might mean in that context. Her knowledge of
reading as a process for interpreting graphic material is best
seen in her common observation that she read Pictures and
I read Words. From her remark, we can infer she would
"read" by inventing a story based on her best speculation
about the pictures' meaning. She assumed that I was doing
"There it is.
the same with words. Not a bad assumption, but completely
empty of any information about how written words signify
as they do.
Contrast now her knowledge seven months later. Her
knowledge of letters is essentially complete, in that she
discriminates the 26 letters of the alphabet and can name
them. Her knowledge of words, in the sense of interpreting
them one at a time, is significantly greater. She reads more
than 20 words, most with complete dependability. But
unlike children who have learned to read and write by con¬
ventional means, she sees the spelling of words as stepwise
directions for keying a name into the computer. Although
her general idea of what book reading is may not have chang¬
ed, she has a different and powerful idea of what reading
single words means that derives directly from her experience
with my computer programs. Peggy's introduction to com¬
puters did not relate directly to "reading" in terms of con¬
tent, but her desire to control the machine led her into keying
on the computer her first "written" word. Having helped
load programs by pushing buttons on a cassette tape
recorder, one day on her own Peggy typed "LO" on the ter¬
minal then came seeking direction as to what letter came
next. A few days later, she typed the "load" command while
the rest of the family was busy elsewhere.
I call the computer environments created by the programs
I have written "microworlds" , following the terminology us¬
ed by Seymour Papert, the man chiefly responsible for the
development of the "LOGO" computer language, in his
book Mindstorms*. The initial microworlds were one for
moving coloured blocks around on the video display screen
and another (made for her older sister but taken over by
Peggy) which created designs by moving a coloured cursor.
While her sister used this drawing program to make designs,
Peggy's first drawing was a large box which she immediate¬
ly converted into a letter "P" by adding the stem. Letters in¬
trigued Peggy. They were a source of power she didn't
understand.

<![CDATA[
A few days later, Peggy keyed the letter "A" and explain¬
ed to me that "A is for apple." Her comment suggested a
way we could on the computer make a new kind of pre-
readers' ABC book. A child's book of ABC's typically offers
a collection of engaging pictures displayed in alphabetic
order with a large, printed letter associated with each picture.
The child looks at the pictures and is informed "A is for ap¬
ple." The relationship of letters to pictures is exactly the op¬
posite in the ABC microworld. The letter is the "key" for ac¬
cessing the picture. That is, keying the letter "D" produces
a picture of a dog.- Instead of responding to a statement such
as "See the doggie. D is for dog," Peggy was able to try any
letter on the keyboard, first, to see what it got her, and later,
if the picture interested her, to inquire what was the letter's
name. She was in control of her own learning. She could
learn WHAT she wanted, WHEN she wanted to, and could
ask for advice or information when SHE decided she
WANTED it. The ABC microworld was tailor-made for
Peggy. The shapes were selected and created on the computer
by Peggy's older sister and brother, aged ten and twelve. As
a consequence of playing with the ABC microworld and
with another to which we now turnPeggy developed a
stable and congenial familiarity with the letters of the
alphabet.
More complex and interesting than the ABC microworld,
the BEACH microworld provides a backdrop for action.
Waves and a beach in the foreground, with grass above, rise
to a road, more grass, and clouds at the top. Against that
backdrop, Peggy could create a small picture of an object by
specifying a procedure name, then manipulate the picture
with commanding procedures. Peggy typically began con¬
structing a scene with the word SUN. A yellow circle would
appear in the waves. She would raise it to the sky by keying
the word UP repeatedly, change its colour or set it in motion
with another word, and go on to other objects. She could,
for example, make a CAR image appear by keying that
word, change its location with commands UP, DOWN,
MOVE, and specify its heading and velocity with TURN,
SLOW, FAST, FASTER, and HALT.
These microworlds were created using Logo, an easily
comprehensible computer language which permits you to
assign meaning to any string of letters by writing simple pro¬
cedures. Logo's procedure definition was especially valuable
in customizing the BEACH world. When Peggy first used
BEACH, she was unhappy with the speed of the objects and
asked, "How can I make them zoom, Daddy?" Nothing was
easier than to create a new Logo word, ZOOM, which set the
velocity of the object with a single primitive command. In a
further instance, Peggy's older sister made a horse-and-rider
design and wrote a PONY procedure to create an object with
a horse-and-rider design and set it in motion. After watching
her sister edit that shape design, Peggy imitated the specific
commands to create her own new shape. (She could not well
control the design and ended with a collection of perpen¬
dicular lines. Asked what it was, she first replied "A pony,"
then later, "Something important.") It is very likely that
primary grade children could create their own designs and
would copy and alter procedures to expand or personalize
the vocabulary of BEACH-like microworlds.
As a direct consequence of playing with the BEACH
world, Peggy learned to "read" approximately twenty
words. Initially, she keyed names and commands, copying
them letter by letter from a set of cards. Soon, her favourite
words were keyed from memory. Less familiar words she
could locate by searching through the pile of cards. When her
mood was exploratory, she would try unfamiliar words if she
encountered them, by chance. Now, when shown those
wordson the original cards or printed otherwheres she
recognizes the pattern of letters and associates it with the ap¬
propriate vocal expression. Further, the words are mean¬
ingful to her. She knows what they represent, either objects
or actions.

microworlds

Robert Lawler for his daughter Peggy and (right)
the "village microworld" created by Mamadou
Niang, Moussa Gning and Robert Lawler for the
pupils of the Experimental School of the Ecole

vironments which children quickly learn to
manipulate and to which they can add images of
their own creation. Computers are adaptable
tools, but it is vital that the software devised for
them be shaped to take into account differing
human values and needs. In the particular case
of the Senegalese village microworld the soft¬
ware has been adapted to embrace Wolof , one
of the traditional languages of Senegal. The
meanings of the Wolof words that appear In the

or go; awyong= aeroplane; nit= person;
asamaan = 'm the sky; weneeku = turn; and,

<![CDATA[
In the past, words for reading have always been an
alphabetic symbol for an idea to be evoked in the mind. For
Peggy, words are that but something else as wella set of
directions for specifying how to key a computer command.
What is strikingly different in this new word-concept, as con¬
trasted with quasi-phonetic decoding, is that the child and
computer together decode a letter string from a printed word
to a procedure which the computer executes and whose
significance the child can appreciate. Finally, because the
computer can interpret specific words the child does not yet
know, she can learn from the computer through her self-
directed explorations and experiments.
The basic lesson I draw from this story is NOT merely
about "motivation"although Peggy did enjoy playing
with these microworlds and learned from doing so. There is
a more revolutionary aspect, one paradoxical as well. This
new technology can make possible a more "natural" absorp¬
tion of knowledge. The character of words experienced as ex¬
ecutable procedure names brought Peggy into a new rela¬
tionship with language, one different from what has been
characteristic of learning to read in the past.
Learning to read from print is necessarily a passive process
for the child. Words on the page stand for other people's
meanings. Until children start to write, they can't use written
words for their own purposes. Microcomputers put reading
and writing together from the start. A word that Peggy can
read is also one she can use to produce on the computer ef¬
fects that interest her. For Peggy, learning the alphabetic
language has become more like every infant's learning of the
vocal language. Speaking is powerful for the infant, even for
one who commands but a few words, when a responsive per¬
son listens. Likewise, the production of alphabetic
symbols even one letter and one word at a time can
become powerful for the young child when computer micro-
worlds provide a patient, responsive intelligence to interpret
them.
Since speech is natural to man in all the various cultures
of our world, it is reasonable to ask whether the most general
and powerful elements in Peggy's experience with writing
can be adapted for use in cultures other than the one to which
she is native. If computer technology could make learning to
read and write more like learning to speak and understand,
it would be capable of changing profoundly the intellectual
character of the world in which we all live.
The essential power available through the Logo computer
language is that a word, any string of symbols, can be given
a function. For example, the word "SUN" can cause the ex¬
ecution of a computer procedure which produces a graphic
image representing the sun. Because both the spelling of a
word and the meaning given to it are assigned through
writing a procedure, the words of computer microworlds are
independent of the "natural" language of the programmer.
For example, the same procedure which creates the "SUN"
could be given the name "SOLEIL" (French) or "JANT"
(Wolof)- Although computer, words may be language-
independent, anything made for use by people is culturally
bound. Only people who share the same cultural experiences
can know which objects and actions within a culture will be
congenial to the children and will relate to the kind of homely
experience which is close to their hearts and will continue to
engage them in learning and loving learning.
The people who should determine what computer ex¬
periences are offered to children should be the children
themselves, their parents or their teachers or others who
are close to the children and share their experiences
hopefully, sensitive, caring instructors with a progressive
commitment to what is best for the children they love. Com¬
puters and their languages should be accessible to such peo¬
ple, easy for them to use as a casual, creative medium. If they
are not so, the children of the world will not be properly
served.

<![CDATA[
One lucky day, Peggy and I showed her BEACH
microworld to two such men, Mamadou Niang and Moussa
Gning. These gentlemen, Senegalese teachers who had come
the New York Logo Center for an introduction to computers
and the Logo programming language, were engaged by these
microworlds I had made for my daughter. . They told me
that the Senegalese people are much concerned with the issue
of literacy and hoped that computers could make learning
the written word more congenial to the children of their na¬
tion. Their colleague and technical adviser, Mme Sylla
Fatimata, later explained the importance computers could
have to their children in this way.
The children of Senegal typically live in a personal, warm
family setting until they are of school age. At home, they live
and grow in the culture of their traditional languages, such
as Wolof. At school age, they go off to a cold and impersonal
place where all the language and all the lessons are French.
Some children survive and thrive there, but many are ter¬
rified and refuse to learn. For them, learning in school means
alienation from the people they love, and they reject that
alienation even though they are encouraged to adopt it.
French is the dominant language through which the
Senegalese deal with the exterior world. It is the language of
opportunity within the government and commerce. Further,
it is the language which has dominated the schools and con¬
tinues to do so. The Senegalese intend to protect and advance
their traditional languages by turning the tide of modern
technology to their own use, specifically by developing
literacy in Wolof among their children. Although Wolof has
been written in an extended Roman alphabet for more
than a hundred years, only during the last decade has the
transcription of the language become standardized
throughout the country. Consequently, and ironically, many
learned people of their land, literate in French and even
Arabic, are illiterate in their traditional language, the
language they use in their homes and in conversation with
their African colleagues at work.
Wanting to change this situation, the Senegalese believe
they might better create programs for computer use in Wolof
than in French or in the language of whoever makes the
machines, and they have good reasons. Because there exists
now no rigid "curriculum" for computer education in
French, and because they have not invested years in teacher
training in French language computer instruction, they im¬
agine correctly that this new technology has a revolutionary
potential which can be used to support their traditional
language and culture if they but seize the opportunity.
With others of the Senegal Microcomputer Project,
Mamadou Niang and Moussa Gning came to extend their in¬
troduction to Logo in Parisat the World Center for Com¬
putation and Human Development. Because there is no bet¬
ter way to learn how to use a computer language than to use
it for some significant purpose, I offered Mamadou this
challenge, "You imagine some such microworld for the
children of Senegal, and I will help you make it; let's work
together to make something your young students will love."
Mamadou noted that, of course, there are beaches in Senegal
and the great city of Dakar, but that since an objective of
their work was to appeal to all the children of Senegal, it
would be more appropriate to think of images of the coun¬
tryside. He proposed a village backdrop, with some small
buildings and a well. To enliven such a scene, one would need
people and the animals of the country life, perhaps a cat,
horses, cows and so on. We agreed to make only a few ob¬
jects, and thereby leave for the children the pleasure of crea¬
tion; we would let them decide what they wanted in their
worldand provide the tools for them to make it.
Since we come from cultures so much apart, it is ap¬
propriate to comment on our way of working together. We
laboured to share ideas. Our working tongue, our lingua
franca, was French: after all, in Paris tout le monde parle
22
français. Mamadou and Moussa spoke French much better
than I did. I was grateful that they would tolerate my poor
French so that we could work together. The computer we us¬
ed was an English language Logo computer. When they suc¬
ceeded in helping me understand their objectives, I would
propose and demonstrate programming capabilities and
techniques to embody what Mamadou wanted in the
microworld. In a kind of "pidgin" language, French,
English, computerese, they began to program with my
guidance a little scene, some designs of objects to fit in that
scene, and some computer procedures to control their ap¬
pearance and actions.
When we had created a scene with a number of French
language procedure names-^when we had the conceptual ob¬
jects of this world more or less under controlwe began to
discuss using Wolof. This is where Moussa played a most
significant role. As the leading primary-grade pedagogue for
Wolof instruction in Senegal, he was able with confidence to
assign definitive spellings to the procedure names we used to
create and manipulate the objects of our village microworld.
(Sometimes this involved consultation with the others of the
Senegalese delegation, including the linguist, Pathé Diagne.)
Because the Logo language permits any string of
"keyable" symbols to be the name of a procedure, we were
able to convert French-named procedures such as
"SOLEIL" and "MARCHE" to their Wolof equivalents,
"JANT" and "DOXAL" (the "X" is pronounced as in
Spanish). Thus we arrived at the assembly of procedures and
designs capable of producing the village microworld,
"XEW". (The sound of the name "XEW", meaning
"scene", begins with the Spanish "X" and rhymes with the

English "HOW".)
If the village microworld seems bare and crude, there is
good reason. It was not made to impress programmers or
civil servants. It is less a product than a project with a few
examples of what is possible. This world is one to be created
by the children of Senegal. Why should I tell them what they
want? Why should even their teachers tell them what
creatures and people to put in the worlds of their
imaginations?
It was Mamadou who best expressed the right way of view¬
ing the village microworld. When I said that the design of
"FAS" was incredible, looked ever so little like a horse, he
replied, "I'm sure the children will make a better one."
After their introduction to Logothrough the adaptation

of ideas for their country my colleagues have returned to
Senegal to begin a pilot project with children in the ex¬
perimental classes of the Ecole Normale Supérieure. The
first of the ideas that have been important in progress to this
point was the adoption of Logo as their preferred computer
language. Choosing Logo was important because Logo per¬
mits the definition of new computer procedures and because
the language is both powerful and accessible. The second is
the commitment to congeniality, to adapting ideas to max¬
imize their applicability in terms of their own culture. This
is the dimension where accessibility of the programming
language to amateurs is important. Parents, teachers, and
older children may know best what children will accept and
love to learn.
The progress of the project in Senegal depends on
understanding and extending studies now underway at the
Ecole Normale Supérieure in Dakar. It also depends on the
availability of suitable computer equipment. Their brave ex¬
periment could be one of the most important in the world;
it deserves watching and support.

The computer
generation
by O. Glissant, J.C. Maillard and M. Vertes
A S a result of the multitude of
Z\ possibilities opened up by the
¿ M. computer, human societies are
today moving firmly towards a greater
mastery ofscience and technology. But
is this development not leading us to
neglect ourpast, our origins, so that we
are deprived ofour artistic and cultural
heritage as we try to reduce the uncer¬
tainties of our future?
To answer this question we mustfirst
consider the advantages of the com¬
puter and assess the ways in which our
world is being transformed by infor¬
matics, before trying to define the rela¬
tionship between our past and this new
technology.
The computer can perform a series of
identical operations in which only the
data vary. By considerably reducing the
number of tedious and repetitious tasks
that have to beperformed, it saves time
and increases the productivity of the
brain. Because of the computer's abili¬
ty to do a very large number ofcalcula¬
tions at high speed, its user can examine
the problem in hand more deeply in¬
stead ofhaving to face the drudgery of
doing the calculations himself. But it
should never be forgotten that the
microcomputer is simply a tool which is
only capable of repeating and
remembering what the user has taught
it. Systematic use of the computer leads
to a situation in which it carries out a
number of tasks which the user could
easily perform himself. Perhaps the
computer-habit is causing man to lose
awareness of some of his possibilities.
It might be thought that over-use of the
computer could cause computer-
dependence, resulting in a loss of in¬
tellectual freedom and the risk ofmen¬
tal atrophy. Excessive use of the com¬
puter could also cut off the user from
the world around him.
The appearance of the computer in
schools is, however, leading to an ir¬
reversible technological and socio¬
logical change. We no longer acquire
knowledge in itself; we acquire access
to knowledge by means of the com¬
puter. Informatics is thus an inter¬
mediary between man and knowledge.
In the United States a number of
schools have already been created on
24
77/F C0/lPt/7ER is ß 100(....
this basis, with computers teaching
basic reading skills and arithmetic and
performing other tasks formerly car¬
ried out by teachers. Thus methods of
work in schools have progressed con¬
siderably; instead of people solving
problems, programmes are perfected in
order to solve them. The real benefit of
a programmable machine lies not in its
problem-solving capacities but in the
thinking that goes into the programm¬
ing. This thinking consists of breaking
down an operation into a series of di¬
rectives which can befed directly to the
computer.
The computer thus seems a
remarkable means ofliberating the user
from drudgery. In a similar way, man
might like to break free from the con¬
straints of tradition which hamper his
unending searchfor a betterfuture. But
what would be the value of a future
built on no foundations? If man loses
contact with his roots, with all that
makes up his culture and personality,
all that makes him both different from
and interdependent with other people,
what can he expectfrom afuture which
may be more or less well organized
apart from a material comfort which is

derisory in comparison with the
decadence which may well pervade his
mind? Scientific development can in no
way replace the role played by our ar¬
tistic and cultural past.
But in this case, is the impact of the
computer on man not a harmful one?
We wonder, on the contrary, whether
the use of the computer, which has
spread to so many of the modern sec¬
tors of the economy, could be extended
to the traditional fields of culture and
man's investigation of his roots. Can
the study of the past be computerized?
Will the conquests of technology give
us a better grasp of history? Is this
desirable?
Technically there is no reason why
the computer should not be used for
these purposes. The diffusion of
culture through the combined action of
informatics and telecommunications is
perfectly feasible. The most insignifi¬
cant piece of information is now at our
disposal, and the computer should even
make more information accessible to
more people. The way thus lies open to
the democratization of culture. Man
has within his reach the means of at¬
taching a new value to his collective
past through the availability of this
information.
If we want the computer's benefits to
reach everyone, we should not limit its
use to scientific activities. The use of.
the computer should be extended to
traditional, cultural and artistic fields
of activity in order to increase our
knowledge of the origins of mankind.

can be derived from the past.
So far these possibilities have been
insufficiently explored. But the com¬
puter's high level of rationality, which
carries the risk ofblunting our sensibili¬
ty to nature, art and culture, should not
be an insuperable obstacle. Such
obstacles have always been overcome in
the long history of human progress.

Communications
technology
and development
by Ithiel de Sola Pool
ITHIEL DE SOLA POOL, U.S. educator, has
been professor ofpolitical science at the Mas¬
sachusetts Institute of Technology since
1953. A fellow of the American Academy of
Arts and Sciences, he is the authorofa number
of books on communications, including Talk¬
ing Back (7373,1, Handbook of Communication
(1973)andTbe Social Impact of the Telephone
11976). The present article has been extracted
from "Technology and Change in Modern
Communication", a document prepared for
the International Commission for the Study of
Communication Problems.
THE developing countries of the
world require large injections
of technology transfer in the
form of information if they are to have
economic growth and development.
The means for this, however, have been
largely beyond their reach. Today a
chasm separates the research facilities
available in developed countries from
the extremely limited research facilities
in most of the world.
With the development of informa¬
tion retrieval technology, the gap could
worsen, unless methods are devised to
facilitate information transfer by new
means. Given lack of money and skills
poor countries cannot be expected to
acquire comprehensive data bases;
however, as low cost global data net¬
works become available, they will per¬
mit remote access to the best informa¬
tion sources that exist.
If as seems likely, international data
communications networks make access
to data bases available from anywhere
in the world at communications costs
Unesco's international programme
for the development of communication
rHE International Programme for the Development
of Communication (IPDC) was established by a
unanimous decision taken by the community of
Member States of Unesco at the 21st session of its General
Conference, held in Belgrade, Yugoslavia in- 1980. Its
statutes, rules ofprocedure and plans for future action are
therefore the result of a consensus of opinion among the
thirty-five nations which constitute its Intergovernmental
Council and have the support of the Member States of the
Organization.
This governing body has been given a challenging man¬
date. Composed of representatives proportionally divided
among the Member States from all geographical regions of
the world, this body has been called upon to work out,
finance and implement a practical programme in order to
reduce the existing gaps in communication within, as well as
among nations. It must be proved that it is possible, in spite
ofpolitical differences, to arrive at concrete and constructive
decisions through co-operation and a willingness to listen
and learn from each other.

Objectives
The main objectives of the IPDC are:
to identify the needs and priority areas for the information and
communication development plans in developing countries;
to promote, in these countries and in accordance with their com¬
munication policies, the creation or extension of infrastructures for
the different communication sectors as well as improved interna¬
tional exchange of information;
to analyse the technical and financial needs and resources in the
fields of information and communication at the national and inter¬
national levels;
to ensure better co-ordination and reciprocal consultation among
parties interested in the development of communication;
to secure funds, from both public and private sectors, to support
these activities;
to strengthen co-operation and co-ordination of Unesco's ac¬
tivities with other Specialized Agencies concerned, especially with
the International Telecommunication Union (ITU);

less than that of the mails at present,
the information gap could rapidly be
narrowed. A researcher in a university
or planning office in a country without
adequate reference sources of its own
could retrieve a fact from a data base
anywhere in the world for a communica¬
tion charge little more than the cost of
a domestic telephone call.
In short, as advanced countries in¬
creasingly transfer their reference
materials from hard copy libraries to
computerized retrieval systems, the
underdeveloped countries will either
fall further behind in . information
capacity, or will begin to catch up
depending upon whether they are link¬
ed to these new information stores by
telecommunications .
One common reaction to such sug¬
gestions for sustained interaction is
fear of dependency. But in-fact the use
of the best scientific knowledge has the
reverse effect. Given access to advanc¬
ed knowledge, practitioners in less ad¬
vanced locations will more quickly ac
quire the skills to become independent.
Suppose medical advice was provid¬
ed to practitioners by global on-line
query to data bases, and if necessary to
live specialists. Medical practitioners
everywhere would quickly improve
their competence. Suppose that a new
country linked its computer centre on
line to a global network. Gradually, but
fairly rapidly, young programmers and
analysts would learn new skills. Doing
things that they could not otherwise
have done, they would develop expertise
to promote viable regional communication institutions, establish¬
ed with Unesco's assistance and which may play an extensive role
in the planning and execution of regional projects within the
programme;
to provide consultative and advisory services to developing coun¬
tries in the field of communication;
to sensitize all parties concerned (be they developing or developed
countries, international organizations and agencies of the United
Nations system, non-governmental organizations or other public
and private bodies active in this area) to the important role played
by communication in the development process;
to encourage maximum co-operation and concentration of ef¬
forts among those interested in communications development;
to support the exchange of information, programmes and ex¬
perience among media agencies, especially in developing countries;
to prepare studies based on experience gained in international co¬
operation in the domain of information and communication
development, particularly between developing and developed
countries.
International dissemination and
exchange of information by global
satellite systems
A worldwide experiment in the transmission of televised news sup¬
ported by Unesco's International Programme (IPDC) for' the
Development of Communication is due to start operating early in
1983, the World Communications Year.
This is one of three interregional projects planned within the
framework of the IPDC, the two others being: a study of the ap¬
plication of communication technology to rural areas, and the
establishment of a Centre for the study of communications, energy
and space technologies. Some twenty regional projects have also
been approved, as have a number of national projects in fifteen
countries.
The project has the support of the regional broadcasting unions,
both INTELSAT and INTERSPUTNIK having agreed in principle
to take part in the experiment. Field studies, data-gathering mis¬
sions and regional meetings have been held in Africa, Asia and the
Arab States.
The project is planned in two stages: first, an experimental
demonstration, and second, global interconnexion through the per¬
manent leasing of transponders for collection and dissemination of
television news and programmes.
The experimental demonstration will provide a simulated test of
exchanges within and between these regions, as well as an oppor¬
tunity to monitor the operation of their systems and their gradual
integration with the present inter-union satellite exchange systems.
Since March 1982, a substantial amount of planning for the ex¬
perimental period has been done by the broadcasting unions, the
central co-ordinator and Unesco's Division of Free Flow of Infor¬
mation and Communication Policies. The experiment is scheduled
to run for an initial eight-week period to test co-ordination pro¬
cedures and gauge its effect on viewers.

that they otherwise would not have had.
They will start upgrading their own soft¬
ware and developing their own data
bases. They will be conquering the main
barrier to entering the computer game,
namely the lack of trained humans with
access to modern facilities.
Another objection often raised to
developing countries investing in
modern communications is that they
should be using intermediate rather than
high technology. They must learn to
walk, it is said, before they learn to run.
Poor countries, it is said, have
unemployed labour and very little
capital; they should use labour intensive
processes, like hand-set newspapers, not
capital intensive ones like computer
composition. Besides that, it is argued,
they should use things that they can
make themselves (like the Indian
chicken wire SITE antennas), not things
that they have to import. Also, it is
said and this is more to the point
that there exist in every society tradi¬
tional forms of communication, like
folksingers, plays or sermons and that
these have a credibility and mean-
ingfulness in the culture which no im¬
ported impersonal form can have.
AJÍ of those arguments and par¬
ticularly the last have a great deal of
merit, but the cliché so easily leaped to,
that high technology communications
are inappropriate to developing coun¬
tries, is a non-sequitur. Suppose that
when the transistor radio first came into
use someone had said that developing
countries should not use that advanced
technology, but should stick with con¬
ventional tube radios. We can see that
transistor radios were cheaper, more
reliable, easier to produce indigenously,
more portable, and used less current.
They were what developing countries
needed and as a result they spread
everywhere. Thanks to the transistor,
radio has become the developing
world's most pervasive medium.
It would be a mistake for poor coun¬
tries to simply imitate the media institu¬
tions and practices of wealthier ones. In
the United States and Europe, TV is a
household good; in India it has been
adapted to a village facility. In the West
broadcasting is done almost entirely
over the air; in China it was first done
via wired loudspeakers. Since wired
loudspeakers do not incur the monthly
cost for batteries, a wired system was an
appropriate early choice.

serve an underdeveloped area effectively
it must have certain characteristics. It
should serve as an adjunct to expression
by those persons who have credibility in
the culture. It should use the language
and the symbols of the culture. Its con¬
tents should be capable of local adapta¬
tion. It must be cheap. It should require
as little foreign exchange as possible. It
must also be reliable, relatively rugged,
and not require highly sophisticated
maintenance and operating personnel. It
must operate even in the absence of an
elaborate infrastructure of stable elec¬
tric current, nationwide microwave
relays or cable networks, and smoothly
functioning telephone service. Finally it
must link the underdeveloped region to
any possible sources of data, not just to
ones in a favoured métropole on which
it is dependent.
These are not insoluble requirements.
There are high technologies, in¬
termediate technologies, and primitive
technologies that meet many of these
requirements, and there are high, in¬
termediate, and primitive technologies
that fail. Equipment in remote loca¬
tions, where skilled maintenance men
are few, should be highly reliable.
Sometimes that favours solid state elec¬
tronics (as in telephone switching);
sometimes that favours manual
methods. Developing countries have
little foreign exchange for capital im¬
ports. Sometimes they can make ad¬
vanced equipment for themselves, as in
the case of the SITE ground station
dishes; sometimes they cannot. Such
considerations need to be looked at in
detail in each instance. They cannot be
bypassed by a verbal cliché about high
or intermediate technology.
Among the communications devices
that are most useful in developing areas
are some well-tried means like a folk
singer, or a traditional opera; some
simple technological devices like a
mimeograph machine, a slide projec¬
tor, a wall newspaper, a super-8 movie

camera, or a wired loudspeaker; and
some very sophisticated devices like
transistors, electronic telephone swit¬
ching, satellites and computer data net¬
works. The value of the simple devices
is recognized. What is sometimes
denied is how well some of the new
technologies match the requirements of
poor lands.
International computer communica¬
tions, using store and forward message
switching, is a technology particularly
well . suited to the need of the less
developed countries. It bypasses,
rather than being dependent upon the
problems of the ordinary phone
system. For a voice telephone call, both
parties have to be simultaneously pre¬
sent which can be very frustrating if it
takes a couple of hours to complete the
circuit. In a store and forward system
the message waits in the transmitting
computer until the circuit is available
and then gets sent to its destined ter¬
minal at any hour of the day or night.
Furthermore, low cost satellite
receivers can be installed in remote
regions, bypassing non-existent or
overloaded microwave or cable land
lines. Moreover, sophisticated data
processing operations can be done by
remote access to locations where the
prerequisites exist. All that the local
service must provide is the capability of
carrying low speed code such as that
which currently delivers telex or
telegrams.
A four-media communication sys¬
tem seems likely to be appropriate in
poor countries, particularly those with
large terrain and scattered villages. The
four media that seem most important
are radio, satellite TV, satellite
telephone, computer store and forward
message delivery.
Radio is found everywhere. Tele¬
vision adds something to the effec¬
tiveness of educational broadcasting
and to the quality of village life.
However, it is too expensive to be own¬
ed by many individuals. Its appropriate
use in the poorest areas is as a com¬
munity facility. Where territories are
small and densely populated, terrestrial
transmission to the village set is
economic, but where the territory is
large. and dispersed, the appropriate
means of dissemination is by satellite as
pioneered by the Canadians with their
programmes to the Arctic, and by the
Indians in the SITE programme.
Telephony to remote locations can be
delivered in the same way.
A sound development policy is one
that creates communications facilities
not only for the use of the central
authorities, but also for the use of
organizers at all levels. A single public
telephone call box in a village provides
a way of getting help in emergencies
and of putting villagers in touch with
their market. A tape recorder can be a
useful instrument for getting feedback
from illiterate villagers. Other grass
roots media include mimeographed
newspapers. Provincial broadcasting is
important to countries like Nigeria
where regional, tribal, and language
differences are great. Voices talking in
a strange accent from a remote capital
are less credible than a local man who
will be seen again the next day, and who
will have to answer his neighbours
about what he said.
Too little study has been done on
possible use of such devices as the
telephone or video recorder at the
lowest rural levels. When developing
countries invest in telephone develop¬
ment it is usually to improve the service
in the capital and between the capital
and other major towns. Large amounts
are being spent on such programmes,
and for good reason. They generally
show a high return on capital, reflec¬
ting the high demand for telephone ser
vice. Such market -guided telephone in¬
vestments, however, are rarely oriented
in a major way to giving a voice to
villagers who want to speak to nearby
villages or to their district town. A rural
village in a poor country is usually a
tightly settled community where
everyone is on top of everyone else.
The last need they are likely to feel is
for a telephone in each house to talk to
each other. The main function of
village telephones is to allow villagers
to be in touch with the market town and
district officials. It is two-way com¬
munication; it allows the local nurse, or
teacher, to make a request to their
superiors as well as to receive instruc¬
tions. It allows the farmer to enquire
about the price on the market or ask
whether the fertilizer has arrived. A
single community phone may be ade¬
quate for years, and may be used only
three or four times a day, but still
thereby change the life of the village.
That, at least, is the finding of the few
studies of rural telephony that have yet
been made. It is a subject that calls for
more attention.
Opportunities for using communica¬
tions to accelerate development are
waiting to be picked up. There are three
important sets of developments. It is
becoming cheaper and easier to get
mass media to the population because
of low cost cameras and video editing
equipment, satellites and low cost
ground stations along with parallel
developments in publishing. Secondly,
international data networks are
eliminating geography as a barrier to
access to the world's best information
resources; users can be on line to them
from anywhere. Third, satellites and
solid state electronics make two-way
communication more feasible for even
the most remote villages, bringing them
into the national system.

The sky's the limit
OF all the applications of space
technology, satellite com¬
munications is the most widely
used. First utilized for intercontinental
communication, satellites are now used
primarily for international communica¬
tion. However, they are also being used
by a growing number of countries for
domestic communication.
Satellites for international communica¬
tion are operated by INTELSAT (Interna¬
tional Telecommunications Satellite
Organization), EUTELSAT (European
Telecommunications Satellite Organiza¬
tion) and INTERSPUTNIK (International
System and Organization of Space Com¬
munications). A global maritime com¬
munication system, INMARSAT (Interna¬
tional Maritime Satellite Organization),
went into operation early in 1 982. Some
countries have their own operational
domestic satellite communication sys¬
tems (Canada, India, Indonesia, USA and
USSR); many others have plans to set up
such systems soon.
A communication satellite is simply a
wholly self-contained electronic switch¬
board in orbit around the Earth. There is
one particular orbit, 35,800 kilometres
above the Earth's equator, in which a
satellite travels at a speed which keeps
pace exactly with the Earth's rotation. To
an observer standing on the equator a
satellite in this "geostationary orbit"
therefore appears to remain fixed in the
sky directly overhead. By the use of pro¬
perly designed antennas and electronic

communication equipment, such a sat¬
ellite can be used to relay telephone,
television, numerical data and facsimiles
between any two points on Earth which
can "see" the satellite. Since each
satellite can be seen from over a third of
the Earth's surface, such satellites can
provide a complete global communica¬
tions network, ablento link any two
"ground stations" with each other.
In the early days of space flight,
satellites were severely limited in mass
(and therefore in capability) by the
rockets used to launch them into space.
The ground stations needed to interact
with these satellites were therefore big,
complex and expensive. With the advent
of modern, high-performance rocket
launchers and, perhaps even more impor¬
tant, the development of microelectronic
circuitry, communication satellites today
not only can handle thousands of
simultaneous telephone calls and many
television programmes, but also can
transmit to and receive from relatively
small, inexpensive Earth stations. This
development, called "complexity inver¬
sion" because the most complex equip¬
ment has moved from the ground into the
sky, is of considerable importance to the
developing nations, who now have ac¬
cess to the global INTELSAT network at
relatively low cost. It is far easier,
therefore, for a developing nation to build
low-cost ground stations and use the in¬
expensive satellite network circuit than
to build a complete infrastructure of
ground-based, hard-wire and microwave
communication systems over their often
difficult terrain.
As a result of the rapid development in
satellite communication technology and
the complexity inversion that went along
with it, the per-channel cost of com¬
munications has decreased dramatically,
even in the face of worldwide inflation.
But despite the low per-channel cost
and the availability of inexpensive earth
stations, the capital costs associated
with the setting up of a satellite com¬
munications system are still substantial
for many developing countries.
Communication plays a key role in
development, to the extent that it
transfers information, data and ideas. It
is one of the principal elements in social
advancement and economic develop¬
ment. It is therefore desirable that
developing countries examine in detail
the importance of satellite communica¬
tion (especially to and from rural areas) as
an integral element of their development.
In rural communications, for example,
the need is generally for only a small
number of channels. However, most ex¬
isting satellite systems are not designed
for this application; instead, they are in¬
tended to carry the high-density, inter¬
city traffic, and therefore their use for
rural communication is "sub-optimal".
For promoting rural communication, it is
thus necessary that systems be specially
designed to receive low-power signals,
to transmit concentrated beams at high
power, and to provide on-board signal ,
regeneration and switching whenever
feasible. Further,, ground terminals
should be as inexpensive as possible and
be capable of operating from standard
batteries. Current developments in
enhancing satellite on-board capability
are leading in this direction; inexpensive
ground stations as small as wrist-
watches appear to be possible in the near
future.

Community radio for Kenya
by Jack Mills and James Kangwana
ATthe beginning ofMay 1 982, the
Homa Bay Community Broad¬
casting Station in Kenya's
Nyanza province started regular
transmission in the local language,
Luo. Manned by a producer from the
national Voice of Kenya (VOK) net¬
work and three assistants, the station
puts out one-hour daily programmes
covering local news, problems of health
and family planning, as well as news in
Kiswahili relayed from VOK.
Most of the programme materials are
gathered through interviews in the
market place, on farms, in schools and
with organized groups like the local
women's organization.
Homa Bay is a town of some 10,000
people, situated on the shores of Lake
Victoria about 430 kilometres by road
west of Nairobi. The main occupation
of the people is farming, especially
cattle rearing, and fishing. The town
was chosen as the site for a Unesco
community broadcasting project, the
aims of which were to establish in an
African country a low-cost rural broad¬
casting station with equipment design¬
ed and built with the full participation
of staff from the host country. The
system was to provide an alternative to
the usually expensive imported broad¬
casting equipment which sometimes
proves equally expensive to operate and
maintain.
The Unesco project was designed to
take account of a situation in which
sound broadcasting faces many prob¬
lems. In terms of coverage and utiliza¬
tion, the medium is more important
than television in African countries,
but even so the continent has only
about 3 per cent of the world's trans¬
mitters, and on average only about 7
per cent of the population has access to
broadcasts from these transmitters,
which are generally located in or near
to towns and cities. Very few transmit¬
ters cater specifically for the rural areas
where most of the population lives and
where the need for the benefits of com¬
munication infrastructure is greatest.
The principal concern of the Unesco
project was the provision of nationwide
coverage at least cost to the economy.
JACK M ILLS, of Ghana, is a consultant to the
Economic Council for Africa (ECA) and to
Unesco. He was formerly chief engineer and
deputy director-general of the Ghana Broad¬
casting Corporation.
JAMES KANGWANA, of Kenya, is project
co-ordinator of Unesco's Manpower Develop¬
ment Project for East Africa. He was formerly
director of the Voice of Kenya ¡VOK).
The extension of sound broadcasting
to rural communities can be achieved
by equipping the centralized national
network with more powerful transmit¬
ters. However, this is not the most
satisfying solution because the output
is seldom related to the needs of the
rural community it purports to- serve.
Programmes originating from the
towns and cities and beamed to the
rural dweller have often failed to
achieve their objective, for a number of
reasons.
Firstly, very few African countries
have a common language which can be
used for effective communication with
their rural populations. In some coun¬
tries there may be over sixty different
rural languages and numerous dialects.
The best that the broadcasting orga¬
nizations can do under these cir¬
cumstances is to select what are con¬
sidered the main languages or ver¬
naculars, usually not more than -ten,
and broadcast daily programmes in
these languages on a time division
basis. Thus no one community listens
to the language it understands for more
than a few minutes a day.
Secondly, the local language pro¬
grammes are often produced by city
dwellers who are not fully acquainted
with the way of life of the rural popula¬
tion and do not fully understand its
needs. The result is that listeners even¬
tually lose interest in the programmes.
Thirdly, the distance of some rural
areas from the national transmitters are
such that only weak and unintelligible
signals are received.
Hence there is a strong need for
technologically independent, commu¬
nity-centred systems which are capable
of being hooked up to the national
system by microwave links or off-the-
air pick-ups. However, the cost of do¬
ing this using current technology can be
prohibitive for most African countries.
One of the aims of the Unesco project
was to show that the engineering and
technology required for the production
of broadcasting equipment need not be
as costly as the price of imported ar¬
ticles would indicate.
The project involved a series of
feasibility and costing studies, as well
as the study of sound broadcasting
systems currently in use in 1 1 African
countries. Following this groundwork,
Kenya was chosen as the host country
for the on-site fabrication and testing
of a model broadcast Audio Mixer; the

and testing of a low-power
transmitter; the installation of the com¬
pleted equipment in a rural location;
and the carrying out of a field strength
survey of the model station.
It was decided that the station should
use an easy-to-maintain, low output
power, VHF/FM transmitter. Power
consumption with this type of transmit¬
ter is low and it could therefore be
powered by solar energy. VHF/FM
had various other advantages, in¬
cluding simplicity of construction. On
the other hand, the main' disadvantage
of VHF transmission is that its pro¬
pagation is by "line of sight"; because
of this, nearby hills and mountains
form obstacles to the waves, thereby
"shielding" would-be reception areas
from the transmissions. Medium waves,
which rely on "ground waves" for their
propagation, do not suffer this defect.
The approach was tó produce equip¬
ment using a technology that would not
be too unfamiliar to engineers in the
African broadcasting organizations,
but that would at the same time make
use of new electronic circuit tech¬
niques. The objective here is an educa¬
tional oneto enable the engineers to
use some of these new techniques to
build similar equipment in their own
establishments, thereby cutting down
on the cost of imported electronic
equipment.
In line with this approach, the use of
operational amplifiers with discrete
components was chosen as a means of
introducing integrated circuits, which
will be the inevitable choice in future
design where low cost and simplicity
are the main objectives. The advantage
of the discrete design is that it in¬
troduces the principle of operational
amplifiers which are the building
blocks of integrated circuits. An elec¬
tronic building block was developed
which is versatile enough to be used
throughout the Audio Mixer for
microphone, gramophone, tape and
other input channels. Printed circuit
boards were used because they simplify
assembly and enable the sub-sections of
the design to be repeated.
Unesco was responsible for training
the African engineers and technicians
in charge of the project and provided
all the parts for the construction of the
Audio Mixer and the Transmitter.
Almost all the electronic components
used in the Mixer were imported, their
total cost amounting to $566. The
Transmitter is a direct VHF/FM
transmitter with a power output of 10
watts. Again almost all the component
parts were ordered direct from
overseas. The main transmitter unit
cost $266.72, the power unit $70.90.
Work on the fabrication of the Mixer
and the Transmitter went quite
smoothly. The sixteen channel modules
for the Mixer and the power supply unit
were completed within four weeks of
the start of the work, 24 June 1 98 1 , and
the assembly of the modules on the
32
"mother board" and testing were com¬
pleted three days later. The supplying
and cutting to size of the Mixer's metal
panels and the drilling of holes accord¬
ing to drawings and spraying were done
in the workshops of Kenya Railways.
Preliminary testing of the transmit¬
ter in Nairobi revealed that the signal
could be received about two kilometres
away. The complete station was then
transported on a VOK bus to Homa
Bay for the final test. The equipment
was installed in the Kenya National
Union of Teachers building.
With a mast height of 24.4 metres,
the coverage area includes the whole of
Homa Bay township. The farthest
places reached by adequate signals
(about 2 mV/m) are Gendia, a health
post 27.5 kilometres from Homa Bay,
and Kirindo, a State Irrigation Project
site 23.5 kilometres away.
Installation work at Homa Bay was
not as smooth as the fabrication work
in Nairobi. Almost all the installation
material had to be brought from the
capital since the local stores do not
stock materials for which local demand
is non-existent. On the other hand, the
local artisans were found to be quite
good, provided the materials they re¬
quired for their work were supplied. All
the woodwork for the studio acoustical
system was done by local artisans.
Before broadcasting began, a detail¬
ed cultural and socio-economic profile
of Homa Bay was prepared by a
Unesco consultant. This was followed
by training of three producers by
another Unesco specialist. Training
covered studio operations; announcing
techniques; preparation and recording
of interviews and discussions; recor¬
ding of singing groups inside and out¬
side the studio; and orientation on rural
and community programming. At pre¬
sent the station broadcasts between
5.45 p.m. when farmers and other
workers are expected to be back at
home, and 7.00 p.m., but a more ex¬
tensive programme schedule will come
into operation when the station is of¬
ficially commissioned.
On the whole, the objectives of the
project have been achieved. Although
the locally fabricated equipment lacks
the sophistication and complexity of
the imported type, tests have shown
that its performance is not below that
of imported counterparts; it can be
used to achieve the same objectives at
much lower .cost.
Although the station has not been of¬
ficially commissioned, requests are
already being received from owners of
FM receivers for certain programmes
to be repeated and in some cases special
music to be played back. Some of the
residents even walk into the studio and
ask to be interviewed about their work
and life.
Rural broadcasting as envisaged by
the project is new in Kenya, and new
for that matter in almost the whole of
Africa. It is hoped that with time and
the present interest being shown by the
people of Homa Bay, it will eventually
achieve its objectives and spread to
other parts of the continent.

MISSING
LINKS
In many parts of the world it is possible to hear the news
from Paris, Moscow or New York and yet not know what is
going on in the next door village. In projects all over the
world Unesco is attempting to forge the "missing links" in
the world communications network.
Old sugar sacks, scraps of cork panels and straw matting were used as
acoustic baffling for' this broadcasting studio (top left) built at the
capital, Praia, by Cape Verde's new educational radio unit. The portrait
on the left hand wall is of Amilcar Cabrai, the architect of Cape Verde's
independence. Nineteen prospective radio producers were trained for
this unit as part of a Unesco-Federal Republic of Germany Educational
Radio Project which also included the installation of new radio transmit¬
ters on the islands of Sao Tiago and Sao Vicente.
Above, near Kotmale, a Sri Lankan radio producer records sounds of the
countryside for mixing into a community radio programme, under a pro¬
ject assisted by Unesco and Danida, the Danish development agency.

(right) and a Tuvaluan technician (centre) prepare cabling for a voltage
stabilizer to power the Tuvalu (formerly the Ellice Islands) national radio
transmitter, provided by Unesco and the United Nations Development
Programme.
A Unesco-sponsored plan for the creation of a unique regional informa¬
tion service will come to fruition when ALASEI (the Latin American
Special Information Services Agency) becomes operational later this
year. The main purpose of the new agency will be to meet the special
needs of Latin American peoples and countries in their advance
towards autonomous endogenous development and to handle informa¬
tion that existing agencies either ignore or deal with incompletely. The
new agency will consist of a series of national and sub-regional bureaux
with journalistic production, editing and distribution functions and a
central office which will handle material from the national offices and
provide "features" on regional topics. ALASEI will be equipped with a
high grade satellite communications system. Right, the convent of San¬
to Domingo, Panama the country in which the ALASEI Action Commit¬
tee is now based.

Poetic justice
Sir,
The Courier continues to impress and
please me with its selection of themes
and the quality of its content.
The issue of November 1 982, "War on
War", is no exception. I do, however,
wish to record some points of criticism.
War and militarism might well have
been put in context. War springs from
and is only one manifestation of violence
in the minds of men, violence which is
nurtured by the structures of our
societies. Yet nowhere in the poetry or
the texts is the word "violence" used. It
is true that the selection from Breyten-
bach makes my point. He is not talking of
war; he is speaking of a violent society.
The same is true of Cardenal .and Faye.
I would have taken "The Covenant" of
Thiago de Mello as the theme piece, and
titled the issue "Warriors against
Violence" (in ourselves, our homes, our
cities, between nations, etc.). It is when
frustration with the basic manifestations
of violence become unbearable that
leaders and people resort to organiz¬
ed war.
Stephen Spender's main point, at the
conclusion of his article, is partially
apropos of my feeling: "Antiwar poetry
is not only against war. It states the
predicament of life against destructive
technology".
While agreeing with much of what
Jean-Jacques Lebel says about poets
and poetry, I take exception to his obser¬
vation that "the other forms of expres¬
sion... have proved incapable of com¬
prehending the present world crisis".
The conceptions, inspirations and
writings of a number of scientists have
contributed beautifully (one might say
"poetically") not only to understanding
but in suggesting paths toward more har¬
monious relationships, man to man, and
man to nature.
John E. Fobes

General of Unesco Editor
Images out of focus
Sir,
I was pleased to see my photograph in
the July 1982 issue of the Unesco
Courier, but dismayed to read its caption.
While I cannot argue with the truth of the
statement in general, that "the children
of migrant and minority groups become
the victims of institutionalized pro¬
cedures that preserve the status quo," I
would reject its application here.
The classroom pictured is a
kindergarten section of the Riverside
Church-Kindergarten School, which
serves the Upper West Side and Harlem
communities in Manhattan. There is pro¬
bably no school setting in the country
freer of racial prejudice. The congrega¬
tion of the church itself is, or was when
my children attended the school, roughly
half black, half white, and racial
minorities are well represented on the
teaching staff. The school deliberately
strives against discrimination, and
evenhandedness in matters of race is an
important policy of the whole institution.
I did not identify my photograph's set¬
ting. Therefore, an editor-would have no
idea where it was taken. Still, I thought I
would let you know that there is such a
place as Riverside Church, and what it
stands for.-
Jeanne Hamilton
New York City
Sir,
In your July 1 982 issue you illustrated
Han Suyin's article with several vivid
photos accompanied by captions. With
reference to the photo captioned "Im¬
migrant workers in the shanty-town at
Saint-Denis", I should like to point out
that you used an out-of-date photo since
the last shanty-town at Saint-Denis was
destroyed and its 5,000 inhabitants
rehoused in a modern estate on the same
site in 1968.
