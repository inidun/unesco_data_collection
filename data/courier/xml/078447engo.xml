Women sculptors
of ancient Ashanti
In the ancient African king¬
dom of Ashanti, bordering
the Gulf of Guinea, an¬
cestor figures exactly por¬
traying the dead person
were traditionally modelled
by women sculptors. The
custom was taken to the
neighbouring Ivory Coast
in the 17th century by
Ashanti immigrants, among
whom 17 leading families
provided women sculptors
for this ritual task. This
terracotta ancestor figure
with its long ringed neck
and mysterious smile has
the hairstyle of an Ashanti
woman. It was found in the
Krinjabo region of the Ivory
Coast. Such statuettes
(never over 50 cm. high)
were known as "Ma-Mot",
meaning "dead person" or
"ancestor", and were pla¬
ced on tombs as dwellings
for the souls of the dead.

RACE
AND I.Q
by Otto Klineberg
The United Nations General
Assembly designated 1971 as
International Year for Action to
Combat Racism and Racial
Discrimination, to be observed
in the name of the ever¬
growing struggle against so¬
cial discrimination in all its
forms and in the name of
international solidarity with
those combatting racism. It
called on all States to co¬
operate in every possible way
in implementing this interna¬
tional campaign and to in¬
tensify and expand their ef¬
forts, at the national and inter¬
national levels, towards ensur¬
ing the rapid and total eradica¬
tion of racial discrimination,
including the policy of apart¬
heid, nazism and all of its
contemporary forms, as well
as other manifestations of
racism. U.N. Secretary-General
U Thant has expressed the hope
that the International Year
Against Racism will bring "a
general recognition that the
theories, ideas and prejudices
which lead to racism and racial
discrimination are unjust and
abhorrent, and that a great
responsibility rests upon all
to eradicate the shameful prac¬
tices which they encourage."
OOME 20 years ago there
was good reason to believe that the
notion of a genetic or inborn racial
hierarchy had practically disappeared
from the thinking of social and bio¬
logical scientists concerned with this
issue. The general position could per¬
haps best be stated in negative terms,
namely that there was no acceptable
scientific evidence in favour of such a
hierarchy, and that consequently any
political or educational programme
based on the alleged innate inferiority
of any racial or ethnic group had no
scientific validity.
Some years earlier (1944) Gunnar
Myrdal and his associates in An
American Dilemma had called for an
educational offensive to reduce the
gap between this position of the social
scientists on the one hand, and that of
the general public on the other. In
the years that followed, it began to
appear that at least in the United
States a real change in this respect
had occurred in the general public.
When a representative sample of
white Americans were asked the ques¬
tion: "In general, do you think that
OTTO KLINEBERG, of Canada, is one of the
world's leading psychologists and authorities
on race relations. He is at present visiting
professor at the Ecole Pratique des Hautes
Etudes at the Sorbonne and director of the
International Centre for Intergroup Relations,
in Paris. Among his long list of publications
are: "Race Differences" (1935), "Negro Intel¬
ligence and Selective Migration" (1935),
'Tensions Affecting International Under¬
standing: A Survey of Research" (1950), and
"The Human Dimension in International Rela¬
tions" (1964). His study, "Race and Psycho¬
logy", first published in 1951, also appeared
in Unesco's "The Race Question in Modern
Science" in 1956. A revised edition of this
book is scheduled to be published next year.
We are happy to publish here passages from
a new chapter In this forthcoming new edition.
Negroes are as intelligent as white
people that is, can they learn things
just as well if they are given the same
education and training" the propor¬
tion answering in the affirmative rose
from 50 per cent in 1942 to almost 80
per cent in 1964 (Hyman & Sheatsley).
It looked as if this particular issue
was dead, or at least dying. Myrdal
went so far as to say in a Nobel
Symposium published in 1970: "The
racial inferiority doctrine has dis¬
appeared, which is an undivided
advance, since it has no scientific
basis."
This "disappearance" is far from
complete, however, and the question of
innate psychological differences con¬
tinues to attract considerable attention,
not only in the United States but else¬
where as well, and not only in the
general public but also among scholars.
In 1962, Carleton S. Coon present¬
ed the theory that human evolution
had occurred more rapidly in Europe
than in Africa, and that as a con¬
sequence modern man emerged in
Europe earlier. With some caution, he
added that though dead men cannot
take intelligence tests, it may be infer¬
red that "the subspecies which first
crossed the evolutionary threshold
into the category of Aiomo sapiens
have evolved the most... and the levels
of civilization attained by some of its
populations may be related pheno¬
mena".
In a comment on this theory, Weyl
and Possony (1963) conclude that
"differences in structure, physique and
mentality among the racial divisions of
mankind can be derived". The context
makes it clear that the innate infer¬
iority of the African is indicated by
his evolution at a later date.
One Is struck by the versatility of

RACE AND I.Q. (Continued)
Inactivating the 'Jensen bombshell'
6
those who insist that there must be
innate psychological differences bet¬
ween racial groups. In many of the
earlier writings of the origin of races,
for example, and also in some mu¬
seums of natural history, one may find
an evolutionary genealogical tree, in
which whites are presented as having
evolved most recently. There the
inference was that Africans were
more primitive and therefore inferior.
In other words, if the African evolved
earlier he is more primitive; if later,
he is inferior because he has had less
time in which to develop.
A second example of this versatility
is found in the interpretation of certain
test results. In 1931, Myrtle McGraw
applied the Bühler Babytests to black
and white infants in the south of the
U.S.A. and found the latter to be su¬
perior. This was interpreted (by others)
as proving that even before culture had
the opportunity to exercise its in¬
fluence, inborn group differences could
still be demonstrated. (McGraw her¬
self in a letter to the American Psy¬
chologist repudiated this interpretation
of her results.)
More recently, Géber and her asso¬
ciates (Géber & Dean, 1957) used the
tests of the Gesell Institute, in New
Haven, U.S.A. on infants in Uganda,
and found them to be definitely in ad¬
vance of the norms established in New
Haven. Weyl and Possony (1963) com¬
ment: "A superficial conclusion from
this might be the mental superiority
at birth of Negro children. Actually,
the reverse is indicated."
Obviously, early rapid development
signifies an inferior brain, more like
that of an animal which quickly rea¬
ches full maturity. Again, if black in¬
fants do poorly on tests, they must be
inferior; if they do well, this indicates
that they will be inferior later.
By far the most striking recent dev¬
elopment in this field striking because
of its identification with a reputable
psychologist at a great university (Uni¬
versity of California at Berkeley) and
also because of the intense public
reaction with which it was received
is represented by the publication in
1969 of a monograph by A. R. Jensen
in the Harvard Educational Review.
In answer to his own question, "How
far can we boost IQ and scholastic
achievement?" Jensen developed the
thesis that genetic factors "may play a
part" in intelligence differences be¬
tween black and white children.
The Harvard Educational Review de¬
voted three whole issues to the views
of Jensen and of his critics, the latter
ranging all the way from temperate dis¬
cussion of his genetic assumptions to
vituperative attacks on his "racist" and
reactionary viewpoint.
The popular press, throughout the
United States and a number of other
countries, seized upon Jensen's thesis
with enthusiasm, and gave it a truly
remarkable amount of publicity. It
seems highly probable that opposition
to the notion of innate psychological
differences between blacks and whites
is not very firmly rooted in the popular
mind.
Another move in a direction similar
to that of Jensen has been made by
William Shockley, Nobel Prize-winning
physicist at Stanford University, also
in California, who urged the National
(U.S.) Academy of Sciences to conduct
extensive research into the problem of
genetic (including racial) intelligence.
Basing his argument in part on the re¬
sults obtained by blacks and whites on
intelligence tests, Shockley insists that
the failure to study the nature of the
genetic potential of the blacks repre¬
sents a profound degree of moral irres¬
ponsibility.
The issue of racial differences in
innate intellectual capacities may not,
therefore, be regarded as entirely re¬
solved. In a series of statements
issued by experts convened by Unesco,
the position taken is that there is no
adequate scientific evidence, based
either on tests or on other varieties
of data, which justifies the conclusion
that such differences exist.
To take only the most recent of
these, dated September 1967, the con¬
clusion is reached that: "The peoples
of the world appear to possess equal
biological potentialities for attaining
any level of civilization", and further
that: "Racism falsely claims that there
is a scientific basis for arranging
groups hierarchically in terms of psy¬
chological and cultural characteristics
that are immutable and innate."
In what follows the attempt will be
made to present and assess the varie¬
ties of evidence related to this thesis,
with particular reference to the results
obtained through the application of
psychological tests.
Article II of the Universal Declara¬
tion of Human Rights affirms:
Everyone is entitled to all the
rights and freedoms set forth in
this Declaration, without distinc¬
tion of any kind, such as race,
colour, sex, language, religion,
political or other opinion, national
or social origin, property, birth or
other status.
One of the obstacles to the realiza¬
tion of this part of the Declaration is
the belief, widely and stubbornly held,
that some races and peoples are in¬
ferior, and that they therefore do not
have the same "rights" as others.
As already noted, scholars and
scientists have in some cases attempt¬
ed to support the argument in favour
of a racial hierarchy. It is curious,
although perhaps understandable, that
those scientists who have expressed
OVERCROWDED CELLS
AND PRISON
DORMITORIES
themselves in this manner, have usually
arrived at the conclusion that their own
people are superior to all others.
Some of the German scholars, for
example, were convinced that the peo¬
ple of Northern Europe excelled the
rest of mankind in intellectual endow¬
ment as well as in character and mora¬
lity. An Italian anthropologist was
equally certain that the peoples of the
Mediterranean were responsible for
most of the great contributions to our
civilization. For some black scholars,
everything good in contemporary civi¬
lization has come out of Africa.
These rival claims do not help us
to arrive at the truth concerning the
relation of race to psychology. We
need a more objective method, a more
certain technique; one that is not so
dependent on purely subjective judg¬
ments as to who has superior intellec¬
tual endowment, or what is a greater

A report of the U.N. Sub-Commission on Prevention of Discrimination and Protection of Minorities, of
the Commission on Human Rights, Is devoted to racial discrimination in South Africa and other territories
In southern Africa. In territories under Portuguese administration, it writes, evidence shows that
"black prisoners are subject to discriminatory treatment. Dormitories are overcrowded and cells very
small. According to witnesses there is a severe lack of medical services and there are instances where
prisoners have been left to die without receiving medical attention." Photo above, though not taken in
Angola or other Portuguese African territories, symbolizes the plight referred to in the U.N. report.
contribution to civilization. We need
proof that is scientifically sound; evi¬
dence that is scientifically acceptable.
Psychologists have developed a
method which, with all its faults,
appears at first glance to have consi¬
derable advantages for this purpose
the psychological test. Instead of hav¬
ing to decide whether a German
scientific discovery represents a high¬
er intellectual achievement than an
Italian painting, the test permits us to
present to a group of Germans and
Italians a series of problems to solve,
and we can then determine who solves
them more quickly and more effec¬
tively.
If someone else doubts our results
he may repeat the study, using the
same or other subjects, and the same
or other tests. If his results agree
with ours, our confidence in them is
increased; if not, we must suspend
judgment until other investigations help
to determine who is right.
This is all that would be necessary
to settle the question of superior and
inferior races if psychological tests
were perfect instruments for the
measurement of native or innate
differences in ability. It is true that
they were accepted as such for
a long time, at least by some psy¬
chologists and educators, as well as
by many laymen. We now know,
however, that they are far from perfect.
The successful solution of the prob¬
lems presented by the tests depends
on many factors the previous experi¬
ence and education of the person
tested, his degree of familiarity with
the subject matter of the test, his
motivation or desire to obtain a good
score, his emotional state, his rapport
with the experimenter, his knowledge
of the language in which the test is
administered and also his physical
health and well-being, as well as on
the native capacity of the person test¬
ed.
It is only when such factors are
"held constant", that is to say, when
they are in essential respects similar
for all subjects tested, that we have
the right to conclude that those who
obtain higher scores on the test are
innately superior to those whose
scores are lower.
This makes it immediately obvious
that we must use great caution in
interpreting the results when a psycho¬
logical test is administered to two
different racial or national groups.
Living under different conditions, dis¬
similar in culture, education and point
of view, such groups may differ widely
in the test results not because they
have an unequal heredity but because
of their unequal social environment.

RACE AND I. Q. (Continued)
Unjustified conclusions from intelligence tests
The great French psychologist
Alfred Binet, who was responsible for
developing the first scale of intelli¬
gence tests in 1905, was aware of this
limitation in the application of his
method. He pointed out that his tests
could safely be used in order to arrive
at inborn differences only if the
various individuals or groups tested
had had substantially the same oppor¬
tunities. Many psychologists neglect¬
ed or forgot Binet's wise counsel, and
drew unjustified conclusions from their
data.
In view of the many ways in which
culture and previous experience may
affect test scores, it is not surprising
to find that the British psychologist
Philip E. Vernon, who has had long
experience in research and teaching in
this field, concludes: "There is no such
thing as a culture-fair test, and never
can be" (1968).
Attitudes toward
the test
One of the major arguments against
the notion of a "culture-fair" or "cul¬
ture-free" test is the fact that groups,
and even individuals, vary greatly in
their attitude toward the test. The
very act of competing against others
in a test situation is itself influenced
by the values and attitudes develop¬
ed in a particular society.
Professor S. D. Porteus in The Psy¬
chology of a Primitive People (1931)
tells of an interesting experience in
administering psychological tests to a
group of Australian aborigines. The
tests were made up of a series of
mazes, the problem consisting of trac¬
ing a pathway through the maze until
the exit was successfully reached.
Each subject was expected to per¬
form the task by himself. This situa¬
tion turned out to be a strange one for
these Australian natives. They are
accustomed to solving their problems
together, in groups. "Not only is every
problem in tribal life debated and set¬
tled by the council of elders but it is
always discussed until a unanimous
decision is reached."
The subjects were frequently puzzled
by the fact that the examiner would
give them no assistance when they
experienced some difficulty in solving
the problem of the maze. This was
particularly true in the case of one
group of natives who had recently
made the psychologist a "blood bro¬
ther" of their own tribe, and they could
not understand why he refused to help
them.
A similar indifference to the kind of
competition taken for granted in Wes¬
tern society was noted by the present
writer in an investigation undertaken
among the Yakima, a tribe of American
Indians living in the state of Washing¬
ton on the U.S. west coast.
The tests used were a group of
performance tests, in which no know¬
ledge of language is necessary, and
the task consists of placing pieces of
wood of various shape into the appro¬
priate areas of a wooden frame "as
quickly as possible". The scores ob¬
tained depend on the speed with which
the task is completed and the num¬
ber of errors made in the process.
These Indian children, however,
never hurried. They saw no reason to
work quickly. Western culture places
a premium on speed, on getting things
done in as short a time as possible;
the Indian children had not acquired
this attitude. They went at their task
slowly and deliberately, with none of
that scrambling impatience that is so
often found among American children.
The Indians, as a consequence, took
much longer to finish the tests, though
they made somewhat fewer errors than
the white Americans with whom they
were compared.
The writer made an analogous
observation among the Dakota (Sioux)
Indians in the state of South Dakota.
There it is regarded as incorrect to
answer a question in the presence of
others who do not know the answer:
this might be interpreted as showing
off, or as bringing shame to" others,
and is consequently condemned by the
whole group.
These Indian children also have de¬
veloped the conviction that it is wrong
to reply to a question unless one is
absolutely certain of the answer. Psy¬
chologists who have given the Binet
test to these children have observed
that they never guess at the answer:
if they are not sure, they keep quiet
indefinitely. This, too, reduces their
scores to a certain extent, since a
guess may succeed, and since credit is
given for an answer that is even partly
correct.
As a final example in this context
may be noted the experience of the
anthropologist Margaret Mead with
Samoan children, and reported in her
Coming-of-Age in Samoa. She was
administering the Binet test, which has
as one of its items the Ball-and-Field
problem. A ball is lost in a circular
field, and the task of the subject is to
trace a pathway along which he would
walk in order to find the ball.
These Samoan children, instead of
tracing the most efficient pathway,
used the occasion to make a pretty
design. Their aesthetic interest was
evidently stronger than their desire to
solve the problem.
These examples all indicate the pos¬
sibility that the cultural background of
the individual may determine his gen¬
eral approach to the test situation in
such a manner as markedly to influ¬
ence his test score.
Even in the case of minority groups
within the same society, such as
American blacks, evidence indicates
that their attitude toward the test, their
motivation to do their best, may not be
similar to what is found in the white
children with whom they are compared.
They are often suspicious of the test
and what it means, and they lack con¬
fidence in their ability to do well.
Attitudes toward the
children tested
Expectations regarding performance
may be important not only for those
who are tested, but also for those who
do the testing and teaching. Clark
' (1963) has presented the view that
culturally disadvantaged (one might
add also culturally different) children
are the unfortunate victims of teachers'
educational self-fulfilling prophecies;
in other words, if children are expect¬
ed to do poorly, they will do poorly.
This hypothesis was tested experi¬
mentally by Rosenthal and Jacobson
and published in Pygmalion in the
Classroom (1968); they gave to tea¬
chers the names of children who alle¬
gedly had done well on a "test for
intellectual blooming" which indicated
that they would show striking gains in
intellectual competence during the next
eight months of school.
Eight months later this experimen¬
tal group, together with a control group
of equal competence whose names
had not been given to the teachers,
were re-tested on the same intelligence
test.
The experimental group those
whom the teachers expected to do
well gained 4 more points in I.Q.
than did the control group; on a
reasoning test, the difference was
7 points. As the authors point out,
the difference between the two groups
was in the mind of the teachers. This
finding appears to be of very real im¬
portance in the comparisons that have
been made, and continue to be made,
between ethnic groups.
The effect of language
One of the clearest and most ob¬
vious ways In which social and edu¬
cational background may influence test
results, is through its effect on lan¬
guage. Most of the psychological tests
in general use, including those devis¬
ed by Binet, are verbal in character.
For the successful solution of the
problems presented, not only must the
subject have an adequate compre¬
hension of the questions asked; not
only must he be able to answer intel¬
ligibly once the solution has been
reached; he must also be able to mani¬
pulate words successfully in order to
reach a solution.
So important is language facility in
many of these tests that psychologists
]]>

<![CDATA[
can often reach quite an accurate
estimate of a subject's mental level
merely by knowing the extent of his
vocabulary. This early led to the con¬
clusion that these intelligence tests
were unfair to the foreign-born, or to
others (like the American Indians in
the United States, for example) who
had inadequate knowledge of the lan¬
guage in which the test was adminis¬
tered. Even if they spoke and used
that language with relative ease, they
were still handicapped if that were
not their native language, or if they
were bilingual.
This was demonstrated years ago.
Welsh children speaking only English
obtained better scores on the Binet
scale than those who spoke both
Welsh and English. In Belgium, the
Walloon children who spoke only
French, were superior to Flemish chil¬
dren speaking both French and Fle¬
mish.
This should not to be interpreted to
mean that bilingualism causes a defi¬
nite or permanent intellectual inferio¬
rity; it more probably is due to the
simple fact that the vocabulary of a
young child is so limited that if he
learns words in two languages, he will
not know so many in either one. With
the passage of time, the handicap due
to bilingualism will be more than com¬
pensated by its undoubted advantages.
The effect ofpoverty
The influence of poverty or of
socio-economic class on test perfor¬
mance cannot be kept separate from
the issues already raised. Low expect¬
ations as to pupil performance may
affect the poor white as well as black;
differences in language patterns have
been demonstrated in the case of the
poor in England (by Bernstein, 1960)
and in the United States (John, 1963).
The fact of poverty and its conse¬
quences acquires importance in this
context because of the proportionately
greater frequency of poverty among
minority groups, and particularly
among the blacks in the United States.
This consideration alone should im¬
pose considerable caution in arguing
from the inferior test results obtained
by black children (an average I.Q. of
85 as compared with the "normal"
100). Research conducted in many
countries and by many psychologists
indicates beyond a shadow of a doubt
that the test performance of poor white
children is markedly inferior to that of
the well-to-do; the difference between
groups at the extremes of the econo¬
mic range is in the neighbourhood of
20 points in I.Q., that is to say, greater
than that between American blacks
and whites.
To this it is retorted that even when
the comparison is between blacks and
whites of the same economic level the
difference, though smaller, still per¬
sists. All that this really means, how¬
ever, is that poverty, although of great
importance, is not the only factor res¬
ponsible.
In a critical review of the research
on ethnic differences in the United
States, Dreger & Miller (1960) correct¬
ly point out that it is not enough to
equate ethnic groups in terms of social
class and economic variables; the dif¬
ference is not solely socio-economic.
They add that even those blacks
whose economic status is higher than
that of most white persons will still in
the majority of cases be prevented
from living the same kind of life in all
respects; many other factors may also
be important.
To return to the effect of poverty,
psychologists have so far not suffi¬
ciently emphasized its role in causing
fundamental impairment to mental de¬
velopment as a consequence of malnu¬
trition.
In a survey of the relation between
nutrition and learning, Eichenwald and
Fry (1969) bring together an impres¬
sive mass of data in this connexion,
based partly on animal experimentation
and partly on observations of the
effects of nutritional deficiencies on
human beings in many parts of the
world, including Africa and Latin
America.
They conclude that malnutrition dur¬
ing a critical period of early life may
"permanently and profoundly affect
the future intellectual and emotional
development of the individual". The
factor of malnutrition appears to be of
fundamental importance in assessing
the intellectual potentialities of poor,
including poor black, people.
The effect of previous
learning and experience
In the early days of testing,
many psychologists believed that the
elimination of the handicap due to
language was equivalent to eliminating
the influence of culture and experience
in general. One psychologist, Profes¬
sor Florence L. Goodenough of the
University of Minnesota, devised a per¬
formance test consisting in "Drawing a
Man"; scores were determined not by
the aesthetic quality of the drawing,
but by the inclusion of the largest pos¬
sible number of essential aspects, by
proper attention to bodily proportions.
She regarded this test as "culture-
free" that is, independent of the pre¬
vious background and experience of
the subjects, and therefore capable of
measuring native differences in intelli¬
gence. In 1926, she conducted a study
by means of this test, and reported
definite differences in the "intelli¬
gence" of various immigrant groups in
the United States, as well as between
whites and Negroes.
Since then, many investigators have
made use of this test, and they have
been able to demonstrate that, contra¬
ry to the earlier view, the results are
indeed affected by many aspects of
previous experience. Professor Good-
enough herself later recognized this
fact, and very honestly and courage¬
ously pointed out her former error.
Writing with Dale B. Harris on "Stu¬
dies in the psychology of children's
drawings" in the Psychological Bulle¬
tin (Sept. 1950) she expresses the
opinion that the search for a culture-
free test, whether of intelligence, ar¬
tistic ability, personal-social characte¬
ristics, or any other measurable trait
is illusory, and ... the naive assumption
that the mere freedom from verbal
requirements renders a test equally
suitable for all groups is no longer
tenable.
More recent evidence along the
same lines comes from a study by
Wayne Dennis (1966) who gave the
Draw-a-Man test to samples of chil¬
dren in approximately fifty different
cultures. Averages ranged from an
I.Q. of 124 for children in American
and English suburbs, in a Japanese
fishing village, and among the Hopi
Indians. The lowest average, 52, was
found in children of a nomadic Bed¬
ouin tribe in Syria; this is explained
by their limited experience In graphic
art. Children of Lebanese Arabs, on
the other hand, with considerable
exposure to Western culture obtained
an average I.Q. of 94.
Qualitative differences
in test performance
Factors related to cultural back¬
ground and previous experience may
also determine qualitative differ¬
ences in the nature of test perfor¬
mance. Strauss (1954), for example,
found that university students in Cey¬
lon obtained better scores than Ame¬
ricans on verbal tests, but were mark¬
edly inferior on non-verbal or perfor¬
mance tests. He suggests that their
culture "has the effect of defining a
set of role behaviours that on the one
hand tends to deprecate manual and
technical ability, and on the other tends
to emphasize and reward the verbal
type of scholarly excellence".
A number of other investigators
have been concerned with qualitative
differences in test scores obtained by
various ethnic groups. Vernon (1969),
found an entirely different pattern of
abilities in the case of Jamaican and
Eskimo boys, respectively; the former
were better in Arithmetic and Word-
learning, the latter in tests dependent
on Induction and on Drawing.
Lesser et al (1965) also found qua¬
litative (as well as quantitative) dif¬
ferences in the abilities of young Chi¬
nese, Jewish, Negro and Puerto Rican
children in the United States; Iscoe
and Pierce Jones (1964) showed that
although Negro children were inferior
to whites in general test scores, they
were superior in measures of what the
authors call "divergent thinking", bas¬
ed on the ability to suggest a number n
of different uses for familiar objects. M
Clearly differences in the measured
capacity of ethnic groups may be a
function of the particular test applied.

WHAT
PRICE
I. Q. TESTS?
Drawing on the results of psycho¬
logical tests given to children of varied
origins, certain psychologists, even
recently, have argued in favour of
the notion of a genetic or inborn
racial hierarchy. Many other experi¬
ments, however, have shown over¬
whelmingly that the theory has no
scientific validity. Groups of dist¬
inguished scientists convened by
Unesco have issued a series of
statements on race. The most recent
of these affirmed, in 1967, that
"Racism falsely claims that there is
a scientific basis for arranging groups
hierarchically in terms of psychologi¬
cal and cultural characteristics that
are immutable and innate". As instru¬
ments for measuring and comparing
innate differences in ability among
different ethnic groups, intelligence
tests are far from perfect. Previous
experience and education, living
conditions, background and emotional
factors can influence the results.
Thus, faced with one test or another
designed to measure the Intelligence
Quotient (above, a test in which
various shaped blocks are used to
form a specific design in a given
time) the reaction of this woman from
northeastern Siberia (left) or that of
the Brazilian Indian, who seems to
be playing at "cat's cradle" (top right)
may differ completely from those of
a European or an African. Research
shows that as environmental opportu¬
nities of different groups become
more alike, as in the case of the
black and white children in the class¬
room, right, differences in test results
also tend to disappear.

RACE AND I.Q. (Continued from page 9)
Objections to Jensen continued
12
If every test is "culture-bound" that
is to say, affected by the whole com¬
plex of previous education, training
and experience, can the use of tests
give us any information at all about
racial differences, or similarities, in
intelligence? If we cannot disentangle
hereditary from environmental influen¬
ces in the results, has the testing me¬
thod any relevance at all to our
problem?
We can of course legitimately say
that racial differences in intelligence
cannot be demonstrated by means of
the tests, for the reasons given; we
can at least say: "Not proven!" Is
that all we can say? Or is there some
more positive manner in which the
tests may be used to answer the ques¬
tions we are raising?
us look at the problem
a little differently. It is true that the
test scores obtained by two different
groups are due to the interaction of
hereditary and environmental factors
which cannot be disentangled. The
inferiority of one of these groups to
the other may then be due to an
inferior heredity, or to a poorer
environment, or both.
Suppose now we make the two en-
. vironments more similar; equalize them
as far as possible. If as the environ¬
ments become more alike, the differ¬
ence in test scores tends to disap¬
pear; if when the environments are to
all practical purposes equalized, the
difference in test scores disappears
completely; we then have a strong arg¬
ument in favour of the environmental
rather than the hereditary explana¬
tion of the observed differences. What
do the results show?
If a test which has been found to be
useful in establishing differences
among children in Paris or New York
is administered to children in Mozam¬
bique or New Guinea, we could hardly
expect the latter groups to do as well
as the former. That should be obvious,
though unfortunately it has not always
been recognized.
There are, however, a number of
countries in which groups of different
ethnic or racial origin live side by side,
and it would seem a simple matter to
use such groups as a basis for com¬
parison.
If in the United States, for example,
we find Americans of Scandinavian,
Italian, Chinese, Negro and American
Indian origin, all living in an "Ameri¬
can" environment, can we not assume
that they all have the same cultural
background, the same educational and
economic opportunities so that any
differences in test results could with
scientific safety be attributed to differ¬
ences in hereditary capacity?
Unfortunately, this is not so. The
American Indian, for example, usually
lives on reservations separate from the
surrounding community; he usually
goes to different schools; he lives a
different life; he speaks English, but
frequently not too well; his economic
status is on the average inferior.
The Negro, although his position in
American life has improved markedly
in recent years, is still in most cases
subject to very definite handicaps; his
economic status is also on the average
very much below that óf the whites;
the schools which he attends have
certainly been inferior in the past, and
to a certain extent are still inferior
to-day; he finds it more difficult to
obtain certain types of employment,
or to participate fully in American life.
Once that is understood, it should
not be surprising to find that American
Indians and Negroes, adults as well as
children, do on the average obtain test
scores inferior to those of whites. But,
it must be noted, this is a difference on
the average. There are many indivi¬
dual Negroes who obtain scores high¬
er than those of a great many indi¬
vidual whites. What is more impor¬
tant, there are sometimes whole groups
of Negroes who do better on the tests
than groups of whites with whom they
have been compared.
This important fact first aroused
widespread interest during the First
World War, when over a million re¬
cruits in the American Army, including
many Negroes, were given psycho¬
logical tests. The results showed that
Negroes from the south (where educa¬
tional and economic handicaps were
greater) obtained scores which on the
average were definitely inferior to
those of Negroes from the north
(where such handicaps, though they
existed, were much less severe).
Even more strikingly, the Negroes
from some of the northern states turn¬
ed out to be superior to the whites
from some of the southern states. This
was true in the case of both types of
intelligence tests used, one depend¬
ing on language, the other a perfor¬
mance or non-language test.
It began to appear, at least to some
psychologists, as if the colour of the
skin were less important in determining
success with the tests, than the oppor¬
tunities given to the individual to ac¬
quire the needed abilities.
As an indication of the wide differ¬
ences in test scores, within the same
racial group, which accompany diffe¬
rences in the environment, one finds
at one extreme, a group of Negro chil¬
dren in rural Tennessee obtaining an
average Intelligence Quotient of 58,
and at the other extreme, Negro chil¬
dren in Los Angeles, California, with
an average Intelligence Quotient of
105.
For the white population as a whole,
an I.Q. of 100 is to be expected; that
is by definition the standard or norm
with which these results are to be
compared. In the inferior environment
of rural Tennessee, the Negro score
goes far below this standard; in the
more favourable environment of a big
city like Los Angeles, the Negro score
reaches and even exceeds by a small
amount the "normal" Intelligence Quo¬
tient. This is an important result and
its implications for so-called racial dif¬
ferences in innate capacity appear to
be obvious.
Another ethnic group which has
been studied in considerable detail,
and with a large variety of tests, is the
American Indian. In general, their test
scores are the lowest of all groups
examined in the United States; their
average Intelligence Quotient is in the
neighbourhood of 81, instead of the
"normal" 100. This result is not at
all surprising, in the light of the "cultu¬
ral" factors discussed above.
The late Professor T. R. Garth of the
University of Denver, Colorado, tried
to discover what would happen if
American Indian children were given the
opportunity to live in a social environ¬
ment similar to that of other American
children. He made a study of Indian
children who had been placed in white
foster homes, cared for by white fos¬
ter parents. These Indian foster child¬
ren obtained an average Intelligence
Quotient of 102.
	1 ORE recently evidence has
accumulated to indicate that training
may markedly raise the level of perfor¬
mance. McFie (1961) was able to
produce a substantial improvement in
the test scores of his African subjects
as a result of education which placed
emphasis on drawing and construction;
there was a significant increase in
both speed and accuracy of per¬
formance.
Lloyd and Pidgeon (1961) also report
that in testing school children in Natal,
they were able to produce a marked
rise in the test scores of African
children after two short sessions of
coaching. The authors warn against
any assumptions about the innate
abilities of children from different
cultures on the basis of these tests.
A significant review by Hunt (1971)
of a number of educational pro¬
grammes, directed not only to the
children of the poor but also to the
mothers of such children, has shown
how much can be done to improve
performance. He writes: "These
findings of substantial gains in the
I.Q.s. of children of mothers so
taught . . . provides a substantial hope
of developing a method of preventing
the development of incompetence in
children of poverty..." Hunt adds that
]]>

this perspective is applicable to both
the black and the white poor.
With these findings in mind, it is
difficult to understand why Jensen
answers his own question, "How much
can we boost I.Q. and scholastic
achievement?", with the conclusion
that the gains are small. Many of his
critics have pointed out that gains have
indeed been obtained, and that they
would be much more substantial if the
relevant programmes were maintained
over a sufficiently long period, and
affected a wider range of the child's
experience.
A statement by the Council of the
Society for the Psychological Study of
Social Issues, a division of the
American Psychological Association,
includes these words:
"One of our most serious
objections to Jensen's article is
to his vigorous assertion that
compensatory education has appa¬
rently failed. The major failure in
so-called compensatory education
has been in the planning, size, and
* scope of the programme. We
maintain that a variety of pro¬
grammes planned to teach specific
skills have been effective and that
a few well-designed programmes
which teach problem-solving and
thinking have also been success¬
ful. The results from these pro¬
grammes strongly suggest that
continuous and carefully planned
intervention procedures can have
a substantially positive influence
on the performance of dis¬
advantaged children."
Jensen has been severely criticized
on a number of counts, including the
neglect of many of the research
findings that throw doubt on his thesis,
and the fact that a good deal of his
argument is really irrelevant to the
subject of race differences. He makes
a strong case, for example, in favour
of the role of genetics in determining
variations among individuals and
families; most psychologists would
agree that heredity does play an
important part in connexion with such
individual variations, without, however,
accepting his inference that this
implies ethnic differences as well.
On this latter point the conclusion is
still "Not proven". It should also be
emphasized that Jensen is not nearly
so dogmatic in his assertions as some
newspapers reported. His actual
words are that it is a "reasonable
hypothesis" that genetic factors"may
play a part" in intelligence differences
between black and white children.-
The many factors that enter into
test performance, and that have been
reviewed above, indicate, however,
that even this relatively temperate
position rests on no solid evidence,
and that his hypothesis is far from
"reasonable" in the light of the various
considerations.
One further important environmental
factor emerges from the report prepar¬
ed by J. S. Coleman and his colleagues

NEW ZEALAND
OUTLAWS RACIAL DISCRIMINATION
New Zealand, a country which has always prided itself on its race relations,
today seeks to maintain this situation through a law that will make racial
discrimination illegal from January 1, 1972. With the country's growing
Maori population moving increasingly to the cities and an influx of Polyne¬
sians from the South Pacific islands, the government sees the need for
safeguards against the possibility of racial tensions. New Zealanders have
also become aware of changes in world opinion regarding racialism, and this
has influenced the government to clarify the country's position concerning
racial equality. In recent years a greater awareness of the minority Maori
group has developed in New Zealand. Intermarriage has contributed to
the change, but so has an upsurge in interest in Maori arts and crafts
and in the Maori language. Here, a young Maori woman a former
"Miss New Zealand" greets a former president of the New Zealand
Travel and Holidays Association with a "hongi" traditional Maori
greeting in which noses are touched together during the handshake.

Inequality
in S. Africa
Photo Hugues Vassal i Gamma. Paris
SEGREGATION IN SPORT is strictly enforced under South
Africa's apartheid laws. White and non-white persons may not
compete against each other in sports nor even attend the same
sporting event as spectators. Exceptionally, as in this photo
taken recently near Johannesburg, non-whites are allowed to
attend major events provided that separate entrances, seating
and toilet facilities are made available.
Like other modern States, the
Republic of South Africa is a
country governed by laws. And
the laws by which a country
chooses to live are normally
matters with which the United
Nations not only does not concern
itself, but which, in fact, it is
expressly forbidden from inter¬
fering with by its own Charter.
However, a feature that gives to
the laws of South Africa the
character and dimension which
have caused concern throughout
the world and which have made
them the subject of formal denun¬
ciation by the United Nations
can be simply stated : while these
laws apply to all the people of
South Africa white and non-
white alike they are laws of
the white man alone, enacted by
the white man alone, for the
benefit of the white man alone.
Neither in the formulation nor
in the execution of these "laws"
do the Africans, who form 70
per cent of the population, nor
the Asians and the Coloured,
have any voice or influence.
It is this character which makes
many of the "laws" of South
Africa, in effect and in reality,
instruments of iniquity and
oppression.
The folio wing examples are drawn
from a study prepared by Pro¬
fessor Leslie Rubin of Howard
University, Washington, D.C., a
former Senator in South Africa,
representing Africans, for the
United Nations Secretariat 's Unit
on Apartheid, showing how legis¬
lation described by the South
African Government as being
designed to promote "separate
development", amounts to a
legalized contempt for all human
beings of the non-white races.

RACE AND COLOUR
A person who is "obviously in appearance white"
and is "generally accepted as a white person" may not be
classified as a white person if one of his natural parents
has been classified as a coloured person.
AN African is "a person who in fact is or is
generally accepted as a member of any aboriginal race or
tribe of Africa".
A coloured person is

A person who is not in fact an African, but "in
appearance obviously is an African" will be classified as
such in the population register, unless he discharges the
onus of proving that he is not in fact and is not generally
accepted as African.
A man who "in appearance obviously is a white
person" must be classified as a coloured person, if one of
his natural parents has been classified as a white person
and the other as a coloured person.
IN deciding whether or not a person is "in
appearance obviously a white person" the official concerned
must take into account such person's "habits, education,
speech, deportment and demeanour in general".
IF a person "in appearance obviously not a
white person" is "generally accepted as a white person"
in the area where he is employed, but is not so accepted
in the area where he lives, he may not be classified as
a white person.
EVEN twenty-five years after a person has
been classified in the population register as a white person
and issued with the corresponding identity card, the Secre¬
tary of the Interior has the right to seek such person's
reclassification.
MOVEMENT
A proclamation in the Government Gazette
may, at any time, prohibit any African from being in any
town during such hours of the night as are specified,
unless he is in possession of a written permit signed by
his employer or by an authorized official.
EVERY African who has attained the age of six¬
teen years must be in possession of a Reference Book.
Any policeman may call at any time on any African to
produce his Reference Book. An African unable to do so
because he has left it at home is guilty of a criminal offence.
HOME, FAMILY AND RESIDENCE
AN African who was born in a town and lived
there continously for fifty years, but then left to reside
elsewhere for any period, even two weeks, is not entitled
as of right to return to the town where he was born and to
remain there for more than seventy-two hours, unless
he has obtained a permit.
AN African who has, since birth, resided conti¬
nuously in a town is not entitled as of right to have living
with him in that town for more than seventy-two hours a
married daughter, a son who has reached the age of eigh¬
teen, a niece, a nephew or a grandchild.
I F an African woman, having contracted a
marriage, takes up permanent residence with her husband
in accommodation provided by his employer in a town where
her husband has lived and worked continuously for
25 years, she is guilty of a criminal offence.
A policeman is entitled to enter and search pre¬
mises on which he has reason to suspect that any Afri¬
can youth (eighteen years of age) is committing the crimi¬
nal offence of residing with his father without having been
issued with the necessary permit to do so.
AN African boy, aged sixteen, who has left
school and lives at home with his parents (who maintain
him) but does not work may, at any time, be arrested with¬
out warrant by a policeman who "has reason to believe
that he is an idle person".
AN African who was born in a town and has
worked and lived there for five years may be required
at any time to leave that town and take up residence in
a Bantu area where he has never lived and has no relatives
or friends. If he remains in the town more than three days
after he has received written notice to leave, he is guilty
of a criminal offence.
THE law of South Africa provides for the divi¬
sion of all towns into separate "group areas" in which only
members of the white and the coloured "groups", may
own land or premises.
NO "obviously white" person who is married to
or cohabits with an African or a coloured person may be
included in the white group.
THE State President may, "whenever it is deem¬
ed expedient", by proclamation in the "Government
Gazette", declare that a defined area which has been occu¬
pied by coloured persons who own land there (no matter
how long such occupation and ownership have continued)
shall be a white group area as from a specified date.
When such white group area has been declared, a coloured
person living in the area (even though he has lived there
continuously for fifty years in a house which he owns) may
not remain there longer than such period of grace, of not
less than twelve months, as the Minister of the Interior, in
his discretion, decides to grant.
IMO white person living in a town may (unless he
has received a licence from the city council) accommodate
on the premises which he owns the son of his African ser¬
vant who lives there, if such son has reached the age of
ten years.
A labour officer may, at any time, cancel the em¬
ployment of an African who works in a town, no matter
how long he has been employed, even though his employer
opposes the cancellation. An African whose employment
has been cancelled, may be removed from the town where
he worked and prohibited from returning to that town for
such period as the labour officer specifies.
A white person living in a town who employs
an African to do any carpentry, bricklaying, electrical fitting
or other skilled work without special exemption granted
by the Minister of Labour commits a criminal offence. A
white person living in a town commits a criminal offence
if he employs an African as a waiter at a party in his
home, unless such African has been granted the necessary
permit by a labour bureau officer.
IT is unlawful for an African worker to take
part in a strike for any reason whatsoever. If he does, he
is guilty of a criminal offence punishable by a fine not
exceeding $1,400 or imprisonment for not longer than
three years, or both such fine and imprisonment.

IF a white person addresses a gathering most of
the members of which are coloured, and calls on his
audience to support any political party, he is guilty of a
criminal offence.
TAXATION
EVERY African, male and female, who has
reached the age of eighteen years is liable to pay an
annual tax (known as the general tax) of a least $4.90, in
addition to the ordinary income tax payable by all South
Africans, unless he satisfies the authorized official that he
has reached the age of sixty-five years.
EVERY African who is the occupier of a dwel¬
ling in an African township is liable to pay an annual tax
(known as the local tax) of $ 1 .40.
IN certain defined areas, any white policeman
may, at any time, stop an African walking in a city street,
if he believes him to be liable to pay these taxes, and
demand from him the receipt for his general tax or local
tax for inspection.
IF the African fails to comply with such demand,
the policeman may arrest him and have him brought before
a Bantu Affairs Commissioner, who may then order his
detention until arrangements have been made for payment
of such tax as may be due.
against unjust apartheid laws, his premises may be
searched at any time on a warrant issued by a magistrate
for evidence that an offence has been committed.
IF such letter was typed, the typewriter may be
seized and delivered to a magistrate who may order that it
be destroyed.
ANY African born outside South Africa (even
though he has lived in South Africa for 50 years and has
not committed an offence) may be declared to be an unde¬
sirable inhabitant.
AN African who writes "Down with Apartheid"
on the wall of the house of any person, is guilty of a cri¬
minal offence.
IF one issue of a weekly magazine published
in South Africa has been held to be undesirable, and the
Publications Control Board is of the opinion that every
subsequent issue is likely to be undesirable, all future
issues of the magazine may be prohibited as undesirable,
by notice in the Government Gazette.
THE RULE OF LAW
AN African who has been required by an order
of Court to leave a certain area must do so, and no
Court of law may grant an injunction preventing such
removal, nor may appeal or review proceedings stay or
suspend such removal, even when it has been established
beyond all doubt that the order of Court was intended for
some other person and was served upon him in error.
OWNERSHIP OF LAND
NO African is entitled as of right to acquire free¬
hold title to land anywhere in South Africa; nor is it the
intention of the present Government ever to grant such
right to the African, even in his own Bantu areas.
OPINION AND EXPRESSION
THE South African Publications Control Board
consists of nine persons (all of them white) appointed and
paid by the Government. One of the functions of the
Board is to prevent the showing of any film which depicts
white and non-white children sharing the same class¬
room or white and non-white adults dancing with one
another or white and non-white men and women embracing
and kissing one another.
ANOTHER function of the South African Publi¬
cations Control Board is to prevent the showing of any
educational documentary film which expresses approval
of racial integration or disapproval of discrimination based
on race and colour.
IT is a criminal offence for a newspaper to
publish an article which is held by the court to have harmed
relations between whites and Africans because it used
strong language to assert that apartheid is unjust to the
African people.
THE South African Publications Control Board
may, by notice in the Government Gazette prohibit the
importation into South Africa of all books (other than those
for which it chooses to issue a special permit) published
by a specified publisher, if it is of the opinion that such
books are likely to create the impression that apartheid
is unjust to the non-white people of South Africa.
IF an African has received a letter from another
African asking him to join in a peaceful demonstration
ANY person who breaks the window of a
building (including a private residence) in the course of a
demonstration calling for the grant of increased rights to
the African people, is guilty of the offence of sabotage,
unless he proves that his act was not calculated or
intended to encourage feelings of hostility between white
persons and Africans. The offence is punishable by sen¬
tence of death.
ANY person who advocates military intervention
by the United Nations in Namibia (South West Africa) is
guilty of a criminal offence punishable by imprisonment
for not less than 5 years or by death.
No person other than the Minister of Justice or
an official may have access to such detained person, nor
is any person (not even members of his immediate family)
entitled to any information as to what has happened to
him or where he is.
No court of law may order the release of such
detainee or pronounce upon the validity of any action which
has been taken against him.
A N African living in a Bantu area may not,
without special permission to do so, carry a knife whose
blade is more than 3£ inches long, while outside the
allotment on which he resides. If he does he is guilty of
a criminal offence punishable by a fine of not more than
$280 or imprisonment for not longer than 12 months,
or a whipping, or both imprisonment and a whipping.
The case-laws cited derive, for the most part, from the
Bantu (Urban Areas Consolidation) Act No. 25 of 1945 ; the
Bantu (Abolition of Passes and Co-ordination of Documents)
Act No. 67 of 1952; the Bantu Labour (Settlement of
Disputes) Act No. 48 of 1953 ; the Bantu Building Workers
Act. No 27 of 1951 ; the Workmen's Compensation Act No
30 of 1941 ; the Bantu Education Act No. 47 of 1953; the
Extension of University Education Act No. 45 of 1959 and
Proclamation No. 333 of 1 November 1957 issued under the
Group Areas Act No. 77 of 1957.

BALLET OF UMBRELLAS

These photographs were taken by a French school¬
teacher, Marc Paygnard, of Longwy, in Lorraine.
They hang on the walls of his classroom so that the
children of his various classes can see the "ballet of
umbrellas", with its message of racial equality. One
of the leading geneticists of the USSR, Nikolai Dubi¬
nin, recently wrote: "It can be said that today half
of mankind is a product of racial mixture. In a few
centuries whole populations of mixed races have
been born on every continent. Ever since the disco¬
very of the New World by Columbus, a process of
racial mixture has been going on that has been
growing and expanding steadily, with the result that
an amalgamation of races has taken place, tending
to create one single, gigantic population. The rate
of racial mixture of whites and blacks in North Amer¬
ica, for instance, was studied by two American scien¬
tists, B. Glass and C. Li, in 1966. They found that
today, three and a half centuries after the . arrival
of the Negroes in the New World, one third (30 %)
of their genotype is made up of white genes. The
speed with which this process is going on indicates
that, even if we assume that prejudice against inter¬
racial marriages will not have totally disappeared,
whites and blacks will be united as one single popu¬
lation in 75 generations or 2,000 years from today.
That is, complete genetic equilibrium will have been
achieved by then."

THE
OTHER
PERSON'S
SKIN
by Mohamed Awad

20
#% well-known Arab poet,
Mutanabbi by name, was fond of
mixing his poetry with a dash of
philosophy; and in one of his poems,
it occurred to him to touch on the
question of the colour of the skin.
He asks:
How is it that the sun darkens our
[complexion
And yet fails to darken our white
[hair?
Surely the two cases are one and
[the same,
If there is any justice in the worldl
Mutanabbi's subject in this poem is
not the colour of the human skin and
the factors that influence it. He is
MOHAMED AWAD, of the Arab Republic of
Egypt, is a distinguished educator, authority
on social questions, geographer, poet and
translator of literature. He was a member of
the U.N. Sub-Commission on the Prevention
of Discrimination and Protection of Minori¬
ties (chairman in 1957 and 1958) and as
Special Rapporteur, prepared the U.N. Report
on Slavery published in 1966. Dr. Awad was
Egypt's Minister of National Education in 1955
and President of Alexandria University. In
1960-62, he was president of the Unesco
Executive Board and in 1964 Vice-chairman
of the Unesco General Conference.
merely telling us about his flight from
Egypt to Iraq, across the wilderness
of Sinai and the deserts of northern
Arabia. It was by no means a
comfortable trip, for the rays of the
sun are extremely strong at all times
of the year.
Mutanabbi employed good camels,
brought specially from the land of the
Beja in the Sudan. He travelled fast,
because he wanted to reach Baghdad
as soon as possible, and this obliged
him to travel both by night and by day,
exposing his skin to the scorching and
merciless rays of the sun.
Once settled in Baghdad he could
see that his skin was considerably
darker, while the hair of his head and
beard had become whiter. We should
note that white hair was a favourite
theme in Arabic poetry, so it would
be perfectly natural for Mutanabbi to
refer in his poem to the contrast bet¬
ween the two phenomena: the skin
that darkens and the white hair that
fails to get dark.
Mutanabbi lived over a thousand
years ago. Had he been living these
days, his philosophy touching the
human skin would have been of
a different kind. He would have
wondered how it came about that fair
complexions should now, at great pain
and expense, be exposed quite un¬
necessarily to the rays of the sun, in
order that they might acquire the
darkest possible shade.
And not only do those fair com¬
plexions migrate to the sea-shore, to
the high mountains, to the desert
retreats of Arizona and Mexico, in
search of the dark tinge; in addition,
great factories are built for the pro¬
duction of liquids and oils and creams,
which can be bought from chemists
and drugstores all over the world,
to help promote the process of
soothing and darkening and browning
the fair skin. It should then be a
source of happiness to admire a
beautiful dark-complexion, especially
in these days when fashion dictates
that considerable anatomy must be
publicly displayed.
Mutanabbi would surely have ex¬
pressed himself in a rather different
philosophical vein regarding dark skin
nowadays, when both Physics and
Chemistry have combined to produce
dark-brown shades, against which
nobody has any colour prejudice.

I
that the present writer faced the ques¬
tion of skin-colour, when, in April,
1945, he came to the United States
of America with the Egyptian Delega¬
tion, on its way to the San Francisco
Conference. This was the famous
conference which was to draw up the
Charter of the United Nations, the
charter that was to declare in its
opening articles that there should be
no differentiation of treatment, based
on language, race, colour, religion, etc.
While we were still in our plane,
approaching the United States, we
were each handed by the US Immigra¬
tion Administration a large sheet of
paper, which carried a number of
questions which we were required to
answer faithfully and truthfully. While
most of the questions were easily dis¬
posed of, there was one that really
stumped me: it asked what was one's
race.
Although I was once told that in the
U.S.A. I should be asked about my
race, I did not take the remark seri¬
ously. Now on entering the States I
realized that this was no joke; and I
had to give an honest answer to an
official question.
It must be admitted that in spite my
geographical studies, which included
a lot of anthropology, it was by no
means easy for me to say to what race
I belonged. The human species to
which I presumably belong, was evol¬
ved on the face of this planet, probably
somewhere in the south west of Asia.
There, according to the most accepted
theory, Adam and Eve got married,
and began to produce an enormous lot
of offspring.
These offspring did not remain in
their original home, but kept on wan¬
dering and multiplying and migrating
from place to place. The wanderings
must have lasted approximately a
million years, in the course of which
the human species was busy making
new races, either by intermarriage or
by other means.
The number of these races must be
very large. The U.S. Immigration Office
wanted to know to which of them I
belonged; or else, presumably, I would
be refused participation in writing
the Charter of the United Nations.
Obviously I was in a predicament from
which I must try to extricate myself.
The U.S. Immigration Office prob¬
ably knew that I should not find the
question an easy one to answer. So
they tried to help the candidate to
supply the required information, by
suggesting that one should write that
one's race was either white or col¬
oured. But this did not make the
question any easier. I did not know
how coloured I was. In the end I
decided to try to be scientific and I
wrote against race: "Mediterranean",
and handed the form to the represen¬
tative of the U.S. Immigration Office.
He did not even look at it.
I must inform the prospective visitor
to the U.S.A. that this difficulty no
longer exists, and one is not now
asked that difficult question.
The reason why I relate my early
experience at some length is that
it included a profound error, in stipu¬
lating that one's race can be only
described as either white or coloured.
Scientifically speaking there is no
human being who is not coloured to
some extent. Even the fairest skin in
the northern latitudes cannot be
described as without colour.
Skin colour differs in quantity but
not in quality. It is the result of the
presence of a huge number of micro¬
scopic glands under the skin, which
produce a pigment, that protects the

THE OTHER PERSON'S SKIN (Continued)
The right to be different

sensitive parts under the skin from
injurious rays. In countries where the
sun shines with great vigour, those
glands become more active; the pig¬
ment produced is more substantial
and the colour of the skin appears
much darker. The environment is thus
the decisive factor in giving the skin
the colour it needs.
In the northern climates, in the
lands surrounding the Baltic and the
North Sea, the rays of the sun are
seldom strong, and the production of
pigment is minimal. Here is the home
of the Nordic Race, with its clear skin,
blue eyes, and fair hair. Their glands
produce all the pigment that is neces¬
sary for the climate; and should they
emigrate to a much more sunny and
warm climate, their skin hurts, and they
have to apply more creams and oint¬
ments and wear dark glasses for addi¬
tional protection. As we move from
the northern latitudes towards the
Equator we begin to encounter darker
skin and eyes and hair.
It may be asked what happens to
the person who cannot produce any
protective pigment. This does occur
in some persons whose glands do
not function. Their skin has usually
a sickly white appearence. They are
known as Albinos; and their condition
is lamentable. Albinism is the name
of their disease and it may occur
among animals as well as among
humans. Fortunately, it is not very
common.
To distinguish people according to
their colour is an old custom. One
of the painted pictures left by the
Ancient Egyptians denotes the kind of
people known to them about three
or four thousand years ago, and
shows four different faces. One
depicts an Egyptian, whose colour
is reddish; another has a rather
dark skin-colour and is meant to be a
Nubian; a third has yellowish skin to
denote a Syrian, and the fourth, repre¬
senting a Libyan, has a fair skin and
blue eyes. There is no indication that
one colour is superior to another. The
picture simply represented the peoples
with whom the Egyptians were most
familiar. In other words, there was
no idea of what we now call colour
prejudice.
Similar pictures of classical times
represent the captured slaves from the
Northern plains; their colour was much
fairer than that of their Roman masters.
When we come to modern times
we witness examples of what must
be considered colour prejudice. It is
not necessary to trace the history of
the phenomenon. The essential thing
to note is that it exists in several
parts of the- world, assumes different
forms, and has produced different
results.
Colour prejudice consists essentially
of a feeling that individuals with a
certain skin colour are inferior. Usu¬
ally the persons considered inferior
are those with a dark or deep brown
skin, and they are considered inferior
by individuals whose skin is fair. In
other words persons with little skin
pigment consider themselves superior
to those whose skin carries a lot of
pigment. For the sake of easy expres¬
sion, we mostly call the former
"white" and the latter "black".
The blacks living in a certain neigh¬
bourhood would not quit their homes if
a white family came to settle there, nor
would they leave a hotel, if a white man
came to stay there for a night or two.
Both cases are fairly common where
the newcomer is black.
Many urban districts have been
abandoned by their white occupants as
soon as a few black families came to
live there. These black families may be
culturally or materially well off; but
this will not affect the result. The
neighbourhood soon becomes a black
man's environment.
^9 OME countries have at¬
tempted, with a certain measure of
success, to combat this segregation,
particularly in the schools maintained
by the State, and even in some insti¬
tutes of higher learning. In social
circumstances, however, little progress
has been achieved. People will still
live in districts whose inhabitants carry
the same amount of pigment, and
intermarriage is usually frowned upon.
One may be permitted to say, in
passing, that the policy of desegrega¬
tion deliberately followed by the U.S.
Government is still in its early stages,
and is bound to achieve greater results
in course of time. Already the U.S. has
Negro millionaires, and there are a
particularly large number of sports
champions and Negro artists who are
held in the greatest esteem at home
and abroad, irrespective of the amount
of pigment in their skin.
There are, unfortunately, communi¬
ties which have carried colour pre¬
judice to the extreme limit. No account
of racial prejudice is complete without
reference to the miserable conditions
which obtain in the Republic of South
Africa, where colour prejudice has
been responsible for the misery of
about fifteen million people, and where
it has been designated by a special
name: Apartheid.
South Africa is the only country in
the world that proclaims the inequality
of its citizens in its laws. The South
Africa Act, 1961, declares that only
white persons may become members
of the all-powerful parliament. Though
an Afrikaans word, meaning separa-
teness, apartheid has come to mean
a policy of the State, based on racial
segregation and racial discrimination
and pursued in a most rigorous and
brutal manner by a minority of whites
against the large majority of Africans,
coloureds and Asians. In order to
pursue such a policy, a cruel regime
has been established, supported by a
police state and the most cruel "legal"
machinery imaginable.
For the public, the literature is fairly
simple: Signs reading "Whites only"
"Non-whites only." These signs are
on poles standing in playgrounds,
parks and beaches; they are painted
on benches, stencilled on telephone
boxes and nailed over sports fields,
concert halls, post offices and rail¬
way stations.
No place is too lowly for them
the urinals are strictly segregated
and no complication is too great: at
new stations separate counters are
provided for white luggage, for non-
white luggage, and for white luggage
to be fetched by non-white persons.
The colour bar applies to sex, with
policemen shining their torches
through windows to catch white and
black in forbidden embraces (Immora¬
lity Act). It applies to disaster, with
white ambulances being prevented
from carrying non-white casualties
(Hospital Board Regulations); and it
applies to death, with burial grounds
racially zoned to ensure that the
bodies remain as divided in death as
they were in life (Group Areas Act).
Such are the conditions in the
Republic of South Africa, where colour
prejudice exists at its worst. Little
wonder that the regime in South Africa
is only recognized- by some twenty
countries, and it is difficult to imagine
that such a regime can survive for
very long.
In conclusion, I would hope that the
different examples of the problem of
skin colour have helped to show that
while the properties of colour are
mostly the result^pf natural factors,
colour prejudice is definitely not
natural.

A 1 9th CENTURY
CHAMPION
OF ANTI-RACISM
IN NEW GUINEA
by Nikolai A. Butinov
of the N.N. Miklukho-Maklai
Ethnographic Institute
U.S.S.R. Academy of Sciences
Exactly 100 years ago, a young Russian scientist, Nikolai Miklukho-
Maklai (above), landed on the coast of north-eastern New Guinea, the
world's second largest is/and. He was to make five expeditions in all
to this "terra incognita", where he pioneered anthropological studies
and became an active defender of the Papuans and their independence
(see article opposite). In his thinking on racial questions, particu¬
larly his rejection of the myth of racial superiority, he was ahead of
his times. Below and on the following pages we publish passages from
his diaries, correspondence and other papers.

IIn September 1871, the
Russian corvette "Vityaz" dropped
anchor in Astrolabe Bay in New Gui¬
nea, and a young Russian natural
scientist by the name of Nikolai N.
Miklukho-Maklai went ashore. To this
day, the place carries the name Maklai
Shore.
I ask the reader to take himself
back 100 years, when many scientists
were devoting their efforts to finding
evidence to substantiate Darwin's
theory of the evolution of man from
the ape-like predecessors. Scientists
travelled to the deepest, darkest
corners of the earth in an attempt to
find a living, rather than fossilized,
specimen intermediate between man
and his predecessors.
The "Jena heretic", Ernst Haeckel,
one of Darwin's most ardent followers,
felt the Papuans of New Guinea
represented this missing link. Guided
by superficial observations made by
navigators from aboard ship that the
body hair of the Papuans grew in
tufts, he categorized them as a "tuft-
haired* race.
After attending his lectures at Jena
University, Nikolai Miklukho-Maklai
found himself in disagreement with
Haeckel on this question. He saw the
danger of the possible racialist
conclusions that could be drawn from
the allegations about a "tuft-haired"
race. This played no small role in his
deciding to devote several years to
studying the life of primitive peoples.
Convinced that an adequate study of
the Papuans could be made only at
first hand, Miklukho-Maklai set sail for
New Guinea. He settled among
the "tuft-haired" people and began
conducting anthropological research.
This is all now part of history, but
100 years ago it was a major achieve¬
ment. Every day among the Papuans
brought new discoveries, but many
were the days when his life hung upon
a thread.
To avoid the loss of the results of
his research he showed the Russian
officers who escorted him to the
island, where he would bury his notes
"so that if I should not survive, my
manuscripts, in cylinders, would be
unearthed and sent to the Russian
Geographical Society."
Fortunately, Miklukho-Maklai did
survive, although his health was
seriously impaired because of the
climatic conditions, so difficult for him,
a European, to adjust to. He was able
to win the confidence of the Papuans,
learn the Bongu language, collect
unique ethnographic and anthropolo¬
gical specimens, and make important
advances in scientific research.
Miklukho-Maklai made five separate
voyages to New Guinea: three to
Maklai Shore, where he lived a total
of two years and eight months, one
to the northwest shore and one to the
southeast shore of the peninsula. He
travelled twice to the islands of
Melanesia and Micronesia, visited
some Polynesian islands, made two
difficult and dangerous expeditions
into the depths of the Malacca penin¬
sula, visited the Philippine islands, and
lived a long while in Australia.
The Russian scientist's articles,
diaries, sketches and collections,
especially those connected with his
stay on Maklai Shore, constitute a
golden treasure of world ethnographic
science. Modern researchers studying
the culture and life of the Papuans of
New Guinea still refer to the works
of Miklukho-Maklai. "How rich the
culture of the tribes of Tangu may
have been can be imagined from the
drawings and sketches of Miklukho-
Maklai," wrote, for instance, the well-
known English scholar, K.O.L Burridge.
Miklukho-Maklai pioneered the
ethnographic and anthropological study
of New Guinea. He staunchly de¬
fended the concept of mankind as a
single species: the Oceanians were
retarded in their cultural development
by virtue of a number of historical
causes, but in their intellectual and
moral qualities they were not at all
inferior to Europeans. Miklukho-
Maklai not only subjected racialism to
scientifically valid criticism, but became
an active fighter for the freedom and
independence of those peoples.
His feat ¡s a brilliant example of
selfless service to science. But
besides the purely scientific side of
Miklukho-Maklai's feat, there is yet
another the humanitarian side which
the great Russian novelist Leo Tolstoy
noted and considered of primary
importance.
He wrote to Miklukho-Maklai "As
far as I know, you are the first to
prove indubitably by experience that
man is the same everywhere, that is,
a decent, social being, with whom
intercourse should be entered into
with kindness and truth, and not with
cannons and vodka..."
From a report of his travels
to the Russian Geographical Society
St. Petersburg, 1882
WHEN, in November 1877, I finally decided to return to Singapore on an
English schooner that chanced to pass by, I sent a message to all villages that
two people from each should appear before me the oldest and the youngest.
However, more than two persons from each village came to me, so it was a large
crowd that gathered near my hut. I told them that I was leaving them, probably
for a long time. They very much regretted my departing.
I then explained to them that there would probably be other people, also white
like myself, with the same kind of hair and in the same kind of clothing, coming
to them on the same kind of ships as I arrived on, but that it was most likely that
they would be people completely different from Maklai. I considered it my duty
to warn the natives about that class of traders who to this day make the islands
of the Pacific Ocean a place of very sad events.
To this day, you meet with so-called "kidnappings", that is, the abduction of
people into slavery by various means... I anticipated that the same thing could
happen on New Guinea that happened on the Melanesian Islands (the Solomons,
New Hebrides, etc.), where the populations decreased markedly due to slavery.
Therefore, feeling that Maklai Shore would also in time be visited by the slave
traders, I considered it my duty to warn the Papuans and explain to them that
although they might see the same kind of ships and the same kind of people as
Maklai, these people could carry them away into bondage. This warning filled
them with consternation, and they tried to persuade me to stay.

The 'tuft-hair' of the Papuans
From his diary (January 3, 1872)
Maklai Shore, New Guinae
FOR a long time now, it has seemed to me an incorrect pro¬
position that the hair of the Papuans grows in tufts or "bunches".
But the huge "wigs" of my neighbours have not permitted me to
clearly ascertain just how the hair is distributed. In observing the
distribution of hair on the temples, crown and nape of the neck of
adults, I was able to note that there was no special grouping of
the hairs in tufts, but so far I have not had occasion to see a
shortly-cropped head of hair among the natives.
... I soon fell asleep... Through my sleep, I heard voices calling
me and, seeing the callers, I immediately jumped up. It was Kolle
from Bongu with a nine year-old boy who was very closely cropped.
I examined his head with great interest and attention and even made
drawings of what seemed to be the most important. I was convinc¬
ed of the fact that the hair of the Papuans grows not in bunches or
tufts as is written in many anthropological textbooks, but exactly the
same as ours.

Reflections on the fate
of the aborigines
From a letter to his friend A.A. Meschersky
(later Secretary of the
Russian Geographical Society)
Maklai Shore, New Guinea, October-November 1877
26
about the fate of the aborigines to whom I have
become so attached often occurred and always led to the same
question: would I be doing the natives a service if I facilitated access
to their country by Europeans through my knowledge of this country,
its customs and language.
The more I thought about it, the more I was inclined to a negative
answer. Sometimes I put the question the other way: looking at the
incursion of the whites as an unavoidable eventuality, I then asked
myself: whom should I help to whom should I give the advan¬
tage the missionaries or the traders?
The answer was always neither one nor the other, since the
former, unfortunately often and under disguise, actually engage in
the activities of the latter, paving the way for them. I therefore
decided that in no way, either directly or indirectly, will I promote
the establishment of relations between the whites and the Papuans.
Arguments that the dark races, being lower ard weaker, must give
way to the higher and stronger white variety, seem to me to constantly
demand more and more proof. In accepting this proposition and
advocating the destruction of the dark races by arms and disease,
the next logical step is to suggest that those among the whites
who do not fit a given ideal of a member of the chosen white race
should also be picked out and destroyed.
Logically, a further conclusion would be to consider various hospi¬
tals, orphanages and alms-houses to be unnecessary and even
harmful, and to advocate a law that every newborn baby who does
not reach a certain length and weight should be removed, etc.
When, on the other hand, with the aid of impartial observation,
one arrives at the conclusion that the different parts of the earth
with their various conditions of living cannot be populated by a
single group of the species homo with identical organizations, quali¬
ties and abilities, and when one realizes therefore that the existence
of various races is completely consistent with the laws of nature,
one must then recognize that the members of these races are
entitled to universal human rights, and must agree that the des¬
truction of the dark races is nothing other than the use of brute
force, which every honest person should oppose...
'I have decided to
defend their just cause7
From a letter to A.A. Meschersky
The Pacific Ocean (March 17, 1876)
I LEFT New Guinea in December 1872, despite the
persistent appeals of the natives that I remain with them;
but I promised them I would return when I knew that
my coming could be of benefit to them.
Recently, because an incursion of European coloni¬
zation, with all its dangers to the natives, has been
threatening my black friends, I have felt that the time
has come for me to fulfill my promise, which I must
and want to keep, despite the fact that this decision
will tear me away for a time from purely scientific work.
At the present moment I am en route to Maklai Shore,
where I plan to settle with the aim, in accordance with
my promise, of trying as best I can to be of help to
the natives, that is, to do as much as possible to prevent
the collision between European colonization and the black
population from having any disastrous consequences for
the latter (as happened in Tasmania, continues in Austra¬
lia, and will most likely happen on the Fiji Islands).
I hope that the opinion of all honest and fair people
will prove sufficient patronage and protection for my
cause against the illegal claims of governments and
against the unjust and violent deeds of various European
exploiters and those who seek enrichment and personal
profit by any and all possible ways and means.
If, despite all my endeavours, my efforts turn out to
be in vain, then perhaps the scientific research and study
in this already familiar country will compensate for my
sacrifices of time, health and money; if not, the know¬
ledge that I kept my word will be sufficient reward.
I would hope that my friends know me well enough
not to consider my decision to be a frivolous act and
will maintain their former friendship and sympathy for
me, knowing that regardless of anything, I am keeping
my word and returning to New Guinea, not only as a
naturalist, but also as a "protector" of my black friends
of Maklai Shore, and that I have decided to defend as
much as I am able their just cause: their independence
in the event of European incursion (which would have
inevitable fatal consequences for the natives), although
I realize that their cause is a matter of the weak against
the strong!

Might is not right
From a letter to Sir Arthur Hamilton
Governor of Fiji and High Commissioner
of the Western Pacific
Sydney, Australia, (January 23. 1879)
feâS Y the exercise of patience and by dint of fair and very friendly behaviour,
I have finally succeeded in gaining the full confidence of the natives,
who at first, and for several months, were far from friendly.
After learning the Papuan language, I have been able to study their ways
and customs. Having spent nearly three years among these people and having
had the time to assess their character and capabilities, I feel a deep and
disinterested concern for their future, especially since I foresee that an invasion
of New Guinea by white men could easily, indeed almost certainly would
spark off a chain of catastrophic and regrettable events.
However, I am sure that many of these repugnant injustices committed by
the strong upon the weak could be avoided if the governments of the civilized
world, respecting the precepts of justice, would confirm and enforce the elemen¬
tary principles of the law of nations and of international law.

THE NATIVES OF MAKLAI SHORE REJECT GERMAN ANNEXATION
-MAKLAI
Letter from Tolstoy
September 25, 1886
13 EAR Nikolai Nikolayevich, thank
you very much for sending your
brochures. I was very pleased to read
them and found in them much of
interest. What moves me and arouses
my admiration is that, as far as I know,
you are the first to prove indubitably
by experience that man is the same
everywhere, that is, a decent social
being, with whom intercourse should
be entered into with kindness and
truth, and not with cannons and vodka.
And you proved this by a feat Of
genuine courage which is so rarely met
with in our society that the people of
our society do not even understand it.
Your case seems to be as follows:
people have lived for so long under
the deception of violence that both the
oppressors and the oppressed have
come to believe that this abnormal
relationship among peoples, not only
among cannibals and non-Christians,
but even among Christians, is actually
normal.
Then, suddenly, one man, under the
pretext of scientific investigation
(please excuse me for this frank
expression of my belief) goes alone
among the most fearsome savages
with neither gun nor bayonet, but
armed with reason alone, and proves
that all the outrageous violence by
which we live in this world is only old,
outlived humbug, from which people
who wish to live rationally should
have been freed long ago.
This js what is so touching and
admirable to me in your work, and
why I so desire to see you and enter
into communication with you.
Please let me tell you the following:
even if your collections are very
important, more important than any¬
thing that had been thus far collected
from anywhere in the world, then, even
in that case, all of your collections
and all your scientific observations are
as nothing compared with those
observations of human characteristics
which you made while you lived among
the natives, communicated with them,
and influenced them by reason alone.
And, therefore, for the love of all
that is holy, set down in the greatest
detail and with the strict adherence
to truth which is characteristic of you,
all of the person-to-person relation¬
ships you established among those
people.
I do not know what contribution
your collections and discoveries will
make to the branch of science which
you serve, but your experience
among the natives is epoch-making in
the science which I serve, namely the
science of how people should live
with one another. Write that story
and you will perform a great and good
service to all mankind.

Learning
the three T's
in school
28
WONFRONTED with a world
of tense relations between racial and
ethnic groups, what can the school do
to reduce and eliminate such tensions?
How can societies use their educa¬
tional systems to improve the quality
of inter-group relations among the
coming generations?
Inter-group relations vary signifi¬
cantly from one country to another,
and techniques for resolving group
tensions have, to some extent, to be
related to the special features of the
country concerned.
The division which cannot, for the
time being, be escaped is the one
between the white world and the
coloured world, between white children
and coloured children and the parti¬
cular problems which have to be
faced if the quality of their mental
images of each other is to be
improved.
If we were considering education
in an exclusively white country, the
emphasis in educational reform might
have to be towards promoting greater
tolerance of alien cultures and alien
groups. But if we were concerned
with education in an exclusively black
country, we' might have to contend
not with the problem of intolerance,
but with the problem of the depen¬
dency complex.
The educational system in an African
country might need to handle the
crisis of a sense of psychological
inadequacy, sometimes seen in the
indiscriminate imitation of western
culture, and sometimes in aggressive
hostility towards that culture. Both
cultural aggression in the black man
and cultural imitation could be symp¬
toms of an inner dependency complex,
still struggling to find ways of self-
liquidation.
ALI A. MAZRUI, of Uganda, is head of the
Dept. of Political Science and Public Admi¬
nistration at Makerere University, in Kampala.
He is the author of "Violence and Thought:
Essays on Social Tensions in Africa" (Long¬
mans, London) and "Towards a Pax Afri¬
cana" (Weidenfeld, London).
But what about a country which is
racially mixed? There are times when
equal attention might need to be paid
both to promoting greater tolerance
in white children and to overcoming
dependency in coloured children. But
since racially mixed societies are not
all at the same stage of integration,
the relative sizes of the problems
might vary considerably.
As a generalization, we might say
that the central problem in South
Africa for the time being is not so
much black dependence, as white
arrogance. If we were hoping to see
educational reforms in South Africa,
the first emphasis might be towards
transforming the attitudes of the white
children in the direction of greater
tolerance and understanding of groups
other than their own. The problem
of the dependency complex in black
children, though certainly very much
there, is for the time being secondary
in a society whose stratification arises
purely from the racial assertiveness
of the whites.
But a look at American society re¬
veals a different emphasis. There is
indeed still the lingering problem of
white arrogance as an aspect of the
American racial scene. On the black
side there are two problems the
residual dependency problem and the
problem of loss of identity.
The residual dependency problem
may be manifested in "Uncle Toms",
people who are taken or mistaken to
be blind imitators of western or Anglo-
Saxon norms, and who feel uneasy
about being abandoned by the Anglo-
Saxon world. But the dependency
phenomenon in the United States may
take more subtle forms than that of
blatant imitation, it may sometimes
lead to aggressive reaction to what is
taken to be white abandonment of the
black man.
What challenges do these inter-
ethnic and inter-racial problems pose
for educational systems? One point
which needs to be grasped immediately
is that the problem of relations bet
ween races has points in common
with problems of relations between
religious denominations, as in Ireland
or between tribal groups, as in Kenya
and Uganda. The educational impli¬
cations of plural societies may be
strikingly similar, regardless of whe¬
ther the plurality derives from racial,
religious, or ethno-cultural differences
On close examination it may well
turn out that there are at least three
politically significant values which can
be inculcated by the educational
system, regardless of the nature of the
society, and indeed regardless of the
regime in power. We might call these
values "The Three T's of Training in
Nationhood". The T's I have in mind
are first, Tolerance, second, Toil, and
third, Teamwork. They are themselves
to be seen as supplementary perhaps
to the three R's of basic education
Reading, Writing and Arithmetic.
B' Y "Tolerance" I do not
mean the promotion of a sense of
"brotherhood". The idea of human
brotherhood is a religious idea, and
people respond to it more positively
when they are listening to a sermon
in a church than in their day-to-day
lives. It is just not realistic enough
to expect people who are otherwise
rivals and strongly in competition, and
have no connexion of any kind with
each other in blood or cultural affinity,
to regard each other as brothers
nevertheless.
Even the Christian imperative of
"love thy neighbour" is a tall order.
Even a literal neighbour may be quite
demanding if he plays his gramo¬
phone too loud at night, or if his
children are noisy and boisterous.
The critical issue for a society is
not how much brotherhood there is,
but how much tolerance. There is no
special credit in being favourably dis¬
posed towards your own brother. The
real test comes when, in spite of
being unable to regard a stranger as

a young Masai girl prepares a white boy for a "brotherhood" ceremony. She took a liking to him

they learn it as they grow up. And ignorance of other peoples and their cultures creates the false
beliefs and stereotypes from which racial prejudice develops.

LEARNING THE THREE T's (Continued)
Tolerance, toil and teamwork

your brother, you still tolerate his un¬
usual and idiosyncratic ways.
Our societies need, above all, the
capacity to tolerate people of. differ¬
ent cultural backgrounds, or differ¬
ent regions or identities, or different
political views. Our societies need to
be guided not necessarily by the
values of liberalism in their totality,
such as individualism, nor indeed by
the institutions of liberalism, such
as certain types of parliaments and
certain types of multi-party systems.
But our societies do need to be
governed by the liberal rules of the
game the rules which simply say
"Live and let live". The liberal rules
of the game permit competing view¬
points and competing interpretations
of reality to survive together. The
liberal rules of the game prescribe
toleration of differences and of plura¬
lism.
Tolerance is, in fact, the most diffi¬
cult of these three values to inculcate
in children. Children are notoriously
intolerant at times, and can be pain¬
fully and brutally cruel. The question
of what kind of approach should be
adopted to foster and build-up their
capacity to tolerate others is perhaps
one of the most important and yet in¬
tractable problems in the whole field
of child education.
But, at the level of Intellectual toler¬
ance, there is a good deal to be said
for a system of education which puts
a special premium on debating as an
activity. The idea of getting school¬
children to debate amongst themselves
on a variety of fundamental issues
has great potential as a teaching
device to promote tolerance of differ¬
ing viewpoints. The training here
springs from exposure to radically
polarized viewpoints.
The debates should take place
several times a term, instead of once
or twice a year. By all means combine
these debates with the idea of invit¬
ing controversial speakers to address
current affairs societies, and answer
student challenges and expostulations,
but controversial speakers should
supplement confrontations between
students themselves over intellectual
issues.
Debating becomes a useful tech¬
nique in a situation of fluid values,
partly because it helps to sharpen the
faculties of deciding between different
values, and gradually developing a
sophisticated evaluation of different
alternatives. Debating is also a criti¬
cal training in the art of toleration.
The imperative of Toil, like the other
two T's, is subject to cultural varia¬
tions. Attitude to work is conditioned
by those cultural factors. President
Nyerere in Tanzania has claimed that
in traditional Africa everyone was a
worker "a worker" not just as distinct
from "employer" but also as distinct
from "loiterer" or "idler".
Nyerere sees work in traditional
Africa as a factor balancing African
hospitality. The tradition of hospitality
and support for one's kinsmen could
all too easily result in parasitism. The
obligation to work is the safety valve
against excessive hospitality. As
Nyerere put it:
"Those who talk about the African
way of life, and quite rightly take
pride in maintaining a tradition of hos¬
pitality which is so great a part of it,
might do well to remember the Swa¬
hili saying "Mgeni siku mbili; siku ya
tatu mpe jembe" or in English: "Treat
your guest as a guest for two days;
on the third day, give him a hoe."
The incentives to work in traditional
Africa were often in the following
order: first, the need to meet the indi¬
vidual's own basic needs and those
of his immediate family; secondly, the
individual's contribution to the welfare
of neighbours and kinsmen if this is
customarily expected; and only thirdly,
the individual's interest in accumulating
more things for himself and aspiring
to self-improvement as distinct from
self-maintenance.
1 HE ordering of priorities is
quite significant. It is not correct that
the traditional African subordinated his
own basic needs to those of his com¬
munity. His own basic needs came
first, the needs of his community and
kinsmen came second, and the need
for personal improvement came third.
The incentive to hard work varied
accordingly. Working for personal
maintenance made good sense;
working hard to meet one's normal
or customary obligations to one's
kinsmen also made sense; but working
hard for some undefined target of
self-improvement was, in many cases,
less clearly understood.
Perhaps educators could investigate
ways of transmitting the ethic of work
in a manner which attempts to recon¬
cile working for society with working
for one's own improvement. The very
process of acquiring an education
poses the dilemma as between educa¬
tion for effective citizenship as against
education for personal ambition.
What should be remembered is
that the harder it is to acquire an edu¬
cation, the more it will be regarded
as a passport to a future life of
leisure. Many African children walk
long distances every day, and take
heavy part-time work, in an endeavour
to acquire an education. Because they
have acquired their education the hard
way, they tend to feel at the end of it
that they have now "arrived" and
deserve to rest. Thus the educated
become, alas, an élite of leisure.
The third "T" of Training in Nation¬
hood is the imperative of Teamwork.
It is important that, at all levels of
education, there should be opportu¬
nities for teamwork. These should
range from encouragement of basket¬
ball and soccer to encouragement of
student political societies and social
organizations. The aim should be the
promotion of national integration.
Africa is confronted with ethnic
pluralism and cultural diversity. The
interaction between different tribes
could generate considerable stress
and tension. The quest is for a system
which would permit these groups not
only to tolerate each other which
is the first pre-condition but also to
work with each other in pursuit of
shared goals. And even when the
groups are in competition, the com¬
petition itself should be subject to rules
of fair play.
Some school games may be better
suited for training in tolerance and
teamwork than others. If so, which
are which? Educational research could
pay renewed attention to the study
of sports and games, and their com¬
parative efficacy as media of sociali¬
zation and promotion of national
values.
If certain games, as yet untried in
African schools, are better for citi¬
zenship-training than those which are
already popular, there is a compelling
case for experimenting with the new
games. In some situations the gym¬
nasium may be a more effective school
of values than an ideological insti¬
tute can hope to be.
In countries which are both multi¬
ethnic and multi-religious, there should
be a purposeful policy to ensure that
each school not only mixes races and
tribes but also mixes religions. The
theory of cross-cutting loyalties as a
mechanism for integration provides
the basis for this recommendation.
If some black families are Catholic
and some are Protestant, and some
white families are Catholic and some
are Protestant, integration in schools
should not only aim to mix blacks
with whites but also to mix, at the
same time and in the same school,
black Catholics with white Catholics
and black Protestants with white
Protestants.
The fact that these categories in
such a school overlap and cut across
each other would itself reduce the
dangers of a neatly reinforced confron¬
tation. On some issues white would
gang up with white against a black
opposition, but on others white Pro¬
testants would gang up with black
Protestants against Catholic opposi¬
tion. The fluidity of alliances afforded
by criss-crossing pulls of this kind

LEARNING THE THREE T's (Continued from page 30)
would themselves be a step away from
a petrified and rigid ethnic confron¬
tation.
Another pre-condition for the pro¬
motion of inter-ethnic harmony is the
application of the principle of cultural
parity to the curriculum. Where
groups have different cultural back¬
grounds it is imperative that the educ¬
ational system should not betray too
sharp an evaluation in favour of one
cultural heritage as against another.
The eruption of black studies in the
United States is itself one indication
of the quest for cultural parity in the
educational system of that country.
But black studies have to be an
intermediate measure, to restore
balance, rather than a permanent
innovation. After all, there are no
"white studies" as a distinct area of
academic pursuit in the United States.
To single out black studies as a
separate entity itself implies an
absence of cultural parity. Full cul¬
tural parity would only be achieved
when the educational system has
integrated more coherently a respect
for the black heritage fully integrated
into one curriculum, instead of isolated
as a separate esoteric preoccupation.
In Africa, cultural parity also
requires important reforms in curricula
and syllabuses. The inherited assump¬
tion that not enough African history
has been recorded to be usable in
school syllabuses has already been
vigorously challenged. Courses in
African history are provided increas¬
ingly, though the pace of Africanization
of syllabuses has been considerably
slower in former French Africa than in
former British Africa.
The introduction of creative writing
by Africans as part of the courses in
literature is another innovation of the
last few years. Books by African
writers are being introduced with
increasing emphasis in African schools.
Basically, in much of English-speak¬
ing Africa, there is a vigorous pursuit
of cultural parity, though many educ¬
ational reformers among Africans
would argue that not enough has been
achieved. Francophone Africa, in
submissive dependency within the
educational system, continues to be
decisively Franco-centric.
Finally, there is the problem of the
staffing of schools.
A situation where a disproportionate
number of teachers belong to a differ¬
ent community from the students they
teach has potentialities for creating
either submissive dependency or
aggressive dependency. In the United
States, aggressive dependency among
black children in schools has, from all
accounts, been rising. In much of
Africa the massive use of imported
teachers continues to consolidate
more submissive dependency rather
than aggressive.
Two policy recommendations are
particularly urgent. One concerns
the headmaster. As rapidly as poss¬
ible African secondary schools should
have African headmasters. The case
for African headmasters is particularly
strong in those schools which have a
disproportionate number of white
teachers. A black headmaster, clearly
active and in authority, helps to
reduce the dangers of socializing the
children into a persistent dependency
orientation towards the white man.
As regards primary schools, unless
it is desperately necessary, there
should be no white teachers working
in black primary schools.
One reason is that the primary age
is a particularly impressionable stage
in the socialization process. It is
important that at this stage the child
should be spared conditioning influ¬
ences which would adversely affect
his orientation towards the Western
world.
But another reason why it is imper¬
ative for primary schools to have
African teachers concerns the very
structure of primary education. At
the primary level the child normally
has one teacher in any particular year,
or at any rate one main teacher.
There are continuities here with the
role of the parents, emphasized by
the very fact that the teacher remains
the same.
In conditions like those of the United
States a modification of policy is in
order. Black schools should, as far
as possible, aim for mixed staffing,
with a black headmaster, conspicu¬
ously authoritative and active. It
would not do to have a black head¬
master mistaken for just a figurehead,
an Uncle Tom placed there for appear¬
ances. His authority over his staff
should not be too subtle.
White schools should attempt to
have at least one or two black
teachers and, where realistic, a black
headmaster. The images which have
to be transformed in black children
are fundamentally different from those
which need to be transformed in white
children. It therefore makes sense
in white schools to appoint a black
headmaster where one is available
and suitable; but to have a white
headmaster in a black school should,
for the time being, be avoided.
While the introduction of such
educational techniques should be
seriously considered, it ought always
to be remembered that the school is,
in the final analysis, only one agency
of socialization, only one factor in
helping young people to find an
identity. Society as a whole must
engage in similar self-analysis for
reform if the positive effects of a
rational educational system are not to
be neutralised by countervailing
influences from the social world
beyond the classroom.
RACE AND I. Q. (Continued from page 13)
32
for the U.S. Office of Education, and
published under the title Equality of
Educational Opportunity in 1966.
When a pupil from a minority group
living in "a home without much educa¬
tional strength is put with schoolmates
with strong educational backgrounds,
his achievement is likely to increase".
The effect is similar when those with
"strong educational backgrounds" are
black rather than white, but it is not
surprising, in view of the whole history
of the United States, that such favour¬
able home backgrounds are found
more often in the case of white chil¬
dren.
For this reason, one of Coleman's
findings is of great significance,
namely that "the average Negro ele¬
mentary child is in schools where
16 per cent of the students are
whites"; the proportion rises in sec¬
ondary schools, but in 1966, it was
still only 24 per cent.
In this connexion it should be point¬
ed out that the U.S. Government and
the law courts are strongly committed
to reducing this disproportion, and are
insisting on a much more significant
degree of school desegration, but the
actual changes in the schools take
place very slowly.
The net result of all the research
that has been conducted in this field
is to the effect that innate racial
differences in intelligence have not
been demonstrated; that the obtained
differences in test results are best
explained in terms of the social and
educational environment; that as the
environmental opportunities of dif¬
ferent racial or ethnic groups become
more alike, the observed differences
in test results also tend to disappear.
The evidence is overwhelmingly against
the view that race is a factor which
determines level of intelligence.
As formulated in the Unesco
"Statement on Race": "It is now
generally recognized that the intelli¬
gence tests do not in themselves
enable us to differentiate safely
between what is due to innate capacity
and what is the result of environmental
influences, training and education.
Wherever it has been possible to
make allowances for differences in
environmental opportunities, the tests
have shown essential similarity in
mental characteristics among human
groups."

UNICEF
GREETING
CARDS
Great artists from the 11th century to the present day have
combined to make the 1971 series of UNICEF Greeting Cards
one of the most exciting yet produced. Sale of these cards
provides UNICEF with over ten per cent of its total annual
income and each card bought helps to provide food, medical
care, clothing and other necessities for three out of four of the
world's children now malnourished and living in desperately
poor conditions. This year's cards include a series of five
nativity scenes from the rich art treasures of the Vatican
Library by 11th, 14th and 15th century Italian artists, a
design by Gino Severini and others by contemporary artists
from many countries. Also on sale is a UNICEF 1972 en¬
gagement calendar illustrated by the works of 55 artists,
taking as its theme "The Child of Joy". Each illustration is
accompanied by a bilingual literary quotation in a choice of
Ave editions: English/French, English/Spanish, English/Scan¬
dinavian languages, English/Portuguese and Dutch/French.
eft: "Magi Adoration",
illustration from an 11th
century manuscript, and
(above left) "Nativity", a 14th
century painting by
Lorenzo Monaco, both from
the Vatican Library, and reproduced
by courtesy of the Holy See.
Two of a set of five
illustrations available in special
edition or normal format.
Right: "Light in Space"
1912, by Gino Severini,
in the special edition
series of cards.
UNICEF cards and envelopes are sold in boxes of ten (12 in the U.S.A.)
for: $2 (U.S.A.); $1.50 (Canada); 10 F (France); 70 p (U.K.). Special
Edition cards (two each of five reproductions from the Vatican Library or
ten of one design by Gino Severini) cost £.1.50 (U.K.) : $ 2,50 (Canada
and U.S.A.); 15 F (France). For orders write to: UNICEF Greeting Card

Books for the Third World
Suggestions for increasing the flow of
badly needed books to the Third World
were made recently by Unesco's Director-
General, Mr. René Maheu, in a report to
the U.N. Trade and Development Board,
meeting in Geneva. Mr. Maheu asked for
payment facilities to be made available to
enable Third World countries to import
more books and to produce them locally.
Unesco aids 7,000
refugee students
For the third time since 1967, Palestinian
refugee students in the Gaza Strip have
been able to sit for school-leaving examin¬
ations prepared by the Arab Republic of
Egypt thanks to arrangements made by
Unesco with the Israeli and Egyptian
authorities. A courier from Unesco collect¬
ed question papers in Cairo and delivered
them to Gaza. He later returned to Cairo
with nearly three tons of answer papers
from 7,000 students.
DDT threat to ocean life
Nearly a quarter of all DDT manufactur¬
ed in the world so far is now in the
oceans, says a report by the U.S. National
Academy of Sciences. Persistent pesti¬
cides such as DDT, Aldrin, Chlordane,
Dieldrin, etc., eventually end up in the
world's oceans with "demonstrable im¬
pact" on marine life.
sa
University without walls
Unesco has made a grant of $10,000 to
the Union for Experimenting Colleges and
Universities, in the U.S.A. to help it plan
the international development of its Univer¬
sity Without Walls Programme. The pro¬
gramme aims to provide a new kind of
undergraduate education designed to make
college level programmes more flexible and
more easily available to persons aged from
16 to 60 and older. Over 20 countries are
interested in developing their own Univer¬
sity Without Walls programmes.
Flashes...
A new Unesco Centre and Youth Club,
providing a meeting-place for students and
other young people for talks and discus¬
sions on subjects of international interest,
was inaugurated in Florence last September.
M Of 380 million children aged under five
in the developing countries, probably one-
quarter show signs of protein and calorie
malnutrition, reports WHO.
M 319 million tons of iron, 2.3 million tons
of lead and 6.5 million tons of phosphorus
from industry are carried down the world's
rivers to the sea each year.
MA 1,700 page bibliography of 23,000
works in or concerning the Slavic langua¬
ges and literatures is' being prepared in
Vienna under the sponsorship of the
Austrian National Commission for Unesco.
Exhibition on Unesco's
25 years opens in Paris
An exhibition to mark Unesco's 25th anni¬
versary is to be held at the French Radio-
TV Centre (Maison de I'O.R.T.F.) in Paris
from 10 to 21 November, 1971. Unesco's
work over a quarter of a century is gra¬
phically presented in a series of striking
displays and audio-visual devices. A com¬
puter terminal provides answers to visitors'
questions on Unesco, and there will be
continuous showings of a film specially
produced to portray Unesco's 25 years of
service to the world. Model, above, shows

This is Little Blue. Little Yellow is Little
Blue's best friend.
One day Mama Blue says to
Little Blue, "Wait for
me at home."
But Little Blue wants
to play with Little Yellow.
Where is Little Yellow?
he asks.
Little Blue and Little
Yellow, now both green
as could be, return home.
Suddenly they turn blue
and yellow again. Now
they will recognize us,"
they exclaim.
Now it dawns on them what
has happened.
\
Here he is.
But Papa and Mama Blue
say, You are notour Little
Blue, you are green.
Papa and Mama Blue are
overjoyed to see their Little
Blue again.
They rush to Papa and
Mama Yellow to tell them
the good news.
They hug each other
so hard that...
.they both turn green.
Papa and Mama Yellow say,
You are notour Little
Yellow, you are green."
Little Blue and Little
Yellow are very sad.
They burst into tears,
yellow and blue tears.
They kiss him and hug
him tight.
They also kiss and hug
Little Yellow. As they
do so, both turn green.
They all kiss and hug each
other with joy.
All become green
without envy.
END.
LITTLE BLUE
LITTLE YELLOW
Above, a condensed adaptation of text and drawings taken from a children's book, written and dra'-
by Leo Lionni of Italy. The book tells the story of Little Blue and Little Yellow whose skins are
different colour. This they find quite natural and as they hug and play their colours rub off again
each other until, finally, they both become green. Their parents, at first astonished, later recogni;
that green is as good as blue or yellow and in the hope of a world without colour conflict everyone
turns green without envy. A book for all the world's children, "Little Blue and Little Yellow" was
first published in English and has now appeared in Italian and French.
