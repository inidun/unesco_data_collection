Punic pendant
This little masterpiece of paste jewellery (actual size shown on right)
is a necklace pendant fashioned by a craftsman of ancient Carthage in
the form of a mask whose white face contrasts sharply with the deep blue
tones of the eyes, hair and beard. Founded by the Phoenicians about
750 B.C., Carthage quickly became the greatest commercial power in the
western Mediterranean, exporting to its overseas trading posts a wealth
of "mass produced" objects which, as we may judge from this pendant,
did not debase the ancient Phoenician tradition of elegant craftsmanship.

Cymatics is a new field of
research which studies the effects
of rhythmic vibrations in nature.
It reveals an ever-changing
world of unusual forms in which
figures appear, currents and
eddies are set in motion,
structures take shape and
pulsating patterns materialize.
The curious forms shown here
dance and leap upwards when
vibrations are transmitted to
a viscous liquid (see also photos

Throughout the living and non-living world we find patterns of recurrent
rhythms and periodic systems in which everything exists in a state of continual
vibration, oscillation and pulsation. These rhythmic patterns can be observed
not only in the beating of the heart, the circulation of the blood and the
inhaling and exhaling of breathing, but also in the recurrent formation of
cells and tissues, in the rhythmic movements of the oceans, the wave motion
of sound and hypersonic vibrations, and in the vast universe extending from
the cosmic systems of solar systems and galaxies down to the infinitesimal
world of atomic and nuclear structures. In the following article. Dr. Hans
Jenny, a Swiss scientist and artist, describes some of the experiments he has
carried out in a long study of these rhythmic vibrations and presents some of
the extraordinary results which this new field he has termed "Cymatics"
(from the Greek kyma, wave) already reveals to us. Dr. Jenny believes that
these experiments will give us new insight into the world of vibrations
terrestial and extra-terrestialand eventually serve fields of research as
diverse as astrophysics and biology.

CYMATICS
1 - Patterns of a world
permeated by rhythm
OiPUR world is permeated
throughout by waves and vibrations.
When we hear, waves travelling
through the air impinge. on our ears.
HANS JENNY was born in Basel, Switzerland,
and studied natural sciences and medicine.
For many years he has been in medical prac¬
tice at Dornach, near Basel. He is a natur¬
alist and painter and has undertaken exten¬
sive research into zoological morphology.
The problems of modern physiology and bio¬
logy led him to study the phenomena of
experimental periodicity, a field of research
that was extended to include the effects of
vibration, a new field he has termed "Cyma¬
tics.' Dr. Jenny's article reports on more
recent experiments carried out since he
published his original study, "Cymatics, the
Structure and Dynamics of Waves and Vibra¬
tions," highly illustrated with bilingual Ger¬
man-English text, published by Basilius Presse,
Basel, Switzerland, 1967.
When we speak, we ourselves generate
air waves with our larynx. When we
turn on our radios and televisions,
we are utilizing a waveband.' We talk
about electric waves and we are all
familiar with waves of light. In an
earthquake the whole earth vibrates
and - seismic waves are produced.
There are even whole stars which
pulsate In a regular rhythm.
But it is not only the, world we live
in that is in a state of vibration (atomic
vibrations are another example) for our
body itself is penetrated by vibrations.
Our blood pulses through tis in waves.
We can hear the beat- of the heart.
And above all our muscles go into a
state of vibration when we move them.

BIRTH OF A VORTEX
This photo, with its graceful curves and shimmering movements, is a detail of
a vortex in the course of formation. The pattern of flow of the vortex is clearly
visible because of the use of coloured dyes by the experimenter
which delineates each current sharply (see colour photo No. 7).
When we flex the muscles of our
arms and legs, they actually begin to
vibrate. It is even possible to hear
these muscle sounds and record them
with a telephone. All this means no¬
thing more or less than that the many
complicated chemical, energetic, bio¬
electric processes in the muscle fibres
take place in a series of vibrations.
This raises a problem: What tan¬
gible effects do wave and vibrational
processes produce in a specific mat¬
erial, in a particular milieu? The pur¬
pose of the studies reported here is
to provide an answer to this question.
Experiments have been devised to
display a whole world of curious phen¬
omena in which figures appear, cur¬
rents and eddies are formed, struc¬
tures take shape, harmonically pulsat¬
ing patterns can be seen, and so
forth.
Our first reaction to this whole world
of wave phenomena is one of astonish¬
ment; its features excite the wonder
of both the scientific investigator and
the artist. In studying all these phen¬
omena, however, we are concerned
not only with completed forms but
also with the ways in which they
come into being. Movement is annex¬
ed to form. Thus we may be said to
have the whole phenomenon before
our eyes.
This is something that can have a
particularly productive effect on the
mind of the creative artist. Not only
does the realized form appeal to us
through its beauty, but it also presents 7
itself to us as a living pattern of motion
which is revealed in, say, a heap of
sand. The vibration lays hold of the

WEAVING
BY SOUND
When liquids are made to
vibrate, very unusual
patterns result Above, a
cellular pattern, not unlike
those found in nature.
Right, scale-like structures
(technically know as
imbricate). When the
materials and frequencies
are changed the patterns
change and we see
beautifully structured
arrays, hexagonal,
rectangular and overlapping
patterns In the form of
honey-combs, networks and
lattices. Sometimes the
texture itself undergoes a
marked change and the
most astounding
displays result.
CYMATICS (Continued)
grains of sand and transports them in
a way determined by the arrangement
of the vibrational field.
Those artists in particular who are
interested in kinetic art will find here
a domain of nature in which kinetics
and dynamics have free play until a
configuration emerges. This high¬
lights a very important characteristic
of wave and vibrational processes: on
the one hand, there is movement and
an interplay of forces; on the other, the
creation of forms and figures.
But invariably both the kinetic and
the structural elements are sustained
by the vibrational process. Thus we
are always confronted by these three
components: vibration or wave which
is manifested in figures and in dyna¬
mics and kinetics. It is hardly an
exaggeration, then, to speak of a basic
triple phenomenon of vibration.
How are such experiments perform¬
ed. The German scientist E. Chladni
(1756-1827) was the first to show how
solid objects vibrate. He scattered
sand on a metal plate, making it
vibrate with a violin bow, so that the
sand formed a definite pattern of lines
characteristic of the sound heard. The
vibration transports the sand from spe¬
cific areas called loops into certain
linear zones. But the conditions of
the experiment could not be selected
at will nor could the results be seen
as a whole until new methods were
found.
One of these will be described by
way of example. What are known as
crystal oscillators were used. The lat¬
tice structure of these crystals is de¬
formed when electric impulses are
applied to them. If a series of such
impulses is applied to the crystal, it
begins to oscillate and the vibrations
actually become audible. These vibra¬
tions can be transmitted to plates,
diaphragms, strings, rods, etc. (photo
page 6 and colour photo number 5).
By means of this method conditions
can be freely selected, and accurately
determined: the number of vibrations
per second (frequency), the extent of
the vibratory movement (amplitude),
and the exact point of excitation are
all known with precision. Several
acoustic tones can be experimented
with at one and the same time; the
scope of the experiment can be extend¬
ed at will and, above all, each ex¬
periment is precisely reproducible.
With the aid of such methods, re¬
search can reveal a whole phenomen¬
ology of vibrational effects. The name
"cymatics" was chosen for this field
of study (kyma, Greek for wave, kyma-
tica, things to do with waves).

SPIRALLING
SANDS
Photos right and below show
how vibration produces rotational
effects. Here we have a steel
plate strewn with quartz sand.
On right we see piles of sand
rotating under vibration. Sand
is flowing river like, toward the
centre pile, in long, narrow
arms coming from various
directions. These forms strangely
recall the rotating, spiralling
masses observed by telescopes
in nebulae and other galactic
phenomena. Below, two
disc-shaped piles of sand have
been formed by the flow of
the sand streams. Each disc is
constantly rotating and has a
nipple of sand like a nucleus
in the centre.

CYMATICS (Continued)
2 - Music made visible
in a film of liquid
|T is possible to generate
vibrations systematically through a
continuous series of tones and to
transmit them to any object at will.
Consequently sonorous figures are not
the only phenomena produced (photos
page 6). Vibrational conditions are
found, called phases, in which the
particles- do not migrate into stationary
figures but form currents. These cur¬
rents run side by side in opposite dir¬
ections as if in obedience to a law.
The whole vibrational pattern is now
in motion.
These continuous waves also pro¬
voke rotary movement. The sand be
gins to turn round a point. These
rotary processes are continuous. The
masses are not ejected. If coloured
grains of sand are used to mark rotat¬
ing piles, the movement pattern re¬
vealed is continuous and due entirely
to vibration (photos page 9).
It is interesting to note that all the
phenomena of cymatics have not only
been photographed but, since move¬
ment is invariably involved, also film¬
ed. Still and motion pictures com¬
plement each other as documentation.
Just as vibration can be transmitted
to solid particles (sand, powder) it can
also be communicated to liquids. Once
again we find the whole spectrum of
cymatics. A richly diverse field of
structures appears. Delicate lattices
are generated. Then hexagonal, im¬
bricated (scale-like) and richly curved
patterns (photos pages 8 and 28) ap¬
pear. If the exciting tone Is removed,
all the formations naturally vanish.
Currents also occur in liquids. In a
film of liquid, bilaterally symmetrical
pairs of vortexes like those discovered
in the ear by Georg von Békésy rotate
in contrary directions (photo page 7
and colour photo number 7). These
pairs of vortexes are formed charac-

MOZART'S 'DON GIOVANNI'
Pattern (left) ¡s a musical sound from the 27th
bar of the overture of Mozart's opera "Don Giovanni".
The sound has been made visible by impressing the
sound vibration patterns on a film of liquid. Not only
the rhythm and volume become visible but also the figures
which correspond to the frequency spectrum exciting
them. The patterns are extraordinarily complex in the
case of orchestral sound. See also Bach photo next page.
CRESTS OF THE WAVE
Above, suggestive of gaping mouths in some bizarre mask of
Antiquity, these orifices are actually a series of wave crests
(photographed from above) produced when a viscous liquid
is irradiated with sound. When poured onto a vibrating membrane,
the fluid becomes a flowing, pulsating mass in which wave
formations soon appear. Changes in the amplitude and frequency
of vibrations and modifications to the viscosity of the liquid
produce further strange effects (see photos pages 13, 14, 15).

teristically in the cochlea of the ear
by the action of sound. The vortexes
appearing in the liquid can be made
visible by adding a few drops of
marker dye. They rotate continuously.
The louder the tone, the more rapid the
rotation.
Turbulences or unstable waves de¬
serve special mention (bottom photo
page 16). In the marginal areas of a
wave field or when two trains of waves
are contiguous, agitated wave for¬
mations appear which are constantly
changing. Vibration causes "turbu¬
lence" in liquid. It is a characteristic
of such turbulences that they sensitize
a medium (liquid, gas or a flame) to
the action of sound.
For example, it is only when a gas
flame is made turbulent that it becomes
receptive to irradiation by sound, i.e.
it is only then that it forms into son¬
orous figures. These turbulences are
important in the design of wind in
struments, e.g. the mouthpieces of
trumpets.
Since these experiments entail the
transmission of vibrational processes
in conformity with natural laws, it was
a logical step to attempt to visualize
music (photos pages 10 and below).
It is in fact possible with the aid of
diaphragms to make the actual vibra¬
tional patterns of music visible in films
of liquid. One and the same vibrat¬
ing diaphragm is used to radiate the
music and also to visualize the musical
processes in the sonorous figures ap¬
pearing in the liquid. In this way, we
see what we hear and we hear what
we see.
The eye is, of course, unaccustomed
to "seeing Mozart or Bach"; if films
of this visible music are shown with¬
out sound, it is by no means apparent
that what can be seen is, say, Mozart's
Jupiter Symphony. It is only when the
music is switched on that the aural im
pression can be experienced visually.
The question whether it is feasible
to visualize the human voice is a
particularly interesting one. A specially
designed apparatus called the tono-
scope (sound-seer) makes it possible
to produce without intermediate agency
the actual vibrational pattern of a vowel
(see colour photo number 6). The
figures reveal characteristic features
which reflect the spoken vowel and
its frequency spectrum, the pitch of
the vowel, and the individual voice of
the speaker. If conditions are con¬
stant, precisely the same form appears.
For deaf-mutes this visible speech
is a substitute for the normal person's
ability to hear himself. The deaf-mute
sees what he says. He can practise
producing in the tonoscope the same
forms as those made by persons with
normal hearing. If he succeeds in
doing so, this means he is producing

These shapes, leaping and gyrating like dancers in a frenzied ballet, are some of the
dynamic "sculptures" created during a series of experiments that demonstrate the amazingly
diverse effects produced by vibration under certain conditions. In these experiments,
a viscous fluid is poured onto a vibrating membrane, producing first one and then a series
of annular waves. By modifying the frequency, and the viscosity of the liquid, a changing
world of new forms is created, some of which are shown on the following page.

surging under the Impact of
volcanic forces, these remarkable photos
show a laboratory-size storm, created
by vibrating a liquid with the

the vibrations produced

When the liquid is made more fluid
and greater vibrations are used, the waves
rise still higher, lifting into plates,
pillars and peaks (below left). ' Finally,
the mass of liquid, filled with pulsations,
currents and turbulences, flings up
with dynamic force tiny droplets that
form a curtain of flying spume

IRON FILINGS AND SMOKE IN HIGH PITCH
Iron filings when vibrated in a magnetic field produce the craggy peak effect
seen above. Oscillation reduces the adhesion between the particles, providing
them with extra freedom of movement. Filings thus strewn in a magnetic field
subjected to vibration form mobile shapes which seemingly dance in the vibrational
field. Here, camera has temporarily frozen the dance of the Iron filings. Below,
a downward stream of smoke takes on a fabric-like appearance when irradiated
by high frequency sound. Becoming turbulent, the gas is sensitized to sound;
structures appear, their form depending on the sound waves.

the sounds correctly. In the same
way he can learn to pitch his voice
right and consciously regulate his flow
of breath when speaking.
To give some idea of the richness
and diversity of cymatic effects we will
look at one example more closely. If
vibration is applied to lycopodium
powder (spores of the club moss), the
results are curious and specific. The
particles of this powder are very fine
and of even consistency. If a plate
or diaphragm on which the powder has
been uniformly strewn is excited by
vibration, a number of circular piles
of powder form (photo below right).
This clumping in circular heaps is
extremely characteristic of cymatic
effects. These piles are in a constant
state of circulation, i.e. the particles
are transported from the inside to the
outside and from the outside back to
the inside by the vibration. This cir¬
culation is particularly typical of the
action of waves.
If the tone is intensified, which is
perceived by the ear as a crescendo,
the circular heaps gravitate together
and unite in a larger heap, which, how¬
ever, continues to circulate (photo
above right and centre spread, colour
photo number 4). If the tone is intens¬
ified still more, the masses are flung
into very violent motion. They are
thrown or even hurled out, yet the
process of circulation still continues.
A,ICTUAL currents can also
be produced in lycopodium powder.
The powder rushes along precisely
defined paths (photo page 30). If new
material is cast into such an area of
currents, the result is not chaos; in¬
stead the freshly added masses are
immediately assimilated into the system
of the vibrational field. Throughout all
the changes and transformations the
dynamics of the figure and the figura¬
tion of the dynamics are preserved.
When these conglobations move,
they do so in a characteristic manner.
They invariably move as a whole, and
if a process is put out, the rest of the
heap creeps after it just like an
amoeba. There- is no crumbling or
disintegration. Whether the heaps
unite to make larger ones or whether
they break up into a number of smaller
piles, they invariably form whole units.
Each of them is participative in the
whole in regard to both form and
process.
This brings us to a particular feature
of vibrational effects: they may be said
to exemplify the principle of whole¬
ness. They can be regarded as
models of the doctrine of holism: each

MIGRATION
TO THE CENTRE
When the spore powder of the club moss
(lycopodium) ¡s spread evenly on a
vibrating diaphragm, it forms a galaxy
of tiny piles (photo below). Each pile
rotates on its own axis and also rotates
as a single body like the elements of
our solar system. When the vibrations
are increased the piles migrate towards
the centre (photo left) in which the paths
of migration can be seen as streaky
lines. While forming large central pile,
they continue to rotate on the diaphragm.

single element is a whole and exhibits
unitariness whatever the mutations and
changes to which it is subjected. And
always it is the underlying vibrational
processes that sustain this unity in
diversity. In every part, the whole is
present or at least suggested.
To study vibrational effects in space,
first of all drops were made to vibrate.
Experiments with mercury showed that
the oscillating drops moved in regular
forms. Systems in arithmetical series
of 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, etc., appear, so that
it is legitimate to speak of harmonics
and symmetry. Pulsating drops of
water also reveal this polygonal ar¬
rangement with the difference, how¬
ever, that the liquid travels regularly
from the centre to the periphery and
from the periphery back to the centre.
It must be imagined, then, that these
vibrations take place roughly in sys¬
tems with 5, 4, and 3 segments. The
pictures formed are strikingly reminis¬
cent of the shapes of the flowers of
higher plants. Thus a true harmony
becomes apparent in the series of cy¬
matic processes.

E are taken still further
into the three-dimensional when soap
bubbles are excited by vibration (colour
photo number 8 and photos page 27).
These reveal a regular pulsation and
might be visualized as "breathing
spheres" The higher the tone produc¬
ing the oscillation, the larger the
number of pulsating zones.
Curious phenomena result from the
fact that adhesion between materials
and the supporting surface of plates
or diaphragms is reduced by vibration.
The particles or masses acquire a cer¬
tain freedom of movement as a result
of the reduced adhesion. If, for
example, iron filings are placed in a
magnetic field on a vibrating diaphragm,
adhesion between the filings and the
surface Is reduced and they become
to some extent mobile. They form
figurines which appear to dance in the
magnetic field and by their motion
reveal its density and configuration
(top photo page 16).
Changes in the state of matter are
also strangely influenced by vibration.
For instance, if a blob of hot, liquid
kaolin paste is allowed to cool while
being vibrated, it does not solidify in
a uniform mass but is so twisted and
churned that curious branch-like struc¬
tures are formed which are due simp¬
ly and solely to vibration.
The experiment results in a whole
array of structured elements which
eventually solidify (colour photo
number one).

1. KAOLIN CAKE
Curious configurations occur when a material is vibrated while it
is changing from liquid to solid. Here a blob of heated kaolin
paste forms a ribbed cake-like structure as It cools and solidifies.
The ribbed pattern pulsates and pushes currents of plastic kaolin
up the sides and down through the centre of the "cake". As the
kaolin grows rigid, branch-like formations begin to appear on the
outer ribs of the vibrating mass.

of red emulsion placed in a solution of black India ink, show a
periodic process in which no outside vibration Is used. The
emulsion slowly diffuses into the Ink with a periodic, rhythmic
to and fro movement, creating a pattern of thick serpentine
spurts and delicate formations that vanish like wisps of mist. It
must be imagined that everything is not only flowing, but
actually flowing in patterns and rhythms.

3. PHANTOM POTTER
This perfectly shaped double ring is not a finished design In
porcelain turned on a potter's wheel. It is a "fluid figure" formed
when highly viscous liquid Is vibrated on a diaphragm. Its static
appearence is deceptive. The entire structure Is in movement,
constantly rotating, with material flowing to the centre
and back again, the whole- generated and sustained" entirely
by vibration. (Other shapes created in this experiment are shown
on pages 11, 13, 14 and 15.)
4. LANDSCAPE IN THE ROUND
This dusty, petrified looking landscape,
recalling photos of the moon's surface, Is
composed of spores of the club moss
(lycopodium powder) set in motion by
vibration. Each circular mound of fine
powder, both large and small, is rota¬
ting on its own axis and the whole sur¬
face Is in Itself rotating and pulsating.
Patterns change according to the fre¬
quency of vibration. Increasing it can
create "sand storms" or unite tiny mounds
into a single large one, as seen In photos
on page 17.
5. THE SOUND OF COPPER
Inspired by the research of Ernst Chladnl, the 18th century Ger¬
man physicist and musician, who first demonstrated the modes of
vibration of solid objects, Hans Jenny, using more sophisticated
techniques, has assembled a collection of "sonorous" figures.
Sound pattern shown here was created on a steel plate strewn with
copper filings, and corresponds to a frequency of 2,200 cycles
per second.
6. VOWEL 'O'
The vowel "O" produces this vibrational pattern when spoken
into the tonoscope, or sound-seer, an apparatus designed to
visualize the basic components of human speech. Using the
tonoscope, deaf and dumb persons can familiarize themselves
with normal patterns of speech and practise producing the same
sound forms.
7. SOUND PATTERNS IN THE EAR
In these vortex patterns we see a vibrational model of the
hydrodynamlc behaviour of the cochlea, (the conical spiral tube
where hearing takes place In the Inner ear, and where vortexes
are formed by the action of ¿ound). Vortexes, made visible by
adding marker dye to liquid, are rotating continuously In opposite
directions. The louder tone, the more rapid the rotation.

BUBBLE DANCE
Some strange things can
happen to an ordinary
soap bubble when it is
made to vibrate on a
diaphragm. One can almost
say that it starts to "breathe"
as rhythmic pulsations
gather strength inside its surface.
The original sphere begins
to change shape. Photo
right shows an early
stage of pulsation,
becoming more complicated,
below, as vibrations increase.
Pulsations occur in
regular zones.
Colour photo, opposite,
shows whole soap
bubble, resembling a lovely
crystal wine-glass, in
full oscillation. They show how
three-dimensional shapes are
structured by vibration.

DOES SOME UNIVERSAL LAW
GOVERN FORMS IN NATURE?
The forms and configurations resulting from experiments in varying
the pitch of vibration often bear so strong a resemblance with
structural patterns found in nature, be it in plant or animal life
or the world of minerals, that one is tempted to see here some
fundamental law governing the creation of all forms In our universe.
The perfect honeycomb structure, left, was obtained by vibrating
a liquid with high frequency sound waves. The sculptured form
resembling a growing bud or coral formation, below, was creat¬
ed by varying the frequency of vibration of a viscous liquid. The
fishbone pattern, bottom right, was made by sound vibrations
in a film of glycerine. Cowrie shell or bean . shape, bottom left,
was produced when a paste-like substance was made to vibrate.

CYMATICS (Continued from page 18)
Nature is permeated by periodic and rhythmic processes In
many of which no actual vibration is involved. Circles,
left, known as "Liesegang rings", demonstrate one well
known periodic process in the field of chemical reactions.
When potassium bichromate is combined with silver nitrate
it forms silver Chromate in a remarkable, way: concentrating
the silver Chromate in a series of concentric rings proceeding
from the centre to the periphery in ever larger circles.
3 - The vast spectrum
of cosmic vibrations
iHE examples we have
given will afford some idea of the
wide field of research opened up by
vibrational effects. By scrutinizing
these curious structures, figures, flows
and movements, we widen our range
of vision. We are alerted to many
things which had hitherto gone un¬
noticed. Suddenly we realize to what
extent nature is permeated by rhythms
and periodicities.
It will be recalled that periodicity is
characteristic of organic cell tissue.
The elements of organisms are repeat¬
ed as fibre networks, as space lattices,
and quite literally as woven tissues
with an infinite diversity. The rhythms
of these forms are apparent to the
naked eye. The leaf patterns of plants
are an example. But in both the
optical and the electron microscope
the law of repetition still prevails.
In everyday life we meet with other
examples of rhythm, seriality and
periodicity. Every water jet, every
water surface, every drop of water
reveals complexes of a cymatic nature.
Whole oceans of wave trains, wave
fields and wave crests appear in cloud
formations. The smoke rising from a
chimney forms vortices and turbu¬
lences in a periodic manner. Wave
formation, turbulence, pulsation and
circulation are to be found throughout
the fields of hydrodynamics (colour
photo number 2) and aerodynamics.
By seeing all these phenomena as
an integrated whole the observer
comes to develop what is really an
intuitive faculty for rhythmic and perio¬
dic things. He begins to appreciate the
cymatic style of nature. This applies
with particular force to the creative
artist. Numerous contacts with archi¬
tects, painters, graphic and industrial
designers have shown that for them
cymatics cannot be merely a matter
of copying sonorous figures or adopt¬
ing them purely as'. decoration.
A .productive confrontation with
cymatics lies rather in this: let us sup¬
pose that someone is working with
geometrical shapes, say with squares
or circles. Using these elements he
constructs his designs. But the forms
he is handling are finished and com¬
plete: the nascent element is absent.
Yet he must be aware that everything
has its origin and genesis.
Now this generative process is one
that he can experience particularly well
in the field of waves and vibrations.
On seeing a sonorous figure take
shape, one cannot help but say: the
creative process is just exactly where
"nothing" can be seen, and the points
whither the particles of sand and
powder are carried are the very places
where there is no movement. The
figure must take shape out of its
environment; bound up with the finish¬
ed form is the circumambient space
creating it. With each thing shaped
goes the experience of that which
shapes it; with each thing fashioned,
of that which fashions it. In this way
the space round things becomes vital¬
ized for the sculptor, the architect and
the painter. The rigid form is seen
in terms of that which gave it birth.
But the converse case is also illum¬
inated by the study of cymatic pro¬
cesses. Let us suppose someone's
interest is focused on kinetics, on
moving elements and the interplay of
forces. Then he is confronted by the
problem of how a configuration can
emerge from such a mobile system.
How is a dynamic process related to
form, to a specific figure? Here again,
thinking of the problem in terms of
vibration provides the answer, for
however great the changes and trans¬
formations, precise figurai aspects
prevail in the vibrational field. Even
turbulences, for all their instability,
have a formative, repetitive element.
Hence wave phenomena and vibra¬
tional effects form a kind of totality
(colour photo number 3, and photos
pages 11, 13, 14 and 15). They throw
an explanatory light on the process
of formation as much as on that
which ultimately takes shape; they
illuminate movement as well as the
stationary form. And here again it is
a question of looking behind these
fixed forms to see what generative
process leads to them. The obvious
procedure is to find out what stages
precede the figured shapes and to
scrutinize them closely. And this
brings us to the significance of cyma¬
tic phenomena.
First of all it must be said that mere
similarity between natural phenomena
and the results of experiments do not
warrant the conclusion that there is
any essential identity. Undoubtedly
many wave effects look like various
natural phenomena. But interpreta¬
tion and analogizing lead nowhere;
they miss the heart of the matter.
What is involved here is this. The
observation of vibrations and waves
yields a whole series of specific and
particular categories of phenomena.
It also shows that these diverse ele¬
ments appear in a vibrational system
as a whole. In one and the same
vibrational system we find structural,
pulsating, and dynamic-kinetic fea¬
tures, etc. Thus we can say that
when dealing with vibrational systems,
. there will appear in them, appropriately
transformed, the cymatic effects
we have observed in our experiments.
Experiments thus provide us with
conceptual models which can stimul¬
ate research. Needless to say, each
field must be understood in its own
terms. However, experience with
cymatics tutors the intuitive faculty
in such a way that attention is drawn
to many interrelated facts which would
previously have gone unheeded. Thus
while it must be firmly reiterated that
all interpretation is pointless, it must
be borne in mind that in actual fields
of experience the effects of natural
cymatics must be apparent.
Let us take the example of astro¬
physics. There can be no doubt that
in this field specific vibrational effects
must appear on the lines we have
indicated. A compilation of cymatic QQ
phenomena embraces a whole range £j
of features and relationships for
which appropriate verification must be
discoverable in astronomy, whether

CYMATICS (Continued)
planetary, solar, or galactic. From
this point of view it is self-evident that
in the vast energy processes of the
cosmos, oscillating and vibrating sys¬
tems must become manifest in conglo-
bations, rotations, pulsations, circula¬
tions, interferences, vortexes, etc.
In this connexion, for instance,
experiments have been made in which
materials reacting to magnetic influen¬
ces have been observed under the
action of vibration in the magnetic
field (photo page 4). Thus in magneto-
hydrodynamics remarkable elements
appear which owe their character
entirely to vibration. In both structural
and dynamic respects these magneto-
hydrodynamic events are characterized
by vibration. It would be legitimate to
speak of magnetocymatics. What has
to be done is to find corresponding
phenomena in cosmic magnetic fields.
It is certainly not our intention to
encroach on the preserves of astro¬
nomers and astrophysicists. Our only
purpose is to report on the results
of this or that series of experiments.
How the corresponding patterns take
shape in the cosmos can only be
determined by research in that par¬
ticular field.
Biology might also be adduced as
a further example of the way in which
conceptual models can be abstracted
and serve for research purposes. In
particular, cymatic research can pene¬
trate into the very heart of the bio¬
logical field. The phenomena reported
in this study are all macroscopic.
However, it has proved possible to
demonstrate cymatic effects in the
microscopic dimension, i.e. it is pos¬
sible to apply the cymatic method in
all its variations to cell processes.
These current investigations open
the way not only to observing cell
processes with respect to their rhyth¬
mic and oscillatory characteristics but
also, and more importantly, to study¬
ing the influence of vibration and its
effects on healthy and sick tissues
and on normal and degenerate cells.
That the carcinomatous (cancer) pro¬
cess should loom large in the field of
study follows inevitably from its very
nature.
The task confronting us, then, is to
induce specific vibrational effects in
cellular events and to scrutinize the
* structural and functional results with
respect to cell division, cell respira¬
tion, tissue growth, etc. selectively.
In this way the models and basic
phenomena of experimental physics
are brought into conjunction with ideas
of vibration as a cosmogenic element
which Rudolf Steiner, inspired by his
research in the sphere of the mind
and spirit, formulated 60 years ago
regarding astrophysics and biology.
The work summarily reported here
is in full swing. One series of experi¬
ments is followed by another. It lies
in the character of the subject that
each experiment points the way to
the next; the investigator is led by
ml
ci
Nature from one stage of study to
another. And on the way he observes
a number of periodic phenomena
which are not produced by vibration
in the strict sense of the word.
In this connexion we might single
out rhythmic chemical precipitations,
the so-called Liesegang rings (photo
page 29) rhythmic crystallization, rhy¬
thmic processes in colloidal solutions,
the periodic formation of semi-per¬
meable membranes, etc. Thus there
is evidence that periodicity is also
active in the field of chemical reac¬
tions. (It might be intimated that this
line of research is bringing us close
to the problems of catalysis).
Where do all these experiments
lead? What significance can they
have for human life in general? 0uite
apart from all the many practical
applications adumbrated by these stud¬
ies, one aspect is paramount: they
teach us Lo observe the world in such
a way that our experience of it is
stimulated, enriched and deepened.
But besides its richness, this exper¬
ience enables the scientist and the
artist, the investigator and the design¬
er, and thus basically every /nan, to
develop his own essential being and
personality.
These two photos (above
and left), are not only
interesting graphically in
themselves, but show a most
extraordinary phenomenon
of our vibrating whirling
universe. In each photo

as if in obedience to a

DEATH OF A BRIDGE
BY VIBRATION
SJtm

Like a violin string vibrated by a bow, a suspension bridge strung
between its high towers is vibrated by winds. Soldiers crossing a
bridge in column always break step to prevent the bridge from "entering
into vibration" as the second prong of a tuning fork does when the
first prong is struck. Vibrations can reach the point where they set
up strains and stresses powerful enough to bring a bridge crashing
down. These spectacular photos show in sequence the disastrous
effects of the Tacoma bridge in vibration (State of Washington, U.S.A.),
when its main span collapsed on November 7, 1940. (1) A 70 km.
(45 mph) wind sets the bridge vibrating, causing it to twist and sway.
Twisting effect worsened Swhen a suspension cable came loose.
(2 3) As vibrational forces increase, roadway is twisted and wrenched
upwards (about 35 degrees from the horizontal) as shown by automobile
being tilted first one way then the other. (4/5) Vibrations have built
up to a critical pitch, tearing away the whole centre span. Below, the
main span has disappeared; only a jagged section of side wall remains.
Another spectacular example is Venice, where vibrations from waves
and tidal currents during many centuries and more recently from
ocean-going ships and power boats have inflicted grievous damage
on the city's ancient buildings and monuments.

QUASARS
AND THE BIRTH
OF THE UNIVERSE

L OOKING upwards on a
clear night, we see myriads of stars,
thousands upon thousands of them
twinkling in the dark sky. The bright¬
est stars are visible to the naked
eye up to some thousands of light-
years away. With the aid of tele¬
scopes they can be distinguished at
distances thousands of times greater,
up to some millions of light-years.
At a greater distance still, individual
stars can no longer be distinguished,
although they can be seen as galaxies,
similar to our own of which the sun
is part. These galaxies comprise
thousands and hundreds of thousands
of millions of stars. The total light
emitted by such galaxies can be
recorded up to distances of some
thousands of millions of light-years.
The light we register on a photo¬
graphic plate began its journey at a
time when life had barely commenced
on earth.
And yet we can probe In this way
only a minute portion of the universe.
We should have to penetrate much
further into the depths of space and
time to discover the structure and the
history of the universe. The heavenly
bodies, stars and galaxies we can see
now began to form more than ten
thousand million years ago. It would
therefore be necessary to go back at
least ten thousand million years into
the past in order to understand the
history of the genesis of matter.
Before Copernicus, man had a
simple picture of the universe. Its

centre was the earth, the natural focus
for the condensation of matter.
Copernicus removed the terrestrial
globe from this privileged position.
The Neapolitan philosopher Gior¬
dano Bruno, an admirer of Copernicus
and friend of Galileo, had already
conceived the notion of an infinite
number of worlds all of equivalent
importance. From then on the
universe was represented as being
full of heavenly bodies distributed
uniformly in space and time and of
homogeneous density, in the same
way that the molecules of gas are
distributed in a storage tank.
.At first the stars and our sun were
taken as being the molecules of this
cosmic gas. But, following the work
of the U.S. astronomer, Edwin Hubble,
the galaxies those islands of matter
containing thousands of millions of
stars have become the molecules of
cosmology.
However, things are not quite so
simple. Galileo taught that the same
laws of physics are applicable in the
heavens as on earth. If we attempt
to apply the laws of universal
gravitation to a gas of infinite extent,
like that in which the galaxies are
molecules, a simple calculation shows
that this gas could not be in a state
of equilibrium. Either the force of
attraction will prevail or the cosmic
repulsion will predominate. A gas
formed of galaxies must of necessity
either expand or contract.
In 1926 observations made by
Hubble showed that the universe is
receding. The further into the depths
of space we look the faster are the
galaxies we can see receding from us.
All these observations have con¬
firmed Hubble's law that the speed of
recession of galaxies is proportional
to their distance from us.
Galaxies at a distance of a thousand
million light-years have a recession
speed of 30,000 kilometres per second,
that is a tenth of the speed of
light. Those that are twice as far
away two thousand million light-
years are receding from us twice as
fast, and so on. The universe is not
a static, invariable formation. It
unfolds before us a picture that
changes with time.
Living in an evolving universe we
cannot but speculate as to what took
place in the past and what is to happen
in the future. How long will this
recession, this expansion of the
universe continue? If it is to continue
indefinitely the galaxies will end up at
such vast distances one from the
other that the light emitted from one
galaxy will no longer be able to reach
even those galaxies that at one time
were closest. Is our own galaxy, the
Milky Way, destined then to float like
a solitary island in the void?
s>IUPPOSE that we, as it
were, run the film backwards towards
the past. We should then see the
galaxies getting closer to one another,
and it can be deduced that about ten
thousand million years ago all the
matter of the universe was very highly
condensed. Expansion must have
taken place from an extremely dense
state and have begun in a manner
similar to an explosion.
Many astronomers, relying on the
Friedman calculations, have adopted
this hypothesis of an original state in
which matter was very dense and have
attempted to deduce from it, by
calculation, the various conditions
observable in the universe as it now
is. Others have had some reserva¬
tions about this, pointing out that a
chain of deduction going so far back
is at the mercy of the slightest cir¬
cumstance that might have been over¬
looked.

8.000 MILLION LIGHT YEARS

Palomar University, California
available with the discovery In 1965-
1966 of radio waves coming from the
depths of space.
In the range of metric waves and
above, we can distinguish radio
emissions from galaxies and various
extra-terrestrial bodies. In the milli-
metric wave range, emissions originate
from our atmosphere and the iono¬
sphere. But in the intermediate, centi-
metric range there was silence.
In probing this silent range more
closely weak thermal radiation was
discovered. This incoherent radiation
does not originate from known
heavenly bodies nor from a particular
sector of the sky. It ¡s a background
noise that fills the entire universe in
a homogeneous manner and Is identi¬
cal In all directions. It corresponds
to a temperature of 3 degrees
absolute, that is to say 270 degrees
below zero centigrade (1).
This background radiation is appar¬
ent as a weak radio noise, but when
it is considered that it is present
uniformly throughout the universe its
importance becomes evident. It con¬
tains a thousand million times as many
photons as there are atoms in the
universe and the energy density of
the radiation is a hundred thousand
times greater than that of the light
coming from all the stars.
If we make the deduction that in
the past the universe occupied a
smaller and smaller volume of space,
the further we go back in time, we
find greater and greater intensities of
radiation and higher and' higher
radiation temperatures. Since the
temperature today is three degrees
absolute, then five thousand million
years ago it must have been six
degrees absolute, and thirty degrees
absolute 7,000 million years ago.
MESSAGES 8,000 MILLION YEARS OLD
Six years ago, a lively new branch of astronomy was born with the publication in the
March 1963 issue of the English journal Nature of four papers by Australian and American
scientists reporting the discovery of mysterious celestial objects, now known as quasars
or QSOs (quasi-stellar objects). Since that date our knowledge of quasars has grown
steadily. Above left, Quasar 3-C-9 (arrowed) a tiny luminous dot in space visible through,
a powerful telescope. Its light, reaching earth after 8,000 million years (at a speed of
300,000 km. a second), is helping scientists to reconstruct cosmic events as old as the
birth of our own galaxy. Comparative distances shown in drawings above and below help
us to visualize the awe-inspiring dimensions of the universe.

QUASARS (Continued)
There is only one possible ex¬
planation for such a large number of
photons in space. They were produc¬
ed in the heart of matter that is highly
condensed and extremely hot, just as
it must have been 10,000 million years
ago when the universe began to
expand.
From this starting point, with the
radiation spreading over a greater and
greater volume, the temperature
diminishes. At three degrees abso¬
lute, radiation today bears witness
that the starting point for the expan¬
sion of the universe was a special
state of matter with the temperature
doubtless exceeding a billion degrees
and with radiation predominating over
atomic matter (1).
A<
34
ICCORDING to Jacob Zel-
dovitch's calculations, during the first
second of expansion the temperature
dropped to ten thousand million de¬
grees, and, at the end of the first mi¬
nute, to some millions of degrees. At
this point matter began to dominate
with the formation of the first atomic
nuclei. During the first ten million
years the temperature dropped to four
thousand degrees and, in the heart of
the ionised plasma, neutral atoms, that
is to say atoms having their full com¬
plement of peripheral electrons, were
able to form.
After that, vast clouds of gas were
able to develop, each of them forming
the basis of a galaxy. Gradually the
universe took on the aspect that we
know today and we move from the
realms of misty speculation to those of
scientific research based on observa¬
tion.
Naturally, the residual radiation at
three degrees absolute gives only a
confused picture of the birth of atoms
and galaxies without providing any
details. The information that can be
drawn from the present state of atomic
matter gives a no less distorted pic¬
ture.
Heavy elements are being formed
continuously in the universe of today.
It is, then, almost impossible to deduce
from our present knowledge the origi¬
nal proportion of the elements and,
hence, the density and temperature
conditions prevailing at the beginning.
This is why astronomers would find it
of inestimable value if direct undis-
torted evidence, providing specific
information about the initial phase of
the universe, were to be discovered.
In fact we should need beacons
visible at enormous distances, a billion
times brighter than the stars and a
hundred times brighter than the
galaxies, to find our way far enough
into the depths of space and time to
be able to discover there the structure
of our universe.
Now it is precisely such beacons
that astronomers believe were dis¬
covered during the early years of this
decade. These stars have been
named quasars, a word formed from
the contraction of the phrase "quasi-
stellar". In fact they are galaxies of
a particular kind which were at first
mistaken for stars.
Quasar 3-C-9, which has been iden¬
tified both optically and by radio-
telescope, has a light spectrum whose
rays are displaced 215 per cent
towards the longer wave lengths. If,
as is generally accepted, this "red-
shift", as it is called, is due to the
velocity of recession, and if this
velocity is proportional to distance
(in other words, if our universe is
expanding), this redshift corresponds
to a recession velocity of 240,000 kilo¬
metres per second and to a distance
of eight thousand million light-years.
The astonishing thing is that these
stars emit enough light or radiation
energy to be discernible at such
distances. Their output of energy can
be estimated at more than a billion
times the light of the sun.
Beyond this distance the objects
are too pale for it to be possible to
measure their redshift and our optical
telescopes can probe no further. But
eight thousand million light-years
indicates that the light from Quasar
3-C-9 has been travelling for that
length of time. To look at this
quasar- is, therefore, to look eight
thousand million years into the past,
that is to say, to cover about 80 per
cent of the history of our universe.
I
(1) In this text "Billion" is used In the
English sense to mean a million million.
though at present
eight thousand million light-years
appears to be the extreme limit for
optical observation, radio-astronomy
can take us further. In fact, radio
sources of the same type as quasars
and weaker than 3-C-9 have been
detected by radiotélescopes. If we
assume that all these radio sources
have the same absolute intensity, their
apparent intensity allows us to estimate
the range of our radiotélescopes as
being nine thousand million light-
years. This range is largely exceeded
by the new giant radiotélescope sited
in a natural bowl at Arecibo, Puerto
Rico (See "Galaxies Caught in a Steel
Mesh," "Unesco Courier", Jan. 1966).
It is expected that the new radio-
telescope will be able to record
emissions from radio galaxies and qua¬
sars situated at distances of ten to
twelve thousand million light-years. This
means that it will be possible, so
to speak, to listen to a direct broad¬
cast of the beginnings of the universe.
This possibility, which just a few
years ago would have been consid¬
ered fantastic, has become a reality
thanks to the extraordinary intensity
of the quasars' output both of light
and radiation. Their radio emission
is the result of one or several
explosions which, at the same time,
heated the central nucleus in such
a manner that it could shine like a
million suns for a million years or
longer. Radio emission from the
radio galaxies is due to an explosion
of a similar kind, but perhaps less
intense.
These beacons in space can be
used as triangulation points from
which to map the entire stellar field
in space and in time. This is not just
a hope for the far off future. The
map-making venture has already begun
and the results obtained are of
enormous interest.
w HAT can we assume about
the behaviour of quasars throughout
time? During the hundred thousand
years that followed the first flash, ra¬
diation must have been of constant
intensity. From then on the strength
of the radiation began to decrease ex¬
ponentially. A million years after this
spark-off the power of radiation was
already only a thousandth of what
it had been at the start, and after ten
million years it had again diminished
a thousand times. At this point the
quasar fades to the extent that it
is no longer discernible. No quasars
have been detected whose age has
been assessed at more than a few
million years.
Their distance and their distribution
in space can be calculated by their
apparent intensity. It then becomes
noticeable that their density in space
is more or less homogeneous within
the limits of one to two million light-
years. Beyond this distance the
number of quasars appears to increase
in all directions. Their density
doubles (Tver a spherical layer with
a radius of some thousands of millions
of light-years. Beyond that it dimin¬
ishes again strongly and, at the radio
horizon, nine thousand million light-
years away, the density is only a
fiftieth of that observed in the close
range.
In reality, this arrangement in space
expresses evolution in time, the
quasars being observed at distances
that correspond to the date of their
existence. If quasars seem to us
to be more numerous at a distance
of some thousands of millions of
light-years, this is because in that
distant period of time their eruptions
were more frequent.
If we look further still, we see
scarcely any quasars, despite the fact
that our radiotélescopes are now
powerful enough to detect radio
sources even further away. This is
because we are reaching back into
an era preceding the first quasars.
If we can liken quasars to the
nuclei of galaxies burning themselves

THE WEAVING OF AN
ENGINEERING MASTERPIECE
-A SPIDER'S ORB WEB
A step-by-step analysis by a structural engineer
of the extraordinary way a spider builds its web
by Bert E. Dugdale Text copyright © Reproduction prohibited
E,_,ARLY one morning in
August of 1942, at Fayson Lakes, New
Jersey, an opportunity came to me
that I had watched for, but missed,
BERT E. DUGDALE is a retired Ameri¬
can structural engineer. His interest in
spiders began as a child. Later, in his
professional life he was struck by the
similarities between the problems faced
by a spider building a web and those
that confront construction engineers. This
led him to undertake the painstaking
observation of the actual weaving of a
web. His article originally appeared in
"Natural History", the journal of the
American Museum of Natural History,
New York, in March 1969.
for many years. A spider had just
completed placing the structural sup¬
porting lines for a web. Realizing that
this was my opportunity to study the
step-by-step construction of a spider
web, I hurriedly assembled my draw¬
ing board and paper, my pencils, and
a six-foot rule, so that I could record
as carefully as possible the steps to
completion. My chair was placed so
that I was about an arm's length from
the weaver as I watched it.
As the spider added new elements
to the web, I added corresponding
new lines to my sketch, along with
noting the order in which the lines
were being made. The spider kept
me busy indeed, and I had little time
to ponder the engineering significance
of what it was doing. After both of
us were through with our work, we
each went about our own affairs. The
sketch eventually ended up in my
filing cabinet at home.
Twenty-three years later, in the
course of shifting papers, I found it
again, and it fascinated me. I began
plotting the stages of the spider's
work on different sheets of paper,
and only then, as step-by-step I traced
what it had been doing, did I begin
to realize the full significance of the
pattern it had followed a pattern
corresponding to a detailed blueprint
that left little to chance.

SECOND STAGE
ENGINEERING MASTERPIECE (Continued)
An innate sense of geometrical precision
36
the spider had worked, alongside my
family's log cabin, one of several
inhabited by nature-loving vacationers
in summer. About two metres (6 ft.)
from the corner of the cabin was a
rocky knoll, with a small bush sprout¬
ing out of a crevice in the rock. A
branch of a larger plant, a hazel bush,
reached over the knoll toward the
cabin. Between the cabin and the
knoll grew a small patch of wild irises,
daisies, asters, and other wild wood¬
land flowers in their season.
It is probable that the protection
provided by the overhanging eaves of
the cabin, the presence of the protrud¬
ing corner logs, the pathway between
the cabin and the wild flower bed,
and the stone steps leading up to the
rocky knoll all combined to produce
an ideal location for an orb-weaving
spider to set up housekeeping.
Many times, over a span of several
years, I had seen orb webs suspended
almost vertically in this exact location,
and I had watched numerous spiders
of several species carrying on various
stages of web construction there
indeed, I had often walked into these
webs while fetching firewood.
It is also probable that on that morn¬
ing the favourable air currents around
the cabin, and the prospect that insects
attracted by the flowers would fly
head-on into the hanging web, were
bonus inducements that caused one
Micrathena gracilis, an orb-weaving
spider, to start spinning its silken lines.
Of a species reported to be widely.
distributed in North America, it was
grayish in colour, about 6 mm. (1/4 in.)
in length, and its abdomen was
armed with distinctive spines as well
as the more conventional pairs of
appendages called spinnerets. It is
through these organs that spiders
excrete threads of silky material.
The entire process took about two
and one-half hours and consisted of
four stages, which can be described
as follows:
First Stage: Placing structural sup¬
porting lines to provide a triangular-
shaped framework for the web, which
would itself be roughly 15 cm. (6 in.)
in diameter (drawing I shows the
scene when first observed, and the
establishment of the web centre).
Second Stage: Completing a system
of radial lines to connect the web
centre with the surrounding framework
(drawings 2 to 4).
Third Stage: Building a temporary
scaffolding spiral, extending from the
web centre to the outer frame (draw¬
ing 5).
Fourth Stage: Installing the final
viscid spiral webbing and removal of
the scaffolding (drawing 6).
STAGE ONE: When I first observed
the web, it already had the three main
supporting lines, with crosslines C-D
and E-F in place (drawing 1), thus com¬
pleting the polygonal, outer web fram¬
ing, BCDEFA (except for a crossline
between A and B, which was not
placed until later),.
The spider had also reinforced each
main structural line by traversing it
from time to time, adding a new strand
on each passage. These strands fann¬
ed out at the anchorage points to
provide multiple attachments (a com¬
mon human practice when anchoring
the cables of a large suspension
bridge).
The spider now proceeded to estab¬
lish the web centre (drawing 1). First,
it attached a free-running line at point
1 on AF; then, moving through point
F down to ED, it attached the other
end at point 2. A quick movement
of the spider's spinnerets fastened
the line sufficiently well.
Now it moved up this line and,
approximately midway between 1 and
2, attached one end of another line.
Again spinning out a line as it went,
the spider carried it down to 2 and
then along DC to line CB, where the
other end was attached at point 3.
This time the line was pulled taut
before it was attached. It was this
pull that brought radial lines 1, 2 and
3 to the positions shown on drawing 1.
The conjunction of these first three
radiais determined the web centre,
which was then stabilized by the plac¬
ing of radiais 4, 5 and 6.
The1 web frame, with the initial
radiais 1 through 6, was not in a com¬
pletely vertical plane; it was inclined
about 15 degrees off vertical, with the
upper part leaning away from me.
I was not sure on which side the

THIRD STAGE FOURTH STAGE
Spider has constructed a spiral
scaffolding, laid anticlockwise from
the centre, which will be removed in
stage 4. Lines marked "X" are partial
radiais added to facilitate scaffold
construction. When the spider reached
the outer end of radial 14, it reversed
direction and made a full circuit to
complete the scaffold spiral at radial 1 1 .
Scaffold completed, the weaver now
installs the sticky spiral web that will
serve to catch prey. The web, this time
laid clockwise starting from the
outside, has an average diameter of
17 cm. (six and a half inches). Spider
then cuts a hole at centre of web,
giving itself access to either side. It
then waits for vibrations, the tell-tale
sign that a victim has been trapped.
spider would operate, but inasmuch as
viewing was most convenient with my
back to the sun, all my observations
and sketches of the web were made
with the spider working from the other
side. This was fortunate. As the
weaving proceeded, my position
afforded close-ups of the weaver's
use of abdomen, legs, mandibles, and
spinnerets.
Having now established a web
centre the spider proceeded to the
second stage of construction.
STAGE TWO (drawings 2 to 4): A
complete system of radial lines joining
the centre point to the several enclos¬
ing framework lines was now put
into place.
The method of installing the addi¬
tional radiais was like that for the
initial radiais, except that each new
radial was first attached to the centre
and then carried to a selected location
on the enclosing frame. The spider
was adept at holding a hind leg high
and keeping the freerunning line from
becoming entangled with existing lines.
The fact that the spider was working
on the underside of the off-vertical
web many have helped, as gravity
would tend to draw its body and the
free line away from the web plane.
If the reader will run his eyes over
the radiais in their numerical sequence,
starting with the three initial lines, he
must be impressed by the fact that
never was a new radial placed adja¬
cent to one just laid, but always at
a distance from it, so as to continually
equalize the tensions on the system
and thereby maintain the location of
the web centre. Otherwise, because
of the elasticity of the fibres, the
centre would have constantly shifted
to new points, and the polygonal form
of the framework would have assumed
ever changing shapes and distortions.
Drawings 1 to 3 show the structural
frame as straight lines. This was not
actually the case. As each new radial
was attached to a frame line, the
tension placed upon that line caused,
it to deflect to a more curved line.
For convenience in field sketching,
I kept the straight-line form for the
frame, until all the radiais were placed.
When radiais 20 and 21 were plac¬
ed, there was as yet no cross member
from A to B. The spider, after plac¬
ing 21, went back down it without
hesitancy, up 20 to A, then returned
the same way with a running line that
became crossline AB and was attach¬
ed to radial 6 at their intersection
point. The full polygonal frame,
ABCDEF, was now complete, and
other radiais could be attached to AB.
It is of interest to note that during
this selective method of locating the
radiais, in only one instance was a
new one anchored too near an existing
radial, and that was 22, adjacent to
radial 2. In a few cases there was
too much space between radiais. In
each case the spider later filled the
gaps with partial radiais.
That an apparently deliberate method
was used by the spider to maintain
the approximate web shape estab¬
lished by the first six radiais is sug¬
gested when the next eight radiais
are studied (drawing 2).
Lines 8, 10, and 13 are well dispers¬
ed between points A and F, and radiais
7, 11, and 14 are similarly spaced
between points B and C. Further
evidence of deliberate planning at this

A SPIDER THAT
SIGNS ITS NAME
The Argiope, a tiny spider (right) found widely
in Europe, is easy to spot because of its
bright yellow abdomen crossed with black
stripes. It has also the unique characteristic
of signing its name to its web with a zig-zag
band of silk fixed between two radial lines.
NEW SKINS FOR OLD
This greatly enlarged photo of a spider's leg in the process
of moulting (below) recalls the delicate brush strokes of a
classical Chinese ink drawing. Old claws being shed with

stage is seen in the placing of num¬
bers 15 through 21.
Again, in drawing 3, one sees that
tensions on the centre of the web
remain balanced by the spider through
its choice of radial locations for lines
22 through 33. With so many radiais
now in place, further care in spacing
would not have been necessary, yet
the weaver continued its careful selec¬
tion of locations as radiais 34 through
44 (drawing 4) were added.
STAGE THREE: With all full-length
radiais in place, the weaver proceeded
with the next item of construction, the
scaffolding, which would be removed
after serving its purpose. It consisted
of a spiral starting from the centre and
continuing to the outer perimeter of
the web (drawing 5).
The first seven circuits of the spiral
were spaced very closely, about .8 mm.
to 2.4 mm. (1/32" to 3/32") apart. The
next four or five were spaced 6.3 mm.
to 8 mm. (1/4" to 5/16") apart, and
9.5 mm. (3/8") apart. To maintain an
even spacing the spider kept a foot
on the preceding circuit as it hurried
around the web.
Several interesting examples of
what appeared to be decision making
occurred during this stage. At a few
places where radiais were too far
apart and the spider would have to
stretch to reach the next one, it dis¬
continued the spiral and installed a

after removal of scaffolding
partial radial long enough to reach the
outer frame, and held in place by
existing scaffolding. The partial radiais
are marked X on drawing 5.
Again, when the spider had run the
scaffold line to the outer end of radial
14 on what could have been the last
lap, it immediately reversed direction,
and made a full circuit, terminating the
scaffold line where radial 11 joined
the outer frame.
It is at this point that the spider
began the final stage of construction
spinning the viscid, or sticky, webb¬
ing, while simultaneously removing
the scaffolding. The purpose of the
stickiness, of course, is to trap prey
for the spider. The viscid filaments
are so effective that insects, once
enmeshed, seldom escape. The
spider, which itself may be bothered
by the adhesive, exhibits much dex¬
terity in running about the web without
getting into trouble.
When constructing the web, it can
exude either dry or' viscid fibre. The
dry is used for all purposes except
catching victims. In the first three
stages of construction, every filament
was of the dry, non-sticky type. I
know this because I repeatedly tested
the lines for adhesiveness.
However, the filaments may vary in
makeup. The spinnerets of the spider
can be controlled to produce either
round, dry lines, each comprising a
bundle of several strands held together
as a unit, or a flatter, ribbonlike line.
Sometimes the dry line may have a
succession of sticky beads. But this
is a special case. Observers have
found that there is a viscid layer on
such a filament when it is emitted, but
the layer then forms a succession of
beads.
STAGE FOUR: We have seen that
the spider terminated the scaffold spiral
at radial 11, after having reversed
direction at radial 14 the previous time
around. Whether planned or not, this
reversal served a useful purpose, for
without a second's hesitancy the
weaver proceeded to spin the viscid
spiral, this time starting from the
outside, instead of from the centre
(drawing 6).
During this final phase of construc¬
tion, the spider had better footing than
previously; it could step on the dry
scaffolding lines as well as the radiais.
This does not mean that the viscid
spiral conforms exactly to the contour
of the scaffolding. Several circuits
of the viscid line were made for each
circuit of the scaffold.
As the viscid fibres were indistin¬
guishable from the scaffold fibres by
sight, it was difficult, while making
drawing 6, to discern the scaffold
lines in areas where they were cross¬
ed or overlapped by viscid lines. Only
later, in the final moments of the
spinning, did it become clear that the
scaffold lines were gone.
When the spinning was completed
a ball of white material was visible at
the centre of the web. This material
the spider consumed. Theodore Sav¬
ory, in his The Biology of Spiders,
informs us that as the viscid fibre
approaches the next turn of scaffold¬
ing, that turn is rolled up by the spider;
thus accounting for the accumulated
ball at the finish.
Different1 species of spiders have
characteristic patterns for their web
centres. Micrathena gracilis, after
consuming its discarded scaffolding,
actually cut out the centre area of the
web to provide an opening through
which it could come out on either side
of the web. The diameter of this
opening was such that the spider's
eight legs spanned the gap without
difficulty.
After two and a half hours of steady
work, all was completed; the house
was ready for occupancy. The spider
then took up its position over the
centre opening (about one-half inch;
1.27 cm. in diameter) with legs spread
out upon the radiais. It was now ready
to detect any vibrations that would
indicate that a victim was trapped, and
would also give its location.
The term "engineering masterpiece"
in the title of this article is more
applicable than one might suppose.
The use of three main structural sup¬
porting lines is an engineering tech¬
nique based on the geometrical prop¬

Numerous spiders are found on the
surfaces of ponds and quiet streams,
but the only one that lives all its
life under water is the European
water spider (Argyoneta aquatica).
This ingenious spider builds a rough
framework for its bell-shaped under¬
water home by attaching a few
threads to the stems of water plants.
Then, rising upwards, it collects air
on its abdomen and rear legs by
projecting them through the surface
of the water (above right). Carrying
this air bubble to Its building site,
it places it where the silken cables
will hold ¡t prisoner. The spider
repeats the operation until it has
collected about one cubic centimetre
of air (above left), and then com¬
pletes the nest by weaving a silken
covering around the bubble. To this
home it brings water bugs and other
prey (photo left) and here too it
lays its eggs and raises a family.

determine, or stabilize, a plane. Also,
the triangle is the basic form used in
construction to secure stability and
equilibrium.
The division of the web-weaving
process into four separate steps
closely reflects similar procedures in
the construction of a building:
Laying the foundation.
Placing the structural framework.
Building the scaffolding for en¬
closing the structure.
Preparing the place for occu¬
pancy, and removing the scaffolding.
After construction, the spider will
continue to have engineering prob¬
lems, but now under the heading of
"Repairs and Maintenance".
It was hard not to think in human
terms as well as strictly engineering
terms when contemplating the events
at this place. These questions occur¬
red to me:
Why was it that so many webs
had been constructed at this same
location, the various spiders taking
advantage of the same existing cabin
logs, tree branches, protruding rocks,
etc., to build above the little wild
garden? Are spiders able to stand off
far enough and in some way survey
all the attributes of a possible web
site?
Having selected a site, can the
spider then determine which of several
logs, branches, etc., would be most
suitable for anchorages?
Can a spider, having established
a line from the end of a certain log
to a branch, say six feet distant, then
use some decision-making process
that eliminates several alternate pos¬
sibilities in favour of centering the
web directly above the pathway, where
insect traffic will be heaviest?
These and many other questions are
unanswered, as far as I have been
able to discover. I myself have no
answers but it is my belief, based on
many years of observation, that scores
of spiders, of various species, have
built webs at this site in a manner
that suggests that the answer to these
questions could be "yes".
At least, I can say that the same
structural problems had been faced by
innumerable builders, and all of them
had been solved in the same compe¬
tent manner.
SPINNING LESSONS FOR THE SCIENTIST
The web building spider can be a unique laboratory animal that may help
scientists to investigate many aspects of physiological, behavioral and psychological
research, say three scientists who have made extensive studies of spiders at work
on their webs. Their conclusions are published in a short and easy-to-read little
book, "A Spider's Web, Problems of Regulatory Biology" (1).
Their study reveals many interesting and little-known facets of the spider's habits
and working methods. Spiders produce with amazing speed large amounts of silk
which they daily spin into a web of specific design. The authors discuss the anatomy,
physiology and histology of the silk glands, as well as the composition of the silk
itself.
The web is of utmost importance in the life of the spider, and its design has
presumably evolved through some selective process. The authors point out that
the spider nervous system is programmed to achieve construction of a web through
the spreading of silk. The specific nature of the web enables it to be characterized,
and thus computational methods for describing it in mathematical or geometrical
terms can be drawn up.
The authors suggest that the detailed geometric patterns of webs are important
for proper mating by providing a clear and unambiguous signal for an approaching
male. They also note that spiders are able to catch and process flies on strange
webs as efficiently as on their own.
The scientists studied the many differences that occur in web patterns resulting
from natural processes such as aging, growth and weight changes in spiders, as
well as others induced by "manipulating" spiders through the use of drugs and by
other means, and they describe the effects of drugs on web weaving behaviour.
Since spiders build webs frequently, it is possible to have a spider in "normal"
condition construct a web, then make some alteration to the spider and compare
the resulting web with the normal or standard from the same animal.

QUASARS AND THE BIRTH OF THE UNIVERSE (Continued from page 34)
out and aging rapidly, the date that
they flared up must be related to
the birth of the galaxies The quasars
must be contemporary with the birth
of the galaxies or have followed at
a limited interval of time. They
therefore situate in time the
birth of the galaxies which in
turn denotes a critical state of the
matter of the universe, already con¬
siderably cooled down after the initial
explosion. Thermal turbulence must
already have reduced sufficiently
to allow gravitational forces to
accumulate the vast mass of the
proto-galaxies, that is, the galaxies
in the process of condensation.
From these observations it seems
to follow that the period in which
quasars flared up reached its cul¬
mination eight to nine thousand
million years ago. It is unlikely
that more than nine thousand million
years ago there were many quasars.
We are living in a comparatively
calm period of the development of
the universe, at a time when matter
has long been gathered together in
galaxies or stars. But with our
radiotélescopes we can survey the
past and reach back to an earlier
stage in the life of the universe to
an epoch in which thermal flux and
not the accumulation of matter was
the dominant factor. We are on the
point of having access to the very
dawn of the world at a time when,
perhaps, there were no stars and all
that existed was amorphous matter.
The initial results of this investiga¬
tion are still far from precise. The
given facts of time and distance will
have to be checked and verified. This
will be the task of larger telescopes
that are today planned or under
construction. The results they supply
will enable astronomers and astro¬
physicists to re-constitute the history
of our universe.
The first radiotélescope was built
scarcely a quarter of a century ago
and the first optical telescope three
centuries ago. Man has existed on
earth for a million years and life for
a thousand million years. The sun,
the earth and the planets are six
to seven thousand million years old
and the galaxy of which we are part
goes back eight to nine thousand
million years. The expansion of the
universe, which can still be observed
today, may have begun ten to twelve
thousand million years ago. But the
further back we go into the past
the more uncertain become the events
that marked the prehistory of the
universe.
It is not so long since scientists
began their enquiry into the past of
man and of the earth. To avoid
straying in the labyrinths of specula¬
tion or losing their way in the mists
of space and time, they now have
as guides the quasars, those beacons
whose light and radio signals travel
towards us across thousands of
millions of years.

educational institutions and teachers articles
and information from worldwide sources
42
and to give teachers especially in pri¬
mary schools an insight into educational
problems and their solutions in other coun¬
tries. Annual subscription: $3.50 or 21/-stg.
Subscribers will receive the first six issues
(1969-70) free of charge, and their sub¬
scription will cover Nos 7-11 (1971). Order
from Unesco national distributors (P. 43).
Developing Asia's
book industry
A centre for the promotion of book
publishing in Asia has been set up in Tokyo
(Japan) by the Japanese Publishers' Asso¬
ciation with aid from the Japanese National
Commission for Unesco. It will carry out
research on publishing technology, provide
training courses for the industry and report
new trends in Asian publishing. Unesco is
contributing $36,000 to provide courses for
trainees from 18 countries.
Hazards of food poisoning
The danger of food poisoning is every¬
where increasing, not only from food-borne
diseases but also through chemical contam¬
inants that find their way into food
through mishandling, reports the World
Health Organization. Mass production and
distribution of food and the growth of
international trade and travel all contribute
to the danger.
Dial-a-lesson Classrooms
Teachers in Ottawa, Canada, will be able
to dial-a-lesson under an experimental pro¬
ject in four schools. Each of the schools'
110 classrooms will be connected to a
video library, and teachers will be able to
choose recorded programmes by telephone
to be played back over a coaxial cable
network and received on classroom TV.
IVAN KOTLYAREVSKY
Poet Laureate of the Ukraine
(1769-1838)
This year's bi-centenary of the birth of Ivan Kotlyarevsky,
"Poet Laureate of the Ukraine," was marked by celebrations
throughout the Soviet Union, including special ceremonies
in the Bolshoi Theatre, Moscow, in September.
Ivan Kotlyarevsky was the leading figure in the literary revival of the Ukrainian
cultural renaissance that took place early in the 19th century- He wrote the first
Ukrainian musical drama, "Natalka of Poltava" and his translations of La Fon¬
taine's Fables into Ukrainian and of Greek and Latin literature into Russian are
still widely read. But the work which brought him the greatest fame and established
him as the founder of Ukrainian literature is his poem, "The Aeneid Transposed."
This vigorous, sparklingly witty poem is in no sense a parody of Vergil's master¬
piece. Borrowing only the story outline, Kotlyarevsky produced a brilliant and
original work whose purpose was to challenge Tsarist despotism at a time when
the very survival of the Ukrainian language and culture was at stake. In its verses,
the gods on Olympus, the Trojan, Carthaginian and Latin peoples speak, act, dress,
eat and quarrel like Ukrainians at the close of the 18th century. The author's
style, his humour and philosophical irony have led many to compare him with Rabe¬
lais, Swift, Ariosto and Anatole France.
Kotlyarevsky shook off the shackles of 18th century classicism, raised a verna¬
cular language to the rank of a literary one and introduced Ukrainian literature into
Russia's cultural life. His "Aeneid" is so rich in Ukrainian folk wisdom and turns
of speech that few have attempted to translate it, although it well deserves to be
read In every country.

Ocean exploration decade
A long-term and expanded programme of
oceanic research, which would comprehend
the proposed International Decade of
Ocean Exploration, was recently adopted
by the Intergovernmental Océanographie
Commission meeting at Unesco headquar¬
ters in Paris. It comprises some 50 projects
covering the whole spectrum of oceano¬
graphy from the study of the earth's crust
under the ocean basins and research on
the ocean as the "boiler" for the world's
weather system to ways of doubling or
even quadrupling the present annual salt¬
water fish catch of nearly 60 million tons.
Flashes...
Seventy per cent of Soviet doctors are
women, whose numbers reached 438,000
last year compared with 96,000 in 1940.
Traffic congestion in Great Britain, which
has nearly 60 vehicles for every mile of
road, is increasing more rapidly than in
any other major country, according to the
British Road Federation.
By 1975 the world's nuclear power sta¬
tions are likely to number 300 with a total
generating capacity of 150,000 megawatts
as against 20,000 today.
One out of every seven persons in the
world is a citizen of India. India's popu¬
lation (over 520 million last year) grows
annually by 13 million.

WEB OF PEARLS
Since Antiquity, man has marvelled at the geometrical precision with which
a spider spins its web. On page 35, a structural engineer of today describes with
professional admiration the detailed, step-by-step construction of an
engineering masterpiece the web he observed a spider spinning in his garden.
