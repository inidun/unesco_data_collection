Twenty-seven new sites have been 
inscribed on UNESCO’s World Heritage 
List, in Quebec (Canada). While no 
changes were made to the List of Heritage 
in Danger, “reinforced monitoring” 
was requested for four sites: Bordeaux, 
(France),Timbuktu (Mali), Historic 
Sanctuary of Machu Picchu (Peru), 
Samarkand (Uzbekistan). 
Under the new mechanism, first 
introduced in 2007, the Committee 
will be kept informed of developments 
affecting the preservation of these sites 
on a regular basis with a view to deciding 
on their future status on the World 
Heritage List.   
A permAnent chAllenge
Over the past biennium, the World Heritage Com-
mittee examined almost 300 State of Conservation 
reports, the highest number ever examined by the 
Committee. Nine properties were removed from the 
List of World Heritage in Danger, in recognition of 
the improvement in their state of conservation, while 
5 additional sites were added. By flagging them on 
this special list, the Committee hopes to drawn par-
ticular attention to their plight.
Tip of the iceberg
But the In Danger List is only the tip of the iceberg. 
Most of the 878 World Heritage Sites face  conservation 
The 1972 Convention concerning the Protection of 
the World Cultural and Natural Heritage is perhaps 
the most widely recognized and effective conserva-
tion instrument in the world. One of its main pur-
poses is to ensure “the identification, protection, 
conservation, presentation and transmission to future 
generations of the cultural and natural heritage”. 
Inscription is thus not an end in itself but only the 
beginning. 
The World Heritage Committee provides leadership 
in promoting systems to support the sustainability of 
heritage sites. There are processes to identify threats 
to World Heritage properties, including periodic 
reporting, reactive monitoring and, in cases of severe 
threat, In Danger listing.

The first major case discussed by the Committee 
was the proposed Mitte Wein project in the Historic 
Centre of Vienna, which in 2003 sparked an ongoing 
debate. The most recent example is the proposed 
Gazprom Tower development in St. Petersburg, by the 
major Russian natural gas company. During its meet-
ing in Quebec, the Committee asked Russia to invite 
an expert mission from the World Heritage Centre 
and the International Council on Monuments and 
Sites (ICOMOS) to evaluate the tower’s impact, and 
to postpone action until results of the analysis are 
available. 
Infrastructure projects like dams, canals, roads 
and bridges are often highlighted in the state of 
conservation reports on specific World Heritage 
Sites. In the case of the Group of Monuments at 
Hampi, India, a proposed bridge that threatened the 
site’s values was re-routed away from the property, 
leading to the removal of the site from the In Danger 
List in 2006. Another situation yet to be resolved 
involves a proposed bridge at the Dresden Elbe Valley. 
In 2006, the Committee took the position that the 
bridge would “irreversibly damage the values and 
integrity of the property”. This year, it regretted the 
construction of the bridge underway and urged

the authorities to opt for a tunnel. If the bridge con-
struction is not stopped and damage reversed, the 
Committee decided, the property will be deleted from 
the World Heritage List in 2009. 
The threat of uncontrolled tourism is one that 
occurs frequently at World Heritage Sites. There are 
travel companies that create tour packages around 
UNESCO sites, using the label ‘UNESCO World Herit-
age Site’ as a tourism marketing brand. At Angkor in 
Cambodia, there are reportedly 5000 visitors a day. 
In the Galapagos Islands, tourism has increased from 
40,000 visitors in 1991 to 120,000 in 2006. The prob-
lems related to tourism include threats to public 
security and the heritage resources as well as to the 
quality of the visitor experience. The World Heritage 
Committee works on developing principles for respon-
sible tourism that apply to the stewards and custodi-
ans, to tour companies, to the people who write 
guidebooks as well as to tourists. 
Over time, the Committee has dealt with cases of 
mining, logging, gas and oil extraction as well as the 
poaching of animals for commercial purposes. And 
the Committee can claim some spectacular successes, 
such as the re-routing of the mining road around 
Huascaran National Park (Peru) and the re-alignment 
of a proposed oil pipeline outside the watershed of 
Lake Baikal (Russia). A singular achievement for 
UNESCO is the 2003 undertaking by the International 
Council on Mining and Metals not to explore or mine 
in World Heritage Sites, recognizing them as “no-go” 
areas.
An important advance:  
reinforced monitoring mechanism
Among the less manageable threats are natural dis-
asters, including extreme weather events, fires and 
floods often related to the broader issue of climate 
change. In collaboration with international institu-
tions and committees, the World Heritage Committee 
has developed its own policy framework and opera-
tional plan for monitoring and addressing the impacts 
of climate change on World Heritage properties. (See 
“Case Studies on Climate Change and World  Heritage”, 
a 2007 UNESCO report) 
Another issue that is beyond the control of the 
Committee is the threat to sites from civil unrest and 
armed conflict. As an example, particular concern for 
the deteriorating condition of the properties in the 
Democratic Republic of Congo (DRC) led the Commit-
tee last year to decide on a comprehensive approach 
for all five In Danger sites. 
The Committee has also recently adopted a “rein-
forced monitoring mechanism” for properties 
inscribed on the World Heritage List in Danger, apply-
ing it to the five sites in DRC, as well as Dresden and 
Jerusalem. This mechanism can be activated either 
by the World Heritage Committee or by the Director-
General of UNESCO in specific and exceptional cases. 
At its 32nd session in Quebec, decisions were taken 
to apply it to Timbuktu (Mali), Machu Picchu (Peru), 
Samarkand (Uzbekistan) and Bordeaux (France),

which are not on the In Danger list. The case of the 
five DRC sites was again closely examined. 
For the first time in the history of the Conven-
tion, the World Heritage Committee in 2007 decided, 
with deep regret, to remove a property, the Arabian 
Oryx Sanctuary in Oman, from the World Heritage 
List. The Committee judged that the property had 
deteriorated to the extent that it had lost its Out-
standing Universal Value. This dramatic moment of 
the Convention reminds us all that protection of 
World Heritage is a shared responsibility. It is the 
obligation of States Parties to protect the World cul-
tural and natural heritage situated on their territory; 
4
it is the duty of the international community as a 
whole to assist and to cooperate with States Parties 
in this endeavour. 
At the 32nd session in Quebec, Canada made a 
special effort to engage young people in the work of 
the World Heritage Committee. The long-term con-
servation of our World Heritage Sites depends on the 
will of future generations to take over stewardship 
responsibilities. Engaging today’s youth will shape 
the decision-makers of tomorrow.

Chairperson of the 32nd World Heritage Committee  
Morning – if there is a morning – of deceptive 
light because morning is forbidden to those most 
dislocated beings: promised to a cruel fate 
according to the holy will of the privileged… 
Oppression, permanent through definite absence 
of good and wellbeing for those women and men 
struck by who knows what unexplained and 
equally inexplicable curse… 
Reverie, never dreamed, of freedom to say simple 
words like I am like you, with you, I am you and 
to make gestures not always the gestures of gen-
uflection and prostration… 
Never cry with joy, never! But burn ceaselessly 
burn with the fire of bitter tears because nothing 
– day or night – sings or enchants… 
End by giving up on life rather than enduring: that is 
what the word Morne can inspire in the horrible 
vocabulary of forbidden places and doomed 
desires…

Le Morne was a place of refuge for runaway slaves.
le morne, spelled out
Morning, Oppression, Reverie… with these words Mauritian poet Édouard J. Maunick begins 
to write “Le Morne”, a name charged with emotion, a mountain laden with memory, a sacred 
place in the history of the maroon - runaway slaves - of Mauritius, and now a World Heritage 
site.
Only light can vanquish all the night of the fate 
imposed on the disinherited. Thus Le Morne instead 
of source of solitude forms an island extension, a 
front garden instead of a place of torture from which 
the victim, drunk with despair, leaps into the void to 
die somewhere on the murderous slope. From which

too the fake dive into the ocean (a fable), an impos-
sible take-off for the most able of athletes and even 
less proper to those half-dead three-quarters 
exhausted by hunger, thirst and pain… From which 
in particular the light, now returned into time, incar-
nated in the house of the Morne. 
Order and counter order of time’s tragic isolation, 
clarity taking the guise of the commonplace, the pla-
teau of the Morne assuming the value of heritage. 
History gets involved, all the better: no longer is it a 
question of a geographic hill but a place telling its 
truth, albeit so tragic. The narrative is worth a stop. 
Le Morne is no longer solitude but symbol of 
liberation. 
Reverie finally touching reality, the Morne Brabant 
like the doleful on other islands rejoins the world in 
its integrity. No longer a corner of an island however 
picturesque, but part of humanity that not naming 
would be a fault if not a sin. 
None can contradict the whole world. Obliterating Le 
Morne Brabant of Mauritius is like forgetting the 
work of Mahatma Gandhi, the struggle of Martin 
Luther King Jr., the epic of Nelson Mandela, to cite 
only these few examples. The misadventure lived by 
Le Morne’s two thousand slaves is as present in 
memory as any other closer to us. 
Ending, the inclusion of the Morne Brabant on the 
World Heritage List is like the image of the trochetia, 
the native flower of Mauritius, ennobling the whole 
island. 
Édouard J. Maunick, Mauritian poet.

le morne, in other words
The mountain 
The Morne Brabant is situated in the south-west of Mauritius on an isthmus that juts out into the Indian 
Ocean. The mountain is covered in high brush and forests sheltering a volcano with a summit at 556 m, sur-
rounded with hills and lagoons. The summit of the Morne is a small plateau watered by a permanent source. 
The symbol 
In the time of slavery, Le Morne was a place of refuge for fugitive slaves known as “maroons”. Today it has 
become a symbol of resistance to oppression and the struggle for liberty. 
Slavery 
In the 17th century and until abolition in 1835, the island of Mauritius was a hub of the slave trade, at the 
crossroads of Africa, the Indies and the Americas. 
The slaves came from Madagascar, Mozambique, Guinea, West Africa, the Canary Islands, as well as Bengal, 
Malabar and Timor. 
Between 1767 and 1797, the number of slaves tripled, 
reaching 49,000. Slaves made up about 80% of the 
population of Mauritius. 
Maroons 
Maroons were slaves who ran away from their owners 
and lived in hiding in the mountain and its surround-
ings. Numerous maroons found refuge in the Morne’s 
dense forests, isolated and inaccessible. Some only 
survived in freedom for a few weeks. Others suc-
ceeded in founding small communities on the moun-
tain and in its hidden caves. 
Around 1770, nearly 5% of the slave population was 
maroon. The number had risen to 13% by 1820. 
It is said… 
To reach the Morne’s summit, you have to get across a crevasse several hundred meters deep. It is said slaves 
crossed over at its narrowest point, 1.60 m wide, on a wooden plank. 
It is also said that rather than be recaptured by their owners, maroons chose suicide by leaping into the 
void. 
Historical markers 
Mauritius is situated 800 km east of Madagascar and 220 km east of Reunion Island. It was a Dutch colony 
first (1598- 1710), then French (1715-1810) and finally British (1810-1968). Mauritius became an independ-
ent state in 1968.

Following the 1616 fire, the city’s first parish 
church, La Parroquial, was rebuilt. It was moved from 
its original site facing the city council to a side of 
Arms Square. From then on, urban geography adopted 
the church as its core and the square as its centre. It 
was around the latter, renamed Agramante Park, that 
the most important government buildings were 
erected.
The city with  
the earthenware jars
Residential buildings definitely take up the most 
space within the central historical heritage, which is 
for sure the largest in Cuba. We must remember that 
in 1800, at the start of the 19th century, the Royal 
Justice Palace of Santo Domingo Island was trans-
ferred to Camagüey, when the former Spanish colony 
became French under the Treaty of Basel. As a result 
prominent families came to live in the city, giving 
impetus to majestic architecture with its own par-
ticularities, consisting mainly of what we call today 
As my friend the Cuban poet Roberto Méndez, a 
native of Camagüey, tells it, the indigenous chief 
Camagüebax welcomed the Spaniards with open arms 
when they arrived in 1514 in what they would call 
Villa Santa María del Puerto Príncipe. The chief gave 
them a ribbon of land stretched between the Tinima 
and Hatibonico rivers so they could settle. They, in 
exchange, murdered him and threw him off a moun-
taintop. Legend has it the land all around immedi-
ately turned red. 
That said, the capital of Cuba’s most extensive 
province, also called Camagüey, had to be re-founded 
several times in diverse circumstances down through 
history. First the indigenous people rose up against 
the conquistadores, then pirates attacked and finally 
in 1616 a dreadful fire reduced all the ecclesiastical 
archives to ashes. Difficult, then, to piece together 
the history of the city, which in the past was charac-
terized by narrow and sinuous street like a medieval 
town, in flagrant contrast to the rectangular shape 
of its main square today.

neoclassical houses, which still bear the names of 
their owners in olden times. 
These large palaces, built in the second half of 
the 19th century, conform to the fashion of the era 
that favoured neoclassical style and had as anteced-
ents the vast two-storey houses of the previous cen-
tury. We can therefore affirm that starting in 1850 
architecture took on a new esthetic. The most elo-
quent example is the Socarrás building, designed in 
1862 by the Spanish architect Dionisio de la Iglesia, 
whose influence is evident on all subsequent 
 buildings. Everywhere we find the rhetorical alterna-
tion of pilasters and bay windows as well as balco-
nies defined by wrought-iron balustrades. 
In 1841, Camagüey comprised 125 streets com-
posed of 1033 blocks of houses, and already standing 
since the 18th century were buildings like the con-
vent and hospital of San Juan de Dios, the churches 
of La Merced and La Soledad, the Jesuit college and 
the women’s hospital, all imposing constructions 
typical of the century’s architecture. 
But if there is one thing that gives personality to 
this city the Cubans call “Legendary”, it is the enor-
mous earthenware jars, like those in Andalusia, 
placed on the patios of houses and in gardens and 
parks which fill with rainwater and are intended to 
keep epidemics from spreading. They started making 
them in 1620, at the same time as the bricks and 
tiles used in the construction of all the city’s 
buildings. 
Camagüey is also scattered with an impressive 
number of churches, which earned it the nickname 
“city of temples”. All of them share the same feature, 
a single tower. The architectonic complex that 
includes the Iglesia de Nuestra Señora del Carmen, 
the Ursuline convent and the women’s hospital is the 
most typical example.
If the cart had not got stuck  
in the mud…
But the church that goes farthest back in time is the 
old Ermita de Nuestra Señora de la Soledad, haunted 
by a legend. The story goes that at the beginning of 
the 17th century, a cart drawn by oxen came to a 
halt at the future site of the church, stuck in the 
mud. The load was removed to lighten the cart and a 
mysterious bundle fell to the ground, containing the 
image of Our Lady of La Soledad. Brother José de la 
Cruz Espí, known as Father Valencia, recognized this 
as a sign and had the church built, along with a 
number of other Christian houses of worship. 
It was in Camagüey, furthermore, that what is 
considered Cuba’s first literary work, El Espejo de 
Paciencia, the Mirror of Patience, materialized, writ-
ten by the public writer from the Canary Islands 
Nicolás Guillén, the island’s national poet. 
In the general cemetery is preserved the epitaph 
that poet and barber Agustín de Moya is believed to 
have written in memory of his beloved and inacces-
sible Dolores Rondón. According to Méndez, Dolores, 
the illegitimate daughter of a Catalan merchant, 
chose out of self-interest to accept the advances of a 
Spanish officer instead of the love-struck Moya’s. In 
1863, the barber found her in the women’s hospital, 
disfigured and dying of the pox. Above the common 
grave where she was buried, an epitaph appeared on 
a piece of wood. Anonymous hands renewed the 
inscription as the years passed, until finally in the 
19th century the mayor, Pedro García Argenot, 
decided to build a tomb in the central part of the 
cemetery. 
The epitaph on it reads:

three Armenian jewels in Iran
The northwest provinces in Iran have sheltered a number of Armenian churches for several 
centuries. As time went by, cultural interpenetration left there an astonishing mixture of 
symbols within the typically Armenian 
architecture. Three monastic ensembles in 
this region were inscribed this year on the 
World Heritage List.
The place, according to legend, of the apostle Thad-
deus’s martyrdom in the first century A.D., the mon-
astery of Saint Thaddeus of Artaz (Artazi Sourb T’adei 
vank’) every summer brings together thousands of 
pilgrims. It is enthroned, majestic and solitary, in 
the lunar landscape of the Maku valley, on a promon-
tory at an altitude of 2,200 metres, where Saint Gre-
gory, father of the Armenian church, founded a place 
of worship in the 4th century. So much for legend. 4

The two churches of Saint Thaddeus monastery.
Saint thaddeus of Artaz
First mentioned in records in the 12th century, the Saint Thaddeus monastery was 
destroyed in 1319 by an earthquake. The present condition of the monuments is the result 
of two restoration and construction campaigns in the 17th and 19th centuries. The mon-
astery is composed of two adjoining churches, a porch and monastic buildings aligned 
along the vast quadrilateral inner courtyard with towers. The enclosure is prolonged to 
the west by a large courtyard for the use of pilgrims and visitors, while several chapels are 
set on surrounding hills. 
Undated, but typical of the Armenian Middle Ages, the western church, referred to as “Black”, was proba-
bly built in 1329. It has lost its western arm, destroyed when the main church was built. A large prominent 
cross within the dome and a cross vault in the apse essentially make up its interior decoration, the sobriety 
of which stands out against the opulence of its exterior ornaments. Creating a lively contrast with the dark 
grey basalt covering the facades, blocks of pale beige limestone cover the cupola and the roof. They are also 
arranged in horizontal strips on the drum (cylinder on which the cupola rests) and form large ornamental

As for history, it tells us that Saint Thaddeus was 
the seat of the Armenian diocese in the 10th cen-
tury; it endured the Mongol invasions in the 13th 
century; in the following century, it was held by the 
Unitors, who wanted to unite the Armenian and 
Roman churches; it was pillaged by the Persian Qadjar 
dynasty at the end of the 1700s and became a centre 
of resistance against the Ottomans at the dawn of 
the 20th century. 
This major site of the Armenian church has just 
been inscribed, along with Saint Stepanos and Dzord-
zor, on the World Heritage List. It constitutes a 
remarkable artefact of Armenian culture in the 
region, which was one of the most prosperous and 
coveted in this part of the world, as well as one of 
the most fertile in cultural exchange. 
That explains the astonishing mixture of styles in 
the two churches of Saint Thaddeus monastery: the 
medieval “Black Church”, from which the little 
 neighbouring village got its name, Quara-Kelisa 
(“black church” in Turkish), and the “White Church”, 
built in the 19th century on the model of Echmiatsin 
(a World Heritage site since 2000), close to Arme-
nia’s capital Yerevan.
With their pyramidal domes on polygonal drums, 
arches, niches and sculpted decorations in horizontal 
bands, these two central-domed cross-hall churches 
are emblematic of Armenian architecture, of which 
St Stepanos of Darresham (Dara chambi Sourb Ste-
pannos Nakhavka), main church of the second monas-
tic ensemble to be inscribed as world heritage, 
provides another eloquent illustration. 
An impressive building in a spectacular landscape 
– the description briefly sums up this site, located 
east of Saint Thaddeus, in the gorges of the river 
Araxe. Reaching its apogee in the 14th century, the 
monastery today shares the vestiges of its former 
glory with Yerevan and Venice, where a portion of 
compositions on the facades. Typical of the 17th cen-
tury, the decoration is probably the result of recon-
struction carried out between 1680 and 1685. 
Distinctly larger, the main “white” church was 
built between 1810 and 1830 in pale beige limestone. 
It is bathed in light, thanks to the 12 windows cut 
into the drum of its dome. Its distinctive character-
istics are its floor plan inspired by Echmiatsin (near 
Yerevan, Armenian capital) and its elaborate decora-
tively sculpted exterior, the prototype of which is 
Aghtamar’s Holy Cross church on Lake Van in Turkey. 
The iconography of its relief sculptures testifies to 
an astonishing diversity of cultural influences. The 
first register, comprised of flat niches, harbours 
saintly knights, crosses, stylized cypresses in the Turkish and Iranian style, but also the Iranian emblem of a 
rising sun and a lion. Above the niches runs a double frieze of foliated scrolls emerging from vases, a motif 
of Western origin found frequently not only in Armenia but also Turkey and Iran in the late Middle Ages. The 
foliage in the upper row surrounds a multitude of scenes of hunting and rural life, battles, images of real and 
imaginary animals, as well as scenes from Iranian poetry and mythology. In the upper register can be identi-
fied portraits, based for the most part on Western models, of Moses, King David, the Virgin Mary, John the 
Baptist, Saint Gregory the Enlightener and the archbishop Simeon carrying the model of the church. 
Restoration work was undertaken with UNESCO’s support in 1972 and 1973, following an earthquake in 
1940 that seriously damaged the buildings. The work continued regularly until 2001, when an overall conser-
vation programme was established.

the iconography and literature produced behind its 
walls is now housed. 
Its hardest times came in the 11th and 12th cen-
turies, during the wars between Byzantium and the 
Seldjukids, and in the 13th and 14th centuries under 
Mongol domination, and 300 years later, when Shah 
Abbas decided to “clear” the border area, causing the 
displacement of hundreds of thousands of Armenians 
towards central Iran. 
The monastery suffered by human hand but also 
because of nature. It had to be rebuilt several times. 
It was destroyed, as was Saint Thaddeus, by the 1319 
earthquake, and, along with all buildings from

St Stepanos of Darresham
The Monastery of St Stepanos (Stephen) exists in 10th cen-
tury records, but the present constructions date from the 17th 
and 19th centuries. The main church was built between 1643 
and 1655, commissioned by the bishop Hakob of Djulfa, future 
Patriarch. It is one of the most eloquent illustrations of the 
17th century Armenian architectural renaissance, period in 
which it was rebuilt.
Its boundaries marked by a quadrilateral enclosure with round towers, 
the complex comprises two courtyards. The raised southern courtyard is 
surrounded by monastic buildings, while the northern courtyard encloses 
the main church, flanked with a chapel-arcade and a bell tower. The build-
ings are covered in slabs of ochre and brown limestone in checkerboard 
pattern. 
Twenty-five metres high, the church conforms to a design that is old-
fashioned for its time: a tetraconch or triple apse in the form of a clover 
within a rectangle. The apse is flanked by two large two-story chapels. The 
western side contains a tribune, a structure rarely found in Armenian architecture. The slightly curved form 
of the arches, the alveoles in the vaults of niches and the plant motifs that appear around cherubs on the 
frescoes painted in 1826 are the fruit of Iranian influence. 
Outside, the facades carry sculpted representations of the Virgin and Child, the Crucifixion, the Annuncia-
tion, the Resurrection and the stoning of St Stephen. But they are also interspersed with a Seljukid chain

ancient Armenia with its extremely harsh weather, it 
is very vulnerable to climate variations. The alluvial 
ground represents another constant threat to the St 
Stepanos (Stephen) Monastery. But constant conser-
vation work prolongs its existence.
A management plan for the three monastic ensem-
bles was established in 2001, following up the con-
servation that began in the 1970s. 
Twenty years ago, the little Holy-Mother-of-God 
chapel (Sourb Astvatzatzin), the only remnant of the 
famous Dzordzor monastery, demolished at the time 
of Shah Abbas in the early 17th century, was saved 
from certain death. Left alone for 300 years in the 
valley of the Makuchay river, it was fated to disap-
pear too when the Iranian government decided to 
build a dam. But it was dismantled and rebuilt 600 
metres away, with the support of the Armenian 
church. All the chapel’s stones were numbered and 4

Built out of carefully carved limestone 
blocks, with a dome above a cross that is 
slightly elongated from west to east, typi-
cal of Armenian architecture, the Dzordzor 
chapel’s lively silhouette is striking. Topped 
by a cupola resting on a 16-sided drum, it 
features a series of layers of stones that are 
lower and darker than the others, giving its 
facades an unusual rhythm. On the whole, 
however, its exterior decoration is quite 
austere. On its western façade it is limited 
to a strip of moulding that surrounds the 
door and forms a broken arch above the 
tympanum. 
In danger of vanishing underwater due to the con-
struction of a dam, the chapel was moved a distance 
of 600 metres upstream in 1987-1988. A restoration, notably of the umbrella dome, was undertaken at the 
same time. 
Undated, the Dzordzor chapel has been attributed by some specialists to the 9th or 10th century, and by 
others to the 14th century, high point in the history of the monastery of which it is the only vestige.

With its umbrella-shaped dome, it stands like an 
elegant and solitary princess in the semi-desert land-
scape. This picturesque cupola remains a key element 
of Armenian architecture from the 10th century until 
now. Set on a drum, which allows the inside of the 
church to be lit almost entirely from above, it sur-
mounts the vaulted ceiling, symbol of the heavens 
and the aspiration for salvation. Placed in the centre 
of the church, the cupola crowns the juncture of the 
four arms of the cross, representing the assembly of 
believers, the church of humanity on earth.

In Papua New Guinea, the Kuk Swamp agricultural 
community is well-organized, and despite what 
people think, that’s not new! The traditional land-
owners of the area, the Kawelka, have been cultivat-
ing sweet potatoes, bananas and coffee across the 
area most recently since the 1990s, but they inhab-
ited the area during various periods of the twentieth 
century and before. 
The Kawelka say they told stories to anthropolo-
gists who took them away, whereas archaeologists 
told them stories that they didn’t know. Among these 
stories is the fact that 7,000 to 10,000 years ago, 
Kuk was a centre of early independent agricultural 
development. It was a place where people undertook 
a transition from pre-existing foraging practices to 
agriculture.
A world cradle of agriculture
Against all odds, Kuk Swamp proves 
that agriculture started in Papua New 
Guinea 10,000 years ago. Kuk Swamp, a 
new World Heritage site, holds treasured 
remains of early agriculture and drainage. 
By cultivating the land, the Kawelka 
people preserve their heritage.

In Papua New Guinea, humans began mastering agriculture 
10,000 years ago.
The taming of the banana
For many people including archaeologists, the moun-
tains of Papua New Guinea seem an unlikely place to 
find evidence of early independent agricultural devel-
opment. But archaeological excavations in the 1960s 
and investigations carried out by Jack Golson [a now 
retired Australian archaeologist who passed on the 
torch to Tim Denham,] have proven otherwise. 
Archaeological remains such as cultivated sur-
faces, raised beds and ditches of ancient cultivation 
have been found buried in Kuk Swamp, located 1,550 
metres above sea level in the Upper Wahgi Valley, 
which is one of the largest valleys in the mountain-
ous spine that runs east-west across the centre of 
the island of New Guinea. Such archaeological

 findings are exceptional because the transition from 
foraging practices to early independent agriculture 
occurred in very few places in the world. Thus, each 
of them including Kuk is of global significance for 
understanding one of the greatest technological 
developments of modern humans. 
Different types of agriculture based on certain 
crops and cultivation methods emerged independ-
ently in Southwest Asia, Southeast China, the Ameri-
cas, potentially Africa, and New Guinea. In Southwest 
Asia and Southeast China, early agriculture was seed-
based on cereals, legumes and other plants. 
By contrast, early New Guinean agriculture, as it 
is still practiced on the island today, was based 
exclusively on the propagation of a range of food 
and economic plants including fruit and nut-bearing 
trees, root crops like yams and taro, sugarcane, herbs, 
leafy vegetables and bananas. Recent studies sug-
gest most of these plants, especially the banana, 
were first domesticated in the New Guinea region. 
Some seed-based planting also occurred, but cultiva-
tion consisted mainly of vegetative reproduction uti-
lizing tubers, corms, suckers, stems and cuttings.
Cultivating the soil  
to protect the site
Ten thousand years ago, people were clearing patches 
within the rainforest and modifying the wetland 
environment at Kuk, whose landscape probably looked 
like a mosaic of forest, grassland patches and  habitats 
disturbed by human activities. A few pits dug into 
the wetland edge and stone tools embedded with 
microscopic residues of tubers of taro and yam sug-
gest the population had already started to focus on 
starch-rich plants. 
Three thousand years later, the inhabitants really 
started developing the area. They grew plants on 
mounds, a type of raised bed, along the wetland 
margin: the underground bases of these preserved 
beds are still discernible in the mud. They cultivated 
water-tolerant plants like taro at the base of the 
mounds, and water-intolerant plants such as bananas 
and yams on the top. It also seems that these starch-
rich staples were inter-cropped with leafy 
vegetables. 
Similar forms of multi-cropped cultivation have 
occurred on adjacent slopes of the Kuk Swamp area. 
The rainforest of the Upper Wahgi valley was com-
pletely cleared because of horticulture activities and 
burning. Most of the valley has remained a grassland 
since then. 
A drainage system of articulated ditch networks 
was implemented 4,000 years ago to enable cultiva-
tion. The Swamp contains the oldest, best-preserved 
and most extensive cultivation remains in New 
Guinea, which consist of traces in different types of 
mud made of old soils and former drainage feature 
fillings. The extent and patterns of ditch networks 
have varied through time. Although the reasons for

periodic drainage and abandonment of the wetland 
are unknown, it could be related to climatic, hydro-
logical or social factors. 
Today, several hundred Kawelka live on and culti-
vate Kuk Swamp and its surroundings. Despite oral 
traditions that intimately relate the community to 
the land, the Kawelka are not sure whether their con-
nection to Kuk extends back over millennia. But it 
doesn’t matter. 
They have voluntarily committed themselves to 
protect the buried archaeological remains, which 
includes leaving certain areas free of cultivation and 
regulating development in other areas. To the 
Kawelka, heritage is something they are directly con-
nected to through their land and history. Thus, the 
protection of Kuk is achieved by allowing the Kawelka 
to continue to occupy and cultivate the site.

The first time Sveinn Jakobsson set foot on Surtsey 
island, the western crater Surtungur was spitting 
lava into a big glowing red lake flowing to the sea. It 
was June 1964. The newborn island had been spew-
ing volcanic ashes, smoke and steam at the sky for 
the past seven months. The eastern crater Surtur had 
just fallen asleep when its twin Surtungur started 
erupting. “It was fantastic,” said Jakobsson, an Ice-
landic geologist who has been monitoring Surtsey 
for 40 years. “I was only a student. It was my first 
eruption… It was breathtaking.” 
Surtsey emerged from the ocean floor in Novem-
ber 1963. Within four years, the little drop of smoky 
land located 32 km south of Iceland reached the size 
of 2.65 km2, its peak culminating 175m above sea 
level. 
Surtsey is one of 18 islands and skerries of the 
Icelandic Vestmannaeyjar archipelago (the Westman 
Surtsey Island: a 
life-size laboratory
The island of Surtsey (Iceland), recently 
added to the World Heritage List, has 
been a unique opportunity for scientists 
to monitor evolution since the day it 
emerged from the sea in 1963. The once 
barren volcanic island preserved from 
human interference is now crowding with 
plants, insects and birds.
islands), a young volcanic system whose activity 
started about 100,000 years ago. It is the youngest 
and second largest island after Heimaey (13.6km2), 
the only one of the archipelago to be inhabited. 
Marine erosion has made Surtsey shrink to half its 
original size. But, contrary to its two tiny neighbours 
Syrtlingur and Jolnir that survived only six months, 
the 45-year-old island won’t be washed away before 
long. 
The key to Surtsey’s longer life expectancy is its 
hydrothermal anomaly: when the ocean, heated up 
by lava extrusions, penetrates the porous tephra 
made of volcanic ashes and rock fragments, the 
steam makes the loose tephra consolidate into pal-
agonite tuff. Palagonite tuff, which consists mainly 
of basaltic glass, is much more solid than tephra and 
does not erode easily, Jakobsson said. That’s why the

palagonite tuff core of Surtsey of approximately 
400 m2, about the size of a basketball court, will 
probably remain intact for a few thousand years.
A paradise for scientists
A Nature Reserve since 1965, Surtsey is well pre-
served because human presence and activities have 
been minimal. Nobody is allowed to set foot on Surt-
sey except six to ten scientists who monitor the 
island for one or two weeks every year. Human facili-
ties are limited to a field hut, a helicopter pad and a 
lighthouse. The scientists must be careful not to 
bring soil, organisms and pollutants to the island or 
leave any waste. Besides, there is no heavy industry 
or environmentally hazardous activity within a 50-km 
radius of the island. 
Surtsey is the only volcanic island in the world 
that has been so carefully studied since the first day 
of its emergence. “It is still the best described erup-
tion of this kind,” Jakobsson said. The fast coloniza-
tion of species, which has been carefully monitored, 
shows the island is becoming similar to the rest of 
the Vestmannaeyjar archipelago. “In the old days 
there was a handful of species, we could mark them 
and see how the seeds would spread,” said the Ice-
landic plant ecologist Borgthór Magnússon. But they 
have spread so fast that Magnússon now keeps track 
of them on permanent study plots on the island. 
Shortly after Surtsey emerged from the sea, algae 
and organic material drifted ashore feeding microor-
ganisms like bacteria and fungi. Meanwhile, the wind 
and the ocean carried the first seeds onto the shore. 
Shore plants like sea sandwort, lyme grass and oyster 
plants progressively spread on the sand and tephra 
substrate. In 1970 the first sea birds, the Northern 
fulmar and black guillemot, started breeding on the 
cliffs of Surtsey. 
Four years later, the first sea gulls nested on the 
island. “The gulls had a very strong effect on the 
development of the island,” Magnússon said. They 
started pulling out native plants to build their nests 
in the developing dunes, which enhanced plant devel-
opment. Then, they were the first birds to breed upon 
the sands and ashes of Surtsey. They also carried 
seeds of new plant species to the island and  fertilized 
the soil with their excrements. The first land bird, a 
snow bunting that feeds on insects, was seen in 
1996. “We are always excited to see if we have a new 
species. It’s like we’ve found a treasure,” Magnússon 
said. 
Surtsey is a migrating crossroads between Europe, 
Iceland, and the Canadian Arctic. That’s why two 
migratory bird species, the meadow pipit and white 
wagtail, often stop by, while two rare species, the 
European Squacco heron and the North American 
northern oriole, have been sighted a few times. On 
the whole, 12 species and more than 1,200 birds 
breed on Surtsey.
A puffin island
Besides its vibrant bird life, 335 invertebrate species 
including flies, butterflies, spiders and molluscs have 
been found on Surtsey. Seals come breed and pup on 
the shore, while Minke whales, killer whales, harbour 
porpoise and dolphins have been seen along the 
coast. On the other hand, four plant species out of 
69 haven’t survived. 
A new, white mineral found in 1991 may be named 
“Surtseyite,” Jakobsson said. In the craters scattered 
by colourful encrustations, and the lava caves that 
show impressive stalactites, 18 mineral species have 
been identified. 
Despite the proliferation of species in just half a 
century, Magnússon predicts Surtsey will be a puffin 4

bird with a bright orange beak and a black frock coat, 
likes to breed and nest. “It is likely to become the 
biggest bird population of Surtsey and breed there in 
far greater numbers as time passes,” Magnússon 
said. 
Now Surtsey is a World Heritage site, the Surtsey 
Research Society hopes to “create interest in pro-
tecting Surtsey and do more research,” said its chair-
man Steingrímur Hermannsson. The gatekeeper of the 
island may also hope to bring back the international 
scientists and funds that were involved in the early 
days of Surtsey. 
Surtsey, whose name come from Surtur, the god of 
fire in the Icelandic mythology, has just started to 
fire our interest.

were deposited by flooding rivers, during the latter 
geological Carboniferous period. 
The twenty to thirty metre high cliffs are made of 
numerous sloping layers of Carboniferous sedimen-
tary rocks. They are covered by a ten to twelve metre 
thick horizontal deposit of Till or “Boulder Clay,” left 
about thirteen thousand years ago during the melt-
ing of the thick sheet of ice that blanketed the area 
during the last Ice Age. 
The cliffs are exposed on the shore of the 
Chignecto Bay near the head of the Bay of Fundy, to 
the North East and South West of the small town of 
Joggins. The late Carboniferous strata slope down to 
the south at about twenty degrees from the horizon-
tal. In places, the originally horizontal sediment 
layers are cut by river channels that migrated to dif-
ferent positions while meandering over their flood-
plains. Later flooding deposited new sediment layers 
in the channels. 
The Carboniferous sedimentary rocks and their 
contained fossils are all of non-marine, terrestrial 
origin, and provide many clues regarding the late 
Carboniferous environment and climate. All the clues 
indicate the sedimentation took place under a tropi-
cal climate, on a portion of the crust located in the 
Tropics near the Earth’s equator. 
Since then, ocean-floor spreading (Continental 
Drift) has made this part of the crust move north-
wards to its present position, about half- way 
between the Equator and the North Pole.
Giant millipedes…
Perhaps the most remarkable animal that existed in 
the jungle-like forests of Joggins during the Coal Age 
was “Arthropleura” – a two metre long arthropod 
similar to an enormous millipede or a sowbug, which 
lived on the rotting vegetation of the forest floor. 
Large slabs bearing this beast’s distinctive footprints 
were found in 1964 in a huge rock fall near Lower 
Cove, at the northern end of the cliff section. The 
footprints, recovered in 1966, were moulded into a 
polyester-resin and fibreglass cast that was on dis-
play at Mount Allison University in Sackville (New 
Brunswick) until 1999, and is now at the Fundy Geo-
logical Museum in Parrsboro, Nova Scotia. A large 
piece of the rock bearing the original trackway is on 
display at the new Joggins Fossil Cliffs Interpretive 
Centre. 
No actual specimen of the animal itself has been 
found at Joggins, but its tracks are abundant and it 
must have existed there in large numbers. Similar 
trackways occur in other areas of the Upper 4

 Carboniferous rocks in Nova Scotia, and also on the 
other side of the Atlantic Ocean in western Scotland, 
on the Island of Arran in the Firth of Clyde. 
Besides actual land-dwelling creatures such as 
“Arthropleura”, fossils of aquatic animals living in 
the rivers and lakes of the area and rare examples of 
airborne, flying insects, such as large dragonflies, 
have been found.
… and scale trees
The trees in this equatorial jungle were enormous 
“Scale Trees” related to present-day Club Mosses or 
Lycopods. Their bark was covered by leaf scars that 
looked similar to the scales of fish or reptiles, and 
whose pattern varied depending on the type of tree. 
A diamond pattern is usually characteristic of “Lepi-
dodendron” whereas “Sigillaria” is characterized by 
parallel vertical rows of scars on the trunk. “Lepido-
dendron” and “Sigillaria” were the most abundant 
trees in the ancient Joggins forests. 
These trees were gigantic: the fossilized trunks 
could reach one metre in diameter and be thirty 
metres high. Their roots, called Stigmaria, are sedi-
ment-filled cylindrical fossils spreading out from the 
bases of the stumps. They are found in a layer of 
fossil soil called seat-earth or underclay, upon which 
the trees used to grow. Such layers were usually 
located below coal seams, which resulted from the 
combination of tree remains, rotten vegetation and 
peat that accumulated on the forest floor and were 
compressed by successive sediment layers and 
forests. 
The boggy undergrowth of the forests abounded 
in Calamites, a plant species similar to present-day 
Horsetails or Equisetums whose fossilized stems, 
occasionally with needle-like leaves still attached, 
are often found in the area. 
If you want a little souvenir, the beach and fore-
shore of Joggins are full of sandstone casts of Calam-
ites and Stigmaria. However, be careful! The site is a 
protected area where fossils cannot be extracted from 
the cliffs or foreshore reefs without a special permit.

We did not collapse into endless bitterness, into

We got off easy, because we were able to change

The truth is their bodies were attacked, not only 
because they were reduced to slavery – complete lack 
of freedom for the body – not only because they 
were subjected to onerous farm work, but also 
because the colour of their skin was disqualified, 
given a pejorative, denigrating, slanderous meaning. 
An issue was introduced into the social debate that 
did not exist in the slavery of antiquity. During the 
time of the slave trade, the slave was not only 
reduced to the state of beast of burden, but because 
of his colour, he deserved his servile fate. That is 
extremely serious.

Africans who were deported to America by the 
slave trade, who were wrenched from their traditional 
cultures and ethnic distinctions and found them-
selves on plantations, had lost their bearings. But 
they recreated them in suffering, in servile work, in 
extraordinarily precarious circumstances, thus 
becoming the founders of new cultures in the Carib-
bean. These cultures took on their own directions, 
separating themselves from the African and European 
heritage they synthesized. 
When they had just got off the slave ship and 
they were offered only the ideology of Christianity, 
they took from it what suited them and kept part of 
their own religious tradition. Had they only accepted 
Christianity pure and simple, they would have become 
resigned to their lot, and waited for a better one in 
heaven. Instead they put drumming in their prayers 
and from that joyful cultures emerged, based on 
dancing and singing and joie de vivre. They made 
history dance.

his name is Saroyan
William Saroyan is not simply the writer 
with a style as light as the mists above 
the fields and fruit trees of Fresno, 
his hometown in California (United 
States). His work, strongly influenced by 
a childhood torn between the Armenia 
of his origins and the promise of 
America at the beginning of the 20th 
century, is marked by the dislocation 
of immigration and uprooting. 
A prolific author with a tone both tender 
and sarcastic about the small world 
that nurtured his early years, William 
Saroyan had a life darker than his sunny 
writings would lead us to believe.
almost normal family life in Fresno, where most of 
the residents were Armenian farmers. 
Saroyan taught himself to write by devouring all 
the books that fell into his hands. He quit school 
early, finding a job at the San Francisco Telegraph 
Company, and started writing his first pieces, some 
of which were published by the Armenian-American 
newspaper “Hairenik”, founded in Boston in 1889 by 
the Hayerenik Association. Originally published in 
Armenian, the paper became entirely English-lan-
guage in 1969 under the name “Armenian Weekly”. 
In celebration of the 100th anniversary of his birth 
on 31 August 2008, the UNESCO Courier pays tribute 
to a writer of substantial humor and infinite 
melancholy. 
William Saroyan was born on 31 August 1908 in 
Fresno, into an Armenian family that had immigrated 
to California in the United States. The family cocoon 
soon disintegrated. His father, a modest farmer who 
had tried briefly to find fortune in New Jersey, died 
in 1911. The family fell apart and William and his 
brothers were sent to the orphanage. Six years later, 
his mother Takouhi found work and was able to take 
her children back. Young William was restored to an

4 Much of Saroyan’s writing is set in Fresno, which 
has decided to celebrate his centenary this year. 
Many first-generation Armenian immigrants found a 
home there, as did survivors of the 1915 genocide. 
Saroyan’s childhood left him with strong impressions. 
He depicts a semi-peasant society where Armenian-
American children grew up among the watermelon 
fields, the big traditional patriarchal Armenian family 
and school, which was supposed to teach them the 
rules and language of their new homeland. 
Though warm, the “family clan” described by 
Saroyan is deeply nostalgic for the natal soil. It is 
also marked by the contrast between Armenian soci-
ety and the often painful adjustment to American 
society.
The writer who turned down the 
Pulitzer prize
It was undoubtedly in “My name is Aram”, published 
in 1940, that Saroyan most vividly portrayed the 
years of his youth amidst a gallery of truculent and 
offbeat adult characters, a slice of secular Armenian 
life under the California sun. Yet it was another 
book, 
“The Daring Young Man on the Flying Trapeze and 
Other Stories”, published in 1934, that brought him 
significant success. Saroyan describes the tribula-
tions of a young writer in America’s Great Depression. 
In 1946, he published “The Adventures of Wesley 
Jackson” and narrowly escaped court-marshal, the 
army deeming the book overly pacifist. 
His first theatre play in 1939, “My heart’s in the 
Highlands”, was staged at the Guild Theatre in New 
York. His other play published that year, “The Time of 
your Life”, earned him a Pulitzer prize, which he 
refused. Some say Saroyan rejected the idea of a 
press magnate like Pulitzer judging works of art; 
others maintain Saroyan simply thought the play was 
“no better and no worse” than the rest of his work. 
Most of Saroyan’s narratives have a light tone and 
a host of humorous details, yet melancholy often 
seeps in. His life was far from harmonious. At the end 
of the war and following his marriage, which would 
give him two children, his growing success assured 
him an income. He began dividing his time between 
Fresno and travel to Europe and to Russia to visit 
Armenia, but also took to alcohol and gambling. His 
contradictory passions prompted a divorce. By the 
end of the 1950s, he was living more or less perma-
nently in Paris, still drinking and gambling. He died 
18 May 1981 in the place where he was born, Fresno.

Africa in the Spotlight 
In September, a monolith weighing 152 tons and 
standing 24 metres high will be erected within the Aksum 
(Ethiopia) archaeological site, inscribed on the World 
Heritage List in 1980. It’s the famous Axum obelisk, 
carried off to Rome in 1937 by Mussolini and now back 
in its homeland. About 1700 years old, it has become a 
symbol of Ethiopian identity. 
The next issue of the Courier will devote special coverage 
on the inauguration event of the Axum obelisk, an 
event which will bring together a number of well-known  
personalities from the political and cultural spheres.
