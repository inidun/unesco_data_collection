In 988, a thousand years ago, the people of Kiev
waded into the Dnieper River, in obedience to a
decision taken by their prince, Vladimir, and
underwent mass baptism. This "was an event of
great historical significance", writes Metropolitan
Juvenaly, a high dignitary of the Russian Orthodox
Church, in his contribution to this issue, "bringing
as it did a major part of the population of eastern
Europe into the family of Christian nations".
Vladimir's decision had an immediate bearing on
the fortunes of his Kiev-based principality known
as Rus', a grouping of east Slav tribes from which
the Russian, Ukrainian and Byelorussian Slav
peoples of the USSR would later emerge.In the
short term, Rus' was enabled to assert its position
vis-à-vis the Byzantine Empire and the other
Christian States of Europe. But Vladimir's decision
also had a more lasting influence on the later history
and identity of the peoples who inherited its legacy.
In the words of Pope John Paul II, head of the
Roman Catholic Church, in an Apostolic Letter
published on the occasion of the millennium of the
baptism of Kievan Rus', "The elements of the
Christian heritage have imbued the life and culture
of those nations.... making room for a totally
original form of European culture, indeed of
human culture itself."
This issue of the Unesco Courier is a contribution
to a number of activities which Unesco is
organizing to mark this anniversary, including a
symposium on "the significance of the introduction
of Christianity in Rus' for the development of
European and world culture and civilization",
which will be held at the Organization's Paris
Headquarters from 28 to 30 June 1988.
We also pay tribute in this issue to three poets
who all shared, in addition to talent, a hunger for
freedom: an Englishman, Lord Byron, who was
born 200 years ago ; a Frenchman, René Char, who
died this year; and a Peruvian, César Vallejo, who
died fifty years ago. Also commemorated in the
following pages is an important act of liberation
the abolition of slavery in Brazil 1 00 years ago. The
granting of liberty by decree, by a stroke of the pen,
was followed by a hard struggle to enjoy its fruits
on the part of a black Brazilian community which is
only today starting to discover its own identity and
forms of expression.

The Old Testament Trinity (above and front cover) was painted by the great Russian icon painter Andrei Rublev
(C.1370-C.1430) some time in the first quarter of the 15th century for the Trinity and St. Sergius monastery at Zagorsk, near
Moscow. The icon depicts the visit of three angels to Abraham and Sarah as recorded in the Bible. Rublev treats this traditional
subject in an original manner, retaining only the three angels, who are depicted with gentlegrace in a circular composition where
all is harmony and spirituality. The three figures are also those of the Christian doctrine of the Trinity, which asserts that God is
one in substance but three in "person " (Father, Son, and Holy Spirit), and is fundamental to Orthodox theology. In the 16th
century, on the orders of Tsar Boris Godunov, the Trinity was given an encasement (bkladj of vermeil andprecious stones (see
front cover), which was removed at the beginning of the 20th century when the icon was restored. Since 1929 this masterpiece of
Russian art has been exhibited in the Tretyakov Gallery in Moscow without the encasement, in all its original splendour (above) .

The baptism ofKiev
BY BORIS V. RAUSCHENBACH A thousandyears ago,
the birth ofa Christian nation
A thousand years ago, in 988, the Slav principality of
Kievan Rus', or Kievan Russia, came into being as
one of a cluster of Christian States in Europe. Its
emergence was one of the far-reaching consequences of a bold
feudal reform of the State structures which was carried out by
Grand Prince Vladimir, who wished to put his principality on
the same footing as the developed feudal monarchies of that
time.
In 980 Vladimir was at the head of a loose federation of Slav
tribes, which could only be held together by the use of armed
force (or at least the constant threat of its use). In order to
strengthen this federation, the young prince took two impor¬
tant decisions. First, he settled in Kiev, intent on keeping his
hands on the reins of government, which his predecessors had
abandoned for months or even years while leading military
expeditions. Second, he endeavoured to unite the Slav tribes
ideologically as we should say today by means of a reli¬
gion common to them all.
Once established in Kiev, Vladimir began to build fortifica¬
tions to the east of the town, thus making it clear that he meant
to stay in the capital and defend it against nomads. It was
essential to the success of the radical State reforms that life in
the city should be peaceful and safe.

Andrei Rublev around 1420 and today pre¬
served in the Tretyakov Gallery, Moscow.
Christ is depicted on His throne surrounded by
seraphim and the 4 symbols of the Evangelists
(see also colour page 21).
A thousand years ago, in 988, Vladimir, grandprince ofKiev, who had
recently been converted to Christianity, bade thepeoples over which he
ruled to follow his example, in order to consolidate their political and
spiritual union. Far left, imposing bronze statue in Kiev (4. 5 metres high
and standing on a pedestal 16 metres high) shows Vladimir holding a
cross in one handand his princely headgear in the other. The monument
was inaugurated in 1853. Vladimir later became the hero of popular
epics and was canonized by the Orthodox Church. According to the
Soviet specialist Sergei Beliaev, Vladimir was baptized in the baptistery
of the Uvarov basilica at the Byzantine town of Chersonesus in the
Crimea (near the modern city ofSevastopol). Left, drawing of a recon¬
stitution ofthe baptistery. Above left, verticalsection ofthe baptistery as
it was in the 10th century, showing the remains of the walls as they are

baptistery.
To solve the second problem the unification of the allied
tribes he first of all gave "equal rights" to all the main tribal
gods (and consequently to those groups of the clergy that had
most influence). A traveller arriving in Kiev from afar could
see that the god of his own tribe was worshipped in Kiev as
well as the Kievan gods. Six heathen gods were worshipped in
Kiev; traces of these cults have been found by modern
archaeologists.
These measures taken by Prince Vladimir strengthened the
State. But it soon became clear that the path on which he had
embarked so successfully was actually leading nowhere.
There were two main reasons for this. First, even after Vladi¬
mir's innovations the heathen religion perpetuated the old
way of life. It suited a patriarchal system, but it was a major
obstacle to the formation of the new production relationships
of nascent feudalism. A new law, new customs, a new social
awareness and a new approach to the world were all needed.
The old paganism could not provide these things. But they
were all to be found in Byzantium.
The second reason was that Kievan Rus' could not attain
equality with the leading countries of Europe and the East, it
could not, to use a modern expression, reach "world class"
unless it borrowed from those countries a knowledge of
crafts, building techniques, science, culture and much else.
And all this, too, was to be found in Byzantium.
Vladimir's choice of religion was largely conditioned by

history, but it was also due to his wisdom as a statesman. Rus'
had already forged quite strong economic links with Byzan¬
tium, which was not far away. The Bulgarians, who were the
kinsfolk of the people of Rus', had accepted Christianity
about 100 years before, largely thanks to the work of Cyril
and Methodius, who had developed a Slav alphabet and
preached Christianity in the Slav language. Vladimir's deci¬
sion may well have been influenced by the fact that in the
Orthodox Church, unlike the Roman Catholic Church, peo¬
ple could worship God in a language they understood.
At this time Byzantium was still at the height of its glory.
The tradition of Antiquity still survived there. Homer and
other classical writers of Antiquity were studied in its schools,
and Plato and Aristotle lived on in the philosophical disputes
that took place there. The Byzantine form of Christianity met
the needs of a feudal society, and therefore fully conformed
with Vladimir's intentions. And at the same time it solved the
problem of providing a single religion for all the tribes of
ancient Rus'.
Neither Rus' nor Byzantium regarded the proposed accept¬
ance of Christianity as a purely religious step. Byzantium's
view, expressed in simplistic terms, was that since Rus' was
turning to the Orthodox faith and the head of the Orthodox
Church was the Byzantine patriarch and the emperor, Rus'
automatically became a vassal of Byzantium.
But the State of ancient Rus' was expanding and was already
quite powerful, and had fought Byzantium successfully sever¬
al times; it did not intend to play the role of a vassal. Vladimir
and his court had other ideas. They thought that the accept¬
ance of Christianity and the adoption of Byzantine culture
and skills along with Christianity should in no way diminish
the independence of Rus'. As the prince saw it, Rus' should
become a State friendly to Byzantium, but should retain its
entire sovereignty.
The introduction of Christianity was a gradual process;
authorities today believe that it took around 100 years a
very short time in view of the vast size of the country. The
Christianization of Sweden and Norway, which began about
the same time as that of Rus', took 250 and 150 years
respectively.
Vladimir's political reform released a potential that had
been gradually building up within the society of Rus'. The
rapid development of the country shows how timely the
reform was.
Master builders were invited to come from Byzantium to
Rus', where they erected stone churches and other buildings
and adorned them with frescoes, mosaics and icons. Russians
worked with them, learning skills of which they had known
nothing before. The next generation erected elaborate build¬
ings in the towns of Rus', with hardly any help from for¬
eigners. Changes took place in agriculture, too, and horticul¬
ture was introduced into Rus' at this time.
The clergy who had come to Rus' from Byzantium did not
merely conduct religious services in the new churches; they
also trained "national leaders" for the Church, and knowledge
and literacy spread widely as a result. Schools were opened,
and Vladimir made the children of the nobility attend them,
despite the mothers' protests. He sent young men to study in
other countries. A chronicle was begun. Like other developed
States, Kievan Rus' started to mint its own gold coins.
Little by little, ancient Rus' became a State with a new high
culture, although it would be wrong to think that it did not
have an authentic culture of its own in pagan times. This pagan
culture was to live on for a considerable time, and it imparted
certain unique features to the art of ancient Rus'. What was'
new was mainly that body of knowledge that had already been
acquired by cultured peoples throughout the world, ranging
from the works of Aristotle to techniques for building stone
arches.
But rapid as the changes of Vladimir's day were, his feudal
reform was not completed in his lifetime. More time was
needed, and Vladimir's work was finished by his son, Yaro-
slav the Wise. As the chroniclers say, Vladimir ploughed the
land, Yaroslav sowed the seed, and we (later generations) have
reaped the harvest.
Yaroslav was as zealous as his father had been in continuing
the reform. Like his father, he built fortifications to defend his
lands, this time mainly in the west. Like his father, he saw to it
that nothing held up the feudal reforms; and he showed just as
much energy in building, clearly striving to make Kiev the
equal of Byzantium (later Constantinople). He did much to
develop trade; and he began to strike silver coins as well as
gold.
Yaroslav's principal aim, however, was to build up a

genuinely Russian intelligentsia (insofar as such a concept can
be used with reference to that period). Vladimir had not had
time to do this. Literacy in itself was not enough; steps had to
be taken to ensure that Kievan Rus' did not have to "import"
Greek clergy, that it had its own scholars, writers and philo¬
sophers, and that it could, if necessary, wage an ideological
struggle, notably against Byzantine imperial ideology. It is
not surprising that Russian monasticism is first heard of in
Yaroslav's day.
Inventories dating from the fifteenth and sixteenth centur¬
ies (earlier ones have not survived) show that most of the
books in the monastic libraries were secular rather than
religious. There were chronicles, historical records, "itinerar¬
ies" or geographical works, philosophical and military
treatises, and classical works such as the History of theJewish
War by Flavius Josephus. A learned monk must indeed have
had an all-round education.
Chronicles such as The Russian Primary Chronicle and
polemical works (often with a definite political undercurrent)
were written in the monasteries. Books were copied, too. We
are indebted to copyists in the monasteries for the fact that we
can read the ancient chronicles that have come down to us
(works such as The Song of Igor's Campaign). Icons were
painted by masters such as Alimpi of Kiev. The Russian clergy
who replaced those from Byzantium were trained in the
monasteries.
In 1051, after the death of the Greek metropolitan of Kiev,
Yaroslav himself (acting without the emperor or the patriarch
of Constantinople) "having called together the bishops", for
the first time appointed a Russian metropolitan, Hilarión, a
priest in the prince's village of Berestovo. The Russian Ortho¬
dox Church was asserting its independence. Metropolitan
Hilarión was certainly a man of great ability. His work "On
Law and Grace", a remarkable example of the literature of
ancient Rus', was a trenchant ideological weapon in the battle
for the independence of Kievan Rus'.
The work of literacy teaching and school building con¬
tinued under Yaroslav (and not only in Kiev). We have
evidence that a school for 300 children was opened in Nov¬
gorod in 1030, at which children began to "learn to read
books". Schools for girls were founded. Gradually all sectors
of the population learnt to read and write, as we know from

called "Hymn to the Cross", an important

inscriptions that have been found on strips of birch bark.
Yaroslav himself "was diligent in reading books by night and
day", and he also "collected many books, translated books
from the Greek to the Slav language, and wrote many books".
Culture was spreading rapidly among the people of ancient
Rus'.
Civilized States cannot exist without written laws. Yaroslav
introduced a number of written statutes, including "Russian
Law". In a word, under Yaroslav, who completed Vladimir's
reform, Kievan Rus' became a' freely developing feudal State,
the equal of any State in the civilized world. It was surpassed
by no other country, either in economic and social structure
(feudalism, which continued to develop) or in culture, trade
or the arts of war.
The introduction of Christianity, which became the ideolo¬
gical basis of the feudal State system of ancient Rus', played a
progressive role in the early Middle Ages. The old division
into tribes was a thing of the past. A people had taken shape as
a State, and from it, in time, emerged the Russians, Ukrainians
and Byelorussians.
The earliest works of Old Russian literature
date from the late 10th century. Most of them
have come down to us in theform ofcollections
of texts known as Izborniki. Above, frontis¬
piece of the Izbornik of 1073, one of the oldest
of these manuscripts. Based on Bulgarian texts
translated from Greek, it was compiled for
Prince Svyatoslav Yaroslavich and constitutes

over 380 articles by 25 authors.

control of the orientation of spacecraft, he was closely involved in the
preparations for the first Soviet space flights. Among his published works are

Beautyy sanctity and truth
Thephilosophy ofthe icon
BY SERGEI S. AVERINTSEV
IN the chronicles which relate the events that took place a
thousand years ago in Russia, one episode stands out
that of the so-called "testing of faiths".
Prince Vladimir of Kiev had already talked with Muslims,
Roman Catholics, and Khazars ofJewish persuasion. Then he
heard a homily from a Greek "philosopher" who also gave
. him a lesson in biblical history and a brief catechism. This
presentation, it seems, was the one that made the most
favourable impression. The prince observed that the Greeks
were "artful" and "captivating" speakers and that it was a
pleasure to listen to them.
But homilies alone were not enough; nor did doctrine and
question-and-answer sessions settle the matter entirely.
Things had to be seen, as well as heard, to be believed. And so
in AD 987 Vladimir, following the considered advice of his
boyars1 and elders, selected ten "virtuous and sensible men"
1. His chief vassals. Editor
and instructed them to obtain firsthand evidence of each faith,
observing how God was worshipped, by whom and where.
The envoys carried out their mission. The movements and
postures adopted by the Muslims at prayer in their mosques
seemed strange to them. Nor did they find any aesthetic
satisfaction in the Latin ritual: "We saw no trace of beauty
there," they said. In Constantinople, however, "the beauty of
the liturgy" to which they were introduced by the head of the
Church, the patriarch, came as a revelation. "We knew not
whether we were in Heaven or on Earth," they told the
This late 14th-century Dormition of the Vir¬
gin is thought to be the work of Theophanes the
Greek, (c.l350-c,1410) an outstanding icon
painter of Byzantine origin, or of one of his
pupils. Strong dramatic tension is created by
the vigour ofthe composition and the imposing
dimensions of the figure of Christ.

prince. "For surely there is no such splendour or beauty
anywhere upon Earth, and we are at a loss how to describe it;
we only know that God dwells there among men, and their
ceremonies are fairer than those of other nations. We cannot
forget that beauty." Time and time again the word "beauty"
recurs in their account, and the envoys' experience of that
beauty clinches their theological argument: "There, God
dwells among the people." Now the prince could make his
choice. "Then Vladimir replied, and said 'Where shall our
baptism take place?'"
Thus, the aesthetic argument carried the greatest convic¬
tion. "God dwells among men", where beauty is; beauty is
evidence and indeed proof of His presence.
Whatever the real events that inspired it, this story told in
the "Tale of Bygone Years" (also known as The Russian
Primary Chronicle), the most important historical work of
early medieval Russia, reflects a manner of conceiving, or at
least perceiving, the world that is in itself a historical fact.
Even if the thinking of Prince Vladimir and his entourage was
Known as the Ustyug Annunciation from the
town where it originated, this icon (now in the
Tretyakov Gallery) is a work of the Novgorod
school and dates from the 12th to the 13th
centuries.
In Eastern Christian churches ofByzantine tradition, the iconostasis is a
screen which separates the sanctuary, where the sacrament of the
Eucharist is celebrated, from the nave, where the congregation stands. It
is covered with icons (sacred images), andpierced by 3 doors. Far from
being a barrier, the iconostasis symbolizes the boundary between the
world of the senses and the spiritual world, and invites thefaithful to the
sacraments ofthe Eucharist. Right, the iconostasis andaltar (18th to 19th
century) of the cathedral of the archangel Michael in the Kremlin,
Moscow (16th century).
not exactly that described by the chronicler, and even if the
entire anecdote is a fiction, it has a significance which is
remarkably similar to that of a statement made during the first
half of the present century by the Russian priest, scientist and
philosopher Pavel Aleksandrovich Florensky (1882-1943)
who wrote as follows about the most famous of Russian icons,
Andrei Rublev's Old Testament Trinity: "Of all the philo¬
sophical proofs of the existence of God, that which carries the
most conviction is not mentioned in any textbook; it may be
resumed as follows: 'Rublev's Trinity exists, therefore God
exists'."
Obviously, there is a great difference between the story told
in the Chronicle and the extract from Florensky's philo¬
sophical treatise. The chronicler is artless, whereas Florensky
deploys a paradox of whose subtlety he is fully aware. All that
the texts have in common is the extreme simplicity of the
logical proposition that beauty is not "merely" beauty; it is a
criterion of truth indeed of truth at its most profound, its
most important.
An imaginary line drawn through the millennium that
separates the episode of the "testing of faiths" from
Florensky's postulate would pass through many points. On it
one would find that conjunction of a sense of style with a
sense of the sacred, expressed in icon painting, which the Old
Believers2 of the seventeenth and eighteenth centuries inher¬
ited from ancient Russia and which is perceptively described
in "The Sealed Angel", a story by the nineteenth-century
writer Nikolai Leskov. In this story, a simple stone-mason,
self-confessedly "of the most rustic education", evokes his
favourite icon, a product of the seventeenth-century Stroga-
nov school of icon painting: "The wings are outspread and
white as snow; against the clear blue of the sky, feather stands
out against feather, and strand against strand in the tuft of each
feather. You look at these wings, and all the fear in you
disappears; you pray 'Give me light', and suddenly every¬
thing falls still, and peace enters the soul".
Are we here in the presence of prayer or of ecstasy ? It is not
enough to say that the two are related. What counts is that this
form of contemplation is just as exacting as prayer; here,
indulgence in emotion, in sublimated sensibility, in art for
art's sake, are kept at a far greater distance than, for example,
in Gothic, Renaissance or Baroque art. At the same time,
prayer cannot be dissociated from the plastic reality of the
icon: there is a relation between the "peace that enters the
soul" and the contrast of "strand against strand in the tuft of
each feather". Here, as in the report by Prince Vladimir's
emissaries and Florensky's aphorism, beauty confers authen¬
ticity. Beauty can be trusted, "and peace enters the soul". But
it must be beauty of a very special kind.
It is precisely because so much depends on the quality of
this beauty that it is subjected to such rigorous demands. In
the seventeenth century, the turbulent archpriest Avvakum,

leader of the Old Believers, raged against departures from the
traditional aesthetics of icon painting, seeing in such "un¬
seemly figurations" both a spiritual betrayal and a disintegra¬
tion of the values inherent in the life of the people. What was
painted "with carnal intent" forfeited its claims to reliability,
to authenticity. It is interesting to note that at the height of the
Roman Catholic-Orthodox rivalry during the reign of Ivan
the Terrible (1547-1584), the Jesuit Antonio Possevino, who
had vainly endeavoured to convert the Tsar to Catholicism
and thus conserved a certain rancour towards Russia and
things Russian, nevertheless found words of surprised
admiration for the chasteness and sobriety which characte¬
rized both the icon and the manner of its veneration.
The hero of Dostoyevsky's novel A Raw Youth hears the
pilgrim Makar Ivanovich use the archaic word blagoobrazie,
and is deeply moved. The word conveys the idea of beauty as
sanctity, sanctity as beauty, beauty at its most austere as a spur
to asceticism.
In the psychology of the Russian people, beauty and asce¬
ticism are very closely related. Russian folklore offers an
abundance of spiritual verses about the Tsarevich Ioasaf's
renunciation of a life of luxury and his departure into the
wilderness, where care for his bodily welfare is no longer of
importance:
Here, in my wilderness,
Labouring, I must labour still;
Here, in my wilderness,
Fasting, I must further fast;
Here, in my wilderness,
Enduring, I must yet endure....
But this retreat, the scene of labour and endurance, is, as the
folktales insist time and time again, a "beautiful wilderness";
not only a vale of suffering and grief, but also a plenitude of
simple delights for eye and ear alike:
When spring in all her beauty comes back again,
Meadow and marsh will don their finest apparel,
And, in the leaf-decked wood,
The bird of paradise
Will sing with an archangel's voice.
Nowhere else, it seems, in Russian popular poesy is the
beauty of Nature accorded such generous treatment as in
these plaintive songs about a young prince's rejection of
worldly temptations. Only the austere light in which the
whole is bathed justifies the ecstasy that such beauty pro¬
vokes, by providing the guarantee that beauty itself will not
degenerate into forbidden balovstvo (frivolous indulgence),
and will retain the quality of blagoobrazie.
When Florensky, too, attributed to beauty the force of
argument, he chose Rublev's Trinity as his point of departure.
We too shall refer to ancient Russian icon painting, and to
Rublev its uncontested master, in making the more modest
but still extremely important point that the traditional Rus¬
sian attitude to beauty is not a romantic fabrication and that
the examples cited above are in no sense exaggerated.
It may be argued that the story with which we began is after
all only a legend. It is true that similar stories are told about
the conversion of different peoples to Christianity, but this
one is, we believe, uniquely Russian. It may be argued that
Florensky's statement is excessively coloured by the atmos¬
phere of aestheticism and the general climate of opinion in the
early part of this century. And it may be argued that Leskov's
characters are too stylized to be anything but artificial. Even if
Virgin Orans and St. George slaying the
Dragon (11th to 13th century), a double icon
preserved at the church of the Moscow Theolo¬
gical Academy.
such objections are unfair, the fact that they can be raised
means that none of the examples given so far reach to the heart
of the matter.
Only the ancient Russian icons, rediscovered by a handful
of enthusiasts at the turn of the century and now acknow¬
ledged as an important element of the universal heritage,
illustrate irrefutably the relationship between beauty and
sanctity. The Old Believers described by Leskov were the
guardians of a far older tradition, and the icon of the Stroga-
nov school, described with such loving attention, is the
product of a style that was in the process of disintegration. In
the fifteenth century, on the other hand, this style appears in
all its purity. Similarly, Dostoyevsky overheard in the lan¬
guage of the common people the word blagoobrazie, and it
stands out in the pages of his story as the expression of a
profound nostalgia, whereas in Rublev's work and in that of
his contemporaries, blagoobrazie the sanctity of beauty, the
beauty of sanctity is at home, is simply in its place.

Using words alone, it would be very hard to prove that the
ideal of beauty as sanctity really existed in Russian culture in a
clearly delineated, vital and active form. But fortunately the
masterpieces of the classical age of Russian icon painting are
sufficient evidence for the existence of this ideal. With them,
demonstration is no longer required, presentation is suffi¬
cient. They are proof in themselves. To paint in such a
manner, one must believe with the totality of one's being that
beauty is not a matter of aesthetics, but of ontology.
Use of these two philosophical terms is a reminder that
until the seventeenth century scholastic philosophy was un¬
known in Russia. This is why there are no Russian equivalents
of such learned works as St. John Damascene's The Source of
Knowledge in Byzantium, or the Summa theologiae of St.
Thomas Aquinas in the medieval West, which provided a
synthesis of the thinking of an entire age. This does not mean,
however, that Russia totally lacked a philosophical approach
to existence, simply that in Russia philosophizing took
another form, that of icon painting. It is not in treatises, but in
religious images; not in syllogisms and definitions, but in
visible manifestations of beauty sufficiently austere, rigor¬
ous and transparent to permit the passage of the pure light of
spiritual significance that the central ideas of ancient Rus¬
sian culture must be sought. In other words, the creation of
beauty assumed in Russia complementary functions which, in
other cultures, were the province of abstract thought.
It is now possible to understand why the style of the
Russian ¡con demands of beauty such a unique austerity,
surpassing even the asceticism of Byzantine art and radically
different from the poetic atmosphere of Gothic. It is pointless
to attempt to compare the highest manifestations of the
potential of art on the basis of "better" or "worse". Rublev's
Trinity is not "better" than the Statue of the Visitation of
Reims Cathedral, because nothing could be "better" than it.
The opposite is also true. But each of these highly spiritual
creations expresses a different form of spirituality. While one,
the Virgin of Reims, appeals to the emotions and the imagina¬
tion, the other appeals to the intellect.
Feeling is one thing; knowledge is another. This is why the
spirituality of Gothic statuary is charged with warm-blooded,
noble and chivalrous emotion and admiration before the
charms of femininity. The Gothic sculptor can permit himself
expressions of this kind because he has been relieved of
responsibility for demonstrating spiritual verities; there are
syllogisms for this purpose. In its austerity, the Russian icon
goes further, passing beyond the stage at which emotion
reigns into the realm where the spirit alone can be heard. The
aim of the Russian master-painter is not to incite, not to
disturb, not to play on the emotions, but to show truth itself,
absolute and incontestable, and to bear witness to this truth.
His duty calls for the greatest possible constraint instead of
an outburst of Gothic enthusiasm, what is required of him is
bezmolvie (silence, or quietude). In Greek, this quality is
denoted by the word hesychia, from which the Hesychasts,
members of a mystical fourteenth-century Byzantine sect for
whom "all human flesh must fall silent....", took their name.
Beauty which seeks to authenticate truth cannot but address
itself austerely.
Modern Russian culture, anticipated in the critical period of
the seventeenth century, born during the age of Peter the
Great, renewed during all the storms of Russian history,
shares a complex and sometimes dramatic relationship with
the ancient heritage of blagoobrazie. But it cannot deny its
affinity with the millenary tradition. The Russian mind seems
to find it difficult to abandon the notion of beauty as a
signpost in the quest for truth. The past two centuries have

13th century) belonged to Moscow's Novo-
devichei monastery but may have originated in

produced a number of sometimes outstanding Russian philo¬
sophers, but it is still questionable whether the authentic
Russian philosophy is not to be found elsewhere in the
verses of Pushkin or Tyutchev, for example; in the novels of
Dostoyevsky; perhaps in the music of Scriabin. Classical
Russian literature is deeply afraid of aesthetic balovstvo
frivolous indulgence: Gogol burning manuscripts and Tol¬
stoy endeavouring to repudiate the artist in himself in order to
remain simply a pursuer and pedagogue of truth, have few
parallels in the history of other literatures. What is unique in
Russian life is the attitude to poetry as both a draught of
live-giving air and an opportunity of salvation.
If the ancient faith in beauty evoked in The Russian Primary
Chronicle were to disappear altogether, what would become
ofus?

With the fragmentation of Kievan Russia into autonomous principali¬
ties in the 12th century, Russian cities experienced an extraordinary
flowering of architecture and the arts. In the northeast, the principal¬
ity of Vladimir-Suzdal became the major political centre after the
decline of Kiev. At the end of the 14th century, it was absorbed by its
appanage, the principality of Moscow.
Monuments built in the cities of this region between the 12th and the
17th centuries rank among the finest cultural treasures of Old Russia.
On a map they form a "golden ring". Photos on this double page show
some of the treasures that can be seen on a trip around the ring in
clockwise direction, beginning at the walls of the Kremlin (citadel) of
Moscow (1).
Zagorsk developed around the walls of the Trinity and St. Sergius
monastery, which was founded in 1340 by St. Sergius of Radonezh and
later became a major religious centre. (2) View from the 80-metre-high
bell tower; left, the chapel of the well (1644); at rear, the church of the
Holy Spirit (1476); right, the Trinity cathedral (c.1422). (3) Religious
service in the cathedral, for which Andrei Rublev painted his Old Testa¬
ment Trinity. (4) Cathedral of the Dormition, begun in 1559 during the
reign of Ivan the Terrible.
Pereslavl-Zalessky was founded in 1 152 by Prince Yuri Dolgoruki, who
also founded Moscow. (5) Church of the Presentation (1 778), dedicated to
Aleksandr Nevsky. (6) Right, cathedral of the Dormition at Goritski
monastery, noted for the remarkable quality of its acoustics; left, All
Saints church at Danilov monastery (13th century).
Rostov is mentioned in The Russian Primary Chronicle in 862. (7) The
Kremlin, on the shores of Lake Nero. (8) St. George slaying the Dragon.
This 1 5th-century wood sculpture is one of the treasures of the church of
St. John the Theologian (9), built above an entrance gate on the periphery
of the Kremlin (1683). (10) Centre, bell tower of the cathedral of the
Dormition, with its 13-bell carillon.
Yaroslavl, founded in 1010 by Prince Yaroslav the Wise, ranked second
only to Moscow in the 17th and 18th centuries. It has a number of
magnificently decorated churches. (11) The church of St. Elias (1647-
1650) and (12) its famous baroque iconostasis (screen decorated with icon
paintings). (13) Window framed with enamelled tiles in the church of St.
John Chrysostom, in the Korovniki district. (14) The church of St. John
the Baptist, in the suburb of Tolchkovo. (15) The monastery of the
Transfiguration of the Saviour (1506-1516), where the manuscript of the
12th-century Song of Igor's Campaign was found.
Kostroma, thought to have been founded in 1 152 by Yuri Dolguruki. (16)
The Ipatievski monastery, which houses a museum of architecture in
wood, is dominated by the cupolas of the mid-17th century cathedral of
the Trinity (17).
Suzdal, first capital of the principality of Vladimir-Suzdal, is known to
have existed since 1024. (18) In its Kremlin are the cathedral of the
Nativity (13th century) and the monastery of the Saviour-Efimievski
(14th century). (19) The central area: left, market halls dating from the
19th century.
Vladimir, founded by Vladimir Monomakh in 1 108, became the capital of
the principality of Vladimir-Suzdal in the mid-12th century. (20) The
church of St. Dimitri (1 194-1 197) and detail (21) of low-reliefs inspired by
popular imagery which adorn it. (22) The church of the Intercession of the
Virgin (1 165) on the river Nerl is a masterpiece of Russian architecture.
(23) The cathedral of the Dormition (begun 1158), where Russian princes
and metropolitans were enthroned until 1432, contains works by Andrei
Rublev, Daniel Cheorny and the school of Master Dionysius.

A thousand-year
heritage
BY METROPOLITAN JUVENALY
THE conversion of Russia to Christianity, the
thousandth anniversary of which is being solemnly
celebrated in 1988 by the Russian Orthodox Church,
was an event of great historical significance, bringing as it did a
major part of the population of eastern Europe into the family
of Christian nations.
The first seeds of the faith had, however, begun to sprout
from the soil of what was to become the State of Rus' as early
as the first century AD, the Age of the Apostles. According to
one thesis, St. Andrew, the "first-called", carried out mission¬
ary activities in the region. This thesis is confirmed by a
tradition related to this saint in the first- to third-century
Christian communities of the northern Black Sea coast. Ex¬
cavations of churches of this period at Chersonesus, Tanais
and the ancient city of Aksaiskoe (or Kobyakovoe) have
yielded moulds which were used for making communion
wafers and which are patterned with the distinctive X-shaped
cross of St. Andrew rather than the more familiar upright
cross.
During the third and fourth centuries, there were Greek
dioceses in a region stretching from the north shore of the
Black Sea to the limits of the Slav-dominated regions; the
evangelizing influence of the more sophisticated culture and
religion that they represented cannot have been lost on the
members of the Slav communities. And when, in the sixth
century, successive waves of invaders Huns, Magyars, Bul-
gars and Avars displaced the Slav tribes until they occupied
virtually the whole of the Balkan peninsula as far as ancient
Sparta, the resulting close cohabitation with Christian Greeks
must have had a further impact. From this period date the
earliest established settlements of Christianized Slavs.
According to the Lives of St. George of Amastris and St.
Stephen of Surozh, bands of Russian warriors (druzhinniki)
attacked these two cities in Asia Minor at the end of the'eighth
century, and were later baptized there. In 864 an entire Slav
State, Bulgaria, was converted to Christianity. By the tenth
century, it was already possible to speak of the eastern Slavs as
comprising both Christians and pagans a mixture noted by
the contemporary Arab writer and traveller, Masudi (c.900-
c.956), in his compilation "The Fields of Gold". It seems that
at that time Christianity had made greater progress among the
southern Slavs, who were closer to the Bulgarians and the
Greeks, than among those living further north.
In 957, Princess Olga of Kiev was baptized in Constantino¬
ple. She remained a Christian until the end of her life, and
strove unremittingly to extend the faith among her compat¬
riots. "May God's will be done," she implored; "may He
pardon my people and the land of Russia; and may it be
granted to them as it was granted to me to turn to Him." It
was Olga's grandson, Prince Vladimir, who in 988 accepted
Christianity on behalf of the Kievan State.
An age of mass evangelization had arrived. Whole countries
abandoned paganism and became part of European Christen-

The Pecherskaya lavra (Monastery of the
Caves) in Kiev was founded in the 11th cen¬
tury. Its first monks were hermits living in
caves dug out of the clay banks along the
Dnieper. The Lavra (ör important monastic
foundation), which soon became the centre of
Kievan intellectual life, is an extraordinary
architectural ensemble which was built over 9
centuries. One of the monks was the late 11th
century chronicler Nestor, the main compiler
of The Russian Primary Chronicle which re¬
lates the earliest history of Kievan Russia.

The soaring lines of the church of the Ascension
(1532) at Kolomenskoie, southeast ofMoscow,
call to mind a famous passage in The Russian
Primary Chronicle describing the awe felt by
the emissaries ofPrince Vladimir ofKiev when
they saw the majesty ofworship at Constanti¬
nople: "For surely there is no such splendour or
beauty anywhere upon Earth, and we are at a
loss how to describe it. We only know that God
dwells there among men.... "

The Christianization of Russia is important because the
new religion brought a fundamentally new manner of perceiv¬
ing the world, the organization of society, the power of the
State, relations between peoples and their interpretation of
morality. There is, after all, total antinomy between Christian
and pagan principles of self-awareness. Moreover, a Christia¬
nized world is no longer the domain of deities bent on
delivering chastisement, to be appeased with sacrifices, but
the creation of an infinitely benevolent and all-merciful God.
And all people are equal in dignity for in Christianity, as the
Apostle Paul wrote (Epistle to the Galatians, 3,28): "There is
neither Jew nor Greek ... you are all one in Jesus Christ."
"Cherish not only your own faith but also that of others", the
Russian Church enjoined its followers. Finally, Christian
baptism brought with it a number of commandments such as
"thou shalt not kill ... thou shalt not steal ... thou shalt.not bear
false witness ...", which transcended national frontiers and
were to be observed by all who shared the same faith.
With the coming of Christianity, the writings of the
Church Fathers made their way into western, northern and
eastern Europe, together with the literature of Antiquity.
Monasteries, churches and schools were founded. Annalists
like the Venerable Bede in England, Adam of Bremen in
Germany, and Nestor the Chronicler in Russia (considered to
be the compiler of the Povest vremennykh let, or "Tale of
Bygone Years", also known as The Russian Primary Chronic¬
le) committed their countries' legends to massive tomes.
There began an age of journeys, peregrinations and cultural
contacts, later to be described in autobiographical accounts,
of which the twelfth-century "Pilgrimage of the Abbot Daniel
to the Holy Land" is one outstanding example from early
Russian literature.
Christianization brought with it a passion to build. Follow¬
ing his conversion, Prince Vladimir gave orders for the con¬
struction of religious edifices in Kiev and elsewhere,
launching a large-scale programme which literally laid the
foundations of Russian architecture with such world-famous
masterpieces as the cathedrals of St. Sophia in Kiev and
Novgorod, the cathedral of the Assumption in Vladimir and
the Pecherskaya lavra (Monastery of the Caves), also in Kiev.

The painting of icons, images ofsacredfigures
or events, became an outstanding art form in
Christian Russia. In Orthodox churches such
images are venerated and have a place in the
liturgy through the iconostasis or icon-covered
screen (see page 11). The art of the icon is
symbolical rather than realistic, and the tradi¬
tional icon painter was not an artist expressing
a personal vision, but a mediator who followed
rules prescribed by tradition to make a picto¬
rial expression of Church doctrine. Austere,
and usually shunning realistic detail, Russian
icon painting is an art of great subtlety and
nuance. In oldRussian icons the subject is often
painted in a recess cut into the wooden panel,
and the raised surrounding "frame" thus
formed is part of the work. In the 16th century
and later the painted figures were sometimes
partially covered by an encasement ofprecious
metals and stones (see caption page 3).

much used by icon painters. (See also colour

belongs to an iconographical type known in
Russian as Nerukotvorny ("not made with

original icon was a legendary image sent by
Christ to King Abgar of Edessa. According to
this tradition, the king, afflicted with leprosy,
wished to talk with Jesus but Jesus, knowing
that His Passion was near, sent the king the
image ofHis face miraculously imprinted on a

The birth of Slav literature, for its part, was a direct product
of the evangelistic activities of the missionaries, Saints Cyril
and Methodius, who in the ninth century created a new
alphabet for the translation of the Gospels and various litur¬
gical works into the language known as Old Slavonic. In the
Russian Orthodox Church, the national language now began
to be used for religious services and sermons.
The eleventh and twelfth centuries also saw the emergence
of a distinguished school of Russian writers, including Hilar-
ion, metropolitan of Kiev; Cyril, bishop of Turov ; Daniel the
Exile; and Simon, bishop of Vladimir, and the monk Poly-
carp. At the same time, missionary activity and the creation of
new monasteries in outlying regions facilitated further settle¬
ment and the extension of Russian territory.
With the thirteenth century, the sky darkened. Storming
out of the east, the Mongols hurled themselves against the
State of Kiev in 1237. Three years later, the city fell and the
Horde of Khan Batu pressed further westwards, laying waste
to everything in its path. They were halted essentially because
the fierce resistance of the Russian State wore down the
Mongol forces.

For 200 years, occupied Russia was under the Mongol
yoke. While the countries of western Europe applied their
genius to the construction of cathedrals, cities and castles, the '
creation of magnificent libraries and the foundation of schools
and universities, Kievan Rus', its energies sapped by servi¬
tude, paid annual tribute to its nomad overlords.
Little by little, however, and thanks notably to the efforts
of the Church, a patriotic resistance movement took shape in
and around the hitherto obscure city of Moscow. The guiding
spirit of the struggle for freedom was the founder (in 1337)
and Father Superior of the monastery of the Trinity, St.
Sergius of Radonezh, who predicted the hard-won victory
over the Mongols on the Plain of Kulikovo in 1380, which
marked a turning-point in Russian history and a milestone on
the road to liberation. The disciples of St. Sergius travelled to
the farthest corners of the land of Russia where, in the most
remote and untamed wildernesses, they founded monasteries
and hermitages.
Despite the sufferings imposed by the Mongol yoke, the
Russian Orthodox Church continued, through the efforts of
its most faithful servants, to produce crop after crop of

in the stylization of the figures and the purity of the colours.

spiritual fruits. This period saw the foundation of religious
institutions including the Trinity and St. Sergius monastery
(1337), the monasteries of Spass-Andronikov (1360), Simo-
nov (1370), Kirillovo-Belozersky (1397), Solovetsky (1429),
and many others. Some monasteries became centres of annal-
writing; others incorporated schools and libraries; still others
provided workshops where such masterpieces of Orthodox
icon painting as the works of Theophanes the Greek and,
most notably, the Old Testament Trinity of Andrei Rublev
were created (see front cover and page 3).
The significance of Russian religious culture during the past
thousand years may be measured by its influence on
European, Asian and American cultures. At one point or
other in its history, this influence has reached out to Finland,
Poland, the Volga region, the' Caucasus and Transcaucasia,
Western Siberia, Yakutia, Kamchatka, the Amur river region,
Alaska, the Aleutian islands, North America, Japan, Central
Asia, Korea and parts of China. The evangelistic work of the
Church over these immense territories brought more than
forty different ethnic groups totally or partially into the
Christian fold; thanks to the missionaries, many of them
acquired their own written language and gained access to
translations of the Gospels. Thanks, too, to missionaries of
the Russian Orthodox Church, the original religious culture
and traditions are alive today in the art, music, architecture
and plainsong of Orthodox dioceses in such countries as the
United States, Japan and Finland.
The consolidation of Russia as a unified State centred on
Moscow may be said to have begun under the influence of
Metropolitans Peter (d. 1326) and Aleksei (d. 1378). Russian
culture of the Muscovite period may be defined as essentially
religious. At the time when western Europe was caught up in
the crisis of the Reformation, daily life in Russia was perme-
A number ofmonasteries classifiedas historical

One of them is the 13th-century Danilov

the Russian Orthodox Church. The main cere¬
monies marking the millennium have taken

ated with, and to a great extent determined by, the influence of
the Church, which inspired the creation of whole cities that
may today be considered as monuments to Russian Ortho¬
doxy: Suzdal, Rostov-Veliky, Pereslavl-Zalessky, Kirillov
(see photos pages 14 and 15).
The construction of new monasteries carried Russian
architecture to even greater heights; the result may be seen in
such splendid edifices as the churches of the Ascension at
Kolomenskoe; of St. John the Precursor in the village of
Dyakovo; of the Intercession on Red Square in Moscow (the
cathedral of St. Basil the Beatified); of Elijah the Prophet at
Yaroslavl; of the Resurrection on the Debr at Kostroma; and
very many others.
The art of icon painting has given us the names of Diony-
sius, Prokhor of Gorodets, Daniel Cheorny, Prokop Chirina,
Istom Savina, and Simon Ushakov. A Greek deacon, Paul of
Aleppo, wrote after a visit to Russia in 1666 that "the icon
painters here have their equals nowhere on Earth, such are
their artistic skills, the delicacy of their touch and their ease of
craftsmanship. ... Sad it is, indeed, that such hands are
mortal."
The heritage of Muscovite Russia developed still further
during the eighteenth and nineteenth centuries. Familiariza¬
tion with ancient traditions generated fresh literary and artis¬
tic creativity. Nikolai Gogol, Nikolai Leskov, Pavel Melni-
kov-Pechersky and many others, including Fyodor Dos¬
toyevsky, wrote against the background of Orthodox spir¬
ituality. Even the works of those Russian writers of genius,
from Pushkin and Tolstoy to Blok, whose attitude to Ortho¬
doxy was more contradictory, are indelibly marked with signs
of their Orthodox roots; while the sceptic Ivan Turgenev
depicted the piety of the Russian people in his story "Living
Relics".
The paintings of Mikhail Nesterov (1862-1942), Mikhail
Vrubel (1856-1910) and K.S. Petrov-Vodkin (1875-1939), the
sources of whose art lay in Orthodox icon painting, are of
very great interest; while the history of music has been
immensely enriched by the Russian Orthodox choral tradi¬
tion and, later, by the work of Bortnyansky, Tchaikovsky and
Rachmaninov.
Russian religious thought has left more than a few traces in
European history. During the first half of the present century,
"Russian philosophy and theology influenced western Euro¬

number tens of millions. With ten centuries' experience in
building a Christian ethic, our Church in the modern world is
engaged both in the pursuit of its traditional mission and in
the identification of new approaches to its task. Since strongly
endorsing and adhering to the international peace movement
when it emerged in the late 1940s, it has become a member of
many international organizations working for peace, cultural
creation and the safeguard of cultural values.
In 1977, for the first time in the history of our country, an
international conference was organized on the initiative of the
Russian Orthodox Church on the theme of "Clergy for a
lasting peace, disarmament and equitable relations between
peoples". The conference established guidelines for co-opera¬
tion between the Russian Orthodox Church and the members
of other religions in the struggle for peace. A similar confer¬
ence was held in 1982.
In 1987, our experience of co-operation in the struggle for
peace was widened to include not only the members of other
religions but also international public opinion, when our
Church took part in an international forum, "For a denucle¬
arized world, for the survival of humanity", which launched
an appeal for joint action.
The thousandth anniversary of the Christianization of
Russia has shown the great interest in our Church taken by
international opinion, and at international meetings held to
celebrate this event in Kiev (1986), and Moscow (1987),
scholars of worldwide reputation have traced the links be¬
tween Russian culture and the Orthodox heritage.

Everyday life and letters
in ancientRussia _
;.
I
PP
BY MIKHAIL J. BRAICHEVSKY
IN ancient Rus', birch bark played a similar role to that of
papyrus in ancient Egypt and wax tablets in Rome.
Although feudal deeds, which were meant to be pre¬
served indefinitely, were written on parchment, birch bark
was used for writing of a more everyday kind, such as
instructions about farm or household matters, acknowledg¬
ments of debt, memoranda, and private correspondence. In
1951, archaeologists working in the ancient Russian city of
Novgorod unearthed several score of these texts, the oldest
dating from the late eleventh century. The importance of this
remarkable find for the history of language and culture is
comparable to that of papyri for classical studies.
The writers and recipients of the birch bark missives were
people of various degrees of eminence and from different
sectors of society. They included boyars, patricians, ordinary
artisans, peasants and soldiers. Hundreds of such writings
have been found. Nearly all deal with everyday matters,
reflecting the humdrum side of life which in most historical
sources is overshadowed by events of national importance.
Such material is a mine of information about the extent of
literacy in Rus' and about the existence of a well-established
primary education system there. Schoolchildren even had
"exercise-books", as we know from the discovery of those
that once belonged to a little boy called Onfim, who lived in
Novgorod in the first half of the thirteenth century.
Thus it is not surprising that many inscriptions should have
been found on instruments used by the master craftsmen of
ancient Rus'. A jeweller's matrix unearthed in Kiev is in¬
scribed with the name of its owner, "Makosimov". Arabic
inscriptions on matrices discovered in the Podol district of
Kiev provide valuable evidence about the international com¬
position of the patrician class in Kiev. The inscription on an
amphora found in Kiev reads "Mstislavl's amphora", indicat¬
ing its owner. A fragment of another amphora is inscribed
with the word "good" probably part of a formula express¬
ing good wishes. Another inscription, which reads "May this
amphora be well filled!", is quite unambiguous.
Specialists are still arguing about the meaning of the inscrip¬
tion on the best-known amphora, which was discovered in a

graveyard at Gnezdovsk near Smolensk. Some read it as
Goroukhshcha (mustard), others as Goroushna (gaseous mix¬
ture), while yet another school has suggested the curious
reading Goroukh psa (Goroukh wrote this). This find is
particularly interesting because it dates from the first half of
the tenth century, before Prince Vladimir's baptism. We
know that writing existed in Rus' long before 988 from
treaties concluded between Rus' and the Greeks, from the
"Life of Cyril the Philosopher", and from information re¬
corded by writers from the East. But on the amphora from
Gnezdovsk we have a "real-life" autograph written before the
time of Vladimir.
A tenth-century writer named Chernorizets Khrabr, who
wrote a treatise on the rise of Slav literacy, suggested that
writing developed in the following stages: "first, our ances¬
tors used 'marks' and 'cuts' when they wanted to transmit
information, then they used characters from the Greek
alphabet 'without adaptation', and finally Cyril invented a
specifically Slav alphabet."
An alphabet recently discovered on the wall of the chapel of
St. Mikhail, in the cathedral of St. Sophia in Kiev, shows the
first stage of the "adaptation" of the Greek alphabet to the
phonetic characteristics of Slav languages. In addition to the
Greek letters, it contains four characters indicating the Slav
sounds "B", "Zh", "Sh" and "Shch", for which symbols had
to be found.
In any society, the introduction and spread of literacy is
accompanied by revolutionary changes in all spheres of social
life. With the coming of literacy, information becomes auton¬
omous and acquires almost unlimited possibilities for trans¬
mission in space and time. It can be said that the extraordinary
development of culture in ancient Rus' before the Mongol
invasion was largely due to this circulation of information
within society.
If we consider culture as a system, we can see that it is really
a whole, and that the factors that determine its development
influence (albeit in different ways) all spheres of creative
activity, from science and agriculture to poetry, metallurgy,
clothing and architecture. The latter calls for special attention.
Two horsemen slaying a warrior are shown on
this low-relief carving (late 12th century).
Now in the Tretyakov Gallery, Moscow, the
relieforiginally came from the cathedral ofSt.
Michael with the Golden Roof, Kiev. Built
between 1108 and 1113, the cathedral is re¬
nowned for its mosaics and frescoes, some of
which are thought to be the work of a great
Russian icon painter, Alimpi of Kiev.

Miniature from the "Chronicle of Radziwill",
a late 15th-century illustrated manuscript (see
also caption page 6). The scene, set in the
Christianized Russia of 1092, shows the people
of Polotsk barricaded inside their homes to
escape the "naves", orspirits ofthe dead, whose
appearance in Polotsk, according to the Chro¬
nicle, was a portent of great misfortune
throughout the country.
These anthropomorphic laundry beaters from
Kievan Russia are decorated with Sun and
Earth symbols. Each head has the form of the
Sun, the cross-pieces are shaped like outstretch¬
ed arms, and the base is a wide skirt carved
with Suns andzig-zag lines representing water.
What traces of the architecture of ancient Rus' have sur¬
vived and what have archaeologists learned from them?
The social structure of medieval society was such that there
were three broad categories of dwelling palaces, castles and
houses. Each was designed to provide for a certain standard of
living, a certain way of life, certain ideas about behaviour, and
about real needs and the means of meeting them. In a private
house, for instance, there was no need for a servants' refec¬
tory, but a refectory was necessary in a castle. Nor did a
private house require a throne room, which was an important
part of a palace.
It was long thought that most of the people of Kievan Rus'
lived in dug-outs with sides 3 or 4 metres long. Each dug-out
was spanned by a roof resting on the ground. Towns were
depicted as a strange mixture of magnificent temples, luxu¬
rious palaces and wretched hovels in the ground.
Researchers were not perturbed by the obvious discrepan¬
cy between this combination and the general cultural level at
that time. It did not occur to them that people who had
composed or at least who read the "Tale of Bygone Years"
(The Russian Primary Chronicle) and The Song of Igor's
Campaign could not possibly have lived in burrows, or that
women dressed in silk, velvet and brocade, and wearing
attached to their head-dresses the ornaments and pendants
that are displayed in Russian museums today could not have
crawled out of dug-outs on hands and knees.
It is true that in Rus', as in all feudal societies, the social
classes were divided by great inequalities of wealth. But at the
same time there was a limit beyond which society could not go
without sinking into degradation and decay. Archaeology has
produced convincing evidence in this field.
Stone palaces in Kievan Rus', for example, were few in
number, but we know that they existed in many large towns
in Kiev, Chernigov, Pereyaslavl, Bogolyubovo, near Vladi-
mir-on-Klyazma, and others.
Exhaustive studies have been carried out on the castles and
the many fortified urban centres that made Rus' so pictur¬
esque in the ninth and tenth centuries. Unfortunately, mis¬
understandings have occurred, because evidence has often
been misinterpreted. The tenth-century fortified centre of the
village of Gorodishche, near Shepetovka, is a good example of
such a misunderstanding. Excavations were carried out in the
village for several seasons, but the archaeologist, who was

searching for a specific "feudal manor", did not suspect that
the whole complex, consisting of dozens of dwellings, farm
buildings, tradesmen's premises and warehouses, was what he
was actually looking for.
But the type of building which has stimulated the greatest
controversy is the ordinary dwelling, about which the most
extraordinary ideas have been advanced. We now know that a
peasant's dwelling at that time was like the later Ukrainian
khata or the Great Russian izba. In the towns, most of the
buildings were log houses or frame buildings, modified and
adapted to the conditions of urban life. The frame buildings
were constructed according to the standard Fachwerk (half-
timber) technique which was widely used throughout
medieval Europe, from the Atlantic Ocean to the Caspian Sea.
Both these types of building had several floors, usually
three, it would seem, since buildings are generally shown in
ancient Russian miniatures with three floors (though some
have two or four). The "dug-outs" were simply part of the
lower floor that was set into the ground, for reasons of fire
prevention and general domestic purposes. The log houses
that have been found, especially in the Podol district of Kiev,
may have consisted of semi-basements surmounted by a
Fachwerk superstructure. Such structures have been found in
Zvenigorod, with grooves to strengthen the Fachwerk struc¬
ture at the level of the uppermost logs.
Much has been written about ancient Russian culture. An
enormous amount of fresh information has been obtained
from the latest discoveries made by archaeologists, but there is
still a long way to go before we fully understand this complex
phenomenon. One thing is certain that the culture of Rus' at
the time when it adopted Christianity was in no way inferior
to that of neighbouring peoples; and the introduction of
Christianity, which linked Rus' with a different cultural
tradition, merely encouraged the flowering of the lofty
humanism which was inherent in the culture of ancient Rus'.
MIKHAIL JULIANOVICH BRAICHEVSKY, Soviet specialist in the
history and archaeology of the Slav peoples of Russia, is a senior scientist with
the Institute of Archaeology of the Ukrainian SSR Academy of Sciences. He
is the author of over 300 publications, including "When and How Kiev was

BYRON
the rebel
BY MARK STOREY
THE English poet George Gordon,
Lord Byron (1788-1824) said that he
had been "born for opposition". In
spite of his tendency to dramatize himself, to
strike an attitude, he could be remarkably
clear-sighted about himself, and this phrase
sums up the central aspect of his life and his
work. He rebels against the norms of society
and of the literary culture of his age: his
targets, he says, are "cant political, cant
poetical, and cant moral", and he refuses to
separate them in any cosy fashion.
For Byron, politics, morality and poetry
are inextricably intertwined; by extension,
there is a crucial connection between what he
writes and how he lives. His recognition of
this makes him that much more effective and
compelling as a rebel. When he died at Mis-
solonghi in 1824, before he had seen any
action in the Greek War of Independence for
which he had gone to fight, he quickly came
to be viewed as a martyr for the cause, a
central figure around whom the freedom
fighters and their European allies could
rally, and eventually throw off the Ottoman
yoke. It was an appropriate conclusion to a
relatively brief life, in which the poet
repeatedly insisted on the superiority of
actions to words. "Born for opposition", he
died for it too.
Byron's life was tumultuous, and he has
become the figure for a certain type of
Romantic writer. But we need to see how the
living and the writing go together. If Byron
saw himself as in some way cursed from the
beginning, he could find physical justifica¬
tion for this belief in the deformed foot with
which he was born, and psychological justi¬
fication in a miserable childhood spent with
his Calvinist mother in Aberdeen.
When he inherited his uncle's estate at
Newstead Abbey, near Nottingham, in
1798, he began to believe that, as a member
of the Regency aristocracy, he could be
"well avenged" for the cruelties of his birth.
He would assert himself against the odds. He

became obsessed with physical fitness, and
was to brag, when he swam the Hellespont
in 1 8 1 0, that it was the one great achievement
of his life. Freed from the shackles of pover¬
ty, he launched on an amorous career that
seemed, at every stage, to flout convention.
He formed attachments as though they were
challenges, taking on, with increasing risk,
the women of high society who seemed only
too ready to respond to the challenge.
For Byron, the price of his wholesale sex¬
ual rebellion was to be exile: he left England
for Italy in April 1816, never to return. But
he soon discovered that the amorous delights
of Venice provided ample compensation. It
was not until he became the official compan¬
ion (cavalière servente) of Countess Teresa
Guccioli that he appeared ready to settle
down; and even then he broke all the rules,
wrecking the Countess' marriage in the
single-minded pursuit of his passion.
It would be wrong to see all this activity as
mere self-indulgence. Byron's emotional

restlessness reflected two things: his com¬
mitment to personal freedom, and his belief
that things did not, could not, remain static.
In 1810 he went on the Grand Tour of
Europe, in the course of which he began the
poem that was to bring him fame two years
later, Childe Harolde's Pilgrimage. It is very
much an autobiographical poem, with the
hero's restless depravity and self-imposed
exile a mirror of Byron's own psychology.
But it is also an astute and angry response to
the state of Europe at the beginning of the
nineteenth century.
Byron could not share in the generally
held English reaction against all the original
ideals of the French Revolution. For him,
Napoleon was still a hero; the episode of the
Elgin Marbles (still reverberating today) was
for him an indication of England's perfidy.
He recognized the importance of the Greek
ideal as represented by the ruined, classical
past, and by the stirrings towards Greek
Independence that were to find their fulfil¬
ment twelve years later. In writing ostens¬
ibly about himself, Byron was in fact pro¬
ducing a highly political and provocative
poem, championing the cause of freedom
throughout Europe.
Typically, his maiden speech in the House
of Lords in 1812 was against the tyranny of a
government that wanted the death penalty
for frame breaking,1 against what he saw as
the "palpable injustice" of the bill. But he
soon saw that his rebelliousness would not
suit him for Parliament: he did not belong in
that system, either. His fight against political
hypocrisy, however, was to bring him into
active involvement with the attempts of the
secret revolutionary society of the Carbo¬
nari to free Italy from the Austrians in the
1820s, and then, of course, the final act
much more than a gesture on behalf of the
Greeks.
All this time, he was writing poetry of an
extraordinary range and diversity. Even the
works that won him popular acclaim, the
so-called Turkish Tales, did not exactly fit
comfortably into a literary tradition. Byron
was focusing all his attention and energies on
characters with whom he could sympathize,
mysterious adventurers with guilty secrets,
set apart from society, and driven by some
all-consuming fury that elevates them into
potentially tragic heroes. These lonely
figures can be compared to the rebellious
Prometheus, about whom Byron writes on
several occasions. The image of the rebel god
who brought fire to mankind, and was
1. In the early 19th century, great distress was caused in
parts of England by the introduction of new textile
machinery ("frames") which led to the dismissal of many
handicraftsmen as well as the impoverishment, owing to
increased competition, of others who did not actually lose
their employment. In response to the destruction of
frames by organized bands, the government introduced
severe repressive legislation. Byron's speech in the House
of Lords was a notable feature of opposition to this
legislation. Editor
punished for it, is an apt reflection of the
rebel poet.
With a few exceptions, Byron had little
use for his contemporaries. His first satire,
English Bards and Scotch Reviewers, was an
attack on most living authors. The Vision of
Judgment was a brilliant and scurrilous
attack on the poet laureate Robert Southey,
who had written a poem of the same name
celebrating the imagined arrival of King
George III in Heaven. This combination of
poetical and political anger was to inform
Byron's largest, most ambitious work, Don
Juan, in which he attacks the literary giants
of his own day, the decline of moral integ¬
rity, and the glorification of war on which
the concept of Empire depends. It is all the
more remarkable for being comic. Rebel¬
lious in everything, Byron's final act of liter¬
ary rebellion is to produce an intensely
humane poem that is a radical critique of his
society, in a form that challenges the very
premises of other writers of his time. By his
determined opposition to cant, hypocrisy
and humbug, Byron ensured that his name
would survive, along with his work, as a
byword for truth and liberty.
MARK STOREY is Reader in English literature

written and edited several books, including The
Letters ofJohn Clare (Oxford University Press,
1985), and Byron and the Eye ofAppetite (Macmil-
lan, 1986). His Poetry and Ireland since 1800 will
be published later this year.
In 1823, Byron decided to join the Greeks in
their rebellion against Ottoman rule, a struggle
which ended in the establishment of an inde¬
pendent kingdom of Greece. The poet did not
live to see the end of the War ofIndependence.
After a brief illness he died in the Greek town
of Missolonghi on 25 April 1824. Missolonghi
later heroically withstood a long siege (below)
before falling to the forces ofIbrahim Pasha in
April 1826.

René
CHAR
A tribute
BY EDOUARD GLISSANT
WHEN poets die, some part of the illumination
of the world dies with them; yet the rever¬
berations of their works open up new hori¬
zons. Aloof from the fads and ephemeral triumphs of
daily life, they bear witness to and, more often than not,
are the dynamic source of those deeper currents that
shape the course of the world. :
René' Char fashioned his writings from the French
language with the silent concentration of a turner work¬
ing at his lathe, inventing a form of expression which lies
somewhere between that of the pastoral poem and the
maxim. The phraseology is familiar and the formulation
is enigmatic yet evocative; and this draws him close to the
very source of the wisdom of the people, to the world of
writings based on popular oral traditions in which the
poet works the raw material of words with the same
simplicity as a potter works his clay. Poetry of this kind
thus stands at the interface of the spoken and the written
word, even if it owes its permanence to the written
dimension. To it could be applied the words that the poet
Jean Grosjean used about the Gospels when he declared
that "... they are manifestly spoken yet deliberately
written".
This strange marriage of a diamond-hard economy of
writing and the comfortingly familiar grace of the voice is
paralleled by the rapprochement that René Char made
between justice and beauty. A militant who fought
against the forces of darkness, he never resorted to sim¬
plistic anathematizing. In one of his finest and most
profound books of poetry, Feuillets d'Hypnos, written at
the time (1943-1944) that he was leading a resistance
group in the Vaucluse against the Nazi occupying forces,
he wrote: "We invite Liberty to sit down with us at all the
meals we share. The seat remains empty but a place is
always laid for her."
The source of the consistent quality of happiness and
well-being that is to be found in René Char's writings is
undoubtedly his passionate attachment to the Vaucluse, a
region from which he never strayed. In this land of
burning light, which gave him his love of painting and of
certain artists such as Braque, Miró, Lam and Vieira da
Silva, of intense silence, whose muffled echo can be heard
in the aphorisms and philosophical notes of his Recherche
de la base et du sommet, (1941-1965; "Search for the Base
and the Summit"), of the benison of sunlit waters and the
mute stirrings of olive trees, in this very special land René
Char put down the roots of that unquenchable desire to
create, to love, to go ever further, that makes him the
contemporary of each and every inhabitant of this planet.
The French poet René Char (1907-1988)
"Et qui sait voir la terre aboutir à des fruits,
Point ne l'émeut l'échec quoiqu'il ait tout perdu. "
(And he who has seen the earth come to fruition
Will never know defeat though all be lost.)

César
VALLEJO
A revolutionary voice in modern poetry
BY LEYLA BARTET
IT is no exaggeration to say that contem¬
porary Spanish-American poetry
would not be what it is today without
César Vallejo. Yet his work, which marked a
radical break with traditional forms and sub¬
ject-matter, took shape in a society whose
reaction to it was one of indifference, if not
perplexity and hostility.
Vallejo was born in 1892 in the village of
Santiago de Chuco, in the Andes of northern
Peru, and his poetry was deeply marked by
his ties with that cultural background.
Forty-six years later already half a century
ago he died in Paris one rainy afternoon in
April 1938, as he had unwittingly prophesied
in one of his poems, when he wrote: "I shall
die in Paris on a rainy day/a day I can already
remember".
There are two main periods in Vallejo's
work, both marked by the environment in
which he lived. The first of these, which he
spent in Peru, saw the beginning of what was
to become a constant factor a rejection of
intellectual coteries and stereotypes, of the
uncritical adoption of literary models, and of
identification with any particular school.
With his first two collections of poems, Los
heraldos negros (1918; "The Black Heralds")
and Trilce (1922), Vallejo began to use a
language which broke away from Romantic¬
ism and the mannerisms of Modernism,
from the Decadent Movement, and from the
dream-inspired symbolism that were typical
of Peruvian poetry of the time. The distinc¬
tive aesthetic quality of Los heraldos negros
upset the critics, while Trilce, whose very
title is a mystery and may be a combination
of "triste" (sad) and "dulce" (sweet),
violated all the prevailing literary canons. At
the time, Luis Alberto Sánchez, a leading
Peruvian intellectual, wrote: "César Vallejo
has come out with an incomprehensible and
The Peruvian poet

extremely strange book . . . and my astonish¬
ment increases with every page".
There can be no doubt that this was writ¬
ing of a kind that the Latin American conti¬
nent had never seen before. In it ¡ntimist
cameos fuse with social preoccupations, and
contradictory ideas and emotions are cou¬
pled (faith and scepticism, hatred and love,
life and death):
All my bones are alien to me;
perhaps I stole them!
I somehow came to take something
that was meant for someone else;
and I think that had I not been born,
some other poor soul would be drinking
this coffee!
I am not much of a thief ... what will
become of me?
[Los heraldos negros]
Later, the Martiniquais poet Aimé Césaire
rightly noted that Trilce had dynamited the
language in its bid to achieve expression,
defined the problems of modernity, and
settled scores with the existing Modernist
aesthetic.
Vallejo was very quick to grasp the need
for social commitment, which he saw in
terms not so much of political militancy or
the adoption of a hard and fast partisan
political stance as of making a choice at a
given historical moment. In his student days
in the city of Trujillo in northern Peru, he
became involved with a group of intellec¬
tuals who were connected with what was
later to become the APRA Party (Alianza
Popular Revolucionaria Americana). In¬
deed, as a result of being unjustly accused of
involvement in a local uprising, he had to go
into a long period of hiding, following which
he was arrested and imprisoned for four
months.

In 1923 he moved to France, and lived in
Paris until his death fifteen years later. While
he was there, he took a keen interest in the
problems of his time. He was passionately
enthusiastic about the Russian Revolution
and in 1932 published Rusia en 1931 ("Rus¬
sia in 1931"), a short book describing what
he had learned from a visit to that country.
He was greatly distressed by the Spanish
Civil War in 1936. He was particularly con¬
cerned with the role of the intellectual in
modern society and was scathing in his cri¬
ticism of the European avant-garde. In El art
y la revolución ("Art and Revolution"), he
wrote: "Literary schools come and go. Such
is the fate of any form of anxiety which,
instead of becoming an austere creative
laboratory, merely turns into an empty
formula".
Vallejo later became involved with anti¬
fascist groups and in 1937 went to war-torn
Spain to attend a congress of intellectuals in
support of the Republic.
During his time in Europe, he wrote many
prose works and analytical essays, but it was
only after his death that the poetry he wrote
during this period came to be known, with
the publication in 1939 of Poemas humanos
("Human Poems") and España, aparta de mí
este cáliz ("Spain, take away this cup from
me"). These books reveal significant changes
in Vallejo's style. Although some of the
features present in Trilce are still to be found,
there is a growing preoccupation with rhyth¬
mic patterns and with the overall structure of
the poems, so that the reader never feels that
the writing is disjointed. Vallejo was now
making more systematic use of such devices
as enumeration and anaphora, or repetition.
Neither pebble, nor oven nor white dog
Defenceless Malaga, where my death was
born
While taking a stroll
And where it died ofpassion without being
born....
Malaga, following in your footsteps, with
no way out.
[España, aparta de mí este cáliz]
Vallejo was a poet of universal and
prophetic significance. This explains both
why his work continues to be so relevant and
why his poetic diction is so surprisingly
modern. It also accounts both for the failure
of his contemporaries to understand him,
and for the heart-rending emotion he felt as a
creative artist. This was undoubtedly the
price he had to pay for being one of the
greatest poets who has ever written in
Spanish.

THE LONG STRUGGLE
FOR LIBERATION
Reflections on the abolition of slavery in Brazil
THE abolition of slavery in Brazil,
which was enshrined in the Lei Áu¬
rea ("Golden Law") of 13 May 1 888,
was the outcome of a long struggle punctu¬
ated by defeats as well as victories. The
decree that became law on that Sunday in
May was couched in simple, unembroidered
language:
"Article 1 : With effect from the date of the
present law, slavery is declared to be abo¬
lished in Brazil.
Article 2: All provisions to the contrary are
hereby repealed.
(Signed) Isabel, Imperial Princess Regent."
In spite of the brevity and terseness of its
language, this document, which had actually
been drafted six days before, on 7 May 1888,
revealed the extent to which the struggle
against slavery in Brazil had intensified.
It was the culmination of a long story in
which African slaves black Brazilians
were treated as chattels. Their fate was de¬
cided as if they were pawns in a game of
chance.
The black slaves who, according to "offi¬
cial" records, were present in Brazil from as
early as 1550, became a key element in the
country's development. "Without the
Blacks, Brazil would not exist," claimed the
Portuguese historian Oliveira Martins.
There would have been no sugar or coffee or
tobacco, and stock-raising and mining
would not have been developed. None of the
wealth that fuelled Brazilian prosperity in
the late nineteenth century would have been
generated. It is easy to grasp the importance
of the interests that opposed the emancipa¬
tion of the slaves.
It can be argued that the Brazilian eco¬
nomy would have collapsed without the
black slaves. Hence, before the long process
of liberation could begin, the circumstances
that had prompted the European countries
to impose slavery in the Americas had to
change.
After abolishing the slave trade, Britain
began to exert pressure on other nations to
follow suit so that the products of her col¬
onies would continue to be competitive.
Brazil came under this pressure after achiev¬
ing independence in 1822, and probably as a
result of it Emperor Pedro I signed a conven¬
tion in November 1826 (ratified the follow¬
ing year) whereby "any trade in slaves con¬
ducted in the three years subsequent to this
date shall be deemed to constitute piracy".
BY OSWALDO DE CAMARGO
The Emperor had spoken, but how much
weight did his wishes have compared with
those of the powerful interests involved in
the Brazilian slave trade? This was only the
beginning of a long and gradual process dur¬
ing which many decrees were promulgated,
some of them tinged with bitter irony, such
as the law in respect of "sixty-year-olds",
which freed Blacks who had reached sixty
years of age.
After the slave trade had been officially
abolished in 1850 under the law sponsored
by Euzébio de Queirós and as a result of the
vigorous steps taken by the authorities, no
more "ships laden with ebony" would ever
again set sail from Africa for Brazil. And,
some thirty-eight years later, Princess Isabel
would sign the celebrated Aurea law.
What is a slave but an empty shell, utterly
devoid of speech? "Servus non habet perso¬
nam" slaves have no personality ; they have
no bodies, no past, no names, no property.
For white people, slaves, as bodies without
the attributes of personality, were by defini¬
tion the incarnation of a social void.
Indeed, the most harrowing and dramatic
consequence of slavery in Brazil was the
slaves' loss of their identity. And it is that
identity which black Brazilians have been
10013»00
de
seeking since the beginning of the century
through paths that have been fraught with
difficulty.
White Brazilians were among the first to
praise the abolition of slavery. One of them
was Luis Murat, whose "Redemption
Hymn" was set to music by Abdom
Milanez:
How fortunate you are, my native land.
Your explorers see you emerge as beautiful as
the dawn.
Tell the slaves that masters no longer exist
and that now they arefree the world over.
These 4 photos ofblack slaves in Rio deJaneiro
were taken before 1870 by a Rio photographer,
José Christiano de Freitas Henriques Junior.
They belong to a series ofportraits originally
usedaspostcards showing "a substantialpart of
the population of Rio de Janeiro, over half of
whom are Blacks or mulattos, slaves or free".

However, this is not the tone adopted by
most black Brazilians when they think about
13 May. The literature produced by Afro-
Brazilians to advance the arguments pro¬
pounded in the nineteenth century by the
mulatto Luiz Gama and by the Black Joäo da
Cruz e Sousa is a magnificent demonstration
of their desire to achieve self-awareness and,
above all, to act as black people.
While white people such as Luis Murat
could sing the praises of 13 May in a spirit of
tranquillity and satisfaction, the black poet
Carlos Assumpçâo (born in Teite, Säo Paulo
State, in 1927) gives vent to feelings of anger
in his poem Protesto:
Although my words offire are not heeded,
I shall not cease from crying out
No. I shall not cease from crying out,
Masters.
I was sent into this world
To protest
Neither lies nor empty show, nor anything
else
Can make me silent.
And he goes on to say:
. One day, in the midst of applause and
bouquets of roses,
They suddenly cast me out from the prison
where I lay
Into a more spacious prison.
The freedom they granted me
Proved to be a Trojan horse.
There were snakes lying in wait
Under the cloak of enthusiasm.
Earlier, the poet Solano Trindade (1908-
1974), from Pernambuco, in his Cantares äo
meu povo (1961; "Songs for My People")
had written:
/ sing the praises of Palmares,
Without envying Virgil or Homer
Or Camoens,
Because my song
Is the cry of a race
In the thick of its struggle
For freedom.
The Brazilian slaves always fought for
their freedom, there should be no mistake
about that. The black people in Brazil were
never submissive and never yielded to their
lords and masters. Right from the outset,
whether in the countryside or in the city,
revolt and flight were commonplace. In
1719, the slaves of the State of Minas Gerais
planned an uprising against their white mas¬
ters. The date was set for 30 March. In his
book Aboliçâo em Minas ("Abolition in
Minas Gerais State"), Oliam José states that
"the rebels had reached the point where they
had appointed a king and ministers to help
them govern the black country, so that there
would no longer be slaves in Minas Gerais".
However, the movement was betrayed and
the uprising did not take place.
Quilombos, settlements of fugitive slaves,
came into being. In the largest of them, there
were a code of legal and moral rules and a
tribunal to judge the most serious misde¬
meanours. The most famous of the many
quilombos was Palmares, a veritable republic
founded in the seventeenth century. The
significance of Palmares, which soon came to
be known as the black Troy, is increasingly
recognized, especially by the present-day
black movements in Brazil. Earlier in the
century Palmares also had great symbolic
values for the Imprensa negra ("Black
Press") which was published from 1916 on¬
wards by a group of Afro-Brazilians, and for
such movements as Frente negra ("Black
Front") which was launched in Säo Paulo in
the 1930s.
A genuine black hero emerged from Pal¬
mares. This was Zumbi, a black warrior who
fought against the slave-owners. A "Short
History of Brazilian Blacks" published in
Brazil in 1976 describes how "After two
years' resistance, the troops led by the mer¬
cenaries Domingos Jorge Velho and Bernar¬
do Vieira de Meló succeeded in destroying
Macaco, the capital of the Palmares quilom¬
bo, in 1694. In the course of the battle, many
Blacks perished or else flung themselves over
the precipice surrounding the citadel. On
that occasion, Zumbi managed to escape and
lived to return and mount further attacks
but, on 20 November 1695, he was cornered
in his hideout after being betrayed by a
former companion-in-arms. Outnumbered,
he died fighting heroically against an enemy
force." The date of 20 November has come
to be the Day of Black Consciousness in
Brazil.
For Brazilian Blacks 13 May is a day of
reflection, on which they give thought to the
consequences of the Aurea law promulgated
by Princess Isabel. By way of conclusion, it
should be noted that 13 May is severely
condemned in the works of most black Bra¬
zilian authors.
One of them, the poet Oliveira Silveira,
(born in Rio Grande do Sul in 1941) pro¬
claims in his poem "Treze de Maio":
The thirteenth of May spells betrayal:
Freedom without wings
Freedom with clipped wings
Like
This poem.
And so disenchantment with the historical
date on which slavery was abolished in Bra¬
zil continues to be a distinct and consistent
theme in poetry and prose, indicating the
way in which black people nowadays think
about their condition. In his book A noite
nao pede licença (1987; "Night Seeks No
Permission") Paulo Colina writes:
May
Thirteenth
One thousand eight hundred and eighty-
eight
Sounds to my ear like a whisper
From the cosmos.

Watercolour depicting black slaves in Brazil is
by the French painter Jean-Baptiste Debret
(1768-1848), who went to Brazil in 1816 as
official court artist to the Emperor Pedro I.
Debret recorded his experiences in Brazil in
many paintings and drawings and in 3 illus¬
trated volumes entitledVoyage pittoresque et
historique au Brésil (1834-1837).
Startled by sirens,
The night
Rouses me out of my sleep.
I turn out my pockets,
Looking for the pass
That will allow me
To cross the streets
Of Säo Paulo
In uneasy peace.
The Princess forgot to sign
Our labour permit.
I'm afraid that a living Palmares
Is still necessary.
The same sentiment is reflected in prose.
In some instances, this sense of frustration is
expressed with deep irony and bitterness.
The following passage is taken from A
alvura das pálpebras (1987; "Under the
Whiteness of the Eyelids"), a story from a
collection entitled Quizila by Cuti (Luís
Silva):
"My grandfather told me to kill the Prin¬
cess. I took from his hands the guts of my
great-grandfather and used them to strangle
the 'Mistress of Freedom '."
It is clear that this centenary year of the
abolition of slavery in Brazil represents, for
the black Brazilian, something that is still
unfinished and unfulfilled, which has to be
re-examined and re-evaluated. The black
people of Brazil and especially black intel¬
lectuals and black students are today re¬
vealing the hidden underside of that historic¬
al event. Brazil has changed and, with it, its
former slave population which, for a century
now, has been gradually asserting itself by
the force of its gestures, its actions and its
words. Little by little, it is taking control of
its destiny and its soul.
They are merely human beings, black hu¬
man beings. What could be more important
than that?
OSWALDO DE CAMARGO, Brazilian jour¬
nalist and poet, is an active participant in the work
of Black movements, especially in the field of
literature. He is the author of six books, including
"Black Writing Notes on the Black Presence in
Brazilian Literature" (1987).

slaves in the 16th and 17th centuries). Palmares,
symbol of resistance to slavery in colonial Brazil,
held out for almost a century against many

Theatre" at Rio de Janeiro by Abdias do Nas¬
cimento.
1945: End of the Getúlio Vargas government:
