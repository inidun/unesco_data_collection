Masked Phantoms
1990, clay sculpture
(30.5 x 12 x 9 cm)
by Clara DeLamater
"I've come back from a
long stay in Dogon
country. The stone of the
cliffs, the clouds in the
sky: everything there is
flesh and bone." Clara De
Lamater is a French-
American sculptor living
in Paris. Her trip to Mali
marked an important
stage in the development
of her work, already
admired for its richness.
Rhythmic, visionary and
sensual, her Dogon-
inspired sculptures
forcefully express her
desire to capture what
one critic, referring to
her work, described as
"humankind's primary
dance".

General policy
Meeting in Florence, the General Conference
defines a "basic programme" of 120 activities
grouped under 10 major tasks.
The first UNESCO expert is sent into the field
as part of the UN technical assistance programme
on a scientific mission to Iran.
The first conference of representatives of inter¬
national non-governmental organizations
(NGOs) co-operating with UNESCO is held in
Florence. Ever since its early days UNESCO has
sought to collaborate with the NGOs, which
constitute a precious link with specialists in
UNESCO's fields of competence and help the
Organization to accomplish its programme. In
1990, UNESCO was officially associated with
585 NGOs. In 1988-1989, from UNESCO's own
resources, contracts amounting to almost $2.6
million were concluded with NGOs. During the
same biennium subventions allocated by
UNESCO to NGOs approached $4 million.
The first regional conference of UNESCO
National Commissions is held at Havana. The
National Commissions are bodies established by
Member States, in accordance with UNESCO's
constitution, in order to associate their major
institutions in education, science, culture and
communication with UNESCO's work.
UNESCO is the only specialized agency of the
UN which has this system.
UNESCO's Co-Action Programme is created
to aid development projects in Member States.
Between 1950 and 1990 $14,546,291 collected
by national Co-Action partners, NGOs, schools,
etc. have been allocated to several hundred
projects.
Education
A joint UNRWA-UNESCO education
programme on behalf of Palestine refugee chil¬
dren in the Middle East is launched (UNRWA:
the United Nations Relief and Works Agency
for Palestine Refugees in the Near East). In
1950-1951 there were 42,122 pupils in schools in
refugee camps; today the figure is 370,600. 5,200
vocational and teacher training centres are
involved in the programme.
Exact and natural sciences
The first issue of the quarterly Impact ofScience
on Society appears.
Impact, today published in English, French,
Chinese, Russian, Arabic and Portuguese,
presents to a wide audience the achievements of
modern science and describes their impact on
society, notably in the developing world.
Social sciences
The first studies on social tensions, stereotypes
and their connection with international under¬
standing are undertaken, and UNESCO produces
its first publications in this field (by Otto Kline-
berg, Margaret Mead, J. Stoetzel and others).
Culture
The History ofMankind: Cultural and Scien¬
tific Development is launched under the respon¬
sibility of an international commission headed
by P. de Berredo Carneiro. 6 volumes are pub¬
lished between 1963 and 1976 with the collabo¬
ration of a thousand specialists from over 60
countries. A new, updated edition is currently
being prepared to take account of political
changes and the latest historical research. The 48
quarterly issues of the Journal of World History,
published as part of the project between 1953 and
1972, are still a valued information source.
Communication
The "Florence Agreement" for the abolition
of customs duties on certain educational, scien¬
tific and cultural materials (including books), to
which over 79 countries are today contracting
parties, is signed. This agreement, which comes
into force in 1952, extends and strengthens the
Beirut agreement.
im
Education
The UNESCO Institute of Education (UIE)
is established in Hamburg. Today it is mainly
concerned with research and documentation
relating to lifelong education.
UNESCO sets up in Mexico a Regional
Centre for Fundamental Education in Latin
America (CREFAL).
The first regional centre of its kind, it is mainly
concerned with drawing up strategies and metho¬
dologies in the fields of fundamental education,
community development and literacy work, and
with the implementation of pilot experiments
and the production of teaching materials. It later
plays an important role in the major project for
education in Latin America and the Caribbean
launched by the General Conference at the
beginning of the 1980s.
Exact and natural sciences
The first session is held in Algiers of
UNESCO's Advisory Committee on Arid Zone
Research, which leads to the first development-
oriented international scientific research
programme. This is the first concerted attempt
to combat desertification, a crucial problem in
many Third World countries.

General policy
At Montevideo, the 8th Session of the General
Conference decides that members of the Executive
Board, while they should necessarily be compe¬
tent in UNESCO's fields of activities, will hen¬
ceforth represent governments of the States of
which they are nationals. It adopts as the emblem
of UNESCO a temple in the image of the
Parthenon, in which Phidias saw "proportions
rather than dimensions"a symbol of the balance
between nations that inspires UNESCO's activi¬
ties and of its cultural mission.
The USSR becomes UNESCO's 70th Member
State, followed by the Ukrainian SSR and the
Byelorussian SSR.
A first step is taken towards programme con¬
centration. A distinction is made between general
programmes (UNESCO's permanent and
universal functions) and special activities
(designed to meet specific needs of Member
States).
The UNESCO Courier changes its format. The
number of language editions later rises to 35
(1991) plus 4 Braille editions. The first non- 1
headquarters edition is the Russian (Moscow,
1957). A German edition follows in 1960. Edi¬
tions in Swedish and Basque are launched in
1985.
The magazine's current format dates from
1989, when the contents were also modified to
concentrate on major themes designed to interest
a wide public and treated from an increasingly
cross-cultural viewpoint.
The European Centre for Nuclear Research
(CERN), created with the participation of
UNESCO, comes into operation.
Culture

JACQUES-YVES
COUSTEAU
The French oceanographer Jacques-
Yves Cousteau is internationally
renowned as a marine explorer and
defender of the oceans. A pioneer of
undersea investigation, he has sailed
all over the world on océanographie
expeditions and has also written and
produced films about the oceans
which have attracted immense
audiences. He is now preoccupied
with the protection of the environ¬
ment in an age of rapid economic
expansion and population growth.
How did you come to be interested in
nature andparticularly in nature in aquatic
surroundings?
I have always been curious about things.
When I was a child I used to go out bird-
watching at night. I ran into a certain amount
of opposition from my parents, who weren't
very keen on curiosity if it exposed me to
risks.
I first really started to learn about water
when I was ten years old. I was in a holiday
camp near a lake in the United States. We had
to collect garbage from under the children's
diving platform, and to do that I learned how
to dive and swim under water. I had no
goggles or any other special equipment and
bringing the garbage to the surface was quite
a job. I spent two or three weeks diving into
that lake and eventually I learned how to hold
my breath under water.
Later, when I was fourteen, I improved
my underwater swimming techniques. There
was a swimming pool at my school in Alsace,
and I used all kinds of contraptions made from
tubes and pumps in order to breathe under
water. I wasn't trying to observe the natural
world. I was imitating the James Fenimore
Cooper heroes who hid under water and
breathed through hollow reeds when trying
to escape from their pursuers.
I slowly became convinced that I wanted
to be a sailor. I passed my baccalaureate and

The resources
of our planet
then, when I was twenty, I won a place at the
French naval academy. Two years later,
during a round-the-world voyage on a training
ship, the feanne d'Arc, I witnessed a scene that
had a decisive impact on my life. At Cam
Ranh Bay in Indochina, at the hottest time of
day, between noon and two o'clock, I saw
people diving from their boats and then sur¬
facing with fish in their hands. They told me
that while the fish were having their siesta
they were very easy to catch! I thought that
this was so extraordinary that I decided to
improve my underwater swimming tech¬
niques further.
For the time being, however, I had no
opportunity to do so. I was given command
of the French naval base at Shanghai,
providing supplies for ships which docked at
the French concession. It was only later, when
I returned to France and thought about the
people of Cam Ranh Bay, that I came back
to the idea of developing underwater swim¬
ming techniques. In the meantime I had
become friendly with Frederic Dumas and
Philippe Taillez. We became the Three
Musketeers of underwater adventure.
I became obsessed with the problem of
breathing underwater. My friends and I tested
all the breathing apparatus that existed at that
time and found that none of it was satis¬
factory.
Then came the war and the occupation.
That was when I met Emile Gagnan, an
engineer with the Air Liquide company who
had developed a motor vehicle powered by
carbon dioxide produced from burning wood.
The combustible gas reached the engine via
a special feeder valve. This system is used in
the underwater breathing device with which
my name is associated, millions of which have
been sold. In my device, which is entirely self-
contained, the gas passing through the feeder
valve is compressed air. Using this system,
Dumas, Taillez and I were able to extend the
possibilities of underwater swimming and start
to make films.
are
. . .there is a limit
that should not be
exceeded,
a habitability
threshold that must
not be crossed.
When the war was over, I told officials at
the Navy Ministry about this entirely new
system we had developed and suggested that
a study centre be opened at Toulon. As a
result, a centre for underwater study and
research was created in the Arsenal at Toulon.
You didn't stay there very long.
No. In 1949 I decided that it was time to
apply what we had learned. To do this we
needed a ship. Where was the money to come
from? I opened my address book. Under the
letter A, I saw the name Auniac. He was a
charming fellow. I had met him and his wife at
winter sports. He was the agent of Guinness
which, among its other activities, controlled
the shipyard at Antibes. After a meeting,
Guinness opened credit facilities for 25 million
francs and put the manager of the Antibes
shipyard at my disposal.
It sounds like a fairy tale.
Absolutely! With the manager of the
Antibes shipyard we went to Malta where we
found a converted minesweeper that was being
used as a ferry between Malta and Gozo, the
little island that is supposed to be the legen¬
dary Ogygia of the Odyssey. In fact that's why
the minesweeper's owner had named his ferry
the Calypso. We bought the ship for seven mil¬
lion francs. The Calypso was in perfect condi¬
tion, but we had to use the rest of my credit
to refit her and equip her with
oceanographical research instruments.
Then we began our cruises. The credit
from Guinness was used up and I had no more
money. I joined the CNRS.* Since the war,
France had had no océanographie vessels, and
so for a few years we served as a transport and
liaison vessel for French oceanographers.
Then came the great success ofyour film
The Silent World. . .
The Silent World dates from 1956. The first
Calypso expeditions, in the Red Sea, go back
to 1951. We had already made some quite

remarkable films, one of which won the
Grand Prix at the Paris documentary film fes¬
tival in 1951. We were making colour films
as far back as 1953. Things were very difficult
in those early days. Water tends to absorb
colours and we had many lighting problems.
We did a lot of work on the development of
camera techniques, filters, optical and lighting
systems, and so on. Gradually we were able
to start using video up to professional stan¬
dards, initially in black and white.
Around that time I constructed the first
French underwater television cameras. Later,
at Marseilles, I created the Centre d'Etudes
Marines Avancées. It was at Marseilles that we
built the first submarine for exploration, spe¬
cially designed to carry out scientific obser¬
vation at a depth of 350 metres. Then, for the
French State, we made an observation subma¬
rine capable of going to a depth of 3,000
metres and, for the Americans, a third sub¬
marine capable of operating at 600 metres. I
also built two one-man pocket submarines
which are still in working order today. Finally
we began to build a bigger submarine from
which divers could emerge. When the hull was
finished work had to stop because we had no
more money. That's how things stand today,
twenty years later.
In 1954 we carried out a mission for the
Darcy Exploration Company. We had a very
good contract which enabled us to install the
radar and measuring equipment we lacked. We
were the people who discovered oil in the
Gulf! It was us who made the emirate of Abu
Dhabi rich!
The Silent World brought in enough
money to finance our work until 1972, virtu¬
ally without any other source of income.
Since then we have made many films. In
1962 we also carried out experiments in which
men lived and worked underwater at consider¬
able depths. The first of these, known as Con-
shelf I, was carried out at Marseilles. Then
came Conshelf II, in the Red Sea, and finally
in 1965, Conshelf III off Cap Ferrât.
How were these experiments carried out?
We used a spherical vessel within which the
atmosphere, consisting of a mixture of oxygen
and helium, was maintained at the sur¬
rounding water pressure. Six people lived in
the sphere for three weeks, and when they
emerged it took another week to gradually
decompress them.
With this experiment we became the first
people to do what is known as saturation
diving. Since then, the offshore oil industry
has gone in for this in a big way.
We made innovations in a wide variety of
fields. We developed cameras which we have
used as far down as 8,000 metres.
We have taken thousands of photos and
made extraordinary films in a number of
Atlantic trenches. We were also the first to
dive in the Antarctic with a submarine and
to carry out systematic exploration there in
diving gear. We recently made the first diving
equipment using plastic bottles filled to a pres¬
sure of 300 bars.
How did you become interested in environ¬
mental problems?
It was an interest that developed slowly.
Right at the start we coined a slogan: "Know,
Love, Protect". That is exactly what happened
to me! I began by exploring. When I saw all
this beauty under the sea, I fell in love with
it. And finally, when I realized to what extent
the oceans were threatened, I decided to cam¬
paign as vigorously as I could against every¬
thing that threatened what I loved. My story
forms a cycle. I hope my children can follow
the same path.
What are the main dangers that, threaten
the Earth today?
After travelling the world as I have for years
on end, and seeing it from helicopters, as a
diver, from on board ship ... I would sum
up my feelings by saying that the resources
of our planet are finite, that there is a limit
that should not be exceeded, a habitability
threshold that must not be crossed.
We should ask ourselves how many
animals and people our planet can continue
to support before the quality of life deteri¬
orates, before all Earth's beauties fade. Fifteen
years ago, when I was in the United States,
I tried to construct a mathematical model to
find out how many people our planet could
support with the income, purchasing power,
and amenities enjoyed by the average
American at that time. The data at my disposal
were not very precise and right from the start
I knew that the approximation would be of
the order of 40 to 50 per cent. At that time
I was friendly with the director of the Océano¬
graphie Laboratory of the University of
Southern California, whose researchers served
my colleagues and myself as advisers. With the
parameters I had at my disposal, I came up
with the figure of 700 million. Seven hundred
million people enjoying a standard of living
comparable to that of the average American!
Fifteen years ago our planet was unable to pro¬
vide an agreeable life for more than 700 mil¬
lion people! World population was then four
billion!

I was alarmed by the results of my
research and told the laboratory director about
it. Do you know what he said? That my
results were highly optimistic. He had con¬
structed the same model as I had and had come
up with a figure far lower than mine! Since
then I have been obsessed by the problem of
the habitability of the planet.
World population currently stands at 5.7
billion, a figure that is rising at dizzying speed.
Every six months, a population equal to that
of France is added to the current figure. And
every ten years a population equal to that of
China is added to that of our human ant-hill.
Everyone is convinced that population
growth cannot go on in this anarchic, can¬
cerous way. But when the question arises as
to what should be done, nobody wants to
know. People make out that nothing can be
done, that it's all too complicated, that things
are even more difficult because of ingrained
habits, religions and whatever. In fact, religion
has nothing to do with it. Italy is the world's
most Catholic country and yet it has the
world's lowest birth-rate. Spain, which is also
Catholic, is in a similar position. Its birth-rate
is dropping vertiginously. In Indonesia, the
world's biggest Islamic country, a birth con¬
trol campaign in the last ten years has reduced
the birth-rate by almost 50 per cent.
So religion shouldn't be held responsible.
Fear of the future may be, however. In the
so-called developing countries there is no
insurance for old age. Retirement pensions, if
they exist, do not even provide for basic needs.
Even when they are young people panic when
they think about their old age, especially since
they grow old quickly because of poor sani¬
tary and other conditions. To care for them
in their old age they need a male child they
can rely on. And since they have to take
account of their chances of having daughters
as well as sons, of mortality rates, and of the
possibility that some of their children are not
going to be interested in looking after them
when they get old, they need to have six off¬
spring before they can be sure of having a
dependable male child. Six children to be sure
of having three boys. Three boys to be sure
of having two who survive. And two living
boys to be sure of having one who will look
after his parents.
In addition to the insecurity factor there
is the factor of female illiteracy, which is also
a result of poverty. In the developing coun¬
tries education has made great strides but there
are still not enough schools. Selection is thus
made on the basis of sex. Boys take priority
over girls when it comes to enrollment in
school.
Why? My answer may make you raise
your eyebrows, but the fact is that little girls
do not go to school because there is no safe
drinking water. When there is no drinking
water in the vicinity the girls have to go and
fetch it from the spring. I have seen adoles¬
cent girls fetch drinking water from twenty
and sometimes thirty kilometres away, which
takes a whole day. By the time they are four¬
teen or fifteen years old, these girls whose lives
are geared to meeting the urgent need for
water have never been to school, have never
learned anything. How can they use con¬
traception or even know that contraception
exists?
Some people even try to explain exces¬
sively high birth-rates by the fact that for
hundreds of millions of people love is the only
source of happiness. Contraception neither
prevents nor reduces happiness. The con¬
traceptive pill is distributed freely in many
poor countries and yet the women do not take
it. Why? Because they have had no education
and are subjected to the will of the men who
either do not care about the consequences or
want children to look after them in their old
age-

conditions. This figure will soon double.
Perhaps we shall manage to feed the expected
10 or 12 billion. But that's just about all we
shall be able to do.
Some people believe that the sea can be a
rich source offood. . . .
That is a ridiculous idea. The sea's resources
are diminishing. There is far too much over¬
fishing already. And even if we manage to
keep on harvesting the same quantity of pro¬
tein from the sea, this quantity is bound to
diminish as a proportion of consumer needs.
I remember that at the beginning of my career
10 per cent of the protein consumed came
from the sea. Today the proportion is of the
order of 4 to 5 per cent. Tomorrow, when the
population has doubled, it will fall to 2 per
cent. Here too, productivity has a ceiling
which cannot be exceeded. We are already in
the overfishing zone.
And yet we can increase productivity on
land. Why can't we do the same with the sea?
The rates of return are not at all the same.
In the Antarctic, for example, it takes ten
tons of microscopic algae to form a ton of
krillkrill are tiny shrimps ... and it takes
one ton of krill to produce 20 kg of whale.
This is a transformation factor of 40 to 1. To
produce a cow on land, the transformation
factor is ten to one.
What about désertification? Isn't it true
that whereas the desert has been invading
agricultural land it may now be retreating.
The information on which this view is based
is too recent and needs to be confirmed. All
the same, I am willing to accept that the Sahara
was created by human beings and that it may
consequently be unmade by them. If the
Sahara were to become cultivable, its output
would be far higher than that of the sea.
What about pollution?
Global warming and the increasing rarity
of water are far more serious and urgent
threats than the chemical pollution we hear
so much about. There is less and less water

because water is squandered, and this too goes
hand in hand with overpopulation. Water is
being wasted at a terrific rate. In the West,
farmers water their crops in such a way that
90 per cent of the water evaporates. We draw
on groundwater and then let it evaporate! This
year, in spite of abundant rainfall, France will
be facing drought problems. Why? Because in
the last three years we have wasted much of
the water we have drawn.
The damage caused to the planet is a func¬
tion of demography but also of levels of
development. One American tires the planet
far more than twenty Bangladeshis. Damage
is also linked to consumption. Our society is
geared to increasingly useless consumption.
It's a vicious circle which I compare to a
cancer.
Some snakes, mosquitoes and other animal
species pose threats or dangers for
humankind. Can they be eliminated like the
viruses that cause certain diseases?
Getting rid of viruses is an admirable idea,
but it raises enormous problems. In the first
1,400 years of the Christian era, population
numbers were virtually stationary. Through
epidemics, nature compensated for excess
births by excess deaths.
I talked about this problem with the
director of the Egyptian Academy of Sciences.
He told me that scientists were appalled to
think that by the year 2080 the population of
Egypt might reach 250 million.
What should we do to eliminate suffering
and disease? It's a wonderful idea but perhaps
not altogether a beneficial one in the long run.
If we try to implement it we may jeopardize
the future of our species.
It's terrible to have to say this. World
population must be stabilized and to do that
we must eliminate 350,000 people per day.
This is so horrible to contemplate that we
shouldn't even say it. But the general situa¬
tion in which we are involved is lamentable.
And yet solutions must exist. . . .
It's a question of cost. We need $400 billion
a year for fifteen years. To provide people with
safe drinking water. To provide schooling
for girls and low pensions for the elderly.
With $4 billion over fifteen years we can not
only reduce demographic pressure but halt
population growth.
Is there anything we can do to control
industrial pollution?
Not much. Carbon dioxide is the big
problem. We are going to suffocate because
of carbon dioxide. As you know, it stimulates
breathing, and we shall all end up panting to
death if amounts of carbon dioxide continue
to increase. This increase is the result of a mis¬
guided energy policy. What's more, we have
preferred to invest enormous sums in nuclear
energy produced by fission rather than by
fusion, which is clean. But nuclear energy
produced by fusion makes it possible to have
the bomb!
There are other, more "picturesque"
forms of pollution. Planet Earth is now sur¬
rounded by a girdle of fragments of broken
satellites which move at the speed of a bullet
and will eventually prevent any attempt to
reach outer space.
To manage nature a certain amount of
wisdom is needed. Perhaps one day, taking
long-term factors into account, we shall suc¬
ceed in managing nature as we now do when
we create a pretty garden. But let's get back
to the mosquitoes. For the last ten years I have
owned a house in the country. When I first
went there, there were swallows, robins and
Jacques-Yves Cousteau
in Papua New Guinea.
mosquitoes. Today the mosquitoes have gone,
but so have the swallows, the grasshoppers and
the butterflies. The crops have been sprayed
with pesticides from the air, and so the insects
have been almost totally wiped out. If we
carry on like this, children will never see a
swallow, a dragonfly or a butterfly. Well done!
Perhaps you couldfind a more hopeful note
on which to end this conversation?
Real interest in environmental problems
began in 1988 when the American magazine
Time featured planet Earth on its cover, and
titled it "Planet of the Year" instead of its
usual "man of the year".
In July 1989, the leaders of the seven great
industrial nations devoted a third of the time
at their annual summit and twenty-three pages
of the report to environmental problems.
Later a meeting was held at The Hague and
there were others too. At long last people were
realizing that the danger was global and that
everyone was threatened.
This realization on the part of world
leaders has been encouraged by powerful pres¬
sure from public opinion all over the world.
The combination of these two forces, at the
top and at the grassroots, should lead to the
beginning of a solution. I hope that this is a
sufficiently hopeful note on which to conclude!

live centuries ago, the discovery of the New World proved that the Earth is round. And
therefore finite. Paradoxically, the Immense extent of the lands thus revealed enabled human
beings to persist until our own times in the mistaken belief that the wealth of nature was
inexhaustible and that they could continue with impunity to increase their numbers and multiply
their needs indefinitely.
The truth is that the Earth's resources are still considerable, but the race is on between
these needsvital or superfluousand the means of satisfying them. In spite of scientific
breakthroughs and the wonders of technology we are far from sure of winning this race. The
rampant population growth that is still going on, especially in the poor countries, and the
frenetic consumption of material goods and energy, especially in the rich countries, combine in
a model of economic development which weighs too heavily on all the components of our
environment and is not "sustainable".
This issue of the Courier, by seeking to provide some insights Into the manifestations of
this environmental crisis, shows that the latter is equally a crisis of development. Environment
and development: the two faces of a single dilemma In the pursuit of human destiny, the
subject of the United Nations Conference which will be held at Rio de Janeiro in June 1992.
This is a subject UNESCO knows well and one with which it has been concerned since Its
Inception. It was under UNESCO's auspices that the International Union for the Conservation of
Nature was founded in 1948. Around the same time UNESCO launched a scientific programme
for the study and use of arid regions. In 1961 the Intergovernmental Océanographie
Commission was established in UNESCO in order to promote worldwide co-operation in the
study of the seas, their resources, their protection and their influence on the life of the planet.
At the same time study was organized on the Earth's crust, its wealth and the natural hazards
associated with ¡t In 1964 the International Hydrologlcal Decade was launched to further
knowledge and management of the water resources of all countries. Finally, in 1968, UNESCO
organized a conference on the rational use and conservation of the resources of the biosphere,
from which sprang the interdisciplinary programme on Man and the Biosphere (MAB) which ¡s
today at the centre of UNESCO activities related to the environment.
In 1972 the United Nations Conference at Stockholm created a new wave of interest in
environmental questions, both in public opinion and in governments, encouraging UNESCO to
persevere with its International scientific programmes. It also Invited UNESCO to promote and
strengthen environmental education in schools and universities. At the same time, the adoption
of the Convention on the Protection of the World Cultural and Natural Heritage affirmed the dual
nature of our common heritage and the indispensablllty of International co-operation in
conserving the great symbols of this heritage.
UNESCO has thus long been a place of convergence for all those approaches which
attempt, through education, science and culture, to reconcile development and environment,
and to restore the original partnership between man and nature.
However, the efforts made so far, both at the national and the international level, have
proved less than adequate. The enterprise will need time to bear fruit. It calls for a thorough
revision of ways of thinking and economic mechanisms which are deeply entrenched in the
industrialized countries and more or less accepted as models in the others, as well as a radical
change in habits and attitudes which will be felt by many as a sacrifice. It prescribes that short-
term preoccupations should no longer obstruct long-term Imperatives, and involves taking as
precautionary measures unpopular decisions which are not based on absolute certainties. It calls
for the reshaping of over-compartmentalized institutions and far-reaching changes In investment
priorities. It means the rich countries agreeing to increase their aid to the poor countries for
taking the environment into account (what is known as "additionality"), and the latter agreeing
in exchange to change the direction of certain development projects to protect the environment
(the principle of "condltionallty"). It requires the adoption of a new form of economic
accountancy which takes into account hitherto Ignored values such as pure air, clean water, wild
animals and landscapes. It requires that each of us should realize what is at stake, examine our
behaviour and set an example. Without delay. Dust-storm in Ethiopia.

The citizen and trie environment
by Claude Villeneuve
What the individual can do to help maintain
the planet's life-support systems
*c£T
16
Ahe scientific community today produces a
flow of reports, hypotheses and observations
which show that our constant assaults on the
environment are jeopardizing the world's poten¬
tial for development. It is even said that the sur¬
vival of the human race is threatened. Faced with
these planetary problems, it is hard for the ordi¬
nary citizen not to feel in the presence of the Four
Horsemen of the Apocalypse.
We are starting to feel the effects of the by¬
products of the very same technologies that have
enabled us to increase our lifespan and improve
our quality of life. Both the causes and the victims
of environmental degradation, we are learning
with amazement that we live in an increasingly
complex and fragile world.
The transformations we have imposed on the
biosphere are so far-reaching that immediate
action must be taken to prevent their catastrophic
effects from posing insoluble problems for the
next generation. What can ordinary people do in
the course of their daily lives to help solve these
problems instead of making matters worse?
WHAT IS SUSTAINABLE
DEVELOPMENT?
Many environmental problems are becoming
increasingly global in scale, transcending frontiers
and national jurisdictions and eluding the respon¬
sibility of individuals and nations.
Today's technologies are far more advanced
than those of a few decades ago, but we are get¬
ting dangerously close to the limits of technolog¬
ical efficiency. Greater and greater efforts are
required to make relatively insignificant progress,
both in the production of goods and in the fight
against pollution.
Furthermore, world population is rapidly
increasing, and under the influence of the mass
media consumer expectations are getting much
higher. Although the resources of the biosphere
still have considerable potential for development,
the limits of its productivity will be reached in
the foreseeable future.
Sustainable development is based on respon¬
sible management of resources so that the
interests of future generations are protected while
current needs are met. This is a stimulating
challenge both for individuals and communities
and it must be accepted immediately, for the
longer the necessary decisions are put off, the
harder they become.
BUILT-IN OBSOLESCENCE
The spectacular increase in industrial production
that followed the Second World War improved
living conditions around the world but also
whetted appetites for material goods of all kinds.
Industry provided a mass market with manufac¬
tured products at affordable prices. More and
more goods were turned out at lower and lower
prices, creating jobs and enabling people to buy
more. Supply encouraged demand.
This situation could not last for ever. To sus¬
tain demand, products had obsolescence built into
them. Advertising and marketing techniques that
associated such goods with an image of happiness
proved exceptionally successful. Unfortunately,

however, accumulation of possessions does not
guarantee contentment, nor is it an end in itself.
On the other hand, the production of goods
that are not intended to last is a waste of energy
and natural resources, and creates volumes of
waste that are harmful to the environment. Every
American citizen, for example, throws away a ton
of domestic garbage each year. In highly deve¬
loped consumer societies, this refuse, which con¬
sists mainly of useless packaging, constitutes one
of today's most critical environmental problems.
It is perhaps in the handling of domestic
waste that the individual can be most effective
in the struggle against environmental degradation.
By choosing products that are either less pack¬
aged or less polluting, he or she can influence the
attitudes of industry.
Cars are among the most important of the
ephemeral products of the consumer society, and
many environmental problems are linked to their
excessive production and use. In North America,
for example, it is estimated that they account for
nearly 40 per cent of total energy consumption.
Using the car less is one of the first suggestions
^A-T
to make to the citizen to reduce pressure on the
environment.
World population is currently growing at the
rate of 170 persons a minute, the equivalent of
the population of Canada every three months.
Environmentalists are alarmed by the increase,
and with good reason.
First of all there is an ethical obligation to
feed, clothe and house all these new citizens of
the world. At present we do this rather badly,
because of inequalities in the distribution of
natural resources. Second, everyone in the plane¬
tary village wants to enjoy the benefits of the con¬
sumer societies of the industrialized world.
Unfortunately, in the present state of ecological
knowledge, high North American and European
levels of consumption of natural resources do not
seem accessible to everyone in the world.
Many writers, including the French
agronomist René Dumont, point out that for all
the planet to consume energy at North American
rates, we should have to increase oil production
threefold, natural gas production sevenfold, and
coal output tenfold, as well as multiplying the

current number of nuclear power plants by sixty.
This prospect, which would cause us to revise
estimates of how long reserves of fossil fuels will
last, is terrifying from an environmental point of
view. The pollution caused by the production and
use of the necessary energy resources would
increase amounts of acid rain, greenhouse gases
and nuclear wastes to intolerable levels.
Yet every human being ought to have the
right to live in comfort and security. Sustainable
development therefore involves reducing birth¬
rates, where these are high, both in rich and poor
countries.
Controlling the birth-rate is first and fore¬
most a matter for individuals, but it must also
be supported by society as a whole, and the com¬
munity should invest in the education and wel¬
fare of children who have already been born
before encouraging parents to bring others into
the world.
THE CHALLENGE
OF ENVIRONMENTAL
LITERACY
Finally, an unprecedented effort must be made
at local, regional and global levels to teach people
about the environment so that all the citizens of
the world can assume the responsibilities incum¬
bent on them in maintaining the planet's life-
support systems.
The fact is that we are all educated
ignoramuses. Instead of the well-formed mind
praised by the essayist Michel de Montaigne, most
educational systems, under the constraints of
competition, turn out well-stuffed brains. Our
knowledge is increasingly specialized and frag¬
mented among individuals who may be compe¬
tent in one field but are virtually ignorant in
others. Most of today's decision-makers are
produced by educational systems that leave little
space for extra-curricular discovery. Citizens too
know little of the processes that provide them
with the means to survive.
Yet informed action on environmental
matters demands at least some basic knowledge
of the way in which ecosystems work and an
awareness of man's place in the biosphere.
Environmental education is one of the keys to
sustainable development. A pathway to environ¬
mental literacy, it is also the vector of the new
ethic needed to redefine the relationship between
humankind and the biosphere.
Environmental education must therefore be
made generally available in schools and other
educational institutions, so that citizens and offi¬
cials can introduce an ecological dimension into
decision-making.
It must start with the fact that there are limits
to the capacity of the biosphere, and that human
actions can alter it both at the local and the global
levels in ways that are harmful to our health and
safety. Teachers must also point out that the
development of every human being depends on
the state of his or her environment, and that no
generation can arrogate to itself the right to des¬
troy elements necessary for the survival of the
next.
The challenge of sustainable development
may well be the most important we have ever
had to face. We now have extraordinary scien¬
tific instruments for predicting the evolution of
the environment. Will we be wise enough to
avoid catastrophe while continuing to improve
the quality of life for humankind as a whole? Or
will we be led to crisis by economic models that
encourage us to believe that the infinite exists in
a finite world?
These are questions science cannot answer.
It is up to each of us to take up the cause.

RirVanda; land of a thousand Ms
How a small country in the heart of Africa is safeguarding
the natural capital on which its survival depends
S ITUATED in the heart of Africa, Rwanda is a
relatively small country (26,338 square
kilometres), yet with nearly eight million inhabi¬
tants it has the highest population density of any
nation in Africa south of the Sahara.
The relief of the land is uneven. A chain of
volcanoes in the north gives way in the east and
south to wooded savannah and plateaux dotted
with innumerable hills. The west is dominated
by the Zaire-Nile watershed, a group of rugged
mountain ranges dissected by deep valleys. It is
hardly surprising that Rwanda is known as the
land of a thousand hills.
Demographic pressure, the smallness of the
country and the growing scarcity of land com¬
bine with a shortage of natural resources and a
land-locked position to make Rwanda a test-case
for all the knottiest problems of sustainable
development. The principal objectives of this
largely agricultural country have always been to
achieve self-sufficiency in food while also creating
jobs and wealth by encouraging the production
of goods to increase national purchasing power.
THE ENVIRONMENT:
A NATIONAL
PREOCCUPATION
Even though Rwanda lives under the constant
threat of food shortages, more than 10 per cent
of its territory is given over to nature reserves
of great importance. These include the Virunga
National Park in the north of the country, the
home of the last mountain gorillas, and in the
south the Nyungwe Forest, which besides
providing a habitat for certain rare species of
monkey is also the largest stretch of high primary
forest left in Africa and now one of the last.
Protecting these reserves is vital for Rwanda's
ecological and hydrological balance, as well as for
the biological diversity of its ecosystems. But a
policy of conservation can also be justified
economically in terms of the potential it creates
for an intelligently-run tourist industry that will
not harm the nation's extraordinary flora and
fauna. 19

As a result of the soaring population, the
borders of the reserves are being steadily
infiltrated by poachers and people seeking food.
Measures envisaged to protect the ecological
heritage include plans to create natural barriers
of vegetation as well as to increase research,
improve surveillance and launch publicity cam¬
paigns to make people aware of the need to
preserve areas vital to the nation's ecological
survival.
Big efforts are being made to improve and
restore the ecological heritage. A reforestation
campaign launched over twenty-five years ago
won widespread popular support and has been
an undeniable success. Since 1973 a National Tree
Day, marked by plantings across the country, has
also reflected the need for a reforestation strategy.
The planting of new forests has provided Rwanda
with an important renewable resource, supplying
the materials for a timber industry that, although
still small and decentralized, has great potential
for the future.
Other year-long campaigns have also been
launched in support of agriculture. There has
been a Soil Conservation Year, an Organic
Manure Year, a Year of the Struggle against
Erosionall of them aimed at boosting efforts to
achieve self-sufficiency in food.
THE THREAT
TO AGRICULTURE
The agricultural sector, which employs 93 per
cent of the working population, consists
primarily of highly productive smallholdings,
three-quarters of which are less than one and a
half hectares. Rwanda has neither large estates nor
the rural proletariat that goes with them, and
most agricultural products, even the so-called
industrially produced commodities such as coffee,
tea and pyrethrum, are grown on these small
family properties. One side-effect of this is that
income in the rural areas is relatively evenly dis¬
tributed.
Until quite recently, Rwanda produced
agricultural surpluses, thanks to a policy that
guaranteed minimum prices for foodstuffs, the
introduction of new plant varieties and species,
accelerated crop rotation, and a highly effective
saving and loans system.
Other factors also played a part. The climate
of Rwanda usually permits two and sometimes
even three harvests a year. The country is socially
and linguistically homogeneous, and has no
geopolitical commitments to distract it from the
problems of its own survival. There are no
natural resources to attract speculation. The
farming population firmly resists any threats to
its livelihood, while not being averse to innova¬
tion. Politically, the nation is enviably stable.
Unfortunately, however, in the last few years
things have taken a turn for the worse. Acceler¬
ating population growth is partly responsible, but
a growing number of external factors have also
been to blame.
Unusual weather conditions, including
drought and torrential rain, have exposed the fra¬
gility of Rwanda's overburdened agricultural
system, which now seemingly exploits every
square metre of available land. Disaster is never
far away. Overintensive farming and the lack of
new land are the principal constraints that, under
the pressure of an expanding population, have
pushed Rwandese agriculture towards breaking-
point. Several parts of the country suffered food
shortages in 1989.
One of Rwanda's advantages has actually
become a handicap. The widespread dispersal of
the population, which helped save the country
from rampant urbanization and the proliferation
of shanty-towns, is now synonymous with waste.
Sub-divided into ever tinier plots as a result of
the prevailing system of inheritance, the small¬
holdings have become too small to produce
reasonably large surpluses. Systematic over¬
cropping has reduced soil fertility, which had
previously remained high thanks to a carefully
supervised system of fallowing. Worse still, suc¬
cessive falls in the price of coffeethe nation's
principal export crop, providing the foreign cur¬
rency needed to pay for importshave reduced

the country's purchasing power and deprived it
of the means to maintain its level of economic
activity and modernize its agriculture.
NEW ECOLOGICAL
IMPERATIVES
Without an effective demographic policy that
would combine family planning with a
programme to optimize land use, the existing
system may eventually break down. In any case,
will it be possible to increase agricultural produc¬
tion substantially and permanently without
harming the environment?
Various factors could help. New chemical fer¬
tilizers and other products must be introduced
to replace essential minerals the soil has lost.
Liming will be a priority, since Rwanda possesses
important lime deposits. The import of inorganic
fertilizers is a recent innovation, and remarkable
efforts are being made to optimize their use,
notably by applying them in conjunction with
organic manure.
Rwanda's only unused land consists of
marshes which play a fundamental role in
regulating the country's hydrological system.
Developing this marshland will pose complex
technological, social, economic and institutional
problems, but it offers the prospect of substan¬
tially increasing food supplies without harming
the environment.
The fact that half Rwanda's agricultural land
slopes at an angle of 25 degrees or more raises a
particularly serious problem. The most widely
used techniques of soil conservation, such as
planting hedges or digging ditches to counter ero¬
sion, do not work on terrain where the angle of
declivity exceeds 21 degrees. Consequently much
hope and enthusiasm have been invested in a new
system of "radical" terracing whereby the slopes
are transformed into horizontal platforms which

slope slightly against the hillside and thus inter¬
cept drainage water and encourage it to soak into
the soil. This reduces and in some cases even
eliminates land-loss and provides crops with max¬
imal nutrition.
Besides rehabilitating land that was previ¬
ously either badly eroded, under-exploited or
even regarded as unusable, the terraces also main¬
tain soil fertility. Consequently, agricultural
output rises almost immediately. A property at
Kisaro that formerly produced one ton of
potatoes yielded a bumper crop of 25 tons after
terracing. Plots where wheat would not grow
now yield two tons per hectare. These cases may
be exceptional, but there is general agreement that
terracing on average doubles the harvest without
diminishing the precious natural capital of the
soil.

INDUSTRIALIZATION
Bringing industry to Rwanda constitutes a real
challenge, in view of the fragility of the environ¬
ment, which could be disastrously affected by cer¬
tain kinds of pollution. Even so, industrialization
is a priority, not just to add value to the nation's
resources by turning them into finished products
but also to absorb the surplus labour of the rural
areas and to create additional purchasing power
to buy the foodstuffs and other commodities
produced there. Even so, it has taken consider¬
able inventiveness to identify genuinely
promising opportunities.
Because importing raw materials for manufac¬
ture is prohibitively expensive for this land¬
locked country, priority has been given to small
and medium-sized enterprises that are considered
ecologically safe, such as timber and agro¬
business.
Other industries are also concerned with the
need to safeguard the environment. The Ruliba
brickworks at Kigali uses dried papyrus reed and
coffee-bean casings as fuel. Rwanda will soon be
producing corrugated sheets of tarred papyrus to
serve as roofing. Not only will these last longer
than imported tiles, they also consume a locally
grown raw material that is indefinitely renewable,
and will thus save a considerable amount of for¬
eign currency. Rwanda's national brewery uses
methane gas from Lake Kivu as its energy source.
Other industries, notably cement manufacture,
are expected to follow suit.
Can Rwanda be described as a success-story
of sustainable development? It is still too early
to say. But the country is moving in the right
direction by seeking the tools of development in
its own environment and ensuring that its natural
££ capital remains entirely in its own hands.
íM$ for a sustainable world
)si José Gofdembeig
The search for new energy sources to replace
exhaustible and environmentally harmful fossil fuels
A HE concept of sustainability is a highly com¬
plex one, particularly where energy matters are
concerned. We can only hope to approach any¬
thing like absolute sustainability by the use of
renewable energy resources such as hydro-
electricity; but even hydro-electricity involves
problems such as the silting up of dams or the
secondary environmental damage dams can cause,
which makes it less than a hundred per cent sus¬
tainable.
On the other hand, some fossil fuels, such as
coal, are quite abundant and even at their present
rate of consumption will last for several centu¬
ries, when other sources of energy might become
available.
The Report of the World Commission on
Environment and Development (1987) defined
sustainable development as development that
"meets the needs of the present without com¬
promising the ability of future generations to
meet their own needs". And this, perhaps, con¬
tains the hint that we need to introduce the
notion of "depletion rates" into any discussion
of sustainability. This opens the way to the estab¬
lishment of compromises between what is
desirable in principle and what is practical in
terms of the realities of everyday life. Such com¬
promises are unavoidable when a choice has to
be made between preserving resources and the
needs of survival and development.
If energy use were to be considered in con¬
formity with the strict definition of sustainable
development, this would mean that man should
rely exclusively on renewable sources of energy.
This was the case before the industrial revolution,
when fuelwood, used in a renewable fashion, was
basically the only source of energy.
With population growth and increased
demand for energy, however, exhaustible fossil
fuels came into use and became the predominant
energy source. In the industrialized countries
today, fuelwood represents less than one per cent
of total energy consumption, the remaining
demand being met basically by fossil fuelscoal,
oil and gas.

This is clearly an unsustainable form of
development, since the depletion of existing
reserves of fossil fuels is proceeding at a fast pace
and will certainly "compromise the ability of
future generations to meet their own [energy]
needs."
Depletion, and eventual exhaustion, of stocks
of fossil fuels are not the only problems. Their
use entails other problems which affect the sus¬
tainability of the system in which we livethe
emission of carbon dioxide and other gases is the
major cause of atmospheric pollution and global
warming and thus poses a threat to the way of
life of future generations.
In the less developed countries, fuelwood still
represents an appreciable fraction of total energy
consumption. If this resource were properly
managed, by the systematic planting of trees to
replace those cut down, it could become an inex¬
haustible energy source. This is far from being
the case and we are witnessing intensive deforesta¬
tion which is consuming more than ten million
hectares of forestmainly tropical forestevery
year. The problem is most acute in Africa, but
is also very significant in south-east Asia and Latin
America.
On a worldwide scale, only hydro-electricity
can today be considered a sustainable energy
resourceit cannot be depleted and it does not
11 HM*
II
produce greenhouse gases. However, only ten per
cent of the total energy used in the world comes
from this source and, although the potential of
existing untapped sites is considerable, they are
unevenly distributed around the world.
Three approaches can be adopted to attain
energy sustainability:
extend the life of existing fossil fuels as much
as possible by wise use;
increase the use of other, little-used renewable
energy sources such as wind power, solar thermal
power, solar thermo-electric power, photovol-
taics and biomass;
increase the use of nuclear power.
Before the two oil crises of the 1970s, growth
in energy consumption, based on the use of fossil
fuels, seemed to be part of the way of life of deve¬
loped countries and an example to be copied and
a goal to be attained by all. The projection of
future energy consumption reflected those expec¬
tations and predicted a sustained growth of at least
three per cent a year, which meant that total
energy consumed would quadruple in less than
fifty years.
The two oil crises led to a re-examination of
the situation and to moves to reduce what was
seen as a dangerous over-reliance on oil. Two
major energy studies were conducted during the
1970sone by the Energy Research Group,
The dam at the Tucurui hydro¬
electric power station on

Cambridge, England, for the World Energy Con¬
ference, the other by the International Institute
for Applied Systems Analysis, Vienna. Both
studies had one long-term objective in
commonto shift from oil to more abundant
energy resources such as natural gas, coal and
nuclear energy while maintaining a significant
growth in energy consumption.
Their approach was to estimate future energy
demand on the basis of assumptions about future
demographic and economic trends, to make
historical correlations between such trends and
energy demand, and to match this demand to
a new mix of energy supplies. However, the
scenarios they produced had the defect of
projecting a perpetuation of the energy consump¬
tion imbalance between the developed and the
developing world and thus of implying contain¬
ment of the legitimate development expectations
of the less developed countries.
In 1988, in his book Energyfor a Sustainable
World, the author of this article explored the pos¬
sibilities of modern, energy-efficient technologies
for meeting the energy needs of the world popu¬
lation in the year 2020. This study concluded that
widespread use of new technologies could enable
people in the developing world to attain a level
of amenities comparable to that of the countries
of Western Europe in the middle of the 1970s and
the industrialized countries to reduce their per
capita energy consumption by almost half. Taken
all together he foresaw total energy consumption
in the year 2020 remaining approximately the
same as in 1980, but with a much higher level
of comfort for the great majority of the world
population.
Unfortunately, this projection did not really
correspond to a sustainable situation because
fossil fuels still represented the great majority of
the energy needed and carbon dioxide emissions
would continue to poison the atmosphere signifi¬
cantly. It did, however, demonstrate that it was
possible to stabilize energy consumption at
existing levels while extending considerably the
life of fossil fuel resources.
A more recent study by R.H. Williams, of
the Center for Energy and Environmental
Studies, Princeton University, published in 1989,
is more optimistic about the possibility of greater
use of renewable fuels which evolving technolo¬
gies seem to be making both feasible and econom¬
ically viable.
More efficient methods of using fuelwood
and of converting other biomass fuels (basically
vegetation and crop residues) into electricity
through gasification and the use of modern gas
turbine generators, are rapidly being introduced.
The conversion of sugar-cane into ethanol as an
energy source for electricity generation is gaining
ground and there are important new develop¬
ments in wind, solar thermo-power and pho-
tovoltaics.
Re-examination of all these possibilities in the
Williams study led to the conclusion that by the
year 2025 renewable energy sources could
account for more than half the energy used in
developing countries.
THE NUCLEAR
OPTION
Finally, we have to consider the possible contri¬
bution of nuclear energy to the establishment of
a sustainable world energy system. Nuclear
energy does not emit carbon dioxide and with
the development of breeder reactors sufficient
nuclear fuel for the operation of thousands of
nuclear power plants is guaranteed for centuries
to come. Here theoretically is an ideal sustainable
energy source.
The problem with nuclear energy lies else¬
where. Even with the use of the most advanced
technology, accidents do happen, as the Cher¬
nobyl disaster so tragically demonstrated. In addi¬
tion, there seems to be no solution to the problem
of disposing of radio-active waste in a manner
compatible with maintaining a "clean" environ¬
ment. These problems, coupled with the danger
of nuclear proliferation for military purposes,
. make the nuclear solution unacceptable to public
opinion in many countries.

Hungary: the pitfalls of groivtli
by István Lang Since 1990 Hungary has been trying to redress an economy
long tilted in favour of pollution-prone heavy industry
Above, a petro-chemical
works emitting pollutants at
Kazincbarcika in Hungary.
A,LT the end of World War II, Hungary found
itself politically and economically attached to the
Communist bloc. From the beginning of the
1950s, a system of central planning and manage¬
ment was gradually developed. Companies came
into State ownership, co-operative farms were
formed and most of the service sector was
brought under the control of the State or of co¬
operatives.
Quantitative growth at all costs became the
watchword of industrial production. The
development of heavy industry was given pri¬
ority, energy-intensive technologies spread and
raw materials were used with scant regard for
economy. Nevertheless, the quantitative growth
that occurred between 1950 and 1975 made it pos¬
sible to raise the standard of living and well-being
of the population as compared to the levels of
the pre-war period.
After the first oil crisis, however, the limita¬
tions of the centrally planned system, its inability
to adapt and its lack of competitiveness, soon
became apparent. Failure to modernize the infras
tructure and to introduce computer technology
meant that Hungary, like the other countries of
Eastern Europe, began increasingly to lag behind
Western Europe. The position was made even
worse by increasing external debts and the
slowing down of economic development.
This falling behind in the economic field was
matched by a delay on the part of political leaders
in East European countries, including Hungary,
in recognizing the importance of environmental
protection. Although Hungarian scientists par¬
ticipated in UNESCO's Man and the Biosphere
programme from its inception, government agen¬
cies took six to seven years to react to the
environmental challenges raised.
During the 1980s, Hungary faced growing
economic difficulties. During the decade 1977 to
1987 the country's external debt grew from $43
million to $18,957 million. Various economic
reforms were carried out and central control of
planning and management was gradually reduced,
but this was not sufficient to lead to a smoothly
functioning, market-oriented economy. So when

to 1987 he was a member of

Commission on Environment
and Development (the

the importance of environmental protection was
finally recognized, Hungary was already in a
period of economic decline and it was not pos¬
sible to make the big investment needed to
replace polluting technologies or the energy-
intensive and raw-material-intensive structure of
industry.
The period 1989-1990 saw the beginning of
radical, but peaceful, political change. In spring
1990, free elections were held and with a new
Parliament and a new government Hungary has
set out on the road to parliamentary democracy,
with a multi-party system, a market-oriented
economy and independence from military blocs.
However, the new government inherited the
old environmental problems and it takes a long
time to change old production structures.
Nevertheless, data on the state of the environ¬
ment have been made public and municipalities
and voluntary environmental groups are being
encouraged to play a larger part in pollution con¬
trol by means of public debates and hearings.
Preparations for the 1992 United Nations
Conference on Environment and Development
have begun. A National Commission has been
set up, and an action programme for the solution
of local and national environmental problems has
been drawn up with the aim of arousing public
awareness. A panel of high-ranking experts has
been formed with the task of working out, on
the basis of the recommendations of the Rio Con¬
ference, a Hungarian strategy for the attainment
of sustainable development.
What, then, is the present position in key
policy sectors and what changes can be expected?
ENERGY POLICY
Energy policy is a key issue in the Hungarian
debate on environmental protection. For decades,
energy has been wasted on a vast scale in Eastern
Europe, including Hungary. Owing to the use of
out-of-date technologies, energy consumption per
unit of product (e.g. per ton of steel or per ton
of wheat) is on average 40 to 50 per cent higher
than in the Western European countries and the
proportion of energy-intensive sectors within
industry is high. Energy consumption per capita,
for example, in Austria and Hungary is practi¬
cally the same, but, in relation to Gross National
Product, Hungary consumes five times as much
energy as Austria.
Energy policy for the future has two main
objectives: to increase the efficient use of energy
and to reduce dependence on external sources of
energy. At present there is intense public debate
as to whether or not a second nuclear power plant
should be built, and if not, on what primary fuel
additional electrical energy will be based. This is
a matter of great public concern because,
although technological reconstruction of some
existing power plants has led to some improve¬
ment with regard to the emission of pollutants,
44 per cent of the population live in areas where,
at certain times of the year, the quality of the air
does not meet minimum health standards.
INDUSTRY
Transition to sustainable industrial development
and to market mechanisms entails considerable
economic and social change. One example of this
is that the previously established principle that
"the polluter pays" seems to be being replaced
by the new principle that "the polluter pays and
the consumer pays". Another is that because of
rising prices of raw materials and energy, coupled
with decreasing government support, heavy
industry is in crisis, with the unfortunate social
consequence that unemployment has increased to
an unprecedented degree. Paradoxically this is also
an environmentally favourable phenomenon, since
it means a decline in a sector of industrial activity
which pollutes the environment the most.
Privatization of Hungarian companies has
begun, mainly with the help of foreign capital.
This will have a positive effect on the moderni¬
zation of technological processes and thus will
benefit the environment. Some environmen¬
talists, however, are worried about this, since they
fear that polluting processes that are no longer
permitted in the European Community countries
will be transferred to Hungary. It is the gener¬
ally accepted opinion in Hungary that industrial
development must be judged on the basis of Euro¬
pean norms.
AGRICULTURE
Hungary's climate and soil are suitable for inten¬
sive agricultural production. In the 1980s, two-
thirds of the country's agricultural produce was
sold on the internal market, ensuring an ample
]]>

<page number="27">
<![CDATA[
food supply (exceptional in Eastern Europe),
while one third was exported. However, inten¬
sive soil cultivation and the use of large amounts
of artificial fertilizers and pesticides, as well as
concentrated animal husbandry, have led to some
degradation of the environment. Damage caused
by wind and water erosion affects some 40 per
cent of the land, a significant part of the ground¬
water contains an excess of nitrates, acidification
of the soil can be observed on one third of the
arable land and, as a result of irrigation, saliniza-
tion has developed in many areas.
Privatization of the land has begun and there
will be considerable decentralization in both land
use and animal husbandry in the coming years.
On the whole this is expected to have favourable
environmental effects, but problems may arise in
ensuring the proper use of agro-chemicals.
When Hungary joins the European Commu¬
nity (this is thought likely to occur in the second
half of the 1990s), Hungarian agricultural exports
will probably decrease. This will make it possible
to shape the model of a low-energy-input
agriculture.
TRANSPORT
Transport is one of the biggest sources of pollution
in Hungary. Some 45 to 50 per cent of the carbon
monoxide, 40 to 45 per cent of the nitrogen
oxides and 90 per cent of the lead emitted into
the air come from transport. Road transport has
the greatest share in this emission with more than
85 per cent, the railways being responsible for 12
to 13 per cent and air transport for one to two
per cent. The development of the means of mass
transport is being given priority in the plans of
both national and municipal authorities.
NATURE CONSERVATION
Some 626 hectares of Hungary's total territory
of 93,000 square kilometres are protected.
Altogether there are four national parks, 44 pro¬
tected regions and 137 nature conservation areas.
All the 2,500 caves, 415 plant species and 619
animal species are protected. In addition there are
877 locally protected areas.
The national parks have been established
partly in forest areas and partly in lands which
are very valuable for nature conservation but not
easily usable for agriculture. Some problems have
arisen because the national parks are not all fully
owned by the State authorities responsible for
conservation. With the privatization of land, this
problem is growing more acute. The general
trend, however, is for protected nature conser¬
vation areas to remain under State ownership and
for their exploitation (for logging, grazing,
fishing, etc.) to be fully controlled by the nature
conservation service.
As can be seen from this short review, Hun¬
gary has inherited an onerous legacy from earlier
regimes. Under new circumstances the intention
is to adopt new methods to achieve sustainable
development. Environment and development
will figure jointly in the government's
programme and an environmentally aware public
will be there to encourage action and to ensure
that the proper decisions are made.

R
JL/UILDING a more environmentally stable future
clearly requires some vision of that future. If not
fossil fuels to power society, then what? If forests
are no longer to be cleared to grow food, then
how is a larger population to be fed? If a
throwaway culture leads inevitably to pollution
and resource depletion, how can we satisfy our
material needs? In sum, if the present path is so
obviously unsound, what picture of the future
can we use to guide our actions towards a global
community that can endure?
A sustainable society is one that satisfies its
needs without jeopardizing the prospects of
future generations. Unfortunately there are no
existing models of sustainability. For the past
several decades, most developing nations have
aspired to the automobile-centred, fossil fuel-
,. , . , driven economies of the industrial West. But

eqmppe wi so ar ce s lution to the global threat of climate change, it

lighting. is now clear that these societies are far from
28
durable; indeed they are rapidly bringing about
their own demise.
If the world is to achieve sustainability, this
will have to be done within the next forty years.
If we have not succeeded by then, environmental
deterioration and economic decline are likely to
be feeding on each other, pulling us into a down¬
ward spiral of social disintegration. Our vision
of the future therefore looks to the year 2030.
One assumption we make about the future
concerns population size. Current United
Nations projections have the world headed for
nearly nine billion people by the year 2030. This
figure implies a doubling or tripling of the popu¬
lations of Ethiopia, India, Nigeria and scores of
other countries where human numbers are
already over-taxing natural support systems. We,
however, assume a population of at most eight
billion that will either be essentially stable or
slowly declining towards a number the Earth can
support comfortably and indefinitely. Either soci¬
eties will move quickly to encourage smaller fami¬
lies and bring birth-rates down, or rising death-
rates from hunger and malnutrition will check
population growth.
The humane path to sustainability by the

year 2030 therefore requires a dramatic drop in
birth-rates. More countries will do as China and,
most recently, Thailand have donecut their
population growth rates by half in a matter of
years. As of 1990, thirteen European countries
have stable or declining populations; by 2030,
most countries are likely to be in that category.
THE DAWN
OF THE SOLAR AGE
The world of 2030 will not be powered by coal,
oil and natural gas. It is now well accepted that
continuing heavy reliance on fossil fuels will cause
catastrophic changes in climate. Avoiding this and
eventually stabilizing the climate depend on cut¬
ting global carbon emissions to two billion tons,
about one third of the current amount. Given
projected population growth, the world in 2030
will therefore have per capita carbon emissions
that are one-eighth of the level of those in Western
Europe today.
The choice then becomes whether to make
solar or nuclear power the centrepiece of energy
systems. We believe societies will reject nuclear
power because of its long list of economic, social
and environmental liabilities.
The late twentieth century is the dawn of the
solar age. When it comes to solar technologies,
today's political leaders, still captivated by coal
and nuclear power, are like those who in the
eighteenth century were sceptical about the
future of the steam engine. The glimmerings of
the new age are already giving the lie to such
sceptics. Some nationsNorway and Brazil, for
examplealready obtain over half their energy
from renewable energy resources. And these
resources are available in immense quantity. The
United States Department of Energy estimates
that the annual influx of currently accessible
renewable resources in the United States is 250
times the country's annual use of energy.
Solar power is by nature diverse; the mix of
energy sources will reflect the climate and natural
resources of each particular region. Northern
Europe, for example, is likely to rely heavily on
wind and hydropower. The economies of
northern Africa and the Middle East may instead
use direct sunlight. Japan and the Philippines will
tap their abundant geothermal energy. And
Southeast Asian economies will be powered
largely by wood and agricultural wastes, along
with sunshine.
Due to the abundance of sunlight, direct con¬
version of solar energy will be the corner-stone

is sunshine available in great quantity, it is also
more widely distributed than any other renew¬

processes involved in solar thermal conversion.
As they become economical, the completion
of the solar revolution will be possible. All
Third World villages could be electrified with
this renewable source, with battery storage
for lighting and other uses in the dark evening
hours.
Wind power is an indirect form of solar
energy, generated by the Sun's differential heating
of the Earth's atmosphere. The cost of wind
energy fell by about 70 per cent during the 1980s,
making it at least 40 per cent cheaper than power
from new nuclear plants in the United States and
almost competitive with energy from new coal-
fired power plants.
Engineers are confident that they will soon
have improved wind turbines that are economical
not just in California's blustery mountain passes,
where some wind farmers are already generating
$30,000 worth of electricity per hectare annually,
but also in vast stretches of the US northern
plains, on the North Sea coast of the United
Kingdom and in central Europe. Among the
other regions where major wind farm projects are
now on the drawing boards are Germany and the
State of Gujarat, in India.
For hydropower, which now supplies 19 per
cent of the world's electricity, prospects for
future growth are most promising in the Third
World, where the undeveloped potential is still
large. Small-scale projects are likely to be more
appealing than the massive projects favoured by
governments and international lending agencies
in recent decades.

ENERGY FROM PLANTS
Plants provide another means of capturing solar
energy. Through photosynthesis they convert
sunlight into biomass that can be burned. Until
the industrial revolution, wood supplied most of
the world's energy. Today it still provides 12 per
cent of the total, chiefly in the form of firewood
and charcoal in developing countries.
One promising approach to augmenting
biomass energy capacity is to grow energy crops
on marginal lands not currently used for food.
Land that is too steeply sloping or not sufficiently
fertile or well watered for crops might support
trees that could be harvested periodically. The
wood could then be burned directly in a wood-
fired power plant or converted to ethanol. The
Solar Energy Research Institute has already deve¬
loped a process that brings the cost of wood-
derived ethanol down to $1.35 per gallon.
Virtually all Pacific rim countries, as well as
those along East Africa's Great Rift and the
Mediterranean Sea, are well endowed with
geothermal energy. Iceland, Indonesia and Japan
are among the nations with the greatest poten¬
tial. Geothermal energy can provide not only
electricity that can be transmitted over long dis¬
tances, but also direct heat for industries sited near
the Earth's major heat reservoirs.
Getting global carbon emissions down to two
billion tons a year requires vast improvements
in energy efficiency. Fortunately, many of the
technologies to accomplish such reductions are
already at hand and cost-effective. No technical
breakthroughs are needed, for example, to double
automobile fuel economy, triple the efficiency of
lighting systems, or cut typical heating loads by
75 per cent. Technologies developed in the
decades ahead will undoubtedly allow even
greater gains.
By the year 2030, a much more diverse set
of transportation options will exist. The typical
European or Japanese city today is probably
fairly indicative of this future. Highly developed
rail and bus systems move people efficiently
between home and work. In Tokyo, only 15 per
cent of commuters drive cars to the office.
Automobiles will undoubtedly still be in use
four decades from now, but they will be fewer
in number and their role will be smaller. Within
cities, only clean hydrogen-powered vehicles are
likely to be permitted and most of these will be
highly efficient "city cars". The energy to run
them may well come from solar power plants.
Families might rent efficient larger vehicles for
vacations.
The bicycle will also play a major role, as it
already does in much of Asia and in some
industrial-country towns and cities. There are
already twice as many bicycles as cars worldwide.
In the bicycle-centred transport system of the
year 2030, the ratio could easily be as high as ten
to one. _

Lany people in the industrialized countries
would like Amazonia to be preserved exactly as it
is, and transform it. into a vast nature reserve.
Some of these advocates of the non-
development of Amazonia attach the highest pri¬
ority to safeguarding planet Earth and at the same
time contrive to regard human beings as parasites.
Others point out that the Amazonian forest plays
a major role in counteracting the greenhouse
effect, and wish to see it act as a gigantic filter
so that 500 million cars can continue to consume
fossil fuels.
THE CURRENT
CONTEXT
The non-development of Amazonia is totally
unacceptable both to the people who live in the
region and to Brazilians in general. The gratui¬
tous advice handed out to the people on the spot
may well be seen as a kind of ecological
colonialism as long as the industrialized countries
of the North refuse to change their ways of life
and patterns of consumption.
Let these countries prove their sincerity by
proposing to the United Nations Conference on
Environment and Development a specific
programme for the reduction of energy consump¬
tion in industrial societies.
Let them also provide the countries of the
South with access to the scientific and technical
knowledge that is needed to develop the immense
biological heritage of the Amazonian forest
within a framework of sound ecological prin¬
ciples. For this long-term task, Brazil and the
other countries of Amazonia need the capacity
to carry out their own in situ research.
For tropical countries biotechnology opens
up considerable possibilities based on progress in
the production of biomass and the range of
products that can be derived from it. Eventually
we may see the emergence of a new "plant-based
industrial civilization", a particularly interesting
prospect for tropical countries. Mr. Monkombu

S. Swaminathan, a former President of the Inter¬
national Union for Conservation of Nature and
Natural Resources, believes that a new form of
civilization based on the sustainable use of renew¬
able resources is not only possible but essential.
The vision of this Indian scientist coincides with
the intuitions of the Brazilian sociologist Gilberto
Freyre, who in the 1960s founded a seminar on
tropicology at Recife.
However, at present biotechnology seems to
be so effectively shielded by a wall of patents that
people in many developing countries are won¬
dering whether it will not become an instrument
for the recolonization of the South by the North.
The industrialized countries would provide
another token of their disinterestedness if they
were to relax their position on patents and
intellectual property rights, and establish more
open forms of access to science and technology.
In 1989 Mr. Rajiv Gandhi, then Prime
Minister of India, suggested that a 0.1 per cent
tax be levied on world revenue and its yield of
$18 billion used to establish a world fund to
finance research into environment-friendly tech¬
nologies, their purchase and their free distribu¬
tion to all interested countries. However, nothing
came of this proposal, which relaunched the
debate on the financing of environmental protec¬
tion and development.
Another possible course of action would be to
create a network linking Asian and African
researchers to Brazilians and other Latin
Americans who are seeking to harness the renew¬
able resources of humid tropical forest ecosystems
to development, a process that should harmonize
three objectives of what is known as
ecodevelopment:
the promotion of greater social justice in the
name of the ethical principle of synchronic
solidarity, with development being regarded as
a civilization based on the equitable sharing of
possessions;
self-development in harmony with nature
rather than through domination of nature, in the
name of the ethical principle of diachronic
solidarity with future generations;
the pursuit of these two goals through a search
for a kind of economic efficiency that is not res¬
tricted to a concept of business profitability
which often takes no account of ecological and
social costs.
In addition to such measures, however, inter¬
national co-operation must primarily be directed
at improving the general economic environment
of Latin American countries. In other words solu¬
tions must be found to the problems of debt,
terms of trade, and the reduction of protectionist
barriers in the industrialized countries.

The internal challenges posed by the develop¬
ment of Brazilian Amazonia are as vast as the size
of this immense area which has captured the
imagination of so many and inspired so many
exaggerations.
DREAMS
AND REALITIES
There is a golden legend which portrays
Amazonia as a region of fabulous wealth, a
mirage which has lured generations of adven¬
turers. A variant of this legend, inspired by the
philosophy of the Enlightenment and the expia¬
tory inclinations of our ethnologists, paints a pic¬
ture of noble savages living happily in perfect
harmony with nature.
There is also a black legend which describes
Amazonia as a green, impenetrable hell, protected
by tropical diseases which afflict all intruders.
These contradictory pictures are reflected in
opposing conceptions of the region's future.
Some see Amazonia as the world's last great eco¬
nomic frontier, a place of incalculable mineral,
hydraulic and plant wealth. Others believe that
the abundance of its vegetation is an illusion and
that its soils are poor and subject to erosion as
soon as the forest is felled. Haphazard exploita¬
tion of Amazonia's mineral wealth and the
growing number of big dams, combined with
chaotic colonization leading to massive deforesta¬
tion, will rapidly turn Amazonia into a desert.
What are the facts?
A precondition for successful development is
the abandonment of the dominant model of
predatory exploitation of the region's natural
resources, a model which takes no account of
social and environmental costs. The random pur¬
suit of growth is just as unacceptable as non-
development.
For twenty years or more, several factors
combined to accelerate deforestation. These
factors were:
geopolitical imperatives leading to the settling
of Amazonia along purpose-built roads;
the idea that Amazonia could absorb rural
refugees displaced by the modernization of
agriculture in southern Brazil and by the persis¬
tence of anachronistic land-ownership structures
in the northeast;
the decision to favour large-scale animal hus¬
bandry, which is quite unsuited to the natural
conditions of Amazonia and leads to frenetic
speculation in land, as well as hopes that the
region's mineral wealth could be used to alleviate
the burden of debt;
the establishment in the duty-free zone at
Manaus of a great industrial centre.
As a result of these policies, now revised,
Amazonia has lost between 300,000 and 400,000
square kilometres of forest.
There has also been rapid urbanization. Ten
million of Amazonia's 17 million population
today live in cities (Manaus and Belém each have
over 1 million inhabitants). There are many
shanty-towns which are so exposed to the risk
of epidemics that the living conditions of the
people who live in them and in the cities
undoubtedly constitute Amazonia's most acute
environmental problem today.
Outside the urban centres the population

lives in widely scattered settlements along the
banks of streams and rivers and practises a sub¬
sistence and gathering economy. The creation of
"extractive reserves" has brought a measure of
relief to the caboclos and seringueiros (peasant
farmers who tap rubber), whose existence is
threatened by land speculators. These people live
in extremely precarious conditions which could
be improved by more rational exploitation of the
forest's natural products, but this can only be
envisaged as part of a long-term solution for the
whole region. The seringueiros want their share of
economic, social and cultural progress, which
implies a dynamic vision of the transformation
of the extractive reserves into poles of
ecodevelopment.
The indigenous populations, long the victims
of adventurers and colonists, enjoy considerable
rights under the Brazilian Constitution, and the
Government has promised to earmark 80 million
hectares of land for 250,000 of them throughout
Brazil between now and 1993.
A NEW STRATEGY
The aim of Brazil's current environmental policy
is to promote a strategy of ecodevelopment rather
than a strategy of development at all costs. This
is a laudable goal, but it will not be easy to
achieve, either in Brazil or in the other Amazo¬
nian countries.
It must be accepted that ecodevelopment in
Amazonia depends on policy changes outside the
region. Land reform and reform in agricultural
policy must be carried out in the rest of Brazil in
order to reduce the flow of migrants to Amazonia.
Likewise, forest resources must be protected by
an ambitious reforestation programme elsewhere
than Amazoniathe FLORAM Plan prepared by
the Institute of Advanced Studies of the Univer¬
sity of Sâo Paulo proposes that 20 million hec¬
tares of forest be planted outside Amazonia in
thirty years, at a cost of $20 billion.
Within Amazonia, the first step is to divide
this far from homogeneous region into some
twenty sub-regions, each with its own strategy.
The global problems of Amazonia call for solu¬
tions adapted to local ecological and cultural con¬
ditions. Social diversity is a counterpart to bio¬
logical diversity.
The main thrust of these efforts must be
directed towards the rehabilitation of already
deforested land and, as far as possible, to
increasing the density of the population in these
areas, so as to halt the advancing frontier of
colonization and prevent further deforestation.
Efforts must be made to create an archipelago of
connected "development reserves" so as to
guarantee the protection of virgin forest and the
habitat of the indigenous population. Such an
approach presents many difficulties, but it still
seems more realistic than creating a proliferation
of natural reserves.
Agroforestry which makes judicious use of
local plant species (especially the enormous poten¬
tial of fruit trees), aquaculture, high-yield agricul¬
ture and horticulture in the varzeas (highly fertile
floodland), and small-scale animal husbandry are
promising techniques. Knowledge of the environ¬
ment acquired in the course of the centuries by
local populations may provide a useful starting
point, whence the importance of ethno-ecological
studies.
Technical skills based on the know-how of
local populations and inputs from modern science
can meet the needs of small modern family farms.
The use of local energy sources exploited on a
limited scale would also make possible the gradual
development of small packaging and transforma¬
tion industries.
An efficient network of production and mar¬
keting co-operatives would provide an institu¬
tional framework for these ecodevelopment
strategies. In the medium term, such co-operatives
would make it possible to provide decent living
conditions for a much larger population, while
respecting the vulnerable ecosystems of
Amazonia. They would also slow down the
exodus to the shanty-towns and the proliferation
of uncontrolled gold mining.
The objective must be to make Amazonia
habitable, by abandoning the colonial vision of
an area producing resources which are then
drained away to the outside world. There remain
the far more difficult problems of reducing the
social and ecological costs of mining and
hydropower, improving the living conditions of
the urban masses, and controlling tropical dis¬
eases, starting with malaria.
Contrary to a widespread prejudice, enough
is already known about Amazonia for us to
advance along the road of ecodevelopment,
without neglecting the research which is anyway
necessary. Successful projects and promising local
initiatives can be found in the interstices of the
predatory development model. These solutions,
which for the time being lie outside the dominant
paradigm, may be seen as the precursors of a new
paradigm of development.

No room in the M by Bernd von Droste
The destruction of natural ecosystems and the extinction of plant and animal species
is becoming one of the crucial factors limiting economic growth'
'TAh
36
Lhe scale of the human economy has grown
so large that there is no longer sufficient room
for all species in the Ark." These recent words
from a World Bank official are a striking warning
that the world is becoming so full of human
beings and their socio-economic systems that
other, often priceless, irreplaceable species and
their natural systems are being displaced and des¬
troyed at a rate never before experienced. The
human population of the world is now projected
to double within thirty-nine years, from five bil¬
lion to ten billion, but the issue is not just
numbers, but how those numbers relate to avail¬
able resources. The destruction of natural
ecosystems and the resulting extinction of plant
and animal species is becoming one of the cru¬
cial factors limiting economic growth. Indeed, the
diversity of life on Earth is being rapidly
diminished as uniform production systems
replace cultural and natural diversity.
The diversity of species, however, is essen¬
tial to the normal functioning of ecosystems and
therefore to the biosphere as a whole. Apart from
the moral, cultural, aesthetic and purely scientific
reasons for conserving wild species, the genetic
material they supply already makes a huge con¬
tribution to the world economy in the form of
improved crop species, new drugs and medicines
and raw materials for industry. It also promises
to become even more important in the future as
our understanding of genetic processes is steadily
increasing.
Economic logic tells us that we ought to max¬
imize the productivity of the scarcest factors and
try to increase their supply. Economic policy
should be directed towards the conservation of
remaining natural stocks, increasing their sus¬
tainable use and, where still possible, restoring
lost natural assets. In other words, we need to
undertake a huge programme of investment in
biological diversity.
Three kinds of investment are needed: first,
scientific investment for enlarging our knowledge
base; second, investment in the sound manage¬
ment and restoration of our often degraded
natural heritage; and third, investment in inter¬
national instruments for world conservation of
biodiversity.
INVESTMENT IN
THE KNOWLEDGE BASE
Lack of knowledge is a major obstacle to the con¬
servation of biological diversity. What better illus¬
tration of our lack of knowledge than the widely
different estimates of the present number of living
speciesthey range from three million to one
hundred millionto be found in scientific litera¬
ture? Even less is known about the interaction
of species, the precise role of species diversity, or
how to achieve sustainable development in sen¬
sitive, species-rich areas.
It is often assumed that the establishment of
a system of protected areas will fulfil conserva¬
tion needs. The fact is, however, that we do not
have species inventories for most protected areas

and even less so outside them. We therefore do
not even know what we are aiming to conserve
or which areas to concentrate on. Under¬
investment over past decades in taxonomic
training and research, as well as in surveys of bio¬
logical diversity, means that we simply cannot
complete a world inventory of biota within the
foreseeable future. At the very best, it is estimated
that only some 10 to 15 per cent of all species
have been identified so far.
A start has been made. The International
Union of Biological Sciences (IUBS) and the
Scientific Committee on Problems of the
Environment (SCOPE), in conjunction with
UNESCO's Man and the Biosphere (MAB)
Programme, are preparing a large research
programme on biological diversity. A series of
meetings is being arranged to lay down a basis
for international comparative research relating to
the three main levels of biodiversityat the
molecular and cellular level, at the organism and
population level and at the ecosystem and land¬
scape level. MAB has also launched a co-operative
research and training programme with the Smith¬
sonian Institution to help train taxonomists and
to undertake biological surveys in the tropics.
It is in the tropics, and in particular the
world's remaining tropical forests, that the big¬
gest effort to achieve sustainable development is
needed. Already 55 per cent of the world's trop¬
ical forests, the planet's richest species habitat,
have been destroyed, yet hardly any studies have
been carried out on the relationship between
forest destruction and species loss.
Given their crucial role in the conservation
of biological diversity, it is essential to establish
a scientific basis for the sustainable development
of tropical forests. With this in mind, MAB has
joined in international efforts to develop sus¬
tainable tropical forest management regimes. To
achieve this, MAB is applying the "critical mass
strategy".
The "critical mass strategy" offers a way of
convincing developers that the sum of sustainable
activities can exceed the profits obtainable from
the sum of non-sustainable activities. It is a
strategy which requires making full use of the
range of products and resources that tropical
forests can provide. Major components of this
strategy include:
new logging and extraction techniques, such as
the use of newly-designed airships for timber
hauling;
expansion in the use of non-timber products,
including the introduction of food species such
as gaur cattle, mouse deer and chestnuts;
the development of nature tourism.
INVESTMENT
IN THE NATURAL
HERITAGE
The problem of protecting the natural heritage,
and thus of maintaining biodiversity, is particu¬
larly difficult in developing countries. How can

in situ conservation of genetic resources be
achieved in the interest of mankind as a whole
and of future generations when the rural poor
have few means of satisfying their basic needs
other than to exploit the last intact wild lands?
In 1987, the report of the World Commis¬
sion on Environment and Development, often
referred to as the Brundtland Commission, urged
the establishment of more non-conventional pro¬
tected areas, along the lines of the international
network of Biosphere Reserves established by
MAB over the past fifteen years and consisting
of 300 protected areas in seventy-five countries.
Biosphere Reserves consist of a central "core"
area set aside for strict genetic resource conser¬
vation and monitoring, and an outer "buffer"
zone in which only restricted exploitation is
38
permitted. In most developing countries, interna¬
tional assistance in achieving sustainable develop¬
ment in a buffer zone or other mechanisms for
transfer of material benefits have to be mobilized
as a compensation for non-use of core areas. This
often involves considerable investment of human
and other resources to enhance productivity and
to improve local services such as health care and
education.
Environmental awareness and education
programmes are essential if the Biosphere Reserve
concept is to obtain the full participation and sup¬
port of the local population.
INVESTING
IN INSTITUTIONAL
INNOVATION
There is an urgent need for institutional innova¬
tion, that is, for the adoption of effective inter¬
national legal instruments for the protection of
the global commonsthose features of the planet
that are of universal interest, such as the
atmosphere, the oceans and the diversity of spe¬
cies. These innovative instruments should lead to
responsible world governance and greater
solidarity and equity. Among innovative concepts
and instruments to emerge during recent years
are the World Heritage Convention, debt-for-

nature swaps and the Global Environment
Facility.
In 1972, faced with the increasing threat to
humanity's cultural and natural heritage, UNESCO
led the way to the establishment of the World
Heritage Convention. The Convention is innova¬
tive in several respects. First, it links what were
traditionally regarded as two quite different fields
protection of both the cultural and the
natural heritage. Second, it achieved a conceptual
breakthrough by recognizing that there are cul¬
tural and natural properties of such outstanding
or unique value that they are truly part of the
heritage not only of individual nations but of all
mankind. Third, it has established a World
Heritage Fund made up of contributions by States
Parties to the Convention to be used for the pro¬
tection of the world heritage. Today, having been
adopted by 115 States, the World Heritage Con¬
vention is the world's most universal international
legal instrument for conservation, with 337
properties inscribed on the World Heritage List.
Debt-for-nature exchanges (or swaps) are
another way of investing in conservation and sus¬
tainable development. The roots of the
mechanism lie in Third World debts that can be
bought at a discount on the international debt
market. The first swap was made by Conserva¬
tion International to help develop the Beni
Biosphere Reserve in Bolivia.
By mid-1991, some $16 million had been
invested by industrialized nations and conserva¬
tion groups in purchases of Third World debts
with a face value of almost $100 million. These
have subsequently been exchanged for sustainable
development funds and bonds to the value of

The first Earth Summit
about $60 million to support various conserva¬
tion and development programmes in a dozen
countries.
Established by the World Bank, the United
Nations Environment Programme (UNEP) and
the United Nations Development Programme
(UNDP), with funding of $1.5 billion, the Global
Environment Facility is the latest innovative con¬
servation initiative. Its funds are to be used for
the reduction of greenhouse gas emission, con¬
servation of biological diversity, protection of
international water resources and protection of
the ozone layer.
MEETING FUTURE NEEDS
The international conventions and funding
mechanisms mentioned above constitute an
important advance in the financing of biological
diversity conservation; but far more funds and
innovative instruments are needed. The capital
for conservation investment could be mobilized
through new forms of international solidarity,
such as the replacement of military expenditure
by investment in environmental safeguards.
Global taxes on the production and consumption
of environment-damaging goods could also be
introduced.
A major breakthrough would be the estab¬
lishment of a global fund under a convention for
the protection of the atmosphere, based on taxes
on carbon release or the emission of greenhouse
gases. With the help of such a fund more sus¬
tainable patterns of energy use could be achieved
and the costs of environmental protection and
repair, including the protection of biological
diversity, could be more equitably shared.
Iwenty years after the first World Conference on the Environment, held
in Stockholm In 1972, the international community is faced with a serious
dilemma. On the one hand it is more necessary than ever to increase eco¬
nomic activity in order to meet basic needs and ensure the well-being of a
rapidly growing human family. On the other, human activities are making an
unprecedented impact on the natural environment and on the global systems
which sustain life on Earth, as is demonstrated by air and water pollution, the
massive degradation of land resources, the destruction of landscapes, cli¬
mate changes induced by the wasteful use of energy, the rapid disappear¬
ance of animal and plant species, and the depletion of the ozone layer.
In face of problems of such magnitude, inaction is out of the question.
The General Assembly of the United Nations has thus decided to convene
a new United Nations Conference, this time on Environment and Development
(UNCED), which will be held in Rio de Janeiro (Brazil) from 1 to 12 June 1992.
Many Heads of State and Government are expected to attend this first "Earth
Summit".
WHAT IS AT STAKE
The problem facing the Rio Conference is how to maintain the quality of the
environment and to achieve environmentally sound, sustainable development
in all countries. The following questions will be among those addressed:
protection of the atmosphere (climate change, depletion of the ozone layer,
transboundary air pollution);
protection of land resources (combating deforestation, soil loss, desertifi¬
cation and drought);
conservation of biological diversity;
protection of freshwater resources;
protection of oceans, seas and coastal areas, and the rational use and
development of their living resources;
environmentally sound management of biotechnology and hazardous wastes
(including toxic chemicals);
prevention of illegal traffic in toxic products and wastes;
improvement in the quality of life and human health;
improvement in living and working conditions of the poor by eradicating
poverty and stopping environmental degradation.
The developing countries stress the vital importance of the problems
associated with poverty, inappropriate patterns of growth and development,
the external debt crisis and the deterioration of terms of trade.
POSSIBLE RESULTS
The results of the Conference may include:
1. The adoption of an "Earth Charter" or declaration of basic principles
for the conduct of nations and peoples in relation to the environment and

development, to ensure that the Earth is a hospitable home for human and
other forms of life;
2. Agreements on specific legal measures, notably conventions for the
protection of the atmosphere and biological diversity, both currently being
negotiated;
3. An agenda for action, "Agenda 21", establishing an agreed work pro¬
gramme of the international community for the period from 1992 into the
21st century, setting priorities, targets, cost estimates and modalities, and
assigning responsibilities.
UNESCO'S ROLE
At the crossroads of education, science, culture and communication,
UNESCO offers a unique institutional framework for dealing with envi¬
ronmental and natural resource management problems that are so com¬
plex that only integrated and interdisciplinary approaches are appro¬
priate for tackling them.
Most of the principal environmental issues identified for UNCED
are central to three of UNESCO's major and longstanding international
scientific programmes:
The Man and the Biosphere (MAB) programme for the protection and
management of land resources and ecosystems, and the conserva¬
tion of biological diversity. In this field MAB is a particularly valuable
tool because of its international network of biosphere reserves;
The International Hydrological Programme (IHP) for the study of fresh¬
water resources and their rational use;
Programmes of the Intergovernmental Océanographie Commission
(IOC) and related activities in the marine sciences, for the protection
of coastal areas, the rational use of marine resources, and the study
of the relationship between the oceans and climate.
UNESCO is also directly concerned with environmental problems
through another of its main areas of competence, education. It has
played an active role in encouraging the incorporation of environmental
education into national education policies and curricula. The UNESCO-
UNEP International Environmental Education Programme (IEEP),
launched in 1975, is preparing new materials for teachers and schools
in the form of teaching modules and other materials relating to envi¬
ronmental education and is participating in the training of teachers
in this field.
UNESCO's Social and Human Sciences Sector is also contributing
to environmental programmes through study of the interrelationships
between population, environment, natural resources and development,
and of the decision-making process related to environment and deve¬
lopment.
Finally. UNESCO is closely involved with the protection of the cul¬
tural as well as the natural heritage, notably within the framework of
the World Heritage Convention. It is also concerned with analysis of
the cultural dimension of development, without which environment and
development would be difficult to reconcile.

Time to act
JLyNVlRONMENTAL problems have been a major
international preoccupation ever since the United
Nations Conference on the Environment was
held in Stockholm in June 1972. That Confer¬
ence took place in a climate of optimism and
determination to act.
Action was indeed taken: international
organizations such as the United Nations
Environment Programme (UNEP) were created;
Ministries of the Environment came into being;
and ecologically-minded political movements
emerged. The results, judged in terms of the
volume of publications that have appeared, the
knowledge that has been acquired, and the
number of reforestation and drainage projects
that have been carried out in the newly-
established protected zones, have undeniably
been important. And yet, paradoxically, our
environment has continued to deteriorate. Local
successes have been recorded here and there, but
the current situation is much more critical than
it was twenty years ago.
In the industrialized countries, water is con¬
taminated by chemicals, soils are degraded by
excessive use of pesticides and fertilizers, coast¬
lines are disfigured by ill-planned urbanization,
forests are destroyed and lakes made sterile by
by Francesco á Castri
acid rain, health is threatened by the accumula¬
tion and transport of toxic wastes, cities are
choked with traffic and asphyxiated by air pol¬
lution. The developing countries are confronted
with problems of desertification, the erosion and
salinization of soils, floods, the extinction of
animal and plant species, particularly in tropical
regions. Shanty-towns proliferate, with their
attendant poverty, disease and delinquency.
All these problems, both in the North and
in the South, are linked by a common thread.
They arise from inappropriate development
choices. Of course, the problems are far more
flagrant in the South, because demographic pres¬
sure there is far higher than in the North. But
the true origin of these problems is planetary in
nature, and is connected with the interdepen¬
dence of economies, the competitive interactions
of international markets, monetary disorder, and
the thorny issue of foreign debt.
Some thirty years from now, the human race,
whose numbers will by then have reached ten or
twelve billion, will be affected by the emergence of
environmental problems which will also be of a
global nature: probable disturbance of the climate

increase in the amounts of trace gases, especially
carbon dioxide and methane, in the atmosphere), 41

Drought and desertification in

FRANCESCO DI CASTRI
is the co-ordinator of
UNESCO's environmental
programmes. He Is also
president of the Scientific
Committee on Problems of the
Environment (SCOPE) of the
International Council of
Scientific Unions (ICSU). He Is
the author of many
publications on ecology.
the depletion of the ozone layer in the upper
atmosphere, and the irreversible impoverishment
of biological diversity.
We are thus faced with extremely complex
issues, in some cases uncertain and unpredictable,
all highly dependent on one another, and
changing rapidly on a planetary scale. And yet
our institutions of education, research, adminis¬
tration and management have not been designed
to face problems of this type. Even with a con¬
siderable increase in funds, it is unlikely that we
shall be able to solve them immediately. The key
to a solution is not conjunctural but structural.
To tackle the crucial problems of the environ¬
ment effectively calls for an interdisciplinary
approach which few institutions can provide at
the present time. Research bodies and universi¬
ties are in thrall to evaluation systems strictly
compartmentalized according to discipline, and
there is a widening gap between university
training and research on the one hand and the
real needs of society on the other. Very little cur¬
rent research in this field has an effective appli¬
cation, either because in most cases it does not
address the true problems, or because it is not
integrated into the decision-making and manage¬
ment processes, or because it is not adapted to
the compartmentalization of administrative
structures.
No discipline, not even ecology, can claim
alone to apprehend all the planetary economic
and social ramifications of environmental
problems, no research body or administrative
service can consider itself to be self-sufficient in
this field. No country, not even the most
powerful, can claim to resolve problems whose
causes and effects lie in other countries, nor pre¬
vent their repercussions on its territory. Yet most
disciplines ignore one another or are rivals in the
search for research funding. The professions with¬
draw into their traditional corporatism, ministries
are divided into sectors virtually impermeable to
interaction, and countries only agree on insuffi¬
cient norms for protection.
In these conditions it is easier to solve a few
immediate or partial problems than to succeed
in establishing institutions really capable of
managing and overcoming what has to be called
the environmental crisis.
MUST THERE BE
AN ECOLOGICAL CATASTROPHE
BEFORE WE ACT?
Technical solutions exist for most of the
problems, even if they meet psychological and
structural resistance and clash with powerful and
contradictory economic interests. Perhaps we
shall take the necessary measures in time, as
public opinion and economic and political circles
gradually become aware of what is at stake.. It is
more likely, however, that we shall wait until a
far greater shock occurs than any we have yet
known. It would be most regrettable if our col¬
lective instinct for survival could only be aroused
in the face of a major ecological catastrophe.
Let us hope that this will not happen. It is
particularly important that partial lack of results
or precise data should not provide an excuse for
inaction, both by decision-makers and by each
and every one of us. Delay would be terribly
costly and some forms of environmental damage
may be irreversible. It takes only a few hours to
cut down a forest, a few months to cause erosion
and desertification, a few years to change world
climate. But a species that disappears never reap¬
pears, tens or hundreds of years are required for
a forest to regenerate, a thousand years to restore
eroded soil.
Let us hope that the environmental crisis,
with all its gravity and complexity, may ulti¬
mately act as a catalyst for better communication
in our laboratories, for greater flexibility in our
administrative structures, and above all for greater
equity between countries rich and poor, and
towards the future generations to which we owe
responsibility for the Earth which has been
entrusted to us.
A change in behaviour by each individual,
each institution and each State is the only basis
from which an acceptable future can emerge from
the constraints of the environmental crisis. Let
us hope that this change can take place without
being provoked by a major ecological catastrophe
from which no-one would be secure.

UNESCO's new Dialogue ¡
Dialogue, a quarterly review ;
produced by UNESCO's Office of '
Public Information for Latin
America and the Caribbean,
appeared in April, providing the
Organization with a new means
of publicizing its activities in the
region. The magazine also
examines, through a main
theme and interviews, different
aspects of Latin American life.
The third (October 1991) issue
of Dialogue analyses current
thinking in the new world
geopolitical context and looks at *
the situation of Latin American
youth today. Dialogue, which
now also appears in English and
French, is distributed free by the
UNESCO Bureau in Caracas,
Box 68394, Caracas 1062-A,
Venezuela.
A 4,000-year-old iceman
The perfectly preserved corpse
of a Bronze Age man was found
last September in a glacier
3,200 metres up in the
mountains of the Austrian Tyrol.
The discovery of the corpse,
together with weapons and
other objects found in the
vicinity, may shed light on little-
known aspects of life in Europe
4,000 years ago. Carbon-14
dating should make it possible
to definitely establish the age of
the iceman, even if the reasons
for his presence so high up in
the hills remain a mystery.
A prize for peace
The UNESCO Prize for Peace
Education for 1991 has been
awarded to Ruth Leger Sivard of
the United States and to the
Cours Sainte-Marie de Hann in
Senegal, one of UNESCO's
Associated Schools. The prize,
which was established in 1980
by UNESCO's Executive Board
thanks to a donation from the
Japan Shipbuilding Industry
Foundation, is awarded annually
by an international jury of
intellectuals, religious figures,
educators and statesmen. It
rewards individuals and
Institutions that have achieved
distinction through actions
aimed at mobilizing opinion in
the cause of peace.
UNESCO issues directory of
children's institutions
To encourage contacts between
organizations and Individuals
around the world working to
improve the condition of young
children, UNESCO has published
an International Directory on the
Young Child and the Family
Environment. It contains entries
on 670 institutions in 116
countries, and also Includes
basic economic and
demographic data about each
nation, covering such subjects
as the infant mortality rate, the
female illiteracy rate, the fertility
rate, gross national product, the
level of access to local health
care and the number of
underweight children under the
age of 5. The Directory can be
obtained free from the Director
of the Young Child and the

Reporting on the environment
Last August UNESCO launched
the first of a series of brochures
entitled "Environment and
Development Briefs" with a
report on "Debt for Nature" !
swaps, designed to finance
conservation projects by
renegotiating Third World debts.
Illustrated with colour photos
and high-quality graphics, the
brochures are written by ¡
specialists but in non-technical
language. They are targeted ;
primarily at policy- and decision- ;
makers in business and
government who need an
authoritative overview of global
environment and development
issues and possible strategies
for action. Themes of upcoming
Briefs include ocean observation,
long-term monitoring of
ecological change, water
management in urban areas,
mitigation of natural hazards,
and the sustaining of tropical
soil fertility. Further Information
can be obtained from the

Dido honoured
A sculpture of Elyssa, the model
for the Dido of Virgil's Aeneid,
will be unveiled to mark the
inauguration of an arts festival
to be held at Carthage (Tunisia),
In June 1992. A sister of King
Pygmalion of Tyre, Elyssa was,
according to legend, the founder
of Carthage, originally a
Phoenician settlement. The
festival, the "Journées
Internationales des Arts
Plastiques de Carthage", will
Include round-table discussions,
seminars; conferences of artists
and archaeologists, music
recitals, dance and poetry
performances and other events
designed to evoke the
Mediterranean cultural heritage
and the affinities between the
countries of the region. The long-
term objective of the festival is
the establishment at Carthage
of an international arts centre
and a museum of daily life.
Commemorating American
Indian culture
In 1998 the National Museum of
the American Indian Is scheduled
to open Its doors in Washington
D.C. The new museum's
collections will be managed in a
way designed to meet criticisms
made over the years by Indian
communities about the
presentation of their culture by
anthropologists. The treatment
accorded to human remains and
to ritual and funerary objects
dug up accidentally or during
archaeological excavations has
been particularly controversial,
and in future these will be
returned to the communities
that ask for them.
Fishing for medicines
The first stage of a lengthy
"pharmaceutical fishing" project
has recently been completed
off the Tunisian coast. Twenty-
five scientists and divers
aboard the ketch Fleur de
Passion collected about a
hundred specimens of sponges,
algae and phytoplankton for
laboratory examination. All of
these organisms are known to
secrete chemicals to defend
themselves against predators or
pathogenic agents, and ¡t is
thought that these substances
could have medicinal uses. In
the course of the project, which
is expected to last until 1994,
the boat will also travel to the
Indian Ocean and to Southeast
Asia.
Children's tales
The 7th Salon du Livre de
Jeunessea children's book
fairwill be held in the Paris
suburb of Montreull from 28
November until 2 December. It j
will be preceded by an j
international symposium on the !
traditional tales that still ¡
i
inspire many contemporary !
writers for children and young
people. One talking point will be
how, at a time of increasing
cultural uniformity, to preserve
the diversity of the cultures in
which traditional tales are
valued.
Galileo rediscovered
Thirty-four letters sent by
Galileo from Florence
to an unidentified correspondent
were revealed for the first time
in September at a seminar
held In Venice under UNESCO
auspices to mark the 400th
anniversary of the great Italian
astronomer's acceptance
of the chair of mathematics at
the University of Padua. Written
during the eight years preceding
Galileo's condemnation by the
Inquisition in 1633, the letters
show the astronomer under
great stress and gradually giving
way to pessimism. The
correspondence was
rediscovered by researchers in
the library of the Bishops of
Bologna.

HERTA LEPIE, German art historian, is head of the
jewellery and precious metal workshop of Aachen
cathedral. She is the author of many publications on
the cathedral and religious pilgrimages to it.
ROLAND WENTZLER is a German art historian who
is chief public relations officer for the cathedral and
other churches in the city of Aachen.
ACHEN cathedral, which incorporates
the Palatine Chapel of Charlemagne, is the
most beautiful surviving example of Carolin-
gian architecture. On 31 March 1978 it became
the first German monument to be inscribed
on UNESCO's World Heritage List.
A living monument
Situated at the westernmost tip of Germany,
close to the frontiers of The Netherlands and
Belgium, Aachen once symbolized the polit¬
ical and cultural unity of the Carolingian
empire. Today it is the European city par excel¬
lence. Its principal attraction is the Palatine
Chapel, a remarkable monument rich in art
and history, which attracts more than a mil
lion visitors each year. Besides its historical
and cultural interest, Aachen cathedral is also
a place of pilgrimage, just as it was in the
Middle Ages, when it vied in importance with
Rome and Santiago de Compostela. Besides a
venerated image, Our Lady of Aachen, the
cathedral houses Charlemagne's tomb and,
among other sacred objects, a reliquary con¬
taining four particularly remarkable pieces of
material: the robe of the Virgin Mary, the
swaddling clothes of the Infant Jesus, the gar¬
ment that girded the loins of Christ on the
Cross, and the cloth used at the beheading of
St. John the Baptist.
These great biblical relics have been
solemnly displayed every seven years since

1349, and it is expected that in June 1992
countless pilgrims will again gather at Aachen
to join fervently in the procession held in their
honour.
The Palatine Chapel
The region of Aachen, in the central part of
the Frankish kingdom, was rich in game and
possessed hot springs whose beneficial proper¬
ties were already known to the Romans. It was
in fact on the ruins of the ancient Roman
baths that Charlemagne built his palace, a
building whose function was political, eco¬
nomic and religious as well as residential. Not
much survives to recall its political role, origi¬
nally embodied in the Throne Room, except
the foundations of the tower known as the
Granusturm, whose stones were used to build
the city's Gothic town hall. The residential
quarters and storehouses have disappeared
without trace. But the church that
Charlemagne dedicated to the Virgin and
chose as his final resting-place has stood the
test of the centuries.
The building was probably completed
around the year 800. Two years previously,
the theologian Alcuin had announced in a
letter to the Emperor that the columns of the
chapel were being built. Originally, the Pala¬
tine Chapel consisted of three elements: the
central building, with a rectangular choir to
the east and an entrance porch to the west.
The peripheral chapels and the Gothic choir
with its stained-glass windows are later
additions.
Built on an east-west axis, the church fol¬
lowed the plan of early Christian basilicas, an
atrium surrounded by colonnades. Traces of
it can still be seen in the parvis.
The way into the building is through a
combined porch and belltower, flanked by
two towers with staircases in them. The effect
is one of fortress-like bulk. The two brass
doors of the main portal were cast in Aachen
in Charlemagne's time. Four other doors and
eight grilles from the same workshop are deco¬
rated with motifs recalling Roman Antiquity.
There are two artefacts from Roman times in
the narthex: a brass she-wolf and a bronze pine
cone that may once have decorated a fountain
in the atrium.
The chapel itself is clearly modelled on the
architecture of Ravenna and of Byzantine
basilicas. It consists of a two-storey-high
octagonal rotunda encircled by a sixteen-sided
ambulatory. Heavy polygonal pillars support

. the eight arcades of the upper storey, which
are flanked by bronze grilles from the Carolin¬
gian period. Within the arcades are the famous
marble columns brought by Charlemagne
from Rome and Ravenna to stress the con¬
tinuity of his project with the architecture of
the Roman empire.
This imposing edifice is topped by a dome
of a type which had never previously been
constructed north of the Alps. To support the
weight of so large a structure, Charlemagne's
architect divided the calotte of the vault into
eight sections, allowing him to distribute the
weight equitably across eight pillars. A ring
of metal dating from Carolingian times helps
to support the base of the dome. The roof is
decorated with a mosaic representing the
twenty-four elders of the Apocalypse. The
height of the building (32 metres) exactly cor¬
responds to the diameter of the church's outside
46
wall, so the building would fit perfectly into
a cube, thereby respecting the proportions
attributed in the Bible to the Tower of Babel
and the Heavenly Jerusalem.
The high altar, the oldest in Germany, is
situated in the western part of the aisle, on the
site of an earlier altar. Its marble had already
been used previously. On it were crowned
twenty-five of the thirty German emperors,
from Otto the Great in 936 to Ferdinand I in
1531.
The altar is decorated with seventeen
golden bas-reliefs dating from the early
eleventh century, which were probably com¬
missioned by Otto III and completed in the
reign of his successor, Henry II. Christ the
Redeemer is shown in the centre, flanked by
the Virgin Mary and the Archangel Michael,
both intercessors for the human race. Four
medallions representing the symbols of the
Evangelists surmount scenes from Christ's
passion.
The gilded archbishop's throne presented
to the cathedral by emperor Henry II also
dates from the same period. At first installed
in the octagonal chapel, it was moved to the
southern wall at the time of the construction
of the Gothic choir in the fifteenth century.
It is splendidly decorated with sixth-century
Coptic ivory plaques carved to represent
mythological scenes, and with bas-reliefs of the
four Evangelists.
The cathedral contains the remains of two
German emperors: Charlemagne himself, who
died in 814, and Otto III, who died in 1002.
The exact location of Charlemagne's original
tomb is no longer known. Otto III discovered
it in the year 1000 and removed some relics.
In 1165, Frederick I moved the emperor's
bones to a temporary cenotaph, and since 1215

they have lain in a shrine restored to its full
splendour by the patient efforts of the
cathedral's conservators.
The Palatine Chapel soon became a place
of pilgrimage, but unlike the ancient basilicas
it had not been built with that purpose in
mind. That was why the cathedral chapter
decided in 1355 to construct the Gothic choir,
which was completed in 1414, exactly 600
years after Charlemagne's death.
The Carolingian edifice is surrounded by
a crown of Gothic chapels, on two levels like
the central octagon. A staircase dating from
Carolingian times provides access to the upper
storey. There stands the marble throne of the
German emperors. Impressively sober and
massive, it is made of four slabs of marble from
the eastern Mediterranean, set on four blocks
of stone; six steps lead up to it. A tenth-
century chronicler informs us that the throne
was set between two marble columns so that
the sovereign "could see everything and be
seen by everyone".
No building north of the Alps so power¬
fully evokes the new Rome that Charlemagne
dreamed of founding. The choice of architec¬
tural models from the fifth and sixth centu¬
ries was intended to indicate to contem¬
poraries that he considered himself as the heir
of the Western Empire. Columns brought
from over the Alps, brass doors and grilles
bearing Roman motifs: these and other details
were meant to give visible expression to the
enduring link between the ancient world and
the medieval West. The Palatine Chapel was
originally conceived as an image of the
heavenly Jerusalem as described by St. John
the Divine in the Book of Revelations. And
it is true that the magnificence of its gold and
precious stones and the mysterious harmony
of its architecture do bring to mind the splen¬
dours of the heavenly city.
A masterpiece in peril
The people of Aachen have always done their
best to maintain their cathedral, but histor¬
ical events have often come close to destroying
it, notably during the Second World War.
Once hostilities were over, the demanding task
began of making good the considerable
damage done to the building. The roof had
to be repaired, stained-glass windows to be
replaced, the entry to the choir to be restored.
The chapel in the tower had been completely
destroyed and needed to be rebuilt.
One problem that still remains is the
cleaning of the Carolingian masonry. Prelimi¬
nary work is now virtually completed, and
tests are currently being carried out to estab¬
lish the best method of treatment. Other
future projects include the restoration of the
Hungarian chapel and the chapels of St. Anne
and St. Matthew, as well as repair work on
the roof, particularly over the octagonal
chapel.
It would be impossible to restore and con¬
serve the cathedral and its treasures without
outside help. Although the cathedral benefits
from generous public funding, private initia¬
tives have also played a part. The earliest dates
back to 1847, when citizens of Aachen formed
the first association dedicated to preserving the
site, the Karlsverein. Part of this tradition is
the "Aachen Cathedral, masterpiece in peril"
campaign, which was launched in 1988 and has
received an encouraging response from the
business community and from private
individuals.
Good works do not exclude good
humour, to judge from the many unusual
ideas the campaign has sparked. A circus put
on a special performance, a brass band gave
a charity concert, a modelling club contributed
a competition prize, and newly-weds have
asked for contributions to be made to the
cathedral instead of wedding presents. Banks
and savings banks have provided sponsorship;
a colouring book has been produced to reveal
the cathedral to children; local newspapers
keep their readers informed on the state of the
restoration work; the 400-odd participants of
a world conference of iron-smiths offered
hand-crafted work for sale at auction.
The results of these and other activities are
swelling the funds already available from offi¬
cial sources, proving that the cathedral can also
count for its survival on the people of the city.

The current session of UNESCO's General Conference is taking
place at an exceptional moment in world history. In the last two
years we have seen radical changes in the order established by
the victors of the Second World War. Are UNESCO's activities going
to change as a result?
Of course they are adapting to these changes. Paradoxically,
UNESCO is thus returning to its original mission. The United
Nations Organization was created to maintain world peace. The
Charter of the United Nations defined several major principles:
respect for justice, the rule of law, human rights and fun¬
damental freedoms for all without distinction of race, sex, lan¬
guage or religion. UNESCO's mission is to develop intellec¬
tual co-operation in the fields of culture, education, science and
communication.
For over forty years its effectiveness was limited, for two
reasons. Four-fifths of humanity lived in colonized and depen-
Interview ú
dent countries where the basic principles of the United Nations
Charter could hardly be applied. The bipolar division of the
world had provoked the cold war and ideological opposition
between East and West. UNESCO's initiatives were confronted
and very often paralyzed by this situation. The UN itself could
only play a limited role in the prevention and solution of con¬
flicts. The situation today is totally new. Most of the former
colonies have become independent and their voices are starting
to be heard on the world stage. In the last two years the
totalitarian regimes of eastern and central Europe and the
Balkans have fallen. The USSR itself has begun a long journey
towards democracy and respect for human rights. South Africa
is attempting to put an end to apartheid.
The conditions now exist in which ideological confronta¬
tions and fear of the Other can disappear. The principles of
the United Nations Charter can be taken into account by
humanity without the arriere-pensees and manipulations we
have known for forty-five years.
Does this mean that from now on everything is for the best in
the best of all possible worlds?
Certainly not. But I wanted to make these observations
which allow us to be more optimistic today than ever before
in the past. The problems to be solved today and tomorrow
are enormous but we can try to solve them by talking the same
language and with a greater chance of success.
There are two things I would like to add. Firstly, although
these principles are accepted by everyone, they are not respected
by everyone. In its capacity as the intellectual component of
the United Nations system, UNESCO has a duty to identify
the obstacles which prevent their application and to help to
overcome them. Secondly, the principles themselves must be
further refined. We live in an inegalitarian world. Below a cer¬
tain level of poverty and deprivation, freedom loses its sub¬
stance, civic equality becomes an abstraction. If they are to be
given tangible form, these universal values must be accompa¬
nied by real acts of solidarity, by an ethic of sharing. If some
people enjoy prosperity, knowledge and culture in a rich world
while others are deprived of these benefits of civilization, the

world cannot be at peace. The duty of fraternity is an ethical
imperative, for humanity is one and indivisible in its diversity.
We are still far from this state of solidarity.
That is why we are going through an uncertain transitional
period in which the best and the worst exist side by side, in
which the highest expectations are accompanied by terrible
risks. It would be more accurate to talk in terms of several tran¬
sitions, taking place in different time-scales and at different
rhythms, yet linked to one another, inextricably intertwined.
In some cases national sovereignty and independence are leading
to extremes of nationalism based on exclusivity and rejection.
Alas, from the blossoming of cultural identities in a framework
of freedom it is possible to take a^ pathological course which
leads to the exclusion of others. When there is a rapid recrudes¬
cence of nationalism which has been repressed for dozens of
years, only democracy can peacefully reconcile the active coex¬
istence of all cultures and languages.
The transition between totalitarianism and democracy is
not easy. It implies the passage from a war economy to a peace
economy, and above all from a war culture to a peace culture.
Our models of economic development have led to the sacrifice
of the environment and the human condition to the require¬
ments of productivity. Man and nature share an indivisible
destiny.
All these changes vary according to places and situations,
but today everything is changing rapidly as developments in
communications and the media shrink the planet. Humanity
has some interests and hopes that are held in common and
others that differ and are even contradictory. UNESCO must
in its thinking and in its action take account of this "living
matter".
Could you explain what you mean by different time-scales,
rhythms, interests and hopes?
Look at a world map. Africa, Asia, Western Europe, North
America, Latin America, Eastern Europe, the Arab world. The
configuration of problems and priorities differs widely from
one cultural region to another.
In Africa demands for democratization are making them¬
selves felt. Regional and international co-operation is necessary
to make possible an economic take-off based on the realities,
the genius, and the creativity of the African peoples.
In Eastern Europe the fall of totalitarianism is opening the
way to freedom and national self-determination but also to dis¬
trust and prejudices which are rooted in a more or less distant
past and which must be overcome because they threaten peace
and risk fomenting clashes between peoples.
In Latin America a common trend has become apparent
among the peoples of Latin culture since the fall of the dictator¬
ships. These peoples are tackling the problems posed by the
modernization of their societies, while at the same time bearing
a very heavy burden of external debt.
In Asia, modernization is already under way, but it is
accompanied by demographic pressure that is giving rise to new
contradictions in a world whose time-honoured cultures must
integrate the latest technological and scientific advances.
In Western Europe and North America, where the
privileges of wealth, knowledge and power are concentrated,
questions are asked about the meaning and use of these advan¬
tages. Even there inequality is increasing and leading to turmoil
as Western societies search for values adapted to new condi¬
tions of life, work and leisure. In a world that is both increas¬
ingly united and increasingly inegalitarian, the need for
solidarity and sharing is very strong.
What can UNESCO do in face of all these transitions?
It alone can help to encourage in the international commu¬
nity a meeting of minds based on the universal values defined
in the United Nations Charterespecially since it has had forty-
five years of unique experience.
There is an alchemy of intellectual co-operation, of the
gradual coming together of ideas, just as there is an alchemy
of incomprehension, discrimination and discord. The former
can only prevail if there is a relentless determination to defend
everything that brings people together and unites them. Clearly
this does not mean suppressing originality in the interests of
a generalized uniformity. Respect for differences is of vital
importance, for unity can only be achieved in a debate which
takes account of the individuality of each person, the specific
features of each culture, the flowering of each people.
Culture, the cultural dimension of peace and of sustainable
development with a human face, will be at the top of the polit¬
ical agenda, at the national and global levels. It has too often
been treated as ornamental in bilateral accords, as the cherry
on the cake, added for the sake of decoration without anyone
really believing in it.
Are there rules of emulation in creativity just as there are rules
for economic competition and rules for road traffic?
Yes. UNESCO has a duty to serve two complementary pur¬
poses: individuality and universalism. I must repeat that the
defence of one's own identity should not lead to the rejection
of other people's. We know, however, that this can happen and
we must fight against this perversion. It is thus of crucial impor¬
tance to respect the universal values and rules without which
communication and exchange would be impossible. 49

How can UNESCO help this process?
By increasing awareness of what is involved in making
choices, by extending the range of intellectual discussion,
UNESCO's programmes aim to put the experience of the inter¬
national community at the disposal of those States that wish
to profit from it when they take decisions on matters which
fall within the Organization's fields of competence. Some of
the main priority areas are: the generalization of basic education;

higher education; protection of the environment and manage¬
ment of natural resources; improving the flow of information;
encouraging freedom of creativity; taking into account the cul¬
tural aspects of all forms of development.
We must give support to decision-makers as they face
different choices and encourage them to act; we must offer struc¬
tures and means of co-operation; we must provide international
legal instruments. We can, for example, help to further the
advance of knowledge through our océanographie programmes
and through the programme on Man and the Biosphere. We
can bring together intellectuals and creative people from all
regions to discuss the major problems of our time, as we did
recently in Prague, where the theme of the meeting was Culture
and Democracy. The positive developments of the past few
years are helping to bring about an entirely new openness in
the East, the West, the South.
Do fields such as science and culture lend themselves to govern¬
ment action?
That question was asked when UNESCO was created. As
far as science is concerned, there can be no doubt. Without inter¬
national co-operation, it is not possible to study the oceans,
the atmosphere, space, watercourses, deserts, ecology and so
on. The fallout from Chernobyl did not respect frontiers.
The situation with regard to culture is more complex.
Intellectuals and creative artists need to be independent from
political pressure. They have said "No" to dictators, colonizers,
arms dealers, polluters. With the end of the bipolar world and
the resurgence of democracy, this distrust is tending to diminish,
and will continue to do so, even if the duty of intellectuals to
criticize is in a sense sacred as a protection against the excesses
and distortions of our society. UNESCO has valuable
experience of projects that bring together governments,
decision-makers and individuals, intellectuals and creators.
Is there a particular image or priority which you would like to
mention in conclusion?
The culture of peace seems to me to be of primordial impor¬
tance today. We need to work on this concept. We are intoxi¬
cated by our culture of war, often without even realizing that
we are. Rejection of other people is accompanied by recourse
to violence. We know the cost of war, but we don't know the
cost of peace: an active, speedy and respectful justice; an environ¬
ment protected by the conscious attitudes of everyone; suffi¬
cient food and a decent system of health care; but above all
an unfettered spiritual framework in which everyone can find
fulfilment. On the philosophical level as well as in more mun¬
dane ways, we must explore the values and customs that
encourage the culture of peace.
It is in this spirit that the United Nations system must
evolve without delay. Substantial differences separate the United
Nations Organization of 1945 from that of 1995, when it will
be celebrating its 50th anniversary.
The new world we are entering needs ideas and values.
A debate at both local and global levels should help the tran¬
sition from the bipolar world of the Second World War to the
new world born of decolonization and the fall of the Berlin
Wall.
