In the latter part of the second millennium BC, the Greek city of Mycenae became one of the chief
centres of the Aegean world. Beginning with the celebrated discoveries of the German archaeologist
Heinrich Schliemann in the 1870s, excavations at Mycenae have brought to light vast quantities of
jewellery, gold masks and other precious objects including elaborate ivory artefacts such as mirror
handles and combs. An outstanding example of Mycenaean craftsmanship in ivory, this group (7.6 cm.
high) depicting two goddesses and an infant god dates from the 15th century BC. It is now preserved in
the National Museum at Athens.

Cover
Scattered among the deep canyons and high
plateaux of the Mexican Sierra Madre, the
Huichol Indians have maintained, virtually
intact, an ancient culture going back to pre-
Hispanic times. This culture has given rise to
a highly original art of which "yarn painting"
is an outstanding example. In these paintings,
with their brilliant colours and pure lines,
Huichol artists bring vividly to life the sacred
world of their ancestors and their gods. Our
cover is a reproduction of a yarn painting by
the Huichol artist Juan Ríos Martínez,
entitled Revelation of the Blue Deer. This
issue of the Unesco Courier also examines
other aspects of Latin American culture in
articles devoted to the deciphering of Mayan
hieroglyphics and the bewitched reality of
Haitian art.

Are we heating up
our planet?
A new global programme
to examine man's impact on the climate
by William W. Kellogg
IT is generally recognized that "the cli¬
mate", which can be loosely defined as
the kind of weather we have learned to
expect next year, is actually never exactly
the same from one year to the next, or from
one decade to the next. There is a very
human tendency to count on favourable
weather for growing crops, for planning
vacations, for choosing where to build
houses, and so forth, and we are delighted
when the weather is better than usual and
dismayed when it is worse. Yet the facts
are quite clear: the climate fluctuates from
year to year and it changes over periods of
decades.
There are plenty of sobering examples of
such fluctuations in the climate that are still
fresh in our memory. Western Europe and
the eastern United States have experienced
some cold winters that strained fuel sup¬
plies and temporarily closed factories; the
Sahelian region of North Africa is still re¬
covering from a severe drought that lasted
from about 1969 to 1974; the western part
of the Soviet Union suffered a cold, dry
winter and a hot, dry summer in 1972 that
resulted in a severe reduction in its grain
crop. Yet these and other anomalous con¬
ditions were not unprecedented! They had
occurred before, and similarly unusual
weather will occur again in various parts of
the world.
These recent events serve as reminders
of the fact that the climate of our planet is
the result of an ever-changing and delicate
WILLIAM W. KELLOGG is a senior scientist at
the National Center for Atmospheric Research
(NCAR) at Boulder, Colorado, and a former
director of its Laboratory for Atmospheric
Science. Atpresent on leave from the NCAR, he
is working with the World Meteorological Orga¬
nization as adviser to the Secretary-General on
the World Climate Programme. He has written
widely on the dynamics of the upper atmos¬
phere, applications of meteorological satellites,
atmospheric chemistry and air pollution and the
influence of mankind on the climate of the earth.

balance, a balance determined by the
actions of the sun, the atmosphere, the
oceans, the land, the ice and snow of the
polar regions, and all living things
including mankind. We can contemplate
conditions in the not too distant past (some
15,000 to 20,000 years ago) when North
America and Western Europe were largely
covered by great masses of ice and marvel
that the climatic balance is as stable as it
has been over the last several centuries.
There are a number of reasons why we
can no longer be complacent about our
restless climate, as we have tended to be in
the past.
First of all, living as we do on a planet
with limited resources and fully expecting a
continued increase in the human popula¬
tion and average standard of living, we do
not have the food and other reserves that
existed in the past. Thus, a large climate-
induced failure of crops or of fisheries in
one part of the world is felt worldwide.
Secondly, as we plan new developments
of highways, irrigation systems, industry,
energy generating plants, and large-scale
agricultural production in both the indus¬
trialized and the developing countries it is
increasingly important to take the expected
fluctuations and changes of climate into
account.
Thirdly, we have learned enough about
the global system that determines our
climate to realize that natural changes of
climate can occur on all time scales, and
furthermore that the activities of mankind
can have a very appreciable influence on
climate in the foreseeable future.
Finally, new tools have been acquired for
advancing our knowledge of the climate
system and the impacts of climate on
society, including powerful techniques for
observing the earth from space, and for
collecting and analysing climate-related
data with computers. These technological
advances have been accompanied by
equally impressive advances in theoretical
understanding of the climate system itself
and, to a lesser extent, the response of
social structures to climate variations and
change.
These considerations of a global or uni¬
versal nature all suggest that the problems
connected with climate must be attacked
on a worldwide, international scale. For
that purpose, the United Nations and its
various agencies, with the World Meteoro¬
logical Organization taking the lead, to¬
gether with the International Council
of Scientific Unions, are now working
together to institute a World Climate
Programme.
Such a programme must go beyond the
realm of conventional climatology, since
the study of the climate system includes
virtually all branches of the earth sciences
and ecology as well; furthermore, a major
thrust of such a programme must be to.
understand the impacts of climate on*

Climatic changes can have an important impact on human societies. The
"Little Ice Age" (1500-1700), for example, eliminated the vineyards of
England and turned the English into a nation of beer-drinkers. It also saw
a dramatic advance of the Alpine glaciers. The 20th century has been
marked by a worldwide warming and a retreat of the Alpine glaciers. The
engraving, at top of page, of the Argentière glacier, in France, was made
in about 1860; the lower photo, taken in 1968, shows the extent of the
glacier's retreat over a period of a little more than a century. Today,
about threequarters of the world's freshwater is stored in ice caps and
glaciers. If all existing ice were to melt, it would cause a rise in world sea
level of some ninety metres.

chuman activities and institutions, and to
assist decision-makers in planning and co¬
ordinating climate-sensitive activities so
that these are less vulnerable to climate
change and variations.
As a preliminary step the first World
Climate Conference, an interdisciplinary
conference of experts on climate and man¬
kind, is being organized by the World
Meteorological Organization (WMO) with
the co-operation of Unesco and other inte¬
rested United Nations bodies, the Interna¬
tional Council of Scientific Unions (ICSU)
and the International Institute for Applied
Systems Analysis (NASA). This Confer¬
ence is being held in Geneva from 12 to 23
February 1979.
The purpose of the Conference is to
review what we know about the system
that determines climate, and then to
explore the many impacts of climate varia¬
bility and change on such human activities
as agriculture, water resources, provision
of energy, forestry and fisheries, and finally
to trace these impacts back to their effects
on the basic social and economic struc¬
tures of society.
The conclusions of the Conference will
be taken into consideration when the
WMO Congress meets in May 1979 to con¬
sider the adoption of the World Climate
Programme. The draft of the Programme
has been in preparation for several years
and during 1978 a number of meetings of
experts were convened to work out the
plans in some detail. As at present envi¬
saged the Programme will consist of four
sections or sub-programmes each dealing
with an important aspect of the subject:
climate data, climate application, climate
impact studies and climate research.
Conventional climate data includes data
describing the record of the changing wea¬
ther, such as temperature, rainfall or snow¬
fall, wind, pressure, humidity and cloudi¬
ness plus data related to climate such as
solar radiation, sea surface temperature
and extent of sea ice.
Meteorological data come from more
than 9,000 "synoptic" surface weather
observing stations, about 4,000 of which
report regularly eight times daily as stations
of the global synoptic network; and about
900 of these network stations also make
upper air observations once or twice daily.
In addition to the land-based stations some
7,000 merchant ships make surface obser¬
vations, and about 1,500 commercial air¬
craft reports are made daily. The data in the
network are exchanged in a matter of hours
by the Global Telecommunications
Systems organized by WMO's World Wea¬
ther Watch Programme. Such data are fur¬
ther processed and archived at a number of
Regional Meteorological Centres and the
three World Data Centres for Meteorology
(in Washington, Moscow and Melbourne).
The immediate purpose of all these
observations is to make weather forecasts,
and usually not enough attention has been
paid to the data needed by agriculturalists,
hydrologists, and other users of climatoló¬
gica! data, and to the needs of scientists
studying such matters as ocean circula¬
tions or the conditions in polar regions.
Some of these non-synoptic data are cur¬
rently gathered by networks outside of the
direct responsibility of the meteorological
services.
Other kinds of climate-related data that
are needed for research on past climates
include, for example, tree ring records, dis¬
tributions of various kinds of pollens in lake
sediments and the histories of glaciers.
The purpose of this part of the World Cli¬
mate Programme, therefore, is to deter¬
mine where the data exist and to make
them more widely available when needed.
The range of data needed for various cli¬
mate applications and research is very
great indeed. The developed countries
have in general made some use of climate
data in planning and managing major pro¬
jects such as water resource develop¬
ments, new electric generating plants,
highways and urban expansion and the sta¬
tistical techniques for this purpose are fairly
well established. This part of the World Cli¬
mate Programme will be especially concer¬
ned with helping the developing countries
to apply knowledge of climate at a time
when many of them are contemplating
expansions of their industrial and agricultu¬
ral bases.
In many of the developing countries

climate is a critical factor which must be
taken carefully into consideration in any
planning they do. There are a number of
ways in which an international organization
such as the WMO can assist developing
nations to apply the knowledge of climate
in their planning and management of agri¬
cultural, industrial and social develop¬
ments. Some countries have fairly advan¬
ced national climate applications program¬
mes and the WMO can arrange for a trans¬
fer of the techniques they employ to other
countries that wish to make use of them. It
can also advise on the installation of data
processing facilities and arrange for the
training of technicians.
Climate variability and climate change
can have a profound impact on society and
different socio-economic structures may be
affected very differently, for example, by a
drought or a severe cold spell or a flood.
Some structures are clearly more vulnera¬
ble than others to the vagaries of climate,
though the reasons for this large range of
sensitivity are far from clear. To understand
and then predict the response of a social
and economic system to a certain change
or fluctuation in climate is the purpose of
this part of the World Climate Programme.
While listed fourth among the sub-
programmes of the World Climate Pro¬
gramme, climate research, by which we
seek to improve our knowledge of the
global system that determines climate
everywhere, could well be considered the
key component.
This part of the Programme will empha¬
size the development of various kinds of
theoretical and empirical models of the cli- ^
mate system. As these models continue to f

INCOMING SOLAR
RADIATION
An important function of our atmosphere is to filter radiation
coming towards the earth from the sun. The atmospheric shield
admits most of the short-wave radiation to the earth, but, like a
greenhouse, traps some of the radiation from the earth that
would otherwise escape to space (see diagram above). This has
the effect of slowing down the dissipation of energy from the
earth, thus stabilizing the temperature range at the earth's
surface. Today, however, man is burning such large quantities of
fossil fuels such as coal, petroleum and natural gas that he is
adding huge extra amounts of carbon dioxide to the atmosphere.
Carbon dioxide absorbs radiation from the earth and prevents it
from escaping to space, so, in effect, man is "making the glass
of the greenhouse thicker". Right, graph shows the average
surface temperature in the northern hemisphere since 1860. The
lower dashed line shows what the average temperature would
have been if man had added no extra carbon dioxide to the
"natural" atmosphere. The dotted line right shows the dramatic
rise in average world temperature we can expect if present
trends continue.

Approximate range of

in past few centuries
I improve they will simulate the behaviour of
the real system more and more closely.
Through them it will be possible to learn
how well climate variability (on a seasonal
or yearly time-scale) can be predicted.
Even more important, however, is the
fact that these models will enable us to
judge more accurately the critical question
of how sensitive the climate system is to
tha large-scale changes induced by the
activities of mankind. Although for a long
time to come we may not be able to make
good predictions of the natural variations
of climate from year to year, we can
already simulate the behaviour of the cli¬
mate system well enough to be convinced
that our human activities can produce a
climate change on a global scale if we
continue on our present course.
Of all the major world problems that can
be foreseen in the decades ahead, the pros¬
pect of mankind's warming the earth looms
as one of the most pressing and unprece¬
dented. The addition of carbon dioxide to
the atmosphere by the extensive burning of
fossil fuel (coal, petroleum, natural gas) is
the largest single influence and may pro
duce a significant global warming by the
end of this century. The warming is due to
the fact that carbon dioxide is a long-
lasting and stable' atmospheric trace gas
and it absorbs infra-red radiation from the
surface that would otherwise escape to
space a process sometimes called "the
greenhouse effect". We may also add
more of this gas as we cut down the tropi¬
cal forests of the world, since the decay of
wood also produces carbon dioxide.
Carbon dioxide remains in the atmos¬
phere for a very long time, the main sink for
it in the long run being the oceans. In fact,
it is estimated by oceanographers that it
would take between 1,000 and 1,500 years
for the oceans to absorb one half of the
carbon dioxide we have already added to
the atmosphere. For all practical purposes,
the steady increase in the concentration of
this trace gas that has already occurred
(about fifteen per cent since the beginning
of the century) and will probably continue
until the concentration has doubled in the
middle of the next century is irreversible.
This prediction of a global warming is
still based on some rather uncertain premi
ses, not the least of which is the prediction
of mankind's own future behaviour where
energy production is concerned. Much has
been written about this subject and it is fair
to say that there is now a growing consen¬
sus in the scientific community that carbon
dioxide will indeed continue to increase if
mankind continues on its present course. A
current "best guess" is that by the end of
this century the earth will on average be
warmer than at any time in the past 1,000
years or more, and with the temperature
still rising.
What is not so clear are the implications
of this climate change to mankind. Cer¬
tainly the large scale patterns of the atmos¬
pheric and oceanic circulations would
change, and this would cause regional
changes of both temperature and precipita¬
tion that are larger than the average. Some
places would be drier than now, some wet¬
ter; and while the average surface tempera¬
ture would rise, some regions might even
experience a coolingfor a while, at least.
The polar regions are expected to warm
more than the tropics, and this would
cause changes in the extent of polar snow

and ice and, eventually, some changes in
the volumes of the great ice sheets of
Greenland and Antarctica, with a corres¬
ponding change in sea level though gla-
ciologists generally believe these last re¬
adjustments will be very slow on the
time-scale of human affairs.
Of more fundamental importance to peo¬
ple everywhere are the readjustments that
will have to be made as temperature, rain¬
fall, snowfall, and wind patterns gradually
change. During this period of continual
readjustment of the climate system there
may also be larger year to year fluctuations.
Some regions and the people there, depen¬
ding on what they do for a living, will
become better off as a result of the shifts of
climate, while others will be hurt. In any
case the readjustments of agricultural prac¬
tices and patterns of living will in some
cases be drastic, and it seems to be an eco¬
nomic verity that all large-scale readjust¬
ments are expensive for the community as
a whole.
If we think of the future course of climate
change and the response of mankind to it
as a kind of scenario, then we are already
well into the First Act of the play. What will
happen in the subsequent drama as it
unfolds and becomes history is still a mat¬
ter for speculation. Will mankind try to go
about its "business as usual", or will some¬
thing be done to reduce the burning of fos¬
sil fuels and the deforestation of the tro¬
pics? Will we be wise enough, in any case,
to foresee the future course of the climate
change and plan the responses of nations
in the light of this knowledge?
No one can say just what will happen, of
course, but the World Climate Conference
and the World Climate Programme seem to
be vital first moves in the right direction.
William W. Kellogg
The effects of man's activities on the climate are
particularly evident in the Sahel, the belt of semi-
arid land stretching across Africa from Mauritania
and Senegal in the west to Chad and the borders
of the Sudan, which for centuries has been the
traditional grazing land of nomadic herdsmen. Top
right, over-grazing and deforestation have turned
thousands of square kilometres of former
pastureland into desert. Right, prehistoric rock

THE colossal pyramid-temples that
dominate the ancient cities of Chi-

gible evidence of the skill and inventiveness
achieved by the Mayas, a people whose
civilization flourished in Middle America
during the first millennium AD. Yet these

the columns of multi-coloured characters
and tiny symbolic drawings of the Mayan
VLADIMIR A. KUZMISHCHEV, Sower spe¬
cialist on the culture of Latin America, heads the
cultural section of the Latin American Institute
of the USSR Academy of Sciences. He is the
author of many articles on the ancient Mayas
and his book The Mystery of the Mayan Priests
has been translated into Bulgarian, Hungarian,
Latvian, Lithuanian and Estonian. He is vice-
president of the Soviet Association of Friendship
and Cultural Co-operation with Latin American

fig-bark manuscripts that for so long defied
the attempts of experts throughout the
world to decipher them.
Although attempts had been made over
the centuries to unravel the mysteries of a
number of unknown scripts, it was only
relatively recently, about two hundred
years ago, that deciphering was placed on
a proper scientific basis. One by one the
problems were solved ; Egyptian hiero¬
glyphics and the Sumerian cuneiform script
yielded up their secrets, and it became an
accepted principle that any unknown
script, however unusual, could be read,
even if, as in the case of the cuneiform
script, the language in which it was written
had been lost.
There remained, however, the enigma of
the Mayan codices. For over a hundred
years scholars the world over had pored
over them to no avail, finally concluding
that the codices could never be read since
they consisted of pictographs, or "sign-
writing", which could be interpreted but
not read.
This was how things stood at the begin¬
ning of the 1950s, when Yuri Knorozov, a
young Leningrad scholar working on
problems of comparative and historical
language studies and mathematical lin¬
guistics, began to take an interest in the
Mayan codices.
As a rule, unknown scripts have been
deciphered with the aid of a "key" in which
the same text is recorded in two languages,
one of which is known. The French scholar
Jean-François Champollion used the
Rosetta Stone in this way to solve the
riddle of Egyptian hieroglyphics. The task
of deciphering is also made easier by a
knowledge of history, of events running
parallel in different countries and of con¬
tacts between countries.
Information of this kind, however, was
totally lacking about pre-Columbian Ame¬
rica. Nor could a single bilingual text be
found. New methods of deciphering the
codices had to be employed.
Only three codices were known at the
time: the Dresden, Madrid and Paris codi¬
ces, thus named after the cities in whose
libraries they were conserved. After
studying all the available written material
about the ancient Mayas and their codices,
Yuri Knorozov was amazed to find enor¬
mous gaps in the research undertaken.
Knorozov began with a very elementary
assumption if the codices were indeed
"written" texts, the system of writing
could be determined by a comparison of its i
structure with that of various other known
Examples of Mayan hieroglyphs and their
meaning: (1) Sprouting seed; (2) Corn-cob;
(3) Ripening (depicts the ripening of
maize); (4) Talking; (5) Road (foot-print);
(6) To pour; (7) (two meanings) Store of
rainwater or the moon; (8) Death (eyes
closed); (9) A dead person in the foetal
position.

writing systems. But what was to be the
basis of comparison if the meaning and
function of the Mayan characters remained
unknown?
The answer proved simple. Knorozov
gave each sign a number and this enabled
him to determine the total number of signs,
their repetition frequency and other charac¬
teristics which, when compared with the
indicators of other known systems, reveal¬
ed the structure of ancient Mayan writing.
In the three codices there proved to be
only about three hundred signs ; if the
Mayan manuscripts had been full of picto-
graphic writing there would have been
several thousand. Pictography, therefore,
was ruled out.
The number of sounds in any language
usually averages thirty to forty, which cor
responds approximately to the number of
letters in the alphabet. So this was not a
simple alphabetic system.
In the so-called syllabic systems (the
Japanese katakana and hiragana, the
Indian devanagari, or the ancient Cypriot
script) the number of syllables does not
exceed one hundred to one hundred and
fifty, so this did not apply.
In morpheme writing, where the sign
corresponds to the root of the word or to a
grammatical particle, one thousand to one
thousand five hundred morphemes are
essential. So this too was eliminated.
There remained only the last of the
known systems hieroglyphic writing, a
mixed system in which some of the signs
stand for morphemes and others represent
sounds and syllables. How did the number
of signs compare in this case? It coincided!
Thus, using the precision tool of figures,
Knorozov confirmed a hypothesis that had
first been put forward by the French orien¬
talist Léon de Rosny as early as 1881. The
Mayas used a hieroglyphic script which
could, therefore, be read.
This was but a beginning, it remained to
discover the precise meaning of each of the
three hundred signs, how they were pro¬
nounced (if, indeed, they were pronounced
at all) and in what language they were
written.
This called for another "simple" dis¬
covery and a brilliant piece of guesswork
which came to Knorozov as he was read¬
ing and analysing the "Landa alphabet" in
a famous manuscript dating from 1566, the
Re/ación de las cosas de Yucatan (An
Down-to-earth
Before the Spanish conquest all Mayan
priests had manuscripts which served as
manuals and there were libraries in all the
towns; but in the mid-sixteenth century,
the Inquisition burned these "pagan"
manuscripts. Today only four Mayan
manuscripts are extant the Dresden
codex, the Paris codex and the Madrid
codex, all named after the cities in which
they are now preserved, and the Grolier
codex, which is in a private collection in
New York. The extract from the Dresden
codex, right, tells, in text and pictures, how
Kashish the god of wind and rain sets out
(first panel), like a peasant, to plant maize
before the coming of the rains. He carries
an implement to make holes in the ground
and a bag of seeds on his back. The
footprints beneath his feet symbolize the
long walk to the maize fields. When this
task is finished Kashish goes (second
panel) to a burial site, indicated by buried
bones, where he invokes the aid of the
ancestors. Then he goes (third panel) to
fetch lime from a lime pit (the Mayas kept
their maize in a lime solution). Having
obtained enough lime, Kashish wades into
a river (fourth panel) to collect water lilies
and mussels. The text above the first
panel reads: "Eleven [days before] the
ninth [period]. Goes to the field [the god]
Kashish before he leaves for the journey
[?]. This is his task. One [day before] the
second [period]." In a later version of the
Dresden manuscript, bottom right, the
god's peasant-like activities have been
replaced by an elaborate ritual. He goes
(first panel) to the temple to collect
offerings. Then he goes to a lake (second
panel) where he invokes rain with magic
gestures of his arms. One chapter of the
codex treats of women and of days of
good- or ill-omen for them. On twelve out
of every twenty-six days, the god of death
"received a flower", c'an nic-te, (which in
Mayan also means the consummation of
marriage) and on those days, unless
forewarned by a priest, a woman could
become death's bride. Yumtsek, the god
of death (third panel) is seen seated and
holding a flower, nic-te, in his hand. The
text above reads: "He receives a flower
[god of death] Yumtsek, he who has the
power of death. Twelve [days before] the
second [period]."

Reading the stars
The Mayas kept careful astronomical and meteorological records in
an attempt to determine the onset of the rains, when maize was
sown. It is difficult to judge what success they had in forecasting
weather, but Mayan astronomers made a thorough study of the
solar year, picking out thirteen constellations similar to the signs
of the zodiac. Each constellation bore the name of an animal.
Right, reading from right to left in this extract from the Paris
codex, we see a rattlesnake (today's Pleiades), a turtle (Gemini), a
scorpion (Cancer). The Mayan zodiac as depicted in the Paris
codex, can be traced back to the first centuries BC. Above, El
Caracol, the impressive Mayan observatory at Chichen-ltza. It
consists of a tower-like.construction built on a huge raised
platform measuring 67 by 57 metres. In the centre of the tower
rises a spiral staircase in the outer wall of which windows were
pierced to allow astronomical observations to be made.

account of matters relating to Yucatan). In
this manuscript, the franciscan Diego de
Landa, Prior Provincial and later Bishop of
Yucatan, informed his superiors about the
Maya Indians and about what he had done
to eradicate heresy.
The heresy was wiped out and with it the
culture that embodied the spiritual world of
the Indian. Many thousands of Mayan
manuscripts perished, but the franciscan's
Re/ación has come down to us, a unique
source of knowledge about the ancient
Mayas. The Re/ación, a copy of which was
discovered in 1863 by the French writer and
explorer Brasseur de Bou rbourg, contained
not only an "alphabet", but examples of
words written in Mayan signs. But for long
these had been considered to be, if not a
forgery by Diego de Landa or whoever
copied his manuscript, as at best a highly
inexpert attempt to correlate the letters of
the Spanish alphabet with Mayan sign-
drawings.
Knorozov began by checking de Landa's
alphabet and it soon became apparent that
there was no forgery or confusion either in
the alphabet or in the examples. Outstand¬
ingly accurate in everything he did, de
Landa had tried to make it easier for his
superiors to understand Mayan hieroglyphs
by using in his alphabet not letters but their
names, since they were actually nearer and
corresponded phonetically to some ele¬
ments of Mayan hieroglyphics, and the
names of letters consist of syllables. Kno¬
rozov understood this from a casual remark
of de Landa's: "they (the Mayas) write in
syllables..."
However, the Landa alphabet contained
only examples of Mayan signs and was not
a complete catalogue. Of the three hun¬
dred signs, it gave only those which
directly or closely corresponded to the
names of the letters of the Spanish alpha¬
bet, and these totalled only twenty-five.
The position was further complicated by
the fact that, as noted earlier, hieroglyphics
constitute a mixed system of writing and
are a far cry from the almost ideal simplicity
of letter combinations. Not only were there
three hundred signs, but the signs them¬
selves performed varied and sometimes
dual functions. There were three kinds of
sign: ideographic signs, giving the roots of
words; phonetic, conveying one syllable or
one sound; and key hieroglyphs or determi¬
natives, which explain the meaning of
words but are not themselves words that
are meant to be read (the word "robin", for
example, can mean a bird or a man; the key
sign tells the reader which is meant).
Knorozov turned again to mathematical
analysis of the grammatical laws of lan¬
guage. For this purpose he used mainly the
texts known as the Books of Chi/am Balam,
which were written in the sixteenth and
seventeenth centuries and consisted of
Mayan texts transposed into Latin script.
Parts of these texts referred to the pre-
Columbian period and were consequently
nearest of all in time to the language of the
hieroglyphic manuscripts.

<![CDATA[
Stone disc portraying a Mayan ball-player. The Mayans played a ritual ball game a form of
which still survives in north-western Mexico. Games took place in a walled, rectangular
court. The players struck a solid rubber ball against the walls with their forearms and
hips. The ball travelled at great speed and fatal injuries were not uncommon. The players'
hips, elbows and knees were protected with leather padding. Post-game ceremonies are
believed sometimes to have included the sacrifice of the players of the losing team.
k Each given a number, the hieroglyphic
signs were used to discover the grammati¬
cal laws of the language. And though there
was very little material to work on (all three
manuscripts filled only two hundred and
ten pages) the basic indicators of the
Mayan hieroglyphs, such as the repetition
frequency of each sign and its characteris¬
tic placing, were gradually determined.
This method, which has come to be
known as "positional statistics", finally
revealed the secret of Mayan hieroglyphic
writing. Each sign now had its "passport"
testifying to its purpose and position in the
structure or combination of signs. Cross¬
checking of individual words gave positive
results. Thus positional statistics became
something of a Rosetta Stone for Knoro¬
zov, except that he had to invent it, not just
find it.
The outcome of these enormous labours
was a fundamental work, The Writing of
the Maya Indians, published by Knorozov
in Leningrad in 1963.
It remained to read the Maya manu¬
scripts, a quite different but no less time-
consuming, complex task. It must not be
forgotten that the language of the six¬
teenth century Mayas in which the Books
of Chilam Balam were written, is very diffe
rent from that used by Maya Indians today.
The manuscripts, however, contained texts
in a language going back two thousand
years.
An enormous amount of work was done
by Mexican scholars at the Centre for
Mayan Studies at the Autonomous Natio¬
nal University of Mexico, who concentra¬
ted on the problem of determining the lan¬
guage of the manuscripts. They attempted
to discover which of the existing groups of
Mayas talk in a language nearest to that of
ancient times, just as we might ask which
of the modern "Latin" languages, Spanish,
Italian, French, Portuguese or Romanian, is
nearest to the Latin of ancient Rome.
This work continued simultaneously in
several countries and at the end of 1975
Knorozov's new book. The Hieroglyphic
Manuscripts of the Mayas, was published,
containing translations of all the four
extant manuscripts.
These manuscripts are not books as we-
understand the word, but reference
manuals or "encyclopaedias" covering all
facets of the life and traditions of the
ancient Mayas. "These manuscripts",
writes Knorozov, "which were reference
manuals for the village priests, were cer¬
tainly not meant to be read straight
through. The priests used them to find
their way through the labyrinth of ritual for
the countless movable feasts... The official
significance and ceremonial of these feasts
were, it is clear, known not only to the
priests but also to the lay community."
The full extent of Knorozov's talent and
achievement shines through his trans¬
lations (see examples page 12). It is hard to
overestimate their importance for our
understanding of the history of the Mayan
people.
First of all, the very existence of writing
confirms the extremely high level of civiliza¬
tion attained by the Mayas. Secondly,
during the deciphering process, irrefutable
proof was obtained that the writing was a
"local" invention, since the hieroglyphic
signs are based on local flora and fauna and
on Mayan traditions and culture.

notable. Once the Mayas developed an
agricultural civilization, society quickly
divided into strictly defined classes and a
wide gulf appeared between the nobles and
the ordinary people. Power and property were
transmitted through the eldest son and the
younger sons of nobles became priests or
warriors. Other classes were formed by
artisans, merchants, sorcerers, doctors and
soothsayers and each class had its own
patron deity.

Detailed study of the manuscripts,
however, tells us much more than that. For
instance, with the aid of the manuscripts it
is possible to look into the skies of that
remote era, since the Mayan priests were
excellent astronomers who recorded not
only the annually repeated movements of
the sun, the moon and the stars of the solar
system, but also such unusual occurrences
as the appearance of shooting stars,
meteorite showers and eclipses. These
happenings of one and a half thousand
years ago can hardly fail to interest con¬
temporary astronomers.
The Mayas also created a calendar which
was more accurate than our own Gregorian
calendar. The length of their solar year was
365.2420 days, as compared with the
365.2425 days of the Gregorian calendar
and the actual length of the solar year
which is 365.2422 days. Such startling
accuracy draws attention to their whole
system of reckoning the years. Researchers
have established that the Mayas had a
mythical zero date, the year 5,041,738 BC,
and that they began their chronology at the
year 3113. How and why these dates were
selected is not yet known for certain. Any
assumption that the year 3113 marked a
world flood or the birth of a Mayan Mes¬
siah is pure conjecture.
Knorozov has translated all the known
Mayan manuscripts (the fourth was publis¬
hed by the eminent American authority on
the Mayas, Michael Coe, who discovered it
in 1973 in a private New York collection).
But it is entirely possible that new Mayan
books may be discovered. Moreover, there
are Mayan inscriptions on countless steles,
on buildings and utensils, on frescoes, bas-
reliefs and other products of the culture of
this remarkable people.
These inscriptions are also written in hi¬
eroglyphs, but their "construction" differs
in many respects from that of the manus¬
cript writings. Most of these inscriptions,
as we know from those that have been
deciphered so far, deal with historical
rather than religious or ceremonial themes,
and this should enable scholars to fill in
many blanks in our knowledge of the
Mayas and of pre-Columbian America.
The Mayan manuscripts, however, are
only a part of Yuri Knorozov's theoretical
research in the field of the theory of signs.
With a team of young Soviet scientists he
has published a series of basic works on
inscribed seals from Harappa and Mohenjo-
daro, and other scholars, using his method
of positional statistics, are attempting to
unravel the mysteries of other as yet unde-
ciphered scripts.
Vladimir A. Kuzmishchev
The ancient ways
of the Mayas
THE newborn Mayan babe was brought
to the priest "so that he could look
into his destiny, determine his future
' occupation and give him a name". A text on
portents, dating back to the colonial period,
tells us that babies born on the days of Kan,
Chuen and Men were destined to become
craftsmen, on the days of Khish and
Kibwarriors, on the day of Khets'-
nab doctors, etc. The priests were thus in
a position to classify children immediately
by occupation and advise parents how to
bring up their children.
Children were breast-fed until the age of
three or four. Girls grew up under the
watchful eye of their mothers.
The Mayas considered a squint as a sign
of beauty, a condition they induced by sus¬
pending a small ballattached to the hair
by a string between the child's eyes.
The age of maturity for the Mayas was
fourteen to fifteen years for girls and seven¬
teen to eighteen for boys. Initiation rites,
after which marriage was permissible, took
place earlier, however, to facilitate parental
arrangements for marrying their children.
Following their initiation, sons helped their
fathers in their work. A young man bore his
father's name, but on marriage, added his
mother's name.
YURI KNOROZOV is senior adviser at the
Miklukho-Maklai Institute of Ethnography of the
USSR Academy of Sciences and a leading
authority on the theory of signs and on the
ancient civilizations of India and the Americas.
The author of over a hundred scientific papers,
he was awarded the State Science Prize in 1978.
During the first years of marriage, the
husband worked for his father-in-law, living
with his wife in a small hut on the family
grounds. If he complained about his work,
he could be sent packing.
Most women wanted to have many sons
and made special sacrificial offerings to six
gods and to deities at the four cardinal
points, the goddess of the moon and five
other goddesses. On special days, women
spent the night in the temples hoping to be
visited by a benevolent god.
A woman meeting a man would turn her
back on him or, at least, lower her eyes. If a
girl happened to look at a man, her mother
would rub her eyes with pepper. On festive
days, men and women feasted and danced
separately, although, according to an
ancient tradition, men and women danced
together a special "rocking dance". If a
woman was unfaithful, she was censured,
but her seducer was stoned to death.
Filed teeth were considered stylish for
women. After marriage, both men and
women were tattooed above the waist,
except for the breast; they also rubbed
themselves with a red ointment which pro¬
tected them from the heat, the cold and
mosquitoes. Women perfumed themselves,
applying to their skin a red aromatic bar of
resin; they garlanded their hair with flowers
and, after dark, with glow-worms.
During the nomadic period it was the cus¬
tom to kill off the elders because of the
scarcity of food. The Itzas killed off their
old people after they had reached the age of
50 (52 years was regarded as the maximum
life span) to prevent them from becoming
sorcerers. Agricultural communities, how-
by Yuri Knorozov
ever, valued their elders for the wealth of
experience they had accumulated (in the
choice of land, in seed selection, in weather
forecasting, etc.).
Notions about the dead changed fre¬
quently and these were reflected in the
burial rites. Some drawings represent a
dead body in the shape of an embryonic
child, conveying the idea that the dead
ancestor is incarnated in the newborn child.
The dead were painted red (a very ancient
custom which has been diversely interpre¬
ted) and tightly swathed. The dead were
considered to be very dangerous, a belief
probably connected with instances of con¬
tagion resulting from contact with a
corpse.
The dead person was clearly made ready
for a journey. He was wrapped in a travel¬
ling robe, bits of precious nephrite and a
ball of dried dough were placed in his
mouth, things a traveller would bring along.
The statuettes of gods and various other
articles were placed in the grave.
In connexion with the tales that had been
told about ancestors having arrived from
the north, it was believed that when a per¬
son died he set off for his legendary home
in the north. According to other beliefs,
probably of much later origin, the dead per¬
son left for an underground world Uch-chab
or ich kab = "in the ground"). The ghost of
a dead person passed successively through
nine spheres of the nether-world before he
could be incarnated in the newborn child.

The
Huichol Indians
A- pre-Columbian culture in Mexico today

<![CDATA[
A group of Huichol Indians crossing the
imposing landscape of Mexico's Sierra
Madre Occidental on the traditional
pilgrimage to the holy desert land in
search of peyote. The Huichol, or Wixitari
as they call themselves, form a compact
ethnic and cultural group with a whole
system of mystic and religious beliefs and
a highly original art (see central colour
pages). The yearly ritual pilgrimage, which
may last up to three months, is a period
of fasting and abstinence during which
the Huichol not only emulate their
forefathers, they temporarily "become"
their sacred ancestors.
by Juan Negrin
''
THE men who came to Mexico in
search of gold and souls ripe for
conversion, and stayed to beget the
people of mixed race who inhabit the
country today, paid little heed to certain
groups of the indigenous population who
retreated into the fastnesses of their steep-
flanked sierras.
The 6,000 or 7,000 Huichol Indians, who
today live on communal land in the south
of the Sierra Madre Occidental in the Mexi¬
can States of Jalisco and Nayarit, are survi¬
vors of one of these marginal groups. The
area they occupy is impenetrable, except
on foot, formed as it is of a jumbled land¬
scape of canyons anything up to 500
metres deep and of peaks over 2,000
metres high. The Huichol do not constitute
a single ethnic group but are divided into
three tribes, the Huautiiari, the Tuapuritari
and the Tateikitari, which differ in both lan¬
guage and culture. Their languages belong
to the Uto-Nahuatl family, and they had
settled in the Sierra before the Aztecs -
entered the valley of Mexico.
The strength of their culture was such
that, far from allowing themselves to be
absorbed, they continued to develop their
art along the lines which they had followed
before Cortés appeared on the scene.
Today, just as in the past, the Huichol peo¬
ple give renewed vigour to their collective
memory by the intense celebration of com¬
plicated rites, and thereby aspire to develop
a strong and healthy "spiritual heart"
(¡yari). They live in conditions of poverty
and impose on themselves additional priva¬
tions in the form of vows and sacrifices. In
the words of the Huichol artist José Bení-
tez: "This is how the xuturite suffer (xutu-
rite are "paper flowers", which is the name
given to the Huichol in the "language of
the gods"): they go without eating or
sleeping, without possessions and without
JUAN NEGRIN, Mexican scholar and writer,
has been carrying out research on the art and
religion of the Huichol since 1970, living among
them and undertaking a number of expeditions
to their holy places. He has organized several
important exhibitions of Huichol art in Mexico
and the United States and his writings on Hui¬
chol religion and culture include : The Huichol
Creation of the World, E.B. Crocker Art Gallery,
1975 ; El arte contemporáneo de los huicholes
(Contemporary Huichol Art), Guadalajara Uni¬
versity, Mexico, 1977 ; and Apreciación subje¬
tiva de la cultura huichola (A Personal Apprecia¬
tion of Huichol Culture), UNAM, Mexico, 1978.
knowing where they are going. They are
poor and innocent, but they are rich in their
kupuri (soul) and life".
There is nothing negative in the indiffe¬
rence of the Huichol to material depriva¬
tion. The ¡yari that grows out of their self-
discipline imbues them with the dignity and
integrity that are such striking characteris¬
tics of the people of the Sierra. The first
study on the development potential of the
Huichol region, carried out by the Mexican
Government in the mid-1960s, concluded
with the observation that the Huichol had
scarcely altered their outlook on life over
the centuries, if at all, and that they had
upheld and preserved the traditions of their
world, which they considered to be incom¬
parably superior to the civilized world, even
when the latter was presented to them as
highly desirable.
In contrast to modern man, the Huichol
esteem life for its transcendental and
immanent aspects. The "spiritual heart"
consists of a sediment of impersonal
memories which have formed since the
dawn of mankind. The ancestors, such as
Fire ("Our Grandfather"), the Sea ("Our
Mother"), and the first animals, sacrificed
their physical hearts to give life to the Hui¬
chol and to invest them with ¡yari and the
power of supernatural vision. The Huichol
try to follow the example set by the crea¬
tors and to make themselves worthy of the
spiritual life through material sacrifice.
The most menial tasks of the Indians are
all linked to the creation of the world which
finds echoes in the microcosm of each indi¬
vidual life and in the essence of all that sur¬
rounds us in the plant and mineral world.
The present is blended with the eternal, eli¬
minating the need for "distraction" since,
as the Romanian historian of religions Mir-
cea Eliade has written: "any occupation
entailing responsibility is in itself a means
of escaping from time". These tenets of
the Huichol are at the very root of pre-
Hispanic thought in Latin America and of
universal religious feeling.
Huichol art takes a number of forms, the
first of which is sacred, mystical, transcen¬
dental and collective. It is a religious art
"dedicated to worship" that is "capable of
arousing, as well as describing, spiritual
experiences". Only the shamans or "chan¬
ters", known as the maraacate (singular:
maraacame), understand the exact forms
and precise significance of this art, which
can be considered as the manifestation of a

Top, The Womb of the World, by José Benítez Sánchez
Here we see the world. It was formed by Kauyumarie (the deer-
spirit, soul of the gods) from a woman. Her name is Tatéi
Yurianaka. Indeed, the earth was originally a woman who lived in
the first world of Watetuapa. There, Kauyumarie asked her if she
would like to become a world which would be inhabited by the
most important gods. She accepted and Kauyumarie entered her
womb, which started expanding as though she had become
pregnant. Thus Kauyumarie is represented as a Deer-Person (at
upper centre) within a round ball, which is Tatéi Yurianaka's
womb. He is implanting the seeds of the fruits and the plants
which will sustain our lives. At the very centre he planted the
first plants which man would collect before he learned the art of
cultivation. Amidst this produce he also placed an edible worm,
kawi, and the iguana to serve as food for his "angels," the future
Huichol. Helping Kauyumarie are his divine assistants. He placed
Tatewari, the Master of Fire, (at left) in charge of the Blue Deer,
the ancestor of our deer, whose blood is the nurture of his soul.
Tatewari, who cooks our food, has a sacrificial knife in his hand.
He walks on flowers as does the other great deity Taweviékame,
the Sun (represented on the opposite side). Below, Pariya (right),
the Spirit of Dawn in the land of peyote, and Vieruku Temaiku,
the Young Vulture as a person (left), are in charge of the prayer
gourds. The world is surrounded by water. Four eagles appear
from the foam of the seas which circle the earth. Each eagle is a
guardian of one of the four corners of the earth.

Bottom, After Their Death, the God-Spirits Gather in Wirikuta,
by José Benítez Sánchez
The ancestor-gods have died in flesh, but they are still alive in
spirit. Every year the god-spirits gather to visit their chief. Elder
Brother Kauyumarie. Even after the ancestor-gods became
disembodied their womb remained in the holy desert of Wirikuta.
Here they meet after a year has elapsed. Their hearts, their souls,
their pulse and their words are all placed together upon the altar
of Parietsié (at bottom centre) where they first saw the light of
the earth's surface. Tatéi Yurianaka, Our Mother Moist Earth, and
Tatéi Werika Wimári, Our Mother, Young Eagle Girl who is the
spirit of the sky (perched atop Yurianaka), are above the altar.
Our Elder Brother Kauyumarie is depicted as a deer (at right) with
Our Mother Corn, represented above his back (top right) as a
corn plant. Emerging from the right of the altar, Tatewari, the
god-spirit of Fire, is depicted with his flames rising about
Kauyumarie. Our Father the Sun (at lower left), appears at the
gathering of the god-spirits in multiple forms. His heart is a deer
(far left) whose red vertebrae are visible.

Top left, Kieri Awatusa Is Feasted and Consecrated,
by Tutukila Carrillo
All the god-spirits gather in Teacata and prepare a celebration to
grant White Antler status as a god-spirit. In recognition of his
attributes, he received the votive arrow, the greatest symbol and
instrument of power. The arrow, decorated with a bow, small
footwear and a mat on which his spirit can rest, are placed at the
base of his plant form. A bull is sacrificed to him so that its
blood may nurture his spirit. Incense is burned in a three-legged
clay vessel to honour the bull. Great Grandmother Growth and
Grandfather Fire dedicate votive candles to the spirit of Kieri.
Tsitsika Temai conveys his felicitations from all the other god-
spirits. Xaye, the rattlesnake, conveys his gratitude to the god-
spirits for receiving charge of guarding the Kieri. Awatsay, the
crested woodpecker, will alert the Kieri spirit to the presence of
those who approach. The Moon and the Sun each offer him their
personal nierika so he can be in contact with their spirits.

Tuapuri, Tacutsi, Tatewari and Tamatsi Kauyumarie (clockwise at

arrows. From the bowl beside the lower god-house is served
ground peyote as the ancestors celebrate the feast of hikuri.

Top right. The Ancestor-Gods Try Peyote,
by José Benítez Sánchez
Here we see the major ancestor-gods : Kauyumarie, Our Elder
Brother Deer-Spirit, Tatewari, Our Grandfather Fire and
Taweviékame, Our Father Sun. This is the way they saw
themselves when they ingested the peyote cactus, which is their
own heart. They each took the same amount of peyote (which is
represented as three barrel-like figures with roots projecting to
the right). Under the effects of peyote, Kauyumarie saw himself
transformed into a deer (upper left). He then turned to see a
human face on his tail, with which he began to converse. Our
Grandfather Fire (lower centre), was the most affected by
peyote ; he saw himself crawling like a serpent, spreading out as
ashes from which he saw flowers appear. Our Father Sun took
on the shape of a mountain lion as he was still consuming the
roots of this peyote. He felt as though he were precariously
balanced on a tree about to fall because of its swaying motion.
Bottom right. The Creation Of Salt, by José Benítez Sánchez
Tacutsi Nakawé, Mother of the Gods, went to the oceanside
where she prepared to die. She pulled out her bones (upper left)
which she ground with a stone, and they became salt mixed with
earth. She ground the teeth of her jaws and they turned to pure
salt, which she sprinkled on the sea. Watákame (far left) watches
in awe the transformation of her bones and teeth to salt. When
Tacutsi, with black wing-like extensions, stepped into the sea
(lower left margin) a large wave rose along the coastline (wavy
blue line in centre). Here Tamatsi Maxayuavi, the Blue Deer, was
born.

The ecstatic vision
of Haitian art
Colour page 22
In an explosion of creativity Haitian artists today are producing
highly original works in which tumultuous forms and vivid
colours are directly inspired by the experiences and traditions of
the Haitian people. Often, perhaps unjustly, labelled "naive" or
"primitive" these artists present what the Haitian writer Jacques
Stephen Alexis has termed "the imagery in which a people
enwraps its experience and reflects its conception of the world
and of life". Shown here, two typical examples of their work :
above. Bird Island by Jasmin Joseph ; below. Paradise on Earth
by Wilson Bigaud. See also back cover.

collective effort which they control and
summon up on ritual occasions, when hun¬
dreds of Huichol flock to a ceremonial cen¬
tre (Tukipa), often located more than a
day's hard travelling from their scattered
homesteads. There they foregather to take
part in a supernatural drama, whose pur¬
pose is to recreate the propitious atmos¬
phere needed to regenerate the life of the
world.
Taking the place of the gods, the partici¬
pants have to restore harmony between
water ("Our Mothers of the Sea, of the
Rain, the Sky and the Earth"), fire ("Our
Grandfather"), the sun ("Our Father Crea¬
tor"), and "Our Elder Brothers the Wind
and the Deer". For several days and nights,
they surrender themselves in a state of fer¬
vour to a ritual imitation of the Ancestors
through dancing, fasting, and night-long
vigils kept to the hypnotic beat of their
music.
The Ancestors are invoked, solicited by
the chanting of the maraacate, libations
and animal sacrifices, and placated by the
striving of their human descendants. Thus
the immanent spirit of the Ancestors and
the vigorous human spirit are blended
together in a mutually-sustaining commu¬
nication between the macrocosm and the
microcosm in which the eternal brings ferti¬
lity to the present.
Boys and girls, young people and old, all
take an active part in this union of the
human with the divine. Individuals combine
their endeavours and enthusiasm to sup¬
port the extraordinary skills of the maraa-
came, who chants for the people as a
whole. The feast of the Ancestors is fol¬
lowed by the feast of the men who have
drawn close to the gods through fire, peni¬
tence and spontaneous representation. In
this way families from isolated homesteads
enter into tribal communion.
The creation of magical time and space
in the rites conducted at the ceremonial
centre reflects and exemplifies the pattern
lived out in the family homesteads. The
feast is the dramatic culmination of a cycle
of daily tasks centred on the cultivation of
corn ("Our Mother"), and the most impor¬
tant moment in the ceremony is the "dance
of Our Mother", in which she is asked to
pardon them for eating her.
This attitude is symptomatic of tha Hui¬
chol feeling for ecology. "Everything is
sacrificed on our behalf: the Corn gives us
its daughters, the Deer its young, the Sun
its arrows and the Sea its plumed-serpent
daughters, the rain-filled clouds." This is
the very basis of the customs which the
family observes in self-abnegation from day
to day. The members of the family live
together in imitation of the divine order and
apportion their functions and responsibili¬
ties accordingly. Four-year-old children, for
instance, care for their younger brothers,
and share responsibility for them with their
parents. Grandparents in their turn hand
down the wisdom they have accumulated
over the years.
Huichol children are brought up with a
religious sense of life which gradually
reveals the meaning of the mysteries sur¬
rounding them. They listen while the elders
recount a miscellany of myths and person¬
al experiences. They learn that everything
in their environment is imbued with life and
links them to the transcendental reality

Huichol yarn paintings.
concealed in every natural phenomenon,
that plants, people and animals change into
each other, change their names and lose
their material form, in the way ice melts to
water to nourish the sea and can transform
itself from foam into dew, in the way
pilgrims with a frivolous cast of mind are
turned into rocks and peaks as eternal signs
of mindless arrogance.
"Magical" cures frequently occur, and
children witness all manner of "para¬
normal" events. In addition, they are
taught how to represent sacred writing
through needlework and weaving, stone-
carving, and the use of wax-coated boards
to form mosaics made of glass beads and
threads of yarn.
The level of expression of Huichol artists
depends on their grasp of myth and their
personal vision, which requires them to
enter into the spirit of the thing they per¬
ceive rather than see it as a separate object,
to the extent that a highly skilled maraa-
came is said to be capable of perceiving the
earth on which he stands as if it were a per¬
son and of conversing with it as Our
Mother Earth. The aim is to attain the stage
where we can see the interior of other
beings from within our own being, to com¬
mune from heart to heart.
However, in order to acquire the spiritual
heart or ¡yari which makes such vision pos¬
sible, the Huichol have to learn to control
their bodies by dominating their appetites
and purging themselves of the thoughts
which sully their consciousness and distort
their visionary powers. To see us with the
spirit, as the Ancestors see, the human
condition has to be transcended through
the nierika, which reflects all that exists on
both the spiritual and material planes. In
the words of José Benítez: "To achieve
nierika, we make sacrifices by fasting, by
not sleeping with our wives, by not think¬
ing evil thoughts but by thinking instead
only of achieving nierika, so that we may
learn something of the ¡yari and kupuri
(soul) of Our Mother Earth".
To obtain nierika, the Huichol must set
out on journeys which take them up to 500
kilometres in search of peyote, a species of
cactus growing in the desert from which
the psychotropic substance mescalin is
extracted. The peyote-seekers, known as
peyoteros, have to develop two personali¬
ties in the course of this long pilgrimage.
The first of these is the divine, inner
personality, which grows as the traveller
moves further away from his everyday
world. After many days' physical effort
spent travelling on foot without being able
to quench his thirst until nightfall, and in
the night-long vigils he often keeps around
l the communal fire, bodily needs take
second place and the way is paved for the
emergence of the spiritual sustenance that
is needed to replace the energy of the
body. The inner strength of the ¡yari sets
out to dismantle the facade of the outer
social being, and the pilgrim is reborn with
a new name consonant with his newly puri¬
fied and consecrated personality.
The second personality, .the external,
profane personality, is evolved to conceal
the intense inner reality from the destruc¬
tive public gaze. People who sacrifice all
bodily pleasures do not betray any sign of
the suffering they undergo in their spiritual
self-gestation. The peyoteros discover the
true names of the Ancestors as they follow
in their steps. They know that physical
reality is deceitful and absurd.
The peyotero knows that peyote con¬
tains the spirit of Our Elder Brother, the
Deer of the Sun (Tamatsi Kauyumarie), |
who immolated himself to give birth to the J

i peyote and now offers himself up again to
be consumed by the happy pilgrim. This is
the moment of authentic communion,
when the ecstatic peyotero comes directly
into contact with the gods, since Our Elder
Brother represents them all.
The invisible "fawn" speaks to the pil¬
grim from within. It proclaims the words of
the gods and, by causing him to see their
changing countenances, leaves some trace
of the memory of them in his iyari. But it is
a lifelong task to enter into ever-closer
communication with the gods and with the
spiritual essence of our being. In the course
of the first pilgrimage, only the outermost
veil of the mystery is drawn aside to reveal
a luminous and cosmic vision which cannot
be immediately assimilated but becomes a
tangible experience under the effects of the
peyote.
The peyoteros return after an absence of
several weeks or even months, having ful
filled their misson by bringing back the pre¬
cious consignment of peyote to be shared
in the sacred rites. Throughout their jour¬
ney, they have endeavoured to recreate
their language to accord with their new
vision. If we do not grasp the mystical and
poetic themes inspired by the complex Hui¬
chol ritual, we can only perceive the super¬
ficial aspect of this deep-rooted culture,
and will fail to understand the significance
of its highly original art.
Whenever Huichol art is really authentic,
it conveys much more to the Indian than
our own art now conveys to us. The obser¬
vations which Paul Westheim makes on
pre-Hispanic art are directly applicable to
Huichol art, when he says: "Reality is not
reproduced, it is created. It is the reality of
magical thought. It is not enough that the
artist should see; to describe the occult
mythical meaning of a phenomenon, his
vision is needed". Westheim has also
remarked how "Contemporary realism sets
out to reproduce the visible world, whereas
the aim of Meso-American realism is to
give visible substance to that which is invi¬
sible". It follows, therefore, that in order to
produce works of art in the Meso-American
sense, the creative artist has to live com¬
pletely immersed in a mythical vision if he is
to be capable of representing invisible rea¬
lity. Such a reality also has a "magical"
quality because the artist's creation must
both attract and be a home for the spiritual
energy of the human being or ancestral god
it represents.
The people who produce Huichol craft-
objects are often semi-urbanized Huichol
who have forsaken their work in the coamil
(fields of corn, cultivated on the hill-slopes
with a planting stick or pole, the coa), and
have severed their roots with the commu¬
nity. They fear the wrath of the Ancestors,
whom they do not wish to "know", either
The hypnotic rhythm of
music and dance is an
essential element in
Huichol rites and festivals.

celebrate the first fruits of
the harvest, a youth, top

long ceremony the younger

through the traditional sacrifices or
through the invocatory magic of ideo-
graphy. Craftsmen who produce objects
for sale therefore usually do not engage in
such activity out of "divine inspiration" or
as a form of prayer. In addition to the
"deculturation" from which they suffer,
they are part of a market system which
exploits them. Private traders have a mone¬
tary stake in the "decorative" products
which the dependent Indians bring to
them. Furthermore, since these objects
have very little artistic value, these middle¬
men display little interest in them. Natu¬
rally, neither the craftsmen's self-esteem
nor their desire to create is encouraged by
this trade, in which their work is treated
with contempt.
Nevertheless, some of these craftsmen
dedicate themselves to a more significant
task, seeking to re-assert the identity that
has been submerged in their enforced
anonymity and to recover the original sen¬
sibility which they have sacrificed to the
need to produce a large output in order to
survive.
Huichol art, like any great art, stems
from its creator's need to communicate
something that is important to him, some¬
thing which so moves his heart that it over¬
flows with faith or pain or joy, and has to
be exteriorized and communicated by con¬
verting feeling into action. The Huichol
craft paintings shown on our cover and on
the central colour pages are such acts of
communication which bear witness to
vibrant visions and to symbols that have
been organized in such a way as to crystal¬
lize an idea and convey a message.
The artistic gifts of the people who made
them, José Benítez Sánchez, Tutukila Car¬
rillo, Juan Ríos Martínez and Guadelupe
González Ríos, are rooted in the magical
and religious education they assi
milated so intensely in their youth. After
living and working among "civilized" peo¬
ple, these artists have turned again to their
ancestral culture, in a desire to reforge their
weakened links with it and fulfil the tradi¬
tional vows.
Their "yarn paintings" are made on
plywood boards covered with a thin layer
of viscous wax (campeche wax) which,
according to the Huichol, is produced by a
stingless bee. The wax is warmed in the
sun to make it malleable, and it is then
spread on the board by hand. In some
cases, the artist outlines the figures in the
wax. The brightly-coloured aniline-dyed
strands of yarn are then pressed into the
wax base, preferably one by one, with the
thumb-nail.
In symbolic terms, the picture is an ¡tari,
a bed on which the ancestral gods come to
rest, and also a field that is prepared for the k
planting of corn seeds, beans, squashes t
With his sparse provisions
and his ritual objects in the
basket on his back, a
Huichol pilgrim, or
peyotero, sets out in search
of the sacred peyote
cactus, a quest which will
take him up to 500
kilometres away, across
the Sierra Madre and the
San Luis Potosi desert. The
peyoteros set out in groups
of about a dozen men,
marching from dawn to
dusk in withdrawn silence
and enduring all kinds of
privations, under the
guidance of a priest or
shaman. No other
American Indian religious
manifestation is more
complex or more surprising
than this annual ritual
pilgrimage.

^and amaranth flowers [huaute). The edges
of the board are first prepared by making a
frame in three contrasting colours, and
these colours to some extent determine the
tones of the colours used inside the pic¬
ture. The outlines of the figures are then
formed before the background is finally
filled out in one or more colours.
These "yarn boards" first appeared on
the market in 1951, when Professor
Alfonso Soto Soria held an exhibition of
them in Guadalajara in Mexico. However,
the technique dates back to before the
Spanish Conquest, and it was used for reli¬
gious purposes in the form of small votive
offerings. Even today, prayers addressed to
the Ancestors are drawn on them.
Before yarn and glass beads came to be
used, the wax was used to mould small
bas-reliefs inside bowls made out of gourds
or on roughly circular pieces of wood,
while grains and seeds and cotton and
agave (pita) fibre were adhered to the wax.
All these materials are still used, but the
sharp contrasts and bright colour combina¬
tions that can be obtained with commercial
woollen yarn are more successful at evok¬
ing the visions conjured up under the
effects of peyote.
For Huichol artists in general and José
Benítez in particular, artistic creation is the
only effective means of bridging the deep
gap separating the subconscious and spiri¬
tual culture from the culture acquired from
living in modern Mexican civilization.
Through expressing his culture in ideo¬
graphs, the Huichol artist defends an in¬
digenous way of thinking which confers
meaning on his personal life. As a spokes¬
man for his culture, the Huichol artist iden¬
tifies himself with the mythical personages
participating in the drama of the pictures.
His inner conflict is exteriorized in the
figures in his pictures, which are full of
movement, magnetism and polarity, and
are held together almost as if by muscular
tension.
In any event, the expression of Huichol
artists is authentically personal and is
bound up with the experiences which have
had an impact on their hearts and memo¬
ries. For instance, there is a noticeable
change in the pictures which José Benítez
or Guadelupe Gonzalez produce on their
return from a pilgrimage. Their themes are
drawn from events connected with the
time of the year, such as the rainy season
or the time when the soil is prepared or the
crop is harvested, or refer to intimate hap¬
penings such as a disturbing dream, or the
birth or death of a child. Since the expe¬
rience which moves the inner being does
not repeat itself, each work is unique. The
pictures are a testimony to what the artist is
striving to see through his nierika, his inner
mirror which has been polished by his
sacred experience. The forms emerge from
the ¡yari, that heart which, according to the
Aztec tradition, is a "picturebook". The
worst possible calamity for the Huichol
would be for him to "lose the ¡yari' which
enables him to enter into contact with the
vast genetic memory stored in "Our Ances¬
tors", who are Nature itself.
This art form has arisen out of a combi¬
nation of commercial craftsmanship and
the peculiar genius of a few acculturated
Huichols who are nevertheless committed
to abiding by their ancestral traditions.
Their art has the virtue for us of being an
excellent means of making contact with
Huichol culture. It is a visual intermediary
which speaks to us through the common
denominator of beauty. Through it, the
Huichol artist succeeds in transmitting his
subjective vision to which we respond by
participating in its universal values through
its poetry and beauty. It is a modern art
form, stemming from the sense of identity
which the artist has of himself, and it has
been created with the idea of communica¬
ting with the non-Huichol public. That is
why the artists have insisted on our spelling
out the "grounds" on which their visual
execution is based. Their works are evoca¬
tions of sacred memories springing from
what the heart remembers of what their
grandfathers or the maraacame used to tell
them, which is now all stamped with the
imprint of their own experience. This is
why José Benítez stated in an interview
that, if his pictures were exhibited as mere
ornaments, lack of respect would be
shown to his "forebears".

The antiquity of Huichol culture can be
judged by the fact that the Huichol had
settled in the mountains of the present-
day Mexican States of Nayarit and Jalisco
even before the Aztecs arrived in the
Valley of Mexico. The Huichol are not a
homogeneous ethnic unit but a grouping
of three linguistically and culturally
distinct tribes. Left, three Huichol women
in richly ornamented festive dress. Below,
a young Huichol.
It is to be hoped that this authentic cul¬
ture with its striking beauty will be able to
follow its own course of independent and
"endogenous" development and maintain
its own integrity.
We must not lose sight the universal aes¬
thetic values and deep-rooted philosophy
of the last people to bear witness to the
complex aboriginal vision of Meso-
America.
We have seen how the urbanized Hui¬
chol living by the mestizo system of values,
are burdened by their awareness of a sup¬
posed inferiority and their despair at having
lost their roots. We have seen amongst
them the havoc wreaked by alcoholism,
crime and total destitution, and by illness
and destruction of the family unit.
When we speak of 'educating the
Indians, we should not forget that they
have been brought up in close harmony
with their environment, which they know
through and through, and with a deeply-
rooted system of rites and oral traditions.
What we should offer the Huichol, and
other indigenous groups throughout the
world, is a bicultural education, conceived
in part by "wise men" versed in their own
traditions.

The bewitched reality
of Haitian art
by René Depestre
RENE DEPESTRE, Haitian author, has publish¬
ed several volumes of poems, essays and fiction
including Un Arc-en-ciel pour l'Occident Chré¬
tien (published in English as A Rainbow for the
Christian West, University of Massachusetts
Press, 1977) and Poète à Cuba (shortly to appear
in English as Poet in CubaA He has collaborated
on two collective works produced by Unesco,
Africa en América Latina ("Africa in Latin Ame¬
rica") and América Latina en sus Ideas ("Latin
America through its Ideas") and is currently a
Unesco consultant. He has taught at the Univer¬
sity of Havana, Cuba, and at the University of
the West Indies at Mona, Kingston, Jamaica.
IF the word wonder can be taken to
denote everything that differs from the
natural and settled order of things,
then few countries have travelled so far, so
boldly and so gracefully as Haiti along a
road paved by wonders. A sense of won¬
der, in all its burgeoning, multifarious
forms, is one of the historic components of
the Haitian awareness.
Our people have their own unique way of
perceiving the relation between the mind
and the faculty of the imagination. Haitians
"find tongues in trees, books in the run
ning brooks, sermons in stones, and good
in everything". They hear the voice of the
gods in sun and rain, in shellfish, in river-
fish, in the fluttering wings of humming¬
birds and butterflies.
In response to the problems of slavery, a
complex fabric of correspondences, myths
and symbols evolved between society and
the world of nature in Haiti. As a result of
this process, which savours of the marvel¬
lous, the contradictions inherent in colonia¬
lism led not only to voodoo with its states

of auto-hypnosis but to dreamlike forms of
speech and behaviour in which the best
and the worst of human nature rub shoul¬
ders or else collide with unusual violence.
The "bewitched reality" of Haiti is a
maelstrom of currents which interpenetrate
and commingle: the natural and the super¬
natural, the picaresque, the erotic, the inef¬
fable, the absurd, the comic, the magical
and the entrancing. It has left its imprint on
religion and the political mysteries, on
orally transmitted folk-stories and literature
written in French or Haitian (Creole). It
lends an added enchantment to the
delights of love, dancing and music ; and it
has imbued the plastic arts with scintilla¬
ting magnificence.
One December morning in 1492, Christo¬
pher Columbus, dazzled by the beauty of
the Haitian bay, mountains and skyall
equally bluewhich stretched before his
eyes, exclaimed: £s una maravilla (It is a
marvel). With his cry of wonder on that
fateful day he annexed yet another be¬
jewelled island to the Spanish crown and at
the same time opened the horizons of Haiti
to the fantastic currents of universal his¬
tory. He named the new-found island Espa¬
ñola, later anglicized to Hispaniola. That
morning, although they did not know it,
the indigenous population of Haiti, the Ara-
waks, were transformed by the mysterious
workings of providence into the "Indians of
Hispaniola".
In the following decades, Europeans
practising the same semantic sleight-of-
hand would sweep across the "new
world". In the minds of these colonizers
the blacks were created by lumping to¬
gether Ibo, Bambara, Wolof, Peul, Man-
dingue and other African peoples stripped
of their identity. In equally specious fashion
(this time with promotion rather than
"denigration" in mind) the whites were
created from the peoples of Spain,
England, France, Portugal and Holland,
who carved up between them the Americas
(another blanket-expression which the
colonizers produced like a rabbit from a
magician's hat).
Later, the effervescence of procreation
in these regions brought forth a kaleido- .
scope of mulattoes, mestizos, quadroons^
One of the great heroes of the Haitian struggle for independence,
Toussaint Louverture was arrested on the orders of Napoleon and
deported to France where he died a prisoner at the Fort de Joux in the
French Jura. This engraving of his final moments is the work of an
unknown artist of the period.

and Whites and in their turn gave shape, in
misfortune and fantasy, to a spectrum of
conflicts and colours so breathtaking as to
outdo a rainbow.
From then on the history of Haiti is in¬
separable from a kind of popular, baroque
surrealism which has displayed itself with
equal exuberance in collective events and
individual lives. Between 1492 and 1697,
when the Treaty of Ryswick established a
modus vivendi between the French and
Spanish empires on the island of Hispa¬
niola by dividing it into two separate colo¬
nies, a world of skirmishing buccaneers
was brought to life in a mass of legends
and tales, thousands of improbable yarns
were spun of corsairs and freebooters, and
the resistance and genocide of the Indian
tribes of the Caribbean were recorded in
many a hair-raising story.
This imaginative ferment was part and
parcel of the economic exploits achieved
Speaking of Haitian painting, the artist
Philippe-Auguste Salnave declared: "In my
opinion, all these wonders emerging from
the heads of men with no culture, no
technique and with no guidance are the
fruit of pure imagination." Salnave himself
took up painting at the age of fifty-two.

of a traffic in human beings which filled the
world with unprecedented sound and fury.
While the trade in slaves (known as
"pieces of India") and ebony wood was
being practised in conditions which defy
belief, the prodigies which mark the history
of Haiti did not die out in the cruel and
monotonous regime of forced labour; in¬
stead they found new nourishment in the
resistance of the slaves to their terrible fate.
Reduced to the zombie-like state of biologi¬
cal fuel, the Africans and their descendants
drew from the insecurity which permeated
every fibre of their being a dynamism ena¬
bling them to reconstitute the dismantled
foundations of their identity. The slaves
withstood the pressures of an evangelism
armed with whips, branding irons and
racism, and transmuted their distress into
creativity.
Instead of passively assimilating the
lessons of the colonial catechism, they
syncretized them with the religious beliefs
of the Yoruba, Fanti-Ashanti, Bantu,
Congo and Fon, to which their memory
and collective imagination added new func¬
tions linked to the affective and moral
needs of the American plantations. Thanks
to this mutation of identity, the mytholo¬
gies and traditions of the African past
acquired a truly astonishing force, express¬
ed in new norms of behaviour, highly ori¬
ginal ways of feeling, dreaming,
"imagining", thinking and acting. The sla¬
ves transformed the contradictory patterns
of their double, and even triple, cultural
heritage (tugged as they were between
Africa, Europe and the Amerindian world)
into new models with the dynamism to
mould through suffering a national cons¬
ciousness and to nourish the roots of "Hai-
tianity". At the end of the 18th century
voodoo was for Haitians a psychodrama, a
trancelike system of psychological release;
with the coming of the Men of the En¬
lightenment who led Haiti's war of inde¬
pendence, it was turned into a movement
for mobilizing the masses.
The struggle for emancipation began on
19 August 1791 with a ceremony famed in
the annals of Haitian history. In a scene
worthy of the imagination of a Gothick
novelist, bands of runaway slaves gathered
at Bois-Caiman ("Crocodile Wood") in res¬
ponse to a call from their leader Boukman
and swore allegiance to their cause in the
midst of a violent thunderstorm. Buffeted
by gusts of wind and rain, the insurgents
drank the blood of a freshly-killed pig in an
ecstatic frenzy, while the lightning-flashes
affixed a cosmic signature to their pledge
to win freedom or to die. From that night
until the Haitians won the decisive battle of
Vertieres on 18 November 1803, the island
lived through a holocaust of fire and blood.
During their epic resistance to slavery, no
feat of prowess, no sacrifice was too great
for the oppressed masses as they fought to
achieve the first victory of the decoloniza¬
tion movement in world history.
All the leaders of this pioneer movement,
both the circumstances of their chequered
lives and the tragic circumstances of their
deaths, still live in the Haitian imagination.
The first of them, a one-armed prophet
named Mackandal, held the plantations in
the north of the island in a four-year grip of
terror and fascination, until he was captu¬
red and burned alive on a square in Cap-
Français. Long after his execution on 20
January 1758 his spirit would be discerned
in a "walking tree" or in the clairvoyance of
a domestic animal or a bird of prey.
After Boukman, the black giant of Bois-
Caiman, came Toussaint Louverture, the
great figure who navigated the storms from
which Haiti was born. His singleminded
drive for the emancipation of the slaves of
San Domingo was proof against every
blandishment. Then, at the height of his
grandeur, on the brink of realizing this
grand design, he was captured on Napo¬
leon's orders and shipped to captivity in
France. Stricken with nostalgia, he would
die one glacial morning, a prisoner in a
fortress on a Jura hilltop.
Under his inspired successor. Dessali¬
nes, new roots grew on the tree of liberty
which had been buried beneath distant
foreign snows with the lost visions of Tous¬
saint Loüverture. Then, only two years
after welding together a nation. Dessalines
himself fell beneath a hail of Haitian bullets
at Pont-Rouge. The last act of this Passion
of the Tropics was accomplished when his
remains, scattered about the murder site,
were gathered and buried one dark night by
an old, half-crazed woman mumbling a dis¬
tracted incantation.
Another father of Haiti, Henri Christo¬
phe, who has been called the "Peter the
Great of the Sun", fanned even higher the
flames of the legends whose glow had kept
the island alive. After his coronation, he
pierced one door in his palace of Sans¬
souci for every day of the year, and built
on a mountain peak the Citadelle Lafer-
rière, the fortress which André Malraux so
aptly described as "the Saturnian citadel,
never attacked, never inhabited except by

, the zombies of those who built it". One day
in 1942, in a Port-au-Prince cinema, I first
heard the Cuban novelist Alejo Carpentier
reflect on these haunted ruins in a lecture
which brought an incandescent glow to
their desolate magnificence. Carpentier
spoke in tones which echoed those of
Pablo Neruda when he set eyes on the ver¬
tiginous site of Macchu Picchu in Peru. The
Cuban master had experienced the revela¬
tion of America's bewitched reality, which
would later enrich his novels, especially his
masterpiece A Kingdom of This World,
which is directly inspired by the crazy geo¬
metry and the dreams which King Christo¬
phe in his glory transformed into reality.
Christophe was followed by President
Alexandre Petion, who was catapulted
from a humdrum existence into a grandiose
dream when the fraternal aid he granted to
the fugitive Simon Bolivar in 1815 led
directly to the battle of Ayacucho (1824),
the culminating point in Latin America's
struggle for independence from Spain. It is
to Petion's credit that, by extending the
hand of welcome to Bolivar, Haiti (often
despised as a poor relation of the Hispano-
American world) became the first country
in the Western hemisphere to turn to its
neighbours the visionary countenance of
the solidarity of peoples.
A country which entered the history of
the Americas proffering such fantastic gifts
might have expected to see its promise
blossom quickly in art and literature. That
this did not come about is one of the para¬
doxes of our story. The stranglehold of
colonialism had not been fully loosed from
Haiti's social structure and colonialist atti¬
tudes returned in force to influence the
lives and aesthetic canons of the indige¬
nous intelligentsia. For many years this
recrudescence of ideas that had been incul¬
cated in servitude froze the sense of won¬
der that could have revitalized our culture.
Our first creative artists in the nineteenth
century were parodists of literary theories
and concepts totally at odds with the reality
of Haitian life and with the dreams that the
popular consciousness had moulded into
the myths, fables and stories of oral litera¬
ture. Haiti's search for an artistic identity
really began with the poetry of Oswald
Durand and Masillon Coicou, and with the
prose of Frédéric Marcelin, Justin Lhéris-
son, Fernand Hibbert and Antoine Inno¬
cent. These were the men who first began
to tap the wellsprings of an original Haitian
creativity.
But it was not until 1927, when Haiti was
under a military occupation, that another
generation gave this hitherto tentative
search for identity a definite direction
among the refreshing waves of wonder and
realism. In 1928 the ethnologist Jean Price-
Mars published his Ainsi Parla L'Oncle, a
classic study of Afro-Haitian folklore which
signalled the emergence of a new form of
vindication of our idiosyncrasies and natio¬
nal values. Men like Normil Sylvain, Jac¬
ques Roumain, Emile Roumer, Carl
Brouard, Léon Laleau and Philippe Thoby-
Marcelin began to devise new ways of
expressing in literary form what it feels like
to be a Haitian and the difficulties Haitians
encounter in their lives.
Other distinguished members of this
group of pioneers included Jean-F. Brierre,
F. Morisseau-Leroy, Roussan Camille and
Clément Magloire Saint-Aude. Yet another
blaze of imagination brought to the fore
writers such as René Balance, Paul Lara-
que, Edris Saint-Amand, Jacques Stephen
Alexis, Marie Chauvet, Roger Dorsinville,
ques Stephen Alexis. In Gouverneurs de la
Rosée (published in English as Masters of
the Dew), Compère Général So/eil and
other equally powerful works, they have
woven a rich allegorical tapestry of the
struggle for a better life in Haiti, evoking
the tenderness and beauty of everyday life
through an inspired mingling of the imagi¬
nary and the real. Alexis has defined the
significance of the Haitian quest for identity
through literature: "What is the marvel¬
lous", he has written, "if not the imagery in
which a people enwraps its experience and
reflects its conception of the world and of
life, its faith, hope, confidence in mankind
and in a high form of justice..." In a stirring
manifesto he has called on his country's
poets, novelists, musicians and painters to
use "the treasury of stories and legends, all
forms of musical, choreographic and plas¬
tic symbolism, and all the forms of Haitian
popular art, to help the nation to solve its
Open-air Market, by Casimir Laurent, one of Haiti's best known painters.
Lucien Lemoine and others, who showed
both in poetry and in fiction "the possibility
of a dynamic integration of the marvellous
into realism". The same ferment of lyricism
is still at work in the astonishing composi¬
tions of writers such as Davertige, Anthony
Phelps, Georges Castera junior. Serge
Legagneur, Franck Etienne, Jean-Richard
Laforest, Emile Ollivier, René Philoctète
and others. Meanwhile, the members of
the rising generation of creators publish
their candid reflections in the columns of a
magazine called Le Petit Samedi Soir.
And so in the past half century Haiti has
abandoned the imitation and parody of
imported aesthetic systems and ventured
boldly along the path to truths and myste¬
ries illuminated by its own inner flame and
sustained by its own historic roots.
The two uncontested masters of this
renaissance are Jacques Roumain and Jac-
problems and acomplish the tasks which lie
before it".
So far it is the painters of Haiti who have
realized the aesthetic programme outlined
by Roumain and Alexis with the greatest
rigour and panache. They have miracu¬
lously succeeded in expressing in paint the
Haitian's extraordinary sense of rhythm
and through a frenzy of shapes and colours
have ushered the Haitian consciousness to
the incandescent centre of its identity.
One day at the end of 1943, our English ,
teacher at the Lycée Pétion, a North Ameri¬
can of Dutch origin named DeWitt Peters,
bade farewell to my class. He was giving up
teaching in order to found an art centre at
Port-au-Prince, a seemingly overambitious
project which came to fruition on 14 May
1944 with the opening of the first exhi¬
bition of Haitian painting ever to be organi¬
zed. At last the realism and enchantment of

Haiti had found their language and inspira¬
tion in the visual arts! Painters steeped in
the workings of the popular imagination
and versed in the vicissitudes of the "Hai¬
tian dream" seized on the humble tales that
delight our children and began to transform
them into expanses of radiant colours and
forms. Through works that were an incan¬
tation to justice and showed a fine dis¬
regard for academic trends and rhetoric,
the droplet of dew that had trembled for
centuries from the leaf of suffering Haiti
became an event in the history of world art.
Some of the leading figures in this move¬
ment, which is less "naive" than a super¬
ficial acquaintance with it may suggest,
include: Hector Hyppolite, Philomé and
Sénèque Obin, Rigaud Benoit, Castera
Bazile, Wilson Bigaud, Enguerrand Gour-
gue, Louverture Poisson, Préfète Duffaut,
Micius Stéphane, André Pierre, Philippe
Auguste, Saint-Brice, Jasmin Joseph,
Dieudonné Cédor, Antonio Joseph, Luck-
ner Lazare, Luce Turnier, Max Pinchinat, J.
Chéry, Bernard Wa, Davertige, Léontus,
Roland Dorcély, Minium Cayemitte. But
such a list is far from complete; the dazz¬
ling skills of many other hands have helped
to beckon in Haiti's new dawn of creation.
It may be that the creative artists of our
country, and especially our naive painters,
possess gifts which enable them to span
the animal, vegetable and mineral worlds
as well as society's most secret dreams; it
has been granted to them to express with
grace and integrity everything in the
entranced, entrancing Caribbean islands
that enlightens and delights the eyes and
heart and creates a world in which human
relations can flourish forever in poetry and
dignity.

Restoring
King
Christophe's
domain
Following the defeat of the French at the
battle of Vertieres, Haiti proclaimed its
independence on 1 January 1804, thus
becoming the first independent black
republic. One of the victorious rebel
commanders. General Henry Christophe
(1767-1820), began the construction of a
vast citadel on the Pic de Laferrière,
twenty-eight kilometres south-east of Cap
Haïtien. Seven years later, Henry
Christophe proclaimed himself king and
began construction of the Palace of Sans
Souci. This imposing building, surrounded
by magnificent gardens, housed the royal
family and the principal administrative
officers of the kingdom. In 1820, half
paralysed by a stroke and faced with an
insurrection, Christophe committed
suicide. The palace was sacked by the
rebels and, in 1842, both the palace and
the citadel were heavily damaged in an
earthquake. In 1977, the Haitian
Government decided to restore the palace
and the citadel and to create a national
historic park. Unesco is contributing to
the preservation of these important
historic and cultural monuments by
engaging experts to study the original lay¬
out of the buildings and to advise on their
protection, preservation and restoration.

A
worlcTs-eye
view
of
history
by Geoffrey Barraclough
WHEN I was asked, seven years
ago, to plan and edit a new Atlas
of World History (1), the chal¬
lenge was too exciting to resist. The great
events of our generation the end of the
colonial empires, the Chinese revolution,
the emancipation of Asia and Africa, the
changed position of Europe in the
world had completely altered our vision
of the past.
Beginning in 1963 with the six-volume
Unesco History of Mankind, a number of
historians had attempted to describe the
GEOFFREY BARRACLOUGH, noted medieval
historian, is a former Chichele Professor of
Modern History and Fellow ofAll Souls College,
Oxford. He is the author of several important
historical works including: An Introduction to
Contemporary History, 1964, Eastern and Wes¬
tern Europe in the Middle Ages, 1970, The Cruci¬
ble of Europe, 1976.
(1) The Times Atlas of World History, of which
Professor Barraclough is the general editor, is
published by Times Books Limited, London. Edi¬
tions of the Atlas in German, Italian, French,
Dutch and Japanese are to be published during
1979.
new dimensions. But could they be shown
visually and graphically? Could we use
maps in such a way as to convey the drama
of human history to a generation which is
at least as responsive to the impact of
visual appeal as to the written word ? That
was the challenge, and it was a formidable
one.
If we were to succeed, two things were
necessary. First, we had to take a com¬
pletely new look at the course and content
of history, think again about what was
important and worth recording and what
was not. Second, we had to translate these
ideas into reality, and in the end everything
depended upon effective presentation and
imaginative use of the mapmaker's art.
Let me give just one example of the out¬
come of this marriage of new ideas with
flexible' and resourceful mapmaking. I
announced, rather arbitrarily, at one stage
that our map of "The Expansion of Islam"
should be centred on Mecca, since Mecca
is the heart of the Islamic world. When the
finished product came to hand, no one \
could have been more astonished than 1. 1

<![CDATA[
My whole inherited perception of the
expansion of Islam was changed. I saw
immediately that its progress in the east
was far more significant than its advance in
the west, and that the famous battle of Poi¬
tiers (famous in west European tradition),
when the westward thrust was halted by
theFrankish ruler Charles Martel, was in
Islamic eyes little more than a minor border
incident.
Anyone who looks through the Atlas will
find a score of other plates where things
which seemed familiar suddenly take on a
new dimension as a result of the map-
maker's skills. What more can one ask of
an atlas of world history? Our object was
not to lay out an established body of know¬
ledge so much as to stimulate the reader's
imagination and make him or her think
again about the meaning of mankind's pro¬
gress through the ages.
So far as my own share in shaping the
new Atlas was concerned, my primary
taskwhich for long I thought despairingly
was impossible was to subsume the
whole of human history in 127 large,
double-spread plates. I had, to begin with,
a better idea of what I did not want than of
what I did. First of all, I knew that no histo¬
rical atlas which makes sense in today's
world could concentrate on Europe in the
way that most conventional historical
atlases do.
My first resolve, therefore, was to hold a
balance between the continentswithout
bending over, in an excess of zeal, to mini¬
mize the European impact. Secondly, I
knew that the maps must show the dyna¬
mism of history; they must not just be sta¬
tic pictures of particular situations at parti¬
cular times. Thirdly, it was to be an atlas of
world history, not just a compilation of
national histories. And finally, it was to be
an historical atlasthat is to say, it was to
pay attention to what was important then
(even if 5,000 or 10,000 years ago) and not
merely to what is important now. That
meant, for example, that we were determi¬
ned to give fair weight to civilizations for
example, the great Ottoman civilization or
Moghul India or the Byzantine
empirewhich no longer seem to be of
decisive importance today.
On the other hand, we passed over many
things that loom large in national histories.
One example, for which we have been criti
cized, is that, though the atlas was first
published in London, it nowhere specifi¬
cally mentions the Battle of Hastings,
which looms so large as a turning point in
the history of England. Our reply would be
that we are not dealing with English his¬
tory, but with world history.
It was, of course, easier to decide what
to exclude than what to include. Back in
1972, I spent some months studying earlier
historical atlases. Then, at the beginning of
1973, I set out to draw up a positive plan. I
began with no preconceived scheme of
world history. It seemed to me important to
emphasize that there were, from a surp¬
risingly early date, connexions between dif¬
ferent civilizations and different cultural
groups (hence our map showing the "Silk
Route" linking China with the eastern
Mediterranean across central Asia). But we
took great care not to suggest that there is
a single thread or a single historical process
uniting all mankind; indeed, no one who
seriously considers the history of Austral¬
asia or of sub-Saharan Africa could sub¬
scribe to that view. The Atlas, or at least
the thinking behind it, is pragmatic, not
ideological, and certainly not schematic.
Nevertheless it is also true (as Marx long
ago pointed out) that no attempt to take an
overall view of world history can ever be
"devoid of premises." Looking back in
retrospect, I think that two main premises
underlie the plan of the Atlas. The first is
that the conventional view which treats the
four hundred years between Vasco de
Gama and Lenin as (in the words of the
well known English historian, E.H. Carr)
"the centre-piece of universal history, and
everything else as peripheral to it", is "an
unhappy distortion of perspective." Hence
our endeavour to hold a balance between
the seven different periods or ages into
which we have divided the Atlas. The
second is that a central theme of human
history, common to the whole of mankind,
is the struggle to exert control over nature
and to extract a livelihood from a grudging
environment. This struggle is fundamental
because it gives rise to different political
systems and intellectual responses.
It was important also in planning our pro¬
ject because it provided us with a criterion
for deciding what is and what is not signifi¬
cant from a global perspective, and in parti¬
cular because it shifted the emphasis from
events on a national or local level, which
affect only one people or ethnic group, to
broad movements for example, the Neo¬
lithic agricultural revolution which in¬
volve whole civilizations or the whole of
mankind.
This is why, instead of treating the com¬
plex details of the political history of early
feudal Europe, we devoted instead a whole
plate to its economic recovery between 950
and 1 1 50, a recovery which laid the founda¬
tions for the great age of cathedrals and
universities. This seemed to us the more
important aspect, both in the short run and
in the long run.
Within these broad general guidelines
the principles upon which the Atlas was
constructed were, in theory at least, very
simple. The main one, as already indicated,
was to avoid "Eurocentrism." Europe in
the thirteenth and fourteenth centuries, as
Kwame Nkrumah frequently insisted, was a

backwater compared with Mali and Song-
hai; and so we gave as much prominence
to the university of Timbuktu as to the uni¬
versities of Paris and Oxford. It is perhaps
significant that six whole plates (or seven if
the plate on ancient Egypt is in¬
cluded) out of 127 are devoted exclusively
to Africa, apart, of course, from innumera¬
ble plates where north Africa appears as
part of the Roman empire or of the Islamic
world. It can safely be said that no other
atlas of world history devotes so much
attention to Africa before the coming of the
Europeans; and that may be regarded as
characteristic of our effort to take a truly
global view of history.
Nevertheless we have avoided novelty
for novelty's sake, and have not eschewed
more conventional maps. People want
them and need them. For example, we
have included a map of the rise of the Fran-
kish kingdom, a conventional subject in all
European histories. But we have balanced
it by a map of the Eurasian world in 814
which shows how relatively unimportant
the Frankish empire was at that time by
comparison with T'ang China, the Abbasid
caliphate, and the East Roman empire of
Byzantium.
Every atlas has a map of the westward
expansion of the United States between
1785 and 1890. But we have balanced it by
a map which looks at the expansion of the
white settlers through the eyes of the abo¬
riginal Indian population, for whom expan¬
sion became contraction, prosperity be¬
came poverty, and liberty became confine¬
ment. We have included the usual map of
European imperialism between 1890 and
1914; it was on all counts a major event in
world history. But we have complemented
it by a plate on "The Anti-Colonial Reac¬
tion" in Asia and Africa between 1881 and
1917, which I believe is unique. That is an¬
other way in which we have tried to put
familiar events into a new perspective.
At the end of the account, am I satisfied
with the Atlas as it stands? The answer is
both "Yes" and "No". I know that it is not
perfect. The task of compression the
almost impossible task of getting the whole
of human history from the Ice Age to the
uneasy, divided world of poor nations and
rich nations in which we live, into the com¬
pass of 127 plates probably pre¬
cluded perfection.
Looking back after the event, I am aware
that certain peoples for example, the
Welsh have probably received less atten¬
tion than they might rightly claim. The
same, perhaps, may be true of Québécois,
Kurds, Armenians, and doubtless others.
Nevertheless, we believe that the Atlas
sets a new standard and we hope that it
fulfils its object of doing justice, without
prejudice or favour, to the achievements of
all peoples, in all ages and in all quarters of
the globe.

Roger Caillois
Writers and scholars throughout the
world we're saddened to learn that
Roger Caillois had died in Paris on 21
December 1978. Not only in France,
where his work and interests in socio¬
logy, surrealism, criticism and litera¬
ture had taken him to the Académie
Française, but in Japan and in Brazil
(whose Academy had elected him to
the seat previously occupied by André
Malraux) and in Argentina, where he
had many friends whose thought and
work he made known in Europe, his
loss was keenly felt in literary and
intellectual circles.
Caillois' curiosity was yoked to a
rich store of knowledge spanning a
wide variety of intellectual disciplines.
He was interested in dreams and
games, poetry and festivities, masks,
butterflies and stones. Semantics and
demography, epistemology and politi¬
cal economy also captured his atten¬
tion. Director of Unesco's Division of
Cultural Development (1968-1971) and
Editor for twenty-six years of the inter¬
national review of humanistic studies
Diogenes, he was particularly concer¬
ned to provide, through an illustrated
book on human rights, and through
the Unesco collection of translations
of representative works of world lit¬
erature, a picture of different world
cultures, of human aspirations, and of
the achievements of the human mind.
What made Roger Caillois unique
was his struggle against dispersion.
This led him to reject the exclusive,
and in his view abusive, compartmen-
talization of pure scholarship which
led ultimately to neglect of the point of
reference, the touchstone of all
sciences mankind. This is where his
creative imagination came in. To what
had been a series of mutual monolo¬
gues delivered from "watertight com¬
partments" by specialists who stres¬
sed the irreducible originality of their
fields, Caillois introduced an element,
if not of unity, at least of confronta¬
tion. In place of the excessive
specialization of such compartmen¬
talized research, he went beyond the
idea of interdisciplinarity and promo¬
ted what he called the diagonal scien¬
ces: this meant, not the analysis of a
single phenomenon using the specific
approaches of each science (Caillois
took the example of a currency stu¬
died in turn, but separately, by such
specialists as a chemist, a metal-
founder, an historian, an economist
and an aesthetician) but the appear¬
ance of a new form of co-operative
and open-minded understanding at
different levels. In his last published
works, he went very far with this gran¬
diose view of science and the uni¬
verse, to the extent of establishing for¬
mal and hidden links between stones
and dreams, inert and living matter,
between free-ranging imagination and
scientific rigour.
This boldness, this temerity which
he himself sometimes described as
"demented", was always controlled
with implacable rigour.
The disappearance of Roger Caillois
is a loss which the human sciences in
our times can ill afford.

The visionary artists
of Haiti
The extraordinary renaissance of Haitian art that blossomed in the 1940s,
producing artists such as Wilson Bigaud and Jasmin Joseph (see colour page
22), continues in full flower with younger painters such as Audes Saul whose
work "Bananas" is reproduced below. The sudden emergence of this stream of
creative power reveals the very essence of the Haitian people, their origins,
their education, their traditions and their legends.
