Appeal
Addressed to Unesco's Member States
by the International Consultative Liaison Committee
for Literacy
T,he urgency and vital importance of one of the essential tasks
of our age elimination of the gap between the have and the have-not
countries are daily becoming increasingly apparent throughout the world. It is
also tragically obvious that one thousand million adults can neither contribute
effectively to nor profit fully from development. It is for our generation the gene¬
ration of the twentieth century to carry out this gigantic and vital task, the historic
significance of which will certainly be made abundantly clear during the celebration
of Human Rights Year.
The World Congress of Ministers of Education on the Eradication of Illiteracy,
held in Teheran from 8 to 19 September 1965, agreed that the scourge of illiteracy
affected all mankind, violated the dignity of man, impeded development and was an
obstacle to international understanding. It strongly emphasized the decisive impor¬
tance, for the eradication of illiteracy, of international solidarity and co-operation.
Although the tragic disproportion between the resources needed for this task
and those available has only been further confirmed since the Teheran Congress,
some grounds for hope have none the less emerged.
The appeals of the supreme spiritual and moral leaders of the international
community, the determination of many governments to devote great efforts to the
cause of literacy, the visible signs of international solidarity, that sacred duty which
this task imposes upon all countries, and the encouraging start to Unesco's World
Literacy Programme all these things open up new prospects and inspire confidence
and hope.
On behalf of Unesco's International Consultative Liaison Committee for
Literacy, I solemnly invite the governments of Member States of Unesco to follow
the example of those States which have already made voluntary contributions to
Unesco's Special Account for literacy work and to appeal to public opinion in their
countries with a view to fostering and encouraging action by public and private
organizations to increase that contribution.
The committee believes that the time is now ripe for the launching of a vast
movement of international solidarity that will contribute decisively to the eradication
of illiteracy throughout the world and will make it possible in the wake of the great
democratic gains of the nineteenth and twentieth centuries, to ensure access to edu¬
cation for all men.
The committee is sure that all governments will wish to contribute to the
success of an entreprise of such capital importance for human dignity and progress.

In this issue the "Unesco Courier"
reviews recent developments in the
struggle against illiteracy, the progress
achieved to date and the enormous
problems that still remain to be over¬
come in many parts of the world.
Unesco's Director-General recently de¬
nounced: "the shortcomings of a world
in which there are a thousand million
illiterates or semi-illiterates . . . The
struggle against an evil of such pro¬
portions must be carried on co-opera¬
tively by the whole of mankind."

he word "illiterate" has
become synonymous with "ignorant"
in common speech and even, some¬
times, has a derogatory sense; but
most illiterates are in no way ashamed
of their situation. Being illiterate, they
are not conscious of it, nor of what it
means to someone who is not. That
is why few feel any need to change.
According to certain surveys, 60 and
FERNANDO VALDERRAMA, of Unesco's
Literacy Division, was for 20 years principal
adviser on education in northern Morocco
Born in Spam, he is an authority on Islam,
and was professor of sociology in this field
at the University of Madrid and professor
of Arabic at the School of Higher Commer¬
cial Studies in Madrid The author present¬
ed a longer study on this question to the
6th World Congress on Sociology, m Evian
(France) in September 1966.
In the market-place of a
small Brazilian town, a
bookseller, microphone
in hand, reads to
an attentive group of
townsfolk. Most of them,
young as well as old, are
illiterate. Everyone
pays to hear the stories
read. There are more
than 700 million persons
in the world whose only
access to knowledge is
through the spoken word.
even 70 per cent of illiterates have no
wish to learn to read, and yet in some
countries the illiterate is not a full citi¬
zen and has no right to vote. He is
considered as living on the fringe of
society.
Illiteracy has come to be regarded as
a sickness or plague and we have
reached the point where illiterates
almost appear to belong to a hostile
group which must be wiped out. This
is shown by the extensive military ter¬
minology now used in connexion with
illiteracy. We speak of "campaign"
and "fight" against illiteracy; of "stra¬
tegy" and a "mass attack"; "liquidat¬
ing" or "eliminating" illiteracy and of
making the final "assault".
Presented in this way, the illiterate
bears more resemblance to a hunted
animal than a human being who should
be helped to better himself and be
come more useful to society. It might
be wiser to abolish these negative
expressions and to replace them by
others with a more positive and opti¬
mistic connotation.
A new idea is beginning slowly to
spread that of the "society outside
the written word." According to .this
notion, isolated social groups are illi¬
terate because they live "outside the
written word", and not because they
are ignorant.
The illiterate is not ignorant. In the
first place, all adults have some prac¬
tical experience of life, especially the
older ones who have had to look for
work, to feed a family and to assume
responsibilities however small.
A good example is the adult illite¬
rate's understanding of arithmetic.
When a child begins to learn arithme¬
tic, he can hardly count to ten without

making mistakes and even this succes¬
sion of figures represents nothing con¬
crete or practical to him.
At school he learns to count, to
write figures, to do abstract sums and
then to apply what he has learned
through problems. Arithmetic, like
other subjects, introduces him to a
new, unknown world which gradually
becomes familiar not only through his
classes but through the fact of grow¬
ing up.
For the illiterate adult, the question
is quite different. He has no general
culture; geography, history and science
are part of another world. Yet he
has perhaps sold, and certainly bought,
a number of things. He has received
money for his work and had to check
that the sum was correct. Conse¬
quently he has used rudimentary me¬
thods to solve simple sums. He has
made payments and been obliged to
calculate first; he has made plans on
the basis of money he owned or hoped
to earn; he might have measured a
piece of land.
In short, he has already lived "eco¬
nomic problems" and when he joins a
literacy class, arithmetic is not new to
him. True, he does not know written
figures, but as soon as he learns to
write 8, he will be able to give the
figure its true practical value.
While he may be illiterate, he prob¬
ably knows a trade; he is a farm la¬
bourer, blacksmith or carpenter and
in his own field knows more than an
educated person who is foreign to the
trade.
On the other hand, he is generally
distrustful of innovations and sceptical
when faced with new or "foreign"
ideas and skills, and he may well adopt
this attitude towards literacy. His tra¬
ditional way of life is familiar to him
and has so far proved successful to a
certain extent.
An old woman in a little village once
said: "You think you have to teach
us everything. If, as you say, we had
eaten unhealthy food all this time, cul¬
tivated our fields wrongly and brought
up our children against all the rules,
we would all be dead by now. But
as you can see, we are not."
The rural inhabitant, for whom tra¬
dition goes deeper, distrusts the city
dweller. For him, superstitions often
mixed with religious beliefs form a
solid basis to social life and discou¬
rage change. If nothing exceptional
occurs (like the opening up of a mine,
the building of a road, the introduction
of a new industry), life keeps on its
monotonous way. But if change

Right, even a matchbox can
help to promote literacy.
These are used as teaching
aids in Ecuador. On each
is the picture of an object,
its name and the first letter
of the name: "I" as in
"luna" (moon); "e" as in
"escoba" (broom); "s" as in
"sapo" (frog) and so on.
Left, a farm worker in
Ecuador confirms the truth
of the saying "never too
old to learn". He has joined
one of the classes of a
functional literacy pilot
project run for 16,000 adults
in the Milagro area
of Ecuador.
In all parts of the world,
literacy campaigns are today
reaching hundreds of
thousands of adults who
live "outside the

occurs and the small farmer at last
sees in it something of use to him
and his family, his little rural society
will have found a powerful motivation.
If the rural dweller learns to read,
he has no written material on which to
apply his learning. There are isolated
villages where streets when they
exist have no name and not a single
signpost is to be found, not even at
the entrance to the village. No news¬
papers reach them and the villagers
lead a monotonous existence, bereft
of hope or ambition.
If the city dweller learns to read he
will find written material everywhere
in shop windows, on walls and posters;
the town itself is a wide open book
where the new literate can continue his
education.
In any country illiterates can be
divided into four main groups:
Those who live in towns or urban
centres and who, of necessity, are in
contact with others to whom reading is
commonplace (fellow workers in a fac¬
tory, soldiers in the same regiment,
etc.) These illiterates know the
advantage of being able to read and
write; they know that if they acquire
this knowledge, their situation will
improve, and so it is not difficult for
them to make the necessary effort.
Illiterates in this group hardly need any
encouragement at all. They are al¬
ready convinced and only wait for an
opportunity to be offered to them.
A second group consists of illite¬
rates living in an urban or rural area
where a community development pro¬
gramme is being carried out or where
an agricultural or industrial concern
has just been established. Here they
need to be stimulated, because for
them the relationship between work
and the value of knowing how to read
and write has not yet been established.
In such a totally or largely illiterate
community, the establishment of a de¬
velopment nucleus has created a new
atmosphere which needs to be defined
and evaluated frankly. It is up to the
leaders of the new industry or busi¬
ness concern to weigh the advantages
of having literate workers whose out¬
put is far higher than that of illiterate
workers and to co-operate in helping
them.
If these leaders act in good faith, it
will not be difficult to shake off the
long-standing inertia through intelligent
and well-planned action and to show
the workers the advantages they would
gain from learning to read and write.
The third group consists of non-sala¬
ried farm workers who are paid in
kind. Some countries have consider¬
able numbers of these underprivileged
workers in whose welfare their em¬
ployers show no interest. Without
sufficient administrative power, the
authorities find it difficult to persuade
employers to create an atmosphere
conducive to the education and devel¬
opment of their workers. Given the
facilities, however, this group could
soon reach a more advanced stage in
society and would be m a position to
increase and improve production.
The last group of illiterates belong
to isolated communities. They live in
areas with no means of communication
and where the written word is practi¬
cally unknown. Here, any attempt at
literacy teaching must be accom¬
panied by a change in the economic
and social structure. To shake off the
centuries-old lethargy and to hold out
]]>

to these people the hope of a new life,
new interests, motivation and stimulus
have to be created. This is an extre¬
mely difficult task.
Though far from exhaustive, this
classification could form the basis for
the planning of a literacy programme.
Those responsible would need to have
sufficient information concerning the
illiterates belonging to each group
their whereabouts number, sex and de¬
gree of illiteracy.
Top priority should be given to the
first two groups. With inhabitants
of towns and urban areas, the work of
stimulation and motivation is so easy
that literacy teaching can begin without
any preliminary stage. Once the illi¬
terates in these groups have learned
to read they will make rapid strides, as
towns are full of reading matter.
Other courses should help them to
improve their professional skills and
thus to become competent workers
capable of serving their own interests
and those of their community.
The illiterates in the second group
have been faced, perhaps for the first
time, with a change in the structure of
their society. It is this change which
should be used as a starting point for
motivation.
Prepared intelligently, the pro¬
gramme should be geared so as to
best serve both personal and collective
aims. The task is straightforward
work is available and jobs are offered
according to applicants' qualifications.
Those who can read and write
obviously get the best jobs and the
best pay.
The last groups are similar as re¬
gards their material and social life, but
there is one essential difference bet¬
ween them. While one group depends
on employers who, though fully aware
of the value of reading and writing,
do not help their workers to learn, the
other has neither example nor guide.
However in both cases there is an
obvious need to create new social
structures, to produce economic chan¬
ges which revive an apathetic society
without incentive. All these factors
must be considered.
To be effective any literacy pro¬
gramme must have clearly defined
aims. It is because this study has
been neglected that we still find in
some countries a common curriculum
for urban and rural schools, with no
distinction made between regional and
local characteristics.
In other cases, an incomplete rural
school exists next to a complete urban
school. In some schools of Asia and
Africa where there is a shortage of
textbooks adapted to the country, tea¬
chers use books written for Europeans
where neither names, illustrations nor
subjects have any connexion with local
conditions. In adult education pro¬
grammes, we have even seen teachers
use books written for children because
of lack of planning or money, and this
has soon proved discouraging to adult
students.
In isolated rural areas the three main
problems of under-development illite¬
racy, poverty and sickness are so
inter-related that it is difficult for the
planner to decide on which to concen¬
trate first. It is useless to concentrate
on health, for example, while ignoring
soil erosion which aggravates malnu¬
trition and poverty in themselves an
unsurmountable obstacle to the impro¬
vement of health standards.
Similarly, it is useless to teach peo¬
ple to read and write without giving
them a reason for learning and the

Learning to read

opportunity to use their newly acquired
knowledge to improve their living con¬
ditions.
Nor can agricultural development be
pursued if sickness and illiteracy keep
the agricultural worker in a state of
mental inertia.
Consequently what is called for is
concerted action by specialists in the
various fields to solve these problems
simultaneously with a view to econo¬
mic and social development since the
success of literacy programmes is
tied up with measures such as agra¬
rian reform and the development of
co-operatives and with many other fac¬
tors of social, economic and cultural
development to which are sometimes
added political reasons, which should
not be under-estimated.
Literacy training is not an end in
itself but a means to an end, and as
such should constitute an essential
element of development and be plan¬
ned in consequence, being adapted to
each case and with clear and well
defined aims in view. It must respond
to needs.
T
8
HE day of literacy for
literacy's sake is long past. It is there¬
fore inadvisable to launch a literacy
programme as an isolated project be¬
cause the very absence of adequate
planning on a broad scale and of
foresight is bound to lead to failure.
It would also be absolutely wrong
to undertake a mass literacy pro¬
gramme in a country which has not re¬
solved, at the same time, to trans¬
form its social structure and its deve¬
lopment plans; this would only lead to
the raising of new hopes without pro¬
viding the means of satisfying them.
In this case, it would be preferable to
concentrate the effort on limited sec¬
tors where development plans are
already in operation or about to be
undertaken. As a general rule, lite¬
racy should be included in all commu¬
nity development programmes (indus¬
trial, agricultural, housing, health, etc.)
This selective system of literacy
training may not be appealing from a
political point of view because it is not
spectacular, but on the other hand it
is realistic and positive and its results
are more effective and lasting.
It soon becomes clear that while
investment in primary education yields
a long term return, investment in func¬
tional literacy work with adults gives
a much quicker yield because of the
age of the persons involved and of the
rapid improvement in the quality of
manpower.
Literacy can be an important step
towards vocational training and play a
fundamental role in changing the
milieu. It opens the door to learning,
and literate adults are thus better
informed both as citizens and as pro¬
ducers.
It is obvious, therefore, that the sel¬
ection of reading material is of pri¬
mary importance. Not only must the
content be related to the normal activi¬
ties of the newly literate but the style,
too, must be simple and attractive so
as to develop a taste for reading.
Someone once said that in a literacy
programme adults should begin by
"learning to read" and finish by
"reading to learn". This is the mo¬
ment at which the adult chooses his
own reading matter, either to increase
his knowledge or for relaxation and
enjoyment.
But not simply any book or news¬
paper is suitable for a person who has
just learned to read. A gap exists
between his elementary knowledge and
the books or papers which might be
the only things available for him to
read. This gap must be filled by lite¬
rature which is especially adapted to
his level so that he can gradually pro¬
gress towards more advanced texts.
This is one of the most important
aspects of any adult education pro¬
gramme and the new literate's very
future depends on the quality of the
reading matter made available to him.
As we know, literacy is a complex
problem. It is a matter of national
concern and consequently a country
has to be informed about it. There
are technical and organizational details
of which the public is generally
unaware and regarding which some
explanation is needed. The people
need to be told the purpose of literacy
training, the aims which the authorities
hope to achieve thereby and the gene¬
ral and specific problems involved.
In preparing to "launch a cam¬
paign" it has been customary to pre¬
pare posters in which an allegorical
illustration is accompanied by some
catch phrase or slogan, but as these
posters are directed at the illiterate
who cannot read or understand them,
they are perfectly useless. There is
one sector of the public, however,
which should be better informed
those in positions of responsibility,
employers, directors, and all those
most directly concerned with the deve¬
lopment of their country. The role of
the press and other mass media is
thus of paramount importance.
I N countries where more
than one language is in common use,
it is up to the government to choose the
language to be used in literacy train¬
ing. However the various meetings
and conferences so far devoted to
literacy have been unanimous in recom¬
mending that the first stages of all
literacy programmes should use the
vernacular as a means of penetration,
understanding and affinity.
Where a language does not exist in
any written form, a different problem
arises and special research has then
to be undertaken to establish an alpha¬
bet and to determine appropriate lin¬
guistic rules.
Literacy teaching for adults calls for
a varied and extensive teaching body
elementary schoolteachers, both
active and retired; well educated non¬
professionals; technical experts in
specific fields (agriculture, handicrafts,
etc.), group leaders and discussion
guides, operators for audio-visual
equipment, etc., all of them either full
or part time, paid or voluntary.
Most adult educationalists were
trained to teach children, or lack peda¬
gogical experience. In any case, they
need special training to fit them for
their new job. The community has to
be studied as a whole so as to iden¬
tify the many problems confronting
adults, and literacy classes should be
used as an opportunity to help people
become aware of their problems and
to cope with them.
Obviously, in speaking of adult edu¬
cation, the widest meaning is given to
the word "education", taking in the
concept of the complete development
of the human being. We often use
the expression "literacy tied to devel¬
opment" because it is in this sense
that it has to be conceived if it is to
prove useful and show positive results.
But it should be made clear that this
"development" is social as well as
economic, cultural as well as moral.
Literacy within the context of adult
education must be a means of integra¬
tion in the total dynamics of human
betterment.

A DOWN-TO-EARTH APPROACH
TO LITERACY
A new strategy in the struggle against illiteracy has recently been
adopted by Unesco and many countries to meet the growing
challenge of economic development. Departing from past proce¬
dures of attempting to solve the problem of illiteracy on a world¬
wide scale, countries have adopted a more selective approach
with crash-training programmes aimed at groups where incentive
for literacy is high and the promise of results considerable. Here
Mr. Acher Deleon, director of Unesco's literacy programme, replies
to questions on these new experimental literacy projects which
have now been launched in many parts of the world.
ACHER DELEON has been
director of Unesco's De¬
partment of Adult Educa¬
tion and Youth Activities
since 1963. Former secre¬
tary of the Central Council
of Yugoslav Trade Unions,
Mr Deleon has been a
member of Unesco's Inter¬
national Advisory Com¬
mittee for Adult Education
since 1953.
QUESTION. Can you tell us,
Mr. Deleon, where we stand today in
the struggle against illiteracy?
ANSWER. In the last few years
I think we have reached a turning
point. Until recently countries the
world over were mainly interested in
investing in capital equipment or in
the upper echelons represented by
administrators and executives. Today,
national policy-makers and in fact the
whole international community want
to try to tap their vast manpower po¬
tential. To justify literacy campaigns
in the past the principles of human
rights, ethics and justice were always
invoked. But today when we speak
of investing in education we think in
terms of improved efficiency and pro¬
ductivity, in other words, economic
development.
Q. Does this mean that the ethical
aspects of literacy and human rights
are no longer important?
A. By no means. But let us not
forget that economic emancipation for
a country is basic to human freedom.
Q. What would you say are
Unesco's recent achievements in lite¬
racy?
A. In November 1964, Unesco's
General Conference launched the first
experimental programme for functional
literacy. This programme, covering a
period of five years, is both selective
and intensive. Selective, because it
operates in only a few countries and
concentrates on priority economic and
social areas. So you can see that this
is an entirely new approach that differs
sharply from the world-wide earlier
campaigns. It is intensive because it
operates in depth and is no longer
exclusively educational in character
but also aims at improving productivity,
the adaptability of a country's labour
force and indeed the whole labour
market.
A functional literacy programme is
directly tied to a country's economic
priorities, and literacy efforts are pin¬
pointed in areas of other heavy in¬
vestments. This is done advisedly as

DIAMOND HUNTERS ON THE MIGHTY ORINOCO
"I know all the earth doth not
yield the like confluence of streams
and branches, the one crossing the
other as many times, and all as fair
and large and so like one another
as no man can tell which to take."
So Sir Walter Raleigh described the
huge delta of the Orinoco which he
visited on his search for El Dorado
in 1595. The mighty Orinoco, one
of the longest rivers of South Ame¬
rica winds west, north and east
across the centre of Venezuela be¬
fore entering the Atlantic through its
many-channelled fan-shaped delta
nearly as large as Sicily. In this
vast area the Venezuelan govern¬
ment is now engaged in a gigantic
programme to develop its rich min¬
ing and forestry resources as well
as its hydro-electric potential, and
with Unesco's co-operation has un¬
dertaken a programme of literacy
and training to raise the educational
and technical level of its manpower.

the Orinoco, who are participating

a selective project.
I think I ought to make clear at this
point that we still do not know the
exact correlation between literacy and
development. That is why we attach
so much importance to the evaluation
of our results. Once it is proved such
a correlation actually exists, the next
step will be to determine precisely
what effect literacy actually has on a
nation's economy in such domains as
agriculture, handcrafts, industry, trade,
etc.
Another objective of our projects is
to see to what extent literacy can help
to promote a more diversified eco¬
nomy.
Q. Does this mean that no two
functional literacy programmes are
alike?
A. Precisely. Each project is
conceived in terms of local conditions
within the framework of overall de¬
velopment needs and specific require¬
ments for skilled labour. At the same
time, action is clearly called for when
a development programme is ham¬
pered by illiteracy. In other words,
literacy is not an end in itself, since it
is not merely a matter of teaching
adults reading, writing and arithmetic
but a means of enabling people to
make practical use of their newly
acquired skills.
Q. What you are saying really
means that much depends on local
conditions within a country?
A. Yes. It was once believed
that the new literates lapsed into illite¬
racy because of the lack of reading
materials. But it's not as simple as
that. We now know that local condi¬
tions are the crux of the problem . It
is these conditions that must be
changed so that the new literates can
put their technical knowledge and
skills to good use.
Q. I suppose this means that the
teaching programme of every func¬
tional literacy operation will vary to
take into account these local condi¬
tions, which was not the case in the
past?
A. Yes of course. Today each
project is "tailored" to fit each commu¬
nity both as regards scope and timing.
In other words, each literacy pro¬
gramme varies depending on whether
we are dealing with textile workers or
rice farmers, fishermen or ground nut
producers, young people or older per¬
sons, men or women, city workers or
farmers.
Q. Is there any relationship be¬
tween national literacy programmes
and the Unesco experimental projects?
A. There are now two different
views on this. There are those who
feel that all the experimental projects
should be closely integrated with na¬
tional programmes, and those who are
opposed to this and want to keep them
completely separated. As a matter of
fact there is really no clash or mcom-
patability between the two approaches.
It is not unlikely that the experimental
projects will in due course affect natio¬
nal programmes even if they are not
fully integrated, so that the originality
and purpose of each is maintained. In
any event, the final responsibility for
the experimental projects always rests
with the national authorities.
Q. How are the experimental pro¬
jects financed?
A. In January 1966, the United
Nations Development Programme
agreed to contribute $3,600,000 for
functional literacy. Algeria, Iran and
Mali were the first countries selected
for the operation. In June of the same
year, a further $2,350,000 was set aside
for projects in Ecuador and Tanza¬
nia (1). This was the first time that
substantial international funds for de¬
velopment went to finance a literacy
programme. As M. René Maheu, the
Director-General of Unesco, stated at
the time: "The connexion between lite¬
racy and development which Unesco
has long advocated as a basic prin¬
ciple is now officially recognized and
unequivocally confirmed."
Q. Do governments also contri¬
bute towards the financing of these
experimental projects?
A. As a matter of fact they con¬
tribute the major share. Algeria is
putting in $2,960,000; Iran, $1,700,000;
Mali $3,000,000; Ecuador $1,740,000
Tanzania $5,216,000; Guinea $1,220,000
Ethiopia $2,057,000.
Here I should like to stress one
point. Literacy teaching is also a
social and political problem. It can¬
not be compared to the setting up
of a research laboratory where all
that is needed are the equipment and
staff.
There are people who think that lite¬
racy training is an uncomplicated affair,
for which only a modicum ,of com¬
mon sense is needed. How wrong
they arel Such notions have led to
disaster in the past. A functional lite¬
racy programme calls for careful,
complex planning and preparation
which go far beyond the confines of
mere reading and writing, as I have al¬
ready pointed out.
Q. Mr. Deleon, could I ask you
now to describe some of the experi¬
mental projects you've mentioned?
A. Well, let's take Algeria first.
(1) In January 1967, $1,273,000 was
approved for a project in Guinea, and in
January 1968 the UN. Development Pro¬
grammed accorded $1,586,000 for aid to
Ethiopia.
Algeria's population of persons over
15 years of age is 5,500,000. Of
these, 4,400,000 are illiterate. This
is a crippling handicap for a nation
that is determined to industrialize itself
and develop its agriculture. It urgently
needs qualified manpower, and for this
literacy is a vital first step. There are
three functional literacy projects now
in operation. The first at Staoueli, near
Algiers, in one of the country's richest
agricultural areas, where 5,000 per¬
sons working in autonomous agricul¬
tural estates are being trained. The
second is in the industrial zone of
Arzew, 40 kilometres from Oran; the
third in the district of Annaba, 600 kilo¬
metres east of Algiers, where training
must be provided for 70,000 workers
for the petro-chemical industry and a
vast metallurgical and steel-making
complex.
In Iran, the project involves two
operations: one in the irrigated area of
the Grand Dez (not far from ancient
Susa, in western Iran), where a large
dam has been constructed, and mo¬
dern farming methods have been in¬
troduced. The other is being carried
out at of Isfahan, where 300,000 people
live. In this ancient capital, famous
for its rugs, 26,000 textile workers are
to be trained.
In Mali, the pilot projects relate to
two priority sectors, one agricultural,
the other industrial. In the Ségou area
and in the Baracueli and Tamani dis¬
tricts, the literacy campaign affects
nearly 100,000 people working on the
land, and is designed to raise cotton
and rice production. In the Bamako
area, 6,000 illiterate workers employed
in a score of government enterprises
are involved.
Q. Can you tell us what a literacy
project consists of?
A. First, it is a centre where the
methods and curriculum of teaching
are carefully worked out; second,
where the technicians needed are
actually trained. But the project is not
confined to the centre and does much
of its work "in the field", that is, in
the actual areas where groups work¬
ing in agriculture or industry, are taught
to read and write and receive basic
professional training.
Let us take the example of Tan¬
zania, which has 10 million inhabitants
and is predominantly agricultural. The
farm population represents 85 per cent
of the consumer market but provides
only 45 per cent of the gross national
product. A pilot-project linking literacy
teaching to vocational training has been
started in a cotton and coffee producing
area south of Lake Victoria. It covers
four regions: West Lake, Mwanza,
Mara and Shmganga. Cotton output,
which with modern cultivation methods
rose from 38,000 bales in 1955 to
161,000 in 1960, should reach over all
million bales in 1980. I I

A DOWN-TO-EARTH-APPROACH (Continued)
50 nations ask to join experimental programmes

as yet not fully exploited, natural
resources. Ecuador's development
plan is aimed at every sector of the
economy from agriculture to fishing
and handicrafts to industry. But there
is a big shortage of skilled labour.
Almost 30 per cent of the workers are
illiterate. Furthermore, 65 per cent
of the population lives in the country¬
side where the illiteracy rate is as
high as 43 per cent. Illiteracy among
workers in the urban industrial areas
varies between 15 and 17 per cent.
Three pilot zones for development
have been set up in Ecuador. One at
Cuenca, in the highlands, where 6,000
adults are being trained in the literacy
project, and 9,000 artisans from pro¬
ducer co-operatives will be given
vocational training. The second, in
the Milagra area, where 16,000 pea¬
sants will be given literacy and voca¬
tional training. The third zone has
been set up north of 0u|to in a 10,000
hectare tract of land, in the Pesillo
district. This area feeds a population
of 2,000 which will benefit from a basic
literacy programme (virtually everyone
is illiterate) combined with vocational
education to develop local resources.
Q. A similar project is now under
way in Venezuela, but is it not quite
different from those you have just
described?
A. The Venezuelan project is part
of the experimental literacy pro¬
gramme but it is entirely financed by
Venezuela itself with no contribution
from the United Nations Development
Programme. The literacy campaign in
Venezuela is one of the most impor¬
tant in all Latin America. As many as
6,100 literacy centres were set up in
the country in 1958 with 40,000 vo¬
lunteer teachers; and special "Literacy
Legions" were created for 100,000
adult students. Yet despite this, the
educational level in both towns and
rural areas is far from adequate for
Venezuela's economic and social deve¬
lopment plans.
Let me give you a concrete case in
point. Venezuela's oil industry is in
full expansion and now accounts for
20 per cent of the national product,
60 per cent of public revenue and over
90 per cent of all Venezuela's exports.
Yet it employs a mere two per cent
of the working population because of
the grave shortage of skilled labour.
The situation is little different in the
iron mining and agricultural industries.
Three zones, each offering a differ¬
ent economic and social pattern, have
been selected for the experimental pro¬
ject; an industrial zone, an agricultural
zone, and a rural zone in the process
of rapid urbanization. The industrial
zone is located in the State of Bolivar,
in eastern Venezuela. Here a large
hydro-electric power station has been
built at Macagua on the Caroni river.
The Orinoco steel-works located in
this region have an enormous output
most of which is exported.
The second experimental zone has
been set up in the State of Portuguesa
where rice, sesame and cotton
production have already been in¬
creased through mechanization and
irrigation. The third pilot area lies at
the foot of the Andes, in the
State of Lara. This region has been
undergoing intensive development in
recent years accompanied by rapid
urbanization. This has led to the large-
scale migration of rural populations
into towns, the mushrooming growth
of "shanty towns" in the suburbs, and
a sharp rise in unemployment. It is
this untapped, wasted labour potential
that the experimental project hopes to
recuperate by offering the adults an
opportunity to learn a skill or trade.
Q. How many persons would you
say are involved in these projects in
Venezuela?
A. About 300,000. Furthermore,
to meet the needs of the country's
industrial expansion, Venezuela's Co¬
operative Educational Institute and
other adult education services plan to
raise the number of trained personnel
from 470,000 in 1962 to over 900,000
by 1970 and nearly 1,300,000 in the
next seven years, that is by 1975.
Q. Could we return just for a
moment to the question of financing?
Do other ways exist of helping a
country to set up functional literacy
projects?
A. Well, in addition to those
projects which receive multi-lateral
assistance and those financed
exclusively by national resources, we
also see the possibility of projects
receiving bilateral aid being incor¬
porated into the experimental pro¬
gramme. In fact negotiations are at
present under way between certain
donor and recipient countries for such
bilateral aid, with Unesco acting as the
intermediary.
Then too, there are a number of
projects where literacy is a component
of agricultural or industrial develop¬
ment. This is true in the case of Syria
where the Ghab Valley Authority
project, aided by the U.N. Develop¬
ment Programme and carried out in
co-operation with the Food and
Agriculture Organization, also provides
for functional literacy as an important
component of the project as a whole.
Q. Would you say that all these
projects we have been discussing have
some common denominator by which
the results achieved could be judged?
A. As I think I have already made
clear, the basic criterion for all the
projects is how well they contribute
to development. But in order to
gauge the effectiveness of these pro¬
grammes we must carefully study their
economic and social implications and
compare the different methods and
techniques used. This will enable us
with time to piece together all the data
needed to launch a much vaster and
more complex operation. The pilot
projects call for a lot of research and
investigation, all of it extremely
important, and should prove highly
valuable for our future operations by
helping to answer such questions as:
how to go about planning out-of-school
education, what the best methods
are, where they can be applied with
the best prospects for success, what
types of programmes to organize. On
the answers to these questions will
depend the measure in which the
struggle against illiteracy can be
broadened.
Q. What other projects are now
planned?
A. At least 50 countries have
asked for Unesco aid. Until now
Unesco preparatory missions have
visited 31 of them. New projects are
now being mapped out for Zambia,
Sudan, Madagascar, Brazil, Peru and
India. In India, the project is linked
with the question of increased food
production, where I might add in
passing, extraordinary advances have
been made in India in the past year.
This will be a five-year project to make
750,000 adults functionally literate.
But as I have said earlier, each project
is distinct and geared to a specific
purpose. In Nepal the programme
will cover a region in the transitional
stage of a subsistence and a market
economy. In Algeria, we have seen
that the project's aim is to promote the
expansion of an ultra-modern petro¬
chemical complex. Between these
extremes there are a host of variants.
Q. It has been said that creating
a population of new literates gives rise
to many new problems, that new
literates become dissatisfied with their
old way of life and get ideas of
grandeur. Do you think this is true?
A. Man has always sought to
better himself and rise above his
station. This desire for progress
deserves to be encouraged. As long
as country people find opportunity for
work in the cities they will continue
to abandon the countryside which often
lacks electricity, modern conveniences
and transport facilities. But this
problem cannot be solved by denying
or resisting such aspirations. I think
our programmes are facing the realities
of the situation squarely and in a down-
to-earth way, without rose-coloured
glasses, without side-stepping the real
issues by resorting to demagogy or
being swayed by false sentiments of
the exotic. But we make no bones
about our wish to change things.
Every one of our projects must there¬
fore carefully take into account not
only the educational patterns of each
country but its entire political and
economic structure. In other words,
each project must reflect the political,
economic and moral state of health of
each country if we are to have a good
chance of success.

Literacy: the ABC
of development
Unesco has carried out a major inquiry on world progress in
literacy since 1965 and has published its findings in a special
report, "Literacy 1965-1967." The report describes the
methods used by different countries to fight illiteracy, and the
new strategy that has shaped world action since 1965.
0
RIGINALLY and until quite
recently, action against adult illiteracy
was the almost exclusive concern of
non-governmental organizations, of pri¬
vate groups and of missions. In short,
it was due to the initiative of volunteers,
as though its fundamental purpose was
action of a social and humanitarian
character or an effort to "rehabilitate"
underprivileged groups of men and
women.
Today, however, most governments
consider themselves directly respon
sible for adult literacy teaching.
Simultaneously, the unconcern in
varying degrees of businessmen, in¬
dustrialists and planners for literacy
work has been replaced by a growing
interest on the part of those
responsible for economic affairs and
development plans, who have begun
to endorse the major principles adopt¬
ed in Teheran by the World Congress
of Ministers of Education.
A new approach to literacy is thus
emerging in many countries, first
through the incorporation of literacy
programmes in plans for educational
development and more generally
through their integration in plans for
economic and social development.
The idea launched at Teheran of
linking literacy teaching with the pri¬
orities of economic development has
impelled authorities to reconsider the
whole question of such priorities. It
has led Ministries of Education to
open discussions with planning au¬
thorities and other ministries and to
envisage broad and coherent plans of
action.
Striking examples of a dynamic, inte¬
grated approach to these problems
are found in numerous countries.

ABC OF DEVELOPMENT (Continued)
for a pilot project in functional literacy
can be considered as a model
application of the selective strategy
adopted in Teheran.
Similar functional literacy projects
are linked with textile factories at
Chbin-el-Kom (United Arab Repub¬
lic) and in the Ghab Valley (Syria),
with oil installations in Saudi Arabia
and Kuwait, with fisheries in Qatar,
and With the semi-rural district of
Tazerka in Tunisia.
Others have been launched in indus¬
trial plants at Cap Vert (Senegal), for
harbour works and a rubber factory
at Monrovia (Liberia), in the "co-opera¬
tive villages" of the Republic of the
Congo, the Tuncbilek mines (Turkey),
the Youth Settlement Schemes in Cey¬
lon, the Nam-Ngum barrage in Laos,
the Rodovia project in Brazil and
agrarian reform areas in Chile and
Guatemala.
Many countries have taken far-
reaching steps in planning for literacy.
Due to profound differences in nation¬
al structures, these measures vary
widely; but the aim of many is to
introduce more rigorous programming
and to fix medium term objectives.
Some Arab countries, for example,
aim to make certain age groups of the
population literate within ten years;
others have set a target date of
15 years. A Philippines government
decree and laws provide for a 6-year
systematic literacy campaign (1966-
1972). Burma hopes to attain its liter¬
acy goals even more rapidly. Iran's
fourth five-year development plan
(1967-1972) envisages a 30 per cent
reduction in the illiteracy rate. Italy,
Mexico, Turkey and other countries
have adapted literacy programmes to
conditions in various regions and to
the population groups concerned.
A NUMBER of countries
have passed laws making it compulsory
for certain sections of the population to
participate in literacy programmes. In
Libya and Iraq laws are being drawn
up to compel illiterate adults to attend
classes. Elsewhere (as in Guatemala
and Venezuela) new legislation aims
to extend a system under which firms
invest a part of their profits in literacy
programmes for their employees. In
Cambodia and Ecuador recent laws
require literate adults to help teach
illiterate fellow citizens.
To meet the demands of literacy
development, other laws covering
administrative reorganizations have
been promulgated or are being adopt¬
ed. New national literacy services have
thus been set up in Argentina, the
Republic of the Congo, Dahomey,
Ethiopia, Korea, Mauritania and the
Republic of Viet-Nam.
In Indonesia, Madagascar, Mauritius,
Paraguay and the United Arab Repub¬
lic, existing services have been re¬
organized, and many countries have
created new regional, provincial or
municipal administrations to deal with
literacy.
An important recommendation by the
Teheran Congress calls for the adop¬
tion in literacy projects of the multiple
approach used in programmes of
economic and social development. The
idea has had major repercussions in a
number of countries which have given
an interministerial structure to the body
responsible for drafting and directing
the national literacy policy.
In some (Burma, Chile, Colombia,
Greece, Nepal and Senegal), these
bodies and consultative committees are
primarily concerned with interminis¬
terial co-ordination; in others (Ivory

where literacy campaigns have made most progress in recent years. Mobile libraries, a gift of the Scandinavian
countries, now bring books to newly-literate villagers, and adult education and literacy programmes
have been aided by Unesco's Gift Coupon Programme. A major experimental literacy project launched
near Lake Victoria with Unesco help has been geared to the development of local irrigation works
and the modernization of cotton and coffee production.
Coast, India, Mali, Thailand), national
committees, whose members represent
a broad range of activities, draw up
the overall national literacy policy.
The composition of these committees
which, in Algeria, Iraq, the U.A.R. and
Tunisia, for example, include not only
representatives of the usual adminis¬
trations, but also spokesmen for poli¬
tical parties and associations with
mass memberships, shows that the
role of literacy in development is now
fully understood.
In some countries literacy cam¬
paigns are controlled by several
authorities. In Afghanistan program¬
mes are being run simultaneously by
the Ministry of Education, the Rural
Education Department of the Ministry
of the Interior, the Welfare Society
(which organizes courses for women)
and the Army.
In Latin America, where many liter¬
acy programmes are operated jointly
by private organizations and indepen¬
dently-run vocational training centres,
Ministries of Education usually insist on
assuming the general direction or at
least the co-ordination of these pro¬
grammes.
In some African countries literacy
services come under the authority of
other ministers than the Ministei of
Education: in Zambia, the Ministry of
Community Development and in Kenya
the Ministry of Co-operatives and
Social Services, for example.
I
HE impulse given by the
Teheran Congress to literacy cam¬
paigns in general is shown by an
encouraging increase in the literacy
budgets of many countries.
The cost of literacy programmes
represents only a small fraction of the
total resources assigned to education
and is thus only a relatively light
burden. Even so, the budgetary in¬
creases are seen as a significant
development in the struggle against
illiteracy.
And as literacy teaching is given
a more functional emphasis, private
enterprises, particularly those in the
production sector, are bound to
become more closely involved with
such campaigns and therefore the cost
of literacy projects should no longer
fall on public budgets alone.
A look at recent statistics on the
number of people made literate in cer
tain countries reveals first, a sharp
increase in new literates during 1965-
1967, but secondly, a persistently low
ratio of these new literates as a percen¬
tage of the total illiterate population. In
other words, the results are appre¬
ciable but still far from adequate.
The modern approach to literacy
teaching is based on a better under¬
standing of the direct connexion bet¬
ween illiteracy and underdevelopment.
This has brought a clearer view of
ways in which literacy programmes
can be integrated with national plans
for economic expansion.
Literacy programmes of this new
type, launched in many parts of the
world, fit into a coherent pattern of
economic and social objectives in each
country.
In Gabon, a national committee
plans literacy activities to meet pri¬
ority needs in specific sectors of the
economy; in Nigeria a literacy cam¬
paign is being run for tobacco workers;
in Brazil projects have been launched
for illiterate workers engaged on the

Literacy on the beam

Crop Varieties Programme; and in
Yugoslavia factory workers' councils
organize education and literacy pro¬
grammes in conjunction with voca¬
tional training.
Increasing attempts are being made
to combine literacy teaching, even
where it retains a classroom flavour
in its teaching methods, with vocatio¬
nal, civil or political education.
In Madagascar, Niger and Senegal,
literacy work is combined with cam¬
paigns for rural development. Else¬
where in Africa (Ghana, Malawi, Ni¬
geria), in Asia (India, Malaysia, Paki¬
stan, Republic of Viet-Nam), and in
Latin America (Haiti, Dominican Repub¬
lic) it is becoming more closely inte¬
grated with community development
projects.
In Tunisia literacy teaching has
become an integral feature of agri¬
cultural and industrial enterprises,
providing a general education in eco¬
nomic and social questions, which
aims above all to stimulate an aware¬
ness of development problems.
In Indonesia, the "Pancha Marga"
programme merges literacy and adult
education with a long-term develop¬
ment project.
c
16
'UBA'S literacy campaign,
as a follow up to the efforts made in
1961, aims to bring adults up to the
sixth year of schooling so that they may
share fully in the nation's social and
economic development. Priority is
given to the functional aspect of liter¬
acy and adult education programmes
by linking them closely with the work
of the Institute of Agrarian Reform,
and the Ministry of Industry and
Training of Intermediate Technicians.
The "psycho-social" literacy method
introduced in Chile seeks to make a
functional contribution to social edu¬
cation; it brings group-dynamics into
play and uses dialogue as a method
of stimulating the critical faculties and
an awareness of community and na¬
tional problems.
Much has been done since 1965 to
provide reading material for illiterate
adults and handbooks for their tea¬
chers. Teaching manuals and readers
for new literates have been prepared
and printed in Latin America, Africa,
Asia and the Arab countries.
Significant experiments have been
made by publishing special news¬
papers or inserting pages in existing
newspapers for the benefit of newly-
literate adults so as to maintain their
interest in reading and offer them
articles on suitable subjects written
at the appropriate level.
Newspapers of this type are publish¬
ed in Cameroon, Guatemala, Haiti,
Kenya, Madagascar, Nepal, Spain and
elsewhere. In addition, literacy activi¬
ties have been publicized in articles
and special features in the popular
press of many countries, including
Ceylon, Republic of the Congo, Ecua¬
dor, Mali, Paraguay and Syria.
N UMEROUS countries are
using the audio-visual media in their
literacy programmes to supplement and
sometimes to replace traditional teach¬
ing media and materials. Media thus
employed range from the simple poster
to television programmes.
Radio has been widely used in
literacy programmes after first serving
to stimulate interest and mobilize
public opinion in support of literacy
campaigns.
Ethiopia launched an experimental
literacy programme by radio in 1965;
in Madagascar hundreds of radio
receivers have been supplied to liter¬
acy centres; in Mali a "radio school"
programme is broadcast every evening
for those who speak Bambara; much
radio time in Niger is devoted to
educational broadcasts, including the
teaching of spoken French.
Iran uses a special transmitter for
literacy teaching in the Ghazwin dis¬
trict; every literacy centre in Ceylon
is equipped with a radio receiver;
in Nepal an adult education programme
is broadcast weekly and in Malaysia,
over 1,500 receivers have been
supplied to literacy centres.
In Latin America, Argentina uses the
radio to bring literacy to the country's
most isolated communities; Guatemala
has radio schools; Mexico started
literacy courses by radio in 1966 and
Peru has distributed 1,300 receivers
to schools running literacy classes.
Jamaica, Spain and the U.S.A. also
use radio for literacy teaching.
An active ally of literacy, the cinema
has proved particularly effective in
campaigns to stimulate the incentive
for literacy and for popularizing educa¬
tional themes. El Salvador and Tuni¬
sia in particular have employed it with
outstanding success.
Television is used to teach reading,
writing and arithmetic in only a small
number of countries as yet and mostly
on an experimental basis. But its
potentialities in education are far-
reaching.
Brazil, Ivory Coast, Senegal, Ghana,
Italy, Iran, Jamaica, Mexico, Peru, the
United Arab Republic and the U.S.A.
have all used television for literacy
and adult education, and Chile, Ethio¬
pia, India and Uganda plan to do so.
The transition from traditional liter¬
acy teaching simple schooling in
reading and writing to functional
literacy forming an integral part of
a programme of vocational guidance or
training necessarily involves changes
in the recruitment and training of
teachers.
In most countries adult literacy
courses are chiefly run by school¬
teachers in addition to their normal
work.
It has been noted, however, that
fully trained schoolteachers tend to
follow the conventional approach to
education and traditional teaching
methods. So an effort is being made
to recruit volunteer teachers from
other callings: agricultural instructors
and nursing personnel in Niger,
rural development leaders in Laos,
instructors on loan from apprentice
training schools in Senegal and
factory foremen in Tunisia.
In other countries such as Algeria,
Mauritania and Morocco, the urgent
need for trained workers in the new
industrial plants has led authorities to
recruit literacy workers from among
factory overseers, who are given short
training courses.
IHIS new trend is even
more marked in countries where the
majority of literacy workers are recruit¬
ed not from the teaching profession,
but from among part-time volunteers
belonging to the better-educated sec¬
tions of the community.
This survey of national efforts
affirms the reality of international co¬
operation in efforts for literacy, be¬
cause the progress so far made has
often only been possible thanks to an
appreciable contribution in the form
of international assistance.
The concept of international assis¬
tance has developed considerably in
the past two years and must continue
to do so, since it has now become
obvious that the eradication of illiter¬
acy as an obstacle to development is
in the interests not only of the coun¬
tries where the evil exists, but of those
which have freed themselves from it.

Costumes with distinct local styles are still worn in the villages of Sardinia (Italy).
The womenfolk, who excel at craftwork of all kinds, make their own dresses (as these
young women from Orgosolo have done). In the past 20 years Sardinia has taken a big
step toward modernization, but many villages preciously maintain their ancient customs.

THE SHORTHAND CLASS
THAT STARTED
AN AVALANCHE
by Francesco Salis
We present here the remarkable story of Francesco Salis and the
work he has accomplished in transforming a small town in Sardi¬
nia. Italy is today one of the most advanced countries of Europe
both economically and culturally, but certain of its southern regions
and islands such as Sardinia have not kept pace with this remark¬
able growth. In recent years these poorer regions have been
making a determined effort to modernize and develop. In Sep¬
tember 1967, Francesco Salis was awarded the Mohammed Reza
Pahlavi Prize (honourable mention) for the many years of service
he has given to the town of Santulussurgiu (Sardinia) as a result
of which illiteracy was reduced from 37 per cent to 4.5 per cent.
The story was written in co-operation with "Unesco Courier" staff
editor, Lucio Attinelli.
s,»ANTULUSSURGIU is a
tiny town of four thousand inhabitants
in the province of Cagliari on the
island of Sardinia, perched on the
eastern slopes of Mount Ferro about
600 metres above sea-level. Over
the past ten years more than a
thousand persons have left the town
to emigrate to Argentina, Australia,
France or Switzerland. Every year a
few come back to spend their holidays
on the island, choose a bride and
then return to their adopted countries.

ISLAND

TOURNAMENTS
Island birthplace of one of the most ancient
Mediterranean cultures, the changing Sardinia of today
frequently reveals many unexpected facets of its antique
past. This is particularly true of the mountainous areas
where life for the pastoral inhabitants remains austere.

Sardinia's great tradition is
the Sagra, a popular festival dur¬
ing which minstrel-poets travel
from village to village improvis¬
ing and reciting their verses at
poetry tournaments. These con¬
tests often take place after such
popular events as the ballu-
tundu, a dance performed to the
music of the launedda (photos
above), or the carnival-like pro¬
cession of masked shepherds at
Mamoida each of whom carries
some 50 small bells (left). Com¬
petitors in these tourneys may
be young or old, labourers or
shepherds, and many have an
extraordinary gift for improvised
versifying. In village squares,
venders offer the texts of
poems or narrative compositions
that have won particular acclaim.
Not surprisingly, one of the na¬
mes held most dear by the peo¬
ple of Sardinia is that of Grazia
Deledda, the Sardinian novelist
and 1926 Nobel Prizewinner for
Literature who drew inspiration
from the island's customs and
traditions.

lussurgiu live by sheep-farming or
stock-breeding, which until a few
years ago formed the basic pattern of
Sardinia's economy. Since 1840 the
town has been proud of its secondary
school which gave it a certain cultural
prestige over other towns in Sardinia.
Even so, widespread illiteracy, and
more important, relapse into illiteracy
were a marked feature of Santu-
lussurgiu when in 1951 a Centre for
Popular Culture was first opened in
the town.
The Centre for Popular Culture is
a unit of Italy's National Union for the
Fight Against Illiteracy founded in 1947
to promote literacy and community
development in certain areas of
southern Italy as a means of improving
the cultural, social and economic situa¬
tion of the people.
Today there are ninety such centres
in southern Italy, with 800 volunteer
helpers and over 30,000 pupils. Each
centre has its own story to tell. This
is the story of the Santulussurgiu
centre 1 have been in charge of for
the past seventeen years.
Early in 1951 a small group of ele¬
mentary school teachers, university
students and members of the liberal
professions got together to discuss a
problem which had been on all our
minds for some time, namely, our
duty and responsibility towards the
shepherds, stock-breeders, farmers
and craftsmen of our poverty-stricken
community.
All of us agreed that we could no
longer stand by doing nothing except
idle away our free time playing cards,
gathering for drinks in the cafes, or
discussing the latest fashionable
novel, which gave us the illusion of
being "active intellectuals". At the
time there were twenty of us who felt
that something could be done about
our town.
A PRELIMINARY survey had
revealed that at least 1,100 persons
out of our population of 4,000 (37 per
cent) were either completely illiterate
(that is, had never learned to read of
write) or had reverted to illiteracy
because our town made no provisions
for cultural or educational activities.
Once we had brought the problem
out into the open we decided to act.
Our first step was to organize such
activities that would enable us to
make direct contact with the villagers
and then gain their friendship and
confidence. This led to the creation
of the Centre of Popular Culture of
Santulussurgiu which ultimately grew
to be one of the most important in
Italy.
We started out in a flush of enthu¬
siasm, little aware of the many
complex problems we would be up
against. We had naively believed that
Adult Education meant nothing more

than applying to adults the experience
we had acquired in traditional ele¬
mentary school teaching.
We were in for a rude awakening.
We soon realized that adults could not
be treated like children or made to
submit to teaching designed for chil¬
dren. The adults balked at such treat¬
ment first as a matter of pride and
then because of the obvious fact that
they brought with them into the class
long years of knowledge and expe¬
rience.
Thus it was that we had not only
to revise our teaching methods but to
make radical changes in the traditional
classroom pattern. There were to be
no "benches", no "masters-and-
pupils" approach, but instead work-
tables and a mature, friendly relation¬
ship between teacher and "centnsti"
(as the students came to be called).
s,10 began our work for
literacy and for the renaissance of
culture and education in our com¬
munity.
But if we ourselves clearly saw the
advantages of such a cultural pro¬
gramme, limited though it was at first,
the adults we were trying to reach
did not share our enthusiasm, often
greeting our efforts lackadaisically or
with a shrug. In a sense, this is not
surprising. Grown-ups often react
this way to a new idea, and to lure
them to us we had to try to think up
off-beat approaches, some of which I
must say worked out surprisingly well.
One of the ideas we hit on which
met with striking success was a
course in shorthand! At first sight this
may seem an odd way to promote
"culture", but it worked like a charm
in our town.
To most of the people of Santu¬
lussurgiu, the ability to write down a
person's words at top speed, as fast
as they are spoken, was looked upon
as a feat of magic, or just about.
When the stenography course was
announced there was a rush of appli¬
cants. All of them wanted to register
in order to be able to transcribe the
"poetry tournaments" that take place at
Sagra time, the popular festival still
very much in vogue in Sardinia during
which the minstrel-poets travel from
village to village improvising and
reciting their verses in big contests.
Where I come from, there is never
a Sagra festival that does not feature,
besides modern forms of entertain¬
ment such as village dancing and a
football match, a poetry tournament.
These tournaments are quite un¬
usual. On a stage set up with laurel
leaf decorations, recalling those of
ancient Rome on the Capitoline hill,
the wandering poet recites his impro¬
vised verses, usually in octameter,
and to the accompaniment of a chorus
of four voices, on a host of themes
ranging from the religious to the
historical, the biblical to contemporary
social. The themes are chosen by a
jury appointed for the occasion.
These performances are highly
popular with both young people and
the older folk. The poets themselves
are usually labourers, cattle-farmers
and peasants with an extraordinary
gift for extemporaneous versifying and
narrative composition. Not infre¬
quently they are persons with practi¬
cally no education, but if the audience
likes the rhyme pattern of the poetry
it makes allowances if the subject
matter is not as good. However, when
a poet manages to combine lovely
words and ideas with exquisite
rhythm, rhyme and metre then the
audience goes wild.
In those days, tape-recorders were
unknown in Sardinia, and the short¬
hand idea was an immediate hit. I
remember the day the course started...
people began to arrive in droves, a
number actually clambering in through
the window!
Of course the classes were free.
That is how, way back in 1951, we
first began to reach the common
people and were able to convince
them that we had no religious or
political axe to grind. This non-parti¬
san approach soon won us the trust
and respect of the whole town, and
increasing numbers of people crowded
into our classes at the Centre for
Popular Culture.
We, of course, were perfectly aware
that the stenography courses were
only the first phase in our education
strategy. And so indeed it turned out
to be. After a while we were able to
reduce the number of shorthand
classes and introduce other subjects
like history, geography and mathema:
tics into our weekly teaching schedule.
All our- work was geared to the
problems of our town and the different
ways of meeting them. Everything we
did was directly linked to life in the
community; we never dealt with
abstract problems. Little by little our
centre assumed a shape which differ¬
ed sharply from the traditional school
approach in Sardinia... there were no
fixed hours, no fixed term, students
could arrive or leave when they
pleased with no questions asked, no
justification needed or permission
required.
At first our quarters were located in
the basement of the elementary
school, previously used as storage
space, and which we converted to our
purposes. Later we moved to a
ramshackle gymnasium which we
rebuilt with volunteer help from the
"centristi", the teachers and our other
colleagues.
In 1959, at the end of eight years,
four spent in the elementary school
basement and four in the gymnasium,
we acquired a magnificent 18th Cen¬
tury house. We were able to buy it
partly with funds made available by
the National Union for the Fight
Against Illiteracy, partly through the
generosity of the former owners who
let us have it virtually as a gift for a
ridiculously low price.
The adults drawn to the Centre by
the shorthand courses were not illi¬
terates but persons who believed they
were fairly well educated. I say
"believed" because little by little these
persons came to realize that their
many years away from school as well
as the environment they lived in had
left many gaps in their knowledge.
The true illiterates came only later,
after a survey enabled us first to iden¬
tify and get to know them and then to
persuade them to attend our classes
The first to be won over were the
women, the primary inducement being
their keen desire to be able to write
to their children living abroad.
Here is a typical conversation bet¬
ween the instructor and the women:
Instructor. Why should you
who have several sons abroad, have
to share your family secrets with a
stranger just because he can write
your letters for you? And what if that
person shoots his mouth off and lets
the whole town in on your private
affairs? Is that what you want?
Mother. What can I do about it?
I'm too old now to learn to write at
my age any more.
Instructor. What's age got to
do with it? Being old doesn't mean
you're dead. So don't act as though
you're dead and give up living and all
the joys of life. And besides, you're
not old anyway. Do you think being
forty or fifty or even sixty is old any
more? Come on now, you know very
well how it hurts you not to be able to
write your letters yourself. Isn't it
time you stopped belittling yourself
and being the slave of others. Just
think how happy your sons in Austra¬
lia, Argentina or Switzerland will be
the day they get a letter from you in
your own handwriting.
F,OR the women this kind
of discussion usually did the trick.
It also worked with the men, but in
their case we had another convincing
argument: a farmer who knew to read
no matter how small his plot of land
had a much better chance of learning
how to run his farm better, improving
his yield and making more money.
In our teaching, we paid special
attention to the various interests and
attitudes of our grown-up pupils, and
we found that our results were stri¬
kingly improved because of the
community spirit which we encouraged
at the Centre. Once an illiterate adult
joined our group, he knew he was no ft .
longer alone, no longer an outcast of V|
society, that by attending a literacy ^"
class he also took part in the planning
and running of the Centre.

THE SHORTHAND CLASS (Continued)
The success
that spelled disaster
He became a member of our
community, took part in our cultural
visits and outings, mingled with those
who had learned to read, with the
instructors and their assistants who
had become his friends. More than
that, he participated in the democratic
life of the Centre, and as one the
members of the "Centristi" Assembly,
he had a voice in the adoption of
specific projects for the future. With
time, "Training in Democracy" thus
became the main feature of the Cen¬
tre's activities.
The pride taken in the Centre by the
participants was really quite extraordi¬
nary. Every day letters sent to us by
our former students arrived by the
bag-load from every continent. By
1956-1957, as a result of our methods,
illiteracy as such had virtually vanished
from Santulussurgiu.
But then we saw that something
had gone awry. It awoke us to the
fact that we could not sit back on
our laurels and be content merely
with our literacy and cultural pro¬
gramme. We found that despite the
devotion of our voluntary teams
(working hours were from 2 p.m. to
2 or 3 a.m.) the results were often
disappointing.
As our students learned to read
their judgement and critical faculties
developed and they became painfully
aware of the backwardness of their
environment. Instinctively they felt
an urge to emigrate, to get away
from such surroundings.
Thus, by sparking this feeling of
discontent and anguish we were ac¬
tually encouraging emigration, which
is after all a logical reaction of people
who aspire after something and find
it denied to them by conditions in
their own region. Our Centre, in a
sense, was like a railway station
waiting room where everyone is on
the point of departure.
Faced with this situation, we promp¬
tly undertook a careful re-appraisal
of the aims of our institution to see
how our work could be remoulded to
meet this broader social and eco¬
nomic dilemma. We wanted our
work to bring prosperity to our own
land and not of course to encourage
the migration of the population to
more favoured regions elsewhere in
the world.
But what could our Centre possi¬
bly do about it? As teachers and
members of the liberal professions we
were in no position to transform our
educational institution into an em¬
ployment bureau to provide work for
our students. For that, a miracle
would have been needed. But just
becoming aware of the problem was
in itself a miracle
Intellectuals are often so wrapped
up in their own professions and inte¬
rests that nothing else counts. Here,
on the contrary, something else did
count. And so, despite ourselves and
our rather abstract interests, we found
ourselves forced to descend to more
practical levels, into the slippery
arena of production, trade and other
business questions we had never
envisaged.
A ROUND the years 1957-
1958 the unemployment of women had
become one of the big social problems
of Santulussurgiu. In our town women
at home are usually divided into one
of two categories: married women
dependent on their husbands who
support the family; unmarried women
(many of whom never marry) depen¬
dent, on their parents or brothers.
We decided to try a new experi¬
ment the development of our local
crafts by transforming one of the
oldest traditions of Sardinia, the hand
weaving craft (carpets and textiles)
into a full fledged market industry.
In other words, to change a subsis¬
tence economy into a developed pro¬
duction economy.
The problem was how to go about
it. Our traditional looms were so
rudimentary in construction that out¬
put could never match the speed
required to ensure low, competitive
prices. The only answer was to get
rid of the old looms and bring in
modern ones like the Jacquard loom.
The opposition from the womenfolk,
accustomed to the traditional ways
for generations, can well be imagi¬
ned. In the end, however, we won
out. The changes were made, but
not without much psychological and
physical hand-wringing.
How well I recall the apprehensions
of the young women we brought
together to form our first weavers'
co-operative. After working for a
whole year without knowing what the
outcome would be, they awaited,
trembling with emotion, the news that
their efforts had really shown a profit.
Swatches and samples had to be
made and distributed, market research
had to be carried out, and prepara¬
tions made to fill the first orders.
But the women had faith in us and
in the Centre that had helped and
guided them over the years. At last
success did come. And when it did,
the attitude of the adult population
to education changed overnight.
To be an ordinary labourer working
only for the money it brings is one
thing; to be a member of a co-op¬
erative sharing responsibility for its
management is another. It demanded
much more from each individual: pro¬
ficiency in public relations, market
research, costing procedures, as well
as a constant effort to improve the
final product. All these new ideas
required a new spirit and a new
approach along with new knowledge
and know-how.
The demands on the Centre grew
steadily as the number of students
rose. There were requests for cour¬
ses in economics, accounting, the
history of art and many other subjects
It was no longer illiteracy that was
now our big problem but how to fill
the gap of ignorance that prevented
the citizens of our town from carrying
out their new activities.
The swift pace of modern life
demands of all of us, wherever we
live, that we keep abreast of the latest
developments -in our changing world.
It is this, more than anything else,
that has made the modern concept
of life-long education so vital today.
There are now five flourishing co¬
operatives in Santulussurgiu, one for
weaving, another for knitwear pro¬
duction, a third for the manufacture
of gloves (mass-produced and expor¬
ted abroad), the fourth for cabinet
making and wood-carving, and the
fifth and most recent one, a cattle-
breeding co-operative with 127 mem¬
bers. These are not simply commer¬
cial firms but true co-operatives born
out of our cultural activities and sus¬
taining these cultural activities.
After sixteen years of effort, I think
I can say that the evolution and
re-thinking that has marked our insti¬
tution has permitted us to set up
methods and instruments of produc¬
tion that are also methods and instru¬
ments of education.
In other words, by attacking illite¬
racy within our local framework we
have managed to attain a standard
of adult training to organize a num¬
ber of truly modern commercial enter¬
prises that are contributing to the
social and economic development of
our region, and thereby extracating
us - from the poverty and ignorance
that have plagued us for generations.

A talk with
Princess Ashraf of Iran
Her Highness Princess Ashraf, sister of His Imperial Majesty the
Shahinshah of Iran, recently accorded an exclusive interview to the
"Unesco Courier" on the problems of illiteracy. Chairman of Unesco's
International Consultative Liaison Committee for Literacy, Princess
Ashraf has for many years played a leading role in the struggle against
illiteracy both in her country and in other parts of the world.
Princess Ashraf Pahlavi (on left) sister
of His Imperial Majesty the Shahinshah
of Iran, presents the 1967
Mohamed Reza Pahlavi Prize for
outstanding work in literacy to Rose
Omari, a Tanzanian schoolgirl,
representing the Tabora Girls Secondary
School (Tanzania). Girls at the school
were awarded the prize
at Unesco's H.Q. in Paris, on
International Literacy Day, September 8,
1967, as volunteers who taught 400
adults to read and write.
Iran's Army of Knowledge an education corps of young soldiers
who spend their entire military service as teachers in villages and
country hamlets is now world famous. Recruits are used to teach
parents and children to read and write Persian and improve their living
conditions. Here as an adult class in a school courtyard near Kazvin
(north-west Iran) is about to end, a little boy crosses the threshold for
the next class.
QUESTION. For years you have
played a leading role in the world
struggle to wipe out literacy. Can
you tell us Your Highness, what led
you to take an active part in meeting
this problem?
ANSWER. For that we have to
go back 25 years to the early 1940s.
At that time I became interested in the
social and health problems of my
country and this opened my eyes to
the magnitude of illiteracy in Iran.
One step soon led to another, and
then about nine or ten years ago our
big literacy programme began to take
shape. It was launched a good four
years before the Teheran Conference
of 1965 on Illiteracy.
After the conference, the campaign
became one of our primary objectives.
A National Literacy Committee was
set up with the Empress as President
and myself as Vice-President and
many prominent Iranians as members.
It is difficult to say at this stage how
successful we have been thus far, for
up to now our work has been more or
less exploratory. Iran is a big country
with many traditions and customs and
these do not always allow for quick
change. We have found that the
poorest, most backward parts of our
country are the hardest to make lite¬
rate. Many adults, especially women,
are not interested in going to school,
and we have a big job in trying to
persuade them to do so. Nevertheless,
1 am convinced that within the next 20

The ruins of Susa, a city which flourished 7,000 years ago, stand near the
Dez River in Western Iran, its palaces and monuments recalling the splendours
of the ancient kingdom of Elam. One of the world's oldest cities, Susa was
destroyed on several occasions. Darius I and Artaxerxes built magnificent palaces
there, and adorned it with innumerable art treasures including ceramics and
bronze and stone sculptures. The royal audience hall of King Darius covered
no less than two and a half acres. Down the centuries the broad, fertile lands
surrounding the city became parched and arid. Today, fed by waters from a vast
irrigation network supplied from a 650 ft. high dam across the Dez River, they
are producing up to seven crops of alfalfa a year. Built with aid from the
World Bank, the dam (shown here under construction) is part of a major economic
development project, incorporating literacy programmes for the local people.
or 30 years illiteracy will no longer be
a problem in Iran But as long as
illiterate persons exist anywhere in the
world the struggle must go on for
everyone.
Q. Is it not true that the Army
of Knowledge has achieved some
rather remarkable results which are
now world famous?
A. Yes it has. The Army of
Knowledge has done and is doing
an extraordinary job. But this does
not mean we have solved our prob¬
lems. As long as Iran's 6 to 12 year
old children do not attend school,
illiteracy will remain a problem. If we
really wish to eradicate illiteracy we
must strike at the root of the problem,
the education of our children.
Iran is now spending as much as
30 to 35 per cent of its national budget
on education. In about five years,
99 per cent of the children in our
towns will be going to school, but in
the villages only one child in two will
be attending classes. This means that
many of our children who are now
seven or eight will add to the number
of illiterates tomorrow. We are plan¬
ning a complete overhaul of our educa¬
tional system to try to meet this
situation, but at the same time our
Committee is tackling the problem of
our 14 and 15 year old teenagers who
have never been to school.
Q. I believe that Iran has had an
important role to play in the new idea
of functional literacy linked to dev¬
elopment, has it not?
A. Like many countries we in
Iran first thought that literacy by itself
was the answer to progress. But it
doesn't always work that way. And
we found ourselves asking the ques¬
tion: "Literacy for what?" Let me give
you an example. Our Literacy Com¬
mittee appointed a team of educators
and asked me to participate, to outline
a programme for one of the poorest
regions of our country where 97 per
cent of the women are illiterate.
Well, after investigating conditions
there we decided to use most of our
budget to build a dam and a roadl
Only then would the blackboards and
chalk be useful. You see, we had long
talks with the inhabitants in their tents.
When we told them they had to learn
to read and write they thought we
were madl They told us they had
barely enough food and water or
medicine for their children. We
understood that if we wanted to make
any real progress we had to view
the whole problem of illiteracy in
terms of development.

Q. As President of the Union of
Iranian Women, would you say that
the women of your country present
a special problem? Are they inte¬
rested in learning modern ways and in
education generally?
A. I do not think it difficult to
convince women to adopt modern
ways. In our country, as elsewhere,
women have not been emancipated
for very long. Schools and univer¬
sities have been opened to them
only in the past 40 years. But even
today women find themselves at a
distinct disadvantage from every point
of view when compared to men. This
is especially true in the rural areas.
In our villages a girl still has difficulty
attending the same class as the boys
when the teacher is a man.
Despite this, I place my greatest
hopes in the women of my country.
Their influence in the home is enor¬
mous. They can persuade their hus¬
bands or their fathers that it is no sin
for a girl to get an education. The
Koran, you know, makes no distinction
between men and women. In fact it
says that every man and every woman
must read, that it is their duty to learn
to read. But over the centuries the
words of the Prophet have been dis¬
torted by prejudice. No one can deny,
however, that the Prophet's mission
started with the one word READ.
And our people are fully aware of this.
Yes, women are perhaps our most
valuable asset: they are eager to learn,
they want their children to be edu¬
cated, they understand the great
changes the literacy campaign hopes
to bring about. I need hardly add that
those women who have had an edu¬
cation are among our strongest and
most vocal supporters. In Iran, as in
most countries, 75 per cent of the
educated women choose teaching as a
profession.
Q. How would you describe the
present role of literacy within the
framework of a nation's economic
development?
A. Literacy is the ladder or
springboard. The goal is the develop¬
ment of the country, the development
of every man and woman. It is not
literacy for literacy's sake. The ulti¬
mate aim is to equip people to work
better and live a better life. Once
men and women have had even a
little education their life changes. A
literacy campaign acts like a catalytic
agent; it encourages a'person and the
community he lives in to want to
improve standards of living which are
no longer compatible with the modern
world.

Masterpieces of colour and

centuries-old craft. A good

when the wool is compact

often a surprise to visitors to

'Our only realistic hope of achieving the
total eradication of illiteracy is by a
complete reversal of traditional attitudes
and by regarding eradication not only
as an end in itself, but as one which
must be attained at once and at all costs'
by Sir Charles Jeffries
We publish below the final chapter from a recent book, "Illiteracy: A World Prob¬
lem" by Sir Charles Jeffries (Pall Mall Press, London, Frederick A. Praeger,
New York, 1967). Sir Charles advocates a much broader frontal assault on
the world problems of illiteracy than Unesco does at the present stage. Never¬
theless the "Unesco Courier" feels that the reflections of this important world
personality will help to bring into sharper focus for world opinion the dramatic
situation created by the growing number of illiterates in the world today.

SIR CHARLES JEFFRIES has had a dis¬
tinguished career m British Government ser¬
vice. He is now Secretary of the Ranfurly
Library Service, London, a non-profit or¬
ganization helping in the struggle against
illiteracy by sending books as free gifts
to developing countries where educational,
social and economic progress is ham¬
pered by a shortage of suitable reading
material. In addition to his latest book on
Illiteracy, Sir Charles is the author of many
books, including "Transfer to Power: Prob¬
lems of the Passage to Self-Government"
(1960) and "Ceylon: The Path to Indepen¬
dence" (1962).
to the war against illiteracy, it is im¬
possible not to be inspired by the
many efforts in so many parts of the
world pressing towards the same end.
To make a complete catalogue would
fill many volumes. I can only here
pick out a few illustrations at random.
For instance, in north-east Brazil,
where the illiteracy rate is about 75
per cent, there is the Cruzada ABC
which aims, with the support of the
Presbyterian churches in America, to
produce one million adult literates by
1970. There is, in Zambia, a similar
target set by the Ministry for Commun¬
ity Development and Social Welfare.
In Bolivia, there are "nuclear schools",
which have nothing to do with atomic
physics but are rural schools used as
the "nuclei" of intensive drives against
illiteracy.
In Delhi, capital of India, with a
quarter of a million illiterates,
thousands are being taught to read
in hundreds of classes organized by
the city's Adult Education Board; and
the same kind of thing is happening
in other cities of India. In Iran, the
army is on the march in this peaceful
war. In Kenya and the Ivory Coast,
television has been brought into the
battle. In Cameroon, thousands of
school teachers keep their schools
open after hours, teaching the mothers
the same lessons that their children
have learned during the day.

some instances at random from the
official statistics, the number of adults
taught to read and write in 1962 was
191,273 in Ethiopia, 4,000 in Malawi,
18,783 in Rhodesia. In 1963 nearly
400,000 learned in Iran, 116,000 in
Mexico.
Reading the many reports, with
their genuine record of success and
their heartening evidence of so much
good done to so many people, one
is tempted, despite the immensity of
the task, to take comfort from Clough's
well-known lines:
For while the tired waves, vainly
[breaking,
Seem here no painful inch to gam,
Far back, through creeks and inlets
[making,
Comes silent, flooding in, the
[main.
One is tempted: but it will not do.
While I have been writing this book,
the number of people alive in the world
has increased by something like the
whole current population of the British
Isles. In the six years 1961-66, the
number of illiterates in the world has
increased by something like 200
million. By how much (if at all) has
the capacity of the world to feed its
people increased in this period? The
inability of 1,000 million people to
read and write remains a millstone
round the neck of progress . . .
Up to now, men have been comforted
by the notion that, with the develop¬
ment of universal primary education,
the problem will solve itself, not as
quickly as the idealist might have
hoped, but still within a generation or
two. This, after all, is what has
happened in the developed countries.

and economic factors related to illiter¬
acy, obviously the most important is

FOR TOTAL ERADICATION (Continued)
'Like learning to walk,

the education of children in primary
schools. If all children of school age
in any country attended school for a
sufficient length of time, there would
eventually be no adult illiterates in the
population, except those mentally
deficient and incapable of learning
to read and write. It follows, therefore,
that the best means of preventing
illiteracy is to provide adequate educa¬
tion for all children."
So stated an official Unesco publi¬
cation in 1957 (1). And a Committee of
the Commonwealth Education Confe¬
rence of 1964 declared: "The target for
the main long-term effort to eradicate
illiteracy is obviously in the schools."
T
28
HE word "obviously" is
recurrent and significant Punch used
to have a feature called "Glimpses of
the Obvious", in which it ridiculed por¬
tentous platitudes in public pronoun¬
cements. I have no wish to ridicule
these statements, which are "ob¬
viously" true, but the attitude they
express is based on an illusion which
has now been shattered
Quoting United Nations statistics,
the Population Profile issued by the
Population Reference Bureau Inc. of
Washington, DC, on September 26,
1966, revealed that, of the 373 million
school-age children in the world, only
about 115 million or 30 per cent are
in school; and of those who are, the
majority will not even complete the
primary course and will very likely
relapse into illiteracy.
Even in a relatively advanced country
such as Brazil, the average number
of years of education completed is
little over two and a half. In India
(to quote the same authoritative
source), there are 55 million children
in school, of whom 40 million are in
the elementary grades, and 132.5
million not receiving any formal edu¬
cation. The population of India is
growing by at least 12 million a year.
A parallel situation exists over vast
areas of Asia, Africa and Latin Ameri¬
ca. Nearly 85 per cent of the births
occurring in the world today take place
in the "developing" areas, and in many
of these countries something like half
(1) World Illiteracy at Mid-Century.
the total population is under the age
of twenty-one.
In the teeth of these stark and
inescapable facts, only the most
ostrich-like complacency could pretend
that any substance remains in the con¬
ventional assumption that the problem
of illiteracy will be solved in any
foreseeable time by the operation of
an expanded system of formal educa¬
tion.
The countries concerned already
devote a much greater proportion of
their national budgets to education
than do the developed countries on
an average some 15 to 20 per cent as
against some 10 to 15 per cent. Even
if there were no question of population
increase, existing educational budgets
would have to be doubled or trebled
at once in order to provide primary
schooling for anything like every child
in the world.
It is evident that this is simply not
practicable. The difficulty is not
merely financial. Schools have to be
organized, built and staffed. Buildings
might be improvised, but teachers can¬
not be produced by improvisation.
They can only be obtained from the
ranks of the relatively few people who,
in the developing countries, have
themselves had enough education to
enter the teaching profession. Such
people are naturally in great demand
for other and usually less exacting
and more remunerative or glamorous
kinds of employment.
Those who are willing to teach have
to be trained; training institutions have
to be arranged for, and this takes time
as does the training itself. Mean¬
while, the number of babies born con¬
tinues to increase, and the number of
infants who die continues to decrease.
To add the final touch of gloom, one
must recall that, in any case, a large
proportion of the children taught will
get no lasting benefit from their school¬
ing and will quickly reinforce the ranks
of the adult illiterates.
It is a losing battle, and the conclu¬
sion cannot be escaped that the world
will be lucky if it can keep the numbers
of adult illiterates from continuing to
increase above the thousand million
during the rest of the century, how¬
ever much it may succeed in reducing
the percentages of illiterates in the
population. Must the battle be lost?
I believe not, if the strategy and tactics
can be radically changed before it be¬
comes too late. But it is a very big
"if".
It took the U.S.S.R. from twenty to
forty years to break the back of its
problem of illiteracy. It took forty-four
years to raise the literacy rate in the
Philippines from something like 5 per
cent to something like 75 per cent; and
at that rate it continues to stand.
Since the number of adult illiterates
remains fairly steady round about
4 million, the islands after all the
effort still have to be classed as an
"area of illiteracy".
But the world has not now got forty
or even twenty years to indulge in the
luxury of illiteracy. The information I
have examined in the writing of this
book has led me to the firm conviction
that there can be no half measures in
tackling this problem. Nothing short
of an all-out effort to achieve 100 per
cent literacy (or as near as may be)
everywhere and at once is worth
doing.
I T is true that any literacy
campaign does at least benefit some,
perhaps many individuals, and that is
all to the good. If, however, it
succeeds only in making a proportion
of the population literate, experience
shows that at a certain level, varying
from country to country, progress slows
down or stops altogether, so that the
percentage of illiterates in the country
concerned remains stable or decreases
very slowly.
So long as that figure remains at,
say, 25 per cent or more (and in seve¬
ral areas it is more like 75 per cent),
the country is open to all the internal
evils which result from "two nations"
of first-class and second-class citi¬
zens; while in its external relations it
continues to be at a disadvantage com¬
pared with countries in which illiteracy
has ceased to exist to any significant
extent. The dangers of perpetuating
these divisions in the present explo¬
sive world situation do not need to be
demonstrated.
Of course, universal literacy cannot
in itself make the world better, richer
or more peaceful: that depends upon
people Literacy is a tool, and what
matters is how people use it. But it

does give people a chance which,
without it, they do not have.
It is arguable that people would
have been happier if they had been left
to pursue a simple way of life outside
the turmoil of the contemporary world;
but the argument is pointless, because
the contemporary world is one world
and all the people are involved in it
together, whether they like it or not.
We have to accept that fact, and make
terms with the world as it is.
If it is agreed that an all-out effort
must be made, the first and basic need
is to get clear the relationship between
literacy and "education". However
right in principle it may be to regard
the eradication of illiteracy as an edu¬
cational problem, the practical fact is
that, in .this case, the best is the ene¬
my of the good.
Education involves much more than
teaching people to read and write.
That is the whole point. It is the
"much more" which the world cannot
afford. Learning to read and write,
whether by an adult or by a child, is
not in itself education. It is the acqui¬
sition of a skill. It is in the same cate¬
gory as learning to walk, to talk, to
prepare food, to sow seeds, hoe a
field, ride a bicycle or swim.
No one thinks of these things as
education. They are skills which peo¬
ple need in order to live as human
beings, and they are learned and
taught within the circle of family or
neighbourhood. Anyone who has
learned them can teach others and
does so as a matter of course, without
any organized system. "
s.IURELY it is evident that,
if the politicians, planners and admi¬
nistrators would accept this view of
the problem of illiteracy, an entirely
new and simpler approach to its solu¬
tion would at once become possible.
By all means let educational program¬
mes multiply and develop as fast as
they can: no sensible person would
wish to prejudice their progress. We
are not here concerned, however, with
those who can benefit from them. Our
concern is with the millions of children
who will never go to school and with
the millions of adults who have never
had the chance of going to school.
I yield to none in my respect for
educationists and their work, but the
fact that the problem of illiteracy has
usually been considered as part of
their department has tended to cloud
the real issue. With the best inten
tions, the Teheran Congress on the
Eradication of Illiteracy in 1965, and
other authoritative bodies have urged
the importance of not treating the era¬
dication of illiteracy as an end in itself
and of integrating it with programmes
of child and adult education.
Nothing else was to be expected;
yet I suggest that it is fundamentally
wrong, in the practical situation in
which the world is placed, to hold back
the teaching of literacy while educa¬
tional and social programmes are being
developed. It is only by a complete
reversal of traditional attitudes and by
regarding the eradication of illiteracy
not only as an end in itself, but as
an end which must be attained at once
and at all costs, that the world has
any realistic hope of achieving it.
Indeed, it offers the only hope of
ultimately securing the necessary ex¬
pansion of the educational system
proper, and of ensuring that the money
poured into it is not, as at present,
largely wasted.
It is surely self-evident that a com¬
munity in which everyone can read
and write whether or not it has a
developed educational system is in a
far better condition to maintain itself
and improve its position in the cir¬
cumstances of the modern world than

FOR TOTAL ERADICATION (Continued)
If the world wants its people to be literate,
it can have that
and the moon as well'
a community in which only a limited
number of people are literate.
Once people are able to read and
write, they can educate themselves,
provided that they have access to the
necessary literature; this is an absolute
condition of success. Not all will be
able or willing to take advantage of
the opportunities which literacy opens
up to them, but many will.
This is true of adults: it is even
more true of the young. Moreover,
the children who do go to school will
not afterwards suffer the fate of
those who return to an illiterate
environment. Thus, the eradication of
illiteracy will both make for greater
general prosperity, enabling more to
be spent on formal education, and also
be a potent factor in progress towards
the ideal of an educated society.
The target of concentrated effort
must, therefore, be the establishment
of a universal social custom by which
all children, whether they go to school
or not, will be taught to read and write
as certainly and as naturally as they
are taught to talk and walk.
Whenever adults are taught literacy,
they must at the same time have it
impressed on them that their first duty
is to pass the skill on to their own
families and children. For a literate
parent to have illiterate children should
be stigmatised as a social disgrace.
I
30
HIS will not, however,
entirely solve the problem, since there
are many communities in which there
is no early prospect of even a majority
of adults of the present generation
becoming literate. In such cases, it
will be necessary to extend the scope
of literacy programmes to cover out-
of-school children as well as adults.
But, if literacy is to be taken out of
the purview of the education or "com¬
munity development" authorities, who
is to look after it? If I were prime
minister of a developing country, I
would create a Ministry of Literacy and
give the minister full cabinet rank and
no other responsibilities. I doubt if it
could be done any other way for, of
course, it involves spending a lot more
money than has hitherto been thought
of as the suitable allocation for literacy
work, and the money will have to be
fought for at the highest level.
In theory, it could be argued that the
issue is so important that existing
educational or other programmes
should be cut back in its favour; but
such a proposition would hardly be
likely to receive general assent. It is
more practical and more in the inte¬
rests of the developing countries to
assume that the cost of expanding
literacy teaching for children and adults
will need funds over and above exist¬
ing budgets. What, then, would be
involved?
The whole basis of the approach
now suggested is that literacy instruc¬
tion needs no special expertise or pro¬
fessional qualification. Anyone of
average ability and intelligence can be
trained to do it, and, once it ceases
to be mixed up with other educational
and social activities, it can be entrusted
in the main to parents, relatives and
public-spirited volunteers. Paid staff
will be needed only for organization
and administration.
Primers, teaching aids and reading
matter at various levels will be essen¬
tial, and this will be the chief item of
expense; but for the most part it will
only involve making larger printings
of material already prepared in con¬
nexion with school or adult education
programmes.
It will be recollected that, in 1963,
Unesco estimated that it would cost
about £700 million to make 330 million
adults literate in ten years. If we
double this to bring in the children,
and add half as much again to the
total to cover rising costs, a figure of
£2,000 million may be taken to repre¬
sent the rough overall cost of eradi¬
cating illiteracy.
Though this is only a guess, I sug¬
gest that it may fairly be accepted as
a reasonable estimate of the money
required. £2,000 million is a huge
sum, but it does not look so large if
it is considered as £200 million a year
for ten years. In the 1963 estimate,
it was calculated that the developing
countries themselves could produce
75 per cent about £500 million of
the £700 million needed.
One of the reasons why it was not
practicable to proceed with the 1963
scheme was that those countries
found it difficult to see their way to
providing so high a proportion of the
cost from their own resources.
Nevertheless, it is fair to assume, for
present purposes, that they should be
able to find an average of £50 million
a year, bringing the amount needed
to be provided by the world collec¬
tively down to £150 million a year.
c ONTRIBUTIONS towards
this large sum which could be made
by charitables sources might be quite
substantial. Most fund-raising pro¬
jects in this context have so far been
initiated by religious bodies and mainly
supported by members of churches.
An appeal made on broad grounds of
humanity and the public interest might
well, if efficiently conducted, succeed
in attracting a considerable response
in the more affluent countries from
people who are indifferent or even
hostile to avowedly religious causes.
Even so, the bulk of the money
would certainly have to come from
government sources under interna¬
tional or bilateral aid schemes. It may
be said that this is asking for the
moon; it is precisely that. "Whether
we reach the moon is quite unimpor¬
tant in comparison to the question
whether we will help human beings to
live, and to live as human beings are
meant to live", says Dr Visser 't Hooft,
former Secretary of the World Council
of Churches.
I do not know, any more than any
other member of the public, how much
the world collectively is spending
annually on space research and travel,
let alone on producing weapons of
destruction which would defeat their
own object if ever used. One must
guard against the dangers of over¬
simplification, of course,' and it would
be naive to suppose that the great
powers are at all likely to reduce their
space and defence programmes in or¬
der to promote universal literacy, how¬
ever sensible they would show them¬
selves to be in doing so.
Yet there is really no need to pose
these as alternatives. In the scale of
public expenditure by the affluent na¬
tions, the cost of eradicating illiteracy,
if shared among them, would be trivial.
If the world wants its people to be
literate, it can have that and the moon
as well. Moreover, it is an important
consideration that, if the job is once

thoroughly done, it will never have to
be done again. The expenditure will
not be recurrent.
It is beyond question that the estab¬
lishment of universal illiteracy would
enormously increase the human re¬
sources available for scientific and
intellectual as well as economic pro¬
gress. It would greatly improve the
prospect of finding solutions to the
problems arising from the growth in
the world population. It might even
affect that growth, for the undoubted
statistical connexion between popu¬
lation increase and low standard of
living may also indicate a connexion
with a high rate of illiteracy.
At any rate, it is a fact coinciden¬
tal or not that, leaving out of account
changes in population due to migration,
the rise in numbers in countries with
a low illiteracy rate tends to be appre¬
ciably slower than in those with a high
illiteracy rate.
The Teheran Conference of 1965,
"convinced that the struggle against
illiteracy, aimed at the total eradica¬
tion from our planet of the scourge of
ignorance, is a moral imperative for
our generation," concluded its recom¬
mendations with:
A SOLEMN AND URGENT APPEAL
To the United Nations, its Specialized
Agencies and, in the first place to
Unesco;
to regional bodies concerned with de¬
velopment in general and education
in particular;
to non-governmental organizations
which include assistance, direct or
indirect, to education in their opera¬
tional programmes;
to religious, social and cultural institu¬
tions;
to national and international founda¬
tions, both public and private;
to educators, scientists and scholars,
to economic and trade union leaders,
and to all men of goodwill:
to do everything in their power to
arouse public opinion with a view to
intensifying and accelerating the world¬
wide attack on illiteracy; and in parti¬
cular to exert their influence on all
responsible leaders:
to ensure that literacy work is an
integral and essential part of every
development plan in countries where
illiteracy is rife;
to increase, so far as may be prac¬
ticable and appropriate, the national
and international resources set aside
for the fight against illiteracy;
to make possible the provision of
additional resources for development
in general and for literacy work in par¬
ticular as and when further funds be¬
come available through a reduction of
military expenditures or for other
reasons;
to harness to the full all available
information media for propagating the
new concept of adult literacy;
to ensure that priority in the alloca¬
tion of available resources is accorded
to the fight against the great human
afflictions that constitute a major
threat to peace, namely hunger,
disease and ignorance, among which
illiteracy occupies a place of key im¬
portance.
"To arouse public opinion"... that
is the root of the matter. This is sup¬
posed to be the age of democracy,
the century of the common man. Yet
such is the fantastic paradox of the
times it is notorious that, in the great
public matters which most nearly affect
his life and welfare, the common man
too often finds himself inexorably
involved in programmes and policies
for which he must labour, pay and die,
but to which he is personally indiffe¬
rent or positively opposed.
T HE will of the people
cannot prevail unless it is founded on
knowledge, clearly stated and effec¬
tively communicated. An illiterate
people has neither access to know¬
ledge nor ability to formulate its wishes
and express them in the places where
decisions are taken.
If the common peoples of the world
once realize what they are needlessly
losing through the handicap of illiter¬
acy, they will demand that, in the
words of the Conference report, "like
all other forms of bondage, illiteracy
the enslaving of the mind must be
abolished".
If they once realize that, if only the
authorities will take the trouble, it can
be abolished, once and for all, within
a reasonable time and at relatively
moderate cost, they will demand im- 01
mediate, resolute and effective action, V I
and be ready to provide the necessary
money and manpower.

International Year
for Human Rights
MESSAGE
FROM
RENÉ MAHEU
Director-General of Unesco
T
32
HE Universal Declaration of Human Rights,
the 20th anniversary of which is being celebrated
this year as International Human Rights Year, is the
first code of ethics adopted for all mankind. Our
modern world, marked by constant changes in living
standards and in its very structure, yearns for order
and unity in face of the ominous forces and dangers
that threaten us on this checkerboard planet of
progress and poverty.
The international community is no longer a cir¬
cumscribed society; it has become universal. Vast
numbers of peoples, differing greatly in origin,
traditions, religion, philosophy, culture, historical
development and economic systems have attained
independence, have entered on to the political scene,
and are now sharing in the elaboration of the moral
code and law of our time. The 1948 Declaration is in
accord with this fundamental transformation which it
foreshadowed.
The constitutions and laws enacted by the authori¬
ties of different nations define the rights and the
duties of their own citizens. Religious and philoso¬
phical doctrines find their following mainly among the
devout and the faithful. But the Universal Declara¬
tion is meant for all mankind and proclaims the equal
dignity of all human beings.
Its Articles provide that every person, without dis¬
tinction, of any kind, such as race, colour, sex, lan¬
guage, religion, political or other opinions, national or
social origin, means, birth or status, is entitled to all
the rights and all the freedoms which are set forth
therein, and which should enable every person to live,
to think, to express himself, to act, to create, to en¬
joy and to forge with others the future of all.
A code of ethics that seeks to inspire men's actions
in a changing world, and to engage individuals and
States of widely differing cultures, cannot advocate
any specific belief other than the inalienable right of
every person to his own freedom. But the practical
exercise of freedom that is conscious of its own
dignity and responsible for the dignity of others pre¬
supposes the fulfilment of certain conditions. That is
why the Universal Declaration sets out a number of
specific rights of man.
First and foremost every individual should be free
from the constraints of force, and at the same time
his most elementary needs must be satisfied. It
follows that every person has the right to a standard
of living adequate to the health and well-being of
himself and his family. He also has the right to
benefit from the general progress brought about by
scientific and technological development, and himself
to contribute to this progress. But the practical exer¬
cise of conscious and responsible freedom also
presupposes that every individual has had an oppor¬
tunity of acquiring, to the best of his abilities, the
intellectual and cultural training and the knowledge
necessary to understand the world around him. He
therefore has a right to an education which enables
him to develop his personality and to participate, both
in his work and by his exercise of choice, in the poli¬
tical, economic, social and cultural life of his commu¬
nity, and in the decisions which govern their evolution.
A Universal Declaration is both weaker and stron¬
ger than a national juridical text. It defines and speci¬
fies the duties of all men, and virtually places the
actions of all countries and statesmen before the court
of world public opinion. By defining the specific
rights of each individual the Declaration strengthens
the restraining force of world public opinion and acts
as a deterrent to those who would flout it. The
Declaration's effectiveness depends very largely on
the real existence and the strength of that common
conscience which has slowly matured through the
long years of man's history, and which must be
encouraged in the minds of all by making each indi¬
vidual aware of his fellowship with all mankind.
In a world where vast areas are still in the
grip of hunger and malnutrition, and where more than
700,000,000 illiterate persons are shut out from the
world of ideas mirrored in the written word, there are
many people for whom the provisions of the Universal
Declaration are still nothing more than empty promi¬
ses. But the tremendous resources of science and
technology now make it possible for those promises
to be fulfilled. Poverty, hunger and ignorance are no
longer inevitable. It is our duty to overcome them by
making education, science and culture available to all
as the essential pre-requisite for the progress of
society and the full development of the human per¬
sonality.
This is the plane on which Unesco is making its
contribution to the work begun by the United Nations.
Even those of Unesco's activities which are not
directly concerned with promoting respect for human
rights in general or certain specific rights, do never¬
theless help to create the material, intellectual, moral
and cultural conditions indispensable for lifting these
rights from the level of principles to that of living
realities for all mankind.
It is my fervent hope that the International Con¬
ference on Human Rights which opens this month in
Teheran, under the auspices of the United Nations,
will prove to be the occasion for the world to assert
with greater clarity and unity its determination to
achieve increasing respect for the full dignity of the
individual and the ultimate mastery of man over his
destiny.

Letters to the Editor
MOST NORTHERLY
METROPOLIS
Sir,
Your issue "USSRToday" (Nov.
1967) states that Leningrad is the
northernmost large city of the world.
This statement was also made by our
courier when I was visiting Leningrad
this last summer.
Actually, Oslo, Norway's capital, is
on the same latitude and Finland's
Helsinki is slightly further north. It
appears to be one of those Russian
misconceptions that nobody challen¬
ges.
Lois Hemming
Manningtree, U.K.
The latitudes and populations of the
three cities are: Helsinki (60° 9' 42";
485,000), Leningrad (59° 56' 32"; over
3 million), Oslo (59° 54' 43"; 520,000).
U.S.S.R. TODAY
Sir,
I enjoyed reading the issue on the
U.S.S R. whose citizens have applied
their courage and capacity for orga¬
nization to the development of their
country They have demonstrated with
what ardour and determination indiv¬
idual men and women can work toge¬
ther to build a new nation and thus
help to achieve great results.
Martine Louvet
Lons-le-Saunier, France
RECLAIMING BARREN LANDS
Sir,
Your article, "A New Form of Aid
for Development", concerning the
World Food Programme (Oct. 1967)
calls attention to a problem of the
very first magnitude which at times
seems hopeless to solve. It is hearten¬
ing, however, to know that there is
an answer, and this is clearly outlined
in the recent book "Sahara Conquest"
by Richard St. Barbe Baker (Lutter¬
worth Press, London, 1966). He has
proved it is possible to halt the already
advancing deserts, to stem the floods
in eroded areas, and to reclaim barren
land by correct methods of sylviculture
coupled with certain modem tech¬
niques.

Binstead, Isle of Wight, U.K.
THE WORLD WE HOPE FOR
I read "The World We Hope For"
by Mana-Cristina Costa Diaz (Feb.
1968) with particular interest because
it corresponds exactly to the results,
of an opinion poll I carried out among
fellow students (French and other
nationalities) in the International Lycée
at St. Germain-en-Laye, near Paris.
Certain of the views expressed by
these teen-agers (15 and 16 years)
were nevertheless rather pessimistic
as to the future of our world Some
were convinced, for example, that
having failed to make proper use of
atomic energy, mankind would end
up by destroying itself. In the present
state of affairs, there are indeed good
reasons for fearing that that day is no
longer far distant
But the majority of these young
people did agree on one thing, that
science has conferred on us the status
of gods before we have even demon¬
strated our worth as human beings
Is it too late to hope, as Paul Cou-
derc writes in the same issue, that
"the triumph of science must ultimate¬
ly engender peace by endowing all
mankind with better means of live¬
lihood, more leisure, more culture and
greater reasoning powers"? I do not
think so
Progress put an end to the age of
the cave-dwellers; why should it not
put an end to the age of the barrack-
dwellers?
That is why I sincerely endorse the
hopes expressed by Mana-Cristina
Costa Diaz with whom, if you will put
me in touch, I would be happy to
correspond in English, French or Ger¬
man. May I say how much I admire
the "Unesco Courier" and how closely
I follow its efforts.

APOLOGISTS OF APARTHEID
Sir,
Congratulations on the article,
"Racism under the Mask" by John Rex
(Jan. 1968). As for the correspondent
who forbad his daughter to renew her
subscription because of your issue on
Apartheid (March 1967), his action
deserves the strongest condemnation.
It is deplorable to find that some
people are still ready to vindicate such
a shameful idea. And do we need to
act like despots towards our children
and arbitrarily impose our own
opinions on them?
Mounir Hamidou
Tlemcen, Algeria
Sir,
My reaction to the letter headed
"No comment" (January 1968) is one
of deep indignation. How can anyone
use the term "sons of cannibals"
after seeing the look of sad entreaty
and the expression of tenderness and
dignity in the eyes of the Negro
father holding his sick child in his
arms (photo page 13)
I hope that one day soon, thanks
to Unesco and to the efforts of all
men of goodwill, there will be less
misery in the developing countries,
and that the whites of South Africa
(and elsewhere, alas!) will realize
their error and condemn the policy
of Apartheid.
N. Roudet
Clermont-Ferrand, France
INCANDESCENT 'TIDAL WAVES'
Sir,
Haroun Tazieff's article "The Men¬
ace of 'Extinct' Volcanoes" (Oct
1967) was informative and interesting
l was intrigued by the caption for a
photograph of Alaska's Valley of Ten
Thousand Smokes, which stated,
"Though such incandescent 'tidal
waves' were once common, only one
has occurred in historic times." I
should like to quote from Introduction
to Physical Geology by Chester R.
Longwell and Richard F. Flint. The
excerpts come under the heading
"nuées ardentes", and refer to the
eruption of Mt. Pelée on the island
of Martinique in 1902.
"With each burst, a great cloud of
superheated vapor and incandescent
rock material rushed forth and flowed
down the mountain slope at estimated
speeds as high as two miles per
minute. ."
"All buildings and all but two of
the 28,000 people in the town were
destroyed; one of the fortunate sur¬
vivors was a prisoner in a dungeon ."
"Ten years after the great outbreak
at Pelée, Mount Katmai, on the Alaskan
Peninsula, erupted in similar fashion
and on a much larger scale. ."
It would seem as though we have
had at least a second "tidal wave"
in historic times.
Steven M. Aronoff
Cincinnati, Ohio, U.S.A.
POSITIVE PEACEMAKING
Sir,
In such an excellent issue as "War
or Peace" (Aug.-Sept 1967), I was
disappointed not to see a reference
to the Pacifist movement which has
consistently claimed to have the an¬
swer to many of the problems dis¬
cussed.
Unesco's Constitutional Preamble,
"That since wars begin in the minds
of men, it is in the minds of men
that the defences of peace must be
constructed", indicates clearly the fu¬
tility of disarmament conferences. Paci¬
fists believe in unilateral action
positive peacemaking by refusing all
violence, irrespective of all methods
employed by the "enemy". Since all
violence, whether called defensive or
not, engenders violent reactions, paci¬
fists see no solution in so-called "po¬
lice" warfare. The doctrine of the
"Just War" is dead.
Unfortunately those who want to
survive aggression have so little faith
in the indestructibility of their beliefs
that they insist in trying to "defend"
them by force.
Pointing to the evils of nuclear war
even the immorality of sanctioning it
is not enough. We must also have
faith in non-violent defence. Only
then will wars cease.

Faster flying, fewer deaths
While scheduled air traffic increased
from 5,000 million passenger miles in 1945
to 142,000 million in 1966, the number of
people killed in aviation accidents fell from
3.53 to 0.64 for every hundred million
passenger miles. Maximum cruising speeds
increased from 170 to 600 m.p.h. In 1945
one scheduled flight crossed the Atlantic
every two hours; in 1966 there were seven
scheduled flights an hour.

matter of science."
Who has most telephones?
The U.S.A. has more telephones per
100 population (49 87) than any other
country. Runners-up in telephone density
are Sweden (47.90), New Zealand (39 87),

ed in the fishing village of Bua on the
west coast of Sweden. A grey powder,
odourless and tasteless, consisting of 83
per cent full-value protein and 13 per cent
mineral substances, the concentrate is at
present used for animal feed. However,
the factory can easily be adapted to
produce a concentrate for human con¬
sumption an important possible source of
proteins for countries with food de¬
ficiencies.
Charting poverty
"Charting poverty" a series of four
wallcharts intended primarily for use in
schools indicates the extent of poverty in
the world by showing graphically areas of
malnutrition, low life expectancy, illiteracy
and population increase. The series is
produced by Educational Productions Limit¬
ed (Wakefield, Yorkshire, U.K.) in collabo¬
ration with Christian Aid and Oxfam.
New Radar 'eye'
for the weathermen
Instruments developed by the Institute of
Marine Sciences at the University of Miami
(United States) enable weather observers
for the first time to identify and evaluate
distant electrical storms. The instruments
are used in conjunction with conventional
weather radar which, although capable of
indicating areas of rain, does not identify
active thunderstorms
