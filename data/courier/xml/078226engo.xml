In the course of the past sixten years no fewer than thirty-five independent
states have emerged in Africa (see colour map, centre fold). The
transformation of the political and economic map of Africa has been
accompanied by unprecedented changes in education, science and culture
and a new awareness of its people to the growing role that this vast
continent is destined to play in the comity of nations. This issue of the
Unesco Courier is devoted to only a few of the crucial questions
pre-occupying the leaders and thinkers of Inter-tropical Africa today.
All the articles have been written by prominent writers and authorities
from Africa itself: Gabriel d'Arboussier (Senegal), K. Onwuka Dike (Nige¬
ria), Ezekiel Mphahlele (South Africa), Pathé Diagne (Senegal), N. C. Otieno
(Kenya) and Ekpo Eyo (Nigeria). Each author has attempted to examine
his subject in the perspective of the newly-independent states of Africa
as a whole, and in the light of the new ferment of ideas and .attitudes
and the renaissance which characterize the genius of African thought
and culture today.
BIRTH OF A NEW AFRICA
by Gabriel d'Arboussier
I
4
«IGHT years ago the Unesco
Courier published a special issue on
Africa's past (Oct. 1959) which drew
aside the curtain of ignorance that
history had apparently draped around
this continent, calling it Terrae In-
cognitae just before it emerged onto
the international stage in the 1960s.
The number was a timely incursion
into the past for Africa was becoming
"fashionable" and everyone was talk¬
ing about it though not always with
the best of knowledge.
One thing that strikes me today in
comparing the 1959 issue with the
GABRIEL D'ARBOUSSIER
of Senegal is an Under-
Secretary of the United
Nations and Executive Di¬
rector of the U.N. Institute
for Training and Research.
Jurist, statesman and diplo¬
mat, he was Senegal's
Minister of Justice (1960-
1962) and helped to draw
up his country's Constitu¬
tion. In I960 he headed
Senegal's delegation to the
United Nations and while
ambassador to France (1963-
1964) was Senegal's perma¬
nent delegate to Unesco.
He is a member of the Exe¬
cutive Council of the Insti¬
tute of Studies for Econo¬
mic and Social Develop¬
ment at the University of
Paris. He is the author of
many studies, including
L'Afrique vers l'unité (To¬
wards African Unity).
present one is the difference in
authors. Those who wrote on Africa's
past were Europeans. In this number
every article is by an African.
One's first reaction on looking at the
immense platform that constitutes the
African continent is surprise at its
extreme diversity, but in my opinion
this is only a first impression. Con-
strasting with it is the other factor, the
transformations which have swept
300 million inhabitants forward in a
movement which, though it may take
different forms in different places, is
nevertheless a general one.
In his treatise on peace and war
among the nations (1), Raymond Aron
says: "...every social science problem
should be examined from three points
of view:
of the dataarrangementthe
available,
the selection of the problems
bearing on the social factor studied,
distinguishing between constant
and accidental factors.
It is from this threefold point of view
that I should like to try to present the
African continent, which a French
geographer, Jacques Weulersse, has
described as "a giant question mark
on the flank of the Old World."
The oneness of our world means that
nowadays we can no longer examine
the problems arising in one part without
first taking the facts of the international
scene into account. And there are
four international facts that concern
Africa very closely.
First in importance is the world
situation, which is such that two great
powers, the "Big Two", seem to have
an almost decisive influence on world
events.
The second is the European situation,
and this undoubtedly is the one that
concerns the whole of Africa more
particularly.
The third, which perhaps does not
yet seem to have a very definite effect
on the destiny of Africa, is China, with
its 700 million people, who in a few
years will be 1,000 million; the African
continent has only 300 million, in an
area of 30 million square kilometres.
The fourth international fact is the
appearance of the "Third World", a
fundamental factor in world evolution
today.
To these primary factors several
others must be added, which are not
simply matters of fact, for they may
perhaps be said to introduce a new
political concept into the relationships

between peoples. One is the vast
wave of decolonization that has
swept over Africa in the past few
years. Broadly speaking, the end of
the colonial system began after the
Second World War. Only a few years
ago Africa was almost entirely under
colonial rule, and now it has become a
continent of independent states in
search of their own future. This fact
entirely changes the concepts of
relationships between peoples.
Those relationships may be establish¬
ed either on the basis of the rivalries
we knew in former times, or on that of
essential co-operation between all the
existing states. The policy of hege¬
mony formerly applied to the African
continent is now being transformed
into a policy of co-operation, a new
factor of the greatest importance.
In my opinion, these are the essential
facts on the international scene that we
must keep constantly in mind when we
are considering this immense continent.
But within this general context there
are other more specifically African
factors. First, there is the great size
of Africa which, no doubt because it
is a clearly defined unit, appears
smaller on the map than the vast
spaces we see on maps showing
Europe and its prolongation towards
Asia.
Then there are the 300 million peo¬
ple, lost, one might almost say, in
Africa's 30 million square kilometres.
In company with South America, Africa
is no doubt one of the continents with
the lowest population density. Not
only has it a low density but also
a striking inequality of distribution. In
the desert regions there are 0.4 inha¬
bitants per square kilometre, whereas

A NEW AFRICA (Continued)
The need for greater inter-African co-operation
in certain areas of Nigeria for instance
there are 40, 50, 60 and even 70 inha¬
bitants per square kilometre, which is
outstanding for Africa.
In addition to this geographical
inequality, an economic and social
inequality has now arisen. The now
familiar exodus from the countryside to
the towns has led to the growth of
sprawling cities in countries with a very
low population density. Recently es¬
tablished states often have capitals of
inordinate size in relation to the coun¬
try. I think this is general in Africa,
whereas in Europe it is rather excep¬
tional.
Our African capitals have often been
compared relatively speaking, of
course to the capital of Austria, which
also has the rather special character¬
istic of being like an enormous head
on a rather small body. The combina¬
tion of these geographical and demo¬
graphic facts leads one to wonder
whether there is one Africa or several
Áfricas.
A,
6
IFRICA'S geographical zo¬
nes do in fact differ very greatly.
There is a vast difference between the
Mediterranean coast and the Guiñean
coast (Guiñean in the sense of the
Gulf of Guinea and not the country of
Guinea), and between the savanna
countries, even in a group like West
Africa that has nevertheless come to
be considered as a single entity.
There are great differences, too,
between northern Niger and south-
em Nigeria, between the Djerma and
the Somono of the Niger and the
Ibo of Nigeria, between the Malinke,
the Fan and the Ashanti. Differences
too between the Fula herdsmen and
the Sarakolle, the Battutsi of the
Congo and the forest men of the
Gabon.
So we see the outlines of very diffe¬
rent Áfricas, different in their geogra¬
phy, their peoples and their civiliza¬
tions. Differences of civilization exist
between the men of the Sahara and
the men of the Sahel, bordering the
desert, between those of the savanna
and those of the forest. Yet we should
not let these differences, real though
they are, prevent us from perceiving the
great unity, or rather several major
unifying factors, that exist in this vast
continent.
First let us come back to the eco¬
nomic and social factors and look at
the important unity Africa possesses
because it is a developing continent.
Obviously this is not a quality that
should be stressed as an argument,
but we are looking for points of unity,
factors of unification in this huge and
diverse continent with its extraordi¬
narily varied countryside and its great
variety of peoples.
There is a second factor. Africa is
a developing continent that was under
colonial rule for a very long time and
its communities have only quite
recently acceded to a modern way of
life and statehood. Apart from Ethio¬
pia, one of the oldest states in the
world, and a few embryonic kingdoms
that were able to subsist in the nor¬
thern part of Africa, almost all the
present sovereign powers are new
ones, and almost all the states are
"apprentice states". That is a factor
permitting some generalization in talk¬
ing of the African continent.
There is one last point which seems
to me extremely important. Africa,
which except on the outer fringes
had little contact with the outside
world, had developed internal civiliza¬
tions based on a community way of
life that is the most outstanding feature
of the social structure of these coun¬
tries as a whole. So we find that civi¬
lizations which appear very far remov¬
ed from one another because of diffe¬
rences in their geography, climate or
historical past, are very near to each
other as regards the community way
of life adopted by their peoples.
Indeed, when we speak to a farmer
from Senegal, or from Ubang-Shari, or
Chad or the Congo (Kinshasa) and see
how he lives, how the various age
groups in his country are organized,
how the land is divided or the income
from collective production distributed
among the different members of the
group, we find everywhere the same
community basis, which, incidentally,
is reflected in the cultural life that is
itself one of the great unifying factors
in this continent.
The cultural aspect is perhaps one
of the most important that we should
consider. Alongside the considerable
variety of agrarian civilizations and
social structures, there has emerged
a concept of life and of the future
of man and his relationship to cosmic
forces, that is one of the essential
characteristics of the cultural outlook
of the African, in spite of the strik¬
ing differences in colour of skin bet¬
ween the Berber, the Moor, the Fula or
the Sara and the Malinke.
They all hold to the same con¬
cepts as their ancestors. This provides
an extremely important background,
expressed in religions terms by the
animism that is to be found every¬
where, at any rate below the line of
the Sahara. Where neither the Islamic
nor the Christian religion has yet
penetrated, we find a set of religious
beliefs that are all related to, all
branches of, this animist conception.
Broadly, these are the few basic fac¬
tors that give us a more exact view of
the African continent; a continent in
which the immense variety of ways of
life and the extraordinarily different
concepts of social organization that
characterize it do not preclude the
existence of a few fundamental factors
binding all together in a common
destiny.
'ITH this view of Africa in
our minds, how are we to make a
selection from among the problems
the task which now faces both the
leaders and the peoples themselves
in African countries? I think we must
classify the problems as political, eco¬
nomic, social and cultural. This is in
line with the dominant ideas now com¬
ing to the fore in these young states.
The first great objective for each of
them is to build up national cohesion.
Most of these states have been
formed on territories that were not
national territories and had not consti¬
tuted nations. That is perhaps the
greatest difference between Africa and
Europe. In Europe the State some¬
times emerged from the cohesion that
a group of peoples had already been
able to achieve among themselves and
had then wished to express, first in
their relations with the outside world,
by constituting themselves as states;
in Africa the situation is exactly the
reverse.
Africa has states that have been
constituted without any national basis
and states that are trying to achieve
national cohesion at the very time
when, throughout the world, national
sovereignty is confronted with the
movement towards the constitution of
large economic groupings, made
necessary by the new international
division of labour, the expansion of
markets, and all the new functions that
economics obliges the State to per¬
form.
The second consideration is that
these states, wishing to achieve nation¬
hood, are faced with the fact of the
absolute necessity of inter-African
co-operation, for they have very
quickly realized that modern economic
laws and the requirements of economic

development make it impossible for
them to attain their objectives within
the narrow framework of their own
states, and that they must therefore
agree among themselves and set their
course towards inter-African co-opera¬
tion.
The third consideration is that nowa¬
days everyone, the world over, is
talking of economic development. This
idea seems to be new but is perhaps
in fact not so very new. Economic
growth has often been confused with
economic development. I think that
when, for some etymological reason,
people try to classify countries into
developed and developing, they should
recognize that all countries, whatever
their level of development, are
constantly developing; each is always
trying to do better.
The largest states, the largest eco¬
nomic groups are formed nowadays
precisely because of this desire to
achieve a still greater degree of

economic development. But Africa
entered modern life at the very time
when this problem and this notion of
economic development were elevated
to the rank of theories. The notion
of economic development was imme¬
diately taken over by all these states
and made the leitmotif of all their
claims.
After the claim for independence
has come the claim for economic
development; having claimed the right
to speak on equal terms with others,
states are now claiming the right to
live like others, to have the same
means of social, economic and cultural
development, and economic develop¬
ment is obviously one of the most
important problems affecting these
countries today.
Economic development brings all
these states face to face with the
necessity of international co-operation.
For today it is absolutely essential for
them to have understandings with each
other, to regroup themselves, to have
inter-African co-operation. They have
understood that they cannot develop
if they do not have relations with
the outside world.
After an initial tendency to turn
inwards, after showing a certain desire
to break away from all its past foreign
relations, Africa is now perhaps being
swept forward by a new movement.
But there is a danger of abandoning
the concern that is expressed in the
old proverb: "God helps those who
help themselves". It may well be true
that Africa's development depends on
international relations, but it will de¬
pend above all upon the work of her
citizens and on the "will to economize"
as Arthur Lewis has termed one of the
essentials of economic development.
Work is the basis of development in
any country. The world's highly de¬
veloped countries reached their pre¬
sent state only after years and cen¬
turies of suffering, patience and hard
work.
At the political level the problem
facing the African states today is
that of independence and the need
for international co-operation. They
first need to understand that the best
way of assuring their independence
is not to isolate themselves. Inde¬
pendence is not only the independence
of a few leaders, a few families or
a few social classes, but of the whole
population. Today this independence
is exercised in an atmosphere of world
interdependence.
As regards internal organization
and here we have another common
factor It is noteworthy that African
countries have been entirely free from
the conflicts that occurred in Europe
in former times between the written
and the unwritten law, between the
written constitution and the absence
of any constitution. Today there
seems to be a general movement
leading all the African states first
towards the achievement of a written
constitution designed to establish
authority.
Why this concern with a written
constitution and why such a reaction
against custom? In Europe the law,
by its form, seemed to be the force
that operated most strongly against

the imperative social evolution that
was taking place, whereas custom,
seemed more fully to meet the need
for evolution. The disadvantage, it
may be said, is that the desire to
evolve is so great that the constitution
is changed rather too often. This is,
admittedly, a fairly serious danger
lurking on our path, but I think we
should not exaggerate its importance.
Another problem is foreign policy.
Immediately after attaining indepen¬
dence, African countries were tempted
by neutrality and neutralism to the
point where a series of different terms
was invented, ranging from negative
neutralism to positive neutralism. This
was simply an expression of the desire
to avoid being tied to one bloc or
another.
Today that attitude is being some¬
what reversed. Neutralism is gradually
losing ground. Africa is realizing that
her fate is bound up with that of every

part of the world, that there cannot
be an isolated African island. In its
foreign relations, instead of being a
stake in the rivalries between the
Great Powers, Africa would like to
be a place where the international
co-operation that has become neces¬
sary in the world of today is practised,
Concerning economic, social and
cultural factors, I should like to
point out that Africa is in the process
of making an- inventory of her own
economic resources. She is trying
to find out whether, by her own means,
she can bring her traditional economy
up to the point of "take-off", so as to
embark on a modern economic system
or whether she needs fairly substantial
assistance from abroad to reach this
stage.
Africa realizes that both these things
are necessary. Intensive work must
be done by the Africans themselves,
and above all some thinking is called
for on the subject of Africa's economy,
so as to free her economic develop¬
ment from complete dependence upon
foreign trends and foreign trade, as
has been the case so far.
a|NE of the characteristics
of Africa is that the visible and calcu¬
lable part of its national income is
largely made up of receipts from
exports abroad. A consequence of
this state of affairs, which is extremely
dangerous for Africa, is that the major
part of Africa's work has been devoted
to the production of goods destined
for sale abroad. The share of food
production necessary for subsistence
has been sacrificed, with the para¬
doxical result that a continent that
could be almost self-supporting, today
depends for almost 80 per cent of its
subsistence on imports from abroad.
We need only recall that Senegal,
which could produce rice and millet
for its subsistence (and formerly did
so) now imports huge amounts of
rice from Burma, Siam, Cambodia and
South Viet-Nam each month, and at
the same time is compelled to sell
its groundnut oil abroad because its
population consumes only a very small
part of what is produced! A reversal
of that trend would help to constitute
internal economies and internal mar¬
kets that would provide backing for
Africa's foreign trade.
In my opinion, this building up of
internal markets is the best means
of attracting capital investments. Of
course, political declarations and legal
guarantees for capital investments can
be given, but the best safeguard for

since the keepers of these traditions

L ast month the Unesco Courier reported on the Scientific
and Cultural History of Mankind now in course of publication in various
languages under Unesco's auspices. Another international publishing
project of unprecedented scope and importance will be the General
History of Africa. Unesco's General Conference approved the idea in
1964 and the preliminary stage was completed last year with the appoint¬
ment of Professor K. Onwuka Dike, former Vice-Chancellor of the
University of Ibadan, Nigeria, to be Scientific Director of the project.
The preparation and publication of the History of Africa is scheduled
to take ten years (1965-1975), for which Unesco will contribute $500,000.
Work will be undertaken in collaboration with the International Congress
of Africanists (an organization created in 1962 with Unesco help) and
many other international and national scientific and historical institutes
of African studies.
The General History of Africa will comprise several volumes and will
represent the most comprehensive work on Africa's past ever attempted.
An abridged edition designed for a wider readership is also planned.
This unique venture will mobilize the combined research of historians,
archaeologists, linguists, ethnologists and other scholars from Africa and
other continents.
The History of Africa will be not only an account of events and political
institutions, but- also of countless other aspects of Africa's past : the
spread of techniques, the migrations of populations, the influence of
caravan routes and trade, and the various other cultural, commercial and
social interrelations between North Africa and Tropical Africa.
The emergence of independent African states has awakened every¬
where in the world (including Africa itself) a need to know and under¬
stand the peoples of Africa and their contributions to universal culture.
The General History of Africa, it is hoped, will help to fill an important
gap in. our knowledge of this great continent and thereby foster better
international understanding between the peoples of all countries. Here,
Professor Dike reviews ' recent developments in thé' study of African
history.
THE SCIENTIFIC STUDY
OF AFRICA'S HISTORY
by K. Onwuka Dike
T is something of an irony
that, although written sources on the
history of many parts of the African
continent antedated- the Christian era,
African History as an academic disci¬
pline, is largely a post World War II
development.
This statement is particularly true of
Africa South of the Sahara. Written
sources abound on Mediterranean
Africa from the days of the Carthagi¬
nians, the Romans and the Byzantines,
on Ethiopia since the introduction there
of Christianity in the fourth century
A.D., on Africa north of the tropical
forest since the eleventh century, on
the coast of West Africa since the
fifteenth century and on the larger part
of the continent since the beginning of
the nineteenth century, through the
accounts and journals of geographers,
explorers, missionaries and colonial
administrators.
This is not to say that scholars paid
no attention at all to Africa before the
Second World War. Academic inte¬
rest in Egyptian and North African civi¬
lization is of long standing, but North
African history was looked at mainly
as part of Asian history and its impor¬
tant links with Africa South of the
Sahara were hardly ever studied and
assessed.
Indeed, individuals and organizations
had scholarly insight into the languages
and ethnography of the southern por
tion of the continent. But none of
these organizations was primarily con¬
cerned with African history, which
until recently, remained beyond the
intellectual horizons of the universities.
Nor were the considerable writings of
administrators and social anthropolo¬
gists between the Wars generally
prompted by the necessity for the
administration to understand the Afri¬
can way of life and to investigate the
root-causes of African discontent and
riots, geared to African history.
Although in the last century Russian
explorers like Eduard Ivanovich Eykh-
val'd and A. V. Yeliseyew contributed
to our geographical knowledge of
Africa north of the Sahara, it was not

attention in the Soviet Union. As late
as 1956 none of the one thousand
eight hundred and seventy-seven his¬
torical associations and agencies in
the United States and Canada was
remotely concerned with the study of
any part or aspect of Africa.
In Britain a few years ago, the autho¬
rities of the University of London were
very sceptical when a degree course
in African History was first mooted and
waited until 1963 before establishing a
Chair of African History. Perhaps in
the academic world today, Professor
Trevor Roper of Oxford University is
not alone in his view that African His¬
tory is no more than "the unrewarding
gyrations of barbarous tribes in
picturesque but irrelevant corners of
the globe."
I
10
HE great majority of the
three hundred million inhabitants of
this continent are descendants of those
who have lived on it for several thous¬
and years. The story of these peoples
and the vast land they inhabit repres¬
ents a very considerable part of the
history of human society. The actions
of Africans have not only shaped the
pattern of human history on this con¬
tinent, but have also played their part
in the development of the civilizations
of the New World, Europe and Asia.
The real scientific study of history in
the modern sense of that term may be
said to have started in Africa with the
work of the famous Tunisian historian
of the fourteenth century, Ibn Khaldun.
He emphasized the great importance of
sociology to history, describing the
past largely by observing the interac¬
tion of state and society and by ana¬
lyzing the development of the various
elements of society.
Unfortunately, his work has, until
recently, had too little influence on the
study of history, for the medieval world
was little concerned with history, pre¬
ferring theology, law and rhetoric. It
is true that since the eighteenth cen¬
tury Europe has paid a great deal of
attention to the study of history. But
because of the abundance of written
documentary evidence, her scholars
adopted, not the sociological method of
Ibn Khaldun, but the legal and the bio¬
graphical, concerning themselves main¬
ly with the decrees, wars and politics
of kings.
When, in the nineteenth century, this
approach began to be broadened to
take account once again of social and
economic factors, documentary evi
dence had become so overwhelmingly
important for the European scholar
that he tended to equate written docu¬
ments with history. He began to take
the absence of documents to mean the
absence of history, the absence of any
events worthy of historical study.
Under the colonial regimes, this view
of history flourished in Africa. It bols¬
tered up the colonial ruler's propa¬
ganda that the African had no history
worthy of record and that the history
of the European rulers constituted the
sum total of African history.
Needless to say that this view of
history greatly hindered the develop¬
ment of African historiography, for
undoubtedly, there is a dearth of docu¬
mentary material on African history.
And as long as African historians were
brought up in the traditions which
regarded documentary evidence as the
sole material for historical analysis,
they were working in a difficult cir¬
cumscribed position. Either they pro¬
duced only what may be called chro¬
nicles or they got carried away by
flights of fancy and wrote polemics in
place of history.
Fortunately, the writing of African
history has made some progress in the
last few years. The identification of
history with the abundance of records
has been proved false. There is now
no need to belabour that Africa has a
history worthy of study at all levels
of intellectual discipline.
More than that, it is now generally
accepted that the history of Africa must
be the history of the African peoples
themselves that their actions, not the
actions of the invaders, must be the
focus of African history. Each new
work, each new edition of older works,
shows increasing consciousness of this
point of view.
I«VEN now that we have
become more conscious of the proper
subject matter of African history, we
are still faced with the problem of the
material at our 'disposal. The written
material gathered so far on African
history is not only scanty, it also
consists largely of evidence by outsi¬
ders either in the European languages
or Arabic. The bulk of it exists in
the metropolitan archives of colonial
powers, and the material tells us much
more about the actions and intentions
of the invaders than of the action and
intentions of the Africans themselves.
Because this external evidence is
still the principal source, the proper
writing of African history continues to
be inhibited. In spite of the increas-
Photo t? Paul Almasy, Paris
ing desire of many historians to des¬
cribe properly the role of Africans, the
actions of the invaders still remain
disproportionately large in African his¬
tory. Outmoded and untenable myths
continue to dominate the interpretations
of the African past. I need to give
only two examples of these myths.
First, there is the Hamitic hypothe¬
sis, the disreputable theory that Ne¬
groes have made no contribution to
human progress, that "the civilizations
of Africa are the civilizations of the
Hamites." This theory, based largely
on the scanty Arabic sources and a
dubious interpretation of some legends
of origin in Africa, continues to be can¬
vassed in spite of the criticism of scho¬
lars like Greenberg, in spite of the
clear evidence of Negro contributions
to civilization, including some of the
best known plastic arts in the history
of the world.
Secondly, there is the attempt at a
pseudo-economic interpretation of Afri¬
can history, which sees all social and
political movements in Africa from the
sixteenth to the nineteenth century as
motivated solely by the slave trade. It
is, if you like, another Hamitic theory,
that nothing went on inside Africa in
those centuries that was not connected
with European trade along the coast.

ANCIENT CIVILIZATION
There is evidence that a
protohistorical Ethiopian civ¬
ilization existed several
thousand years before the
Christian Era, though it left
no monuments. About 2,000
years ago travellers from
Egypt who penetrated to the
Abyssinian highlands found
a flourishing civilization and
large cities. One of Ethio¬
pia's best preserved monu¬
ments is the giant obelisk
at Aksum. Standing 24 me¬
tres (nearly 80 ft.) high, it
dominates the tombs of the
kings of Ethiopia's Axumite
Kingdom founded over 2,000
years ago. Ethiopia's an¬
cient legends are still told
graphically in brightly col¬
oured paintings. Among the
best known is the story of
Solomon and the Queen of
Sheba and the birth of Me-
nelik, first Emperor of Ethio¬
pia, whom Ethiopians believe
was the son of Solomon
and the Queen. Painting,
left, depicts the court of
Emperor Menelik.

To get behind those myths, to tackle
seriously the writing of African history
despite the scantiness and the nature
of the written sources, is the problem of
African historiography today.
My first suggestion is that we must
accumulate at different centres in
Africa the bulk of the existing docu¬
mentary evidence on African history.
In the past, the study of African history
has been held up by the quite remark¬
able dispersal all over the world of
the relevant source material. This
material includes important African
works taken out of the continent by
colonial rulers and other visitors.
The centralization of this material,
in Africa, will relieve scholars of the
enormous trouble and expense involv¬
ed in so many unnecessary journeys
from one end of the world to the other,
in quest of material for the study of
our own land. Fortunately, we now
live in the age of the microfilm and
the zerox process, and what I am sug¬
gesting is therefore practicable.
But of course the accumulation of
source material does not merely mean
the recovery of documents at present
preserved overseas. It means also,
and most important, the recovery and
organization of material at present lying
disregarded and disorganized in Africa.
This is a task of almost frightening
immensity. On the side of written
documentary material alone we are
only just beginning to appreciate the
size of the problem.
0.|NLY now is it being realiz¬
ed, for example, that colonial governm¬
ent, missionary and commercial records
in European languages are not the only
written sources for the history of the
continent outside the North African
coastlands. We have hardly yet be¬
gun to take into account the fact that
many of the peoples of Subsaharan
Africa have for several centuries been
using Arabic as an official and literary
language for many different types of
written intercourse.
We have really only just learned
also that the Swahili and Hausa lan¬
guages (to name only two) have been
written down extensively in the Arabic
script, and may therefore, for all we
know at present, have produced a fur¬
ther unsuspected source of written
material.
Again how many of us also realize
how far private African citizens such
as the Efik Chief, Antera Duke, were
using European languages for writing
in their private intercourse as far back
as the eighteenth century? The private
papers of African families are a poten¬
tial source of historical material which
to date has hardly been investigated
at all.
But private papers tend to be kept
by their owners under even worse con¬
ditions than one finds in government
offices, and their long-term preserva¬
tion will undoubtedly depend on their
deposit in proper archive repositories.
Private owners of documents must
therefore be persuaded to allow gov¬
ernmental or learned institutions to
preserve their papers for them.
There is, again, I am sure, an overall
lack of attention to the question of Ara¬
bic archives, both public and private.
We are recovering material dating from
the seventeenth century onwards in
Northern Nigeria; but it is noteworthy
that we are also recovering important
private material in areas not usually
associated with Arabic documentation
such as southern Yorubaland.
At the same time we are conscious
that we are only just beginning to
exploit this field which holds out great
promise for the future. I strongly sus¬
pect that all over West Africa it will
be found that Arabic material exists in
private hands on a scale hitherto quite
unknown. Collection of written mate¬
rial in such languages as Kanuri,

AFRICA'S HISTORY (Continued)
70 centres now exploring Africa's past
Hausa, Nupe, Fulani and so on, which
have long used the Arabic script, has
also to be attended to.
Yet the accumulation of written mate¬
rial is only a small part of the task
which faces us, and it is perhaps the
easiest to encompass if sufficient
effort is made. There are many diffe¬
rent types of unwritten sources which
we have to study before we can hope
to come near to an understanding of
the African past. More and more
attention is being paid to the value of
oral traditions and social anthropolo¬
gical studies of African countries. But
the importance of this material to the
historian is vitiated by a lack of proper
analysis.
There is need for a more systematic
approach to the question of oral tra¬
dition. The anthropologists who pio¬
neered this field of research are not
themselves agreed on the proper inter¬
pretation of oral history. What is more
they have worked too much in isolation
from the written records and from the
historians who have the information
and the analytical training to make
substantial contributions in this field.
The same, of course, is true of the
historians. Both in our training and in
our research we have not always made
enough use of the work of the social
anthropologists.
RE
12
».ESEARCH into the African
past has made tremendous strides in
the last twenty years and in the learn¬
ed circles African History has come
into its own. For Africans historical
research into their past was neces¬
sarily a concomitant of the political
emancipation of a substantial portion
of the continent.
African scholars are bringing to bear
upon their investigation the vital back¬
ground knowledge of their culture, their
language and their institutions, they
are in a position that enables them to
fathom the documents beyond depths
attained by non-African eyes, selecting
those portions relevant to Africa and
its peoples rather than concentrating
on materials bearing only on European
activities in Africa.
European and American scholars
have lost no time in the quarrying
and processing of the mines of infor¬
mation unveiled by archives in many
parts of the world. By 1964 there
had been founded sixty Centres and
Institutes of African Studies in fourteen
European countries and the United
States. In the Soviet Union African
Studies had been ably inspired by
Professor D. A. Olderogge, an out
standing philologist whose works
include The Peoples of Africa (1954),
The Hausa Language (1954) and Wes¬
tern Sudan in the 15th - 19 th Centuries
(1960).
In December 1959 an African Insti¬
tute was organized within the Depart¬
ment of Historical Science in the Soviet
Academy of Sciences. Between 1959
and 1961 alone, no less than four
hundred and thirty-three Soviet publi¬
cations on Africa appeared. Thanks to
the late Professor Potekhin, first Direc¬
tor of the Africa Institute, interest in
African Studies increased in the Soviet
Union.
In the United States, where African
History was not catered for in the
American Historical Review until 1963,
the African Studies Association was
formed in 1957. At first dominated by
linguists, ethnologists and social an¬
thropologists, it has begun to inspire
historical scholarship. In 1964 there
were no less than twenty-five Centres
of African Studies in the U.S.A. Amer¬
ican Africanists have achieved much,
particularly in Linguistics and Political
Science.
In Britain the School of Oriental
and African Studies, University of
London, blazed the trail. This institu¬
tion has accomplished a great deal in
Linguistics and the history of Bantu
Africa, under the leadership of Pro¬
fessor Ronald Oliver. A specialist
approach was lately adopted in the
University of Birmingham where the
Centre of West African Studies con¬
centrates on West Africa, under the
direction of Professor John Fage.
In Africa, naturally, African and non-
African historians in the universities
are giving pride of place to African
History more than anywhere else out¬
side the continent. Learned journals
devoted to local historical studies have
multiplied and publications stepped up.
There are now at least sixty-six
centres, all of which have the aim of
studying some aspect of African
society, history, law and culture.
Scholars engaged in the task of redis¬
covering the African past know that
African History has passed the stage
of experiment, indeed in some regions
of Africa the field is ripe unto harvest;
the information unearthed is already
enormous and the possibilities for
further investigations are almost infi¬
nite.
It must be admitted, however, that
there are still important gaps in our
knowledge of African peoples and that
in some regions, particularly in East
and Central Africa a lot of work re¬
mains to be done before a definitive
history of these areas can be com¬
prehensively written. What is needed
is not only the writing up of the
history of those areas where research
has progressed, but also the launching
of planned research in regions where
our knowledge is scanty. The two
must go hand in hand. The future
Unesco General History of Africa
intends to lay emphasis on both
aspects.
¡T is gratifying to note that
some of the problems raised have
been surveyed by the International
African Institute, which summoned a
Conference of Africanists at Ibadan
University in April 1964 to discuss
some of these problems, and by the
First International Congress of Africa¬
nists which met in Accra, Ghana, in
1962. The tasks before us are great,
but not insurmountable; their solution
will entail considerable financial outlay,
time and the close co-operation of
scholars of all disciplines.
If organized along the right lines the
planned Unesco General History of
Africa will serve to bring together
scholars of all the disciplines relevant
to the study of the African past. To
achieve this objective it is imperative
that a body of scholars should be set
up, designed to channel the energies
of the historians of Africa in tackling
urgent problems of African historio¬
graphy and in correcting erroneous
assumptions about that past.
Take for instance, the general ten¬
dency of historians to isolate Africa
north of the Sahara in a manner quite
unhistorical. Indeed, rather than being
a barrier the Sahara has from time
immemorial been a bridge linking the
north to the south. Although Medi¬
terranean Africa has had contact with
Mediterranean Europe and the Middle
East for a very long time there has
been cultural cross-fertilization, as
well as economic and political con¬
nexions between Africa north and
south of the Sahara. Both areas share
some common problems, their distinc¬
tiveness in many respects notwith¬
standing. Any scheme for the writing
of African history should be within
the framework of the entire continent.
This is not to say that a regional
approach to African history is unde¬
sirable or should be abandoned. In
fact the most practical and most fruit¬
ful way of achieving maximum results
is to consider the problems of African
historiography in their regional con¬
text. But whilst these units are to be
treated fully in their own right, they

should be conceived as units within
the organic whole of the African con¬
tinent. I suggest the division of Africa
into the following regions: North Africa
including the Nile Valley, Ethiopia, The
Sudanic Belt, West Africa, Central and
East Africa and South Africa. African¬
ists within these regions would be
able to compare notes on matters of
common interest.
Perhaps the most important meth¬
odological problem posed by African
historiography is the inevitability of a
multi-disciplinary approach, particularly
for the pre-colonial period in which
written documents do not exist for
the greater part of the continent. The
historian of Africa cannot afford to
work in isolation; he needs the aid of
several other disciplines related to
his subject. He should take seriously
oral tradition and work hand in hand
with linguists, archaelogists, social and
physical anthropologists, orologists,
and artists. And yet although the
historian of Africa is fully aware of
the vital value of other disciplines he
still tends to ignore them. Until re¬
cently, it must be admitted that Afri¬
canists have tended to work along
independent lines.
Up to now, then, no historical work
on a massive scale has been attempt¬
ed on a multi-disciplinary basis. One of
course is aware of efforts in the
Soviet Union to adopt this strategy,
and of the Benin and Yoruba Research
schemes in Nigeria. A carefully plan¬
ned programme of the continental his¬
tory of Africa on interdisciplinary lines
is the need of the hour.
Much credit is due to the well-
seasoned and understanding Africa¬
nists of the United States, Europe and
the Soviet Union. But is has to be
emphasized that the problems posed
by African history are largely African,
and therefore demand an African so¬
lution. The themes and emphasis of
the researches of African historians
show clearly that it is mainly from
within Africa that the mainspring for
the study of Africa can come.
This is as it should be. Africans
have a special responsibility which out¬
siders cannot discharge. They are
psychologically and emotionally more
drawn than foreigners towards their
continent and heritage. In the under¬
standing of documents on African cul¬
ture and institutions, in historical appre¬
ciation and use of oral tradition, in
analysis of human drama in African
society, African scholars have an
advantage over others and are more
likely to get at the root of the problem
than non-Africans.
It is not implied that non-Africans
have no major part to play in the
rediscovery of Africa's past. Their re¬
sourcefulness and skill are required
in the disciplines of Archaelogy, Lin¬
guistics and Art, in which they are pre¬
eminently qualified, for the elucidation,
illumination and enrichment of our
knowledge of African society and
human drama in Africa over' the last
three thousand years.

AFRICAN ARCHITECTURE
OLD AND NEW
Town planning and architecture are two
fields in which the transformation ofAfri¬
can ways of life is now being unmistakably
revealed. Many countries a/ready have the
services of young African architect-plan¬
ners whose work associates the most
modern building techniques with work¬
ing methods, resources and social needs
of their regions. Until now home building
in Africa was a " family affair " and pro¬
duced a building which corresponded to
the crafts and skills, needs and tastes of
those who would occupy it. Village homes,
in fact, are often models of architectural
and aesthetic excellence. Today, as new
forms of society develop, Africa's archi¬
tects are called upon to evolve a style
and an approach to housing and urban
development that not only reflects tra¬
dition but has a functional modern utility.

He was formerly director of the
Department of Archaeology, Jos

Dakar Symposium organized under

the first World Festival of Negro

_JHY should we preserve
our African works of art and craft?
Why should we not spend whatever
money we have on improving our liv¬
ing standards rather than on the pres¬
ervation of works of art and craft
which after all do not bring us any
material benefit?
The answer is that the need for the
preservation and study of works of
art and craft cannot be over-empha¬
sized in countries where written hist¬
orical records are rare and recent. It
is precisely because these things had
not been done that the African has
often been regarded as a man without
a past, and as one still living in pri¬
mitive savagery.
In Western countries, protective
measures ' have long been taken for
the preservation of works of art. In
many countries national bodies have
been created for this purpose and
public museums opened whose func¬
tions include the collection and pres¬
ervation of the cultural heritage. The
British Museum, for instance, was
opened to the public as early as 1795.
In Africa certain unavoidable cir¬
cumstances militate against the natural
preservation of works of art and craft.
About 80 per cent of African works of
art and craft are wood which does
not survive thé ravages of fire, fungus,
termites, weather and worms. The
oldest wood carvings are probably the
ancestor (Ekpu) figures from Oron in
Eastern Nigeria and yet they are said
to be only 150 to 200 years old.
William Fagg, the British ethnologist,
attributes the continuity of African
art to the high rate at which termites
eat up carvings as soon as they are
made, so creating the need to pro¬
duce new ones. But perhaps that is
not the only reason, for continuity
originates in families of carvers who
train the younger generations as they
come along. Yet it is true that a
countless number of good works of
arts and crafts which we may never
know anything about have already
perished in this way.
The most ancient and best preserv¬
ed of African works of art are those
that were made in metal, but even here
cases are known where old brass

THE PROTECTION OF AFRICA'S
ARTISTIC HERITAGE
by Ekpo Eyo
works have been melted down and
recast.
In some cases where the owners
of these works have tried to take
care of them and save them from
destruction, they have been ignorant
of the scientific means of doing so.
The people of Tada for instance have
badly damaged their famous bronzes
by frequently scrubbing them with
sand.
But this is not the greatest danger
to the preservation of works of art and
craft. Such danger comes from the
disintegration of the old social struc¬
ture which was based on indigenous
religion and a subsistence economy.
Africans are extremely religious
people whose lives are marked ,at
every point with rituals and ceremo¬
nies. Whether they live in highly
organized kingdoms or in simple com¬
munities, individuals, families, lineages,
villages and kingdoms have their own
gods whom they consult in time of
crisis. These gods which are inter¬
mediaries between them and the High
God are usually sculptured in wood.
In this way, millions of pieces of
sculpture were produced..
But new converts often demonstrate
their faith in the new religions by
destroying those objects which were
associated with their old faith.
In 1951, in the Western Region of
Nigeria, a spiritualist movement known
as Atinga crossed over from Dahomey
and persuaded the chiefs and elders
of the neighbouring Yoruba villages in
the Egbado Division of Abeokuta Pro¬
vince to allow them to "clean up"
their villages.
The Atinga priests claimed that they
had the power to detect witchcraft
and those who practise bad medicine.
In this exercise, thousands of carvings,
calabashes, metal objects and carved
ivory, which were associated with
various indigenous Yoruba religions
were brought out and set on fire.
Only part of them was saved, thanks
to the British District Officer who
happened to be there and sent word
to the Department of Antiquities which
was able to rescue certain important
pieces. Today the Atinga collection
forms the largest single collection of
works of art in the Nigerian museums.
If Africans have done little to pre¬
serve their works of art and handicraft,
the awareness in Europe and America
of the beauty of African art has drain¬
ed the African Continent of most of
what is left over from the ravages of
white ants and other factors. From
the time of the Punitive Expedition
to Benin in 1897 and the visit of Leo
Frobenius, Europeans and Americans
have not ceased to collect any African
works of art that have come their way.
It is of course not desirable that
a nation should keep to herself all her
works of art. Some of them should
also be seen in other countries, not
only for the enjoyment of the people
in those countries but .'also to -make
possible- the ' understanding- of the cul¬
ture which inspired such works and'
to. confer prestige on their country
of origin. But such transfers ought
to be carried out legally, which is not
always the case.
TeHE first thing that we must
do, and some African states are already
doing it, is to collect and preserve in
museums, works of art and craft which
are exposed to the dangers 1 have
just outlined. And a museum is not
only a place in which these objects
will be safe, but also where they will
be studied.
The preservation of works of arts
and craft from countries undergoing
rapid development has been discussed
at three international conferences
during recent years. At Neuchâtel
in Switzerland in 1961, a meeting of
museum experts from many parts of
the world was held with Unesco's
assistance to discuss the problems
of museums and the conservation of
museum objects from these coun¬
tries.
The experts noted "the accession
to independence of many countries
has brought about increased aware¬
ness of the importance of the national
heritage and the need for preserving
it and turning it to account ... At the
same time the developing countries
have seen the rapid disappearance of
their cultural property to the benefit of
foreign museums and even more to
that of the antique market . . . More
often than not these countries do not
as yet possess legislation adapted to
the circumstances, or the scientific
personnel required for cataloguing,
collecting and preserving the cultural
property they want to prevent from
being exported."
The experts also noted that the
large scale construction works in the
developing countries resulting from
rapid economic and industrial expan¬
sion, entail the destruction of cultural
and particularly archaelogical sites of
national importance and the suppres¬
sion of traditional cultures over wide
areas, such as at. the Kariba, Volta
and Niger Dam. areas.
They therefore recommended -that
each country should establish a na--
tional service which should draw up
a list of objects of special value that
warranted preservation, and should try
to improve the legal standing of such
objects which would ensure their phy¬
sical conservation and prohibit their
export, although the prohibition of
export should not preclude the lawful
circulation of these objects.
In August, 1964, Nigeria played host
to a seminar on "The Role of Museums
in Contemporary Africa", which was
jointly sponsored by Unesco and
Nigeria. The late Dr. Paul Coremans,
the noted Belgian authority, in his
paper on the physical and chem¬
ical conservation of museum objects
in the tropics pointed out that various
types of climate in Africa have a rapid
and damaging effect, and that the
ancient objects kept in Africa, which
are mainly organic, are very sensitive
to climatic factors. He therefore sug¬
gested that each country should create
a national service for the preserva¬
tion of its cultural heritage, including
monuments, sites and museum
objects.
He also suggested that within this
national organization, a technical sec¬
tion should be set up, comprising 1 "7
primarily a "cultural laboratory" and I 1
one or more conservation workshops
attached to this laboratory.

AFRICA'S ARTISTIC HERITAGE (Continued)
The emergence of new forms of art
18
Finally, the Unesco General Con¬
ference which met in Paris in 1964,
noting that "cultural property consti¬
tutes a basic element of civilization and
national culture", stressed the fact
that every state should protect cultural
property within its territory against
illicit export, import and transfer of
ownership.
It recommended the adoption of
appropriate measures to improve
international co-operation in tackling
this problem. Member states were
advised to take steps to see that
no import of cultural property is
authorized until such property has
been cleared from any restrictions in
the exporting state. Museums were
asked not to purchase works obtained
through illicit export or transfer of
ownership.
Among the measures recommended
by the Unesco Conference were:
That each state should set up a
national service for the protection of
cultural property.
That each state should set up a
fund or provide other means for the
repurchase of important works of art.
Member states were called on to
collaborate in facilitating the return of
cultural objects which had been
illicitly exported.
Here are some of the steps we in
Nigeria have taken in the preservation
of our works of arts and crafts.
In Nigeria, a law exists to check, and
if need be to prevent, thé export of
antiquities. One of the definitions of
an "antiquity" is "any work of art or
craftwork, including any statue, model¬
led clay figure, figure cast or wrought
in metal, carving, housepost, door,
ancestral figure, religious mask, staff,
drum, bowl, ornament, utensil, wea¬
pon, armour, regalia, manuscripts or
document, if such work of art craft-
work is of indigenous origin and:
was made or fashioned before
the year 1918; and
is of historical, artistic of scien¬
tific interest, and is or has been used
at any time in the performance and
for the purposes of any traditional
African ceremony."
This definition which may soon be
modified, is embodied in the Antiqui¬
ties Act of 1953.
Those who intend to export an anti¬
quity must apply in the first place to
the Director of Antiquities. If the object
is found to be an antiquity but not
very important, the Director of Anti¬
quities is authorized to issue a permit
for its export. All antiquities are
photographed and listed so as to
provide an accurate record of what
works have left the country.
For more important antiquities, the
Antiquities Commission or its sub¬
committee must see and determine by
agreement whether or not to allow
export. A would-be exporter is
required to submit his objects at least
three months before the date on which
the antiquities should leave the coun¬
try. In the case of an object for which
a permit is withheld, the Department
of Antiquities then offers to purchase
it at a reasonable valuation. If this
offer is refused the owner may be
asked to declare what his intentions
are concerning its subsequent custody.
The Department is also engaged in
a campaign of acquisition of antiquities
by purchases, loans and excavations.
In addition, an intelligence system has
been built up to deal with attempts
organised overseas to export antiqui¬
ties through local agents.
A,ILTHOUGH most African
sculptured objects are religious in
content, a good percentage of them
are household, farming and fishing
equipment based on a subsistence eco¬
nomy. With the introduction of West¬
ern science and technology, the
economy has become diversified and
Western products tiave become the
new status symbols.
So a new art has emerged; art which
is different from the old one both in
concept and quality. The constant
demand by the insatiable European
appetite for exotic art has not produc¬
ed more traditional artists; rather it has
produced a lot of plagiarists who are
cashing in on it by unauthorized
copying of the old forms. The result
is what Frank Me Ewen has christened
"airport art" and what Elsy Leuzinger
refers to as "works without cultural
roots or artistic content."
There are signs however that we
may yet rise to the occasion. At Jos
three years ago, a pilot project was
jointly established by Unesco and
Nigeria for the training of African
museum technicians. Students from
ten countries attend courses in English
and French, which include documen¬
tation, photography, chemical conser¬
vation and mechanical repairs of
museum objects.
Already three groups of technicians
have been trained. Technicians, on
returning to their respective countries,
not only carry out preservation of
works of art and crafts, but also sti
mulate the interest necessary for their
appreciation.
Equally as important as the preser¬
vation of old works of art is the fact
that African art can be preserved by
encouraging and patronising contem¬
porary artists. There is a tendency
among art connoisseurs to regard
earlier works of art as better than
contemporary ones, but the latter are
often equally good.
There are two categories of contem¬
porary artists in Africa today. First,
there are those who work in the tra¬
ditional style though not necessarily
from the same religious inspiration.
This category includes, among others,
the wood carvers of Nupeland and
Yorubaland, the cement sculptors of
the Yorubas and Ibibios and the Oyo
calabash carvers.
The second category comprises
those young artists who have had
training at schools and colleges of
fine art, therefore making use of
European techniques and tools but
deriving their inspiration from their
traditional surroundings. They pro¬
duce what might be called popular
art.
It is not therefore surprising nowa¬
days to find both the sophisticated and
the ordinary Africans decorating their
homes with works of art and crafts.
There is no doubt that with this kind
of appreciation and patronage the
future holds out some good promise
for African works of art and craft.
The future lies in the awareness
that our culture and tradition are as
rich as any other in the world. Since
the present generation of adult Afri¬
cans appear to have already grown
away from their tradition and culture
our only hope rests in the education of
our children in the African ways of life.
Ministries of Education should intro¬
duce African studies into the school
curricula and the universities should
intensify search for more knowledge
of the African past. More museums
should be established where only a
few or none now exist and craftsmen
still at work should be encouraged and
protected. This alone can save the
African past from obscurity and pre¬
serve our ancient works of arts and
handicrafts for posterity.
This strikingly modern African bronze figure,
a work by the Nigerian sculptor Ben
Enwonwu, adorns the façade of the
museum of Lagos, federal capital of
Nigeria.

Trends
African
in present-day
literature
EZEKIEL MPHAHLELE, taught
English and Afrikaans in a
Johannesburg high school until
1957 when he emigrated to
Nigeria. There he taught Eng¬
lish language and literature
in the Department of Extra-
Mural Studies at the University
of Ibadan. He now lectures in
English Literature at University
College, Nairobi (Kenya). His
short stories include two volu¬
mes "Man Must Live" (Cape
Town 1947) and "The Living
and the Dead" (Black Orpheus,
Ibadan, 1960). His autobiogra¬
phy, "Down Second Avenue"
(Faber and Faber, London,
1959) has been translated into
eight languages.
IN June 1962 a conference
of African writers of English expres¬
sion was held at Makerere University
College in Kampala, Uganda. The
conference had been called by Mbari
Writers' and Artists' Club of Ibadan,
sponsored by the Congress for Cultu¬
ral Freedom in Paris. This was the
first get-together of its kind ever to
be held anywhere in the world.
Top on the list of questions posed
and examined about the African
authors' practical problems was the
not-so-practical one: what constitutes
African writing? There was an atmo¬
sphere of general surprise, just as if
the phrase we had used, tossed about,
identified certain things by, had sud¬
denly got out of hand and turned
against us with a vengeance.
Had the phrase "African writing"
been misused or abused, after all?
Some participants tried to dismiss the
question as academic; others felt
annoyed; others again tried to laugh
it off or explain it away. But even after
the more serious attempts to define
African writing, it stayed on like a
stubborn white spot on black linen.
It was generally agreed, rather
implicitly than explicitly, that we were
defining such writing in its simplest,
because emotional, terms: as writing
produced by black Africans. On reflec¬
tion, certain questions leap up with
irritating insistence: what about writ¬
ing produced by white Africans? What
distinguishes so-called African writing
from non-African? What, for example,
distinguishes a work by Joyce Cary
Left, "flying fish", two
modern metallic sculptures by M. Calka
which stand close to
the Haile Selassie Theatre,
in Addis Ababa, Ethiopia.
Photo © Paul Almasy, Paris
(not African-born) from that by Dan
Jacobson (African-born) or a work by
Nadine Gordimer (white South African)
from one by Thomas Mafolo (South
African Negro)? Is it theme or style
or both, or tone or point of view that
one goes by?
Joyce Cary was a greater writer than
any of these whites using the African
scene, and it is quite clear that he
identifies himself with neither the
whites nor the blacks in his novels.
He writes with a masterly detachment.
There is a degree of identification in
which a white writer in Africa like
Mr. Paton or Miss Gordimer stands in
relation to the characters and setting
of his or her stories which indicates
whether either of them is African.
In both cases, one can distinctly
tell that they are on the white side
of the colour line. For their identifica¬
tion is stronger with the white char¬
acters than with the black.
This identification is a much closer
and more intimate relationship than
the mere espousal of a cause which
one's characters uphold in the
context of a story; in other words,
it is not just sympathy. It is
a matter of belongingness in relation
to the group represented by one
section of characters one is portraying
and the habitat of that group. What
holds good for the white writer is true
in the case of the black one in his
segregated world.
This is the distinction between a non-
African white writer and a white African
writer on the one hand, and between
a white and a black African writer on
the other.
When we talk of African English writ¬
ing then, I suggest we cannot help
but discuss literature coming from both
black and white in the continent. And
by "black" I am including African
Arabs. But if I insist on the cultural
context in which we use the phrase, I
should then take in writing by black
Africans south of the Sahara, leaving
out both whites and Arabs.
It is in this context that Mbari
summoned the writers to Makerere.
For the artistic problems facing the
South African Negro just to take a
country that has a plural society are
not the same as those confronting the
white South African: there is little inter¬
course between them, although the
paint from the one has rubbed off on
to the other.
But there are certain sets of values
common to so many African ethnic
groups that some South African
Negroes, say, would not find it difficult
to enter into the feeling and mood of
Chinua Achebe's story in Things Fall
Apart. I say some with hesitation
because I cannot say for sure that the
most urbanized African in South Africa
would easily appreciate the story.
But even if, because of the diversity
of our colonial experience in Africa,
and because of our ethnic differences,
we often find that we do not speak
on the same wave-length, this very
colonial experience, the common feel¬
ing among African Negroes that we
are saying things for ourselves about
ourselves which used to be the mono¬
poly of the white missionary, the
anthropologist, the white explorer, and
even the white administrator these
things are sufficient to make all African
Ixügroes respond to the sound of a
bell that calls "African writers" to an
assembly.
And the phrase ."African writing" still
has a strongly emotional content. A
white writer might respond intellectual¬
ly, not emotionally, as the blacks do to
the bell: he is most likely to argue
himself into such a meeting by saying
that he is African. Again, there are
two distinct streams of literary culture

AFRICAN LITERATURE (Continued)
Committed' and 'Uncommitted' writers
26
and consciousness in Africa represent¬
ing black and white respectively.
Our contact with whites has given
birth to a neo-African culture. We can
really only speak of neo-African culture
to define the content arising from the
contact between Western and African
cultures, rather than the quality or
intensity of expression; or, as someone
suggests, the degree of passion in it.
It expresses itself in many voices and
modes, as can be seen in South African
writing and music as distinct from those
of West and East Africa. Vernacular
writing in Africa is unequivocally Afri¬
can in the present context.
African literary forms in English and
French should in fact be studied in
the relevant language department.
John Pepper Clark's, Efua Sutherland's
and Gabriel Okara's poetry, Wole
Soyinka's plays, Richard Rive's and
Alex la Guma's fiction and so on
should be part of the normal English
course. So should Birago and David
Diop's, Senghor's, and Tamsi's poetry,
Cámara Laye's, Mongo Beti's and Fer¬
dinand Oyono's fiction be studied side
by side with Flaubert, Baudelaire, Rim¬
baud and so on in the department of
French. Here African writing is meant
to be treated simply as literature in
Africa, and each work will be judged
on its literary merits.
It is common for the sociologist to
disregard literary merit when he is
doing research into creative writing.
As a scientist, he rightly argues that it
is not his business to give an opinion
on the literary qualities of a book, any
more than is Wordsworth's interest in
dissecting flowers reflected in his
poem, Daffodils.
In his scholarly book Culture and
Society, 1780-1950, Raymond Williams
does not enlist the tools of literary cri¬
ticism for its own sake and then go on
to establish incidentally the place in
the tradition of English culture of
Blake, Wordsworth, Coleridge, Arnold,
T. S. Eliot and so on, on the basis of
their creative work. And yet he is, as
he puts it, "committed to the study of
actual language: that is to say, to the
words and sequences of words" used
by the writers and thinkers to express
themselves on culture. Mr. Williams's
samples are either prose statements
or talkative verse.
It is significant that there is much
more creative writing than scholarly
prose by Negroes in Africa. Perhaps
it is because a poem or short story or
a novel are so close to individual expe¬
rience, and therefore more natural
modes of expression than argumenta¬
tive prose; and, further, because intel¬
lectual systems and the arguments
involved are not native to Africa. Dis¬
cussion for its own sake or to formulate
systems of thought in Africa are a
derivative occupation.
It is because one learns so much
about the African from his poetry and
fiction, e.g: traditional culture and cul¬
ture conflicts and their reconciliation
or consolidation, that a few over-
enthusiastic Africanists often sneak
into the realm of literary judgments
through the back-door. An African
novelist or poet is often raised shoul¬
der high for what is taken for literary
excellence, when all a sociologist
wants to say of a particular work is
that it is illuminating or revealing in
social comment.
Especially is this the case where a
non-African views an African work;
what begins as a natural and perhaps
even reasonable humility in the contem-
plator ends up in self-abasement and
woolly thinking. Often it is a self-aba¬
sement that is symbolized with such
devastating irony by Cámara Laye in
his brilliant novel Le Regard du Roi
(translated into English under the title
The Radiance of the King) when he
portrays Clarence, the white man,
trembling before the African king,
afraid to approach, out of a misplaced
European sense of sin and shame.
But there is much in African writing
to inform the sociologist who has a
feel for language: especially so be¬
cause there are no literary modes set
by a local tradition. The modes are
still as foreign as can be expected
of a tradition that has originated in the
metropolitan centres of the former colo¬
nial authority, or is originated by a for¬
eign educator. There is, for example, a
clear distinction between South African
Negro and West African writing on the
one hand, and between the literature
of the English-speaking and French-
speaking communities on the other:
the diction, rhythms, and themes found
in one region are not common in
another.
IN a short story, The Bench
(1), Richard Rive, a Cape Town colour¬
ed writer, tells us about a young man,
Karlie, who wants to defy the law by
sitting on a bench marked "Europeans
Only". He has been listening to a
political speech and is fired with the
zeal to challenge the system that
segregates people according to colour.
He will sit on the forbidden bench as
an act of challenge and therefore one
of becoming a man.
Abioseh Nicol, the Sierra Leonean
short-story writer, tells in his As the
Night, the Day (2), of a student who
breaks a thermometer in a laboratory.
Another student is made to bear the
blame and is punished. In his bed¬
room in the night the student writes in
shame and resolves to confess the
deed to the teacher. For him, also,

Rutherford (Faith Press, London).

(Gollancz, London).
this will be an act of becoming a man.
Here are the relevant extracts, the
first from Rive's story followed by
Nicol's:
Here was his chance, the bench.
The railway bench with the legend
'Europeans Only' neatly painted on
it in white. For one moment it sym¬
bolised all the misery of the plural
South African society. Here was a
challenge to his rights as a man . . .
That bench, now, had concentrated
in it all the evils of a system he
could not understand. It was an
obstacle between himself and huma¬
nity. If he sat on it he was a man.
If he was afraid he denied himself
membership as a human in a human
society. Here was his chance . . .
He seemed perfectly calm when he
sat down on the bench, but inside
his heart was thumping wildly. Two
conflicting ideas throbbed through
him. The one said, 7 have no right
to sit on this bench'; the other said,
'Why have I no right to sit on this
bench?' The one voice spoke of the
past, of the servile position he had
oocupied on the farms, of his father
and his father's father who were
born black, lived like blacks and
died like oxen . . .
Suddenly, in his little room, under
his thin cotton sheet, he began to
cry. Because he felt the sharp lanc¬
ing pain already cutting into him.
Because of Basu and Simpson and
the thermometer. For all the things
he wanted to do and which would
never happen. For all the good men
they had told them about, Jesus
Christ, Mohammed, and George
Washington who never told a lie.
For Florence Nightingale and David
Livingstone. For Kagawa, the Japa¬
nese man, for Gandhi and for
Kwegyir Aggrey, the African.
Oh-ee. Because he knew he would
never be as straight and strong
and true as the school song said
they should be. He saw, for the
first time, what this thing would be
like, becoming a man. He touched
the edge of an inconsolable eternal
grief. Oh-ee, oh-ee; always, he felt,
always I shall be a disgrace to the
nation and the race.
It is a fact of social history that the
South African character's field of refe¬
rence in the story has a concrete
physical meaning, and evokes a sense
of immediacy: "That of his - father,
his father's father who were born black,
lived like blacks and died like oxen."
The West African character's field of
reference is not so immediate, and is
conceived in abstract terms.
In the South African case, there is
the ever-present condition of oppres¬
sion which releases acute mental and
physical agony. The writer feels com¬
mitted. Through his impressionistic
style, in his anger, impatience, through
the sensuous imagery that he evokes,

From "Ibrahim El Salahl" Mbari Publications,
Ibadan, 1962
In Africa, an ancient world of the arts,
painters and sculptors in every country
are creating new forms of expression
in the visual arts. In many cases
these artists succeed in combining
traditional African styles with the latest
research and techniques in art. This
drawing is by Ibrahim Salahi, a young
Sudanese artist who, after studying
at London's Slade School of Art,
settled in Khartoum. Characteristic
of his work is his use of two
traditional art forms: Arab calligraphy
and the decorative pattern designs
on Sudanese baskets and calabashes.
and the rhythm that reveals a sense
of urgency, he is trying to come to
terms with himself and his environ¬
ment, to reject the status quo even
while he has often to relent in order to
allow the load to sit easier on his
shoulder. And this attempt to recon¬
cile disparate emotions helps him,
paradoxically enough, to retain his
sanity, to survive.
On the West African side, things are
much easier, more leisurely, there is
more sky, no claustrophobia, and the
writer can conceive his fictional char¬
acters within the broader context m
which less immediate and less urgent
thoughts operate. The rhythm, tempo
and texture of the prose and the
writer's mood do not display any sense
of urgency, nor sensuous intensity.
This is no value judgment but a state¬
ment of fact. For Abioseh Nicol is one
of the best prose writers in Africa,
certainly the best in West Africa, using
English.
In West Africa alone, English and
French writing move along different
tracks, particularly in the realm of
poetry. The Nigerian poet talks about
things as they affect him personally
and immediately. He is not protesting
or trying to vindicate his blackness.
The French-speaking poet, however,
particularly of the négritude school (I
do not know any who is not of it or
influenced by it) uses broad symbols
in which immediacy of individual
experience is not the important thing.
These are symbols of Africa, of
blackness, of what is regarded by the
poet as African traits which are ex¬
pected to be a unifying force not
only for the people of the continent
but for the Negro world in general.
Let us look at Leopold Sedar
Senghor's, Prayer to Masks (1):
Masks! Oh Masks!
Black mask, red mask, you black and
white masks,
Rectangular masks through' whom the
spirit breathes,
I greet you in silence!
And you too, my pantherheaded
ancestor,
You guard this place, that is closed
to any feminine laughter, to any
mortal smile.
You purify the air of eternity, here
where I breathe the air of my father.
Masks of maskless faces, free from
dimples and wrinkles,
You have composed this ¡mage, this
my face that bends over the altar of
white paper.
In the name of your image, listen to me'
Now while the Africa of despotism is
dying, it is the agony of a pitiable
princess
Just like Europe to whom she is
connected through the navel,
Now turn your immobile eyes towards
your children who
Have been called
And who sacrifice their lives like the
man his last garment
So that hereafter we may cry 'hero' at
the rebirth of the world being the
leaven that the white flour needs.
For who would else teach rhythm to
the world that has died of machines
and cannon?
For who else should ejaculate the cry
of joy, that arouses the dead and the
wise in a new dawn?
Say, who else would return the memory
of .life to men with a torn hope?
They call us cotton heads, and coffee
men, and oily men,
They call us men of death.
But we are the men of the dance whose
feet only gain power when they beat
the hard soil.
There is nobility of tone and feeling
in Senghor's poem. The masks are n
jumping-off ground for him to point to
the defects of Europe and its civiliza¬
tion and to the revered features of
African culture. The poet's feeling is
diffused over a wide area. The repre¬
sentative images in the poem are those
that turn around "You purify the air of
eternity". And we know when we read
it that we shall never really grasp the
prose meaning of the sentence: it leaps
from our grip into the metaphysical
world.
The individual is not important here,
but the object of adoration as a broad
symbol of what is often called "the
African essence".
Efua Sutherland is the most out¬
standing poet in Ghana and almost the
only highly individualistic writer in her
country. The rest of the poets in
Ghana express nationalist sentiments
and revive old hurts like slavery, and
so on. In a poem, Redeemed, Mrs.
Sutherland shows a sense of urgency
and individuality typical of the Nigerian
poets. A man wants to bring to her
knees a beautiful woman, and crusn
her as a poisonous snake destroys
good things. He smells the Eve
(woman's natural weakness) in her.
But he is afraid and he recoils, over¬
whelmed by her beauty. The prota¬
gonist says:
Love I the pillar of your neck
Governing like a marvel
The balance of the load of your head,
Yet I must break it.
Love I the shine of your skin,
Yet I must dull it.
With leprous venom from my spleen.
He stops short in his designs:
She paused in a pace, and turned on me
A soul that speared my reptile frame
Until I writhed in a helpless coil
And the poison in me did boil
And clot in the glare
From the splendour of her redeemed
[soul.

Orpheus, Mbari Publications.
IT is a matter of interest
that even after political independence,
when colonialism has departed, some
poets still hammer on the theme of
African-ness and want to vindicate
their dignity as Negroes. Are we never
going to know what the peasant' feels
and thinks as he teeters on the edge
of a revolution which demands a
change in his whole mode of living
because his subsistence economy is
unproductive? Isn't there something
to tell about that young man pathetic
and comi-tragic who interprets the
words of politicians letter for letter
and thinks that he is called upon to
strike an attitude of chauvinism,
entangling himself in all its vocabu¬
lary in the process, never realizing that
he is out of step with the aspirations
of his government? How long are our 0"T
poets going to continue bleating like ¿. |
a goat in the crisis of giving birth?

AFRICAN LITERATURE (Continued)
that African literature should be treated
as part of world literature, and not as
something specially African; that there
is in reality only good and bad and
mediocre writing, whether African,
Chinese, Mexican and so on; that there
is a real danger in looking at African
writing merely as the sociologist's gold
mine. The danger lies in the fact that
the number of "bleatniks" will increase
when more of us turn out sociological
verse and fiction, simply as fodder for
the Africanist. It is a transitory phase,
for sure, but it js depressing all the
same.
But I have also said that even the
best of our writing in Africa reflects a
strong sense of social realism. If, as
is happening already, African literature
is used in African Studies because it
affords the student a glimpse of an
African's personality in a given social
climate a glimpse he cannot find
elsewhere due to the paucity of schol¬
astic writings by Africans then the
sociologist has to go through the mo¬
tions of literary examination such as I
have intimated earlier on. Rhythm,
imagery, diction are just as relevant to
his study as mere theme.
IN an ideal situation only
vernacular writing belongs in a depart¬
ment of African Studies. In South
African universities, even the ones
regarded as entirely or predominantly
"white", the three main Bantu lan¬
guages and a fourth minority one have
been subjects for research and teach¬
ing for at least thirty years, but have
been media for creative and journalistic
writing since the middle of the nine¬
teenth century.
It is hoped that the department of
African Studies in each university that
has one will try to stimulate verna¬
cular-literature in this way, among
others. Above all, it is considered that
vernacular writers should also take
part in workshops for those writing in
English or French. There are after
all individual techniques in creative
writing applicable to all languages.
And if vernacular writers are brought
into the workshops, they will realize
that theirs is not an activity apart from
the mainstream.
Furthermore, it is important that wri¬
ters in our indigenous languages out¬
grow the school-book mentality by
which they evidently regard a piece of
writing as important only if it can be
understood by school children. Why
should we not produce a novel in
Hausa or Swahili or Twi or Ibo or
Yoruba which has adult ideas and can
stand critical analysis side by side
with the fiction of Western and Eas¬
tern languages?
There are South Africans like A. C.
Jordan, whose Xhosa novel is a classic,
Thomas Mofólo, whose Sotho novel,
Chaka, is also a classic and has been
translated into English and German;
Makalo Khaketla and B. Vilakazi have
done well in their languages. Even
so, several other vernacular writers in
South Africa are being published by a
pro-government white press, which
seeks to supply literature for school
use: quite a lucrative racket. The first
task of an institute of African Studies
is to correct this senseless if under¬
standable trend.
Before we were invaded by a money
economy, by industries which claimed
enormous migrant labour, the African's
activities were guided by a moral or
immoral purpose, depending on whe¬
ther one deviated from the wishes of
the group or not. Culture was not
separate from anything, comprising
processes which we could speak of
as a "human court of appeal". Culture
was life; each phase marked by initia¬
tion ceremonies was an organic part of
man's education and moral growth.
But now mass media like TV, the press,
advertising, radio, political speechi¬
fying and pamphleteering, world lite¬
rature all these are battering at our
sense of values. Folk cultures are
giving way to urban cultures. And we
find ourselves asking ourselves: where
is the "human court of appeal" to help
us avoid the awful blunders Europe has
gone and is going through.
Some of us feel that we need to
evoke the essence of human relations
which is part of our African-ness. And
some of us build up myths about traits
in the African as a race. And we seem
to be asserting features of a culture we
are not living any more, asserting them
even while we are in Western metro¬
politan centres taking part in their
culture. We even refuse to see our
literature as part of Western tradition,
and like to believe that we are writing
in a style that is peculiarly Negro.
We seem to be losing sight of
culture as an interpretation of a whole
way of life, of a common experience.
We seem to forget that our neo-
African culture, by its very nature, is
going to absorb much more of Euro¬
pean techniques a process that
should not worry us, really: our writ¬
ing can only be valid if it interprets
contemporary society in a mode of
expression that hits on the intellectual,
emotional and physical planes bf
meaning. What more can you ask of
a writer, of an artist, of a musician?
In conclusion, it seems necessary to
warn against the danger of thinking
that because we are Africans, we
should write about the same things and
adopt the same styles or points of view.
Culture interests itself in stimulating
and promoting creative and intellectual
impulses. It interests itself in indivi¬
dual and communal activity. For this
reason we should allow culture to
flourish out of the local needs of a
community.
Culture should be something to be
lived rather than merely talked about.

VERNACULAR LANGUAGES
IN A CHANGING SOCIETY
L, ANGUAGE, in African cul¬
ture, occupies a special place all its
own. Nowhere else, perhaps, has the
relationship between the vernacular
and knowledge been accorded so
important a place or been maintained
for so long a time.
Local tradition in Africa has long
accepted the vernacular as the sole
means of communication, as the vehicle
for the transmission of knowledge and
the medium of thought. In fact, know¬
ledge itself, has always been closely
identified with the vernacular.
The African priest or any custodian
of the wisdom and experience of the
community who introduces the young
to his store of knowledge, almost
always initiates them at the same time
into the practice of an unknown lan
guage. The blacksmith, the saddler
or the fisherman, and the various trade
corporations and guilds, in effect, op¬
erate no differently. Their techniques
cannot be passed on to younger gen¬
erations without the use of special
formulas. Thus it has not infrequently
happened that when an African sage
jealously guarded his knowledge to
himself or was estranged from society
for one reason or another, his store
of knowledge invariably died with him
or else remained an impenetrable
secret to' those who lived after him.
The spread of knowledge suffered
greatly in Africa from this notion which
equated science with a special lan¬
guage and education with the transfer
of secret intelligence.
For centuries the spread of the
Islamic and Christian religions and cul¬
ture amongst broad sectors of "Africa's
population was blocked by this esoteric
approach to knowledge. And in the
past hundred years the introduction of
modern techniques and ideas as well
as scientific thinking have similarly
been seriously hampered. In both
cases language has played a para¬
mount role in the attempt to change
or remould society.
Knowledge can only be understood,
accepted and propagated if the vehicle
of transmission is a known language.
This has been repeatedly pointed out
by African scholars in the past. Early
in the 19th century, for example, a
renowned scholar, Thierno Samba
Mombeza, from Fouta Djallon (a moun¬
tain region in northern Guinea) stress-

Any language is beautiful.

ed this point in the introduction to
his translation into Pular of the Vein
of Gold, one of the great masterpieces
of Islamic literature. In reply to those
who had scorned his undertaking the
translation of such a great work into
"a language without nobility", he
wrote:
Whether Arabic or Pular
Or any other dialect,
All is noble
That facilitates human knowledge.
The Senegalese poet, Moussa Ka,
who produced one of the major works
of his time in the Wolof language,
expressed the same idea as follows:
Arabic or Wolof,
Any language is beautiful
That expresses
The virtues and Science of Man.
These references to Arabic should
not surprise us, for the prestige,
science and cultural contributions of
Islam were such that in many parts
of Africa it was held to be the repos¬
itory of all essential knowledge. Many
an African generation was spared
long, weary hours of reciting and
chanting Koranic texts in Arabic, which
they did not understand, when schol¬
ars and religious leaders bravely
undertook to introduce education in
the vernacular. The translation of the
Bible into many African languages in
the last century was inspired by the
same understanding.
This is a very important point. It
reflects the evolution in attitude
towards modern ideas which took
place in Africa after it came to be re¬
cognized that the crux of the problem
was to introduce modern knowledge
to the greatest number of people.
It also serves to explain why the
vernacular languages were gradually
adopted as indispensable tools for
teaching in primary schools thus
avoiding the emotional problems raised
by removing the child from his lin¬
guistic setting. That is why, too, the
use of the vernacular in literacy cam¬
paigns and community development
schemes has been found to offer the
best chances of success.
Experiments have long been under
way in the use of the vernacular for
technical education and science teach¬
ing, and these have recently gained
new momentum.
The road to economic development
may well lie along these lines: The
experts have pointed this out; and
Unesco has stressed it at recent
meetings on the subject in Ibadan
(1964), Accra (1965), Yaounde (1966)
and Bamako (1965). A meeting of
African Ministers of Education at Iba¬
dan in February of this year re-affirmed
the idea, as did the Government of
Tanzania which has made Swahili its
national and administrative language.
The obstacles to such a programme
are nevertheless tremendous. The
non-specialist often points to them,
particularly to the multiplicity of Afri¬
can languages, the need to adapt them
to the modern world, and their so-
called lack of "literary" and "scienti¬
fic" vocabulary.
The multiplicity of Africa's languages
would seem to be the major obstacle
to their use for cultural and educa¬
tional programmes. But in point of
fact, the actual number can only be
determined after a thorough study
which clearly distinguishes between a
language and its local or dialectal
variants. Any figure based on present
knowledge is more than likely to be in
the nature of a guess.
E have become so used
to talking about Africa's countless lan¬
guages that we have lost sight of the
fact that Africa is, after all, a whole
continent. A more than cursory exami¬
nation of the languages of this conti¬
nent reveals first, that the number has
been vastly exaggerated, and second,
that the situation is hardly different
elsewhere. Europe posseses dozens of
languages and dialects; and "Standard
African" is as much of a misnomer as
"Universal European" would be.
French and Italian exist as separate
languages, so why not Swahili, Hausa
and Yoruba?
Despite the existence of local
variations, the number of linguistic
zones in Africa is really quite small.
Within each zone there is a linguistic
unity which is not only historical but
also a living fact.
Let us take the case of the zone
comprising the so-called Bantu lan¬
guages. Here we find not various
distinct and separate languages but
different dialects of the same language.
The common features are so extensive
that one can pass quite easily from
one dialect to the other.
To take one example. In the Congo
practically everyone is multi-lingual.
In addition to their local dialects, the
Lari, the Vili, the Bateke, the Bangala
and the Kikongo all speak Lingala,
Monokotuba or some other language.
From the number of dialects the Vili
of Pointe-Noire understand one might
assume that they have a special apti¬
tude for foreign languages. A Vili, for
example, can easily understand or get
along in Lari, Teke, Swahili and Chilu-
ba. This is simply explained by the
fact that they are all dialectal varia¬
tions of one and the same language.
The slight differences in these dialects
is evident from the following renditions
for the word TO EAT: KULIA in Vili;
KUDIA in Kikongo; KUDIA in Lari;
KOLIA in Lingala ; KULIA in Swahili.
As can be seen, the differences are
merely a matter of one consonant or
vowel, and serve to illustrate the idea
that the whole Bantu linguistic zone
could today be unified around one of
these dialects. As will be shown in
a moment, this unification would affect
some 100 million persons.
What is true of the Bantu linguistic
zone also applies to other parts of
Africa. In the Sudanese belt of coun¬
tries stretching across Africa just
below the Sahara, the same pheno¬
menon can be observed with regard
to Hausa, the Mandingo language
group (Bambara, Dioula, Malinke), the
Akan Baoule languages of Ghana and
the Ivory Coast, and the Fulani (or
Pular) languages.
All over the world a process of
linguistic unification is now under way.
In Africa the same thing is happening.
Differences in speech are being worn
down, and are giving way to a limited
number of major languages of commu¬
nication. This is occurring as a result
of various factors. Urbanization, the
cultural renascence and the develop¬
ment of great trading centres have
enabled a few languages to unify whole
areas.
This has completely transformed the
linguistic map of tropical Africa so that
many of the splinter dialects of the
past are now being absorbed by about
a dozen dynamic, hard-core languages
today sweeping across the continent.
Some of these languages are now
spoken by over 50 million people, but
most are used by groups of 1 million
to 12 million persons. For example,
there is the Bantu group, spoken by
100 million people; Swahili, spoken by
over 50 million persons in most of East
Africa (Kenya, Uganda, Tanzania, Zam¬
bia) and the Kinshasa Congo; the Lin¬
gala - Kikongo - Monokotuba language
family, spoken by about 30 million
persons over most of Central Africa
(Central African Republic, Congo-
Brazzaville. Cameroon as well as
Kinshasa Congo).
The establishment of a common
language for those who speak Swahili,
Lingala-Kikongo-Monokotuba, or even
Shango and certain Bantu dialects of
South Africa and the Cameroon, is

within the reasonable future.
The languages of West Africa are
more varied. Here, Hausa, spoken by
some 40 million people in Nigeria,
Niger and Chad, could become a
unifying element for a vast area of
Africa.
Yoruba (Nigeria), Malinke-Dioula
(Eastern Senegal, Mali, Upper Volta,
Ivory Coast, Niger), Fulani (Senegal,
Mali, Guinea, Upper Volta, Niger,
Nigeria), and Arabic are all linguistic
groups spoken by from 10 to 15 mil¬
lion people.

Ibo (Nigeria), Akan-Baoule-Bulu-Fang

(Nigeria, Niger, Chad), and Djerma-
Songhoi (Mali, Niger) also form lin¬
guistic areas in process of unification
and are spoken by 1 to 5 million
people.
Thus we see that a veritable pyra¬
mid of languages exists in West Africa,
with several languages spoken in the
same country in Nigeria, for instance,
Hausa, Ibo, Yoruba and Kanuri are
all spoken.

But it is clear that language unifica¬
tion, not dispersal, is the dominant
factor in Africa today.
Efforts to try to adapt African
languages to modern change have
been in progress for many many years.
These were given new impetus with
the establishment of institutions of
European origin.
In 1820, a French schoolteacher set

school at St. Louis, Senegal, where
both Wolof and French were taught.
This pioneer attempt was followed by

agriculture and the crafts.
The bilingual school in the Congo
was the outcome of this development.
In the countries under British rule, a
similar approach, based on the prin¬
ciple of "native administration", helped
the spread of African languages. The
status and influence of these languages
can be observed today in the Congo
(Kinshasa), Uganda and Tanzania.
These countries, with a literacy rate
of 45 per cent, have been able to
establish an excellent political, social
and technical infra-structure by using
African languages for their newspa¬
pers, school books and other pub¬
lications.
The interesting features, here, are
the new possibilities thus opened.
The development of a script in Swahili
hastened the stabilization of the lan¬
guage and its literary growth which
had begun long before colonization,
as attested by the Kilwa dating from
the 17th century as well as an abun¬
dance of other great works of great
antiquity.
This, is- equally true of other- African
languages,' particularly those of- West
Africa,' where" Fulani. and Wolof litera¬
ture, Hausa works (those by Qàn Fodio
are an outstanding example) and the
writings of the Kanuri and Dendi chro¬
niclers bear comparison with Swahili.
Other languages like Lingala or Chi-
luba are entering the writing stage,
thanks chiefly to contemporary efforts.
The adaptation of African languages
to modern change is not yet very far
advanced. In this sense most of them
have not yet become languages of
advanced scientific knowledge or
vehicles of modern literature, reflect¬
ing either in original creative works or
translations from non-African lan¬
guages, the intellectual ferment of con¬
temporary thought.
Although many attempts have been
made along these lines, they are
mainly isolated cases. Nevertheless, a
number of notable examples by out¬
standing African thinkers can be cited.
The Senegalese writer, C. Anta Diop,
has played a pioneer role here. The
second part of his Nations Nègres
contains a series of chapters which
illustrate how Wolof can be adapted
to modern scientific writing. Anta
Diop chose literary as well as scientific
themes and produced translations in
his native tongue of extraordinary
precision and clarity. His rendering
into Wolof of Einstein's Theory of Rel¬
ativity as interpreted and explained by
the French scientist Langevin, is su
perb. He also offers us translations
of poems and excerpts of plays from
French literature that retain all the
exquisite beauty of the original. The
terminology of modern mathematics
and physics which he uses opens the
way for elaboration of a modern scien¬
tific culture in the Wolof language.
Wolof, it is true, is a language with
a long literary tradition. C. Anta Diop
makes this abundantly clear in his book
with a judicious choice of texts. Nev¬
ertheless what he has done for Wolof
can be done for any language, African
or not. Even more recently, the Presi¬
dent of Tanzania, Julius Nyerere, dem¬
onstrated the vitality of African lan¬
guages by his series of literary works,
including a translation of Shakes¬
peare's Julius Caesar.
F OR all languages there is
a problem of adaptation, but not of
adaptability. Linguists know that no
language lacks the ability to mould
itself to a new environment. Every
language has its own built-in system
that meets, the needs of its people.
The. integration of new knowledge is a
matter of .vocabulary;- It does riot affect
the system,.- .which- is" the structure-" of
the" language on which the 'vocabulary-
rests.
Moreover, the need for adaptation
is not a problem exclusive to the lan¬
guages of Africa. It is a world-wide
problem.
Japan established its economic and
scientific force by assimilating modern
skills and knowledge into its own
language, and by introducing new tech¬
niques into its culture to which it gave
Japanese words or transliterated the
original foreign ones.
No language escapes this process.
Why is there a "Franglais" or a
"Japenglish" if not because English" has
become the leading language of the
world as a result of the contribution of
American science and technology?
The best answer to the question
regarding the adaptability of African
languages to modern change is to
remind ourselves how easily modern
techniques are being assimilated into
African languages. It is a truism that
people do not accept all foreign words
indiscriminately. Train, ship, television,
mathematics, drugs in a word all the
elements of the new environment are
spontaneously translated, especially
by the women who often find graphic,
picturesque equivalents for them.
In Wolof, for example, the word for
train is saxar, for mathematics wann,
for drugs garab, all terms drawn from
the language itself. For words like
television, radar or atom, common-
sense operates In Africa as it has in
Japan, Germany or India, and the same
words are incorporated into the lan¬
guage with minor modifications or
none at all.
Today the great problem in Africa
is that of translation. School books
from the primary to the university level
must be translated to make them
available to students. This will faci¬
litate the broad diffusion of science
and technology in Africa. It is easier,
cheaper and will reach greater num¬
bers.
A nation's linguistic policy is not
decided by the individual. The indivi¬
dual can make known his suggestions,
his desires and his needs; but the final
word rests with the State. Specialists
agree that the use of the vernacular
for literacy campaigns and schooling
is certainly the best way to show one's
regard for the culture and traditions of
a people, and the most effective for
making the language the vehicle of
modern change; but the politician does
not always see things the same way
as the specialist.
However, an. increasing number of
countries .are exhibiting a' refreshing
degree of understanding in this matter,'
and this is encouraging. In addition
to those countries of Africa that have
traditionally practiced bilingualism bas¬
ed on the use of both an African lan¬
guage and a European one such as
Nigeria, Ghana, the Congo Kinshasa,
Tanzania and Uganda, others like the
Niger, Guinea and Mali have shown
new interest in the question.
Unesco's programme in Africa which
gives priority to the question of African
languages, shows that Unesco is
keenly aware of this problem and its
effect on the continent's educational
and development policy.
Many details have as yet to be
worked out in agreement with Unesco's
African member countries; but the
proposals elaborated at the Unesco-
sponsored Congress of Bamako in
1965 for the unification of certain Afri¬
can scripts is a step in the right direc¬
tion.
But the big problem remains that of
establishing an Institute of African
Languages, for the training of linguists
and the preparation of school text¬
books in African languages.
Broader and more substantial inter¬
national aid would of course be extrem¬
ely valuable for pursuing this problem
in greater depth, and should offer
greater opportunities for Africa's scho¬
lars, Africa's statesmen and all of
Africa's people.

central figure in the drama
of African development is the African
scientist and the type of education
he needs. It is not only the quality of
the scientist his ability to think critic¬
ally and constructively; his intellectual
qualities and trained capacities; his
ability to seek and discover the truth
that counts. Equally important are
the number of scientists that Africa
can produce within the shortest pos¬
sible time.
Until now, the number of scientists
(including doctors, agriculturalists,
engineers, science teachers and vete¬
rinarians) coming from African univer¬
sities has remained relatively low.
More students seem to prefer an
Arts degree, which can lead to a lucra
tive government job, to a degree in
the sciences; many eschew agricul¬
ture which requires working in areas
with fewer amenities than in the large
cities; others fail to receive adequate
scientific and mathematical training in
their secondary schools; many are not
attracted by secondary school science
teaching as a career, thus perpetuat¬
ing a vicious circle which results in
a shortage of good graduate science
teachers.
This appears to be an Africa-wide
problem. In both Ghana and Nigeria,
for example, education authorities are ««

of Tanzania, now nearing completion close to Dar es Salaam. Unesco and» the United
Nations Development Programme are contributing to its operation and expansion. The
College is part of the University of East Africa. Founded in 1963, this university is
unique in Africa, being composed of three university colleges sited in three countries:
at Makerere (Uganda), Nairobi (Kenya) and Dar es Salaam (Tanzania). All three colleges
have full faculties of arts, social sciences and general science. Academic standards and
examinations are unified and all degrees are awarded by the University of East Africa.

AFRICAN SCIENTISTS (Continued)
37 burgeoning universities
graduates in the sciences has been
estimated at just over 50 per cent of
all students graduating between 1967
and 1970. Yet for 1966-67, science
student enrolment in East Africa is
below 30 per cent of total university
enrolment.
In 1962, African states meeting at
the Unesco Conference on the Deve¬
lopment of Higher Education in Africa,
at Tananarive (Madagascar) proposed
that 60 per cent of the estimated stu¬
dent population of 274,000 in Africa's
universities by 1980 should be stu¬
dents of science and technology.
The 32 university institutions which
existed at the time of the Tananarive
Conference were considered ade
quate to supply Africa with the gra¬
duates it would need up to 1980.
Since 1962, however, five new
universities have been opened which,
if provided with sufficient funds, could
enrol more students and completely
alter the picture of total graduates
that would be provided by African
universities by 1980. .
The five are: University of Lesotho
and Botswana, University of Asmara
(Ethiopia), University of Zambia Lusaka
(Zambia), University "of Malawi (Ma¬
lawi), University of Njala (Sierra
Leone).
Another proposal which came from
Tananarive was that African universi¬
ties should co-operate in teaching at
expensive professional Faculties such
as Medicine which had already been
provided for in 11 universities by
1962.
To meet East Africa's urgent need
for more doctors than those which
Makerere College (Uganda) could pro¬
duce, the intake at Makerere was
increased from 60 to 90 students
annually from 1966, and it was also
decided to open a new medical school
in Nairobi (Kenya) in 1967 with an
annual intake of 30. Another medical
school has been started in Dar es
Salaam (Tanzania), which is affiliated
to the University College there, so
that students are awarded a medical
diploma of the University of East
Africa.

<![CDATA[
The Veterinary Faculty in Nairobi,
which also has students from Burundi
and Nigeria, has increased its annual
intake from 30 to 60. It is proposed
to open a school of forestry at Make¬
rere within three years, and a school
of agriculture in Nairobi. The Engi¬
neering Faculty in Nairobi has also
expanded from an intake of about
60 students per year to over 100. The
expansions are made not for the sake
of prestige, but because East African
countries desperately need high-level
manpower for their development.
The rapid educational expansion in
East Africa helps to illustrate what is
going on in other parts of the conti¬
nent. Ghana and Nigeria, certainly,
must be expanding at much faster
rates than those that apply to East
Africa.
The colonial legacy, whereby Afri¬
can universities had curricula adapted
to those of the universities of their
colonial masters, tended to produce
scientists who were alien to their own
backgrounds. With the coming of
independence, English-speaking West
African universities cut their ties with
the University of London, and intro¬
duced the West African School Exa¬
mination system which has been
working out syllabuses for secondary
schools as well as examinations suited
to their environment.
This has increased the number of
students going from schools to the
universities and created a flexibility
which enables university scientific
curricula to be devised that take cogni¬
sance of the local scene. A similar
situation has arisen in East Africa
since independence, following which
the University of East Africa severed
its relationship with the University of
London in 1963.
The University of East Africa is re¬
designing scientific courses and curri¬
cula to produce graduates with quali¬
fications relevant to East Africa's
requirements. Education options have
been introduced into the B.Sc. curri¬
culum so as to produce secondary
science teachers which countries so
desperately need. Ministries of Educ¬
ation are also giving more bursaries
for students following an Education
Course in the University. In Kenya,
60% of the bursaries go to students
taking teaching as a subject within
their B.Sc. course.
I T has been realized that
an Africanization of the curricula will
require research ariti the production of
local textbooks and teaching aids.
Moves are also being made to esta¬
blish the University of East Africa
Press to publish works produced by
this research.
Although it is accepted that basic
scientific methods are universal, their
application in the new publications
takes account of the resources and
needs of East Africa. The University
College, Nairobi is producing a "Flora
of Highland Kenya" and a "Textbook*
of Tropical Phytopathology" among
other books.
It is realized too that Africans alone
can effectively adapt the curriculum
to their own needs and aspirations;
and it is the policy of the University
and the governments to Africanize
academic staff as rapidly as possible.
The Special Lectureship scheme, finan¬
ced by the Rockefeller Foundation, is
one major move to make this a reality.
East African governments have fur¬
ther accepted the idea of providing
postgraduate fellowships to promising
students to enable them to carry out
research that would enable them to
join the teaching staff of the Univer¬
sity. In all these moves, great stress
is laid on science.
The training of laboratory techni¬
cians for laboratory departments of
the Colleges also was started in 1965
(financed by the Ford Foundation).
This is designed to put an end to the
serious shortage of auxiliary staff,
which places an extra load on the
university teacher of science and
tends to divert his energies from the
essential tasks of teaching and
research.
All these expansions have led to an
expenditure of vast sums for the
construction of laboratories and
accommodation for staff and students.
The University of East Africa, for ins¬
tance, spent nearly £3,500,000 for capi¬
tal construction between 1964 and
1967. This is expected to rise to
£6.8 million within three years. A
substantial proportion of this came
from external sources.
Large sums have also been spent
on laboratory equipment for teaching

MODERN HEALTH SERVICES FOR AFRICA
To reach the modest goal of one doctor
for every 10,000 people Africa will need
to train 13,000 doctors in the next ten
years. Nine countries (Congo-Kinshasa,
Ghana, Ivory Coast, Madagascar, Nigeria,
Rwanda, Senegal, Tanzania and Uganda)
already possess a school of medicine.
Three other countries (Kenya, Zambia,
Cameroon) are setting up medical schools.

and research. All three Colleges,
however, are faced with the prospect
of overcrowded laboratories and stu¬
dent accommodation before 1970 if
more funds are not forthcoming.
It is evident that if current trends
in East Africa are symptomatic of what
is happening elsewhere in Africa, then
the future of science education and
the production of the scientists, on
which Africa so much depends for
economic development, is assured.
The new universities, Zambia, Malawi,
and Njala for example, which are
setting off on their own without affi¬
liation have a golden opportunity to
produce curricula uniquely suited to
their own environments. Universities
like Dakar which maintain close teach¬
ing links with French universities are
somewhat difficult to categorize with
respect to Africanization of staff and
curricula.
In addition to universities, there are
several research institutes which
employ large numbers of teachers
from overseas, but these institutes
look forward ultimately to filling their
faculties with African university gra¬
duates.
The East African Agriculture and
Forestry Research Organization is
engaged in studies on water control
and water use for crops, and its plant
breeding section is trying to increase
the resistance of crops to pests and
disease.
The East African Veterinary Re¬
search Organization does research on
major animal diseases such as rinder¬
pest for which it has developed effec¬
tive vaccines. It also works on bovine
pleuropneumonia, tickborne diseases,
animal physiology and genetics. The
Pesticides Research Unit concentrates
on eradication of the mosquito and the
tse-tse fly as well as control of agri¬
cultural pests and diseases.
The Trypanosomiasis Research Unit
is carrying out research to determine
how sleeping sickness is transmitted
from wild animals into man and domes¬
tic animals. There is also a Medical
Research Unit and an Industrial Re¬
search Unit, both of which are engag¬
ed on research of great importance
to East Africa. Many other kinds of
research await the scientists whom
we hope to produce from East African
universities.
The whole question of communica¬
tion needs engineers to conduct
research into highway construction
under tropical conditions. The Cape
to Cairo Road, which is being
constructed step by step, the road from
East Africa to the Congo, and several
intercontinental highways can be
constructed through areas either of
lateritic rock or the black cotton soil,
whose properties and behaviour need
to be thoroughly investigated by our
scientists if we are to construct major
roads to encourage trans-African
trade. Similarly, engineers are needed
for the construction of our rail system.
The great dam on the River Volta in
Ghana is destined to produce vast
amounts of electricity which in turn
will generate new industries for which
great numbers of scientists and tech¬
nologists will be needed in Ghana. At
present, there is a preponderance of
technicians from overseas who have
temporary posts. Ghana will have to
produce scientists quickly if this
remarkable construction, and the new
harbour at Tema, are to change the
lives of Ghanaians for the better.
At Kumasi University, the School of
Pharmacy has conducted outstanding
research on medicinal plants and has
produced some unique drugs.
Other research, through of a diffe¬
rent nature, has been carried out in the
Biology Department at Haile Selasie
University, Ethiopia, where scientists
have discovered natural herbs capable
of controlling water vectors of some of
the worst tropical diseases.
In Ibadan (Nigeria), the Institute of
African Studies collects information
appertaining to all branches of know¬
ledge in Africa including scientific
works.
Then there are the Academies of
Sciences in Ghana and East Africa
which hold symposia and encourage
members to conduct research on many
national problems. The East African
Academy might well become the Na¬
tional Research Council of East Africa,
advising governments and enabling
them to formulate co-ordinated re¬
search policies for the progress of
East Africa.
There is also the International
Congress of Africanists in which Afri¬
can scientists with their overseas
counterparts meet every four years
to read papers on research appertain¬
ing to Africa that has been conducted
in any other part of the world. The
last meeting in Accra was concerned
with the deficiencies of textbooks in
African schools and universities. It
also focussed on the problem of the
Sahara Desert moving southwards
towards the Equator.
All these and many more tasks the
African scientist must undertake if
he is to contribute to the eco¬
nomic and social development of his
continent. It may be hoped that the
educational programmes and curricula
in schools and colleges will produce
scientists equal to this challenge.
BIRTH OF A NEW AFRICA (Continued from page 8)

invested capital is the assurance of
lasting profitability. It is precisely
because a market offers sure outlets
for a product that the capital invested
in that product brings in returns and
goes on doing so which is obviously
the best security of all.
Great changes in social structures
are now taking place in Africa. The
traditional ways are changing under
the impact of modern economy, new
ideas and information techniques and
in consequence of the desire to imitate
other countries.
So far as social structures are
concerned, the two most important
problems are the rivalry between town
and country and, in a different sphere,
a certain conflict between generations.
This conflict is liable to arise where
the bulk of the population is still vastly
out of proportion with the elite and
when the elite itself stands somewhat
apart, not fully realizing that its
destiny is bound up with the general
development of the generation coming
after it, and so is in danger of becom¬
ing isolated.
There is also a clash of culture be¬
cause the generation now bearing the
greatest responsibilities is not the one
that has been through the universities.
On a level with that generation, new
people are coming forward who have
been brought up in contact with mod¬
ern ideas, science and culture, and
who do not always see the problems
in the same way as their prede¬
cessors. Both sides bear a responsi¬
bility: the older generation should
avoid a break with the younger people,
and the younger ones must quickly
learn where their responsibilities lie,
and they must be given responsibility
practice, as the old saying goes,
makes perfect.
In the training of staff, I think Africa
faces a very great problem, perhaps
the greatest of all its problems. There
can be no political, economic or
cultural development, in the modern
sense of the term without the training
of specialists and technicians.
All countries know this. Sometimes
we move a little too fast and states
start to compete with one another,
each wishing to have its university,
or its higher education centre, even
though not always possessing the
necessary means or the social and
cultural infrastructure. This may be a
fault but I think it is a good fault, mere¬
ly indicating how very anxious all Afri¬
can countries are to train competent
staff as quickly as possible.

APARTHEID IN SOUTH AFRICA
Sir,
The outstanding interest of your
number on Apartheid in South Africa
(March 1967) was enhanced by your
choice of articles and authors which
enabled us to view this social evil
from the inside. The testimony of your
contributors showed how the system¬
atic policy of racial segregation exerts
its influence on thought and express¬
ion, on work and religion and how
it affects culture in general. Apartheid
is the complete negation of the respect
for human rights, including the univer¬
sal right to education.
Michel Vial
Grenoble, France
Sir,
Thankyou for choosing Apartheid as
the theme of your March 1967 issue.
It is a major problem of our time
and one of the most tragic. In my
view the Unesco Courier is duty bound
to tell its readers about the distress¬
ing situations in certain countries,
whether the cause is underdevelopment
or oppression.
G. Perra
Lyon, France
Sir,
After reading your number on
Apartheid I am filled with indignation
at the ideas you express and your
biased allegations.
Naturally, all the plundering and
massacres of white people in Africa
count for nothing. But a riot which
causes some Negro casualties is treat¬
ed as a matter of major importance,
though care is taken not to describe
exactly what occurred.
Obviously it would be better for
South Africa to follow the same road
as the Congo...
To deprive Negroes of a university
education is a crime. But you do
not say how the percentage of illite¬
rates in South Africa and Rhodesia
compares with that of many European
countries.
In all African countries the exodus
of the whites marks a regression in
living standards and civilization and
a return to tribalism, savagery and
corruption.
They wanted their freedom. Now
they have it and they must accept
the consequences. Those reduced
to begging for their means of exist¬
ence should not accuse the very
people who have raised them up from
nothing. Let them show some respect
for those who have been good
enough to help them when this has
meant neglecting the welfare of their
own countrymen.
In view of your attitude I am can¬
celling my subscription.
J. Gruault
Paris, France
Sir,
The subject for March 1967
Apartheid would appear to be treat¬
ed in a controversial manner by
a publication which is issued by an
organization sustained by govern
mental or international funds. Such
organizations should be apolitical and
avoid stirring partisan or racial
prejudice.
Sufficient to say of the situation in
South Africa that there would not be
so large a number of black or white
immigrants into that country if con¬
ditions were bad. Apartheid sepa¬
rate development enables the less
well-equipped or endowed to find
opportunity and training within spheres
to which they are fitted instead of
competing in spheres where they are
at a disadvantage through no fault
of their own.
South Africa, one of the most
prosperous and stable countries in the
world today, gives this opportunity
denied to the citizens of many other
countries in Central Africa.
The content of your March 1967
number appears to be a criticism and
a provocation which could create
discord and bad feeling. Such
attempts are to be deplored, parti¬
cularly in a publication sponsored by
a supranational body. May I suggest
that the Courier be confined to sub¬
jects of cultural and social progress?
Elizabeth de Bourbel
London, U.K.
Sir,
Bravo for your clear, firm and
completely objective summing up of
a situation about which the average
person is generally ill informed.
Raymond Vander Eist
Brussels, Belgium
READER-CARTOONIST'S
THANKS
Sir,
As a cartoonist and a Unesco Cou¬
rier reader of long standing, I enclose
two sketches to express my thanks
for the pleasure that your magazine
has always given me.
Maurice Dutoit
Mulhouse Riedisheim, France
The Unesco Courier a window open
on the world.
SURVEY OF EUROPE'S
STAINED-GLASS
Sir,
I read with great pleasure and
appreciation the attractive pages
devoted to the Corpus Vitrearum Medii
Aevi (April 1967). Thankyou for the
place you have given to this enter¬
prise. It is to be regretted, however,
that no mention was made of the
International Council for Philosophy
and Humanistic Studies which gave
its full administrative and scientific
support to the undertaking and served
as its connecting link with Unesco.
Apart from this, your pages pay an
outstanding tribute to what has been
achieved by this survey of Europe's
medieval stained-glass windows.
Jean d'Ormesson
Assistant Secretary-General
International Council for
Philosophy and Humanistic Studies,
Paris, France
COLONIAL WILLIAMSBURG
Sir,
The issue of the Unesco Courier
on the promotion of cultural tourism
throughout the world (December 1966)
should offer considérable stimulation
to the programme for the International
Tourist Year in 1967, and we appre¬
ciate your reference to Colonial
Williamsburg as an example of the
economic impact of historical preser¬
vation on a community.
I would like to clarify, however, the
financial background of Colonial
Williamsburg as an educational, non¬
profit, organization. Through the gene¬
rosity of Mr. John D. Rockefeller, jr.,
Colonial Williamsburg has a unique
opportunity to provide its visitors a
significant travel and educational
experience considerably beyond what
they pay in return. One result is an
annual operating deficit which makes
an implication of "handsome profits"
here rather far removed from our
concepts and actual experience. A
frozen endowment fund, the gift of
Mr. Rockefeller, Jr., provides an annual
investment income of over $2,000,000
with which we meet our deficit.
Carlisle H. Humelaine
Williamsburg, Virginia, U.S.A.
THE RAILWAYS AND TOURISM
Sir,
Your article on International Tourism
(December 1966) has several pertin¬
ent references to the services rendered
to tourism by different forms of trans¬
port. I am thus very surprised that the
major role of the railways in develop¬
ing tourism appears to have been
completely overlooked.
Louis Armand
Secretary General
International Union of Railways
Paris, France
