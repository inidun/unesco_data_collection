THE ESKIMOS
A people
that refuses
to disappear
This issue of the "Unesco Courier" is devoted to the human rights of the
Eskimos and the uphill struggle they are waging so as not to vanish as a
people. For 2,000 years the Eskimos have lived a nomadic life in the vast
Arctic regions. Today the impact of modern civilization and economic
development is threatening to destroy their culture, way of life, language,
and the traditional structure of their society. At its recent General Con¬
ference (October-November 1974), Unesco decided to co-ordinate a pro¬
gramme of Arctic studies to be carried out by experts from various coun¬
tries and regions such as Canada, the U.S.A., the U.S.S.R., and Northern
Europe. The programme will take into account "the cultural cohesion
of a vast region whose peoples and values... are still largely unknown to
the general public".
The article published below presents some of the highlights of a recent
symposium on economic development in the Arctic and the future of
Eskimo societies. The symposium was held under the chairmanship of
Dr Jean Malaurie at an international congress organized by the Foundation
of Nordic Studies in France (1 ). The President of the International Institute
of Human Rights, Nobel Peace Prizewinner René Cassin, pointed out at
the symposium that "for the first time in their history, the Eskimos
themselves from Alaska, Canada, Greenland and Siberia [had] been
able to meet and discuss problems of common concern."

We have got into the habit of
judging everything from the West¬
ern viewpoint. History has always
been written by whites and for
whites. We usually talk about the
Europeans discovering Canada.
I am about to publish a history of
Canada in which It is the Indians
who discover the French and the
English. We have to try to take in
both points of view; the natives are
human beings like ourselves and
like the whites they change and
will continue to change.
My European ancestors French and English entered
into an undertaking with my Amerindian ancestors I must
admit I am quite a mixture to respect their rights, to make
life easier for them and to help them to develop.
The whites settled in Canada wjth their own legal system,
their own laws, and from the very outset there was this
failure of comprehension which still prevails in the Far
North. Outsiders move In and take over the land, which
belongs In fact If not by law to group, tribe or community.
The concept of private property does not exist among
the natives, only that of communal ownership. I have
avoided using the term "collective ownership" because the
situation is not quite the same as In a country like the Soviet
Union, for instance, where a system of collective ownership
prevails. Ownership is not individual but concerns the
community, and when the individual ceases to be part of
the community or leaves it, so his participation in communal
ownership ceases as well.
Should these natives have a system of ownership
modelled on the white man's system? I myself do not
think they should. They should be allowed the right of
communal ownership to start with, so that they can organize
their own affairs as they see fit on their own territory.
The natives' ownership should therefore extend not only
to the little area in which they live but to all the land which
provides their only livelihood. The influx of whites from
the south into the Far North Is now happening on a scale
which is gradually becoming a matter for concern. In
certain cases, these new arrivals are being granted exclusive
hunting and fishing rights on the very lands where the
natives depend on hunting and fishing for their livelihood.
This is an intolerable situation. ^

The density of population In
Canada as a whole is 950 per
hundred square miles while in the
Northwest Territories it is only 8 per
hundred square miles.
This state of affairs, seen in
relation to the question of the
administration of natural resources,
raises the question whether such a
small number of citizens, admin¬
istering such a vast, rich territory,
should take the profits from its
potential mineral, petroleum and
other wealth. The potential is
there; although extraction is not on a very large scale, we
are convinced that the future possibilities for expansion
are considerable.
The Department of Indian Affairs and Northern Devel¬
opment operates on the principle that one of Its main
responsibilities Is the redistribution of the national wealth
and that It can and should use the rich mineral resources
of the Far North of Canada to raise the living standard
of the people in the poorer parts of the country, such as
the maritime regions and part of the province of Quebec.
It is for reasons of fairness that the Federal Government
wishes to maintain its control over the natural resources.

One of Greenland's problems is
that the country is, officially, an
integral part of Denmark, although
In Greenland we have our own
different rules and laws concerning
landed property. We have an old
legal tradition whereby land belongs
to the State, to the community. No
private individual is allowed to buy
a plot of land. It is possible to
obtain permission to build a house
on the land or to sell the house, but
the sale of the land on which it is
built is not allowed.

It seems obvious that the legal
situation concerning property rights
is different in each of the countries
with an Eskimo population. Green¬
land is an extreme case In this
respect, with its legislation for¬
bidding private ownership of the
land occupied by private individuals.
The same applies in the Soviet
Union, while we in Canada and
the United States have very
different legislation.
Some Eskimo groups do have
land, the reservations administered
by the Federal Government of the
United States. If the whole terri¬
tory was made up of reservations
under the trusteeship of the Federal
Government, the Eskimos would get
the benefit from the minerals that
may be there or may subsequently
be discovered. Unfortunately, most
Eskimos have no land which is the
property of the village or held
under trusteeship as in the case of
the reservations. As things stand at
present, villagers cannot work either in the mines or the
oil producing installations on their territories.
The native population does not, in fact, regard compen¬
sation as the ideal solution, particularly cash compensation,
which in many cases seems the easiest and quickest way
of dealing with Eskimo and Indian groups. They are given
money in the hope that this will divert their attention from
their real Interests, but the Eskimos and Indians are fully
aware that Congress has never yet passed any bill actually
abolishing their right of ownership.
We have set up a number of regional organizations in
Alaska grouping several communities together, such as the

associations for natives living in the mining region of
Alaska, in the northwest, etc. There are In fact local
organizations of this kind covering the whole State now.
As a result of political pressure by these groups and
of intervention by the Secretary of the Interior, one measure
has been adopted which Is entirely to our satisfaction, an
order "freezing" further acquisition of land either by the
state or by private individuals.
In any case, the natives who are pressing for a speedy
settlement of this problem do not regard this as an
exorbitant demand. They have certainly no Intention of
partitioning the state or stirring up trouble. Considering
the living conditions in the villages, we do not think there
Is anything which runs contrary to the interests of the
Federal Government and the State ¡n our claim that the
resources of "our country" should be placed at the disposal
of the natives so that they can provide for their own
economic development in full freedom of action.

I should like to ask you to make
a leap In space that would take us
into those Eskimo communities
where hunting is still the main
occupation.
Let us put ourselves in the pos¬
ition of these small communities of
300 to 500 persons, isolated In
the Far North, impoverished and
anxious about their future. They
owe their survival and their conti¬
nuity solely to their intelligence,
their sense of organization and, in
the last three generations, to our
pricing policies. Proud of having shrewdly overcome
the rigours of the climate over the centuries, they feel,
whatever others might think, that these now-coveted ter¬
ritories, frozen and snowbound, are theirs by absolute right.
But what kind of future can there be for hunting com¬
munities In this day and age? We know it will depend
largely on the practical measures that local authorities
and governments will take.
Claus
BORNEMANN
(Denmark)
Head of the
Secretariat,
Ministry for
Greenland,
Copenhagen
As far as Greenland is concerned,
some reports give the impression
that it is official policy to remove
hunters from their areas and transfer
them into cities. This Is Incorrect,
although In the fishing districts,
small groups are indeed migrating
towards urban centres.
But in the hunting districts the
government would like to see the
scattered settlements maintained,
especially in areas where seals
abound. The authorities try to
encourage this by granting housing
loans to small communities and setting up building enter¬
prises in these areas. Hunters are also given loans for
the purchase of motor-boats.
In the schools children who will one day be hunters
receive some instruction in hunting. But I agree that
schools in hunting districts are providing above all a formal,
not a practical, education.
I should like to know whether scientists can carry out
an enquiry to determine in realistic terms whether a district
is overpopulated or not. I should also like to know if
biologists have assessed the possibilities and the cost of
subsidizing hunting.
Some reports I have read claim that an archaic society
which comes in contact with industrial civilization is
Inevitably doomed. What are the grounds for saying so?
Does this mean that hunting as a modern industry is
doomed?
I go along with Mr. Malaurie when he says that school
is the key factor in hunting communities for I feel that,
whatever the school, its impact will be negative. Shouldn't
people be told and taught about what ¡s happening In the
modern world? I think hunting is a very tough way of
making a living, and even if many Eskimos enjoy it, the
younger ones who have been through school will probably,
sooner or later, want to get out of these places where the
only prospect is hunting.

Mr. Bornemann asked whether
surveys have been made to find out
how far these hunting districts
could meet the population's require¬
ments. I can tell you such studies
have been carried out in Northern
Canada and that they have shown
that the resources are barely
sufficient to meet the present
population's needs, and hence, will
be even more deficient, in relation
to the needs of the future popu¬
lation.
Mr. Bornemann's second point
raised the question of setting up schools for hunters.
That's another problem with which we in Canada are greatly
concerned. Most of the Eskimos do want hunting tech¬
niques to be incorporated in school programmes; but that's
a tricky thing to arrange, because of the difficulty of
obtaining teachers capable of giving that sort of technical
Instruction and the problem of limited budgets.
Jacques
ROUSSEAU
Whether we like it or not, there'll
always be hunting, though admit¬
tedly it may now be declining.
This is bound to happen with the
appearance of synthetic and ranch-
bred furs. Fur-farming is a prof¬
itable business and a white mono¬
poly today, though I don't see why
the north's traditional hunters
should, not take it up themselvesl
The north produces luxury furs;
if fur-farming caught on in the
north, the native peoples would
put a luxury fur on the market. In
fact, fur-farming must be treated as an extension of hunting,
though fur-bearing animals will continue to be hunted, even
if only by a minority.
There is no magic solution for the American Indians any
more than there is for the white man. No territory can
survive by marketing a single product.
There are all kinds of stock-farming. I should like to
show you an example of what may be done with the
musk-ox. Here's a sweater made of musk-ox wool; it's
the first ever of its kind made in the Province of Quebec.
It's a very light wool, a half or a third as light as sheep's
wool. This sweater is made of thick-knit wool, but this
same wool can be used to produce a cashmere as fine
as any in the world.
Alaska already has a musk-ox wool industry, and Quebec
Is shortly to have one too; it is a highly profitable product.

I personally doubt whether there
are any sound economic grounds
for claiming that a good proportion
of the Arctic population of Canada,
Alaska or Greenland could I am
not saying should live off hunting
and fishing, even if these activities
were modernized. I know something
about the musk-ox business, and
I don't think anybody would
question the quality of sweaters
made of musk-ox wool.
But I have real doubts about the
future of proposals for breeding
musk-oxen on a domestic scale. This was first considered
for Canada's northern districts, then in Alaska and now
in New Quebec. Such ideas are to my mind more
glamorous than practical or economically feasible. There
was talk a number of years ago about raising certain
varieties of sheep in the north; all kinds of uses were
to be made of them, and in the most unexpected places.
The author of one study had worked for some time in
Iceland and in southern Greenland. The concepts were
attractive enough but do not stand up in the face of actual
conditions. There is a long-established sheep raising

industry In southern Greenland, but extending it has proved
quite impossible. There were some catastrophic failures.
Even were some of the plans to prove practicable on a
limited scale, they could only have minimal effect on the
daily lives of the Greenlanders even as sources of food.
We are agreed that every effort must be made to protect
the traditional life-style of those who wish to continue
In it. But today many Eskimo children in Canada are
going to high school. Let us hope they go on to higher
education later. It would be absurd to expect these young
people on leaving school to be able to earn a living from
traditional Eskimo occupations of their grandfathers.
William L.
HENSLEY
The Alaskan Eskimos have had to
adapt to a variety of trades to sur¬
vive, for It Is not possible to live
entirely off hunting and fishing.
Additional activities must therefore
be found, and the Eskimos must
learn other skills.
To understand the problems of
the Alaskan Eskimos, as distinct
from those of the Greenland or
Canadian Eskimos. Alaska's geogra¬
phy must be taken into consider¬
ation. Most of the Eskimos live
in some 200 villages scattered
throughout the western and eastern parts of the State and
located fairly close to heavily populated urban centres.
This is not the case in Canada and Greenland.
Even if men are working at various trades, either in their
own villages, or in larger urban centres and in cities, they
must not give up hunting, for they love it. Even those who
work in new industries like petroleum, when they return to
their villages after spending three weeks or so in an oil-
drilling camp, can indulge in a fortnight of hunting and
fishing.
There is still plenty of game in Alaska, even though the
question today is what proportion of the population can live
off it. I know that in the past before the white man settled
down in Alaska there was a big wildlife population. White
civilization has resulted in urban centres springing up
around schools and churches and has had repercussions
on the state's basic ecological resources.
We still have sleds drawn by huskies, but tracked power
sleds are beginning to supplant them nearly everywhere.
And so we must ask ourselves whether the Eskimo who is
doing a regular job in town can afford to be a hunter as well.
Even with plenty of jobs paying reasonable wages, the
fact remains as Mr. Malaurie has pointed out that the
Eskimo workers' basic food, their staple diet, comes from
hunting. We still hunt whales at Point Barrow, and, even
though this is not highly commercialized as it is meant
primarily to meet local demand, whaleskins, for us, are anw
extremely valuable commodity. " r

Then, of course, there is reindeer-breeding, which is
closed to the white man by U.S. federal laws which prevent
him from owning reindeer. Herds of these animals about
60,000 head owned by Eskimo herdsmen are to be found
only in the north-western and peninsular parts of Alaska.
Reindeer breeding has an excellent industrial potential
for the future but, unfortunately, the State of Alaska is today
planning to take over this activity.
We Eskimos get the Impression that the idea is to take
away from us an industry we could develop quite well
ourselves! The Japanese, who are already buying reindeer
antlers which they make into a powder, have shown a keen
interest in purchasing reindeer meat.
We have musk-oxen, too, though at the present time this
activity is still only In its early stages. The transplantation
of musk-oxen to parts of northern Alaska ¡s a very
promising development.
I was very glad to hear that
hunting, as an industry, can be
modernized. Oddly enough, though,
it is considered today In Greenland
by both the Danish Government
and the Greenlanders themselves
as an occupation for backward
peoples.
I feel hunting ought to be re¬
garded as a modern and creative
activity. It provides more than half
the food requirements of the
hunting communities and, de¬
pending on market prices, ensures
fairly high incomes. There is an assured market for
wild fox furs but it is up to us to Improve the quality of the
species in order to become competitive in this market.
So far nothing of the sort has been done.
Looking at Greenland as a whole, we need to examine
ways and means of dovetailing this hunting micro-economy
into the full range of Greenlandic activities. We cannot
afford to overlook any resource that may help to reduce
Angmalortok
OLSEN
(Eskimo, of

Greenland's Increasingly heavy burden of consumer imports.
Our goal must be to produce and to diversify our
production. Furs should be exported and the meat of
marine mammals sold all over Greenland, with the hunting
districts sending their produce to the game-poor south.
Another aspect of the problem Is that of increasing the
value of products before exporting them so as to obtain
the best possible return. Greenland regularly exports furs
and pelts, but curiously enough has no tanning industry.
This could become a new industry depending wholly on the
produce of local hunting.
I should also like to speak of the cultural aspects of
hunting. None of you may think there is any relationship
between the economy and culture where hunting is
concerned. I personally maintain that there is a very
close link.
If Greenlanders are to remain a proud people and continue
to be themselves, then they must accept their real national
Identity, based on the centuries-old Eskimo culture, which
is so closely bound up with hunting activities. We should
also adopt a modern and forward-looking attitude and make
every effort to guarantee the continuity of hunting as an
occupation In its own right and, at least in the beginning,
as the framework for a national identity.
We could go on talking about economics for ever. But
if we fail to provide the conditions to enable the Eskimos
of Greenland, Alaska and Canada to take pride in their
national Identity and culture and assert themselves as a
people In their own right, then I am afraid all the wonderful
economic plans made for them will turn out to be mere
operations for propping up the economy of a deprived
people who will be regarded with something like mockery.
The close link existing between the economy and the way
people feel about their work is well known. This, In fact,
is what motivation is all about. There is also a very close
relationship between motivation and the economy.
I myself was born in Thule, in Greenland, in a hunting area.
My father became one of the best hunters in the area.
Both he and my mother used to say it was by coming in
contact with the Thule hunters, who have remained so close
to their natural culture, that they discovered the best In
human nature, as well as the most combative, the most
constructive and the most independent men. So I feel

techniques rather than Imparting
rudimentary knowledge.
But having thought it over care¬
fully, and having left Thule, I began
to see Greenland as a whole and
realized that the policy followed in
Thule today reflects the aspirations
of the Eskimos living there: they
want to be integrated into Green¬
land society.
Foxes, once the Eskimo hunter's staple, have declined
considerably, whereas the human population in these
regions has risen. At Angmagssalik, for example, it would
be wrong to disperse the hunters, but it may soon become
necessary to cut back hunting expeditions gradually as
reserves of foxes and other wildlife will not be adequate.
A similar situation prevails in other parts of Greenland.
It has to be accepted then that people who can no
longer hunt must be steered into other activities.
Jean
MALAURIE
I must object once again to the
assertions made by the Canadian
and Greenland authorities that wild¬
life stocks in the present hunting
areas are Insufficient to meet the
needs of today's hunting com¬
munities and that this shortage will
be felt In the foreseeable future (in
one or two generations).
As regards foxes, Thule has
always been, and still is, one of the
world's best-stocked areas. The
potential is still vast. There are
100 hunters in Thule; the territory
is as big as 20 French departments, and it can be easily
extended for seal-hunting ten times further in the north¬
west, which is at present uninhabited.
If there has been a drop in the turnover of fox skins,
it is due to market price levels, and has nothing to do with
biogenetic causes.
No published findings of any properly conducted bio¬
genetic and social and economic survey exist to support
a biogenetic explanation of this drop, and I am not saying
this lightly. It would be surprising if there were, considering
the vastness of territories that all kinds of modern means
place at the disposal of a relatively small hunting population
(5,000 hunters operating all year round in the vast American
and Green'and Arctic). What's more, hunting must be seen
as a modern and highly mobile occupation.
I fear that after the departure of the discouraged Eskimos,
white industrialists may exploit these hunting grounds for
themselves. And I should be surprised if they fail to
obtain the assistance and financial backing which the native
people lack today.
The Arctic is vast, and biologically almost unexplored.
It would be astonishing indeed If so limited an Eskimo
population 80,000 in all, less all those who may not want
to, or cannot, remain in the north failed to obtain the
economic and administrative Independence they need for
pursuing modern occupations. Because of its oil, natural
gas and minerals, the American and Siberian Arctic promises
to be one of the regions with the highest per capita income
in the world. A bold territorial policy would surely enable
native communities to finance their own development.

HE traditional home of the
Canadian Eskimos is over
2.6 million square kilometres of Arctic
Canada. They have occupied this area
since many centuries before Christ,
wresting a precarious living from a
harsh land where only a hardy and
intelligent race could survive. Today
about 15,000 live in Canada, mainly in
coastal settlements of 200 to 500
people, scattered along many 'thou¬
sands of miles of the Arctic mainland
and archipelago.
It is generally agreed by anthropo¬

ALEXANDER STEVENSON, of Canada, is
director of the Social Development Division of
Canada's Department of Indian Affairs and
Northern Development. Since last year he has
been directing a commission of inquiry into the
Eskimo language for Canada's National Eskimo
Association, and since 1969 he has headed
the consultative committee for the preservation

ed from Asia across the Bering Strait
or over an isthmus which might have
joined Asia and America much farther
back in time. They came as primitive
hunters seeking game without realiz¬
ing that they had crossed into another
continent.
Over the centuries there were a
series of migrations; probably the
earliest was of Indian people who
almost never settled north of the tree-
line. When the land bridge became
covered with water 11,000 years ago,
new arrivals could have crossed at the
nearest points of headlands between
the continents. The short distance is
90 km. of open or frozen channel
across the Bering Strait to Alaska from
the Asian side.
The sub-Arctic may have been inhab¬
ited for up to 40,000 years, but the
bleak Arctic tundra where the average
temperature for the warmest part of the
year is less than 50°F. seems to have
had a shorter human past. Recent
findings in Alaska, known as the Den¬
bigh Flint complex, contain artifacts
and evidence indicating this culture
goes back to 3500 B.C. and It is
generally accepted as the primary
source from which Eskimo culture
developed.
If the ancestors of the present-day
Canadian Eskimos arrived in North
America over 5,000 years ago, they
had spread across 8,000 km. of
winding coast from Siberia to Green¬
land by 1000 A.D. This is about the
same time that, according to the early
Norse sagas, the Vikings sailed from
Greenland across Davis Strait to
Baffin Island. There they saw or met
people called Skraellngs a Norse
word which seems to describe both
Indians and Eskimos. When the Norse
withdrew, a gap of centuries passed
before explorers and adventurers
again visited the stark, silent shores
of Arctic Canada.
It is difficult to generalize about
Eskimos as a whole because there are
significant regional differences bet¬
ween groups. Generally speaking, the
great majority were coastal dwellers
and most of their food, fuel and
clothing was obtained from the sea
in the form of walrus, whales, seals.
Land animals such as the caribou
and musk ox also contributed to their
way of life. Many generations never

ESKIMO TRADITIONAL WAYS
MUST NOT DIE
Victors for thousands of years
over a harsh environment, the Eskimos
today face their greatest challenge :
how to preserve their identity
JEAN MALAURIE, French geographer and
explorer, is professor of Arctic anthropology and
geomorphology at the University of Paris and
professor of Arctic geography at the Ecole
Pratique des Hautes Etudes In Paris, where he
Is also director of the Centre of Arctic Studies.
Secretary-General of the French Foundation of
Nordic Studies, he is the author of over 150
scientific studies. In 1970 he produced and
directed a film version of his best-selling book
on the lile and present-day problems of the
Greenland Eskimos, "The Last Kings of Thule"
(Crowe/I New York, 1956), translated into 15
languages. His "Les Civilisations Esquimaudes"
(Eskimo civilizations) was published last year,
andhis work, "Anthropogéographie Esquimaude "
(Eskimo anthropogeography) , will appear shortly
(Plön Paris). In 1974, the French radio and TV
commissioned Jean Malaurie to make three films
on "The Eskimos Face their Destiny" in co-opera¬
tion with native organizations and the authorities
of Alaska, Canada, Greenland and Siberia.
Shooting on location has been completed in
Alaska and Canada and is under way in Green¬
land and Siberia.
N America it is expected that the
last autonomous groups of native
hunters in the Arctic will disintegrate
if not totally disappear within the next
20 years. The total assimilation of the
native peoples of the North American
Arctic and sub-Arctic during this
period is, however, quite impossible.
But the decline, already dating back
some years and the cause of serious
unrest, will only be hastened by
current mineral and oil prospecting in
northern Alaska (Prudhoe Bay) and
northern Canada, and plans to speed
up the development of Greenland's
codfishing industry.
Is the object to incorporate these
societies in the West's market-oriented
production system and turn them, as

far as their limited local hunting and
fishing resources allow, into consumer
societies? Or is it felt that the com¬
prehensive development of these un¬
der-developed regions presupposes a
respect for local cultures which form
part of our global civilization and
without which the world would be so
much the poorer?
Not long ago Unesco defined this
complex notion of "development" as
"any process aiming to create the
conditions of a given society's eco¬
nomic and social progress with the
help of that society's active partici¬
pation and, if possible, at its own
request."
The French economist Daniel Nat
has made the following excellent ana-

MODERN LIFE PLAYS HAVOC WITH ESKIMO EYES AND
TEETH. Eskimos' eyes are very well adapted to the Arctic
climate. The eye fissure is extremely narrow (photo left),
and to protect themselves against snow blindness Eskimos
wear goggles carved of wood, bone, ivory or other materials
which admit light through a narrow slit (below). But changes
in diet brought about by contact with modern civilization
have had deleterious effects on many Eskimos' eyesight.
When they lived in natural conditions on a high-protein diet.
the Eskimos enjoyed good eyesight, often spending long
periods on close work in poor light. Dr Elizabeth Cass, of the
Department of National Health and Welfare, Ottawa, studied
the eyesight of groups of Canadian Eskimos and discovered
that when Eskimo children moved to townships or settlements
where they ate starchy foods, poor in proteins, they began
to develop myopia. Starchy diets have also been found to
ravage the teeth of many young Eskimos, even resulting in
the total loss of teeth at adolescence and digestive disorders.
lysis of these points of view: "Either
we consider that a culture Is sovereign
and unique and that the material and
cultural elements which comprise it
are indivisible; or we consider that
underdevelopment englobes all aspects
of society... A people's underdevelop¬
ment then becomes, and this is the
commonest attitude, a sign of Inferior¬
ity, a sickness inherited from the
past."
The white man's first contacts with
the Eskimos in the 18th century were
sometimes violent. Quite soon, how¬
ever, the native peoples put up only
ä passive resistance, while trying to
absorb into their culture everything
practical and useful the white man
could offer them.
In reality, this superficial passive-
ness showed the immense pragmatism
of this impoverished people, their age-
old patience and their unshakeable
confidence In their destiny. Econo¬
mists have frequently misinterpreted
the Eskimo's mask-like smile. It has
been seen as a sign of eagerness to
receive aid or become assimilated,
whereas it was a manifestation, at
least until recently, of a desire to
co-operate in a spirit of self respect
and dignity.
Given this state of Incomprehension
between the agents of the dominant
society and the native peoples, it Is
hardly surprising that some quite
absurd situations have arisen.
It has actually been suggested that
the inhabitants of Canada's District
of Keewatin and Southampton Island
(In the Hudson Bay) should grow let¬
tuce or eat canned fish, that a timber
industry should be developed in a
treeless tundra, and that workshops
manufacturing felt for hats should be
set up in Cambridge Bay.
Boarding schools in northern Green¬
land provide no instruction in modern
hunting methods for the sons of trap¬
pers. With local facilities offering, for
the moment, no prospect of jobs other
than those they have done for cen¬
turies, one wonders what kind of
future these children are being edu¬
cated for. In the words of one obser¬
ver, the progressive school conceived
according to the assimilative ideas of
the white man will end up by killing
development.
Is it surprising then that the native
peoples, long uncomplaining, are be¬
ginning to grumble about the white
man's inconsistencies? "Send us back
to our lands...", they say. "If we stay
here too long we shall have lost even
the will to live." This at any rate was
the gist of what Garry Lake Eskimos,
in Canada's District of Keewatin, told
government researchers in 1962.
The missionary will probably say
that the Eskimo should be converted
and turned Into a church-goer. The
teacher will argue that everybody,
white or Eskimo, should be given equal
opportunities. He will tell Eskimo
children that they should learn English
or Danish, for every white man is se¬
cretly convinced that bilingualism will
release these people from the strait-
jacket of their traditions, centred on
the family with its intricately woven
texture of kinship and its web of rules.
For planners, the Eskimo needs edu¬
cation, training in the white man's
system and a sense of responsibility.
If current trends are not checked,
whole areas of the Arctic which have
been populated for centuries will soon
be deserted. Idle and bitter, the Eski¬
mos will drift into a few big towns
without an economic future places
like Fairbanks, Anchorage, Nome and
Kotzebue in Alaska ; Fort Chimo, Ran¬
kin Inlet and Frobisher in Canada; and
Godthaab, Godhavn, Angmagssalik
and Thule-Kranak in Greenland. Unrest
will grow among these unemployed
minorities and they will become in¬
creasingly difficult to assimilate.
The deserted plateaux of Keewatin
and New Quebec, considered too poor
in game for Eskimo hunters, will be¬
come a playground for millionaires
from southern Canada and the United
States. This is already happening.
White tourists on hunting and salmon-
fishing trips are beginning to take the
place of the Eskimo, whose status has
been reduced to that of guide. Who
knows, the demand for local colour
may soon lead to the building of Eski¬
mo villages as tourist attractions.
The governments exercising trustee¬
ship over these peoples are no longer
convinced that hunting is an econo¬
mically viable activity, although some
relatively impressive results have been
achieved. Greenland still applies a ^
policy of guaranteed minimum prices to r

Snowmobiles, above, are one of many modern innovations in the Far North.

its hunting communities in the north¬
west and on the east coast, but neither
Canada nor Alaska subsidize this vital
activity of their Eskimo population.
This refusal to organize an economy
based on contracts is a measure of
the mistrust in which the native peoples
are held. The government reaction is:
"What future can they have as Eskimos
and hunters? Let's civilize them first;
then we'll see."
And yet hunting has brought excel¬
lent returns. In Its time it has made
a fortune for powerful firms like the
Hudson's Bay Company, and together
with other occupations like fishing and
reindeer rearing, It has been organized
on rational modern lines and still pro¬
vides a good income for the inhabi¬
tants of the U.S.S.R.'s Chukotka
region and the autonomous districts of
northern Siberia.
To be profitable, a hunting economy
requires certain specific conditions.
The first requirement is that the area
should be biologically rich. Secondly,
the hunting community Itself must be
tightly-knit if the operation is to be
soundly managed. Thirdly, and this is
especially true today, hunting must be
organized on industrial lines. If the
second two conditions are not met,
and if the native society is not pro¬
tected against itself, even the richest
hunting area will only support an
impoverished community.
Before the Danish State took over
full responsibility for the District of
Thule, this territory provided its Ad¬
ministrator (at the time, Knud Ras-
mussen) and his staff with a relatively
high annual revenue.
The extraordinary cohesiveness of
the Thule community was successfully
preserved by Knud Rasmussen. As
early as 1923, he gave the community
a political form, through a series of
new laws based on old customs. A
"Hunters' Council" with limited powers
but foreshadowing tomorrow's Eskimo
government, was set up to administer
the territory. ; Proud of their privileges,
the people felt that they were working
for themselves. Living in relative
isolation, the community was also
protected from outside diseases and
had no chance to eat unsuitable foods.
After Knud Rasmussen's death, and
especially since 1936, the adminis¬
trative district of Thule was gradually
incorporated into the rest of Greenland,
with the result that this model group of
Eskimos lost its uniqueness and its
privileges.
Since 1950 this decline has followed
a classic course, with the break-up of
the family as a unit of life and pro¬
duction (one woman in four now does
not marry, but instead bears children
to a number of men); abortions; a
growing indifference to group interests;
a weakening of leadership.
Young people are giving up the
kayak, since they are not taught how
to handle kayaks at school and are
afraid of sailing them. Marksman¬
ship is getting worse; the Eskimos are
settling down more and hunting less.
They are increasingly dependent on
manufactured gadgets, investing less
in production, and their traditional
codes are falling Into disuse.
Some Eskimos are leaving their
communities, and educated Eskimos,
scarcely representative of the com¬
munity's confused aspirations, are
betraying their origins and seeking
rapid assimilation into white society.
Drunkenness and tooth decay are
on the increase (few Eskimos do not
need dentures by the age of 40). They
are increasingly subject to eye dis¬
orders and their resistance to cold
has diminished as a result of un¬
suitable foods (flour, jam, sugar, etc.).
This moral crisis and physiological
weakening have reduced productivity.
Once a creditor society, the District
of Thule Is now heavily in debt. This
is particularly alarming because of the
presence of a big military base at
Dundas-Thule.
Drawn by the garbage, large numbers
of foxes, prized by the hunters, con¬
verge on the base (which is out of
bounds to Eskimos), with the result
that the rest of the region is depleted.
The base is also a permanent remin¬
der to the hunters of their impove¬
rishment, for an unskilled Danish or
American worker there makes four
times more than an experienced
Eskimo hunter.
The Thule Air Base at Dundas has
thus become a symbol to the Eskimos,
prompting them to ask questions about

the meaning of the historic segregation
which they discover there. "It's too
late," Eskimo hunters of the region
told me again and again In the spring
of 1969. "The young are increasingly
at odds with their elders and lack
confidence in themselves. They no
longer know what they are and some
of them are likely to quit the land in
the near future ... It is the cleverest,
those who have done best at school,
who will go away. Our hunting
economy, which depends on team
effort, will be disrupted and further
impoverished.
"The schools cream off the best of
our hunters. As technicians, they will
only find work away from our territory,
in the south, which is In some ways
a foreign country to them. The less
intelligent ones will stay with us. They
don't learn how to handle a kayak at
boarding school, which also robs them
of the opportunity to get day-in day-
out Instruction in hunting from their
fathers. And so they won't be such
good hunters. They won't be able to
make a living from hunting.
"We only go out hunting regularly
because we love our dogs and have
to feed them. And yet hunting is our
real life, our natural source of satis¬
faction as men. In the south don't
they know that we don't live to
'produce', but to be ourselves, living
together according to our customs?
"We Eskimos don't even own the
land on which we have been living
for centuries. What will it be like
when oil is found beneath our soil?
Whose will it be?"
It is easy enough to criticize, but
these deplorable facts are convincing
proof that it is basic principles that
must be re-examined, not remedies
which are likely to turn out to be
mere palliatives. The Thule hunters
are in fact saying what Jean-Jacques
Rousseau observed two centuries ago:
"The slightest change In customs,
even if it has certain advantages,
always turns out to the detriment of
morals." Rousseau went on to add,
with a wisdom close to that of the Eski¬
mo, "For customs are a people's mora¬
lity. The moment it ceases to respect
them, there is no rule but its passions,
no brake but laws."
The questions that arise today need
to be framed In the context of the
general problem of relations between
co-existing cultures.
On this subject, an editorial which
appeared in the review Inter-Nord
in March 1968 had this to say:
'Until now these relations have
usually been defined by outright
conquest, latent colonization, enforced
integration and by the anthropological
annihilation of the weakest. The
question now is whether the modern
relationship patterns worked out in the
American Arctic in recent years are
radically different from previous
attitudes, and whether they can
eliminate the old ways of thinking, so
long as it is not clearly and expressly
recognized that all cultures are equally
valid, and so long as the Universal
Declaration of Human Rights is not
reinforced by a universal declaration
of the rights of societies as they are
and as they hope to be."
The International Covenant on Econ¬
omic, Social and Cultural Rights
clearly indicates in Article I that "All
peoples have the right of self-deter¬
mination. By virtue of that right they
freely determine their political status
and freely pursue their economic,
social and cultural development."
Article 11 of the Convention con¬
cerning the protection and integration
of indigenous and other tribal popu¬
lations, adopted by the General
Conference of the International Labour
Organization in 1957, is quite explicit:
"The right of ownership, collective or
individual, of the members of the
populations concerned over the lands
by market prices, flying in the face of
any resistance on social or historical
grounds, or to guarantee these minor¬
ity peoples a future within the context
of a policy of overall development?
As long as there is no well-defined
integrated policy of getting the native
people to develop the tundra for their
own use by their own efforts (as in
the U.S.S.R. and Sweden) so that pri¬
ces paid to hunters and fishermen are
guaranteed at a very high level by
royalties from oil and mining industries
developed on their territory, there will
be a strong temptation to drift into
discouragement and pessimism and
encourage the derelicts of Arctic socie¬
ties to emigrate south or to the growing
mining Industries in the north.
An active, vigorous society is also
a productive society. By turning to the
Arctic seas (fisheries, fish breeding,
etc.) and the tundra (traditional and
modern ways of hunting, raising rein-
40 MILLION ACRES FOR NATIVE ALASKANS
On December 18, 1971, the Alaska Native Claims Settlement Act was signed by
the President of the United States. This was hailed by the native peoples of
Alaska as the beginning of a new era. The Act invested 12 newly created native
Alaskan "Corporations" with considerable economic and political power.
The Corporations became the full owners of 40 million acres of land and all its
underground resources, which they were free to choose. They also received the
sum of $962.5 million from the U.S. Treasury in compensation for relinquishing
their historic rights to any other territories in Alaska. On December 18, 1974,
the choice of lands by the Corporations was finally completed.
Among the various legal provisions, one specifically authorizes and encourages
bilingualism ¡n all regions where the people still speak their native languages.
The Eskimos and Indians of Alaska representing one-third of the State's population
have displayed outstanding adaptability and political acumen in coping with the
difficult legal and economic problems raised by the Settlement Act
The Alaska Native Claims Settlement Act may well provide a model or indeed
a lesson, if some of its provisions turn out to be negative for any new measures
which might be envisaged for Canada as well as Greenland.
which these populations traditionally
occupy shall be recognized."
The Canadian Prime Minister,
Mr. Pierre Trudeau, has written that
In view of Canada's "polyethnic"
character, "the different regions within
the country must be assured of a wide
range of local autonomy, such that
each national group, with an Increasing
background of experience In self-
government, may be able to develop
the body of laws and institutions essen¬
tial to full expression and development
of its national characteristics."
One could wrangle endlessly over
the meaning of the word national, but
it cannot be denied that the Eskimos
and the Indians are ethnic groups with
a national vocation. There was, one
may recall, a confederation of Five
Iroquois Nations in the 18th century.
Since 1951, administrative changes
have been taking place in Greenland,
and today the Greenland Council, the
"Landsraad", is administratively auton¬
omous within the Danish State. The
changes reflect a trend towards an
increasingly autonomous system.
What kind of development is being
sought in these regions? Is the aim
to create an economy governed solely
deer and musk oxen) the Eskimos will
regain their dignity and their full au¬
thority as a community, through doing
work which is natural and familiar to
them. It Is Important that the life of the
Eskimos as hunters and fishermen
which is a civilization in itself no
longer be a survival from the past but
be recognized as a privilege and
model for others to follow. This can be
brought about through a hunting and
fishing production policy, biologically
planned and economically guaranteed
to provide high remuneration from
local oil revenues.
Endowed with substantial financial
resources, such a community could
become the centre of modern Eskimo
life, a true "national home", where
those Eskimos who are eager to be¬
come involved in the life of the south
(mining, public works, service indus¬
tries) could nevertheless rediscover
their cultural identity.
This is no Utopian idea. Already
Alaskan Trustees and Corporations
are studying revolutionary plans for
Eskimo villages. The Eskimo people,
we can be sure, still have plenty of
surprises in store for us. M

Eskimos have always depended on animals for
their survival, and many an Eskimo caught in a
blizzard owes his life to the stamina and sense
of direction of huskies like the one shown at
left, peering through a snowy mask. In good
conditions a hard-driven eight-dog team can
pull a sled over 100 miles in 24 hours. "Give me
winter, give me dogs and you can keep the
rest", wrote the great Greenland ethnologist
Knud Rasmussen (1879-1933). Trained huskies
are invaluable on hunting expeditions, .using
their keen sense of smell to sniff out seals'
breathing holes and polar bears' lairs.
The young bears shown above will not harm the
Eskimo children watching them, but hunting
the full-grown animals across snow and ice,
far right, is perilous. Bear-hunters use huskies
to harass their quarry until they can get
within shooting range. In the past, in some
parts of the Arctic where there were few dogs
a man would pursue a bear over long distan¬
ces on foot, armed only with a harpoon.
Skilled carvers, the Eskimos often depict ani¬
mals in ivory and stone. The base of this stone
carving of a polar bear, right, by Manno,
represents the animal's reflection on the ice.
Animal farming as well as hunting is practised
in some parts of the Arctic. The forest of ant¬
lers seen in this striking light effect, above right,
belongs to a reindeer herd on Yamal Peninsula
in the Soviet Far North.

Open letter from Chief Dan George of the Capilano Indians
'I was born 1,000 years ago../
My very good dear friends :
WAS it only yesterday that man
sailed around the moon? You
and I marvel that men should travel so
far and so fast, yet if they have trav¬
elled far then I have travelled farther,
and if they have travelled fast then I
faster, for I was born a thousand years
ago, born in a culture of bows and
arrows. But within the span of half a
lifetime I was flung across the ages to
the culture of the atom bomb and from
bows and arrows to atom bombs is a
distance far beyond the flight to the
moon.
I was born in an age that loved the
things of nature and gave them beauti¬
ful names like "Tessoualouit" instead
of dried up names like "Stanley Park".
I was born when people loved nature
and spoke to it as though it has a
soul: 1 can remember going up Indian
river with my father when I was very
young. I can remember him watching
the sunlight fires on Mount Pé-Né-Né.
I can remember him singing his thanks
to It as he often did, singing the Indian
word "thanks" very very softly.
And the new people came, more and
more people came, like a crushing
rushing wave they came, hurling the
years aside, and suddenly I found
myself a young man in the midst of
the twentieth century.
I found myself and my people adrift
In this new age but not a part of it,
engulfed by its rushing tide but only .
as a captive eddy going round and
round. On little reserves and plots of
land, we floated in a kind of grey
unreality, ashamed of our culture which
you ridiculed, unsure of who we were
and where we were going, uncertain
of our grip on the present, weak in
our hope of the future.
I had a glimpse of something better
than this for a few brief years. I knew
my people when they lived the old life;
I knew them when there was still a
dignity in their lives and a feeling of
worth in their outlook; I knew them
when there was unspoken confidence
in the home and a certain knowledge
of the path they walked upon. But
they were living on the dying energy
of a dying culture, a culture that was
slowly losing its forward thrust.
We did not have time to adjust to
the startling upheaval around us; we
seem to have lost what we had without
a replacement; we did not have time
to take our twentieth-century progress
and eat it little by little and digest it.
Do you know what it is like to be
without moorings? Do you know what
it is like to live In surroundings that
are ugly? It depresses man, for man
must be surrounded by the beautiful
if his soul is to grow.
Do you know what It is like to feel
you are of no value to society and
those around you, to know that people
came to help you but not to work with
you, for you knew that they knew you
had nothing to offer. Do you know
what It is like to have your race
belittled, and have you been made
aware of the fact that you are only
a burden to the country? Maybe we
did not have the skills to make a
meaningful contribution, but no one
would wait for us to catch up. We
were shrugged aside because we were
dumb and could never learn.
What is it like to be without pride
in your race? Pride In your family?
Pride and confidence in yourself?
What is It like? You don't know for
you never tasted its bitterness. I shall
tell you what it is like. It is like not
caring about tomorrow for what does
tomorrow matter! It Is like having a
reserve that looks like a junkyard
because the beauty In the soul Is dead
and why should the soul express an
external beauty that does not match it?
And now, you hold out your hand
and you beckon to me to come over:
"Come and integrate", you say, but
how can I come? I am naked and
ashamed; how can I come in dignity?
I have no presents, I have no gifts.
What is there in my culture you value?
My poor treasure you can only scorn.
Am I then to come as a beggar and
receive all from your omnipotent hand?
Somehow, I must wait, I must delay.
I must find myself, I must find my
treasure. I must wait until you want
something of me, until you need
something that is me. I can raise my
head and say to my wife and family:
"Listen, they are calling, they need me,
I must gol" Then, I can walk across
the street and I will hold my head high
for I will meet you as an equal. I will
not scorn you for your gifts and you
will not receive me in pity. Pity
I can do without. My manhood,
I cannot do without. I shall not come
as a cringing object of your pityl I
shall come in dignity or I shall not
come at all!
You talk big words of integration in
the schools: does it really exist? Can
we talk of Integration until there is
social integration? Until there is
Integration of hearts and minds you
have only a physical presence and the
walls are high as the mountain range.
Come with me to the playground of
an Integrated high school. See how
level and flat and ugly the black top is.
But look, now it is recess time, the
students pour through the doors.
Soon, over there, is a group of white
students and see, over there, near the
fence, a group of native students, and
look again, the black is no longer level:
mountain ranges rising, valleys falling
and a great chasm seems to be
opening up between the two groups,
yours and mine, and no one seems
capable of crossing over. But wait,
soon the bell will ring and the students
will leave the playground.
Integration has moved Indoors.
There is not much room in the class¬
room to dig chasms so there are only
little ones there, only little ones for
we won't allow big ones, at least not
right under our noses.
What do we want? We want first
of all to be respected and to feel we
are people of worth; we want an equal
opportunity to succeed in life. But we
cannot succeed on your terms, we
cannot raise ourselves on your norms,
we need specialized help In education,
specialized help in the formative years,
special courses in English; we need
guidance, counselling; we need equal
job opportunities for our graduates.
Otherwise our students will lose
courage and ask: "Well, what Is the
use of it all?"
Let no one forget it: we are a people
with special rights guaranteed to us
by promises and treaties. We do not
beg for these rights, nor do we thank
you for them because, God help us,
the price we paid was exorbitant. We
paid for them with our culture, our
dignity and our self respect. We paid
and paid and paid until we became a
beaten race, poverty-stricken and
conquered.
I know that in your heart, you wish
you could help. I wonder if there is
much you can do, and yet there ¡s a
lot you can do. When you meet my
children, respect each one for what he
is: a child and your brother. Maybe
It all boils down to just that.
Dan George
This letter from Dan George, chief of the
Capilano Indian tribe In British Columbia,
Canada, was read to a recent symposium on
the economic development of the Arctic and
the future of Eskimo societies (see pages 4-11)
by a missionary. Father André-Pierre Steinmann.
He told the symposium that in his ' view this
eloquent letter could equally well express the
feelings of Eskimos In Greenland and Canada.
Father Steinmann, of Puvirnituq, New Quebec,
has spent over 30 years with the Eskimos and
is a pioneer of their cooperative movement.

On the following pages the "Unesco Courier" pre¬
sents passages from a unique and as yet unpublished
textbook of Eskimo culture. The chapter from which
the extracts are taken is an account of the Eskimo
way of life as related by the people of Payne Bay,
an Eskimo village of 250 inhabitants on Ungava Bay
in New Quebec (Canada). While compiling the book,
a Canadian specialist in Eskimo language and culture,
Michèle Therrien, spent many hours listening to the
village story tellers of Payne Bay recounting for the
benefit of their children the folk wisdom and skills
which have enabled the Eskimos to survive in a
harsh and inhospitable environment.
In the past, Eskimo children lived in close contact
with their parents, who were their sole teachers.
With the coming of modern civilization and a more
settled way of life, many Eskimo children now
attend residential schools and are thus separated
from the family and its traditional education. For
this reason, Eskimos have often asked that special
attention be given to the teaching of Eskimo culture
in schools.
It was in response to this wish that the School Board
of New Quebec asked Michèle Therrien to prepare
a textbook in which the Eskimos themselves would
share in setting down the basic features of their
culture. Madame Therrien is a lecturer at the Centre
of Arctic Studies and at the Institute of Oriental
Languages and Civilizations (both in Paris). The
textbook is to be published shortly in a trilingual
Eskimo, English, French edition by the School
Board of New Quebec (Quebec Ministry of Educa¬
tion, Canada).
The Eskimos use two sys¬
tems of writing, one sylla¬
bic, the other alphabetic.
The letters in syllabic writing
above are pronounced "Kan-
girsumiut" and mean "the
people of Payne Bay". Payne
Bay (whose Eskimo name is
Kangirsuk) isasmall villagein

whose inhabitants helped to
produce the textbook of
Eskimo culture, extracts of
which are published here.

The way we lived
/ When we were young, our
homes were cold places. My
mother used to go off fishing
while I stayed behind. When
she was nearly home, I could
hear the noise she made cross¬
ing the snow and at last I
would see her emerging from
the darkness of the night.
We were very thankful when
she brought fish back with her
or when my father brought
back seal meat. When they
were away, I stayed by myself
in the cold house.
When I grew up, I went off
in search of moss for the fire.
I used to bring back great
quantities of it. This was how
it was until the time came to
move into the igloo.
The menfolk used to hunt the
walrus. When the hunting had
been good, they would bring
the sledge (qamuti) laden with
meat inside the igloo. The
meat used to be cut up imme¬
diately after the kill and soon
froze on the way back. Thus
we would have a supply of
good fresh food. We usually
ate it raw because the oil lamp
(qulliq) cooked things only very
slowly.
When we gave up the igloo
and moved back into our tent,
it felt warm and seemed very
light, and life was quiet and
peaceful.

How we travelled
Leaving the village, we used
to follow the Payne river
upstream. Accidents sometimes
happened. I remember Sarah
Attasi being pulled out of
the boat (umiak) by the rope
with which the dogs towed the
boat along the river bank. The
dogs were pulling the boat
near to the bank and Sarah
was helping them when the
rope got caught in the rocks
and pulled her in. My father
began shouting "She is dead".
The journeys were often very
difficult, especially when we
were passing upstream through
the rapids. The dogs would
pull the boat with long ropes,
a woman going ahead to guide
them. The men would look
after the boat. The passengers
were not allowed to move. The
men rowed and the man at the
tiller had to be very careful.
I recall another accident. The
boat was holed and the peo¬
ple in it were drowned. Two
of them, an old man and his
wife, were washed away and
the stream carried their bodies
right from the headwaters of
the Payne river back to the
village.
Mary Taqullk
preparing
for the long winter
in days gone by
SHELTER: People used to live
in tents made of skin from the
springtime until late autumn.
After hunting and fishing, they
would return to Payne Bay in
autumn but would leave again
for their camp in the winter.
They would use their tents until
there was enough snow to
build an igloo, putting up a
wall of snow round them until
the snow was deep enough to
cut blocks out of it.
FOOD: After the summer hunt¬
ing and fishing, the food was
put in store. Seal meat was
placed in balloon-shaped bags
of sealskin (purtaq) from which
the fur had been removed.
These were left on the spot
and covered with rocks, and
when the men or the dogs
needed food in the winter
they would go out by dog-
sleigh to fetch it. It was
impossible to transport all the
fish and game taken during
the summer to the winter
camp as families travelled
from summer to winter quar¬
ters by boat (umiak). The food
consisted of dried and frozen
fish, walrus, whale and seal
meat. Shellfish were a fa¬
vourite food in summer.
FUEL: In addition to wood,
seal oil (ursuq) and various
mosses were used for lighting
the stove. They were stocked
up in the autumn, like food.
Brushwood was gathered be¬
fore the snow fell. Fuel was
needed every day for heating
and cooking.
TRANSPORT: The traditional
umiak of wood and skins was
replaced by a more modern
all-wooden boat. The umiak
was only used in summer and
a family rich enough to own
one would invite another family
to use it to return to winter
camp (it could carry about ten
people).
CLOTHING: Autumn was a
very busy season for the wom¬
enfolk,, who had to sew all
the winter clothes for their
husbands and children: mittens,
atigi (warm jacket), coats of
caribou or sealskin or eider¬
down-stuffed coats, sealskin
boots, trousers. All this sewing
was done in addition to the
usual daily chores of cooking.
collecting firewood and looking
after the children.
HOUSEHOLD EQUIPMENT:
This consisted of a soapstone
lamp (qulliq), lamp oil, rlintstone
(kasuk), dried moss, sufficient
sealskins to make the harness
for the dog-sleigh, a wooden
platform on which the bed was
placed in the houses and hunt¬
ing igloos, crockery and uten¬
sils.
TEMPERATURE: A sharp eye
should be kept on the weather
to see if it is suitable for hunt¬
ing, gathering fuel etc. Check
the weather very early in the
morning.
FISHING TACKLE, WEAPONS:
The hunter needs to have all
his equipment in good order
and ready for use. He makes
fishing-spears (kakivak) sledges
and a canoe (kayak), and
cleans his gun. He makes a
white screen out of a piece of
cotton or skin, stretched over
a wooden frame for seal-hunt¬
ing, to conceal him from his
prey. He gets his cartridges
ready. Before guns came into
use, hunters used to have to
make their bows and arrows
and harpoons. The hunter
always needs to carry a knife
and a bag with him.
SEAL HUNTING: The hunter
may be hunting the seal single-
handed on the ice. He climbs
a hill to see if there are seals
around. If there are, he sets
off with his dogs, taking with
him a youngster to hold off

the dogs while he tries to kill
the seal. After the kill, he
signals to the youngster to
bring up the sledge. If they
suspect there are other seals in
the neighbourhood, the young¬
ster will stay in the background
and try to calm the dogs.
FISHING IN WINTER: Fishing
Is done through the ice with
a hook and line. One can also
build a stone dam (saput); the
fish then group together and
can be speared with the
kakivak.
FISHING IN SUMMER: Nets
are used, and must be placed
in a certain way if the catch
is to be a good one. They
should not be stretched too
tight, they must be kept clear
of waterweeds and must not
be placed in deep water where
it is difficult to net fish.
TRAPPING: Both men and
women set traps. A good catch
depends on having a good
technique. The trap must be
covered over with soft moss,
not too thickly or the moss
will get caught while the fox
escapes. The scrap of meat
or rotten eggs that are put in
the trap should not be too big
or the fox will be able to bite
them without getting caught.
The direction of the wind is
important: If the trap is up¬
wind from the fox, it will be
attracted by the smell and go
straight towards the trap.
Young boys also set traps.
It is always a red-letter day
when a catch is made as the
proceeds of the sale can be
used to buy tools or hunting
weapons.
FAMINE: When food is short,
families count on one another's
help. Those who have a little
food share it with their neigh¬
bours. People still remember
particularly difficult years when
families broke up and went
their separate ways to avoid
running out of food.

How to build
an igloo in a storm
You need to know quite a lot
to build an igloo. We used to
build shelters for ourselyes
when we travelled with dogs
and we still build them even
now when we travel with snow¬
mobiles.
It's dangerous when the
snow is falling and the wind
blowing at the same time. The
igloo may be buried or you may
lose your way. You must stop
and think where to build and
you must choose the right spot,
otherwise the igloo may be
blown away or covered with
snow.
Nowadays we use fast snow¬
mobiles which can get. us back
to the village quickly, if all
goes well, but you have to
learn to take precautions just
in case.
You put a canvas screen
upwind from the igloo; if you
haven't got a screen, you can
use blocks of snow. Soft snow
is soon blown away and you
cannot build with it. It is diffi¬
cult to breathe inside the igloo
when there is no wind. You
should also be wary of freezing
snow. When it is very cold
and the igloo is on too high
ground, the snow can easily be
blown away.
If there is no good snow
about, you have to build an
igloo with whatever you can
find. The best snow for build¬
ing igloos is shiny, with crystal¬
lized snowflakes on its surface,
looking as if rain had fallen on
it. This is good snow; it looks
the same on top and under¬
neath. It is neither too soft nor
too hard.
There 'are no trees here and
you. must be very careful when
you go out hunting. If you are
going to be away for more than
a day, if you cannot get back
to the village and a storm is in
the offing, you must size up
the situation very carefully.
Every minute counts when
snow is falling, the northeast
wind is blowing and dark
clouds are building up.
If you are making an igloo
during a snowstorm and you
see the snow piling up around
the igloo, it is a danger signal,
especially if you have only just
started building. This has hap¬
pened to me twice. When the
fresh snow covers the igloo
you must abandon it and find
another place to build a shelter.
My brother used to go with
me and I was careful not to
let him out of my sight. I
used to call him so that we
did not get separated. If you
cannot make yourself heard, it
Is better to call the dogs since
they have very good hearing.
This was how I found where
I was when I called to my
dogs for help. It is a good
idea to carry some reserves
in case of a sudden storm.
You must also look after the
snowmobile. When we used
to have dog sleighs, we built
a platform with blocks of snow
and put the qamuti (sledge) on
it out of reach of the dogs,
which would otherwise eat the
harness. A snowmobile can
get buried under the snow, and
it is also very heavy to lift.
Before leaving the village,
make sure you have a knife
and a screen. Without these
implements, a hunter can freeze
to death or get frostbite in his
feet if his snowmobile breaks
down a long way from the
village.
When the Igloo is finished,
you still need to protect your¬
self. Just coming into the
igloo from the cold immediately
makes you feel warm, but if
you have no sleeping bag or
heater it starts to feel very
cold inside at night. When this
happens, you must keep mov¬
ing about. You should dig
a hole in the snow and put
your feet in the hole, keeping
your boots on to prevent frost¬
bite. You must also find
something to sit. on so that
your clothes do not get wet.
I was taught how to get
around and how to build a
shelter. I watched others do it
and I did it myself. You should
try to do things that are worth
doing. I say these things so
that the young people should
know about them. What I am
saying will help them when
they hear others talk about
these things or have to do
them themselves. They may
seem hard to believe at first,
but when you try them out,
you will find that they are
useful, particularly during our
coldest months, December,
January and February.

The state of the ice
in autumn
You should know that In the
old days, when the dogs were
crossing dangerous ice, it was
easy to turn around and go
back. In the daytime you could
tell by the dogs what state the
ice was in. Nowadays, the
snowmobile keeps straight on
and there Is no means of know¬
ing whether the ice is dan¬
gerous or not.
When you see small snow-
flakes on the surface of the
Ice it means that this is Ice
which has only just frozen and
which is not yet very solid.
So it Is dangerous. You some¬
times also see a sort of snow
mixed with water.
You should never walk on
new ice. Lakes sometimes
seem to be frozen hard, but
the ice may be very thin In
the middle. There is no dan¬
ger near the shores of the
lake: the water begins to
freeze around the edges and
the Ice gradually spreads
towards the middle of the lake.

Dangers of the ice
in springtime
There are several signs
which warn you that the spring
Ice is dangerous. These are
some of the signs you will
see on lakes and rivers. Be¬
ware of holes filled with
soft snow, which forms little
bubbles. Melting ice is also
dangerous. The ice sometimes
looks firm underneath a layer
of snow but the snow may
conceal a hole.
Lakes which are in the lee
of mountains often have holes
filled with soft snow.
When you want to walk on
a lake, it is best to keep at
first by the shore where the
snow is piled up. Ice and
snow float better where the
snow on the shore of the lake
is deep.
Zacharlssle Tarqlaplk
Building a kayak
It takes four weeks to build
a new kayak, including the time
needed for sewing the skins.
Four large seal skins are need¬
ed for a large kayak. The
finished boat is heavy and
two men are needed to carry
it down to the water. The
people of the interior used to
use a kayak made of wood
and caribou skin. It was light
enough to be carried by one
man.
Tumasl Kallak
Fishing
Put a piece of tunu (caribou
meat), fat or guts of fish on
the end of the line to attract
the fish. You can also use
a piece of white cotton.
The bait should not be attach¬
ed too firmly or the fish will
not bite.

Gathering shellfish
in winter
The fisherman makes a hole
in the ice and slips down
through iL At low tide, it is
possible to crawl along under
the ice. You take a lamp with
you and in this way you can
gather the shellfish from the
rocks. Sometimes there is no
need to make a hole, as the
cracks in the ice are big
enough for a man to pass
through.
This is a very dangerous
way of collecting shellfish.
Fishermen have sometimes
been unable to find the hole
where they came in and have
been caught under the thick
ice as the tide rose.

Hunting
Floating ice is sometimes
piled up by currents at the
mouth of the Payne river. One
must be very careful.
When you are going hunting
and you want someone to go
with you, never force anyone
to go. They may agree to it
without really wanting to. So
they may be lazy and careless
during the hunting expedition.
An accident can happen or you
can lose your boat if the per¬
son with you doesn't look after
it properly. This sort of thing
always causes trouble.
A woman can be very useful
if she is used to hunting. She
can do the things that a boy
would do in similar circums¬
tances and she will also learn
to hunt well in addition to
working at home.
When you kill a seal, you
must cut it up immediately and
put the pieces in the boat. If
you get caught in the ice, you
can then easily throw the
pieces overboad. It is also
better to stay within sight of
other boats. If you are in
danger you can easily call for
help.
If you see a seal lying on
the ice with its fur dry, it
means that it is asleep. If Its
fur is wet it Is not asleep and
can see you perfectly well, as
seals have sharp eyesight You
can try to catch it by making
lots of noise.
The mother seal is very dan¬
gerous. It loves and protects
its young. It will attack your
boat if you try to kill the young.
It has very sharp claws.
As they rise to the surface,
big seals make bubbles. Just
before a seal emerges, the ice
moves and you will see two
big bubbles. If you touch the
ice, it will know you are there.
The best thing is to hit it the
moment it appears.
The small seal, known as
tigituraq, Is easier to hunt.
Even if the boat makes a lot
of noise as it runs into the Ice,
these seals are not bothered.
You can try listening for big
seals by holding an oar pushed
through the ice. When you
hear the seal coming towards
the boat, you must circle round
and round the same point. The
seal will then surface for a
second.
Tiriluk seals are often found
on Ice floes around islands at
low tide.
You sometimes see seals on
the ice but you cannot get to
them because too many ice
floes are being carried along
by the current, but you some¬
times also see places which
are not dangerous.
If you find a place where
there ¡s a lot of ice or where
the ice floes are too near to
each other, you can easily pull

away from the shore; when we
used kayaks, it was more diffi¬
cult as the kayak was heavy
and had no motor.
Beware of freezing water.
In autumn sea water Is very
heavy, much heavier than fresh
water would be. When there
is snow on the surface, It looks
as if no snow has fallen. That
is the time to be very careful.
Also, you should not leave
your boat on the ice near the
water's edge, and especially
not at right angles to the sea.
The melting Ice may break and
the boat may slip into the
water. Put it in a safe place.
Ice breaks near the shore.
Before trying to walk on the
ice when you have seen a seal,
you must make sure that the
ice will not break. When there
is not much ice left round
about, what remains will be
brittle.
Take care of your canvas
screen. Do not rest your gun
near the frame. Fire over the
top of the screen because
some seals have very keen
eyesight and you may other¬
wise miss your chance to fire.
If you are walking towards
a seal and you see it move Its
head, you must stop If it starts
to move.
Seals raise their heads when
they are breathing in. They do
not breathe when they are lying
down, just as if they were in
the water.

Hunting the fox
When the hunter goes around
his traps in autumn, he some¬
times sees a fox outside the
trap. If the fox sees the hunter,
the hunter must pretend not
to have seen it so as not to
frighten it away.
If the fox does not see
the hunter coming, the hunter
should hide behind a rock and
whistle. The fox will think it
is a lemming and will come
closer.
If the fox is facing him, the
hunter must stop when the fox
stops, otherwise it will run
away. When a fox is near and
is not looking in the hunter's
direction, the hunter should fire
quickly before the fox sees
him. If you see a fox asleep,
rolled up in a ball, you can get
very close to it.
Saalatl Simionl
Hunting the hare
The hunter can follow the
tracks of hares on the hills.
If the hare is going round one
side of the hill, the hunter can
set off round the other side
and meet it.
If the hare hides among big
rocks to rest, it will stay there
until the hunter sees it When
the hunter approaches, it runs
away. The best thing to do is
to pretend not to see it and to
head off in another direction to
find a good angle from which
to shoot.
Never walk straight towards
a hare. By approaching from
the side, you can get very
close to it. It is possible to
follow the tracks of hare, but
they may go on for a very
long way. It is better to look
elsewhere.
Saalatl Simionl
Hunting the ptarmigan
Walk down wind. If you see
several birds together and they
fly off, you know that they will
settle again. Walk down and
fire. Some of them will fly
away and settle a little further
off. Keep following them down
wind and In this way you can
kill them all.
It is good for children to go
with their parents to hunt the
ptarmigan, but they must stay
well away and be careful.
When the birds hide, you can
follow their tracks.

The diver bird
Old people believe that the
diver bird can tell them certain
things. When the diver is in
the water and moves its body
from side to side to show that
Its feet are pointing in a certain
direction, it is called nulurtutuq,
which means that it is holding
its feet above the water.
You must then look to see
if both its feet are raised: If
so the diver telling you that
it has seen caribou In a certain ,
direction.
The hunter knows that the
caribou are there but still a
long way away If the diver
does not dabble its feet in the
water when it moves them.
This means that the hunter will
reach the spot where the herd
of caribou is in two or three
days.
He sets off straight away and
when he arrives in the area
indicated, he immediately sees
tracks on the ground; he then
follows them in the direction
shown by the diver.
If the diver dabbles its feet
in the water as It moves, then
the hunter knows that the
caribou are nearer.
If you are soon going to
run out of food during the
summer time, the diver appears
to be very sad; it makes a
noise showing that it knows the
people are going to go hungry.
If you see a pair of divers
dancing on the water and
making a lot of noise, it means
you are going to be lucky and
have plenty to eat. They some¬
times even disturb the water
on a very calm lake and this
is an omen for the hunters.

When the diver flies In a
circle and looks as if It is going
to land, this means that there
are caribou nearby but you
cannot see them. If the hunter
has understood this signal from
the diver, he should go to a
nearby hill to spot the caribou.
These things are only of
use to those who know the
habits of the diver.
What I have said is true:
these things have really hap¬
pened.

Hunting expeditions,
yesterday and today
How shall I tell the story?
Perhaps I can tell you what I
know myself, by my own ex¬
perience, things that nobody
else has taught me.
I used to have dogs and a
sledge. I went out in all wea¬
thers. When there was a
snowstorm and I did not know
which way to go, my dogs
would help me. I would simply
give them their head. Left to
itself, a dog will find its own
way, but If the hunter tries to
direct it, the dog will probably
get lost in the snowstorm as
well.
Nowadays we use snow¬
mobiles and we have to be very
careful. There is nothing to
help the driver. I can easily
lose my way If I don't watch
out. I know that some paths
are dangerous. I would have
been very glad If someone else
had warned me about them. A
track leading out of the village
can sometimes become bad and
dangerous, especially in spring-
. time.
Unless I keep an eye on the
weather, I can run Into trouble.
You need plenty of petrol for
the return journey, especially if
it takes longer than the outward
journey.
It would have set my father's
and mother's minds at rest if
I had learned to move around
safely away from the village:
that is what the Inuit think.

Foot races
and bail games
Puvirnituq means stinking
rotten meat (during the hot
summer).
There were several women
who used to travel over the
ice. They used to build their
own igloo. There were also
groups of men who hunted.
They had a dog which used
to smell out the holes in the
ice. The hunters would stick
their harpoons in the hole in
the ice and pile blocks of snow
all around. Then they would
wait all night for the seal to
come up to breathe. Some¬
times they would fall asleep.
The men were so hungry that
they grabbed hunks of meat.
One of them cut his hand
without even feeling it. One
of the hunters who wanted to
keep all the pieces for himself
had nothing at all.
They fed their dogs on a kind
of soup made with seal meat.
One of the hunters was
responsible for warning the
others If the ice started to
break. If it did, they would
set off for the land. The jour¬
ney might take a whole day.
The igloo built on the ice
had a block of ice in place of
a window. This ice came from
a lake which was often far
away. Every time they moved
they took the window with
them but sometimes they forgot
it and they would have to go
back to fetch it.
When they returned to Puvir¬
nituq, the hunters used to
collect whale oil during the
summer. This used to be sent
off to the south. Some hunters
went away to hunt caribou
inland. Those who stayed to
work were taken on by the
whites and were paid a wage;
part of the money was given
to them in the morning and
the rest in the afternoon. A
whole day's wages were called
tatauti.
The various people of Unga-
va the Sirqinirmiut, the Nuna-
miut and the Sinaamiut used
to get together for games.
Some of these people lived on
the coast, some on the main¬
land, and some on the ice.
They used to organize compe¬
titions. Their clothes were
very prettily decorated.
Two of the women folk had
a reputation for embroidering
beautifully ornamented clothes.
They began to sell these to
the Europeans and learned two
words: yes and no.
There used to be foot races
and ball games. To decide
which of the teams should have
the first turn In the team
games, a circle was drawn and
a stake to which was attached
a loop of rope was driven into
the ground. The ball had to
be thrown as high into the air
as possible and had to pass
through the loop.

Into the Soviet
tundra...
by
Vladimir I. Vasilyev
..where learning to lasso
reindeer is an everyday
school subject
Text © Copyright
THE peoples of the north in the
U.S.S.R. have always handed
down their stock-breeding skills from
generation to generation within the
family or the encampment. Young
children were taught the basics of
animal farming, and as they grew older
they learned more advanced methods
and techniques. Studies of this prac¬
tice have led to the idea of a "people's
school" providing vocational training
for young people in the Far North.
The passing on of practical know¬
ledge from parents to children has long
been an integral part of general family
education, in the past the only means
of vocational training.
In czarist Russia schools providing
general education in the districts
VLADIMIR I. VASILYEV is a Soviet historian
and ethnologist who has taken part in 15 ex¬
peditions to the tundra and taiga regions of the
Soviet Far North and East. Author of over
30 studies on the peoples and cultures of these
regions and their present social and economic
development, he is currently engaged on res¬
earch at the Institute of Ethnography of the
U.S.S.Ft. Academy of Sciences.
inhabited by the peoples of the north
were virtually non-existent. Then in the
first years of Soviet rule school build¬
ing began in the Far North and con¬
tinued at a brisk rate. By the end of the
1930s there were 86 day and boarding
schools in four of the seven districts
of the Far North and In' the Murmansk
oblast (administrative region).
In addition to the permanent schools,
mobile schools began to be opened
in the tundra and the taiga forest
regions of Siberia about 40 years ago,
in reindeer breeders' camps, among
fishing communities, and in places
inhabited seasonally by hunters, fisher¬
men and herdsmen. The purpose of
these mobile schools was to provide
education in the native tongues for the
greatest possible number of children,
most of whom at that time shared the
nomadic life of their parents.
This intensive drive to open schools
in the Far North paid dividends. In a
fairly short time schools were available
for all children over the age of seven,
both those living sedentary or semi-
sedentary lives and the nomads. By
about the 1940s this education problem
had been satisfactorily solved in most
districts of the north. (See "Schools
of the Soviet Far North", "Unesco
Courier", June 1972.)
In the years which followed, particu¬
lar attention was devoted to increasing
the number of schools and Improving
teaching methods, specially adapted to
local conditions.
In 1970, the Far North regions had
more than 600 schools of different
types, including primary (four years
of schooling), shortened secondary
(8 years' course) and full secondary
(10 years' course).
These secondary schools provide
training in various occupations such
as reindeer-breeding, fishing, etc., and
the teaching is specially adapted to
farming conditions In the Far North
regions, where reindeer farming is the
chief activity.
The vocational training of children
in the Far North as it exists at present
comprises three main stages:
1) Vocational training for pre-school
children and those in junior classes at*
school (5 to 10 years) generally takes r

place within the family. At this age
toys are the main teaching aids. These
are usually miniature versions of tools
which are (or were) used by adults
in daily life. Among the most common
are bows and arrows, which develop
qualities such as accuracy and visual
judgement. Hunting games such as
throwing the lasso (maoute, chaoute)
develop similar skills. Gradually,
parents see to it that their children
spend less and less time playing.
Games begin to take on a more pract¬
ical character: children use young rein¬
deer as targets for lassoing and prac¬
tise harnessing dogs to small sleighs.
The basic vocational training in the
junior classes consists of energetic
games and sports (especially skiing).
No vocational training is provided in
the primary schools, where all sub
jects are taught in the native languages.
2) The next stage of vocational
training is important because it intro¬
duces the children to the techniques
of fishing, hunting, reindeer-breeding
and other occupations of the Far North.
At this age (11 to 15), the children
familiarize themselves with fishing and
hunting equipment. They are taught
how to look after reindeer, and learn
about the biology of furred animals
and fish. They do jobs on reindeer
farms, working directly with the
reindeer-breeders.
The secondary school in the village
of Novoye Chaplino (Chukotka district)
is a concrete example of the kind of
vocational training courses provided
for the children of the Far North.
Chukchi, Eskimo and Russian children
attend this school, and in recent years
the chief subject taught there has been
the raising of furred animals.
In the two upper classes, two and
three hours respectively were devoted
to this subject each week. Lessons
were also given on a stock-rearing
farm belonging to the local kolkhoz
(collective farm), known as "Zarya
kommunizma" ("the dawn of com¬
munism"), under the direction of the
biology teacher and a specialist in
the breeding of furred animals. Each
pupil looked after two or three animals.
Other schools in the north gear
their education to hunting, fishing or
reindeer-breeding, and some combine
training in a number of these activities.
The secondary school of Laryakskaja
In the district of Khanta-Mansi Is
a case in point: it offers courses in
hunting, fishing and the breeding of

furred animals. Another school, at
Ust'-Belsk in the district of Chukotka,
trains its pupils In fishing, breeding
furred animals and raising reindeer.
At Bajkitski in the Evenk district, the
school provides instruction in hunting
and the breeding of furred animals.
The education provided In each
school is determined by the economic
needs of the local kolkhozes and
sovkhozes (state farms). Particular
care is taken to ensure that the schools
have adequate equipment and are
well-staffed.
In practice, all the reindeer-breeding
instruction is provided by the kolkho¬
zes and the sovkhozes. For example,
at Novoye Chaplino school mentioned
above, the head teacher and the local
kolkhoz arranged for pupils in the
four senior classes whose parents
were members of the farm's reindeer-
breeding sections to work with them
during the summer as apprentice-
herdsmen. A large number of pupils
in schools In the Taimyr district work
during the summer in the fishing
sections of the local kolkhoz, and
LEARNING
BY DOING
In the vast Chukotka dis¬
trict of northern Siberia,
reindeer farming is still
the most important tra¬
ditional occupation of
the native peoples. In the
Soviet Far North the
schools provide special
lessons on the habits of
reindeer (below). But
handling a lasso (left)
needs a high degree of
skill, and there is no real
substitute for practical
experience and guid¬
ance from parents.
during the winter holidays they help
out in partridge rearing.
The family, however, still plays a
key role in vocational training, de¬
pending on the children's ages. Skills
normally acquired within the family
Include: how to use fire-arms, how to
handle draught animals and reindeer
sleighs, how to cure reindeer skins,
make certain kinds of clothes and
prepare food. Not all schools in the
north can yet provide every aspect
of the vocational training described
above, and so the contribution of the
family is still highly Important.
3) During the final stage of vo¬
cational training, teen-agers specialize
in the work they have chosen. After
taking the short course of secondary
education, some pupils choose to con¬
centrate on reindeer-breeding and go
on to attend more advanced courses In
animal farming, which are available in
many districts and in the bigger towns
of the polar region. These schools
train technicians specializing in the
breeding of reindeer and furred
animals. For instance, the Naryan-Mar
^technical school In the Nentsy district
trained 608 students in 14 years,
including 139 Nentsys and 135 Komis.
At the end of the short course of
secondary education (and In some
cases even before), some teenagers
start work immediately in the various
sections of the kolkhozes and sovkho¬
zes, one pupil usually being assigned
to each section.
In the hunting sections, pupils learn
how to set traps, how to skin animals,
how to treat hides, and how to track
animals.
Apprentice fishermen learn all about
the art of fishing: where to fish in
different seasons, how to tell the depth
of the water, and how to forecast the
weather.
In the reindeer-breeding sections,
the pupil learns all about the herds¬
man's job; he is taught about calving
and migrations and how to distinguish
between the different breeds of
reindeer and the various kinds of
pasture. He learns how to build and
repair reindeer sleighs, and how to
train draught reindeer and hunting
dogs. A specialist is responsible for
each pupil throughout the training
period.
Training lasts from one and a half
to two working seasons for fishing and
furred animals and from two to three
years for reindeer-breeding. After this
the pupil becomes a full member of
his section.
Such is the present educational
system in the Far North of the U.S.S.R.
In the future it will, of course, have
to be improved. But generally speaking
this vocational training system meets
current requirements In training the
specialists which are acutely needed
by the farms and communities of the
reindeer-raising economy of the
north.

THE CHANGING CANADIAN ESKIMO
Continued from page 13
saw any explorers or whalers and
some had very infrequent association
with the traders. Historically they
firmly believed that theirs and the
animal life of the hunt was the only
world of man.
This is reflected in the name they
called themselves Inult The People
(the real or only people). The word
Eskimo, meaning "Eaters of Raw
Meat", appears to have originated
from the language of the Algonquin
Indians In Eastern Canada. It was
absorbed into French and was first
used in 1611.
Although early explorers of the
Canadian Arctic had met Eskimos from
time to time over a period of 300 years,
they had few dealings with them.
The people lived in a natural economy,
gaining their food and clothing from
the hunt.
They were sheltered through the
long dark winter in an amazing piece
of architecture the igloo or snow
house; In summer they lived in tents
of seal or caribou skin. There was
some sort of balance with nature and
perhaps the population in those days
was about 20,000 to 25,000, or nearly
one-third more than the present figure
of 15,000.
But there Is no point in idealizing.
Their numbers remained small because
death came often. Eskimos starved,
died by violence, died young. Possi¬
bly they had some of the diseases of
our civilization before we came
arthritis, heart disease, pneumonia,
appendicitis. Life was precarious and
life was relatively simple. Eskimos
had learned to conform to the nomadic
hunters' way of life and the climatic
cycle of the seasons.
They were almost imprisoned in
their Arctic environment. The historian
Arnold Toynbee refers to Eskimos as
one of the arrested civilizations whose
"tour de force" was living and hunting
on or around the shores of the Arctic
seas. This demanded so much of their
energy that none was left to apply to
further advances. The climatic cycle
made them captives of their Arctic
environment.
They had no written . literature or
writing of any sort but they had a
strong cultural heritage in the story,
the folk song, the drum dance. They
had ethics, taboos and philosophies of
social relations which were practical
and effective for the good of all. In
some respects their morality shocked
the newcomers from the south, but it
was a morality born of the Arctic
environment and not Europe's.
In time It was we who changed their
philosophy and brought many tensions
and contradictions to these hardy,
resourceful people. They retained
their sense of humour even In the
extreme adversity that they faced
daily. One of their philosophical or
fatalistic phrases passed down by
generations to today is Ayungamut:
it cannot be helped.
Traditionally, the Eskimo believed
that the amount of game which the
hunter secured depended upon his
relations with the spirits who con¬
trolled the supply of animals. He used
harpoons, fish spears, bird darts and
bows and arrows and could usually
obtain enough food to sustain life.
The primitive weapons did not appre¬
ciably affect wildlife resources as a
whole.
The introduction of the rifle made
it much easier for the hunter to pro¬
vide meat for his family, but it also
put modern weapons Into the hands
of men who killed more than they
needed. Resources on which they had
depended for so long were quickly
depleted. Whales were virtually wiped
out; walrus were slaughtered and
became scarce where they had been
plentiful. The musk oxen were elimi¬
nated from the coastal areas.
By the turn of the century, the
bottom had dropped out of the whaling
market and a new influence came with
the arrival of the traders. Hudson's
Bay Company traders turned their
attention to the fur of the Arctic or
white fox; this luxury fur then became
the principal commodity exchanged by
the Eskimos for food, utensils and
equipment from the south.
The trader was a more permanent
fixture than the whaler; he introduced
the idea of bartering white fox furs
for store goods, and in so doing
prevented the Eskimo from ever again
being totally independent. The luxu¬
ries of store supplies became the
necessities of the home.
The development of the white fox
trade, however, has had both good and
bad effects on the Eskimos. Opinions
differ as to which out-balances the
other. The trade had revolutionized
their way of life and disrupted many
of their traditional habits. The white
fox was prime from November to
April the period when most Eskimos
of the past would be hunting seals at
ESKIMO YOUNGSTERS, like all chil¬
dren, love to play and are especially
good at improvising games with the
simplest of materials. Opposite page,

their breathing holes, the floe-edge,
or at open water leads. The Eskimos
replaced "bannock" made of flour for
some of their customary foods like
seal meat and developed a taste for
tea, sweets and tobacco.
The white fox, before the advent of
the white man, was perhaps the most
useless animal in the country. The
primitive Eskimo seldom used the pelt
because it was not strong and durable
like the seal, the polar bear or the
caribou. It did not have layers of fat
common to other Arctic animals with
the result that the flesh was seldom
eaten.
The Eskimo did not entirely give up
his seal hunting practices to trap
foxes; he only interrupted them during
the short trapping season. The tran¬
sition from a hunting economy to
trapping and hunting was much the
same as when our ancestors turned
from hunting to agriculture and indus¬
try to obtain a better and easier way
of life with many amenities resulting
from the change.
From roughly the early years of
this century onward to World War II,
the allure of the new goods offered
by the fur trade gradually enmeshed
the Eskimos in a new economy and
with it came the breakdown of a very
ancient way of life. This influence was
widespread in varying degrees over a
million square miles of Arctic territory.
However, until the world conflict
Canadian Eskimos still lived a fairly
primitive nomadic life in a remote,
sparsely populated country.
The war and the rapid development
of long-range air travel broke down
the isolation of the Arctic. Defence,
meteorological and radio stations were
established at a number of places.
The situation of the Eskimo people
became a matter of concern to the
Canadian public.
A high incidence of tuberculosis
was discovered among the Eskimos,
and epidemics of other diseases
followed the greater contact with men
from the south. The white fox market
collapsed in 1949, creating serious
hardship, and brought a rather belated
realization that the Eskimos could no
longer be treated as an isolated group.
Steps would have to be taken to
prepare them to take their place in a
changing Arctic and eventually to be
integrated into the Canadian economy.
With this inevitable change the Eski¬
mos had three great needs health,
education and an economy that would
support them.
One essential fact of the Canadian
Arctic In the mid-twentieth century
was that change had come and come
irrevocably. Another essential fact Is
that the Arctic as it was in the early
1950s had to change again unless
the Eskimos were to be condemned to
slow exinctlon or permanent economic
and social serfdom.
The land would no longer support
them. The caribou had declined alarm¬
ingly from about 600,000 to around
175,000 In the five years from the end
of the war to 1950. The white fox, sole
Eskimo source of income, had dropped
from $30 or more to about $5. The
cost of store goods was rising.
The Eskimos had learned to read
and write using a simple syllabic script,
but their source of reading was mostly
religious material. In the English or
French language they were 95 per cent
illiterate. One in eight had active
tuberculosis. This was the early 1950s
and as the world was becoming more
and more conscious of the needs of
the developing nations, Canada was
becoming equally conscious of the
needs of its first Arctic citizens, the
Eskimos. The jet age broke down
barriers of distance and the isolation
of an almost stone-age people.
In the past decade great progress
has been made in health care and all
Eskimos now have regular medical
examinations. Tuberculosis is a conti¬
nuing problem and although they are
building up an immunity to other
diseases introduced from the south
they are still subject to many of these.
One of the latest efforts made to
raise the standard of living for Eski¬
mos and combat the adversities of a
harsh environment was the federal
government's approval in 1965 of a
five-year rental housing programme.
The aim was to provide suitable living
accommodation to all Eskimos in the
north according to family size and at
a rent based on family economy and
resources. The nomadic igloo-tent life
of the Eskimos is now changing to a
community one.
One of the cornerstones of any
framework of a positive social and
economic structure is, of course, edu¬
cation. At the mid-century mark of
1950, out of an Eskimo population of
approximately 9,000 in the Northwest
Territories, only 120 Eskimo children
went full time to school.
No Eskimos had reached matricu¬
lation, none had received a vocational
training course, none could aspire to
a job higher than trapping for the
white man or being his interpreter. ^

LNo intellectual attainment or career
appeared open to the Eskimo people.
Prior to this time many of the
missionaries conducted classes in
association with their missionary acti¬
vities. However, the percentage of
children receiving any formal educa¬
tion was small when the federal
system got underway around 1950.
Additional schools or classrooms were
built in the north each year. Today,
after a short span of 20 years, over
90 per cent of all school-age children
are attending school regularly.
The government is attempting to
provide a system which will give the
Eskimo people equality of educational
opportunities with other Canadians.
The language barrier and the problems
of cultural dissimilarities have made it
difficult to develop satisfactory curri¬
cula.
The language chosen for the me¬
dium of instruction is English. In the
lower grades, Eskimo teacher assistants
ease beginners into school routine and
help bridge the cultural gap.
The development of the north
requires skilled technical labour.
Southern labour has been difficult to
recruit and hold in the remote and
harsh environment. Throughout the
north, Eskimo men are being trained at
various levels as miners, heavy equip¬
ment operators, plumbers, carpenters
and mechanics. They hold positions
as interpreters and clerks in retail and
co-operative stores and in government
offices. The government has set a
desirable objective to fill 75 per cent of
northern government positions with
local residents by 1977.
Young Eskimo girls are learning to
become teachers, hairdressers, nurses'
aides and commercial cooks. They
learn the techniques of homemaking
in modern housing in home economic
laboratories in nine Arctic communi¬
ties. Their classes Include home
management, child care, home nursing,
nutrition and clothing. These courses
are also available to adults with little
or no formal education.
There are many aspects to the
education programme and one of the
most important Is adult education
which, briefly, offers adults regardless
of age or academic qualifications an
opportunity to acquire new skills. It is
also designed to inform the older
generation who may feel themselves
cut off from their children in school.
Eskimos are already involved in the
search for and development of the
mineral and oil wealth of the north,
and a number have completed an oil-
well drilling course in Alberta, and are
now working in the High Arctic, in the
oil Industry. There is no doubt that
the lives of many more Eskimos will
change even more in the years imme¬
diately ahead as the accelerated pace
of mineral development takes place.
But all Eskimos will not be miners.
As Canadians, many will choose to
live in the south. With education
comes mobility and with mobility comes
32
choice. This should be the ultimate
objective of government policy to
provide a framework within which the
Eskimo people may independently
choose for themselves what kind of life
they want to live and where they want
to live It.
For the traditional Eskimo there
was but one choice to live off the
land, to move where the game was.
For the Eskimo of today the options
have increased from living off the land
to accepting wage employment of
some sort at the settlement and
adjusting to the routine of settlement
life. But the options are still limited.
The hunting and trapping economy
or the renewable resources of the
north have always been limited in
relation to outside markets rather than
to the very much smaller local require¬
ments. It would seem that within the
2.6 million square kilometres of the
north and along the thousands of kilo¬
metres of coastline, there are certainly
enough resources and potential re¬
sources to support a larger local
population. This depends largely on
locating the resources and improving
the methods of harvesting them.
One traditional activity that is still
popular is the hunting of seals. This
provides food and cash for the skins
and confers prestige on the hunter,
which Is equally Important at this stage
of cultural change when the dominant
figure in the Eskimo way of life is
being threatened in so many ways.
Associated with seal hunting is the
trapping of the white fox. Although
the number of trappers .will no doubt
decline as more and more turn to
other forms of wage employment,
there will always be those who prefer
to trap as long as there is a demand
for white fox furs. Our estimation is
that there are still about 1,000 families
spread over a vast area who continue
by choice and circumstances to live
by a hunting and trapping economy.
Many of these people derive their
main cash income from the sale of
seal and fox skins.
Hunting, trapping and fishing are
closely related to tourist promotion
programmes Involving Eskimos as
guides and operators of sports lodges.
The scenic and rugged beauty of the
Arctic and the fish and game attract an
increasing number of visitors to nor¬
thern Canada each year.
Probably one of the most demand¬
ing adjustments and changes in the
Eskimo way of life in recent years is
urbanization. Today more and more
families are leaving their small scatter¬
ed family camps and are settling In
concentrated communities designed
on the model of southern Canadian
towns.
The trading post" has become a
general store and isolated settlements
are organized communities in a nor¬
thern setting. This has led to a more
sedentary way of life with all the
amenities of a town such as municipal
services, co-operative stores, schools,
nursing stations or hospitals, churches.

good housing, opportunities of wage
employment and other facilities for an
active social life within the established
town. The growth of these communi¬
ties, although bringing much that is
good, has also meant a radical social
adjustment for the Eskimo nomad now
turned townsman.
Accustomed to the unscheduled and
independent life of the camp, some of
those employed find it difficult to
comply with certain work regulations
and the discipline of a nine to five
day. The head of the family who
continues to hunt and trap may travel
on a skidoo [small motorized sledge]
instead of by the traditional dog team.
He leaves his family in their permanent
home and covers his trapline, ranging
farther afield than in times past.
Many people today still have roman¬
tic ideas about Eskimos: that they
live in snow houses, eat raw meat and
are pleasantly smiling, quaint people.
This view is a particular weakness of
writers prone to sensationalism after a
week-end's visit to the Arctic.
It seems to me that in all the contro¬
versial material written about the
Canadian Eskimo people today (much
of it ill-informed and much overly
sentimental) there is a tendency to
forget that Eskimos are not quaint
curiosities. They are ordinary human
beings living in a special environment.
Even with the transition and cultural
clashes of change they share much of
the same fears and hopes of mankind,
and as Canadians today in democratic
society they are expressing themselves.
There are many people who believe
that the Eskimo should remain in a
primitive state, and government plans
for these people are often questioned.
I think it is obvious, as Knud Ras-
mussen, one of the greatest authorities
on the Eskimos, said, that "when the
hand of civilization touches a primitive
people anywhere there is no turning
back". Therefore the benefits of accu¬
mulated human knowledge should be
made available to all people as widely
as possible.
Another question often raised Is:
are people better off if they have
more material possessions, educa¬
tion, increased life expectancy, better
health, more help in adversity? The
answer can only be yes, because
these things are the material objects
as distinct from the spiritual objects
of human aspiration and these are the
areas in which are framed our con¬
crete concepts of good, of morals and
law.
The core of the problem, however,
lies in the concept of northern dev¬
elopment itself. The development of
the north is a historical process which
began in the past and is continuing
into an unforeseeable future. For eco¬
nomic reasons alone, this process
cannot be reversed. But there is an
equally important aspect the people.
Pockets of human neglect are no more
acceptable than are pockets of econo¬
mic neglect. The responsibility of
society must express itself both in
terms of resources and of people.
In the north, the irony of the situa¬
tion is that resource development is
not only the prerequisite for human
development but also the major threat
to social responsibility. The po¬
tential of the land is being developed
by means of the best that modern
technology has to offer.
Where does this leave the people
directly affected by such develop¬
ment? The concept of social respon¬
sibility precludes leaving the Eskimos
to their traditional pursuits, a very
unromantic life, regardless of the
romantic picture that has been drawn
by those who are blind to its hard¬
ships, its disease, the tragedy of death
at a young age. Such attitudes would
condemn them to nothing more than
gradual extinction in the face of a
technologically superior society from
which they are excluded.
The only course open is one which,
in some way, fulfils the social respon¬
sibility in terms of the hard facts of
economic development. To be a vital
part of society jnvolves more than
becoming a cog in a machine. It invol¬
ves the concept of cultural Identity and
without this identity a large part of
the human value of the nation is lost.
It cannot function if it bears no rela¬
tion to the economic realities of
Canadian life which surround it.

A Statement on Israel by Amadou Mahtar M'Bow
Director-General of Unesco
R
eports carried by press, radio
and television on recent deci¬
sions by the eighteenth ses¬
sion of the General Conference
of Unesco concerning Israel have frequently been lacking
in accuracy and even objectivity.
Two resolutions adopted by the General Conference
chiefly concern Israel: the first refers to the composition
of regional groups set up within the Organization; the second
refers to the protection and preservation of the cultural
heritage in Jerusalem.
Because the resolution defining regions with a view
to carrying out activities of a regional character has been
interpreted incompletely or incorrectly, it- has been main¬
tained that Israel has been excluded from Unesco or denied
the possibility of participating in Its activities.
Israel has neither been ousted from Unesco nor from any
regional group within the Organization. Israel continues
to be a member of Unesco, as one of the 135 Member States,
which make up the Organization.
Israel also continues to be listed, for elections to the Exec¬
utive Board, in Group I (Western Europe) onthesamefooting
as Australia, Canada, the United States of America and New
Zealand, which are situated geographically outside of
Europe.
During the eighteenth session of the General Conference,
Israel, like Canada and the United States of America, intro¬
duced a draft resolution with a view to being included
"in the list of countries entitled to participate in the Euro¬
pean regional activities in which the representative character
of States is an important factor." While the resolutions
referring to Canada and the United States were adopted,
the one tabled by Israel was rejected by the General Con¬
ference, that is, by the duly accredited representatives of
the governments of the Member States of Unesco.
Thus, Israel is in exactly the same situation it was in prior
to the eighteenth session of the General Conference. It
therefore cannot be argued that It has been ousted from
anything at all ; the only new fact is that Israel is now the
only Member State not to be included in one of the regions
"with a view to the execution of regional activities", since
Australia and New Zealand, at the proposal chiefly of five
Asian countries, have been listed in the Asia and Oceania
group, while Canada and the United States (at their request)
have been listed in the Western European group.
Canada and the United States, I should recall, had requested
unsuccessfullyat the seventeenth session of the General
Conference in.1972 to participate in the Second Conference
of -Ministers of Education of European Member. States.
At that time nobody, either in Canada, or the United States,
much less' in Europe, accused Unesco of having excluded
them from any regional group whatsoever. Thus, these
countries have, like Israel, taken part in the conference held
at Bucharest in December 1973 as observers.. This possibility'
is open at all times to Israel should a ministerial conference'
again be convened in Europe. In the same way, Israel can
participate as an observer, as it has, done In the past, at
any regional conference of ministers no matter where it is
held.
The second resolution "invites the Director-General
to withhold assistance from Israel in the fields of education,
science and culture until such time as it scrupulously respects
the resolutions and decisions" of the Executive Board and
the General Conference.
This resolution Is based essentially on resolutions 2253
of.4 July 1967 and 2254 of 14 July 1967 of the United Nations
General Assembly and resolutions 267 of 3 July 1969 and
298 of 25 September 1971 of the United Nations Security
Council on the status of Jerusalem, as well as on the decisions
of the Unesco General Conference at its fifteenth and seven¬
teenth sessions and of the Unesco Executive Board at
its 82nd, 83rd, 88th, 89th and 90th sessions. When it adopted
a new resolution, the General Conference considered that
the Israeli Government had not heeded the urgent appeals
made to it since 1968 calling on it to "desist from any archaeo¬
logical excavations in the city of Jerusalem and from any
modifications of its features or its cultural and historical
character, particularly with regard to Christian- and Islamic
religious sites." Noting that the excavations and works were
continuing which it considered susceptible of endangering
the Christian and Islamic sites, the. General .Conference
decided six years after Issuing its first notification, to
condemn the attitude of Israel, which It considered "contra¬
dictory to the aims of the Organization as stated in its
Constitution..."
I wish to stress that in reaffirming all the prior resolutions
concerning Jerusalem the General Conference again explicitly
invited the Director-General to " continue his efforts to
establish the effective presence of Unesco in the city of
Jerusalem."
Such are the facts. I hope they will permit the general
public to form a fairer and more accurate opinion of the
resolutions adopted by the General Conference at its eigh¬
teenth session. Similar decisions have been taken in the
past without giving rise to the reactions of these last few
weeks.
There has been reference to the "politization of Unesco",
as if the agencies of the United Nations system had not in
fact been born of a political determination to found a just
and durable peace by contributing to the general progress
of humanity and to strengthening understanding and co¬
operation among all peoples. Unesco is composed of almost
the same Member States as the United Nations. The delegates
to its General Conference are government representatives.
It is therefore natural that the problems which perturb the
world today should find an echo there.
For my own part, as I had occasion to say at the close of
the eighteenth session of the General Conference, I think
that, in an Organization devoted to education, science and
culture, we must avoid those conflicts which take on the
character of systematic confrontations.' We should perhaps
also avoid the adoption of resolutions, even with large
majorities, that could result in deep bitterness in certain
quarters. The golden rule for an organization such as Unesco
should always be the search fora consensus through patient
and, open dialogue.
That is why, as the newly elected Director-General, who
had not taken part in the discussions which went on long
before my election, I indicated to the General Conference
my firm intention If so authorized to speak out henceforth
and whenever it Is necessary, in order to try to reconcile
different points of view so as to reach the widest- possible
agreement.
I therefore regret that on the basis of information which
is to say the least incomplete and often distorted,- certain
eminent persons have thought fit to adopt such uncompro¬
mising attitudes, although thinkers and scholars might be
expected to be more. Inclined to. discussion and dialogue.
I think it is appropriate to recall that for nearly 30 years
Unesco has been engaged in a vast undertaking, in its fields
of competence, with the help of men and women of all ori¬
gins and all creeds for. the good of the international com¬
munity, and that today in the Unesco Secretariat itself men
and women from more than 100 Member States including
Israel are joined in a common effort.
I am firmly convinced that it should always be possible
for Unesco if only interested States agree to workalong with
it to overcome the tensions which hinder International
co-operation and understanding In its fields of competence.
But this presupposes that the norms and rules established
by the Organization should not be considered a dead letter
each time they conflict with specific interests.
