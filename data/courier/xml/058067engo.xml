From Mexico's ancient past
One of the great enigmas of Mexican antiquity is the civilization of the Olmecs which grew and
flourished for 1,600 years (800 B.C. to 800 A.D.) in the coastal regions of the Gulf of Mexico.
The Olmec civilization produced a wealth of artistic works, including monumental sculptures, bas-
reliefs, stone masks and figures and ornaments carved in jade. The Olmecs, whose name means
"people from the country of rubber" (a plant which grew on their lands) evolved a system of
arithmetic, developed hieroglyphic writing and devised a system of reckoning time which became
one of the most accurate calendars known. Worshippers of fire, the dead and an animal god, the
jaguar, the Olmecs were the first to depict the sun in the form of a human head with strands of hair
symbolizing rays of sunlight. This figure of a young man a nobleman or a priest is a detail of
a relief carved on an Olmec altar, from the museum at La Venta, State of Tabasco, Mexico.

THE ARTS
AND MAN
Nine of the world's most respected authorities in the plastic
arts, architecture, the crafts, industrial design, literature,
theatre, cinema and music discuss the rôle and functions of
the arts in society, in a forthcoming Unesco book, "The Arts
and Man". In the article below, d'Arcy Hayman tells why
Unesco has felt the need for a book of this kind which
describes the many functions of the arts, explaining these
functions in terms of the art disciplines, professions, tradi¬
tions and art forms which have evolved throughout man's
history. She quotes salient passages from chapters written
by Sir Herbert Read (U.K.), Pier Luigi Nervi (Italy), Basilio
Uribe (Argentina), Richard Buckminster Fuller (U.S.A.), André
Maurois (France), William W. Melnitz (U.S.A.), Grigory Ko-
zintsev (U.S.S.R.), and Yehudi Menuhin (U.S.A.). On page 15,
we publish the chapter by Mme Kamaladevi Chattopadhyay
on The Crafts as an Embodiment of the Great Folk Tradition.

D'ARCY HAYMAN has been head of the Arts
Education Section, Department of Culture,
Unesco, for the past nine years. Author and
painter, she taught art history, aesthetics and
art education at the University of California,
New York University, and Columbia Univer¬
sity between 1950 and 1960.
INESCO will shortly pub¬
lish an unusual book entitled "The Arts
and Man" (1). It must be understood
at the outset that this is not an "art
book" in the ordinary sense of that
term. What this book ¡s about is that
aspect of man's nature, that facet of
his Intuition and inventiveness which we'
can call the aesthetic realm. This un¬
ique work concerns itself with the arts
inasmuch as they are the natural
manifestation of the human spirit, and
conversely as they provide the forms,
symbols and languages which serve
man in endless ways.
"The Arts and Man" is about the
(1) "The Arts and Man", to be published
shortly by Unesco, has 196 pages, including
64 pages of black and white Illustrations and
20 pages in full colour. Cloth bound, it will
appear in the U.S A. as a co-publication with
Prentice-Hall Inc.; provisional price: $12.95.
(Fuller details will be given In a forthcoming
issue of the "Unesco Courier").
aesthetic nature of man, the aesthetic
sense of men, women, youth and
children, of all nations, socio-economic
and ethnic groups, every human individ¬
ual on this earth. A major objective
of this publication ¡s to give evidence
in words and visual images of the way
¡n which the arts embody the universal
qualities of mankind as well as the
endless individual and cultural differ¬
ences which exist within the family
of man.
The Universal Declaration of Human
Rights affirmed for all mankind by
the General Assembly of the United
Nations states that "Everyone has the
right freely to participate in the cultural
life of the community, to enjoy the
arts." The fundamental need for per¬
sonal involvement in the aesthetic level
of human existence is the underlying
principle on which this right has been
based; it is to this end that Unesco
directs the attention of its world-wide
public to the significant contribution

made by the arts to every part of
man's life.
Unesco's book attempts to analyse
and describe the ways ¡n which the
arts in their various aspects and man¬
ifestations serve the human objective.
At the same time, it is concerned with
making a comprehensible description
of the many functions of the arts, ex¬
plaining these functions in terms of
the art disciplines, professions, tradi¬
tions and art forms which have evolved
throughout man's history.
The book covers a vast area-, it gives
attention to the whole range of arts
disciplines, including drawing, painting,
sculpture, crafts, architecture, indus¬
trial, graphic and environmental design,
literature, theatre, cinema, and music.
It examines and documents these
art areas at many different levels
of production and participation, includ¬
ing that of the professional artist and
consumer and audience for arts, the
art of the child, folk arts, and other
cultural forms
a vital rôle.
in which the arts play
Unesco, which reflects and acts upon
the trends and directions of its 125
member nations, publishes this book
in a time of great change within all
of man's activities. Einstein gave
words and numbers to the cosmic prin¬
ciple: "the only constant is change."
Our own time is marked not only by
constant change, but by what may
some day be seen as a period of
more rapid and profound change than
man has ever before experienced. Let
us consider here a few of the funda¬
mental changes now taking place which
directly affect the arts and man.
. We live ¡n an age of melting fron¬
tiers, of dimming boundary lines; this
¡s true within socio-political contexts
and also applies to nations, religions
and surely to those human disciplines
which for an artificial time in our recent
history have been Isolated one from
the other.
Man has actually made a circular
journey through time; he came from
integrated tribal units in which the
arts and sciences were fundamental
and Inherent qualities of his everyday
life; he went through a time of ever
increasing specialization, compartmen-
talization, in which city-states and then
nations, religious sects and even the
various human disciplines were at
war with one another; and now he
begins to search for ways of find¬
ing a new form of Integration: Inter¬
nationalism, universalism, ecumenism,
interdisciplinary, inter-cultural action.
It is quite obvious that the techno¬
logy of our time, sometimes produced
as the result of certain specialization,
leads us with almost a will of its own
towards generalization. Man intuitive¬
ly accepts the rôle of specialist only
as a transitional measure which will
allow him to make the technology that
will liberate him from the necessity
of doing the repetitive, monotonous

THE ARTS AND MAN (Continued)
A circular journey through time
tasks which until now have kept him
enslaved. The electronic and mass
produced "brain" of the computer, will
(let us hope) allow man to return
to his original rôle of creative, compre¬
hensive thinker.
The arts do not exist ¡n a vacuum:
they reflect and embody even the most
subtle change experienced by man.
New forms of transportation and com¬
munication give to man the power to
penetrate cultural and intellectual bar¬
riers which in other times remained im¬
penetrable by all but a precious few.

[E live in exciting times and
we see amazing things: the young gen¬
eration of artists is especially blessed
by the riches laid at Its feet. Spring¬
ing from Liverpool, the Beatles were
first nourished by American Rock and
Roll and folk music, the source of
which was African and Elizabethan
rhythms and songs Interpreted by
Negro slaves and Ozark mountain
dwellers; then they were touched by
the electronic music and sound of their
time as well as by such ancient class¬
ical musical forms as the Indian Raga.
The resulting music of this young
group as well as of other Inventive
"pop groups" throughout the world to¬
day is often startling, sometimes shock¬
ing, but always rich and rewarding in
its creative Imagination and revolu¬
tionary musical ecumenism.
The new film makers in Czecho¬
slovakia are experimenting with dram¬
atic art forms born of the union be¬
tween the traditional theatre arts and
products of modern technology. Their
recently Invented Polyvlsion produces
its fantastic effects with twelve cinema
projectors and twenty-eight slide pro¬
jectors working simultaneously to pro¬
duce a single image.
The Intricate system of Diopolyecran
involves one hundred and twelve mov¬
able cubes, each cube making use of
two slide projectors simultaneously and
all ¡n all requires five thousand elec¬
tronic signals to operate it each
second.
The Kinoautomat extends its dimen¬
sions to vast audience participation in
the actual creation and direction of
the story or plot of the programme
by taking into consideration the
thoughts, feelings and desires of each
member of the audience attending the
performance. This audience partici¬
pation and direction is made possible
through the use of the computer.
The architects of today are influenc¬
ed by many historical periods and cul¬
tures other than their own, the strong
and monumental styles of feudal Japan,
the ornate and elegant forms of Arabic
architecture, are some of the sources
of inspiration ¡n contemporary Western
architecture.
Structural elements which can be
assembled overnight into such forms
as the geodesic dome reaching the
size of skyscrapers and beyond, point
to new directions and provide solutions
to architectural problems in the Space
Age, at the same time producing radi¬
cal aesthetic change and Innovation.
And the architect himself is chang¬
ing: he can no longer be confined to
the designing of isolated buildings; he
has become concerned again with
man's total environment, expanding
into the fields of city planning and
environmental design.
The painter and sculptor too are
reaching out beyond their canvas
frames and marble blocks. It becomes
ever more difficult to label a work
of art in our time; one can hardly
distinguish between the new three-
dimensional paintings and sculpture,
between walk-In sculptures and archi¬
tecture, or between painting and music,
sculpture and theatre, as the visual
arts take on audio and theatrical di¬
mensions and vice versa. The bound¬
ary lines are dimming, the labels are
fading.
Marshall McLuhan reminds us that
we are entering a "post literate" and
"post linear" stage in our evolution.
As our thought is conditioned, to some
extent, at least, by the medium through
which Information comes to us, we can
quickly see that these multiple visual
¡mages, these inter-media contacts,
these total environments and spontan¬
eous "happenings", make differences
in the way we learn, think and finally
act.
Other changes are taking place
which also affect artists, the arts and
the relationship between these and
what we call the general public, the
consumer, the audience for the arts.
In traditional societies, there is no
separation between the public and the
arts: all members of the tribe or the
village community take part in the
popular theatre, participate ¡n the
dance, sing and play musical instru¬
ments, decorate the home and uten¬
sils. There is no need here for mus¬
eums in which to appreciate the arts,
¡n which to view the arts behind glass
partitions; for art objects are the
objects of everyday use and are famil¬
iar as ceremonial forms and symbolic
images.
In modern technological societies,
man is now searching for ways to re¬
integrate the arts in society, to assoc¬
iate the public more closely with the
cultural life of the community. This is
needed as a result of the long and
artificial separation between the arts
and their public which began with the
age of specialization.
The point at which man finds himself
today ¡s a point of departure. In man's
future home among the stars and
galaxies, his measurements, his hori¬
zon, his entire perspective will be
altered. The universal environment
will bring changes in man's relation
to earth and man's relation to man.
Human communication will become
ever more complex and difficult. Soc¬
ial structures will change and all of
the established human institutions will
be altered in some way.
Because man's aesthetic nature is a
reflection, a manifestation of all of
the other aspects of his personality,
it is especially important that an exa¬
mination now be made of those ways
in which the arts function in the life
of man and contribute to his well-
being and continuing evolution.
|T ¡s ¡n this time of profound
and rapid change in the history of man
that Unesco's book, "The Arts and
Man," ¡s required and issued. It is a
book which speaks about the arts
and man, telling its story in both
verbal and visual images. The words
are spoken by some of the world's
most respected contemporary author¬
ities in the arts and in some cases by
the artists themselves.
Sir Herbert Read, the distinguished
British art historian and critic, who
completed the opening chapter of the
book for Unesco not long before his
death, envisages art and society as
the view that contemporary civilization
¡s ¡n danger of becoming "aesthetical¬
ly impotent" due to "alienation" or the
progressive divorce of human faculties
from natural processes, scientific ra¬
tionalism which tends to destroy the
mysteries of holiness and beauty, and
growing mass systematization which
is Inimical to art, the arts being the
products of individuals.
The author here offers one solution:
"education through art," which recog¬
nizes that art ¡s a binding force in
society, and that the absence of this
element has fatal consequences for
civilization. Sir Herbert says:
yr ". . .Very few philosophers, though
Plato is one of them, have seen
that art and society are inseparable
concepts that society, as a viable
organic entity, is somehow depend¬
ent on art as a binding, fusing
and energizing force. . . Art ¡s
eternally disturbing, permanently
revolutionary. It is so because the
artist, ¡n the degree of his great¬
ness, always confronts the un¬
known, and what he brings back
from that confrontation ¡s a novelty,

a new symbol, a new vision of life,
the outer image of Inward things. . .
I believe that there ¡s only one way
of saving our civilization and that
is by so reforming its constituent
societies that, in the sense of the
phrases already defined, the con¬
crete sensuous phenomena of art
are once more spontaneously
.a. manifested in our daily lives. . ."
Kamaladevl Chattopadhyay, who
once worked with Gandhi and Nehru
to develop India's great Indigenous
arts, speaks of the crafts as the
creation of ordinary people, part of the
flow of events of the common life.
She sees no real dividing line between
the so-called "fine arts" and the crafts,
both being expressions of the human
spirit in material form. Drawing upon
the ancient traditions of the East, she
points out that the craftsman, like any
other artist, is engaged ¡n a total
operation involving the emotions, the
mind and the body, and that he is
seeking rhythm, form and harmony for
life through art (her text appears on
page 15).
Pier Lulgl Nervi, the noted Italian
architect-engineer, speaks of the
architect and his rôle ¡n contemporary
society, and he calls for a return from
what he describes as architectural
discussion and theory, which has little
to do with the physical world and
human need, to the appropriate and
responsible job of the architect: the
art and science of constructing
buildings which are adequate ¡n terms
of durability, beauty and economy.
Nervi says:
"^ "... Architecture ¡s construction
and as such it cannot evade obed¬
ience to all the objective limitations
imposed by the materials it uses
and to those laws, not made by
men, which govern their equilibrium.
Yet I firmly believe that implicit in
this obedience are to be found the
real seriousness and that inde¬
pendence of passing fashion that
have always characterized true
architecture, whether Imposed by
the specific qualities of the marble
in the Greek temples or the massive
brickwork of the Romans, the
delicacy of Gothic, or the great
structural possibilities of the mat¬
erials and techniques of today that
take up so marvellously well the
daunting challenge of the problems
of contemporary social and techni-
^, cal development."

ART
ON THE
MOVE
Photography enabled modern man
to record fixed images of objects,
persons and events to which motion
pictures later restored natural life
and movement. In nature all is
movement and change, and even
a motionless object such as a stone
is subject to the varying interplay
of light. Kinetic art has now taken
its place alongside traditional art,
with its use of mechanical movement
and other elements such as air,
light and water to achieve actual
motion. Analysis of movement, from
that of the stars to a hand using
a tool, offers the artist a new vision
of forms to incorporate in his
compositions. Left, a kinetic work
by the Soviet sculptor, A. Volgulne,

in the establishment of necessary
relationships among the human
environments: technical, economic,
aesthetic, cultural. Uribe points out
that:
"* "... It is customary to speak of
twentieth-century aesthetics in the
same way as we might speak, for
instance, of fourteenth-century
aesthetics, although in fact it is
evident that, in our century, the
whole question has assumed differ¬
ent dimensions. If absolute time
Indeed exists, we are not aware of
it; we apprehend it only ¡n relation
to space.
"As long as man journeyed on
foot or on horseback and the world
could not be encompassed, there
was a sense in which one could
talk about the sensitivity and per¬
ceptivity of a century as a whole;
but things have now changed. Now
that the impact of events is no
longer confined to the region ¡n
which they occur, but is felt simul¬
taneously over the whole face of
the globe, now that traditional
frontiers have been swept away by
artificial satellites circling the earth
every sixty minutes, now that
computers can solve in a moment
equations that once would have
taken more than a lifetime to work
out, what is the sense of talking
about the aesthetics of a period
whose extent can only be defined
in relation to the space that can
be traversed in that time?
"There is no one aesthetic
pattern, no one way of under¬
standing and appreciating the twen¬
tieth-century: the first fifty years of
the century saw many such patterns,
there have been countless others
in the fifteen years or so that have
elapsed between then and now, and
many more will emerge ¡n the years
to come. The aesthetic theories of
yesterday are already out of date,
those of today are born obsolete,
those of tomorrow will cease to
apply even before they emerge."
Richard Buckminster Fuller, the
American designer-philosopher-scien¬
tist-poet, who refuses to be put into
any one professional category and
prefers to be known as a "compre-
hensivist in an age of specialists",
believes that all human beings are born
"artist-scientist-inventors", but that life
progressively squelches the individual's
innate drives and capabilities. He
calls for a new kind of education and
social structure which encourages the
development of man's intuitive-inven¬
tive-aesthetic powers. Richard Buck¬
minster Fuller feels that:
". . . Children are all born with
the equipment and capabilities of
what is called 'genius'. They be¬
come sub-genius or de-geniused by
virtue of the progressive frustrations
of so-called 'growing up' (there
being neither 'up' nor 'down'
directions in the universe!) . . . Aes¬
thetics and intuition are the same
but the first is the subjective and
the second ¡s the objective phase
of the conscious-subconscious,
threshold-crossing, communication
system ...
". . . The artist-scientist-inventors
are the men who have gradually
and now almost completely trans-

formed the environment of man, by
virtue of whose activity about half
of all the problems to be solved to
make 100 per cent of humanity
physically and economically suc¬
cessful, have already been solv¬
ed. .. I intuit that artist-scientist-
inventors who have reached
maturity without critical impairment
of their original faculties will now
become responsible for initiating
and industrializing the remainder of
technology-advancing Inventions,
for realizing the comprehensive
physical and economic success of
world man, and that with universal
abundance, the warring, official and
unofficial, will subside to innocuous
magnitude. With that artist-scien¬
tist-inventors' accomplishment, hu¬
manity may, for the first time ¡n
history, come to know the meaning
of peace . . .
"...At this moment in history,
heretofore preponderantly innocent
and ignorant humanity, operative
only with subconscious success, is
being required by universal evolu¬
tion, and led by the artist-
scientist-inventors, to participate
¡n increasingly conscious degree in
humanity's evolutionary transition
from a very local parasite on the
planet earth to an energy-conserving
Intellectually effective universe
man."
An author read and loved by a public
far beyond his native France, André
Maurois points to the great contribution
made by the literary arts to the life of
man, and demonstrates how the great
authors, poets and playwrights have
provided substance for the imagination,
order for the mind, and a model for
life. In this text which was among the
last words he wrote ¡n his long and
productive life, André Maurois says:
"...The superiority of literature
over reality lies ¡n the fact that a
work of art allows what real life
almost always forbids, that ¡s,
objective contemplation. True, we
men and women of this frenzied
age have, like the heroes of our
novels, lived through war and
peace; we have experienced love,
jealousy and pity; but in what
conditions? Doomed to immediate
action, a prey to anger, fear or
anxiety, we have lived our life
without really understanding ¡t.
We have been constantly goaded
on by the necessity for choice or
action . . .
"...The classical theatre of the
ancients stirred the emotions of all
the citizens of Athens or Rome.
Everyone understood, everyone
recognized himself. Great literature
purified men and made them,
I believe, better . . . Literature makes
Intelligible for us emotions which
are not understood in real life.
"We spend our whole lives along¬
side parents, children, husbands or
wives whom we scarcely know.
Sometimes we imagine we do know
them and suddenly their behaviour
¡n a crisis reveals that our judge¬
ment of them was completely
mistaken. We do not even know
ourselves.
"Reality is shrouded ¡n mist and
eludes our grasp. I turn to analyse
the reflection of some emotion on a
well-loved face, but already that
reflection has vanished like a ripple
on the waters. Our own emotions
are as changing as an April sky.
But a well-constructed novel offers
us characters who, though some¬
times mysterious, are nevertheless
always more intelligible than those
of the real world, because they have
been created by the mind of a man."
William Melnitz, who worked in the
great theatrical movements of Berlin
in the twenties, sees the theatre as a
synthesis of many arts and skills which n
had their origins in the rituals, myths, H
religions, education and entertainment
of all peoples of the earth. Melnitz
puts forth the idea that:

"...The ancient theatre was
exalted because it was Inspired by
religion. The theatre offered an¬
other realm of religious experience
in terms of dramatic art. There are
all /sorts of theatre today, as there
are all sorts of literature. Theatre
has become very powerful in its
Influence on society. The theatre
has always a social function,
whether its apparent purpose be
religious, artistic, educational or
merely commercial. Its social
function is to unite people ¡n a
shared experience. The audience
is as much a part of theatre as are
the play, actors, singers, musicians,
dancers and a place in which to
foregather and share the perform¬
ance. Theatre and society are
firmly wedded . . .
"...Theatre is a complicated
medium; it ¡s an organism that
continually renews Itself ... it should
be ¡n constant confrontation with
modernity. In this respect theatre
creates and reflects the society of
an age . . .
"...Through a hundred centuries
theatre has never died. It will
continue to exist as 'a school of
weeping and of laughter", as Garcia
Lorca so felicitously called ¡t and
"a rostrum where men are free to
expose old and new standards of
conduct, and explain with living
examples the eternal norms of the
j^ heart and feelings of man'."
In the short space of half a century
the cinema has developed from a
simple form of entertainment particu¬
larly marked by its technical novelty
to an art form which, with television,
has become an Integral part of our
culture. This evolution is presented in
a concentrated picture by Grlgory
Kozintsev, the Soviet film maker and
director who has both participated in
it and notably influenced its course.
Kozintsev believes that:
"^ "...while a film is a work of
art, it is not only the artist who
speaks to the audience but one
people which speaks to another.
Akira Kurosawa brought Japan to
Europe; Satyajit Ray has enabled
people in many countries to know
India better. The spectator today
follows a wholly different route.
The film paints a chronicle of the
times People see new generations
arriving and the old fading away,
they see the unravelling of past and
the genesis of future tragedies.
Seeing both themselves and their
age, they come to know more of
ja. both."

in Europe as well as ¡n the U.S.A.,

DREAMS
AND
INVENTION

"Really great artists are scientists and the really great scientists
are artists and both are inventors. I call them artist
scientist-inventors," writes Richard Buckminster Fuller in the
Unesco volume "The Arts and Man." The weJI known American
designer-scientist-philosopher has consistently spoken out against the
divorce of aesthetic intuition and scientific objectivity. His
geodesic dome (above, Buckminster Fuller behind one of these
structures of interlocked curved triangles) has been used for
over 3,000 structures in 50 countries. As an original aesthetic
solution to specific technical problems, it has an ancient counterpart
in the Islamic "stalactite" domes, such as that of the Palace
of Ali Qapu, near Ispahan, Iran (detail left). There, the architect
ingeniously built up a series of small pointed niches to join the
circular ring of the dome to the square shape of the building.
When Buckminster Fuller gives free rein to his intuitions, his vision
transcends the apparent bounds of present-day technology,
as in the case of his "Project for Floating Cloud Structures"
(top left). His photo montage recalls a 1932 work by Belgian
surrealist painter, René Magritte, "Voice of the Wind" (far left),
one of his variations on the theme of the bell.

THE SYMBOL
AND
THE MIND
Not satisfied simply to portray
reality, the artist feels he
must evaluate it and interpret
it for others. Depending on
the era, place, or need, this
interpretation can take infin¬
itely diverse forms as it
seeks to reconcile images
and symbols with cultural
and scientific truths. Left, a

The two-headed
mace of the
Marquesa Islands
In traditional societies, there is no
division between art and the people;
art objects are an intrinsic part of
everyday life and the symbolic
meanings of the forms are familiar
to everyone. The head-mace, left, of
the Marquesa Islands is a striking
example. The head is composed of
two faces back-to-back and is con¬
ceived by the islanders as a micro-
SOLAR EYES: they see in all directions, the three dimensions of
space and the magic dimension of the Mind. Each eye has a head:
the spirit of sight is located in the centre of the power of sight.
NASAL HEAD: a tiny mask emerging from the centre of the face
symbolizing the sense of smell. This is the spirit of odours, which
represent the secret language of the forces of Nature.
MAGIC ARMS: vibratory arms capable of capturing all currents
and fluids of nature. The magic arms or hands direct and canalize
the flow of waves, acting as transformers of energy to meet the q
needs of the Spirit.
MOUTH EYES: a spirit of taste. This taste has eyes and sees as
well as interprets, judges or classifies. It conveys the idea of
conscious contact, assimilating all, revealing all.
THE PEDESTAL or CHIN: symbol of matter, matter in its primeval form,
in the first stage of plasticity, the still raw elements untransformed by
the Spirit. These are the available forces, Beginning and End. Perfect
harmony resides in the dual existence of Beginning and End.

relating the musical elements of

man's heartbeat, breathing, blood
pressure. Thus he illustrates his
thesis that music penetrates directly
to the subconscious mind, and becomes
an immediate revelation requiring little
interpretive effort. Music begins
where words end, it is devotion to the
timeless and" the infinite. Yehudi
Menuhin writes:
"... It is no wonder that ancient
sages sensed music in the move¬
ment of the heavenly spheres.
Thus the fundamental relationship
of one-to-one as man to woman,
or yin to yang, finds its audible
rendering in musical forms: expos¬
ition-recapitulation, a form which
gradually extends around its seed
to produce and embrace a content

"...The more rapid frequencies
find their musical counterpart in
the tidal, as ¡t were, increase and
decrease in volume and in the
contrasting characters of the musi¬
cal elements. The physiological
frequencies of breathing and pulse,
of pressure and relaxation, of work
and rest, find their musical counter¬
part in the basic pulse and counter
rhythms, in the rise and fall of a
phrase and Its interweaving counter¬
point, and in the Increase and
decrease of tension. The faster
frequencies of pitch and the simul¬
taneous sounds and the changing
relationships of notes at different
pitches affect us deeply and
irresistibly as they penetrate and
reveal the subconscious and the
intangible . . .
". . . Man's ultimate leap, when
approaching his God, is through
music; man's ultimate release of
exuberance can again be through
music, from drinking songs to
dances. . .; he falls in love to music.
Music serves the shepherd, as a
companion ¡n his solitude or to
communicate with other shepherds,
as it serves the Tibetan lama, the
sovereign of England, to solemnity
great public ceremonies. . .
"Through music we share and
become part of all great occasions.
We are welded into one group
sharing each other's sense of
sorrow or exhilaration. Music can
also reveal more penetratingly the
nature of peoples alien to each
other: our understanding for
instance of the African temperament
and character has come about more
through their Influence upon our
dally music than through any In¬
tellectual, social or other contact . . .
"...Art is an effort to express
through our senses all that is
within and beyond our reach. Art
is a call, a union like love with
that which, while within and part
of ourselves, is also and by this
same token greater than ourselves.
This ¡s why art and deep religious
feeling have so often been in¬
separable. . .
". . . Our civilization ¡s almost a
vicious circle of which the driving
force is denial denial of the
creative moment, the creative act.
Fig leaves were perhaps the first
such denial and led the way to ever
more elaborate, subtle, tantalizing,
deceptive and sublimating forms of
art and artifice; creative art and
growing consciousness always went
hand in hand, not without some
embarrassment . . .
". . . Until we can restore the
spontaneous elation that comes of
one's efforts with one's own
capacities upon a piece of wood,
a sheet of paper, a length of cloth
or leather, or upon one's own
mind, as does a philosopher, or
upon one's own physique as does
a dancer, until a substantial pro¬
portion of our population is
acquainted with the sensations of
artistic endeavour, we will not
successfully overcome the debase¬
ment of human values."
These are but a few of the Inspired
words that speak from the pages of
this new Unesco book, and there is
more: Three hundred and twenty-five
photographs, some in colour, form a
remarkable collection of visual informa¬
tion about the arts and man.
These illustrations coming from
eighty-five countries offer a continuing
parade of images from Africa, the
Americas, Asia, Europe, the Middle
East, all parts of the world; they make
visible the creative artist at work in
his studio, the performing artist and
the artisan at their craft, as well as
the public which becomes the art
audience, consumer, amateur and
patron of the arts.
The photographs were contributed
to this Unesco publication by some of
the most outstanding photographers of
our time: Edward Steichen, Marvin
Lazarus, Wayne Miller, Hans Namuth,
Gar Lunney, Marc Riboud, Van Lukas,
Dagmar Hochova, K.M. Lee, E. Molnar,
A. Drago, are but a few of the great
names in photography represented.
The pictures in this book tell their
own story about the arts and man.
There is the Peruvian street musician
in affectionate embrace with his harp,
who brings the joy and warmth of his
music to the village square; there are
the two Australian Aboriginal boys
following the tradition of their
ancestors by making drawings in the
sand, and the very young Czecho¬
slovak girl who expresses amazed
delight as the picture she is drawing
reveals some untold wonder to her.

fessional painters ano- sculptors at

Sudan, Mali, Ivory Coast, Ethiopia,

India, Ecuador, and Mexico involved
in the art which has been theirs for
centuries.
There are next the great architectural
monuments of Nubia, of the Incas, of
Cambodia alongside the more humble
but equally beautiful dwellings of the
people of Morocco, Niger, Cameroon,
Malaysia. And too, the works of the
great architects of our own and recent

born of the union between the arts and

The theatre comes to life with scenes
from the traditional dramatic arts of
Chile, Bulgaria, Libya. And then we
are presented with great moments
from the film classics: Griffith's "The
Birth of a Nation", Chaplin's "Modern
Times", Wiene's "The Cabinet of
Dr. Caligari", Kurosawa's "Rashomon",
Fellini's "La Strada", Bergman's "The
Virgin Spring", and we see in other
pictures Buñuel, Truffaut, Satyajit Ray
directing the cinematic works of our
time.
And at last music and dance are
brought to life as we can hear the
Pan Pipers of Bolivia, the Tibetan
trumpets from Nepal, the Gamelan
orchestra of Indonesia, the sitar and
tablas of India and Pakistan, the
Ghanaian drummer, Tyrolean bag¬
pipers, the American negro saxo¬
phonist, the Indonesian Kenong player
and the majestic sound of a full
symphony orchestra in the U.S.S.R.
And we can see the dance in all
aspects of Its glory: the flamenco
dancers of Spain, traditional dances
of Greece, Panama, Senegal, the
Russian ballet, the classical temple
dance of Thailand. And hundreds
more images that fill the eyes and the
mind's ears with the magnificence that
is The Arts and Man.
IHERE have been times and
places in our human history where the
arts were neglected or made so pre¬
cious and remote a commodity that few
were allowed to partake of their riches.
The concept of the arts belonging to an
élite, an aristocratic few who had the
time and the money to spend on life's
luxuries while a mass labour force
performed the "less cultivated tasks"
¡s no longer valid; this attitude is at
the peril of man himself. The arts
belong to all men. If we make them
an arbitrary addendum to life, if we
consider them non-essential, a refine¬
ment only, we lose a great part of that
which makes us human.
The artist's act has moral signifi¬
cance because he not only discovers
reality, but evaluates it, interprets it
for others. The arts are products of
purposive activity, and the artist
accepts the responsibility of affecting
the basic pattern of others' conduct.
To put man in touch with himself,
to make him fully aware of his innate
ethical-aesthetic inclinations at a time
when spontaneous individual decisions
can determine the fate of millions of
lives and perhaps the destiny ' of
mankind, ¡s the urgent and unique task
of the humanities and the arts in our
time. Unesco, dedicated to this task,
is publishing "The Arts and Man."

Craft has always been a basic

considered more cohesive and perm¬

THE CRAFTS (Continued)
When the pot calls the kettle beautiful
handed down cultures still continue to
produce powerful impressions that
seem almost ageless.
The growth of crafts in society was
the sign of the cultivation of sensitivity
and the stirring and mellowing of
humanism. It stood for man's endeav¬
our to bring elegance and grace
into an otherwise harsh and drab
human existence. In fact, man's
elevation from the gross animal
existence ¡s marked by his yearning
for something beyond the satisfaction
of mere creature comforts and needs,
which found natural expression in
crafts.
The most primitive people began to
ornament their articles of everyday
use, later weapons, then their garments
and their own person and surround¬
ings. The rough and severe walls of
their huts became canvases on which
blossomed pictures. A death-dealing
but very strategic item like the bow
and arrow became embellished with
decorations, water pots took on pleas¬
ing shapes and alluring designs were
invented for mundane kitchen pans.
Here we see the transformation of
the mere functional into works of art,
the common becoming the cherished,
the joy giving. Gradually the wall
paintings, the ornamentation of the
floor where one worshipped, perform¬
ed ceremonies or even took food, the
decoration on the doorstep and in
front of the house, all became pur¬
poseful creations, almost ritualistic.
N,
16
I O aspect of life was too in¬
significant or humble to lay claim to
beauty or acquire sanctity as a symbol
of good omen. The use of special
articles for special occasions in the
way of clothes, jewels, vessels, etc., all
of which had to have a certain quality
to ensure a high standard even in daily
life and use, meant a continuous out¬
flow of creatlveness, a sustained
spirit of animation and freshness dis¬
pelling staleness and monotony.
We find, for instance, that in many
countries to give solemnity to certain
things a convention was established
by which they were made into cere¬
monials. The tea ceremony of Japan
is a good example. It requires a
special pavilion offering seclusion
from the bustle of everyday life, in its
own surroundings, and the use of its
own vessels or cups, involving the
manufacture of special pottery.
Though the ideals sought were relax¬
ation, contemplation of beauty and
communion with nature, these alone
were not regarded as giving complete
fulfilment unless they were made part
of one's intimate daily life, hence the
introduction of the tea ceremony.
Where the earth is dry and burns
under voluptuous rays as in deserts,
where life ¡s grim and severe and
resources poor, the people seem to
compensate with riotous colour and
exuberant forms, creating a sense of
luxuriance and plenitude through
their crafts. There is a breathless
eagerness created in the atmosphere,
rapturous vivaciousness in the articles
that are used, a springtime dazzle in
garments and even in the harness and
trappings of domestic animals.
Yet all this mingles with a sense of
repose and stillness as comes at
twilight over the weary earth. The
whirlwind of the sandstorm is temper¬
ed by a kind of midnight calm. For
what takes form in crafts are feelings
actually experienced, not just conjured
up ¡n imagination. For such depth or
vitality cannot be introduced into a
craft form unless it flows from within
as an inner reality.
Craftsmanship, it must be remem¬
bered, is not a matter of mechanical
reproduction. It ¡s creation that is not
divorced from production, where the
designer and the producer are one
unlike studio designing which is
removed from the actual object that is
to be made. In fact one of the allures
of the crafts lies in that as it were
magical involvement of the artisan's
personality with the product from its
inception to Its final application.
One may say that there is no such
thing as craft for craft's sake. It ¡s
not an exercise of the intellect, which
finds a form in a secluded studio to
become the proud possession of an
individual or institution. It arises from
the deeper hunger of humanity, its
functions are socialized for its use and
distributed through the family and even
the entire community. Craft is not
preoccupied with subjective feeling and
thought, but with objectification.
It would need a thesis by itself to
explain man's Innate need for beauty,
the why and wherefore of the pleasure
and satisfaction experienced through
stimulus and response generated by
the sight or touch of certain forms,
the emotions stirred within us by
colours and rhythmic lines that even
in concrete objects seem to flow while
they stand stolidly rooted to the
ground.
Beauty ¡n objects around us provides
visual comfort, equilibrium and relax¬
ation. In craft we have the identific¬
ation of the self with the object not
just a sentimental sympathy because
craft is really an extension of oneself,
growing out of one's physical and
psychological need.
Crafts create an instinctive apprec¬
iation of beauty rather than a self-
conscious striving after it. They call
for as subtle an understanding of
composition as any work of art; the
combined use of form and curves to
advantage; the avoidance of odd or
awkward empty spaces by filling them
up appropriately to contrast with the
more ornamental parts; subtle empha¬
sis on lesser parts to make them stand
out more clearly; and also blending
and highlighting the lustre and mellow¬
ness of light and shade.
Folk craft tries to express something
more than the visible appearance, to
bring out an element which seems to
lurk in the depths of a more significant
reality than facile reproduction. This
is a characteristic of all the old cul¬
tures, frequently dismissed as "fan¬
tasies" and attributed to a lack of
knowledge of perspective and chia¬
roscuro. The fact is overlooked that
oriental crafts, for example, were the
expression of a will, the fulfilment of
a purpose, with none of the nebulous
vagueness that comes of subservience
to a passing mood.
The craftsman seeks rhythm in his
life, colour in his composition and
harmony in his form in order to per¬
fect an object which has a function
and at the same time provides visual
pleasure. Here the material and ex¬
pression move and balance within the
magnetic field of the operation.
c RAFTS have been the indi¬
genous creation of the ordinary people,
a part of the flow of events of the com¬
mon life, not cut off from the main
stream. They grew up in the peace and
seclusion of the countryside, where the
community evolved a culture of its
own out of the steady flow of its own
life and of the nature around it.
The community acted as a single
personality because of its communal
activities, in response to common
occasions and landmarks that stood
out in the flux of time, and the change
of seasons. Out of a million coloured
strands of traditions and memories
filled with song and verse, legends
and myths, fables and local roman¬
ces, from the core and substance of
their daily existence and out of nature's
own rich storehouse, was woven a
refulgent creative and forceful culture.
This was the issue of an unhurried
rhythm of life and a spell of serenity,
as contrasted with the bustle of the
present machine age. Its products had
a vitality and character of their own
in that they were the direct expression
of the craftsman, with a careful em¬
phasis on functional beauty. Yet at
the same time a very significant factor
was the anonymity of the producer, in
striking contrast to the present age of
signatures and publicity. Evidently
the name did not add to the value of
the article and beauty was accepted
as an end ¡n itself, and service to the
community a source of complete satis¬
faction.
What was of great significance in

this context was the status assigned
to and security provided for the
craftsmen, to preserve and provide
continuity to the crafts and save them
from the gnawlngs of anxiety and the
paralysis of insecurity. A craft-orient¬
ed society was based on personal
relationships, not contracts and com¬
petition.
Crafts are Imbued with a certain
Idealism not normally associated with
an Industrial pursuit. Craft work is
not just the plying of a trade but
rather a social act. The human touch
does something to the fragments
which are brought together in a craft
where they seem to mingle and cling
together drawn by the magnetism of
love, seeking one another, to give
birth to a new life in a fresh form
unlike the tumult and pressuring
exercised by a powerful machine
where the pieces seem helpless and
lost.'- Thus traditional decorative mo¬
tifs can lend colour and mellowness
to our current existence, otherwise
stern and grim, with its many privations
and denials.
The ancient books of the East say
that when the hands of a craftsman
are engaged in his craft, the act is
always a ceremonial. Tools are but
an extension of the personality of the
craftsman to reach beyond the range
of human limitations.
The craftsman thus combines within
his being the functions of both the
concelver and the executor. He sym¬
bolizes to his society the outward
manifestation of the creative purpose
and the unbroken link in the tradition
that embraces both the producer and
the consumer within the social fabric.
IWO significant characteris¬
tics of crafts are that aesthetics and
function are integrated, and ornamenta¬
tion and decoration are not divorced
from utility. And even where crafts¬
manship is based on tradition, the dan¬
gers of stagnation are minimized by
freeing each productive act from
Imitative intention and linking it with
the stream of life, making it a dynamic
manifestation of man's endeavour to
express universal human emotions
and Interests.
Even though craftsmanship has
always been considered hereditary,
passed on from generation to gener¬
ation, inheritance of actual skills was
not assumed. The emphasis on the
contrary was on proper education and
the right environment for the growing
generation. The young craftsman
learnt in the family workshop as an
apprentice the techniques in their
entirety in direct relation to basic pro¬
duction and problems, primarily by
practice. In fact he was just as much

THE ART
OF AFRICAN
PULLEYS
by Francine N'Diaye
II HE European artists who
"discovered" African art at the turn
of this century, and collectors of
"Negro art," were for long interested
only in the main achievements of Afri¬
can plastic art sculpture and masks.
Only recently has interest been shown
in everyday and household objects
such as boxes for holding cosmetics
or jewellery, cups, different kinds of
vessels, headrests, seats, carved
shutters and doors, jars and pottery.
Such objects are today as eagerly
FRANCINE N'DIAYE, ethnologist and art his¬
torian, Is on the staff of the African Depart¬
ment at the Musée de l'Homme, Paris. A
teacher of art history at the Dakar School of
Arts (Senegal) from 1961 to 1967, she is pre¬
paring a study on weaving loom pulleys from
West Africa in the Musée de l'Homme collec¬

like the highly developed arts of per¬
sonal ornament in tropical Africa, they
bear witness to the elaborate artistic
refinement and taste revealed ¡n the
most commonplace activities of every¬
day life. One example of this new
taste ¡s the large number of collectors
of weaving loom pulleys.
In many West African countries, such
as Mall, the Ivory Coast, Guinea and
Dahomey, the pulleys used by weavers
all have some kind of carving. The
weaving loom pulley, consisting of the
pulley itself, which revolves on an
axle, and its support, has the important
function of alternately raising and
lowering the heddles moved by the
weaver's feet. A small iron ring, a hole
carved in the top of the support, or
a small handle, is used to attach the
pulley to a cross-piece of the loom or
to a branch of the tree that provides
shade for the weaver as he works.
Not only is the support quite un-

THE ART OF AFRICAN PULLEYS (Continued from page 18)
A weaver: 'We cannot live without such beautiful things'
necessary the pulley, a carved fruit-
stone or adapted bobbin, could simply
be suspended by a string from the
frame of the loom but a bulky sup¬
port may be so Inconvenient that the
weaver occasionally uses the bobbin
without it. When the German anthro¬
pologist, Professor Hans Himmelheber,
of Heidelberg University, asked a Guro
weaver from the Ivory Coast why he
still preferred carved pulleys, he re¬
plied: "We cannot live without such
beautiful things."
The craftsman's reply suggests that
the pulley does not have, or no longer
has, a ritual purpose or symbolical
significance. But we know that this
is not the case with the Dogon people
of Mali, whose mythology closely asso¬
ciates weaving with speech. The Do¬
gon name for the pulley is "the hidden
word," because Its rhythmic creaking
recalls the speech of Nommo, the first
manifestation of the spoken word.
(Geneviève Calame-Griaule, in "Ethno¬
logie et Langage, la Parole Chez les
Dogon," Gallimard, Paris, 1965).
Except for one Bambara pulley from
Mali (see page 20, top right), all the
pulleys illustrated in this article come
from the Ivory Coast from the terri¬
tories of the Baule, Guro and Senufo
peoples. Consciously or unconscious¬
ly, Ivory Coast weavers look to pulleys
to provide them not only with aesthe¬
tic pleasure but also with protection.
This assumption is borne out by the
type of carved motifs, borrowed from
traditional religious designs, and by
the twofold meaning of the adjective
"beautiful" (beautiful = good) in most
African languages.
It is probable, however, that since
these humble objects had no precise
religious function, they contributed to
making the vocabulary of forms used
by sculptors relatively more secular (1).
The result is even greater freedom for
the sculptors, whose designs range
from the highly figurative motifs of the
Baule to the highly abstract motifs of
the Bambara. For the functional rea¬
sons already given, there is a clear
preference for long slender shapes in¬
side an isosceles triangle whose base
coincides with that of the support.
Although some examples in ivory are
found among the Guro of the Ivory
Coast and the Ashanti of Ghana, pul¬
ley supports are generally carved from
wood, not by smiths as among the
Dogon of Mali, but by craftsmen expert
in working wood who chiefly make
objects for everyday use such as tool-
handles, pestles, mortars, seats and
spoons.
The Belgian anthropologist, Father P.
Knops, who has studied the work of
Senufo craftsmen during several visits
to West Africa, notes however that
"the weaver has the right to make his
own loom and to decorate the shuttle,
the piece of bone used to separate
the strands, and the pulley."

The hornbill, a bird of the
African savannas, is
designated in Senufo
mythology as one of the
first five living creatures.
The others are the
chameleon, the tortoise, the
snake and the crocodile.
This elegant bird is often
depicted on Senufo pulleys,
sometimes decorated with
ornamental incisions (colour
page opposite), sometimes
in an austerely simple
form (right).

HE same technique is used
as for carving statuettes. The motif
chosen, whether a human or animal
figure or a geometrical form, is roughly
hewn with a broad axe; it is then
shaped with a short-handled adze
which has a long, thin, slightly curved
blade with its end sharpened and flat¬
tened out fanwise. A double-edged
knife is used to chisel the details, such
as fine scarifications, elaborate head¬
dresses reproduced to the last details,
and zigzag lines, that give such charm
to these small objects, which vary ¡n
size from 10 to 20 centimetres.
Rough leaves are used for polish¬
ing, after which the pulley is dyed in
a bath of boiled leaves and smeared
with palm-oil, which gives It Its warm
dark patina. Like all frequently-handled
objects, the pulleys are smooth and
agreeable to the touch, any roughness
or sharp angles having been worn away
by use.
The type of wood used, hardwoods
from the Ivory Coast forest, the quality
of the patina, and the richness of the
ornamentation are features that give
an undeniable unity to the pulleys
studied in this article. A clear dis-

(1) The British ethnologist, William Fagg,
In "The Sculpture of Africa", Thames and
Hudson, London, writes, "No ritual purpose
is ascribed to these pulleys." This opinion
is not entirely shared by Jean Laude, who says
in his book, "Les Arts de l'Afrique Noire",
("Collection Livre de Poche", Librairie Géné¬
rale Française, Pans, 1966) ". . .these objects
are obviously secular, but an interpretation of
their carvings shows that they always have a
certain degree of religious significance."

THE ART OF AFRICAN PULLEYS (Continued)
tinction can however be drawn, if only
in respect of the motifs favoured, bet¬
ween two groups of pulleys: the
Baule and Guro, and the Senufo.
With the former, which owe their
great charm to the extremely fine detail
of the scarifications and the head¬
dresses (see pages 20 and 21), the
carved part above the support ¡s in
most cases clearly separated from it
by a long neck ending either ¡n a small
female or male head, reminiscent of the
statuettes known as waka-sona (por¬
traits made to order or images of the
dead) or sometimes in a cock's head.
The contrasting short compact Baule
pulley (see colour photo page 20, top
left), with its small head, which also
recalls an ancestral portrait and looks
as if it had been added on to the top
of the support, acts as a sculptural link
between the two groups of pulleys.
The same Insertion of the carved
motif Into the support is found in the
Senufo pulley (see page 19). Here, how¬
ever, the vertical line is accentuated
by the pair of horns ¡n the form of
a half-moon rising above the long tri¬
angular face, similar to those of the
small anthropomorphic masks, charged
with spiritual feeling, which are worn
for ritual dances.
The hornbill, symbol of male fertility,
is depicted so frequently and in such
a variety of forms that it appears to
have the same Importance in Senufo
iconography as the ancestral portrait
has for the Baule. In decorating their
pulleys, Baule sculptors also take other
forms and motifs from ritual sculpture,
for example the baboon or the buffalo;
the Guro use the antelope or the ele¬
phant. Some Senufo pulleys are carved
at the top ¡n the form of the waniugo
buffalo mask used in Initiation cere¬
monies. Other pulleys are decorated
with purely geometrical motifs.
The two pulleys which are shown on
page 22 and 23 reveal the visual Imagi¬
nation of the sculptors who have pro¬
duced .two very different versions of
a single theme. The second pulley ¡s
austerely simple, the sculptor having
admirably conveyed the elegance of
the long purely-carved beak; the first
pulley is decorated with lavish orna¬
ments which give life to the surface
without affecting in any way the flow¬
ing proportions.
It might even be argued that respect
for an imposed theme, in this case
the hornbill, and for the stylistic conven¬
tions of the group in which the sculptor
works, far from hampering him, has
given him even greater freedom to
study purely plastic problems and to
work out a strikingly successful
solution.
Weaving loom pulleys are today much
sought after collectors' pieces, but
they should be something more than
that. As profoundly significant exam¬
ples of the re-utilizatlon for purely de¬
corative purposes of motifs that were
originally magical and religious, they
should have pride of place in the
catalogue of themes and styles to be
drawn up for tropical Africa. If this
achieved nothing else, it would at
least preserve for modern craftsman¬
ship the genuine local flavour which
unfortunately is now gradually dis¬
appearing.

loom; below centre, detail of the loom
showing the decorated pulley in place.
The simplicity of the loom four
wooden poles fixed in the ground and

contrasts with the artistic refinement
of the carved pulley. Below right,

In Russia, the Ukraine and
Byelorussia, for centuries
wood was the only available
material for making objects
of everyday life. These
objects range from
monumental sculptural
works to simple household
articles in which the hand
of the craftsman has
integrated beauty with
utility. This head, which
strikingly recalls one of the

UTENSILS
AS WORKS
OF ART
by Veniamin Fabritsky and Igor Shmelyov
VENIAMIN FABRITSKY and IGOR SHMELYOV are Soviet architects
whose designs have gained numerous prizes and awards. In the study
of the ancient art of wood carving they found an absorbing hobby to
which they have devoted many years of research and travel in the
most distant parts of the U.S.S.R. They have described their search
for masterpieces of folk craftsmanship in "Sagas in Wood", a book
published in Russian in the Soviet Union last year.
IN Russia, a land of dense
and boundless forests, wood has
always been the most accessible and
widely used material. And in the hands
of the Russian craftsman, the axe, a
rudimentary tool, becomes endowed
with magical qualities.
In times when saws and nails were
still largely unknown, craftsmen used
the axe to make household objects
embellished with elegant carving and
to hew and shape the solid timber-
work of log cabins as well as palaces
and churches. The skill of the archi¬
tects ¡n integrating these structures Into
the surrounding landscape still amazes
us today.
The art of wood carving goes back
many centuries to the time of the
Eastern Slavs who settled on the banks
of great rivers such as the Dnieper,
the Volga and the Don and around
Lake Urnen in the first millennium A.D.
These peoples deified the primitive
forces of nature. They worshipped
mighty rivers, great mountains and

UTENSILS AS WORKS OF ART (Continued)
The master carvings of the 'Volga Boatmen'
rocks, towering trees, and made
wooden idols with human features. The
walls of their temples were adorned
with wooden figures of human beings,
birds and animals so realistically
portrayed that they seemed to be alive.
Slav pagan religion and mythology
continued to Influence Russian art
down through the centuries. Wooden
vessels of today still resemble the
duck-shaped cups unearthed from an¬
cient sites in the Urals; the traditional
Russian log hut, the izba, is basically
unchanged after hundreds of years;
and the sun, represented as a circle
with a fan-shaped pattern of rays,
remains a widely used motif ¡n wood
carving. Such carvings of the pagan
sun god were once carried as protec¬
tive emblems at the mast-heads of
ships.
Christianity was adopted in Russia
at the end of the 10th century and
brought with it new ¡mages and emo¬
tional qualities to enrich Russian art,
which drew inspiration from the highest
forms of Byzantine culture and assim¬
ilated the artistic heritage of classical
antiquity.
The new works were shorn of all
but essential elements. Background
details were shown as clearly as those
in the foreground. Sculptural works
were characterized by their terseness,
clear cut rhythm and stylized form, and
the central figure was made dispropor¬
tionately large to emphasize its pre¬
eminence and moral status.
These characteristics are seen in the
surviving examples of two types of
13th century monumental wood carv¬
ing: the framework of the iconostasis
and the so-called Ludogoshcha cross.
The 13th century iconostasis (a
screen separating the sanctuary from
the rest of the church) is divided into
rectangles in which reliefs are sculpt¬
ed. The whole composition is austere
and rhythmical; the carved forms
concise, stylized and extraordinarily
impressive.
The Ludogoshcha cross has a most
unusual shape resembling that of a
branchy tree. Bas-reliefs in circular
frames are placed at different levels
on its surface which is covered with

intricate carved patterns that unite the
different ¡mages into an expressive
ensemble.
Both the 13th century iconostasis
carving and the Ludogoshcha cross
are representative of the art of one
of the oldest Russian cities, Great
Novgorod, whose works are distin¬
guished for their strong, clear line and
their monumental yet austere form
and expression.
The people of Novgorod were often
called "the master carpenters", such
was their fame as craftsmen ¡n wood.
All Russia admired their wooden
churches, carved poles, sleighs, boats,
beautiful handmade objects carved in
boxwood and Caucasian walnut, and
the giant oak pipes that served as
water mains. At the end of the 10th
century, the craftsmen of Novgorod
built St. Sophia, a huge wooden cathe¬
dral with 13 belfries.
In the 13th century the Tatar invas¬
ion placed the Russian people under
a yoke they were to endure for 150
years.
In wood carvings of that time saints
are often depicted as inspiring figures;
the most popular were the fiery
Archangel Michael, sword ¡n hand,
and St. George, a courageous, hand¬
some youth in armour and on horse¬
back. Grey-haired St. Nicholas per¬
sonified man at his best wise, kind
and charitable to others.
In 1380, the Russians routed the
Tatars at Kulikovo and drove them
out of Russia. The country rose from
its ruins to begin a new life.
Some 30 years later, Andrei Rub-
lyov, the greatest icon painter of
ancient Russia, created a work that
marked the beginning of a new epoch
in Russian art: the famous "Trinity".
Crystal clear, harmonious and lyrical,
it was a masterpiece that revealed the
very quintessence of human feelings.
Symbols and forms Intended to express
the immutability of religious dogmas
instead reflected, in this profoundly
emotional work of art, the complexity
and diversity of life.
Philosophical content and profound
emotional expression were traits that
Russian art shared with the masterly
Artists and craftsmen of
all periods have used
their art to express the
ideas of their time and
to depict events that
changed the course of
history. In the 15th and
16th centuries, Russia
was striving to weld its
far-flung territories into
a single state. In 1551,
an unknown wood
sculptor decorated the
ceremonial seat of Ivan
the Terrible, in the
Cathedral of the
Assumption, in Moscow,
with scenes depicting a
multitude of events in
Russia's history. Detail,

An outstanding centre of the wood
carver's art in ancient Russia was
Novgorod, from the 9th to the
12th century a dependency of Kiev
and for the next three centuries a
medieval republic Sovereign Great
Novgorod. By the 13th century
its famous craftsmen had developed a
characteristic form of sculptural
wood carving, an austere yet
expressive style that is still evident
in the crosspiece of a crucifix shown
below, carved at Novgorod in the
mid-1 7th century.

compositions of Western Europe, the
frescos and sculptures of India, the
classical landscape paintings of Chi¬
na, the miniatures of the Near and
Middle East, indeed, with all the art
of the Middle Ages.
Within the bounds of medieval
thought and knowledge, wood sculp¬
tors and carvers used their art to
express with tremendous force the
ideals of their time, as well as to
observe and comment on events that
changed the course of history.
The ceremonial seat of Ivan the
Terrible in the Cathedral of the As¬
sumption, in the Kremlin, is an out¬
standing example of 16th century wood
carving, and at the same time its com¬
positions are a record of historical
events compiled at a time when the
vital task facing the country was to
unite all its territories into a single
centralized state. These reliefs are
images from the pages of Russian his¬
tory, depicting among other episodes,
the reception of ambassadors, the con¬
ference between Prince Vladimir Mono-
makh of Kiev and the Boyars, and
Russian cavalry on the move.
Traditions and techniques of sculp¬
ture in wood were passed on from
generation to generation. Northern
Russia became famous for its unique
wood carving which, with Its simple
patterns composed of slanting and
zig-zag lines, triangles, diamonds, ro¬
settes and indentations, perpetuated
the traditions of the art of Great Nov¬
gorod. Architecture in wood, too, was
developed to a remarkable degree ¡n
the north where the Church of the
Transfiguration in Klzhl surmounted by
22 domes still stands as a masterpiece
of design and construction.
Another outstanding centre of the
wood craftsman's art was the Volga
region where the famous "ship carv¬
ing" originated. Initially found only
on the boats which plied the Volga
River, it spread far and wide to adorn
gates, porches, poles and window
mouldings. From its original austere,
geometrical patterns, it evolved into
imaginative, embroidery-like designs
creeping plants, leaves and flowers,
fantastic birds, friendly-looking lions
with splendid manes and flowers in
their tails, mermaids, and herons with
a bunch of grapes in their beak. All
these inspired poems in wood were
executed with superb craftsmanship.
The skill of the carvers, their ability
to conjure the maximum effect from
their material and above all their love
of beauty are clearly evident in the
forms of utensils and other household
objects indispensable to a farming
community.
With their perceptive understanding
of wood and its plastic qualities, these
craftsmen excelled in using to the best
advantage its natural grain and pattern,
and in utilizing roots and knots to
fashion decorative motifs.
Every household article, however
insignificant, was given a distinctive
beauty: distaffs hand painted in bright
colours, heavy benches with carved
backs, boards for making richly
decorated honey cakes and others for
printing colour patterns on fabrics,
finely carved jugs, cups and salt cellars
shaped like boats, ducks or swans.
In this way, even the simplest every¬
day activities fulfilled the purpose of
the craftsman: the integration of beauty
with utility.

NEW SHAPES TO

There was a time when the phrase "mass-produced
object" was synonymous with ugliness, inferior
quality and gimcrack products. In certain cases
it is still true today and the unsightly articles
placed on sale in many countries are sad proof
of this. But more and more, the creative designers
of today are seeking new forms that are both a
joy to the eye and a joy to use. Right, a window
display poster by the German decorative artist
Barbara Brenner of modern Danish cutlery. Japan¬
ese boxwood combs graphically arranged in

them would be a delight. They are modern
products and designs inspired by traditional
Japanese forms and are often used as ornaments
in Japanese coiffures. Above, a sliding door of
original design offers a most unusual perspective
of Japan's great Izumo Shrine. It is the work
of Kiyoshi Awazu, one of Japan's leading creative
designers, who is responsible for the graphic
designing and plans for Expo 70, to be held In
Osaka next year. Top left, an example of sym¬
bolic advertising design by an Italian artist, Franco
Grignani. No effort is made to advertise the
product directly, but instead the design attempts
to catch the viewer's interest by the striking
nature of the graphic construction. The design

THE
CRAFTS
Continued from p. 17
engaged in learning metaphysics and
the true value of things; in short, in
acquiring a culture.
There was no isolation of the school
from the larger life. For in this setting
the child learnt little tasks as part of
the daily routine, picking up skills
even as he did other components of
his way of life. The problems were
real, not make-believe, as the aim of
education was understood to be the
unfolding of the personality to make
for fuller life.
For the quality of inspiration which
transmutes skills and competence can
hardly be taught. It has to be culti¬
vated by experience. This makes for
a very special relationship between the
teacher and the pupil, an intimacy
binding the two. The latter looks up
to the former as the source from which
knowledge is Imbibed, great truths
learnt and Interpreted.
The teacher educates the pupil as
much through his own personal
conduct as through studies, and is
expected to show the same respect
and regard for the pupil as he would
for his own progeny and family.
The sharing of problems and varied
experience is a real contribution
to the enrichment and formation of
the pupil's personality.
In a craft society the master crafts¬
man ¡s also a social leader and an
important entity in the community. The
teacher keeps nothing worthwhile
back as a trade secret from the pupil.
This form of institution makes crafts¬
manship a living thing, giving prestige
and value to sound standards. The
teacher spurs the pupil on to surpass
himself and takes genuine pride in
conceding superiority to the student.
In a society which accepts crafts
and still finds an honoured place for
them, there is a free exchange of
ideas between fine arts and the crafts,
each accepting cues from the other.
Similarly the man of taste is rated as
equally gifted and with the same sens¬
ibility as the man who creates. So
]]>

<![CDATA[
appreciation is in a sense on a par
with creation, because it is felt that
the man of sensitivity participates with
almost the same excitement and
exhilaration when he appreciates as
when he creates. This concept is an
important and Integral part of the craft
world.
Moreover, the Insistence on good
taste ensures a consistently high
standard for all arts and crafts. Even
the common terracotta shows a vigour
of muscle and at the same time a
fluidity of line as if to prove that the
earth is not static but has a dynamic
rhythm realized ¡n a flux through a
continuous process. Craft means
cultivation of an intimacy with human
life and creation, a sympathy for all
living things and the realization of the
fundamental unity of all aspectá of life
though diverse in form.
A, society dominated by me¬
chanical industrialization tends to exalt
efficiency over creative gifts, though
the' latter are rarer and more precious
from the human point of view. Thus
administrative staff enjoy better status,
higher .salaries and are generally
considered more Important than expert
craftsmen.
It must be remembered that over¬
emphasis on techniques that acceler¬
ate speed and swell the quantum of
volume, but are divorced from imagin¬
ation and intellect, can result in the
loss of that exaltation which stimulates
creative activity in craft production.
Similarly the pivotal importance accord¬
ed to facts in education may draw
away all inspiration and leave life too
flat to awaken any sense of wonder
in the young. Such overemphasis can
be just as hard to shake off as the
superstitions of the imagination.
We once believed that a full per¬
sonality is fostered by ideals in relation
to which the course of life is set and
plotted through the observance of
certain disciplines. It may be that
ideals have fewer chances of survival
in an atomic age. Moreover, the
ever-increasing invention of sensitive
machines and instruments places less
and less premium, in a way, on man.
The trend now ¡s to give pre-emin¬
ence to the machine. In a world
where life is being increasingly geared
to predominantly physical targets that
have to be achieved through highly
complicated mechanical processes, the
rôle of man must inevitably necessarily
pale and shrink. He has therefore to
be compensated by artifices.
The modern concept of the build up
of the personality flows largely from a
machine dominated age. Personality
build up today is made into a kind
of a cult. Wide publicity is given to
tips and practical hints towards this
end: wear the right kind of clothes,
have the right make-up for the com¬
plexion, use the right type of perfume
for the evening. Surely, these do not
help the blossoming of a personality.
The more frequent use of automatic
machines curtails the demands on
man. Less and less of him is called
into action. Geared to automation,
human beings must increasingly con¬
form to machines: individual oppor¬
tunities for choice and decision narrow
and, in the ultimate, leave the way
open for the replacement of man by
machine. Large units constantly ex¬
pand into larger ones and the concen¬
tration of machines becomes still
heavier. In this gigantic grind, the
human personality may well be under¬
mined if it is not balanced by an
accompanying pattern of production,
as in the crafts.
One is gradually becoming aware
of a lowering of quality standards in
the current age, compared with the
craft age. People's taste is deter¬
mined more by other opinions, called
"fashions", than by the intrinsic value
or merit of a product. Similarly the
solidity or endurance of a product
becomes a less important factor.
Craftsmanship on the other hand is
more a tribute to the high function of
the human being, who is not just a
physical frame, but is endowed with
creative talents. Society needs
constant reminders of this and of the
corrective and balancing force which
crafts so naturally provide.
The alternative, for the majority of
people, may all too easily be a form
of escapism, a flight from the mono¬
tony and the stifling pressure of mass
production. In such an atmosphere
people tend to become preoccupied
with careers rather than a sense of
mission or service. At the same time
they are readily attracted by anything
that is new and, because of its nov¬
elty, exciting, with little discrimination
or concern for proper values.
' E must not forget that while
science may open up the fourth-dimen¬
sional world, and technology the wide
firmament, the individual in technolo¬
gical society seems to get compressed
as it were into a single dimension.
The responsibility he exercises is
trivial, his power of decision nil. Only
a small part of him operates.
Craftsmanship, on the contrary,
involves the entire person, relating the
mind and the material to a certain
function for a specific purpose. While
the tempo of the craft age gave the
Illusion of timelessness, the current
age rushes on at the astronaut's
speed. It is largely against this back¬
drop that we have to view the value
of crafts and their relation to contem¬
porary society.
Crafts have a special rôle and
significance in the creation of a home
home to mean all that part of one's
environment that is personal and intim¬
ate as distinct from temporary and
utilitarian. When the machine usurps

ESKIMO SCULPTURED MAP
19th century ethnologists discovered
that Eskimos who lived along the east
coast of Greenland had developed
their own wooden relief maps which
not only show the outline of the
coast but the contour of the land, rock
Formations, storage places, and portage
routes for carrying kayaks overland
when ice blocked access to the sea.
The hand carved map, above, shows
the peninsula between the Sermiligak
and Kangerdluarsikajik fjords. Areas
which Eskimo map makers knew well
were often enlarged and shown in
greater detail than lesser known
regions, and islands were carved on
a separate piece of wood and posi¬
tioned alongside the main map to
show offshore areas.

THE CRAFTS (Continued)
Throughout north-eastern
Brazil a popular imagery of
extraordinary richness and
diversity has developed
since the turn of the
century in the form of
block-engraving illustrations
for the covers of modest
booklets of poetry and folk
tales (photo 2). As
spontaneous as the
literature they are helping
to popularize in city suburbs
and villages, the engravings
are the work of anonymous
artists. They show
legendary heroes, scenes
from everyday life, or
fabulous animals such as
the werewolf (1), a
strange "Pegasus" (3),
lizards on their hind legs (4)
or a hallucinating shape,
half-devil, half-animal (5).
The soup's more delicious with a pretty spoon
34
manee, it cannot but reflect on the
intimate environment.
In the furnishing of the home a
direct association with the original and
authentic register a personal impres¬
sion on us, as with an original painting,
a manuscript, a relic, things that a
reproduction cannot equal no matter
how perfect it may be. Here one
senses all the difference between the
work of a master and a machine.
Crafts form part of the daily environ¬
ment and fit ¡n naturally and grace¬
fully in the arrangement of the home.
In upholding crafts one does not
necessarily by implication reject
machines or make an impassioned
plea for a return to hand production.
There is, ¡n fact, a basic relationship
between small tools and large mach¬
ines. Where we take the wrong turn¬
ing is in failing to make the proper
appraisal of and acceptance of the
rôle of each ¡n its own sphere, which
would still leave the community to
make a choice. There would then be
no danger of man being bullied by the
machine.
Tradition respects the natural limits
of craftsmanship and the harmony that
is established between the craftsman,
the materials he uses and his tools.
The pride the craftsman derives from
his creation and the delight in the per¬
fection of his finished product sustain
him. It is this knowledge enshrined in
the crafts that gives them an abiding
place in our social set-up.
The very fact that even in this
growing forest of machines with its
triggery tempo, far from being smoth¬
ered crafts are once more coming into
world focus, is evidence enough that
within us pulsates an innate yearning
to use our hands and to feel the
surface of individually created objects.
c.RAFTS embody certain
qualities and a depth of experience
arising out of direct expression which
¡s very different from studio work.
Craft work is an acknowledged form
of therapy for those who are mentally
unsettled and nervously upset: it is a
source of rhythm and stability in living.
Even hard labour done rhythmically
becomes more bearable.
The problem before us is therefore
not man versus machine but rather
how to promote a harmony and cohes
ion between the two, a regulating of
each in its own appropriate field.
The need for saving and developing
crafts is felt to be vital even by those
who follow or are caught up ¡n other
pursuits. For it enables them to main¬
tain contact with those aspects of our
culture that are characterized by crafts,
and to absorb some of their elegance
and grace.
Crafts are particularly important with
young people for the qualities they
help to develop. For inherent in the
craft tradition are abundant reserves
of sustenance and delight. As long
as crafts continue as living and com¬
pelling witnesses of these cultural
resources, art will remain intimately
connected with the dally usages of
man.
Crafts also have a special vitality
as a direct human answer to direct
human needs. As has been said, the
demand ¡n eating calls as much for
satisfaction from the right kind of
spoon as from the food to be eaten.
Crafts have therefore an Intimate
kinship with and understanding of the
human needs its products serve,
which Induces an intuitive sense going
with rather than against the grain of

life, absent in the assembly line
pattern.
In craftsmanship man is in full control
and can make his own decision at
every point. In large machine estab¬
lishments the workman is likely to be
subjected to the deadness of outward
uniformity and the gnawing pressures
of his inner self seeking release. The
very fact that in the modern highly
sophisticated period a compelling need
is felt to reach back into the remote
past, with its naivety and simplicity, to
try to flood our being with Its springlike
freshness, is a clear demonstration of
this sustaining rôle of crafts.
Under social pressures, the essence
of things gets overlaid by more super¬
ficial layers of modes and manners. It
has been truly said that the virtue of a
plant is in its seed and its form ¡n its
first shoot. Craft is not a disinterested
extraneous function complementary to
life but divorced from the inner being
of the community. Rather it is an
intensification of life, a stirring of the
pulse, a quickening of the heart, a
releasing of the muscle, in short a com¬
pelling and natural mode of expression.
Crafts are not stylized imitations of
nature but actually help to harmonize
life with nature. In a way, they teach
us what to look for and how to see.
Craft forms have roots ¡n the soil as
well as in the imagination of the crafts¬
man. They become a direct and sin¬
cere expression of the character and
life of the people, and therefore speak
a language all their own. As the saying
goes, music is more intelligible to the
musician than speech.
|N the present age where
crafts are exposed to many dangers, a
particular responsibility devolves on
craft lovers. It is significantly said that
the disintegration of a craft-oriented
society is reflected in the disintegration
of its crafts.
Crafts need not, of course, be bound
up exclusively with tradition. For life
is on the move and patterns of living
change with habits and customs. New
relationships are evolved with the
current flow of life and new traditions
created.
But there are certain values indispen¬
sable to mankind which crafts preserve,
and those craftsmen and craft lovers
who draw on this perennial spring of in¬
spiration and experience its unchang¬
ing sense of fulfilment have a precious
charge to keep.
New exchanges are taking place in
many spheres and fresh breezes are
wafted across that touch and transform
worn-out and weary spirits. The long
centuries of political and economic
rule of some regions by others are
giving way to a growing realization of
a common brotherhood and destiny of
mankind.
The less industrially developed areas
have retained more of the craft heri¬
tage along with their other traditions.
As they emerge from the old sup¬
pressions and come to life, these
things slip into proper perspective.
The result is a growing realization of
the significance of their contribution
to the world of culture.
The people of the former ruling
countries too are waking up to a
greater discernment and appreciation
of the gifts and qualities the newly
freed have to offer. Today, much of
the old obtuseness and casualness on
the part of the more industrialized
peoples towards the less industrializ¬
ed nations is giving place to a more
intelligent and sensitive understand¬
ing of the old cultures and traditional
values, and a recognition of the need
for and significance of mutual under¬
standing and appreciation and ex¬
change.
There is also a realization that the
tissues of an older way of life are not
to be swept away like so many cob¬
webs, for to a sympathetic mankind
they reveal untold charms and subtle
and restrained overtones of abiding
value and vibrant meaning.
Anand Kumaraswamy, the great
interpreter of oriental arts and crafts,
says that "years ago, under pre-
industrlal conditions, the public had
perforce to accept good art, good
design, good colouring, because no¬
thing worse was hardly available."

THE CRAFTS (Continued)
36
Now mass production under advanc¬
ed mechanization places the ignorant
and the aesthetically untutored at the
mercy of those who seek larger mar¬
gins of profit.
The time for a choice has come.
Good taste and greater opportunity
to live in intimacy with beauty should
not be the privilege of the few, but
the common inheritance of all. This is
what the crafts have to teach and offer
us. The two paths have already cross¬
ed. Western science is no longer
regarded as just a mechanism but has
acquired also an element of philo¬
sophy.
The rôle of crafts in the economy of
a developing country has become a
subject of world-wide significance.
Economists all over the globe have
directed their vision and experience to
this study. And indeed it is clear that
a sentimental regard for traditionalism
alone will not take us very far in our
effort to give these ancient activities
a modern vitality and meaning.
The modern demand ¡s for beauty
as a supplement to usefulness. Then
again, the concept of usefulness itself
has changed because of the transform¬
ation of our modes of thought, of
living habits and environment. Nor is
there any longer the same fastidious¬
ness for the purity of material or the
authenticity of form. With the advent
of cheap alloys, even for jewellery,
artificial silk and synthetic materials
like plastic, the emphasis has definitely
shifted to cheapness. Similarly, the
insistence on durability has been
replaced by a demand for greater var¬
iety. Modern taste is restless and
prepared to renew and replace articles
more easily and more frequently.
It is therefore in the very nature of
the craft Industry that great sensitivity
and delicate handling, infinite patience
and tireless perseverance will be
needed before crafts can play an
appropriate role in contemporary so¬
ciety. The public must bear with this
great heritage of mankind in its period
of mutation, and remember that even
though its birth and flowering belonged
to another age, another atmosphere,
a totally different pattern of living and
tempo, it nevertheless has something
significant and Important to bring to
the modern context.
There is nothing spectacular about
crafts. You do not find them in Impos¬
ing structures humming with life and
lit by million candle-power lights.
They have mostly to be unearthed in
twilit corners and humble cottages.
Even though millions are engaged in
crafts all over the world, they are never
found in large concentrations. Their
tools are modest and unostentatious.
The importance of crafts cannot there¬
fore be measured through super struc¬
tures or streamlined machines. They
speak of an age when dignity lay in
silence and beauty in subtlety.

Menace to coffee
There's still a lot of coffee in Brazil.
But unless the activities of the "Meloido-
gyne coffeicola" are .checked, there may be
much less. This minute parasite feeds
off the roots of plants, killing them or
reducing their yields. The pests have laid
to waste a number of Brazilian coffee
plantations, and federal and state govern-,
ments, with help from FAO and inter¬
national chemical companies, are mounting
a vigorous eradication campaign.
Food aid for Morocco
The World Food Programme will contrib¬
ute $13 million in food aid to an ambitious
Moroccan project to help rural people
build and improve houses and schools. The
$60 million scheme, to be developed in
ten different locations, involves building
60,000 new houses and renovating
30,000 homes, building schools, health
and social centres and streets, and
providing water supplies, sewage systems
and street lighting.
Kimono renaissance
The kimono, traditional Japanese costume,
Is regaining favour. Relegated to the back
of the closet for years because it was
cumbersome and expensive, its annual
sales are now increasing by 20 to 30 per
cent. Much of the kimono's returning
popularity is due to the substitution of
wool for silk, thus cutting the price by
as much as 90 per cent.
Putting human rights
to work
A new survey of international efforts
since World War II to enforce human rights
appears in a recent Issue, of International
Conciliation, published by the Carnegie
Endowment for International Peace. "The
Key to Human Rights Implementation",
written by Dr. William Korey, director of
the B'nai B'rith United Nations office, cites
indifference of governments and suspicion
of former colonial countries as deterrents
to progress, and calls attention to the
hampering effect of political problems on
human rights action. Conversely, he cites
the International Labour Organization and
the Council of Europe as two organi¬
zations that have made encouraging break¬
throughs.
'Vision and Value': new
focus on art and science
Some of the world's foremost scientists,
scholars, artists and educators have con¬
tributed to "Vision and Value", a series
of six volumes dedicated to the search
for values common to contemporary scien¬
tific, technological and artistic achievements.
Prepared under the editorship of Gyorgy
Kepes, professor of visual design at the
Massachusetts Institute of Technology,
U.S.A., each volume Is dedicated to a
broad basic theme and contains some
15 essays and over 150 illustrations. The
six titles in the series are: "Education of
Vision", "Structure In Art and in Science",
"The Nature and Art of Motion", "Module,
Proportion, Symmetry, Rhythm". "The Man-
Made Object", "Sign, Image, Symbol".
This unique series is published by George
Braziller, Inc., 1 Park Avenue, New York,
N.Y. 10016 ($12.50 per volume) and by
Studio Vista Ltd., Blue Star House, Highgate
Hill, London, N.19 (63/-. per volume). Please

Polio on the rise
Poliomyelitis, so dramatically reduced in
North America, Europe and Oceania, has
shown a three-fold rise in tropical and
semi-tropical countries. Chief victims are
children under five. Studies show that
vaccination 95 per cent successful in
temperate climates is only 60 per cent
effective. Scientists supported by
WHO are investigating this problem.
Tree bark vs. oil pollution
Ordinary tree bark ground into powder
has come to the rescue of water polluted
by oil from ships and industry. Stuffed
into sausage-like booms of nylon, the bark
effectively absorbs the pollutant. The waste
it contains makes it highly combustible and
afterwards it can be used as fuel. Tests
show that two litres of bark powder absorb
one litre of liquid.
Museum computer network
Fifteen museums in New York City and
one in Washington D.C. have set up the
first computer-based central archive of the
principal art resources in the U.S.A. This
museum computer network, which is to
distribute information to museums, libraries,
PEACE THROUGH INTERNATIONAL LAW
The United Nations has dedicated its latest
commemorative stamp, issued on April 21, to

in 1947 "to promote the progressive development
of international law and its codification." The
new stamp appears in 6 and 13 cent denomi¬
nations. As agent in France for the U.N. Postal

Renaissance library
recreated in one book
Treasures from the famous Bibliotheca
Corviniana of Buda in Hungary have been
made accessible for the first time to the
general public by Editions Europa of Buda¬
pest which, in co-operation with Unesco,
has published a beautiful volume containing
many remarkable, illuminated manuscript
pages which once belonged to the library.
Founded at the beginning of the Renaissan¬
ce by King Matthias of Hungary, the Cor¬
viniana Library's original collection number¬

the property of other European libraries.
Unesco has financially aided the project
and arranged for Corviniana works in 40
libraries to be photographed for the cata¬

Air pollution antidote
Ninety-eight per cent of the pollutant
sulphur dioxide can be removed from the
flue gases of heavy-oil fired boilers by
a new Swedish process, which also elimin
ates 90 per cent of flue gas dust. The
new system washes the flue gas with a
lime solution; the resultant sludge is dis¬
posed of easily and safely. Though design¬
ed to combat sulphur dioxide, the pro¬
cess can also be used against other gases.
International efforts
to conquer cancer
The foundation stone of the headquarters
of the International Agency for Research
on Cancer was laid recently in Lyon,
France. The Agency, an autonomous body
with nine member countries and operating
within the framework of the World Health
Organization, was founded in 1965 to pro¬
mote and participate in international co¬
operation in cancer research. It collabo¬
rates with over 60 centres in different parts
of the world, and has set up regional cen¬
tres in Nairobi, Singapore and Jamaica to
study environmental factors.
Unesco teams to study
wind damage
Unesco plans to send teams of experts
in structural engineering and the aero¬
dynamics of structures to areas of the
world where damage has been caused
by strong winds. Their mission will be to
reduce future damage by assessing how
bridges, towers, and chimneys are affected
by high wind, and studying the pattern of
damage left by a storm. They will compare
the relative merits of traditional and new
building methods and materials, and
suggest design and construction Improve¬
ments. Wind damage throughout the world
costs an estimated $1,000 million annually.
The promotion of literacy
The Pontifical Commission for Justice and
Peace has recently created a committee
for the development of peoples, under the
presidency of Monsignor de Araujo Sales,
Archbishop of Bahia (Brazil). The com¬
mittee will work to promote, organize and
co-ordinate the contribution of the Roman
Catholic Church to the basic education of
hundreds of millions of illiterate adults.
Pope Paul VI has emphasized that this
step was taken in response to an appeal
by Mr René Maheu, Director-General of
Unesco, for the Church to actively co-op¬
erate in the campaign for basic education
and functional literacy which Unesco is
striving to promote throughout the world.
Flashes...
Europe, with 13.5% of the world's
population, produced over 44% of the
world's books in 1965, reports the Unesco
Statistical Yearbook.
The rate of increase of Spain's university
population is seven times greater than that
of the country's total population. While
male student enrolment has tripled in recent
years, that of women students has increas¬
ed tenfold.
Britain's roads, the most congested in
the world, carry 55.3 vehicles per mile
double the density in the U.S.A. and France.
The United States has nearly 2,000 mus¬
eums, which are visited by almost
200 million people annually.
No matter what control measures are
used, world population will have doubled
in the next 40 years, according to WHO.

Letters to the Editor
PROBLEMS OF THE BIOSPHERE
Sir,
We were delighted to note the empha¬
sis of your January 1969 issue on the
problems of the biosphere, in excellent
articles by Michel Bâtisse, René Dubos,
Jean Dorst and Frank Fraser Darling.
Through your own 12 editions, and I
hope through wide reprinting, they
should do much to stimulate more posi¬
tive action to change some of the tragic
imbalances resulting from centuries of
mindless exploitation.
I should like to call your attention to
the fact that Dr. Harold Coolidge is
now President of the International Union
for Conservation of Nature and Natural
Resources (IUCN), having succeeded
Dr. François Bourlière at the General
Assembly in Lucerne in 1968. Professor
Dorst is VIce-Chalrman of the IUCN
Survival Service Commission.

IN THE EPIC TRADITION
Sir.
Congratulations on the issue devoted
to "Two Great Epics of Asia, Rama-
yana and Mahabharata" , (December
1967). I have just re-read your brilliant
and unusual account of these two great
Eastern epics. Would that more such
studies were carried out for the benefit
of all people proud of an undying and
rich culture and tradition. Would a
WHEN THE EARTH SHOOK IN KHORASSAN
Sir.
Congratulations to Rex Keating for
his vivid description in your February
1969 issue of the effects of the recent
Khorassan earthquake in Iran. We spent
two and a half months in the devastated
area helping to assess and restore
groundwater supplies, and can endorse
heartily most of his observations and
comments.
Nevertheless, the photograph on page
33 is misleading, for although the caption
does not state that the fissures shown
result directly from shock waves, this
is clearly implied.
In this part of Iran, as elsewhere in
arid territories, small cultivated areas
along the bottoms of stream valleys
have been laboriously terraced over the
centuries Into a series of flat or almost
flat fields bounded by irrigation ditches
and along their lower sides by earthen
embankments locally known as bansar.
Each bansar is surmounted by a ridge
of earth 1-2 feet high, the function of
which is to pond back rain or irrigation
water so that the field behind may
benefit by thorough saturation. Several
ditches and bansar can be seen In the
photograph. The original stream is
canalized along the side of the valley
and flanks the cultivated area so that
water can easily be directed into the
irrigation system. Under normal cir¬
cumstances each field regularly receives
Its quota of water and is temporarily
flooded to a depth of a few inches.
Your photograph (below left) shows
not earthquake fissures, but an almost
textbook example of a ramifying drain¬
age pattern. Probably this formed over
38
an extended period before the earth¬
quake as a result of successive winter
flooding of deserted land with conse¬
quent breaching of the bansar and
development of drainage channels. If
it can be shown conclusively that the
pattern postdates the disaster, then,
more interestingly, the effects can be
attributed to a failure to stop the flow
of irrigation water to the fields immedi¬
ately after the shock, with consequent
excessive flooding and rapid erosion
of the soft, sllty soil by the outrush
of water through bansar breached by
overflow.
We saw fissuring directly attributable
to shock waves near the villages of
Saliani and Sefidasht in the middle of
the plain of Dashti Biaz, along the
north side of which ran the course of
the main fault. These fissures were
arcuate or almost circular and in our
opinion were caused by the shaking and
compaction of the thick silts which here
form the alluvium of the plain. This
pattern bore no resemblance whatever
to the ramifying pattern in the photo.
Your readers may be interested to
see a photograph (below right) of the
main fault-plane of the earthquake,
which here has a vertical downthrow
of about one metre and a lateral dis¬
placement of about two metres.

YOUTH 1969
Sir,
A brief word of thanks for the
immense hope that your issue "Youth
1969" (April 1969) has brought to young
people. Transcending the subjective
aspects and particularities of the prob¬
lem, this outstanding number foresees
the profound transformation to which
world civilization is already committed
and shows how a new awareness to
the problem has been awakened.

FROM A 12-YEAR OLD
MEDIEVALIST
Sir,
I read your December 1968 issue of
the "Unesco Courier" entitled "Venice
in Peril". I adore medieval clothes,
songs, musical instruments, castles,
weapons in fact, everything in that
period, especially the old way of speak¬
ing. I hate the more up-to-date versions
of all these, things. Sometimes I feel
that I was born in the wrong century.
It made me really very sad to read
your December number. It seems to
me that all the old (medieval or not
medieval) things are either disappear¬
ing or have already gone. What will
this world be like In the year 2000?
(I hope I'm not alive, thenl)
As the world grows older, people
should be trying to restore beautiful old
buildings and cities.
Because of this I have started a club
called SVAMIT (Save Venice and Med¬
ieval Italian Tradition). The medieval
Italian tradition bit is added because I
hate the way beautiful old Italian cities
are getting ruined by modern factories,
oil rigs, and modern industry.
Anyway, we would love to know if
there is any place that we could send
the proceeds of our fêtes and collections
to. We want Venice to stay the same
marvellous, magnificent, beautiful city
that It always has been. And even if
this world develops into the horrid
world that men in power (in the 20th
century) want it to, we want Venice
to always stay the same.
In our club we have medieval parties.
We eat food that is prepared and served
in medieval fashion. We speak in the
old way and dress in the old way too.
It is almost as good as being alive
in 1600.

Just published by Unesco
AN ANTHOLOGY OF TEXTS ON HUMAN RIGHTS
prepared under the direction of Jeanne Hersch
"Birthright of Man", published by Unesco to mark the 20th anni¬
versary of the Universal Declaration of Human Rights, illustrates
how people everywhere, throughout the ages and all over the
world, have asserted and claimed the birthright of man (select¬
ed passages published in the November 1968 issue of the
"Unesco Courier").
Contains over a thousand fragments culled from every epoch
between 3000 B. C. and 1948 A. D., the year the Universal
Declaration was adopted.
Brings together texts from every continent, every latitude and
longitude, from fable and tragedy, legislation and proverb,
political treatises and ritual texts, from funerary inscriptions
and popular songs.
Presents the broad canvas of themes which have inspired the
Universal Declaration : the human person, power and limitations
of power, civil liberty, truth and freedom, social rights, education,
science, culture, servitude and violence, law against force,
national identity and independence, universality, sources and
ends of rights.
592 pages (93/4x6V2 in.)
12 full-plate illustrations, including 4 in colour, and 21
textual illustrations.
Cloth bound $12.00; £3 (stg.); 35 F.

UTENSILS
AS WORKS
OF ART
With their love of beau¬
ty and creative skills,
craftsmen of pre-in-
dustrial days turned
even the most common¬
place objects and uten¬
sils into works of art.
Modern assembly-line
products often sacrifi¬
ce aesthetic qualities
to demands of speed
and quantity. The crafts¬
man's appreciation of
beauty is displayed in
this wooden distaff
stand with its graceful
painted reliefs, carved
by a 19th century arti¬
san, Lazar Vasilyev, in
the Nizhni Novgorod
(now Gorki) region of
the U.S.S.R. (see article
page 25).
From the collection of
the History Museum, Moscow
