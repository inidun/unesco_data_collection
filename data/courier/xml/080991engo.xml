Aida at Luxor
In May 1987, one hundred and
sixteen years after it was first performed,
the Italian composer Giuseppe Verdi's
famous opera A ida was staged amid the
ruins of ancient Thebes, the city in which
parts of it are set. In the magnificent
setting of Luxor temple, below, an
international audience enjoyed a
production that brought onto the stage a
glittering cast of 1 ,500 singers, dancers
and extras, as well as a small herd of horses
and even a lion. Officials of the Egyptian
Antiquities Service ensured that the fragile
monuments would not be damaged by the
technical crews and their equipment.
Aida is based on an idea by the French
Egyptologist Auguste Mariette. The story
turns on the rivalry between the
Pharaoh's daughter, Amnéris, who is in
love with the young general R adames, and
Aida, taken captive after her father, the
king of Ethiopia, is defeated by Raclâmes.
Condemned for treason because of his love
for Aida, Radamès is entombed in a death
chamber with her.

Long ago, the scholars and travellers of Antiquity
were fascinated by the Egypt of the Pharaohs.
Today, almost 200 years after modern
archaeological study of ancient Egypt began, that
fascination is still as potent as ever. Egyptology is a
constantly expanding field of study in which
specialists patiently try to reconstruct a rich and
still in many ways baffling civilization from
records remarkably preserved in the dry air and
desert sands. The record-breaking crowds which
flock to international exhibitions of ancient
Egyptian art show that a vast non-specialist public
is today eager to know more about ancient
Egyptian culture. Meanwhile, the giant pyramids
and lavishly decorated tombs and temples of the
Nile Valley, the messages of hieroglyphs carved in
stone or written on papyrus, have also created a
vision (not always historically accurate) of ancient
Egypt which has stimulated the imagination of
artists, architects, writers and musicians down the
centuries.
This issue of the Unesco Courier retraces some
of the steps in the rediscovery of Pharaonic Egypt
in modern times and evokes some of the grandiose
achievements of ancient Egyptian architecture and
engineering. But above all it seeks, in the light of
the latest findings by Egyptologists, to show
through the more homely and intimate aspects of
their lives how the ancient Egyptians saw
themselves and their world ; the pattern of daily
life and work; the rhythm of the seasons
dominated by the annual inundation of the Nile ;
the strange, complex and ubiquitous figures of the
Egyptian pantheon; attitudes to the afterlife. The
picture that emerges is one of a society in which
the sacred and the sublime were totally integrated
into the tissue of everyday life, a civilization in
which the earthly, the ephemeral, and the eternal
were uniquely blended. This harmony is perhaps
most clearly seen in ancient Egyptian art which,
with its minute attention to detail, its gift for
conveying the most subtle nuances of expression
and movement, provides a vivid panorama of a
people, time and place in which all aspects of
earthly experience farming, family life, the
enjoyment of transient pleasures were sacred
activities forming part of cosmic processes.
This issue comprises 40 pages and a 4-page advertising insert between pages 2-3 and 38-39.

-Time and the river-^
BY JOHN BAINES Life in ancient Egypt
was geared
^annual ÑUe-floQd
WITHOUT the Nile, which flows
north from the Ethiopian high¬
lands and Central Africa to the
Mediterranean, Egypt with its negligible
rainfall would have been almost completely
inhospitable. Because of the river, it was the
largest and most prosperous East Mediterra¬
nean State from 3000 BC until the Roman
conquest in 30 BC. It regained this pre-emi¬
nence in the Middle Ages, and remains the
most important and populous country in the
Near East. There is true continuity over this
enormous period, because Egypt's boundaries
have changed little.
Throughout Antiquity, the country's
standing relied on its agricultural wealth and
hence on the Nile; yet agriculture was not
the original basis of subsistence, but evolved
with the land in prehistory. As well as gov
erning material potential, the Nile and other
geographical features affected political de¬
velopments and played a part in Egyptian
ideas.
In the Pleistocene era, which ended
around 10,000 BC, Egypt was part of the
eastern Sahara, which was inhabited by
nomadic hunter-gatherers. The region was
rather less arid than at present and supported
people in areas now without resources or
population. The Nile, whose Valley and
Delta were largely swamp, was privileged as
a reliable water source, attracting game and
people, and being exploited for its plants and
fish. By 12,000 BC people also gathered wild
grasses, presumably for their cereal grains,
which needed more processing than other
foods they consumed. This suggests that
pressure on food resources was increasing.
In succeeding millennia the Sahara slowly
dried, becoming by 200Ó BC almost as arid
as it is now. From 10,000 to 5000 BC, late
Stone-Age people gathered where there was
water, exploiting resources ever more inten¬
sively, both in the desert and near the Nile.
The culture of the region was uniform, un¬
like that of later small-scale peasant societies.
The transition to crop-growing occurred
either near water in the desert or in the Nile
Valley and Delta. Dates of 7000-5000 BC
have been suggested for both, much later
than in Western Asia. Because the Nile
Valley preserves little evidence for farming,
it may have been present earlier than can be
documented.
The Nile Valley and Delta were opened up
gradually for agriculture and population in¬
creased. By 4000 BC there were only two

principal cultures in Egypt, the older
Merimda culture in the Delta and the
Badarian, centred on Asyut in Upper Egypt.
Before 3100 BC the single Egyptian State
had formed the first large nation State.
Egypt continued to develop and popula¬
tion increased until Roman times. Important
factors in this process were unity and politic¬
al stability, and the possibility of cultivating
ever more fertile land. In this internal expan¬
sion the harnessing of the Nile was crucial.
Crops could be planted after the annual in¬
undation, which covered the Valley and
Delta from late July to September; they
needed minimal watering and ripened
from March to May. Some management of
the inundation to improve its coverage of the
land and to regulate the period of flooding
increased yields, while drainage and the
river's slow deposition of silt extended the
fields. Vegetables grown in small plots
needed irrigating all year from water carried
by hand in pots; not until 1500 BC was any
artificial water-lifting device introduced.
Some plants, such as date palms, whose
crops ripened in the late summer, drew their
water from the subsoil and needed no other
watering.
It is uncertain how early and how far this
regulation of the inundation and small-scale
watering shifted toward full-scale irrigation.
By the Middle Kingdom (c. 2040-1640 BC)
basin irrigation, in which large sections of
the floodplain were treated as single units,
was well established, but it may not have
been present in the Old Kingdom (third
millennium BC), when the great pyramids
were built.
Egyptian texts say little about irrigation
and provision of water, making it difficult to
establish when techniques were introduced.
Exceptions are autobiographies of local lead¬
ers of the troubled First Intermediate Period
(c. 2134-2040 BC), who claimed that they
built canals and supplied water to their peo¬
ple when others had none. In more prosper¬
ous times such matters may have been taken
for granted or not thought prestigious
enough to be described in public texts. The
only area where there was major irrigation
work before Graeco-Roman times was the
Faiyum, a lakeside oasis to the west of the
Nile south of the Delta apex. Here Middle
Kingdom kings reclaimed land by controll¬
ing the water flow down a side river channel
and directing it away from the lake to low-
lying land. Their constructions did not last.
The Nile's annual inundation was quite
reliable, and the floodplain and Delta were
uniquely fertile, making Egyptian1 agricul¬
ture the most secure and productive in the
region, while stability allowed storage
against scarcity. This situation was,
however, only relatively favourable. Crop
failure due to poor floods, population loss
through disease, and other hazards, res¬
tricted the pace of growth and unlike mod¬
ern Egypt only one main crop was grown
per year. High floods could be very
destructive.
The principal crops were cereals, emmer
wheat for bread, and barley for beer. These
made up the staple diet and were easily
stored. Other vital plants were flax, which
was used for products from rope to the finest
cloth and was also exported, and papyrus, a
swamp plant which may have been culti¬
vated or gathered wild. Papyrus roots could
be eaten, and the stems were used for making
anything from boats and mats to the charac¬
teristic Egyptian writing material with the
same name as the plant; this too was ex¬
ported. In addition, a wide range of fruit and
vegetables was cultivated. Meat from live¬
stock was relatively unimportant in the diet,

but birds were hunted in the marshes and the
Nile produced much fish, which was the
main animal protein for most people.
Apart from making agriculture possible,
the Nile was the chief means of communica¬
tion. In the Egyptian script words for
travelling are written with signs of ships.
Heavy loads were taken by river and the ease
of water transport helped the country's in¬
tegration, while the complex geography of

themselves much that is achieved through
co-operation in small societies. The central
organization that grew in the third millen¬
nium BC created a disciplined labour force
which was used to build vast royal monu¬
ments and élite tombs, for the fortifications
and pyramids of the Middle Kingdom, for
the imperial expansion, temples and private
tombs of the New Kingdom

the Delta and its mouths were obstacles to
invasion. Travel into the desert or to Asia
was incomparably more difficult than move¬
ment within Egypt. The river could also
separate people. The image of a poor man
was someone who had no boat, whom the
more fortunate should ferry across. Dying
was "coming in to land" on the "other side",
and the passage into the next world was a
"crossing".
The compactness of Egypt, centred on the
Nile, favoured political unity, which
brought both potential for exploiting the
land's fertility and obligations on rulers.
Rulers controlled agricultural resources
through ownership of land, taxation of its
produce, administrative measures to ensure
that it was cultivated, and compulsory
labour. In return for control, they were re¬
sponsible for storage and for provision
(c. 1550-1070 BC), and for building and
other activities of the Graeco-Roman
period.
Organization and the productivity of in¬
undation agriculture made all this possible,
temporarily releasing many from the land
during the slack summer months in the
fields, or permanently freeing people to fol¬
low specialized and élite occupations. When
central control collapsed, chiefly in the three
Intermediate Periods, few monuments were
constructed and there was little political ex¬
pansion, but the agricultural basis of power
and prosperity was not destroyed; after
reunification monumental projects and
general culture revived. One should not,
however, forget that for most people this use
of labour made available by productivity
was not a personal benefit, but served the
rulers and the élite. Were it not for political

instability, the lot of many could have been
as good or better in the Intermediate Periods
(c. 2134-2040 BC, 1640-1532 BC, 1070-712
BC), but here beliefs about king and country
may have affected their outlook.
The Nile, which was so fundamental to
the country's life, was surprisingly unimpor¬
tant in religion. The Egyptians took their
environment for granted as the centre of the
world. There was no special name for the
Nile, which was simply the "river"; the
word "Nile" may not be Egyptian in origin.
The bringer of water and fertility was not the
static river but its inundation, called Hapy,
who became a god. Hapy was an essential
image of abundance, but he was not a major
god. Both kings and local potentates likened
themselves to Hapy in their prosperity and
provision for their subjects. A hymn to
Hapy dwells on the inundation's bountiful
wf?
nature but does not relate him to the rest of
the gods, as was done in the praise of other
deities. He was not depicted as a god but as a
fat figure bringing the produce of abundance
to the gods. He had no temple, but was
worshipped annually at the start of the inun¬
dation with sacrifices and hymns at Gebel
el-Silsila, which was probably a prehistoric
frontier, where the hills come close to the
river north of Aswan.
In some other respects the Nile and the
inundation were central to the Egyptian
world view. Unlike most peoples, the
Egyptians oriented themselves to the south,
from which the river came, so that the west
was on their right with the result that it was
the "good" side for passage into the next
world. The year and calendar were deter¬
mined by the Nile and by the stars. New
Year was in mid July, when the river began
to rise for the inundation; this coincided
with the reappearance of the star Sirius,
Egyptian Sothis, in the sky after seventy
days' invisibility. The river defined three
seasons of four months, "Inundation",
"Emergence" (November-March) when the
land reappeared and could be cultivated, and
"Heat" or "Harvest", when crops were
gathered and the water was lowest.
The major god most closely connected
with the Nile was Osiris. In myth Osiris was
a king of Egypt who was killed by his
brother Seth on the banks of the river and
cast into it in a coffin. His corpse was cut
into many pieces. Later, his sister and widow
Isis succeeded in reassembling his body and
reviving it to conceive a posthumous son,
Horus. Osiris, however, did not return to
this world but became king of the under¬
world. His death and revival were linked to
the land's fertility. In a festival celebrated
during the inundation, damp clay models of
Osiris were planted with barley, whose ger¬
mination stood for the revival of the land
brought by the flood, so that Osiris, the river
and the land were drawn into a complex of
ideas about fertility and rebirth.
Another important god linked to the river
was Khnum the "Lord of the Cataract", the
ram god of Elephantine at the southern fron¬
tier. Khnum was a creator god and the pat¬
ron of the point where the inundation en¬
tered Egypt. This connection was, however,
secondary, supplementing an ancient local
cult of the goddess Satis, whose temple cele¬
brated the conjunction between Sothis and
the inundation; despite the later arrival of the
inundation in more populous areas further
north, the conjunction was observed and
recorded at Elephantine.
The Nile's fundamental importance may
be more evident to us than to the ancient
Egyptians, who were so accustomed to it
that they termed rain in other countries an
"inundation in the sky". In order to appreci¬
ate its position in Antiquity, one must see it
through ancient eyes with ancient distinc¬
tions between sacred and secular, divine and
human. The Egyptians had a matter-of-fact
attitude to the river, whose inundation could
be destructive but was a beneficent moral
force in their lives; most gods were more
complex beings whose abode was outside the
normal world. It was left to the Greeks and
Romans to make the Nile a god like the other
rivers of their world. I

The riddle of the Rosetta
BY JEAN VERCOUTTER
Scholars and adventurers who
rediscovered a forgotten civilization
N 27 September 1822, the French
scholar J e an - F r a n ço i s
Champollion read out to the
members of his country's Académie des In¬
scriptions et Belles-Lettres his celebrated Let¬
tre à M. Dacier, relative à l'alphabet des
hiéroglyphes phonétiques employés par les
Egyptiens, a text which marked a turning-
point in the rediscovery of ancient Egypt.
The civilization of the Pharaohs, with its
grandiose monuments and the exotic facets
of its religion, has always inspired curiosity
and wonder. The writings of Herodotus, of
Diodorus of Sicily, of Strabo and of Petrarch
were rich in detail of the way of life and the
religious practices of the ancient Egyptians.
However, in the fourth century AD,
Christianity became the religion of the
Roman Empire and, in 391, Theodosius I
closed all pagan temples. The Egyptian
priests, who were the only teachers of
hieroglyphic writing, gradually died out,
and with them died all knowledge of the art.
By the sixth century, no one could read the
texts inscribed on monuments or written on
papyrus.
It was not until the seventeenth, and more
particularly, the eighteenth century that in¬
quisitive travellers reawakened interest in
^Discovered near the mouth of the
Nile by an officer of Napoleon's
army in 1799, the Rosetta Stone,

the long-forgotten language of
ancient Egypt. It bears the text of
a decree by Egyptian priests to
commemorate the crowning of
Ptolemy VEpiphanes, King of
Egypt from 205 to 180 BC,
written in three different scripts:
hieroglyphic at the top, demotic
(the popular language of Egypt at
that time) in the middle, Greek at
the bottom. One of the pioneers of
the decipherment of the
hieroglyphic script was the
French scholarJean-François
Champollion (1790-1832), shown
above in an anonymous 19th-
century portrait. He was the first to
establish an entire list of
hieroglyphs and their Greek
equivalents, providing a basis for
the translation of all Egyptian
hieroglyphic texts.

Stone Napoleon's Egyptian expedition of 1798-1799 was
accompanied by a team of scholars whose mission was to
study and record all aspects of Egypt, ancient and modern.
The team produced a multi-volume work, the Description
de l'Egypte (1809-1830), which contributed to Europe's
growing interest in Egypt. Illustrations from the
Description, below, are views of the temple complex at
Dendara in Upper Egypt drawn by the French engraver
Vivant Denon (1 747-1 825), who accompanied the
Egyptian expedition.
.
Egypt, its monuments and its mysterious
writing. The works of Benoit de Maillet and
Claude Sicard, and Constantin François de
Volney's Voyage en Syrie et Egypte (1787;
"Travels Through Syria and Egypt"), fur¬
nished details of the geography of the coun¬
try and of its great temples, while Vivant
Denon's sketches made the face of Egypt
known to Europeans.
Denon was an attractive personality who
lived a very full life. After serving as a gentle¬
man-in-waiting to Louis XV and then as
embassy secretary at St. Petersburg and
Naples under Louis XVI, he persuaded
Napoleon to allow him to join his expedition
to Egypt in 1798, "despite his age" (he was
then fifty!). Appointed Director of
Museums by Napoleon on his return from
Egypt, he created the Musée Napoléon, now
the Louvre Museum.
Vivant Denon's Voyage dans la Basse et la
Haute Egypte ("Travels Through Upper and
Lower Egypt") marked the beginning of a
rebirth of interest in ancient Egypt. Pub¬
lished in Paris in 1802, it was a runaway
success throughout Europe. It ran to forty
successive editions and was translated into
English and German.
Denon had accompanied General Desaix's
detachment to Upper Egypt where, often at
risk of his life and sometimes bearing arms
himself, he sketched all the Pharaonic monu¬
ments he came across. The charm of his
evocative drawings fuelled the "Egyptoma-
nia" that was rife both among the educated
élite and the general public. Egyptian-style
furniture and knick-knacks proliferated
and an unexpected consequence this the
theft of antiquities soared.
Vivant Denon's book was followed short¬
ly afterwards by Description de l'Egypte, a
massive work consisting of nine volumes of
text and eleven large tomes of maps and
illustrations. This was the work of the
150 scholars who accompanied Napoleon to
Egypt; it was published between 1809
and 1830. In 1822, however, the riddle of the
hieroglyphs with which the walls of many
Egyptian monuments were covered re¬
mained unsolved and the real story of Egypt
of the Pharaohs remained shrouded in
mystery.
In August 1799, during the preparation of
earthworks near Rosetta (Rashid), to the east
of Alexandria, an officer of Napoleon's
army noticed a stone of black basalt covered
with inscriptions. His superior, General
Menou, had the stone taken to Alexandria
and showed it to the scholars accompanying
the expedition. The stone was inscribed with
three texts. The one at the top was in hiero¬
glyphic characters, the middle one in charac¬
ters that looked somewhat like Arabic wri¬
ting, and the one at the bottom in Greek
characters. Since several of the scholars knew
Greek, they were immediately able to read
the bottom text, a decree dating
from 196 BC, during the reign of
Ptolemy V. Deducing, correctly, that these
were three versions of the same text, they
realized that they had in their hands a poten¬
tial key to hieroglyphic writing.
The scholars took rubbings and made
several copies of the inscriptions. This was
fortunate, since, on the surrender of the
French forces, the British seized the
"Rosetta Stone" as war booty. It is today in
the British Museum, London.
News of the discovery of the Rosetta
Stone spread quickly throughout Europe,
and there began a fiercely competitive race to
be the first to decipher the mysterious
writing.
Jean-François Champollion was the most
fervent, and also the youngest, of these com¬
petitors. Born at Figeac in southwest France
in 1790, he grew up in a milieu in which
Egypt was a consuming passion. His
brother, Jacques-Joseph Champollion, who
had been unable to take part in the expedi¬
tion to Egypt, was secretary to the mathema¬
tician, Egyptologist and Prefect of the Isère
département, Joseph Fourier. Fourier had
been among the scholars who had accompa¬
nied the Egyptian expedition and on his
return to France he wrote the lengthy histor¬
ical preface to the Description de l'Egypte.
Brought up in contact with two such men,
Jean-François himself became passionately
interested in Egypt. On seeing a copy of the
Rosetta Stone inscriptions he vowed that he
would be the first to decipher the hiero¬
glyphs. At the age of thirteen, with this
objective in mind, he not only learned Latin
and Greek but also Hebrew, Arabic, Syriac
and Aramaic. In addition, at the age of seven¬
teen, he also acquired Persian and Coptic,
for he had become convinced that Coptic
was, in fact, ancient Egyptian transcribed in
Greek characters.

ing from dabbling in politics, Champollion
settled in Paris near nis brother who was
now secretary to Bon Joseph Dacier, a Hel¬
lenist, and Perpetual Secretary of the
Académie des Inscriptions et Belles-Lettres.
He devoted himself wholly to his research
whilst keeping an anxious eye on the pro¬
gress of his rivals, the English physicist
Thomas Young, his compatriot Sylvestre de
Sacy and the Swede Johan David Akerblad,
all of whom were attempting to unravel the
secret of Egyptian writing.
Like Champollion himself, they were all
faced with the same conundrum. Was
Egyptian writing ideographic or phonetic?
In other words, did each character represent
an idea or a sound? On 14 September 1832,
Champollion had the sudden intuition that
Egyptian was both ideographic and
phonetic. With the help of the Rosetta Stone
and copies of inscriptions from other monu¬
ments sent to him from Egypt by friends, he
succeeded in deciphering the names of
Greek and Roman rulers: Alexander,
Cleopatra, Arsinoe, Augustus, Nero, and so
on. With these names as a starting point he
succeeded in deciphering the basic
alphabetical characters; and from the names
of the Caesars and the Ptolemies he went on
to unravel those of the Egyptian
Pharaohs the Ramesses and the Tuthmosis
Dynasties. Gradually increasing the number
of hieroglyphic characters he could recog¬
nize at eacn stage of his research, he ended up
by being able to read them all. By working at
ever longer texts he finally mastered the
Egyptian language.
Despite the jealousy that his discoveries
aroused, his achievement gradually gained
recognition. With the backing of some high-
ranking members of the court, he was

nominated Curator of the Egyptian collec¬
tions at the Louvre Museum. In 1827 he
achieved the ambition of his life when he was
entrusted with a mission of exploration in
Egypt. Setting out in 1828, accompanied by
a number of excellent artists, such as Nestor
LlHôte, and a team of Italians led by his
pupil and friend Rossellini, he spent fifteen
months scouring the valley of the Nile from
Alexandria to Aswan, stopping for a time at
Abu Simbel and going as far as the Second
Cataract. He was able to write with pride to
his patron Dacier: "I can now inform you
that no changes will be necessary in our
Lettre sur l'Alphabet des Hiéroglyphes
("Paper on the Hieroglyphic Alphabet");
our alphabet is correct and holds equally
good (...) for the inscriptions on all the tem¬
ples, palaces and tombs of the Pharaonic
epochs."
Whilst Champollion and his rivals were
hard at work deciphering the hieroglyphics,
the first effect of the "Egyptomania" which
had become the rage with the publication of
Vivant Denon's book and the Description de
l'Egypte was to arouse the covetousness of
collectors, and in particular of the great
European museums, all of which wanted
their own collection of Egyptian antiquities.
Furthermore, scores of adventurers were
attracted to Egypt in the hope of making a
quick fortune.
Egypt was, in theory, under the
sovereignty of the Sultan of Constantinople,
but, in fact, the Viceroy, Mehemet Ali, ruled
the country as an absolute monarch.
Mehemet Ali wanted to modernize the
country and had little interest in antiquities.
As a result, taking advantage of their pri¬
vileged diplomatic status, the foreign consuls
obtained from him the necessary permits to
carry out archaeological excavations and
take away ancient monuments. They re¬
cruited agents amongst adventurers, whom
they engaged to carry out excavations in
their name and to bring back the antiquities
discovered or bought. It was in this manner
that a number of important collections were
constituted.
The Italian diplomat and collector
Bernardino Drovetti, who was French Con¬
sul General in Egypt between 1810
and 1829, took advantage of his long tenure
to indulge in some profitable trafficking in
The French Egyptologist Auguste Mariette
(1821-1881) made his name with the excavation
of the Serapeum, a temple at Saqqara (Memphis)
which was originally the necropolis of the Apis
bulls, sacred animals of the god Ptah. The
subterranean chambers of the temple, which
Mariette entered in 185 1 , yielded the mummies
of 64 Apis bulls. This engraving made in 1858
shows a newly excavated gate of the Serapeum.
antiquities, at times directing the search for
them himself. His agents pillaged sites un¬
scrupulously, especially in the area of
Thebes. He offered a first collection to
Louis XVIII, but the French monarch found
the price too high. It was acquired by the
king of Piedmont and the Museum of Turin
thus became the owner of the first Egyptian
collection of high quality.
Encouraged by this, Drovetti put to¬
gether a second collection which, on
Champollion's advice, Louis XVIII's suc¬
cessor Charles X bought for the Louvre
Museum. He then built up a third collection
which was bought by the king of Prussia
in 1 836. Not so large as the other two, it was
nevertheless very fine.
Appointed British consul in 1816, the
artist Henry Salt followed Drovetti's exam¬
ple. He too assembled three successive col¬
lections. The first was bought by the British
Museum, except for its finest piece the ala¬
baster sarcophagus of Sethos I which was
sold to a private collector for the same price
as all the rest of the collection. The second
and much more important collection was
acquired by Charles X in 1824. Thanks to
the combined collections of Salt and
Drovetti, the Egyptian department of the
Louvre became the equal of that of the
Museum of Turin. Salt's third collection was
sold after his death, the major part of it going
to the British Museum.
These outstanding collections could never
have been put together without the untiring
efforts of the consuls' agents, notably the
Frenchman Jean-Jacques Rifaud, who
worked for Drovetti, a Greek named
Giovanni d'Athanasi, and above all the ex¬
traordinary Italian Giambattista Belzoni,
who acted for Salt. Born in Padua, Belzoni
had considered becoming a monk when he
was twenty, but instead he went to England
where, as a circus entertainer, he astonished
the public with his incredible feats of
strength. Later he turned up in Portugal, in
Spain, in Malta and finally in Egypt. There
he perfected a hydraulic pump of his own
invention for use in irrigation, but the ven¬
ture was not a success as Mehemet Ali re¬
fused to buy it. Penniless, he was recom¬
mended to Salt who took him into his ser¬
vice. Evidence of his astuteness and prodi- .
gious strength abounds in the narrative he
left of his Travels in Egypt and Nubia, dur¬
ing which he gathered antiquities for Salt.
Champollion's discoveries, and the pub¬
lications to which they gave rise, were to
form the basis of the training of the first
Egyptologists, among whom were some
outstanding figures.
Karl Lepsius, who studied at the College
de France, learned to read hieroglyphs from
posthumously published works by
Champollion. From 1842 to 1845 he headed
a great expedition to Egypt organized by the
king of Prussia. Appointed to a profes-

sorship at the University of Berlin, he was
the father of German Egyptology. His major
work, Denkmaeler aus Aegypten und
Aethiopien ("Monuments of Egypt and
Ethiopia") describes all the monuments of
the Nile Valley from the Fourth Cataract to
the Mediterranean.
John Wilkinson can, perhaps, be consi¬
dered the father of British Egyptology.
Abandoning a military career, he settled in
Egypt where he undertook archaeological
digs for more than ten years. In his Manners
and Customs of the Ancient Egyptians, he
was the first to describe the daily life of the
craftsmen and peasants of Pharaonic times as
depicted in tomb paintings.
After studying engineering and archi¬
tecture, the Frenchman Prisse d'Avennes had
an adventurous life as a young man. He
fought against the Turks in the Péloponnèse
and then became secretary to the Governor
General of India before settling in Egypt
where he devoted himself to archaeology.
He gave the Louvre the "Royal Chamber",
or "Hall of the Ancestors", removed from
the temple of Karnak just before Lepsius
arrived to take possession of it. He donated
to France the "Prisse Papyrus", a long and
precious document which dates from
2000 BC and has been described as the oldest
book in the world.
Finally, Auguste Mariette ensured the
future of the burgeoning discipline of
Egyptian archaeology by putting a stop to
the traffic in antiquities which had involved
quantities of objects, monuments and papyri
taken from Egypt either under cover of offi
cial permits or as booty from clandestine
excavations.
A secondary school teacher at Boulogne-
sur-Mer, Mariette was irresistibly drawn to
Egypt after seeing the drawings of Nestor
L'Hôte. Using Champollion's Grammaire
he taught himself to read hieroglyphs. Then,
after obtaining a modest post at tne Louvre
Museum, he was sent in 1850 on a mission to
Egypt to buy Coptic manuscripts. While
waiting for the permits necessary to make
these purchases he made a visit to Saqqara.
The sight of a few sphinxes, half buried in the
sand, reminded him of a text of Strabo which
mentioned an avenue lined with sphinxes
which led up to the Serapeum, the tombs of
the Apis bulls. Abandoning the Coptic
manuscripts, he decided to excavate. Un¬
covering sphinx after sphinx, he traced out
the avenue he had discovered and found that
it did indeed lead to the Serapeum, where he
dug out the enormous sarcophagi of the
sacred bulls and everything around them.
This discovery caused a great sensation
and earned Mariette an international repu¬
tation. But above all, having tasted the joys
of working in the field and experiencing the
heady intoxication of discovery during the
months of feverish exploration, he could no
longer do without them. Through the good
offices of Ferdinand de Lesseps, the viceroy
of Egypt, Said Pasha, entrusted Mariette
with the task of protecting the antiquities of
Egypt. In 1858 he appointed Mariette to the
post of Director of Works for the
Antiquities of Egypt and gave him all the
resources needed for action. Mariette then
began archaeological excavations at Giza,
Saqqara, Abydos, Thebes and Elephantine
and assembled all his finds in Cairo.
Anxious to protect all the objects and
monuments of ancient Egypt, Mariette had
the very greatest difficulty in ensuring the
application of the necessary measures.
Nevertheless, from that time, thanks to his
efforts, the foundations of the Egyptian
Antiquities Service and of the Cairo
Museum were laid. After his death, in 1881,
his work was continued by his successor,
Gaston Maspero. The way ahead was traced
out and was to lead to the great discoveries
which would lead to a deeper understanding
of Pharaonic Egypt the secret hiding-place
of the royal mummies at Deir el-Bahri, the
tomb of Tutankhamun and the royal tombs
ofTanis.
JEAN VERCOUTTER is a French Egyptologist
who was formerly director of the French Institute
of Oriental Archaeology in Cairo and of the Sudan
Antiquities Service, and professor of Egyptology at

Colossal feats of engineering
BY RAINER STADELMANN
The imposing Hypostyle Hall in the Great
Temple ofAmun, Karnak, begun by Sethos I
and completed by his son Ramesses II
(c. 1290-1224 BC). The monumental columns,
their papyriform capitals supporting colossal
architraves ata height of24 m, show a perfect
mastery of construction techniques.

ANYONE who has ever gazed at the
pyramids, if only once in a lifetime,
is bound to have wondered how
these extraordinary and massive structures
were built, how the huge stones were trans¬
ported, what technical and mathematical
knowledge the ancient Egyptians possessed
and what tools or machinery they used.
The same questions spring to mind when
contemplating the obelisks of Luxor, the
Hypostyle Hall at Karnak, and especially the
colossi of Memnon, monoliths hewn out of
the quarries north-east of Cairo and trans¬
ported to the city of Thebes 700 kilometres
away.
For the ancient Egyptians, technical and
scientific knowledge was not a specialized
discipline, but formed part of the training
and the career of a competent scribe, a man
employed in the service of his province or his
King. The scribe's education began when he
learned the difficult arts of reading and
writing, achieved with the help of literary
texts but undoubtedly also by means of
mathematical and technical works written
on papyrus, fewer examples of which have
come down to us than works of literature.
A number of common trades were prob¬
ably organized in family guilds from very
early times. There is evidence of specialized
crafts in Egypt in Predynastic times in the
form of finely crafted pottery and stone
tools, stoneware vessels, and metalwork.
The goldmines of the Eastern Desert and the
copper deposits of Sinai may have been ex¬
ploited in prehistoric times, and precious
stones prospected in the desert valleys of the
south-east. In historical times, deposits of
rare hard stone were quarried, often at a
considerable distance from the Nile Valley.
During the Old Kingdom (third millen¬
nium BC), the technique of stoneworking
was perfected in sculpture, both in low relief
and in the round, and culminated in the
earliest colossal statues such as the Great
Sphinx of Giza or the royal effigies of the
Fifth Dynasty (c. 2465-2323 BC).
The soil of Egypt, deposited along the
banks of the Nile by the annual inundation
so that fields continually had to be marked
out afresh, encouraged the development of
surveying and hence of mathematical calcu¬
lations. The rise of the Nile waters and the
annual height of the flood were calculated
and recorded by means of Nilometers in
the south, on Elephantine island, and in the
north, near Memphis for the height of the

waters determined the levying of taxes on the
income from different categories of cultiv¬
able land, particularly plantations on raised
plots. Observation of the relatively regular
inundation and its connection with astrono¬
mical phenomena led to the invention of an
annual calendar geared to the natural rhythm
of the seasons, which was a great improve¬
ment on the old lunar calendar. Knowledge
obtained from agrarian organization and
observation of the heavens and the stars laid
the theoretical foundations of the future
monumental constructions of the Old
Kingdom.
The river was also the country's main
artery. People travelled up or down the Nile
in boats or barges, and in the Delta the
branches of the river were used as channels
of communication. These waterways were
interconnected by canals, and a canal net¬
work also linked the settlements bordering
the Nile Valley. Even deliveries of goods
from one temple to another were carried out
by water. Lighter loads, such as sacks of
grain, were carried on donkeys over the
fields, and from the fields to canal or river.
Wheels, which came into current use only
under the New Kingdom (c. 1550-1070 BC),
were confined to war or hunting chariots.
Although these vehicles were used for excur¬
sions by the upper classes, they were never
strictly speaking a mode of transport. In the
Old Kingdom, high dignitaries used litters
for short overland journeys, but for longer
journeys boats were always the answer.
A royal boat approximately 44 metres
long has been excavated to the south of the
Great Pyramid of Khufu (Cheops) at Giza.
Equipped with five pairs of oars and another
huge pair of oars in lieu of a rudder, the boat
bore signs of wear and tear indicating that it
had actually sailed. It was probably used
only to link the royal residence with the
neighbouring towns of the Delta, for the
craft which plied along the Nile were usually
equipped with collapsible masts. When they
travelled south, the north wind carried them
along, but on journeys north the mast was
lowered and the oars were used. There is
evidence of navigation on the open sea to the
cities of the Phoenician coast from the First
Dynasty onwards (c. 3000 BC). Representa¬
tions of single-masted vessels bearing mer¬
chandise from Syria are common in the Fifth
Dynasty. Heavy loads were transported on
special barges.
The transport by barge of palmiform col
umns lashed on to sledges is depicted on the
southern wall of the entrance to the funerary
temple of Unas (c. 2356-2323 BC), the last
king of the Fifth Dynasty. The obelisks of
Queen Hatshcpsut (c. 1503-1482 BC) arc
shown being carried by barge in the southern
portico of the lower terrace of her temple at
Deir el-Bahri. The two obelisks lie side by
side, the pointed end of one towards the
prow of the barge and that of the other
towards the stern, held in place by ropes. A
fleet of twenty-seven boats tows the barge,
which is accompanied by a pilot vessel.
For the transport of the northern colossus
of Memnon, weighing some 800 tons, an
architect of genius, Amenhotpc son of
Hapu, overseer of the Temple of Luxor and
of the funerary temple of Amcnophis III
near Thebes, built a special boat in approx¬
imately 1350 BC which he named the "Boat
of Eight", a name which seems to signify that
it was eight times larger than a normal barge.
However, the biggest technical problem
must have arisen when the megalith was
being loaded on to the barge, and later when
it was unloaded at Thebes. We know that
One of the boats which formed part of the
funerary equipment of the Pharaoh Khufu
(Cheops, c. 2551-2528 BC) and may have been
intended to enable him to voyage in the next
world. The cedar craft, over 40 m long, has been
reassembled from dismantled sections
unearthed in 1954 close to the Great Pyramid.

The Step Pyramid at Saqqara, last resting place
of King Djoser (c. 2630-261 1 BC). This six-
stepped white limestone monument, 60 m in
»height, is the earliest stone structure of its size
known to the world.

when obelisks were transported they were
hauled down ramps as far as a canal dug
specially to connect the quarry to the Nile. A
similar process was probably used for the
transport of the colossal statue of Memnon.
Laden with ballast of stone or brick, the
barge would wait, low in the water of the
canal. The obelisk or colossus would be
heaved on board and lashed horizontally on
a sledge, then the ballast would be unloaded,
whereupon the barge would rise to the sur¬
face and could be towed along.
Over short distances it was possible to
haul a load of some 60 tons along a smoothed
out track, as is shown by the famous repre¬
sentation of the transport by sledge of a
colossal statue of the nomarch1 Djehuti-
hotpe in his tomb at Deir el-Bersha. The
alabaster colossus, 13 cubits high according
to the inscriptions, must have weighed as
much as this. Wedged in place on an enor¬
mous wooden sledge and held down with
ropes, it is being dragged along by 172 men,
four abreast. Holding a pitcher, a workman
perched on the feet of the colossus is pouring
water in front of the sledge to make it slide
more easily along the clay-coated track.
Obelisks, guided by strong ropes, were
probably slid down a ramp built of unfired
bricks and sand towards a quadrangular
shaft filled with sand. While the obelisk,
leaning at an angle, was still held by the
ropes, workmen emptied the sand out of the
shaft, or the sand was allowed to run out
through slots in the walls of the shaft. When,
with much careful manoeuvring, the obelisk
was set upright on its base, there was a risk of
damaging its edges. Above all, its enormous
mass might wobble on its plinth and settle
off-centre, so that the edges of its base were
not parallel to the edges of the plinth. An
accident of this kind must have happened to
the obelisk of Tuthmosis III at Karnak,
although the error of alignment with the
plinth was minute and is scarcely visible.
However, the most extraordinary feats
were those of monumental construction. As
early as the Second Dynasty (c. 2770-2649
BC), Egyptian architects were familiar with
vaulting, and used it in the superstructure of
tombs and doubtless also in dwellings which
have not survived. During the same dynasty,
facing stone was increasingly used in brick
funerary monuments, and dressed stone
blocks were introduced. The crowning in¬
novation, however, took place under King
Djoser, towards the beginning of the Third
Dynasty (c. 2649 BC) in Saqqara, part of the
necropolis of the ancient city of Memphis,
with the first stone monumental construc¬
tion, the Step Pyramid, which took some
thirty years to build. The various stages in its
construction show how Egyptian architects,
in a single generation, gained mastery over
the new building material.
During the first construction phase of the
original step mastaba2, stone seems to have
been used exactly as if it were brick. Blocks
of stone, designed like large bricks, were
arranged in horizontal layers and cemented
with crude clay mortar. A different tech¬
nique emerged in the second phase, marking
the change from step mastaba to step pyra¬
mid. The mass of the dressed stone blocks
was far greater. Each one weighed half a ton.
They were arranged with the lie of the stone
sloping inwards towards the heart of the
edifice at an angle of 18", so that their outer
surface already had the angle of incline of
72" to be found in its final phase in the
enlarged pyramid.
The use of large blocks and the sloping
arrangement of the rows were brilliant in¬
novations which led to a considerable saving
in time and the labour of stonecutting, since
it was no longer necessary to chamfer the
outer surface of the facing blocks, and the
desired angle of incline was more easily
obtained. This technique would not be aban¬
doned until the final form of the pyramid
was attained during the following dynasty.
A steeper inclination of 45" to 54" lent itself
to the use of horizontal layers and again
made it necessary to chamfer the outer sur¬
face of the facing blocks.
The building of a pyramid confronted the
State with great technical and administrative
problems. The organization of large num-

bers of workers, prospection for quarries
and the extraction of stone, the regular trans¬
port of blocks of stone to the stonemasons'
yards and their storage, the training of
stonecutters, building workers, transport
specialists, architects and foremen all these
achievements testify to the impressive ad¬
ministrative system of ancient Egypt.
From the construction of the Step
Pyramid of King Djoser to that of the Great
Pyramid at Giza (c. 2550 BC), which was
numbered among the seven wonders of the
world, considerable advances were made in
technical and geometrical expertise. Ancient
Egyptian funerary monuments are always
oriented with extraordinary precision. The
orientation of the Step Pyramid shows an
average deviation of 3", but the deviation of
the Great Pyramid is no more than 3'6". A
perfect orientation was obtained on pre-
levelled ground by observing the polar stars
from a fixed point at the northern corner of
the future pyramid. The instruments used
were the merkhet, a horizontal bar equipped
with a plumbline, and the bay, a wooden rod
with a sighting notch in its upper end. On the
arc of a circle, the positions of the rising and
setting of a north star were marked. To find
true north the Egyptians halved the angle
formed by the position of a polar star when it
rose, the position of the observer, and the
position of the same star when it set. Once
true north had been found, a string connect¬
ing various fixed points on the north-south

out of the shaft and the obelisk manoeuvred

axis made it possible to determine one side of
the pyramid. With the aid of measuring rods,
the desired length was marked out. A right
angle was obtained by means of a set of
protractors. If Pythagoras' theorem on the
relationship between the sides of a triangle
had not yet been formulated, it was certainly
applied in practice.
The precision of the right angles of the
Great Pyramid, with an average deviation of
only 2' 48", is still, today, worthy of admir¬
ation, as is the horizontal alignment of its
four corners, with a fractional divergence
of 2.1 centimetres. The alignment must have
been achieved by means of a level in the form
of a large wooden setsquare equipped with a
plumbline which hung between its two equal
arms joined at a right angle (see drawings
p. 15). Connecting these two arms was a
horizontal crossbar with a median notch
into which the string of the weight fitted
when the level was held perfectly horizontal.
All other theories, such as that of filling an
artificial lake around the pyramid, must be
rejected.
There are no ancient descriptions of build¬
ing methods as such. The reports of

well as architect, Imhotep is thought to have
written the earliest collections of the maxims or
didactic "wisdom texts" which constitute one of
the richest genres of ancient Egyptian writing.
In the Late Dynastic Period (c. 713-332 BC),
some 2,000 years after his death, he was deified

Greeks identified him with their god of
medicine, Asclepius.

Herodotus on this subject are based on in¬
formation supplied by his contemporaries
who, 2,000 years after the building of the
pyramids, probably knew no more than we
do. Near the pyramids of Maidum and
Dahshur, the remains of the ramps used to
transport the stone building materials can
still be seen today. The hypothesis that a
single ramp, perpendicular to one of the
faces of the pyramid, could have been used to
transport the building blocks to the top of
the pyramid and position them has now been
superseded. For the Great Pyramid, such a
ramp would have been 3.3 kilometres long
and its mass would have been 3.5 times grea¬
ter than that of the pyramid itself. The use of
a spiralling ramp is difficult to imagine from
a technical point of view, since it would have
concealed the four faces of the pyramid and
its four corners, making it impossible to
control the angles and the slope of the faces.
It is more likely that a number of small
ramps were built around the pyramid right at
the start, so that blocks could be hauled up
them to a height of 25 or 30 metres. By this
stage, 50 per cent of the mass was already in
place. Then a larger lateral ramp, resting
against one of the faces, could have been used
to transport stones up to a point near the top
"of the pyramid. Such a ramp could dispense
with half the mass of a free-standing ramp
and would also be more stable. In the case of
the Great Pyramid, for example, which is
146.6 metres high, 96 per cent of the mass
would be in place at a height of 100 metres.
The last 20 or 30 metres probably called for
a stepped construction. The pyramidion, or
capstone, could only have been put in posi¬
tion by means of scaffolding, which indi¬
cates that the Egyptians were familiar with
pulleys, even if no depiction of this system
has survived. The use of simpler leverage
devices and sledges has been recorded. Illus¬
trations of irrigation work depict the shaduf,
a hand-operated weight-arm for raising
water. This system may well have been used
to lift building materials.
It is remarkable that the greatest scientific,
technical and artistic breakthroughs, not
only for the history of Egyptian civilization
but for the history of humanity as a whole,
from the discovery of writing to advances in
medicine, evidently took place in the first
half of the third millennium BC. The follow¬
ing centuries only built on and perfected this
knowledge. No innovations were made to
broaden the scientific and technical horizons
until the advent of the Greek philosophers in
the seventh and sixth centuries BC.

The Egyptian world-picture
BY JEAN YOYOTTE
THE huge temples and enormous funer¬
ary monuments of ancient Egypt
with their profusion of hieroglyphs
are a source of amazement to the modern
mind, which cannot easily grasp their useful¬
ness or significance. The ancient Greeks, so
much closer in time to them, considered the
Pyramids of Giza to be an absurd and
oppressive show of royal pride. However,
these monuments retain their majesty and
cease to tower quite so disturbingly over us
once we see them as an expression of the
conceptions that the Egyptians had formed
of their universe and of the answers that
those conceptions provided to the problems
of their society, reflecting ways of thinking
and of acting that are at once strange and
familiar.
That which is larger than life cannot be
brought down to human proportions by
means of a linear approach. Several different
images, several different sacred accounts,
taken together may help us to understand the
same processes or phenomena. The im¬
penetrable sky is an ocean, a roof, a cow, a
woman's body. Any image rooted in tradi¬
tion is relevant, despite its apparently con¬
tradictory features, and serves as a means of
apprehending, coming to terms with, the
world of the gods.
These differing approaches are often ex¬
pressed through a dualistic way of thinking
in which the whole may be reduced to the
opposition and association of two qualities,
exemplified by the twofold characteristic of
the monarchy twofold on two accounts
by the black earth and the desert, and by
Upper and Lower Egypt. In addition, lan¬
guage, writing and images are not to be
confused with conventional symbols. Be-

name, is a duplication of that person. An
almost maniacal passion for giving lasting
verbal and graphic expression to reality in
order to shore it up by means of a supreme
form of magic is a hallmark of Pharaonic
culture and accounts for its extraordinary
monuments and inscriptions.
The horizon of the Egyptians stretches
from the narrow strip of black earth (kernet,
from which derives Kemi, the Coptic name
for Egypt) constituted by the flat alluvial
valley of the Nile, to the red earth (desheret)
of the immense Sahara all around, with its
arid hills. "The Black Land" is the home of
human beings, a place for the growing of
crops, familiar and reassuring. "The Red
Land" is terrible and strange. Aggressive
bands of backward people are its denizens
and from that area invaders come, whether
from afar or from nearby. But in addition,
the desert offers no escape, with its horizons
where the sun is born and dies; its unchang¬
ing rocks and pure sands are welcoming to
the dead and are the scene of invisible re¬
births. An infinite liquid mass surrounds the
solid universe, appearing on the face of the
Earth in the form of the seas. This water
constitutes the celestial vault where the stars
follow their courses. It flows into the under¬
ground river, where the sun sails from west
to east during the night, and each year it
produces a new tidal flow in the form of the
flood waters of the Nile.
Peopled with mysterious, somnolent
beings, this ocean and the world of darkness
filled the whole of space until the day when
the sun, Re-Atum, rose up, pushing back the
dense gloom to the periphery. A mound
emerged from which the god gave shape to
the present world, breathing air, light and
life into it, while at the same time having to
combat the forces of the void. He then cre¬
ated gods and men, animals and plants. This
was to be but the "first occasion". Every
evening, the sun god grows old, and every
morning, rejuvenated and purified in the
waters, he recreates the universe and joins
battle; every day the dragon Apopis
threatens the sun in his course. A rebellion
on the part of mankind caused Re to take
flight into the skies, but he continues to see
to the maintenance of order, Maat, which he
established and which is his life. Living
beings are destined to grow old and become
young again here on Earth, in accordance
with a perpetual time cycle (neheh), like the
sun, until the day when, touched by the
finger of death, they enter a static eternity
(djet) like Osiris. When Atum returns to his
original state of passivity, both space and
time will cease to exist.
Several different myths and doctrines, re¬
flecting the diversity of approaches and
claims from one locality to another, recount
in their own ways the work of the one and
only demiurge. According to the predomi¬
nant doctrine, originating in Heliopolis, it
was Re-Atum who set things in their places,
but the priests of Memphis believed that it
was Ptah, the Earth, who was the first to
appear and who then placed the sky on high
and brought forth the sun. The scholars
maintained that God conceived the universe
in his heart (i.e. in his mind) and brought it
into being through his mouth (i.e. his
creative word).
In Pharaonic times sexual duality was con¬
sidered to be an inherent part of the process
of life, long before the hymns of the New
Kingdom praised God as the father and
mother. Two myths, that of Kamutef and
that of the "Eye of Re", reveal the place of
woman. Each major god is flanked by a
female companion who is at once his daught¬
er, his wife and his mother. He is brought
into the world by this goddess and he makes
her pregnant, being his own son and the

"Bull of his Mother" (Kamutef). This female
companion is also his eye, the source of
flames and light, who went away from him in
anger and whom he had to pacify. An image
of the ambivalence of the sacred, she is the
good Hathor, desire and joy, and the danger¬
ous Sakhmet, a leonine agent of calamity and
a cobra who may strike against enemies and
sinners.
Two divine couples born of the demiurge
represent the ordering of the physical uni¬
verse: air and light-fire; and earth and sky.
The following generation, ncaring man's
estate, had to contend with human dramas in
the shape of power struggles and death.
Osiris, slain by Seth, found new life through
Isis and Nephthys, and gained sovereignty
over death and the dead. His posthumous
son Horus assumed rule of the Earth by
defeating his uncle Seth. The latter, a
troublemaker who was not to be seen as a
supreme satanic force until later periods, is
an ambiguous figure. His divine violence is
an inescapable fact, causing life to open onto
eternity and serving to help Re and the
Pharaoh to vanquish foreigners and the dra¬
gon of the void, thus giving rise to conflict¬
ing legends. For instance, power is said to be
shared between Horus, the master of the
black earth, and Seth, the master of the red
earth; or Seth is described as the king of the
South and Horus as the king of the North,
forming together an indissoluble confeder¬
ation; or again, and most frequently, Horus
is depicted as expelling Seth and ruling alone
over the organized world.
This entanglement of ideas and images
underpinned a political theology that

marked Egyptian history and culture so
strongly at that time that they arc legitimate¬
ly designated by historians as Pharaonic, the
word "Pharaoh", transmitted to us by the
Bible, being a specific term for the king of
Egypt. The king was the representative of
the divine order and epitomized in himself
alone the forces of economic, social and
political life. The incarnation of Horus since
the earliest times, the son of Re since the
period of the great pyramids, the "perfect
god" fulfilled the role of gods whose image,
heir and servant he was. In him Horus and
Seth were united. His coming marked the
coming of Horus and at the same time the
reappearance of the sun and the beginning of
a new era. He maintained Maat among man¬
kind and ensured security by driving back
the barbarians and imposing Egyptian rule
beyond the Nile Valley. He was the sole
repository of that supernatural force which
ensured victory and political wisdom. He
alone issued decrees and was responsible for
appointments to every single post. Initiated
into the mysteries and highly cultivated, he
kept the gods alive through the arts and
through ritual.
The doctrinal foundations for the legi¬
timacy of kings lay not in heredity but in
immediate predestination, a choice made by
God, illustrated by the fiction of his procrea¬
tion by the god himself (myth of theogamy).
Once he had taken possession of the crowns
and affixed the cobra on his forehead, the
new Horus took up his place among the
gods. He would pass into eternity as a super¬
natural being. His tomb, along with the cere¬
monies accompanying his burial, reflected
this difference that existed between him and
the rest of humanity, exemplified by the
pyramids of the Old and New Kingdoms
with their vast royal temples, and the rock-
cut tombs of the Valley of the Kings and the
"Million-Year Castles" of the New
Kingdom. One of the few social conquests
achieved by ordinary people throughout the
course of Egyptian history was the democra¬
tization of funerary privileges, which were
extended to common mortals during each of
the Intermediate Periods, when the central
authority weakened. But each Kingdom that
restored the unity of the monarchy invented
further differentiations.
Ancient Egypt had no practical or theore-

tical understanding of democracy. It ele¬
vated to the highest degree, and integrated
into its cosmology, a system whereby all
human authority was delegated to a chief.
Not very inclined towards abstraction, the
"prephilosophical" Egyptian had no word
for State or for Nation, but invested the
person of the sun king with all the attributes
of the State. The various terms used to desig¬
nate the king did not apply to foreign
sovereigns and, in speaking of Pharaoh, the
early Egyptians internalized their national
feeling, although the storytellers were well
aware that Pharaoh as god shared the physic¬
al and moral weaknesses of our species.
Scribes and priests cultivated a spirit of
loyalty towards the monarchy and finally
attributed an ecumenical dimension to it
which made it easier to accept foreign mas
ters representing a universal empire: the
Persians Cambyses and Darius, Alexander
the Great, and the Roman Augustus.
This unified society whose sacred poems
sang of the unity of creation and the mystery
of the creator was at the same time radically
polytheistic and stubbornly idolatrous. The
Egyptian nation recognized all the gods re¬
vealed by the immemorial traditions of the
different localities. Each had its own names,
legends, major attributes and set images,
making it unique of its kind. Each city god
was revered by the local people whose lord
he was and whose happiness he ensured.
However, all the gods and goddesses were
simultaneously recognized as the father or
mother of the Pharaoh who kept them all
alive and expected to be protected by them.
With time, a form of logic came to be
introduced into this extensive pantheon
through the establishment of a hierarchy and
correspondences. The principal god of any
province was thus seen as a manifestation of
the sun, reflected in such names as
Amon-Re, Montu-Re and Sobek-Re. Ulti¬
mately, all the gods came to represent in
theory the manifestations or offspring of a
single, remote god, while their personalities
served on the occasion of State rituals and
local devotions as a medium for approaching
the divinity in its place of being, through its
manifestations. The enlightened reform of
the renowned Pharaoh Akhenaten, impos¬
ing the exclusive cult of the visible sun (the
Aten) could not have any lasting success,
especially since polytheism had profoundly
modelled not only the tolerant spirituality of
the Egyptians but also the economic and
social structures of the country.
What then was the place of men and
women in this universe where the whole of
collective life seemed to be understood and
managed in terms of communication be¬
tween a single flesh-and-blood being the
king and the multiplicity of gods? In com¬
parison with other Near Eastern peoples in
ancient times, Egypt was singularly modern.
Human beings were equal before the creator
and, as a general rule, owed their advance¬
ment purely to the judicious choice of the
Pharaoh. There existed neither statutory
aristocracy nor intermediate authority be¬
tween the State and the individual. A man
defined himself by the name of his parents
and by his title in the administrative appar¬
atus. The legal status of women was equal to
that of men, although marriage was patriloc-
al and the activity of wives centred on the
proud role that each one played as "Mistress
of the House". The pleasure taken in the joys
of the home are prettily expressed in tomb
drawings and inscriptions and in literature.
Children were desired and cared for, not in
order to perpetuate a line but because of the
happiness they brought and in order to en¬
able their parents to live again through the
funerary rites. In each village there was a
strong sense of community.
The "haves" were required by the precepts
of Maat to assist the "have-nots" and, as
early as the third millennium BC, the "wis¬
dom writings" of officials spoke of charity
and alms-giving in terms that foreshadow
Abrahamic religions. These wisdom writ¬
ings preach good manners, reserve, absence
of gesticulation, an entire discipline which is
typified in Pharaonic drawings and statuary.
The omnipresent mediation of the king by
no means ruled out direct relations between
individuals and the gods. Admittedly, ordin¬
ary people, unless performing the functions
of priests, did not enter the precincts of the
major temples, which were so to speak fac¬
tories for maintaining the energy of the uni¬
verse, but at the door of the sacred precincts,
in village oratories and in their inmost being
they prayed to the gods of their choice and
consulted their oracles in an effort to solve
their health and career problems. Moreover,
theories as to the power of names, writings
and images offered a magical means of

Wall painting in the oval-shaped sarcophagus
chamber of Tuthmosis III. It depicts a scene and
texts from the Book ofAmduat ("that which is
in the netherworld"), a religious composition
which describes the sun god's daily death and
rebirth and is often found in royal tombs of the
early New Kingdom. In this scene the sun god's
' bark has reached the 12th hour of the night,
when the god and his retinue enter into the
body of a giant snake which they will leave
rejuvenated as "young children".
The judgment after death, a detail from one of
the many funerary papyri placed in New
Kingdom tombs, which are today known as the
Book ofthe Dead. In this scene Anubis, the god
responsible for embalming and the lord of the
necropolis, weighs the deceased's heart in a
balance against Maat, correct conduct in life. To
his right, the moon god Thoth, symbol of
wisdom and justice, records the result. If the
heart and Maat are in equilibrium, the test is
successful, and the deceased is presented to
Osiris in triumph.
obtaining the favour of a god in one's life¬
time. A statue or stele set in a holy place
transformed the person who had erected it
into a regular companion of the god con¬
cerned and enabled an indirect benefit to be
gained from the offerings made to that god
by the king, thereby ensuring prosperity,
long life and the promise of a good burial.
For this was the one area in which the
Pharaonic world view gave men and women
the possibility of asserting themselves, avail¬
ing themselves of all the magical powers of
art, writing and ritual to ensure everlasting
life for their mummified remains, their
name, their mobile soul (ba) and their life
force (ka). They were offered eternal life,
and a truly royal life since each person was
transformed into Osiris; also, a truly divine
life since each became a companion of the
sun. From the time of the Middle Kingdom
onwards, this survival depended in each case
on the individual's morality. In the temples
Pharaoh alone may have represented and
spoken for humanity, but all Egyptians
could, according to their resources and
merits, express themselves through their
tombs.
The sons of Re reached their first zenith in
the third millennium BC. The Pharaonic
world view was given tangible expression in
the cities of pyramids, scattered through the
region of Memphis, at the junction of Upper
and Lower Egypt. During each successive
reign, a new crop-growing area was estab¬
lished in the valley, while a royal city was
built at the edge of the desert. This city
served a temple where the ruling king, the
incarnation of Horus, worshipped the gods.
The holy of holies of the temple was the
pyramid, representing the primordial
mound and the course of the sun in which
the new Osiris would be reborn. In the
surrounding area, filled with images of
everyday life, the tombs of the princes and
ministers, followed by those of the priests
and the keepers of the pyramids, formed a
city of the dead, above the city of the living.
A record of the conquest of the land, the
chain of pyramids was a reflection of the
ordering of the Egyptian cosmos before
being the illustrious, disconcerting collec¬
tion of mausoleums that we admire so much
today.

Daily life in the land
of the Pharaohs
BY CHRISTIANE DESROCHES-NOBLECOURT
EVEN the uninitiated traveller along the
banks of the Nile, studded as they
are with superb vestiges of
Pharaonic times, is immediately impressed
by the essential features of the luminous
civilization of ancient Egypt a profound
religious feeling that found expression in
immense temples and tombs, and an intense
and ardent love of life, endlessly recorded in
the painted or sculpted images that adorn the
inner walls of funerary monuments.
Study of these sources reveals that
Egyptian temples were never destined to
receive believers gathered to offer prayers to
an evocation of God. They were sanctuaries
designed primarily to maintain the cosmic
machinery through the meticulous atten¬
tions of the Pharaoh, who was the earthly
representative of divine power and purpose,
the supreme pontiff surrounded by a hierar¬
chy of priests. Ordinary people were denied
access to these sacred edifices. Imbued with
the divine, like "all that lives on land, in the
air, under the water" (the plant and mineral
worlds included), they recognized and wor¬
shipped their creator in all the manifesta¬
tions of Nature, without frequenting tem¬
ples. For them death was simply a threshold
which took them closer to god, and in their
funerary trappings they portrayed them¬
selves in the presence of the deities of the
underworld with which they would be in
direct contact until their complete incor¬
poration in eternity.
We should also take care not to misinter¬
pret what we see in the tombs. The captivat¬
ing scenes from daily life that adorn the walls
of burial chambers and some of the ritual
objects preserved in them should be seen in a
mystical light as symbolic images of the
"everyday" challenges and vicissitudes of
the journey through the Osirian underworld
from which the dead person would surely
emerge in triumph, winning access to
eternity.
These images are inspired by scenes from
everyday life on the banks of the Nile. A
funerary banquet incites the deceased to di¬
vine inebriation. A clump of papyrus reeds
recalls the primeval marshland in which he
must undergo gradual "gestation" as he
moves towards apotheosis. A depiction of
hunting the hippopotamus or trapping wild
ducks is meant to paralyse demons that may
block his path. Nets are set to catch the
mystic fish, the symbol of his destiny. Grain
is harvested and grapes are picked to make
offerings of bread and wine for Osiris. The
presence of a small calf symbolizes the sun's
renewal.
Through this lively and colourful panor¬
ama, designed for otherworldly purposes, it

reign of Akhenaten (New Kingdom, c. 1353-

traditional conventions of representation.

Wall painting from the tomb of the Vizier

deceased sailing in a papyrus skiff pulled by
haulers. The stretch of water, within a closed
garden, is surrounded by rows of sycamores and
date palms. Nature is widely represented in New

of subject, especially in the decoration of tombs.
is possible to grasp in broad outline the
context in which "the herd of god", as the
ancient Egyptians saw themselves, lived
their lives.
It is an almost entirely agrarian setting,
governed by what Julius Caesar (who
adopted it and imposed it on the Roman
world) termed "the greatest and most intelli¬
gent of calendars". This calendar was deter¬
mined by the inundation of the Nile, which
occurred every 365 V4 days to cover and fer¬
tilize the drought-parched lands of Egypt
(which had no other watercourse and vir¬
tually no rainfall).
The regularity of the annual flood had
determined since the earliest times the calen¬
dar of three four-month seasons, instilling in
the Egyptians, who were infinitely sensitive
to their environment, a profound and un-
shakeable faith in the principle of eternal
renewal.
Relations between men and women were
modelled on those which were deemed to
have governed the divine couples of "the
earliest times", and were characterized by
complete equality. Unlike women in many
of the societies of classical Antiquity, the
women of ancient Egypt enjoyed full legal
powers. Even a married woman could man¬
age her own fortune, share part of her hus¬
band's wealth and freely dispose of her own
property among her children. The married
woman was "Mistress of the House". She
advised her husband and contributed largely
to the prosperity of the household she man¬
aged. Cherished by her husband and re¬
spected by what she hoped would be a
numerous offspring, she was happy to feel
herself the pivot of the household and the
family circle. Parents accorded their atten¬
tion equitably to sons and daughters, not all
of whom (especially girls) seem to have re¬
ceived much formal schooling. Some girls
must, however, have undergone fairly
advanced instruction, since women were ad¬
mitted to certain posts in administration, in
commerce and even in the scientific profes¬
sions. The first woman doctor known to
history, Lady Pesechet, was in practice in
Memphis at the time of the pyramids, during
the third millennium BC.
Profoundly patriotic, the Egyptian was by
no means xenophobic. In early times prison¬
ers were taken during conflicts caused by the
need to defend the frontiers of "The Black
Land" (Kemi, as ancient Egypt was called),
but the Egyptians were fundamentally paci¬
fic people, for whom "war is a day of misfor¬
tune". Prisoners were humanely treated.
While they were often consigned to the sol¬
diers or officers who had captured them,
they could be set free and even permitted to
marry into the family of their captor. They
were free to worship their own gods.
As was still to some extent the case on the
banks of the Nile at the beginning of this

century, marriage was sanctioned neither by
a religious ceremony nor by an administra¬
tive act. An agreement made before a witness
by a man and a woman wishing to start a
family was a commitment of great moral
significance. On occasion, a deed might be
drawn up to specify the personal property of
each partner. The purpose of this was pri¬
marily to preserve the rights of the wife in
the event of divorce, which could be re¬
quested by either of the parties. Since di¬
vorce entailed forfeiture by the husband of
the wife's contribution (or of whatever he
had acknowledged to be her contribution) to
their joint fortune, it could prove a costly, if
not ruinous, process for him! All these conL
ditions, with the help of an admixture of
common sense, helped to maintain the sta¬
bility of marriage. *
The simplest dwellings always comprised
an enclosed courtyard leading to a commun¬
al living-room. Outbuildings were situated
behind the house. A staircase led from the
courtyard to a terrace, which was particular¬
ly appreciated as a place where the family
could spend the hot summer nights and en¬
joy a breath of cool air.
Remains of the residences of very wealthy
Egyptians have revealed a logical ground
plan that remained unchanged for thousands
of years. Like all other buildings except reli¬
gious monuments, which were constructed
in stone, a noble and durable material, such
dwellings were built in unbaked brick, made
of Nile mud mixed with straw and ash. Large
country mansions in vast estates comprised

three parts, corresponding to the require¬
ments of everyday life. A large entrance-hall
led to a central chamber whose high ceiling
was supported by one or by four columns.
Small windows high in the walls were fitted
with bars. Here were held the receptions and
festivities which the ancient Egyptians so
enjoyed. Side rooms served as stores, offices
or lodgings for secretaries or housekeepers.
A staircase led to a loggia running the length
of the entrance-hall.
The third part of the house was reserved
for family life, and included a central, more
intimate, communal living room, rooms
where the children worked and played dur¬
ing the cold days of winter and bedrooms.
An entire wing reserved for ablutions (inc¬
luding showers), anointings and personal
toilet and hygiene, was equipped with a sys¬
tem of drains.
These country estates, which functioned
as small, closed economics, were completed
by outbuildings housing kitchens, grain
silos, a bakery, butchery, brewery, and va¬
rious workshops, including one for weaving,
which was the major household activity of
women in all classes of society. Other
domestic activities, notably cooking (except
for making bread) were usually carried out
by the men. Asses were kept in the stables,
and so were horses, which were introduced
into Egypt during the New Kingdom and
were mainly used to pull the light chariots
that also originated in the Near East.
A garden planted with sycamores, weep¬
ing willows, tamarisks and palms, patch-
worked with flowerbeds and further deco¬
rated with trellised vines and a refreshing
pool of water, was the dream of every
Egyptian. In the towns, where space was
limited, gardens were smaller, surrounding
buildings of several storeys containing the
areas that occupied a single storey in the
country. The weavers' workshop was lo¬
cated in the cellar, which doubtless also pro¬
vided cold storage for foodstuffs and drink.

Agricultural scenes are depicted in the tomb of
the Theban surveyor Menna (18th Dynasty).
Below, threshing with cattle.
Kitchens and grain silos were situated on the
terrace level.
Boys, whether of humble or noble birth,
attended the temple school. One inscription
tells us of a poor boy who had been able to
"reach the feet of the Pharaoh thanks to his
writing tablet". Each day, the mothers took
thé master payment in the form of food.
Particularly promising pupils spent several
years within the temple precincts. Fami¬
liarization with the many hieroglyphic signs,
study of the written language and literature
and of arithmetic, geometry and geography,
all figured in secondary studies, at the con¬
clusion of which successful pupils earned the
title of "scribe who has obtained the tablet".
Appointment to an administrative post
followed. Particularly gifted students might
go on to higher studies in a "House of Life"
within the precincts of a temple, which prop¬
agated the teachings of great architects, sci¬
entists (medicine, pharmacology, chemistry,
astronomy or geometry) and men of letters,
as well as philosophy and the pursuit of
wisdom. Lessons were generally accompa¬
nied by practical exercises and laboratory
work.
At holiday time the whole population was
free to celebrate the great seasonal festivals
during which symbols of divinities were
brought from their sanctuaries and borne
through the crowds in sacred barks, amid the
excitement of processions and theatrical
performances.
The most important of these occasions
was, of course, the New Year, when the Nile
inundation covered the cultivable land and
freed the farmers from their work in the
fields. On this great day, and during the
weeks that followed, the people travelled
from village to village, visiting friends and
relations _ to pay together their respects to
revered ancestors and to the creator re¬
sponsible for the divine and providential
phenomenon that had occurred once again
to enrich the soil of Egypt.

' ISTORIC Egypt emerged as a unified
country, with its own system of
writing, towards the end of the
fourth millennium BC. It rapidly became
the seat of a brilliant civilization in which
flourished philosophy and literature,
architecture and art, science and medicine,
administration and social organization.
From ancient times, thanks to the country's
situation on the Mediterranean coast, the
Egyptians made increasingly numerous con¬
tacts with Europe. The contribution made
by Egypt to Western culture enriched civi¬
lization as a whole.
Around the same time, the Minoan civi¬
lization (named after Minos, the legendary
king), came into being on the shores of the
Aegean, centred on the island of Crete.
Although the Mediterranean was no
obstacle between Egypt and the Aegean,
contacts between Egyptian and Aegean trad¬
ers and emissaries were made first of all in the
Phoenician coastal ports, Byblos in particu¬
lar. Egyptian trading vessels no doubt set sail
from these ports to Crete, and called at
Cyprus, Rhodes, Karpathos and Kasos be¬
fore returning directly to Egypt (some
270 nautical miles from Crete), carried along
by the north winds that blow in summer.
The voyage then took three days and
two nights.
There is no lack of archaeological evidence
for relations between the two peoples. Many
Egyptian cylindrical stone jars have been
found in Crete and eventually the Cretans
adopted the Egyptian technique of manufac¬
turing these jars. On the island of Kithira, an
alabaster vase has been found bearing the
name of an Egyptian king of the Fifth
Dynasty (c. 2465-2323 BC). From the
twenty-second century BC, Egyptian writ¬
ings began to mention Kaftiou, an Egyptian
adaptation of the Semitic name for Crete,
Caphtor, which also appears in the Bible.
At the beginning of the second millen¬
nium BC, there was a thriving trade between
Middle Kingdom Egyptians and Cretans of
the period known as Middle Minoan. Many
Egyptian objects from that era, including
everyday utensils, scarabs used as seals and a
diorite statuette, have been found in Crete,
while Minoan pottery in the Kamares style,
and silver vases showing an Aegean in¬
fluence, have been discovered in a temple
near Luxor.
Around 1500 BC, Egypt cast off the yoke

of the Hyksos1 and emerged from its tradi¬
tional isolationism to become an interna¬
tional power, strengthened by a series of
military victories. Phoenicia and Syria fell
under its sway, and the Egyptian fleet con¬
trolled the Phoenician ports, probably ex¬
tending its influence as far as Cyprus. This
Egyptian presence created a new situation in
the eastern Mediterranean basin. The
Aegeans of the Late Minoan period and the
Mycenaeans of Hellas2 had thereafter to deal
directly with the Egyptians if their merchant
ships were to have access to the traditional
markets of Palestine and Syria. In all prob¬
ability, the Cretans and the Mycenaeans
came to an agreement with the powerful
Pharaoh Tuthmosis III (c. 1479-1425 BC).
The tomb of his vizier Rekhmire, at the
necropolis of Thebes, depicts Cretan emis¬
saries bearing tribute from their island. The
Egyptian inscription describes the scene:
"The arrival of the princes from Kaftiou and

the islands in the midst of the sea, submissive
and with bowed heads before the might of
His Majesty Tuthmosis III". There is every
reason to believe that these "islands in the
midst of the sea" were those of the eastern
Mediterranean and the city of Mycenae in
the Péloponnèse.
Brown-skinned Aegeans, wearing bright¬
ly coloured loincloths and with thick manes
of hair hanging to their shoulders or worn in
one or more plaits bound around their fore¬
heads, became a familiar sight to the
Egyptians as they threaded through the
streets of Thebes to bear their gifts, called
"tribute" by the Egyptians, to Pharaoh:
large, ornate goblets with handles shaped
like animals, or elongated vases with small
handles, decorated with floral motifs or
horizontal polychrome lines.
Towards the middle of the fifteenth cen¬
tury BC, the Cretan civilization foundered,
probably as a result of internal power strug¬
gles. Small wonder, then, that the name of
Kaftiou should have disappeared from
Egyptian sources after the end of that cen¬
tury. However the expression "islands in the
midst of the sea" continues to occur fre¬
quently in these writings, before dis¬
appearing, in its turn, in the twelfth
century BC, when successive waves of the
barbarians known to the Egyptians as the
"sea peoples" were surging into the
Péloponnèse peninsula and wreaking havoc.
These hordes crossed Anatolia (where they
annihilated the Hittites) and Greece, and
advanced on Egypt overland across Syria
and by sea via the Mediterranean islands. But
they were repelled by such powerful
Pharaohs as Ramesses II, Merneptah and
Ramesses III, who saved Egypt from des¬
truction on a massive scale.
The Greek presence in Egypt made itself
felt in the early seventh century BC through
mercenaries serving in the Egyptian armies
and merchants who set up trading posts in
various towns of the Delta. Greek philo¬
sophers, historians and geographers fol¬
lowed them, dazzled by Egyptian civiliza¬
tion with its gigantic monuments, its beliefs
and its wealth of knowledge.

mathematician, Thaïes of Miletus, is said to

have brought back the 365-day solar calen¬
dar from Egypt at the end of the seventh
century BC. The Athenian statesman Solon
(c. 640-560 BC) visited Egypt at the time
when, according to Herodotus, the Six¬
teenth-Dynasty king Amasis II prom¬
ulgated a law under which each Egyptian
was obliged to make an annual declaration of
income and return it to the governor of the
province. Any person guilty of illicit gains
was condemned to death. Solon had an iden¬
tical law adopted in Athens. Another Greek
historian, Diodorus of Sicily, recounts that
Lycurgus (legendary king of Sparta) drew
inspiration from Egyptian legislation, as did
Plato.
Egypt's influence on early Greek art is
evident, too. The kouros figure of a young
man, characteristic of archaic statuary, has
an Egyptian air about it. The tall, slim youth
stands with his left leg forward, his arms held
straight by his sides and his hands clenched.
This type of statue not only imitates the
attitudes of Egyptian figures, but also abides
by the traditional rules governing Egyptian
art, in particular the "rule of proportion"
that its creators had been applying for over
2,000 years. The human body was originally
divided into 18 equal squares, and into 21
from the Saite3 period (seventh century BC),
when the unit of measurement of length, the
cubit, was modified. Diodorus of Sicily re¬
lates that in the sixth century BC Telekles
and Thcodorus, two famous Greek sculp¬
tors, drew on that tradition for a statue of
Apollo by dividing the body into
21 V4 squares.
Over the centuries, the Greeks became
increasingly involved in the history of
Egypt. In 332 BC, the country was con¬
quered by Alexander the Great, and a
Macedonian Dynasty was founded which
governed the country for some three centur¬
ies. Egypt became part of the Hellenistic
world encompassing the eastern basin of the
Mediterranean. Alexandria, the new
Egyptian capital founded by the Greeks,
brought fresh prestige to Hellenism through
its writers, geographers, historians, archi¬
tects and astronomers.
When the Roman general Marcus
Antonius, ally of Cleopatra VII, lost the
battle of Actium in 31 BC, Egypt became a
Roman province. As the granary of Rome it
helped to supply the Roman army during its
major conquests.
As regards religion, the cult of Isis and
Osiris (Serapis, in its Ptolemaic form), and of
their son Horus-Harpocrates, was widely
adopted in the Graeco-Roman world. The
legend of Osiris, based on belief in the after¬
life of the soul in a better world, has strong
popular appeal, since it promises salvation to
all, a concept lacking in the official worship
of the Greek and Roman divinities. To the
Greeks, Isis was the incarnation of destiny,
since she succeeded in freeing herself from
the control of the gods and thereby acquired
absolute power. The Isis cult in Rome corn-

pcted with the Roman religion and emperor-
worship. Moreover, the Osirian triad fore¬
shadowed the Christian trinity. Before the
advent of Christianity, Isis-worship in
Europe became as prevalent as the later cult
of the Virgin Mary.
The world also owes the invention of the
calendar and the alphabet to the ancient
Egyptians.
Like other peoples, the Egyptians first
devised a dating system which divided time
into lunar years of 354 days. But before long
they realized that it was not sufficiently
accurate and was unsuited to the organiza¬
tion of their complex bureaucratic system, so
it fell into disuse except for the celebration of
certain religious events. Around 3000 BC
they invented a solar calendar of 365 days
divided into twelve months of thirty days
each, to which at the end of the year were
added five extra, or "epagomenal", days. The
Egyptians knew that their year was six hours
shorter than tjie solar year (365 '/4 days), but
for a long time they did nothing to remedy
this discrepancy. Only under Greek rule did
they begin to add one day to the official year
every four years, to bring it into alignment
with the solar year. That calendar was
adopted by Julius Caesar and imposed in
Rome from 45 BC. The Julian calendar was
used in Europe and the West until, at the end
of the sixteenth century, it was refined by
Pope Gregory XIII and, as the Gregorian
calendar, became known throughout the
world.
Towards the end of the fourth millennium
BC, the Egyptians invented a system of writ¬
ing which used hieroglyphic signs, i.e. pic¬
tures, rather than letters. These pictures were
chosen, not for their meaning, but for the
sounds that they represented.
It is true that the modern European
alphabet is derived from the Graeco-Roman
alphabet, which is directly based on the
Phoenician alphabet. But what system of
writing influenced the Phoenicians? The
oldest Semitic texts known to us date back to
the fifteenth century BC. They were disco¬
vered in the Sinai desert, and contain Semitic
terms transcribed with signs that resemble
hieroglyphs. It is very likely that this Semitic
writing was based on hieroglyphs, using a
system of pictured sounds, and that it de¬
veloped over several centuries into the
Phoenician alphabet, in which each sound is
represented by a single letter. It seems prob¬
able, therefore, that the alphabet, one of the
greatest achievements of the human mind, is
of Egyptian origin.

Pharaonic art
and the modern
imagination
BY RICHARD A. FAZZINI
/ " ;#

c
THE sense of identity underlying
Egypt's nationalist movement was
enhanced by the archaeological re¬
discovery of ancient Egypt, a fact reflected in
such works as Cairo's partially pharaoniciz-
ing sculpture The Awakening of Egypt by
Mahmoud Mokhtar (1891-1934), and in the
use of ancient Egyptian history in the early
allegorical novels of the modern writer Najib
Mahfüz.
These uses of elements of ancient
Egyptian history and art might have seemed
familiar to the Pharaohs of the early New
Kingdom (sixteenth century BC) who ex¬
pelled the Hyksos the so-called "shepherd
kings from the East" and reunited the
country. Viewing themselves as heirs to the
kings of the early Middle Kingdom (late
twenty-first to early twentieth century BC)
when Egypt was reunited after the collapse
of the Old Kingdom, they established close
religious and archaizing artistic links be¬
tween themselves and their early Middle
Kingdom "ancestors". In fact, ancient
Egyptian civilization, while sufficiently evo¬
lutionary to permit incredible artistic
change, was also sufficiently resistant to
change to ensure amazing artistic continuity,
and encompassed concepts that could allow
the past to be a viable model for the present.
This also helps to explain how Egyptian
art of the fourth century BCand later, which
included the native Twenty-ninth and Thir¬
tieth Dynasties (399-343 BC), was a blend of
the traditional and the innovative. Among
the features of that era's art was a greater
fullness in figurai style, a greater penchant
for animal figures, a plethora of figures of
gods and of religious symbols, and more
complex forms and decoration in general. It
was this later Egyptian art especially that
spread throughout the Hellenistic and
Roman world, via the diffusion of Egyptian
cults. In Italy and Rome in particular, ob¬
jects imported from Egypt were sup¬
plemented by new Egyptianizing works
made to serve cults that also partook of
non-Egyptian elements, to reflect imperial
glory, or simply to decorate houses and
gardens.
With the fall of Rome and the rise of
Christianity and Islam, ancient Egypt en¬
tered the realm of the unknown, mysterious
and fabulous. It remained there even when
Egypt's rediscovery was begun in the Re¬
naissance, because the rediscovcrcrs were
concerned, for example, with ideas of links
between Christian doctrine and the wisdom
or magic of ancient Egypt. Further, the Re¬
naissance's main sources for the study of
ancient Egypt were the Egyptian and
Egyptianizing objects from Italy and Rome.
The former were hardly representative of
ancient Egypt in general, and the latter
varied greatly in the degree of adherence to
Egyptian norms.

One especially important discovery was
the Roman Period Mensa Isiaca, so called
because it resembles the top of a table (mensa
in Italian) and because its iconography re¬
lates it to the cult of Isis. Made of bronze and
silver, it is decorated with images of
Egyptian deities and symbols, as well as
hieroglyphs which are imperfectly under¬
stood. Like sculptures similar to the second
century AD Egypto-classical figure of the
Emperor Hadrian's favourite, Antinous,
found at Tivoli in 1740, the Mensa Isiaca
became a source for Egyptianizing elements
in the art of the Renaissance. In part because
they went on being presented as fine sources
for such endeavours, they and other
Egyptian and Roman Egyptianizing works
continued to play a role in Egyptian studies
and Egyptianizing art in the Western world,
despite increased interest in, and firsthand
knowledge of, Egypt in the seventeenth and,
especially, in the eighteenth centuries.
Nevertheless, in the eighteenth century
several non-scientific developments also led
to greater interest in ancient Egypt, and also
increased its influence on Western arts.
These developments included the growing
importance of Freemasonry, the concept of
the Sublime (the ability of art and
architecture to induce emotional reactions
such as amazement and dread) and emerging
Neoclassicism's concern for grandeur, sim¬
plicity and massiveness.
Such concepts informed the reconstruc¬
tions of Egyptian temples by the French
painter and designer Louis François Cassas,
published in 1799, and the schemes for vast
Egyptianizing monuments by architects
such as Etienne-Louis Boullée (1728-1799),
also of France. Equally significant, but in a
very different vein, are the drawings of extra¬
vagantly Egyptianizing rooms and fireplaces
Above, the Grande Pyramide, an engraving by the French artist Louis-François
Cassas (1756-1827). The entire'composition is a Romantic fantasy combining an
Old Kingdom pyramid with a temple of much later date, and an approach lined
with very un-Egyptian sphinxes. In the background is an equally un-Egyptian
mountain landscape. Above right, a glass and steel pyramid has been erected above
the main entrance and reception area of the Louvre Museum, Paris, as part of a
modernization programme. The structure, designed by the American architect
I.M. Pei, was completed in 1988.
by the Italian printmaker and architect
Giambattista Piranesi, published in 1769.
Based to no small extent on late Egyptian
and Roman Egyptianizing art, they consti¬
tute a major attempt to create an
Egyptianizing style instead of using indi¬
vidual motifs. Indeed, Piranesi was among
the first to appreciate Egyptian art for its
decorative beauty as opposed to its majesty
or mystery. Europe was thus already in¬
volved with ancient Egypt when the
Napoleonic Expedition to Egypt of 1798-
1801 ushered in the first and largest of what
would be many Egyptian revivals, between
which interest in Egypt has never really
vanished.
The Napoleonic Expedition also initiated
Egypt's archaeological rediscovery, which
led to scholars' growing ability to recon¬
struct Egypt's history and civilization more
accurately, and to understand and appreciate
the art of all its ages. It also made possible
more accurate Egyptianizing in literature,
art, architecture, stage sets and the like.
Nevertheless, this did not happen all at once,
as evidenced, for example, by the figure in
the 1808 Egyptianizing fountain in the rue
de Sèvres, Paris, that is based on the statue of
Antinous discovered in 1740. If newly dis¬
covered, older Egyptian models appeared
alongside long-familiar later ones, they did

not supplant them: it is the business of scho¬
lars, not artists, to attempt to recreate ancient
civilizations totally and accurately.
In the twentieth century a number of fac¬
tors, not all new, fostered a greater know¬
ledge and appreciation of ancient Egypt and
its art: archaeological discoveries (especially
Tutankhamun's tomb); exhibitions of
Egyptian art, some of which, . like the
Tutankhamun finds, have inspired Egyptian
revivals in various areas; increased tourism
to Egypt; more mass education; and an en¬
hanced Western respect for non-Western
art. As in the nineteenth century, Egyptian
art continues to influence serious architects,
artists and designers in manners other than
slavish imitation.
However, other aspects of ancient Egypt's
culture, real or imagined, continue to fascin¬
ate and influence the West. In fact, even
before the great age of commercial motion
pictures, plays, operas (especially Aida), his¬
torical novels, and fantasy and horror novels
(Egyptian themes start in the nineteenth cen¬
tury, well before the "curse" of Tutankha¬
mun's tomb was world news) gave some
version of the culture to the public. Adver¬
tising and packaging for a variety of pro¬
ducts, particularly cigarettes and beauty pro¬
ducts, also have had their influence.
Both symptom and cause of interest in
ancient Egypt, Hollywood and its allies
have, from the beginning, used spectacles
based on Egyptian themes to attract a wider
audience, once again with varying degrees of
historical or artistic accuracy. Other impor¬
tant influences on popular conceptions or
misconceptions of ancient Egypt and its art
are television, American comic books (not
always aimed solely at children), and their
more sophisticated French counterparts. A
number of the latter dealing with Egypt
combine impressively accurate drawings of
modern Egypt and its ancient monuments
with equally impressive Egyptianizing
fantasies.
The mass media, heirs not only to early
Hollywood but also to the works of the
eighteenth and nineteenth centuries, per¬
petuate old and new myths about ancient
Egypt such as its descent from Atlantis, the
influence of beings from outer space, and
"pyramid power".
An impressive recent example of
Egyptianizing in popular media are the post¬
er and cover for the record album Power-
slave by the group Iron Maiden. Its design
would have been impossible without the
temples of Abu Simbel, widely publicized by
Unesco's campaign to save the monuments
of Nubia. The image, however, is not really
Abu Simbel, but rather a theatrical
Egyptianizing fantasy evocative of many
popular associations of Egypt in the modern
mind.
One thing seems certain: ancient Egypt
and its art may come to be better understood
and appreciated, but the land of the
Pharaohs, of which the ancient Greek histo¬
rian Herodotus said "more monuments
which beggar description are to be found
here than anywhere else in the world", will
continue to be a source of many wonders and
fantasies only somewhat reflective of ancient
reality.

From the Nubian campaign to the Library ofAlexandria
Unesco and the ancient
Egyptian heritage
BY GAMAL MOKHTAR
THE Campaign to Save the Monuments
of Nubia was the most spectacular
demonstration of Unesco's concern
for the legacy of ancient Egypt, and its suc¬
cess was the most striking example of inter¬
national understanding and world solidarity
in the field of cultural co-operation and the
preservation of the heritage.
When the Egyptian Government began to
study a project for building a High Dam to
the south of the city of Aswan in order to
develop and modernize the country's eco¬
nomy and decided to execute the project
in 1954, it became apparent that Egypt and
the Sudan had a major cultural problem on
their hands: dozens of temples and
archaeological sites and areas in Nubia were
in danger of being submerged by the waters
of the vast artificial lake that would be
formed behind the High Dam. The lake,
which would be 25 kilometres wide in some
areas, would extend over 300 kilometres up
the Nile Valley in Egyptian Nubia and some
200 kilometres into Sudanese Nubia.
Two examples indicate the scale of the
problem. The first concerns the two temples
of Abu Simbel, 270 kilometres south of
Aswan. The base of the larger temple stood
124 metres and that of the smaller temple
122 metres above sea level. The temples lay
upstream of the old Aswan Dam, which had
been constructed around the turn of the
century, but as the water level of the reser¬
voir created by this dam never exceeded
121 metres, no part of the two temples was
ever submerged by its waters. After the con¬
struction of the High Dam, however, the
water level would rise to 1 82 metres, exceed
ing the highest level reached by the waters of
the old Aswan Dam by 62 metres and sub¬
merging the two temples completely.
The second example is that of the temples
which stood on the island of Philae,
1 04 metres above sea level to the south of the
old Aswan Dam and to the north of the High
Dam. The Philae temples were submerged
almost totally by the waters of the old
Aswan Dam most days of the year.
However, after the construction of the High
Dam (whose waters would not directly
affect these temples, as they were located
downstream) the water level of the old reser¬
voir would drop and fluctuate daily
between 102 and 110 metres in the process
of generating electricity. In other words, the
water would only partially inundate the tem¬
ple walls, but the fluctuating water level
36
The project to dismantle the two rock temples of
Abu Simbel and to re-erect them ata new site
with the same orientation as before, but 64 m
higher and 180 m further inland, was one of the
most spectacular achievements of the
Campaign to Save the Monuments of Nubia
launched by Unesco in 1960. Artist's conception
of the salvage operation (right) shows the Great
Temple with its seated colossi and the Small
Temple beyond it, both protected from the
waters of the Nile by a cofferdam (foreground).

the Great Temple to enable dismantling of the
temple rooms. Far right, the temples re-erected

would pose a more serious threat to the
stonework of the temples than their total and
permanent submersion.
The High Dam project thus confronted
the two governments with a major responsi¬
bility to the land of Nubia, which had had
strong links with Egypt throughout its his¬
tory, especially during the Pharaonic period.
It had therefore been the scene of major
architectural activity, particularly the con¬
struction of temples, fortifications and cas¬
tles for the protection of trade routes and the
maintenance of peace. Cities, cemeteries and
tombs were built in various periods, and
innumerable quantities of rock stelae, carv¬
ings and inscriptions had survived, not to
mention all the records of the past that still
lay buried.
The Egyptian Government therefore
approached Unesco on 6 April 1959, re¬
questing its active material, technical and
scientific assistance in the design and execu¬
tion of projects to save the monuments of
Nubia. Such a step was warranted by the
scale and costliness of the task and also by
the fact that the monuments were part of the
universal human heritage and hence a matter
of concern to the world as a whole.
Moreover, it was felt that Unesco had a
major responsibility for preserving and safe¬
guarding the world heritage and was the only
international organization capable of raising
the financial support and rallying the special¬
ists and technicians that were needed from all
over the world. A few months later, the
Sudanese Government submitted a similar
request to Unesco.
Unesco responded to these requests by
launching two major appeals. A first general
appeal was made by the Director-General of
Unesco on 8 March 1960 and a second, con¬
cerned more specifically with the need to
rescue the temples of Philae, was made
on 6 November 1968. In both appeals, the
Director-General called on governments,
public and private bodies and all potential
sources of aid to provide financial, technical
and scientific assistance for the purpose of
saving the monuments of Nubia.
The Campaign to Save the Monuments of
Nubia began with the following archaeolo¬
gical activities:
1 . Comprehensive recording of the monu¬
ments of Nubia: this was meticulously car¬
ried out by the Documentation and Study
Centre for the History of the Art and Civi¬
lization of Ancient Egypt in Cairo, which
had been established in 1955 as a result of a
contract between Unesco and the Govern¬
ment of Egypt providing for co-operation in
documenting Egyptian monuments with
their inscriptions and carvings. The Centre
was set up and financed by Egypt, with
Unesco providing the experts and
equipment.
2. An archaeological survey of Nubia to
make an inventory of all the archaeological
areas and sites that would be inundated and
to identify areas that had not yet been ex¬
cavated. Over seventy archaeological mis¬
sions from twenty-five countries then car¬
ried out excavations in those areas of
Egyptian and Sudanese Nubia that were to
be submerged.
The rescue of the temples which stood on the
island of Philae was the final stage in the
Campaign to Save the Monuments of Nubia
threatened by the waters of the Aswan High
Dam. The temples, dedicated to the cult of Isis,
are shown still almost intact in the 1 9th-century
engraving above left. They became endangered
in the early years of this century, when the first
Aswan Dam was built downstream from them.
After 1934, when the dam was raised, the island
and its temples were submerged for much of the
year. Photo taken in 1972 (above centre) shows
the Temple of Isis and the Graeco-Roman
"Kiosk" of Trajan partly under water. In 1960,
the construction of the High Dam threatened to
submerge the temples permanently, and a
decision was made to dismantle them and move
them to the neighbouring island of Algikia,
which was landscaped to resemble Philae. Work
began in 1972 and was completed in 1979.
Above, the monuments reconstituted on their
3. Rescue work on over twenty temples in
Egyptian and Sudanese Nubia, including:
The two temples of Abu Simbel, which
had been hewn in the rock. Many proposals
were submitted and extensive field studies
were carried out. In the end it was decided to
dismantle the two temples and rebuild them
inside soaring artificial domes erected at the
same site, but on ground 60 metres above the
original location. The temples were inaugu¬
rated at their new location in 1967.
The temples of Philae. Several proposals
were submitted for this rescue operation and
the project finally selected was carried out by
.Egyptian and Italian companies. It involved
dismantling the temples and reassembling
them on the neighbouring island of Agilkia
after preparing and levelling the terrain. The
completion of the project and the successful
conclusion of the campaign to save the
Nubian heritage were marked with great
celebrations in 1980.
In addition, over twenty temples, many
chapels, rock stelae and carvings also had to
be dismantled, transported and reassembled
on higher ground, safely above the waters of
the new reservoir, Lake Nasser. This rescue
work was carried out by the Egyptian De¬
partment of Antiquities, with the exception
of the Temple of Kalabsha, which was res¬
cued by the Federal Republic of Germany,

The Great
Sphinx
threatened
^ With its human head and the body of a
recumbent lion carved out of the rock
beneath the Great Pyramids at Giza,
the colossal great Sphinx is a portrait
statue of the Pharaoh Khephren
(c. 2520-2494 BC), whose tomb it
guards. Today the Sphinx is
threatened both by erosion due to the
climate and by the rising level of
extremely saline ground-water. In
February 1988, a block of stone
weighing almost 300 kg fell from the
right shoulder of the monument and
broke. The Egyptian Minister of
Culture has appealed to Unesco for
help in saving the Sphinx, which with
the rest of the Giza site is inscribed on
the World Heritage List of cultural
; properties of outstanding universal
value. The Director-General of
Unesco, who has recently visited the
site and noted the extent of the
damage, has expressed Unesco's
readiness to co-operate in the
restoration of the Sphinx.

and a section of the Temple of Amada, which
was rescued by France. The latter was moved
on rails to safe ground near its original site.
The antiquities of a region that had impor¬
tant ties with Pharaonic Egypt were thus
saved for posterity. For thousands of years
they had stood as a magnificent symbol of
human achievement in an isolated, barren
and inhospitable land, and they now provide
a unique example of what modern science
and technology can do to save the heritage of
our forebears.
Saving the monuments of Nubia was a
major landmark in the history of Unesco, for
it involved the Organization in the most
ambitious cultural and scientific operation
ever attempted in human history. The un¬
qualified success of the campaign was the
result of intensive co-operation among all
the parties concerned over a period of almost
twenty years. Victory was achieved through
the firm determination of the Governments
of Egypt and Sudan to save their cultural
heritage, the generosity of Unesco's Member
States, and the enthusiasm and skill of all
those who took part in the rescue operation
itself, particularly the archaeologists,
architects, engineers and experts who joined
forces under Unesco's aegis.
Unesco has contributed to the presenta¬
tion and enhancement of Egypt's ancient
heritage in other fields, including:
the improvement of museum services, par¬
ticularly the Egyptian Museum of Pharaonic
Antiquities in Cairo;
the conservation and restoration of ancient
Egyptian and Islamic archaeological sites
such as the Pyramids of Giza, Luxor and
several Islamic sites in Cairo;
the inclusion of a number of Egyptian
antiquities on the World Heritage List;
assistance in the publication of the Coptic
manuscripts of Nag' Hammadi, known as
"The Gnostic Codices";
the launching in 1982 of an International
Campaign for the Establishment of the
Nubia Museum in Aswan and the National
Museum of Egyptian Civilization in Cairo
and provision or all the financial, technical
and informational assistance needed to
achieve the goals of the campaign. The pur¬
pose of the National Museum is to present
the civilizations of Egypt from pre-nistory
to the present day . The exhibits of the Nubia
Museum will cover the geological, geog¬
raphic, ecological, ethnographic and artistic
features of Nubia and every aspect of its
history and archaeology. The Museum will
also contain a research centre to study all
matters related to Nubia and its ties with
Africa, for it was a major passage-way for the
transmission of cultural influences between
the Mediterranean and Africa.
Support for the project to revive the
ancient Library of Alexandria, a store of
learning that served the scientists and philo¬
sophers of the Greek world at a time when
Alexandria was a world centre of culture and
science. Unesco has called for contributions
to cover the building costs and for donations
of basic equipment, and has offered help in
planning this long-term project, which will
be completed at the end of the century. '
