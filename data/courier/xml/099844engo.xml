OPERATION SOLIDARITY-
TWO YEARS ON
Two years ago, in our February 1993 issue, we invited readers to take part in "Operation Solidarity". The idea was to help all those in Asia,
Africa, eastern Europe and Latin America who would like to read the UNESCO Courier but cannot afford to subscribe.
Since then more than 200 of you have taken out subscriptions on behalf of libraries, schools, universities, students and clubs. Some of you
wish to take out a solidarity subscription for a third consecutive year. We should like to express our appreciation of your generosity.
Here are some extracts from the many letters from readers who, thanks to you, have been receiving the Courier and have written to express
their gratitude. You will see from these excerpts that Operation Solidarity is extremely worthwhile.
íwaasssísBWísassaMrams^^ KPSBS3KSKS33!
"Our young people are trying to improve their grasp of several disci¬
plines, and receiving the Courier is a precious asset for us. Here a dictio¬
nary costs the equivalent of a civil servant's monthly salary." (Mrs.
Kalenga Makika Leya, Director of the Youth Cultural Centre, Kamira,
Zaire).
"I enjoy reading the Courier immensely and share it with my asso¬
ciates. Remember we lack reading materials in our rural Third World!"
(Deo N. Ntwari, Rukungiri, Uganda).
"Thank you for your precious contribution which is helping to open
our club to all of humanity's cultural horizons." (Abdul Diallo,
President of the Culture and Development Club, Conakry, Guinea).
"I am twenty and a student. Reading the Courier broadens my hori¬
zons and enables me to acquire immense, practical insight into the world
around me." (Pascal Mutabazi, Ugandan student).
"I have studied at the university of Addis Abeba, and am now a tea¬
cher. Our currency is not easily convertible, so I am grateful for my sub¬
scription to the Courier; it allows me to satisfy my interest in the worlds
of art, literature, science and culture." (Wendye Beshah, Welo,
Ethiopia).
"This magazine is widely consulted by our readers and is a source of
information appreciated by everyone." (A. Diallo, officer of the
Ziguinchor public library, Senegal).
"I would like to thank you most cordially and sincerely on behalf of
the readers of the Tambura Library. . . . Food self-sufficiency and
health are vital requirements, but we also need books, magazines and
documents that can help us extend and deepen our knowledge, streng¬
then our determination, direct our efforts and broaden our hori¬
zons. . . . The UNESCO Courier . . . allows us to refer to cultures different
from our own and promotes global standards and values. . . ." (Amadou
Zaga Traoré, public reading programme official, Tambura Library,
Kéniéba, Mali).
"Our students, the beneficiaries of your offer, have a crucial role to
play in Uganda's future." (Dr. Peter Miller, Institute of Teacher
Education, Kampala, Uganda).
"Like my colleagues in the south, I have noted the gap existing bet¬
ween the obvious hunger of young people in cities for information and
culture and our inability to fill that gap. . . . Your magazine can help to
provide our young people with the spiritual nourishment they lack so
badly." (Abdul Ajiji Saly, Garua town library, North Cameroon).
"We are dependent on our own resources, working as we do without
textbooks, documentation or outside training. ... We are determined to
overcome our isolation from the outside world." (Mrs. Rakotomanga
Rako Lalao, President of the Association of Teachers of French, Fort
Dauphin, Madagascar).
"Thank you for your magazine that serves as a link between coun¬
tries." (An Algerian student).
"I'd like to tell you how happy I am to be receiving your magazine
again after a gap of several years and to pass it on to the Holguin hospi¬
tal library." (Dr. Guillermo Ramirez de Arellano, Holguin, Cuba).
"How do I use the magazine? First my family reads it, then other
teachers in my department. But my students (age 16 to 18) are the prime
beneficiaries. We hold debates based on the themes. I am glad that in
this way my students are able to learn about the world they live in."
(Eliazar Espinosa Jimenez, Congajas, Cuba).
"Receiving the Courier is very much appreciated by those who are
not in a position to buy it. ... I use it in my classes." (Celisa Rodriguez,
Cuba).
"I am a railroad worker in love with culture and would like to thank
you on behalf of the small library I am organizing for my fellow wor¬
kers." (Luis-Onel, Yuia del Mar, Chüe).
B "Receiving the Courier is very important for us and our associa¬
tion's plans." (Syamsul Harahap, Executive Director of the Students
Association of Al-Washliyah, Langkat, Indonesia).
"The Thana Para Youth Club organized a book and magazine fair at
which the Courier held a place of honour. ... We need foreign books
and magazines but have no income because almost all of us are stu¬
dents." (Mr. Robiul Islam, President of Thana Para Youth Club,
Bangladesh).
"I have just returned from a reporting assignment in a refugee camp
in Thailand. I noted that the camp students have no cultural magazine. .
. . I should like to thank you for offering them this subscription." (Mrs.
Yolande Garcia, Blagnac, France).
"Thank you for the interest you have shown in our university." (Ms.
Melina Tardia, Head Librarian, Parahyangan Catholic University,
Bandung, Indonesia).
"You have provided our library with an international cultural maga¬
zine that gives our French-speaking Vietnamese readers interesting in¬
formation about other cultures." (Nguyen Thé Duc, Director of the
National Library of Hanoi, Viet Nam).
"Your UNESCO Courier gift subscriptions are especially welcome to
help us reconstitute libraries." (Philippe Salord, Office of Linguistic and
Educational Co-operation, Zagreb, Croatia).
If you would like to strengthen these ties of friendship, why not take out a solidarity subscription?

It may, on the face of it, seem strange to look back at the origins
of the world's diverse forms of writing at the very moment when a
universal new system is being born before our very eyes. Unimag¬
inable not so long ago, computerized script has become part of our
daily lives, promising access to the dazzling new world of informa¬
tion, learning and communication that we described in our February
issue on "the multimedia explosion".
Some think that this new electronic script will replace all earlier
writing systems and consign them to oblivion. Are they right?
While the present issue of the Unesco Courier does not pose this
problem in such specific terms, its contents suggest that the
answer to it will probably be "no". By shedding light on the great
variety of forms and techniques used to make the spoken word "vis¬
ible", it shows how close and intricate is the relationship between
a language and the writing system used to record it. Arabic would
not be Arabic if it were written in Chinese characters. Turkish is not
the same language when written in Latin script. The death knell
starts to sound for a language when its writing system disappears
because a language, its script and its music belong to a single
aesthetic.
The subject of writing takes us into one of the deepest recesses
of a people's identity. Learning to write has always been a key
stage in the process whereby a person gains access to the collec¬
tive memory and becomes a full member of the national community,
part of its fabric of complicities and conflicts.
Tempted by the boundless possibilities for travel, exchange and new
experiences offered by globalization, will late twentieth century
people continue to feel this need for roots, this desire for familiar
faces, landscapes and rhythms? We think they will. The further
they go, the more they will need familiar landmarks. The more
exposed they are to communication that is rich in information but
poor in meaning, the more sustenance they will need from the roots
of their own cultures. The written language, drawing its vitality
from the works produced in it over the centuries, can safeguard this
heritage and defend it against the growing threats of anonymity and
oblivion.

INTERVIEW
ERNEST J. GAINES
talks to Bernard Magnier
Ernest J. Gaines (born 1933) grew up on a
Louisiana plantation where, at the age of
nine, he started work as a potato picker,
earning 50 cents a day. When he was fifteen
he joined his mother in California, where he
began to study and discovered a passion for
reading. Disappointed to find in books
nothing about the world he knew, he decided
to start writing himself. His first short stories
were published in 1956 and were followed by
novels including Of Love and Dust (1967) and
The Autobiography of Miss Jane Pittman
(1971), which brought him to the attention
of a wide American public. Considered a
major "Southern novelist", in 1994 he
received the U.S. National Book Award for A
Lesson before Dying.
Tell us something about your child¬
hood and family background.
For more than a century my family
lived on a sugarcane plantation in
Louisiana and I am the product of a mix¬
ture of Africans, Indians and whites.
That's all I know about my ancestors. I
don't know which African country or
which Indian tribe they came from.
So I was born on the plantation where
my parents worked, and that was where I
first went to school. Later I attended
school at New Rose, a nearby town that I
call Bayonne in my books, until I was fif¬
teen. Then my parents separated. My
mother went to five in California and I fol¬
lowed her there to continue my studies. It
was then that I became interested in
writing and started to frequent public
libraries, which in California were open to
everyone, not just whites.
What were the first books you read,
the ones that most influenced you?
I liked to read fiction. There were no
black writers and so I started by reading
Southern writers. But I didn't think much
of the demeaning way they spoke ofblacks .
I turned to European writers, particu¬
larly the Russians Gogol, Turgenev and
Chekhov who described peasant life in a
rich and interesting way. My first novel,
Catherine Carmier, was inspired by Tur¬
genev 's Fathers and Sons. Later I discov¬
ered Maupassant and Flaubert.
Did you take these writers as your
models?
All these European writers only half
satisfied me because they only talked
about their own people, and I couldn't
find myself in their work. I wanted to
talk about my people, so when I was
around sixteen or seventeen years old I
started to write.
When I was twenty, after I had done
my military service, I went to college,
where I studied creative writing and Eng¬
lish literature. It was there that I discov¬
ered Hemingway, Steinbeck, Joyce and
others. But none of these great novelists
had any particular influence on me. As
someone once said, to take from one
person is plagiarism but to take from
everybody is genius!
What was your first published work? 5

INTERVIEW
AH the great writers
are regionalists.
Faulkner wrote about
Mississippi, Homer
about Greece, Balzac
about Paris,
Shakespeare about a
kind of England. But
that doesnt mean
they're not universal.
A short story called Tiw Turtles, which
appeared in 1956 in a college literary
review in San Francisco. The turtles were
a kind of challenge for two young fish¬
ermen. Both of them are taken by their
fathers to a young lady to initiate them to
sex. The little boy who is afraid of the
turtle is also afraid of the girl. The little boy
who's brave enough to fish and catch the
turtles obeys the father. I am very proud
of this short story. It has just been repub¬
lished by the journal of the university
where I teach now. Thirty-five years later!
When did you turn to writing novels?
A literary agent read The Turtles
and liked it. She contacted my professor,
and she encouraged me to write my first
novel. I had already written what I
thought was a novel when I was nine¬
teen years old. I sent it to a publisher,
who turned it down and sent it back to
me. I threw it on the fire. Ten years later
I went back to this novel, which took
me five years to finish and gave me a lot
of trouble. But all the time I was learning
how to write. After it had been substan¬
tially rewritten a dozen or more times
and returned to me seven times by the
publisher, it was finally accepted. That
was how Catherine Cannier came to be
published by Athenaeum. Thirty-five
O hundred copies were printed, and I
doubt even twenty-five hundred were
sold. The rest were remaindered at 25
cents. If you could get your hands on
an original copy today, you'd have to
pay more than a hundred dollars for it.
In the United States you are thought
of as a "Southern writer". Do you think
that label accurately describes a lit¬
erary category or is it too narrow?
It's too narrow. I have been catego¬
rized "a black writer", "a Southern
writer", "a Californian writer" because
I lived in California, "a Louisiana writer"
because I wrote about Louisiana. ... I
don't feel I fit into any of these cate¬
gories. I just try to be a decent writer.
And yet almost all your novels are set
in a small area, Bayonne Parish	
All the great writers are regionalists.
Faulkner wrote about Mississippi,
Homer about Greece, Balzac about
Paris, Shakespeare about a kind of Eng¬
land. But that doesn't mean they're not
universal. People write about what they
know best, and readers respond to that
wherever they happen to live. The Auto¬
biography ofMiss Jane Pittman has been
translated into several languages, and
readers of all races have written to me
and said they felt that the old lady was
somebody they recognized.
In a way, isn't your Bayonne Parish
the Louisiana equivalent of Faulkner's
Yoknapatawpha County, in Mississippi?
I did get the inspiration for the parish
of Bayonne from Faulkner's mythical
Yoknapatawpha County and the use of
the multiple point-of-view in the novel.
But Faulkner himself was influenced by
Sherwood Anderson, whom he knew,
and by James Joyce's writings about
Dublin. So just as Faulkner inherited
from them, I inherited from Faulkner.
It's a continuing process.
I certainly feel close to Faulkner. We
both belong to the South. We write about
the same things life in small towns, the
everyday struggles of poor people, the
influence of big land-owners on small
farmers, race problems. And Mississippi
isn't far from Louisiana.
In your novels a breaking point often
occurs as a result of a love affair, as if
this kind of relationship is a crucible for
all kinds of taboos and conflicts.
That is true of some of my novels , but
not all. A Lesson before Dying is the story
of an uneducated young black condemned
to death for a crime he did not commit and
a black schoolteacher who restores his
dignity before he dies. Love relationships
are not the only situations that breed con¬
flict; it is constant. The major conflict in
my work is when the black male attempts
to go beyond the line that is drawn for
him. But you've also got conflict between
young and old, between the desire to go
back to the place where you were born or
to stay where you are, between religious
feeling and atheism. . . . There has to be
a conflict before there can be a story and
before the story reveals racial tensions.
Early in their careers, the French-
speaking writers of black Africa and the
Caribbean gathered beneath the
banner of the "négritude" movement to

ERNEST J. GAINES
assert black cultural values. Do you
think this movement is still relevant?
Yes, I do. Even if I don't belong to this
school or to any other school, I accept
that this idea of négritude, put forward
by writers who express themselves in
French, can provide young writers with
the bearings that are so lacking. In my
own little sphere I do the same thing as
these African and West Indian writers. I
try to describe the daily lives of African-
Americans as well as I can. I think I'm
doing the same thing as they are without
putting myself in a box.
What are your feelings about
Africa?
I have never been there. I feel very
close to Africa because of my origins
but also because every human being
ought to feel concerned about the very
serious things that are happening there.
I sympathize with the sorrows of Africa
because they are similar to those we
experienced in the South forty-odd
years ago. But there arc problems in
the rest of the world, too. I like African
literature and music just as I like those
that come to us from Europe and the
Americas. My culture is, perhaps above
all, Western.
Do you read African writers?
A little. Not nearly as much as I
should!
Do you feel that there is a black cul¬
tural community in the United States?
I don't think there is any kind of
school ofblack culture in the United States
today. The expression "black commu¬
nity" is very vague. Is there a white com¬
munity? I don't know. Nevertheless, black
writers tackle the problems they know
well, but with different approaches. Toni
Morrison, Alice Walker, Maya Angelou
and I share common preoccupations.
These days there are plenty of meet
ings, anthologies, book series and crit¬
ical works on black African and Afro-
American literature and so on. Do you
think it's ludicrous to lump together
writers from the United States, the
Caribbean and Africa because they are
black?
No, not at all! I approve of this kind
of thing. It is important for us black
writers to meet and talk because our
works are not taught as much in colleges
as those of whites. All the same I don't
spend too much time at those gatherings;
I prefer staying at home and writing.
In my own little
sphere I do the same
thing as these
African and West
Indian writers. 1 try
to describe the daily
lives of African-
Americans as well
as I can.
Louisiana is presented in your work
as a land of conflict but also as a place
of meetings, of peace and compro¬
mise. In spite of "the sound and the
fury", your writing seems more serene
than that of other black writers.
I write from my own viewpoint. I
don't see the world as Jimmy Baldwin or
Richard Wright did. I may not have suf¬
fered racism as directly as either one of
those men did, and I haven't lived in
large cities as they did in Harlem or
Chicago's south side but we have fought
for the same causes. I went to California
when I was very young, to a decent, small
town where I was completely integrated
into the school. There were people of all
backgrounds. There were whites, his-
panics, native Americans and Asians.
That doesn't stop me from writing
about serious subjects. In/1 Lesson before
Dying an innocent person is sent to the
electric chair. I was criticized for The
Autobiography of Miss Jane Pittman,
because at the time of the civil rights
struggle the life of a woman aged 110 was
not a topical subject! For me it was pri¬
marily a piece of literary work, sure, but
I also described in this book terrible events
that were not unconnected with what was
going on. I'm doing what the others are
doing, just more quietly.
Do you think that things have
changed in North America in this
respect?
There have been some changes in the
last forty years, but I don't feel that
writers and artists have changed very
much in their choice of subjects. The
change has not been substantial enough to
halt the struggle against racism. The race
problem still exists that's why I have
been writing about it for forty years. On
the other hand, the work of black writers
is certainly far more widely accepted now.
Today I am accepted on the same footing
as others, and that would have been
impossible thirty years ago.
Have things changed in everyday
life?
Some people have changed, especially
in educated circles. The situation has
changed for some people, progress has
been made. People have accepted black
people's participation in public life. Times
have changed from the days when Nat
King Cole had his show cancelled simply
because he held a white female's hand up
on the stage at the end of a show when the
credits were going on. But so many serious
problems are still unsolved education
and unemployment, for example. There's
still a long way to go. I

The written word
by Xavier Perret
\ \ 1 ï
Around 35,000 years ago, prehistoric man made the first
paintings on cave walls and ceilings. It was not until much
later that the earliest writing systems using signs emerged in
Mesopotamia and in Egypt.
The appearance of writing
coincided with the birth of cities.
Above, detail of an Assyrian relief
from the palace of Sargon II at Dur
Sarrukm (8th century B.C.) shows
a man holding a model of a city.
Writing, as a system of symbols repre¬
senting a structured language, made its
appearance only in the middle of the fourth mil¬
lennium B.C. in the land of Sumer, Mesopo¬
tamia. This system, consisting originally of pic-
tograms, evolved gradually in the direction of
abstraction, thus increasing its capacity to repro¬
duce the whole of human discourse. Some time
later, at the beginning of the second millennium
B.C., and on the other side of the world, Chinese
writing emerged, also in pictorial form, while
the Egyptian and Mayan systems, whose origins
are still unknown, were likewise based on the
use of pictures as signifiers.
The figurative look of these early graphic
symbols recalls humanity's very first attempts
to depict things, the cave paintings of the Palae¬
olithic period. What are we to make of the rep¬
resentations of beasts and men to be seen in the
rock art of 35000 to 18000 B.C.? Though we
cannot find any correspondence with a struc¬
tured language in them, what we do observe is a
desire to represent subjects in graphic form that
bespeaks the existence of a common language
or at least of common referents within the

group, and hence the existence of a common way
of thinking.
Thousands of years, however, separate the
paintings left behind by the Aurignacian and
Magdalenian cultures from the earliest non-fig¬
urative graphic symbols, i.e. numbers, whether
they be the ancient Chinese system of rods or the
Sumerian system of keeping accounts with incised
hollow clay balls.1 It was in the course of this very
long period that the Neolithic revolution took
place, and the relationship between human beings
and their environment underwent a radical
change, the hunter-gatherer becoming a pro¬
ducer.
By the stylization and combination of the
original icons, writing systems arrived at the rep¬
resentation of speech and thought.
The earliest Sumerian logograms, for instance,
like ancient Chinese pictograms, represented
basic concepts that needed to be interpreted for
the reader to reconstitute the message. Castes of
scribes spent centuries improving this method of
representation before finally arriving at systems
whereby all the nuances of language could be
set down.
rrorn symbols to sounds
While the emergence of forms of writing in
Sumer, in China and, perhaps, in Central America
can be explained in terms of evolution, the various
phonetic systems (alphabets or syllabaries) found
all over the world are thought to have originated
from the dissemination of a primeval model that
was borrowed, imitated and appropriated by one
society and language after another.
The first system of phonetic (probably syl¬
labic) transcription seems to have been the
Phoenician system, the earliest signs of which
may be traced back to the thirteenth to eleventh
centuries B.C. Although the precise origin of

Phoenician characters remains obscure (they

a majority of cases, they were the matrix from
which have developed the various phonetic alpha¬

The use of phonetic scripts was propagated by
population movements like the migration of Ara¬
maean nomads into Mesopotamia, by the activ¬
ities of traders such as the Phoenicians in the
eastern Mediterranean, and by the establishment
of political power (e.g. the Dorian invasions in
Greece), or religious power (e.g. Christian, with
the translation of the Bible into Slavonic); but the
success of these scripts was undoubtedly due in
the main to the fact that they were so much easier

to use than clumsy cuneiform or the complex
hieroglyphics of ancient Egypt.
Each of the societies that, one after another,
borrowed the Phoenician system had to adapt it
to its own requirements. Thus it was that the
Aramaic, Hebrew and Nabataean scripts came
into being, subsequently giving rise to other
scripts, again adapted and transformed Greek
and Arabic, which in their turn gave rise to others.
At this point we are no longer dealing with
dissemination or evolution but with contam¬
ination.
The return of the image
What function does writing then serve? To begin
with, it had two distinct purposes. In China, it was
primarily used to communicate with the other
world, as is shown by such archaeological objects
as incised tortoise shells and "oracle bones". Its
function was thus, initially, a magical one, quite
unlike what was happening in Sumer, where its
first use was for keeping accounts. Elsewhere, in
Egypt or among the Maya, writing was known
only to the priesthood and served a religious
purpose, while in Europe at a later date it was for
a long time the exclusive preserve of the clergy.
Since both the spiritual and the temporal
power were very often in the hands of the same
individuals, writing, which was linked, whether
closely or distantly, to magic, became involved in
the establishment of the legal and political
authority. Long the prerogative of rulers, it fil¬
tered down only slowly to the other strata of
society. When the Maya priests disappeared, for
example, the secrets of Maya writing died with
them, and it was centuries before the Egyptian
demotic script appeared, to be used in public
administration, commerce and literature. In the
West, widespread literacy dates back only to the
late nineteenth century, and even today none of
the modern industrialized societies can boast a 100
per cent literacy rate.
Paradoxically, it is in these latter societies,
where the law is set down in writing and writing
therefore often has the force of law, that com¬
munication through images has been gaining,
ground considerably for the last century and a
half. Whilst the invention of printing may for a
while have halted the evolution of writing or
held it in check, the return of the image, together
with the fact that new ideograms and pictograms
are constantly appearing all around us, seems to
show that that evolution has taken off again.

The birth of writing
by Béatrice André-Salvini
In ancient Mesopotamia writing was invented in response to the
need to keep accounts and make lists. The earliest recorded
calculations were inscribed on tablets of clay, an abundant material
in the valleys of the Near East.
I Writing appeared for the first time around
I 3300 B.C. in the land of Sumer, during a
period of far-reaching change which coincided
with the construction of the first towns. At this
time, the political, social and cultural condi¬
tions needed for writing to be invented were
all met.

produced around 2800-2100 B.C. lacked.
The temple of the tutelary god became a
great administrative centre, placed under the
authority of a political and religious leader, the
"king-priest". Relations became complex and the
temple administrators had to manage move¬
ments of personnel, salaries and incoming and
outgoing goods and flocks of animals. Since the
capacity of the human memory is limited, it
became necessary to find a new and unified
system of reference enabling oral information to
be preserved and recovered later on in spoken
form. This is how writing was born. It represents
symbols of society in images. New concepts
were therefore depicted in an abstract form in
the earliest attempts at writing. The word for
sheep, the animal which had to be counted most
often, was, for example, first represented by a
cross in a circle the animal in its enclosure.
Writing started out as a simple memory aid 11

Towards the middle of the third millennium signs were split up,
reversed and simplified. No longer used to represent an object
but the sounds that made up its name, they lost some of their
symbolic content. Cuneiform writing had reached the stage at
which it could express ideas.
but its form and content gradually developed in
the following centuries.
The form of the linear script, incised with a
pointed tool, soon changed. The signs lost all
resemblance to the original figurative outline.
This phenomenon was due to the medium used
to support writing, i.e. clay, which was the only
eligible natural material in southern
Mesopotamia. Its constraints led to the trans¬
formation of the signs. As it is hard to draw
curved lines on soft clay, they were broken
down into straight lines which, instead of being
incised, were soon imprinted using a reed
calamus with a triangular end which produces
wedge-shaped impressions. These may be hor¬
izontal, oblique or vertical, and their different
combinations form a sign.
A neo-Sumerian administrative As the script changed, the scribes also endeav-
tablet dating from the end of the
3rd millennium B.C.
oured to increase the range and efficiency of the
ideographic system by creating composite signs.
To simplify writing, attempts were made to
reduce the number of signs, so that the same
ideogram was soon used to transcribe similar
actions or concepts. The reader had to choose
between these different meanings by reference to
the context, and this was not always easy.
To remedy this difficulty of interpretation,
"determinatives" were invented; these were
placed at the beginning or end of words and
were probably not pronounced. They specified
the category to which the concept that was
expressed belonged: God, man, planet, bird,
country, stone object, etc. The need to tran¬
scribe proper nouns and grammatical elements
led to the invention of signs representing sounds
(phonograms) by ridding ideograms of their
meaning and retaining only their sound.
These techniques led to a diminution in the
repertoire of signs, which was reduced from
900 in the early period to about 500 around
2400 B.C. It thus became possible to develop a
system which was partly syllabic, enabling
written sentences to represent linear relation¬
ships between words and to represent all the
nuances of the spoken language.

The content of the texts was also enriched,
reflecting the new possibilities for reproducing
all the elements of the Sumerian language.
rrom book-keeping to narrative
The first written versions of Sumerian litera¬
ture, in which only the roots of verbs were tran¬
scribed, leaving the reader to fill in the missing
elements, appeared in the era of the archaic
dynasties (around 2700 B.C.), together with
contracts and other commercial documents.
Towards the middle of the third millennium
signs were split up, reversed and simplified; no
longer used to represent an object but the sounds
that made up its name, they lost some of their
symbolic content. Their forms increasingly
changed. By now the writing of grammatical
forms was well defined and cuneiform writing
(from the Latin cuneus or wedge) was able to
express ideas. It spread beyond the confines of
Sumerian territory, and its adaptation for use in
languages other than Sumerian was to become
the main factor in its evolution.
Around the year 2340 B.C., the new masters
of the country, the Akkad emperors, used the
Sumerian script to transcribe their own Semitic
language, Akkadian. At the end of the third
millennium, a brief return of the Sumerians to
power witnessed an effort on the part of poets,
writers and scholars to transcribe and circulate
the great literary works of the oral tradition:
hymns to the gods, myths, prayers, epics, philo¬
sophical essays and collections of knowledge.
The Gilgamesh epic was to become the most
widely disseminated work. Around the year
2000 B.C., Sumerian disappeared from
Mesopotamia as a spoken language and was

Mesopotamia (4th millennium
B.C.) is a title deed with the

left, as a kind of signature.
replaced by Akkadian, which then split into
two dialects: Assyrian in the north and Baby¬
lonian in the south. But Sumerian was to remain
the language of erudite culture until the last
days of cuneiform writing in the first century of
the Christian era.
Despite its complexity, this system spread
throughout the ancient Near East, to be used for
writing many different Semitic, Indo-European
(such as Hittite) or "Asiatic" languages. The
decline of cuneiform began in the first millen¬
nium when Aramaean nomads penetrated into
Mesopotamia and introduced their own written
language using a linear alphabet which was easy
to learn and handle, was readily accessible and
could be set down on a lighter material, i.e.
papyrus. Cuneiform writing, which was clumsy
and was practised only by a small number of ini¬
tiates, gradually declined.

From pictograms to pinyin
by Rinnie Tang-Loaec and Pierre Colombel
The Chinese still use a form of writing that originated well over
3,000 years ago
14
RINNIE TANG-LOAEC,
of France, was formerly an
ethnologist at the Musée de
l'Homme in Paris. She is co¬
author (with Léo Landsman) of
Le mouvement qui apaise, a
book about Chinese boxing (Epi,
Paris, 1984).
PIERRE COLOMBEL,
a French specialist in cave
paintings with his country's
National Centre for Scientific
Research (CNRS), is attached to
the Musée de l'Homme in Paris.
A very old tradition has it that writing
consists of more or less figurative signs
which represent beings and objects or evoke
natural phenomena.
A popular legend tells how Fu-Hsi, who
introduced laws to China and is regarded as the
mythical inventor of Chinese writing, drew
inspiration from the claw marks left by birds in
the snow.
A more sophisticated version of the same
legend is to be found in a text dating from the
T'ang dynasty (618-907) in which the author
recounts that Fu-Hsi had four eyes so that he
could watch the earth and sky simultaneously.
Observation of the Kui constellation in the sky
and of the marks of birds and tortoises on the
earth inspired him to develop writing.
From the early days of Chinese writing, dif¬
ferent types of signs appeared and went on to
evolve and become the "keys" to the system.
The basic elements which lie at the origin of
this script are iconic. The most ancient known
forms are human figures painted or engraved on
rock faces, for instance in the rock art sites in the.
Yinshan Mountains of inner Mongolia.
With the passage of time, these simple pic¬
tograms gradually became more stylized. From
them developed ideograms, which arc combina¬
tions of two or three pictographic signs depicting
actions, basic ideas and more complex notions.
The notion of light, for example, is a combination
of signs depicting the sun and the moon.
In modern writing, characters developed
out of these pictograms are few and far between,

The same autumn sign placed above a heart means "sadness".
but they constitute the "radicals" or "keys"
forming the basis for the classification of char¬
acters in dictionaries which was to remain in
use until the creation in the 1950s of the pinyin
system for the phonetic transcription of Chinese
characters into the Roman alphabet.
The appearance of a Chinese script enabling
texts to be written dates back to the transitional
period between the Hsia (twenty-second to
eighteenth centuries B.C.) and Shang (eigh¬
teenth to eleventh centuries B.C.) dynasties.
This was the time when a hierarchy became
established in Chinese society and the power of
the state was solidly based.
N atural selection
Archaeological discoveries have so far enabled
an inventory to be compiled of some 4,000 char¬
acters engraved on more than 10,000 pieces of
material tortoise shells and flat bones that
were used both for divinatory purposes and
also to record events or draw up inventories.
These ancient characters retrace the genesis and
evolution of Chinese writing. More than a thou¬
sand of them have so far been identified. They
are in a sense "stenographic drawings" which are
schematized and obey a strict rule: a word and
its expression correspond to each character.
In the Shang period, this type of writing,
which was the outcome of a long period during
which the characters had changed, was already
in current use, but not all the characters cre¬
ated in this way were in fact retained. Some
which were difficult to communicate, had little
significance or were hard to memorize, were
destined to disappear. Others on the contrary
which more effectively evoked specific con¬
cepts and were more widely accessible, became
the first elements of a script used by a people
who shared the same cultural background.
Chinese writing thus consisted originally of
simple, stylized forms (pictograms) or combi
nations of pictograms which evoked an action or
a concept. It might be said that, at its birth, this
writing was created independently of the lan¬
guage and that the equivalence which exists
today with the spoken word is the outcome of
a long process of natural evolution.
These divinatory inscriptions on
bone are among the earliest
known traces of Chinese writing
(16th-llth centuries B.C.)

related to astronomical observations or marked
the beginning or end of governments. Figures
and dates were abundant.
The first moveable supports used for writing
were probably animal hides (mainly deerskins).
Jadeite masks and figurines sent as offerings to
distant temples bore short, probably religious
texts, explaining where the objects were from.
Longer and more complex texts on mythical,
historical and religious subjects were written
on ceramic receptacles.
Much later on, when cotton was grown, spun
and woven, cartographical and genealogical infor¬
mation was recorded on large pieces of cloth.
In earlier times the bark of the wild fig tree, the
amatl, was used to make long strips of "paper" on
which illustrated texts were inscribed. Leaves of
paper and hides could be kept rolled up in scrolls,
or else folded and protected between two pieces
of wood to form codices (singular codex), the
name given to the European manuscript books
which they resembled.
r ictograms drawn from observation
Because they differ in appearance, it has been
said there are several Central American writing
systems. There is, however, a single basic system
whose most original feature is its pictorial basis.
Images were fully codified in order to tran¬
scribe the basic semantic and phonetic elements
of the languages of the indigenous populations,
which could then be used to record and com¬
municate their ideas and their knowledge, and
also produce works of art.
The pictographic or pictorial manuscripts
of Central America are like strip cartoons in
which every figure counts because each element
signifies a concept and refers to an object, as
well as having phonetic and plastic values.
The pictograms were the result of direct
observation. They showed plants, animals, man¬
ufactured objects and parts of the human body
with various degrees of stylization, sometimes
in completely abstract form.
There was nothing gratuitous or purely dec¬
orative about these drawings, which should be
read as a totality. They originally formed part of
a common plastic convention, although the
image changes in response to the linguistic needs
of each group.
The spatial distribution of the signs also
varies from one civilization to another. The
Maya, for example, tended to favour a linear
arrangement for certain types of sign, though
they also set aside horizontal or vertical areas in
order to write other words continuously, par¬
ticularly when they were recording calculations
or presenting a chronology of events.
However, the first word signs were drawn
inside cartouches in which figurative elements can
be seen. In Central American images the largest
drawings seem distinct from the others. Space in
general seems to be divided into two: glyphic
for small images and iconic for larger ones. Mixtee
and Aztec documents depict "landscapes" and
"scenes" in which different themes are superim¬
posed and information is presented step by step.
Glyphs and icons are combined and associ¬
ated in the pictorial area. There are always some
guidelines to indicate the direction in which the
manuscript is to be read. The script is a mixture
of logography and iconography.
It is only in documents with a highly spe¬
cific purpose, such as calendars, chronicles or

City, 1988).
economic lists that the different "texts" can be
distinguished one from another.
The Aztec model
Tlacuiloa, the term used in Náhuatl, the lan¬
guage of the Aztecs, to designate the traditional
writing system means "to write while painting"
or else "to paint while writing" writing and
painting being in this case the same activity.
Although research into the decoding of the
Aztec notation is still in its infancy, we can be
sure that it is a dual system of drawings (glyphs
and icons) originating from the same plastic
convention and based on the sounds of Náhuatl.
Codification of images is thus primarily by
sound: shapes defined by a black outline form
surfaces designed to contain colours. These
symbols transcribe the basic phonetic elements
(syllables) and semantic elements of the Náhuatl
language.
Words, sentences and paragraphs are con¬
structed using combinations of these elements.
The plastic and phonic composition created by
the tlacuilo ("writer-painter") results in "picture-
texts" where the order and direction for reading
the shapes and colours are indicated by the artist
within the drawing itself.
Colours are basic components of the Central
American pictographic system, unlike other
such systems. They are pronounced (each one
has a phonetic value) and the syllables of their
names are combined with those of other ele¬
ments, including their own receptacle-shapes.
This in no way diminishes their representative
value.
These codices or "picture-texts" must first of
all be read in the Náhuatl language before being
interpreted. To do this, the reader must know, in
addition to the language, the code governing
shapes, surfaces and colours in the Aztec system
of representation.

I Oral tradition was paramount among the
' Arabs in pre-Islamic days, and poets were
the memory of their tribe. Then the Arabs felt
the need to write down their stories, first simply
as an aide-mémoire, using only a few signs.
With the advent of Islam in the seventh cen¬
tury A.D. writing began to be important because
it gave visual form to the word of God. The
Qur'an, the first book written in Arabic, played
a key role in its development and the evolution
of calligraphy.
Precise practices were laid down. The writing
instrument was the calamus, a sharpened reed
still used by calligraphers. The method of sharp¬
ening it was most important, for it varied with
different scripts. The ink was prepared with
meticulous care and (like the calamus) in strict
secrecy.
The teaching of writing was the responsi¬
bility of a master, who began by drawing letters
in the sand with his finger. The pupils imitated
him, then rubbed it all out and started afresh.

place of origin (thus hiri from the town of Hira,
hijazi from the Hijaz area, etc.).
In the eighth century the Arabs learned the
secret of paper-making from the Chinese, and
this encouraged the spread of written texts and
fostered the growth of writing. Every corner of
the far-flung Muslim empire had its own style,
20
reflecting its culture and tastes. Thus while the
kufi script was the one mainly used for writing
the Qur'an, it did not have the same appear¬
ance in India as in Iraq, nor the same in Egypt as
in Andalusia.
Monumental lettering (painted on enamel, or
carved in wood or stone) became even more
different, gradually diverging from handwriting
until it lost its original structure. One of the
earliest inscriptions is the one inside the Dome
of the Rock at Jerusalem, in which gilded Kufic
characters on a blue ground run along the mosaic
walls: this dates from the seventh century. Later
there was a proliferation of calligraphy on all
religious and secular monuments.
Kufic script was originally thick and heavy:
when it turned into an architectural feature it
became refined and monumental. The characters
became taller and thinner, suggesting a town-
scape with domes and minarets, or else formed
plaited, floral or geometrical designs. Quad¬
rangular Kufic, for example, consists entirely of
lines meeting at right angles, which gives it aus¬
terity and strength. The written words are sim¬
plified in form; the letters no longer follow one
another on a line, but float in space as though
weightless, or are intertwined in a spiralling
diagonal along the rounded stem of the minarets.
An abstract art form
Script, omnipresent not only on monuments
but also on clothing, crockery and furniture,
was the premier visual art form of the Islamic
city representations of "beings with souls"
having fallen into disrepute. Writing became
the main decorative feature of mosques, palaces
and schools. The only exception was scientific
and literary books, but even there representa¬
tions of the human figure lacked realism, relief
and depth. Thus it was calligraphers who bor¬
rowed from the vocabulary of artists and used
words to give the illusion of illustration.
According to their inspiration and personal
taste they enriched their texts with new mean¬
ings, as in the so-called "mirror calligraphy"
conveying mystical fervour.
On monuments, calligraphy became an
object of meditation. Complicated geometrical
constructions known as calligrams became illeg¬
ible, or contrariwise simplified to the extreme,
like the enormous single letter waw on the wall
of the Great Mosque at Bursa, in Turkey. Cal¬
ligraphy thus became an abstract art form,
expressing the feelings of the calligrapher which
the observer could interpret as he wished. It
developed in two main directions. First, the
shape of the letters themselves sloping up,
sloping down or lying down required callig¬
raphers to be extremely meticulous. The shape

and the space they had to fit into needed to be

The second line of development was the cal-
ligrapher's own imagination. The accepted rules
did not exclude innovation. After spending years
studying the legacy of his forebears, an artist
eventually gave his inspiration free rein; and it
was by breaking the rules that he advanced his
art. The calligrapher Ibrahim al-Suli said in the
tenth century: "When the pen becomes a tyrant,
it binds together that which was separate and
separates that which was bound together."
An alphabet used by thirty-odd
languages
As early as the reign of the Abbasid caliph al-
Ma'mun (786-833), competition between cal-
ligraphers had given rise to dozens of specialized
styles. There was one reserved for the caliph, one
for ministers, and yet another for messages to

princes. There was a style for poetry, one for
treaties and contracts, one for finance, one for
defence and so on. It was a prosperous time for
the profession of calligrapher, which according
to Ibn al-Habib al-Halabi had become "the
noblest office, the best branch of knowledge
and the most profitable estate" of the period.
Each caliph had his accredited calligrapher,
a confidential adviser to whom he sometimes
even entrusted the management of his house¬
hold. One calligrapher, Ibn Muqla (b. 886) even
became a minister: it was he who, considering
Kufic too heavy for a period as refined as his,
invented a more flowing, rounded script
(nashki), and gave it a geometrical shape to make
it worthy of transcribing the Qur'an.
Ibn Muqla's reforms were not followed in
the western Arab world. From Egypt to
Andalusia, North African calligraphers, with
their more austere artistic traditions, refused to
give up Kufic, including the Maghribi script
and the many variants derived from it.
Thereafter there were two main schools of
calligraphy, that of Ibn al-Bawwab (eleventh
century), who improved on Ibn Muqla's pro¬
cedures, and that of al-Musta'simi (thirteenth
century), who improved the calamus by cut¬
ting its nib obliquely, thus giving finer upstrokes.
Some thirty languages have used the Arabic
alphabet. The Iranians created their own style,
and improved many others. The Ottomans were
the last great masters of the art of calligraphy.
Their empire saw the introduction of the ijaza,
a qualification which entitled the holder to teach
calligraphy. It produced some great calligra¬
phers, such as Shaikh al-Amassi in the sixteenth
century, who adapted the various scripts for
writing Ottoman Turkish, and Hafiz Uthman
(seventeenth century), who brought simplicity,
purity and grace to calligraphy.
Nowadays, with the development of televi¬
sion and modern methods of reproduction, con¬
temporary calligraphy has lost part of its raison
d'être. But it still remains on the look-out for a
new way forward, in order to advance the art of
writing. 21

and emeritus reader in African
languages at the University of
London. He is currently director
of the Observatoire Linguistique

An inspired invention
I Whereas the writing revolution the
I linear, visual representation of specific
spoken languages began only 5,000 years ago,
the use of graphic symbols to represent objects
and ideas, and to encapsulate magical and reli¬
gious values, is almost certainly as old as arti¬
culate speech itself.
It has sometimes been suggested that certain
traditional African symbols, such as those used
among the Akan-speaking peoples of Ghana,
were inspired by Ancient Egyptian hieroglyphs,
by that magnificent explosion of human writing
which took place in northeast Africa. It is more
probable, however, that the hieroglyphs them¬
selves drew an important part of their inspira¬
tion, 5,000 years ago, from even older tradi¬
tions of graphic symbolism in Africa itself.
Whereas a long tradition of writing seems to
have existed northwards and eastwards of the
Sahara and the Nile Valley, southwards stretches
an area whose cultures are associated primarily
with oral tradition. On the other hand, especially
in West Africa, there are strong traditions of
graphic symbolism and also many examples of
the modern evolution or design of "new" indige¬
nous systems of writing.
One of the most remarkable examples of
the use of graphic symbols in Africa is the com¬
plex system of pictograms and ideograms known
as Nsibidi (or Nsibiri), used traditionally in the
Cross River area of southeast Nigeria. The
system is known to have many usages, including
the use of symbols in combination to record
narratives, especially the evidence recorded in
by David Dalby
contentious love-affairs. Nsibidi symbols may
be engraved on calabashes and other domestic
objects, painted on walls, printed on cloth or tat¬
tooed or painted on the human body. They are
not associated with any one specific language but
are found in a multilingual area among speakers
of Ekoi, Igbo and Ibibio.
A curious tradition relates that the secrets of
Nsibidi were long ago revealed to men by a
species of large baboon called idiok. This legend
is above all reminiscent of the divine baboon
associated with Thoth, the patron of scribes in
ancient Egypt. These widely separated beliefs
about the same animal are unlikely to be pure
coincidence, and we are left with two other pos¬
sibilities. Was this a specifically Egyptian belief
which found its way over thousands of years and
thousands of kilometres to eastern Nigeria, or
was it perhaps an ancient and widely spread
belief in Black Africa which passed to Egypt

with the knowledge of traditional graphic sym¬
bols, a vital element in the elaboration of early
pictographic hieroglyphs?
bultan Njoya's dream
A short distance eastward from the traditional
area of Nsibidi, across the border in German
Cameroon, a remarkable cultural event occurred
just a century ago. This was the progressive
elaboration by Sultan Njoya of Foumban of an
independent and original system of writing for
the Bamum language.
Like several other inventors of African
writing systems, Njoya was inspired by a dream,
after which he asked his subjects to draw dif¬
ferent objects and to name them. Armed with
their results, he experimented until he had cre¬
ated his first system of writing, containing some
466 pictographic and ideographic symbols.
Forty years of experimentation and steady
progress led him to the use of his final a-ku-u-
ku syllabary, named after the first four of its
eighty characters.
Sultan Njoya was certainly a man of genius,
but it was his royal position which enabled him
to see his ideas through to completion by estab¬
lishing schools at which his subjects learned to
read and write, elaborating a system of printing
with hand-made copper dies and compiling
texts on the history and customs of his kingdom.
Unfortunately Njoya's achievements were
doomed by the outcome of the First World War.
Encouraged under German rule, Njoya's schools
were closed by the post-war colonial authorities,
and he destroyed his own printing system in
frustration. He was deposed in 1931 and exiled
until his death two years later.
A sacred script
The history of Njoya's system raises the possi¬
bility that the form and sudden appearance of
Egyptian writing may be explained in a similar
way, as the invention primarily of a single man,
highly enough placed to have the necessary
leisure for his task and for the result to have
been accepted without opposition among his
own people.
There is no evidence of any long evolution of
hieroglyphic writing in the beginning, and the
progress of a single inventor could explain the
complex structure of the Egyptian script in its
earliest recorded form, where different stages of
development appear already to be fused into a
single system.
Just as Njoya is known to have been
impressed, but in no way influenced, by the
Arabic script, so an Egyptian inventor may have
been stimulated by the slightly earlier invention of
a quite different writing system in Mesopotamia.
As in the documented cases of several indige¬
nous writing systems in West Africa, a claim
by its inventor to divine inspiration may be
assumed in the case of the Egyptian script also,
and such an origin was certainly the traditional
belief throughout the script's history. The sacred
and revealed nature of Egyptian writing made it
immune to any radical restructuring for thou¬
sands of years and limited its use to an initiated
elite. 23

A four-in-hand script
The composite nature of Japanese writing is an aid to flexibility and
effectiveness
by Shim Noda
The "sign of happiness" on a
wooden panel.
24
SHIRO NODA
is a Japanese historian and
linguist who is currently a
lecturer in the Japanese
department of France's National
Institute of Oriental Languages
and Civilizations in Paris. The
present article has been
abridged and adapted from a
longer study.
Although scholars still disagree about the
origins of the Japanese language, the ori¬
gins of its notation system are less obscure.
The notation system currently used in Japan
is a combination of four different forms: 1) kanji
(logograms); 2) hiragana and 3) katakana (syl-
labograms); and 4) roman (phonograms).
It is generally agreed that Japanese writing
dates back to the fifth century B.C., a period
when Chinese writing was formally introduced
into the country through Buddhist texts. Kanji
word signs are derived from Chinese writing,
which was then the prerogative of the intellectual
class. It was used at the imperial court, by the civil
service, and by Buddhist monks for reading and
transcribing religious documents. It was not used
by the mass of the people.
Despite its usefulness, Chinese notation had
one major drawback because of the basic differ¬
ence in the syntactical structure of the two lan¬
guages. It had to be adapted by giving a purely
Japanese reading to Chinese ideograms. A reading
system was invented for this purpose. It was
known as kaeriten (reference mark), an allusion
to the point put to the left of Chinese characters
to indicate the order in which they should be

read. But kanji was hard to apply to the language
of everyday life, and a Japanese sentence written
in kanji seemed highly unnatural.
I he voice of letters
This was the linguistic situation inJapan when, at
the beginning of the Heian period (late eighth and
early ninth centuries), the ladies of the imperial
court invented the cursive syllabary known as
hiragana, which consisted of signs derived from
Chinese characters but considerably simplified
and shaped in Japanese style. This was a crucial
moment in the evolution of the Japanese lan¬
guage, for the invention of hiragana was not a
mere morphological transformation of Chinese
characters. As an ideogram, a kanji character
could express an idea, a concept or an image, but
hiragana added a new dimension to Japanese
writing, namely the phonetic transcription that is
entirely independent of the ideographic system.
The great advantage that hiragana had over
kanji was that it enabled the Japanese to write
about daily life in everyday language. The inven¬
tion of hiragana encouraged the emergence of a
purely Japanese literature, of which The Tale of
Genji, written at the beginning of the eleventh
century by Murasaki Shikibu, a lady of the impe¬
rial court, is the most famous classical example.
Around the same time, towards the end of the
eighth century, a third type of writing (katakana)
was perfected by Buddhist monks in order to
make it easier to read the sutras and to encourage
the spread of Buddhism among the peasantry
Katakana follows the same principle of simpli¬
fying Chinese characters according to their pho-

netic value. Today katakana is used above all to
transcribe borrowings from other languages.
Dimplexity
It might be wondered why the Japanese have not
adopted one or another of the writing systems
(hiragana, katakana or roman), which would
make learning Japanese much easier, rather than
sticking to this combination of the four. The
answer is quite simple. The phonetic representa¬
tion systems ofJapanese call for a linear approach
that slows down the reading process and corre¬
spondingly delays understanding of the content,
whereas the globality of the logogram means that
it can be immediately recognized and understood
once it has been memorized. Paradoxically then,
the consequence of using four integrated kinds of
writing is that the effectiveness and flexibility of
Japanese writing is increased. The complexity of
the system is actually a simplifying factor. 25

The written word has always been closely associated with power. But literacy is a stepping
-c= stone to intellectual freedom as well as an instrument of authority, and has been a factor in the
I great revolutions of world history.

the emperor Charles V.
; We may never know what led up to the
appearance of writing at different times
and in different places. In the Far East, the ear¬
liest known examples were intended to facilitate
communication with the gods, whereas in the
Middle East their main purpose was the keeping
of accounts. At a later stage, writing was used to
record customary law and traditional tales for
posterity, while as a result of its use for com¬
mercial purposes in the Middle East it was grad¬
ually simplified, finally giving rise to alphabet¬
ical systems.

In parallel with these developments, society
conferred extraordinary power on those who
could write. In some parts of the world, writing
remained the preserve of the priesthood, while
in others, as in ancient Gaul, the priests refused
to set down the secrets of their religion in
writing. As a general rule, it long remained the
speciality of scribes, a situation found in places
as far apart as Mesopotamia, Egypt and China.
A passport to power
Having control over society's collective memory
and having been put in charge of drawing up its
laws, scribes established themselves as counsel¬
lors to the high and mighty and as judges with
authority over their fellow men, often creaming
off their share of the wealth they assessed and the
taxes they gathered. In such circumstances, the
Romans, tired of being judged and governed
according to rules of which they were ignorant,
when they had learned to read and write
demanded that the laws be displayed on wooden
boards in the Capitol.
At the time of the barbarian invasions of
western Europe, written culture took refuge in
the monasteries, which were anxious to pre¬
serve the sacred and liturgical texts. Much later,
after Europe had been reshaped, writing
emerged once more in the re-established towns,
and the feudal warlords who had imposed their
power were obliged to call upon the help of
clerks, specialists in the written word who carved
out for themselves a privileged place in the
young states of western Europe.
At the courts of the Renaissance princes,
the privy counsellor or secretary played a
prominent role, and most of the humanists
were drawn from the papal, Florentine or other
chancelleries, from among the learned men who
were responsible for the drafting of diplomatic,
legislative, legal or administrative documents.
In France, for example, such men who had
bought their way into office created a new social
category, giving rise to the noblesse de robe which
tried, not unsuccessfully, to claim for itself the
greater part of the power and wealth of the state.

I he law of the letter
Writing thus became an instrument of govern¬
ment, and hence of power, wielded by experts.
Simultaneously it imposed its own rationale on
the peoples that used it. By providing a stable
record of custom, it had the effect, over time, of
preventing custom from developing sponta¬
neously as a product of the collective con¬
sciousness, as the oral tradition allowed it to
do. It thus gradually subjected society to the
dominance of the law. The law, for its part, had
an author and a date, and was by definition
written, but it was shackled by its written form
and inevitably, with the passage of time, lost
touch with society's changing requirements,
leading to continual problems of interpretation.
Such developments were not, however, con¬
stant or inevitable. Systems of writing are still in
use today that maintain a more flexible relation¬
ship with the spoken language, systems that are the
product of a combination of factors the structure
of the language, the innate character of each people
and the influences to which it has been subjected
throughout its history. Furthermore, in the West
at least, the presentation of documents has evolved
constantly, in keeping with changes in society
and with society's complex relationship with the
spoken and written word.
The scrolls on which Cicero's speeches were
copied down, for instance, contained a contin¬
uous text without spaces between words or
paragraphs; they were meant to be read aloud
and understood by being heard. It was not until
the eleventh century that copyists got into the
habit of systematically separating words. The
thirteenth-century Summa Theologiae of St
Thomas Aquinas consists of dense pages,
bristling with abbreviations and with lots of
coloured signs appearing at intervals; set out in
the form of an oral disputation, it is divided
into articles proceeding from the particular to the
general in accordance with a stereotyped pattern
intended to keep the reasoning on the rails.
Later, with the invention of printing, the
paragraph as we now know it gradually came
into general use, with the spaces that give the eye
and the mind a rest, helping the reader to digest
what has just been read. It is surely no coinci¬
dence that Descartes' Discours de la méthode
(1637) was the first work of philosophy in
French to be set out in the modern style.
Because of these ways of presenting material
in print, the spoken language and the written
text the latter now intended to be read and
not spoken or heard have, in the West, gradu- 27

layout intended to convey the greatest possible

shortest possible time.
Uivide and rule
To understand the problems arising at the
receiving end of the writing process, we should
begin by discarding the widespread belief that
some types of writing are more functional than
others. It is now generally acknowledged that lit¬
eracy above all answers a need for decompart-
mentalization, for communication with the out¬
side world. The understanding of a text is not a
simple matter of technique: it also requires
readers to possess the necessary mental equip-

ment, a stock of concepts that will enable them
to establish a personal dialogue with the text.
One of the main effects of the emergence of
writing was to divide people into categories,
according to their capacities to master the
written word. Generally speaking, it soon
became necessary, in most societies, to be able at
least to read, if not to write, so as to be able to
decipher and learn the canonical texts or holy
scriptures. The religious or civil authorities
deemed it necessary above all to teach the rudi¬
ments of reading, i.e. a form of passive access to
the written word.
In Europe, for instance, children were first
taught to recognize letters and spell out Latin
prayers, writing being held over for a later and
often optional stage. The effect of this method,
applied mainly to girls (who, as a character in
one of Molière's plays says, should not learn to
write lest they should correspond with their
lovers), was to produce social categories of semi-
literates, who could often get to know texts
only by reading together in groups. For similar
reasons, it apparently was long-standing practice
to read aloud or in an undertone, particularly in
the case of women reading novels. Only those
who belonged to the ruling classes and who
had pursued lengthy studies in colleges or uni¬
versities were actually able to read silently to
themselves.

Thus Western societies remained for a long
time only very incompletely literate; some people
have claimed, no doubt with some slight exag¬
geration, that the great revolutions occurred
when more than half the population became lit¬
erate. It should also be borne in mind that,
throughout history, there was never a watertight
partition between written culture and oral tradi¬
tion. The great mass movements, such as the
heresies of the Middle Ages, the Reformation in
the sixteenth century, and the revolutions in
England in the seventeenth century, France at
the end of the eighteenth and Russia at the begin¬
ning of the twentieth were inspired by images,
songs and the spoken word as much as by writing.
People in the Middle Ages learned their reli¬
gion from the paintings on church walls. Even
today, we need only think of the place occupied,
in some parts of the world, by open-air
preaching or even soap-box oratory; of topical
songs and the stories told in the workplace or by
the fireside; of the many contacts between lit¬
erates and "educated" people, or of the role that
the self-taught so often play as intermediaries. It
was through all these channels that the theories
of such as Voltaire or Rousseau reached the rev¬
olutionary masses, who blithely claimed to have
been inspired by these thinkers without having
read their works.
Lastly, in the course of the last hundred
years, the new communications media have
brought recorded speech and the moving image
to the fore; but the effect of these technologies,
unlike that of reading, is to highlight emotion
and propaganda over a logical approach and
individual reflection.
The long evolution of writing in the West,
A peasants' university in
Leningrad in 1918.
from the invention of the first pictograms or
ideograms to the full transcription of speech
through phonetic signs, has run parallel with the
development of a logical, analytical spirit that
gives preference, over the transience of the
spoken word, to the written text, with all it
implies of stability or even fixity. While it is an
instrument of authority, writing thus also has a
power to liberate the mind that, by the same
token, makes it an instrument of liberation from
that authority.
One of the main effects of the emergence of writing was to
divide people into categories, according to their capacities to
master the written word.

SOME DEFINITIONS
ALPHABET: a system of signs expressing
the basic sounds of a language. Unlike
scripts of pictographic origin such as
cuneiform or hieroglyphic scripts based
on a large number of stylized symbols, an
alphabet reproduces at least consonant
sounds via a small number of simplified
symbols. After a long process of evolu¬
tion, the Phoenician alphabet of 22 letters
took shape around 1100 B.C., and later
spread to many cities on the Mediter¬
ranean rim. Around the 8th century B.C.,
it was adopted by the Greeks, who added
letters for the vowels, thus making the
world's first complete alphabet.
CALAMUS: a reed whittled to a point or
bevelled and used for writing and callig¬
raphy.
CALLIGRAM: a text, usually poetic, the
words of which are arranged so as to form
a decorative pattern (also known as pat¬
tern poetry).
CODEX: to replace papyrus scrolls, which
were awkward to handle, sheets of parch¬
ment bound into the form of a book or
codex (plural codices) first appeared in
Rome in the 1st century A.D. Very long
documents could be reproduced in this
form.
CUNEIFORM: cuneiform ("wedge-
shaped") script, which first appeared
between 4000 and 3000 B.C. in
Mesopotamia, may be the world's oldest
form of writing. Originally pictographic,
its signs (about 550 derived from the per¬
mutation of 4 basic elements) gradually
came to have syllabic values, enabling
phonemes as well as objects to be desig¬
nated. This process was accompanied by
a reduction in the number of signs and a
simplification of their forms, leading even¬
tually to the creation, in Phoenicia, of the
first alphabet.
GLYPH: a writing sign incised or carved on
materials such as stone, as in pre-
Columbian civilizations.
HIEROGLYPHIC: Egyptian pictographic
or figurative writing used as early as the
4th millennium B.C., in which each hiero¬
glyph or sign (among some 700) repre¬
sented an object. Ideograms were also
used to express certain ideas, and phono¬
grams to render sounds. A strikingly suc¬
cessful use of hieroglyphs (etymological
meaning = "writing of the gods") was for
monumental inscriptions.
ICON: a sign that imitates the object it
describes, e.g. the drawing of a house to
represent a house.
IDEOGRAM: the representation of a mes¬
sage or an idea by means of drawings, in
some cases schematic and symbolic. Sev¬
eral varieties of ideographic writing arc
known, including cuneiform, Egyptian
hieroglyphics and Chinese.
PHONEME: a unit of spoken speech
(vowel or consonant).
PHONOGRAM: a sign or part of a sign
representing a word, a syllable or a
phoneme. The basis of alphabetical
writing, the signs of which represent only
sounds.
PICTOGRAM (OR PICTOGRAPH): an ele¬
ment in writing that represents an object
by means of stylized signs or symbols.
Each pictogram has a specific use, but an
abstract idea may be expressed by com¬
bining several of them. The first stage in
writing.

M M N T A
A colossus with feet of clay
32
The sight of this starving
child pains me/Like a great
thorn", wrote that giant of Spanish
poetry Miguel Hernández. What
would he write today if he knew
that only a few months ago a radio
station in Rwanda was broad¬
casting messages urging the
murder of children, or if he had
seen the television pictures of
corpses with hands tied behind
their backs floating in the waters of
Lake Victoria? He would say that
a society which tolerates the intolerable is a society in
decline. He would say that intellectuals should show
their indignation, not just by speaking out, but, above
all, by taking action so that such events can never
happen again.
Since the end of the Cold War and the decline of
the Soviet regime, long-standing conflicts have re-
emerged and new ones rooted in national, cultural,
ethnic and socio-economic differences are erupting
into violence.
It is a good moment to repeat that a war is never
won. Never mind that history books tell us the
opposite. The psychological and material costs of
war are so high that any triumph is a Pyrrhic victory.
Only peace can be won and winning peace means not
only avoiding armed conflict but finding ways of
eradicating the causes of individual and collective
violence: injustice and oppression, ignorance and
poverty, intolerance and discrimination. We must
construct a new set of values and attitudes to replace
the culture of war which, for centuries, has been
influencing the course of civilization. Winning peace
means the triumph of our pledge to establish, on a
democratic basis, a new social framework of tolerance
and generosity from which no one will feel excluded.
A rich but vulnerable world
We are living in a time of hope. The expectations of
peace, co-operation and development raised by the
changes in the last five years can still be met. Rapid
advances in science and technology hold out the
possibility that we will discover new solutions to
many social problems, such as unemployment and
drugs. In terms of public health, medical research
gives grounds for hope that pandemic diseases such
as Aids and cancer may be eliminated. The spec¬
tacular development of the media provides new
opportunities for education and culture. Com¬
puters and fibre optics have brought a new dimen¬
sion, unthinkable until recently, to the organization
and dissemination of knowledge and to data pro¬
cessing and resource management.
And yet this world so rich in resources, knowl¬
edge and experience, shaped by the most progressive
and dynamic societies ever known, is extremely
vulnerable. As in the biblical dream of king Neb¬
uchadnezzar, we stand before a colossus made of
precious metal but with feet of clay. An exclusively
quantitative view of progress and an obstinate atti¬
tude of consumerism and wastefulness are daily
creating an ever-widening gap between a minority
which enjoys the benefits of progress and the
immense majority of the world's inhabitants, for
whom well-being and a minimum standard of living
still seem a distant mirage.
Aprecarious balance
At a time when the Western countries are entering
the age of "information superhighways", there are
around the world 600,000 human settlements
without electricity. At a time when the industrial¬
ized countries of the North have millions of uni¬
versity-educated men and women unable to find
employment, the countries of the South are home
to 900 million illiterate people, often working in
subhuman conditions.
As long as this breach widens, life on our planet
will become ever more precarious. For the same sci¬
entific and technological development that made
possible the opulent life-style of the industrialized
North has also brought the world together in a dra¬
matic fashion. Today more than ever, the world is one.
The drought or war that leads to an exodus from an
African country also affects its European neigh¬
bours, further complicating the economic crisis and
compounding the problem of unemployment by
that of massive and uncontrolled emigration. How¬
ever, the reverse is also true: an economic crisis which
destroys an industry in North America or Australia
may leave a South American peasant or a Central
Asian miner without the means of subsistence.

B Y FEDERICO A Y O R
Nothing illustrates this situation better than
environmental issues. The irrational use of fertil¬
izers, the accumulation of nuclear waste, air, water
and soil pollution, loss of biologicial diversity, deple¬
tion of certain non-renewable resources these are
some of the dangers which threaten our entire
planet, because the degradation of the natural envi¬
ronment knows no frontiers.
UNESCO is endeavouring by various means
to stimulate debate and encourage the search for
solutions that will reverse those trends, reduce the
growing disparity between the standard of living of
the industrialized North and the developing South,
foster scientific and cultural creativity and pro¬
mote peace.
Unfortunately, our society is still shaped, essen¬
tially, by the culture of war. The production appa¬
ratus of the modern world is closely linked to the
military machine. Now that the Cold War is over
and democratic trends are providing us with addi¬
tional safeguards of international peace, we realize
that we are not prepared to confront the most
serious and urgent dangers which threaten the
future of our civilization. We are prepared for the
past; we are not prepared for the present.
Events after 1989 were expected to bring about
a re-evaluation of the concepts of defence and secu¬
rity throughout the world. Yet the conceptual re-
evaluation has not thus far led to any significant
reduction in defence spending. The much-touted
and eagerly awaited "peace dividend" has failed to
result in massive investments in education, public
health or aid to developing countries and other sec¬
tors where public action is urgently needed.
The view of progress and development that has
prevailed until very recently is in need of a thor¬
ough overhaul: the idea that development is little
more than growth, and that raising industrial pro¬
duction indexes and boosting the consumption of
electricity is enough to modernize a country and
provide a better future for its people. This mistaken
belief results in the imposition from outside of devel¬
opment models which fail to take due account of
the historical, cultural and psychological particu¬
larities of the people to whom they are applied. One
consequence of this approach is the enormous mate¬
rial and emotional price paid by many countries
which have been obliged by international financial
institutions to implement economic structural adjust¬
ment policies.
The crucial question facing us today is who
will reap the benefit of development. Are our
efforts directed towards the men and women of
tomorrow, the generations who will inherit the
earth, or are we acting to satisfy short-sighted
economic interests or crude ambitions of power? At
the beginning of this century, another Spanish
poet, Miguel de Unamuno, was already vigorously
criticizing this conception of progress. "We must
produce," he wrote, "produce as much as possible
in all fields at the least cost, and then let the human
species collapse at the foot of the monumental
tower of Babel, overburdened with goods,
machines, books, paintings, statues, tokens of
worldly glory and history!"
The consumerist Tower ofBabel
Above all let us not yield to the siren song of unre¬
strained consumption. Having freed ourselves from
communism, we must now liberate ourselves from
consumerism. The idea that consumption can expand
indefinitely is untenable. The risk of exhausting non¬
renewable resources, the need to avoid pollution and
environmental degradation, and the threats to the
ozone layer, to biological diversity, to the health and
well-being of future generations and to the natural
and cultural heritage of humankind are the strongest
arguments against any fantasy of unlimited con¬
sumption for the next century.
It is essential to counter that mirage with a vision
of all-round, sustainable development, having due
regard for the environment, consumption based on
quality and not on quantity, and a rehabilitation of
spiritual values which will help reorder our priori¬
ties and which must necessarily lead to frugality
and ecological restraint. In the coming decades,
quality of life will be increasingly bound up with
austerity and a responsible attitude towards the
environment.
Nebuchadnezzar's dream ends as follows: "A
fallen stone, not thrown by anyone, struck the
statue on its feet of clay, and destroyed it". Our civ¬
ilization, this highly complex machine, with its
extraordinary achievements in such diverse realms
as the arts, science, industry and culture, is like
the biblical colossus. If we fail to correct properly
the imbalances which threaten it, if we fail to
achieve harmony among all peoples in a frame¬
work of justice and dignity, if we are not capable of
leaving a habitable planet to future generations,
then we shall become daily more like a statue with
feet of clay, at the mercy of a pebble hurled at us by
blind fate.

Perched 3,000 metres up in the high plateaux of the
Andes, Ecuador's capital has a remarkable historic
centre which in 1978 won it aplace on UNESCO's World
Heritage List.
Once upon a time a Spanish
hidalgo is supposed to have said
to his architect: "Draw me the
plans for a big square patio with a few
rooms around it." Even today, in the his¬
toric centre of Quito and on the outskirts
of the old city, there arc still some low,
white houses of this kind, their red tiles
darkened by time. Each one has a wood
and wrought-iron gate opening onto a
large inner courtyard where grey paving
stones and inlaid yellow ox-hones form
geometric motifs around a fountain. The
"master of the great house" would ride
into the courtyard on horseback, and his
tenants would unload the farm produce
they had brought on mules or carts.
Around the patio were rooms with barred
windows. Here, at dusk, came girls
seeking to escape the tedium of their
secluded lives or be serenaded by their
official suitors.
It is bard to say whether this type of
architecture sprang from or gave rise to
a specific conception of urban plan¬
ning. What is certain is that the con¬
quistadors were instinctive if untutored
town-planners and that here as in all
other American cities they first marked
out a central patio-like square around
which they built a church, a governor's
residence, an archbishop's palace and
a town hall. Then, after the land had
been divided between the conquista¬
dors and the religious authorities, they

Quito, a city

drew up a regular street-plan. To recap¬
ture something of old Quito, the munic¬
ipality is restoring to these streets their
original names: the Street of Forges,
the Jewellers' Street, the Street of the
Seven Crosses; the Hill of Sighs, the
Hill of the Torrent; the Crossroads of
Souls, of the Virgin, of the Toad. These
narrow streets were intended for horses
and carriages no vehicle could even
enter the Street of the Night Watch, a
winding alley lit with ancient lanterns
and the buses that pass through them
today almost scrape the walls.
From the city centre to the suburbs
narrow streets lined with little houses
stretch like the open fingers of a hand,
following the haphazard contours of
the city until they reach the clouds at an
altitude of almost 3,000 metres. Is it
the rarefied air that imposes on Quito

the slow rhythm, the sense of time to
spare that made Henri Michaux say:
"Here we all smoke the opium of high
altitude, speak in low voices, take short
steps, are short of breath. The dogs
fight little, and so do the children; there
is little laughter."?
A mayor of Quito once decided that
the walls of the houses should be
painted white and the woodwork of
doors and windows blue, with the
result that the city came to resemble (in
this respect only) certain Mediter¬
ranean towns. Then someone remem¬
bered that in the eighteenth century
the main buildings in the city centre
had had coloured facades (in 1757 a
traveller noted that "Façades white¬
washed from top to bottom in gaudy
colours are not rare") and so they were
repainted yellow, green or blue. In the
modern public buildings in the resi¬
dential area in the north of the city on
the other hand, the dominant colour is
the grey of concrete and the smoked
glass windows that protect against the
bright sunlight which because the sky
is so near? is unlike that found any¬
where else in the world. 35

The ornate interior of the Cathedral (1559-1562).
SYMBOLS OF POWJElt
Plaza Mayor, also known as Plaza de la
Independencia because of the inde¬
pendence monument put up there in
1906 or simply as Plaza Grande, is
the symbol of the life of the city. This
place where people met to exchange
political gossip and rumours, to show
dissension, to fetch water, listen to a
band or be photographed, is freer,
more open and peaceful than it once
was. The prison-like iron railings that
once surrounded it have been removed
and its fountains have gone; it has been
beautified with flower beds and benches
for the retired and the unoccupied.
On one side of the square is the
cathedral. Originally a modest wattle
and daub construction, it has con¬
stantly been extended and embellished
since the sixteenth century. Its coffered
ceiling, the copy of a Spanish Moorish
original, dates from the mid-nineteenth
century. The "cinderella of American
cathedrals" in comparison with those of
Mexico or Lima, it has wonderful gilt
altars on a par with those of other Quito
churches, whose insolent splendour
overwhelms the visitor and contrasts
with the poverty of the faithful and the
wretchedness of the beggars at their
gates.
Opposite the cathedral, symbol of
divine power, is the archbishop's
palace, the encapsulation of ecclesias¬
tical power. Two dates, 1852 and 1920,
arc inscribed in Roman figures on its
façade. A surprising feature of this neo
classical building is a loggia on its upper
storey whose symmetrical columns are
joined by a balustrade and surmounted
at each end by a triangular pediment.
The governor's palace is equally neo¬
classical. Inside, on each side of a mon¬
umental staircase, is another patio. Its
façade is adorned with a massive doric
colonnade giving onto the square and
two lateral structures surmounted by
triangular tympani. Inaugurated in
1830 when the Republic was pro¬
claimed, it was the last architectural
project of the colonial power. A plaque

tyrant was assassinated in 1875 with a
machete wielded by a jealous husband
(although he was not necessarily moti¬
vated by jealousy) and, decked out in
his ceremonial uniform and seated on a
throne, presided over his own funeral
in the cathedral.
In the lower part of the building,
whose stones are thought to have been
brought from a distant Inca monument,
are a number of small shops where sou¬
venir sellers will sell you trashy objects
which are poor imitations of the tradi¬
tional indigenous craftsmanship which
has for generations produced wonders
in gold, filigree, wrought iron, wood,
wax and vegetable ivory, and will even
propose counterfeit "shrunken heads."
The building which has had the most
checquered career is the municipal
building. It began as "a hut on a plot of
land belonging to the king" in 1538 a
rough-and-ready town hall for a city
bursting at the seams with gold. It was
rebuilt many times before being demol¬
ished and its site used as a car park.

the present building, which dates from
1974, seek to harmonize with the other
buildings around the Plaza Grande.

buttons, crocheting hooks and knitting
needles at the entrance, and were; a
familiar feature of the Quito landscape.
Today, only five of them are left and
they have moved to the entrance to the
Plaza de Santo Domingo. On the Plaza
Grande they were for a time replaced
by itinerant vendors of smuggled
watches, cigarette lighters, spectacles
and personal stereos, and hawkers of
cigarettes, chewing gum, razor blades
and lottery tickets.
AN ASSORTMENT OF
ARCHITECTURAL STYLUS
Around the turn of the century, a
number of buildings in a variety of
styles were constructed around the
Plaza Grande: the old university, a
bank which is no longer a bank, a hotel
which used to boast of offering its cus¬
tomers the opportunity to see parades,
processions and revolutions "from their
bed". The hotel is an example of.what
might be called architectural esperanto:
each of its storeys is built in a different
style to produce what has been called "a
highly interesting piece of eclecticism".
In Garcia Moreno street, once the
street of the seven crosses, an assort¬
ment of civil and military architecture
spanning the sixteenth and the twen¬
tieth centuries arches, columns,
vestibules, porticos is concentrated
into barely 200 metres. Religious archi¬
tecture is represented by the churches
of the Sagrario, La Compañía de Jesús
and San Francisco. All of them house
art treasures paintings, sculptures
and gold leaf of the celebrated Quito
school, works by indigenous artists such
as Caspicara and Pampite and mestizo
artists such as Miguel de Santiago who
have been compared with Zurbarán.
The church of San Francisco and
its adjoining convent occupy three
hectares in the centre of Quito. They
have been dubbed "an Escurial in the
Andes", although their construction
began before that of the Escurial in
Spain barely fifty days after the foun¬
dation of Quito by the Spaniards on 6
December 1535. It is said that the fore¬
court was completed in a single night by
the devil in order to gather in a tor¬
mented soul who was eluding his grasp.
The work took so long, and the Fran¬
ciscans asked Charles V for so much
money to build the towers, that the
emperor emerged every evening onto
the balcony of bis palace in Toledo,
convinced that he would be able to see
them in the distance. Later they were
reduced to rubble by an earthquake.
On the church's curious perron of
concentric semi-circular steps all kinds
of spin-off of faith are for sale: incense,
medallions, sacred images, decorated
candles. And on the vast square, where
until the beginning of the century water
carriers filled their buckets at the foun¬
tain with water to sell from door to
door, all kinds of people come and go,
including the Indians whom Michaux
saw, "thick-set, broad-headed, walking
with short steps", wrapped in blue, red
or grey ponchos and carrying on their
backs a refrigerator or a cupboard
roped to their forehead. On Good
Friday this is the culminating point for
a procession of hooded figures who fla¬
gellate themselves with thongs and
chains, a form of penitence not uncon¬
nected with masochistic exhibitionism.

hill of San Juan, where needy citizens
and the flotsam and jetsam of the rural
exodus colonize the hitherto bare slopes.
It is true that tunnels, jerry-built
mini-expressways, level and unlevel
crossings, supermarkets, ministries and
impersonal hotels have been built, but
only in the residential north, a city
apart which has nothing in common
with that which UNESCO has proclaimed
part of the "universal heritage of
mankind" except its proximity to the
mountains. Quito obstinately refuses
any kind of modernization, as ifwisliing
to continue to merit the titles of "Flo¬
rence of America" or "Rome in the
tropics" which it owes only to its geo¬
graphical situation. Other names
"Quito, ante-chamber of paradise",
"Quito two steps away from heaven"
or an old popular refrain, "On earth

Quito" situate it near to the empyrean.
In one film a gangster dreams of doing

to the doors of restaurants and offering
diners and passersby flowers which are
as sad as they are and which, like them,

"Entwined lovers", a 17th-century Persian miniature.
Mirzâ Mohammad-Ali, also
known as Sâ'cb of Tabriz, is
one of the most brilliant post-
classical Persian poets. He was born in
Isfahan, then the capital of the Persian
empire, in 1607 (400 years ago according
to the Islamic calendar) into a family of
merchants from Tabriz who had trav¬
elled to Isfahan in search of fame and
fortune. At the age of twenty, already a
competent prose writer and calligrapher,
he began to make his mark as a poet.
He may have inherited his early taste
for poetry from one of his ancestors,
Shams-6-Maqrebi, a mystic poet of the
fourteenth century.
Sâ'eb began to attend court but was
disappointed by the atmosphere there.
Torn by centuries of dissension and inva¬
sions, Persia was beginning to regain its
cohesion under the iron hand of the
Safavids. Hut the rulers of this new
dynasty began to impose the Shi'ite faith
on the Iranian people, causing social dis¬
ruption which led numerous intellectuals
to flee from Isfahan, where theologians
held sway and made no attempt to hide
their fierce hostility to poets, philoso¬
phers and mystics. Sâ'eb described the
situation in one of his poems, when he
wrote: "Today intelligence and reason
hardly count any more; it is an age of
wo turbans and well-filled bellies".
Sâ'eb of Tabriz
prince ofpoets
by Hossein Esmaili
As a result of this, Sâ'eb left Persia
for India. On the way he stayed for three
years with a fellow poet, Zafar Khan,
the governor of Kabul. When he arrived
in India he entered the service of the
Mughul emperor, Shahjahân, who was a
great admirer of Persian literature and
entertained him with lavish hospitality.
lie also received a warm welcome from
the other court poets, who admired his
style of writing.
In 1633, his father joined him and
persuaded him to return home. Rack in
Isfahan, where he lived until his death in
1675, he was given the title "Prince of
poets" by Shah Abbas IT and alternated
between life at court and periods of iso¬
lation and retreat. He wrote many pan¬
egyrics and a historical epic in honour of
the king, but mainly worked in the lyrical
vein of love poetry known as ghazal
short, elegantly written poems that
brought him fame and ensured his place
in posterity.
AN ENIGMATIC ITGUHF
Sâ'eb was the most celebrated poet of his
day. His contemporaries read all his
poems they could get their hands on,
and yet he complained that he was unap¬
preciated and misunderstood. He was,
and remains, an enigmatic figure. In
spite of his great reputation in central
Asia and India, the literary critics
largely ignored him, and many of his
poems were not published, although he
was rightly considered one of the mas¬
ters of the "Indian style" in Persian
poetry. A hallmark of his style was his
investigation of subtle ideas and his
sometimes immoderate taste for com¬
plicated rhetorical figures. lie loved to
frequent tea houses, where he was
admired by down-to-earth people who
quoted so often from his poems that they
became well-known sayings. He could
not stand the literary scholars who belit¬
tled him for his lack of rigour and his
vocabulary larded with popular expres¬
sions.
Sâ'eb was a complete poet, a man
who saw the world only through the
prism of poetry. Unlike his predeces¬
sors, who went in for exotic and obscure
metaphors, he was interested in the most
trivial details of daily life and con¬
structed his literary world out of hum¬
drum actions and events. He used poetic
subjectivity to adorn reality with the
colours of dreams, to give it rhythm and
elegance. For Sâ'eb everything has
meaning and poetry: the gentle murmur
of running water evokes the impercep¬
tible passage of time; the ancient tree
whose roots stretch into the bowels of
the earth suggests that an old man clings
to life with more determination than a
young one; the bread that is easily
removed from a cold oven illustrates
how easy it is to free oneself from a world
without warmth.
Sâ'eb's constant association of mirror
images and ideas is ideally suited to Per¬
sian poetry, in which the two lines of a
couplet complement or contradict each
other. Sâ'eb's art breaks reality down
into a multitude of poetic images and
can be compared to the work of a minia¬
turist who builds up a scene from a
crowd of tiny shapes.
The four-hundredth anniversary of
the birth of the "Prince of poets" is an
opportunity to rediscover his exquisite
works and to shed new light on an orig¬
inal and elegant form of poetry that is
still not widely known. I

GREENWATCH
ENVIRONMENT-
FRIENDLY OMAN
by France Bequette
Loading up with ice
at Sur, a port on
the Gulf of Oman,
before embarking
on a fishing
expedition.
t:
I he Omanis like to claim that
after Singapore theirs is the
cleanest country in the world.
It is certainly spotless. At the air¬
port, the grey marble floor shines
like a mirror. Not a scrap of waste
paper or speck of dust can be seen.
Parked outside are gleaming cars.
A determined effort to keep Oman
clean is backed up by radio and
TV messages and enforced by hefty
fines ($100 or thereabouts for a
dirty car or a cigarette butt thrown
from a window), while an army of
sweepers in orange uniforms work
night and day on the roads, picking
up any rubbish that might, in spite
of all the precautions, have fallen by
the wayside. Even out in the desert
rubbish bins white-painted for¬
mer oil jerrycans bearing the name
of the nearest town. are emptied at
regular intervals. The capital,
Muscat, stretches for kilometres
along the coast and is made up of
white houses built in the approved
Arab style, surrounded by trees
and flowers. Water tanks, aerials
and air-conditioners are hidden
from view by variants of the wooden
screens that are typical of the Arab
world.
Oman is about the size of the
Rritish Isles anil has a population
of almost 2 million. It has a very
wide spectrum of landscapes and
soils. Covering 300,000 square
kilometres on the southeastern
tip of the Arabian Peninsula, it is
bordered on the north and west
by the United Arab Emirates and
Saudi Arabia and on the south¬
west by Yemen. The coastline
stretches 1,700 kilometres from
the Strait of Hormuz, along the
Gulf of Oman to the Arabian sea.
The country's northern tip,
Musandam, is a rocky peninsula
indented by fjord-like coves.
There is a fertile coastal plain
(the Ratinah), a mountain range
(Jabal al-Akhdar) that rises to
3,000 metres, and vast stretches
of desert.
SLAKING THE SULTANATE'S
THIRST
Although heavy monsoon rains
fall on the Dhofar in the south
from June to September, the cli¬
mate in the hinterland is dry and
hot with annual rainfall no more
than 100 mm. However, down¬
pours may be so violent that the
rivers (ivadi). which are usually
dry, overflow their banks and
sweep everything before them.
Water is a major preoccupa¬
tion for the Omani government.
In March 1994, for example, the
Minister for Water Resources
sounded the alarm about steeply
rising consumption. The restric
tions are not felt in Muscat,
which is supplied by a sea-water
desalination plant, but between
May and August (when tempera¬
tures hit 43°C in the shade) agri¬
culture consumes 100 million
cubic metres per month, i.e. 94
per cent of total consumption.
According to the Minister, 80 per
cent of the rainwater is lost to
run-off into the sea, and 5 per
cent to evaporation. In 1985 a
recharge dam was built near
Muscat to collect rainwater des¬
cending from the mountains.
Five more have been built since
then, and some fifty more are
scheduled to be built in the next
few years.
To prevent groundwater
reserves from being exhausted,
irrigation wells cannot be drilled
without government permission.
The number of requests is alar¬
ming 9,090 in three years, 6,365
of which have been approved,
bringing the total number of wells
to 167,000. This is worrying
because reserves of fossil water,
so called because it dates from
ancient times when there was
more rain in the region, are not
being replenished in today's arid
climate. The less used the better,

although reserves are estimated
at 955 million m3 and research is
going on to determine whether
there is any groundwater at
deeper levels. Forty-nine field
teams tour the country to check
well registration, record well cha¬
racteristics and take samples of
the water to assess its quality.
The data are entered into a data¬
base from which statistics and
maps can be compiled. The wells
must not be too close to the sea
because of the risk of intrusion
by sea water. Date palms in the
Ratinah have a limited toleration
of brackish water and have been
dying off.
KING SOLOMON'S WELLS
Water management in Oman is
not a recent invention. A remar¬
kable system of irrigation chan¬
nels, known as Jalaj, was esta¬
blished about 2,500 years ago
and is still in perfect working
order today. Legend has it that
Solomon, King David's son,
came to Oman on a magic carpet
with his djinn spirits who
could assume human or animal

eastern Hajar
mountains between
Muscat and Sur.

form and built 10,000 chan¬
nels in ten days. Water is tapped
at the water table in the moun¬
tains and flows to the plains
along man-made tunnels from
three to ten kilometres long.
Every 150 metres smaller wells
have been dug into the tunnel to
facilitate inspection. Where the
tunnel emerges from the rock
the watercourse divides into a
series of narrow channels, some
made of concrete. Ancient docu¬
ments explain the water distri¬
bution system. Some 200 land¬
owners have permanent right of
access to a water channel, and
many more enjoy temporary
rights. A flow of forty-five litres
per second irrigates forty hec¬
tares and serves about 1,000
people. A breach is made in the
earth walls that surround each
field, and closed when sufficient
water has flowed through. Then
the process is repeated for the
next field. The same irrigation
system is used in Iran, China
and, oddly enough, in the
Valais, the Swiss part of the
upper Rhône Valley.
The small black fish wrig¬
gling in the falaj act as garbage
collectors. Unfortunately, they
do not touch the larvae of the
anopheles, the mosquitos that
carry the parasite responsible
for malaria. In 1990 a pro¬
gramme to eradicate malaria
was launched in Ibra, 100 kilo¬
metres south of Muscat. At the
time there were 4,419 recorded
cases of falciparum, the most
virulent form of the disease.
Today there are a mere forty
cases. The task is enormous, for
it involves monitoring a zone
representing 12 per cent of the
country's area and inhabited by
250,000 people. The area was
divided up into 4-km2 districts,
each of which was sprayed daily
with Temefosum, an insecticide
that is non-toxic to humans and
the environment. The insecticide
is sprayed wherever the ano¬
pheles are likely to reproduce,
in wadis, watercourses, wells
and tanks. The results have
been spectacular.
THE RETURN OF
THE WHITE ORYX
The reintroduction of the white
oryx, sponsored by the World
Wide Fund for Nature (WWF),
is another environmental success
story. Sultan Qaboos imported
from zoos in the United States
several couples of this long-
horned African antelope that
had been hunted to extinction,
and they have since prospered.
The sanctuary where they live
has recently been added to
UNESCO's World Heritage List.
Five species of turtle studied
by WWF and the World Conser¬
vation Union (IUCN) over the
past twelve years have not fared
so well. Wolves, foxes, gulls,
ravens, ghost crabs, carnivorous
fish, seabirds and local people
are all enamoured of their flesh
and eggs. Human consumption is

existed for 7,000 years but it
must be vigorously resisted if
hawksbill and green turtles are
to be saved from extinction.
Another problem facing
Oman is that of coastal pollution.
IUCN representative Rodney
Salm spent seven years from 1984
to 1992 working on a coastal zone
management programme for the
Sultanate. His reports warn
against oil and tar pollution on
the beaches, partly due to illegal
discharge of oil by ships at sea,
the mining of sand for building,
encroaching new roads, rotting
fish refuse and the dumping of
waste. The migratory birds for
which Oman is justly famous may
no longer be able to alight on the
reed-bordered lagoons, for seven
of the seventeen sites are
seriously threatened. Corals,
some species of which are unique,
are being damaged by fishing
nets, anchors and litter such as
plastic bags and empty paint tins.
The Ministry of Regional
Municipalities and Environment
is taking the situation in hand. A
royal decree on the conservation
of the environment and the pre¬
vention of pollution was promul¬
gated in 1982. In 1993 the
ministry published a booklet
tracing twenty-three years of
action in response to these pro¬
blems. In answer to marine pol¬
lution by oil spillage, Oman is

Arab states grows from about 240 million to over

that the vast, 790,000-hectare Virunga (Vol¬

the after-effects of the civil war in Rwanda.
Almost two million Rwandans have taken refuge
in Goma, about 50 kilometres from the Park.
Last June almost a million poachers were taking
between 410 and 770 tons of forest products
(especially fuelwood) from the Park each day. By
early November, nearly 300 km2 had been
either partially or totally deforested. In 1989
there were 23,000 hippopotamuses in the

TRI Mt PARALYSIS

PANA reports from Harare (Zimbabwe) that spe¬

terious disease that has afflicted elephants in
the country during the past few years. The ail¬
ment, known as Flaccid Trunk Paralysis (FTP),
makes it painful for the pachyderms to raise
their trunks, thus to eat properly. It may be
caused by lead poisoning, toxic wastes such as
used batteries, or perhaps the pollution caused
by motor boats. Although the syndrome first
appeared on Fothergill Island, a tourist centre
in the north of the country, twelve cases were
reported in July 1994 in the Matusadonha
area, far from the island.

A MODEL III Ml*
At Champteussé-sur-Baconne in France's Loire
valley, toxic waste is being dumped on a 40-
hectare site which is a model of its kind. The
25,000 tons of waste that arrive annually are
sorted and loaded into polyethylene sacks
before being placed in deep honey-comb-shaped
holes excavated in the Clay soil. The holes are
lined with "geomembranes"high-density poly¬
ethylene tarpaulins and geotextiles such as
felt. Rainwater is collected in pipes, regularly
analysed, and when necessary channeled into
a purification plant. French law requires that
each region of the country should have a class-
1 dump, designed to receive the most highly
toxic wastes. However, no new dump has been
opened for the past 12 years, whereas from 2
to 6 milllion tons of toxic wastes are produced
annually.

4,000 of them currently in operation, sup¬
plying almost 3% of the country's electricity, i.e.
roughly half the capacity of a nuclear power
plant. One reason for the growing number of tur¬
bines is that people who invest in them enjoy
tax relief. As the windiest sites on land are
starting to become saturated, the Danes are
now building off-shore turbines. They cost
more, but the sea breeze is an inexhaustible
resource.

GENEVA'S INSTITUTE
OF DEVELOPMENT STUDIES
The Institute of Development
Studies (IUED) in Geneva
(Switzerland) was founded in
1961 by the Canton of Geneva as a
centre for African students and for
research and discussion on Third
World issues. Since then its activities
have expanded considerably to pro¬
vide professional training in devel¬
opment and access to the latest
research, especially in health care.
Today the Institute has a library con¬
taining more than 50,000 volumes, a
periodicals service with 1,100 jour¬
nals, and a documentation centre
with 1,200 information dossiers filed
by country, subject and institution.
The Institute provides teaching
via lectures, seminars and modules
leading to a diploma in advanced
studies, a research diploma or a doc¬
torate. The students are from Italy,
Romania, Finland, Benin, Senegal,
China and the Philippines, as well as
from Switzerland. The Institute helps
them to draw up development pro¬
jects and to find their bearings when
they go into the field.
A Studies and Projects Service
provides follow-up to ensure that
the Institute's operational contracts
in developing countries are suc¬
cessfully completed, working in
tandem with local institutions and
bolstering their expertise. For
example, the IUED is involved in a
four-year, 12-million Swiss-franc
water project in Niger that is
designed to help Niger's Hydraulics
and Environment Ministry to supply
villages with water, manage ground¬
water resources and train staff. In
Benin 7 million Swiss francs have
been invested to help improve the
health of the inhabitants of Borgou
and Zou provinces. A project in
Madagascar is designed to reorga¬
nize Antananarivo's central phar¬
macy, publish a therapeutic guide
for doctors and strengthen the net¬
work of community pharmacies by
improving the delivery of medicines
and training staff. At Cap-IIaitien in
Haiti the goal is to improve living
conditions by organizing the collec¬
tion and recycling of domestic waste
into compost which is then offered to
small farmers and nurseries in the
vicinity. Similar aid has been given
to a group of women in Tejalpa
Morelos, Cuernavaca (Mexico) to
help them recycle waste.

An international debate
on literature today and tomorrow
Between 1988 and 1994, UNESCO and PEN International organized a series of symposia on
the theme of literary creation on the eve of the third millennium. At the meetings, held within
the framework of the Decade for Cultural Develoment, writers from South America, Africa,
Asia and the Arab world discussed the main aspects of creative writing in their respective
regions today.
LATIN AMERICA:
GOING FOR RAROQUE
A meeting on "The dynamic role of the
Latin American and Caribbean literatures
in world literature", held in Brasilia from
18 to 21 April 1988, was attended by sev¬
eral hundred writers and intellectuals from
sixteen countries in the region.
The participants were particularly
struck by the way in which urban themes
have taken the place of rural subjects.
Rampant urbanization has brought a
change of perspective and sensibility to
the Latin American novel. Instead of the
compassionate but distant treatment of
indigenous people found in the socially
committed "peasant novel", the "urban
novel" presents a picture of the indige¬
nous condition viewed from within. The
description of the urban landscape, or
rather its recreation in a work of literature,
is one of the triumphs of this genre.
However, Nature is intensely present
and lends itself to symbolization of such
luxuriance that European languages col¬
lapse under the strain. Some people have
even wondered whether they should not
be regarded as dead languages. But this
would be a mistake because Latin Amer¬
ican writers enrich these languages and
adapt them to their world by drawing on
oral and dialect sources. Thus their works
are receptive to indigenous myths and the
indigenous imagination, which reach the
contemporary world via the written word.
Life in the New World, as depicted in
Latin American novels, appears fantastic
to readers of other continents, and French
critics have coined the term "magic
realism" to describe this kind of fiction.
The writers themselves seem to prefer the
adjective baroque, which describes more
accurately the social and cultural dispar¬
ities they deal with. Caught hetweecn
Utopia and History, a prey to parody and
dizzying absurdity, the protagonist of the
Latin American novel bears within him a
notion of identity rooted in anguish and
division, where the dream of the Indian
meets, contradicts, opposes or espou¬
ses dream of the immigrant.
AFRICA: NEW FORMS
OF EXPRESSION
Four years later, a meeting held in Harare
(Zimbabwe) from 10 to 13 February 1992
was the occasion for a discussion of similar
themes in African literature: the force of
myth and Nature, a sensibility dominated by
the supernatural, and the problem of vehic¬
ular languages inherited from colonialism.
A Western language, because it is so
widely spoken, gives writers access to the
contemporary world and an opportunity to
reach a wider audience. On the other hand ,
it distances them from the vernacular reader
and still hears the imprint of the colonial
past. As for national languages, they have
proved intractable vehicles for expressing
modern attitudes and remain a prisoner of
the tradition whose myths they perpetuate.
Caught between the two, new African soci¬
eties find themselves deprived of a means of
expression; their literature abounds in fic¬
tional heroes too far removed from reality.
The transition from a culture of oral
tradition to a culture of the written word
has given rise to a number of serious prob¬
lems. But it also bears the seed of a new lit¬
erature in which, once the traces of the
colonial past have been identified, modern
social values can finally be integrated and
expressed.
The discussions constantly returned to
the subject of the writer's commitment and
to committed literature. If writers should
observe and express social conflicts, they
should also be able to communicate the
message of progress without sacrificing the
aesthetic quality of their work.
In their conclusions, the participants
expressed their satisfaction over the place
won for itself by African literature, which
has asserted its own identity, linked espe¬
cially to oral tradition, within English,
French and Portuguese literatures, whose
languages it borrows. Nevertheless, this
young literature has not yet succeeded in
reconciling the ancient values of the con¬
tinent with the intellectual and aesthetic
forms inherited from the West. 43

ASIA: TURNING AWAY
FROM MODERNISM?
For Asian writers, invited to Seoul in 1992,
the central question was that of tradition.
Far removed from the passions and con¬
cerns which had dominated the meetings in
Brasilia and Harare, the participants
emphasized moderation as an aesthetic
and intellectual virtue as well as a political
quality, and regarded originality as being
in bad taste, even a moral flaw, inimical to
the harmony that literature should express.
Only tradition and culture, the commu¬
nity and its values, were considered
capable of responding to the anguish
caused by the questioning of values
imported from the West, in particular the
myth of Progress. If the colonial past con¬
tinues to haunt the mind and the imagina¬
tion, it is only because it constitutes a threat
to national and cultural identities and to
current social trends.
The language problem, which was also
discussed in Brasilia and Harare, is a sin¬
gularly thorny one in Asia, where Anglo-
American is in the process of becoming the
vernacular language. The divorce between
life as they live it and the language in which
they express themselves is causing writers
to experience a personality crisis, which is
aggravated by the multiracial and multi¬
lingual character of many Asian countries.
Here too a solution has been sought
through the restoration of a kind of har¬
mony that is rooted in tradition. The village
and the family, the firm foundations of
individual and collective identity, which
in Asia have never been subject to attack as
they have in the West, remain sacred.
Nature, a metaphor for the harmony
and peace of the soul, continues to be a
favourite theme in Asian literature.
Writers feel particularly concerned by the
dangers that threaten it, and anguish
about the environment sometimes leads
to a return to religion or even, in certain
countries, to fundamentalism. There is a
risk that human rights, towards which the
participants seemed fairly indifferent,
may go by the board. On the other hand
they welcomed the death of ideologies in
the West, because it paves the way for a
return to the self, the family, the village
and tradition.
Little was said about the idea of cre¬
ation during the discussions, which focused
above all on a determination to return to
the Self through separation from the
Other.

44 ALEXANDRE BLOKH
THE CHALLENGES
FACING ARAR
LITERATURE
The Arab writers' symposium held in 1994
in Carthage (Tunisia) was largely devoted
to democracy, freedom of expression and
the fundamentalist threat. The meeting
was overshadowed by the killing of writers
and by death threats against others.
Salman Rushdie and thefatwa against him
were discussed, as were obscurantism and
the fundamentalists' determination to
impose criteria from another age that could
reduce intellectuals to silence. Such is the
pressure of fundamentalism that even the
most independent-minded writers prac¬
tise self-censorship. Great vigilance is
required to avoid a return to an age of
totems and taboos.
This is not just a political problem. It
is a challenge for civilization, as the dec¬
laration signed by the majority of the
twenty writers present emphasizes,
denouncing the catastrophe which might
befall Arab nations if they fail to over¬
come fundamentalist barbarism. The text
specifies that at the time of its splendour,
Islam was tolerant of outsiders and recep¬
tive to them, and did not reject pluralism
or mixing. Only a return to these values
can restore the fertility of Islamic civi¬
lization.
Another question that often came up,
especially among participants from the
Maghrib, was that of the language of
expression chosen by writers. Voices were
raised against those using foreign tongues,
notably French. Tahar ben Jelloun of
Morocco responded by reprimanding "the
watchdogs" of culture who think they have
the right to distribute certificates of "Arab-
ness". His compatriot Mohamed Berrada
and the Tunisian writer Habib Selmi
pointed to the multiplicity of the linguistic
levels which, within the Arabic language,
nourishes their novels.
The question of literary forms and
sources opened a debate on the dialectic
between the particular and the universal.
Palestinian writer Emile Habibi recalled
that different forms of classical narration
could be adapted to modern fiction. Several
participants, including Salah Stétié of
Lebanon, spoke of the role of Sufism as a
source of inspiration for contemporary
writing. Others, however, such as Egyptian
writer Sonallah Ibrahim and Lebanon's
Elias Khoury, felt it was necessary to break
with traditional forms in order to meet the
demands of post-naturalist documentary,
so that literature can fulfil one of its voca¬
tions, which is to be the historical witness
of the crises and changes experienced by
peoples.
The Lebanese poet Adonis perhaps
came closest to indicating a middle way
when he said, "In the past the poet
responded to the demands of princes or
the public. Today I am calling for an inver¬
sion of the relationship: it is I who am
asking the public to accompany me on an
adventure."
Over and above the occasionally symp¬
tomatic reactions of writers from other
regions (including the English writer
Ronald Harwood, President of PEN Inter¬
national, and the Arabic-speaking Israeli
Sami Mikhaïl, reduced to silence), this
meeting showed that Arabic literature finds
itself halfway between withdrawal into the
shell of Arab identity and a movement
towards the freer atmosphere of world lit¬
erature, beyond national expressions.
When all is said and done, if there is a
split, it is between those who cannot bring
themselves to leave their citadel and those
who journey, at their own risk, in joy or in
pain, across the vastnesses of the world.

Paul Scott Mowrer
In last month's
"Archives" column we
reprinted the pessimistic
views expressed by the
Colombian writer
Baldomero Sanín Cano in
his contribution to a study
on the educational role of
the press carried out by the
International Institute of
Intellectual Co-operation in
1933. Published below are
excerptsfrom the
contribution to the same
study made by the
American journalist Paul
Scott Mowrer ofthe Chicago
Daily Neivs.
The press and the public
Text selected by Edgardo Canton
newspaper may at times be lit¬
erary and educative; it may
L.reproduce a lecture or print
admirable articles of an instructive or
entertaining nature; it may publish a
story or even, bit by bit, an entire novel.
But it does not exist primarily for any of
these purposes. A newspaper is not a
speech or a radio talk, for it deals in the
written, not the spoken word, and there
is a vast distinction. A newspaper is not
a magazine. It does not consist primarily
of stories and articles slowly prepared far
in advance and selected carefully at
leisure. A newspaper is not a book. In no
circumstances can it be thought of as
the logical elaborate statement and devel¬
opment, through from beginning to end,
of a plot or a thesis. Those who want to
attend courses of study, or to enjoy lit¬
erature, or to hear eloquence, or to go
thoroughly into some subject, must
attend a school or an assembly hall, must
consult a book or a magazine.
A newspaper is something quite dif¬
ferent. It exists for the purpose of
giving its readers the news of the day
every day. Everything else is sec¬
ondary.
What then is news? It is a more or
less skillful, more or less arbitrary
selection of events snatched hastily
from current life to be reported and
spread before the reader with a min¬
imum of delay.
What governs the selection? Why
must some things be told but not
others? Why are columns devoted to
certain events but only a line or so to
others?
In free countries, the selection of
news is usually a compromise between
what the proprietors of the paper think
should be printed, and what the edi¬
tors of the paper think their readers
would be most interested in. Some
papers are subsidized by special polit¬
ical or economic interests. The pur
pose of such subsidies is to influence
the selection and presentation of news.
But most great newspapers today avoid
subsidies because they wish to remain
independent. They seek to make
profits by selling copies of the paper
and by selling advertising space in the
paper. For both these purposes, the
more readers they have the more pros¬
perous and free they will be. The deter¬
mining factor in the selection of news
is therefore usually, in the long run, the
editors' idea of what will attract the
largest number of readers.
Let us not deceive ourselves. Many
experiments have been made, and it is
now well established that newspapers
devoted mainly to the fair and serious
presentation of political, economic,
scientific and artistic events must be
content to sell few copies. The big cir¬
culations go to the papers which give
only a minimum of space to such news,
and devote their pages primarily to
photographs and brief articles having
to do with crime, sex, sports and
cinema actors, with, by way of inter¬
national interest, frequent chauvin¬
istic attacks on foreign nations.
THE SO-CALLED 'AVERAGE
READER'
This unpleasant fact has given rise to a
good deal of soul-searching on the part
of public-spirited editors. There are of
course a great many people everywhere
who do want to know what is happening
that is significant in the world. The
higher the general standard of educa¬
tion and of independent thinking, the
more there are likely to be of such
people. Must they then be deprived of
serious news merely because the
majority of readers do not appear to
care for it? That seems unreasonable.
Editors have therefore long striven to
find a way out of the dilemma. 45

One popular assumption in news¬
paper circles has been that more
people would be interested in serious
news if it were not so ponderously
written, if it were presented in ways
more vivacious, simpler, more pic¬
turesque, more human. A great deal of
ingenuity and patient effort was thus
expended in the endeavour to interest
by some artifice, as it were, in sub¬
jects like politics and economics, the
numerous people who are not natu¬
rally interested in such subjects. An
abstraction called "the average
reader" was invented. The theory was
advanced, and acted upon, that every¬
thing in the paper should be so pre¬
sented that it would be comprehen¬
sible and interesting to this
hypothetical average.
But of course no such average
person exists. And despite many bril¬
liant examples of popularization, the
attempt to cater to this non-existent
individual must be admitted to have
failed, for the people not interested in
the subject were still not interested,
and those who were really interested
resented the over-simplification, the
distortions and the inadequacy.
THE COMING TREND
OF SPECIALIZATION
A new and far better formula is there¬
fore now gradually developing. Under
this formula it is recognized that there
are many sorts of people, with many
and diverse interests. The aim of a
newspaper seeking a large circulation
should therefore be, not to interest
everybody in everything, but to
supply such a diversity of news every
day that there will inevitably be some¬
thing for everyb-ody. Thus, in the
same newspaper, we may now find
regional, national and foreign news,
news of crime and scandal, news of
sports, of politics, of society, of
finance and economics, news of the
theatre, the arts, the latest books, the
latest scientific discoveries, together
with photographs of beautiful cinema
stars, cheap fiction and strips of
humorous drawings.
The implications of this new for¬
mula are only just beginning to be
understood. It means that the news in
each category can and should be so
selected and presented as to appeal to
the devotees of that particular kind
of news. Sporting news should be
written from the viewpoint and in the
language of sporting people. Crime
news should be written with a dra¬
matic or a detective story touch. And
political news should be written in a
way that will appeal, not to shop-girls
or to bicycle racers, but to people
interested in politics. There are thus
theoretically no limitations upon the
degree of excellence to be sought in
each category.
Practically, however, there is one
insuperable limitation. It is an obvious
one, but it is one which many critics of
the newspapers seem not to take into
account. This limitation is the high
rate of speed at which it is necessary to
gather, prepare and select news in
order to put it before the readers
without delay. This being so, the
wonder is not that mistakes are occa¬
sionally made, but that they are not
made more often. Only highly trained
specialists can work successfully at
this rate of speed, in the gathering,
the preparation and the selection of
news. And this, more and more, is
what the newspapers are demanding:
highly trained specialists in every
department, whether sports, or crime,
or politics.
I do not mean to say that there is no
possibility of improving the newspa¬
pers. On the contrary, under the new
theory of specialization in each cate¬
gory, we have a right to seek and to
expect continuous improvement. The
old incubus of the imaginary average
reader is disappearing. Even an
account of a chess match can now at
last be written honestly for people
interested in chess by a specialist who
knows about chess, and the better he
can make it, the better it will be for the
newspaper. Given a free country with
a high level of education and indepen¬
dent thought, there seems to be no
reason why a public-spirited publisher
cannot produce an honest indepen¬
dent newspaper with enough readers to
make it financially successful and to
enable it to command the services of
competent journalistic specialists.
Such a newspaper, by giving its readers
the news, all sorts of news, in accor¬
dance with the varying interests of the
public, will be fulfilling its true social
function as daily purveyor of current
information. I

A TIMELESS
MOMENT
Isabelle Leymarie
talks to
DEYASMITA
PATNAYIK
Among India's countless forms of tra¬
ditional dance, Bharata Natyam has
experienced a remarkable revival and achieved
International renown In the last fifty years.
The same period has seen the steadily rising
prestige of another very ancient sacred dance
form, known as Odissl, whose home is the
state of Orissa In southern Bengal, tradition¬
ally believed to be ksetra or sacred land.
The golden age of Odissl was In the twelfth
and thirteenth centuries, when It was per¬
formed In the magnificent temples of Shiva at
Bhubaneswar and of Jagannath at Purl and In
the temple of the sun at Konarak. Today
Odlssi still draws inspiration from the sculp¬
tures and friezes that adorn these holy places,
from sacred Inscriptions and from classic
treatises on abhinaya, the art of representa¬
tion. Graceful, expressive and lyrical, ¡ts lan¬
guid fluent gestures are Imbued with nobility.
The origins of Odissi can be traced back
to the second century B.C., the date of carv¬
ings In the grotto of Udayaglrl, near
Bhubaneswar, which show ritual dances with
poses that are still used today. In the fourth
century B.C. a remarkable theoretical treatise
on dance known as the Natya Sastra mentions
a choreographic style known as odhra mag-
adhi, from which contemporary Odlssi ¡s
derived. According to myth, Shiva and his son
Ganesh, the elephant god and lord of the
dance, taught certain poses to Manirambha,
a celestial dancer who transmitted her knowl¬
edge to temple dancers (Devadasl). The devel¬
opment of Odlssi was encouraged in the tenth
century by King Chodagangadeva, the enlight¬
ened ruler who built the temple of Jagannath,

and 300 years later a sacred dance festival was
held at Konarak. During the Mughul Invasions
of India young women stayed In their homes to
protect themselves against the Invaders, and
male dancers who dressed like women and
were known as Gotlpua kept the tradition of
Odlssi alive.
Influenced by Jainism, Tantrism, Buddhism
and Vlshnulsm, Odlssi was danced by temple
dancing girls called Mahari, court dancers
known as Nachuni, and the Gotipua, who per¬
formed In public. Some time around the sev¬
enteenth century the Mahari and Nachuni faded
from the scene, and only the Gotlpua were left.
During the period of British colonial rule
Odlssi gradually shed Its sacred aspect and
became a form of entertainment for the ruling
class. As before the Gotlpua carried on the
tradition, Introducing supple and complex move¬
ments that were In some ways similar to gym¬
nastics. The great practitioners of our times,
Kelu Charan Mahapatra, Deva and Pankaj
Charan Das were once Gotlpua. Since inde¬
pendence In 1946, Odissi has recovered Its
former glory thanks to scholarly research and
the interest of choreographers.
One of Odlssl's most accomplished expo¬
nents, Devasmita Patnaylk, gave a performance
In Paris In 1991 during a series of cultural
events organized as part of UNESCO's Silk
Route Programme. On that occasion we asked
her some questions about her art.
Are there certain basic poses in Odissi?
there are three, the chowka, the four¬
square posture of the god Jagannatha, sym¬
bolizing equilibrium; the tribhanga, a triple body
movement (head, hips and knees), a position
that Is commonly shown In ancient sculpture
and Is absent from other dance styles; and
the abhanga, In which the weight of the body
rests on one foot. Starting with these basic
poses, modifications can be made which use
the whole bodyhands, head, eyes and other
facial muscles.
Are the movements codified?
Odlssi you find the same symbolic gestures
and mudras (hand positions) as In other tradi¬
tional Indian dance-styles. There are nine eye
movements, nine head movements, thirty-six
mudras executed with one handto evoke
clouds, for example, or a forest, a river, a bud,
a peacock and other birds, animals and natural
elementsas well as mudras executed with
both hands. Other gestures signify a window, a
bow, a kiss, candlelight. ... A typical Odlssi
movement consists in backing up on one's
heels then pirouetting on one foot. Combining
these movements and poses offers a wealth of
possibilities. One can also Improvise using this
basic vocabulary. These movements are ben¬
eficial for both body and soul, for dancing com¬
municates energy and encourages fulfilment. It
raises awareness both of oneself and of the
audience, transmits Veda (knowledge), and
unites men and women with the divine.
What is the significance of the costumes you
wearthose wonderful, purple, blue, red and
grey saris, face, foot and hand make-up, and
the headdress with white ornaments?
dance Is an offering, a devotional act
and a search for perfection, the dancer must be
beautiful, especially since she repeats the
poses shown In magnificent ancient sculptures.
The headdress symbolizes jasmin buds, which
were often given as offerings in temples, and
the make-up is governed by certain rules. In
order to make the gestures more visible, the
hands and feet are painted reda colour sym¬
bolizing prosperity. My saris come from Orissa,
and the "fan" (the central pleating) is very typ¬
ical of that part of India. Every item of clothing
has its own significance, and the saris of Orissa
(like Odissi Itself) are coming back Into fashion
all over India. You can even see them on tele¬
vision. The area between Puri and Bhubaneswar
is also well known for its colourful appliquée!
fabric. I wear silver jewellery because silver Is
the only metal worn in Orissa.
Does the dancer follow the music, or, as in
many African dances, does she dictate her
own beat to the musicians?
She has to follow the beat, and since she
wears bells on her feet, she can't afford to go
wrong.
You sometimes do your own choreography.
Does it follow any particular theme?
I have created a dance based on
the nine navarasa (main emotions). The emo¬
tions are love, heroism, sadness (or pathos),
laughter, fear, anger, disgust, wonder and
peace. (The term rasa means "savour, relish,
juice").
Devasmita Patnayikthen demonstrated the
nine navarasa. First of all her feet took root In
the fertile ground before beating the rhythm as
her head and torso thrust heavenwards.
Changing emotions flickered across her mobile
features. Her face puckered in sadness, her
eyes became fiery with anger and then rolled
upwards in disgust. At last her body found
peace, fulfilment and serenity. I watched this
graceful and supple dancer, whose hands drew
skilful arabesques, joined by the magic of move¬
ment In transcendent harmony with the forces
of the universe. I felt the richness of her Inner
world, and left her with the feeling that I too had
participée!, for a moment, in the divine.

rThe future is built on the present,

heart. Whereas compassion and soli¬
darity with suffering humanity seem
more necessary than ever, hearts have all
too often hardened. Selfishness is the
dominant force in today's world. . . .
Individuals, groups and nations must
realize that selfishness breeds misfor¬
tune and death; they must overcome it
and agree to share the wealth of which
they are the trustees. We must all of us
learn to give and to receive, without for¬
getting that the rich too can receive from
the poor.

Not for a long time has the national

that a growing number ofproblems affect

humanity as a whole, acting as one, as a

such problems, reconciling national

1995 UNITED NATIONS YEAR FOR TOLERANCE
Tahar Ben Jelloun An uphill task
"A function of a fervour that has waned, of an imbalance that results not from an excess but from a lack of
energy, tolerance holds no appeal for the young." So says the Romanian-born philosopher Emil Cioran in
"Lettre à un ami lointain" (Letter to a distant friend), the first chapter of his book Histoire et utopie (History
and Utopia). Adolescence is by its very nature a time of extremes. Some young people never grow into adults
but sink into fanaticism and become desperately narrow-minded, their unshakeable beliefs extinguishing in
them the spark of life, the spirit of dissent or quite simply the critical outlook in any shape or form.
It is thus difficult to talk about tolerance to those who live on a diet of wild slogans and inflammatory jibes
and who are always in a hurry; but it would be suicidal for society to say nothing at all about the cardinal virtue
of listening to others and respecting their views, beliefs and customs. Let us therefore teach tolerance, strip¬
ping it of its cloak of self-righteousness and its coats of varnish. Tolerance is a way of living, and it starts in
the primary school.
Overcoming resistance
It has also to be admitted that human nature does not tend of its own accord in this direction. Human beings
would appear to be fundamentally intolerant. The whole of the culture propagated by the civilized countries,
those states where the rule of law prevails, is rooted in the fact that tolerance does not come naturally but has
to be inculcated until it becomes second nature to people, spontaneous, a kind of reflex a difficult task, given
all the resistance and all the temptations to be overcome.
Cioran says that if the prospect of, or the opportunity for, a massacre is held out to them, young people
will follow a leader blindly; such opportunities are constantly being offered to them by fanaticism in its polit¬
ical, ideological or religious manifestations. Suggestibility may take such harmless forms as fashions in dress
or music, fashions that quickly come and go; but the readiness of the young to follow any charlatan and trans¬
late any outlandish idea into action makes it supremely important to get to work on and with them.
To make tolerance people's second nature is a duty that has to be done if the rule of law is to be established
and consolidated. Without tolerance there is no democracy or, to put it another way, democracy and intol¬
erance are irreconcilable opposites. Fanaticism is the fire surreptitiously lit by intolerance in tbe democratic
fabric, it is a fixation, a deceptively pure-seeming obsession, an error that seeks to bring life anything that
moves, changes and holds surprises to a standstill.
To tolerate fanaticism would be to tolerate the intolerable. How can fanaticism be allowed to monopolize
the scene and make it a setting for tragedy? How is it possible to tolerate the enemies of freedom, those who
would destroy intelligence and beauty, whose goal is a totalitarian order that imposes uniformity and proclaims
that might is right, the law of the jungle? Where can one find the patience, courage and composure to refute
this barbarity that prefers the use of the gun to that of the spoken or written word? How can one hold fast to
one's principles, remain strictly respectful of beliefs different from, and even opposed to, one's own, and coexist
with those who would wipe out anything that does not fit in with their crazed way of thinking?
Intolerance is only tolerable in art
Tolerance is an uphill task. It requires courage and strength, a robust aptitude for the cut and thrust of debate,
and an ability to stand up to pressure. Who can claim to possess all these attributes? The answer is a combi¬
nation of soldier and poet, policeman and philosopher, magistrate and artist for all great literature and all
great painting have been the expression of intolerance of the intolerable. The writer's subject is not happi¬
ness, nor is peace that of the artist. Art is a clean break, a rejection, anger, provocation even. When beauty
is laid waste, intelligence done to death, childhood violated and human beings humiliated, art cannot but be
intolerant. It tolerates neither the ugliness of which people arc capable nor the revulsion they arouse.
Fanaticism can be countered with humour; but this is sometimes a risky undertaking, since those who are
fixated upon a certain order of things detest wit, subtlety and of course laughter. What they hold sacred is
dogma, rigid and immutable. It is forbidden to make fun of it, whereas life, being short and beset with pit¬
falls, commends laughter as the best course. Laughter is often provocative, a way of distancing oneself a little
from reality; but distance is something that has been totally banished from the world of intolerant people, who
are so bound up in themselves they would like the rest of humanity to be identical clones of themselves.
Tolerance is something that has to be learned, a requirement that has to be lived with every day, a diffi¬
culty to be faced every moment of every day. It is hard work, but those who are attached to principles rather
than prejudices or compromises do not seek the easy way out. They may not sleep soundly, it is true, but at
least they do not relinquish that which makes us human, our dignity.

r LETTERS TO THE EDITOR
THE WRONG TRACK?
An article by Jean Daniel published in
your December 1994 issue ("Religion and
Politics Today") contains the following
elliptical and to my mind bewildering
statement: "liberalism . . . ended up in
nazism." It seems to me that it was in the
name of liberalism that Great Britain
(where this doctrine was born) led the
fight against Hitler's ideas and practices
and that thousands of American troops
left their own country (where liberal ide¬
ology is not entirely unknown) to rid us of
nazi ideology.
In the same issue Régis Debray makes
a surprising juxtaposition when he derides
"clerics and mafias. . . ." Do the priests
who teach my children about loving their
neighbour and respecting others belong
to a terrible criminal organization? The
same author describes religion as "the vit¬
amin of the weak". This "vitamin" does me
a great deal of good, and my "weakness"
does not prevent me from appreciating the
open-mindedness of the Courier, even
when its writers seem to mc to swerve onto
the wrong track.
Marie Varène
Paris (France)
FAITHLESS BUT NOT FACELESS
One might have expected to sec an atheist's
point of view expressed in your December
1994 issue, if only in general terms. Not so.
The word "atheist" is seldom heard these
days; it disturbs people. Atheists are
regarded as "different", even in the West.
In some countries atheism is punished by
death.
Many thinkers have proclaimed their
lack of religion down the centuries, among
them Democritus, Epicurus, Lucretius,
Victor Hugo, Emile Zola, Bertrand Russell
and Jean Rostand. They too were "dif¬
ferent". Their influence was inimical to
faith and religion.
It is because of cultural progress that
the Catholic Inquisition is unknown in the
modern Western world, whereas religious
terrorism is rampant in other regions.
On the eve of the year 2000 why did you
not take account of the fact that there are
tens of millions of human beings without
faith or 'religion, and that they breathe
the same air as those who believe in divine
providence?
When providing information with an
ideological content, the expression of an
opinion should not exclude the expression
of its antithesis, if only to give readers an
opportunity to make a free choice. That is
the price of credibility.

FUNDAMENTALISM AS A MISGUIDED
FORM OF POLITICAL OPPOSITION
Fundamentalism is not a blueprint for
society deriving from a historical reality,
either recent or remote, nor is it based on
detailed analyses of economic, social or
political conditions. It is a form of protest
against corrupt, mediocre government.
A society becomes an easy prey to
obscurantism because of the greed, the
hunger for power and the irresponsibility
of its leaders, and the bankruptcy and
diversion of politics from its original pur¬
pose the management of state affairs in a
spirit of justice and equality.
It is reckless to claim, today, that fun¬
damentalism is a political movement with
majority support. It is a crime to abandon
millions of people, who have been reduced
to silence by oppressive and divisive polit¬
ical leaders, to executioners and fanatics
who claim they are "saviours of
humanity". How many more crimes will
have to be committed before people cry:
"Stop! We want no more of our history
written in blood"?
Slimane Mehri

SETTING AN EXAMPLE
In his Commentary column in your May
1994 issue, Mr. Federico Mayor writes that
the poor are becoming poorer and the
excluded are being increasingly relegated
to the sidelines of society. I would add that
humanity consists of human beings and
that by relying on their capacity for self-
improvement, through the influence of an
enlightened few, humanity might be able,
if it isn't too late, to rectify this situation.
So many people do not know where to turn
that perhaps the Courier, for example,
could present some examples of individual
behaviour that people might follow.
