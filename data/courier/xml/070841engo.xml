TO OUR NEW READERS
LAST month the Courier announced its new subscription drive to obtain
t 50, 000 additional subscribers. It is as yet too early to judge the
results but already the number of subscriptions received and the
letters accompanying them are most encouraging. The publication
of the Courier depends, as most periodicals do, on the continued support
of its subscribers.
Our latest subscription campaign, ho'wever, has a more profound
purpose : to be able to bring the ideals and goals for which Unesco stands
to an increasingly larger body of readers throughout the world.
Unlike most of our numbers, the present issue is devoted in its
entirety to one subject : the struggle for human rights. It will be read by
large numbers of teachers and education leaders who will be seeing the
COU1"Ïer for the first time. For their benefit, we wish to state briefly the
purpose and nature of our periodical.
The Courier, we believe, is a unique venture in international
journalism sponsored by Unesco. Published in three languages-
English, French and Spanish-it seeks to develop the habit of a global
outlook in readers the world over. The Courier offers a monthly selection
of illustrated feature articles and ne\vs relating to the educational,
cultural and scientific problems and life of peoples throughout the world.
Each month it devotes a section of its issue to an authoritative
treatment of an important world problem and shows how it is being
dealt with practically on both national and international levels in
different regions of the globe. Recent issues have featured themes such
as : The Intellectual Fraud of Racial Doctrines ; Television : A Challenge
and a Chance for Education ; Pushing Back the world's Desert Frontiers ;
Music at School and in Our Everyday Lives ; The Cinema and Inter-
national Understanding ; Books Without Chains (Public Libraries and
Popular Education) ; World Newsprint Famine ; Understanding Other
Peoples in the Geography Class.
If you are interested in people of other nations, and in the events and
problems affecting their daily lives, subscribe to the Unesco Courier.
It is a periodical published for you.

COURIER NOVEMBER 1953. Page 3
THE CHILD IN SCHOOL
AND HUMAN RIGHTS
HISTORY is in part the record of men's struggle to
win recognition of many of those human rights
which are enumerated in the Universal Declaration
adopted by the United Nations in 1948.
At first glance, the Declaration might seem to be the
culmination of the hopes and efforts of all who have
fought the cause of human freedom in one form or
another ; and it is true that all their struggles have
contributed to the creation of the conditions in which
the drafting and acceptance of the Declaration became
possible. But it would be a serious mistake to see in
each instance a conscious movement in favour of the
universal enfranchisement of man, or to represent the
history of human rights as one of steady and unbroken
progress towards that end.
Although, throughout history, people have struggled to
defend or establish certain rights, this does not mean
that they were freely claimed for all men nor that those
who enjoyed them felt themselves under any obligation
to give their leadership or encouragement to other less
fortunate groups. On the contrary, we find that in the
past these rights were often regarded as the privilege
of certain limited sections of the community.
For example, the democracy of Athens observed equa-
lity before the law, equal participation in drama and
games, freedom of speech and many other rights for those
who were citizens, but these privileges were denied to
the greater part of the population. Moreover, Athenian
democracy was to a great extent treated by the Athenians
as something peculiar to themselves, which marked them
off from Sparta, for instance, and above all from the
"Barbarians".
Thus, while the democracy of Athens in the fifth cen-
tury B. C. was perhaps one of the most complete the
world has known, it was also one of the most limited in
scale, for the number of people in Athens with full
privileges of citizenship at this period was probably no
greater than 40, 000 (women, children under 18, resident
foreigners, and slaves did not count as citizens in the
political sense).
In the English Magna Charta of 1215, which is com-
monly regarded as one of the milestones in the struggle
for human rights, we read :"No freeman shall be taken
or imprisoned or dissiezed or outlawed or exiled or in
any way destroyed, nor will we go upon him nor will
we send upon him, except by legal judgment of his
peers or by the law of the land."
IN A. D. 1215 this was a far-reaching restraint on arbi-trary government. Neverthless, we may note with
interest today that the"law of the land"meant feudal
law and that the"freemen"were the English feudal
barons ! who were forcing King John to sign their Charter.
They little thought that before long new classes of men
would be claiming their rights as free men, or that one
day women also would be claiming them as the equals
of men.
So we find that the advancement of many human rights
During the past century, however, the world has grown
suddenly smaller than could have been foreseen two
generations ago. The development of new means of
communication, the spread of industrialization and the
wider flow and accessibility of ideas and information are
among the factors which Ihave made us interdependent
today.
It is not only that no one can ignore the problems of
, others, but also that the very problems which confront
us, and our needs and aspirations, have assumed a close
. similarity. It would seem that this, and our growing
realization that universal peace can be established only
if it is based upon social justice, have made it possible
for our generation to propose a universal declaration of
. human rights.
We know how varied were the ideas and conflicts and
how uneven the progress which led to the making of a
Universal Declaration. Even in modern times, this
progress has been neither smooth nor sure. We need not
go far back in memory to see how close we are still to
the abyss, how easily all gains may be lost if we do not
devote all our energies to the preservation of our rights.
This is one reason why the Universal Declaration pays
particular attention to education, for advances in the
cause of freedom and of social rights as well as their
defence depend very largely on education, just as the
dissemination of the Declaration itself is in a great
measure the teacher's task. It is at school that the hindi.
vidual learns, or fails to learn, to think honestly and with
purpose, to test out the standards of the community in
which he lives, to accept responsibility for his actions, to
assume duties.
Another reason for the Declaration's emphasis on
education, is that education itself is all too likely to
has often taken a strangely
ironic form. Groups within
a society or nation strug-
gled for the recognition of
rights which they conside-
red their own particular
privileges, only to find,
after victory, that they had
prepared the ground for
new groups to demand in
turn these very rights from
them, and ultimately for the
proclamation of these rights
as being common to all
men.
subjects. Foreign language
students have translated
the various Articles and
compared their translations
vsith the official text (obtain-
able from the U. N. Public
Information Department on
request). Civics classes
have made detailed compa-
risons between their nation-
al constitutions and the
Declaration.
The science teacher too
can incorporate human
rights in his teaching. He
be subjected to attack in these times, and the educational
freedoms are particularly vulnerable. Moreover, the De-
claration is concerned with education because the teacher
is also a citizen, and, like other citizens, has rights and
responsibilities which need to be affirmed.
It should also be remembered that the Declaration pro-
claims standards to be achieved, and that they will be
achieved only if education, along with the other organs
of society, accepts and performs its tasks in the common
sense. In the classroom and outside there are many
aspects of school life which coincide with articles in the
Declaration, and this is another demonstration of the fact
that the Declaration is not remote and artificial, but isa reflection, albeit an ideal reflection, of the world in
which we live.
It has often been asked whether every teacher can teach
about human rights or if it is a subject only for the
specialist, the history teacher for instance. The answer is
that human rights concerns all teachers whatever their
subject, and every teacher can contribute even if his share
amounts to little more than ensuring mutual respect in
the classroom. Human rights is as much a matter of
encouraging certain attitudes and habits of behaviour as 1--Ou-&1-... A. 1
Eventually, however, the Declaration is also used so that
the pupils can check the attitudes they expressed with
the international standard. Teachers have found this
approach from the human problem to the appropriate
Article quite effective.
Other teachers, using a different technique, have taken
up some of the broad issues embodied in the Declaration
(such as the principle that the will of the people should
be the basis of government). They introduce each dis-
cussion by recounting an episode from past or present
times which illustrates the topic in a dramatic way. One
episode shows where a particular right has been notably
absent, another how people have struggled to achieve it,
or how it has been gained. Groups of children have even
dramatized one or several of the events.
This method has been found to be a more exciting
introduction to human rights for children than a direct
study of the Articles. Biographies of great figures in the
history of human rights have also been used in much
the same way.
Teaching human rights in special subject courses offers
many rich and varied possibilities without the teacher
neglecting the fixed curriculum. Literature classes have
thus been assigned themes from the Declaration as essay
can explore the scientific bases of the Declaration with
his students. Many questions suggest themselves. Why
may the family be said to be the natural unit of society ?
What justification is there for the anti-racial and ønti.
discriminatory clauses of the Declaration ? (Here, the
special Aug-Sept 1953 issue of the Courier and the series
of Unesco pamphlets on race may prove useful.)
The history class offers the most obvious possibilities
for teaching about human rights. It has therefore been
suggested that a term's or a year's work be based on
human rights in history classes. First, because it is im-
possible fully to appreciate the meaning and importance
of the Declaration without a study of its larger historical
context. Second, because a study of history which does
not give proper emphasis to the human struggles it em-
bodies has not exploited all its possibilities.
At a particular project, history classes could assemblejTi. a set of episodes in world  national history to illus-
trate the story of human rights. After a discussion of one
of the rights under consideration, the class could be divi-
ded into teams of about four pupils each for independent
research. Each episode could then be presented to the
entire class by each team, and the episodes finally com-
piled under a single cover for use by other students.
More advanced pupils could examine the history of
particular rights. It would be an interesting project for
example to study the changing concepts of"the will of
the people" (Article 21) at different times and places.
How have different peoples at different times made their
wishes felt ? What government techniques have been
created (to enable their will to express itself ?
of learning the Articles
themselves.
Thus, general teaching
about human rights ha-
been approached through
discussions of current
events. These have raised
many issues such as free-
dom of movement, the pro.
blem of nationality, equa-
lity of races and sexe,

ing that they were in fact

and character of such edu-

1952 by four international
organizations of teachers :

tion of Secondary Teachers,
the International Federa-
tion of Teachers Associa-
tions, the New Education
Fellowship, and the World
Organization of the Teach-
ing Professions.
These reports, based on
As an alternative approach a class could be asked to
concentrate on the history of human rights in its own
country. But this approach will have value only if the
work is conducted in a critical and dispassionate spirit.
For few countries can lay claim to an unblemished hist.
rical record in human rights ; and no country can claim
that it altogether fulfils the precepts of the Declaration.
The object of teaching about human rights is not to
deal only with the Articles as such, but also to introduce
the principles of the Declaration in such a fashion as to
encourage a constant concern for human rights. Such
an attitude is likely to develop only from discussion
conducted with all the honesty and mutual criticism and
guidance that it requires.
The teacher should do everthing he can to get the
children to investigate their own doubts and queries,
deflecting questions addressed to him back into the class
for further consideration. It is the children themselves
who must learn to pass judgment on events at first hand,
for the Declaration is intended as a standard for everyone
to apply.
Today, teaching about human rights is being carried
on in the schools of many different countries. A group of
extensive s urveys, show that human rights is being
taught not only in the classroom but outside as well,
through extra-curricular activities which link the school
with the neighbourhood and bring children into personal
contact with some of the important community problems.
More important still, many teachers feel, is the extent
to which the spirit and the atmosphere of the school itself
gives children an opportunity to grasp the implications of
the Declaration and carry them out in terms of their own
lives. For it is the life of the school ! Which prohahly
counts for ! most in forming the character which the child
takes with him into society. It is reflected in the whole
nature and tone of the relationships between the children,
and between the headmaster and the staff and the chil-
dren. It is reflected in the extent to which the school
fosters friendliness and cooperation, whether it tends to
perpetuate or correct undesirable social divisions in its
environment, and whether discipline is arbitrary and
over-severe or understandable to the children.
HERE is an interesting outline of how one school inGreat Britain sought to li k up human rights with
the life of the children in school :
Article 3 (security of person) : physical safety rules, fire
drills, etc.
Article 5 (no cruel punishment) : protection from
"bullying".
Articles 7, 8, 9 (justice) : minimum of rules ; no favour-
itism ; appeals against injustice.
Articles 2, 15 (equality of races, right to nationality) :
pupils of various nationalities treated alike ; hospitality
and good manners with foreign visitors ; opportunity for
foreign travel ; friendly relations between staff and boys ;
friendly relations with other schools ; pen pals overseas.
Article 18 (religious liberty) : the"conscience clause"
- the right to withdraw from religious instruction and
act of worship (Jews, Moslems, Roman Catholics, and
sceptics may withdraw at parents'request).
Articles 18, 19 (freedom of expression) : Freedom of
class and discussion groups to speak freely without
censorship, and to write freely in essays and magazines ;
training in public expression.
Articles 20, 21 (freedom of association, freedom to
participate in government) : school clubs and societies ;
prefect system ; election of club and sports leaders.
Articles 22, 25 (social security) ; tutorial system ; grants
to boys of 15+ ; free milk (to all), free meals (to needy) ;
free travel to school (over three miles) ; scholarships and
higher education grants.
Article 24 (rest and leisure) : holidays, breaks, etc.
Article 23 (free choice of employment) : school careers
bureau ; free choice of special studies.
Article 26 (right to education) : no fees or charges for
schooling or participation in any school activity.
Article 27 (cultural participation) : cultural visits
(concerts, theatre, ballet) ; out-of-school cultural activities ;
school assembly ; School Eisteddfod.
It may be said, therefore, that the real measure of the
success of education on human rights is the extent to
which children develop qualities of mind and behaviour
that reflect the principles of the Declaration. These
qualities can be developed by teaching in the classroom,
and by activities outside the class. But above all they
come from the school's purpose, spirit and philosophy.

THEY CHALLENGED
SLAVERY TO FREE
THE march to the African coast was a terrible experience, often lasting three months or
more. The slaves were usually roped or chained together by their necks, their hands
bound behind their backs ; sometimes they were gagged by having a piece of wood like
a snaffle tied into their mouths. If suspected of trying to escape they were shackled
with beams of wood, some of which were as thick as a man's thigh, and six feet long with a
fork at one end in which the neck was. secured by an iron pin. If a halt was called for trading
the gang was «'rdcd together w t'n (hasilly bl/Ill stockade.
IN the history of slavery and its abolition wehave an example of real progress made by
humanity relatively quickly, thanks principally
to the efforts of a few courageous minds, and
despite the opposition of powerful vested interests.
At the beginning of the nineteenth century
slavery was still a basic institution in a number
of great and otherwise highly developed countries.
In 1835 it flourished in the colonies of all the
great European countries, and in North and South
America. Immense economic interests and a

Contratos", 1562.
complete social sys-
tem were based on it.
The supporters of abo-
lition were treated as
dangerous Utopians,
when they were not
prosecuted and punish-
ed as criminals.
Yet within half a
century slavery was
everywhere abolished.
It was founded on
ancient traditions. The
earliest laws of Baby-
lonia recognized that
one man might own
another man, as he
owns an ox or a goat,
and do to him very
much the same as he
does to his ox or goat.
Egypt, Greece, Rome
and practically all the
countries of the ancient Orient practised slavery.
Among the Greeks, Aristotle, one of the greatest
minds of the ancient world, said,'''The lower sort
of mankind are by nature slaves, and it is better
for them, as for all inferiors, that they should
be under the rule of a master."
In early times, men often sold themselves or
members of their family to pay a debt. In Greece
and Rome a debtor could be enslaved by his
creditor, though this was soon forbidden. Slavery
nourished ! in the ancient world principally
because people of one country regarded foreigners
as their inferiors ; (our word barbarian comes
from the Greek barbaros which meant"foreign").
A conquering nation took not only the land and
herds won in war but the inhabitants as well.
Julius Caesar once sold 60, 000 captives.
In most of the ancient communities, gangs of
slaves played the part of machinery in modern
society with men for parts. They erected the
gigantic monuments of the Pharaohs, built the
aqueducts of Rome, were the chained oarsmen of
the galleys of old, and worked under frightful
conditions in Greek and Roman mines and
plantations.
Not all slaves, however, hved lives of horror. In
Athens their conditions were remarkably good ;
they dressed like the other residents and could
aspire to purchase their freedom. The great
French Orientalist, René Grousset has even
remarked that"the slave found himself treated
with more consideration in Athens than was the
free man in most other countries".
In Rome slave labour was used to an extent
never seen before. The hundreds of thousands of
slaves taken in her endless series of wars made
slavery the very foundation of the state. Slaves
were the physicians, teachers, house servants,
farm hands, actors, acrobats-and Gladiators.
Though never given the free movement in Rome
which they enjoyed in Athens, the Roman slaves
could still save money and in the end purchase
their freedom.
From the earliest times there was always protest
among the Greeks and Romans against slavery.
For whatever their conditions, slaves could neither
possess goods nor take part in public life. Their
children belonged to the master who could sell
them at will. The master's good or bad will alone
determined whether a slave was treated kindly
or cruelly. And the master had the right of life
and death over his slave.
In the time of Pericles (5th century B. C.)
Sophocles and Euripedes reminded Athenians
that a slave was a man :"Though the body be
enslaved, the soul is free", said Sophocles. But
few persons advocated slavery's abolition because
they did not see how society could do without it.
Many slave uprisings occurred in the history of
Rome, the most formidable being that headed by
Spartacus in 73 B. C. Escaping from the school
of Gladiators at Capua, he fled to Mount Vesuvius
where he collected an army of 60, 000 runaway
slaves like himself. For two years he fought
army after army sent'against him from Rome.
But the insurrection was finally crushed,
Spartacus was slain and 6, 000 of his followers
were crucified along the Appian Way leading to
Rome.
The messages of the early Christian churches
were so permeated by the principle of equality of
souls that the application of this principle to
slaves occupied an important position in those
messages. Slaves flocked to the new doctrine.
It is noteworthy that during this same period
when the early Christians were concerned with
alleviating the condition of slaves, the Chinese
emperor Kuang-Wu, in the year 35, enacted laws
to protect their fives and safeguard them against
mutilation.
In the scale of Chinese virtues, to give a slave
a violent scolding counted as one fault ; not to
care for him in sickness or to overburden him with
work as 10 faults ; to prevent him from marrying
as 100 faults ; and to refuse to allow him to buy
his freedom as 500 faults.
Although slavery was actively practised for
generations in Islamic countries and isolated
traces of it are still to be found, Mohammet
declared :"He who frees a slave redeems his
entire body from the fire of hell."
In India, owing to the strict social cleavage of
caste, slavery was relatively little practised. In
Japan it was apparently unknown.
Slavery gradually disappeared from Europe
after the 4th century. In its place appeared the
serfdom of feudalism, where the worker was no
more the"chattel"of his master but had to render
his lord a fixed portion of his services. He was
"bound to the soil"and when the land was sold
he and his family went with it. If he fled he
could be brought back unless he hid"for a year
and a day"in some free city. He could not give
his daughter in marriage without permission.
Serfdom ceased in England after the great Peasant
Revolt of 1381 ; in France on the eve of the French
FOUR WHO FOUGHT TO END THE
TRAFFIC IN HUMAN BEINGS
In all countries courageous and humane men and women have fought for the abolition of slavery. The

Revolution ; and in Russia in 1861 when Czar Alex-
ander II liberated 40, 000, 000 serfs.
Slavery revived in the 15th century when Euro-
peans first came into contact with the African
Negroes. The Portuguese introduced the slave
trade in 1444, although their Prince, Henry the
Navigator, who was in advance of his time, quickly
forbade it. Soon after the New World was disco-
vered, the slave ships of Spain, Portugal, England
and other European countries, with their"cargoes
of despair"were a regular sight on the ocean rou-
tes between Africa and the Americas. It is esti-
In 1776 the motion was made in the English
House of Commons that"the slave trade was
contrary to the laws of God and the rights of
men". This motion did not pass but the end was
near. To Denmark belongs the honour of being
the first Western nation to abolish the slave trade
in 1792.
The name of a great Englishman, William Wil-
berforce, stands out in the struggle against slave-
ry. After many efforts, he achieved his object in
1807, when England abolished the trading in sla-
ves throughout the Empire. The example was fol-
AFTER CENTURIES OF
BUFFERING, THERE CAME
THE DAY OF FREEDOM
For centuries they were deprived of all rights. They were put
up for sale in the markets and sold to the highest bidder. They
then became the property of a man who held over them the power
of life and death. Then one day they were set free. Their outburst
of joy and thanksgiving was something the world had rarely seen.
mated that between the 16th and 19th centuries,
thirty-two million Negroes were thus shipped to
the New World.
For one Negro who arrived alive, four died,
either in the manhunts on African soil or during
the crossing. The conditions under which they
travelled, crowded together for weeks on board
ship, beggar description. When the slave-trade
was prohibited their lot grew worse aboard smug-
glers'ships, for they were often thrown into the
sea on the approach of a policing frigate.
As the true nature of this revolting traffic in
human beings came to the knowledge of Euro-
peans it outraged men's sense of justice and free-
dom. One of the great forerunners of abolition
was William Penn, an English Quaker, who after
founding the colony of religious tolerance and
freedom of con. science in Pennsylvania, returned
to England where in 1697 he strongly advocated
the abolition of slavery. He was still too much in
advance of his time but in the following century-
"the century of enlightenment"-many voices
were raised on behalf of abolition.
Thomas Jefferson favoured it and if one more
vote had been obtained when the U. S. Constitu-
tion was drawn up in 1787, slavery would have
been abolished then and there.
Generally speaking, the abolition of slavery in
the modern world was achieved in two stages.
First by forbidding the. slave-trade, and then by
the elimination of slavery itself.
lowed by the United States in 1808 (though slave
smuggling continued until abolition in 1865) by
Holland in 1814, and France in 1815.
It was well enough to stop the traffic in slaves
but slavery itself-"the shame of humanity"-still
continued. In England, Wilberforce spent the lar-
ger part of his life denouncing it over the country
and introducing measures for its abolition. A
number of smaller nations in Europe had already
abolished slavery, and all the abolitionists in Eng-
land redoubled their efforts. Finally in 1838,
three years after Wilberforce's death, complete
emancipation was achieved.
The enthusiasm of humanity associated with
the revolutionary movement, spurred many
Frenchmen in the struggle for abolition. A
"society des Amis des Noirs"was formed in Paris
in 1788. And it was in France, by a decree
passed during the Revolution by the National
Convention in 1794, that slavery was first abo-
lished by a great nation. This measure was
introduced by a deputy, the Abbé Gregoire, who
at the same time had civil and political rights
restored to the Jews. The decree, however, was
not fully carried out. In 1801, Bonaparte re-
established slavery officially in the colonies.
Public opinion, moved by the work of Victor
Schoelcher and others, finally secured complete
abolition in March 1848.
The most stubborn resistance was put up in
North and South America, in the regions where
slavery constituted an essential basis of economic
wealth.
Negroes continued to arrive from Africa,
brought in by well-organized slave-traders, des-
pite the fact that slave trading was forbidden.
It is estimated that at about 1820, 20, 000 Negroes
were arriving annually. Between 1840 and 1860,
New York was the most active port of commission
in the world for this trade ; Bc. ston and Portland
came next. At about 1856, forty slave-ships left
annually from North American ports, and this
"black market"brought in 17 million dollars
profit.
A little more than a hundred years ago, in 1852,
appeared the famous Uncle Tom's Cabin by
Harriet Beecher-Stowe. Translated into many
languages, it rendered signal service to the cause
of abolition. (See Courier, February 1952). It was
only after a long, costly and bloody Civil War
and the ratification of the Thirteenth Amend-
ment to the U. S. Constitution in December 1865,
that the seal was set on the total and definitive
abolition of slavery.
In most Latin American countries, emancipation
came fairly early, the first nation effectively to
liberat the slaves being Equador in 1851. One
country, Brazil, remained the last great strong-
hold of slavery in the New World.
Slavery came to Brazil some 30 years after its
discovery in 1500. It continued uninterrupted
for nearly 300 years assuming its largest propor-
tions in the 18th and 19th centuries. How many
Africans were brought in will perhaps never be
known, but the number undoubtedly ran into
millions.
Many of the Negroes brought to Brazil were
superior in cultural equipment to their masters.
Large numbers were literate and some are said
to have written Arabic fluently. * It is not sur-
prising therefore that the history of Brazilian
slavery records numerous examples of Negroes in
revolt. Fugitive slaves occasionally banded
together in considerable numbers for mutual pro-
tection into quilombos, settlements established
in the jungle.
Perhaps the greatest quilombo was the famous
"Negroes of the Palmares"in Northeast Brazil in
the 17th century. The fugitives, numbering in
the thousands, set up a series of heavily fortified
villages scattered over some 240 miles. They
became so strong and difficult to dislodge that
numerous expeditions sent out by the Dutch and
later the Portuguese were unable for 70 years to
destroy them completely. The quilombo, some-
times called a'"Negro Republic", was finally sub-
dued in 1697 and its leader, a Negro named Zumbi,
slain.
The first recorded protest against slavery in
Brazil was that of the Jesuit Manoel de Nobrega
who wrote to his superiors in Lisbon decrying the
importation of Africans. In 1758 Manoel da
Rocha published a book in Lisbon advocating
abolition of the slave trade. He called for the
freeing of slaves after a certain number of years
of service and the emancipation of their children
at birth.
Sixty-five years later, in 1823, Jose Bonifacio
unsuccessfully proposed in Parliament a measure
to end the importation of slaves. This was
achieved in 1831. Public opinion demanded that
owners set at liberty any slave requesting his
freedom and offering the price of his purchase.
In 1871 the so-called"Law of Rio Branco"freed
children of slaves born after the adoption of the
law.
By 1880 a widespread emancipation movement
was under way."No more slaves ! No more
masters ! Liberty to all hands, liberty to all
heads !" cried Ruy Barbosa the great statesman
and orator, echoing the words of a colonial
author, Gonzaga.
Brazil was no longer a pro-slavery nation ; it
was a country fighting for abolition. In the fore-
front of the battle was Joaquim Nabuco,"the
great and illustrious leader of the abolition mo-
vement."In one of his first parliamentary
speeches he roared :"I see Liberal Deputies, but I
see no liberal ideas."In a Rio de Janeiro news-
paper he wrote :"Slavery is a word which may
have lost all its force for certain consciences, but
like a red-hot iron it marks a sign of degradation
on the foreheads of others."
On the eve of nation-wide abolition, slaves were
being freed by the thousands across the length
and breadth of the country.
In 1888, the Imperial Government at Rio,
through a decree signed by Princess Isabel, abo-
lished slavery entirely, freeing the last 600, 000
Negroes in bondage throughout the country.
The extinction of the institution of slavery in
Brazil thus came about gradually by means of a
progressively increasing and finally irresistible
popular movement.
Thus, the history of slavery and its abolition
in a relatively short space of time shows that an
idea which is apparently Utopian but basically
true can be finally translated into fact when
men who are at once courageous and discerning
will take a hand in public affairs. It is on this
that the authors of the Universal Declaration
of Human Rights based their reasoned hopes.

Regulations regarding work in danger-
ous industries are of comparatively
recent origin, most of them having
been enacted between 1905 and 1911.
THE recognition of the person-
al rights of the worker is
the result of a recent deve-
lopment in our civilization.
Until a very short time ago, no
matter how much suffering or in-
equality was caused by unemploy-
ment, differences in wealth, the
misuse of power, or other circum-
stances, it was generally considered
that each man had to"shift for
himself"to find work, and protect
his interests as best he could.
It was only when faced with the
new economic and social condi-
tions of the nineteenth century that
legislators were forced to acknow-
ledge that, where labour was con-
cerned, the absence of regulations
led to new privileges, fresh oppres-
sion, and an increasing risk of dis-
turbances and violence. The task
of freeing the human person re-
mained unfinished so long as the
fundamental principles formulated
for citizens in general had not been
legally applied to the protection of
the worker as such.
A little over a century ago, the
industrial revolution bore its first
fruits. In the factories of England,
France, Belgium and Germany, in
the mines, and in the workrooms
of the textile industry, working
men, women and children laboured
in ever increasing numbers. And
under what conditions ?
The exploiting of man by man
was at its height, with nothing to
curb or counterbalance it. A few
generous souls were tormented or
revolted by these conditions, but the
rest of the public was scarcely
aware that anything war. wrong. *
From time to time, a novel by
Charles Dickens or a pamphlet
from the pen of some sociologist,
reminded people of the existence
of a proletarian universe. Then
the matter was dropped and for-
gotten.
In French silk factories, workers
laboured as long as 18 hours a day.
In Germany, the Silesian weavers,
oppressed and over-burdened with
taxes by the King of Prussia, tried
to move their master by telling
him of their woes. The king had
them shot down by soldiers.
In the United States in the pri-
vately-owned factories of Massa-
chusetts, men worked 12 to 14
hours a day for ;) dollars a week ;
women and children were paid
less.
Nowhere did the workers have
the slightest remedy against abuses
of power. In Europe, the prole-
tariat had no vote, for lack of the
minimum qualifying income. A
worker was forbidden to form an
association with other workers, on
pain of instant dismissal as well
as severe legal penalties.
Women and children worked
under worse conditions than men,
in dark, unhealthy, airless rooms,
and without any legal redress.
This was in effect a new form of

slavery, introduced at the very time
when the Negroes were being set
free.
The French revolution of 1848
was accompanied by a great wave
of reforms. But the Second
Republic was speedily followed by
the Second Empire, and the
proletarian returned to the inferior
status which, in other countries,
had never ceased to be his.
Both in Europe and America,
however, ideas of reform were
making headway, particularly in
political and intellectual circles.
But the worker's personal condi-
tion changed little, and in some
cases grew worse.
In the small factories of earlier
days, a man could still hope to
count for something and, if only
on a personal score, to make him-
self heard ; in the vast industrial
organizations of the second half
of the nineteenth century, in enor-
mous conglomerations of imported
manpower, in a world of machi-
nery and trusts, what could an'iso-
lated worker do ? Submit to his
fate, emigrate, or die.. There were
no other solutions open to him.
gress was made in almost all coun-
tries. As a result :
A law prescribing a weekly day
of rest was voted in 1904 in Spain,
in 1903 in Belgium and Switzer-
land, in 1906 in France and Cana-
da, and in 1907 in Italy ;
Regulations regarding labour
underground and work in danger-
ous industries were enacted bet-
ween 1905 and 1911 almost every-
where ;
The eight-hour day, long consid-
ered an infringement of the li-
berty of both employers and em-
ployees, was legally imposed in
the United States in 1912 under a
Federal law, and in France, Swit-
zerland, Austria, etc., in 1919 ;
Insurance against accidents
while at work became obligatory
in France in 18J8, in Germany in
won, and in Belgium and Italy in
1903. Sickness and disablement in-
surance was adopted in various
countries between 190D and 1012.
Even in the absence of any inter-
national agreement, the reforms
were more or less simultaneous
throughout the Western world.
fore were made during this period
of twenty years.
Many persons had difficulty in
following this evolutionary pro-
cess ; and there were always in
opposition to it, those inconvenien-
ced or dispossessed by the reforms.
As in the previous case of the civil
emancipation of the individual,
certain people were seized with
panic when confronted with the
worker's economic emancipation,
and made a great outcry, pronounc-
ing it a sacrilege, a disaster and
the end of all things.
The history of contemporary
progress as regards the rights of
the worker is too closely involved
with nations'internal political con-
troversies to allow an entirely
detached presentation of it. But it
can truly be said that the period
19 : 32-W48 has everywhere seen a
new wave of social reforms, based
on the official acceptance of
collective contracts, social insur-
ance, the minimum wage, and
holidays with pay. Such measures
could hardly have been dreamt of
in won.
It was the coincidence of these

At the beginning of the twentieth century labour organizations were exerting a growing pressure on legislators for improved
working conditions. Major reforms appeared in rapid succession and ideas that had once seemed vain hopes were now
accepted as reasonable. But though social reforms have been introduced and the right to just and favourable conditions
of work has been recognized in many countries there are still many millicns of workers to whom this right is denied today.

eighlh centllry, the Chinese intellectl/als 1'011/0'01/alld Li Tai PI'warmty defended the
interest of the Icorliej's, especially the
lJeasants.
By 1900, appreciable progress
had been made and the more scan-
dalous abuses remedied. In all
countries, more or less, there were
laws designed to curb the exploit-
ing of women and children, and
to introduce safety measures into
mines and certain dangerous in-
dustries.
That was about all ; but the way
had been paned, and major reforms
appeared in rapid succession at the
beginning of the twentieth century.
Moreover, labour organizations and
political parties expressing their
demands had become powerful and
efficient, and'were exerting a
growing pressure on the legisla-
tors.
Popularized by sociologists, no-
velists and political parties, ideas
that had once seemed Utopian were
now accepted as reasonable ; and
between 1900 and 1920, before and
after the first world war, rapid pro-
The explanation is not far to seek :
the main argument used by the
opponents of a reform was the
forecasting of the dangerous conse-
quences it might have ; once the
experiment had been made in
some country without any disas-
trous results, the advocates of the
reform used this as a fresh argu-
ment in its favour, and their adver-
saries became disarmed.
International organizations were
not slow to make their appearance.
A non-political association for the
protection of workers was founded
in Berne in ! fIOj. The Internation-
al Office at Basle was instituted
in 1913. Lastly, the Labour Char-

body, the International Labour

The demolishing of the Bastille by the people of Paris in July 1789, still represents for people everywhere the symbol of justice triumphing over arbitrary legal methcds.
FROM ROMAN LAW
TO HUMAN RIGHTS
HUMAN justice, though it will probably neverbe perfect, has made great strides since it
was originally conceived. A study of
ancient laws and customs shows the state of
personal insecurity and social injustice in which
our fathers lived.
Athenian legislation was somewhat summary in
form. Actually, justice was meted out by the
people, who decided on the sentences to be passed.
But far too much was left to the wantonness of
the crowd, to the eloquence of accusers, and to
the arbitrary caprice of witnesses.
The Sophists endeavoured to preach a more
humane justice, and Theophrastus, a disciple of
Plato and Aristotle, laid down various principles
of jurisprudence. However, Greek history
abounds in glaring injustices, like the conviction
of Socrates and the banishment of Aristides
whose fellow-citizens grew weary of hearing him
called"the Just".
The classical period of Roman jurisprudence
was the first century of the Christian era : it is
curious that the works of such jurists as Proculus,
Sabinus and their disciples should have appeared
at a time when Tiberius, Caligula and Nero were
inflicting on Rome the most arbitrary and
scandalous form of tyranny. Yet it was this
period that produced the first idea of the"Right
of the Person", applicable to citizens and non-
citizens alike.
The laws were codified by Theodosius, and then
by Justinian, so that Roman law reached full
flower just when the empire began to disintegrate
under the attacks of the barbarians.
In the sixteenth century, Roman law ex-
perienced a brilliant revival with the humanists,
and remained a source of inspiration for jurists
up to our own day. However, during the Middle
Ages and until the dawn of the present era,
legislation in the great countries of Europe was
mainly a combination of Norse customs, in-
troduced by the barbarian conquerors, and laws
of ecclesiastical origin, designed to ensure, in
social customs, the supremacy of the Church as
well as the authority of the sovereign.
As for legal respect for the human person as
we conceive it today,"without distinction of race.
sex, religion, opinion, social origin or property".
although this idea vaguely occurred to some men
of judgment and to a few reformers, Western
societies provided very little example of it for
eighteen centuries.
Let us take, for example, a few features of
customary, feudal and royal justice as it existed
in France, and, except for a few differences of
detail, in Germany, Spain and Italy under the old
regimes.
In the first place, customary law varied ad in-
finitum, according to the regimes and the temper
of the authorities. The great feudal lords were
accountable only to the king. They had the sole
right of jurisdiction over their vassals, and over
the serfs and villains living on their fiefs. Lesser
nobles, and the ecclesiastical authorities also
possessed the right of justice, from which they
derived handsome benefits in the shape of fines,
confiscations, fees for procedure, etc.
The machinery of the law, and the laws and
penalties themselves, varied according to the class
to which a man appearing before the court
belonged. Nobles brought to law by their peers
could appeal to the sovereign ; a commoner was
judged by a court that allowed of no appeal, serfs
were judged by a minor officer delegated by their
lord and, of course, had no right of appeal.
Trial by ordeal, or the"judgment of God", was
in general use during the Middle Ages ; it might
. take the form of ordeal by water (for accusations
of sorcery), ordeal by fire (which meant picking
up a piece of red-hot metal), ordeal by boiling
oil, or trial by combat (legal duel) ; this latter was
reserved for nobles and free men. The evidence
of witnesses could always be contradicted by the
"judgment of God".
During the thirteenth, fourteenth and fifteenth
centuries, these forms of judgment were con-
demned by the Popes and gradually disappeared,
to be replaced by enquiry and testimony. From
the time of Saint Louis onwards, royal justice
entered into competition with the feudal courts
and then attempted to supplant them.
In criminal matters, only nobles and eccle-
siastics could be summoned before the par-
liaments. Penalties invariably differed according
to the rank of those concerned ; judicial inquiries
were secret ; and the accused, who was presumed
to be guilty, had no advocate. Lastly, the dis-
cretionary power of the sovereign always allowed
him to intervene, arbitrarily and unrestrictedty.
By a"sealed letter" (lettre de cachet), the
sovereign could order the immediate, definitive
imprisonment of anyone, without previous

courts extraordinary, illegal acts,
confiscations and the introduction

judgment. By another order (lettre d'abolition),
he could place a culprit beyond the reach of any
punishment. By a third (lettre de surséance), he
could suspend all proceedings under way. Finally,
the King could at any time remove a case from
Parliament and have it judged by his Council.
Justice, moreover, was extremely slow. Owing
to the superposition of seignorial and royal courts,
it was sometimes necessary to pass through four
jurisdictional bodies prior to appearing before the
parliaments. The expense of litigation was so
great that poor people could never obtain justice.
It was only at the end of Louis XIV's reign that
the official drafting of customary laws was
embarked upon by Chancellor d'Aguesseau. The
Constituent Assembly introduced into the Consti-
tution of 1791 an article ordering the estab-
lishment of a unified code of laws. The present
Civil Code, abrogating both Roman and customary
law, was drawn up under the Consulate.
The Constitution of 1791, based on the first
Declaration of the Rights of Man and the Citizen
(1789), established certain principles that are to
be found in various legislations throughout the
world in the nineteenth century. The Universal
Declaration of 1948, particularly in its first twelve
articles, restates and expands those principles.
Henceforth, no one could be arrested except as
prescribed by law and under specified procedures.
Detention before trial was suppressed where
minor offences and misdemeanours were con-
cerned ; in criminal law, a defendant could be
released provisionally on bail. A defendant was
no longer required to prove his innocence ; it was
the court's task to prove him guilty. The jury
system was introduced, together with the right of
the defendant to choose a lawyer to plead for
him.
In England, the judiciary was centralized
earlier than in the rest of Europe. As early as
the latter part of the twelfth century, the
supremacy of the law and the recognition of in-
dividual liberties gave the country a judicial
system that endures to this day.
The Anglo-Norman feudal nobles never pos-
sessed the right to administer justice. In each
country, royal authority was represented by a
sheriff ; judges travelled from county to county
to preside over local assizes. Common law de-
veloped and was early applied everywhere. En-
quiry and jury systems tended to replace the
"judgment of God"and trial by combat.
The Magna Carta of 1215 contained an article
declaring :"No free man shall be taken, or im-
prisoned, or disseized, or outlawed, or exiled, or
in any way destroyed... except by the legal
judgment of his peers or by the legal law of the
land."There was a retrogression of freedom
during the Wars of the Roses and under the
despotic Tudor and Stuart dynasties. This period

of torture. However Parliament revolted
against royal tyranny. In 1679, the writ
of habeas corpus protected personal
liberty. The Bill of Rights was formally
carried in 1689, after William of Orange
came to the throne.
In the eighteenth century, all arbitrary
acts (that is, all tyrannical and despotic
decisions emanating from absolute power)
disappeared, and every man, irrespective
of his station, was judged according to
law by the ordinary courts.
In other European countries, the eigh-
teenth century princes introduced reforms
inspired by the ideas of the English and
French philosophers.
In the New World, the remote settle-
ments and the isolation of the first
communities, the perilous conditions under
which they were organized, and the bold
and independent character of the original
immigrants made justice for a long time
summary, irregular and often arbitrary.
But with the twentieth century,.'lynch
law"lost all semblance of justification.
In the rest of the world, similar progress
has gradually replaced arbitrary justice by
regular laws, that are equally applied to
all and respect the essential rights of the

Widespread penal preforms have taken place during
and since the 19th century. The aim is now not merely
to punish the criminal, but also to reform and educate
him. Note the contrast between the harsh conditions

person. In the East, the law of absolute
sovereigns has gradually made way for
more equitable and less cruel legal
systems. In China, habeas corpus was in-
corporated in the Constitution on 21 June
1935. In contrast with the brutal and
unjust practices that still subsist in many
parts of the world, we may quote the
following passages from the New Consti-
tution of India which is now in force, and
frees all citizens from the fear of arbitrary
arrest and wrongful interference at the
hands of the State :
"The people of India, solemnly resolved
to constitute India as a sovereign and
democratic Republic, undertake to gua-
rantee to all its citizens ;
"Social, economic and political justice ;
"Freedom of thought, expression.
opinion, faith and worship ;
"Equality before the law and access to
all rights ; it further undertakes to promote
among all men ;
"Fraternity, which ensures the dignity of
the individual and the unity of the
nation."
These words show us how far the
fundamental ideas as to human rights
have progressed throughout the world.
The conquest of the rights of the person
is a modern enterprise, far from complete
and constantly threatened with setbacks.
The progress so far made, however, jus-
tifies the further efforts that are in-
cumbent on the men and nations of today.
CERTAIN articles, the more daring, of the
Universal Declaration of Human
Rights have caused many people to
declare :"But this is Utopian ! Un-
fortunately, the world hasn't reached
that stage !"
True, the world has not yet reached that
stage. But the world is in process of evolution,
and that evolution depends on men. We have
seen slavery, a well-established institution,
disappear from English, French, Russian and
American soil within a quarter of a century
(1835-1865), It may be that, in another twenty-
five years, nothing Utopian will be seen in
Article 25 of the 1948 Declaration :
"Everyone has the right to a standard of living
adequate for the health and well-being of himself
and of his family, including food, clothing,
housing and medical care and necessary social
services, and the right to security in the event
of unemployment, sickness, disability, widowhood,
old age or other lack of livelihood in circumstances
beyond his control."
People will still say :"The world would be
paradise if all these fine ideas were put into
practice ; it's far from being the case in most
countries."But the question should be considered
in relation to what has already been achieved.
It is useless to dwell at length on the rights of
the person in Spartan society. There, the
abandonment and sale of children were common
practices. Disabled slaves were put to death.
And the other Spartan customs were not dis-
similar.
The laws of Athens were less harsh. The poor
benefited from whatever relief was dispensed ; the
people cared for the infirm, and adopted the sons
of citizens who had fallen in battle. Public
doctors visited the poor, and artisans were help-
ed by mutual aid societies. But childhood was
ill-protected.
Rome practised social assistance at an early
stage. Poor citizens were forgiven their debts,
land was distributed,
large families were help-
ed ; food was sold at
reduced prices and even,
under the lex clodia,
distributed free.
Trajan founded a col-
lege for needy children,
and Antoninus one for
poor girls. Medical wel-
fare services functioned
in the cities. Septimius
Severus and Diocletian
forbade fathers to sell their children and, finally,
Justinian's Code declared foundlings to be free,
whereas previously they had been classed as
slaves.
A great contribution to social welfare was made
by Christianity. The Christian emperors of
Byzantium, through the bishops, increased the
number of charitable institutions, like alms-
houses, orphanages, hospitals and homes for the
aged. The laws of the Christian Councils and the
first decretals of the Popes enjoined aid to the
poor and to orphans, the l'ansom of prisoners, and
hospitality to strangers. A quarter of the
Church's revenues should be spent on works of
charity.
In the East, meanwhile, there were many ex-
amples of humanitarian effort. In Persia,
Khosroes Anouchirvara, in the sixth century, gave
money to the poor to allow them to marry ; in
India, King Uposadh was famous for his alms-
giving.
In Christian Europe, charity had a hard task
to alleviate the evils that followed in the wake of
almost continual warfare, famines, epidemics,
brigandage and vagrancy.
Famine was rife in eleventh-century England,
in thirteenth-century Bohemia and, during the
Hundred Years War, in. fourteenth-century
France. Leprosy spread to an alarming degree
during the twelfth century. Lepers were objects
of terror and repulsion, and were excluded from
communities, penned up in lazar-houses and
regarded from the civil point of view, as dead.
It is estimated that twenty-four million people
died of the Black Plague in the fourteenth-
century, a quarter of the population of Europe.
When the power of the throne became more
llrmly established in France, a start was made
with organizing social welfare. Saint Louis, who
personally cared for the lepers, was its forerunner.
By an edict of 1536, supplemented in 1545,
Francis I directed that parishes should feed the
poor and give work to able-bodied men. There

charitable institutions.
In 1551, a register of the poor was instituted in
each parish. Anyone refusing to subscribe alms
could be summoned before a court. On the other
hand, vagrants and beggars incurred the harshest
penalties, which included whipping, the loss of an
ear for a second offence, prison and, for in-
corrigible delinquents, death.
In the reign of Queen Elizabeth, an Act of 1601
permitted the levy of regular taxes on all
landowners in a parish ; it also directed that poor
children be apprenticed to a trade, that able-
bodied persons be put to work, and that all relief
be reserved for the disabled. Workhouses were
introduced in the seventeenth century.
In the eighteenth century, under the influence
of sociological moralists like Hume, Bentham and
Adam Smith, the ideas of"solidarity"and of
"service rendered by work"were the source of new
welfare laws.
An Act of 1796 included, among persons to be
assisted, all workers whose salaries were judged
to be inadequate.
The custom of paying workers an allowance
varying with the price of living gradually became
a recognized obligation.
The novels and articles of Charles Dickens ex-
erted a tremendous influence on public feeling as
regards pauperism and its attendant evils.
On the international plane, few events have
had greater scope and significance than the
signing of the Geneva Convention in 1864. It
gave the war-wounded a legal status recognized
by all belligerents, and resulted in the estab-
lishment in various countries of Red Cross
Societies designed to aid the wounded (even on
the battle-field) and to provide combined
assistance in the event of calamities (foods.
epidemics or earthquakes) whenever local or
national resources seemed likely to be inadequate.
During the last hundred years, numerous laws
have improved the living conditions of the less
equality, solidarity and
the right to relief for
which the Encyclopedists
had paved the way.
In England, through-
out the centuries, the
process was much the
same. Having suppressed
Catholic organizations at
the time of the Re-
formation, the State,
from Henry VIII's time
onwards, took charge of
was a certain improvement in the general
situation during the reign of Henry IV, but with
the Thirty Years War and the Fronde, social evils
including plague and famine, reappeared.
It was then that St. Vincent de Paul <1581-1660)
mobilized the whole of France in the cause or
charity through the enterprises he set on foot,
which reached full fruition after thirty years of
effort. The parochial associations known as
"Confraternities of Charity", which were estab-
lished in the smallest villages, cared for the sick
and gathered in children who had been
abandoned, with the help of the Servants uf tho
Poor" (later called the"Daughters of Charity").
Under the influence of St. Vincent, Louis XIV
took steps to protect childhood and promote
general relief. St. Vincent had established a
home for foundlings ; the edict of 1662 prescribed
the establishment of homes for the poor and
orphaned"in all cities and market towns where
none such yet exist".. In his Instructions to the
Dauphin, Louis XIV stated :
"I will try to arrange things in such a manner,
not indeed that there will be neither rich nor
poor in the kingdom, but at least that want and
beggary disappear. I mean that there will no
longer be anyone, no matter how wretched, who
is not assured of a livelihood, either by work or
by settled and steady aid."This statement is not
so far removed from Article 25 of the 1948
Declaration.
Despite these efforts, however, the eighteenth
century saw a continuation of the scandalous
social inequalities and cruelties which are always
present when a large proportion of the population
languish in misery and want. Hospitals were in-
adequate ; the sick were harshly treated. Save in
Paris, nothing was done for children or disabled
soldiers. Unemployment remained an unsolved
problem.
It was only the 1789 Declaration of the Rights of
Man, and the Constitutions of 1791 and 1793 that
finally and officially proclaimed the notions of

THEY ARE NO LONGER ALONE
favoured classes throughout the world. Hospitals
have been modernized, and social welfare enter-
prises have increased. The world has become
accustomed to the idea that a nation is fully
responsible for the lot of each of its citizens, no
less than to the democratic principle that each
citizen must assume some responsibility in public
affairs.
Contemporary society has gone even farther,
however. It has seen the growth and de-
velopment of the idea of an increasingly inter-
dependent world. It has witnessed the ac-
ceptance by nations of international co-operation
to promote higher standards of living, full
employment and conditions of economic'and
social progress of the peoples of foreign countries
as well.
Nations have become aware that more than
half of humanity lives in poverty, disease and
ignorance. The more prosperous nations have
come to realize that prosperous, progressive
people make better neighbours, better friends and
better customers. They no longer doubt that
economic development and higher living stan-
dards are to their. interest as well as to the
interest of the economically under-developed
countries and of a stable world economy.
The outlook of millions of people is being
transformed from resigned despair to courageous
optimism. For they now know that they can
better their lot-if their resources, their labour
and their skill are put to the best possible use.
The 20th century has seen the growth of
programmes of mutual international aid such as
the American Point IV, the British Colombo Plan,
the Caribbean Commission and the South Pacific
Commission. The United Nations, in co-operation
with its related agencies, today operates the
largest programme ever set up for providing
technical aid through an international orga-
nization.
The U. N. Technical Assistance programme is an
attempt at the interchange of ideas and
techniques which raise living standards. It is an
effort to give freely, without concern for
national boundaries, the vital ideas in science and
ducation upon which modern life depends. It
is entirely a co-operative affair ; it is not only
supported and controlled co-operatively but its
operations within particular countries are also
joint enterprises. And what is not generally
known-there is no assistance from an inter-
national agency without a national contribution
to match it.
By the end of last year, the U. N. and its agencies
had sent over 1, 500 highly-trained specialists to
under-developed countries, and had provided over
2, 700 fellowships to enable selected people in these
countries to continue their studies abroad.
On the next pages we present a few examples
of how, with the aid of the United Nations, the
peoples in one country-the Philippines-are
working to achieve the"adequate standard of
living"proclaimed in the Declaration of Human
Rights.
To help revitalize its craft industries whose output had seriously declined during and after the Second World War,
the Government of the Philippines has opened a number of training centres. Here artisans learn to adapt new tech-
niques to their traditional skills. The United Nations and its Specialized Agencies are co-operating closely in this
effort aimed at improving the country's economy and thereby the standard of living of its people. (See next page).

SOCIAL AWARENESS AND
DUTIES TO COMMUNITY
"Everyone has duties to the community."At
Punta, an industrial suburb of Manila, civic
leaders elaborated a plan to develop social res-
ponsibility in the community. Workers, teachers
and children of the school all took part in a
programme which included a scheme for a new
town plan, a new library, a campaign for town
hygiene and sanitation. Unesco was asked to
send a specialist on community development to
help the community in corrying out the plan.

A PROPER STANDARD
OF LIVING FOR ALL
During the fine ! discussion of the Universal
Declaration before its adoption in 1948,
Mr. Carera Andrade of Ecuador commented that
many of the rights had been the heritage of
mankind for years but others, such as the right
of man to work and the right to a decent
standard of living, had only recently come into
existence. The craft weavers of the Philip-
pines recently found these rights menaced when
machine-made fabrics began flooding local
markets. The Government, with UN aid, set up
a workshop to help the weavers improve their
production and thus safeguard their livelihood.
Here a Philippine girl experiments in weaving a mosquito netting which will open new markets on the islands.
In the past all netting had been imported. Experiments are also made with indigenous fibres. U. N. experts

FRIENDSHIP COMES
FROM SHARED SKILLS
The Preamble to the Universal Declaration
states that"it is essential to promote the deve-
lopment of friendly relations between nations".
The U. N. programme of technical assistance
is a practical application of this principle. In
the Philippines, where timber is an important
natural resource now being developed, local
timbermen have invented special methods in this
industry which the Food and Agriculture Organi-
zation felt could help other countries. The
Philippine Government therefore invited twenty-
one countries to send timber experts to study
Filipino methods as part of a technical assis-
tance exchange of information programme.

OF ALL THE FAMILY
"Everyone has the right to a standard of living
adequate for the health and well-being of him-
self and of his family, including... medical care
and necessary social services..."says Article 25
of the Universal Declaration. The Government
of the Philippines has recently launched a great
programme to extend and strengthen its health
services, It is being aided in this enormous
task by international specialists from the World
Health Organization (WHO) and the United
Nations Children's Emergency Fund (UNICEF).

Philippines decided to create a new source of employment by developing the

RIGHTS ARE NOT
'FOR MEN ONLY'
Women began actively to organized
the fight for their rights at the start of
the 19th century. They progressively
demanded the right to earn their own
living outside the home and of compet-
ing in factories, business, or the
professions on an equal basis with
men. Here is a woman's trade union
member card issued in Scotland in 1833.
THE story of women's rights
is a fascinating one. They
have been subject, through-
out history, to extraordinary
changes of fortune. In some
instances women have been re-
garded as chattels ; in others, they
have been honoured like sove-
reigns, from the mere fact that
they were women. Civil law has
frequently regarded women as
irresponsible ; but there have also
been matriarchies, in which home
and society alike were founded
upon maternal authority.
There have been periods of total
emancipation, and periods of en-
slavement beyond all hope of deli-
verance. Sometimes men have
placed \vomen in a position of
eminence ; at other times, women
have had to win their own rights
at the cost of a long struggle
against the distrust, fear and deri-
sian of their contemporaries.
In Ancient Egypt, woman,
though for a time enslaved to man,
very soon attained complete equa-
lity with him. Girls, when they
came of age, were given the same
rights as men.
A marriage involved a double
contract, in which the rights and
duties of each spouse were clearly
stated ; these were to all intents and
purposes the same for each party.
These contracts show that the right
to personal property existed for
both sexes, and that either spouse
could divorce at will, subject to
payment of fair compensation.
In the working classes, women
seem to have been given the lighter
tasks, such as weaving or the busi-
ness of buying and selling. Men
were responsible for the hard
work. In the country, women and
children shared labour in the fields
with men, on an equal footing.
Although Egyptian civilization
readily recognized the rights of
women, this was not the case with
most of the peoples of antiquity.
In Ancient Greece, especially
with the Boeotians and the Spar-
tans, society long adhered to the
primitive law that regarded women
as veritable beasts of burden. Wo-
men were bought and sold like
cattle, or captured by force. Even
at a later stage, a father long pre-
served the right of marrying his
daughter on'as he chose, without
consulting her wishes ; and he had
the right of life and death over her.
Philosophers disagree
ATHENIAN civilization grew lessharsh, under the influence
of certain philosophers. But
though Xenophon took up the
defence of women, Plato was
shocked to see them become the
equals of their husbands. Aristotle
declared that women were very
inferior, particularly as regards
their reasoning powers."Virtue is
conceded to them ; but it is a virtue
proportioned to their capacities, and
so a lesser virtue than that of men."
We know, from the comedies of
Aristophanes, to what freedom and
self-reliance women had attained
in his century. But it was custom
rather than law that gave them
this freedom.
In Rome, the legal status of wo-
men varied with the times. At an
early period, they lived in a state
of utter subjection to father or
husband. Except for the priest-
esses, who were granted certain
privileges, women were excluded
from any intellectual life. Cicero,
Tacitus and Cato denied that they
had any capacity for judgment.
At the most, they were consulted
about the choice of a husband ; but
divorce, by mutual consent, was
permitted.
Finally, Seneca and the Stoics in
the first century of the Christian
era, affirmed the equality of the
sexes, though stating that women
were less fitted than men for the
study of philosophy. A system of
co-education was adopted, in the
upper classes, so that a master
could teach a brother and a sister
at the same time.
This accession to intellectual life
enabled women to take a greater
part in the propagation of
Christianity. But women were
not emancipated either in private
or in public law.
The great Renaissance, which
began as early as the twelfth cen-
tury in Mediterranean countries,
was accompanied by a great ad-
vance in women's emancipation.
Chivalry honoured women as a
source of fine feeling. Thus la-
dies, princesses and middle-class
women took a distinguished part
in the social and cultural life of
this period. In Italy more partic-
ularly, in Provence and in Lan-
guedoc, women spoke Latin, wrote
verse, and encourage arts and let-
terms. Certain women even taught
in universities.
The fourteenth century provides
many examples of women of dis-
tinguished mind ; the court of
Queen Joan of Naples was one of
the most brilliant of the period, and
Christine de Pisan, daughter to
Charles V of France's physician-
astrologer, must have been stirred
by the condition of women in her
time, for apart from poems and
tales she wrote The City of Ladies,
a discourse on women's education.
She maintained that the social in-
equality of the sexes was not dictat-
ed by nature :"If it were the
custom to put girls to school and
teach them as boys are taught,
women would understand the sub-
tleties of art and science as well
as men do."It took a few cent-
uries to fulfil this prophecy.
Famous women in the sixteenth
century included Margaret de Na-
The active campaigns for universal suffrage in the 19th century have led to many victories in the 20th. The winning of
suffrage has given women a voice in making the laws which control their own well-being and that of their homes and chil-
dren. ! n 1911 when Danish women gained the right to vote, they acknowledged it in a warm isplay of loyalty to the King.
varre, sister of Francis I : margaret
de Valois, the wife of Henry IV ;
and Miss de Gournay, who was
Montaigne's adopted daughter and
wrote a treatise on the equality of
men and women. So much for
France. In Italy, Angela di Bres-
cia founded the Ursuline order
(1337). In Great Britain, we have
Queen Elizabeth of England and
Mary, Queen of Scots.
Two independent and unpreju-
diced minds of the sixteenth cen-
tury, the great Erasmus and Cor-
nelius Agrippa, championed the
education of women and their
access to professions then closed
to them.
No legal status
IN the following century, inFrance at the time of the
Fronde, some great ladies
played an active part in politics,
while others greatly influenced lite-
rature. It was not long before
the question of women's right to
education, and of their civil rights,
which had been left to custom and
the good pleasure of parents, arose
in a compelling form.
In ancient French and English
law, an unmarried woman or a
widow could go to law, enter into
a contract, or make a will in the
same way as a man. But with
marriage a woman lost all legal
status from this point of view.
In England, Mary Astell (1668-
1731) was the author of two works
demanding the equality of the
sexes in family and social life.
Later, Elizabeth Montagu and
Hannah More, through their
writings and their influence,
continued the struggle for women's
rights. Mary Wollstonecraft was
also devoted to the same cause ;
her Vindication of the Rights of
"IV omen (17 ! J2) claimed economic
rights for women-a prerequisite
of social and political equality-
particularly as regards the labour-
ing classes. This work was de-
dicated to Talleyrand, who had
recommended equal education for
both sexes.
France of the eighteenth century
had made little progress in these
matters from the legal point of
view, but shortly before the Revo-
lution there was a great advance
in outlook particularly among the
bourgeoisie
Sadly prophetic
WHEN the States General wereconvoked in France in 1789,
women presented petitions
for their cause. A pamphlet
demanded that they become eligible
for membership of the Assembly.
Dressmakers, embroideresses and
modistes called for the protection
of their professions,"not to usurp
men's authority, but to be more
highly considered, and to be shel-
tered from adversity".
The women's movement was led
by Olympe de Gouges, who pub-
lished an eloquent Declaration of
the Rights of Woman :
"Woman is born free and equal
to man in rights. The principle of
all sovereignty resides entirely in
the nation, which is'but the asso-
ciation of men and women... The
law must be the same for all... A
woman has the right to mount the
scaffold ; she should also have the
riglit to mount the tribune."This last sentence proved sadly
prophetic, for Olympe de Gouges
was guillotined in 1793, for having
opposed the principles of the
Terror.
After lively controversies during
the nineteenth century the women's

IN EVERY FIELD OF
HUMAN ACTIVITIES
Though most countries have recognized the principle of equal rights for both sexes, women are still
subject to some inequalities and anomalies in their work and everyday lives. But wherever the oppor-
tunity has been given to them, they have more than proved their capacity to meet responsibilities of
citizenship and of professional and vocational life, whether as nurses, teachers, telephonists or artists.
movement continued to expand
under the Third Republic. In 1880,
a few militants demanded the
registration of women as voters.
No positive results were secured
by the end of the century, but
women had succeeded in entering
various liberal professions (the bar,
medicine, etc.).
In England, however, the wo-
men's movement developed on a
large scale, with John Stuart Mill
as its most distinguished cham-
pion. He wrote :"The subordina-
tion of women stands out as an
isolated fact in the midst of
modern institutions... It is a relic
of an ancient intellectual and
moral world, destroyed everywhere,
yet preserved in a single aspect."
In the House of Commons, when
the electoral (reform) bill of 18t
was discussed, he proposed the
substitution of the word"person"
for"man" (as has been done, by
the way, in the Universal Declara-
tion of i !) 48). His motion was
defeated by 106 votes to 86. The
women's movement pointed out
that, several centuries before,
women had had the right of
suffrage, and that no legal act
had been passed to deprive them
of it. Many women thereupon
. entered themselves on the electoral
lists, but the authorities struck
their names off. However, the
movement grew and enfranchise-
inent 1'0)'locul cledions was finally
obtained.,
In most countries political rights
were finally conceded to women
in the twentieth century.
In England, the"suffragette"
movement was vigorously con-
ducted by ChristabeJ Pankhurst
and Annie Kenney. These two
women unflinchingly used the
most riotous forms of publicity-
public demonstrations, tumultuous
meetings, etc.
Hunger-strikers
WOlIIEN'S eligibility for muni-cipal office was sec red
in 1907, but this merely
stimulated the emancipationists to
further efforts. Windows were
broken, letter-boxes were des-
troyed, and the Prime Minister
was insulted in the House of
Commons by suffragettes who had
managed to enter in disguise.
When the militants were put in
prison, they promptly went on
hunger-strike.
'When the first World War broke
out in lûi4 they declared a truce
and went into war service. The
partisans of, women's suffrage
continued to increase ; shortly be-
fore the end of the war, in 1918,
the Representation of the People
Act was carried, giving voting
rights to women over thirty years
of age. This Act was completed,
ml". 28, by it measures that. culiflpd
women to vote at the same age as
men.
In France, between 1897 and
1927, married women obtained the
right to retain their nationality,
to dispose of their salaries, to go to
law, and to be guardians. They
also secured the right to higher
education.
The Constitution of the Fourth
Republic gave women the same
political and civil rights as men, as
is now the case in most countries.
In the United States, women had,
shortly before the end of the 1914-
1918 war, secured the right to vote,
by virtue of an amendment to the
Constitution.
In the political field, the greatest
progress in the fight for women's
rights has been made since the end
of Worid War I. Before 1914 only
four countries-Australia, Fin-
land, New Zealand and Norway--
accorded voting rights to women.
By 1918, the number had increased
to 13, though in some cases rights
were restricted. Between 1917 and
1ü45, however, a further 34 States
gave women the right to vote, and
in the first four years after World
War II, women in 12 other coun-
tries finally enjoyed this right.
Yet by 1949, in only 52 of these
59 States did women have full
voting rights with men and in a
number of other countries the right
is still withheld. Since 104C the
United Nations has been working
to end such discrimination. One
country which recently (November
6, 1952) accorded voting rights to
women is the Lebanon. Here,
women form the majority of the
voting population-395, 000 com-
paned with 38 ;), 000 men of voting
age.
During the past fifty years
women have played an increasing
part in the professions, in industry
and in public affairs. In many
countries they hold public office as
cabinet ministers and some arc
serving their countries as ambassa-
dors. Recently an Indian woman
diplomat, Mrs. Vijaya Lakshmi
Pandit, sister of Prime Minister
Nehru of India, was elected Pre-
sident of the United Nations Ge-
neral Assembly.
Though women have proved
their capacity to meet all the res-
ponsibilities of citizenship and of
professional and vocational life
they are still subject to many in-
equalities and anomalies. Discrimi-
nation regarding employment and
education are two examples. The
United Nations is working to bring
about a wider application of the
principle of"equal pay for equal
work"and, in co-operation with
Unesco, to ensure that women are
accorded equal educational oppor-
tunities with men.

THE RIGHT TO DIFFER
UNESCO
"The happiness of the
times was e : tlraordinary.
because it icas lawful to
think tL'hat you wished,
and to say tL'hat you
thought".
so wrote the Roman historianTacitus in the first century 01
the Christian era when he set
down his account of life under one
of the nine Roman emperors
through whose reigns he lived.
Tacitus was fortunate to be able to
record such a state of affairs, for
in the eighteen centuries which
have passed since he wrote h ; s
Histories, freedom of thought and
expression has been the exceptio II
rather than the rule.
Even today there are few places
in the world where the diffusion of
ideas is not restricted in one way
or another. In the 1948 Declaration
of Human Rights the Article
regarded as the most daring-some
people refer to it as Utopian-is
Article 19 which states that the
right to freedom of opinion and
expression includes"freedom to
seek, receive and impart in-
formation and ideas through any
media and regardless of frontiers".
Now the right to impart an idea
is quite different from mere
freedom of thought. Although the
theocratic and absolutist regimes
have been the only ones to pursue
heresy and insubordination into the
very conscience of men, most
authorities, even liberal and de-
mocratic ones, have appointed
limits to the right to propagate
ideas that every man can hold as
his private view. These limits
have often been somewhat strict in
the case of political and social
ideas that are considered sub-
versive either by governments or
by majority opinion.
At what point does an individual
ceasP to have the right to say
everything, to spread his opinions,
hroadcast and to criticize every-
thing ? At what point do the
authorities begin to have the right
of defending themselves against
attack or of protecting existing
societies from destruction ?
We can only note that in the
course of history, and particularly
for the last two hundred years,
constant progress has made the
propagation of ever more daring
ideas possible ; that cruel, corrupt
and unhealthy regimes are vul-
nerable to such freedom of ex-
pression ; but that regimes founded
on the free consent of individuals
draw strength from it. At all
periods, the progress of civilization
has been retarded by lack of
freedom in the dissemination of
ideas and opinions. An idea
cannot be killed by censorship or
prohibition, but its advance can
long be delayed.
The invention of printing in the
fifteenth century placed a formi-
dable'weapon in the hands of
innovators and reformers, whose
resources increased with the spread
of pamphlets and, later, perio-
dicals. Little brochures like those
printed in the United Provinces of
Holland were the best, and the most
feared by absolute monarchs.
The propaganda"war"waged
between Louis XIV and the Dutch
gazetteers is an amusing instance
of this. The Dutch, feeling that
their independence vas threatened,
encouraged these gazettes. Louis
XIV, powerless to stop their
circulation, remonstrated with the
Dutch authorities. The latter pro-
mised to take severe measures
against the gazettes, but did
nothing'whatever. Louis XIV then
paid gazetteers to attack and abuse
the Government of the United
Provinces, and thus a sort of
compromise was effected. But it
remained the custom to stamp
"Printed in Amsterdam"on most
of the clandestine books in France,
especially those written by philo-
sophers.
At the time of the American War
of Independence, the vritings of
Tom Paine, The Crisis and Common
Sense, recruited many a soldier for
George Washington's armies. In
Paris, from 1789 to the time of the
Directoire, people devoured po-
litical newspapers, but freedom of
opinion was under a cloud during
the Consulate and Empire, owing
to the severity of Napoleon's police.
The struggle was renewed under
the Restoration, and'public feeling
was so strong on the side of
freedom of opinion that the seizing
and destroying of the Temps and
the National newspapers'printing
presses was the signal for the 1830
revolution, which put an end to the
Bourbon dynasty. Under Napo-
leon III, newspapers expressing
political opinions kept alive the
republican faith and since 1R71,
freedom of opinion has remained
a tradition in the French press.
On the other hand, French
tradition is less tolerant than that
of England and America as regards
open-air meetings in streets and
parks, and the right of every man
to give vent to his viewvs in
public places. In this matter, each
country has its own customs and
characteristics. But there are few
nations, if any, where the diffusion
of all ideas by every available
means is permitted withrmt re-
striction.
There is no doubt that, in certain
parts of the world, freedom of in-
formation is in retrogression. On
the other hand it is noteworthy that.
the new Republic of India has,
through its Constituent Assembly,
proclaimed the right to freedom of
speech and expression for all its
citizens.
When it comes to be generally
admitted that if. is I1 sign of
strength in authorities to grant all
citizens a wide measure of freedom
of discussion, and that to suppress
that freedom is a sign of fear and
therefore of weakness, Article 19
of the 1948 Declaration will readily
find its place in national legal
systems.
At present, however, the various
authorities, and even certain sec-
tions of public opinion, are not
ready to give this sign of strength.
They still believe in suppressing
opposition, which means that they
fear ! bait free discussion would be
fatal to their own ideas. They sin
from a great lack of faith, perhaps
because they have never seriously
taken stock of their own ideas.
He who holds strong opinions
and feels he can make them
prevail seeks free discussion and
does not retreat from it. He who
needs freedom in order to impart
ideas which he feels to be right
does not fear the freedom of others.
These principles are equally
applicable to freedom of religion.
From time immemorial, men con-
vinced that they possess the truth
have thought it their duty to im-
pose it, by law or force, on other
men whose idea of the truth was
different, and those who serve one
god have called those who serve
another god,"infidels".
It was often easy, in days gone
by, to convert a whole nation to the
religion of its ruler ; but it has
always been difficult to make men
of one belief live peacefully side
by side with men of another.
Nevertheless, tolerance was
widely practised in ancient times
especially in the Far East. An-
cient Chinese philosophy, for ins-
tance, was based on a doctrine
known as"non-injury'., or"non-
interference". that is, non-inter-
ference'. vith the rights and lives of
others. In seventh century Japan,
Prince Shotoku promulgated il
system of laws that were dis-
llCnguished by their humanity and

tolerance. Buddhism teaches re-
spect for the beliefs of others.
Hinduism, as llahatma Gandhi
explained, is not an exclusive
religion. It tells everyone to
worship God according to his own
faith or dharma, and so it lives in
peace with all the religions.
Jewish doctrine, taken from the
laws of Israel, forbids hatred :
"Thou shalt not hate thv brother in
thy heart"'""thou shalt love thy
neighbour as thyself"..."thou shalt
love a stranger as thyself..."
Similarly, we have the example of
Christian doctrines :"Thou shalt
love thy neighbour as thyself"and,
In the first epistle of St. John :"He
that loveth not his brother whom
he hath seen, how can he love God
whom he hath not seen ?"
Like the Old and New Tes-
taments, the Koran exhorts Mos-
lems to respect Christian beliefs.
A striking example of this to-
lerance was the scrupulous respect
for freedom of worship practised
by the Moors when they conquered
Spain at the beginning of the
present millenary, at a time when
culturally and politically the power
of the Arab world was greatest.
Furthermore, this tolerance of-
fered an example to the Christian
world which had not always paid
attention to the exhortation of
Tertullian, a Doctor of the Church
who lived from 160 to 240 A. n.
allow one man to adore the true
God", he said,"another man to
adore Jupiter ; allow one man to
raise his arms to heaven, and
another to stretch his toward the
altar of faith... Beware that it be
not a kind of irreligion to take
away freedom of religion and the
option of God, and not to allow me
to adore the God I wish to adore..."
Examples of tolerance, however,
are not lacking in the Western
world despite the persecutions and
massacres that sometimes took
place in the very name, and for the
greater glory, of the God who
preached love and forgiveness.
In France, after the Wars of
Religion, Henry IV pacified his
country by the celebrated Edict of
Nantes, of 1598 ; it \vas later
revoked by the narrow despotism
of Louis XIV. King Sigismund of
Transylvania allowed four re-
ligions to be freely practised in his
kingdom. Poland at first conceded
religious freedom both to Pro-
testants and to the Greek Orthodox
Church. The United Provinces
(the Netherlands) recognized free-
dom of conscience as early as the
seventeenth century.
In contrast to these examples is
that of the Inquisition which dealt
sewre[y with'the Bog-ami ! : : ; in
Bosnia and with the \YaldensE'S in
Piedmont ; and which, in Bohemia,
sentenced John Buss to the stake.
In France, the Inquisition was
suppressed in 1 :") 00, but in Spain
it came to an end only in 18U (i.
It was to the eighteenth century
that fell the honour of fighting
religious intolerance unremittingly
and defeating it almost every-
where, at least legally.
The writings of : \IontesquiE'u and
of YoItaiJ'e, and those of the
Encyclopedists, influenced the
spirit of the times and the minds
of liberal European monarchs.
The Emperor Joseph II, Fre-
derick II of Prussia and Catherine
the Great of Russia recognized or
extended freedom of worship. In
England, the right to teach was
conceded to Catholics in 1ì ! H. The
United States was the first country
to make freedom of conscience a
fundamental law. According to
the Constitution of 1789, public
o1Iices could be filled by persons of
all creeds. An amendment in-
troduced in 1791 prescribed that
Congress coup not establish a
State religion, or forbid the free
exercise of any religion.
In France, freedom of worship
was instituted in 1795. Bonaparte

settled the relations between the
Catholic Church and the State hv
the Concol'dat of 1801, which
remained in force until the
complete separation of Church and
State in if)') 2. The Protestant and
Jewish religions benefited from
the terms of the Concordat, which
tstablished unrestricted ff (pdom or
conscience throughout alt French
territories.
Other concordats were conclude
between Pope Pius IX and Austria
Spain, and the main States Of
Germanv and South America. Re-
ligious persecution, property so
called, had disappeared from the
Western world. It reappeared, in
an aggravated form, under to-
talilarian regimes, that nightmal'e
of modern times.
We should not forget, how-eve)',
that if the spirit of persecution is
declining in the matter of religious
beliefs it has never been more
aggressive in the political and the
social sphere. The old intolerance
characteristic of religious fanatics
has reappeared in disturbing
fashion in regard to persons who
do not conform to prevailing po-
litical doctrines. In various plar'ps'"
in this respect the final conquest of
the rights of the human person in
our world of today is far from
having been achieved.
FOREIGN TRAVEL : A MODERN OBSTACLE RACE
A few years ago, the late Mr. ErnestBevin, speaking as Great Britain's Mi-
nister of Foreign Affairs, said he
wished that he and other British people who
felt like going abroad could do so without
having to worry about anything else but the
purchase of a rail, air or steamer ticket.
These are the sentiments of people in every
country in the world today for whom the
simple act of crossing a frontier involves
the filling in of innumerable application forms
for passports, visas and currency allowances.
"Everyone has the right to freedom of
movement and residence within the borders of
each State."-'''Everyone has the right to
leave any country, including his own, and to
return to his country."
So states Article 13 of the Universal Decla-
ration of Human Rights. While this article is
readily acknowledged in theory, it is far from
being put into practice everywhere. And even
in areas where freedom of movement is
accorded there are inevitable obstacles in the
shape of forms and formalities.
It can certainly be said that in the twentieth
century, freedom of movement has suffered a
setback despite the tremendous improvement
and development of means of transport bet-
ween one part of the world and another.
This is obvious when we look back on the
historical sequence of events that has led to
this paradoxical situation.
Primitive communities generally regarded a
stranger as an enemy, or at least as a suspect.
However, as soon as men began to trade and
barter, the advantage of allowing travellers
freedom of movement was recognized.
Pioneer travellers
THROUGHOUT the Middle Ages, thegreat routes followed by the merchants
were channels of prosperity, carrying
fruitful knowledge from country to country,
from continent to continent. To take one
example, the travels of Marco Polo, the Vene-
tian, at the end of the thirteenth century had
an immense effect on life in the Western
world.
In the fifteenth and eighteenth centuries,
the Portuguese and Dutch, who were great
traders and navigators, stood in the forefront
as pioneers of international freedom of mo-
vement. Pilgrims, too, played a great part in
developing international relations. Jerusalem,
Senores and Mecca attracted the faithful by
hundreds of thousands, and on the roads
leading to them there were countless inns and
chapels, so many meeting-places where goods
and ideas were exchanged between travellers
from all lands.
In Europe, feudal particularism tended to
box communications, or at least to hamper
them, through tolls and other taxes. On the
other hand, the Crusades created many
contacts with the Near East, the Byzantine
Empire and the Moslem countries, most of
which possessed a high degree of civilization.
As trade increased, the exporting countries
were more ready to welcome strangers. In
the fourteenth century, Ghent, Brussels, Ant-
werp and Louvain were open to all.
The great discoveries in the fifteenth and
sixteenth centuries led to large-scale emi-
gration to the New World ; some emigrants
left Europe to escape religious or political
persecution. These constituted an é/ite, whose
love of freedom left its mark on the new
countries'institutions.
In the fields of culture, man's freedom of
movement produced especially beneficial
effects. When Irish monks journeyed to Italy,
when Albertus Magnus and Saint Thomas
Aquinas taught in Paris, Erasmus in Oxford
and Copernicus in Bologna, when students of
all countries flocked to the great universities
of Salamanca, Coimbra, Montpellier, Toulouse,
Cambridge and Heidelberg, it is hard to say
which derived the greater benefit from these
sojourns, the traveller or the place itself.
No passport needed
VARIOUS factors, of course, combined to
curtail freedom of movement : Travel
by road was anything but safe ; and the
pirates who infested the seas often made jour-
neying positively dangerous. Unquestion-
ably, however, the eighteenth and nineteenth
centuries saw a great increase in travelling
facilities. Unpoliced areas grew smaller, and
the rapidity of transport increased by leaps
and bounds. The Atlantic, which in former
times had often taken several months to cross,
was usually crossed in under three weeks by
the large sailing vessels of 1850, and by the
steamships of 1900 in a week. Where a
coach had taken two weeks to cross a big
European country, the railway train took
twenty hours. Continents that had hitherto
been pronounced"impenetrable"were opened
to explorers, colonists, traders and promoters
of industry.
It would seem that the first fourteen years
of the twentieth century marked the apex of
man's freedom of movement on earth. Not
only were time, cost and insecurity then
reduced to a minimum, but the obstacles
placed in the way of travellers by States had
almost entirely vanished. In 1913 one could
travel without a passport in all Europe, with
the exception of Russia and Turkey. What is
more, currencies were easily exchanged, and
even tended to become standardized.
But after the 1914-1918 war, human
obstacles two freedom of movement increased ;
passports, formalities and restrictions reap-
peared. The New World was partially closed
to immigrants. After the 1939-1945 war diffi-
culties became general, and were added to by
financial regulations. Today, despite marked
improvements in aircraft and automobiles, the
de ! ightfu) freedom of movement of 1913 is no
more than a memory.
A brooding fear
Not only in entering various countries,
but in leaving them, the traveller comes
up against regulations that everyone
deems excessive, but that nevertheless exist.
In most cases they are direct or indirect evi-
dence of the fear that broods over men and
nations in regard to one another.
Freedom of movement is a perfect example
of a principle that men are at one in pro-
claiming but render invalid in practice. Only
international agreement based on firm, clear-
cut undertakings, will suffice to remove, for
the benefit of the majority, the present obsta-
cles which profit scarcely anyone. When Arti-
cle 13 of the Universal Declaration has
assumed the force of a general obligation, it
will allow hurnanity once more to resume pro-
gress in a form that is essential to its well-
being, and individuals will again enjoy the
exercise of a natural right : freedom of move.
ment and residence for each and for all.

ONE of the greatest para-
doxes of the twentieth
century is that in an age
of aviation, radio and
nuclear physics, the people
in the world who cannot
read or write outnumber those who
can. Although in some places the
percentage of illiteracy is slight,
there are also vast areas where men
and women are mostly incapable of
reading the instructions they receive
or of signing their name to an agree-
ment, and yet the right of every
human being to education is, of all
the rights affirmed by the United
Nations Declaration of 1948, one of
the least contested.
Article 26, which deals with the
right to education, was adopted una-
nimously with two abstentions. The
terms of the article are couched in
no uncertain language, although na-
tions and families are given all rea-
sonable freedom in interpreting it :
elementary education must be free
and compulsory, technical and pro-
fessional education must be made
generarlly available, and higher
education must be equally access. ible
to all, on the basis of merit.
This is the culmination of a cen-
tury and a half of effort made in
almost all countries with a view to
a truly democratic distribution of
education. A hundred years ago, not
only did the immense majority of
human beings not know how to read
or write, even in the Western world,
but the idea of making education
accessible to all appeared, to many,
to be dangerously Utopian. Yet
today such ideas have triumphed
throughout the world.
The principle is now admitted, but
in many countries it is not applied.
There are countries where education
cannot be made accessible to all, for
lack of resources. There are those
again, where such a state of things
is not really desired, because certain
elements doggedly resist it, e. g.,
governments that are not in too
great a hurry to turn their subjects
into citizens capable of understand-
ing and criticizing the conduct of
public affairs.
Some people have been surprised
to find the word"compulsory"in an
article that deals only with"rights".
But to each right corresponds the
obligation of others to respect that
right. The right of children and
students is inseparable here from
the obligations of parents and the
State, whose responsibilities, in this
respect, are joint. There are other
rights, that those who hold them
can make prevail through the vote,
the power to act collectively, and so
forth. Youth is deprived of such
weapons.
Fears and objections
IT remains to examine what
education the child, the youth
and the young girl have the
right to receive ; and who, parents
or State, should decide this. There
is no single universal answer, because
conditions vary greatly and most
communities are very jealous of
their independence in this matter.
Some countries have made reser-
vations regarding possible inter-
ference by the State usurping the
role of families and inculcating ideas
contrary to those of the parents.
These reservations are of two kinds :
Some quarters fear that the State
might infringe the rights of minori-
ties, uproot legitimate traditions and
respected customs, obliterate region-
al characteristics, and establish arbi-
trary uniformity.
A like objection is raised through
fear of totalitarian methods ; people
are concerned lest the State should
mass produce little soldiers for the
regime, fanatically attached to a
party or man in power and dead to
the exercise of free thought and
civic responsibility.
The first category, then, fear the
misuse of new ideas in the education
of their children, and the second are
concerned to avoid tyrannical forms
of collective discipline. The first
fear that child will be deprived of
tested values and that his thinking
will drift towards anarchy. The
second are afraid that he will not
think at all.
To meet these apprehensions, Ar-
ticle 26 gives parents a prior right to
choose the kind of education that
shall be given to their children. But
this does not give them the right to
leave their children without educa-
tion. In any case, parents'rights
are not absolute ; they cease when
the child comes of age.
In many countries, the democratic
State has had to contend with

family opposition that was not always
inspired by a desire to preserve tra-
ditions. It has often been a question
of greedily exploiting a child by
setting him to hard manual work
instead of teaching him how to read.
The idea of equality has some-
times led to misunderstanding. It is
not a case of equality in the results
of education, these depend upon
vocation and effort. Equality means
that every child should be given an
equal chance at the outset of its
pursuit of learning. Not so very long
ago, in certain countries that are
foremost in modern civilization, the
price of a good, complete education
was prohibitive for anyone of modest
means.
the Declaration of Independence of
the United States, seems to have
been the most keen and far-seeing
of the pioneers in this respect. For
him, the normal exercise of demo-
cracy necessarily implied a relatively
high degree of education among the
citizens.
Great pioneers
- w-EFFERSON wrote :"Popular edu-
) cation produces self-government,
and popular government is nei
ther sure nor efficacious if the
people are not educated".
It is largely due to him and to
Benjamin Franklin that the United
States was the first nation to
petrified in false formulae, or
pedantic and lifeless knowledge.
At the dawn of modern times, while
Comenius, Thomas More, Erasmus,
Bude, Vives and Montaigne planned
the lines or a powerful new culture,
Rabelais and later Moliere cruelly
satirized the shallow and soulless
learning of incompetent teachers
or doctors.
As regards rational pedagogy, this
came to growth mainly in the
nineteenth century. Its great
pioneer was Pestalozzi in Switzer-
land ; he died in 1827. Others were
Froebel, Miss Edgeworth (Scotland),
Channing and Horace Mann (United
States), and, more recently, Mrs.
Montessori and many others.
THE TOUCHSTONE
OF CIVILIZATION
What must be popularized are the
means of acquiring culture. Whether
it is thereafter obtained depends on
personal effort. What is essential is
that no human being who really
wishes to learn should be prevented
from doing so by reasons extraneous
to culture-distance, class preju-
dice, or financial obstacles.
In a word, the acquiring of culture
should be free and difficult, not
expensive and easy.
The history of education, at va-
rious periods, bears a clear relation
to the history of civilization at those
periods. But it must not be confused
with the history of the right to
education, a comparatively recent
ideal. There have been periods of
great culture when education was
fairly closely reserved for the pri-
vileged classes.
It was really only after the
recognition and proclamation, at the
end of the eighteenth century, of the
civil rights of the person, that it
became clear how valueless those
civil rights would prove if a citizen
did not enjoy, fully and equally with
others, the right to education.
Thomas Jefferson, the author of
establish free and compulsory edu-
cation. (It had been compulsory in
Sweden and Denmark since 1719,
but not free).
The great French advocates of the
idea that education should be
accessible to all were Condorcet,
Carnot, Guizot, and later Paul Bert
and Jules Ferry. In England, the
leaders of the movement were John
Stuart Mill and Huxley and, so far
as post-school education was con-
cerned, Owen, Kingsley and Ruskin ;
in Germany, Wilhelm VOn Humboldt ;
and in Russia, Tolstoy, who wrote
simple stories of a few lines for
children learning how to read.
For the very modern conquest of
the universal right to education, the
ground had been prepared, of course,
by all the great educators who,
throughout the ages, had tried
to promote study and raise its
level. Some struggled against the
ignorance that was too generally
accepted as being the lot of the
poor classes, of other races, or of
women.
Others fought against false forms
of culture, like dogmatic or routine'
education, sciences that had become
India, China and Persia have
always honoured the man of letters,
the scholar and the artist. Once
material conditions allow of elemen-
tary and subsequently higher educ-
ation accessible to all, these great
countries with their ancient tradi-
tions of culture will make tremen-
dous contributions to human civili-
zation, which must call, more than
ever before, upon the efforts of all
its children.
In our times, whole continents,
where lower standards of living
seemed inseparable from an equally
low standard of education, are now
adopting popular education, acces-
sible to all. This, as Jefferson said,
is essential to any democratic regime
based on popular endorsement.
Recognizing that human dignity
demands that all men be educated
with a view to the preservation of
justice, freedom and peace, the
United Nations wrote the right to
education into the Universal Decla-
ration of 1948.
Unesco, whose constitution enjoins
it"to advance through the educa-
tional, scientific and cultural
relations of the peoples of the world,
the objectives of international peace
and of the common welfare of
mankind", has a major role in the
implementation of this right.
In a"Basic Programme"drawn
up in 1950 Unesco broadly defined
its task with regard to education as
follows :"To help Member States to
ensure that their educational systems
are adequate in every way to meet
the needs of society and of the indi-
vidual."
As well as helping its Member
States to improve their existing
educational systems, Unesco has
taken the initiative in helping them
to extend these systems to meet new
needs. There are areas where
schools are almost unknown ; illi-
teracy is widespread and even on
the increase. There are deficient
and handicapped children who
require special treatment. Adult
education must be developed every-
where for"you cannot have a wholly
educated younger generation amid
an adult society remaining sunk in
ignorance."
Wider horizons
THAT is why Unesco, in colla-boration with its Member
States and with the United
Nations and some of the Specialized
Agencies has undertaken a pro-
gramme for the development of
what is known as.'fundamental
education", particularly intended for
the vast underdeveloped areas of
the world.
Literacy teaching is just one aspect
of fundamental education. It merely
opens up wider horizons which lead
to campaigns for the improvement
of health, living standards, food
production and hygiene. Its aim is
"to help people to achieve the social
and economic progress which will
enable them to take their place in
the modern world."
To bring fundamental education
to all who need it requires a great
many teachers possessing the right
techniques and teaching aids. As
a first step to meeting this need
Unesco has undertaken a bold expe-
riment-the creation of a network
of regional fundamental education
centres where technicians receive
practical training in this new branch
of education.
The basic purpose of these cen-
tres is to produce"teachers of
teachers', as graduates from the
courses return to their own countries
to staff similar centres organized on
more local lines. In these centres
teachers who are to work in the
field will be trained.
Already two regional centres are
operating. At Patzcuaro, Mexico,
the first course of student-teachers
has graduated and its members have
returned to countries in all parts of
Latin America. The second centre
serving Middle East countries was
opened in Sirs El Layan, Egypt, last
year.
One basic aim
To keep in touch with educa-tional developments through-
out the world, Unesco has
organized an Education Clearing
House which carries out enquiries
and studies in co-operation with the
International Bureau of Education
at Geneva, and with national docu-
mentation centres.
It has also sent international mis-
sions of educators to give technical
advice and assistance to Member
States which ask for such help.
Missions working on such subjects as
primary and secondary teaching,
literacy campaigns, adult education
in rural communities and education
for women, have visited such coun-
tries as Thailand, the Philippines,
Afghanistan, Bolivia, Burma, India,
Pakistan, Iraq, Syria and Ecuador.
The United Nations Programme of
Technical Assistance has made it
possible to increase the number of
such missions.
Whether it concerns itself with
education for women, education for
international understanding, the
special problems of children, the
improvement of curricula, methods
and teaching materials, teaching
about JIuman Rights and United
Nations, or work for young people,
all Unesco's activities in these fields
have one basic aim-making the
principle of the right to education a
practical reality.

The Martyrs
Lygia is a highly romanticized characterization of an
early Christian martyr who does not die. But the Chris-
tian martyrs who are burned alive, tortured and fed to the
lions in Quo Wadis are not characters of fiction and Hen-
ryk Sienkiewicz had no need to invent them.
If the Albigenses, for example, or Jan Huss have inspired
poets ; if Joan of Arc, the Quakers and Giordano Bruno
have appeared on the stage or screen, they were not area'
tions of the imagination but real victims in history who
suffered the tortures inflicted upon them by other men
because of their religious beliefs. Perhaps no book of
fiction can plead the cause of religious liberty or religious
tolerance with the same force as the straight, dry account
of a martyrology or with the persuasion of a simple
monument in certain concentration camps. But these
poems, these plays, these novels and films help to remind
us that the message of the victims still needs retelling and
that all human beliefs have had their martyrs.
Uncle Tom
SOME of the greatestwriters in istory have
attacked slavery, but
while their reasoned argu-
ments in favour of its abo-
lition convinced the few
who read them, they never
succeeded in rousing pub-
lic opinion. Just over a
century ago, however, a
book appeared which
stirred up a whirlwind of
anti-slavery agitation in the
United States. Uncle Tom's
Cabin more than confirmed
the prophecy of a French
literary critic of the time
who wrote :"'It will do

a whole series of visas. He
would have to make reser.
vations, apply for currency
allotments, be medically
examined, undergo innocni-
ations... and even then he
would probably still be
waiting for a visa. In other
words his trip would re-
quire weeks of prepar-
ations. The relative ease
with which Phileas Fogg
moved from country to
country serves to remind
us how many obstacles
have since been raised tv

cut ! KE many fond parents",wrote Charles Dickens,"I
have in my heart of hearts
a favourite child, and his name is
David Copperfield". Dickens'
book remains one of the most
loved and one of the most moving
pieces of fiction in the English
language. To young people, living
normal family lives and who are
not forced to go out to work at
the age of ten, David's experiences
are a reminder that they are for-
tunate to be warmly clothed, to
have a home, to be adequately fed,
and to go to a good school.
Though it is over a century since
Dickens told his story of David
Copperfield, he still speaks out on
behalf of the millions of children
who grow up as he himself did,
abandoned or at best merely tole-
rated, victims of unkindness, of
want or simply of the ignorance
of their elders. Dickens died over
80 years ago but his young hero
still speaks in the name of all
children who are today deprived

'EVERYONE HAS THE RIGHT
TO CLIMB TO THE TOP OF A TREE'
by Andréa Salieri
THE"Sauvage"was really
right after all. Even if
he did cause the two
scandals which created
such an uproar in the class on
human rights in our small school.
We had nicknamed him the
"Sauvage"because he let his hair
grow so long, because of the
acrobatic tricks he was always
performing, and the earsplitting
shrieks which filled the courtyard
as he raced gleefully from school
each day. But that didn't
prevent him from being an
excellent student. He was ex-
tremely well liked by our teacher
even though he once admitted
(privately of course) that the
"Sauvage"sometimes terrified
him.
Our school, located at the edge
of a small village in central
France, had only one teacher
and only one classroom-like so
many other schools in France
today. One day, the teacher
decided to organize a small ex-
hibition on human rights. He set
up a series of beautiful white
panels with the 30 Articles of the
Universal Declaration displayed
in large printed type. There
were simple explanations for
each Article, and many photo-
graphs and engravings to illus-
trate them.
And the nth e 'Sauvage"
stepped in with his scandal.
On the first night of the
inauguration of the exhibition, the
"Sauvage"got hold of a huge
sheet of paper and wrote out the
following inscription :"Article : 31 :
Everyone has the right to climb
up to the top of the tree". The next
morning he nailed his notice to
the trunk. of the chestnut tree
which rose majestically in the
middle of the courtyard. Its
lowest branches were some 30
feet above the ground.
The notice was a huge success
with all the students. We roared
with laughter. And yet we felt
there was something embarrass-
ing about the whole thing like
a poor joke, not in very good
taste ; and almost sacriligious.
"He's making fun of human
rights", one boy whispered.
What surprised us most, how-
ever, was that the teacher didn't
get at all angry. He merely
announced that he recognized the
handwriting. And after the
"Sauvage"admitted that he had
done it, the teacher turned to him
and asked simply :"What on
earth made you want to do that ?"
The"Sauvage"hung his head
and fidgeted, but made no reply.
"What did you want to do", asked
the teacher,"make fun of the
exhibition ?" This jerked the
"Sauvage"out of his silence.
"Oh no", he protested."It wasn't
that at all. It was just an idea I
had..."
It took him five full minutes to
explain his idea, simple though it
was."In other words", said the
teacher,"it's one thing to hare
rights and quite another to be able
to exercise them. Is that what
you were driving at ? If it is, I
agree with you."
The fact is that the."Sauvage"
knew the text of the Universal
Declaration quite well. site had
noted, for example, that"Every-
one has the right to property".
But his parents had no property
except their clothes and their
furniture. He had also read :
"Everyone has the right to rest
and leisure", and that reminded
him how tired his mother was
every evening-too tired to speak
and too tired even to eat hen the
family sat down to dinner. She,
of course, had the right to leisure
- in principle.
He had also read :"Everyone
has the right to education". But
in class he had learned that there
was a shortage of schools in most
countries and that in huge regions
of the world there were no schools
at all. In such places children
might well have the right to
education, but it didn't change
their situation.
"Well", said our teacher,"I see
you are beginning to understand.
The Articles of the Declaration
aren't a magic formula ; they are
rules. They point to the rights
that people have and imply that
everyone-that is every citizen in
any country anywhere-should
have the possibility of enjoying
them. And if a person doesn't
have the possibility then it's got
to be given to him. By whom ?
Well, the government, the state
or the communitv-in fact
everyone. When the Declaration
says'Everyone has the right to
education'it means'the commu-
nity is required to build enough
schools so that all children can
get a proper education'."
"Everyone would have the
right to climb up the chestnut
tree", said the"Sam'age"to
himself,"if it was'worth the
trouble, and if someone provided
a ladder."
But he said nothing since he
had grasped the teacher's point
and that was what mattered. In
fact the"Sauvage"said nothing
more about human rights until he
precipitated the second scandal.
This occurred on the day our
teacher discussed the great men
of history, the martyrs and refor-
mers to whom we owe many of
the rights and freedoms pro-
claimed today. At the end of the
lesson our teacher asked us a
question."Do you think these
great men succeeded" ?"Do you
think they won their fight for
freedom and justice ?"
Everyone of us in the class
replied with an enthusiastic
"yes"-the proof being the
Universal Declaration itself.
Everyone of us, that is, except
the"Sam'age". When his turn
came to reply he shook his head
firmly."It's nothing but lies,"
he said, and ignoring the horrified
"ohs"and"ahs"that went up
from, all of us, he went on :
"You can't tell me that all men
have become brothers. Or that
justice exists everywhere today
any more than equality. It's a
I."Iie/'
Once again the teacher said
that it was the"Sam'age"who
was might. lIe explained that the
fight for real freedom ; was not
won-far from it. He said that
the Universal Declaration was
not a communique of victory and
compared it rathcr to an order of
the day.
Then he turned to the"Sau-
Yage"."The Declaration seems
to make you boiling mad", he
said."That's fine. That's what
it's supposed to do. It doesn't
describe human rights as they
are but as they ought to be.
I've told you how other men and
women have fought in the past.
When you think of the Declara-
tion today, you can think of the
rights that still down 1 exist, and
you can get angry. But also try
to think of ways in which you can
live up to the Declaration and
make it a reality."
The"Sauvage"'was no longer
thinking about the chestnut tree
in the playground. He was some-
. what embarrassed that the tea-
cher seemed to be speaking just
to him. But when the teacher
suddenly asked :"Do you think
the world is civilized-the
people in our own country for
example ?", the boy's reply came
quickly."No, not entirely.
Otherwise we wouldn't have to be
taught about human rights."
"Well then", said our teacher
speaking now to the entire class,
"Let's learn to apply human
rights to everything in our daily
lives. If every class everywhere
did that, I think we'd end up in
time being really civilized. And
remembel"if lve don't act human
rights ourselves no-one else will
do it for us."
