DIPTYCH WITH TRANSPARENCIES
1996, acrylic on canvas (height 73 cm, width 1.20 m)
by Jean-André Martin
Much of this artist's output consists of assemblages of several canvases. In each part of the diptych shown here, he notes that "the overlapping colours create
impressions of transparency in a work aspiring to symbolize the enrichment that accrues from encounters of all kinds."

I Does medicine treat patients or combat illness? Are patients
completely autonomous individuals ordo they form part of a
natural, social and cosmic environment? Is illness caused simply by the
intrusion into the body of an outside agent-a virus ora demon?oris
it the sign of an imbalance, a disrupted harmony which the body tries to
rectify, where necessary with medical assistance? What role should be
played in treatment by knowledge that can be acquired, codified and
taught, as opposed to hands-on experience arising from direct contact
between practitioner and patient?
These are some of the many questions raised in the presentissue. Our
contributors, who come from different cultural backgrounds, do not
claim to offer hard and fast answers. Instead they put these issues in the
different-sometimes very differentperspectives of their respective
traditions and doctrines, composing a panoramic picture of medical
practice in which knowledge and faith, the culture of the community and
personal contact, can sometimes go hand in hand.
Until recently, the approach of modern Western medicine has been
radically different from that of all other cultures. The Western art of
healing is based on a body of scientific knowledge which views the
human body's organs, functions and ailments as phenomena governed
by physical, physiological and genetic laws and therefore independent of
cultural and local contexts. In the Western tradition treatment means
using knowledge of these laws, often backed by sophisticated
techniques, to neutralize ailments. Things are starting to change,
however, and it is increasingly recognized that other forms of medicine
have something to offer or at least that certain questions must be asked.
Nobody would dream of denying the beneficial effectsin some cases
immenseof modern medicine. But the excesses to which it can and
sometimes does lead are equally plain to see. Is there nota risk of
dehumanization inherent in mobilizing a battery of technical resources on
patients while disregarding their mental outlook, their culture, their
psychological, moral and spiritual resources, their dignity and willpower,
their emotional environment and their attitudes to life and death?
Perhaps so-called traditional forms of medicine still have much
to teach us

Culture and health
BY CLAUDINE BRELET-RUEFF
Modern medicine may be coming round to the idea
that the sick are not 'machines' but people rooted in
their cultural and natural environment
Medicine, perhaps more than any other
of the activities that contribute to our
survival, depends on the cultural context in
which it is practised, dealing as it does with
birth, suffering and death, those essential fea¬
tures of our human condition. People have
been receiving medical attention since long
before biology and chemistry came into being,
long before the advent of Western-style pre¬
ventive medicine. Highly efficient therapies
some of them, such as the trepanation and
dental surgery performed by the Incas, involv¬
ing the use of amazing techniques have been
employed for thousands of years.
Only recently, however, have such tradi¬
tional forms of medicine been studied in the
West. Their significance and value have been
more deeply understood by Westerners thanks
to the worldvicw of modern physics (relativ¬
ity and quantum theory, thermodynamics)
in which everything is seen in terms of inter¬
action and decolonization, which has given
peoples previously held in contempt an
opportunity to make the voices of their cul¬
tures heard once more.
Western medicine, which had hitherto
regarded human beings as "machines", is grad¬
ually coming round to the idea of treating
"the whole person", in accordance with an
outlook that in some respects links up with
that held in traditional societies. The medical
model that is thus emerging is no longer inter¬
ested solely in disease but in health in a general
sense, and in the psychological and cultural
factors from which it stems.
Those who extol the virtues of progress
are sometimes annoyed by certain "irrational"
aspects of traditional forms of medicine, but
the fact is that they spring from cultures that
firmly believe in the existence of a network of
interdependences between human beings and
the universe at large; a person's relationship
with nature, in the broadest sense, is regarded
as that of a humble partner, not a proprietor.
The various types of traditional medicine,
from shamanism to Ayurveda, reflect widely
different ways of thinking, but all of them, as
the following examples show, tend to see
humans as an integral part of the world as a
whole, and science and spirituality as being
different points on the same continuum.
Shamanism
A feature common to the various forms of
shamanism found all over the world, from
Siberia to Amazonia, is the practice of diag-

nosis and therapy through an ecstatic state. In
addition to possessing a profound, albeit
empirical, knowledge of the medicinal prop¬
erties of plants, the shaman performs also as
poet, soothsayer, healer and sometimes magi¬
cian and ventriloquist as well, but he is above
all else an initiate. Initiation, the personal expe¬
rience of the threefold mystery of suffering,
death and resurrection, bestows an aura of the
sacred on him. While he is officiating, his body
is covered in signs and objects symbolizing
his powers. He is able to communicate with
spirits that arc invisible to the eyes of the
uninitiated, and his words translate the mur-

murs of the deep forest or the windswept
steppes.
As an initiate, he is able to enter in spirit
into his patient's body, to drive out demons
and pursue them in the world beyond. The
convulsing womb of a woman about to give
birth thus becomes a universe peopled with
monsters and mythical beasts, metaphorically
representing the contractions and fears with
which she must contend. The shaman can give
the ailment not only a name but also material
form, removing, often by sucking, from the
patient's body or soul the crystals and blood-
soaked down he has chewed.

This low-relief scene adorns a
royal tomb of the 6th Dynasty
(mid-3rd millennium B.C.) at
Aswan in Egypt.
While the shaman is performing his rites,
the patient is never isolated from the world. As
during voodoo ceremonies in Brazil or Benin,
all his kith and kin arc on hand during the
"therapeutic drama" that helps purge the sick
of their ills. The responsibility for coping
with suffering is shared.
Medicine in ancient Egypt
In addition to the meagre information about
ancient Egyptian medical practices that can be
gleaned from papyri, we can appreciate the
anatomical knowledge required by the tech¬
niques used in the process of mummification
to remove the brain, viscera and eyeballs, and
the Egyptians' command of the antiseptic
properties of the essential oils, resins, herbs
and spices they used not only to embalm the
mortal remains of their dignitaries but also
to treat many illnesses.
Like scribes, sorcerer-physicians were trained
in a "house of life" whose supreme master and
first initiate was the ibis, symbol of the god
of wisdom. When sleeping, the ibis curls itself
up into the shape of a heart, just like the hiero¬
glyph which represents "goodness" and which
is made up of three signs vibration (or air), the
individual (through whom life on earth is car¬
ried on), and the mouth (through which
breathing, also manifested in the beating of the
heart, passes). As in Chinese medicine, the "heart
speaks" throughout the body.
Hippocrates, the famous Greek physician
of Antiquity, who had studied the healing art
in the temples of Egypt, divulged the lessons
he had learned. His aphorism "We are what we
eat" and his pronouncements on the impor¬
tance of the interaction between people and
their environment tie in with the explanation
given in the Ebers Papyrus Treatise on the

functioning and knowledge of the heart:
"Four vessels (metou) lead to the liver and
convey moisture and air to it. They then cause
all kinds of illnesses." As well as being the seat
of the intelligence, the "heart" is also the organ
that powers and steers the body, distributing
energy thereto via the metou, which carry air,
waste products and blood. Each individual's
blood is held to pulsate at its own specific fre¬
quency. This pulsatory conception of the
human being might explain why so many of
the incantations that have been rediscovered
were not accompanied by any form of treat¬
ment. Others were performed at the same time
as particular potions were administered.
Rationalists are often put out by the mag¬
ical aspect of pharaonic medicine, such as the
use of sacred sleep in temples. This therapy,
probably induced by hypnosis that weakened
self-awareness, might have remained a puz¬
zling phenomenon if sleep cures had not come
to be used in modern clinics.
As disciples and servants of Thoth, the
compassionate god entrusted by Ra with the
protection of humanity, the sorcerer-physi¬
cians did not claim to have invented the spells
they intoned or the treatments they pre¬
scribed. Their lore came from the gods. Learn¬
ing alone is not, however, enough to make a
good physician, whose status is indissociable
from that of priest. Not only must he study
while young, work hard and long so that
knowledge, as it were, comes naturally and
grows of its own accord, but he must live an
upright life, since "holy things should be
taught only to those who are pure".

selves in order to overcome death, and humans
likewise had to pay the price of their survival

A Dayak shaman in
Kalimantan (Indonesia)
exorcises a spirit which has
possessed a child.
Bernardino de Sahagún, who arrived in Mexico
in 1 529, relates that never a day passed but that
women were sacrificed to the goddess of salt,
or children to the rain gods. Their hearts were
torn out in order that the sun might not die.
From their earliest years, children were sub¬
jected to the severest discipline of a mystical
and military hierarchy. Depending on the
social class to which they belonged, boys were
educated either in local schools which pre¬
pared them for the productive work of the
community, or in religious schools whose
austerity trained them for their future roles as
priest-physicians or high officials of the state.
Illness was seen as a divine punishment
provoked by a disturbance of the cosmic bal¬
ance resulting from the failure of the sick to
conform to the natural order to which every¬
one should submit on pain of unleashing the
wrath of the gods and bringing on further
cataclysms. The responsibility of the sooth¬
sayer-priest {ticitt), as the humans' go-between
with the gods, was therefore not so much to
treat ailments that had been sent as punish¬
ments as to find out, especially by means of
astrology and sacred numerology, what the
sick had done to displease the gods. He
employed simple forms of divination (recov¬
ery was guaranteed if grains of maize thrown
down on the ground or into a pot of water did
not separate; otherwise the patient would die)
but also used hallucinogenic plants such as
peyotl (Anhalonium lewinî), a small spineless
cactus, and sacred mushrooms such as the teo-
nanacatl (Paneolus campanulatus), which were
eaten to induce the collective trances that
accompanied human sacrifices.

12,000 medicinal plants ipatli) which were sold

in the markets of the main towns and were
sometimes grown in the floating gardens
known as chinampas. They were used mainly
for the purpose of treating minor ailments.
Among the Aztecs, where the individual was
absorbed bodily into the community, illness
was regarded primarily as the sign of some
disturbance of the cosmic order, fraught with
the dread of a punishment on which their
afterlife depended.
Sacred medicine
and all-round health
Although it is clear from these few examples
that traditional medicine is indissociable fro m
the spiritual path chosen by the society within
which it is practised, there are certain features
common to all forms of such medicine that are
absent from modern medicine. These are:
'«* a holistic approach to the individual, seen
as a multi-dimensional at once physical,
mental, social and spiritual being who lives
in close interdependence with his or her nat¬
ural environment and with the vast, mysteri¬
ous cosmos;
a view of the physician's role as being close
to that of the priest, or indeed the sorcerer, at
any event of the initiate who needs to have
direct experience of death and suffering. The
physician has to be upright and pure, and is
held accountable to men and the gods, if not
indeed to life itself;
'* learning based upon observation of living
reality and a thorough, albeit empirical,
knowledge of the natural environment and
natural resources, including cosmic rhythms,
which are reflected in the fluctuations observ¬
able in human health.
Traditional medicine's characteristically
global approach to life and the human being is
attracting growing interest in the West, which
nowadays takes a would-be holistic view of the
world holos being the Greek both for
"whole" and for "sacred". Hence, the defini¬
tion of health given by the World Health
Organization (WHO) can also serve as a uni¬
versal definition of the human being consid¬
ered in all his or her many dimensions: health
is "a state of complete physical, mental and
social well-being and not merely the absence of
disease or infirmity." This definition bids
modern society to draw inspiration from the
wisdom of traditional medicine. It offers
modern medicine an opportunity to find the
path of harmony and wisdom.

I A major psychological problem of our
I times is what I call "loss of relatedness".
It takes many forms and seems to me to some
degree intertwined with the progress of mod¬
ern science and technology.
Here are two examples taken from my
experience as a psychotherapist.
The father of a boy who obstinately
refused to go to school over a long period
once said to me: "Today human beings can go

school?" In other words, he wanted to oper¬
ate his son like a machine. Sensing this lack of
"relatedness", the son resisted his father, con¬
sciously or unconsciously.
Another modern trend is the increase in
psychosomatic diseases. Modern medicine,
based on the premise of a dichotomy between
mind and body, has made great progress in
many fields, especially the conquest of dis-'
ease. But at the same time, this dichotomy
seems to be responsible for an increase in psy¬
chosomatic illnesses; it is almost as if nature
were taking revenge.
I suspect that the rapid progress of mod¬
ern science has something to do with this. To
see whether this is so let us examine the main
principles of scientific methodology.
The basic premise of scientific methodol¬
ogy is that the observer must be separated

from the phenomena that are observed, so
that the results of observation are indepen¬
dent of the observer and have universal value.
The distinction between subject and object is
a great achievement of modern European cul¬
ture, which can claim thereby to have given
science its universal quality.
Science has also become inseparable from
technology, which is now available to anyone.
To use technology, all you have to do is follow
the instructions in the manual; you don't
need any special skill or ability. As the father
of the high-school boy said, a human being can
go to the moon just by pressing buttons.
The success of modern technology has led
many people to want to apply its methods to
family and social relationships. Everybody
wants to know the best technique for con¬
trolling or managing others. There has been a
flowering of "how to" knowledge: how to raise
a good baby, how to treat old people, and so on.
The Buddha is shown
meditating (centre) and
preaching on a 5th-6th-
century-A.D. mándala from
Bamyan (Afghanistan).
The social and human sciences have fol¬
lowed in the wake of the natural sciences and
technology. When a researcher can objectify a
specific aspect of a human being this approach
can achieve reasonable results, but if we think
of a person as a whole being, the methods of
natural science do not work. A researcher is
human, so that it is impossible to make a clear
distinction between subject and object; the
quality of the relationship between the subject
and object always influences the results.
The wholeness

As a psychotherapist, if I meet a hyperactive
six-year-old boy who cannot concentrate on
his work in the classroom and try to be as
objective as possible and avoid any relationship
with him, all I can say is that he is insecure, of
low intelligence and so on. However, if I try to

establish a good relationship with him, so
that he feels protected and is allowed to behave
freely, his behaviour will change.
The important thing is not so much to
observe his present situation accurately as to
wait for his inner possibilities to show them¬
selves. No positive results can be achieved in
psychotherapy unless there is a relationship
between subject and object. This is also true in
education and some fields of medicine. When
I have come across patients with psychoso¬
matic diseases I have sometimes deliberately
tried not to explore their causes, give advice
or use medical drugs. While I have not "cured"
these patients, their symptoms have sponta¬
neously disappeared.
This approach is completely different fro m
technology, where everything is very clear-cut.
W the unesco Courier February i99b
A father and son are shown in
this detail from an Indian
Buddhist low-relief sculpture
(2nd century B.C.).
What one should do and the kind of responses
one gets are all described in the operating man¬
ual: a specific action produces specific results.
Instead, I wait for something to happen, with¬
out knowing exactly what it will be. My
approach is heuristic and I feel that I am cre¬
ating something. Patients are cured by their
creative activities, which are fostered by the
relationship between them and me.
The Buddhist approach
I think Buddhism has much to teach us about
this kind of relationship.
The most important point stressed by the
Buddhist text known as the Garland sutra is
that no being has its own innate "self-nature"."
I am myself because of an infinite number of
relations that I have with others. This is a rad¬
ically different idea from the common belief
that everything that exists has its own nature
and then has its own relations with others.
The Garland sutra starts from the premise
that there are relationships and that these rela¬
tionships define each being.
This Buddhist idea stems from a state of
consciousness which is different from the
ordinary state in which each object is sepa¬
rated from others. At a different level of con¬
sciousness the demarcations between objects
become blurred and eventually everything
becomes one being which cannot be named.
This whole being is called Nothingness because
it has no name, but actually one might say
that it is Everything.
After this experience, consciousness returns
to its ordinary state in which the whole being
manifests itself as separate objects or creatures.
However, each object is a manifestation of the
whole being. In the Kegon School of Buddhism,
this is known as "the Arising of True Nature".
This is what I do in psychotherapy when
I abandon active intentions and simply wait on
events. This attitude is diametrically opposed
to that of modern science and technology. Our
everyday consciousness is oriented by modern
science towards discrimination, whereas in
Buddhism it is oriented towards fusion.
Those who arc totally dominated by mod¬
ern scientific thinking may feel that Buddhist
ideas are confused or nonsensical. For my part ,
I think we need Buddhist ideas as a necessary
counterweight which may, by admitting the
existence of a relationship between subject and
object, make a positive contribution to the
development of science and technology.

practised in India today.
What does the word Ayurveda mean?
The Sanskrit word Ayu means life, and
Veda means to know. In other words,
Ayurveda is the knowledge or science of life.
Ayurveda highlights the basic laws and prin¬
ciples that govern life in the universe. As well
as being concerned with the origin, develop¬
ment and treatment of disease, it discusses
what is beneficial and harmful to life, and what
is conducive to happiness and unhappiness.
What is the relationship between Ayurveda and
the Vedas, India's ancient religious scriptures?
The text known as the Atharva-Veda
explains the theoretical foundations of
Ayurveda and highlights their practical use and
methods of application. It contains anatomical
descriptions and explanations of certain dis¬
eases and methods of treating wounds and
ulcers, as well as a discussion of epidemic diseases
and their management. The Rg Veda, the Yajur
Veda and the Saama Veda also contain mater¬
ial relevant to Ayurvedic medicine.
What are the philosophical foundations of
Ayurveda?
The core belief of the Indian world-view is
that humankind is the epitome of the universe.
In each individual there is as much diversity as
there is in the world outside. To visualize the self
in the entire universe and the entire universe in
the self is the highest aim of human evolution.
The schools of philosophy in which Ayurveda
is rooted thus believe that humankind and the
universe have a common origin and are com¬
posed of the same basic elements.
What are these elements and how is the body
constituted from them?
There arc five basic elements earth, water,
fire, air and ether. They are known as the Pan-
chamahabhootas. Knowledge is perceived
through the senses hearing, touch, vision,
taste and smell.
How is the body constructed and how does it
function?
The basic structural units of the body are
known as dhathus (the word "dhathu" means
"to support"). They are nourished by the inges¬
tion of food. There are seven dhathus in the
human systembody fluids, blood tissue,
muscular tissue, adipose tissue, bone tissue,
nerve tissue and marrow, and generative tissue.
The idea of balance is very important in
Ayurveda. How does it work?

This Ayurvedic treatment is
practised at the Arya Vaidya
Shala Institute in India's
Kerala State.
In Ayurveda, the prevention and cure of
all diseases are based on what are known as the
three doshas: Vatta, Pitta and Kapha. They are
the biological representatives of the five basic
elements which constitute the human body,
and in a healthy person they are always in a
state of equilibrium. In this balanced state,
the three doshas control and perform all phys¬
iological functions. When the balance between
them is disturbed, diseases begin and develop.
The doshas pervade the whole body but in
the normal or healthy state Vatta, Pitta and
Kapha are located in the lower, middle and
upper portions of the body respectively.
They support the body as pillars support
a building and they are actually referred to as
"TriSthuna" or the three pillars. Kapha is pre¬
dominant during childhood, Pitta in youth,
and Vatha in old age. The day is divided into
threeparts day, night and the period for the
digestion of food. Kapha is predominant in
the first part, Pitta in the middle part, and
Vatha in the final part.
The human constitution, both physical
and mental, is determined at conception by
the permutation and combination of the three
doshas that manifest in the gametes. This basic
constitution of the individual remains con¬
stant throughout life. It is known in Sanskrit
as Prakruthi, which means "natural" or the
"original form", and is the expression of the
five basic elements.
How is the practice of Ayurveda organized?
Ayurveda has eight branches dealing respec¬
tively with:
*" physical diseases caused by functional or
systemic disorders;
*" all organs above the shoulders;
*" bodily disorders caused by foreign mate¬
rials such as thorns, grass, stone and nails and
involving the removal of pus and highly viti¬
ated doshas;
diseases caused by bites of snakes, spiders
and other poisons of animal or plant origin;
'*" mental disorders and infectious diseases
caused by unknown or unseen creatures or
germs. This branch also deals with sacrifices
and rituals intended to remove evil spirits;
*" children's diseases. Methods of purifying
breast milk and diseases originating from
astrological defects;
*" improving the quality of body tissues,
consequently increasing resistance, strength
and intellect, delaying the ageing process and
maintaining a youthful body;
'* increasing the quality and quantity of sem¬
inal fluid and ova and methods of increasing
sexual desire, vigour and fertility; curing steril¬
ity and other related sexual disorders.
How would you define the relationship between
Ayurveda and Western thought?
Modern medicine and Western thought gen¬
eralize and categorize individuality. Accord¬
ing to the Western concept of normality and
health, what is common in a majority of indi¬
viduals constitutes the norm.
Ayurveda holds that normality must be
evaluated individually, since every human being
manifests his or her own particular and spon¬
taneous temperament and functioning. In the
East, the key to understanding is acceptance,
observation and experience. The West, on the
contrary, believes in questioning, analysis and
logical deduction. Western thought trusts
objectivity, whereas Eastern thought empha¬
sizes subjectivity.

The healing power of faith BYJANESCHREIBMAN
In India, the sick visit the tombs of saints in search of a cure
Top, a sick child who has been
cured is ritually weighed
during a pilgrimage to a
saint's tomb. The equivalent of
her weight in sugar will be
given to the priest.
For centuries the faithful have been mak¬
ing pilgrimages to the burial sites of holy
men throughout the Indian subcontinent. The
pilgrims believe that these saints, some of
whom are women, have supernatural powers,
and that when they died God empowered them
with a benevolent force called baraka that
emanates from the grave and can be used to per¬
form miracles for the living.
Different rituals have evolved at these sites to
unite the faithful with this special power and
give them spiritual strength. Some of these prac¬
tices are universal and some are specific to certain
tombs. One very common ritual is for a person
to be chained to a railing surrounding the tomb
or to a part of the building housing it.
The supplicants remain chained until they
feel united with the power of the saint. This
may take a few hours, or involve attempts
lasting several days. After experiencing this
union, supplicants wear the chains wrapped
around their arms as a badge of honour. It is
also common to see the faithful walking in
circles around the tomb until they drop from
dizziness or exhaustion. When have recovered
their strength, they get up and continue. The
faithful are led through these rituals, which
also constitute an attempt to invoke the spirit
of the deceased, by hereditary priests who are
often descendants of the holy person buried
there. When an infertile woman gives birth,
or a sick child is cured, the child is brought
back to be weighed, so that a gift of raw sugar
amounting to the exact weight of the child
can be offered. This is accepted by the priests
on behalf of the saint.
If the tomb is located near a body of water,
either natural or artificial, the water is consid-

ered to be imbued with curative powers and
the pilgrims immerse themselves in it fully
clothed in the case of the women. Another
common ritual is that of fumigation. Incense
is burned near the tomb. If the illness or mis¬
fortune is due to a spirit that has entered the
body it will be "smoked out".
Lavish decoration
Any type of behaviour, as long as it is not
destructive, is accepted at these locations. Peo¬
ple are allowed, even encouraged, to forget
everyday restraints and sing, dance or shout to
their hearts' content. The tombs are lavishly
decorated, and many sites house additional
shrines and cenotaphs dedicated to lesser sacred
personages.
A visit to the tomb is a break from the
arduous routine of daily life and the strict
social controls of Indian society. The more
popular locations arc equipped with small
rooms around a courtyard in which entire
families can stay overnight, or for a few days.
Visits to these tomb sites have become part
of the secular tradition of the people, attract¬
ing them regardless of their religious affiliation
or walks of life. They are places where rich and
poor, uneducated and educated, Muslim,
Hindu, Christian and Jain all come together,

Two
complementary

traditions coexist
among the
Haalpulaaren
people of Senegal
Senegal: a mirror of the cosmos
BY EMMANUELLE KADYA TALL
African traditional medicine seeks both
to cure disease and to make sense of mis-
fortune and illness.
In addition to herbal or biochemical reme¬
dies, a patient must be given psychological and
social back-up, which plays an equally impor¬
tant part in the cure. This has long been known
in traditional African medicine, which tries to
place the occurrence of illness in a context, to
integrate a specific ailment into a wider frame¬
work of disorder and decipher its meaning.
In keeping with a widespread African
notion of the punishment of evil, traditional
healers regard a sick person as the victim of
external aggression of human or supernatural
origin. It is not so much the details of a symp¬
tom as its recurrence and association with
other symptoms which determine the choice

of remedy. If the symptoms persist, the search
for a cure is extended to other systems of med¬
icine including biochemical treatment to relieve
physical pain and traditional treatment to
appease evil spirits.
The two systems exist more in harmony
with each other than in competition. Biomed-
icine concentrates on the patient's body, over¬
looking the fact that the patient is a social being.
The traditional healer takes account of the social
aspect and diagnoses the illness in accordance
with a system of symbolic interpretation shared
by the whole community. Traditional cures,
empirical as they are, are rooted in the sym¬
bolism of a society, such as its cosmology.
The Haalpulaaren
ofnorthern Senegal
The theoretical and practical medical knowl¬
edge of the Haalpulaaren people of northern
Senegal is based on several traditions. These
farming people who have been in contact with
Islam since the eleventh century, are divided
into lineage groups originally based on social
and occupational categories (marabouts,
hunter-warriors, fishermen, craftsmen and
slaves). Each group has its own special field of
knowledge. The hunter-warriors, fishermen
and shepherds know about ecology and med¬
icine. The descendants of the toorooBe group
("God's beggars") are conversant with Islam.
Craftsmen have highly specialized knowl¬
edge of healing. Blacksmiths, through their
mastery of iron and fire, soothe burns and
lance abscesses. Weavers tie knots to stop
headaches and toothache. Leather workers
make small bags to contain the writings pre¬
scribed by marabouts. Everyone acquires some
basic therapeutic knowledge during their
apprenticeship, but some are naturally gifted
healers and only one of these is recognized as
such in each generation and lineage group. He
acquires his knowledge from his group and
his activity is confined to the home and the vil¬
lage. Sometimes, however, his reputation
spreads to the whole region.
These types of healing are not based on a
divinatory form of investigation into the causes
of illness but on observation and experience,
and the purpose of a cure is only to make the
symptoms and physical pain disappear.
Oral and written wisdom
There is another, more scholarly and secret tra¬
dition among marabouts and hunters of sor¬
cerers (or counter-sorcerers). Marabouts never
interpret an illness in terms of sorcery because
sorcerers belong to a pre-Islamic universe rejected
by Islam. They rely on writing, the instrument
of the Qur'an. Counter-sorcerers, who belong

to a more relaxed pagan universe, combat sor¬
cerers and use the spoken word, the medium of
the traditional pre-Islamic world. The two
groups stand far apart and do not share the same
cosmological landmarks, but their rivalry does
not prevent them from working together.
They both start by asking themselves why
their patients are ill. Their powers of healing are
based on being able to give explanations con¬
sistent with the theory and practice of cause
and effect in Haalpulaar culture.
Evil spirits
Apart from the will of God, there are three
possible main causes of illness and misfor¬
tune: the actions of sorcerer-cannibals and
spirit-devils, and "maraboutagc" or magic.
Sorcerer-cannibals are human beings who
leave their bodily form and go off in spirit
form to hunt the spirit of their prey. They
belong to the pre-Islamic world of "drinkers of
blood", a parallel group modelled on human
society. They meet at night and organize feasts
to which each of them must bring in turn their
contribution of human flesh. Sorcerers attack
their victims by entering their belly. The symp¬
toms of a sorcerer's attack are hard to detect
because the Haalpulaar medical system relics
less on nosology (the analysis of symptoms)
than on aetiology (the study of causes). But
some symptoms, like unexplained fainting fol¬
lowed by delirium, young children having
nightmares, spitting blood, bloodshot eyes or
nosebleeds, are immediately seen as sorcery.
Spirit-devils are creatures that form part of
Islamic culture. Of monstrous appearance, they
haunt certain places at certain times of the day
when the primitive world reasserts its rights
over the domesticated world. A person who
breaks social laws by walking through the bush
at midday or midnight, or who crosses a
deserted village square may have an unpleasant
encounter. The mere sight of these spirits and
devils can trigger off pathological states ranging
from mental disturbance to partial or total
paralysis. Their vigorous breathing enters the
victim's body and leaves traces such as swellings,
paralysis and damage to the intelligence, indis¬
putable evidence of their attack.
"Maraboutage", or "bewitchment" is an
activity which is widely found in other soci¬
eties where it is known as black magic or witch¬
craft. There arc no symptoms enabling it to be
22 r
THE UNESCO lOURIER FEBRUARY 1998
diagnosed. However, a range of indispositions
and minor accidents are attributed to this kind
of aggression. Bewitchment targets the social
personality of the subject and its most extreme
effect is imbecility. Used constructively,
bewitchment can increase a person's social abil¬
ities, and in this case it is highly appreciated.
Some Islamic priests are great experts in this.
Three divisions
of the body
The Haalpulaaren divide the body up in three
ways symmetrically, with a left and a right
side, transversally, with the right leg associ¬
ated with the left arm and vice versa, and ver¬
tically, from top to bottom.
The first division symbolizes the contrast
between masculine (right) and feminine (left).
The second is connected with the distortion
caused by the breathing of spirit-devils. The

third corresponds to the progress of an ill¬
ness, always from the bottom upwards.
Headaches, for instance, are often said to orig¬
inate from an illness lower down in the body.
Therapy is thus designed to make the illness go
back down to the lower limbs from which it
can leave the body more easily.
Symptoms and causes
The healing arts include physical techniques,
herbal preparations, writings and incantations,
which are often used in conjunction.
Massage, touching, cauterization, cutting
the skin, knots of cotton thread are all
designed, along with incantations and writ¬
ings, to ease pain, cast out the disease and pro¬
tect the sick person.
Medicinal plants are used to purify or heal.
Purification is carried out by taking baths,
inhaling decoctions of leaves and roots, fumi
gating the head or administering enemas. Swal¬
lowing powders and potions also helps.
Short and fervent incantations (ccfi) and
writings (binndi) belong to pre-Islamic and
Islamic tradition respectively. The former use
the spoken word to connect humans directly
with the plant and animal world. Each group
has cefi enabling it to work harmoniously
with its natural environment. With the writ¬
ten word (binndi), communication is indi¬
rect. The marabout writes on a piece of wood
a few Qur'anic verses, figures derived from
some of the verses, or prayers to God. Then he
wipes the board with cotton soaked in water
and gives it to the patient, who will keep it in
a bottle of water which he will drink or use to
wash himself.
So the traditional healer works on two lev¬
els symptoms and causes. On the first level, he
fights the visible evidence of the illness; on the
second, he attacks the illness at its root.

Zimbabwe: a healer in
the marketplace
Gordon Dhliwayo, a n'angaor
traditional healer, at a market
in the suburbs of Harare, the
capital of Zimbabwe.
In Zimbabwe,
traditional
healers are on call
to solve all kinds
of medical, social,
spiritual and
cultural
problems
Fin his "office" in the Mbare musika, a
market on the outskirts of Harare, the
capital of Zimbabwe, Gordon Dhliwayo is
almost hidden behind heaps of twisted roots,
earthtone powders, forbidden furs, horns,
bones and shells that clutter the small table in
front of him.
Dhliwayo is a n 'anga or traditional healer.
To reach him for consultation, you pass by
umpteen tables of tomato and cabbage sell¬
ers, browse over piles of fruit, and continue
through the kitchenware section mainly
hand-carved wooden utensils and baskets
beautifully woven with intricate designs.
The ordinariness of the dozen healers prac¬
tising in the market is striking. Dhliwayo wears
a dingy jump-suit, and were it not for the horse
tail in one hand and the tortoise-shell in the
other, you might take him for a garage hand.
His appearance belies the powerful talents ances¬
tral spirits have bestowed upon him.
One secret his grandmother never told him
was to put butter on a burn. A good n'anga
knows that crushed ostrich egg is the proper
remedy, and instead of a low dose of buffered
aspirin when baby has a headache, Dhliwayo

Mutual respect between modern
and traditional healers
Nineteenth-century colonialism bred scepti¬
cism which resulted in the Witchcraft Sup¬
pression Act, which forbade traditional heal¬
ing in what is now Zimbabwe. Today, the
n 'angas at Mbare's musika and another 25,000
of them throughout the country are licensed
by the Zimbabwe National Traditional Heal¬
ers Association (ZINATHA). This associa¬
tion was established in 1980, shortly after the
Rhodesian government was replaced by a par¬
liamentary democracy, and the country
renamed itself Zimbabwe.
Since independence, ZINATHA has offered
recommendations to the government on the
acceptance and use of traditional medicine. Cur¬
rently, the association is co-operating with the
University of Zimbabwe on research into the
herbs used by its members. Mutandi Sibanda,
a spokesman at ZINATHA, estimates that 96
per cent of the population consult n'angas,
including patients from abroad and even West¬
ern medical doctors practising in Zimbabwe.
What may have disconcerted the colonists
is that n'angas offer more than health care. If
your afflictions are not in your body, but in
the courtroom, the n'anga has a cure. Some
n 'angas have had to face the courts on charges
of malpractice. Sibanda notes, however, that
since legal recognition of the herbalists under
the auspices of ZINATHA, such cases and
other allegations of quackery have decreased.
Understanding and mutual respect between
modern and traditional healers have developed
outside the courts through workshops and
information exchanges. Most significant is the
training n'angas are receiving to incorporate
HIV/Aids awareness, prevention and care activ¬
ities into their work.
"As long as we have our society," says
Sibanda, "there will be a need for the n'anga
to help with medical, social, spiritual and cul¬
tural problems."

China: the full treatment BYTINGHOR
Chinese doctors see illness as triggered by unbalanced relations between the organs and treat
the body as a whole rather than its constituent parts
In a Chinese hospital,
surgery is performed under
local anaesthetic induced by
acupuncture.
Doctors in modern Chinese hospitals
wear ties and white coats and look very
much like their Western counterparts. How¬
ever, the similarity stops there.
At the beginning of a consultation, a doc¬
tor takes your pulse in a special way, with
three fingers, and then carefully examines your
tongue. He will use imagery to describe his
diagnosis. "The wind and the cold have
attacked your lungs," he might say.
The medicines used are mostly extracted
from plants, but animal and mineral sub¬
stances are also prescribed. In this particular
case the purpose of the pharmaceutics will be
to "chase away the wind and the cold and add
some earth to produce gold."
In other cases, the doctor may order an
acupuncture session, or the application of burn¬
ing "sticks" of medicinal herbs (moxa treat¬
ment), or else Chinese massage to "unblock
the meridians". Other remedies include suction
cups, plasters and wires under the skin.
The notion ofbalance
Chinese medicine is as old as Chinese civiliza¬
tion itself but it was only established as a for¬
mal doctrine in the third century B.C. Its the¬
oretical basis, which has never changed since

then, springs from the Taoist principles of
yin and yang, the five movements, and qi.
Taoists use these terms to describe natural
phenomena. Thus day îsyang and night is yin.
The two are intertwined and blend to produce
a complete day. The whole universe works on
the same principle. When yin and yang are in
harmony, we feel well. When they are not, wc
feel ill. When they are separated, death ensues.
The aim of Chinese medicine is to restore
abalance, to harmonizeyin and yang through
the "five movements" represented by nature's
five most common elements, wood, fire, earth,
metal and water. Taoists have studied the rela¬
tionships between the five and devised a sys¬
tem of references enabling them to understand
the world, including all aspects of life.
A map of the body
In accordance with this system, doctors have
divided the body up into five kinds of func¬
tions, each represented by an "organ". Physi¬
ologically speaking, each function is the basis
of another one and is under the control of a
third. The lung, for example, is supported by
the spleen and is controlled by the liver. Illness
occurs when these links are disturbed. If the
spleen does not give the lung sufficient sup¬
port, the lung becomes diseased. Hence the
spleen has to be stimulated so it supports the
lung properly again, making treatment more
effective. This is why, in the example men¬
tioned above, the doctors decided to "add
earth (the spleen) to produce gold (the lung)."
But how do you "add earth" ? The answer is
through qi, one of Taoism's most metaphysical

concepts. In modern Chinese, the word means
"air", but Taoists use it to explain particular nat¬
ural or social tendencies. To Chinese doctors, it
means, broadly speaking, a function. Certain
plants or animal or mineral products have the
ability to improve the qi of certain organs. Qi
also tells the doctor, through the pulse, the state
of each organ (depending on whether the pulse
is strong, weak, fluid, delicate, noisy, etc.). The
appearance of the tongue is also qi "speaking" to
the doctor. And it is qi which travels around all
the body's "meridians".
Meridians pass right through the entire
body and connect the inner organs to the sur¬
face. There are fourteen main ones, with 360
points of contact with the skin from inside the
body. By stimulating the meridians, e.g. with
needles, or with "burning" moxa herbs or by
massaging the contact points, qi can be
adjusted to re-establish the balance of the
body's yin and yang.
All imbalances are due to a "change of cli¬
mate" brought about either by one of the six
"external causes" (wind, cold, heat, humid¬
ity, drought and fire) or by one of the six
"internal" ones (happiness, anger, sadness, anx¬
iety, obsession and terror). There arc other
causes which do not fit into either category,
such as unhealthy life-styles or accidents.

Chinese doctors do not try to make an in-
depth diagnosis of a part of the body. They
make an overall prognosis and treat the patient
as a whole. They do not treat a specific com¬
plaint, such as an ulcer, but the entire body.
The biological mechanism involved in such
therapy has not been clearly established. Some
think doctors encourage patients to cure them¬
selves. Others believe the immuno-defence sys¬
tem is activated. Be that as it may, the strategy
of helping "good" qi to chase away "bad" qi
avoids aggression against the body and mini¬
mizes side-effects, and it is this that has helped
to make Chinese medicine popular in the West.
Question marks
Is it scientific? "Cold" and "wind" cannot be
seen under a microscope, and there is no scien¬
tific way of measuring qi. Thus, although
researchers have found "traces" of meridians in
the laboratory, Western doctors do not consider
Chinese medicine as being scientific. On the
other hand, some Chinese doctors claim that
modern methods of scientific investigation arc
still too limited and rudimentary to detect the
basic principles applied in Chinese medicine.
But the aim of medicine is not the same as the

aim of science. Therapy is first and foremost
the art of healing. If something works, you do
not need to know the reason why.
Is it better than other systems of medi¬
cine? Like them, it is more effective in some
instances than others. Its global approach helps
in treating psychosomatic illnesses and chronic
or functional diseases, for example. Acupunc¬
ture works with sporting injuries. But Chinese
medicine is not so good when it comes to
emergencies or acute conditions. It is not magic
or universal it is not a panacea, in fact.
What of orthodoxy? The apparent ortho¬
doxy of natural medicines is an illusion of
which we should be wary. In Chinese medicine,
as in other areas, there are fashions, fads and
trends. A search for traditional remedies at all
costs leads to bigotry and superstition. The
spirit of the ancient wisdom should certainly
be preserved, but the world is a changing place.
When practised outside China, Chinese med¬
icine encounters new circumstances, new aims
and a different range of drugs. Even in China,
people from the north are not treated med¬
ically in the same way as people from the
south. The best way to grasp the most subtle,
traditional and authentic aspects of Chinese
medicine is to understand that its essence is
its ability to adapt.

MEDICINAL PLANTS IN ASIA
(APINMAP)
The Asian Pacific Information Network on Medicinal and Aromatic
Plants (APINMAP), which was set up in 1987 with Unesco support,
is an extremely useful data base in a region where traditional medicine
and pharmaceutics are of great importance.
APINMAP helps its 14 member countries (Australia, the Peo¬
ple's Republic of China, the Republic of Korea, India, Indonesia,
Malaysia, Nepal, Pakistan, Papua New Guinea, the Philippines, Sri
Lanka, Thailand, Turkey and Viet Nam) to improve their ability to col¬
lect, process and use research data on medicinal and aromatic plants.
Its data base contains some 14,200 entries.
It has joined forces with the Canadian International Develop¬
ment Research Centre to produce a CD-Rom on health developments
in Asia, which will help to promote Asian traditional medicine around
the world.

SPOTLIGHT
ON TRADITIONAL AND FOLK
MEDICINE
Unesco is supporting the publication of a catalogue designed to
make Asia's traditional and folk medicine more widely known and
help further research in the fields of pharmacology and plant medi¬
cine. The project is being carried out in co-operation with the Repub¬
lic of Korea and U nesco's Regional Network for the Chemistry of Nat¬
ural Products in Southeast Asia. It is being implemented by the
Unesco office in Jakarta (Indonesia).
The first volume of the catalogue was published in 1996 under
the title International Collation of Traditional and Folk Medicine,
Northeast Asia, Part I. Covering Korea, China, Japan and Hong Kong,
it identifies and studies the active agents in 200 medicinal plant
species. Volumes II (published in 1997) and III (in preparation) are a
continuation of Volume I and each include 200 plant species. The final
two volumes will cover not only plants but fungi, seaweed and ani¬
mal and mineral resources.

WHO SUPPORT
FOR TRADITIONAL MEDICINE
Despite the increase in international trade in herbal medicines and other types of alternative
medicine, the potential of traditional medicine is far from being fully utilized in most national
health systems.
Many elements of traditional medicine are beneficial, but others are not. The World Health
Organization (WHO) encourages and supports countries' efforts to find safe and effective
remedies and practices for use in health services while not endorsing all forms of traditional^
medicine.
Most of the population in developing countries still rely mainly on traditional practi¬
tioners and local medicinal plants for primary health care, and interest in traditional and alter¬
native systems of medicine has grown in industrialized countries during the last decade. In
the United States it is estimated that one-third of the population uses at least some form
of alternative treatment such as herbal medicines, acupuncture, chiropractic and home¬
opathy. Surveys in European countries have shown similar interest: 60% of the Dutch and
Belgian public have expressed their willingness to pay extra health insurance for alternative
medicine, and 74% of the British public favour complementary medicine being available on the
national health service.
Herbal medicines have existed for many centuries, but only a relatively small number of
plant speciesabout 5,000have been studied for their possible medical applications.
Safety and efficacy data exist only in respect of a much smaller number of plants, their extracts
and their active ingredients. The establishment and use of regulation procedures and quality
control have become major concerns in both developing and industrialized countries.
Acupuncture is used worldwide because of the simplicity of Its application, its minimal
side-effects and its low cost. It has been in constant use in China for thousands of years,
and spread to other oriental countries long ago. By 1990, 62,000 of Europe's 88,000
acupuncturists were medical doctors, and acupuncture users totalled 20 million. Consumer
surveys consistently show positive public attitudes to complementary medicine90% of
the pain clinics in the United Kingdom and 77% in Germany use acupuncture.
There are 19 WHO collaborating centres for traditional medicine, 8 of which are involved
in training and research on acupuncture, while the others are conducting research on herbal
medicines. These centres have made a major contribution to the international standardiza¬
tion of herbal medicines and acupuncture, and to the exchange of information.
In China, where traditional medicine is widely practised, each province has a college and
a research institute for Chinese traditional medicine. In India, the government provides finan¬
cial research and development support for the Ayurvedic and Unani systems and their
increasing involvement in the delivery of health services. Such systems are seen as allies in
the delivery of primary health care. Research institutes and foundations have also been estab¬
lished in industrialized countries, such as the Office of Alternative Medicine in the United
States. A group set up by the European Commission is investigating the therapeutic sig¬
nificance of unconventional medicine, its cost-benefit ratio and its sociocultural importance
as a basis for the evaluation of its possible use in public health.
WHO strongly supports the further promotion and development of the rational use of
traditional medicine throughout the world.

AN INTERNATIONAL
CONFERENCE
"Culture and Health" was the yearly theme chosen for the World
Decade for Cultural Development (1988-1997) in 1996, and In May
of that year Unesco and WHO held an international conference on the
subject at Chiang Rai (Thailand).
The Conference drew attention to the dangers implicit in the
body-mind dichotomy in the medical context and put the debate
between traditional and modern medicine in a broader perspective. It
stressed the need to reconcile the two approaches in the treatment
of illness and to explore a number of issues including the use and
"modernization" of traditional medical practices, endogenous devel¬
opment of community health care for self-reliance, the use of herbal
remedies, and the study of indigenous food habits and traditional
lifestyles in different cultures.
Attention was also drawn to the importance of non-physical
factors in health and healing. Health should not be divorced from the
social and cultural context. It is now known, for example, that peo¬
ple who live alone and suffer from loneliness tend to live up to ten
years less than those who have close personal relationships.
The proceedings of the conference will be published in 1998,
together with a booklet for the general public. U nesco and WHO were
also urged to organize an international conference on "Culture, Ethics
and Health".

the over-65 population is projected to increase globally by 82%.
4. For every baby born today in an industrialized country, there are ten people aged
65 or over. By the year 2020 there will be 15 such elderly persons for each new¬
born child. In developing countries, the ratio today is 2 people over 65 for every
newborn child, and 4 for every newborn child by 2020.
5. Life expectancy at birth was 48 years in 1955; 59 years in 1975; and 65 years
in 1995.
6. In 1960, most deaths were among people under 50. Today, most are among
the over-50s.
7. By 2025, more than 60% of all deaths will be among the over-65s, and more
than 40% among over-75s.
Infant and child health
8. Deaths among children under 5 years declined from 19 million in 1960 to 11

10. Coverage of children immunized against 6 major childhood diseases increased
from 5% in 1974 to 80% in 1995.
Causes of death
11. Of over 52 million deaths in 1996, over 17 million were due to infectious or
parasitic diseases, more than 15 million to circulatory diseases, over 6 million to
cancers and about 3 million to respiratory diseases.
12. Of over 52 million deaths in 1996, 40 million were in developing countries,
including almost 9 million in the least developed countries.
Infectious diseases
13. The leading killer among infectious diseases in 1996 was acute lower respi¬
ratory infection, which killed 3.9 million people.
14. Tuberculosis killed 3 million people in 1996.
15. DIarrhoeal diseases killed 2.5 million people In 1996.
16. Malaria killed between 1.5 million and 2.7 million people in 1996.
17. About 1.5 million people died of HIV/Aids in 1996.
18. Worldwide, 75-85% of HIV infections in adults have been transmitted through
unprotected sexual intercourse, with heterosexual intercourse accounting for more
than 70%.
19. Leprosy registered prevalence cases fell from 2.3 to 1.7 per 10,000 popula¬
tion between 1995 and 1996, and the problem has been reduced by 82% world¬
wide in the last 11 years.
20. The Onchocerciasis Control Programme which began in West Africa in 1974
has now protected an estimated 36 million people from the disease.
21. More than 120 million children under 5 in India were immunized against
poliomyelitis in a single day in 1996.

reduce childhood deaths from malaria by up to 35%.
Noncommunicable diseases
23. Tobacco is calculated to cause 3 million deaths a year mainly from lung can¬
cer and circulatory diseases.
Cancer
24. About half of the more than 6 million deaths from cancer in 1996 were due
to cancers of the lung, stomach, colon-rectum, liver and breast.
25. Smoking accounts for one in 7 cancer deaths worldwide.
Mental disorders
26. An estimated 45 million people are affected by schizophrenia. There were 4.5
million new cases of schizophrenia and other delusional disorders in 1996.
27. An estimated 28 million people worldwide incur significant health risks by using
pyschoactive substances other than alcohol, tobacco and volatile solvents.
Occupational health
28. Occupational accidents account for more than 120 million injuries and at least
220,000 deaths a year.
29. There are about 160 million cases a year of occupational diseases, of which
30-40% may lead to chronic disease and 10% to permanent work disability.
30. Only 5-10% of workers in developing countries, and 20-50% in industrialized
countries, have access to adequate occupational health services.

commentary Federico Mayor
Africa and
the world
"Universal peace will one day come about not because
human beings will become better (that is too much to hope
for), but because a new order of things, new science and
new economic needs will force peace upon us". These
prophetic words were written by Anatole France. This new
order of things and the new science and new economic
needs he announced have now come to pass. If war is still
raging in many corners of the earth, it is because most peo¬
ple have not yet grasped this changing situation.
It might have been thought that the end of the cold war
would have liberated resources from which development
and peace would have benefitted. However, such transfers
have been few. It might have been thought that the glob¬
alization of communication, which has turned the planet
into a single community a village, it is said would have
broadened the sense of unity and, by abolishing distance,
would have ipso facto created global solidarity. Nothing
could be further from the truth.
Paradoxically, peace has never been more threatened
than it is at present. The reshaping of geo-strategic interests
and the emergence of new, less tangible types of risk have
given rise everywhere to a wait-and-see attitude, and indeed
to mistrust and withdrawal. As interdependence increases
and extends beyond economics and finance to include social
life and the environment, new divisions are appearing
both between states and within national communities.
Poverty and exclusion are growing. Rather than broaden¬
ing our horizons, the change in our relationship with things
both far and near either makes us lose all our bearings or
else withdraw dangerously into ourselves. What Bill Gates
blithely calls "friction-free capitalism" is clearly liable to
increase marginalization and inequality.
36
I am not blaming the process of globalization, which in
many respects liberalizes and even liberates, and forges
new ties. Globalization is neither good nor bad. It is what the
human community makes of it further proof that good for¬
tune smiles on the rich, the selfish and the cynical, or else
a sign that justice, dignity and solidarity have not entirely
disappeared from the face of the earth. It can be a great
opportunity or a great danger. Like knowledge, it is neutral
by nature and takes on meaning and value from the way it
is used.
There is only one world, yet there are so many differ¬
ences, such lack of symmetry, so many contrasts. The gap
between rich and poor in this "smaller" world is constantly
widening. In what we coyly describe as the "least developed
countries", and especially in Africa, poverty is growing
worse. Their share of world trade is still tiny. In some cases,
economic marginalization goes hand-in-hand with social dis¬
integration, spiralling violence and increases in armed con¬
flicts, and sometimes countries lapse into fraudulent prac¬
tices. Other countries, on the other hand, have developed
political and economic capacities which open up new pos¬
sibilities in their relations with foreign partners.
There are therefore countless situations and very dif¬
ferent levels of development. However, the economies of the
developing countries, where three-quarters of the world's
population live, account for less than 10 per cent of gross
world product. Africa which is certainly not lacking in
resources accounts for less than 3 per cent of this gross
product and its share of world trade is less than 2 per cent.
The international economic context accordingly continues
to be characterized by enormous disparities that are fraught
with risk and conflict. These disparities seem to grow even

Park are victims of

r The winding ochre-coloured
dirt road runs for several
kilometres between two walls oftall
golden grass broken by occasional
burnt clearings. A hornbill takes
off in flight. A family of warthogs
ambles by. This is the vast Niokolo-
Koba National Park, created in
Senegal in 1926 and one of the first
in Africa. The 913,000-hectare
park, the central part of which is
completely protected, is adminis¬
tered under the programme for the
management of the Upper Niger
and Gambia river valleys.
The importance of Niokolo-
Koba, which contains exception¬
ally rich animal life, came to be
seen when it was classified as a
UNESCO biosphere reserve and a
World Heritage natural site in
1981. It receives some 3,000 visi¬
tors a year and, with the neigh¬
bouring park at Badiar in Guinea,
will soon form a large transnational
biosphere reserve.
SIMENTI POOL
At Simenti, in the middle of the
park, there is a hotel, a camp for
game wardens and a viewing plat¬
form overlooking the wide, muddy
Gambia river, which flows lazily
between stands of bamboo linked
to giant trees by tangles of flower¬
ing creepers. A troop of green mon¬
keys scamper about in them. Fur¬
ther away, on a sand spit, are a fish
eagle and a herd of guib (tragela-
phus), a species of harnessed ante¬
lope with a white-spotted or
striped coat.
The pool at Simenti a natural
depression of stagnant water
formed at a bend in the river is
replenished in the dry season by
pumping. A large number of ani¬
mals go there to drink. During the
dry season the last traces of green¬
ery are also to be found there.
From the viewing platform, all
kinds of antelopes (giant or Derby
eland, roan antelope, Buffon's kob
and Defassa waterbuck), warthogs
and aquatic birds can be seen. The
common enemy here is mimosa
pigru, a prickly thorn bush which
is slowly encroaching on the grass
on which the animals live. Ele¬
phants, lions and panthers also
roam the park. Unfortunately,
poaching is widespread. Shortly
before I arrived, the game wardens
had rescued a pair of baby pan¬
thers whose mother had been shot.
They are now living in captivity at
the camp, but lack of funds means
they have to feed on a diet of only
one goat every three days!
OPEN AND
LATENT WARFARE
Poachers keep the 150 game war¬
dens on a war footing. Already
eight wardens have been shot dead
and five others wounded. Three
soldiers have also been killed. The
day we were leaving, poachers were
reported nearby. How did the
game wardens spot them in the
dense vegetation? They found
bicycle tyre marks in the ashes of
a clearing where a fire had been
lit to help the pasture to grow
back. Hunters, who spend months
at a time in very remote areas,
obtain water and food from vil¬
lagers who travel around on bicy¬
cles and in return take back
slaughtered game to their villages.
The poachers are better armed
than the game wardens. More than
93 per cent of the wardens are also
due to retire in 2002, which wor¬
ries Lieutenant Boucar Ndiaye.
Unless new ones are engaged, there
will only be ten wardens to watch
over almost a million hectares.
Money is a big problem. The war¬
dens have only three vehicles with
badly worn tyres, no radios and not
even a chainsaw.
The situation is the same on the
Guiñean side. Fifty game wardens

also new, is gradually losing all its
wildlife to hunting by people from
nearby villages, many ofwhom have
kept the weapons which the late
dictator Ahmed Sékou Touré dis¬
tributed to people's militias.
BITTERN ESS AND POVERTY
The biggest enemy of conservation
efforts in both Senegal and Guinea
is poverty. IIow can you tell a man
whose children are hungry that he
must not kill the antelope or
guinea fowl he comes across?
When the Niokolo park was
created, five villages inside its
boundaries were moved fifty kilo¬
metres away. The villagers are still
bitter about this. In the park, the
soil was richer, the yield from
orchards was at its peak and hunt¬
ing flourished. They had to leave
their ancestral cemeteries behind

village shrine is now in ruins and is
being slowly engulfed by a giant
kapok tree.
Abdourahmane Samoura, head
of a United States-funded natural
resources management project, is
aware of the problem. "We now
have to make up for past mis¬
takes," he says. But how? "We
can't bring the villagers back," says
Lieutenant Ndiaye. "If we did, in
less than two years there wouldn't
be a single animal left in the park."
MICRO-PROJECTS AND
DEVELOPMENT
A considerable effort is being made
in both Senegal and Guinea to
develop micro-projects in villages
on the edge of the parks in a bid to
compensate for the frustration of
the inhabitants. This includes rais
ing guinea-fowl, fish farming, bee¬
keeping, market gardening, seed
production and the setting up of
nurseries. OusmaneandMariam are
two young agronomists responsible
for convincing the villagers, whose
language they speak, of the need
for these projects. They are not try¬
ing to impose ready-made solutions
but listen instead to what people
want and then try to find a way of
delivering it.
Beekeeping creates jobs. Car¬
penters are needed to build the
hives, blacksmiths to produce
smokers, tailors to make special
clothing. The honey can also save

of honey and water, can replace
the popular alcoholic drink made
from the sap of these 20-metre-

nation laid down within Unesco's "Man and the Biosphere" (MAB) Programme. They combine three
functions:
«"safeguarding samples of the earth's landscapes, plant and animal species and ecosystems;
«-fostering economic development that is ecologically and culturally sustainable;
support for research, monitoring, training and education relating to local, regional
and global conservation issues.
The reserves form a world network within which information, experience and personnel are
exchanged. They contribute to meeting the objectives of the Convention on Biological Diversity
and the Agenda 21 Programme that resulted from the 1992 United Nations Conference on Envi¬
ronment and Development held in Rio de Janeiro.
HOW ARE THEY ORGANIZED?
A core area needs to be legally established and ensure long-term protection for the landscape,
ecosystem and species it contains.
The limits of a buffer zone around the core must be clearly demarcated. Human activities in this
a rea should not run counter to the conservation objectives of the core area. This may be an area
for experimental research into appropriate methods of managing the ecosystem.
A transition area, or area of co-operation, extends outwards from the reserve. It is here that local
communities and other stakeholders must agree to work together to manage and develop the area's
resources on a sustainable basis.
For fuller details, see "The world network of biosphere reserves" in the May 1997
issue of the Unesco Courier, Landscape with Figures (pp. 36-37).
includes the dry forest of Fathala,
which has splendid trees but little
animal life. Its manager, Major
Jacques Rigoulot, who was already
in charge of the area before the
Senegalese army took it over as a
training ground, has been recalled
to carry out an almost impossible
mission. His task is to rebuild the
burned-down camp, close the
twenty sawmills-cum-woodwork
factories in the area and set up
partnerships with the villages on
the edge of the reserve.
The taxes levied on gathering
dead wood have earned the villages
a million CFA francs ($1,700) in
ten months a lot of money in
Senegal which paid for improve¬
ments in water supply, schools and
clinics. But Rigoulot is bitter.
There is no longer a drop of drink¬
ing water in the reserve since its
single well was contaminated by
sea water, and he has no money to
dig another one. He also badly
needs solar panels to provide
energy for lighting.
However, the results of work¬
ing with the local communities
have been very positive. In the vil¬
lage of Bakadadji, inside the
reserve, Rigoulot helps women to
harvest oysters, whose roasted
shells make good-quality bricks.
Like his opposite number at
Samba Dia, Abdul Diallo, he (and
the village women) could do with
some kind of transport a boat,
for example, since four-fifths of
the reserve consists of mangroves,
inlets and islands.
On the edge of the reserve, just
as at Niokolo, vast areas some¬
times whole islands, which are the
homes of birds have been leased
to foreigners. The local population
derives no benefit from this , except
in the form of payment for guides.
Lieutenant Ndiaye says that if the
villagers were the only people
allowed to hunt, poaching would
certainly be reduced. But defend¬
ing nature is an uphill job that is
made even harder by lack of
resources. This makes the deter¬
mination of Boucar Ndiaye, Abdul
Diallo and Jacques Rigoulot all
the more impressive. I

ELVIEJO
THE TORNADO-MAKER
After studying 35,000 tornadoes
that have hit the United States
since 1950, two researchers have
discovered a direct link between
tornadoes and a cold Pacific cur¬
rent known as El Viejo or La Niña,
the opposite of the better-known
warm El Niño. When the waters off
Peru cool by only Io Fahrenheit
(5/9 of a degree Celsius) com¬
pared with their average temper¬
ature, El Viejo sets in motion a jet
stream pattern that carries moist
air from the Gulf of Mexico to the
Ohio Valley, where it clashes with
cold air from Canada and triggers
off tornadoes.
According to the two resear¬
chers, the probability of having four
or more springtime tornadoes in
the area ranging from Michigan
to Alabama increases by 300 to
500 per cent when El Viejo is
active in the Pacific in the previ¬
ous winter. They also discovered
that when El Niño warms the
waters of the Pacific off South
America, there is a significant
reduction in tornado activity in the
states of Texas, Louisiana, Okla¬
homa, Kansas and Arkansas-
known as "tornado alley".
AMPHIBIAN SOS
Frogs, toads and salamanders are
vanishing from all parts of the
globe. Not only are these very com¬
mon amphibians victims of the dry¬
ing-out of wetlands and the intro¬
duction of alien predators, they are
also on the decline in protected
areas. What is more, growing num
bers of congenital malformations
are found in all three groups.
Researchers suspect factors such
as acid rain, ultraviolet-B radiation,
which now penetrates the depleted
ozone layer more easily, and pes¬
ticides. More than 500 teams of
scientists all over the world are
working flat out to understand what
the frogs are trying to tell us, before
it is too late.
HOT TIP
When public services in Dhaka
(Bangladesh) could no longer pro¬
vide satisfactory waste collection
facilities, two volunteers from the
Kalagaban district, where the
problem was particularly acute,
began offering a parallel service in
return for a small financial contri¬
bution from the households
served. Rickshaw van-drivers sort
the waste for bones, polythene
bags, paper, plastics and metals,
then sell what they collect to rele¬
vant industries, thereby adding a
little extra to their monthly pay-
packets. Women are prominent in
the system's smooth running and
usually deposit the waste directly
into the collection vans.
THE ENVIRONMENT
ON CD-ROM
A French ecology association has
produced a CD-Rom for all those
interested in environmental
issues. It contains 3,000 pages of
information summarizing thou¬
sands of books, as well as 2,500
Web sites that are indexed accord¬
ing to key words (80% of them in
English).

RENT-A-RUG
An American carpet manufacturer
offers his customers the chance
of leasing a carpet by the month.
The company assists in choosing
the carpet, laying it, maintaining
it and finally removing it for recy¬
cling. Ground up into a powder, old
carpets are used as a backing for
making new ones. For manufac¬
turers, the system has the advan¬
tage of saving non-renewable
resources and making their prod¬
ucts last, thereby limiting waste
and pollution.
OLD BATTERIES
DON'T JUST FADE AWAY
In Gambia, discarded worn-out bat¬
teries are extremely dangerous,
especially to children. In order to
counter this danger, the authori¬
ties in Banjul, the capital, have
placed metal containers at strate¬
gic points for use by the general
public. This initiative was sug¬
gested by a woman living in the
suburb of Kololi, who asked
schoolchildren to bring her bat¬
teries in return for a small sum of
money. She stored the batteries
at her home until a suitable dump
could be set up.
CORRUGATED
SHEETING
A factory near Cotonou (Benin) will
soon be producing plant-derived
polyol in order to make corrugated
sheeting. Polyol is usually a deriv¬
ative of oil and goes into the pro¬
duction of a common plastic,
Polyurethane. In this case the oil
will be replaced by locally-pro¬
duced palm, cotton and shea oils.
Since all corrugated sheeting is
at present imported, this new
product should prove beneficial to
Benin's economy. Unfortunately,
although it is more durable, it will
cost twice as much as ordinary
corrugated metal sheeting.

music from
South African traditional popular music has ta ken the international music scene by storm
These days South African music is known all
over the world. It emerged on the interna¬
tional scene at the end of the 1960s with Myriam
Makeba and Hugh Masakela and really took off
after apartheid was abolished.
Now we have the wonderful sounds of Joseph
Shabalala's a cappella Ladysmith Black Mambazo
group, Mahlathini and the vivacious Mahotella
Queens, the lively jazz of Dollar Brand, Chris
McGregor, Dudu Pukwana, Jonas Gwangwa and
Bheki Mseleku, as well as the dynamic multiracial
group Juluka, led by Johnny Clegg and Sipho
Mchunu.
Influenced by gospel and soul music, the
ancient indigenous choral traditions especially
among the Zulu and the Xhosa developed rich
vocal harmonies which are the basis of the coun¬
try's modern popular music.
The black townships artificial ghettos swollen
by migrants from the countryside who were forcibly
resettled under apartheid are especially fertile
ground for musicians. Soweto, for example, is one
of the most lively musical centres in the country,
where the mbaqanga, a combination of South
African rhythms, jazz, soul and old European tunes,
with a throbbing bass sound, is still very popular.
The Africa Cultural Centre
Last summer, the Musiques de Nuit festival in
France invited nineteen young musicians, dancers
and artists from Johannesburg's Africa Cultural
Centre to come and run workshops for teenagers
in various suburbs of Bordeaux. They also orga¬
nized discussion groups on philosophical and
humanistic subjects.
The Centre, a lively cultural spot and symbol
of liberated Africa, was founded in the 1980s in the
west Johannesburg suburb of Newton Bay by
Benjy Francis, a man of the theatre who was born
in a Durban township in the year apartheid was offi¬
cially introduced. Since the end of the 1970s, he
has been the standard-bearer of rebellious black
culture, along with others like the producer Bar¬
ney Simon. After the Soweto massacre of 1976,
Francis decided "to give the struggle another
dimension with new cultural projects."
With limited resources, he founded the Mar
ket Theatre, which started out in the street before
becoming what is now the Centre a few years later.
It was shut down several times by the authorities,
but survived thanks to the perseverance of Fran¬
cis and to funding by progressive organizations.
Its repertoire was then expanded to include other
disciplines and several artists gave their time freely.
In 1980, Francis opened an artists' centre to
encourage exchanges between various forms of
expression, and the Africa Cultural Centre grew
out of this initiative. A repertoire of South African
plays was put together, notably Duzaka's Night of
the Long Wake.
The Centre is well known in Johannesburg but
also organizes courses and workshops in other
towns, teaching music, dance (traditional and hip-
hop), percussion, drama and the plastic arts. The
aim, says Francis, a colourful figure with a beard
and a beret, is "to channel young people's energies
towards artistic expression which can free them. We
are offering our approach and we are ready to
learn as well. We don't close our doors, we don't
commercialize and we don't downsize our dreams."
Citing the example of Nelson Mandela, Francis
opts for dialogue rather than confrontation, for
tolerance and openness rather than revenge and
hostility. Two years ago, the Centre staged Africus,
the continent's first biennial modern art exhibi¬
tion, on the theme of "Let's decolonize our Minds".
In 1994, the Centre opened its Children's
Museum, which will soon have a scientific section
and a library. The Centre has also welcomed per¬
formers such as Whitney Houston and organized a
children's parade ("Heal Humanity") aimed at
encouraging young people's creativity. Francis is
likewise planning to launch a social awareness
project, to look at problems like battered children,
poverty, hunger and teenage pregnancy.
Last autumn, the Cité de la Musique in Paris
welcomed some other South African musicians,
who also displayed the country's cultural rich¬
ness and diversity. They included the Nzalabantu
Choir, a physically striking group of traditional
female singers from Kwazulu Natal who usually
perform at initiation rites, marriages and village
festivals. There was also the diva Sibongile Khu-
malo, who comes from the same part of the coun-

blends the lyrical with traditional Zulu chants.
There was also a troupe of ingoma dancers (the
Lamontville Group) and the Shukuma Black Mam-
bazo All Star Flutes.
Choirs, dances and penny whistles
On Sundays, ingoma, a collection of dances that
takes its name from a drum, is put on by Zulu min¬
ers living in the mine hostels. The songs and
dances, which hark back to those of ancestral war¬
riors and are warlike and initiatory, are performed
to the accompaniment of a large drum made of a
double cowhide stretched over a metal oil drum.
Lamontville, after the name of a Durban town¬
ship, is a group of young dancers who keep alive
the famous gumboot dance beloved of Zulu work
ers during their leisure lime. The dancers wear
rubber boots adorned with tinkling bottle caps
which they slap with their hands. The rhythm of the
steps, the hand-slapping and the shouts and exhor¬
tations of the group's leader are the only musical
accompaniment.
The Shukuma Black Mambazo All-Star Flutes,
which blossomed in the Johannesburg township
of Alexandra between 1956 and 1963, came
together again specially for the Paris concert. With
acoustic guitars and penny whistles, they recréale
the sound of the kivela groups. Kivela! in Zulu
means "scram!" and is used to warn that the police
are coming. This musical style, popular in the
1910s and 1950s, is a street version of township
jazz. It has gathered other instruments along the
way, such as the saxophone, electric guitar, bass
and piano, and influenced many performers,
including Myriam Makcba. I

The gold and silver age of
ANSKÂ STIAVNICA

t^S. MLVCAR1
The old town of Banská Stiavnica,
in the heart of the Carpathian mountains, was
once a nucleus of the European mining industry.
Its remarkable architectural and technological
monuments earned it a place on the World
Heritage List in 1993.
Why visit an old mining
I town? I imagined houses
lined up in rows like matchboxes,
a handful of dull office buildings,
a soulless school, an unexceptional
church and a few scrawny dogs.
Emile Zola came to mind. What
was the point? Slovakia, a moun¬
tainous country covering 49,000
square kilometres in the heart of
Central Europe, has more than 1 50
medieval fortresses, Romanesque
chapels and Gothic cathedrals,
Renaissance palaces and Baroque
residences; I was much more inter¬
ested in these. Yet when I finally
made up my mind to head down a
road winding through forests and
between emerald-green lakes, I
was completely taken aback when
I suddenly beheld a little archi¬
tectural jewel cradled in the hills.
This was the once-flourishing town
of ISanská Stiavnica.
Legend has it that a goatherd
guarding his flock one day saw a
lizard covered in flakes of gold
and immediately spread the news
of this extraordinary sight. At
that time the local people lacked
the technical skills and resources
necessary for extracting the gold
and silver buried deep in the,
mountain, and the mines, some of
which were on the surface, were
probably first worked by the Celts
a century or two before the mod¬
ern era. The Celts even minted
coins known as biatecs, weighing
16 grams each. A large number of
these have been found at some fif¬
teen sites, especially in the coun¬
try's western regions. The Slavs,
who arrived in the region later,
continued extracting the precious
metals and traded in them.
A twelfth-century document
shows that the Banská Stiavnica
region, in Slovakia's heartland,
was known as the "land of min¬
ers". After having settled in the
Carpathian Mountains for over a
century, the Hungarians incorpo¬
rated Banská Stiavnica into then-
kingdom, which eventually
extended to the shores of the
Adriatic. They were quick to
grasp the benefits they could reap
from mining the rich veins of gold,
silver and copper that stretched
for kilometre after kilometre.
In order to work the mines
intensively, they brought in Ger¬
man settlers, whose expertise in
the field was famed throughout
Europe. To make sure they
stayed, King Bela IV allowed
them a series of privileges, espe¬
cially the freedom to trade, which
he set out in 1238 in a special
charter granted to Banská. A few
years later, when the area was dev¬
astated by the Mongols, the Ger¬
man and Slovak inhabitants were
given permission to build fortifi¬
cations to protect themselves from
future attack. Mindful of their

Banská Stiavnica

mining town. own interests, the Hungarian
rulers built a fortified enclave for
themselves in the upper part of
the town, the remains of which
are still visible today. It was here
that they collected taxes and
received their due share of the
proceeds from mining.
PIONEERING
TECHNOLOGY
By the Middle Ages Banská
Stiavnica was producing 20 per
cent of the sih er circulating on the
world market, as well as large
quantities of gold for export to var¬
ious parts of Europe, especially
Germany and Flanders. Two cities
further north, Gremnica and Ban¬
ska Bystrica, also rich in precious
metals, flourished at the same
time. Growing ever richer, the Ger¬
man colonists and the Hungarian
nobility began building Catholic
and Protestant churches and
stately palaces and mansions that
were the glory of the kingdom.
After the Battle of Mohaes in
1526 in which the Magyar army
was defeated, the Turks occupied
Buda and began making armed
forays into the interior of Slova¬
kia, then known as Upper Hun¬
gary. Even so, they were never able
to lay their hands on the gold and
silver mines. With support from
the forces of Count Nicholas
Pallfy, the inhabitants of Banská
Stiavnica succeeded in repelling
the foreign invaders in 1593 only
a few kilometres from the town.
In 1627, explosives were used
(for the first time for such a pur¬
pose in Europe) to extract ore from
the mountain. In the seventeenth
century two local engineers per¬
fected a mechanical pumping sys¬
tem which improved the silver
extraction process by creating some
sixty artificial lakes to drain off the
water that was forever threatening
to flood the mines. About twenty of
them still exist, and the Slovaks
bathe in them during the summer
months. In the eighteenth century
Banská Stiavnica became the Euro¬
pean centre of mining technology
and expertise. In 1762, Maria
Theresa, Empress of Austria and
Queen of Hungary, founded a Min¬
ing Academy there. The first of its
kind in the world, it attracted cel¬
ebrated teachers from all over
Europe. One of the founders of
modern chemistry, Antoine Lau¬
rent de Lavoisier, gave it his sup¬
port. The Academy's reputation
was such that it served as a model
for the Ecole Polytechnique in
Paris.
However, by the end of the nine¬
teenth century the mines were no
longer profitable. Today there are
a mere 10,600 people living in Ban¬
ská Stiavnica, and only a few of the
region's slender gold and silver veins
are still mined. Despite wars,

earthquakes and (ires, the town's
prestigious past largely survives
in the monuments and buildings
that were erected over the cen¬
turies. These form an architec¬
tural complex that is a blend of
the Romanesque, Gothic, Renais¬
sance, Baroque and Neo-classical.
Every community Slovak, Ger¬
man and Hungarian has added
its contribution, making Banská

This blend is perhaps one of the
reasons w hy it is not easy for people
to find their way around the tow n's
steep, winding maze of streets. The
only easily identifiable landmark is
Trinity Square (Namestie s v. Tro-
j ice) in the heart of the city. Boast¬
ing a quadruple eighteenth-cen¬
tury Baroque colonnade sculpted
by Italian artist Dionyz Stanctti, it
was built in memory of the plague
victims of 1710 and 1711. Similar
colonnades, of varying degrees of
quality, exist in several other Slovak
cities.
Gothic or Renaissance style
houses stand on either side of the
triangular square that slopes
steeply down to the old low n hall.
At number 12 a modern art
gallery bears the name of the
painter JozefKollár (1899-1982),
who was horn and died in Banská
Stiavnica. His works are impres¬
sionistic in style, and apart from
his portraits he is best known for
his Z Povuzia ("Along the River
Vah") and Ziinmy trh v lianskeuj
Stiavnici ("The Winter Market in
Banská Stiavnica").
IN SEARCH
OF THE PAST
Two medieval churches 500
metres apart symbolize the exis¬
tence side by side of the town's
two communities. One is St.
Catherine's Church (Kostol sv
Katariny), also known as the Slo-
vakian church because mass was
celebrated there in the Slovak lan¬
guage from the seventeenth cen¬
tury onwards. The other is the
Church of the Blackfriars, once
known as the German Church.
Neo-gothie in style since its recon¬
struction at the end of the nine¬
teenth century, St. Catherine's
houses a polychrome wooden
sculpture of the Madonna dating
from 1506. The mortal remains
of wealthy Banská Stiavnica nota¬
bles and burghers lie in the crypt.
An ancient Roman basilica with
three naves, the Blackfriars
church was rebuilt in 1806 and
contains a remarkable nineteenth-
century organ.
The partly ruined Old Castle
(Stary zamok) is visible on the
heights above the town centre. It
is surrounded by sixteenth-cen¬
tury ramparts and was the enclave
of the Hungarian kings. Facing it
on another hill is the New Castle

part of a complex of fortifications

protect them from the Turks. It is
now the most interesting of the
town's historic buildings. The
whitewashed structure, endowed
with four bastions, is both mas¬
sive and elegant in appearance.
Several of its floors have been fit¬
ted out to house a museum
devoted to the region's history,
especially the struggles against
the Ottoman army. It also contains
many mementoes from the six¬
teenth and seventeenth centuries.
Other churches, chapels,
stately mansions, abandoned
mines and old, narrow paved
streets where motor traffic is pro¬
hibited confer a somewhat unreal
feeling on the centuries-old mining
town. Yet three thousand stu¬
dents a year attend its School of
Mining and Industry, which is
located in a park overlooking Trin¬
ity Square and is one of the best in
Central Europe. Between classes
the students can he seen strolling
through the nearby alleys lined
with houses and gardens, as if in
search of the past.
Vestiges
of an
industrial
past
Banská Stiavnica, Slovakia's oldest mining
town, lies on the steep slopes of the Glanzenberg
in the Paradajz Mountains.
Its ores have been worked since the Bronze
Age (lOth-Sth centuries B.C.) and mining only
ceased at the end of the 19th century.
The city and the technical plant in the
surrounding area illustrate a remarkable
symbiosis between the urban environment and
the natural habitat.
State-of-the-art technology
In the 17th century Banská Stiavnica saw a large
number of technological advances. Gunpowder
was used in the mines for the first time. In the
fi eld of hydraulic energy, a system of dams and
weirs was built in the 18th century to wash the
ore. This system was adopted all over the world
and remained the most advanced of its kind right
into the 19th century.
Reservoirs and dams
About 20 reservoirs have survived, the oldest of
which, Velkà Vodárenská, was built in 1510.
Three others date from the 16th century and two
more from the 17th century. Most of them were
built in the 18th century, a period of intense
mining activity in the town.
There is also a series of damsthe longest of
which is nearly 775 metres longand water-
collecting channels.
Factories and mines
Two remarkable drainage galleries still exist: the
Beiber, begun in the 14th century, is the oldest
known example of its kind. The Voznicka gallery,
which is over a kilometre long, was the world's
longest when it was inaugurated in 1878.
There are also several surface ore deposits.
The mine building and the Mayer machine room
(begun in 1805) are still standing.
Also still standing is a silver and lead smelting
plant which dates from the first half of the 17th
century and was modernized in 1872. It was one of
the buildings belonging to the world's first factory
producing machine-made metal cable (1837). Last
but not least, the mine museum houses a number of
items of equipment from the region.

interview Abbas Kiarostami
'Between
dreams
and reality"
How did you get into films?
Abbas Kiarostami: My roots were in graphic art; 1
branched out into cinema quite by chance. Graphic
art is a kind of minimalist art in which one has to
communicate an idea in a precise and agreeable
form using great economy of means. I learned to
live with the constraints of graphic art, and this
helped me to accept constraints in general and use
them in my films. My son wants to be a film-maker
but I have advised him to learn graphics first.
While I was a graphic artist, I started making
advertising films as well. In advertising films, you
have only thirty seconds or a minute to get a mes¬
sage across. You have to know your target audi¬
ence very well: you have to know how people act and
react: you have to know all about marketing. When
you have to condense a message into one short
minute, you learn what a minute really is. Making
advertising films gave me an opportunity to learn all
about film-making before getting into real cinema .
Today I do everything in my films: I write the script,
visualize the scenes with sketches, direct, supervise
the sound and its mixing, choose the music and
take care of the montage.
What are the possibilities of cinema?
A. K.: To my mind cinema offers greater possibili¬
ties for self-expression than any other art.
Absolutely anything can be depicted in cinema and
this is not really possible in the other arts. In a film
you can use silence or darkness, for instance, to
great effect. At the end of my latest film, The Taste
of Cherry, the central character, Mr. Badii, goes
down into a pit and lies down. The moon disap¬
pears behind clouds and everything fades into dark¬
ness. For a whole minute nothing is shown on the
screen. Life, cinema and light become one. With its
The work of Iranian film
director Abbas

1997 when his latest

Palm at the Cannes Film
Festival. Two years

Festival had organized a

for its imaginative range
and humanity. In this

magical power, cinema is a remarkable instrument
for stimulating wonder and casting doubt on the
most deeply rooted ideas.
Are there any images or ideas you are not
allowed to show when you make films in Iran?
A.K.: The kind of violent scenes that appear in
movies all over the world arc prohibited in the Iran¬
ian cinema, where it is also virtually impossible to
make any reference to sexuality. Wherever in the
world my films are set, I can never make any allusion
to sex in them.
In Iran, you cannot hold your wife's hand in the
street. In a movie, if a woman falls down in the
street, she can only be helped up by another woman
because touching is involved. And so if you see a
woman tumble in an Iranian film don't be shocked
if a man happens to he standing nearby but docs
nothing to help. It's not that he's unwilling to lift
the woman hack onto her feet but that he is not
supposed to do so. Don't he shocked if you see a
woman drowning in a swimming pool or a lake and
a man is standing around doing nothing. He's not
allowed to do anything. In real life maybe he would
step in, hut not in a movie. It's not that Iranian peo¬
ple are cold-blooded it's just a limitation imposed
on Iranian cinema. Don't be surprised if you see in
an Iranian film a woman wake up in bed wearing
her chudor. In real life this is absurd, but in the cin¬
ema women hav e to wear a chudor all the time. It
is forbidden to show dancing and drinking alco¬
hol but not smoking in the cinema.
To receive an exhibition permit in the 1980s, all
films had to go through a four-stage process involv¬
ing approval of the synopsis, script, cast and crew,
and the final film. The situation has not changed
much since then. Although political and social crit-

icism is not unknown in films, care is taken not to
displease the clerical establishment. Ironically, how¬
ever, prohibitions of this kind hav e helped the Iran¬
ian cinema to achieve success internationally because
it has always had to face the challenge of not show¬
ing certain things or finding inv entive ways of express¬
ing them. The pressure has slackened a little since
the new government took over recently and one hopes
that film-makers will now have more freedom.
Are Iranian films widely distributed outside Iran?
A.K.: I think Iranian cinema today is well placed
internationally. Few countries from my part of the
world make films that have the kind of worldwide
distribution that ours have, not to speak of appre¬
ciation from international critics. Only recently
Iranian film-makers have won four prizes at inter¬
national film festivals. My The Taste ofCherry won
the Colden Palm award at the Cannes Film Festi¬
val, Jaf far Panahi's "Mirror" won the Golden Leop¬
ard at the Locarno Festival, and at the Montreal
Festival Majid Majidi won first prize for direction,
as well as four other awards, for his film "Children
of Heaven". Even more recently Parwiz Shahabazi
won first prize in the young film-maker category
for his film "Traveller from the South" at the Tokyo
Film Festival. This is something very new for Iran.
Compare our situation with that of China. China
was on the verge of the same kind of breakthrough
three years ago. Hut Chinese films were often pro¬
duced in America and many Chinese film-makers
depended on American finance. These films were
given an American-style treatment and lost their
Chinese flavour: American financing changed the
whole structure of Chinese films. Iranian cinema,
on the other hand, may lack technical rigour, finance
to mount expensive productions, and access to net¬
works but it has one invaluable advantage ideas.
Resides, the fact that American films are not dis¬
tributed in Iran is a blessing in disguise because it
means that our film industry has been protected
from stiff competition. What's more, the commercial
success of high-quality Iranian films has led banks
to offer long-term loans for film production, thus
placing the industry on a more secular basis.
H The main character in The Taste of Cherry
decides to take his life. How did you come to make a
film about suicide?
A.K.: Therewere a number of reasons. Firstly, sta¬
tistics show that very few suicide attempts are suc¬
cessful; in other words the desire to live is a lot
more powerful than the desire to die. Secondly,
all religions strongly disapprove of suicide and what
is forbidden naturally attracts curiosity and is
worth looking at closely. We should be free to ask
the question: "Must I continue to live or not?"
Life is a choice and not a sentence, but often we
do not realize this. When we accept life as a bun¬
dle of constraints we are actually making a choice.
I want to tell people: if you choose to live, then do
it well. So many people are standing by the exit

door: they neither take part in life wholeheartedly
nor leave it. They live in the shadow of death.
Let us not pass judgment on the act of suicide.
It may be an act of violence, but in my film it is
accompanied by critical enquiry. Mr. Radii wants to
communicate with people; otherwise he could have
quietly ended his life in bed by taking sleeping
pills . Hut the really important thing is that life
goes on, that there is an unending cycle in which
nature sheds its old skin and grows a new one. This
is more important than wanting to know whether a
character is alive or dead at the end of the film.
Actually the film has more to do with life and
death than with suicide and that is not a new sub¬
ject for me. Three of my films Where is My
Friend's 7/ome? (1987), And Life Goes On (1992)
and Through the Olive Trees (1991) are shown as
a trilogy because they were shot in the same loca¬
tion. Put if you replace Where is My Friend's
Home? with The Taste ofCherry, it makes another
trilogy whose theme is the fight for life and aware¬
ness of death, appreciating life and accepting
responsibility for it while knowing that the exit
door is just round the. corner. The Romanian writer
E. M. Cioran once said, "Without the possibility of
suicide, I would have committed suicide quite a few
years ago."
Did you have problems dealing with this issue?
A.K.: It is true that in Iran suicide is forbidden by
Qur'anic law. Catholics too are strongly opposed
to suicide, lint there are also other people in the
world who are not religious, and besides, religious
laws and those who uphold them may not always
have respect for our lives. In I ran we have a religion
with two parallel streams: one is devoid of the spirit
of enquiry and flows backwards; the other is more
developed and accepts enquiring minds.
In your work the plot of one film often blends
imperceptibly into that of another. . . .
A.K.: Yes. This is particularly true of my latest
trilogy in which each film emerges from the previ¬
ous one much like a Russian doll. My films never tell
a story which begins at one point and ends at
another. A new story always begins somewhere along
the way. And the stories are blended together to
such an extent that it's impossible to separate
them. In fact they are all part of a single story.
Another thing: I think it's important that film-mak¬
ers should leave their films somewhat incomplete so
that spectators can complete them using their own
imagination.
Nature is a constant presence in your films.
A.K.: Yes. We are separated from nature but we are
part of it. Industrialization and progress have not
really come to our rescue. To rediscover ourselves,
we must go back to nature. In 77ie Vhsfe ofCherry,
I tried to show the gradual encroachment of the
industrial landscape and people's relation to it.

hand and is being eaten up by expanding cities.
The old taxidermist in the museum says to Mr.
Radii: "Are you in despair? Have you never looked
at the moon? Don't you want to see the stars? And
the nights of the full moon? Don't you want to hear
the whisper of the rain, the song of the nightin¬
gale? You want to close your eyes? My dear fellow,
you should see all these things! Those who live in
the other world want to come over here to see, and
you want to hurry to go there?"
What do you think of the violence that pervades
cinema today?
A.K.: Violence, like kindness, is a part of human
beings, and as long as it exists it is probably neces¬
sary to show it. Rut there is a difference between vio¬
lence as it exists and violence as it is expressed in
films. 1 think violence tends to be artificially treated
in the cinema. The kind of violence that prevails in
real life is cold, grey violence but it is shown in cin¬
ema in red-hot blood and guts form. We have seen so
much of this fake violence that its so-called magic
does not work anymore. Rut the merchants of vio¬
lence go on making fortunes out of conjuring up a
phantasm of this impulse that is inside everybody
and rooted in society. For twenty years most main¬
stream cinema has not shown violence as it really is.
Violence was not treated like this in the past. In
Fritz Lang's The Big Heat (1953), for example, it is
completely internalized so that enormous tension is
built up. The French director Claude Sautet's
Classe Tous Risques (1960) also explored the psy¬
chology of violence with great skill and emotional
realism. Rut what we see now is professional vio-
lence-mongering for its own sake. The irony is that
nobody likes violence but everybody goes to see it.
How do you feel about winning the Golden Palm
at the 1997 Cannes Festival and Unesco's Federico
Fellini Gold Medal later in the year? Will these
awards help your career?
A.K.: They certainly will. I am very proud and happy
that such prizes have been awarded to my kind of
cinema. The fact that such valuable awards are
coming my way is very important because they
encourage film-makers to cany on producing "dif¬
ferent cinema", cinema with a personal touch. They
will attract audiences to come and see this kind of
cinema and give it greater prestige. Good cinema
cannot exist without an audience.
Who are your favourite film-makers?
A.K.: I like cinema which has roots in reality and yet
also explores dreams. There are many film-makers
I like, but if I had to name one it would be Yasu-
jiro Ozu of Japan.
How should the cause of non-commercial
cinema be defended today?
A.K.: Much commercial cinema is churned out in
response to market forces. Rut this process con¬
tains the seeds of its own destruction because there
is a limit to what people can take. The gap between
this kind of cinema and the reality of normal life has
become so great that people do not recognize them¬
selves any more in this kind of film.
There is not much to he done to counter this
trend; it is going to self-destruct. I certainly hope
that a different kind of cinema will come into its own
and that real cinema will put a stop to fake cinema.
To help this to come about, it is crucial that this
new cinema should be riven critical recognition. M
