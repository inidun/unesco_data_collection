UNESCO'FORUM THEME
SET f'OR SEPTEMBER
AN international"town meeting"on what
every nation can do and shou ! d do inorder to e sure a better understanding
between peoples will mark Lnesco s fourth annual
Conference shortly after it opens in Paris next
September.
The Fourth Session of Unesco's General Con-
ference will take place at Unesco House from
September 19 to. October 5, the Executive Board
of the organization decided last month. Perhaps
the most important feature of the Paris Corn.
ference will be a three-day debate by distinguished
personalities of international reputation on the
following theme :
"What are the duties of the State in regard
to education, science and culture for the purpose of
ensuring a better understanding between peoples.
and what practical steps should be taken in order
to discharge these duties ?"
The debate will be held in a large Parisian
kcture ha ! i. rather than Lnesco House itself. in
order to allow a. large public to participate in
the discussions. The three evenings of September
27, 28 and 29 have been set aside for the occasion
so that Conference detegates. intetiectna) groups,
student organizations and the genera) pubtic may
hear leaders from different parts of the world
debate the subject.
lr liE discussions will be broadcast by thejt Radiodiffusion Francaise and international
radio hook-ups will make the programm,'s
available to listeners in other parts of the word.
In this ay it is hoped to arouse a strong current
of interest in Unesco and the things it stands
for and give emphasis to the contribution that
cuhure. science and education can make for world
peace understanding.
U NE of the most important sessionst in the history of Unesco's Execu-tire board came t   end last
month after a sev'n-day meeting in Par : s
from June 9 to 15. During this period,
the Unesco Executive body approved in
its entirety a programme for this Or-
ganization's participation in the United
Nations plan four technical assistance to
under-developed countries, agreed to the
opening of a Unesco regional office in the
Western Hemisphere, and voted the
allocation of special funds to help refugee
children in the Middle East and Greece.
In addition, the Excutive Board heard
and approved a report on the concrete
and practical work achieved by Unesco
in th* past four months, and approvrd a
draft programme and budget for Unesco
during 1950.
The Board also completed plans for
the Fourth Session of the General Con-
ference which is to take place in Paris
from September 19 to October 5. three
days longer than was originally planned,
in order to allow for a full discussion by
aU member countries of the plan for
technical aid to under-developed coun-
tries.
The Executive Board of Unesco, which
includes 18 members elected by the
General Conference, acts as a Board of
D : rectors for the Conference between its
annual meetings. Though each of its
members is from a different country, the
group represents the Conference as a
whole and its members are elected as
individuals and do not act as representa-
tives for their own governments. Thisyeaf. the Executive Board is being led by
one of India's most distinguished men of
learning, Sir Sarvepalli Radhakrishnan.
and the noted Venezuelan inter-
nationalist. Dr. C. Parra-Perez.
i. Technical Aid Programme
IU NESCO'S plan for an extendedprogramme of technical aid to
under-developed countries was
approved in its entirety by the Executive
Board at its meeting last month.
Other UN SpeciaHzed Agencies such as
the Food and Agriculture Organization.
the International Labour Organization (\
and the World Health Organization have
also been examining the technical aid
plan. and a joint report. cor. Hiding their
views and suggestions along with those
of Unesco will be presented by Trygve
Lie, UN Secretary-General. to the Econo-
mic and Social Council which is meeting
in Geneva on July 4.
The slim suggested for the first two
years of the over-aU programme is

Unesco's aid programme provides for
assistance in technical, elementary and
fundamental adult education : the pro-
duction and use of materials for educa-
tion. including mass communication
materials, the technical needs of press.

depending on the needs and requirements
of the under-developed countries.
The most dip'sect and immediate form
of technical aid that Unesco can offer is
to send advisers and consultants whose
work would range from administrative
advice to direct responsibility for estab-
lishing new types of institutions (such as
teacher training centres or scientific
laboratories) and guiding them for one or
two years.
Other. r methods Unesco can offer
include exploratory misstL. ns. permanent
regional services through field Science
offices, and a broad traming programme
covering fellowships, seminars, symposia,
experimental or demonstration projects
in fundamental education, and regional
training centres. Unesco also hopes to aid
under-developed countries by the distribu-
tion of educational, scientific and tech-
nical books and periodicals, the publica-
tion'of special pamphlets and mono-
graphs. and the setting up of scientific
and technical institutes.
(details 01 Unesco's proposals for
technical development will be found on
Page 11 of this issued.)
If Unesco's General Conference con-
firms the proposals already approved by
the Executive Board and if the Economic
and Social Council ratifies the general
plan for technical assistance, Unesco
will be ready to act in 1950.
Unesco Creates Regional Office
in Western Hemisphere
 N important step towards giving
6."Unesco a moce direct representa-tion in the Western Hemisphere
was taken by the Executive Board when
it approved the establishment of a Unesco
Regional Office with its headquarters,
for 1949. at Havana. Cuba.
The Havana Office, which is Unesco's
first experiment in regional centres, is
scheduled to open on September 1st. Its
main task will be to make Unesco better
known throughout the Western Hemis-
phere. to increase contacts between
Unesco's Member States and the National
Commissions in the region, and to enlist
their full support in carryir. g out Unesco's
programme of cultural co-operation, since
this work is already being done by the
Inter-American Cultural Council of the
Organization of American States.

2 UNESCO COURIER
July 1949
(Continued from page 1)
The Office is being set up in agreement
with the Cuban Government, which has
offered a yearly contribution of $ 10, 000
towards its cost. Cuba has already placed
at the disposal of the new Office an
impressive building facing the Plaza del
Mayo and the large Havana bay, and has
agreed to provide diplomatic privileges to
the staff as well as customs and postal
franchise.
In the initial stages, the Regional
Office will concentrate its work on the
States of the Caribbean area (Antilles,
Central America, Colombia, Ecuador,
Mexico and Venezuela). Later, when it
has had more experience of regional
problems, this radius of action will De
gr-aduaIly extended. During 1949, the
Regional Office will be limited to a staff
of four, including a specialist in funda-
mental education.
The question of establishing regional
offices or regional centres has been a
subject marked by stormy discussions at
Unesco's General Conferences during the
past two years. Certain delegations have
strongly opposed the idea
of de-centralizing Unesco
through the creation of such
centres. The idea was first
proposed at the Mexico City
Conference in 1947 and after
much discussion agreed to in
principles, subject to consul-
tations and agreement be-
tween Unesco. the United
Nations and its Specialized
Agencies and the Organ : za-
tion of American States
(OAS).
Last year, at the Beirut
Conference, the presentation
of the results of these con-
sultations and a resolution
to create a Regional Centre
in Cuba again found dele-
gates divided in heated de-
bate. When it came to the
vote, however, the Confer-
ence adopted a resolution
instructing the Director-Gen-
eral"to establish as soon
as possible a Regional Office
in the Western Hemisphere"
in consultation with the
OAS and the UN family.
Before the Executive Board
finally approved the setting
up of the Havana Office last
month some of the nesita-
tions which had previously
marked the General Con-
ference meetings again were
felt. Although Mr. Tcnes
Bodet stated that neither the
OAS nor the UN or its Agen-
cies opposed the creation of the Regional
Office, some members of the Board ex-
pressed the view that a Regional Office
in the Western Hemisphere should be set
up with the technical and financial co-
operation of the Organization of American
States, which they pointed out, had great
educational possibilities for America and
"its close co-operation with Unesco would
be the best method of spreading Unesco's
ideas and action in North and South
America."
In agreeing, finally, to the immediate
establishment of a Unesco Regional
Office in Havana, the Executive Board
expressed its thanks to the Government
of Cuba for the assistance and facilities
it was extending for the opening of the
office and asked the Director-Gcneral to
consult with the OAS on the best ways
of collaboration between the two orga-
nizations. The Executive Board also asked
M. Torres Bodet to submit a report to
the Fifth General Conference, to be held
in Florence, Italy, next year outlining the
achievements of the Office, the expe-
rience gained through it and the possi-
bility of entrusting to it creative activities
within the framework of the Unesco
programme.
Aid to Refugee Children
In Greece and Middle East
FOLLOWING an appeal by the United
Nations calming on Unesco for aid
in caring for Greek refugee
children, the Unesco Executive Board last
month approved emergency steps to help
these Children.
The UN appeal, which was communicat-
ed to Unesco by Trygve Lie, following a
report by the UN Special Committee on
the Balkans, reported the news that the
number of refugees in Greece has in-
creased from 18, 600 in January 1947, to
666,000 in January 1949. This represents
one-tenth of Greece population. How-
ever, since this figure covers only those
who have claimed assistance and proved
their need, the actual total of refugees
in the country is estimated at nearer one
million.
The exact number of refugee children
is not known, but it is known that their
situation is one of the most tragic in
Europe today. Since October 1940, Greece
has been racked by war and upheaval.
The little ones under the age of nine have
yet to learn the meaning of the word
"peace". Over two years ago, Unesco
field workers had carried out a shprt
survey of the educational losses of the
country, and one of them reported :"It is
impossible to exaggerate the educational
losses". Unesco's"Book of Needs I".
published in 1947, states,"the saddest
sights in Greece are to be seen in the
institutions and schools for waf-handicap-
ped children."
But what about today, and the thou-
sands of new homeless refugee children ?
The Unesco Executive Board felt that
the United Nation's call for help could
not b= ignored by an organization which
is dedicated to the preservation of real
values in tomorrow's generations.
One fact, however, was sadly clear to
all the members of the Board. With its
very limited Reconstruction budget-
almost all of which had already been
allocated for other aid purposes earlier
this year-Unesco obviously could not
provide the sums needed to meet even
the minimum requirements of these re-
fugee children.
The Board felt, however, that if it
could at least make a small gesture-even
a symbolic gesture-this might spur on
its National Commissions and Unesco
clubs and other national and internation-
al organizations to make other gestures.
And these when added up from all the
groups in different parts of the world,
could go'into a fund which would really
achieve positive results.
The Executive Board, therefore, voted
to make an initial grant, from Unesco's
Reconstruction Fund reserve, of $ 10, 850,
"for emergency help of an educational
and cultural character, as a means of
providing a concrete token of Unesco's
desire to aid these refugees, in the field

which is its special concern, and along-
side the other United Nations Agencies
which have come to their aid."
On the recommendation of Unesco's
Director-General, the Executive Board
also agreed that one of its members,
Professor Paulo de Berredo Carneiro, of
Brazil, would go to Greece, subject to the
approval of the Greek Government, to
enquire into the present-day educational
needs of the child refugee victims in the
country. The small sum of $ 10, 850, which
Unesco has voted, will be placed at
Professor Carneiro's disposal for use by
him in the manner and through the
channels he considers appropriate.
In the light of the information that
Professor Carneiro obtains, M. Torres
Bodet will draw up a plan of action
whereby Unesco, its National Commissions
and the international and national or-
ganizations which are associated with its
reconstruction campaign, can contribute
to the solut : on of the educational
problems of the Greek refugee children.
And as soon as the required information
is available, Unesco will launch a special
appeal to these organizations.

tions in the Middle East refugee camp
school, written by a Unesco representa-
tive who visited them recently will be
found on Page 3 of this issue along with.
an urgent appeal made by Unesco
to raise $25, 000 order to continue oper-
ation of refugee schools in the Lebanon,
Syria. Transjordan, and in the JerichO
and Gaza areas of Palestine. ]
;
Proposed Programme
and Budget for 1950
HE Executive Board, during its week-long Session last month, had before
it for consideration a proposed
programme and budget for 1950 which
the Director-General had submitted for
its examination. The Board approved the
proposed programme for Unesco's fourth
year of activities and decided to recom-
mend to the Paris General Conference
the adoption of a budget totalling
$ 8. 962, 220, representing an increase of
$ 1, 200, 000 over the 1949 budget.
In its report to the General Conference,
the Executive Board stated its conviction
"that the activities and the funds pro-
posed remain at a moderate sca1e in
relation to the world's needs for educa-
tion, science and culture."
It should be pointed out that the pro-
posed 1950 programme does not represent
any drastic revision of the one adopted
at Beirut, which was designed to cover
at least two years'activities. Adressing
the Executive Board's Programme Com-
mittee, M. Torres Bodet described the
fact that he was presenting a smaller
programme while asking for a larger
budget, as"a realistic move.""Foe if
tangible aims are to be achieved,"he said,
"fewer projects and larger credits will be
necessary."Final decisions as to the
1950 programme and budget will rest
with the General Conference when it
meets in Paris this September.
1
The resources of Unesco will be
devoted, on the one hand, to the
maintenance of approved con-
tinuing services,
other hand, to the execution of
a limited number of special pro-
jects determined by the General
Conference from time to time.
All these activities should form
a coherent whole and relate to
matters of evident importance
and usefulness.

Unesco will. if necessary assist
in the establishment, the develop-

A BLUEPRINT OF DIRECTIVES
THE most important new feature of Unesco's deftprogramme for 1950, approved by its Executive
Board last jronth, is a code of 18 directives which, if
adopted by the General Conference in September, will
become basic principles for Unesco. The directives will
serve as a "bridge" between Unesco's in generalized
form by its Constitution and the specific programme
resolutions. These directives, it is hoped will assist in
the orientation of Unesco's work and should, at the
same time, give the general public a clearer understand-
ing of the Organization's aims and activities.
15
Uneseo will take special measures
to associate young people as far
as possible, both in the
execution of its programme and
in making widely known the
principles upon which it is bas-
ed. For this reason Unesco will in
particular seek the co-operation
of teachers and others active in
directing youth movements.

Unesco will seek to utilize,

morning while it was

when a herd of goats

w. th much shouting and arm waving the
shepherd drove his charges to one side
of the dusty highway and we were away
again.
We passed a sign marked"sea level"
and it began to grow hotter and hotter
as we drove down into the vallsy. leaving
behind us the few colourful villages of
Transjordan.
Towards eleven o'clock we arrived at EI
Shune, a cluster of low-built huts on the
edge of the Jordan Valley. On out left lay
the shimmering Dead Sea, while on our
right stretched the endless rows of white
tents, dazzling under scorching sun. This
was the El Shune refugee camp. where
20, 000 people were barely subsisting on a
ration of 1, 500 calories a day-about half
the normal requirements.

them. There was the usual crop of snake
bites to attend to, they told me, and they
had heard rumours that the camp might
be moved further north.
Outside the heat had become unbearable
for it was now midday. With the camp
manager, I trudged across the sand
towards the camp"school."The use of the
word school would only be justified by
the definition"a place where children are
taught,"for I saw none of the things one
usually associates with a school.
There were no buildings, nor were there
any at all within a fifty-mile radius or
more, This was the desert where John the
Baptist had lived and wandered,"a vo : ce

There was nothing for the children to
sit on but the baking hot sand. We went
from class to class ; from group to group

the litt : e ones there were tents, but the
rest were being taught in the open air
under the blistering sun.

MR. WILLEM VAN VLIET, a member of Unesco's Reconstruction Depart-ment. recently returned fro  the Middle East after spending one
month visiting Lnesco-sponsored refugee schools, set up by voluntary
organizations, in Lebanon, Syria, Palestine and Transjordan.
In the following article, he gives a graphic account of some of the
things he saw during a visit to one of the camp schools at El Shune, in
the Jordan Valley, and describes similar problems facing educational
workers in oth'r parts of the Middle East.

chargès :"How do you spell it ?"
"L-A-U-G-H""Good, now"S-P-E-A-K"-
"How do you spell that ?"...
There was not even a blackboard at El
Shune to lighten the'r task.
After inspecting all 32 classes in the
school, we made our way to the tent
where Mr. Fattah Nounih, the head-
master, had set up his office. Here, im-
provisation was still an essential factor,
for the headmaster was obliged to use an
old soap box as a writing table.
Mr. Noun : h's immediate worry that
morning was the fact that the two note-
books in which he kept his school records
were almost full. Each morning, he to'd

I took notes on the equipment needed
in the El Shune school : 32 blackboards,
6. 000 copybooks, 2. 000 pencils. Arab
readers, English New Method Readers.
When I had finished, Mr. Nounih added
wistfully."And a school-bell, please".
I thought he was joking."Do you really
want me to note that too ?" I asked."Oh
yes."he replied emphatically,"a school-
bell is most essential"
Two weeks later, when I had returned
to Paris. I could hear Mr. Nounih's in-

Unesco Sponsors Camp School..
For Middle East Refugee Children
THIRTY-ONE Unesco-sponsored schools are now
providing educational facilities for over 11, 000I refugee children in the Lebanon, Palestine. Syria,
and Transjordan under Unesco's programme of assistance
to Middle East refugees. Teachers have been recruited
from among the Palestine refugees themselves.
Unesco's contribution to relief work in the Middle East
was made at the request of the Third General Conference
at Beirut, last December, which led to the creation of
a $45. 000 fund to support the"Unesco"schools.
From its own budget, Unesco gave $15. 000. A further
$20. 000 was provided by the Lord Mayor of London's
Fund while the Norwegian United Nations Appeal for
Children (UNAC) Committee made a donation of $10, 000.
This fund was designed to allow the schools to operate
until August 31. at which date the United Nations Relief
Programme in the Middle East was also due to end. As
this Programme will now probably be carried on until
the end of 1919, Unesco is trying to raise a further
$25, 000 to maintain the schools programme until the
same date.
After hearing a report on the Middle East situation,
at its meeting last month. Unesco's Executive Board
made an appeal to the Lord Mayor of London's Fund for
. further donation of $20, 000 which would allow the
schools to remain open until November 15.
The Board also asked Member States to raise the
remaining $5, 000 which would provide for the needs of
the schools until December 31.
The"Unesco"schools, for which these funds are
intended, are being operated by the three voluntary
agencies in charge of the United Nations. Relief for
Palestine Refusees : the League of Red Cross Societies.
in the Lebanon. Syria and Transjordan ; the International
Committee of the Red Cross, in Palestine ; and the
American Friends Service Committee in the Gaza Area
of southwest Palestine.
The voluntary agencies have found that education is
vitally important to their work, now that regular food
supplies and shelter are being provided under the United
Nations programme. Schools have greatly raised the
morale of camps where they have been established and
are everywhere in great demand by the refugees them-
selves.
Schools have been started by the Palestine Committee
in the Jerusalem, Nablous and Bekaa areas, and by the
refugees themselves with the aid of Voluntary Agencies.
All these schools need basic equipment, such as black-
boards and exercice books, and will have to close down
if more outside help does not materialize.
request. A school-bell ringing in the
wilderness.
I also thought of the other schools I
had vis : ted in Transjordan, in soithern
Palestine and in the Lebanon. Some were
in army barracks, some under tents and
others in the open air, vet everywhere
the picture was essentially the same-
children sitting on the ground, the com-
plete absence of equipment, but in spite
of this. the attention with IWhiah the
children followed the lessons.
'Education Hunger'
1-= EVERYWHERE I went I found theL same symptcm of" ducati n hun-
ger". I remember the girls in the
Neuserath Camp school, r. ear Gaza, in
southern Palestine, who had just been
vaccinated against typhus. When their
teacher told them they could go home
not one of the girls would leave."We
have had enough holidays,''they pro-
tested.
One of the reasons for this "appetite"
for education is, I believe, that the people
had grown to appreciate the value of edu-
cation long before they became refugees.
The school system under the British
administrat'on in Palestine was above all
a practical one ; basic instruction was
given in elementary schools, with lessons
in agriculture and often school garden-
ing.
Palestine teachers in refugee camps
are now trying to copy this system as
closely as possible.
The impression which remains upper-
most in my mind is something I felt
rather than saw or heard in the camps.
It was the striking difference between
the undoubtedly better moral in camps
where educational activities had been
started and that in camps still without
emergency schools.
Unesco, together with the Lord Mayor
of London's Appeal for Children, and the
Norwegian UNAC have provided over
11, 000 of the refugee children with desks,
notebooks, pencils, textbooks and black-
boards. But more than 15. 000 children
are still attending schools which have no
equipment and an additional 150, 000 re-
ceive no instruction at all.
french Children
Help War Orphans'Camp
BY donating at least one franceach, school children in towns
and villages all over France have rais-
ed over 1. 500, 00 francs (about $4, 500)
during the past few we'ks towards the
cost of holding an international war
orphans'holiday camp in southwest
France.
Cost of building and running the
camp, to be held during August in the
Moulin Vieux Republic, a Children's
community twenty-eight mi ! M from
Grenoble, is estimated at 3, 000, 000
francs (S9. 000),
The French children's contribution,
made in response to an appeal from
the French National Commission for
Unsco, will, thcrefore, cover half the
total cost.
Sponsored by the International Fe-
deration of Children's Communities
the camp will be attended by fifty
"delegates,"aged from I ! to 17,
coming from children's communities

July 1949
UNESCO HEAD
ASKS PRIORITY
FOR PRESS WIRES
Priority wire facilities for the
press, were recommended by M.
Jaime Torres Bodet, Direclor-Cen-
eral of Unesco, in a statement he he
addressed to Ihe International Tele-
graph and Telephone (I. T. T.)
Conference in Paris, on July 1.
The press, said M. Torres Bodet,
"requires preferential wire facilities
everywhere to fulfil its function of
providing adequate and ample
information to the public."
M. Torres Bodet also pointed out
to the Conference, which was draw-
ing up new communications regula-
tions, that the press is one of the
"prillcipal clients of exisling tele-
communications services". He
added that priority lines would be be
"of great importance to ire free
flow of information between the
peoples."
Olher points emphasized in the
Director-General's statement were :
1) The press shoultd obtain
priority over private wire messages
and preferenlial and preferential allocation of f
teleprinler teleprinter circuits since it provides
ø service 10 the general public.
2) Press messages should be
transmitted at reduced rates.
3) To obviate restrictions in the
use of ire serrices because of
foreign exchange difficulties, the
"Collect System". permitting pay-
mellt at the receiving end, should
be extended as far as possible.
4) Press messages should be
understood to cover a larger field
than merely political and com-
mercial information.Radio!!
"SCHOOL broadcasting is becom-
ing an institution which is
needed by the children of to-
day. It stands at the side of parents and
teachers as a well-informed friend, acting
swiftly and surety, cooperating in the
creation of an atmosphere favourable to
present-day children."
The former director of school broad-
casting in Czechoslovakia who wrote
these words was expressing, in general
terms, the importance which this branch
of radio is now assuming in world
education.
Yet despite the importance. the progress
made in its developments by different
countries has been far from uniform.
Some have reached full stature, others
are now learning to walk while there are
many who have still to take their firststeps.
THE school broadcasting services ofsome countries, Great Britain, the
United States and Canada, for example,
can now be said to have reached their
full maturity, due in part to their
extremely flexible school programmes,
which are easily adaptable to school
radio.
In other countries, the"rigidity"of
school programmes accounts for the
relatively underdeveloped state of such
radio programmes or even their non-exis-
tence. Finally, there are countries where
the defectiveness of the school system
and the lack of teachers hampers the
rational development of a system of
school broadcasts, which could meet the
needs fif the school population as a
whole.
In many of these countries, however,
there is a strong interest and a general
wish to start producing radio programmes
for schools.
What prevents them from following
the lead of others ? Sometimes thev have
not sufficient funds or equipment to set
up the specialized organization which is
required, or else their school syllabi make
it difficult to fit in broadcasting periods.
There is even a psycholonical obstacle to
overcome-opposition to the idea because
of its novelty.
Oblltacles to School Radio
ONE of the greatest obstacles, however,is lack of knowledge on how to
organize a school radio service, knowledge
which bee British Broadcastine Corpora-
tion and other well-developed radio
Unesco To Start Feature Service
For World Press On July 15
STARTING on July 15. and every two
weeks thereafter, Unesco will be
providing a world-wide service t
the press to be called Unesco Features.
This fortnightly service is to be part of
a scheme to supply highly readable ma-
terial about the sciences, education and
culture, to over 2. 000 publications in the
Member States of Unesco, as well as
Germany and Japan. Texts will be offer-
ed in English. French or Spanish.
In addition, Unesco will make available
to publications supplementary feature
articles from time to time.
These may be either original
pieces written excJusiveJy for
the new Unesco service ot pub-
lished articles for which Unesco
has secured reproduction rights.
The new feature service will
offer to the press the same type
and quality of material-
although in expanded form-
that radio networks ace receiv-
ing from the now popular
Unesco World Review which is
being broadcast weekly to au-
diences of millions in 35 coun-
tries. Unesco features has re-
sulted from the same intensive
preliminary research that was
made before the Unesco radio programme
was undertaken.-,
MASS communications experts in fact,
have noted that whi : e some publi-
cations already have excel : ent sections
dealing with education, science and cul-
ture, many others have been unable, un-
til now, to obta'n such material regutarly.
The new feature service, which will be
supplied free of charge to the press, will be
an attanpt to help fill this gap for editors
and the reading public.
Although of interest to newspapers in
large cities, the service will be produced,
in the main, for provincial publications
and especial1y the press in lesser develop-
ed areas.
Each issue of Unesco Fatures will con-
sist of about 5, 000 words, containing short
items, telling of interesting and important
events in educat'on, science and culture,
that occur in various parts of the world,
phasis will be given to st. ories about
techniques used in different parts of the
world which have some particular local
appJication, Le., the successful efforts of
a community to educate children for
better citizenship.
Those of Unesco's activities of general
interest to the public will be included in
the service, as well as features on
Unesco's major themes, such as"Food
and People" and "Human Rights".
It is hoped that such articles will focus
public attention on these problems which
Unesco is currently stressing.
A regular column."World
Books", will review works from
various countries which con-
tribute to international under-
standing. Each issue of Unesco
features will also contain a
section devoted to the science
and their role in fostering world
cooperation.
UNESCO groups in theMember state are being
asked to help the Secretariat
in two ways :
First they can aid in the
distribution of Unesco features
by pointing out to editors
and longer articles, along the same lines.
All of these will be readily adaptable for
use by editors.
The new press service will include spe-
cially written features giving striking
examples of how nations are working
together in the fields of education, science
and the arts and examples of national
achievements in these fields which can
serve as gu : des for other countries. Em-
SCHOOL BROADCASTING
Experts Urge Creation of Unesco World Information Centre
To Spur Development of Radio Programmes for Children
organizations have gained through 15
years' experience.
The need to prepare and supply data
to broadcasting organizations in order
to promote the development of education
by radio was stressed last year by the
Radio Sub-Commission of Unesco's Com-
mission on Technical Needs in Press.
Film and Radio.
Following up its recommendations,
Unesco approached some of the radio
organizations, having thorough experience
in the field, for information on every
aspect of school broadcasting, so that
this knowledge could be passed on to
other nations wishing to start new services
or expand existing ones.
From its survey. which covered Belgium,
Great Britain. Poland. Sweden, and
Switzerland, in Europe, and Canada,
Mexico, the United States and Brazil in
the Americas, as well as India. Australia
and the Union of South Africa. U7esco
received sufficient material to fill an
850-page report.
Twelve Countries Report
LAST month, therefore, Unesco calleda meeting of its Consultative Com-
mittee for Educational Broadcasting for
a study of these factual reports from 12
countries and for a general study on
school broadcasting prepared by M. Roger
Clausse, Assistant Director-General of
the Belgia : 1 National Broadcasting
Institute.
Of the five members of this committee,
three were heads of school broadcasting
services : Mr. R. Postgate (B. B. C.) : Mr.
A. Oakkenhaug (Norway) and Miss J.
Waller (N. B. C., Chicago), the others
being M. N. Lakshmanan, Director-
General of All India Radio and M. R.
Dovaz, Director of Radio Geneva.
Three observers. M. Nieto Caballero
(International Bureau of Education),
Miss J. Coombs (New Zealand) and Mrs
Victoria Corey (U. S. A.) followed the
meetings at Unesco House.
After going through the reports.
these experts formulated a number of
recommendations which, together with
the reports of the survey, will be pub-
lished for the benefit of all governments
and broadcasting organizations. Before
this is done, however, more information
on specific problems will be obtained from
other countries than those already covered
by the survey. In the 12 nations surveyed,
the accent was on long-term experience.
but there are other countries which in a
relatively short time have organized
educational service of a high order.
CHILE, for example, began school broad-casting only in 1943 and although
the S : ate does not own a single radio
station, it is putting out one of the
most varied educational programmes in
the world. The commercial companies in
Chile, which operate the radio stations
grant part of their programme time to
broadcasts prepared by a special service
of the Ministry of Education for trans-
mission to schools, teachers, students in
technical, professional and commercial
and colleges and to parents.
There are other small countries like
Chile which would like to introduce school
broadcasting. To assist them. the experts'
committee suggested that Unesco set up
a Wor : d Documentation and Information
Centre at its headquarters in Paris.
The centre will include a general and
specialized bibliography, backed up by a
library, an international register of
periodicals, programme booklets issued by
broadcasting organizations, a selection of
scripts and recordings of school pro-
grammes and general infonnation on
educational broadcasting collected by
Unesco.
how its use will further the aim
of governments who wish to foster the
educational and cultural developments of
their citizens.
Secondly, they can forward to Unesco
Features, at Un2sco House in Paris, news
of education, science and culture in their
country which of significance for other
parts of the world. This will permit
Unesco to give wide diffusicn to research
findings, scientific discoveries and cul-
tural experiences that affect every day
life. Such items could come from edu-
cators in their schools, scientists in their
laboratories or even farmers in the fields.
Unesco Features will provide Unesco it-
seit with a ready made service for pro-
moting other programme projects of the
Organization. For example, one of
Unesco's activities is the"popular'zation
of science and its social implications".
The feature service will be one way in
which the media of mass communications
can be used to"diffuse scientific and
technical knowledge among all classes of
the community, so as to increase the un-
derstanding of advances in these fields".
For Unsco Features has been planned to
reach not only publications destined for
the general reading public, but those
devoted to such specialized subjects as
basic education, public health, agricul-
tural extension services, and public admi-
nitration."
It is hoped that the new press service
will provide a form of assistance to under-
developed countries, since many special-
ized publications, operating on meagre
budgets, and almost the whole daily and
weekly press in these countries will be
kept informed of developments in other
parts of the world. Here will be practical
articles telling of successful achievements
in other areas leading towards the elimi-
nation of illiteracy, the eradication of
diseases and the adaptation of modern
technology to agriculture and industry.
Here will be education and science"at the
service of economic progress". Here, in
sum, is a service by which the people
can be helped to help themselves, and by
which the press can fulfil its high ob : iga-
tions towards its readers and the com-
munity.

SUPPLEMENT
COURIER
PUBLICATION OF THE UNITED NATIONS EDUCATIONAL, SCIENTIFIC AND CULTURAL ORGANIZATION
Volume M-No 6. JULY 1919.
Adult Education lucation
By Jean BLOCH - MICHEL
Special 'Courier' correspondent at Elsinore
'ONCE OF THE MOST IMPORT-
ANT QUESTIONS OF OUR DAY
AND ONE LIKELY TO HAVE
THE MOST FAR - REACHING
CONSEQUENCES"
(Torres Bodet)
ON a tongue of land part of the sea-
port of Elsinore, stands the castleof Kronborg. It was here, "un-
der the kindly shade of the genius of
Shakespeare", that the first international
conference on adult education opened on
June 16, to discuss what M. Torres Bodet
has called "one of the most important
questions of our day and one likely to
have the most far-reaching conse-
quences".
For, as the Director-General of Unesco
declared in one of his major addresses
of the year, inaugurating the conference,
"the aim of our Congress Is... the awaken-
ing in the consciousness of every adult of
an awareness both of his personal res-
ponsibility and of his intellectual and
moral fellawship with the whole of
mankjnd".
On the day following the opening
speeches by M. Torres Bodet and M.
Hartvig Frisch, the Danish Minister or
Education, the work of the conference
proper began in Elsinore at the Inter-
national People's College-one of the
many Danish institutions devoted to adult
education.
For a period of almost tWJ weeks, from
June 16 to 25, almost one hundred and
fifty delegates from 29 nations, speaking
Dearly as many different languages. liv-
ed and worked together at the College
to see how their individual experiences
and working methods could be poo : ed so
that adult education, through interna-
tional co-operation, could be employed
for the betterment of all mankind.
ON the morning of June 17, in a greathall, decked with the flags of all
of the countries represented, the
first plenary meeting of the adult educa-
tion conference was opened by Dr. C : a-
rence E. Beeby, Assistant Director-
General of Unesco and head of its Educa-
tion Department. Dr. Beeby pointed out
that although the conference had been
convened by Unesco. its success depend-
ed on the delegates themselves and the
30 international organizations. devoted to
adult education questions, which they re-
presented. He drew their attention to the
fact that. on the basis of the work they
accomplished, Unesco was going to pre-
pare a handbook on adult e cation
which would serve adult educators
throughout the world. Unesco's actual
lWork would begin, Dr. Beeby said. where
the Elsinore Conference ended.
After hearing the Assistant Director-
General, the delegates elected the officers
of the Conference : M. Novrup, had of
the Danish delegation, was elected Presi-
dent, and Mr. Pei-Ching Tang, China's
representative and M. Muschin Adil Bi-
nal. of Turkey. Vice-chairmen. M. Bus-
sière and M. Lengrand, of the Unesco
Secretariat were named respectively Secre-
tary-General and Rapporteur. Four com-
missions were set up to discuss the "con-
tent of adult education", "agencies and
problems of organization", "methods and
technique", and"the means of establish-
ing permanent international co-operation"
in adult education.
DURING the second week of the con-ference, two distinguished visitors
arrived at Elsinore. at the invitation
of Unesco, to present to the delegates
their personal views-as wor : d thinkers-
on adult education.
The first, Sir John Maud, Permanent
Under-Secretary of Education in the
United Kingdom, spake on the signifi-
cance of adult education, which he des-
cribed as the means man has of getting
away from the oppressive feeling of soli-
tude in an inhuman world.
"We can help individual men and wo-
men to find more significance in their
lives", he said."in their work. in their
citizenship, both as members of their na-
tion and of the world community-to
be more significant and to feel more
significant... in other words, to be able
to help free men from a sense of insig-
nificance".
A few days later, the noted French
writer and professor. M. Jean Guéhenno,
addressed the conference. He stressed
the importance of distinguishing between
culture and"all the noise being made
about culture", and of giving men a
desire for THE truth even when it was
not THEIR truth.
In the course of its meetings, the Elsi-
nore Conference defined the content of
adult education as"the dual ! function of
not only providing certain useful ideas
which will help the individual to play
his part in economic, social and political
life. but also of enabling him to develop
for himself within his community, a better
integrated and more human life... It is
more than anything a spiraual condition,
a thirst for knowledge, a desire for men-
tal and social freedom, an urge to parti-
cipate in cultural development".
Results Achieved
WHAT are the practical measures,
however, which have emergedfrom the ten-day meeting in
Elsinore last month ?
A number of specific, concrete steps,
designed to be carried out either as im-
mediate or long-term programmes, was
adopted by the Conference at the end of
its deliberations, so as to promote perma-
nent world co-operation in adult educa-
tion.
(Continued on Page 8)
Personal contacts between delegates did much to ensure the success
of the Elsinore Conference in Denmark. Above, two adult education
specialists exchange ideas between Conference meeting in the People's
College at Elsinore.

100 YEARS OF THE DANISH
FOLK HIGH SCHOOL MOVE}} WENT
by Hartvig FRISCH
Minister oj Education, Denmark
ADULT EDIT
OF1
It have been asked by the Danish National Commission to say
some words about the subject we are going to discuss, in the
light of Denmark's experience.
First, I want to thank M. Torres Bodet for his brilliant,
eloquent and penetrating interpretation of the whole problem in
which he pointed to the march of events from the ancient Greeks down
to the atrocities of the second World War.
It seems to me that the Director-General of Unesoo is quite right
both in pointing to the danger of propaganda for the mass education
of adults as ; i in urging the necessity of filling the empty gap which
threatens to separate thc different groups in modern sorely.
Especially troy a democratic point of view. it is of fundamental
importance for the State, that adult citizens who are responsible by
their votes for the executive pltwer of the com : nunity shou : d be ab ! e
not only to read and write, but to form independent. opinion\> on the
political issues of today.
Pericles and Unesco
lr HE o ; d Athen an, Socrates,whom M. Torres Bodet has
quoted, was undoubtedly
deeply interested in education,
but we can gather from the works
of his discfples, that he was
rather sceptICal about the benefits
of democracy and especially
about the rule of the majority.
And yet, Socrates lived as a cow-
temporary fellow citizen of Peril-
des who. more than any other
statesman of antiquity, favoured
democracy and adult education in
the most liberal sense of the
word, as we know from the famous
"Funeral Oration."Here we find,
as quoted by Thucydides, the well-
known phrase declaring Athens
the School of Hells. This. for
his time. was really some sort of
Unesco programme.
In the same Oration we find
the idea that a man who does not
care for politics is not only indif-
ferent, but frank : y worthless.
This bold statement corresponds
very well with the exigencies of
a true democracy ; and, of course,
it is not purely by accident that
the old Greek tern. n for a private
individual-"iàiotes"-eventuaJly
pcquired in modern languages the
popular meaning of idiot. This
play of words, caused by se-
mantic evolution, contains, as in
a nut-shell, the whole problem of
adult education, of paideia, as it
was looked upon by the dem-
ocratic statesman Pericies and
by his contemporary, the philo-
sopher Socrates.
Grundtvig and Kierkegaard
"-./E find exactly the same
sharp differences in Dan-
ish thinking and litt_a-
ture. even as far back as the
first. days of our democracy-
that is to say just 1M years
fgo-when Denmark was given a
free Constitution. We have just
been celebrating the centenary.
about the year 1848 we had in
Denmark two men of outstanding
capaclty who later gained world-
Wide fame, Gruntvig and Kierk-
egaard. Both were theologians
and both possessed extraordinary
literary talents, but otherwise
they were as different as day ana
night. Grundtvig. with his ail-
embracing mind was fond or
country life and loved the peats-
ant. To teach the peasants to
become free and self-confident
citizens, he used Christian hymns
and old Nordic legend.
Kierkegaard, a pupil or So-
crates and Hegel, was an aesthete,
who dialectically examined hIs
own character. A prototype of all
! ater existentialism and a great
critic of the liberal ideals of his
age, he addressed his books, not
to the public. but as he wrote
on the front page,"to the
individual reader."
In the difference'betwen these
two masters of Danish literature
we find expressed a profound
divergence in the ideals of educa-
tin. which we nought not to
ignore in our studies of the prob-
lems of adult education.
The Folk High School
T is easy enough to find theM broad influence of Grundtvig
in all popular Danish educa-
tion. About 1830 Gundtvig had
already conceived thy idea or
founding a folk high school M
educate the Danish people and
prepare them for cultural, social
and political activities. And his
words did not fall upon stony
ground, for in 1844, as a result
of the Danish national movement
in the Duchy of SIesvig. the first
folk high school was founded in
Rodding by Christian Floor.
Grundtvig himself attached
great limp') stance to the idea of
founding a folk high school at
Solo where youths from all classes
would meet and be imbued with
national and historical ideas, free.
from any scholastic prejudies.
He had obtained a definite pro-
mise from King Christian VIII.
for the establishment of the
school, but because of the King s
death and the introduction of
the new Constitution this promise
was left unfulfilled.
However, Grundtvig's idea of
folk high schools did not die
because of the failure of the Solo
project. All over the country his
followers set to work. Soon folk
high schools founded by private
followers sprang up by the
hundreds in all parts of Den-
mark. Their creative activity
reached its height
in about 1870. The
majority of the su-
dents attending the
folk high schools
were the children of
the fàrmmg popula-
tion. I can here
quote a passage from
a booklet recently
published about Dan-
ish statesmen, which
reads :
"Having reCeived
or 1 y elementary
school education.
they came to. the
folk high schools in
search of a wider
range of interests.
Material progress
was not their sole
aim, they wanted
their share of know-
ledge of the na'. ; on
and of the principles of political
democracy."
Co-operative Movement
"tm"HE ideas of the old folkM high schools were based on
a national, nordic and
Christian culture, and it is an
interesting fact that although
the school did not offer any
professional courses, it. was this
inspiration of Grundtvig's, never-
theless. which laid the founda-
tion for the agricultural co-
operative movement.
This, more than anything else,
resulted in the remodelling of
Danish agriculture during the
crisis in the eighties and was
responsible for the extraordinary
development of Danish farming.
During the same decades Den-
mark graduaJIy developed into an
industrial nation. But. among the
labouring masses, thus brought
into being in the cities and towns,
these ideas of a national, nordic
aid Christian inspiration did not
exist. The trade unions, together
with the Social Democratic Party.
fought their way, by means of
strikes, following the interna-
tional lines of the developing
labour movement on the Con-
tinent. The idea of providing
adult education for the workers
came first from the university
and from the free-thinkers and
followers of Georg Brandes. Bran-
des, although an atheist, was a
great reader of Kierkegaard from
his youth.
(Continued on page 8)
WE publish below the full text of one of themost important addresses delivered by M.
Jaime Torres Bodet, since he took up his post as
Director-General of Unesco late last year.
Mr. Torres Bodet spOke on June 16. at the
opening ceremony of the Conference on Adult Edu-
cation in Elsinore. Denmark.
YOU are meeting in this
city, renowned alike for
its beauty, and its
hospitality, to consider one
of the most absorbing topics
of our day : adult education.
The basic concept of your
work is characteristic of our
era. In a certain sense, however, it corresponds
to an eternal preoccupation of civiliza-
tion. We need go no further back than
to the time when Athens, under the influence
of Socrates, considered philosophy as a way
of life and living, as teaching, as paideia. The
memory of Plato counsels humility whenever
we catch ourselves believing that our problems
are something new. For did not Plato say that,
in order to educate the citizen, it is necessary
to educate the city ? And was not the city, in
the ancient world, the state ?
I see no inconsistency in reminding you, on the
one hand, that the ideal towards which we are
striving is an ancient one. and in stating, on the
other hand, that adult education is one of the most
important questions of our day and one likely to
have the most far-reaching consequences. On the
contrary, the fact that this problem is both topical
and perennial is confirmation of its importance
and gravity Even before the 1939, war. its impor-
tance was recognized by educationists, by many
agricultural, industrial and academic associations,
and even by certain governments. Extensive
programmes of popular education were indeed
worked out ; in some countries on account of the
political requirements of the totalitarian regimes ;
in others as a result of that desire for emanci-
pation which does honour to democracy.
IT is not for me to consider in detail the
outcome of those efforts. I should like,
however, to draw your att ntio to a fact
which this Conference should certainly not over-
look, for it is at the root of dangers which we
must take into consideration in all our work. I am
referring to the perfidious way in which the
Fascist régimes, both German and Italian, exploited
the most personal and therefore the most inviolable
of the assets usually possessed by adult : the short
time, after their day's work in the fields or the
workshop is done, when they are free to think.
By seizing upon this modest possession, those ré-
gimes managed to change rest into meetings, amuse-
ment into hypnotism, education into propaganda
and propaganda into drill.
There was in this totalitarian activity a sort of
obscure return to the cynical phrase of the Roman
Emperors, "panem et circenses" : a principle of
government the mere ment'on of which would
, warrant a protest. Those leisure hours of the
worker's life that we would like to see filled with
understanding and beauty, with truth and poetry,
are so hard-won that to use them for the purpose
of inoculating him with the drug of mass adulation.
to which all demagog'es resort when thev set out
to anaesthetize their followers, must be considered
as a breach of trust.
To rescue the adult from the third-rate pleasures in
which his wages sometimes enable him to indulge is of
course an excellent motive. But the more excellent the
motive, the more heinous would be the deception if that
motive were invoked with the object of regimenting the
worker's spare time after having ordered his day's work.
There can be no question of substituting for drinking and
gambling the political dance before the tribal gods.
We have seen with our own eyes what H. tler
and Mussol1ni made of the"Dopclavoro" : frenz : ed
masses caught up in noisy, estentatious celebrations.
in aggressive parades \'. hich were bound to end
in the bloody nightmare of war.
THE aim of our Congress is entirely different.for we are convinced that to educate is to
liberate. We hope for no better result from
our work than the awakening in the conscicusness
of every adult of an awareness both of his personal
responsibility and of his
fellowship with the whole the v : hole

ARELY has this loneliness been so formidable,I< so complete and so unrecognized as m n the

youth comes to know himself more with every
adventure in which his fceLngs or his intellect are
involved, ar. d rejoices, sometimes even in spite of
sorrow, in his discovery of himself. But the adult
has no place of refuge. Cut off from others of his
generation by the relentless uniqueness of his
destiny, and from his own conscience by his fear
of seeing himself in it as he res. Uv is, stripped of
all gloss or illusion, the adult has only two courses

himself from the multitude, or to give up his
individually and to submit to the impersonal will
of the masses. Even for the genius, absolute lone-
liness is a termless punishment. What then shall
we say of the absolute loneliness of the ordinary
man ? Yet his merging in the mass would mean
no less than a cruel renunciation of his very nature
as a man.
In face of this loneliness or this renunciation,
adult education should be based on the idea that

- the brotl1erhood of human destiny. At bottom,
it is a question not so much of teaching the adult
such and such an art or such and such a science,
as of instructing him in a much vaster subject,
which we foolishly imagine he has already master-
ed-life itself.

crcwd.
In both cases the lack of true culture is obvious
for, in both, contact between I fe and the intellect
has been severed. On the one hand, ignorance on
the part of the masses : on the other, anaemia
among the elite. All the same, such a situation has
iis precedents. In sturdy periods of history, when.
the community is undeniably healthy, culture seems
to men to be an essential part of their system : it
is a manifestation of their being and derives its
lustre from that very fact. To be beautiful, it has
only to meet its problems boldly and solve them
or : ginally, frankly and satisfactorily. But in periods
of moral upheaval culture becomes an ornament
and gradually ceases to be a vital function. In
architecture, as in literature, it aspires to be no
more than a luxury. It becomes a mere decoration,
a flower without roots in society. But a culture
must be judged r. ot by the distance separating it
from the people that produced it. but by the
strength and depth of its roots. In the last resort.
our civilization will be judged according to the
services it has rendered to man, the extent to
which it has made him conscious of his rights, and
the way in which it has taught him to co-operatewitch all his fellow-men in an atmosphere of peace,
which can only be ensure through intelligence
guided by the sense of Justice and faith sustained
by beauty, truth and virtue.

Education f or ResponstbuMty
WHAT I have just said indicates the
peculiar importance which I attach to
your deliber tions. When you r  discus-
sing adult education, you are in fact discussing no
less a matter than the future of our civilization.
Do we want to educate people for obedience ? Do
we want to educate them for responsibility ? Are
we going to educate the masses as if they were
8-uniform conglomeration in which individuals are
swallowed up ? Or are we going to educate them as
a. group of living beings in which the freedom of
the individual comic'pence to develop is not restricted
by the group mind ? Do we claim to relieve man's
isolation by accustoming him to blind sublr. ission
to the will of the herd ? Or do we wish to bring
him to take a conscious part In a culture which,
while having regard for his personality, will inspire
in him a sincere desire to be one with all his
fellows ?
If we decide in favour of education for respon-
sibility. we shall have chose ; 1 the more difficult but,
as I believe, the only true road. There is no better
remedy for the terror of so'itude than the principle
Of the universal responsibility of man on earth.
"Each of us is responsible for everything to every ne
else", is one of Dostoyevsky's most profoundly
penetrating remarks. Let us make no mistake. If
we choose education for responsibility, we automa-
tically demand a culture based up ; 1 the sense of
responsibility. Such a choice involves more than
what we have to discuss at this Conference ; it calls
for efforts from others than teachers alone.
All forms of human activity are concerned-politics and
ergonomics as well as science and art. When the people
agitate for better organization of work, t fairer distribu-
tion of property, and equality of opportunity, they are,
or course, struck" : for the improvement or their material
A Gleam of Hope
MAN is primary a social being ; he cannottherefore be considered apart from thecommunity to which he owes his upbring-
ing. Now. in the present day, whether he
likes it or not, the community is world-wide. It
therefore imposes, and will continue to impose,
ever widening duties. The contrast between the
number and extent of su : h duties, on the one hand,
and the misunderstanding and hatred we see, on
the other, is so cruel that pessimism would be
justified, if there were not to be seen amid the
chaos one gleam of hope-the hope that at last
a living culture will be established, in which the
masses can have a share although the rights of
the individual are not abated, and in which,
similarly, the individual wi ! ! not appear as the
selfish beneficiary of an inheritance which he
receives as a free gift a uses irresponsibly, but
as Hw essential instrument of the moral solidarity
of mankind.
World-wide aims and freedom in the means of
obtaining them seem to me to constitute the two
guiding rules in any action to foster, by universal
education, a type of culture in which the motive
principle is personal responsibility.
The developments of the first stage of industrial
expansion was facilitated by primary education for
the masses. We must not forget that fact.
It is part. ieularly siKnificant, as aduIteducatlon-wbfch
only the most favoured countries are as yet entitled to

of the world. at the stage of heroic literacy campaigns
Another reason for remember)", it is that there are dill
people who wonder whether primary education for the
proletal'iat Is danrerous. And above all we must remember
it because the real danger would be to limit our training
of the peoples of the future to the imparting of the
rudimentary knowledge implied in the teaching of reading
and writing.
In the present day world, technical skills are
becoming n`_ghly complex and the desire for
universality grows ever more urgent. Civilization.
can only progress if the masses are trained
systematically and cohere : 1t : y for the task before
them. That is the ultimate aim of adult education.
It is nor exaggeration to say that it is awe-inspiring.
IL ADIES and Gent : emen, in the last few monthsmany voices have been raised to reiterate
that peace is essential. Some people have
been concerned because Unesco has not added its
voice to those others. Such a concern is unfounded.
for if ever any international institution was inspir-
ed with a sincere determination to secure peace,
it 1S the Organization which we established in
London in 1945 to promote understanding ; betwee
all the nations through education, science and
culture. It is not Unesco's business to make
speeches about peace ; it is the Organization's duty
to work silently and modestly to ensure that the
spiritual ! conditions in the world are such that men
may build the peace, and build it advisedly, for
the advancement of justice, good and progress.
Unesco is glad that so many of you have come
to this meeting at Elsinore. Personally, when I
express, on behalf of the Organization to the
authorities and the people of Denmark the deep
gratitude they reserve for the warm welcome they
have given this Conference, I also thank you for
your help and hope most sincerely that your discus-
sions will be crowned with success.

Basic Principles
The Elsinore Conference approved a Hun :-
ber of"basic principles on which adult edu-
cation movements in all countries should be
agreed". Among these we quote the follow-
ing :
1."We must encourage the study and dis-
cussion of controversial questions, recog-
nizing that it is not so important to secure
agreement as to establish firmly the right
of minorities to disagree. The lite and breath
of adult education must depend upon full
freedom oj thought and discussion.
2. Platitudes cannot solve the deep-seated
suspicion between countries in the East and
West of Europe, and the adult education
movement must remain above the party
po : itical conjlict. It must not give up hope
oj a reconciliation and ought to be the bridge
by means oj which this can be achteued. An
adult education movement based upon a
reasoned and objective approach to world
problems should be able to make a unique
contribution to international understanding.
3 The nations cannot, in their own inter-
ests, any longer afford to leave the German
people outside the European family. the
(conference) believes that Unesco has a spe-
cial duty in this respect. Post-war Germany
has, indeed, a valuab : e contribution to make
to adult education and with encouragement
and understanding this may be guided into
channels which would be of benejit to all.
100 Years of the Danish
Folk Hugh School Movement
(Continued from Centre Page)
University teachers also took up
the idea, about the beginning of
the present century, of forming
what is called a"folk-university."
To all parts of the country, es-
pecially the towns, they sent out
lecturers to teach history, litera-
ture, art, economics and the na-
tural science. This teaching was
of an intellectual, scientific and
international character, and cor-
responded well with the atmos-
phere of the early labour move-
ment.

(Continued from Pace 5)..
One of the basic resolution, ; passed by
the Conference calls on Unesco to set up,
an, the earliest possible moment, a Consul-
tative Committee on adult education to
act in an advisory capacity to the Adult
Education Division of Uneseo, and to
carry out the recommendations of the
Elsinore Conference.
"... If the aims of this Conference and
of Unesco are to be achieved", the resolu-
tion states,"there must be developed an
effective writ-wide adult education move-
ment... How,'ver, at this time it would be
premature f r the Conference to recom-
mend the establishment of a permanent
world organization for adult education.
"ion order to realise the aims of Unesco
and to carry out the r,"Commendations of
the Conference (it is suggested) that
machinery be established'or securing can-
operation among the organization and
leaders of adult education throughout the
world. It is recognized that any suah ma-
th'nervy should at this time function
through and use the facilities of Unesco."
Seminars Urged
th. second important resolution voted
A'-bey the Conference stressed the im-
portance, for adult education move-
ments throughout the world, of setting up
international seminars which would study
particular topics in the field of adult
education."This we regard as a func-
tion of Unesco", the resolution states,
"and we strongly recommend that
Unesco be urged to organized a seminar
forthwith, to be held if possible in 1950.
The topics requiring most urgent consider-
ation are in our view. the study of inter-
- tional relations or of some specific
international problem, and methods and
techniques in adult education."
To facilitate the circulation of mate-
rial between one country and another,
the Elsinore Conference on Adult Educa-
tion asked Unesco to act as a central
focal point in receiving publications and
providing a regular abstracting service,
condensing, translating, and disseminat-
ing information on adult education activ-
ities.
In addition, the deleates approved a
resolution recommending the publication
by Unesco of a Bulletin on the latest
developments in adult education."The
dissemination of news about fresh
developments in adult education", the
resolution reads,"could best be under-
taken by the periodical issue of a Bulle-
t'n. If such a Bulletin could be issued
not less than quarterly, the information
< ! ont. a. inro therein could be used by the
national journals published b\'adult edu-
cational bodies and disseminated over a
wide international field.
Missions
THER programmes recommended bythe Conference call for the sending
of missions from countries with a
rich experience in adult education to
countries where it is less developed. For
particular types of adult education, such
missions might be organized by the adult
education bodies working in that special
field. For adult education ; n general, the
Conference agreed, the responsibility
should be with Unesco.
As a project requiring long-term plan-
ning, the delegates agreed that Unesco
should seek to serve adult education by
the translation and production of existing
significant material in various languages.
The Elsinr.'e Conference also recom-
mended the extended use Jf radio in each
country to provide instruction in foreign
languages, emphasized the part played by
museums and libraries in adult education
work, and agreed that science, in the
widest sense, had an important part to
play in adult education programmes, par-
ticularly as regards the neej for explain-
ing the social implications of science on
modern society.
Living Culture
I.-J EFORE the close of the Congress. inIJ a spec : al broadcast from Denmark
to the peoples of all Spanish speak-
ing America, M. Torres Bodet eloquently
summed up the fundamental meaning of
the Elsinore meetings.
"What the distinguahed educators here
assembled are really do. ng in planning in-
ternational co-operation in adult educa-
tion", he said,"is to lay the foundation for
a new way of life in better soc : al condi-
tions, in which Man, bringing a sound and
conscious technique to the services of his
social instincts, may profitably cultivate
the single smiling field of brotherhood
and peace.
"Today all true culture must spring
from life itself. A living culture has its
roots primarily in the life of the in-
dividual and thereafter in the life of
society and of the world. The assumption
that even the humblest of men may be
enabled to attain to fuller and deeper liv-
ing through science, philosophy or art, ac-
cording to his circumstances, is a new
approach. Culture is the road to an art
of shelf-expression and an art of execution...
Adult education-living culture-helps
each worker to live his life by giving him
the means of becoming more fully a
man..."
building the Workers'Educa-
tional Association. Soon after, it
founded a labour high school, not
in competition with the Grundt-
vig folk high schools, but as a
departure of its own.
But here we meet a curious
fact, indicative. perhaps, of an
esseatial factor in the Danish
mind. Although the old folk high
schools and the labour high
schools were founded and run
from quite different sources of
inspiration : one of them national
and Christian, the other, inter-
national and rational, one thing
soon proved to be common to
both-the singing of songs both
at the beginning and end of a
lecture and even between lessons.
Perhaps this habit is some-
this : 1g peculiar to Danes, expresaed
by the Danish word"stemning"
(the same as the German"Stim-
mung"). I don't know if there
is an exact equivalent in English
or French, but the English word
"tune"is perhaps the nearest.
You can tune an instrument,
and so you may "tune " an
audience, and the result is
what we call"stemning".
This implies both the method
and the result ; not only the har-
mony. but also somethine which
creates a feeling of communal
spiritual unity : a sentimental
thing, but still relevant in educa-
tional matters. The sonbook has,
therefore, shown itself to be an
essential instrument in all adult
education.
THE HYMNS OF GRUNDTVIGs
THE DANISH"ALL SONG"
THIS was U : 1doubtedly aheritage from the old
prophet Grundtvig. From
the folk high schools, the song-
books have spread to the evening
schools, the professional schools
of agriculture and arts and crafts.
nay even to political meetings
and youth organizations.
So, in the humilating days of
the Nazi occupation, after the
9th or April 1940. the first strong
uniting force of national self-
confidence came from sonp ; s. In
the summer or 1940, people
gathered around platforms, in
thousands and in hundreds of
thousands, sining the national
hymns and, not least, the hymns
or Grundtvig. For farmers, com-
ing from centres teaching Gundt-
vig's ideas, it was of course na-
tural, and soon the workers too,
adopted the same procedure. It
is no exaggeration to say that the
"All-song."as we called it. united
all classes and laid the founda-
tion for active resistance later on.
Therefore, I am not using empty
phrase when I say that during
the first phase of occupation it
was the traditions of Danish
adult education which more than
anything else helped to unite the
Danish nation in our distress and
wretchedness.
And in the 1941-1942 session of
Parliament, under the Minister or
Education, Jorgen JorKensen, we
passed a series of bills concern. ing
folk high school, evening schools,
agricultural schools and schools
for young unskilled workers with
the determinate purpose of laying
a new beoad foundation for free
adult education. On one point
there was much hesitation, and
perhaps this conferenoe may give
us good advice in this respect-
namely, on the Question of schools
for young unskilled workers.
Should they be compulsory or
not ? The Danish parties. were
divided on this point, and the
non-compulsory system was final-
ly adopted. But as the results
achieved during the last six years
have not been convincing, I have
felt obliged to appoint a commis-
sion, including parliamentarians,
to re-examine the questions in.
this field of adult education.
Now I have come to the end
of this brief survey of the Dariish
problems of adult education, but
I haven't, of course, dealt with
the questions of school and pro-
fessional education in our coun-
try.
THE PRISONER AND BOLGER :
THE IRON-CLAD MEN
II SHALL conclude by tellingyou a legend of one of the
ancient inhabitants of this
castle. Here, say the saga, deep
in one of the underground cellars,
sits the old hero Holger Danske.
who is said to have fought by
the side of Charlemagne as Ogier
Ie Danois. When he grew old he
did not d. e but went underground
into the vaults of Kronborg with
his iron-clad men, and there he
sits. leaning his arms against a
stone table, which his long white
beard covers completely.
Only one human being has ever
seen Holger. The was a prisoner,
condemned to death, who, in
order to save his life consented
to climb down the narrow steps
to find him. This he did, awaken-
ing Holger. who stretched out his
hand to greet h : m. The prisoner
did not dare to seize his hand,
but held out an iron stick. And
luckily too. For Holger Danske
pressed the st'ck so hard that his
fingers left their mark on it. And
thus the wretched prisoner escap-
ed. The legend ends as follows :
One day when Denmark is on the
brink of destruction, Holger
Danske will spring to his feet and
with his iron-clad followers will
reappear to the rescue of Den-
mark.
NO WHITE BEARD
*w HIS old legend has been toldto all Dan : ash children and
ever since Grundtvig, it has
been repeated thousands of times
in Danish folk high schools. But.
ladies and gentlemen, in the time
of emergency during the Nazi
occupation, with its humilation of
our country, when we older people
had to endure this, like Hamlet,
the only thing we could do was
mutter strange things after the
murder of freedom. then Holger
Danske reappeared. He came
back in a way we had not
expected and in which all of us
did not always agree, but reap-
pear he did, as the resistance
movement wa, ; ; sweepin the coun-
try from Skagen to Gedser. And
it turned out that Holger had no
white beard at ail. but that he
and his guard were all of them
quite young men.
As in the"All-song". I spoke of
before, we saw the outburst of
Danish popular education from
the folk high schools and the
evening schools, so in the resis-
tance movement, we met the
anonymous forces of youth, young
men and women, rallying around
the ideals of freedom and demo-
cracy, with which they were im-
bued.
In promoting peace, which is
the goal and ideal of Unesco, we
must take care of thee anony-
mous idealistic forces of youth ; it
is our duty to support them. to
make use of them and to Will
their confidence. This need can
only be filled by the means of
adult education.

ing held at Unesco House from June 2 ()
to 24.
The extensive preparation made by
Unesco for this conference and the par-
ticipation of 147 specialist from 29 coun-
tries, who represented 24 world scientific
organizations, clearly demonstrated the
international importance of the problem.
This point ways stressed by M. Torres
Bodet, Director-General of Unesco'when,
at the close of the conference, he praised
the delegates for the steps they had
taken to ensure"better international cho-
ordination of abstracting services".
"It is in the very mterests of peace",
he sa : d,"to prevent the sciences from
isolating themselves in special watertight
compartments."
THE conference. which was underthe chairmanship of the soli'd
British scientist. Dr. Alexander
King, recommended as one of its steps.
the creation of a number of committees
to be responsible for coordination of
science abstracting services in different
countries or regions and in the various
specialized fields.
The main task of the regional com-
mittees would be to ensure the proper
abstract : ng and indexing of scientific
works published in these regions and see
that scientists working there can obtain
abstracts of articles published abroad.
Already, a regional committee has been
set up in. Britain. Recently, a British
scientist, Professor Sampson Wright,
made the interesting suggestion that, in
addition, national committees be [ !'Ì up
to undertake the abstracting of scientific
art : cles published in their own country
THE ROLE OF SCIENTIFIC-.,
ABSTRACTING JOURNALS
(l'r HE scientist is a person with
,, unique requiremEnts as regards
M the dissemination of information.
Whether he be a bacteriologist or phy-
biologist or chemist working in a labora-
tory. or a field worker, such as a geologist
or an expert in tropical medicine, his
efforts, if successful, result in the dis-
covery of new facts of value to mankind.
Yet his discovery, great or small-his ad-
dition to the stockpile of man's knowledge
- would be ineffective and useless unless
communicated to his fellow-scientists.
If. for example, his work results in the
discovery of a new antibiotic substance
useful to medicine in the treatment of a
tropical disease, it becomes immensely
important that all physicians and health
officers in the tropics, wherever the
disease may exist, be promptly informed.
No one knows how many scientists are
at work in the world's laboratories and
field stations. No one knows how many
scientific reports are published. The esti-
mates of experienced documentalists and
librarians vary greatly.
r ONSERVATIVELY it has been
M, estimated that at least 750. 000 re-
ports (scientific papers) are pub-
lished annually-and some authorities
place the number as high as 2. 000. 000
annually. Some of these research reports
appear as technical books, dissertations,
and bulletins. but mostly they appear as
articles in scientific periodicals, and such
per : oaicals number possibly 50. 000. No
library possesses all of them. hence, inter-
library borrowing and the distribution of
photographic copies of documents are im-
PQrtant features in the dissemination of
information among scientists.
The process of discovery itself is enor-
mously facilitated by information passed
on from one research worker to another.
An item of information possessed by a
bacteriologist in Prague may prove to be
precisely the item required by a researcher
in New Yolk to bring his experimentation
to a successful conclusion.
The attack of science upon the evils of
disease and malnutrition and poverty
could be immensely facilitated if more
effective devices were available to promote

the dissemination of information and the
sharing of experience.
The sheer magnitude of the published
record of the sCIences is perhaps the
greatest impediment to its effective use.
A man undertaking research on the con-
trol of typhus, if he attempted to read all
that h ; s fellow-scientists engaged on the
same and similar problems were pub-
lishing, might spend all his waking hours
locating and reading the published record
- and still miss important information.
"w 0 conserve the researcher's time formore productive labour. yet g. ve him
full information as to the progress
others are making, scientists of many
nations h ve developed organizations for
the perusal and abridgement or"abstract-
ing"of scientific reports in the various
departments of science. These organiza-
tions, known as abstracting or indexing
services, are usually non-profit organiza-
tions set up by scientific bodies, sometime. s
assisted by goveu-nmental subsidy. Typi-
cally they consist of research workers or
members of university faeuities. working
on a part-time basis, gratis or for merely
nominal compensation, reading and
abridging the scientific papers in their
own fields of competence for the benefit
of their fellow-scientists.
Many of the abstracting services employ
highly trained specialists to evaluate as
well as to abridge the reports assigned to
them for study. Since scientific papers in
large number appear in languages not
commonly understood, as Finnish. Hun-
garian, Turkish, Arabic and Japanese.
many of the abstracting services emu ; soy
scientists who are also skilled linguists
to abstract such papers in the languages
more commonly in use.
T HERE are several hundred such
abstracting services m existence at
the present time. Some are local. or
restricted to the service o ! & limited.
branch of knowledge ; others are far-
flung organizations with thousands of
readers and scores or even hundreds of
part-ume editors. Accordmg to a survey
recently carried out by the International
Federation for Documentation, there are
font-two such services publishing 4. 000 or
more abstracts per annum. Many fields of
research lack such services, others ace
poorly served. Scientists and documental-
ists generally agree that scarcely any
domain of man's knowledge is adequately
served, and that improvement and ex-
tension of the abstracting and indexing
services is imperative if important ad-
vances are not to be wasted and remain
unused.
Scientist of all nations, Unesco and
mankind generally, have an important
stake in this process of the publication of
whatever is discovered In the laboratories
throughout the world. Speed in the publi-
cation dissemination and application of
whatever is new is of the utmost im-
portance, in medicine, in public health, in
agriculture, in chemistry, and in fact in
all the disciplines in which scientists are
working. The stockpile of man's recorded
scientific knowledge, increasing daily.
must be freely available to all who need
the information it contains.
which would be of interest to other
countries.
"This system", wrote Dr. Therese Grivet
in a detailed report specially prepared
at Unesco's request for the conference,
"already appears to be work : ing in
Switzerland. Italy, Hungary. Finland,
Norway and South America and should
be extended and generalized."
The purpose of the specialized com-
mittees would be the international co-or-
dinaLon of abstractmg Sei'v : ces deaJlng
with the pure and applied sciences,
physics and the engineering science,
chemistry and agricultufe. Other special-
ized committees, to cover abstracting ser-
vices in such fields as mathematics and
crvstallography, might also be set up later
on if It were found desirable. The con-
ference suggested that Unesco and the
International Scientific Unions help in
setting up these committees.
In suggesting this procedure, the dele-
gates pfobably recalled the excellent re-
sults already obtained by the co-ordinat-
ing committee on medical and biological
abstracts.
Indeed, before the conference came to
an end. a 16-man committee of physical
scientists was officially set up along the
lines of the medical and biological
abstracting committee.
Publication of General Journal
lr HE conference also called for thepublication of a gener l abstracting
journal for both pure and applied
physio, under the auspices of a single
internationally controlled organization.
The delegates recommended"that a com-
mission composed of representatives of
organizations now responsible for publish-
Jl1g abstracts (including the Institution of
Electrical Engineers and the American
Phys_cal Society) and representatives of
interested international scientific unions,
be convened for carrying out thIS pro-
ject".
Perhaps one of the most important
resolutions passed by the Conference on
Scientific Abstracting, calls on all scien-
tific periodicals to publish synopses In
English or French of original articles in
all languages appearing in their publica-
tions. This scheme, which has already
been applied by a number of scientific
periodical, would, if adopted universally.
have far-reaching consequences in speed-
ing up the time required for publishing
abstracts. This factor would be parCcu-
lazily appreciated by scientists in the
midst of specific research tasks.
'Who's Who'in Abstracting
THE delegates suggested, finally, thatstandard termmology and present-
tion be adopted by all abstracting
journals, and pointed to the need for
publishing a complete directory ot in-
dexing and abstracting serv. ces. contain-
ing hsts of all periodicals abstracted by
the various services. This would be the
f : rst'Who's Who", as it were. in abstract-
ing ever produced.
Though scientific abstracting remain
a complex and difficult problem, appre-
ciable improvement in the services can
be achieved through intecnat : onal action,
a, he Unesco-sponsored conference una-
nimously agreed at its final meeting. For
it is this common effort that will ulti-
mately put an end to the shortcomings
of present-day abstracting services, ar. d
eliminate the barriers which seriously
hamper scientific research in many coun-
tries of the world.
During the period of the conference, an
exhibition to both delegates and the gen-
eral public, portrayed the major problems
of scientific abstracting. Diagrams, photo-
graphs and charts dealt with the func-
tioning of abstracting and documenration
services, as well as the difficulties involv-
ed in their publication and distribution
in different languages. Aids to abstracting
on display included microfilm cameras
and readers, and devices for the mechan-
ical selection of documents.

10 UNESCO COURIER July 1949
Unesco Maps Aid Plan
. ST month, the Unesco Courier
published an account of the
broad UN plan to use more
than $ X5. 1) 00, 000 in two ycars
/or technical assistance which
had been outlined in a report
issued by the United Nations
at Lake SM ; csss.
Unesco's partic'patzon in the
joint plan was approved in its---
entirety by the Executive Board ar its meeting in Paris
on June 10. The Executive Board appointed a five-
member wor/dng party to aid the Director-General in
drafting a special programm. e and budget which will be
subs, pitted to the General Conference in September.
In view of the importance of this subject, the Unesco
Courier is devoting this page to a summary af the
proposals adopted by the Execut"ve Board for Unesco's
Iparticipation in the technical aid programme. Unesco's
plan provides for an e5timated budget off. $ 6, 150, 000 101'
the first year and $ 10, 703, 500/or the second year.
Under the extended programme of technical assistance
it will be for the recipient countries to determine in what
particular fields they want help. Unesco, therefor, has
presented the general yields in which it is competent to
give technical aid and the methods which it is ready to
use in giving such assistance.
I.-TECHNICAL EDUCATION
ANY economic development scheme that sets out really
to help an under-developed country to do something
for itself, will. sooner or later, lose its impetus if it does
not incorporate a scheme for educational development.
Most economically under-developed countries have in-
adequate systems of education, and few of them will oe
able. without technical help from outside, to keep pace
with the demands for skilled personnel that a successful
economic plan will create.
The first educational demands from economic develop-
ment schemes are likely to be for technical education.
Help and advice will be asked for at all levels, from
training III elementary handicrafts to the education of
engineers and other specialists in technological institutes.
Many under-developed countries have no knowledge,
personnel, or traditions with which to build up a technical
school system adequate to their growing needs, and want
help in such matters as organization, equipment, textbooks
and technical periodicals, the training of teachers, curri-
cula. teaching methods, the use of audio-visual aids, and
the integration of technical schools with industry. Unesco
is qualified to advise on the establishment within the
education system of laboratories and"shops"for the
practical tfaining of engineers and other higher technical
staff, and on their relationships to Universities.
II.-ELEMENTARY EDUCATION
*W ECHNICAL education worthy of the name is impos-M s. ble unless b sed on efficient and widespread ele-
mentary education. Few under-developed countries are
capable of profiting, without expert help, from the hard-
won experience that other countries have gathered in
this field over the past hundred years. They commonly
need advice, not only on such relatively concrete matters
as schcols buildings and equipment and school administra-
tion and finance, but also on the more subtle problems
that arise when a community begins to change its way of
life and when a school system tries to break away from
sterile formalism and to adapt itself to those chang : ng
needs. Many under-developed areas are in desperate need
of assistance on teaching methods, textbooks, curricula and
the training of teachers. It is rare for a narrow and
formal school system to produce educators who are
capable, unless helped from the outside, of adapting their
schools readily to the changing demands of the economic
and social system.

terials. diately above.
III.-FUNDAIUENTAL ADULT EDUCATION
- = CONOMIC devclopment schemes, however, can
IL rarely afford to wait for a new and educated genera-
tion to gr-ow up. An attempt must be made. to educate
adults. It is a fact that some two-thirds of the human race
are unable to read and write. Whilst bare literacy is not
the end and may not even be the beginning, of education,
yet the printed word is one of the most potent means of
conveying ideas and of stirring the sleeping minds of a
people. The mind of the illiterate is often closed to ideas
that may be essential to economic and political develop-
ment. Great advances have been made during this century
in methods of literacy teaching, but so slow and uncert3in
is the spread of educational methods that many illiteracy
campaigns are even now making use of methods that were
out-of-date thirty years ago. Technical assistance would,
in most cases, save time, money, and dreary, wasted effort.
Mere literacy teaching is not enough : education must
also develop. in both children and adults, the knowledge,
the skills, and the attitudes of mind that are essential
in any under-developed community that has to preserve
its values and learn to control its own affairs durin
a period of rapid economic expansion. With Unesco must
lie some of the responsibility for ensuring in any com-
munity a reasonably balanced development.
Uaesco is prepared to offer advice and assistance on
fundamental education services generally. Since its
t-staolishmen :. its has tried to make itself competent on
such matters a.. she conducting of illiteracy campaigns for
the improvement of health, of agricultural methods and

.,., IfEW subjects excite the imagination more than economic development,"said Willard L.
JB-Thorp, of the United States, at a meeting early this year of the Economic and Social
Council.
Technical assistance to under-developed countries, as a contribution to peace and stability,
became a subject of special interest when President Truman, in his Inaugural Address, listed it
among the four major points of a''Bold new programme for making the benefits of our scientific
advances and industrial progress available for the improvment and growth of under-developed
areas."
''More than half of the people of the world,"the United States President stated,"are living In
conditions approaching misery. Their food is inadequate. They are victims of disease. Their economic
life is primitive and stagnant. Their poverty is a handicap and a threat both to them and to more
prosperous areas.
"For the first time in history, humanity possesses the knowledge and the skill to relieve the
suffering of these p<, ople," he said, adding,"This should be a co-operative enterprise in which all
nations work together through the United Nations and its Specialized Agencies... It must be a
world-wide effort for the achievement of peace, plenty and freedom."

bye dependent upon the close co-operation of s ; ster agencies
with special competence in health, agriculture and in-
dustry. In return, Unesco hopes to be able to assist other
Agencies with the educational and materials needed for
their work.
UNESCO METHODS : Explora-
tory missions, advisers, feUows-
ships. demonstration areas, pu-
blications, research exhibitions
and clearing-honse services.
PAST EXPEDIENCE : Unesco',
experience in this field is wide.
It has sent exploratory mis*
sions and advisers. organized
pilot projects, conducted semi-
nars and conferences, produced
exhibits and publications, and
carried on extensive clearings-
house services.
IV.-MASS COMMUNICATIONS AND EDUCATION
MATERIALS
IF HERE is serious need for research into the use ofN books, fiims, film-strips, the press and the radio, in
the service of economic deve : opment schemes. These are
powerful media, which have, up to the present, been
very largely neglected for th's purpose. Even the printed
word has only in relatively rare instances, been adapted
to the needs of under-developed peoples ; the number of
really good books and pamphlets specially written for
them is surprising : y small.
The film, film-strip, and radio seem to be ideally adapted
to the purposes of winning popular support in under-
developed communities. But the techniques involved are
extremely difficult : even the adaptation of the press to
the needs of the barely literate is by no means simple.
Most under-developed countries will need outside assis-
tance if they are to make much progress in the use of
these media.
UNESCO METHODS : Advisers,
research and production cen-
tres, demonstration areas, semi-
nars and other training meth-
ods.
PAST EXPERIENCE : Unesco is
making rol1ectif) n of books and
pamphlets produced throughout
theworldforuseinunder-deve-
loped areas, and is already
supporting two relatively small-
scale regional experiments in
the production of books, films
and film-strips for fundamental
educative campaigns.
V.-TECHNICAL NEEDS FOR PRESS, FILM AND
RADIO
MANY under-developed countries, however, have more
material difficulties to overcome before they can
make full use of mass media. Th ? y lack the equ : pment,
materials, any personnel to develop the us- of the press,
film and radio in the service of economic development
and education. Many of them have most inadequate
resources in such materials as paper and film stock, and
such equipment as flat-bed presses, linotype machines,
typewriters and linotypes with letters in the alphabet
of the country, radio recording equipment. rad : o receiving
sets. cine-cameras, and film projection apparatus. Most
of them lack information about source of supplv of the
kinds of materials and equipment suited t.") their needs,
and about methods of training personnel.
UNESCO METHODS : Missions,
advisers, and CrIlowships.
PAST EXPERIENCE : Unesco
has made special studies in 4t
countries to obtain information
on the operation and needs of
the press, film and radio. It has
also gathered information on on
sources of supply of matetiat
and equipment and on methods
of train : n available in 1he more
highly developed countrie. and
has given information on these
matters in response to requests.
VI.-TRAINING OF TEACHERS AND OTHER
PERSONNEL
m tNESCO'S most extensive contribution to economicdevelopment will almost certainly been the training
of workers from under-developed countries in the fie : ds
of education, science, and the educational uses of mass
media. In fundamental education, for example, the
number of really skilled persons in the world is pate-
ticaJly inadequate ; and, in technical education, even the
most advanced countries are dangerously short of
teachers. The supply of scientific workrs for under-
deve : oped countries is equally insufficient for the task
ahead. The same applies to trained librarians and docu-
mentalists. When we turn to the radio and the film
we find even fewer people with the knowledge and skill
to use these media effectively in the service of economic
development.
An under-developed country can scarcely hope, without
assistance from the outside, to make much progress
towards meeting its needs for educators, scientists, and
technicians. It is for this reason that schemes of training
loom lacge in Unesco's plans for technical assistance.
Nearly every agency will need to make plans for train-
ing schemes within its own field of competence. Unesco
will have the additional duty of being a centre of in-
formation on training techniques in general.
UNESCO METHODS : Training
centres, feltowships and scholar-
ships, seminars and symposia.
demonstration projects, scientific
and industrial institutes.
PAST EXPERIENCE : Unesco's
experience covers : seminar.
symposia, fellowship, demons-
tration area, production cen-
tres, and the establishment of
one region at institute.
VII.-RESEARCH AND TRAINING LABORATORIES
18= CONOMIC development. s bound up with technical t
IL development and cannot be considered as durable if.
it is not backed by a certain amount of scientific and
technical research. This research serves a double purposes :
first, it provides for the necessary adjustment and amend.
ments to established techniques so that they can be
applied successfully under new conditions ; secondly, the
research laboratories provide the best kind of training tor
the highest technical staff and for future professors and
teachers in higher technical education.
The organization, equipment and programmes of the
laboratories must be very carefully planned by a team of
skilled scientists, whose services must be made available
over a considerable period.
UNESCO METHODS : Advisory
missions, Field Science Offices,
Fellowships, Scientific andTech-
nicaiResearchinstitutes.
PAST EXPERIENCE : Unesco't
field science offices have already,
within the limits or their powers.
given advice on the organiza-
tion of research laboratories.
Scientific Information
j
 ROGRAMME of economic development. will create a
18-'growling demand, in under-developed countries of
the world, for scientific information and liaison serv. ccs.
These can be most easily provided by international agen-.
cies. Information will be requested on scientific material
of all kinds, including material needed for scientific and,
technical teaching at every level and material for research
laboratories. There will also be a demand for information.
on scientific literature, and in most cases for the supply
of scientific books and journals and for advice on library
methods. These services will keep scientists and research.
workers within the regions in contact with recent deve. : gap.
ments in their respective fields throughout the wc'-Id.
A scientific information service has a second function,
that of helping the general public in an area to a deeper
understanding of the scientific principles and practices
that will play an increasing role in their lives as the
economic development scheme progresses. Without some
such education in the meaning and place of science in
everyday life. the inhabitants of an undeveloped area are
unlikely to be willing and intelligent participants in.
development schemes based on technical advances. Exh :-
bitions, pamphlets, science clubs and the like, will be
amongst the methods used.
UNESCO METHODS : Field
Science Offices, distribution
centres (nor books and period-
cats, advisory missions, publica-
tions and exhibitions.
FAST EXPERIENCE : Unesco
has had useful experienee in
these matters, through it field
science offices and its division
for scientific literature. The
book-coupon scheme has served
the same purpose,
VIH-REGIONAL PROBLEMS RAISED
BY INDUSTRIAL DEVELOPMENT
p OR many country, es economic development means
II some measure of industria) ization making for a more
complete use of all possible natural resources. The
earliest secondary industries to be developed will, in
general be those based on mining and agriculture. To be
really effective such industrialization necessitates an
inventory of all thy available natural resources, backed up
by a systematic study of the pecial problems encol'nte :-'e'd
in each type of area. Very often, local authoraies could
proceed with plans to develop these regions.
Economic development naturally produces quite dLf.
ferent problems in diiferent areas. These areas can be
classified in a small number of basic categories. The ism-
portant problems peculiar to each type of region need an
all-over scientific study in order that its economic develop-
ment can be founded. on a really sol. d basis of technical
knowledge. We can classify the regions as : the arid zone.
the humid tropical zone, the high altitude plateau, and
the coastal region. In each case it will be necessary tO

continent, to lift the veil of illiter-
acy and ignorance, will be provid-
ed by the R : o de Janeiro seminar.
The job, however, calls for some-
thing much greater than just
teaching the people how to read
and write. It means an effort
to raise the whole material, moral
and spiritual standards of these
people.
During the past several months,
in both North and South America,
groups and organizations have
been at work. in collaboration
with Unesco, preparing for the
big task ahead.
The Inter-American Institute of
Statistics has been preparing and
cho-ordinating statistics on illiter-
acy in 22 countries in order to
reveal the true face of the
situation in the Americas. WHO
and the Pan-American Sanitary
Bureau have been working on
health education for adults and
preparing an exhibition of fun-
damental education for health.
The Inter-American Institute of
Agriculture has been studying the
development of better farming
practices, while the ILO and the
Department of Economic and
Social Welfare of the OAS have
been at work on problems of
labour, co-operatives and housing.
The library division of the Pan-
American Union, which for the
past 60 years has accumulated
documentation on America, has
been studying the question of
spreading popular libraries.
Educators and scientists in both
Americas, universities in Mexico,
Brazil, Peru and the United States
have been tackling some of the
technical aspects of education.
And in all the countries of North
and South America, plans are
being pushed for the joint effort
which will be launched with the
Rio de Janeiro seminar. !

In 1920, out of every 100
Brazilians, 60 could neither read
nor write. The major campaign
launched in 1947. opened over
12, 000 schools within a few
months, with an enrollment of
one million students. The coun-
try saw the literacy campaign as
a tool for better health, better
farming and better living. Gcv-
ernment ministries, the nation's
press, private industry and the
intellectual leaders joined in the
movement. Thanks to the efforts
of men like Dr. Lourenco Filho,
Brazilian Minister of Education,
and one of the most outstanding
figures in the educational world
of Latin America ; Dr. Francisco
Jarussi ; Dr. Anisio Teixeira ; Dr.
F2rnando Tude de Souza and
others the illiteracy campaigns
have taken on the aspect of a
national crusstde.
Similar. efforts have been gain-
ing momentum in other parts of
Latin America. At the Rio
seminar, the nations of America
will present their experience.
their knowledge and their ma-
trials so that they can be made
available to all the countries for
the continent-wide drive.
Unesco. in co-operation with the
OAS. the Bureau of Currznt
Affairs in London. the Interna-
tional Bureau of Education, has
prepared extensive documentary
material for the seminar, includ-
ing a fundamental education
exhibit, and information on
audio-visual techniques and adult
education methods.
The Seminar on Illiteracy

delegates. were toM of practical
ways in which they can con-
tribute to the success of the
United Nations'work.
Representatives of 29 organiza-

status with Unesco were addressed
by Mr. V. Hercik, of Unesco's
Bureau of External Relations,
who suggested how they might
help the Organizatio : 1's work.
The results of t. these conferences
are among the items for con-

Two Unesco items proposed for
discussion concern plans for
celebrating"Human Rights"D-ay
on December 10. and the possibil-
ity of publishinl1 and distributing
pamphlets and books, particularly
in German and Italian, in those
states which are not members or

Unesco was represented at the
conferences by Dr Carlo a Prate,
Head of the Bureau of Public

dustrial problems.
IX.-PROTECTION OF LOCAL CULTURES
UNLESS education accompanies technolOl1 ; ical de-velopment programmes, the cultural values of a
country are almost necessarily undermined, and the
cultural values of the nation oc nations giving the assis-
tance are subtly substituted for them. But not any or
every form f education will avert this ev : I. Even educa-
tion can be a disruptive force unless it is geared to the
cultural and social needs of a particular people. Other-
wise, it can lead merely to the creation of a class of
uprooted intellectuals.
History furnished dramatic examples of societies thrown
into upheaval-sometimes with grave consequence for
the world-by unbalanced programmes of industrializa-
tion. The gravest examples come from lands where what
was mistakenly assumed to be"progress"was brought
from without.
Such examples make it obviously necessary to associate
with projects of economic development specialists with
experience in anthropology and sociology. Their advice
wit ! help to ensure that the economic development scheme
conform to the way of life valued by the people them-
selves The assistance of social scientists is obviously not
enough in itself to enable a scheme to avoid all the
risks inherent in major social change.
When a mission is sent to survey the technical needs
and problems of a given country, an expert should be
included in the team to conduct on the spot a survey of
the cultural and sociological factors involved and to call
attention to the sociological implications on the projected
assistance programme. The primary function of this
expert should be to advise on protecting the native
culhje, as the protection of national cultures is one
of Unesco's duties.
In addition to protecting the native cultures, the
services of experts can often be useful in stimulating
local industries based on native arts crafts. Technical
assistance need not and should not be a one-way process.
The under-developed areas have much to contribute to
the lest of the world, not only through increased pro-
duction in the economic field, but in the cultural field
as well. Already there is a considerab : e market in the
industrialized countries for the products off artists and
clafTsmen in certain of the under--developed areas. This
market could be greatly expanded if native artists and
craftsmen were taught to adapt their traditional tech-
niques and designs to fit trade needs in the industrialized
countries, without at the same time lower'. no the artistic
quality of their works. Preserving them not only helps
protect the culture as a whole, but also conserves
potential economic resource and ultimately makes
available to members of other cultures valuable items
in the general cultural heritage of mankind.
UNESCO METHODS : Use of
sociologists and anthropologists
and authorities on native arts
and crafts as members of expio-
ratory missions and as advisers
to lovernments engaging in
economic development schemes.

THE STORY
OF ANTONIO ARANGO
A Unesco'Food and People'Pamphlet
TAR. A V ELLER
approaching the
Colombian port
of Barranquilla
on the Carib-
bean Sea sees
Colombian soil
long before he
sights the coast.
The tropical
blue of the sea changes to yellow
as far as the eye can reach.
What gives lt its yellow colour ?
The port of Barranquilla lies on
the estuary of the River Mag-
dalena. A great river which rises
in the interior of Colombia and
flows for a thousand mites to
empty into the Caribbean Sea.
It is soil swept away for ever
by the Magdalena River which
gives the sea water that yellow
colour within a radius of some
miles round the Port of Bar-
ranquilla. Where does the soil
come from ?
It comes from the Magdalena
Valley and from the slopes of the
Andes enclosing the valley to the
east and the west. It has been
washed away by the rain and
borne down brooks, tributaries
and secondary rivers.
Part of it has been stripped by
the River Magdalena from its
own banks. The traveller notes
the yellow colour of the sea with-
out interest.

borne off by
the river, g"ve
their fertility
tao plantations
of coffee and
bananas and to fields of maize.
ANTONIO ARANGO, whom I
knew in the Andean Cor-
dillera, was himself an
actor in the tragedy of the
vanishing soil, without under-
standing it.
Antonio Arango invested his
life-savings in the purchase of a
20-hectare parcel of land in the
Cordillera. The land was covered
'with"tall timber". which showed
the fertility of the soil."Where
such big trees grow, the soil is
goad", said Antonio to himself,
and he gazed with satisfaction at
the thick stratum of vegetable
top-soil which could be seen
in the cutting made by the brook.
The water of the brook was
crystal-clear as it flowed through
the under-growth of mosses and
parasitic plants ; so crystalline
that Anton. o aild his sons chris-
tened it"Diamond Brook". The
site was ideal for a house, with a
view over the whole landscape.
Antonio Arango sharpened his
axe and machete. Iron was to
conquer the woodland. His wife
and three sons aiding him he
toiled like a Colossus. The tall
trees crashed in thunder at the
stroke of the unweacying axe. The
timber could not be used because
there were no roads by which to
remove it nor neighbouring towns
to buy it. So Antonio Arango let a
few days'sunshine dry the tallen
trees and then set fire to them.
OTHER settlers were doingthe same m other parts of
the mountains.
The blaze was encrmous.
How the fallen giants crackled
in the fire and how the small
beasts and birds of the forest fled
before the flames !
At long last the ground was
cleared and Antonio Arango
sowed it with maize. On two hec-
tares he sowed forage for the cow.
He built a house on the high
ground. As his good wife had
worked SO hard, Antonio gave his
tanch a pretty name, La Isabela.
The first harvest was encourag-
ing. How tall, how thick, how
luxuriant were the maize stems !
Antonio was well pleased with his
efforts. So he went on sowing
maize. But things were changing.
DIAMOND BROOK, whichhad once been brimming
and crystal-clear through-
out the year, had shrunk to a
thread of water in summer-time.
In the rainy season it was a
yellow flood tearing loose rocks
and mud and lumps of soil The
harvests were growing smaller.
Antonio Arango sold the cow be-
cause the pasture was no longer
enough for it to live on. Things
were not going right at all.
One day. when he was sowing
maize, his mattock struck solid
rock. The vegetable top-soil had
become so thin that already rocky
outcrops were appearing every-
where. There was no money. n the
house. The children had nothing
to eat. Lastly, Diamond Brook
vanished and only its stony chan-
nel was left. Like so many other
settlers, Antonio Grange sought
another stretch of woodland to
begin again.
THIS little tragedy of AntonioArango is attaining natio-
nal, continental and world
proportions. It has been said that
every year Co-
lombia loses
the equi lent
of 10, 000 20-
hectares ran-
ches by soil
erosion. That
means that
every year
there are 10.-
000 families in
the same posi-
tion as the
Arangos.
Doctor H. H.
Bennett. the
North Amer-
ican apostle of soil conserva-
tion, claims that his country
has lost for ever 300, 000, 000 acres
by erosion, which is imperil : in
755, 000, 000 acres mare. Authorita-
tive writers have set out the
problem as it affects other na-
tions in different continents.
Nor is it simply a case of men
utterly losing their land. There
is also the case of the man who
lives wretchedly, toiling vainly on
impoverished land, faced with his
own ruin and the degeneration of
his race.
ON this page, we publish the first two chapters of
the manuscript entitled"The Story of Antonio Aran-
go", written originally in Spanish by Dr. GuilJermo
Nannetti for the Unesco"Food and People" pamphlet
and discussion series.
Dr. Nannctti tells the story of a farmer and his
family, who bought a rich plot of land in the high
Andean Cordillera of Colombia, only to see it rapidly
los its wealth because he failed to guard against soil
erosion. The tale is written for the peasants them-
selves who must be taught the save their land and
their food by applying the methods of modern agri-
cultural science. It is deliberately written at a very
different level from the usual academic article and
is in sharp contrast to most other pamphlets In the
series because of its simple, and yet highly poetic,
style.
Dr. Nannetti, who was formerly Minister of Na-
tional Education in Colombia, is a noted international
expert On fundamental and adult educaton. Last year,
he was Director of the Unesco Fundamental Educa-
tion Seminar held in Caracas. This month, he will
lead the working group on adult education at the
Rio d Janeiro Seminar on Illiteracy. He is also a
member of Unesco's Executive Board.
Arrangements have been made for the Spanish
version of the pamphlet to be published by Sud Amer-
icana Press in Buenos Aires. In the English edition,
published by the Bureau of Current Affairs, it is
known as "Alphabet of the Soit".
The"Food and People"campaign is exciting in-
terest throughout the world. It is to be discussed, for
example, at the French Association for the Advance-
ment of Science, meeting at Ctermont-Ferrand this
month, at the British Association for the Advancement
of Science, meeting in England in September, and at
the World Federation of United Nations'Associations
meeting in R4me in September.
. H toiled like a Colossus, felling the tall
trees"
HISTORY has shown us casesof whole civilizations
which felt with the im-
poverishment of the soil that
nurtured them. Classical Greece
was a country of woods. and
brooks. Carthage a zone of
forests and farm-lands. In desert
areas of North Africa men have
found the ruins of cities where
the archaeologist discovers traces
of wine and olive-oil industries.
Science notes similar facts regaa·d-
ing the great civilizations of Asia
Minor. There is no apparent reason
why the same fate should not
await the nations affected by
erosion today.
In some instances the process
of erosion is rapid and violent,
taking a few years only. as in the
case of Antonio Arango, with his
soil newly exposed to the action
of tropical rains.
Elsewhere the process is slow
and insidious and revealed only
by the gradual impoverishment
of the soil. and calcium deficiency
and degeneration in its inhabi-
tants. By the diminishing stature
of the new generations, dental
troubles. and the onset of diseases.
consequent on a cor. dition of
malnutrition and pauperism.
HOW THE SOIL VANISHES
The Story of a Grain
, o/Earth
ET us go back to AntonioArango. Wh t happened to
Antonio's land ? Why did
that good land bear several crops
of maize ? Why does the soil
which is left bear no crops ? And
why and how did the good earth
disappear ? Who stole the gocd
earth and with it the wealth,
well-being and future of Antonio
Arango and his sons ? What
happened to the brook ?
If only Antonio Arango had
been able to examine a small
grain of good soil through a mic-
roscope, he would have seen that
that soil did not consist merely of
symmetrical crystals, like earth
from the subsoil. No, indeed, the
good soil was something almost
alive. In it there were living, mov-
ing bacteria and animalculae.
ON the subsoil stratum, as inthe stony ground of : he
Gospel parable, the sown
seed dies. If it were not for its
covering of organic soil, our plant
would be as dead as the moon. As
dead as the areas of rocky desert
soil, whence the organic covering
has vanished, borne off by rain
and wind. As dead as"La Isa-
bela", Antonio Arango's land. Yet,
that organic soil, sole buckler
against the death of our plant, is
daily swept away through our cul-
pable thoughtlessness. But how
did the soil disappear ?
When Antonio Arango's land
was covered wah trees, the rain-
water, as it fell, struck the foliage.
trickled gently down branches
and trunks and soaked down
along the roots to the subsoil. The
gocd soil did not suffer a heavy
impact of water and the water it-
self accumulated in the subsoil.
And that was how Diamond
Brook, with its waters ever lim-
pid,was born.
But when Antonio Arango
stripped off the forest, the good
earth was left exposed, naked and
defenceless, to the impact of the
rain. Thus every heavy drop
struck a grain of good soil, as if
it had been a little hammer. The
impact of the railldrop dissolved
the grain of good soil and the
accumulated water flowed over
the slope, bearing off the soil
with it. In some instances small
threads of water developed, which
were positive brooklets and cut
themselves channels, wide clefs
in the soil."Diamond Brook is : n
floed and cannot handle all the
water,"Antonio Arango used to
say as he watched the turbid
torrent, muddy and swollen. He
did not know that Diamond Brook
was bearing off the good soil,
which was the source of his har-
vests, his wealth, his hopes and
the future of his sons.
WATER which sinks into the
subsoil is the sap of the
whole world. Rainwatr
flowing over the surface steals
away the top soil. Hence the im-
portance of trees. Vegetation is
like an umbrella protecting the
soil. It breaks the fall of the wa-
ter and causes it to sink intro the
subsoil. The forest is the mother
of the spring. The roots of the
trees are like friendly hands sus-
taining the topsoil with their
myriad fingers. Fallen leaves and
fruits fertilize the soil and build
up the vegetable humus. The
trees afford protection from the
wind, regulate humidity and give
shelter from heat and cold. They
prevent floods. They purify the
air. They can be an inexhaustible
source of profit to one who knows
how to cultivate and utilize them
wisely.
SCIENCE has conquered ero-scion. There is a body of sim-
ple techniques which prev-
ents the disappearance of the
good soil. If only someone had
taught Antonio Arango to drive
his furrows according to the con-
tour of the slope. To terrace the
steepest part of the slope. To cica-
trize the scars of erosion with
simple dams Of logs and stones.
If only someone had taught Anto-
nio Arango that maize is not the
right crop for sloping grcund and
that other better paying. crops
can be rotated instead. If only
someone had taught him to sow
the ground between his furrows
with suitable bushes to check the
movement of the soil.
And if only that could be made
to apply to all the Antonio Aran-
gas in his own country nd
throughout the werld ! To the
Smiths, the Chungs, the Abdullas.
the men of the soil in all lati-
tudes ! This is the theme which
Fundamental Education preaches
under the heading of Conserva-
tion of Natural Resources.
