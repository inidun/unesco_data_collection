Editorial
ÍÍL
ET's take science fiction out of the classroom
and put it back into the gutter where it
belongs".
These words, which participants at the founding meeting
of the Science Fiction Research Association, were astonished
to find scrawled up one day on a blackboard in their con¬
ference room, were a sardonic comment on the long struggle
of modern science fiction to emerge from the ghetto of the
luridly illustrated pulp magazines of the 1920s to the 1940s
to achievement of the status of serious literature.
We owe an incalculable debt to the men who founded and
wrote for these magazines, which the intellectual élite of the
day dismissed scornfully as no more than a new emanation
of the "gutter press".
Against all the odds, they persisted in what, ironically, can
now be seen as the educational mission of preparing the man
in the street for the incredible scientific progress of the twen¬
tieth century.
Whether we like it or not, we live in a century in which
scientific advance has become the dominant influence on our
lives and on the social fabric of our society. In the words of
Horace L. Gold, founding editor of Galaxy Science Fiction,
"Few things reveal so sharply as science fiction the wishes,
hopes, fears, inner stresses and tensions of an era, or deter¬
mine its limitations with such exactness".
As some of our contributors point out, the origins of
science fiction can be traced back to Antiquity. It is a genre
which covers a wide field embracing fantasy (including
monsters and aliens from space), "space operas" (the classic
Western film transposed to space), time travel, the coloniza¬
tion of space, catastrophes and a variety of Utopias, as well
as speculative prediction and extrapolation from hard scien¬
tific fact. It is with the two latter aspects that we are chiefly
concerned in this issue of the Unesco Courier, although we
could not resist including Kang You wei's late nineteenth-
century vision of a Utopian "Age of One World", or Isaac
Asimov's fascinating description of how he writes his best-
selling works of science fiction.
Like science itself, science fiction is the fruit of the im¬
agination. If today the reality of science may seem even more
incredible than the most fantastic inventions of science fic¬
tion, the two will continue to enrich and cross-fertilize each
other.
In today's world, science has made its presence felt in
every aspect of life, in art, in education and in social
organization. Science fiction's great achievement is to have
educated us to accept this powerful new influence, to have
warned us of its potential dangers and to have laid before us
all the immense possibilities it has to offer. Above all, science
fiction lays the bogey of science as an uncontrollable
Frankenstein by its constant reminder that the whole edifice
of science is built on the foundation of man's soaring,
limitless powers of imagination.

Science and science fiction
WHAT is science fiction? Prag¬
matically, it is what a pub¬
lisher puts out as science fic¬
tion. But as a purist I will quote from
my book The Cosmic Dancers a defini¬
tion that is particularly suited to the
purpose of this article.
"Science fiction is that class of fic¬
tion which contains the currents of
change in science and society. It con¬
cerns itself with the critique, extension,
revision, and conspiracy of revolution,
all directed against static scientific
paradigms. Its goal is to prompt a
paradigm shift to a new view that will
be more responsive and true to
nature".
As the definition implies, the impor¬
tance of science fiction arises from its
choreography of the dance between
science and reality; the best of science
fiction continually prods science
toward further discovery of the mean¬
ing of reality. "Do not adhere to fixi¬
ty", it seems to challenge. "The cur¬
rent paradigm, or world view, grew out
of the past and is only adequate for the
past; new ways are needed to tackle the
ever-unfolding present, let alone the
future."
Thus the modern science fiction1
writer envisions a future world in which
space travel is commonplace, a
universe in which life is known in other
star systems, cultures in which people
routinely communicate via telepathy
without sensory signals. Are such pro¬
jections legitimate challenges to our
science or mere fantasy? Certainly
there are fantasy elements that enhance
the story lines, but there are also some
profound challenges. A few examples
may be revealing.
In Ursula Le Guin's novel The
Dispossessed, the hero Shevek is a
scientist faced with the problem of im¬
proving communication between his
Co-explorers
home planet and its neighbour. He
responds by discovering the "ansible",
a machine that makes instantaneous,
signalless communication possible not
only between the planets of his con¬
cern, but with remote planets of the
galaxy as well.
In Ian Watson's novel Miracle
Visitors, the hero John Deacon in¬
vestigates sightings of UFOs, flying
saucers. He finds an unexpected
answer in the far reaches of his research
on the nature of human consciousness.
In Robert Silverberg's novel To
Open The Sky, the leaders of a new
scientific religion squarely fix the
priorities that are necessary to so meet
the threats of the present that they can
have a future. The priorities? to open
the sky and to open the mind.
In his novel Rendezvous with
Rama, Arthur C. Clarke beautifully
portrays an alien space colony. Implicit
is a challenge: will humans remain far
behind in that enterprise?
In The Black Cloud, author Fred
Hoyle depicts an alien life so fantastic
that it not only faces us with the poten¬
tial variety of extraterrestrial life, but
more importantly, it challenges us to
consider the whole question of the
origin and meaning of life.
In his novel Way Station, Clifford
Simak portrays a humanity on the
verge of a holocaust engendered by the
"terror" that man carries within him.
But the holocaust is avoided by a
transformation of man with the help of
a talisman and some wise intervention
from the galactic council. We intuit

ofreality
that the talisman, like the terror, may
lie within us, the touchstone for the
transformation of humanity.
Such scenarios call for a response
from science in vastly different direc¬
tions, from the outer reaches of space
to the inner reaches of the mind and
psyche of humankind. And in fact,
science has responded favourably to
challenges on both fronts; some of our
best minds are involved in serious fron¬
tiers of research today to open the sky
and to open the mind.
Princeton physicist Gerard O'Neill
originally suggested as a project in his
freshman physics course that the
students design a space colony. The in¬
itial results of this science-fiction ven¬
ture looked so good that the professor
himself began serious calculations. As
by Amit Goswami
a result, we now know that we actually
have the expertise and the raw
materials to build a space colony.
Perhaps the Soviet success with space
stations and the American success with
the space shuttle Challenger are the
first steps toward building our own
Rama.
And Carl Sagan has publicized the
continuing efforts of many serious
scientists in the area of CETI, com¬
munication with extraterrestrial in¬
telligence. Some answers and many
new questions, some examples of
which are noted below, are coming out
of these studies.
Although science fiction writers
and scientists alike have speculated for
decades about extraterrestrial in¬
telligence, there has until now been no

berg's film Close Encounters of the
Third Kind (1977).
direct evidence for even the existence of
planets outside our solar system. But
now new data pouring in from an
orbiting infra-red astronomical
laboratory are providing direct
evidence that perhaps as many as forty
nearby stars are surrounded by cosmic
dust in the early stages of evolution into
planets. Some of these, including one
in the Vega system that is popular in
science fiction, may very well develop
life-supporting environments.
In research carried out at the
University of Maryland, the meteorite
Murchison, that fell into Australia in
1969, was found to contain all five of
the chemical bases needed for human
genes. Does this provocative evidence
indicate that life may exist elsewhere in
the universe?
In a stranger-than-science-fiction
theory of the origin of life, astronomer-
science fiction writer Fred Hoyle has
revived with many new twists the
nineteenth-century panspermis theory;
this is the theory that there are "seeds"
of life continuously bombarding the
Earth and other life-supporting planets
that create and rejuvenate life. Hoyle,
a respected scientist, seems to go
beyond the challenge of science fiction
in his most recent book The Intelligent
Universe.
Science's efforts to open the mind
are not far behind the challenge of
science fiction either. In the mid-1970s,
two Stanford Research Institute
physicists, Russell Targ and Harold
Puthoff, conducted rigorous ex¬
periments on telepathy in which one
psychic draws a picture of a distant site
that he "sees" through the eyes of
another psychic who is present at the
site. Neither psychic knows in advance
what site is to be visited; actually, the
sites were chosen by a computer.
]]>

<page number="6">
<![CDATA[
Likewise, to ensure objectivity the
matching of the drawings and the sites
was done by judges who did not know
which drawings were done for which
sites. In more recent repetitions of this
experiment, which has been successful¬
ly replicated in dozens of independent
laboratories, the matching is being
done by a computer.
If we potentially have the telepathic
capacity that science fiction writers so
routinely see in our future, what is the
brain mechanism behind it? Premature
question? Hardly. In 1982, University
of Paris-Sud physicist Alain Aspect
and his collaborators demonstrated
conclusively that two photons objects
in the microscopic domain that obey
the laws of the new physics, quantum
mechanics can communicate at a
distance without exchanging signals.
This action at a distance, technically
called non-locality, is being heralded as
one of the fundamental properties of
quantum systems.
Could distance viewing be the result
of the brain's non-locality, a non-
locality that arises from a quantum
machinery that operates even at the
macrolevel of the brain's organization
that we call the mind? Many physicists,
among them Nobel laureate Eugene
Wigner, think that quantum mechanics
holds the key not only to our non-local
experiences such as telepathy, but also
to our consciousness itself. Some of the
new research in the frontiers of con¬
sciousness, reviewed in The Cosmic
Dancers, may truly be precursors of the
science of the twenty-first century.
Does this imply an ansible? Who
knows? But the new scientific model of
consciousness based on quantum
mechanics suggests that beyond our in¬
dividual I-ness, our ego-consciousness,
there may be a unitive, commonly-
shared primary consciousness, as fore¬
seen many years ago by Erwin
Schrödinger, the co-discoverer of
quantum mechanics; in his book What
Is Life? Schrödinger declared, "Con¬
sciousness is a singular". This message
from the new physics is clearly echoed
in the science fiction of Arthur C.
Clarke in his book Childhood's End.
"Imagine that every man's mind is
an island, surrounded by ocean. Each
seems isolated, yet in reality all are link¬
ed by the bedrock from which they
spring".
The imminence of a nuclear
holocaust incites pessimism in many
people today; as in Simak's novel, they
see the terror within us all too well. But
if we are all connected by a bedrock of
unitive consciousness, we also have the
talisman, the power of transformation,
to transcend the terror to peace and
harmony.
By now it should be clear that in
science fiction educators have an un¬
foreseen opportunity not only to instil
enthusiasm in the hearts of their
students for science, but also to en¬
courage them to follow the dance of
reality with the music of both science
and science fiction. For to cope with
the realitites of the twenty-first cen¬
tury, we will need both the arts and the
sciences.
I shall never forget the time when I
was confronted by a student in a con¬
ventional introductory physics course
for non-scientists after I had finished a
lecture that reviewed the meaning of
relativity and quantum mechanics to
our world view. "Professor," the stu¬
dent said, "these concepts are
fascinating. But the new physics seems
to apply only to elementary particles.
What is there for me, personally?"
This was many years ago, and I
couldn't answer him then.
Subsequently, however, I developed
a course at the University of Oregon,
aptly titled The Physics of Science Fic¬
tion, that uses readings from as many
as fifty science fiction novels to in¬
troduce the principles and messages of
both the classical and the new physics
to non-scientists. The advantage of this
approach is that science is no longer
seen as isolated from our lives, a view
that vexes many non-scientists like the
student quoted above.
Another reason why science fiction is
relevant to today's science classroom is
the growing importance of futuristics
in our global society. I suspect that
science fiction started the subject of
futuristics. It was in .1934 that the dean
of science fiction, H.G. Wells, sug¬
gested that universities establish
courses on human ecology. Science fic¬
tion writers examine future problems
such as overpopulation, intelligent
computers, and nuclear holocaust with
such insight and reverberating detail
that futurists and educators would be
well advised to honour their wisdom.
And the framework of immediate per¬
sonal impact in which that wisdom is
couched can be employed by educators
to focus the attention of today's youth
on the design of the future that will be
theirs.
Ultimately, the most common bond
between science and science fiction, the
one that makes them such good part¬
ners in the dance of reality, is imagina¬
tion. Nowhere is imagination, and the
openness of mind that fosters imagina¬
tion, more essential than when we ex¬
plore the nature, structure, and destiny
of reality itself. Both science and
science fiction are engaged in the ex-
The phenomenon of relativistic time dila¬
tion, which is central to Einstein 's theory
of relativity, is a concept which students
often find difficult to comprehend. In
1905 Einstein wrote that "a clock fixed
at the earth 's equator will run slower by
a very small amount than an identical
clock fixed at one of the earth 's poles ' '.
Many science fiction authors have made
use of this scientific notion of time dila¬
tion, notably in tales of space travellers
returning to Earth after a long voyage
only to find that time has advancedmor*
quickly there and that they are aliens in
a future society.

Each age produces its own myths and
the most persistent myth of modern
times is that ourplanet is being regularly
visited by alien astronauts from outer
space. In most cases the "flying

proaching turn out on investigation to be
aircraft, meteors, artificial satellites or

ploration of space, time, life, the
universe, and the place of our con¬
sciousness in the universe; both do it
well, and with mutual attention,
respect, and encouragement. And since
imagination is one of the most impor¬
tant commodities for the classroom, I
strongly urge the educator to consider a
course on the science of science fiction
for the high school or college cur¬
riculum. Benefits accrue from both the
content and the dynamic vision of
science fiction.
I will end with an example of how
science fiction can lighten a lecture on
the phenomenon of relativistic time
dilation, the monumental discovery of
Einstein that moving clocks run slower.
Can time dilation serve love? Why, yes;
witness the following letter written by a
character in Joe Haldeman's novel The
Forever War.
"William,
All this is in your personnel file. But
knowing you, you might just chuck it.
So I made sure you'd get this note.
Obviously, I lived. Maybe you will,
too. Join me.
I know from the records that you're
out at Sade-138 and won't be back for
a couple of centuries. No problem.
I'm going to a planet they call Middle
Finger, the fifth planet out from

It took all of my money, and all the
money of five other old-timers, but we
bought a cruiser from UNEF. And
we're using it as a time machine.
So I'm on a relativistic shuttle,
waiting for you. All it does is go out
five light years and come back to Mid¬
dle Finger, very fast. Every ten years I
age about a month. So if you're on
schedule and still alive, I'll only be
twenty-eight when you get here. Hurry!
I never found anybody else and I
don't want anybody else. I don't care
whether you're ninety years old or thir¬
ty. If I can't be your lover, I'll be your
nurse.

I believe that Einstein himself would
have appreciated such an illuminating
and friendly invasion of the science
classroom!

How do you set about writing science fiction best-sellers?
Who better to ask than the prolific and widely-acclaimed
popularizer of science and science fiction author, Isaac
Asimov?
To date he has written or edited an astonishing total of 305
books. Of these 187 are on non-fiction subjects, mainly
scientific, but including books on history, geography,
mythology, humour, light verse, autobiography and
literature; among them are 2 two-volume books on The Bible
and Shakespeare.
He has also published 118 fictional works of which 69 are
anthologies of works and stories by other authors. Of the re¬
maining 49, written entirely by Asimov himself, 2 are
mystery novels, 6 are collections of mystery short stories, 20
are collections of science fiction short stories and 21 are
science fiction novels, including the best-selling Founda¬
tion's Edge, 1982, and The Robots of Dawn, 1983.
The list is still growing. This year will see the publication
of two new non-fiction works: Asimov's New Guide to
Science, and Opus 300.
by Isaac Asimov
I suppose that the question most fre¬
quently asked of prolific writers is
"Where do you get your ideas?"
If one is a prolific science fiction writer,
as I am, the question is likely to be
rephrased into, "Where do you get
your crazy ideas?".
The answer, in general, is a rather
simple one. I think, and think, and
think until something occurs to me. It's
by no means an easy task and if my
dear wife, Janet, comes upon me when
I happen to be lost in thought, her first
impression (even after years of ex¬
perience with me) is that I'm in dread¬
ful pain.
"What's wrong?" she cries out in
alarm.
"I'm thinking", I growl.
And yet sometimes, I must admit, an
idea is thrust upon me by the outside
world. On January 24, 1971, 1 attended
a science fiction convention and was in
the audience while two famous science
fiction writers were discussing writing
techniques. One thought that human
reactions were more important than
technological details, even in science
fiction (and I agree with him). "If you
have your motivations straight," he
said, "who cares about uh
plutonium-186".
I laughed at this for the speaker's
memory had betrayed him. There is no
such thing as plutonium-186, and there
can't be. It struck me, though, that I
might write a story in which
plutonium-186 ¿//é/ exist. It would come
from another universe, of course, one
in which the laws of nature were dif¬
ferent. Once here, the substance would
8
slowly absorb our laws of nature and
become more and more unstable. If we
could get an indefinite amount of such
material from the other Universe, we
could have a new and enormous source
of no-cost energy. Of course, I would
have to work out some serious
drawback which would involve all
Earth, perhaps all the Universe, in a
dreadful danger. Would people then be
willing to give up a source of cost-less
energy? More and more things
developed out of that one expression
"plutonium-186". I ended with a novel
called "The Gods Themselves",
published by Doubleday in 1972.
Once I actually dreamed a book. On
April 3, 1973, I awoke from a peculiar
dream and at once told it to Janet who,
as a psychiatrist, is professionally in¬
terested in dreams. I said, "I dreamed
I was preparing an anthology of old
science fiction stories I had read and
loved when I was a teen-ager and I was
re-reading them and loving them again.
What a shame to have to wake up."
Janet said, "Well, why don't you
prepare such an anthology?".
So I did, and I got to reread all the
old stories in real life (some of them
didn't hold up). The book was entitled
"Before the Golden Age" and was
published by Doubleday on April 3,
1974, the first anniversary of my
dream.
Last year I actually dreamed a
mystery. I had followed someone into a
restaurant and he disappeared before
my eyes. There was a couch in the
restaurant with its back to me, and I
finally found him, lying down on the
couch so that I could not see him from
the doorway. In my dream I said,
"What a wonderful idea,for a Black
Widower story!" (The Black Widower
stories are a series of mysteries that I've
been writing for over ten years.) When
I woke up I thought up a story around
that basic notion, called it "The
Redhead", wrote it, and sold it. It ap¬
peared in the October, 1984, issue of
Ellery Queen 's Mystery Magazine.
Sometimes, an editor deliberately
challenges me. On March 17, 1941,
John W. Campbell, editor of Astoun¬
ding Science Fiction handed me a
quotation from an essay by Ralph
Waldo Emerson: "If the stars should
appear one night in a thousand years,
how would men believe and adore; and
preserve for many generations the
remembrance of the City of God..."
"I want you to write a story about
this", said Campbell. "Explain why
the stars should only appear once in a
long time, and what effect the ap¬
pearance would have on an intelligent
race."
I wrote the story, called it
"Nightfall" and it appeared in the
September 1941 issue of the magazine.
It is still my most famous single short
story, and I wrote it when I was only
21.
These are exceptional cases,
however. In my hundreds of stories of
all lengths, I almost never had the help
of a chance comment, of a dream, of an
editorial suggestion, or of anything
else. As I said, it then becomes a matter
of hard thought.

I might begin thinking of a scientific
development and wondering "What
if
In 1956, computers were much in the
news. The existing ones were crude in¬
deed compared to what we have now,
but already it was possible to speculate
over how far they could improve. I
began to speculate, "How far? How
far? Would it eventually be able to do
this? Do that? Surpass human beings,
perchance?" In my mind, at last, I
came to what seemed to me to be the
only possible conclusion. I promptly
wrote the story "The Last Question"
which appeared in the November,
1956, issue of Science Fiction Quarter¬
ly. Of all the stories I have written, this
one is my favourite.
Or I might think of the human angle
rather than the technological one.
What if computers became so common
and integral a part of the human scene
that people forgot how to do arithmetic
in their head or by use of pen and
paper; forgot even that it was possible
to do it without a computer? It didn't
take long to think of a satirical treat¬
ment of the question and I wrote "The
Feeling of Power", which appeared in
the February, 1958, issue of //.
As you see, for me a story starts with
a word, a phrase, a statement, a ques¬
tion. That acts like a seed out of which
the rest of the story grows; or, if you
prefer another metaphor, it acts as a
piece of grit about which the pearl
layers itself.
Very frequently, the seed I must
somehow originate makes up the end of
the story. Most of my stories are
mysteries in one fashion or another. A
good number of them, both novels and
short stories, are actual mysteries,
orthodox and old-fashioned
"whodunits". Some of my science fic¬
tion novels, though thoroughly science
fiction, are also straightforward
mysteries. Examples are "The Caves of
Steel" (Doubleday, 1954); "The Naked
Sun" (Doubleday, 1957); and the very
recent, "The Robots of Dawn"
(Doubleday, 1983).
Even those science fiction stories
that are not straightforward mysteries
have mystery elements to them. There
is very often something to be found or
uncovered, a particular person or place
or motivation, something.
In every case, I must think up the en¬
ding, the gimmick, the surprise that
will fool the reader.
Once I have my ending I'm home and
safe. The next step is to think up a place
to begin. In this connexion I always
remember something that John Camp¬
bell once told me. He said, "When you
start a story and find you are having
trouble, it is because you started too
soon. Start later in the narrative." I
therefore start as late as I conveniently
can. That does not take long to work
out.
Then, once I have my ending and my
beginning, I start to write. To be sure,
I don't have anything in between the
beginning and ending except, possibly,
some vague scraps of conversation in
my head. That doesn't matter; I rely on
making up the entire story even a
novel as complicated as "The Robots
of Dawn" as I go along. I stay always
one scene ahead of myself until, as I ap¬
proach the end, the last few scenes of
the book reveal themselves and that is
how I know I am approaching the end.
What happens if half-way through
I'm stuck? Well, that is very unlikely.
As long as I know what the ending will
be I have something to aim for,
whether I am writing a short story or a
novel, and as long as there is something
to aim for, I can't get totally lost.
The actual writing (once I know
where I'm going) always turns out to be
incredibly simple. I write as fast as I can
type and it is never necessary to make
more than a few minor revisions.
I don't actually visualize my stories;
I'm not very good at visualization. I
don't really picture my characters or
my scenes and I rarely describe
anything I don't absolutely have to.
But I do hear. The entire story reels
itself off in my head as I sit at the
typewriter or word-processor and, I
can hear it especially the dialogue. It
is as though something inside myself is
dictating and I am merely typing down
what I hear as fast as I can.
For that .reason, my stories and
novels tend to be more conversation
than action, more dialogue than
events. I am criticized for that
sometimes by people who (I can only
presume) know more about writing
than I do, and who therefore feel en¬
tirely free to castigate me for the lack of
action, description and characteriza¬
tion in my fiction.
But what can I do? I write as I write,
and I urge no one else to do as I do.
That is why, by the way, I approach
an article such as this one with a certain
reluctance. I have never taken courses
in writing, never read books on the sub¬
ject. I majored in chemistry and not in
English literature.
I am, then, clearly not an authority
in the subject. I don't pretend to know
how to write and I don't hold myself up
as a model to beginners in any way. In
fact, I think I should be considered a
horrible example for I feel that anyone
who tries to do what I do is bound to
make a mess of it.
Once again I do what I do simply
because that is all I know how to do.Ë

No science without fiction
by Alexander Kazantsev
SCIENCE fiction has its own rules.
Concerned as it is with the new
frontiers of science, it portrays
the latest scientific achievements and
sometimes even produces ideas which
science can exploit; for the role of
science fiction is not only to distract
and entertain, but to announce the
future, to foresee new scientific and
technical achievements, to prompt and
predict them.
Ivan Efremov, the eminent Soviet
scientist and science fiction writer, and
author of many famous novels and
tales, describes in his short story, A
Shadow of the Past (1945) how, when
old bare rocks were illuminated in a
certain way, a lifelike three-
dimensional image of a gigantic
dinosaur appeared. This caused a
public sensation, and in particular ex¬
cited the curiosity of Yuri Denisyuk, a
young scientist who is now a correspon¬
ding member of the Soviet Academy of
Sciences. According to him, it led to
discoveries in the field of holography
(see Unesco Courier, March 1981).
In the 1950s Soviet geologists
discovered diamonds in Yakutia exact¬
ly as Ivan Efremov had described in his
story The Pipe ofDiamonds (1945). As
a scientist Efremov was able to
substantiate his hypothesis concerning
the location of the diamond deposit,
and as an artist he showed how it could
be discovered.
There is no end to the scientific and
technical predictions of Jules Verne.
One has only to recall his Nautilus. Up
to a hundred of his "fantastic"
forecasts subsequently came true.
H.G. Wells, in the War of the
Worlds, and Alexei N. Tolstoy, in his
Hyperboloid of the Engineer Garin an¬
ticipated the invention of the laser
beam, which now promises unheard of
advances in science and technology
but also has unprecedented destructive
capacities.

In his story, Professor Dowell's
Head (1925) the Soviet science fiction
writer Alexander Bieliayev foretold the
possibility of transplanting human
organs. Several decades later the Soviet
scientist Sergei S. Bryuchonienko
amazed the world when he grafted the
head of one dog onto the trunk of
another. Now organ transplants take
place every other day. The world was
fascinated by the pioneering heart
transplants performed by Professor
Christiaan Barnard. Nowadays such
operations have become, if not com¬
monplace, at least frequent.
Alexander Bieliayev foretold
anabiosis (suspended animation) in his
story Neither Life nor Death (1926).
Another Soviet writer, Yuri Dolgushin,
was the first to evoke the possibility of
restoring the dying to life in his
Generator of Miracles (1939). Thus,
both these writers anticipated the now
well-known technique of reanimation.

The doyen of American science fic¬
tion, Hugo Gernsback, described in his
novels the mechanism of a television set
at a time when such an invention was
not even thought of. He wrote about
many technical innovations which
subsequently became realities, as well
as atomic wars which are now threaten¬
ing all life on earth.
In one of his works written shortly
after the Second World War, the well-
known English science fiction writer
Arthur C. Clarke introduced the idea
of placing an artificial geostationary
satellite in orbit at an altitude of some
30,000 kilometres above the Earth,
which could be used for telecom¬
munications and the retransmission of
radio and television programmes.
Konstantin E. Tsiolkovsky's story
Beyond the Planet Earth, which was
published at the beginning of the cen¬
tury, contained so many scientifically
valid ideas that it provided a theoretical
basis for cosmonautics in both the
USSR and the USA.
But the most remarkable figure in
the domain of scientific forecasting is,
perhaps, that of Cyrano de Bergerac.
His Histoire Comique des Etats et Em¬
pires de la Lune and Histoire Comique
des Etats et Empires du Soleil, both
written over three hundred years ago,
are not only full of pungent wit but of
what his contemporaries regarded as
preposterous figments of a childlike
imagination. He proposed multi-stage
rockets for interplanetary flights,
spoke of weightlessness and parachute
descents, and claimed that the human
organism was composed of cells.
Moreover, several decades before
Antonie van Leeuwenhoek produced
his microscope and more than two cen¬
turies before the discoveries of Pasteur
and Mechnikov, on which the science
of microbiology is based, Cyrano de
Bergerac asserted the existence of
microbes in the blood and resistance to
them by antibodies. He designed lamps
in the form of luminous balloons (elec¬
tric bulbs?), extraordinary speaking
books attached to the ear and reciting
the text, starting with the chapter men¬
tally chosen by the hearer.
What is more, Cyrano assured his
readers that he had learned all these
things from the son of the Sun (an ex¬
traterrestrial?). He did not hesitate to
make this assertion at a time when the

quisition for his heretical ideas about

an infinite number of worlds in the
Universe was still fresh in men's minds.
As a scientist who has turned to
literature, I have devoted myself to
science fiction while continuing to be a
scientist and engineer. Some of the
ideas advanced by me several decades
ago are now being realized. For in¬
stance, that of using superconductivity
for the storage of energy (The Burning
Island, 1939) and of a floating sub¬
marine tunnel (The Arctic Bridge,
1941). At present no such tunnel passes
through the North Pole, but one is be¬
ing built by Japanese engineers bet¬
ween the islands of Honshu and Hok¬
kaido and, as we know, there is a pro¬
ject for a tunnel under the English
Channel.
In my story Explosion (1946) I put
forward the hypothesis that the enor¬
mous devastation over an area of 2,000
square kilometres in the Podkamen-
naya Tunguska river basin (Eastern
Siberia) in 1908 was not caused by a
falling meteorite but could have been
due to the crash of an extra-terrestrial
spaceship because of a breakdown. My
story excited the imaginations not only
of science fiction writers but also of
scientists, and although my hypothesis
is rejected by some people it also has its
supporters.
Palaeocosmonautics, which studies
the traces of contacts with extra¬
terrestrial beings in ancient times, at¬
tracts me as a science fiction writer not
only because of its romantic character,
but also because of its potential
demonstrability.
Certain scientists who have not
studied this question seriously never¬
theless maintain that there are no
proofs of actual extraterrestrial con¬
tacts in the past, and consequently they
consider it unethical to concern
themselves with this question. But this
is by no means correct. One has only to
consider the many arguments in sup¬
port of the hypothesis. True, there are
speculative "pseudo-proofs" with little
or no foundation, but genuine science
fiction is based exclusively on the pro¬
vability of the improbable.
The French scholar Henri Lhote
discovered at Tassili, in the Sahara, a
rock-drawing several thousands of
years old, which he jocularly named
"the great god Martian". A stone
sculpture of "the great god Martian"
dating from the same period was
discovered on the Japanese island of
Hokkaido, thousands of miles from
Africa. Nearby were uncovered a
number of terracotta statuettes or
dogu, which means "a loose overall
covering with hood" in other words,
what we would nowadays call a diver's
suit. Radiocarbon tests revealed that
they were 4,500 years old. This meant
that they had been made by the Ainu,
the predecessors of the Japanese.
But presumably their portraits were
not the only traces of themselves which
the visitors left behind. Legends and
traditions have survived. In Egypt, for
instance, the god Thoth was the patron
of science and scribes. Tradition has it
that he flew in from Sirius. According
to the ancient legends of the Dogons,
an African tribe of cattle-breeders, it
appears that Sirius was not a double
star, as was established in our time, but
a triple one. According to the Dogons,
the Universe emanated from a single
"egg", i.e. an atom which took part in
the original "Big Bang" a theory
subscribed to by many contemporary
astronomers. Does this not explain
why, in ancient Egypt, there was a
calendar linked to Sirius and its fifty-
year cycle or rotation period, and why

of him in the form of an ibis with a long
beak (nose!) starting above the
eyebrows. In ancient primitive
sculpture of Asian origin, humans are
also depicted with the nose starting
above the eyebrows. Does this not offer
food for speculation?
Long may speculation and fantasy
help to stimulate each one of us, for
man is the only creature gifted with im¬
agination and capable of conceiving
something which does not exist. His
mind can conquer time and space,
create things that never were, advance
the frontiers of science. There is no

Ariadne's thread
by Manuel Pereira
THE flowering of science in the
last century has accustomed us
to identify science fiction with
what is most modern, newfangled and
futuristic in imaginative literature.
When we speak of science fiction we
almost invariably have in mind writers
such as Verne, Wells or Bradbury.
But is science fiction really of such
recent origin? If we look at the creative
works of the pre-scientific era, we shall
find that the roots of what we
nowadays call science fiction are to be
found in myths, folklore, cabalistic
writings, alchemy, and architecture
and plastic art of magico-religious
inspiration.
The devices and situations most fre¬
quently encountered in science fiction
can be traced back to this poetical
heritage. The earliest antecedent of
computers, for instance, was the
Delphic Oracle, which could divine and
foretell everything concerning the gods
and man. The time machine is merely a
modern version of metempsychosis,
which enabled the souls of the ancients
to transmigrate from one body to
another and consequently from one
epoch to another. As for the invisible
man, the Chinese alchemist Pao
Pu'Tsu wrote that "if someone rubs his
body with cypress juice he will become
invisible", while his European counter-
Above, this representation of a masked
figure is typical of the neolithic rock
paintings ofSefar, in the Tassili-n-Ajjer
region of the Sahara, which have been
included in Unesco's WorldHeritage List
of Cultural and Natural Properties of
outstanding universal value. It bears a
curious resemblance to many of the
illustrations of "Martians" to be found
in the science fiction magazines of the
1920s.

* parts believed they would disappear if
they squeezed the Philosopher's Stone
in their hands. The principle of the
robot is nothing more than the
"mechanization" of the alchemist's
homunculus and the Golem of the
cabalists.
AH the interplanetary fauna which
nowadays forms part of the stock in
trade of science fiction is derived from
the mythological monsters, bestiaries
and demonology of the Middle Ages.
The creatures who pass through
Bosch's Garden of Earthly Delights
could have been taken straight out of
some war of the galaxies, and many
other fabulous beings still look down
on us from the walls of Gothic
cathedrals.
And what about the laser beams
which turn up so frequently in
futuristic literature? All the religions
were peopled with gods who cast rays
and angels with flaming swords.
Homer speaks of "Apollo, he who
wounds from afar". When Cortez ask¬
ed the Aztecs where they got their
knives, they pointed to the sky because,
as Mircea Eliade says, the blacksmiths
of ancient times employed "sacraliz-
ed" meteoric iron.
Everything that is powerful and
warlike comes from on high, whether it
be Zeus, the Indo-European God of
Thunder, or the Shango of the
Yorubaswho has been culturally
transferred to Brazil and the Carib¬
bean. The Book of Exodus tells how
"Mount Sinai was altogether on
smoke, because the Lord descended
upon it in fire". In the Vedas we also
find Indra casting lightning-flashes
with one of his four arms.
"They arose in the midst of the
light", we read in the Popol Vuh of the
Quiche Indians of Guatemala, "the
Sun fell to one of them and the Moon
to the other. Then the firmament was
filled with light... the four hundred
youths who were killed by Zipacna also
arose and were transformed into
stars..."
Of all the mysteries surrounding our
ancestors, the most undecipherable
were in the heavens. The best, if not all,
efforts of science fiction are directed
towards this aerial ocean which has
been given metaphorical form in every
culture. Thus science fiction becomes,
as it were, a counter-mythology, a
cosmogony of the future divested of
religious significance.
Man's oldest dream to fly derives
from this cosmic curiosity, and "fly" is
the dominant verb in futuristic
literature. Possibly because of
nostalgia for the winged deities, many
Yoga-fakir legends speak of people ris¬
ing in the air, and the alchemist Yo-Tsi-
Yuan claimed that by eating pine-
kernels he could rise above the ground.
Of all mythologies, the one which
best expresses this longing to fly is the
fable of the Cretan hero Icarus, the
first "cosmonaut", who flew with
wings made for him by his father
Daedalus.
Daedalus is the prototype of the syn¬
thesis between artist and scientist be¬
queathed to us by classical antiquity.
This legendary figure was sculptor, ar¬
chitect, painter and inventor. Accor¬
ding to mythologists he infused life and
movement into his statues (another
préfiguration of the robot) but he also
produced inventions in the field
of navigation. His engineering

achievements include the labyrinth
which enclosed the Minotaur (another
creature worthy of science fiction), the
thermal baths at Selianthus, the for¬
tifications of the city of Camikos, a
canal in the river Alaban, the temple of
Apollo at Cumae and the foundations
of the temple of Aphrodite on Mount
Eryx.
It was not until the Renaissance that
a living Daedalus appeared upon the
scene. Leonardo da Vinci, I'uomo
universale, was the perfect heir to the
humanist ideal of reconciling science
and the arts.
Painter, sculptor, architect, military
engineer, physicist, writer, Leonardo
also devoted himself to stratigraphy,
autopsy, anatomy, and the technical
designing of cities and machines. He
studied the fossil shells of the Appen-
nines and prided himself on his skill as
a lute-player. Careful observation of
the flight of birds led him to design the
very thing invented by Daedalus.
Three centuries were to pass before
the appearance of another Daedalus.
This time it would be a writer, an artist
of vast scientific knowledge: Jules
Verne, whose visions would have been
impossible without the accumulated
achievements of the imagination exten¬
ding from Daedalus to Leonardo a
veritable Ariadne's thread leading, as it
were, through a labyrinth to a kind of
archaeology of science fiction.
But there are other, perhaps more
far-fetched, labyrinths, and since we
are dealing with science fiction there
can be no disrespect. I am thinking of
the Maya pyramids which, according
to archaeologists, were built as
astronomical observatories.

Not long ago, when workers of the
Electricity Company in Mexico City
were digging up a street in order to in¬
stall a transformer, they came upon a
rock covered with reliefs. Thus was
discovered the Great Temple, which
constitutes an entire treatise on astral
symbolism, an allegorical narration by
the Aztecs offering an explanation of
the formation of the cosmos and pro¬
jecting man to the stars. Science fiction
in stone?
But the greatest flight of speculation
was launched in the Sahara in the
mid-1950s with the discovery of the
Tassili n'Ajjer rock paintings, dating
from about the Neolithic period. A
procession of really startling images is
depicted on the walls of caves.
Although some experts think they
represent ritual masks or head-dresses,
what is certain is that several of the
figures look like divers or astronauts.
Perhaps we shall never know the full
truth about these Tassili paintings. But
there they are, transmitting something
baffling and mysterious, especially the
most esoteric scene, depicting what
look like wings floating above the
heads of men, resembling an old-
fashioned fan or the rotor blades of a
helicopter. Indeed, these helicoidal ob¬
jects seem to be driven in circular
movement around an axis. In both
cases the axes are discs, and an irides¬
cent halo or reverberation can be clear¬
ly distinguished around them.
Here we can no longer speak of head¬
dresses or masks or hats. What, then, is
the meaning of these two artefacts?
The most widely advanced hypothesis
is that they are ships from another
planet which visited the region in the
remote past. I am inclined to imagine
that it is a wishful design for some kind
of flying machine. Another Tassili
painting shows wheeled cars drawn by
horses, and another depicts perfectly-
drawn insects in full flight. If the ends
of the blades of the two artefacts are
studied carefully, it will be seen that
their texture is similar to that of a but¬
terfly's wings. Why not assume that a
Daedalus could also have lived in this
cave?
From the flight of Icarus to the
sphere of Phileas Fogg and the projec¬
tile that travels from the Earth to the
moon, via the wall-paintings of Tassili,
the flying broomstick of the medieval
witch and the wings designed by
Leonardo, science and poetry combin¬
ed have traced an impressive trajec¬
tory, ending in the spaceship of today.

HIGH SOCIETIES
Spate settlements oftomorrow
SETTLEMENT of our sister planets
and planetary systems of stars
outside our solar system is one of
the recurring themes of science fiction.
However, we now know that planets
such as Mars and Venus are not capable
of supporting life, and the technical prob¬
lems of achieving the velocity necessary
to reach even the nearest star within one
person's lifetime seem today to be
insuperable.
Undeterred, science fiction writers
came up with the idea of the "generation
starship", a kind of Noah's Ark in space
in which the crew completing the mis¬
sion would be the descendants of the
original crew several generations remov¬
ed. In other words, the starship would, in
effect, be a miniature, self-contained
"travelling world".
When high-energy physics professor
Gerard O'Neill considered the problem,
he asked himself "If several generations
can survive in a starship, why send it to
the possibly hostile environment of
another planetary system? Why not
create the desired environment in the
starship itself and simply place it within
easy reach of the Earth?"
Why should we want to create col¬
onies in space? There are many good
reasons for doing so. With the world
population doubling every thirty-five
years, our own planet is becoming over¬
crowded and suffering increasingly from
the effects of pollution and its renewable
energy resources will eventually run out.
It makes sense to move some of our
polluting industries out of the Earth's at¬
mosphere and to construct solar power
stations in space where radiation from
the Sun is available twenty four hours a
day, at full strength. (1) Artist's impres¬
sion of the scene during the construction
of a space power station.
It would also be possible to develop en¬
tirely new industries. Alloys can be made
under the weightless conditions of space
from metals which do not mix suc¬
cessfully under the pull of gravity on
Earth. Experiments conducted in Skylab
and the Salyut space station have
already resulted in the production of new
alloys and special types of glass that are
unobtainable on Earth. (2) Soviet
cosmonaut Svetlana Saritskaya, the first
woman to walk in space, conducts an ex¬
periment in welding, soldering and cut¬
ting metal in space.
20
Skylab and Salyut are, in fact, the first
existing space habitats, and three Soviet
cosmonauts, Leonid Kizim, Vladimir
Solovyev and Dr. Oleg Atkov, have just
completed a mission in which they spent
a record, 237 consecutive days (eight
months) in space. (3) Interior of the
Salyut space station during a previous
mission.
Skylab and Salyut were not, of course,
designed as long-term habitats and can
only accommodate a handful of specially
trained cosmonauts. However, advanc¬
ed, technically feasible designs for space
habitats which could accommodate
some 10,000 people in Earth-style com¬
fort already exist. (5) The Stanford torus
(doughnut-shaped) habitat was designed
at Stanford University in 1975. Approx¬
imately two kilometres in diameter and
with a mass of over ten million tons, the
torus rotates around a stationary central
axis to provide a simulation of Earth
gravity. (4) An artist's impression of the
living area in the outer rim of the torus.
The windows at the top of the illustration
look towards the central, stationary axis.
That is to say, the "floor" of the living
area is perpendicular to the central axis
but would feel "downwards" because of
the spin of the torus.
The space colony would need to be
self-sufficient in food. (6) An artist's im¬
pression of the agricultural area designed
for the Stanford torus space colony. The
area is situated between two areas of
parkland. On the top four levels of the
farm, soybeans, wheat, sorghum and
some other crops would be grown. The
bottom level is a drying facility. Water
would be supplied directly from the river
(centre foreground) and indirectly
through the fish tanks that line the sides.
Nearly a kilometre in length, the farm
would also be inhabited by rabbits and
some 3,000 cattle. Since moisture,
sunlight and heat conditions could be
controlled, the farm would yield far more
than a farm of comparable size on Earth.
In developing their designs for space
habitats, scientists seem to be out-doing
the science fiction writers in their ex¬
ploration of the fantastic. Yet these
designs are serious, science based pro¬
jects and to many experts they appear no
more fantastic, and just as feasible, as

££ «ytlRST, of necessity, come
thought, fantasy and fable.
-*- Then follow the scientific
calculations. Finally, thought is crown¬
ed by achievement". This is how
Konstantin Eduardovich Tsiolkovsky
(1857-1935), one of the pioneers of
space travel, defined the basic relation¬
ship that exists between science fiction
and scientific and technological
development.
In its wider sense of the creative, im¬
aginative dreaming that foreshadows
scientific achievement, science fiction,
like myth, reflects the ambition to
dominate nature which is as old as
mankind.
Indeed, dream and rational thought,
imagination and precise calculations,
are interwoven in the creation of even
the simplest tools or techniques, and it
is not always easy to know where one
ends and the other begins. For in¬
stance, those prehistoric cave drawings
whose force and realism excite our ad¬
miration can be interpreted in different
ways. Perhaps they were only fanciful
dreams, primitive "science fiction"
created by the imagination of pre¬
historic artists; perhaps they were
projects or plansfor the manufacture
of hunters' snares drawn up by
prehistoric engineers.
A project is often classed as science
fiction simply because its achievement

bury's The Silver Locusts.
demands a higher level of technological
advance than society has attained.
Leonardo da Vinci designed a pro¬
totype flying machine four hundred
years before the first aeroplanes ap¬
peared. His contemporaries treated his
project as no more than a technical fan¬
tasy. Nobody could explain how the
propeller of this remote ancestor of the
helicopter would be driven, for -the
motor was not invented until much
later.
Until a few decades ago, this was true
of space flight. Because technological
development was not advanced
enough, it was impossible to produce
rockets possessing the requisite pro¬
pulsive power. But science fiction had
already foreseen the decisive role of the
rocket. Jules Verne had equipped his
moon ship with several auxiliary
rockets.
One of the major objectives of
technological development is, of
course, to perfect the means of produc¬
tion in order to increase productivity,
and at first sight this seems to be a pure¬
ly practical aim which has nothing to
do with fantasy or the imagination. But
this is a superficial view. In every
technical achievement there is an initial
stage of capital importance: the stage at
which, drawing on the maximum
available information, every, possible
solution is sought to a given problem,
thus allowing ideas to take form. At
this stage intuition, imagination and
fantasy are even more important than
purely technical competence. This kind
of imaginative freedom was exercised
in the invention of the wheel just as in
the construction of the Egyptian
pyramids or the first supersonic
aeroplane, and it will be equally
necessary for the manufacture of
tomorrow's micro-computers.
In the engineering sciences, the in¬
ventive process is much closer to the
procedure used in science fiction than is
generally realized. They are two similar
forms of human activity, each applied
to the search for new solutions
although, of course, in different con¬
texts and perspectives. The history of
technological progress includes many
examples where imagination, combin¬
ed with scientific knowledge, provided
the seeds of new ideas and original con¬
cepts. Analysis shows that to produce
any kind of machine that is to be com¬
mercially successful one must begin by
examining at least fifty to sixty original
ideas.
This is where science fiction can play
a decisive part in technological creativi¬
ty. Its essential role is not so much to
provide specific ideas or concrete solu¬
tions drawn from the author's imagina¬
tion, as to stimulate scientists and

Famed for his many works of science fic¬
tion, including notably The Martian
Chronicles, The Illustrated Man and
Fahrenheit 451, and an acknowledged
master of the short story form, Ray
Bradbury fell in love with poetry at the
age of ten and has been writing it ever
since. Of his poems he says that they are
the outcome of "ideas, large and small,
that tripped me up and felled me into my
typewriter. I did not write them. They
wrote me."
'Of what is past, or passing, or to come'
by Ray Bradbury
Of what is past, or passing, or to come,
These things I sense and sing, and try to sum.
The apeman with his cave in need offire,
The tiger to be slain, his next desire.
The mammoth on the hoof a banquet seems,
How bring the mammoth down fills apeman's dreams.
How taunt the sabretooth and pull his bite?
How cadge the flame to end an endless night?
All this the apeman sketches on his cave
In coward's arts that teach him to be brave.
So beasts and fire that live beyond his lair
Are drawn in science fictions everywhere.
The walls are full of schemes that sum and teach,
To help the apeman reach beyond his reach.
While all his ape-companions laugh and shout:
"What are those stupid blueprints all about?
Give up your science fictions, clean the cave!"
But apeman knows his sketching chalk can save,
And knowing, learning, moves him to rehearse
True actions in the world to death reverse.
With axe he knocks the tiger's smile to dust,
Then runs to slay the mammoth with spear thrust;
The hairy mountain falls, the forests quake,
Then fire is swiped to cook a mammoth steak.
Three problems thus are solved by art on wall:
The tiger, mammoth, fire, the one, the all.
So these first science fictions circled thought
And then strode forth and all the real facts sought,
And then on wall new science fictions drew,
That run through history and end with... you.

These 15,000-year-old drawings, found

They may well be the oldest existing
technical blueprints in the world.

engineers in the search for truly
original solutions.
Unfortunately, insufficient attention
is given at all levels of education to the
need to develop the spirit of invention
and innovation. Perhaps one of the
most serious gaps in many education
systems is this undervaluation of im¬
agination and fantasy in the educa¬
tional process. The result is that pupils'
creative capacities are not sufficiently
encouraged at an age when the per¬
sonality is being formed. Worst of all,
some educational activities are so
organized that these capacities are
brutally stifled at birth.
Would it not be a good idea,
therefore, to introduce science fiction
into school programmes, thus giving
young minds an opportunity to become
familiar with the masterpieces of this
branch of literature in a systematic
way? It could also be introduced in an
appropriate form into schools of
engineering, especially since the time-
lag between science fiction and
technological reality is now being con¬
siderably reduced.
It should not be forgotten that works
of science fiction have often played a
prophetic role in technological
developments. The word "robot" was
coined in 1921 by the Czech writer
Karel Capek (1890-1938). Today
robots have moved out of the sphere of
science fiction and are operating entire
factories. Improving them exercises the
minds of science fiction writers as well
as of engineers. The same is true of
lasers. These all-powerful beams were
one of the favourite themes of science
fiction writers twenty years ago, and
they were still a mystery until quite
recently. Now, they are being used in
medicine and telecommunications.
Again, laboratories and research sta¬
tions, even technical workshops, are
now being installed in outer space
another subject beloved of science fic¬
tion. The heroes of the cosmos are no
ROBOTS
The term "robot", derived from the Czech
robota (work), was coined by the Czech
playwright Karel Capek in his play R.U.R.
(Rossum's Universal Robots), first perfor¬
med in Prague in 1921. The scene is set
in the future on a island where robots are
manufactured and sold as workers, ser¬
vants and soldiers. The word came to be
applied to any piece of apparatus which
was capable of some limited "thought"
process and could perform simple, re¬
petitive tasks previously undertaken by
humans.
Initially, science fiction writers' treatment
of the theme of robots reflected society's
unease, fear even, of rapid technological
advance. The early robots were often
depicted as menacing monsters that ten¬
ded to get out of their inventor's control
and go rampaging around in an orgy of
mindless killing. As society became more
accustomed to technological progress (the
first automatic traffic lights were originally
referred to as robots), so robots began to
be more sympathetically portrayed. This
change was reflected in American author
Isaac Asimov's famous Three Laws of
Robotics: (1) A robot may not injure a
human being or, through inaction, allow
a human being to come to harm. (2) A
robot must obey the orders given it by
human beings except where such orders
would conflict with the First Law. (3) A
robot must protect its own existence as
long as such protection does not conflict
with the First or Second Law.
In the real world robots have become
incredibly sophisticated, taking over from
longer characters out of science fiction
but scientists and engineers working in
the new space technologies.
But this does not mean that
everything predicted in science fiction
has already come to pass, or will
necessarily come true in the future.
Besides, such prophecies must not be
confused with scientific predictions
based on exact laws such as, for in¬
stance, the prediction of Dmitri
Ivanovich Mendeleyev (1834-1907)
concerning unknown chemical
elements, or the discovery in 1930 by
Clyde Tombaugh of the planet Pluto,
whose existence and position had been
forecast some fifty years earlier by the
American astronomer Percival Lowell.
Sometimes, scientific and tech¬
nological progress is so rapid that
science fiction can neither foresee nor
even keep up with the resultant tech¬
nical revolution, as was the case for in¬
formatics. Although the latter is
already operating in the service of

In more recent science fiction the introduc¬
tion of robots offers writers the opportu¬
nity to examine the practical, philosophi¬
cal and moral implications of artificial intel¬
ligence. In one of Asimov's stories, two
robots left unused on a shelf pass the time
in philosophical debate. They finally con¬
clude that robots conform more closely to
the definition of the word "man" than do
men themselves.
Some highly sophisticated programs now
being developed for computers seem to be
approaching the level of artificial intelli¬
gence. Left, Soviet chess grandmaster
Raphael Vaganian (second from right)

him (extreme left) is Guillermo García,

Wolfgang von Kempelen's unbeatable

which caused a sensation in Europe in
Napoleon's day. The complicated visible
mechanism was operated by an expert
chess-playing dwarf hidden inside the
machine.
science and technology, the themes it
suggests have not been exploited to any
great degree by authors of science
fiction.
This leap forward lends a certain
fantasy to the achievements of tech¬
nology. At the same time it reduces
futuristic literature to a level that is
closer to reality. Thus it is becoming in¬
creasingly difficult for the authors of
such works to find themes which depart
from known scientific and techno¬
logical facts. On the contrary, they
derive their inspiration increasingly
from these facts.

Fantastic voyages in film
THE cinema established its unique
capacity to bring to life the
dreams and visions of science
fiction as long ago as the beginning of the
century, and from then until the mind-
bending computer-created images of to¬
day's intergalactic epics film-makers
developed a dazzling array of camera
tricks and special effects to bemuse the
public.
Space travel was brought to the screen
by the French pioneer Georges Meliès.
The filmic imagination was given free
rein in his version of Jules Verne's A Trip
to the Moon (1 ), depicting a Moon where
giant mushrooms unfurled from the ex¬
plorers' umbrellas and contrasting with
the documentary realism with which
Moon trips would be presented in such
later films as Destination Moon (US,
1950) made when space flight had
become a real possibility. By 1916 no
less than three films had been made of
Verne's Twenty Thousand Leagues
under the Sea and his novels with their
mixture of fantasy and precise detail
have ever since continued to provide
film-makers with tempting fare.
Two classics of the genre were made
in the 1920s and 1930s. Fritz Lang's
Metropolis (1926) presented a grim
vision of the future complete with terrify¬
ing machines and a robot-woman (2)
which were still influencing science fic¬
tion films four decades later. Things to
Come (3) resulted from collaboration bet¬
ween H.G. Wells and the Hungarian-born
producer Alexander Korda. In it a global
holocaust is followed by the rise of a
gleaming glass and steel civilization
capable of sending men to the Moon. As
in Jules Verne's Moon flight, a gun was
used to project the space vessel,
although by that time scientists knew
that the rocket was the only practicable
solution.
A boom in science fiction films began
in the 1950s, with space exploration as
a prominent theme. Earthlings ranged
further and further afield, as in the Soviet
Voyage to a Prehistoric Planet, a
meticulous narration of a journey to
Venus. But the traffic was not all one¬
way, and Earth had some strange visitors
from other planets. The Invasion of the
Body Snatchers (1956) treated the
theme of alien intelligence taking over
human bodies, and was described by one
critic as "occasionally difficult to follow
due to the strangeness of its scientific
premise". Another favourite theme is the
journey through time or other dimen¬
sions, with perhaps the most unusual
variation being depicted in Fantastic
Voyage (5) in which five scientists are
shrunk to microscopic size and injected
into the blood stream of another scientist
who has a blood clot inaccessible to
surgery.
The Incredible Shrinking Man (6) with
its hero becoming smaller and increasing¬
ly alien in his own world is, like the situa¬
tion in Fantastic Voyage, literally incred¬
ible. As a sceptical scientist has pointed
out, a mouse-sized man "would suffer
from a mouse's metabolic problems.
With a surface area many times greater in
proportion to his mass, he loses heat that
much faster and would need to eat
furiously simply to keep warm. A mouse
needs to eat about a quarter of its own
weight of food each day to survive..."
Misgivings about the harmful potential
of technology, the fallibility of men and

machines, also find expression in a
number of "prophetic" films about the
future of mankind. Alphaville (1965) is
set in a futuristic city run by an electronic
brain which is finally destroyed when it is
fed with poetry, a medium it cannot
understand. HAL, the homicidal com¬
puter in 2001: A Space Odyssey also
echoes fears about a computer-
dominated society.
The real stars in modern science fiction
films are the special effects, some of
them spectacular setpieces such as scaly
monsters and spaceships but others the
kind that no one would notice. For Close
Encounters of the Third Kind (1977)
about a hundred paintings on glass were
blended into the scenes. Such tech¬
niques and the blending of miniatures in¬
to live-action backgrounds were already
being used in Things to Come. A widely
used optical effect is the matte or mask
which blanks out a part of the screen
which can be filled in later. In Star Wars
a few hundred extras were turned into
thousands by being photographed three
times at different distances from the
camera; the three shots were combined,
and side ranks of men were painted in.
The use of "travelling mattes" which
change position, size and shape from
frame to frame can create such effects as
the "flying" of Superman. He was shot
in front of a blue screen and a shape cor¬
responding to his outline was cut out of
a skyline scene and his body fitted into
the gap. One way of tricking the au¬
dience used by Stanley Kubrick in 2001:
A Space Odyssey was based on the
viewer's assumption that the camera is
static. The stewardess in photo 7 carries
a tray and appears to walk through 360
degrees. In fact she was standing on a
treadmill and the camera and the entire
set rotated together. Today the use of
computerized camera systems and
computer-created images in such films
as fron (opposite page) are creating
astonishing aesthetic effects whose
possibilities are only just beginning to be
exploited.

(1788-1863).
'In the Age ofOne World'
A Chinese Utopia
by Kang You wei
A utopia (from the Greek words ou and topos, meaning no
place) is an imaginary land where everything is perfect. Uto¬
pian thought has been a feature of Western intellectual life
for centuries: one of the first books to describe a utopia was
Plato's Republic, and other utopias include those created
later by Thomas More in the 16th century and Samuel Butler
in the 19th. In China, unlike the West, a utopianizing tradi¬
tion scarcely exists, and the text published below is therefore
a historical rarity. It is an extract from the Ta Tung Shu or
One World Book written in the late 19th century by the
Chinese thinker Kang You wei (1858-1927). In this long work
of over 150,000 Chinese characters, the author develops a
visionary conception of a world in the future in which the
sufferings of mankind would be ended and age-old barriers
between man and man, group and group, would be done
away with. The expression Ta Tung, here translated into
English as "one world", denotes an ideal state of society and
of human nature and has also been rendered in other ways
including "the great commonwealth", "the great unity",
and "the era of 'world brotherhood'".

IN the beginnings of man he suffered
because of hunger, and so he
sought the fruit of the grasses and
trees, and the flesh of birds and beasts,
to fill himself. If he could not get flesh
and fruit, then he suffered. If he got
and ate them, filled up on them,
satiated himself with them, then he was
happy. He suffered because the wind
and rain and mist attacked his body,
and so he wrapped himself in the bark
of grasses and trees, and wove hemp
and ge (a plant of the bean family with
fibres from which cloth is woven) into
garments to cover his body. If he could
not get them, then he suffered. If he got
and wore them, then he was happy. He
suffered because he did not obtain
satisfaction of his human desire and so
he sought a mate to embrace. If he
could not get a mate, then he suffered.
If he got one, then he was happy.
Later, there were wise ones who "in
pursuing affairs added refinements" to
the old ways. Taking food, they cooked
it, roasted it, mixed it and so increased
men's happiness. Taking clothing, they
used silk material, made it gay with the
"five colours and the six hues", devis¬
ed gowns, caps, and sandals, and so in¬
creased men's happiness. (Similarly,
with dwellings, and with gratification
of sexual desire.)
The increase of happiness is caused
by that which more suits and better ac¬
cords with man's spiritual soul and
bodily soul, which heightens and ex¬
pands man's enjoyment and pleasure.
The inability to attain this happiness is
suffering. Suffering is the spirit
knotted-up, the body wounded, the
soul melancholy and downcast. The
capacity for increased happiness is
limitless; the capacity for increased suf¬
fering is also limitless. The two are
related faculties. Daily to bend our
thoughts more earnestly to means of
seeking happiness and avoiding suffer¬
ing: this is to progress.
This is what all the sages have had as
their purpose, with all their material in¬
ventions and social techniques. We
may judge them by the one criterion of
the extent to which they have increased
human happiness and decreased
human suffering. Their methods must
also be judged as valuable or not, ac¬
cording to the times and the
environment.
In One World everyone will live in
public housing. Outside of their regular
rooms at their place of work,
everywhere they will find great hotels,
whose beautiful and pleasant accom¬
modations defy description. They will
be of several grades, according to the
money the guest wishes to spend. There
will be four better kinds: "movable
rooms" (i.e. electrically powered cars
that run on tracks), "flying rooms", or
flying ships" and "marine" ships.
The people of this age will love to
travel. The grasses and trees are the
most stupid, and therefore flourish but
do not move about. The sheep and
swine are not so stupid as the grass and
trees, and are able to move about, but
cannot go far. As for the great peng-
bird and the yellow ku-bird, they fly a
thousand // with a single movement of
their wings. In antiquity, men aged and
died without leaving their native
village; thus they were like the grass
and trees. In the Middle Age, men
travelled about like sheep and swine
(i.e. only short distances). In the Age of
Complete Peace-and-Equality, then
they will be like the great peng-bird and
the yellow ku-bird.
All public buildings and residences
will have to pass the inspection of the
health authorities. Public hotels will be
equipped with air-conditioning, elec¬
trical heating, massaging machines.
There will be fast, electrically propelled
ships on the water, equipped with every
comfort and pleasure even to
gardens and many people will live on
these ships. On land there will be
automobiles. These will be developed
to the point that they will seat perhaps
several hundred persons, and will go at
great speeds. Perhaps they will be elec¬
trically powered; or it may be that they
will be powered by some new fuel.
Horse-drawn carriages will be used on¬
ly for hauling short distances, or they
may be entirely replaced by the elec¬
trical vehicles. Therefore, at the begin¬
ning of One World, people will live on
mountain tops; at the middle period of
that age, they will live on the sea; later,
they will live in the air.
There being no private homes,
everyone will dine together, like a great
convention. There will be no slaves or
servants, but their functions will be
performed by machines, shaped like
birds and beasts. One will order by
telephone, and food will be conveyed
by mechanical devices possibly a
table will rise up from the kitchen
below, through a hole in the floor. On
the four walls will be lifelike, "pro¬
truding paintings"; music will be play¬
ing, and there will be dancing. All this
will stimulate the appetite. In all these
things there will be refinement and
moral uplift.

More) is an indictment of the social and
economic conditions prevailing in the

located on an island off the coast of the

At this time, people will eat their
food in a liquid form the essences ex¬
tracted from solid matter. These essen¬
tial juices will be more easily absorbed
by the body than are the solids. There
will be vapours which will be inhaled to
give a joyful intoxication, but without
harm to the body. By imbibing only the
essences of foods, man's life will be
prolonged.
There will be three stages within the
Age of Complete Peace-and-Equality
itself: The Age of Disorder, in which
meat will still be eaten; the Age of In¬
creasing Peace-and-Equality, in which
the flesh of birds and animals will no
longer be eaten; the Age of Complete
Peace-and-Equality, in which even in¬

and in which all forms of life possessed
of cognition will be equal. Equality will
not extend to the vegetable kingdom,
for man must eat to preserve himself,
and because these forms of life are not
possessed of the cognitive faculty, and
hence are not to be included in the do¬

comfort. They will have great variety
and beauty, but will indicate no distinc¬
tions between people, except for the
badges of honour for Ren or
knowledge. There will be constant pro¬
gress in the use of all kinds of im¬
plements to advance civilization. Music
will play a great part in all phases of
human life. People will shave off all
hair except for that in the nose which
fulfils the function of straining dust
and impurities from the air. This is on
the ground that the nearer we are to the
beasts, the hairier; the more civilized
we become, the less hirsute. Further¬
more, lack of hair contributes to
cleanliness.
Men and women will bathe several
times daily, in water which will leave
them fragrantly scented. This is not a
matter of perfuming in the present
manner, so that a woman will be more
attractive as a sexual plaything. Rather
it is like the matter of hair: thereby
humans are farther elevated above the
filthy, foul-smelling beasts. "The
beauties of the present age will still not
equal the ugly of the Age of Complete
Peace-and-Equality". Even the toilet
facilities of that time will be made plea
sant with music and fragrant odours
and mechanical contrivances for
flushing away the filth. For the time
when people go to the toilet is the time
when they are most tranquil and
withdrawn from the hubbub of the
world. If there is that whereby to lift
their thoughts above this world [literal¬
ly, move their thoughts of abandoning
the world], to inspire their imagina¬
tions beyond the mundane [literally,
ideas of discarding forms], then their
souls will of themselves rise far above
the wordly level.
Everyone will receive a daily medical
check-up. All phases of life will be
under the supervision of the medical
authorities. Contagious diseases will be
eradicated. The whole earth will be
made clean and healthful. About the
only ailments remaining will be exter¬
nal ones, easily treated with medicines.
Thus, although there will be public
hospitals, they will be almost empty;
the sick will comprise only those who
are about to die of old age. In the case
of the latter, should their sufferings be
acute, and the doctors agree that there
is no hope of improvement, then they
may be mercifully put out of their
agony by electrocution. . . People of this-

The search for longevity, for the art
of becoming a spirit or immortal (shen
xian) may be carried on only by those
who have returned with twenty years of
service the twenty years of support and
education received from the public.
Those who wish to retire from the
world to carry on these practices may,
therefore, do so after the age of forty.
These capabilities will be the highest at¬
tainment of One World. But they may
not interfere with the public service
owed by everyone, or else the work of
the world might be neglected, and
civilization retrogress.
Therefore in the Age of One World
only the studies of the art of becoming
a spirit or immortal, and of becoming
a buddha, will be widely practised. For
One World is the ultimate Law of this
world; but the study of immortality, of
longevity without death, is even an ex¬
tension of the ultimate Law of this
world. The study of buddhahood, a
state without birth or death, implies
not merely a setting apart from the
world, but an actual going out of this
world; still more, it is a going out of
One World. If we go this far, then we
abandon the human sphere and enter
the sphere of immortals and buddhas.
Hereupon, the study of immortality
and buddhahood then begins. Compar¬
ing the two, the study of immortality is
too crude, its subtle words and pro¬
found principles are not many, and its
ability to intoxicate men's minds is
limited. As for the universality and
subtlety of the study of buddhahood, it
extends to the point where the speaking
of words is discontinued, and the ac¬
tivities of the mind are terminated.
Although having sage-wisdom, not to
move a hand [i.e. to remain quiescent]:
such self-containment is yet more pro¬
found. And further, there are also the
mysterious arts of the Five Van-
quishings and the Three Brilliants, the
application of their supernatural
powers is still more singular.
Therefore after One World there will
first be the study of immortality. After
that there will be the study of bud¬
dhahood. The inferior knowledge is the
study of immortality; the superior
knowledge is the study of buddhahood.
After the studies of immortality and
buddhahood will come the study of
roaming through the heavens. I have
another book on that subject.
The German architect Wenzel August
Hablik (1881-1934) invented "a new
architecture as the basis for a new reli¬
gion and world view". In 1924 he pub¬
lished a series of engravings entitled
Utopian Architectural Cycle to which this
Free-Standing Dome Construction
belongs. Inscription at top of engraving
reads: "This cupola can be built on the
largest scale with reinforced concrete ".

*A voyage to the centre of
JULES YERNE
by Albert Ducrocq
READ again today, most scientific
works published in the last
century seem distinctly old-
fashioned. Both the theories propound¬
ed at that time and the terminology in
which they were expressed appear out¬
dated. The laboratory equipment used
then looks to us archaic, almost
grotesque.
But Jules Verne remains eternally
young. A century after they were writ¬
ten his books are still best-sellers, not
only in France but all over the world;
only the Bible, Shakespeare and Lenin
outstrip them. Today Verne's work is
more popular than ever, and not only
among young people.
What is his secret? Above all else he
was a novelist to his fingertips, adept at
fascinating his readers with descriptions
in which poetry vies with fantasy and
captivating them with the twists and
turns of excellent plots full of adven¬
tures and mysteries prefiguring the
modern whodunit.
Jules Verne is one of the masters of
the art of suspense, which he sometimes
prolongs into severai volumes. When
you have finished Twenty Thousand
Leagues under the Sea you still do not
know the identity of the mysterious
Captain Nemo. This is only revealed in
a later book, The Mysterious Island.
The dénouement often contains a
scientific message. Here appears
another of Jules Verne's talents: he was
a consummate teacher of the kind who
stimulates the interest and enthusiasm
of his pupils by amusing and intriguing
them.
He excels at presenting abstract ideas
in attractive form. One example is the
difference of a day in calculating the
length of a trip round the world. This
discovery was made, not by Jules
Verne, but by the Portuguese explorer
Ferdinand Magellan and his crew who
were astonished to find that the date
when they reached Sanlucar was Satur¬
day 6 September 1522 whereas accor¬
ding to their logbook that day should
have been Friday the 5th; by voyaging
westwards they had "lost" a day.
Verne's novel Around the World in
Eighty Days is constructed around this
phenomenon which has not occurred to
the hero, Phileas Fogg. He thinks he has
lost his bet after being held up in Great
Britain near the end of his journey.
Then, as he looks at a newspaper, he
suddenly realizes that by travelling
eastwards he has gained a day. He had
seen the sun rise once more than people
who had stayed in England. The few
minutes he had lost here and there dur¬
ing his journey as he periodically ad¬
justed his watch to solar time had gain¬
ed him twenty-four hours.
In other cases, the solution of a prob¬
lem is purely and simply imagined by
the astonishingly inventive mind of
Jules Verne. Thus the explorers in The
Fur Country should have observed a
total eclipse of the Sun but in fact they
only observe a partial eclipse. Does this
mean that an error has slipped into the
calculation of the ephemerids? No, this
is absolutely inconceivable in view of
the degree of precision with which the
movement of the Moon is known. The
only possible explanation is that the ex- .
plorers are no longer where they think
they are because their island has become
a raft.
With this incident Jules Verne
thought up nothing less than the space
sextant which was tested by Thomas
Professor Aronnax, the narra¬
tor and one of the heroes of
Jules Verne's novel Twenty
Thousand Leagues under the
Sea (1870). In this novel Verne
created an extraordinary pre¬
cursor of the modern subma¬
rine in the Nautilus, comman¬
ded by Captain Nemo. The
illustrator has depicted Profes¬
sor Aronnax with the features
ofJules Verne, then in his early
forties.

An illustration from Jules Verne 's novel
Around the Moon (1870). The travellers
in the projectile hurtling towards the
Moon suddenly float weightlessly.
Mattingly and Henry Hartsfield on the
fourth mission of the space shuttle Col¬
umbia in the summer of 1982. This in¬
strument works on the principle of tak¬
ing account of the Moon's position in
relation to the Sun in order to locate
one's position.
These prophetic insights are all the
more astonishing since Jules Verne was
not a scientist; he had studied to be a
notary. But paradoxically his lack of
scientific training was useful to him in
the sense that it encouraged him to ex¬
press himself in language accessible to
the layman whom he wished to initiate
in scientific subjects just as he had
learned by questioning the scientists he
knew.
At Verne's request, a mathematician
friend of his calculated the speed a body
must attain in order to escape the attrac¬
tion of the earth. This speed is 11.2 km
per second, a figure that today's space
missions have made familiar. Jules
Verne was the first person to reveal it.
His two books From the Earth to the
Moon and Around the Moon were writ¬
ten on the basis of this piece of scientific
data.
Does this mean that everything is
rigorously exact in Jules Verne? Far
from it. It is astonishing that he did not
think of rockets as a means of reaching
this speed of 1 1 .2 km per second. It was
not that he knew nothing of rockets, but
he only assigned them a secondary role
as a means of braking the lunar projec¬
tile. Doubtless the nineteenth century
believed most strongly in the future of
artillery and thought of the rocket as a
' vestige of the past.
The EPCOT Center, which opened at
Walt Disney World near Orlando, Florida
(USA) in 1982 is a realization of Walt Dis¬
ney's dream of creating what he called
an "Experimental Prototype Community
of Tomorrow". A voyage through time
and space worthy of Jules Verne, the
Center is a showcase for the latest tech¬
nological developments and takes its
visitors to all the continents. Left,
"Spaceship Earth", a 55-metre-high
geosphere, dominates the entrance to
"Future World", a group of futuristic
pavilions, one of which is largely de¬
voted to a presentation of ways of life in
the 21st century

future thanks to the resources of
technology he foresaw. This is why he is
so much admired.
The essential message of his work, a
message whose full importance can be
gauged in the age of electronics and
robots, is this conviction that mankind
which through science has the power to
reorganize nature as it wishes, is the sole
creator of its future, a future with
extraordinary perspectives.
Some would like to claim that the
future holds in store a world in which
man will be dominated by the machine,
reduced to the state of a robot. We
know that is absurd. Robots are only
the agents of our will. It is we who take
the decisions. The thinking and the in¬
itiative are ours. The reality is simpler;
only yesterday man had to devote much
of his time to non-creative physical or
intellectual tasks. Today he is freed
from these tasks for reflection and
decision-making.
Jules Verne's great achievement is
that he announced that this would come
about in a masterly series of works writ¬
ten a century ago.
ALBERT DUCROCQ, French engineer,
writer, broadcaster and journalist with the
French daily newspaper Le Figaro, is a
specialist in cosmology and space matters and
was also one of the pioneers of cybernetics in
France. The most recent of his many books. Le
Futur Aujourd'hui, has just been published by
Les presses de la Cité, Paris.
The launching of the European rocket
Ariane III atKourou (French Guiana) on
4 August 1984. The rocket set two tele¬
communications satellites in orbit.
It also seems amazing that Verne did
not grasp, using the laws of ballistics,
that a state of weightlessness would exist
in his machine all through the space
flight. He simply thought that there
would be a point near the Moon where
the pull of the two planets would
neutralize each other so that passengers
and objects would float in the cabin of
the lunar projectile, a situation depicted
in an illustration which became famous.
Some would claim that one of
Verne's novels is based entirely on a
full-scale scientific heresy: Journey to
the Centre of the Earth. The pressure at
the centre of the planet is so high that
matter as we know it on the Earth's sur¬
face cannot exist. It would therefore be
inconceivable to send a man there.
But there is no reason not to imagine
that another planet in the solar system
may not conceal in its midst an immense
"ocean" similar to that which Verne
' 'And so I do not think I am going too far
when I say that there will soon be trains
ofprojectiles in which the journey from
the Earth to the Moon will be comfortably
effected," says the Jules Verne hero
Michel Ardan in From the Earth to the
Moon (1865) from which this illustration
is taken.
imagined at the centre of the Earth. This
could be the case, for example, of
Enceladus, a satellite of Saturn whose
inner mysteries may one day be ex¬
plored by man.
For there can be no doubt that the
human adventure is only just beginning
and that it has very far to take us. It was
perhaps Jules Verne's greatest merit
that he understood this. In addition to
being a novelist and a teacher Jules
Verne was above all a man who had
faith in mankind, whose fantastic
