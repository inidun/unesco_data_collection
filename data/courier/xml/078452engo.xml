UNESCO'S NUBIAN
CAMPAIGN IS LAUNCHED
March 8, I960. In the
Great Conference Hall
at Unesco House, Vitto-
rino Veronese, Director-
General of Unesco,
launches the world
appeal inaugurating the
International Campaign
for the Preservation of
the Monuments of Nubia.
UNESCO-Berretty
U
I invite governments, institutions, public or pri-
. vate foundations and men of goodwill everywhere
to contribute to the success of a task without parallel in
history." With this appeal to world-wide solidarity, Vitto-
rino Veronese, Director-General of Unesco, opened the
International Campaign for the Preservation of the Monu¬
ments of Nubia, during an impressive ceremony in
Unesco's Headquarters on March 8.
Presided over by André Malraux, French Minister of
State in charge of Cultural Affairs (see page 8), the cere¬
mony took place in the presence of heads of diplomatic
missions in Paris, of Unesco's permanent delegates and
its chief officials and of leading figures in international offi¬
cial and cultural Ufe.
After making his appeal (page 6) Unesco's Director-
General announced the names of members of the Commit¬
tee of Patrons, of which King Gustav VI Adolph of Sweden
has agreed to be Chairman, ,and the membership of the
International Action Committee which will assist in orga¬
nizing the campaign. He also named the members of the
Advisory Committee of Experts which has been set up by
the United Arab Republic. (For membership of the first
two committees see pages 14-15)

During the ceremony, messages from three heads of
state King Gustav VI Adolph of Sweden, President
Gamal Abdel Nasser of the United Arab Republic and
Ferik Ibrahim Abboud, President of the Supreme Council
of the Armed Forces and Prime Minister of the Republic
of Sudan were read by their special representatives.
The vastness and urgency of the operations which must
be undertaken to save the monuments of Nubia from inun¬
dation by the waters of the new Aswan High Dam were
evoked by King Gustav VI Adolph: "'The task is so big
and the time at our disposal so limited that we can scarcely
hope to accomplish everything that might be desirable.
But nevertheless if we are all determined to make a great
common effort, very considerable results will be obtained."
The vast number and importance of the threatened sites
and monuments in Sudanese Nubia were referred to by
the Prime Minister of the Republic of Sudan, who said
that since 1955 his country's Antiquities Service had been
working in the endangered area. Excavations had been
undertaken at Debeira, Serra, Faras and Semma. In addi¬
tion a preliminary survey had been carried out from the air
and on the ground to ascertain the number and impor¬
tance of the sites and monuments that would disappear
under the new reservoir.

"Over one hundred sites have so far been recorded,"
said his message. "Among them are four temples, many
rock graves and rock chapels, fourteen fortresses four thou¬
sand years old, twenty Christian churches, seven ancient
towns, numerous cemeteries, rock drawings and rock
inscriptions. Of these hundred sites, forty-seven will disap¬
pear as early as 1963.
"With less than three years to do the work, the Sudan
Antiquities Service cannot alone carry out such an enor¬
mous task and that is why I am appealing to the world at
large to come and help us. We shall be most grateful to
any country or scientific institution which is able to come
and assist us to explore 800 square kilometres, to excavate
the 47 known sites and those which have not yet been
discovered, to dismantle and re-erect two temples and to
save the paintings from three churches. Assistance could
be given either by sending archaeological missions to the
Sudan, or lending the services of technicians, or by giving
financial help. We are prepared to give at least fifty per
cent of the finds to contributors and, since Nubia is a little-
known country, finds are likely to be of great importance."
Help is already forthcoming, and President Abboud's
message went on to list a number of offers already accepted
by the Sudanese Government which have come from
several countries and scientific institutions. (See page 12).
President Nasser defined the im¬
perative reasons for the construc¬
tion of the new Aswan Dam in these words:
"The High Dam Project corresponds to the necessities
of life; it meets the demands of demographic, social and
economic development and should bring prosperity to the
populations of the Nile Valley. But these demands should
not make us forget that it is indispensable to assure the
safeguarding of an essential part of our heritage..."
President Nasser's message ended with a tribute to inter¬
national co-operation: "This action will constitute, we have
no doubt, a happy precedent for the generation of the
United Nations, that generation which is trying to make
the Charter a living reality, a belief and a faith and which
affirms its confidence in the value of human co-operation
and seeks a better knowledge of civilizations and cultures
despite differences of time and place."
United Nations support for Unesco's campaign was
announced in a message sent by Dag Hammarskjold, Sec¬
retary-General of the U.N., who has agreed to become a
member of the Committee of Patrons. Mr. Hammarskjold
declared:
"All who recognize the imperative human needs which
necessitate the flooding of the Nubian Valley must also
welcome and wish to further the efforts to safeguard the
threatened archaeological treasures that fo'rm so significant
a part of man's cultural heritage... I cannot but believe that
a full and generous response will be forthcoming. The
United Nations stands ready to lend Unesco and the
Governments concerned any support it can in the great
task to which they have set their hand."
ASWAN
NEAR
MOSCOW
Near to Moscow, in the laboratory of the
Ministry of Hydraulic Power Station Cons¬
truction, a model has been built of the new
Aswan High Dam. Engineers are seen here
carrying out tests on this scale model of the
mighty dam, the Sadd El Aali, which will
make possible a tremendous Increase in
the area of cultivable land and the supply
of electrical energy. Thus it holds incal¬
culable promise for the agricultural and
industrial development of the United
Arab Republic and the welfare of its people.

the
ORK has begun on the great Aswan dam. Within five years,
the Middle Valley of the Nile will be turned into a vast lake.
Wondrous structures, ranking among the most magnificent on earth, are in danger of disap¬
pearing beneath the ivaters. The dam will bring fertility to huge stretches of desert ; but
the opening up of new fields to the tractors, the provision of new sources of power to
future factories threatens to exact a terrible price.
True, ivhen the welfare of suffering human beings is at stake, then, if need be, images of
granite and porphyry must be sacrificed unhesitatingly. But no one forced to make such
a choice could contemplate without anguish the necessity for making it.
It is not easy to choose between u heritage of the past and the present well-being of a
people, living in need in the shadow of one history's most splendid legacies, it is not easy
to ichoose between temples and crops. I would he sorry for any man called on to make
that choice who could do bo without a feeling of despair; I would be sorry for any man who,
whatever decision he might reach, could bear the responsibility for that decision without
a feeling of remorse.
It is not surprising, therefore, that the governments of the United Arab Republic and
Sudan have called on an international body, on Unesco, to try to save the threatened monu¬
ments. These monuments, whose loss may be tragically near, do not belong solely to the
countries ivho hold them in trust. The whole world has the right to see them endure.
They are part of a common heritage ivhich comprises Socrates' message and the Ajanta
frescoes, the walls of Uxmal and Beethoven s symphonies. Treasures of universal value
are entitled to universal protection. When a thing of beauty, whose loveliness increases
rather than diminishes by being shared, is lost, then all men alike are the losers.
Moreover, it is not merely a question of preserving something which may otherwise be
lost; it is a question of bringing to light an as yet undiscovered tvealth for the benefit of all.
In return for the help the world gives them, the governments of Cairo and Khartoum tvill
open the whole of their countries to archaeological excavation and will alloiv half of what¬
ever tvorks of art may be unearthed by science or by hazard to go to foreign museums. They
will even agree to the transport, stone by stone, of certain monuments of Nubia.
A neiv era of magnificent enrichment is thus opened in the field of Egyptology. Instead
of a world deprived of a part of its wonders, mankind may hope for the revelation of
hitherto unknotvn marvels.
So noble a cause deserves a no less generous response. It is, therefore, with every confi¬
dence that I invite governments, institutions, public or private foundations and men of
goodwill everywhere to contribute to the success! of a task without parallel in history. Ser¬
vices, equipment and money are all needed. There are innumerable ways in which all can
help. It is fitting that from a land which throughout the centuries has been the scene of
or the stake in so many covetous disputes should spring a convincing proof of interna¬
tional solidarity.
"Egypt is « gift of the Nile" ; for countless students this was the first Greek phrase which
they learnt to translate. May the peoples of the world unite to ensure that the Nile, in
becoming a greater source of fertility and power does not bury beneath its waters marvels
which we of today have inherited from generations long since vanished.

The Unesco Courier. May 1960
The following is the full text of an address delivered in
Unesco's Headquarters on March 8 by André Malraux,
French Minister of State for Cultural Affairs. M. Malraux
was presiding at the ceremony which marked the launching
of the International Campaign for the Preservation of the
Monuments of Nubia.
temples which had been looked on only as records
have again become living witnesses; these statues have
acquired a soul. Not, to be sure, the spirit which first
informed them; but one which is their own, which we
find nowhere else but in them, and which nobody before
us has found there.
We talk of this art as a witness to a civilization, just
as we say that Romanesque art bears witness to the
Christianity of its time. Yet in fact we can only really
comprehend a culture that still survives. Egyptologists
have done noble work: but the faith of a priest of Amon,
the basic attitude of an Egyptian to the world around him,
are beyond our grasp. The humour of the ostraca, the
homely figurines, the text where a soldier calls Rameses II
by his nickname as familiarly as his veterans used
Napoleon, the worldly wisdom of the legal texts how
are we to relate these to the Book of the Dead, to the
funereal majesty of the great statues, to a civilization which
for three thousand years seemed dedicated only to the
celebration of the after-life?
Nefertiti haunts our painters
Cleopatra inspires our poets
On March 8 1960, for the first time, the nations,
though many of them even now are engaged in
overt or open conflict, have been summoned to
save by a united effort the fruits of a civilization on which
none has a pre-emptive claim.
Such an appeal, in the last century, would have seemed
fanciful. Not that Egypt was unknown then. Her
spiritual greatness was surmised, her majestic monuments
were admired. But if the West knew Egypt better than
it knew India or China, this was because it saw in her a
province of the Bible. Through the Bible, Egypt, like
Chaldaea, belonged to the dawn of our own history. Of
the forty centuries Napoleon evoked as he stood before
the Pyramids, the supreme moment was that in which
they were beheld by Moses.
Temples have power to speak
and statues acquire a soul
Then, gradually, Egypt came into her own, though still
within narrower limits than one would imagine. The
pre-eminence of Graeco-Roman architecture and sculp¬
ture was never called in question; Baudelaire could speak
of Egyptian '"naïveté." These tremendous temples, these
rapt masterpieces which for three thousand years
had seemed to commune with each other in the
same unchanging dream, were above all prized as
records, the only ones bequeathed to us by the ancient
East. Th;y fell within the domain of history rather than
of art. In 1890 as in 1820, though the West was moved
to study Egypt, it was not moved to safeguard her works.
With our own century, however, has come one of the
greatest developments in man's spiritual history. These
The only ancient Egypt which can come alive for us is
the one conveyed by its art and this is an Egypt
that never existed at all, any more than the kind of
Christianity which would be inferred from Romanesque
art if that were our only witness to it. Yet Egypt has
survived in her art, not through famous names or lists of
victories... Despite Kadesh, one of history's decisive
battles, despite the cartouches carved and recarved at the
behest of the bold pharaoh seeking to force his lineage
upon the gods, Sesostris has less meaning for us than the
unfortunate Akhnaton. The face of Queen Nefertiti
haunts our painters as Cleopatra has inspired our poets;
but whereas Cleopatra is a queen without a face, Nefertiti,
for us, is a face without a kingdom.
Egypt, then, survives by virtue of certain forms. And
today we know that these forms, like those of all religious
cultures, are not to be interpreted in terms of the living
people they profess to portray but in terms of the
conventions which raise these people to the other world.
At their highest expression, Egyptian conventions were
designed to mediate between ephemeral men and the
controlling stars. It is an art that consecrates night.
That is what we all must feel before the Sphinx at
Gizeh, as I remember doing last time I saw it at twilight.
I thought then, "'How the second, furthermost pyramid
enfolds the view, and how it makes this colossal death-
mask seem like the guardian of some trap set to lure the
heaving desert and the darkness. This is the hour when
the oldest fashioned forms recapture the soft murmur with
which the desert echoes the timeless devotions of the East;
the hour when they restore to Ufe these places where the
gods were heard; when they banish the immensity of
chaos and order the stars which seemingly emerge from
night simply to gravitate round them."

In such a way, during three thousand years, Egyptian
art translated the temporal into the eternal.
Let there be no misapprehension about this today: it
is not as a witness to the past that it moves us, nor as
what used to be called beauty. "Beauty" has become one
of our age's most potent mysteries, the inexplicable quality
which brings the Egyptian masterpieces into communion
with the statues of our own cathedrals, or the Aztec
temples, or the Indian and Chinese grottoes; with the
paintings of Cézanne and Van Gogh, with the greatest
dead and the greatest living artists; with, in short, the
whole treasury of the first world civilization.
This is an immense regeneration, of which our own
Renaissance will soon seem a diffident prefiguring. For
the first time, men have discovered a universal language
of art. We feel its influence acutely, even if we only
partly understand its nature. This tremendous store¬
house of art, of which we are now becoming 'conscious,
draws its force no doubt from its being the most signal
victory of human effort over death. To the impregnable
"nevermore" that governs the history of civilizations, this
art opposes its own mysterious grandeur.
Of the force that brought Egypt into being out of
prehistoric night, nothing now remains; but the impulse
10
which engendered these giants which are threatened today
still speaks to us as clearly as the genius of the master-
craftsmen of Chartres, or the genius of Rembrandt. The
emotion we share with the creators of these granite statues
is not even one of love, nor a common feeling for death
nor even, perhaps, a similar way of looking at their work;
yet before their work, the accents of anonymous sculptors
forgotten during two thousand years seem to us as much
untouched by the succession of empires as the accents of
mother love.
This is what brings throngs of Europeans to exhibitions
of Mexican art; of Japanese to exhibitions of French art;
and millions of Americans to see Van Gogh. This is
why the commemorative ceremonies of Rembrandt's death
were inaugurated by the last kings of Europe, and the
exhibition of our own stained glass by the brother of the
last Asian emperor. This is why, Mr. Director-General,
so many sovereign names are associated with the appeal
you are launching today.
One could not too highly praise your having conceived
a plan so magnificent and so precise in its boldness one
might say, a kind of Tennessee Valley Authority of
archaeology. It is the antithesis of the kind of gigantic
exhibitionism by which great modern states try to outbid
each other. Nor should the well-defined object of your

scheme conceal its profound significane. If Unesco is
trying to rescue the monuments of Nubia, it is because
these are in imminent danger; it goes without saying that
it would try to save other great ruins Angkor or Nara,
for instance if they were similarly threatened.
On behalf of man's artistic heritage, you are appealing
to the world's conscience as others have been doing, this
week, for the victims of the Agadir earthquake. "May we
never have to choose," you said just now, "between
porphyry statues and living men!" Yours is the first
attempt to deploy, in a rescue operation, on behalf of
statues, the immense resources usually harnessed for the
service of men. And this is perhaps because for us the
survival of statues has become an expression of life.
At the moment when our civilization divines a mysterious
transcendence in art and one of the still obscure sources
of its unity, at the moment when we are bringing into a
single, family relationship the masterpieces of so many
civilizations which knew nothing of or even hated each
other, you are proposing an action which brings all men
together to defy the forces of dissolution. Your appeal is
historic, not because it proposes to save the temples of
Nubia, but because through it the first world civilization
publicly proclaims the world's art as its indivisible heritage.
In days when the West believed its cultural heritage had
its source in Athens, it could nonetheless look on with
equanimity while the Acropolis crumbled away.
The slow flood of the Nile has reflected the melancholy
caravans of the Bible, the armies of Cambyses and
Alexander, the knights of Byzantium and Islam, the soldiers
of Napoleon. No doubt when the sand-storm blows
across it, its ancient memory no longer distinguishes the
brilliant notes of Rameses's triumph from the pathetic
dust that settles again in the wake of defeated armies^
And when the sand is scattered again, the Nile is once
more alone with its sculpted mountains, its colossal effigies
whose motionless reflection has for so long been part of
its echo of eternity.
But see, old river, whose floods allowed astrologers to
fix the most ancient date in history, men are coming now,
from all parts of the world, who will carry these giants
far away from your life-giving, destructive waters. Let
the night fall, and you will reflect again the stars under
Which Isis accomplished her funeral rites, the star of
Rameses. But the humblest worker come to rescue the
statues of Isis and Rameses will tell you something you
have always known but never heard from men before:
that there is only one action over which indifferent stars
and unchanging, murmurous rivers have no sway: it is
the action of a man who snatches something from death.

NUBIA (Continued)
THE WORLD
CAMPAIGN GETS
UNDER WAY
Ç̂
Ä INCE Unesco's campaign to save the monuments
\^r of Nubia was launched on March 8, there has
been a growing international response to the appeal by the
Director-General. Reports of action taken by governments,
institutions and individuals, of measures envisaged or being
put into operation in support of the Nubia campaign reach
Unesco daily. Here are a few examples of the kind of
help that was being offered to Unesco as this edition of
The Unesco Courier went to press at the end of March.
* The International Union of Architects, among whose
membership forty countries are represented, has declared
its wholehearted support for the campaign.
* Many offers of voluntary help have been received
from individual specialists in pre-history and archaeology.
Unesco is considering how their services can best be fitted
into the framework of each nation's share in the campaign.
* Many young people students, photographers, artists
and archaeologists have volunteered to form a special
group to carry out excavation and protection work. Many
of these offers have come from Spain, the United Kingdom
and France. So far, however, no plans have been made to
set up such a volunteer group for excavation work.
* The Government of India has offered to send an
archaeological mission to Nubia.
The Documentation Centre on Ancient Egypt in
Cairo reports that it needs the services of many specialists
to record and copy inscriptions and bas-reliefs and to make
photographic and colour-slide records. The Centre is
trying to amass as much information as possible about the
threatened monuments.
' The Belgian Government has set aside one milUon
francs in its 1960 budget as a contribution to the campaign.
This sum will be transferred to the special account opened
by Unesco as soon as parliamentary approval has been
given.
The Bruce Museum of Greenwich, Connecticut,
U.S.A. is planning a large scale campaign to raise money
in local museums throughout the country and is discussing
this project with the American Association of Museums.
* To raise funds for the Nubian Campaign specialists in
several countries are to give lectures on the work involved
in the "rescue"' operations.
Money donated by institutions and private individuals
is already reaching Unesco and is also being sent to the
banks in different countries where Unesco has opened a
special Nubia Account. (A list of these banks is published
on page 35 )
12
SEARCHES IN THE SAND have recently been carried out in the
Aniba region of Egyptian Nubia. A few weeks ago, important disco-
Acting on behalf of the Swedish National Commis¬
sion for Unesco, a Swedish Egyptologist has undertaken
a reconnaissance mission in Egyptian and Sudanese Nubia.
A similar survey, initiated by the Belgian National Com¬
mission for Unesco, has been made in the Sudan by the
Secretary-General of Belgium's Queen Elizabeth Egyptolo¬
gical Foundation, and in Egyptian Nubia by the Director
of the same Foundation.
The University Museum (Pennsylvania University)
in the U.S.A. is sending a Egyptologist to make preparatory
studies for an excavation mission in Egypt.
The Egypt Exploration Society of London is now
excavating the important site of Buhen in the Sudan and
will explore Meinarti when the work at Buhen is finished.
It has also asked for permission to excavate at Qasr Ibrim
in Egyptian Nubia. The French Government Committee
for Archaeological Excavations has asked for permission
to excavate the site at Aksha in the Sudan, and an expert
from Ghana is now in the Sudan studying the excavation
of the site at Serra.
An exhibition of Egyptology opened at the end of
March in the Brussels Palais des Beaux-Arts, the proceeds
of which will be given to the Save the Nubian Monuments
Fund. It includes many works from museums in Cairo

and Alexandria which are being loaned for exhibition
abroad for the first time. The same works will later be
on view in other countries.
In response to the appeal of the Director-General of
Unesco, national committees of action are being set up in
several countries:
In Belgium an action committee is being established
under the presidency of Baroness Lambert, and in Spain
under Alberto Martin Artajo, Secretary-General of the
Council of State. The Federal Republic of Germany has
announced the setting up of a similar action committee.
In the United States, the Cultural Activities Commit¬
tee of the U.S. National Commission for Unesco is pre¬
paring to set up a national committee of action.
' A short film, made by Unesco, has been sent to nine
major distribution agencies and another, specially prepared
for television, has been sent to stations in 28 countries.
Production has begun on two filmstrips one in colour and
the other composed of drawings which illustrate the solu¬
tions which are to be adopted to save the monuments of
Nubia.
Radio Geneva has sent a reporter to Nubia to colla¬
borate with Unesco, in the production of a documentary
programme which will 'be entered for the "Italia" com¬
petition. Other documentary programmes are being prepar¬
ed by missions which the French radio and television orga¬
nization and the Cologne television station have sent to
Nubia. The French TV programme will be offered to
stations around the world.
Later this year Unesco will bring out a series of
colour art slides on the Nubia monuments as an additional
item in its collection of colour slides illustrating the world's
art.
An advisory committee of experts has been set up to
examine offers of participation and to advise on the allo¬
cation of work for safeguarding monuments as well as on
the use of financial aid and the distribution of material
offered in return for aid.
A mission, composed of a physicist, a chemist, an
architect and a geologist is being set up to study problems
posed by the removal of temples (dismantling, transport,
reconstruction). From May 15 to September 5 it will
study these problems as they apply to three monuments:
the temple of Kalabsha, the tomb of Pennut and the Kiosk
of Kertassi.

STAMP HONOURS UNESCO'S NUBIAN CAMPAIGN
- Egypt has issued a large 10-mills stamp to commemorate
the launching of Unesco's campaign to save the
monuments of Nubia. The stamp depicts the rockhewn
facade of the Great Temple of Abu Simbel, with its
massive sandstone statues of Rameses II. This stamp
is on sale at the Unesco Philatelic Service, Unesco
House, Place de Fontenoy, Paris. (See also page 34)
Two other new Egyptian stamps (below) celebrate the
inauguration of the Aswan High Dam. One shows a
view of the Dam while the other is in the form of a
miniature poster giving, in Arabic and English, brief
facts to highlight the importance the Dam will
have for the future economy of the Nile Valley.

APES
THINGS
TO COME
by
Ritchie Calder
ow is it that its potential victim can recognise
a buzzard by its shape or shadow, and take evasive action?
How can a small boy tell you the name of an aircraft
flying high overhead? Or, for that matter, how do we
recognise "A" as the first letter of the alphabet? Or how
can we distinguish a Southern drawl from a Brooklyn
accent, or a word spoken in French from a word spoken
in Russian?
It is done by "pattern identification", the recognition
of a visual image or the form of a sound. It depends on
remembering shapes, or sounds, comparing them with
others and associating them with concepts. The alphabet
is a visual imprint in our memories. We have stored away
in our brains sounds which we can cross-refer to other
sounds and associate them with accents or languages which
we hear.
"Pattern identification" was one of the subjects most
earnestly discussed at the International Conference on
Information Processing, organised by Unesco in Paris last
year and attended by 2,000 experts from 37 countries.
This meeting of "The Computer People" (as they call
themselves) was concerned with the remarkable machines
which can do incredible sums at fantastic speeds; have
prodigious mechanical "memories" which can store infor¬
mation; can be taught to think; can control other machines;
send artificial satellites into orbit, or rockets to the moon;
and translate one language into another.
All these things are done by what is called "program¬
ming". The experts work out the ways in which informa¬
tion can be stored in the machines and instructions about
how that information can be used or recovered. A pro¬
gramme is a numerical code, like a secret service cipher
which the electronic brain-cells can unravel. The infor¬
mation and instructions have to be fed into the machines
as punch-cards or punch-tapes. This means that while
the electronic part of a computer can handle at least
10,000 "bits" of information in a second, a great deal of
time has to be spent in working out the programme and
punching out the instructions.
16
If text in (say) French is to be translated into (say)
Russian it has to be typed out on a machine which converts
it into punched symbols. The machine then analyses this
punched information, compares the words it has been given
with the comparative dictionaries which have been similarly
punch-fed into it. It makes the translation again on to
tape which operates an electric typewriter and produces the
Russian in readable form.
The ideal, of course, is to confront the machine with
the actual written page and have it quickly reproduce the
translation as another printed page. It would be even
more useful if it could take a voice speaking in French and
translate the language either as a Russian text or as an
artificial voice speaking in Russian.
ut that, at the moment, in the language of "The
Computer People" is just "'blue sky" talking about what
one wishes to happen. Nevertheless, the discussions at the
Unesco conference were optimistic about the technical
possibilities. In the past twelve years, "The Computer
People" have increased from a handful to hundreds of
thousands. Their computers have been transformed from
devices for doing arithmetic into thinking machines, with
faculties uncannily human. It is only a matter of time
before they acquire "pattern identification".
What does it involve? There is no difficulty about
electronically seeing and conveying an image. That hap¬
pens in television. The camera records the image, converts
it into electrical signals which are transmitted and reassem¬
bled on the television receiver screen. The human viewer
does the "pattern identification". The radio and the
telephone converts the spoken word into signals which are
reconstituted as the identical voice at the other end. But
the human listener does the "pattern identification".
Images and voices can be memorised electronically.
The television pictures can be stored, not just as visible
film as in the cinema but as the recording, on magnetic

tape, of the signals which, reactivated, will faithfully
reappear as a picture on the television screen. The same,
of course, is true of tape recordings of voice "patterns".
nother remarkable advance is a device Which
takes a voice, analyses its frequencies and expresses them
as a code, like sending a telegraph message instead of a
telephone voice. This code is then deciphered at the other
end and the receiving machine reproduces the code as an
artificial voice. It is not the voice of the original speaker
but it can be coded even to convey an accent; it can be
recognisably Scottish, for instance.
That is another step towards "pattern identification".
"You say 'tomahto'; and I say 'tomato'," (In the words
of the song) or the French say "formidahble" and I say
"formid'ble". And the voice-coder can tell the difference.
The technical difficulties are, however, formidahble (or
formid'ble) because for identification purposes the machine
has to have a memory which not only stores images but can
compare them associate them with the ideas which they
represent. It has not only to recognise the letter "A"; it
has to realise that it is the first letter of the alphabet. Or
"2" is no longer the number with which the digitical
computer is familiar; it is an image which has to be built
up. In arithmetic "2" is 1 plus 1 three "bits" of infor¬
mation but as the Japanese scientists, reporting on their
work on "pattern identification" at the Unesco conference,
pointed out, the image "2" needs 120 "bits" of infor¬
mation to make it identifiable.
As scientists working on recognition of speech by ma¬
chine at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology, U.S.A.,
told the conference, the analysis of speech is like chemical
analysis; its substance has to be broken down into its consti¬
tuent parts. The constituents of the spoken word must be
constants no matter in what "formula" or in what language
they are assembled. But a voice-prescription is more
difficult than the chemist's formula. A machine to be
effective will have to translate not only syllables but the
inflection the sneer, or the good-humoured laugh, -which
makes all the difference in the intention of the speaker.
Photos ILO
'FEEDING' A COMPUTOR. Whether they are required
to do incredible calculations at fantastic speeds, run factory
production lines or translate one language into another,
computing machines must first be "fed" with information
and instructions. Programming, as this is known, is done
on punch cards or punch tapes. Here (above left) a specialist
prepares a computor for a complicated task by combining
certain of its cables. After the initial work has been done,
the computor will not only carry out the task that was fed
into it on tape, but also control constantly the performance
of its work. Today many industrial products are being
fabricated by means of automation. In this automated
German thread-producing plant (above right) only a small
staff is required to control the entire flow of production.
Apart from the value of "pattern identification" in the
ultimate translation of languages, there is the mathema¬
tician's concern that the computer should be able to cope
with geometrical shapes as it has done with arithmetical
equations and, preferably, in three-dimensions.
ne immediate, and not too difficult possibility in
"pattern identification", is in abstracting. The machine
is being taught to glance at a scientific paper and select
the parts which identify the authors and the sentences
Which would give the essence of the account.
Nowadays, some 3,000,000 original scientific papers are
published in over 40,000 scientific journals every year. It
is becoming almost impossible to cope with this Niagara of
information.
Once the machine has been taught not only to memorize
but to extract and translate the significant material it
will make the information easily and quickly accessible to
those who need it and who can act upon it. The awesome
truth is that this will produce more discoveries and more
papers and more machines to cope with them.

BUDDHIST ART
OF JAPAN
.new album Japan: Ancient Buddhist Paintings
has now been published in the Unesco World Art Series.
Devoted to paintings inspired by Buddhism in Japan from
the 8th to the 12th Centuries, this album contains an im¬
pressive overall view of this Japanese art, both refined and
vigorous, which runs from mystical images to realistic por¬
traits. They are basically religious paintings preserved in
Japan's oldest monasteries; but despite this (or perhaps even
because of their nature) they speak a very human language
which can be understood today by the connoisseur and the
layman alike.
The history, the interpretation and the technique of the
paintings are described in a preface by Serge Elisséeff, director
at the Ecole des Hautes Etudes in Paris and honorary
professor at Harvard University, and in an introduction by
Takaaki Matsushita, a research officer with the Japanese
Commission for the Protection of Cultural Property.
This album, which costs $18.00; ,£6. 7s or 88.50 NF,
contains 32 full-page colour reproductions and is published
as are all the Unesco World Arts Series albums by the New
York Graphic Society by arrangement with Unesco. These
albums offer high-quality colour reproductions of works of
art previously not well-known outside their countries of origin.
They can be obtained from agents of the New York Graphic

The Lives of Buddha in 'Past and Present Worlds'
Soon after the triumph of Buddhism in Japan in 587 A.D., the Imperial Court sent to Korea for Euddhist monks who came
accompanied by craftsmencarpenters, sculptors, tile-makers and painters. The Japanese familiarized themselves with
the new crafts but also managed to preserve their own peculiar skill and national taste. Growing interest in Buddha and
in his life and his sacrifices in previous existences, also spread to art. Thus scroll painters depicted episodes in the life
of Prince Siddharta (later the Buddha Shaka) and illustrated the scripture describing the lives of Shaka in the "past and
present worlds". Above, part of a scroll showing Prince Siddharta riding out of his palace. Below, the Prince enjoying
sport in the palace. Figure, opposite page (and also the one on page 22) are from the famous "Nirvana", dated I 086.
The full work shows the Buddha Shaka (Sakyamuni) on his death-bed with heavenly and earthly beings around him.

CONFUSED PATTERN of lakes and
rivers interspersed by patches of spruce
forest seen in aerial view (left) of the
Mackenzie River delta in North West
Canada explains why Aklavik, Canada's
largest Arctic town, has been called
the "Venice of the far North." Built
on a bank of frozen silt and ice (above)
jutting into the west channel of the
2,500-miles-long Mackenzie, Aklavik
is literally resting on water. Its frozen
foundations melt in summer and the
river is "chewing" at the site. The
entire city is now being rebuilt on a
new site 70 miles away on the east
channel of the Mackenzie. Buildings
of the new city, Inuvik, seen in air
view (below) are constructed on stilts.
Northern Affairs and National
Resources, Ottawa, Canada
y-- "WS-:
y
This is the story of a small commu¬
nity in the frozen lands of the
Canadian Arctic which had to choose between a removal
"lock, stock and barrel" to a new site or staying put and
seeking by devious and expensive means to stop the "city"
from sinking below the level of the river upon whose
"floating" banks it had been built.
Aklavik began its life in 1912 as a trading post. It lies
on a bank of frozen silt and ice jutting into the west
channel of the Mackenzie River. "From the air", writes
a Canadian government official, "one looks down on a
vast confusion of lakes stretching over the horizon and
laced together by dark green patches of spruce forest.
Below, the brown waters of the Mackenzie wind down to
the sea. Far in the distance is the ocean on the north,
and the peaks of the Richardson Mountains form a back¬
drop in the west.1"
Established as a trading post to deal in the furs of the
muskrat, Aklavik also became a natural centre for the
people of those parts of the Northern Territories; indeed,
its growth had a special significance because it was one
of the few places in Canada where whites, Eskimos and
Indians lived and worked happily side by side.
With the passage of time Aklavik grew in importance.
By the mid-twenties a Royal Canadian Mounted Police
post, Anglican and Roman Catholic Missions, and a sta¬
tion of the Royal Canadian Corps of Signals had been
established there. Its medical and educational facilities
likewise increased, until Aklavik was the principal admi¬
nistrative centre and the most important community within
the Arctic Circle.
Surprisingly, the climate of the Aklavik region is rela¬
tively pleasant considering it lies about 100 miles north
of the Arctic Circle. Although the winters are long, last¬
ing at least seven months, annual snowfall is but moderate
and the low temperatures are bearable. Summers are short
and warm.
O ne thing, however, spoils Aklavik.
The city (having a cathedral it can
claim to be a city) is built on permafrost, a mixture of
frozen silt and ice more ice than silt. The top or
"active layer" of two or three feet thaws in summer and
freezes again in winter. Below that the ground is
permanently frozen to a depth of about 1,000 feet. When
the sun and heat from buildings melts the ice in the soil,
the water is unable to drain away and so great pools form
surrounded by thick mud. Hence, Aklavik has been
derisively called "The Mudtropolis of the Arctic"!
Mud apart, Aklavik is literally resting on water! More¬
over, the Mackenzie river is "'chewing" at the site and
threatens to sweep it into the Beaufort Sea. With its
foundations melting away and river erosion constantly at
work, Aklavik by the early 1950's was a community
without a future. Even if, at enormous expense, these
two great obstacles to development could be overcome,
the construction of sewers, water mains and roads, the

ARCTIC CITY (Continued)
laying down of an airfield and other vital, aspects of
reconstruction in a growing community, all combined to
pose colossal problems and to create prospects of enormous
expenditure.
In what way, tihen, could Aklavik expand? Neither
vertical nor horizontal growth was possible on such uns¬
table foundations. It became obvious as time passed that
new construction and reconstruction some government,
some private, some missionary would have to be under¬
taken.
T;he position became so untenable
that the Canadian Government
decided to move Aklavik, and in 1954 a survey team was
organized to find a suitable site. Eleven criteria were set
up by which potential sites were to be judged by the team.
The official report records: "The new site was to be a
place conducive to orderly, efficient and economical town
planning. The ground would have to be suitable for perm¬
anent sewer and water systems, foundations and roads,
and there would have to be a good site for an airfield."
This was especially vital because Aklavik is cut off
from the rest of the world for some six weeks or more
each year, during break-up and freeze-up; planes are
unable to land, ships are blocked by ice, and dog teams
are not able to cross the inhospitable terrain. Nobody
can get in or out during that time, which may easily last
for three months of each year.
The site would have to allow for adequate sewage
disposal and sand and gravel for building purposes would
have to be accessible. It would need to be located where it
could act as a transhipment point from river to sea-going
vessels. It was hoped that wood, coal and hydro-electric
power would be reasonably accessible also.
The survey team set out in March 1954, and establish¬
ed their first base on the Husky Channel. Preliminary
aerial surveys had located nine possible sites for the new
Aklavik, but ultimately all but one known as East 3
were discarded.
This elimination process itself posed much work and
strain on the team, since it meant moving base four times.
We glimpse some of the difficulties and hardships from
the fact that their camp needed tractor trains, snow¬
mobiles, dog-teams, scows, barges and light river craft
to move it, depending on the season.
s iTE East 3 was found to fill all the
essential and desirable require¬
ments. It lies on the east bank of the east channel of
the Mackenzie River, 70 miles by water from the old
Aklavik but only 35 by air. The site cannot be endangered
by flooding or erosion, though it lies on a navigable river
channel, hence the new Aklavik (or Inuvik as it has now
been named) will be able to expand as Canada's thriving
economy so demands.
Yet the problems facing the builders of this new town
still appeared insurmountable. Almost every aspect of
28
construction roads, buildings, sewers and waters mains
presented a challenge to ingenuity.
For instance, how could new roads be constructed
without destroying the all-important insulating cover of
moss, often a foot or more thick. If the moss were
removed the permafrost beneath would inevitably melt to
a depth of several feet each summer, the soil would then
become unstable and the road itself, subject to periodic
thawing and freezing, would be virtually ruined. Roads
also need to be drained, but the removal of the moss made
the digging of ditches impossible.
The solution, proved under trial, was found by laying
gravel on top of the moss, in some parts supplemented
by a protective layer of brush from cleared land. The
roads were planned also to follow the natural contours
of the land, so that draining could be achieved by "run¬
off".
The engineers then turned their attention to the
construction of buildings. They had to find a method of
construction which would not cause the permafrost under
the foundations to melt from the heat of the buildings.
The answer was to build the larger buildings on wooden
piles, driven some 20 feet into the ground. Smaller build¬
ings, including dwellings, could be built on top of a two-
foot gravel pad laid on the moss. Each method permits
air circulation to disperse the heat from the buildings,
thus protecting the foundations from the threat of melt¬
ing permafrost.
So Inuvik will ultimately be a town on stilts.
VENTUALLY, the problem of how to
build water and sewer mains which
wouldn't freeze remembering the permafrost extends
about one thousand feet downwards was ingeniously
solved by using "Utilidors". These are large, insulated,
box-like enclosures on stilts, through which the water
and sewer pipes run above the ground. To prevent the
water from freezing, however, a pipe to carry hot water
throughout the town from a central heating plant was
added, thereby providing for every home and building not
only adequate sanitary and fresh water facilities, but central
heating as well!
Yet even this clever solution in turn posed a new problem
each time a road and a Utilidor have to cross one another
a bridge is needed. And bridges are expensive. The
answer lay in planning the system of roads and Utilidors
to have as few crossings as possible.
The new town, then, will be one comprising buildings
on stilts, and houses without furnaces and without chim¬
neys. All will enjoy the luxury of central heating, hot
and cold running water, and modern sanitation all of
which were lacking in the old town.
Already much of this work has been completed, includ¬
ing the construction of a 25-classroom school with board¬
ing accommodation for 500 children, offering secondary
education to Eskimo, Indian and white children working
and playing together. In 1960 construction will include
accommodation for. the Royal Canadian Mounted Police
and the Department of Transport, the Northern Affairs

A DOOMED COMMUNITY only a few years ago, Aklavik is today building a firm future. Its people are
helping to put up new homes at Inuvik and at the same time learning new trades and skills to replace fur
trading, no longer a stable occupation. For the children (above) a 25-classroom school offering secondary
education to Eskimo, Indian and white youngsters has already been built. Below, All Saints Cathedral at the
old townsite of Aklavik. In progressive stages worth-while buildings are being moved to the new town
some of them being towed in one piece by tractor down the frozen surface of the Mackenzie River.

Administration Buildings and staff houses, and an 80-bed
hospital.
But Inuvik will also enjoy the facilities of an airport
costing more than $5 million, with a regular passenger
and air mail service. Telegraph and telephone services as
well as a radio station will also be available, while modern
methods of garbage-disposal will replace the crude
"methods" of the old Aklavik.
Having been planned with long-range growth in view,
Inuvik will have a potential of about 5,000 residents, com¬
pared to the far smaller population of the old town.
Possibly one of the most useful and significant aspects
of this project is that it is being used as a training pro¬
gramme to provide vocational skills to Eskimos, Indians
and others living in that region. This is especially im¬
portant since the fur trade, which originally forged Aklavik
as a trading post, is no longer a stable occupation, and
new trades and skills must be learned. So these people,
many of whom had ¡their homes in old Aklavik, are build¬
ing their own "replacement" town while simultaneously
learning to be carpenters, bulldozer operators, truck drivers,
electricians, engineers, and skilled workers of other kinds.
BECAUSE the new town is in itself an
education and employment plan, it
is taking longer to build than was strictly necessary. Yet
this is seen to be a good thing, in the long-term view.
In progressive stages, worth-while buildings are being
moved from the old site to the new one, some simply
being towed in one piece by tractor down the frozen Mac¬
kenzie river.
And what of the rest of doomed Aklavik?
It is thought that some Eskimos and Indians will con¬
tinue to Uve there because they don't want to move so far
from their muskrat trapping line. One day ,of course,
they will be forced to leave the sinking city. . .
Ultimately, Inuvik will be the most modern and most
progressive town north of the Arctic Circle. As such,
it will be an important transportation and trading centre.
Federal government officials will administer a vast area of
the Northern Territories from this town. It will automa¬
tically become the centre of the trapping industry of the
Mackenzie Delta.
Inuvik will also be Canada's first modern Arctic town,
its first attempt to establish an Arctic community of such
a character and design wherein all the benefits of techno¬
logy and modern science are harnessed to meet the ageless
problems of living in a cold region. The Canadian people
look upon Inuvik as a symbol of their success in adapt¬
ing an urban community to the peculiar demands of Arctic
living.
In a world so short of living-space, this is indeed a
worth-while and a highly significant project, for it pointed¬
ly suggests that all kinds of people can carve a new and
satisfying life for themselves in regions hitherto regarded
as inhospitable and unworthy of settlement and develop¬
ment.
ONE THOUSAND
NEW SCHOOLS
FOR POLAND'S
1.000TH BIRTHDAY
by Tadeusz Barucki
M..,.,.-
problem of school construction:
everywhere the school-age population is increasing enorm¬
ously, and nearly everywhere there are too few schools to
meet present needs.
In Poland this problem is especially acute, not only
because of population increases but also due to the mass
destruction that occurred during the war. Its solution calls
for the co-operation of the entire nation.
With this in view, a construction campaign, "1,000
Schools for the 1,000th anniversary of the Polish State"
(which is to be celebrated this year), was launched in the
second half of 1958. The idea received wide acclaim.
One of the best ways of celebrating the millenary, it was
agreed, would be to create as many new schools as pos¬
sible; schools of avant-garde design which would introduce
modern building concepts into little towns and into the
most remote villages; schools that would provide a pleasant
setting, helpful to teaching and to the development of
culture.
A great campaign was quickly prepared: all over the
country, committees were set up and contributions pledged

gifts of money, of building materials, of hours of work.
In November 1958, a national committee for the school
building fund had been organized, and this group had the
task of co-ordinating the various activities of the campaign.
The Association of Polish Architects responded imme¬
diately to the appeal. Its members collaborated with
the official agencies in selecting "prototypes" for future
buildings from among plans already drawn up.
This first phase of the work was followed, in the middle
of 1959, by a competition for the design of a school for
country districts or small towns. Besides classrooms, this
school would have social and cultural facilities, such as
a library, reading room, lounge, etc. In small communities,
these premises could form a cultural centre often the
first available for those who had already finished school
or had not had time to complete their studies.
Eight prizes and several commendations were awarded
in this competition for the ten projects exemplifying the
most modern architectural concepts. These will provide
a new background for daily Ufe, a modern one certain
to have an educational influence on the children and affect
their tastes and their interests. The school will acquaint
them with new ways of life which will encourage them
to improve their surroundings.
Modernism in architecture, however, is not always
immediately accepted, and there must be a carefully
thought out effort to popularize it among those interested
in the schools among teachers, helpers, parents' associa¬
tions, and even among .those drawing up the projects.
So the Association of Polish Architects has organized
in Warsaw and in several provincial centres exhibitions
and discussions on the development of modern architec¬
ture, comparing old and new methods of building and
equipping schools. The Warsaw press, giving much space
to' the campaign, has helped to develop popular interest
in the problems.
The organizers endeavoured to offer the most abundant
and diverse information on the subject, for the sake of
useful comparison. They staged an exhibition of school
design executed in the United States, which, despite

THEY HAD THE RIGHT
IDEA IN 1775
One of the first actions of the Polish National Education
Committee after its foundation in 1775the Poles
regard it as the world's first Ministry of General
Educationwas to lay down certain standards for the
construction of school buildings:
"Classrooms should be spacious, well lighted and equip¬
ped with a chimney and good stove; they should have a
pleasant appearance, the walls being decorated with pictures,
plans of cities, etc; they should always be kept clean so
that children think of them not as a prison, but as an
agréable second home."
It is interesting to compare these standards laid down
nearly 200 years ago with the stipulations given In the
report on school buildings which Unesco received a few
years ago from the International Union of Architects:
"The majority of current ideas in education should be
allowed to carry their full weight in the determination of
crchitectural practicesteaching should be adapted to the
mentality of the child and therefore architecture, adapted
to the measure of a child who Is simultaneously developing
his body, his intelligence and his personality, should be
pleasant and varied. School should be an extension of the
home. Education should respect the creative ideas of the
child and architecture in Its turn should be simple and
real, eschewing all artifice."

differences in administrative principles, syllabus, geogra¬
phic, social and economic conditions, aroused lively interest
and led to a useful exchange of ideas.
Useful exhibits and information were also provided by
the Union of the Federations of Yugoslav Architects, which
devotes much attention to school building programmes.
Polish architects living abroad co-operated in the
campaign, either by taking part in the competition or, as
did those in London, by sending in their name and that
of English colleagues, 14 designs together with complete
technical details.
Architects in Poland have accepted to draw plans for
schools free of charge. Their association is in constant
touch with organizations engaged in school construction,
and is participating in the work of the school building
commission of the International Union of Architects. Thus
it has available the latest information on new construction
throughout the world. The International Union of Archi¬
tects, of which the Polish Architects' Association is a
member, was able to offer useful recommendations
embodying the latest ideas in school design and construc¬
tion. The scope of this contribution, of which the Polish
architects made good use, was especially broad as the
International Union's activities and contacts are world¬
wide.
The Association is also consulting Unesco to obtain
full documentation on school construction in countries
where the problem has already been solved.
The "'1,000 Schools" campaign is now in full swing.
On September 1 1959, anniversary of the outbreak of
the second world war, which arouses in us such painful
memories, already the doors of many new schools were
opened for the first time to a generation of children who
are now just beginning their studies, and who will have
the task of building the world of tomorrow.

Sir,
Your February Issue (Save the Treasures of
Nubia) was nothing short of marvellous. I was
greatly moved by the appeal you launched and I
think that you would do well to open a subscrip¬
tion list because many people of modest means
would willingly make some sacrifices in order to
add, through the sum total of their small, indivi¬
dual contributions, to the tremendous amount of
aid which will be needed to bring such a project
to fruition.
I think the knowledge of all the other peoples
their hardships, intelligence, kindness, outlook and
the greatness of spirit shown by some of them
which you bring to us is a great encouragement
and makes possible, especially in such tragic cir¬
cumstances as those we recently witnessed in
Agadir, a great surge of solidarity, as well as the
hope that still greater things can be achieved.
Madame A. Argnani
Paris
Sir,
I should like to suggest a way of financing the
great undertaking in Nubia. Why not put on sale
throughout the world reproductions of the threat¬
ened treasures? These reproductions could in¬
clude postcards, pocket collections of photographs,
albums and art plates, films and art slides and
miniature reproductions of the bas-reliefs. The
provision of materials to meet every pocket would
enable the maximum number of people to parti¬
cipate.
A. Gevensan
Amiens, France
PLAIN SPOKEN OR ROSE COLOURED
Sir,
Unesco is founded on a fiction: the equality of
peoples, nations and races. This equality is true
before God, but does not exist in fact. Your
magazine therefore faces two obstacles: either you
describe the countries of the world as they are,
thus risking the criticism and resentment of your
less privileged members or else you look at every¬
thing through rose-coloured spectacles with the
result that you place the Papuan tom-tom on the
same level as Mozart. I realize that your job is
not an easy one, but is it really necessary? It may
be useful as far as popularization goes; anthropo¬
logically speaking, however, it cannot be treated
with any seriousness.
M. E. Burgard
Paris
CONSTRUCTIVE OUTLOOK
Sir,
As a regular subscriber to The Unesco Courier
I would like to say that the magazine is extremely
good in that it does what no other magazine does
it is entirely constructive and uncontroversial.

From the Unesco Ne
G_LASS AND METAL PLANT
FOOD: Waste from the metal and chemical
industries is now providing micro-fertilizer
to improve crop yields in the Soviet Union.
The waste used in this way contains copper,
zinc, manganese and other metals and the
use of less than one pound of such micro-
fertilizer (which costs practically nothing)
over two and a half acres raised wheat
yields by between 50% and 100% and
those of sugar beet by one third. The
use of glassfrit, containing zinc, molyb¬
denum, manganese and boron was found
to increase the growth of maize, barley,
grasses, fruit and berries.
THEATRE OF THE NATIONS:
Performances by companies of African
actors and dancers from the Ivory Coast
and the Mali Federation mark this
year's international season at the Theatre
of the Nations in Paris, from March 15
to July 13 at the Sarah Bernhardt Thea¬
tre. Performances by the Ivory Coast
group include plays depicting life in
West Africa and also folk dances, while
the Mali group includes the famous
masked Dogon dancers. Appearing for
the first time in the Theatre of the
Nations is the "Little Ballet Troup" of
Bombay, a Turkish song and dance en¬
semble, a Korean company presenting
ballets and operas and the British
Sadler's Wells Opera in a production of
"Oedipus Rex" by Stravinsky.
J. HE POISONED AIR: Scientists
studying air pollution in Czechoslovakia
have found that the deposit of dust in the
industrial sectors of Prague has risen from
260 tons to 700 tons per square kilometre
in recent years. The danger to public
health is reflected by increases in the incid¬
ence of certain diseases, and agricultural
losses are estimated at 70,000 tons of cereals
annually. Among the measures proposed
to combat air pollution is the use of a new
kind of smoke filter perfected by the Czech
Air Conditioning Research Institute which is
said to remove 98% of the solid particles
from smoke.
H SHORT OF SCHOOLS: By the end
of 1959 Latin America's population had
reached the record figure of 200 million
according to U.N. statistics. Due to the
impact which this has had on the econo¬
mic and social conditions of the Conti¬
nent's 20 republics, millions of people
must adapt to new ways of life and mil¬
lions of youngsters must be trained for
the tasks and techniques of modern civi¬
lization. But at least half a million
new teachers are needed for the 14 or
15 million children who today cannot
be educated because of lack of schools.
Latin America's gigantic educational
problem is reviewed in a Unesco book,
"The State of Education in Latin Ame¬
rica" (Price $2.50; 12/6; 8.75 NF).
M«ORE TOBACCO GROWN AND
SMOKED: People produced and smoked
more tobacco last year according to a report
published recently by the U.N. Food and
Agriculture Organization. World produc¬
tion in 1959, excluding that of the U.S.S.R.
and Continental China was about three mil¬
lion metric tons about 38,000 tons more
than in 1958 and about ten per cent more
than the production ten years ago. Tobacco
consumption already increased is expect¬
ed to increase still more. Production of
filter-type cigarettes, small cigars and ciga¬
rillos has meant more cigarettes per pound
of tobacco, but in the long run consumption
is being boosted by a larger number of
smokers more and more women are
smoking and "beginners" are starting to
smoke at an earlier age.
THE UNESCO
PHILATELIC SERVICE
The second commemorative stamp
of the year issued by the United
Nations Postal Administration
(above) marks a special occasion
in the history of U.N. stamps.
This is the first multicolour stamp,
printed by the photogravure pro¬
cess, to be issued by the U.N. Pos¬
tal Administration. It honours the
Economic Commission for Asia and
the Far East (ECAFE), one of the
regional commissions of the U.N.
Economic and Social Council. The
stamp, printed in 4 cent and 8 cent
denominations, has been on sale from
April II. It can be obtained from
The Unesco Philatelic Service which
has stamps and first day covers issued
by many Member States to comme¬
morate Important events in the
history of Unesco and the U.N.
(inauguration of Unesco's New
Headquarters, Human Rights Day,
World Refugee Year). As the agent
in France of the U.N. Postal Adminis¬
tration, Unesco's Philatelic Service
stocks all the United Nations stamps
currently on sale. Information on
items available, their price and the
methods of payment, will be sent
on request by Unesco's Philatelic
Service, Place de Fontenoy, Paris 7*
B STARVED OF NEWS: The urgent
need to develop information media in
Southeast Asia is stressed in the report
of a special meeting convened by
Unesco in Bangkok recently to discuss
press, film, radio and TV problems in
this part of the world. For example,
52 million additional copies of daily
newspapers would be needed to meet
the minimum requirement of ten news¬
papers for every hundred persons. Rep¬
resentatives of 22 countries attended the
meeting which was part of a survey of
information needs being made by
Unesco for the U.N. Similar meetings
are to be held in Santiago (Chile) for
Latin America, and in Addis Ababa
(Ethiopia) for Africa.
s.>OLAR POWERED FACTORIES :
Ultraviolet radiation received from the sun
is used to produce chemicals in experiments
being made with a steerable aluminium
mirror 27 feet in diameter at a solar energy
laboratory operated by the University of
Algiers. With the use of this mirror, which
is steered to follow the sun, and of raw
materials in the shape of nitrogen and
oxygen from the air, and water, it is possible
to produce nitrate fertilizers which may one
day be cheap enough to compete with other
fertilizers. Scientists hope it may event¬
ually be possible to set up solar factories
in the Atlas Mountains or on the edge of
the Sahara which could produce fertilizers
for the cultivation schemes of arid regions.
VACATIONS ABROAD: Opportu¬
nities for combining vacations with cult¬
ural and educational activities in more
than 75 countries are listed in the latest
edition of Unesco's handbook, Vacations
Abroad (1). The book contains descrip¬
tions in English, French and Spanish of
holiday possibilities with courses, study
tours and work camps. Information is
given on 1,500 programmes for vacation
study as well as on financial aid avail¬
able.
A FRICAN NEW WRITING: The
growing importance of literary works by
authors of African descent was demon¬
strated recently at an exhibition of books,
entitled "African New Writing", held at
Ibadan in Nigeria. At this display, organ¬
ized jointly by the University College of
Ibadan and the British Council, the word
African was used in its widest sense to
include all present-day authors of African
descent. The 250 books and periodicals
were by authors who came from as far
apart from the West Indies and Central
Africa and the U.S.A. and South Africa.
One striking feature was that practically all
the books were written by living authors
and had been published only recently.
