IGNORANCE AND POVERTY GO HAND IN HAND
In spite of all that our modern
age can offer to educate and
inform, illiteracy is still the lot
of something like half the
world's people. This is shown by
the upper of these two picto-
graphs, covering by continents
the proportion of illiterates
ten years of age and over. This
fact is directly linked to the
question of freedom of informa¬
tion; it means that in vast
continents like Asia and Africa
and in certain regions of Latin
America only a minute propor¬
tion of the people are capable
of reading a newspaper. For
the millions isolated by ignor¬
ance, the right to information is
lacking in reality. For most of
these people, too, as the second
pictograph illustrates, many of
the necessities of life are lacking.
Here as shown the total income
and population for the
continents. Together the two
graphics confirm the basic truth
that poverty is born of ignorance
and breeds ignorance in its turn.
Both pictographs were prepared by the
Nederlandse Stichting voorStatisttek, The
Hague.

This month's theme
FREEDOM OF
INFORMATION
Telegraph and telephone lines running
endlessly beside the highways symbolize
our modern means of mass communica¬
tion. But in many lands there are gaps in
the world network of communications.
People, denied the right to Information,
know little or nothing about the rest of
the world. With other U.N. specialized
agencies Unesco works to promote " the
free flow of ideas by word and image".
(Photo R. Viollet)
Over wide areas of the earth, hundreds of millions of people
lack adequate food, clothing and shelter. Two-thirds of
mankind, living in conditions that have changed little in the
past 2,000 years, share few, if any of the advances enjoyed by the
more fortunate nations.
A basic cause of such mass poverty is the lack of those instru¬
ments and skills which could enable people in economically under¬
developed areas to raise their living standards. Poverty is bred
of ignorance and breeds more ignorance in its turn a vicious
circle which perpetuates man's agelong plight.
Modern communication is the key that can unlock the door to
our rich heritage of knowledge. For one half of the world,
advances in press, radio and film have made possible the instan¬
taneous transmission of information and ideas through the written
and spoken word or the visual image. For the other half of the
world, the door remains shut.
Inequalities in the sharing of the facilities and techniques of
communication represent a formidable restriction on freedom of
information. This freedom, the United Nations General Assembly
has declared, "is a fundamental human right 'and the touchstone
of all the freedoms to which the United Nations is consecrated."
The United Nations and its Specialized Agencies have sought not
only to inform people everywhere of the meaning of that right,
but to translate it into a reality.
When Unesco was founded in 1945, the States signing its Consti¬
tution declared that they were "agreed and determined to develop
and increase the means of communication between their peoples
and to employ these means for the purposes of mutual understand¬
ing and a truer and more perfect knowledge of each others' lives."
Promotion of "the free flow of ideas by word and image" was set
forth as a fundamental task of Unesco.
Other Specialized Agencies are likewise helping in this objective.
Members of the International Telecommunication Union, represent¬
ing the world's telegraph, telephone and radio systems, have
pledged themselves to facilitate "relations between peoples by
means of efficient telecommunication services" and to promote
the "unrestricted transmission of news" by those means. Members
of the Universal Postal Union, who are directly concerned with
the collection and distribution of news by mail, similarly have
for their object "the organization and improvement of the various
postal services, and to further within this sphere the growth of
international collaboration/'
In this issue, The Courier is devoting a full section to the flow
of news. Writers deal with the importance of news in our daily
life, describe how it is collected and presented in the press and
discuss prospects of ensuring fuller and better coverage of world
events. In all these phases the United Nations and its Specialized
Agencies have a vital interest.
The diverse forms of mass communication provide an unrivalled
vehicle for the flow of ideas and, properly used, can do much to
help men achieve self-development and understand one another.
Poverty and ignorance are no longer domestic problems. They
are the ills of the entire globe which all nations can together
combat and so achieve in the words of the United Nations
-Charter "better standards of life in larger freedom".
Here is a problem that no teacher whatever his subject
and that no alert citizen whatever his trade or profession
can afford to ignore.

<![CDATA[
INFORMATION is becoming more and
more an essential part of our every¬
day lives. This is a development
which springs from the age of industrial
change in which we live for under
the impact of mechanical progress our
horizon has widened to such an extent
that the conditions determining our
need for information have nothing in
common with those which prevailed be¬
fore the machine age."
In the old days in fact until quite
recently a man was closely dependent
on his surroundings : the peasant's
concern was with the soil he tilled, the
craftsman's with the craft he pursued,
the manufacturer's or tradesman's with
the purely local market he supplied.
Each was thus familiar with his environ¬
ment and only needed the information
derived by day-to-day experience.
But nowadays our horizon is that of
the Earth itself; the conditions govern¬
ing production are now such that it is
dependent no longer upon local but upon
world markets, while politics are con¬
ducted no longer on a national or even on
a continental, but on a global scale : One
World, as an American writer has put
it ! So the citizens of this tremendously
expanded world can no longer be edu¬
cated solely by contact with their imme¬
diate surroundings : their education
must include "information", systemati
cally planned and effectively brought
within their reach.
In democratic countries, where univer¬
sal suffrage and the parliamentary sys¬
tem have trained the general public to
discuss the actions and statements of
governments, where the press is free and
opinions can be expressed without
constraint, citizens are normally called
upon to use their judgment, since it is
their votes which determine national
policy. But to do so, they must be gi¬
ven the right facts on which to base
their decisions.
All-powerful techniques
ROUSSEAU considered that demo¬
cracy was possible only "in a very
small State, where the people can
be brought together without difficulty
and every citizen can easily be acquaint¬
ed with all his countrymen". In his
view, anything larger than the Agora of
ancient times was too big. The advanc¬
ed level of development of our technical
resources, many of whose possibilities
have still to be explored, allows us to
take an entirely different view from
Rousseau's.
Printing has long since made possible
the diffusion of the written word in unli¬
mited quantities, while further and re¬
cent progress enables ideas to be in-
tantly conveyed, in any language, to the
uttermost parts ot the earth. Radio
allows us to listen, thousands of miles
away, to a speech while it is actually
being made, and television reveals to us
a distant speaker's every gesture and
every expression that crosses his face.
Discussions in parliaments or their
committees are brought before us in the
fullest detail, so that we have the im¬
pression of feeling their heat, of being
plunged in their atmosphere. As in
almost every transaction of present-
day civilization, we may be excused for
feeling that technique has a sure
solution for every problem submitted to
it.
The difficulty is not, therefore, in the
technique of information, but in the use
to which we are to put it. Shall we, for
instance, be able to ensure an objectivity
in our information services, recognizing
the dignity of the individual by leaving
him free to form his own opinion? In a
social structure so complex as ours, an
increasing number of questions must be
left to specialists, for most of us are not
equipped to deal with them. But to
assume that the specialist can invariably
supply the answer would be a serious
mistake. Whenever the human factor
makes itself felt and it pervades the
whole sphere of politics the expert's
specialization may become a drawback.
Much fun has been poked at the man-

sense,' but not enough" . perhaps, at
the blunders of the specialist who
oversteps the bounds of his competence.
To enable each of us to use our judg¬
ment, we need unbiased that is,
honest information. And here compli¬
cations arise, for truth is not in the
interests of everybody : it has to, be
defended against the large and power¬
fully equipped army of those whose
secret purpose is to distort it. The basic
need is for everyone to be properly in-
, formed about current events, especially
about those facts which will influence his
opinions. This does not entail revealing
the secrets of diplomacy or big business :
the simplest and most general facts pro¬
vide the best basis for reflection, and a
search for the ins and outs of things
often leads people astray. I have come
to the conclusion that, in politics, only
the relatively cultivated mind is prepar¬
ed to accept simple explanations. And
even so, the facts must be presented
objectively and dispassionately.
Let us be optimistic enough to believe
that in this field, honesty is the best po¬
licy. As business magnates and respon¬
sible advertisers are well aware, you can¬
not fool all of the people for very much
of the time. But those whose jol" it is,
or who make it their business to
collect information and make it avail¬
able to the public are naturally tempted
to pick and choose, and selection may be
based on preferences which are not al¬
ways disinterested.
This slippery slope leads from the
sphere of information to that of educa¬
tion, not to say propaganda, the bounda¬
ries between the one and the other being
sometimes almost imperceptible. Com¬
petition may serve as a corrective, but in
its absence there is a real risk of distor¬
tion. When control of the press, or of
any other source of information, be¬
comes over-centralized, supervision by
a higher authority is needed, to ensure
that all points of view find expression
and are put before the public.
To 'educate' the people
THIS brings us to another danger,
which is most rife under totalitar¬
ian governments, but from which
not even the genuinely democratic
countries are completely exempt that
of a government-controlled information
service. Since the first world war,
propaganda (to call it by its proper
name) has led to the rise of many
official bodies, undoubtedly charged
with informing the public but also
designed to "educate" in a rather
special sense of the word.
This is the point at which truth and
action, two different things, intersect.
The programme we need should include,
as its most important item, the sifting
of " information " in order to separate
truth from propaganda, both in national
and international affairs.
The United Nations and Unesco, like
' the League of Nations in its day, repre¬
sent the common factor between coun¬
tries of infinite diversity, brought toge¬
ther by the need to preserve and
safeguard peace. It would be optimistic
to suggest that closer acquaintance will
increase mutual affection; but if our
lives are to be linked we do, after all,
need to be informed about the charac¬
ters and activities of those with whom
we are likely to come into more and
more frequent 'contact in a world where
the perpetual increase of speed results
in a constant shrinkage of distances.
Complete objectivity is probably unat¬
tainable. Even historians, who are
supposed to be pledged to the service of
truth, never entirely achieve it. But we
must strive for it, either by advocating
honesty, on an international scale, in the
presentation of facts, or indirectly, by
adopting Renan's concept of truth as a
dialogue in which the conclusion is arriv¬
ed at from opposite angles. In fact,
the problem of information resembles all
the great problems of our epoch :
technology has provided us with invin¬
cible weapons ; the difficulties begin
when the human factor supervenes. But
it is precisely that factor which makes
the struggle, and life itself worth while.

A U.N. REPORT ON
PRESS FREEDOM
AND CENSORSHIP
by Salvador P. Lopez
The term - "freedom of information"
is a relatively new one. The con'-
cept, however, is old, being little
more than the aggregate of the more
familiar antecedent principles of free¬
dom of thought, freedom of expression
and freedom of the press. Where free¬
dom of information involves freedom of
thought, it has deep roots in man's
inborn thirst for knowledge, in his first
struggles against ignorance and super¬
stition, and in his earliest strivings after
truth; where, on the other hand, it
involves freedom of expression, its
mainspring lies in the emergent poli¬
tical consciousness of man, his growing
realization that this freedom is an
indispensable weapon in the struggle
against arbitrary and oppressive autho¬
rity. Freedom of information is freedom
of the press by extension; it takes into
account the other powerful media of
mass communications which modern
technology has placed in the service of
Number of countries censoring news
When a government bans or suppresses a newspaper or hinders a foreign corres¬
pondent in his task of reporting world events, it abridges the right proclaimed in the
Universal Declaration of Human Rights "To seek, receive and impart information and
ideas through any media and regardless of frontiers." This Declaration was adopted
by the United Nations in 1948. Here we see how many countries applied censorship
in I938, ten years before the Declaration, then in I948, the year of its adoption, and
finally in I952.

ideas, as well as the rights and interests
of the consumer of news.
In varying phraseology, the constitu¬
tions of the different states declare that
every citizen may freely speak, write and
publish his sentiments, on all subjects,
being responsible for the abuse of that
right : and no law shall be passed to
restrain, or abridge, the liberty of speech,
or of the press.
Soviet theorists consider freedom of
speech and of the press to be "among
the most important political freedoms".
However, their approach to securing free¬
dom of information is conditioned by
the basic Marxist opposition to private
ownership of the means of production,
distribution and exchange.
Mr. Andrei Vychinsky has stated that
"freedom of speech, of the press... are
the property of all the citizens in the
UJSjS.R., fully guaranteed by the State
upon the sole condition that they be
utilized in accord with, the interests of
the toilers and to the .end of streng¬
thening the socialist social order".
Freedom of speech and of the press
are denied to the foes of socialism, and
"every sort of attempt on their part to
utilize to the detriment of the State
that is to say, to the detriment of all the
toilers these freedoms granted to the
toilers must be classified as a counter¬
revolutionary crime."
Although the Soviet theory and prac¬
tice in this field does represent a signi¬
ficant exception, freedom of information
in the traditional Western concept has
received widespread recognition as a
fundamental human right. " Both in
theory and in law the essence of the
principle is the recognition of complete
freedom of expression, by writing or by
other means, without prior restraint, but
subject to the consequences of the law.
The limitations relate to a number of
strictly defined matters, principally libel,
slander, obscenity, sedition and national
security.
Right to harangue
By analogy with the older concepts of
freedom of thought and freedom of
expression, freedom of information
should be regarded as a fundamental
right which must be defended at all
times against infringement or denial by
governmental authority. But, in accor¬
dance with the principle that every
human right is necessarily limited by
respect for the equal rights of others,
freedom of information has unavoidable
social implications. A man's right to
impart information has no meaning of
itself except in relation to the right of
others to receive information.
The press, film, radio, and television
have become highly organized institu¬
tions requiring considerable financial
and technical resources for their ope¬
ration. The right of a man to harangue
a small group of persons at a street
corner is one thing, but the right of a
man or group to establish a newspaper,
a radio or television station is another
matter altogether.
Dr. Lopez, editor and journalist, lías been a mem¬
ber of the Philippines delegation to the United
Nations since 1946 and is now Minister in charge
of that delegation. Delegate to the united Na¬
tions Conference on Freedom of Information at
Geneva in 1948 and member of the United balions
Sub-Commission on Freedom of Information and
of the Press, 1947-52. he was appointed by the
Economic and Social Council, 1952, as first United
Nations Iiapportcur on Freedom of Information.

UNESCO COURIER . N» 3 - 1954
' Gigantic systems of information
present organized society with problems
of a different order, quantitatively as
well as qualitatively speaking. There is
need for effective guarantees to ensure
their successful operation, as well as for
measures to minimize the possibilities of
abuse and to prevent tendencies which
would sacrifice the general welfare in
the interests of private economic power.
The degree of freedom of information
varies from country to country and
technological advances are rapidly
changing the nature of the problem
everywhere. The important thing is to
determine, in the light of existing
conditions, how the principle the right
to impart information as well as the
right to receive information can be
most effectively guaranteed.
They never learn
It is doleful to remark that history
repeats itself, but doubly so to
realize that men do not seem to
learn much after each repetition. At
the end of the Second World War, the
peoples . and governments of the vic¬
torious Powers were gravely concerned
just as they had been at the end of the
First World War over the need to
safeguard and promote freedom of
Information.
They knew that nazism and fascism
had been able to mislead and dominate
millions of people as much by the
power of the word as by the power of
the sword. They - had observed that
wherever dictators seized authority in.
any country, they proceeded immedi¬
ately to place the organs of public
opinion completely under their control.
Freedom of the press and of information
was usually the first victim in their mad
quest for power.
This anxiety was clearly evident during
the drafting of the United Nations
Charter in San Francisco. Some dele¬
gations expressed the view that the
Charter should include an elaborate
declaration on human rights. However,
it was finally decided to include a
general obligation for Member States
"to take joint and separate action in co¬
operation with the Organization" to pro¬
mote "universal respect for, and obser¬
vance of, human rights and fundamental
freedoms for all without distinction as
to race, sex, language, or religion."
Accordingly, the Economic and Social
Council established forthwith a Commis¬
sion on Human Rights. Keenly aware
of two particular evils which nazism and
fascism had inflicted on mankind tota¬
litarian propaganda and racism the
Commission in turn created a Sub-Com¬
mission, on Freedom of Information and
of the press and a Sub-Commission on
the Prevention of Discrimination and
Protection of Minorities.
The world had reverted to the old
Biblical injunction that truth alone shall
make men free free of the scourge of
ignorance, superstition, hate and war.
The Constitution of Unesco marks the
rediscovery of the .ancient truth in
words of bell-like clarity: "Since wars
begin in the minds of men, it is in the
minds of men that the defences of peace
must be constructed".
In a world racked by ideological
contention and insurgent nationalism,
there has grown an ever-sharpening
struggle for the minds of men. Highly
developed techniques are being employed
for the purpose of information, propa¬
ganda and indoctrination, with the re¬
sult that each is often indistinguishable
from the others/
Inevitably in this struggle, the basic
THE FIRST READERS of the morning papers are the printers working in the
machine rooms where the giant presses pour out up to 50,000 newspapers in the hour,
printing, folding, counting and gathering them together. From here the papers go to
the despatch room where they are stocked, sorted and labelled and from where vans
take them to distributors and railway stations. Schedules must be strictly adhered to.
human right to freedom of opinion and
expression has become, in many parts of
the world, a casualty. This is true in
the authoritarian States, but even in
other countries this right is constantly
menaced by the tendency to sacrifice
freedom in the ostensible interest of
defending freedom. The result is a
complex social and political problem,
marked by continuous interplay between
abuse and' efforts to correct abuse,
between attempts to restrict freedom
and attempts to widen it.
Nazi Germany, fascist Italy and mili¬
tarist Japan have not been the only
parts of the world where, in the twen-,
tieth century, the press and other media
of information have been coerced or
suppressed.
There are, of course, countries and
regions of the world where genuine
freedom of speech and of the press is
denied on ideological grounds and where
an opposition press is not permitted to
exist. But we are here concerned with
those countries which, while professing
belief in the liberal Western concept of
freedom, have permitted authoritarian
methods to be used in silencing criticism.
Such methods may include not only
arbitrary and dictatorial measures but
action taken under legislation which,
while ostensibly aimed at the correction
of abuse or the preservation of "public
order", can and does serve the purpose
of stifling criticism and opposition.
The degree of internal censorship in
different countries is difficult to esti¬
mate at any given time. In a large part
of the world (the USSR, the mainland of
China, Albania, Bulgaria, Czechoslova¬
kia, Hungary, Poland and Rumania)
there is control in the interest of well-
defined ideological ends. In Argentina,
Portugal and Spain, varying types of
controls exist. In many parts of Latin
America there is what may be described
as a condition of "fluctuating" controls.
A government is overthrown or a crisis
develops during an election and controls
are imposed. As the situation stabilizes,
they may be eased.
But even where conditions are more
stable, the degree of control may vary
from "year to year.
A survey of the world censorship
situation is made periodically by the
Associated Press (USA), one of the
several hundred information enterprises
and professional organizations whose
co-operation was sought in the prepara¬
tion of this report. The latest such

FREEDOM OF EXPRESSION- A 20th CENTURY CASUALTY?

survey was completed by the Associated
Press toward the end of 1953. Princi-
pally concerned with the censorship of
outgoing news dispatches it also com¬
ments on internal censorship and other
restrictions in a number of countries.
The International Press Institute has
also, from . time to time, published
reports of restrictions in various
countries.
Another attempt, on a regional basis,
to survey press freedom in a number of
countries is that made periodically by
the Freedom of the Press Committee of
the Inter-American Press Association.
Reporting on conditions in the Western
Hemisphere at the Eighth Annual Meet¬
ing of the Association, held in Chicago
in October 1952, the committee stated:
"The state of freedom of expression...
has suffered serious setbacks in certain
countries, notable gains in others and
ominous trends appear in still others".
The committee went on to reaffirm a
previous conclusion that "through de¬
crees and laws which are designed to
intimidate editors and publishers of
newspapers, radio broadcasting station
owners, and managers of communica¬
tions companies, there has been created
an atmosphere of fear which not only
produces a menacing self-censorship but
deprives the public of legitimate news.
This situation obtains especially in
countries where governments restrict
the freedom of expression through those
decrees and laws but exercise no prior
censorship in editorial offices, radio
news rooms or in the offices of commu¬
nications companies in a hypocritical
simulation that freedom prevails".
There are many variations of such
practices. Where it is desired to avoid
the crude act of suppression, measures
may be taken to cut off newsprint
supply, to embarrass the newspaper by
various economic and financial pressu¬
res such as threat of foreclosure, with
drawal of govern¬
ment advertising
or denial of the
mails.
Given some sup-
plementary
measures of imple-
mentation, the
Convention
on Freedom of
Information can
make a substantial
contribution.
Remedial processes
will inevitably be
gradual. An
immediate first
step would be to
systematize, co¬
ordinate and
enlarge upon the
reports already
being compiled by
such organizations
as the Associated
Press, the Inter¬
national Press
Institute and the
Inter - American
Press Association.
A world - wide
survey of internal
censorship
practices and
abuses, repressions
and violations of.
freedom of infor¬
mation should be
undertaken perio¬
dically by a rapporteur on freedom of
information, using reliable data from
non-governmental professional sources.
While the survey would be submitted to
the Economic and Social Council,
information enterprises and professional
associations everywhere would be en¬
couraged to give it the widest possible
publicity. .
Peacetime censorship of dispatches
which a correspondent sends from one
country to another has plagued agencies
and correspondents ever since the deve¬
lopment of radio and telegraphic com¬
munications has made it an easy matter

Even more dangerous perhaps is the
practice of government telegraph offices -
delaying "unfriendly" dispatches until
they are "no longer newsworthy. Govern¬
ment officials may also be informed sub
rosa of the content of "unfriendly" dis¬
patches, with the result that the
correspondent may subsequently expe¬
rience difficulties with his news sources
and possibly in obtaining re-entry per¬
mits and visas.
An even more insidious form of
censorship consists simply of a discreet
warning that while the correspondent is
nominally free to write and. send what
he likes, "unfriendly" articles about the
host country will lead to "difficulties".
What are the correctives? Attempts
to alleviate censorship are as old as the
problem itself. The League of Nations
Conference of Press Experts, held in
Geneva in 1927, proclaimed that no form
of censorship should be established or
maintained except "for vital reasons",
and if it existed it should be abolished.
However, if it continued to exist, the
conference thought there should be cer¬
tain minimum guarantees, e.g., tele¬
grams should be examined by specialists
and sent as quickly as possible; corres¬
pondents should be instructed by the
specialists and should be informed of
suppressed passages and of delays in
transmission; there should be refunds
when press telegrams are paid in
advance, corresponding to the number of
words cut; and all correspondents
should receive equal treatment.
The world was not in a sufficiently
liberal mood however; shortly after¬
wards began the downhill descent into
the Second World War with its closing
of doors and windows and its widespread
censorship.
After the Second World War, the first
attempts to throw off the shackles of
wartime censorship found expression in
the Declaration of Chapultepec adopted

this means. Like
internal censorship
and control of the
domestic press,
this is a "fluctuat¬

usually difficult to
survey and . assess
at any given time.
And it may be

ways, some overt,
some covert.

most other parts' of
this continent, news-,

small while illiteracy
rates are high, so the
advantages of radio are
obvious. Information,

cal programme to at¬

news bulletins and
local announcements.
(Photos Kitrosser.)
IN the twentieth century news has
become a necessity for millions of
people. The desire of men and
women to be informed, expanding With
the growth of education, has been
accompanied by immense.progress in the
technical, development of means of
communication. Today, in fact, there is
no longer any technical barrier to stop
or even to slow down the exchange of
information.
And yet the facts¡ and figures collected
by the United Nations show many gaps
in the world network of communications
facilities. Unesco, concerned with the
quality and quantity of news reaching
the public, has surveyed the world's in¬
formation resources and has drawn up a
complete inventory over a period of five
years.
These investigations show that very
few countries or territories are entirely
lacking in some form of press, film or
radio facilities. But the question is
whether the "man in the street" can
count, as part of his day-to-day ex¬
perience, upon access to news concerning
more than purely village affairs. On
this basis, a large part of the world must
still be classified as under-developed.
The world picture must necessarily be
shown in general terms. Firstly it is not
easy to establish a hard and fast line
between sufficient and insufficient news
facilities; secondly certain countries may
be relatively well equipped in, say,
radio, but have a far from satisfactory
press; thirdly, within generally under¬
developed areas are found occasional
"pockets" where the information media
are highly developed. _
With these reservations it may be said
that a privileged zone is made up of
Canada and the United States; the
whole of Europe, but more particularly
western and northern Europe; Australia,
.New Zealand and Japan. By contrast,
the under-developed zone, which is
much, vaster, includes practically the
whole of Africa, the Middle East,
Central and Southeast Asia, and to a
certain extent, Central and South
America (1).
IN the field of press, the United
States is by far the luckiest of all
countries with an average annual
consumption of newsprint exceeding
35 kilos per inhabitant. With smaller
papers, though with an equal or even
higher distribution per population, the

highest figures in Europe and Oceania
reach approximately 15 kilos per in¬
habitant. By comparison, the highest
figures reached in the under-developed
zones are: for South America, 8 kilos;
for Africa, 5 kilos; for Asia, 3.6 kilos.
However, the disparity between the
United States and Europe takes no
account of the fact that while European
newspapers have fewer pages, they do
not necessarily contain less news than
American papers.
In Africa, out of fifty-odd territories,
only nine (Egypt, the Union of South
Africa, Southern Rhodesia, the Gold
Coast, the three French North African
territories and the islands of Mauritius
and Réunion) have more than ten
copies of daily newspapers per 1,000
inhabitants. Of these nine, only one,
the Union of South Africa, has more
than fifty. In Asia, the situation is
similar, only eight countries having
more than ten copies per 1,000. For
Central and Southern Asia, including
India, Pakistan, Indonesia, Iran, the
figure varies from less than one to a
maximum of six. In Asia, however, we
find two countries in which the press
has attained what might be called full
development: Israel, with 286 copies per
1,000 inhabitants, and Japan with 334.
There are marked differences in the
structure of communications facilities,
one of the chief reasons perhaps being
political. Unlike the situation in Africa,
where most territories are non-self-
governing, the great majority of Asian
countries are independent States. A
striking characteristic of the press in
Asia is the large number of daily news¬
papers that appear in many countries:
thirty or more in Burma, Syria,
Thailand; fifty-five to sixty in Iraq and
Pakistan, nearly 100 in Indonesia, 578 in
India. Yet the average circulation of
these newspapers is about 3,000 copies;
only a few exceed 25,000.
In Central and South America the
press is relatively more developed, in the
sense that, with the exception of Haiti
and one or two Non-Self-Governing
Territories, nowhere are there less than
ten copies per 1,000 inhabitants. But
for the majority of countries the figure
is under" fifty, and for only three
(Argentina, Uruguay and Panama) is it
over 100.
The total world circulation of daily
newspapers is 217,174,490. Europe, with
400,000,000 inhabitants, leads with
92,228,400. North America, with
225,000,000 inhabitants, has the second

A NEWSFLASH
CROSSES
THE WORLD
by Percy Winner ,
It's well after dark on a hot midsummer night in a small
town, let's call it Jonesville, though that's not its real name
in the southwestern corner of the prairie state of Kansas
close to the centre of the United States of America. Most people
are in bed trying to sleep despite the heat, which is unusual
even for the time of the year. Here and there, however, some
are just passing the time.
For example, there's a group of men on the porch of the hotel
on Main Street. Among them is Bill Sommers, swaying in his
favourite rocking chair, smoking his corn-cob pipe, listening
with half an ear to two young fellows, Jim Peters and Artie
Carruthers, just back from action in Korea, and now complain¬
ing to each other that nothing ever happens in Jonesville; and
also to a vague, heavy droning sound somewhere in the distance.
Further along Main Street in the office of the weekly farm
newspaper which we can call the Amos County Gazette
Harry Eccles, the editor and the local "stringer" (part-time cor¬
respondent) of the Associated Press (AP) is busy "putting the
paper to bed" which means getting it ready to be printed and
circulated. He too hears the distant noise and wonders what it
can be.
Suddenly," on the porch of the hotel, Jim and Artie stop
talking at the same moment. Both of them listen intently.
"Say," says Jim to Bill Sommers, "there never used to be big
planes flying over there. And that sure is a big one." Artie,
bolting from the group to the middle of the street, looks upward
toward the starless, velvety black of the night sky. He points
excitedly toward the west, shouting: "Look, a real big one, low,
and in trouble, I'm sure."
By now the distant drone has become a fretful, coughing
roar. Eccles at the window of his office, and other residents
of the town, at their "windows, can now see plainly in the sky
Percy Winner of Unesco's Press Division has had news agency experience
including service as toi respondent of the Associated Press in London, Paris
and Rome ; correspondent in Paris and chief of the Rome Bureau of the Inter¬
national l\ews Service; chief correspondent m New York of the Havas News
Agency of France (pre-war predecessor of the Agence-France-Presse). Ile has

Company and a broadcaster in French for the Columbia Broadcasting System.
the wide-spaced red and green wing lights of a large plane,
and between them, close to the red light, two spurts of flame.
Artie is running in the direction of the plane's movement, and
as he passes the office of the Gazette, he calls out: "Two motors
afire. She's going to crash, sure. Get help, help..."
Before the plane swoops downward, Editor Eccles' warning
telephone call has been received by the correspondent of the
AP in Dodge City, Kansas. Well before the real tragedy occurs

help Editor Eccles, have brought word that there can't possibly
be survivors, Kansas City knows that Jonesville has been the.
scene of a news event of international importance. For the
plane that crashed for reasons as yet unknown was
carrying a group of leading government officials from several
countries, including the United States, Australia, Great Britain,
France, Norway and a number of South American countries
all due to attend a conference in San Francisco.
The news everything that can be learned from Jonesville,
where a staff man of the AP is now present, and everything
that has thus far been learned about the plane and its dis¬
tinguished passengers is now moving over Kansas City's
20 wire circuits, especially to New York and to San Francisco,
from where it is being relayed across the Atlantic and Pacific
Oceans, and also southward to Latin America.
'Big six' of the agencies
THE Associated Press which we have chosen as an example
of a vehicle for the transmission of a news event in one
part of the world to newspaper readers, radio listeners and
television viewers in a number of countries in the same and
other parts of the world, is one of the so-called world tele¬
graphic news agencies. There are only six such world agencies,
the other five are the Agence France Presse of France, Reuters
of Great Britain, Tass of the Soviet Union, and the United
Press and International News Service of the United States.
This term a world agency is used to denote an agency
which maintains a network of correspondents to collect news
in a great number of countries and a headquarters staff which
edits these news items, as well as domestic " news, and sends
them as quickly as possible to the agency's bureaux abroad
for local distribution to newspapers and broadcasting stations;
to national agencies abroad with- which it has working agree¬
ments; and directly to press and radio subscribers abroad.
Naturally, the AP has, in common with the other five world
agencies, an extensive network of telecommunications facilities
for gathering and transmitting news. In addition- to large
offices in such cities as New York, Washington, Kansas City,
San Francisco, Los Angeles, it has in the United States some
100 bureaux, some staffed by a single correspondent; and it
also has many "stringers" like Editor Eccles in Jonesville. The
collection of news outside the United States is carried out by a
staff of about 50 bureaux and by a large number of corres¬
pondents working in every continent. The number of countries
in which n the AP has subscribers is now more than 70.
Because of the nationality and prominence of some of the
victims of the disaster at Jonesville, the news is of special
interest all over the world, especially in the British Common¬
wealth, Western Europe and Latin America. From New York
" to which the news has been transmitted over the AP "A" wire
from Kansas City, it is relayed by a cable which runs directly
to the AP /'world desk" in. London". To this central routing
point, thousands of words of news come daily, most of ' them
concerning happenings in -the. United States, the Western
hemisphere generally and the Pacific area.
From London, the news is distributed in the United Kingdom
by an organization called the Press Association. It is also sent
by leased teleprinter to a large number of subscribers in Europe.
The teleprinter network links London with Amsterdam, Berlin,
Brussels, Copenhagen, Frankfurt, Hamburg, Luxembourg, Milan,
Oslo, Paris, Rome," Stockholm, Vienna. Connecting circuits
supply subscribers in France, Germany, the Netherlands, Scan¬
dinavia, Italy and Belgium, who are not in the cities mentioned
above. From Stockholm, the news goes to Finland; and from
Frankfurt, it goes to Hungary, Greece, Turkey, Egypt, Israel,
Malaya, Burma and Iran.
Subscribers in Latin America get the news by radio newscast
from New York, a service transmitted for 18 hours daily; or by
radio-teleprinter service, also from New York. There are also
wire connections to Mexico City and Havana.
From San Francisco, the western terminus of the "A" wire
from Kansas City, the news is conveyed by radio-teleprinter to
the entire Pacific area. The news from the small town in the
southwestern corner of a prairie state is received in such distant
places as Manila, Tokyo, Singapore and Hong Kong.
Thanks to news exchange arrangements between world
agencies, the story of the plane crash at Jonesville has been
made available in New York 'by the . AP to Reuters and the
Agence-France-Presse. Other agencies with which exchange
' arrangements exist are the Canadian Press, the Australian
Associated Press, the Austria Presse Agentür, TASS, the
Associated Press of Pakistan, the Kyodo News Service of Japan,
the Agentie de Informatii Telegrafice of Rumania, the Magyar
Tavirati Iroda of Hungary, the Haptong Tongshin of (South)
Korea, and the New Zealand Press Association.
Millions have been informed
PARALLEL with the AP, the other two world telegraphic news
agencies in the United States the United Press and the
International News Service have provided their sub¬
scribers and associated agencies in many parts of the world
with full information about the crash at Jonesville. All three
agencies have given service to radio networks and television
stations both in the United States and abroad. Moreover, cor¬
respondents in New York, Washington and San Francisco of
major foreign newspapers have sent articles about the news
and reporters of foreign radio networks have broadcast it.
Within a few hours of the moment on a hot midsummer
night when two young men lamented that nothing ever happens
in Jonesville, Kansas, U.S.A., many millions of persons all over
the world are fully informed by news agencies, newspapers,
radio and television of the tragic event that occured there.

A PAGE TAKES SHAPE on the "stone" the table on which the newspaper type is assembled in a
metal frame called a forme. Here a sub-editor supervises the make-up of the page as it is placed in the
forme according to an editorial plan. (Photo C.O.I.)
There are two essential qualities of a
good newspaper freedom and
responsibility.
Neither is exclusively dependent upon
its Editor and. controllers. Both depend
also upon the acceptance by Governments
and officials of all kinds, of their public
obligation to make fully and freely
available all the facts required for the
full and impartial reporting of public
affairs. And their acceptance also of the
obligation to permit full and free
comment on those facts.
Nor is this all. Freedom and respon¬
sibility are not qualities which grow of
themselves.- They require the support '
and stimulation of a public opinion which
recognizes their value. Newspapers are
as good as their readers make them. The
quality of news depends as much upon
those who read it as those who write it.
It is obvious that neither of these
circumstances exists "in all parts of the
world. Over great areas newspapers are
regarded as the instruments of Govern¬
ments to report only what is acceptable
and . useful to those in power and to
comment only as officialdom requires.
In many other areas where the press is
nominally free, the obstacles that stand
in the way of full and honest reporting
are formidable obstacles in some cases
Franols Williams, Bnlish journalist and author,
has long been active in efforts through the United
Nations to improve international communication
" of neics. He is the author oí "Press. Parliament
and People", a study of the relationship between
governments and newspapers. His . latest work,

communications and the Press", has recently been
published by Unesco.
of legal prohibition, in others of official
attitude.
Nor is a public "opinion which is ready
to accept still less to demand honest
and impartial reporting and objective
comment, by any means universal even
in those countries where newspapers are
nominally free, and democratic institu¬
tions a part of the constitution. Where
political development is - in its early
stages, and where education is restricted
and illiteracy high, public opinion, al¬
though it may nominally embrace the
need for a free press, is unlikely to be
much interested in a responsible one.
The price of circulation and with it of
economic survival in such circumstances
may be not responsibility but irres¬
ponsibility.
It is necessary to say this since it is
unrealistic to write of the quality of the
news without appreciating that many of
the circumstances which make quality in
news reporting possible are wholly or
partially non-existent over large areas of
the world."
The basic principles of good journalism
may be universal. The factors which
alone make possible their practical
application are far from being so.
Even where such principles are
theoretically accepted the means ,to
translate them into positive term^ do not
exist in considerable areas of the world
a fact which those who look at the
problems of journalism from levels of
sophistication made possible by the
existence of mature press" systems need
to bear in mind.
I have recently been engaged on an
examination of the press of one Middle
Eastern country, Iraq. Iraq is more for¬
tunate than many in the fact that its na¬
tural resources, particularly in oil, are
enabling it to carry through a substan¬
tial programme of economic and educa¬
tional development. Great dams, irriga¬
tion schemes and electric power projects
are being carried through. New schools
and colleges are being built.
The problem of mass illiteracy is also
being tackled, yet many of the news¬
papers lag behind and the vast majority
are still small and economically insecure.
Their circulations are to be counted in a
great many cases in a few hundreds.
Even in the case of the most successful,
circulation is no more than five or six
thousand at the most. Facilities for
reliable reporting even of domestic
affairs are almost non-existent. . There
is no domestic news agency, hardly any
consistent exchange of information bet¬
ween the leading towns. The supply of
international news is small : its trans¬
mission costly.
Such conditions can be duplicated in
many other parts of the~world indeed
in very many areas they are much worse.
Where they exist the quality of news is
bound to be affected for such quality
depends first of all upon existence of the
means to report adequately, fairly, and
objectively all happenings of public im¬
portance both domestic and international.

Co-operative news agencies linked by
exchange and other agreements with the
great world news agencies seem. to me,
therefore, to be an essential part of the
effort to raise' the quality of news
throughout large parts of the world.
Advice and assistance in their develop¬
ment is one of the first tasks with which-
all who are concerned in raising the
quality of news should concern them¬
selves. . .
This being said, what are the essential
qualities which ought to be displayed by
newspapers which do not, suffer from
such disabilities ? .
I believe the first essential to be the
separation of news from comment. It is
part of the responsibility of a newspaper
to comment on what is important in the
news of the day : it is "no less a part of
its responsibility to leave the reader in
no doubt where reporting ends and
comment begins.
Unbalanced news
Stated thus baldly the issue seems
clear and simple a mere matter of
restricting the reporting of events
and policy developments to the news
pages and the comment on them to the
leader page. It is far from being so in
fact.
. In the first place iL is impossible for
any newspaper serviced by a highly
developed and mature system of national
and international news collection to print
all the news that flows into its office
from all parts of the world almost every
hour of the day and "night. There must
be selection especially so where news¬
print is scarce and costly and newspapers
are severely restricted in space. And the
very fact of selection implies comment.
There is no comment more absolute than
the decision to exclude a piece of news
as unimportant.
Nor does the comment implicit in the
inevitable exercise of editorial judgment
as to the relative importance of the news
available end with the decision to print
or not to print." It finds hardly less
significant expression in the placing and
presentation of the news selected the
decision as to whether it shall go on the
front page or on an inside page, at the
top of a column or at the bottom, shall
have large headlines or small.
Such indirect comment is inevitable.
But it has been made more emphatic
-with the development of modern tech¬
niques of newspaper make-up. These
tend to concentrate immense resources
of typographical skill on making the
appearance of a page attractive even at
the expense of a lack of balance in the
treatment of the news itself.
Reader's safeguard
The only safeguard open to the reader
in such circumstances is that of a
choice of newspapers. With such a
choice he can at least elect to buy the
newspaper whose editorial judgment of
news values experience has shown to be
nearest to his own or whose bias in the
selection and presentation of news he it-
aware of and can -consequently be on
watch against. And if he is wise he can
buy a second paper against which to
check the first.
. Objectivity is one of the most difficult
of all virtues. In the nature of things
journalists like other men are
subjective thinkers. They are writing
for readers who .are also subjective
thinkers. A policy decision which to the
supporters of the Government making it
may quite honestly appear wise and
statesmanlike may no less honestly
appear to its opponents as shortsighted
and foolish. It is almost impossible to
avoid some reflection of this in the treat¬
ment and headlining of news.
- Gross bias can be avoided by the exer¬
cise of normal professional standards of
accuracy and fairness. Bias of a' less '
obvious kind is almost impossible to
avoid because it may be no more than
the reflection of the impact of the news
upon the editor or sub-editor himself or
represent his almost instinctive profes¬
sional appreciation of how the news will
strike his particular readers. , -
I said earlier that ideally there should
be a complete separation of news and
comment. Yet within this ideal there
are, I think, certain exceptions which,
so long as they are made openly and
without " disguise, can be useful and
justifiable.
. The increasing complexity of much in¬
ternational and economic news is such
that it is difficult for the ordinary gene¬
ral reader to find his way among much
of it without expert guidance. In such
circumstances the bare reporting of facts
may itself be misleading, since without
help " the reader cannot possibly un¬
derstand their implications.
It seems to me, therefore, that in such
fields the quality of news may be not
reduced but enhanced where an ex¬
perienced correspondent diplomatic, po¬
litical, economic or whatever the subject
may benot only reports the facts but
himself interprets and even comments
upon them. What is essential is that it
should always be. made clear that he is
doing so and that he himself should
plainly differentiate between what is re¬
port and what is comment in his article.
The means to collect and distribute
news; acceptance of the responsibility to
report the facts not necessarily all of
them, for that, indeed, would often be
physically impossible," but enough" of
those that are significant to give a. fair
and balanced picture: as clear" a discrimi-
UNESCO COURIER - N» 3 - 1954
nation between news and comment as
the inherently subjective nature of most
human judgment- makes possible all
these are necessary if the quality of news
is to be maintained.
But more still is needed continuity of
reporting. And this is a quality not al¬
ways to be found even in many other¬
wise excellent papers.
In the recent survey of news treatment
by seventeen major dailies made by Unes¬
co in the publication "One Week's News"
the conclusion was reached that although
most of the seventeen papers referred to
all major events in one form and another
the news was seldom presented in a sys¬
tematic way.
Journalistic defect
This is true of almost all newspapers
of large circulation. It is becoming
not less but more so with increasing
emphasis on display and headline treat¬
ment.
"The reader consequently", continues
the Unesco report, "has to make an effort
to inform himself. If he really wants to
know what has occurred his close atten¬
tion-is required even for papers wThich
are intended to be read quickly and su¬
perficially".
. Although this absence of systematic
reporting is a defect of modern journal-
. ism and one to which those who are pro¬
fessionally concerned about the quality of
news need to give their most serious con¬
sideration, its indirect effect may not be
wholly bad. . If it should, indee'd, bring
the reader "to make an effort to inform
himself" then its ultimate consequences
are likely to be excellent. In the last
resort the quality of news depends, as
I said earlier, upon the reader no less
than the writer. The wise reader is he
who takes what his newspaper has to
offer, not as a final statement on events,
but as raw material from which - to
fashion an independent judgment of his
own.- y

A DOUBLE CHECK FOR
by François Le Lionnais
FLYING SAUCER REPORTS, rash claims of imminent inter-planetary flights and even stories of visitors
from other worlds have become almost commonplace nowadays. As long as such stories are kept In their
proper category imaginative writing no great harm is done. But once the public starts to believe
pseudo-scientific stones a real danger arises. A photograph of a fly's throat (right) as seen under a
microscope, could be presented as a "Man from Mars", just as, recently, a retouched photo was published
as an authentic shot of a "flying saucer". Scientists and science writers are combatting such practices
by making complete and accurate scientific information available to the press.
Inaccurate scientific information
and, what is even worse, pseudo-
sciences, flourish today as never
before. This is a symptom of a very
real sickness in our world which is
not properly recognized.
We need not be unduly concerned
by the slight errors, minor misunder¬
standings or involuntary distortions
that arise. These may be regrettable,
but they are inevitable and do no
very great harm. The pseudo-scien¬
ces especially astrology, radiesthe-
sia and forms of occultism in medi¬
cine and new myths, like the story
of the flying saucers, however, should
be denounced. These do a great deal
of harm. .If writers, publishers and
newspaper owners give these wild
stories and pseudo-sciences space in
their columnsand often a great deal

teaching.
of space it is, no doubt, because they
do not realize the dangers. But the
poisoning of the public mind as the
natural corollary of an enterprising
commercial policy is something which
science cannot accept.
It is one thing to criticize and quite
another to find a solution. To know
what is wrong does not necessarily
tell us how to remedy it. Journalists
have to get through their work quick¬
ly for the presses will not wait
and, at the same time, to appear to
. know all about everything, which they
obviously cannot do. And they have
to accept this challenge every day or
every week. How can we really check
that a. piece of information is reliable
when we are pressed for time?
A recent innovation in Prance
seems to point to one satisfactory way
of solving this problem. This is a
Telephonic Science Reference Service
inaugurated by the. French Associa¬
tion of Science Writers.
]]>

<page number="15">
<![CDATA[
This service is assured by some fifty
experts who, between them, cover the
whole field of science. Each of them
has agreed to answer questions, with¬
out charge, for journalists who wish
to consult them or to check on the "
accuracy of a piece of science news.
The names of these experts, printed
on a large wall board and in a pocket-
size booklet, were distributed at a re¬
cent press conference in Paris.
This new departure has been wel¬
comed enthusiastically, not only by
the French daily newspapers, but also
by the various specialized branches of
the press technical journals, wo-
men's magazines, children's papers
and general periodicals and by the
many foreign correspondents in
Paris.
The new Science Reference Service
is now busily at work, covering all sub¬
jects from mathematics to the history
of science, and ranging over physics,
chemistry, biology, psychology and so¬
cial science. The experts are con¬
stantly consulted, and every day are
able to do something to advance the
sound development of scientific train¬
ing in France, by cutting off false
information at the source, by correct¬
ing serious errors which might have
been put out together with correct
information, by - providing useful
comment or clarifying details about
news items, or by making clear the
real importance of some discovery
or an invention which might have
been exaggerated or under-estimated.
Prevention is better than cure. An
entertaining and instructive . book .
could already be written about the -
false information which has not been
published in the last few months. This
Service is certainly an idea which
might well be copied elsewhere.
By no means all the scientific errors
or mis-statements appear in publica¬
tions. Most people have heard .about
broadcasting "scares", such as the
programme broadcast some years ago
which described, as though it were
actually taking place, the invasion of
the United States of America by the
' inhabitants of Mars. The illusion
created was so real and caused such
panic that it led to several fatal acci¬
dents. A few years later, a broadcast
in France, caused a similar scare
although the results were less tragic.
Such incidents in the broadcasting
world are, fortunately, rare, because
those in charge of the radio are con¬
scious of the formidable power they
wield and avoid abusing it.
Those at the head of affairs today
have plenty of problems to solve, but
the intellectual and moral health of
the people, and their resistance to va¬
rious forms of mental toxics is cer¬
tainly not the least important. , This
is a vital point in scientific informa¬
tion, and in the work that science
writers have to do today.
This work carried on through the
media of mass communication the
press, publishing, 'lecturing, radio,
television, films, photography, mu¬
seums, etc consists in the diffusing
of full and reliable scientific informa¬
tion, not only to add to the sum of
our knowledge but, even more impor¬
tant, so as to develop our critical fa¬
culty and, as a result, our capacity
for effective practical action. For
science is not simply a store-house of
knowledge : it also offers an ideal
training ground for the mind. Its
value as a means of training is prob¬
ably the soundest argument in favour
-of the "right to culture".

THE DAILY PRESS is full of raw material for classroom" use in geography, history, current events and civic affairs
lessons. Even the, unhappily frequent, street accident report can help to bring hornea lesson in road safety drill.
THE great thing about widespread -literacy, it has been
remarked, is that it has conferred on man the inestimable
blessing -of being able to read the daily press. It is
certainly true that societies which are literate (and which some¬
times like to think of themselves as civilized on that account)
devour quite remarkable quantities of newsprint : for most
people, in fact, reading means reading the newspaper before
anything else and maybe to the. exclusion of anything else.
But just as it is fair to say that the word "newspaper" is
seldom literally accurate, so the word "reading" is for the most
part a courtesy description of what a
newspaper demands of its clientele The
modern newspaper is in reality a topical
magazine; the news is provided not so
much with a view to giving information as
entertainment; it is intended less to
illumine than to dazzle. ...
"By his company shall ye know him" : not only is this true of
the news to be found in the press, it is also true of the form
that the news takes. It explains the emphasis on the human
angle, the emotional afflatus, the over-dramatizations, that
take one often so far from the humblest origins of the story.
There are, of course, the "class" newspapers which are to be
found in nearly every country and which take a serious view of
their mission. They are sober, factual organs of limited
circulation . and considerable influence. They do their best to

Affairs London, and then Information Officer at the United Nations Tech¬
nical Assistance Board. He is now carrying out research into further edu¬

observe Scott's famous dictum that news is sacred, opinion is
free. And yet one has only to examine simultaneous issues of,
say, the London and New York "'Times" and "Le Monde" to be
struck with their dissimilarity and even, on many occasions,
with their disparity. Their record of the facts of an event or
conference may well.be much the same, though pressure of
space makes this far from certain. Their estimate of trends,
their interpretation of causes and motives, indeed the whole
character and spirit of their make-up will almost certainly be
profoundly different one from the other.
Reading or at any rate cultivating the
newspaper is not, : therefore, a trivial
undertaking. The press today has a
dominating influence for better or worse,
on the quality of social life. At the very
least, in the words of the P.E.P. (Political
and Economic Planning) Report, it is the
main agenda-making body for the daily conversation of the
This being so, the reader of the newspaper does
well to be alert and on his guard (which is not the same as
being cynical).
He needs to know what kind of a thing a newspaper, his
newspaper, aims to be; how it comes into existence every day,
and what financial arrangements enable it to survive from year
to year; he needs to understand the different character of its
assorted ingredients, to distinguish sharply between an editorial
and a news-story and a feature-article (particularly when the
paper itself tends to blur these distinctions); he needs td be
able to tell a stunt from a cause, a thought from a wheeze, a
fact from hearsay; he needs to be able to detect cant or

sincerity, exploration or evasion, in the very style of the words
used; particularly, for this is fundamental, . he needs to be
constantly alert to when he is being treated with respect or
with condescension. -
It may be, of course, that the average person would rather
give up reading the newspaper altogether than submit himself
to so disciplined a regime. Assuming a less drastic reaction,
however, it .seems incontestible that the regime ought to begin
early rather than- late. People make their first contact with
the theoretically adult newspaper long before they are them¬
selves adult : it- lies about the house, it absorbs many hours
per week of parental attention, it contains children's features;
and even the grown-up features are most often painfully intel¬
ligible, being written (according to the best prescription) for
people with the mental age of twelve years.
For these and other reasons, it is now generally accepted
.that the newspaper is an object for classroom appraisal, both
at school and in their adolescent and adult education. And
the kind of work one has in mind is not the formal lesson
or the set description, nor again is it the cautionary sermon;
it is rather through analytical discussion, analytical in both
the intellectual and the practical scissor-chopping senses, that
the distinctions and. contrasts and discriminations indicated
above can be brought out.
Of chalk and cheese
OF all kinds of classroom material,- the newspaper is the'
easiest to obtain and the most satisfying to destroy.- This
process of taking the paper apart can take various forms
which will. bring oufr the different aspects of the matter
earlier. To begin with, there is the question of what,
kind of thing a newspaper is, and here the most successful
method is to work with one newspaper, preferably 'the most
familiar.
It is best, if possible, to have a few copies of the. same issue;
the class can then break up into - smaller groups, each with
two copies (since the pages are printed on either side) and
with numerous scissors or paper-knives. The groups begin by
cutting the paper up into its individual items and classifying
them into separate piles; one pile of news stories, another of
pictures, a third of advertisements, and so on.
When they come to compare their bundles, the groups will
find, in all probability, marked differences; the number of
bundles per group and the items they included will vary, and
in attempting to justify their classifications, to explain why
one bundle contains all political matter, whatever its nature,
or why another bundle lumps together crossword puzzles and
cookery recipes something of the paper's diversity will
become apparent. Also the groups will .find themselves
reading out and analysing extracts, in order to decide then-
classification, which can be instructive as well as amusing;
(one recollects that reading out extracts from the newspaper
in a flat incredulous voice, was one of Will Rogers' most cele¬
brated comic turns).
Having dissected a single, newspaper in this fashion, the
groups go on to do the same with a number of different news¬
papers (for the same day, of course). Everyone knows, in a
general way, that one paper is to another like classroom chalk
to over-ripe cheese, but they may not have realised clearly
that this difference is as much one of purpose as of content.
The groups' bundles will now differ in size and number, one
paper giving more space to advertisments, and another more
to pictures etc., while a third may include features that are
not found in the others (such as an Astrology column or a
political cartoon.) They will differ in literary style, in quality
of paper, in size of type. And, most intriguing of all, their
treatment of the same raw material will vary enormously;
identical episodes will be found to have encouraged feats of
gargantuan imagination, and the lilies in one will be weeds
in another.
What interests the editor?
A later stage of this exercise, which can well include papers
of different nationalities as well, is for the groups to try
to arrange their bundles of contents into what would seem
to be this or that 'Editor's scale of priorities. Which parts of his
paper seem to interest the Editor the most, and which interest
him least ? When the groups come to discuss these Editorial
Contrasts (which they would do well to have summarized in
. some way) they will learn a good deal about their newspaper's
'view of its public, its sense of mission, its relations with
advertiser of party or some other .lobby, for they will have to
< decide why kinds and items ~of news are treated by . editors
as being of such variable importance and even why news as
such is seemingly so inconsistent a product.
In these ways, the chopping up of the daily paper proves a
stimulating and instructive occupation. By this means one
can learn empirically a great deal about the press as an insti¬
tution and about the technicalities of newspaper production and
make-up. The essential queries and cautions raise themselves,
and the groups soon discover the respects in which they can
UNESCO COURIER - N° 3 - 1954
trust their newspapers and rely on their Judgment. They will
develop, unconsciously, a selective attitude to what they read
and an ability to remember all the time that there may be
another version of this story, even that the truth may lie
elsewhere. They will have' become, or be on the way to becom¬
ing, interested and critical, rather than indolent and naive,
readers.
, Lest this kind of work should seem negative and merely des¬
tructive (though that would be the teacher's fault, and not the
fault of the method), it should be added that this work should
be accompanied by the class assembling its own wall-news¬
papers from its many piles and bundles. This will be a genuine
cross-section of the press, taking reports and features on the
same topic, contrasting similar kinds of story and this not in
a mood of superior cynicism but in order to put together a more
rounded version of the facts.
At the same time, the class may care to set its thoughts in
order by working out a blue-print of its own ideal newspaper
or journal (for just the same kind of work can be carried out
. DISSECTING THE NEWSPAPER in the classroom, in the practical scissor-
chopping sense,' is followed by' a classification of the cuttings and an analysis
of their content. "Comparison of story treatment in several papers teaches
children to be interested and critical, rather than indolent and naive readers.
Cuttings then form "copy" for class wall newspapers. ' Instead of "taking
the paper apart", the class can produce its own newspaper. Here, a group
of "editors" are hard at work preparing their next issue. (Photos copyright

on weeklies as well as dailies). What should it contain, and in
. what proportions ? To whom should it appeal, and how ? A
test of the earlier analytical work would be an ability to give
responsible answers to these constructive problems.
But here a word of warning is needed. Many schools produce
their own newspapers, setting up editorial offices and enrolling
reporters who rapidly become the curse of everyone's lives.
This kind of activity is valuable only so long as It does not
become a mere aping of the less attractive features of the
newspaper business. Much that goes into a paper had better
be left out ; in tone, appeal, language, and moral assumptions,
it is reprehensible or at least trifling. Juvenile reproductions
of such features as these are no part of an educational process,
and are simply an encouragement (yet one more) to vulgarity
and irresponsibility.
For the business of the world's news is a serious matter that
vitally affects the minds of meo. It is said that we get the
press as well as the government, that we deserve. Whatever may
be our deserts, however, we undoubtedly need the best today.

SPECIALISTS in sound techniques, composers and film makers from many parts
of the world will meet in Cannes, in April, for a series of discussions on
"Music and Film", in conjunction with the International Film Festival, in
a ''Music and Film" Exhibition prepared by Unesco, a special place will be devot¬
ed to new sound techniques in music and in particular to "Musique Concrète"
(concrete music) a new form of sound creation in which composition and experi¬
ments are taking place in a number of countries, particularly France, Germany,
the United States and Canada. The first experiments which were to lead to
concrete music were begun in 1948 by a young French scientist, Pierre Schaeffer,
who now directs a French group experimenting with this new music.
(AH photos by Kicrosser, Paris)
RAW MATERIAL: Every¬
thing that can be heard Is
potential material. A drop of
water makes a sound akin to a
musical note. A spinning plate
creates a sound " phrase ".
PRESTIDIGITATOR: This instrument makes it possible to modify the form of tape-recorded sound by
changing the speeds, thus raising or lowering the pitch of the original sound and greatly altering its tone
quality. Even more radical changes can be brought about by reversing the tape in the machine.
ELECTRONIC music, music created by lines
drawn on film, concrete music these are three
new and astonishing kinds of musical creation
which are being explored today. And their muse
should perhaps be re-named "Tapesichore", for all
of them, despite their different processes and me¬
thods, rely on a basic material film which brings
them on common ground with the cinema.
Concrete ntusic, for example, uses magnetic tape,
which is similar to the sound track of a film, for
recording and recomposing its sounds. Its bars are
traced by the scissors of the cutter who splices the
different sections of tape. The sound itself is modi-
fled by phonogenic apparatus which by running the
tape at greater or lesser speed, can raise or lower
the pitch of the original sound and greatly alter its ,
tone quality.
Thus the tonality of the music comes not from nor¬
mal musical scales but from the whole universe of
sound. The composer choses "concrete" sounds,
those already existing in everyday life. From these
raw materials an infinite variety of other sounds
can be created so that identities are changed a bell
can become an oboe, a squeaking door is transform¬
ed into the sound of a violin, boogie-woogie into
African tam-tam music.
Composers of electronic music work differently..
They compose their sounds in the abstract, since
before the invention of the loud-speaker, these

ment transmits concreta music

SPLICING MUSIC:' Like an instrument maker
seeking the right tone, the composer experiments
with his sound material on tape recordings.
A LIBRARY OF SOUND: The sounds of every¬
day life have been captured, modified in a variety
of ways and now await the composer's choice.
sounds did not exist in the atmosphere, but were
confined to electronic circuits. Unlike composers of
concrete music, they make no use of pre-recorded
sound. Instead the cunningly contrived components
of this music are produced behind the glass of elec¬
tronic tubes.
Then, there is the work of that interesting figure,
the artist musician who "draws" sound, and, throw¬
ing harmony to the winds, jots down sound in its
own frequency, rhythm and approximate tone on
the sound track of a film. The aim of men like
Norman MacLaren, of Canada, eliminating at one
stroke the conservatoire and all its instruments, is
to blaze a sound track right over the film image.
"What a wealth of methods we have here, all of
them astonishingly prolific. And what a remark¬
able achievement all their different resources have
been aimed at the direct handling of sound colour.
Here, sound ceases to be a fleeting thing; it is print¬
ed permanently on magnetic tape, and like move¬
ment itself, miraculously fixed on film. It can be
speeded up, slowed down, superimposed, contrasted,
or its rhythm made irregular.
How should we regard all these new forms of mu¬
sical exploration? The answer lies in a remark made
by Professor Günther Bialas of the Detmold Higher
School of Music, during a heated debate broadcast
by Munich radio. Faced by a group of musicians who
could see nothing in all these novelties but formless

noise, artistic decadence or even perversion of taste, he declared:
"Who nowadays denies the infinite artistic possibilities of the
cinema? Well, just as the film at the beginning, before it had
acquired its own personal form of expression, was hardly more
than filmed theatre, so electronic music, which was confined at
first to the reproduction of existing sound forms, is only now,
with the research work of Pierre Schaeffer, Pierre Henry and
Doctor Meyer-Eppler, beginning to create an entirely hew
musical material."
I should explain how I personally came across this possibility
of creating new musical material. In 1948, at the Experimental
Studio of the Radiodiffusion Française, I was carrying out re¬
search on noises. The idea of a "Symphony uf noise" haunted
me, but I could not then see how to achieve it, and .the word
"symphony" at that stage did not seem to make any sense at
all. For nothing is more realistic, more anecdotal and less
musical than noise. Noise, the blind man's radar, calls things
by their name. It is directly associated' with objects one sees.
Its emotional value lies in the effective associations it arouses:
evening bells, birds at dawn, sirens in a port.
A symphony composed of such noises would take us into the
theatre rather than the concert hall. And yet the gulf between
a dramatic repertory of this kind and a piano keyboard or an
orchestral score, attracted me. How could I bridge it? As
often happens, I hit upon the solution by accident. It was to
abandon the complete noises, which were simply too expressive,
and keep only fragments of them, and then to modify these'
fragments by all sorts of acoustic methods. A mass of sound
objects thus came into being, quite unrecognizable, as remote
. from precise dramatic meaning as from musical structure.
Composition in reverse -
THESE "sound combinations", isolated crystals of sound, that
could be transformed, repeated, superimposed, became the
complex "notes" of a generalized music. They also formed
a language of then: own, but instead" of an alphabet of twelve
recognizable sounds, there emerged- what seemed like a profu¬
sion of Chinese characters. It was no good trying to make any
sense of it in familiar musical terms, without immediately gene¬
ralizing our ideas of notes, structure and musical form.
Thus the steps of composition took an opposite form to that
of the usual notation, followed by execution. We began by sam- .
pling the sound material, and then composed, by a series of
attempts, in the same way as a painter or a sculptor, who can
only work single-mindedly through his intuitions ofmatter and
TRIO IN TAPES : A magnetic tape recorder with multiple
tracks enables three- tapes, to be run simultaneously, thus
creating a counterpoint in individual sound materials whose
combined effects can then be recorded. This might very well
be called the "organ" of concrete music.

mass, and cannot assess the result until he has laid on his
colour or his clay. That was when the name "concrete music"
came to my mind.
The absolute parallel between concrete music and the cinema',
can easily be seen. Of course, a film director has an idea to work
on and an exact method of cutting at his disposal. ~ Indeed, if.
. he has not thought in terms of pictures, both as regards his
inspiration and the landmarks, and if he has not seen his film
beforehand, no scenario, and no production will save him. The
fllm exists beforehand in his mind, as it does in the images fixed
by the camera. A fllm is. therefore the" very opposite of an
abstraction ; it creates an absolutely specific world that of a
concrete language which borrows all its words from the real
object, all its syntax from -the continuity, and all its architec¬
ture from the sequences as a whole. .
Although these ideas are more or less accepted . nowadays,
many enquiring and cultured minds are, nevertheless, discon¬
certed by the special technique of concrete music, and by the
word itself. Our pursuit of sound upsets them ; our huge
sound-filing system exasperates them ; composition based on
cutting, instead of on a score in G, leaves them quite bewildered.
Unlike musicians who are conservative and easily . shocked,
artists of a plastic, dramatic or visual tradition and tempera¬
ment are very amenable to concrete music and approach it with
lively interest and a natural instinct. Painters are delighted
to discover formal equivalences, stage designers to find a sound
atmosphere discreetly and effectively in harmony with their
sets. What might have been no more than a sort of realistic
din, is adjusted, its tone is heightened.
Film makers were first
AS for the cinema, it might well be said that this is the sort
of music it has been dreaming of for years. Film makers
did not wait for us before producing noises in the sound
track that conveyed more than any cello could do. In A man
walks in the city, to mention only one example, a "sound loop"
accompanies the last sequence unforgettably. By prolonged
repetition, a succession of street noises, suggestive enough in
itself, is made into a "sound phrase". This phrase never loses
touch with reality, yet is detached from it, like- the theme of
a symphony.
In this way Orson Welles, Bunuel and many others have for
years successfully sketched 'out their own natural concrete mu¬
sic. Max de Haas, in Holland, Enrico Fulchignoni for "Leo¬
nardo da Vinci", Allegret for. special effects, Grémillon for a
poetic montage on a theme of Astrology, Jean Rough in order
to reconstruct hundreds of feet of sound with the help of a few
African fragmentsthese were the first film-makers to join our
team in its early stages.
Now, a technique, tested for nearly five years, offers every
gradation from pure dramatic realism to abstract, plastic sound.
From now on, concrete music makes it possible to incorporate
into the image its sound accompaniment, drawn, so to speak,
as Eve was from Adam, out of its own substance.

progress since
^ the 'lady with
IB the lamp'
UNTIL 1854, when Florence Nightingale, lamp in hand,
passed among the dying in the terrible military hospitals
of the Crimea, it was universally assumed that the only
qualification needed for taking care of the sick was to be a
woman. Training schools for nurses were then non-existent.
But the "Lady with the Lamp" as first the suffering soldiers
in Scutari, and later, the whole world came to know her,
understood that for such work the loving heart was not enough.
The art of caring for the sick, the knowledge of the laws of
life and death, she said, were matters of "sufficient importance
and difficulty to require learning by experience and careful
inquiry, just as much as any other art".
Her courage, effort and selfless example were such that a
completely new conception of nursing and of nurses was born,
and by the time she died in 1910, the transformation had been
so great that in the United States alone there were already over
1,000 training schools for nurses.
The celebration of the Florence Nightingale Centenary in 1954
has inspired the choice of the theme "The Nurse, Pioneer of
Health" for . World Health Day on April 7 an annual
observance, marking the constitution of the World Health
Organization (WHO) as one of the United Nations Specialized
Agencies, in 1948. .
Thus, while paying tribute to the great pioneer of the nursing
profession the occasion will underline the importance of - the
nurse and of the practice of' nursing in its many forms in
helping the peoples of the world toward the goal of complete
health.
The need for nurses is immense. Hospitals, with their mul¬
tiple and varied services for both in- and out-patients, must
be staffed. Nurses are needed in the armed forces, In colonial
services, in penal institutions, in land, sea and air transport,
in homes for old people and for cripples, and in almost every
kind of institution. Moreover nurses must be widely available

NURSES OF TODAY: SIIJA IN THE
NORTHLAND ; KARMA ON THE NILE
to give home care, a need which is multiplied wherever there
is any widespread epidemic or endemic disease. And all -this
still represents only a fraction of the total numbers required.
Within the last 60 years' nurses have been increasingly
occupied with health protection. It was in the fight against
infant mortality that, the public health nurse scored her first
victories by going right into the home to instruct the mother
in the care of her baby and to persuade her to take it to the
doctor at the baby-clinic.
Wherever she is, the nurse prepares and completes the doc¬
tor's work. Both in her role as hospital nurse and outside the
hospital she must win the esteem and appreciation of the
people she works among. Her work is unending and her know¬
ledge has to be all-embracing. It is not enough for her to be
nurse she must also be housewife,- teacher and guide.
According to recent estimate there are some 1,250,000 nurses
in the world. But if there were enough to meet all needs there
would be nearly 6,000,000 of them. In the more fortunate areas
it is estimated that there is one professionally-trained nurse
to every three hundred of the population. But in some coun¬
tries the ratio is about one to one hundred thousand.
In many places there -is an acute shortage of qualified
teachers to train nurses. The WHO has attempted more and
more to assist governments to overcome this problem.
Among other activities, WHO has started to train local nursing
instructors in many places. WHO teams assigned to demons¬
tration and training centres in maternal. and child health and
in the control of tuberculosis and venereal diseases are helping
to train "on the job" local nursing personnel, for auxiliary
services with the centres. Of the 144 international nurses now
employed in WHO field programmes, 54 are working in schools
of nursing and 90 in field demonstration and training centres.
Ailing children and stubborn old men
JUST how important nursing work is in the life of a com¬
munity can perhaps best be explained by the story of the
daily work of two of the world's nurses Silja, in Lapland,
and Karima,. in Egypt.
Silja Laaksbnen is one of Finland's 852 public health nurses.
Aged 23, she was trained at Helsinki, worked in a hospital and
then went north to Lapland because she preferred the greater
freedom of public health work. Today she watches over the
health of a community of woodsmen and reindeer f armers
around Isokyla, 80 miles north of the Arctic Circle.
Because of the climate she dresses in ski clothes and often
travels by sled, but once she enters a home her work is much
the same as that of a nurse anywhere in the world giving
injections and medicines on the doctor's orders, checking the
health of schoolchildren, helping mothers to solve the problems
of feeding and caring for their babies,, pursuading stubborn old
men to follow the doctor's orders.
Her work is often arduous for in her part of Lapland there
are only three hours of daylight during the winter, and she has
to travel in sub-zero temperatures to visit her patients in the
tiny scattered villages. But she does not regret her choice.
In Finland nurses are well paid, well housed and their work is
recognized by the whole community. "
Karima Shaaban, the Egyptian nurse, is 21 years old. She
trained at .the Kasr El Aini Hospital in Cairo and was recently
assigned to the Tuberculosis Demonstration and Training Centre
in Bab-el-Sharia where a World Health Organization team is
demonstrating T. B. control methods.
She takes a different job each month, doing BCG vaccinations
one month, keeping records in the clinic another, travelling
with the mobile unit that circulates through the streets doing
X-rays another, covering the entire T.B. control programme.
Karima, however,- is a rarity even in modern Egypt, for until
recently women in many Mediterranean countries led sheltered
and segregated lives. But attitudes are changing and women
are becoming doctors, teachers, secretaries and nurses. Karima's
family is a good example of the new attitude toward the rights
and duties of women. Her father is a modest farmer in the Nile
Delta, but he allows his family to live in Cairo so that the
children can go to good secondary schools and receive pro¬
fessional training. Karima's two sisters are already school
teachers and her brother will also enter the profession.
Whether they are in Lapland or Cairo, or anywhere else in the
world, whether at the bedside, in the operating theatre, in the
clinic, the school ot the home, nurses of today, like Silja and
Karima, are the friends and counsellors of all, and teachers in
a world crusade toward better health.
By Sled and Station-Waggon
Silja's day starts early. She reaches remote patients by reindeer
sled. The farmer brings her "taxi" to the door. At other times she
may go on skis, by bus or on foot. A station-waggon takes Karima
through the narrow streets of Bab-el-Sharia to the homes of her
parents. Tuberculosis is prevalent in this populous part of Cairo.

A Bth Century Globe-
Trotting Businessman
by José de Benito
On September '8, 1298, in Dalmatian waters not far from the
island of Curzola, a large Venetian squadron was routed by .
warships of the Genoese navy. Fortune had turned her
back on the "Serenissima", and all but twelve of her ships
were captured or sunk. Among the prisoners, was a Vene¬
tian nobleman called "II Milione".
His rank was of little avail to him on this occasion ; in the
struggle waged between the merchant Republics for control of
the Mediterranean waters the great commercial highway to the
riches of the East prisoners were held so that they might
later be exchanged should fortune luck desert a one-time victori¬
ous force. So, after the battle of Curzola, our distinguished
pi isóner found himself confined to a Genoese dungeon, in the
enforced companionship of a learned man from Pisa, a prisoner
from an earlier encounter between the fleets of Pisa and Genoa.
During the endless hours of imprisonment, the two men
exchanged ideas and confidences ; and while Rustichello of Pisa
listened in rapt attention, "Milione", whose life had included
twenty-five years of travel in the unknown lands of the Great
Khan, told his fellow prisoner about those exotic places, so often
on the lips of Italian merchants and seamen, but. about which
hardly any reliable information was to be had.
After hearing his companion's story, Rustichello, whose pen
flowed easily, and who was a good speaker and writer of French,
wrote a book in that language, entitled "The Book of Ser Marco
Polo, the Venetian, concerning the jkingdoms and marvels of the
East".
And so appeared the Book of Marco Polo, for that was Milione's
real name. This year the world will celebrate the seventh cente¬
nary of his birth a well-deserved honour, for that story,
written, like "Don Quixote", in a prison, started such a' wave of
curiosity that in a very short time copies and translations of
Rustichello's manuscript appeared in French, Italian, Venetian,
Catalan, Castilian, Irish and German.
It was thanks to the trustworthy and detailed accounts of Marco
Polo's travels that the cartographers of Charles V of France were
able to trace the map of Asia into their famous '"Catalan Atlas",
embodying in it a great deal of new information. But in addition
and this is of supreme importance in the history of civi¬
lization the news about the wealth of Asia and its trade in
spices was certainly a most powerful factor in inciting the Portu¬
guese to launch their great voyages of discovery, and in
encouraging Christopher Colombus to plan and carry out the

great adventure which was to lead to the opening up of a new
continent...
Thus, as Marco Polo's words flowed on between the four bare
walls of that Genoese prison, a new historical era was born. The
centre of world interest began to shift from the Mediterranean,
sailed by Greek and Phoenician vessels centuries before Christ,
to the Ocean, that "dark sea" of the ancients, which has now
become a bridge between the old peoples of Europe and the new
nations of the Americas.
. But who was Marco Polo? Born in Venice in 1254, he was the
son of Nicolo Polo, who, with his elder brother Marco and his
other brother Matteo, ran an important business at Constanti¬
nople with a branch at Soldaja (Crimea), from which they traded '
with the East. Marco Polo was barely seven when his father and
his uncle Matteo decided to make a business trip into the heart
of Asia. They set out from Soldaja in 1261," and their journey
lasted 8 years. In 1269, they returned bearing gifts from the
great Kublai Khan to the Sovereign Pontiff of Christianity, and a
request that the latter should send to China several masters of
the liberal arts who could also bring the religion of Christ to
Kublai's subjects. The Holy See was vacant at the time, owing
to the death of Clement IV, and it was not to be filled for three
years.
Marco, who was by now nearly fifteen, was thrilled by the
stories told by his father and his uncle Matteo and begged'to be
allowed to accompany them on their second journey to the East.
The brothers agreed, but as they were unwilling to set off again
for China without meeting: the Great Khatfs requests, they spent
two years in Venice, waiting for the election of a Pope and
making careful preparations for the new expedition.
In 1271, Teobaldo Visconti da Piacenza was at St. John Lateran
on a visit to the Holy Sites;
and at this juncture the Con¬
clave, as a way out of its dif¬
ficulties, elected him Pope.
This choice of one who,,
though of noble Italian ori¬
gin, was hut a simple Arch¬
deacon from Liège, came as
a shock to the whole of
Christendom. But while ma¬
ny dignitaries were still
plunged in stupor, the active
Polo brothers good business
men and well aware of the
value of time made their
way to St. John Lateran and
obtained from the new Pope
(Gregory X, later called by
the people "Gregory the
Blessed"), letters and presents
for Kublai Khan, who was a
descendant of Ghengiz Khan.
The Pope went so far as to
appoint two priests to accom-
' pany them; the priests, how¬
ever, were dismayed by the
possible perils of the venture
and judged it more prudent
to remain behind.
Everything was now in order; and in 1271 Marco, Nicolo and
Matteo Polo set out from the port of Lajazzo on the Eastern
Mediterranean. They were not to return until 25 years later
in 1296. Ramusio, one of Marco Polo's biographers, tells us that
on their return to Venice, where nobody remembered them after
such a long absence, the Polos gave a great banquet in their old
family mansion.. As soon as the guests were assembled in the
reception rooms, the travellers made their appearance to the
amazement of all present dressed in Tartar fashion, in clumsy
tunics of rough cloth. Shortly afterwards they retired, to reap- ,
pear in sumptuous silk tunics and dalmatics embroidered with
gold ; and before the sensation created had passed, they went
out once more and changed into yet far richer raiment.
To increase the effect of prosperity, the servants now wore
the luxurious garments which the travellers had cast off. Amidst
general expectation of yet more marvels, the three Polos tore
up the ragged clothes they had first worn, and took from them
the jewels and precious stones which they had sewn inside them
in order not to arouse the greed of people encountered on their
journey home..
After this resounding return the Polos were received every-,
where in Venetian society. They settled down in their house,
which people began to call the "Milione house" a double allu¬
sion to the "millions" owned by its proprietors and to Marco's
'second name, Emilio, the diminutive of which was "Emilione".
Marco himself entered Venetian political life, married, and was
elected a Member of the Grand Council.
As already mentioned, he was taken prisoner during the battle
of Curzola, and spent a considerable time in exile and enforced

rest a compensation, perhaps, for his 25 years of constant
activity. He died at an advanced age, in his own country.
Marco Polo's was by far the most extensive trip ever made up
to that time. Many would hesitate, even ¿day, before under¬
taking such a journey. Harsh climates, the risk of illness, and
the dangers of the road across huge and lonely steppes (including
the possibility of encounters with bands of desert robbers) would
make it, even now, an adventurous trip.
The tremendous effect which the story of these travels must
have produced on'the minds of contemporary readers, and indeed
on people living in the XlVth and XVth centuries can be ima¬
gined. _ . ;
Yet Marco Polo, with a modesty rare in adventurers, hardly puts
himself into the picture at all; his is a strictly objective and
realistic account of the countries he visited, or of those about
which, without having been there himself, - he had reliable
sources of information. The absence of the fictitious element
lack of fantasy invests his story with unique power and
authenticity, and makes it a monument of geographical and
commercial information.
In a time like his, when there was much commercial movement
and competition to open new routes for Venetian, Genoese,
Pisan, Catalan and Florentine trade his story was to pave the
way for every sort of project and ambition, to foster every
dream of adventure in mediaeval man.
The Belgian historian, J. Pirenne, summing up Marco Polo's
description of the Chinese economy, says: "In Northern China,
coal deposits (as yet unknown to the rest of the world) had
been discovered; Hang-Chow, the largest city of the universe
and China's most flourishing port, was "the anchorage for power¬
ful fleets, equipped by the Empire, which sailed as far as the In-
. dian Archipelago. In the com¬
mercial cities, business men
rich as kings were grouped
into corporations. Peking was
the centre of the silk trade in
the North; Chung-Tu was the
concentration point for all the
export trade to Central Asia;
Nanking and Su-Chow ma¬
nufactured cloth of gold;
Yang Chow was the rice mar¬
ket; Hang-Chow was the su¬
gar market and simultaneous¬
ly the most important centre
of international commerce;
Fu-Chow and Chin-Chew con¬
trolled the traffic in spices
and pearl's, as well as the im¬
ports from India. Navigation
was so intense that for
every one ship loaded with
pepper which sailed from In¬
dia to Alexandria, at least one
hundred anchored at Chin-
Chew.
This was the Mongol em¬
peror's time of greatest
splendour. The shades of
Ghengiz Khan, the conqueror
of Asia who had been so great a threat to Europe, still hung over
the Eastern world, with memories of the terrible massacres that
his hordes had perpetrated among the Chinese peoples accustomed
to the enlightened authority of the Sing dynasty. And Kublai
Khan had made good use of that terror so as to impose order in
all his vast dominions. How'else could the Polos have wandered
for 25 years over the remotest of areas without mishap?
Successive chapters of the Book of Marco Polo describe
Turkestan, Lesser and Greater Armenia (from Anatolia to the
Caucasus); the kingdoms of Mosul, Baghdad, Tauris and the
Khanate of Persia up to Ormuz; Mongolia, China, India and
Siberia; the seven thousand islands of Japan;' South East Asia, '
including Coehinchina and Annam; the islands of Java and
Sumatra (or Little Java), the Malay Peninsula and Ceylon;
Arabia, Abyssinia, the East African coast, and Madagascar; and
finally, Trebizond and Constantinople.
The opportunity of visiting many of these countries came to
Marco Polo when, as he was taking his leave to return to Venice,
Kublai Khan requested him to accompany a princess belonging
to his family and the Court, who was going to marry Argnun
Khan in Persia and whose cumbersome baggage forced her to
travel by sea.
Today, Italy is preparing to celebrate the seventh centenary
of the birth of this great traveller and narrator; and the world
will echo Italy's homage. Unesco is to share in the honouring of
a man who did much to encourage scientific investigation and
the love of travel, by publishing new translations, in English and
French, of "The Book of Ser Marco Polo, the Venetian, concerning
the kingdoms and marvels of the East".

Youth volunteers
at work in the
land of the Berbers
by Pierre Martin
When a small group of international volunteers, set out
for a Berber village in the mountains of Kabylia some time
ago, their principal - awn, was to lend a hand with the
construction of a badly needed pipe-line to bring water to a
new school. But the problems of illiteracy, health and
hygiene they found there soon caused them to organize a
fundamental education campaign for the benefit of the
villagers. The experience of these volunteers from the
Service Civil International organization is typical of many
other work camp volunteers, more than 5,000 of whom
have come from far-off lands'to work in some 300 camps
set up by the work camp movement which is sponsored by
Unesco. Swinging picks and shovels, building, repairing and
nursing, these young men and women have brought help
and hope to people with whom and for whom they were
working in economically under-developed areas in all parts
of the world. Teams have tackled many kinds of jobs
including agriculture, forestry, public health, literacy, home
crafts, .recreation and social welfare. Here, M. Pierre
Martin, a French teacher, describes the experiences of the
group which went to a Kabyle village in the mountains of
Algeria. M. Martin is one of the pioneering volunteers of
the Service Civil International organization in North
Africaj He is the author of En Kabylie, dans les tranchées
de la paix, a book about the first international work camp
to be organized in Algeria.
WE made our camp in a mag¬
nificent natural amphitheatre
in the mountains, a tremendous
escarpment, rising almost vertically to
a height of 3,000 feet, dwarfing the
three tents which were to be our
"home" for the next few months.
There were twelve of us, nine young
and three girls, and some had
come from places as far away as New
York and Norway to this isolated but
strikingly beautiful spot in the Kabyle
mountains of Algeria.
There was Stephen, a Swiss teacher;
Milo, an electrician from the South of
France; Joe, a psychology student from
New York; Oddvar, a Norwegian
farmer; Adber, a Kabyle who had just -
finished studying in Algiers; Ali, a
young Arab mason; Philippe, a
Moroccan student of architecture; Jean,
a mechanic from France; and myself,
an ethnographer from Paris. We all
lived in the largest tent.
In the second tent, the girlsMady,
an English chemist, Claartje, a teacher
of physical education from the Nether¬
lands, and Sylvette, a Parisian typist _
had spread out their sleeping-bags
among the rucksacks and cooking
utensils. The third tent contained our
tools and food and, since the night
when the . jackals had grown bold
enough to- come and devour our
provisions, one of us had always slept
in that tent. That was the camp.
To reach it from the plains below
was a minor Odyssey, and even those
of us who had ' come the longest
distances to Algeria agreed that the
last few miles seemed longer than aU
the rest of the journey put together.
I shall always remember my five-hour
climb up to the camp after fetching
supplies, as we did twice a week, from
the village of the Wadhias, with my "
rucksack weighing thirty or forty
pounds, filled with food, medical
supplies, letters and hardware.
On the first part of the path there
was not a scrap of shade anywhere;
then, at a height of about fifteen
hundred feet, the path ran into the
mountain-side through a cleft, offering
the first oasis of shade in which to take
a rest.
The path continued through a scene
of tremendous grandeur, following a
sort of gigantic stairway half way up
the defile. By steps or steep slopes, I
would go on climbing for hours until,
at a turning point, I would catch sight
of the camp tents hi a meadow down
below.
When we first arrived we seemed to
be far from any sort of habitation.
But when our eyes had become ac¬
customed to the . surrounding country¬
side, we could make out three villages
in the vicinity of our camp. Their drab
colour merging with the nearby rocks,
they seemed to be cowering on the
slopes as if trying to hide themselves.
Image of Bethlehem
ACLOSER inspection revealed that
each of the village huts consisted
of a single, windowless room in
which grown-ups, animals and children
were crowded together. Yet these Ka¬
byle huts were surprisingly clean and
the presence of the domestic animals
in the most exact sense of the term
brought to mind an image of the
stable in Bethlehem. There were no
chimneys. Cooking was done over a
wood fire in one corner of the room
and the smoke escaped through the
door.
The Kabyles of the Kuriets are
Berbers who, though they live less
than a hundred miles from Algiers, a
completely Europeanized town, have
remained quite untouched by Western
civilization.
A mountain people, poor, but proud,
they live by stock-rearing and small-
scale farming. Their village life is
quiet and law-abiding, but they are not
above an occasional act of brigandage
when they follow their flocks up to
the high pastures at an altitude of over
six thousand feet, far removed from the
constraints of the law.
The day after we arrived we made a
. start on the job we had come to do.
Until now there had been no school
anywhere in the district of the Kuriets,
and the French Administration, in
agreement with the village chiefs, had
decided to build one at Tinessouine, the
centre of an area 'where there are
about ten thousand people living. . As
there was no source of drinking water
available at the school site it was
necessary to canalize the waters of a
spring and pipe them over a distance
of some seven thousand, eight hundred
feet through the rocks and meadows.
This was to be our concern.
In such cases, the Administration
requires the people of the district to
contribute about twenty per cent of the
cost of the' work; when (as is almost
always the case) the community is
poor, the contribution is paid in
communal labour. As the Amin (spi¬
ritual and civil head) of Tinessouine
had too few men to carry out the work
in the specified time, he had asked for
help from our Service Civil Interna¬
tional team.
To the Amin, the idea that people
should come in this way from different
countries to do voluntary work simply
as a gesture of international solidarity
was perfectly acceptable, but the same
could not be said of the other people

of the district. Their ' imaginative
minds invented all sorts of explana¬
tions: we were deported prisoners, or
the scheme was a Machiavellan plot on
the part of the Administration to plant
spies in their villages, or... Every day
brought a new story.
But the trench was already spreading
in a long dark groove along the slope
of the Jurjura and, working side by
side, making- the same efforts and
sharing the same satisfaction when the
rock broke under the sledgehammer
blows, the men of the villages began to
lose the mistrust they had shown at
the outset. A feeling of comradeship
born of a common effort took its place.
Th& children, too, became friendly
and were always close at hand when
our girls went about their domestic
tasks. Soon they were eagerly taking
part in the simple educational leisure-
time occupations which were organized
for them. Sylvette showed the girls
how to mend their dresses while
Claartje taught them to count with the
help of a set of dominos, made on the
spot by burning marks on little blocks
of wood. Mady would be called upon
to look after those who had hurt
themselves or to give some treatment
to the rare cases of sickness in this
healthy region. People would even
bring their babies to her without fear
that her infidel eye might cast a spell
over them.
The trench grew steadily longer and
the people, seeing what we had done,
and now reassured that our presence
did not interfere with their customs,
began to show more trust.
One evening, when we got back from
work, we came upon an unexpected
scene; Sylvette had organized a real
class; about twenty children were
sitting in front of her under an ash
tree and reading out in chorus the
name of their village which she had
written on a big sheet of paper. They
were enormously proud ; -time and
time again they read us the word.
Their fathers, who were bringing the
tools back to the camp, watched these
children's games with superior smiles
and went off without saying anything.
But the next evening, three of them
came to ask us to teach them to write
their names. "'Why do you want to
write your name?" One of them
explained: "To sign at the post-office;
when there is money to be collected or
a registered letter, we have to take
along two witnesses, but if I can sign
my name, I shall not need to pay the

The team came to help lay a village water supply pipe-line, but soon found itself spontaneously car¬
rying out a programme of fundamental education for the villagers.
witnesses." "And do you often get
letters like- that?" "Sometimes, from
my son in France."
When we considered the educational
value of these activities we realized
that the so-called "side lines" of the
work camp had imperceptibly become
our main interest. We went steadily
on with our digging; but in the
evening, instead of resting under the
mosquito net, we were all caught up in
the fever of fundamental education.
Some of us helped Mady with her sick
nursing; others seconded Sylvette or
Claartje in the evening writing class
theoretically for adults; Milo and Jean
tried out on the brook a new sluice
arrangement for irrigation.
Work camp 'side lines'
THEN, suddenly, we began to have
some doubts about the usefulness
of what we were doing. Not about
our main job, for that was straight¬
forward. Once it was finished, the
pipe would bring drinking water td a
fountain for the use of both men and
animals, and, later, for the school.
Our doubts were about the "side
lines" of the Work camp. After we had
left the area would the men remember
the rudiments of writing we had taught
them? And of what use would it be
to the women to have learnt to mend,
once we were no longer there to give
them needles and thread, should their
menfolk be, unwilling tö buy these?
It was Mady who cleared these doubts
from our minds by reminding us that
the rudiments of fundamental educa¬
tion had tremendously increased the
effectiveness of our work with pick and
shovel, and that all elements of basic
education must go together. '"It is. a
good thing to bring drinking water
within people's reach, but it's even
better to teach them at the same time
what soap is for. Water should mean
more to them than just something to
drink; they should also learn that
babies ought to be washed, and that a
wound is more likely to heal if it is
washed in clean water instead of being
smeared with dung", she said.
¿Srefc:
sr '
AI-
A new thirst aroused
FINALLY, the great day arrived
when the first gush of water came
from the new fountain. Our ori¬
ginal task was accomplished. But as
we packed our kit and said goodbye to
the villagers we reflected that although
water was now flowing in abundance at
Tinessouine, there was another thirst
to be slaked, the thirst for knowledge
that we had aroused in the people.
The children's education is assured
by the new school that has been built.
But the problem of bringing literacy
and fundamental education to the
adults still remains. It is of little use
expecting even literate young people to
accomplish much in villages where the
authority of an older and completely
illiterate generation exists.
If, each time we broke up a work
camp, we knew that we had been
acting as precursors, gaining the con¬
fidence of the people and preparing
the ground for educators to complete
the task, we should take our leave of
them with much easier minds.

<![CDATA[
in which a father tells his 13-year-old
American daughter about Unesco
Herbert J. Abraham
The average man in the street would be hard put to give a reply if he were
asked "What is Unesco and what is it trying to do?" The same question
would probably draw a complete blank from most children throughout the
world. The fact is that school lessons on the JJnited Nations and its specialized
agencies like Unesco are still few and far between. Here, an American father,
'Mr. Herbert Abraham, has taken the bull by the horns and set forth his personal
reply to his small daughter, Jennifer, in the form of a letter. To help Jennifer
understand Unesco's work and objectives better, her father has naturally linked
them directly with examples in American history she has studied in school. We
present this interesting effort with the knowledge that parents in other countries
who may wish to follow Mr. Abraham's example, will have little difficulty in finding
other examples, just as striking and as numerous in their own country's history.
"A Letter to Jennifer" was originally published in the National Education Asso¬
ciation Journal United States.
You asked -once, what is Unesco ?
I said it was part of the United
Nations. I said that the UN means
that countries get together and help
each other. They help each other if
one of them is attacked by. an enemy,
and they help one another to settle
quarrels sensibly and fairly, and they
help one another to look after hungry
"children and to get better doctors and
to farm their lands better and to get
better schools. Unesco is the part of the
United Nations in which countries espe¬
cially help one another to get better
schools.
I didn't tell you much more about
Unesco then, because I didn't know how
to explain it so that you would under¬
stand it. -
Of course, you know one or two things
more about Unesco now than when you
asked the question, because we have
since lived in Paris. You know that I
worked for Unesco in the old building
on Avenue Kleber and that quite a lot
of people from different countries' work¬
ed there, like our friend from Iraq
with his wife from Lebanon, and the
young man from Holland, and the
Frenchman who thought American
schools were wonderful because children
can have real discussions with their
teachers.
Now, here you are back in the United
States, and you have been learning
eighth-grade American history. Here is
something that may surprise you. You
have been learning some things about
Unesco. and all the rest of the United
Nations while you have been learning
the story of America.
It's true that your history book
doesn't mention Unesco, and you may
Dr. Abraham is a member of the Unesco Ilela-
tions Staff o¡ the US National Commission [or
Unesco, US State Department.
23
" wonder what I mean when I say. you've
been learning about Unesco in the
process of learning American history.
I'U try to explain what I mean.
There is a map of the world in your
American history book; around the map
are some pictures. One picture shows
the Parliament in England with a title
"representative government." There is
a picture of a page of a dictionary, with
a label "language." There are other
pictures marked "reform," "health,"
"people," "art," "religion," "literature"
(that's a picture of Shakespeare) , "archi¬
tecture" (a Greek' temple), "music,"
"science," and "domesticated animals."
The map shows arrows pointing to
America, and the whole page is entitled
"Civilization Spreads to America."
Later there's another map with arrows
going from America, and pictures mark¬
ed : "Declaration of Independence,"
"agricultural methods," "medical seien- ,
ce," "new plants," "'sports," "engineer¬
ing,1" "inventions," "music," "motion pic¬
tures," and "literature" (a page of Tom
Sawyer). The title of this map is:
"Americans Contribute Their Civilization
to the World." Get the idea?
Two-way culture
NOW put the two - ideas together.
Where do we get a lot of the good
things in our civilization? Where
do other countries get many of the good
things in their civilization? OK, so what
about Unesco?
Just a minute. I'd like to change a
word. The book says, "Civilization
spreads to America and Americans
contribute their civilization to , the
world." I would like to substitute the
word "culture" for the word "civiliza¬
tion." - The two words have almost the
same meaning, and culture has an
advantage: you can't make an adjective
out of civilization (except civilized) and
you can make an adjective from culture.
I want to write a sentence with the
word "cultural." Here it is: "Cultural
exchange has been good for America
and for all other countries." That is
an idea you have learned just by learn¬
ing the true story of America.
Well, that American-history idea is
also a Unesco idea. All the countries in
Unesco more than 60 countries have
the same idea, "Let's help one another
learn about one another and from one
another; let's have more cultural ex¬
change." So they put the "cultural" right
into the name of Unesco.
(Of course, Unesco is a made-up word.
It is made up of the initials in the words
in Unesco's real name "United Nations
Educational, Scientific and Cultural Or¬
ganization")
It's interesting how the countries help
one another to have more "cultural in¬
terchange." They help artists, musicians,
and writers from different countries to
get together and exchange ideas. They
give scholarships so that people can go
to other countries to study. They make
catalogues of reproductions of famous
paintings that people can buy.
That gives you an idea of what
Unesco does to help "cultural exchange."
There is a lot more you, could learn
about it, but you have learned the main
idea already from American history.
Another American-history fact I no-
. ticed in your book was that people from
many different countries learned to
know each other and. to live peaceably
together in the United States. For
example, there is a page of pictures of
men with many different national origins
who fought bravely side by side in the
American army in the last world war..
You know that people came to America
. from all over Europe and somehow
learned to get along with one another.
They discovered they didn't have to hate
and fight one another.
This is Unesco's idea, too. The coun¬
tries in Unesco are saying, "Let's help
our people get to know each other better,
and also let us learn how to live peace¬
fully all over the world."
Unesco is tied in with the story of
American economic development, too.
Do you remember this sentence, "Power-
driven machines begin an industrial
revolution"? H|ere are some more words
and phrases that mean quite a lot to
you, now that you have studied American

history. They are all in the American-
history book: interchangeable parts;
mass . production; transportation and
communication link the oceans; science
and machinery multiply the production
of food; machines make the peoples of
the world more dependent upon each
other...
You understand now that the world
today is different in many ways from
what is was when the American colonies
got their freedom. You have learned-
that the world has shrunk, tho' it is stiU
the same old 25,000 miles around.
Today it is like one big community where
we all depend on one another.
Knowing this, you can understand
quite a number of things Unesco is doing.
For one thing you can see that we shall
be in a mess unless a lot of people in
many countries learn about the great
. technical and economic changes that
have taken place. People can't act very
sensibly to solve problems together if
they don't understand what kind of
world they live in.
And this poses quite a question for
teachers all over the world: Are. they
really helping their pupils learn what
kind of world we live in, and how it got
that way?
Chopsticks for the teacher
TO help teachers do a better job,
Unesco organizes meetings for
them summer schools where
they can trade ideas. Do you remember
the Hindu gentleman who came to see
us in Paris? When our maid went in
the garden , and cut somes sticks, you
asked her why, and she said, "I'm
making chopsticks for the Indian
gentleman." He was a teacher who was
attending one of the Unesco summer
schools, along with teachers from
Mexico, USA, England, Belgium, Japan,
and other countries. Incidentally, letting
people talk things over freely and trade
ideas is quite an old idea forAmericans^-
look up what your textbook says about
the Bill of Rights and how "democracy
is government by discussion."
Another thing about Unesco and the
industrial revolution remember that
scientists were behind all those inven-,
tions, how agricultural scientists found
out how to grow more crops.
"Help the scientists learn from each
other," says Unesco, "and help every¬
one «Ise learn from the scientists."
Unesco helps the scientists organize
international meetings and publish ma¬
gazines in which they let other scientists
know the new things they have learned
or what problems they are working
on.
The more the scientists know, the
more puzzling questions they find they
don't know the answers to, about the
infinitely big universe and the inflnitesi-
mally small atom and everything in bet¬
ween. Even tho' America has a lot of
the best scientists, places for research,
and equipment, we still want to learn
from scientists in other countries.
Of course, the people in very poor-
countries are especially eager to learn
more science, so Unesco helps them to
learn it. There is a piece in your history
book that explains this: how Japan was
"backward" and saw the manufactured
articles which Perry brought, and decid¬
ed it must learn western science and
technology.
"" All those countries that have become
free and independent in recent years,
like India, Pakistan, and Indonesia
they want to learn science, and that
means training thousands of scientists,
and getting' equipment and' so on.
Unesco helps them by sending out
experts to train them and advise them.
This kind of help is called "technical
assistance."
-One important problem (it's really
hundreds of scientific problems, I
suppose) is whether people can possibly
turn dry, barren, lands into good fertile
lands. Millions of people around the
world live in dry lands. American his¬
tory tells us that scientists were able
to help our farmers by finding out what
the soil consists of, and what crops
grow better in some soils, and how to
use water resources more effectively.
Unesco is putting that idea to work for
the "arid zone," by helping scientists do
the research and keep in touch with
each other.
I have told you about the "cultural"
and "scientific" parts of Unesco's work.
Next comes the "educational." But it's
fairly obvious, isn't it, now that you
know some American history?
What did the Americans do when they
first started settling the lands in the
Northwest Territory? They set aside
one- section in L every township for
schools. What was the big thing Horace
Mann did? Introduce good ways for
training teachers. What do Americans
UNESCO COURIER - N» 3 - 1954
think every child should have? Equality'
of educational opportunity. America
has tried to give every child the chance
to get all the education he can profit
from.
Today, all over the world countries
are saying, "We, too, must educate all
our people." What a job! Half the people
in the world can't read or write. In
some countries, 70 % or 80 % never get
into a school. But these people in lands
that have been "underdeveloped" so
long are now saying, "We can never be
really free and able ,to rule ourselves or
get rid of starvation and pestilence,
unless all our people go to school." The
countries in Unesco believe they should
help one another to learn.
Models for the world
UNESCO doesn't build schools, tho';
it doesn't have the money. Besides,
- each country is responsible for its
own education and must do most of
the work itself. But Unesco does send
experts to various countries to help train
their teachers, and advises them how to
set up good public-school systems.
It helps to set up "model" training
centres. There's one in Mexico and one
in Egypt. Experienced teachers come
from many countries, learn how to train
others, and then set up teacher-educat¬
ing centres in their own country. Many
of the young teachers have had no more
schooling than you have, because their
countries haven't been able to afford
higher education for them, and teachers
have been needed so desperately.
Another big thing in education is
libraries. Your history book tells you
how Andrew Carnegie became a mil¬
lionaire and then used a lot of his
money to build public libraries where
everyone can borrow books.
When I was a boy in England, we
had a library near us called the Andrew
Carnegie Public Library, and I learned
that a wealthy American had made this
library possible for us.
Well, all the countries that are
building schools need libraries too.
Unesco is acting a little bit like Andrew
Carnegie, tho' it isn't a millionaire. For
example, it is helping India set up a
"model" library.
I HOPE you have a good idea now whv
we have Unesco and what it does. If
we were having a class discussion,
you could ask questions and I would try
to answer them. I can think of one or
two questions you might ask.
For example, is Unesco a kind of
government? No Unesco is an organi¬
zation which countries belong to and
pay dues to, and it does what its
member countries want it to do.
You might ask, what do we pay?
That is decided each year. This year
the budget was about nine million
dollars, and the dues of the USA were
about one third of that (because we are
so much the wealthiest country). That
means USA pays something like three
million dollars a year which costs
each taxpayer less than the price of
one candy bar.
I should remind you that Unesco is
just one part of the UN. Other parts
are doing the things I mentioned in the
beginning, and all the parts help each
other. I suppose all the work of all
parts of the UN costs me less than a
dollar a year. That's what I pay in
order to be one of the millions of people
all over the world who want to help
keep peace and make the world a better
place.

LETTERS TO THE EDITOR
Sir,
.../ wish to congratulate you
on your extremely good issue of
The Courier on languages, the
contents of which are of a con¬
cise and constructive vein... I
note that no mention is made
of the Bilingualism movement in
the article suggesting possible
solutions for facilitating under¬
standing between peoples. But
perhaps you intend to treat this
subject fully at a later date...
Jean-Marie Bressand
Le Monde Bilingue,
Paris, France.
Sir,
I have read with great inter¬
est your issue on languages and
particularly liked your article
on old languages finding new
jobs... Don't you think it is
Unesco's job (international un¬
derstanding) to oppose or -at
least to discourage the mush¬
room growth of languages and
alphabets which are no longer
deemed useful? It is scandalous,
for example, that there is no
protest when one of the great
world languages is replaced by
an archaic dialect known only
to a few scholars or when a new
alphabet is suddenly created.
The "graphic" heritage of man¬
kind is rich enough today, so
why increase it?...
I am surprised to find only a
brief timid mention of interna¬
tional languages in your issue.
You seem to have felt obliged
to mention Esperanto "which
has the advantage of an un¬
doubted head start over its
rivals". What do you mean?
That it is older? Volapuk was
well known when Esperanto
was born. A bigger following?
No, since Volapuk again was
once spoken by two million
people, a figure higher than
that achieved by any interna¬
tional language since. But
what are the "rival" languages
whose names you so discreetly
omit? Apart from Esperanto
which is split into two rival
groups there are only two with
a comparable following: 1) Ido,
an improved form of Esperan¬
to», which has constantly de¬
clined since the first World
War; 2) Interlingue, whose or¬
ganization was destroyed in the
last war but which has been _
reorganized since and is now
making great strides. This has
been achieved despite a press
campaign of silence which I
note with regret you also fol¬
low... That Interlingue is simpler
and more scientific than Espe¬
ranto and Ido is undeniable...
O. Jacob
Union Pédagogie Interlinguiste,
Pavillon, France.
Sir,
I was very interested in the
January number of The Courier
(No. 1, 1954), which is devoted
to the language problem in in¬
ternational relations...
I note, however, that the so¬
lution presented by the inter¬
national language, Esperanto,
is barely touched on On the
2nd of August, 1950, a petition
in favour of Esperanto was
presented to the United Nations.
The petition was signed by
895,432 individuals and 492 or¬
ganizations with a total mem¬
bership of 15,454,780. Among
those who signed it were the
President of a republic, several
ministers of State, more than .
400 members of parliaments,
more than 1,500 philologists and
professors of languages, ap¬
proximately 2,000 scientists and
university professors, 40,000
teachers, etc. The petition was
then handed over to Unesco as
the competent body on this
question. The General Confer¬
ence of Unesco which took place
in Paris towards the end of
1952, decided unanimously to
commission the Director-Gener¬
al to communicate the petition
to member states and "to under¬
take... the necessary prepa¬
ratory work to enable the Gen¬
eral Conference to decide, at
its Eighth Session, upon the
action to be taken on this pe¬
tition". Our age, which is one of
highly developed technology,
tends to put its faith in the
ability of machines even of
translating machines rather
than in the power of the human
spirit. May I therefore, in this
sphere at least, put the spirit
before the machine.
Prof. I. Lapenna
Hon. Director,
Centro de Esploroj
Kaj Dokumentado,
London.
Sir,
I read The Courier and am
very interested in the work of
Unesco. But I am very sorry
you have to write in English,
French and Spanish. This must
mean a great waste of time and
effort. I think it would be a
big advantage for you to use
one international planned lan¬
guage instead or three national
ones. Such a language already
exists: Ido.
Hans Brismark
Hoting- Sweden.
Sir,
In your issue of 'November
1953 devoted to Human Rights
you published an article entitled
"They Challenged Slavery to
Free Men in Chains" in which
you say at one point "slavery
is everywhere abolished". I do
not agree, for here in the
Cameroons at least slavery is far
from abolished.' It is not un¬
common to find African women
being sold and bought.
The publication of your ar¬
ticle coincides with a report sent
to the Anti-Slavery Society in
Paris by H.E. Monseigneur Le-
febvre, Archbishop of Dakar
and Papal Delegate. Mgr.\Le-
febvre considers that slavery
undoubtedly exists in Africa...
everywhere that polygamy is
practised. In addition the Arch¬
bishop denounces the custom
of the "dowry" as another
offshoot of slavery since the
dowry has lost its symbolic sig¬
nificance and has become sim¬
ply the purchase of a human
being. In the Cameroons, the
cupidity of parents sometimes
leads them to demand an Ame¬
rican truck in exchange for a
young girl. The sum of money
asked for usually exceeds 100,000
francs (over £ 100 or $ 280). In
courts of common law and other
tribunals the most frequent
. cases are disputes about women
to settle the following question':
"To whom does this woman be¬
long ?". If a woman does in¬
deed have an owner it must be
admitted that a certain form of
slavery does exist.
According to a Cameroons
custom a woman is, in fact, nev¬
er her own mistress. If her
husband dies she becomes the
property of her husband's heir
who marries her automatically.
There are, it is true, certain de¬
crees.., which seek to put an end
to abuses regarding widows and
to ensure self-determination for
young girls. In practice these
decrees are not enforced and
instead a decree passed in May
1934 regulating indigenous mar¬
riages is still applied. This de¬
cree states quite clearly : "The
death of the husband does not
bring about ipso facto the rup¬
ture of the conjugal tie".
I repeat, therefore, that sla¬
very still exists in Africa and is
a flourishing, concern. The
trading in women has probably
never produced so much wealth
as in our own time.
Father Pierre Pichón
Catholic Mission, Yaounde,
The Cameroons.
Sir,
I should like to inform you
that we have purchased 500 co¬
pies of the December 1953 issue
of The Courier, which are being
distributed to the Directors of
Secondary Schools throughout
Spain and to many normal
school and higher education
teachers. I wish to congratu¬
late you on the high quality of
your atomic energy issue and
assure you that we consider The
Courier a valuable vehicle' for
bringing the ideas of interna¬
tional co-operation to the Spa¬
nish teaching profession.

<![CDATA[
UNESCO COURIER - K» 3 - 1954
by the American States early in 1945.
Even before the war ended, however,
editors in the United States of America
had begun to interest themselves in the
freer flow of information, and their,
efforts eventually inspired the drafting
of the Convention on' the Gathering and
International Transmission of News
adopted by the Geneva Conference on
Freedom of Information. And cen¬
sorship, as one of the obstacles prevent¬
ing "peoples speaking to peoples" was
studied by the American Commission on
Freedom of the Press in a 1946 report.
The problem of censorship was exten¬
sively discussed at the Geneva Confe¬
rence on Freedom of Information, the
representative of France summing up a
general feeling that there - should be
"total abolition of censorship, but if
maintained in certain countries it
should be so organized as to permit
journalists to carry out their functions
in a rational manner".
The conference then proceeded to
include in the Convention on the
Gathering and International Transmis¬
sion of News an article containing a
positive injunction against censorship of
outgoing dispatches, with the provision
that Contracting States could make and
enforce regulations "relating directly to
the maintenance of national military
security". The article added that if it
were necessary to impose censorship in
peacetime, it should be carried out
under certain ' stipulated conditions
aimed at facilitating the work of foreign
correspondents. These conditions re¬
mained substantially the same in later
redrafts of the Convention and appear
in the text eventually adopted by the
General Assembly.
Abuse of freedom
The Economic and Social Council at
its seventh session decided that the
concept of "national military secu¬
rity" was too restrictive and employed
the words "national security". However,
the General Assembly considered that
the Council's language was. too broad
and reverted to a narrower expression,
"relating directly to -national defence",
What action is possible" to alleviate, if
not abolish peacetime consorship? First
;of all, an earnest effort must be made
to rescue the convention articles relating
to the international transmission of
hews, which have been approved by the
General Assembly, from their state of
suspended animation and to have them
opened for signature. This should be
possible when work on the draft Con¬
vention on Freedom of Information is
completed.
Even in countries where the concept
of freedom of information is accepted,
restrictive measures have in many
instances been imposed ostensibly for
the protection of the common interest.
This fact makes it all the more ne¬
cessary to safeguard this freedom
against encroachment and attempts to
curtail, cripple or even destroy it by
legislative or administrative measures.
On the other hand, the misuse or
abuse of this freedom may constitute a
serious threat both to the community as
a whole and to individual citizens, and
unless the law provides sufficient means
of protective action and redress, the
private citizen is left without defence
against the powerful organs of infor¬
mation.
It follows that the problem here, as
with human liberty in general, is to
regulate this freedom without destroying
it. Though a great variety of systems
are conceivable for this purpose, two
main trends can be distinguished.
Countries committed to the principle of
freedom of information are moving
along similar lines and have adopted
legislation which, while differing in
details, has the same starting point and
seeks the same results. On the other
hand, the legislation of countries where
information media are regarded as
having a social function which should
be directly supervised by the State,
moves along different lines.
Obviously, a balance must be found
between the freedom to seek and disse¬
minate information and the necessity of
protecting the individual and the com¬
munity as a whole against misuse of this
right. Therefore most countries have
promulgated legislation enabling the
authorities to intervene in case of need.
In general, the publication of certain
types of news endangering national
security is everywhere liable to punish¬
ment; while publications offensive to
good morals expose their authors to
penal sanctions. Press laws almost
everywhere tend to protect family life,
and information likely to impede the
course of justice, contempt of court and
similar offences exposes the author to
more or less severe penalties.
Freedom of information is con¬
stantly faced with the possibility of
intervention by the State. By claiming
that it is necessary to prevent the
diffusion of false or distorted news, to
prohibit propaganda subversive of public
order or the existing system of govern¬
ment, to protect youthful readers, to
maintain high standards of morals, to
uphold religion and punish blasphemy
and so on, the State can and often does
intervene, and this may easily become
permanent, impeding the free publica¬
tion of information and opinion.
"It follows that no constitutional or
legal provisions as such can guarantee
freedom of information unless a people's
fundamental conception of society
recognizes that the best government is
that which allows citizens to form and
express .their own opinion on all
matters, including the government, and
unless that conception pervades the
entire fabric of national life.
A present danger
To say that every man -is entitled to
freedom of expression subject to
consequential penalties for abuse
is not enough and, indeed, may be dan¬
gerous. It is like telling a man that he
may say whatever he likes, reserving to
yourself the right to bash his head in if
you do not agree with what he says.
Restraint in the application of conse¬
quential penalties must be regarded as a
vital ingredient of. freedom of infor¬
mation.
Perhaps more than any other human
right, freedom of information lends
itself to extremes of abuse and repres¬
sion. It is not easy to indicate precisely
where freedom ends and license begins,
or, even if this could be done, to indicate
where license begins to be a "clear and
present danger". The bewildering va¬
riety of libel laws and press laws
throughout the world shows how com¬
plicated the problem and the present
situation are.
Nevertheless, it is clear that such
laws, together with the practices to
which they have given rise, actually
determine the degree of freedom of
information which exists within each
country, as well as the highest common
denominator of freedom which is pos¬
sible in the world. Therefore a detailed
study of this difficult subject would be
useful in showing the possibility of
establishing common standards, within
the framework of which a working
compromise between freedom and res¬
ponsibility can be achieved.

largest with 61,457,000. Oceania has a
circulation of 4,504,100 copies for
14,000,000 inhabitants; while Africa has
the smallest circulation, with 2,226,090
for 203,000,000 inhabitants. Three
countries United States, United King¬
dom and Japan have 53 % of the total
world circulation.
In continents where the press was
developed earlier, the tendency towards
concentration has become more marked
with an increase in , individual cir¬
culations as the number of newspapers
diminishes. The most typical ' example
of this phenomenon is found in the
United Kingdom, which has the largest
daily newspaper circulation per 1,000 in¬
habitants (611 copies per 1,000 in¬
habitants). Whereas the total daily
newspaper circulation in the United
Kingdom is 31,000,000 (more than half
the circulation of all dailies" in North
America) there are only 122 daily news¬
papers. This is less than the number
of daily newspapers published in Mexico
(162, with a circulation of 1,300,000) or
in Argentina (140, with a circulation of
1,800,000), and only slightly higher than
the number of dailies -appearing in
Turkey (116, with a circulation of
692,700). - .
For the world the average circulation
of daily newspapers per 1,000 inhabitants
is 88. The United Kingdom has the
highest average circulation figure : 611
per 1,000 inhabitants. Australia, with
416 per 1,000 inhabitants, New Zealand,
with .358 per 1,000 inhabitants, and
Canada with 248 per 1,000 inhabitants,
are also high up on the list, which tends
to prove that the evolution of the press
in the Dominions follows that of the
United Kingdom.
If the 7,520 daily newspapers published
throughout the world are grouped ac-
cording to language of publication, it is

seen that more than one-quarter are
printed in English. The English language
press is by far the world's largest.-
Taking into account the lack of inform¬
ation about newspapers in Russian, the
press in the Chinese language comes
next (904 dailies), but it is far smaller
than the English language ; press. If
one considers the circulation figures for
daily newspapers published in the

classification is, however, different.

The best figure for Europe is 300, and
for Oceania 250. By comparison, the
highest figure for both South America
and Asia is 125; for Africa, less than 50.
Africa is worst equipped. Most African
territories are non-self-governing, and
to all intents and purposes the press,
film and radio have- been developed-
exclusively for the relatively small white
population. Few ..territories have as
many as one radio receiver per 1,000
inhabitants. The principal exceptions
to the above figures are the French
North African territories, Egypt, and the
Union of South Africa.
There has been a considerable effort
throughout - Asia in recent years to
develop broadcasting, but the average
number of receivers per 1,000 inhabi¬
tants rarely exceeds five, and is in some
countries less than one.

(centre) while technical progress has now made
it possible to transmit photographs by telephone
across the world (right). The most industrially
developed areas are well supplied with means of
The countries of Central and South
America have in general much more
developed communications, though, once
again, within this general area there are
marked differences. Only in one or two
cases are there less than twenty receiv¬
ing sets per 1,000 population.
To evaluate cinema-going facilities we
may take as a unit of measurement the
capacity of theatres, in terms of the
number of seats per 1,000 inhabitants.
Here one reservation is needed. Where
the cinema-going habit is firmly estab- .
lished, all towns of a certain size have
their permanent "picture-palaces", and
it is relatively simple to collect statistics
as to their capacity. But even in these
countries, many villages are served by
travelling projectionists who set up their
apparatus once or twice a week in a
local hall; and in the United States there
are over two thousand "drive-in" . cine¬
mas where seating capacity cannot be
' calculated exactly.
In the under-developed countries,
mobile projection units operating in
schools, public halls, even in the open
air, often serve a larger public than do
the few permanent cinemas.
. It is nevertheless significant that in
the developed areas there are rarely less
than thirty seats per 1,000 inhabitants
(in several there are more than seventy)
whereas, with the exception -of the
Middle East, there are generally less
than four in Africa and Asia. There
is greater activity in film production in
Asia than in Africa, but exhibition faci¬
lities are less developed. The over-all
average of the number of seats per 1,000
inhabitants is little above two.
There are six world news agencies :
three American. (AP, INS, UP), one Bri¬
tish (Reuters), one French (Agence
France-Presse) and one Russian (TASS).
In 54 countries there are today 76
national agencies which provide a daily
service of local news. The list of these
agencies shows that the different parts
communication, but millions in less fortunate
regions are completely uninformed about what
the rest of the world is doing and thinking.
- ' - * (Photos COI and USIS.)
of the world are very unevenly
informed of happenings in their own
-countries. The regions which are best
off are those where the development of
education has permitted a powerful
press and broadcasting industry to come
into existence.
In many countries, particularly, in
Africa, South America and Central
America, the general public has to
depend for news of national events on
the sparse correspondents of the too
often ill-equipped local newspapers. In
some, such as Mexico and Egypt, they
have actually to rely on foreign agencies
for it. For the under-developed regions:
in Africa, only four territories have
national news agencies; on the whole of
the American continent, outside of the
United States and Canada, only five
countries have national agencies; and
in Asia only fifteen.
What do these facts and figures add
up to?
First, every country in the world
depends on the six world agencies for
getting its national news brought to the
attention of the outside world; second,
every country in the world depends on
the six world agencies for its supply of
foreign news; and third, many of the
countries which as yet do not have
national ' agencies depend to a large
extent on the world agencies for the
supply even of their own national news.
The first point is a cause of under¬
standable anxiety to many governments,
which naturally resent the fact that
news of their country reaches the world
exclusively through a foreign enterprise.
Moreover, there is a limit to the amount
of news that can be carried in a day's
file, with the result that news of a small
country has little chance of getting into
the main service unless it concerns a
subject of world-wide importance or is of
a sensational nature.
This leads to the second point. The
fact that six agencies constitute the only
source of world news does . not mean
that every country receives the services
of all six. In fact, only Afghanistan,
Indonesia, Iran, Japan, and Lebanon,
with Hong Kong and Berlin, can be said
actually to receive world news through
all six agencies, and they account for
little more than 8 per cent of the total
world population.
The effect of this situation on freedom
of information is clear. The reason
preventing the creation of national news
agencies in all countries, or of new
world agencies is essentially economic.
A news agency must have clients willing
to pay enough for its services to cover
at least its costs of operation. The
moment an agency is forced, in order
to cover its cost, to accept money other
than for services rendered, be it a
government subsidy or a grant from any
private body, its status and services tend
to be regarded with suspicion.
Hence, though temporary measures,
including government subsidies, may
be considered practical necessities to
assist in their creation, in the long run
independent agencies can only exist
where press and broadcasting enter¬
prises have first been sufficiently
developed.
What are the obstacles to development
of the Press?
Foremost is the illiteracy rate. Though
literacy statistics are mostly little
better than estimates, it may be said
in general that the commonly prevail¬
ing rate of illiteracy in Africa is between
80 and 90 per cent, and in Central and
South America slightly over 50 per cent.
Nevertheless there has been in recent
years a truly world-wide movement
towards education, and in several
regions where literacy campaigns are
being carried on, it has already been
found that the problem is not that of
teaching the relatively simple mechanics
of reading, but of ensuring a supply of
reading matter for the new literates.
The second obstacle is inadequate
supplies and equipment for the Press.
The problem of newsprint Is of such
importance that a separate section of
this report has been devoted to it. Less
crucial, but by no means unimportant,
is the question of composing and print¬
ing machinery.
Finally, there are the obstacles
inherent in the economic life of a news¬
paper. An independent press obtains
its resources in two ways : by the sale
of copies and by advertising. But in the
economically under-developed countries
revenue from advertising is difficult to
obtain,, and the life of a newspaper will
be precarious if it must rely largely on
the sale of copies where the purchasing
power of the population is low.
Many of the difficulties encountered
in other media do not arise, or are less
acute, in broadcasting, and under-deve¬
loped countries wishing to expand their
information facilities would do well to
concentrate first on this medium. For
countries with a high proportion of illi¬
teracy the advantage of radio is obvious,
and the immediacy of radio, and its
relative cheapness, give it a decided
advantage over the film. ,
The facts and figures presented above were
taken from the followm a sources : "A Report on
Freedom of Information", ¡¡resented by Mr. Salva¬
dor Lopez, to the U.N. Economic and Social Coun¬
cil; "News Agencies, their Structure and Opera¬
tion", published by Unesco; and "The Daily
Press", a survey of the world situation, (N° 1,
December 1953 issue of Reports and Papers on
Mass Communication) published by Unesco.

From the Unesco Newsroom...
M. RULY RURAL TEXT¬
BOOKS: In many countries, the
differences between rural and
urban life are very great, and
country teachers are now urging
that the manner and content of
rural education be specially
adapted to meet the needs of
those who live by the soil. In
France, for example, a recently
published textbook on arithmetic
used situations and objects which
are familiar in the countryside.
A typical problem reads: "During
a drought, a farmer has to fill
his water-waggon at a stream
24 minutes walk away. He needs
two-and-a-half waggon loads dai¬
ly. How much time will he lose
in 34 days of drought?"
PROTECTING CUL¬
TURE: A draft convention
for the protection of monu¬
ments, works of art and his¬
torical documents against
the risks entailed by armed
conflict will be studied at a
special conference to be held
at the Hague Peace Palace,
in April. Eighty-six coun¬
tries have been invited by
Unesco to send representa¬
tives with the necessary
powers to sign the Conven¬
tion if full agreement is
reached on the text.
S CHOOL BY POST AND
RADIO: In France, official teach¬
ing by correspondence courses
which are followed by more than
18,000 pupils has been supple¬
mented by radio lessons thus en¬
abling teachers to come into di¬
rect contact with their pupils.
Other broadcasts explain pro¬
blems of school and vocational
guidance to parents.
UNESCO IN SWEDEN
AND DENMARK: Children,
and adults in Sweden, which
has an advanced school and
social aid system, recently
learned a great deal about
the problems of less develop¬
ed countries and about the
help given to these countries
by the United Nations and
its Specialized Agencies, dur¬
ing a special "Unesco Week"
held in the town of Vasteras.
Films, exhibitions and lec¬
tures explained how such
help falls within the work
of Unesco in promoting lite¬
racy, human rights and in¬
ternational understanding.
Another "Unesco Week" is
to be organized in Malmo,
Sweden's third largest city.
Films, special broadcasts and
study groups on similar
themes are the main features
of a Danish "Unesco Week",
being organized this month
near Copenhagen, by - the
Danish National Commission
for Unesco and Denmark's
leading youth associations.
MJ EARNING BY LIVING:
A comparison of the forms com¬
munity education takes in India,
Mexico, Canada, Japan, Puerto
Rico, the- United Kingdom and
the United States has been out¬
lined by Philippine educator Pe¬
dro T. Orata, in a brochure
Community Education Abroad
published by the Unesco ~ Philip¬
pine Educational Foundation.
Community schools, according to
the Philippine definition, are
.those where democracy as a way
of life is taught through learning-
living situations in which group
action plays an important role.
The pupils learn not only from
books but also from the exper¬
iences of others how best to live
usefully in their community and
be good citizens.
FRESHENING UP FRES¬
COES: A new technique for
preserving frescoes on the
walls of ancient Roman
buildings has been develop¬
ed by the Instituto del Res¬
tauro, in Rome. The process
makes it possible to remove
the pictures from the plaster
walls where they are rotting
and decaying with damp and
exposure. A specially pre¬
pared canvas is pasted on to
the wall and then peeled off
and passed on to a roller.
The paintings are then past¬
ed back on to another can¬
vas to reveal their top sur¬
face, stretched and fixed on
to a suitable foundation. The
new technique has been
meeting, attended by the
King of Sweden, the Prime
Minister, ministers of Foreign
Affairs and Education and
representatives of the diplo¬
matic corps, was addressed
by Mr. Dag Hammarskjold,
Secretary-General of the
United Nations, and a mes¬
sage was read from' the
Director-General of Unesco.
£ YE ON THE SKY:
Astronomers from six European
countries met in Leyden,.Holland,
recently to discuss the co-opera¬
tive construction of an observa¬
tory in the Southern Hemisphere.
South Africa was suggested as a
possible site, and research on
atmospheric conditions is now to
be made there. At present, there
is no large telescope available to
study the skies of the Southern
Hemisphere.
LESS HOMEWORK: A
law limiting the homework
of children aged from 12 to
15 to two hours each evening
is to be introduced in Bel-
UNESCO TRAVELLERS' CHEQUES
TO AID STUDENTS, TEACHERS
A scheme aimed at overcoming currency barriers to cultural travel
abroad was recently launched by Unesco when it put into circulation the
first four hundred thousand dollars' -worth of new "Unesco Travel Cou¬
pons". The coupons are a .form of ioternational travellers' cheque,
providing the foreign exchange needed by such travellers as students,
teachers and research workers when they attend educational Institutions
or conferences in other countries. People living In so-called "soft-
currency" areas usually find it difficult to obtain the "hard-currency"
- of countries where they wish to I study or do research work. Travel cou-
- pons will enable them to obtain dollars, Swiss francs or other currencies
in exchange for the money of their own countries. Eleven countries
already have agreed to participate in the new project, and other Unesco
Member States are expected to join 'soon.

ment made by Professor
Harmel, Belgian Minister of
Education. Parents' com¬
plaints about overworked
children have a long history
in Belgium, where each
teacher in an athénée or
lycée sets homework as often
as he thinks fit and with¬
out regard to other subjects.
NOW CLASSES : Fol¬
lowing the success of an experi¬
ment last year, girls and boys
from Paris secondary schools have
been sent this year to various
Alpine resorts for a month of
studies, sport and gymnastics.
Health benefits from these free
"snow classes" were so good that
the Paris Municipal Council has
voted the money to extend them ~
to more children.
HELPING OTHERS:
Sweden's contribution to in¬
ternational co-operation and
understanding was the theme
of a conference of Non-Go¬
vernmental Organizations
held in Stockholm, and ar¬
ranged by the Swedish Na¬
tional Commission for Unes¬
co. Speeches and discussions
dealt with many aspects of
international co-operation,
such as "Economic Views on
International Scientific Col¬
laboration", "Culture and
Economic Development". The
GI OOD QUALITY T.V.:
The first international seminar
for television producers and di¬
rectors of educational and cultu¬
ral programmes will be held in
London in July by the British
Broadcasting Corporation and
Unesco. Main problems to be
discussed include the possible
dangers of television to society,
the problem of mediocre pro¬
grammes and the need to find a
way of using television for edu¬
cational and cultural purposes
while meeting the demands of
the mass audience.
BRAZILIANS ABROAD:
Unesco has signed an agree¬
ment with the National
Campaign- for the Training
of Higher Specialized Per¬
sonnel (CAPES),- an agency
of the Brazilian Ministry of
Education, under which from
60 to 80 fellowships will be
awarded, during the next
18 months, to Brazilian na¬
tionals. Brazilian educators,
research personnel and tech¬
nicians will benefit from the
facilities which Unesco has
developed in more than 30
countries for the reception of
students from abroad and
the supervision of program¬
mes of study. This is the
first agreement of this type
between Unesco and a na¬
tional educational agency,
where international admini¬
strative services are to be
utilized for fellowships
financed by the Government
itself for its own nationals.
N,EWS OF THE PAST:
The history of the Jewish people
against the background of world
history is told exactly as though
it were happening today in "Chro¬
nicles" which is published in the
form of a modern daily news¬
paper in Jerusalem. Biblical
events - make -striking headlines:
"King Saul is dead. Falls on his
sword as army collapses about
him", says one, telling of the
king's defeat by the Philistines.
"We are leaving Egypt", says an¬
other, telling the story of the
Exodus. Reports from "our own
corespondents" tell of the crossing
of the Red Sea and the fall of
Jericho. "Chronicles" is being
used in schools to teach ancient
history in a particularly lively
way.
OVER 100,000 STUDENTS
SEEK KNOWLEDGE
ABROAD. Over 100,000'
students are attending uni¬
versities or other centres of
higher education in countries1
other than their own accord¬
ing to a world-wide survey
made by Unesco.' The cen--
sus of the foreign student
population, started last year,
has been broadened into the'
most comprehensive survey
of the field ever undertaken.
The results are published in'
Study Abroad the current,
sixth volume of Unesco's
International Handbook of
Fellowships, Scholarships
and Educational Exchange,
now issued in three langua--
ges, English, French and'
Spanish, and listing oppor-
tunities offered in all parts
of the world for study
abroad.
The survey shows that a'
total of 107,000 foreign stu¬
dents are attending 2,014'
institutions in 70 countries
and territories. This com¬
pares with 85,000 students in
first survey in 1948. While (
