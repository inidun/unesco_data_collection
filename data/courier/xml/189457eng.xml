SIXTY YEARS OF VIEWS ON THE WORLD
The UNESCO Courier is celebrating its 60th anniversary. An opportunity to explore the present while looking back at the past. 
A way, also, to highlight some developments in how we view and think about the world - each paper refers to an article  
from a back issue of the magazine. 
You can read interviews with Wangari Maathai (Kenya), Martti Ahtisaari (Finland), Luc Montagnier (France), just to  
mention the three Nobel laureates who have contributed to this special issue, alongside other distinguished personalities.
2008 - N° 10

FROZEN CONFLICTS
Former president of Finland Martti Ahtisaari was awarded the 
UNESCO Felix Houphouët-Boigny Peace Prize on 2 October, eight 
days before the Norwegian Nobel Committee gave him the 2008 
Nobel Peace Prize for his efforts to broker peace in Namibia, Northern 
Ireland, Indonesia and the Balkans. 3
ADIM ARDATOVSKY: THE CHALLENGE OF PEACE
The Courier, 1967. 4
RACISM IS A MUTANT
Xenophobia and racism are intellectual constructs that have taken root  
in the human mind over the centuries. Legal measures are proving 
inadequate, as they only touch the visible tip of the iceberg. An intellectual 
strategy is needed, in order to reach into the historical and cultural depths 
of these plagues, and to eliminate them from the minds of humans. 9
JOHN REX: THE UBIQUITOUS SHADOW OF RACISME
The Courier, 1968.11
LUC MONTAGNIER: BUILDING UP IMMUNITIES
For the past ten years, Luc Montagnier, winner of the 2008 Nobel 
Prize for Medicine, has been insisting that efforts to stem the AIDS 
epidemic must involve a combination of prevention and a therapeutic 
vaccine. At first, his call for a vaccine fell on deaf ears. But, today, he 
has high hopes that soon a therapeutic vaccine will enable a body 
infected with HIV to build its own defences. 15
JOHN R. VANE: CO-OPERATION,  
THE BEST WAY TO COMBAT AIDS
The Courier,1988.  17
HUMAN DIGNITY IN QUESTION
Scientific progress can sometimes catch ethicists unawares.  
This was the case with the cloning of Dolly the sheep in 1997  
and, today, with cybrids and nanotechnologies. The philosopher  
and anthropologist Georges Kutukdjian, author of the article  
“UNESCO and Bioethics”, published in our magazine in 1994,  
takes a look at the latest challenges for bioethics. 19
UNESCO AND BIOETHICS

WANGARI MAATHAI:  
HOPES AND DISAPPOINTMENTS
Proud of Africa’s progress yet sceptical about governments, 
Wangari Maathai from Kenya, 2004 Nobel Peace Prize winner, 
believes that African leaders are largely responsible for the ills that 
plague the continent. Instead of complaining, they should better 
control the exploitation of African resources and populations. 24
WANGARI MUTA MAATHAI:  
KENYA’S GREEN MILITANT 
The Courier, 1999. 26
MADAGASCAR : BALANCING ACT
Madagascar, the fourth largest island in the world, famous  
for its unusual biodiversity, may soon be known  
as a modern-day example of the Tragedy of the Commons.  
Both people and wildlife are struggling to survive as natural  
resources dwindle, and little time remains for the island  
to be salvaged from ecological disaster. 30
WHY WILDLIFE MATTERS...

RUTH BENEDICT:  
LAST MESSAGE ON CULTURAL CONTINUITY 
IN CIVILIZED WORLD
The Courier 1948.  38
CULTURAL DIVERSITY AND EDUCATION:  
WHAT HAS CHANGED SINCE 60 YEARS AGO?
1948: the American anthropologist, Ruth Benedict,  
emphasises the role of culture in education and international 
cooperation. 2008: the French anthropologist, Cécile Duvelle, 
takes stock - the idea has filtered into our thinking, but is still 
struggling to be turned into practice.   36
 ARAB LANDS: LEARNING MEANS LIGHT
The Courier 1961.  42
EDUCATION:  
THE OTHER GLOBAL EMERGENCY
Western countries have pulled together multi-billion-dollar plans 
to save their banking systems from catastrophe. The same deter-
mination, says the 2009 Education for All Global  
Monitoring Report, Overcoming inequality: why governance  
matters, is needed to tackle failing education systems. 39
Down through the years  
The magazine is sixty years old today. It has changed a great deal over the years and, since March 2006,  
has only been available online. Some of those who have left their mark on the magazine look back..  47

                                     Former president of Finland Martti Ahtisaari was awarded the UNESCO 
                   Felix Houphouët-Boigny Peace Prize on 2 October, eight days before the Norwegian

nisms for conflict resolution. 
Nevertheless, in every speech I 
make, I denounce the attitude that 
people take as if it were normal that 
conflicts become frozen. I think that 
we have to demand that the coun-
tries that have major influence in 
any given conflict and whose coop-
eration is vital are prepared to use 
this influence and lean on the coun-
tries concerned to solve these [fro-
zen] conflicts. I cannot accept that 
nothing is done to convince these 
countries to use their influence. 
We have to show we are serious 
about human rights. Human rights 
are undermined one way or another 
in every single conflict, and the U.N. 
must be seen to take human rights 
seriously. 
In general, I would say that above 
human rights, we have to advance 
rule of law in the world in general. 
in the absence of rule of law there 
can be no respect for human rights.
What about UNESCO’s  
mandate to create solidarity 
among peoples in in its fields  
of competence? Has it made  
a difference in terms  
of building peace in the minds 
of men, to use the phrase  
of UNESCO’s constitution?
I got involved with UNESCO when 
I worked with liberation movements 
especially SWAPO (South-West 
African People’s Organisation, Na-
mibia) and the education resources 
that UNESCO provided were ex-
tremely useful. 
I don’t think that the work of orga-
nizations like UNESCO can ever 
be finished. I hope that this work is 
maintained. 
I also hope that organisations like 
UNESCO can help countries emer- 
ging from conflicts to look at the 
past. The only country that has done 
so in Europe is Germany. Nobody 
else has and we can see that some 
of the problems that are plaguing 
us in Europe are directly due to the 
fact that we haven’t examined our 
past properly. 
Which of your negotiating  
experiences as a peace  
negotiator have been most  
satisfying and which have  
been most challenging  
and frustrating? 
I am not easily frustrated, other-
wise I wouldn’t be in this exercise at 
all and I have been lucky to achieve 
solutions. Namibia in a sense took 
far too long: I became UN Special 
Representative in 1977 and it last-
ed until 1989 when we were able 
to get our operations started. There 
were moments when I considered 
leaving, but I was very glad that I 
stuck with it because it was satisfy-
ing in the end. 
Maybe Namibia is one exception, 
maybe because Finland has a spe-
cial bond with Namibia due to Finn-
ish missionaries who worked there 
for a hundred years. That was very 
useful as the churches of Namibia 
played an important role in the 
peace process. Also, on a personal 
level, as secretary general of the 
Finnish Student Association, I re-
ceived the first Namibian students 
who came to Finland in the early 
1960s so I had long term personal 
engagement that started long be-
fore I became U.N. Commissioner 
for Namibia.
Looking at the bigger picture, 
do you see world peace  
as progressing or regressing?
The number of conflicts is dimin-
ishing but we have too many fro-
zen conflicts, the most important 
of which is the Middle East. It really 
needs to be solved and everybody 
knows on which basis it has to be 
solved. This conflict spoils the inter-
national atmosphere and as long as 
it is not solved we will not be able to 
solve the conflicts in Afghanistan, 
Irak and Iran. 
Has the United Nations been 
successful in serving  
the interests of peace? 
Yes it has. We have had much time 
to improve preparations for the me-
diation and negotiation of conflicts 
and many of the peace keeping 
operations also facilitate our work. 
The U.N. is improving its capacity 
through the establishment of new 
units and different funding mecha-

«The womb is fertile still, from which 
the foul beast came,” wrote the 
German playwright, Berthold Bre-
cht, when the Second World War 
was at its height. The solemnity of 
this phrase still resounds today. 
The recent victory of Barack 
Obama in the US presidential elec-
tions is, indeed, a blow to racism 
and could have significant reper-
cussions. We could hardly fail to be 
overjoyed that Martin Luther King’s 
dream has finally come true. But, at 
the same time, how can we ignore 
the inter-ethnic violence that broke 
out earlier this year in Kenya, the 
country where the President-elect’s 
father was born? 
Racism is a mutant. Before we 
have even finished battling its older 
manifestations – anti-Semitism, and 
racism against black people and Ar-
abs – we are already seeing a re-
surgence of hatred in other guises. 
Especially since the 11 September 
2001 attacks, the alarming notion 
of potentially terrorist communities 
has emerged, showing just how 
dangerous it can be to lump togeth-
er certain acts with factors such as 
race, culture and religion.
Racism did not fall 
from the sky
This kind of amalgam obscures an 
analysis or understanding of rac-
ism. There was a time when rac-
ist ideas were peddled by parties 
clearly identified as belonging to 
the extreme right. But, gradually, 
under the pretext of defending na-
tional identity, and combating illegal 
immigration or terrorism, inherently 
racist arguments have crept into 
the electoral campaigns of demo-
cratic parties. Alliances within cer-
tain governments are allowing na-
tionalist and extreme right parties 
to implement their xenophobic and 
racist ideals, by giving them a dem-
ocratic legitimacy. 
The use of racism for electoral or 
political ends is now being comple-
mented by an intellectual or sci-
entific legitimisation of racism and 
xenophobia, as seen in the declara-
tions of well-known public figures, 
university research and mass mar-
ket publications. 
To take just one example, there 
was the theory of the clash of civili-
sations, developed by the American 
academic, Samuel Huntington in 
the mid-1990s, according to which 
the West would be threatened by 
China and Islam. A few years later, 
in his book, Who Are We? he went 
on to ponder the supposed threat 
to American identity posed by Lat-
in-Americans living in the USA. 
Racist or xenophobic ideas ex-
pressed by people who have en-
joyed fame at a certain moment in 
history gradually filter into politics, 
religion, literature, education and 
the media, ending up by taking root 
in people’s minds. The distorted im-
age of Muslims did not begin with 
11 September. It is the result of a 
lengthy intellectual process that 
started with the first encounters 
between Islam and Christianity. The 
distorted image of black people is 
the fruit of an intellectual process 
that legitimised the transatlantic 
slave-trade and justified the sale of 
human beings by proving their infe-
riority, by demonising them, and re-
ducing them to mere objects, turn-
ing to theories and laws for support. 
In other words, racism has deep, 
cultural and historical roots, and did 
not just fall from the sky one day.
If the clash of civilisations is an 
illusion, multiculturalism is a real-
ity. Let us take the example of the 
new Europe. National identities le-

gitimately inherited by nation states 
rub shoulders every day with the 
identities of other ethnic, cultural 
and religious communities. The for-
mer feel threatened and the latter, 
frustrated. 
A deafening silence
This frustration does not just come 
from the political, economic and so-
cial marginalisation of people whom 
we ask to divest themselves of their 
identity, to stuff their memories in an 
old trunk and take on, as in France, 
the costume of the Republic, the 
symbol of their new identity. The 
roots of this frustration plunge deep 
into history. But public debate on the 
deeper causes of the presence of 
these communities on European soil 
is virtually non-existent. Colonialism 
and the slave trade are glossed over 
or suppressed as chapters in his-
tory. After all, we had to wait until the 
international conference on racism 
in Durban (South Africa) in 2001 for 
the transatlantic slave trade finally 
to be recognised as a crime against 
humanity. Distorting or ignoring cer-
tain historical realities, preventing 
them from passing into the national 
memory, can only lead to flare-ups, 
like those that erupted in French 
suburbs two years ago. 
We might wonder if, in the process 
of unification, Europe has not over-
looked a fundamental problem – the 
creation of a new identity, in other 
words, the multiculturalism that de-
fines it today. Looking at certain 
immigration policies, we might ask 
if Europe is even aware that immi-
grants are also carriers of humanity, 
and that multiculturalism is mutually 
enriching. Foreigners who come to 
live in Europe have to adapt to the 
social rules of their host country. 
That is not in question. But they must 
also be able to plant a few beautiful 
flowers in Europe’s garden. 
Multiculturalism at the 
core of the struggle 
Multiculturalism is at the core of 
contemporary manifestations of 
racism and xenophobia, and it is 
around multiculturalism that the 
struggle against racism must be 
shaped. 
Rapidly spreading outbreaks of 
violence between ethnic and re-
ligious groups can be witnessed 
around the world, showing that a 
purely legislative strategy is not 
enough. It is essential to continue 
to pass laws, and to draft regula-
tions and other national or inter-
national texts condemning racism, 
discrimination and xenophobia, but 
this only strikes at the visible tip of 
the iceberg. What render the womb 
fertile, in the words of Brecht, are 
the deeper sources of racism, 
which cannot be influenced by leg-
islation alone. 
It is essential to have an intellectu-
al and ethical strategy. Without this, 
we will not be able to shake the rac-
ist mentality. It means getting to the 
historical and cultural basis of rac-
ism; uniting against the fecundity of 
racist arguments, against their use 
by politicians and their normalisa-
tion by the media. It means recog-
nising the reality of cultural, ethnic 
and religious diversity as the basis 
for dialogue between civilisations, 
on the national as well as the inter-
national stage - in a word, learning 
to live together. 
In order to oust racist ideology, it 
is necessary to develop an archae-
ology of the deep-seated causes 
of racism. Anti-racist ideology must 
follow the same paths which racism 
has used to insinuate itself – politics, 
religion, literature, education and the 
media – to end up by taking root in 
the minds of men and women.

have since received the support of 
all the country’s successive govern-
ments. The Centre is in the capital, 
Abidjan, but there are branches in 
other Ivorian towns. 
We started by setting up a labora-
tory dedicated to isolating the virus. 
Today the Centre has a new build-
ing for diagnosis and the treatment 
of outpatients. It also has a lecture 
room for education and preven-
tion. Here, we train trainers to raise 
awareness in the local population 
on AIDS prevention in the work-
place. For example, most of what, 
in Africa, are called “the uniformed 
corps” (the military, police, fire fight-
ers, customs, rangers, etc) have 
sent delegations for training in our 
Centre. 
You recently opened a Centre 
in Cameroon, too. But, accord-
ing to UNAIDS, it is mostly in 
Southern Africa that the epi-
demic is reaching disastrous 
proportions. 
Although the figures for West Af-
rica are less alarming than those for 
Southern Africa, they are still much 
higher than anything we are seeing 
in industrialised countries. The rate 
LUC MONTAGNIER:   
BUILDING UP IMMUNITIES
Twenty years ago in the Courier, 
British scientist John R. Vane 
(Nobel prize in medicine 1982) 
stressed the importance of  
international cooperation in the 
battle against AIDS. Today, one of 
the principal protagonists of this  
cooperation, Luc Montagnier from 
France, lists in his interview with 
Jasmina Šopova the weapons  
we have against the pandemic, 
which has killed more than  
25 million people in the world. 
The World Foundation for AIDS 
Research and Prevention that 
you set up under the aegis of 
UNESCO is already 15 years 
old. What are its aims and what 
results has it produced? 
The Foundation aims to promote 
AIDS research and prevention, 
especially in developing countries, 
which are the most affected by this 
disease. It sets up pilot centres in 
these countries to develop a triple 
strategy, combining prevention, ed-
ucation and research. 
In 1996 we set up a research cen-
tre in Côte d’Ivoire with, of course, 
the agreement and aid of the Ivo-
rian government at the time. We 
of infection in Côte d’Ivoire is cur-
rently running at about 5.7%. This 
is not negligible. 
We looked into the possibility of 
opening a centre in South Africa 
a few years ago. But at that time 
the authorities there were not con-
vinced that the virus that we had 
isolated was the cause of AIDS, 
and so they did not offer their sup-
port. In the Congo, Gabon and 
Tanzania, the Heads of state were 
interested, but we came up against 
the question of funding. 
It should be pointed out that the 
Foundation can only act if States 
support it, by providing land or 
funding. The Centre in Cameroon 
is funded by the government and 
aid from developed countries, such 
as Italy. I should also say that the 
government of Cameroon is making 
remarkable efforts in terms of youth 
education. I was surprised to visit 
schools where children aged 8 to 
10 knew all about AIDS. 
The Abidjan Centre operates par-
tially with its own funds. A large 
number of patients use it – those 
who can afford it, pay, of course. 
Those who cannot, do not pay. 
Treatment is often provided free, 
                                       For the past ten years, Luc Montagnier, winner of the 2008 Nobel Prize 
                     for Medicine, has been insisting that efforts to stem the AIDS epidemic must involve 
                        a combination of prevention and a therapeutic vaccine. At first, his call for a vaccine 
                             fell on deaf ears. But, today, he has high hopes that soon a therapeutic vaccine 
                                     will enable a body infected with HIV to build its own defences.
Following the announcement of his Nobel Prize in medicine, Luc Montagnier 
gave a press conference at UNESCO on 8 October 2008.

thanks to government policy and 
aid from the Global Fund to Fight 
AIDS, Tuberculosis and Malaria 
(GFATM).
Have you run into  
any cultural obstacles?
Africa has its specific problems. 
It is therefore extremely important 
to take the cultural context into ac-
count. Certain local practices facili-
tate transmission of the virus, such 
as ritual scarring of newborns, or 
childbirth without sterile instruments. 
Often, women come into the mater-
nity clinic in good health and leave 
HIV-positive, because of the re-use 
of non-sterile medical equipment. 
The main reason is a lack of resourc-
es, but there is also a lack of informa-
tion. Babies of working mothers are 
sometimes infected by the milk of 
wet-nurses who take care of them. 
At the same time, many people do 
not want to be tested for HIV, for 
fear of stigmatisation. Our role is to 
convince them to be tested so that 
they can then be treated. But when 
they are treated, some abandon the 
therapy for financial reasons as soon 
as they start to feel better. The result 
is that they fall ill again. 
Do you work  
with traditional healers? 
We could definitely envisage work-
ing with traditional practitioners. But it 
is not easy to regulate their products, 
since their composition is a secret, 
passed down from generation to 
generation. And, because they can-
not be patented, their products are 
of no interest to the pharmaceutical 
industry. 
In our Abidjan Centre we tested a 
product from Japan, based on fer-
mented papaya extract. The Japanese 
hold the secret of how it is made, but 
here is an example of a well-defined 
product, according to pharmaceuti-
cal criteria, and which has been sub-
ject to controlled clinical trials. Each 
batch is identical, which is not always 
the case with plant extracts. 
Trials showed that this product is 
not a replacement for triple therapy, 
of course, but it did enhance its bene-
ficial effects on the patients’ immune 
system. We have carried out a sec-
ond clinical trial and are waiting for 
the results. 
We are also testing other immuno-
stimulants. If the therapeutic vaccine 
that we are currently working on is to 
succeed, the patient’s immune sys-
tem has to be restored. Triple therapy 
alone is not enough. 
You think that AIDS will be 
eradicated through a therapeu-
tic vaccine. You already spoke 
about this in 2000 in UNESCO 
Sources magazine. What is 
the status of research today? 
The concept can already be traced 
back ten years. In the beginning, the 
idea of a therapeutic vaccine got a 
very poor reception from French and 
international funding bodies. The 
idea was not appealing, because 
there were hopes for a preventive 
vaccine and it was thought a cure 
would be found. 
Much has changed since then. We 
now know that triple therapy is not a 
cure and that lifelong treatment pro-
vokes toxic effects, leading to other 
illnesses that are often fatal. 
Today the therapeutic vaccine proj-
ect is mature and on a better course, 
because it will receive private funding.
Do you think that the Nobel 
Prize will help you to find other 
sources of funding?
I hope so! To give you a short and 
specific answer. 
What are the advantages  
of a therapeutic vaccine? 
Nature provides us with examples 
of people who are HIV carriers, but 
are not ill with AIDS. We are look-
ing for a therapeutic vaccine that 
will increase the immunity of some-
one who is infected, enabling his 
or her body to defend itself. Some-
one infected will therefore be able 
to live with HIV without developing 
the illness. 
It should be remembered that 
treatment for one person costs 
$12,000 a year, and it may go on 
for 20 or 30 years. A vaccine, on 
the other hand, requires just three 
injections: two successive shots 
and a booster later on. It’s stan-
dard. No matter how much it costs, 
it will be 20 - 50 times cheaper than 
triple therapy. 
When will we see a cure  
for AIDS? 
Curing people and getting rid of 
the epidemic are two different things. 
Curing is indeed our immediate 
objective, and this will have a sig-
nificant effect on the epidemic. 
When people know that they can 
be cured, they will more readily 
come forward for testing, those 
cured will no longer pass on the 
virus, and so on. 
But we cannot expect that we 
will miraculously find a cure over-
night. We should not count on a 
preventive vaccine in the immedi-
ate future. Personally, I do not be-
lieve in a preventive vaccine for 
AIDS. Clinical trials have shown 
that groups who were vaccinated 
were more likely to become in-
fected than those who were not, 
because they believed they were 
protected by the vaccine, which 
was not the case. 
AIDS could be eradicated by a 
combination of treatments that 
involves cure, information and 
education, especially targeted at 
young people in schools. Even if 
we find a preventive vaccine, we 
must still continue to educate 
people to behave responsibly to 
prevent the spread of HIV.

At a time when scientific research is 
increasingly international, national 
legislation and biomedical practices 
continue to diverge, creating an ap-
pearance of disorder that hides the 
main issue: the treatment of life as 
merchandise. 
“The human body and its parts shall 
not, as such, give rise to financial 
gain,” stipulates the 1997 Conven-
tion on Human Rights and Biomedi-
cine (Council of Europe). Given the 
principle of the non-commercial-
isation of the human body, its parts 
(organs and tissues) and products 
(gametes, cells, etc) have long been 
excluded from commercial gain. But 
several countries are reconsidering 
their position. For example, France 
is envisaging authorising surrogate 
motherhood and relaxing its legisla-
tion on remuneration for donors of 
organs, tissues or eggs, while strictly 
regulating practices. The Netherlands 
and the United Kingdom allow free 
gestational surrogacy under certain 
conditions. The British Parliament is 
studying the possibility of allowing 
specialised agencies to receive pay-
ment in return for certain services. Al-
though Spain has banned surrogate 
motherhood, Spanish couples often 
turn to women in Latin America to 
bear their children. And, today, the 
principle of non-commercialisation of 
the human body is being tested by the 
disparate practices and legislation in 
different parts of the world regarding 
organ and tissue transplants, removal 
of gametes for donation and “womb 
rental”. The current rate for the latter 
is between US$60,000 - $100,000 
dollars, in those States that allow it. 
Meanwhile, the ethical debate on 
the creation of embryos is being re-
vived with chimeric embryos, or cy-
                                    Scientific progress can sometimes catch ethicists unawares. 
                         This was the case with the cloning of Dolly the sheep in 1997 and, today, 
              with cybrids and nanotechnologies. The philosopher and anthropologist Georges Kutukdjian,
                                  author of the article “UNESCO and Bioethics”, published in our magazine in 1994,
                                            takes a look at the latest challenges for bioethics.
brids. The procedure, derived from 
cloning, consists of extracting the 
nucleus of a non-reproductive human 
cell and introducing it into the ovule 
of a rabbit or cow. Following a two-
year debate, the UK Parliament re-
cently authorised research on cybrid 
embryos, while the fertilisation of ani-
mal ovules by human sperm or vice-
versa is still banned. The law, dated 
13 June 2008, requires their destruc-
tion at the latest 14 days after their 
creation and bans implantation into a 
human or animal uterus. 
Research on cybrid embryos will un-
doubtedly advance our understand-
ing of the behaviour of embryo cells 
during the first 14 days, as well as the 
mechanisms of development of seri-
ous illnesses during these first stages 
of life. It will also replace the ethically 
debatable removal of human ovules 
by the removal of animal ovules. Nev-
ertheless, several scientific and ethical 
bodies in the UK hold the opinion that 
these cybrid embryos should be con-
sidered human embryos if their DNA 
contains human genetic material. 
This latest development has shaken 
two basic understandings tacitly ac-
cepted by the international commu-
nity for 30 years: not creating human-
animal chimeras, and not implanting 
a human embryo in the uterus of an 
animal and vice-versa.
Nanotechnologies: 
avoiding misuse
Another scientific area providing food 
for thought for ethicists is nanotech-
nologies. Miniaturised electronic im-
plants are increasingly being used 
for medical or other purposes. Along-
side their potential for diagnosis, they 
are also being used in clinical trials to

study the effects of new drugs on the 
nervous system. Treatments are also 
being perfected to re-establish com-
munication in damaged areas of the 
nervous system and to destroy can-
cerous tumours. 
We can expect a considerable 
boom in the use of these implants, 
as progress in the neurosciences 
enables us to understand how to in-
fluence behaviour, such as improving 
memory, suppressing craving in drug 
and alcohol dependency, etc. 
Applications already extend to the 
treatment of water and the conserva-
tion and conversion of energy. But, at 
the present time, there is little reliable 
knowledge about the risks of nano-
particles for the environment or hu-
man health. 
Furthermore, implants that use infor-
mation and communications technol-
ogies (ITC) could be used for individ-
ual and social control and to gather, 
store, use or transfer personal data. 
Nanotechnologies have reached a 
HUMAN DIGNITY IN QUESTION
crossroads. Few States have legis-
lated on their use, or at least, existing 
legislation has not tackled the issue 
of the manipulation of individuals by 
interfering with ITC implants, let alone 
the use of the personal data that they 
might provide.
Lessons for the future
Bioethics has been built upon respect 
for human dignity and the protection 
of human rights and basic freedoms. 
But a close examination of bioethics 
reveals that it periodically revises its 
paradigms and analyses in the light of 
the constant progress being made in 
life and medical sciences, and the re-
sulting developments in applications. 
But this approach, far from rendering 
bioethics more vulnerable, anchors it 
in contemporary scientific reality. 
Over the course of the past 20 years, 
ethical thinking has largely dealt with 
subjects that raised high hopes, an-
ticipating their technical mastery. This 
was the case for xenotransplantation, 
i.e. the transplantation of organs from 
genetically modified animals in order 
to render them compatible with hu-
man recipients. Between 1993 and 
2002, ethical reflections on this sub-
ject occupied a number of interdisci-
plinary working groups, universities 
and ethical bodies. One outcome was 
the drafting of a Recommendation on 
xenotransplantation by the Council of 
Europe, in June 2003. Interest in this 
practice, which was supposed to re-
spond to the lack of human organs 
available for transplant, gradually fad-
ed as the obstacles multiplied. These 
difficulties were scientific, as well 
as cultural and religious, given a reti-
cence or even repugnance towards 
the use of organs from some animals, 
especially pigs. But this ethical reflec-
tion may have eased the way towards 
social acceptance of the creation of 
the human-animal hybrids mentioned 
above. 
Scientific advances are changing 
the terms of an ethical dilemma. Re-
search in embryology, for example, 
and the long-term freezing of sperm 
in liquid nitrogen have enabled in vitro 
fertilization of women with the sperm 
of their deceased husbands. Even 15 
years ago, this possibility led women 
to claim this right in the courts. Judges 
in certain States of the USA are fa-
vourable to such demands, while, in 
France, they have been rejected. 
Scientific progress could also catch 
ethics specialists by surprise by open-
ing up unimagined possibilities. The 
most striking recent example was the 
cloning of Dolly the sheep, announced 
on 24 February 1997. This was like a 
bolt of lightning, making headlines 
around the globe, from Sweden to 
Brazil, the Arab Emirates to Indone-
sia. The breakthrough also unleashed 
all kinds of fantasies and speculation. 
Both the scientific community and 
politicians responded quickly, with 
the result that the international com-
munity now has a series of safeguards 
regarding this practice: The Universal 
Declaration on the Human Genome 
and Human Rights (UNESCO, 1997 
and UN, 1998), the Council of Eu-
rope’s Additional Protocol to the Con-
vention, on the Prohibition of Cloning 
Human Beings (1998), and the Unit-
ed Nations Declaration on Human 
Cloning (2005). 
These scientific shockwaves and 
their technological applications bring 
a host of benefits, shaking our certain-
ties as well as our uncertainties. But 
we must take care that the concept 
of “human dignity”, the cornerstone 
of the intangibility and inalienability of 
human rights, is not fractured.

The industrialized nations have 
allocated more than a trillion 
dollars to avert a global finan-
cial melt down. Some African 
leaders say that a fraction of 
that amount, less than two per 
cent, would have solved most 
of Africa’s problems? What’s 
your reaction to that comment? 
It is easy for the African leader-
ship to complain about the rest of 
the world for not taking care of the 
problems of Africa. I think that with 
a lot of respect, the African lead-
ership is largely to be blamed for 
the current ills of the continent. It 
is largely them who have allowed 
their resources to be exploited and 
their people to be exploited. 
It is interesting to see that the gov-
ernments in industrialized western 
countries are trying to save their 
banks and financial institutions. 
But I am unable to understand the 
fact that many of these banks were 
not regulated. So, this shows that 
if you do not regulate businesses, 
it is possible for greed, for selfish-
ness to creep in. This is what we 
see in many developing countries 
where banks and businesses from 
outside come and exploit the lo-
cal resources, without sharing the 
profits equitably and without wor-
rying about the environment. 
Why didn’t we regulate them? 
Why didn’t we control them? It is 
up to the African leadership to pro-
tect their people from exploitation. 
The African continent has lots of 
resources and wealth but the Afri-
can leadership has not adequately 
invested in our people and protect-
ed our people from exploitation.
You served as Assistant  
Minister for Environment and 
Natural Resources in Kenya’s 
ninth Parliament, from 2003 to 
2007. Were you happy with your 
contribution?
Well, I am very happy that I was 
part of the pro-democracy move-
ment that eventually brought a 
more accountable government to 
our country. We were elected with 
so much of hope from the people. 
The Kenyan people had hoped 
that we would end corruption, 
give good governance, and estab-
lish institutions that would protect 
people, that would protect farmers 
from middlemen. 
But I think our government was 
eventually dragged into corrup-
tion and mismanagement by our 
own ministers. We failed to hon-
our each other’s promises and we 
failed to honour the promises we 
made to the people, like creating 
a new constitution and sharing 
                  Proud of Africa’s progress yet sceptical about governments, Wangari Maathai from Kenya, 
                         2004 Nobel Peace Prize winner, believes that African leaders are largely responsible 
                             for the ills that plague the continent. Instead of complaining, they should better control
                                         the exploitation of African resources and populations.  
WANGARI MAATHAI : 
HOPES AND DISAPPOINTMENTS
En December 1999,  
this environmental activist,  
founder of the Green Belt Movement,  
gave an interview to our Courier correspon-
dent, Ethirajan Anbarasan from India.  
Three years later, she began her political 
career in the Kenyan government.  
Five years after that, she received  
the Nobel Peace Prize. And now, nine years 
later, she has given another interview  
to the same journalist, who is working  
in London for the BBC World Service..

power. We eventually ended up 
the way you saw in January this 
year (during the post-poll violence) 
when we lost a lot of our people. 
I have been happy with the prog-
ress, at the same time it is very dis-
appointing to see how quickly poli-
ticians can be so selfish and forget 
their commitment to the people. 
In an interview to the UNESCO 
Courier nine years ago,  
you had expressed concern 
over the lack of global attention 
towards environmental issues.  
Do you think awareness  
on environmental issues  
and global warming  
has improved now? 
No doubt, there has been a great 
improvement in the last ten years or 
so. People are realizing that envi-
ronment is indeed a source of con-
flict especially in areas like sharing 
of water resources and land. 
Now with the problem of climate 
change, we are realizing that cli-
mate is very central to our living in 
peace with each other. Yes, there 
has been a great awareness, but 
still there is a lot needs to be done. 
For example, problems relating 
to stopping green house gas 
emissions. 
Are you happy with promises 
made by industrialized nations 
in terms of carbon emission 
cuts? 
Yes, I think it is encouraging to 
see that the industrialized coun-
tries. Who have largely been re-
sponsible for greenhouse gas 
emissions are now working togeth-
er and willing to take action and 
encouraging the rest of the world 
to do the same. I am particularly 
happy that they are now talking 
about the need to preserve world’s 
forests. I sincerely hope that they 
will help those governments which 
have large amounts of forests to 
maintain, like the Amazon forests 
in Brazil, the rainforests in Congo 
and the forests in Southeast Asia. 
I hope they will include the preser-
vation of forests in their main envi-
ronmental agenda.
Did winning the Nobel Peace 
Prize encourage you to be even 
more active?
The Nobel Prize has really brought 
a lot of attention to our work focus-
ing on promoting environmental 
awareness, human rights and good 
governance in Africa. I have been 
invited by a large number of people 
who want to share the message 
and who also want me to see their 
work. So, I have been travelling 
around the world talking about the 
need to take care of the environ-
ment and about good governance. 
WANGARI MAATHAI: HOPES AND DISAPPOINTMENTS
We have not enjoyed peace or 
enjoyed good management of our 
natural resources, and therefore 
have had massive poverty and a 
lot of conflict. So, during my trav-
els around the globe I have been 
trying to explain the link between 
taking care of the environment and 
peace. 
How do see the role of women 
in politics in Africa? Are they 
finally emerging out in a male-
dominated territory? 
There has been a great improve-
ment. There has been a sustained 
campaign by women to raise 
awareness of the need for them to 
be given opportunities beyond the 
traditional roles into various pro-
fessions. We see as doctors, we 
see them as lawyers and we see 
them as teachers. Of course being 
a politician, being part of a govern-
ment with the ability to serve the 
people is such an important sym-
bolic position for women. 
There is no doubt that women like 
Ellen Johnson-Sirleaf, the presi-
dent of Liberia, have done so well 
in Africa. It was nice to see an Af-
rican woman elected as president 
of a country. It is important to rec-
ognize that we are now benefiting 
from many years of struggle by 
women in Africa. I think women 
can give more accountable and 
responsible governance and show 
respect for human rights.

A noted environmental and pro-democracy  
activist hopes the next millennium will see  
a new African leadership that puts people first.
You once said that the quality of the environment cannot be 
improved unless and until the living conditions of ordinary 
people are improved. Could you enlarge on this? 
If you want to save the environment you should protect the people first, 
because human beings are part of biological diversity. And if we can’t 
protect our own species, what’s the point of protecting tree species?
It sometimes looks as if poor people are destroying the environment. 
But they are so preoccupied with their survival that they are not con-
cerned about the long-term damage they are doing to the environment 
simply to meet their most basic needs.
So it is ironic that the poor people who depend on the environment are 
also partly responsible for its destruction. That’s why I insist that the 
living conditions of the poor must be improved if we really want to save 
our environment.
For example, in certain regions of Kenya, women walk for miles to get 
firewood from the forests, as there are no trees left nearby. When fuel 
is in short supply, women have to walk further and further to find it. Hot 
meals are served less frequently, nutrition suffers, and hunger increas-
es. If these women had enough resources they would not be depleting 
valuable forest.
What is at stake in the forests of Kenya and East Africa today?
Since the beginning of this century, there has been a clear tendency to 
cut down indigenous forests and to replace them with exotic species 
for commercial exploitation. We’ve now become more aware of what 
this involves and have realized that it was wrong to cut down indig-
enous forests, thereby destroying our rich biological diversity. But much 
damage has already been done.

When the Green Belt Movement (see box page 47) started its campaign in 
1977 to plant trees, Kenya had about 2.9 per cent of forest cover. Today the 
forested area has further dwindled to around two per cent. We are losing 
more trees than we are planting.
The other important issue is that the East African environment is very vulner-
able. We are very close to the Sahara desert, and experts have been warning 
that the desert could expand southwards like a flood if we keep on felling 
trees indiscriminately, since trees prevent soil erosion caused by rain and 
wind. By clearing remaining patches of forests we are in essence creating 
many micro-Sahara deserts. We can already see evidence of this phenom-
enon.
We hold civic education seminars for rural people, especially farmers, as part 
of campaigns to raise public awareness about environmental issues. If you 
were to ask a hundred farmers how many of them remember a spring or a 
stream that has dried up in their lifetime, almost 30 of them would raise their 
hands.
What has your Green Belt Movement (GBM) achieved  
and in particular to what extent has it prevented  
environmental degradation in Kenya?
The most notable achievement of the GBM in my view has been in raising 
environmental awareness among ordinary citizens, especially rural people. 
Different groups of people now realize that the environment is a concern for 
everybody and not simply a concern for the government. It is partly because 
of this awareness that we are now able to reach out to decision-makers in the 
government. Ordinary citizens are challenging them to protect the environ-
ment. 
Secondly, the GBM introduced the idea of environmental conservation 
through trees because trees meet many basic needs of rural communities. 
We started out by planting seven trees in a small park in Nairobi in 1977. At 
that time we had no tree nursery, no staff and no funds, only a conviction that 
ordinary country people had a role to play in solving environmental problems. 
We went on from there and now we have planted over 20 million trees all over 
Kenya.
The act of planting trees conveys a simple message. It suggests that at the 
very least you can plant a tree and improve your habitat. It increases people’s 
awareness that they can take control of their environment, which is the first 
step toward greater participation in society. Since the trees we have planted 
are visible, they are the greatest ambassadors for our movement..
Despite the Rio earth summit of 1992 and the Kyoto climate summit 
in 1997, there has been no significant progress in environmental  
protection programmes and campaigns at a global level. Why?
Unfortunately, for many world leaders development still means extensive farm-
ing of cash crops, expensive hydroelectric dams, hotels, supermarkets, and 
luxury items, which plunder human and natural resources. This is short-sighted 
and does not meet people’s basic needs–for adequate food, clean water, 
shelter, local clinics, information and freedom.
As a result of this craze for so-called development, environmental protection 
has taken a back seat. The problem is that the people who are responsible for 
much of the destruction of the environment are precisely those who should be 
providing leadership in environmental protection campaigns. But they are not 
doing so.
Also, political power now is wielded by those who have business interests 
and close links with multinational corporations (MNCs). The only aim of these 
MNCs is to make profit at the expense of the environment and people. 
We also know that many world political leaders are persuaded by MNCs not 
to pay attention to declarations made in international environmental confer-
ences. I strongly believe that as citizens we should refuse to be at the mercy 
of these corporations. Corporations can be extremely merciless, as they have 
no human face..
You started your career as an academic. Later you became an envi-
ronmentalist, and now you are called a pro-democracy activist. How 
would you describe your evolution in the last 25 years?
Few environmentalists today are worried about the welfare of bees, butterflies 
and trees alone. They know that it is not possible to keep the environment 
pure if you have a government that does not control polluting industries and 
deforestation. 
In Kenya, for example, real estate developers have been allowed to go into the

middle of indigenous forests and build expensive houses. As concerned 
individuals we should oppose that. When you start intervening at that 
level, you find yourself in direct confrontation with policy-makers and you 
start to be called an activist.
I was teaching at the University of Nairobi in the 1970s, when I felt that 
the academic rights of women professors were not being respected 
because they were women. I became an activist at the university, insisting 
that I wanted my rights as an academic.
Meanwhile, I found myself confronted by other issues that were directly 
related to my work but were not clear to me at the outset, like human 
rights. This directly led me to another area, governance. As a result I was 
drafted into the pro-democracy campaign.
I realized in the 1970s that in a young democracy like ours it was very 
easy for leaders to become dictators. As this happened they started using 
national resources as though they were their personal property. I realized 
that the constitution had given them powers to misuse official machinery.
So I became involved in the pro-democracy movement and pressed for 
constitutional reforms and political space to ensure freedom of thought 
and expression. We cannot live with a political system that kills creativity 
and produces cowardly people.
With your academic qualifications you could have lived a com-
fortable life in the U.S. or elsewhere in the West. But you decided 
to come back and settle down in Kenya. In the last 25 years, you 
have been verbally abused, threatened, beaten, put behind bars 
and on many occasions forbidden to leave the country. Have you 
ever regretted returning to Kenya and becoming an activist?
I did not deliberately decide to become an activist, but I have never regret-
ted the fact that I decided to stay here and to contribute to the develop-
ment of this country and my region. I know that I have made a little differ-
ence. 
Many people come up to me and tell me that my work has inspired them. 
This gives me great satisfaction because in the earlier days, especially 
during the dictatorship, it was difficult to speak. 
Until a few years ago, people used to come up to me in the street and 
whisper “I am with you and I am praying for you.“ They were so scared of 
being identified with me that they did not want to be heard. I know a lot of 
people were afraid of talking to me and being seen with me because they 
might be punished.
I have been a greater positive force by staying here and going through 
trials and tribulations than if I had gone to other countries. It would have 
been very different to live in the West and say my country should do this 
and that. By being here I encourage many more people.
Do you think you were subjected to virulent attacks and abuses 
because you questioned men’s decisions?
Our men think African women should be dependent and submissive, defi-
nitely not better than their husbands. There is no doubt that at first many 
people opposed me because I am a woman and resented the idea that I 
had strong opinions.
I know that at times men in positions of influence, including President 
Daniel Arap Moi, ridiculed me. At one time Members of Parliament ac-
cused me and ridiculed me for being a divorced woman. I have felt that 
deep inside they were hoping that by calling into question my woman-
hood I would be subdued. Later they realized they were wrong.
In 1989, for example, we had a big confrontation with the authorities 
when we were fighting to save Uhuru Park in Nairobi. I argued that it 
would be ridiculous to destroy this beautiful park in the centre of the city 
and replace it with a multi-storeyed complex.
Uhuru Park was the only place in Nairobi where people could spend time 
with their families outdoors. The park was a wonderful place for people to 
go because it was a place where no one bothered them.
When I launched the campaign opposing the construction of the “Park-
monster“, as the project later came to be known, I was ridiculed and ac-
cused of not understanding development. I didn’t study development but I 
do know that you need space in a city. Fortunately other non-governmen-
tal organizations and thousands of ordinary people joined our protests 
and finally the park was saved. 
The government, which wanted to destroy that park, has since declared it 
a national heritage. That’s wonderful. They could have done that without 
fighting and without ridiculing me.

29The UNESCO Courier 2008 N°10
What made you stand in the presidential elections in 1997? Despite your popularity, why didn’t you win a sizeable 
number of votes?
I decided to stand for election for several reasons. In 1992, when a multi-party system was legalized in Kenya for 
the first time, I tried very hard with other political groups to unite the opposition, but in vain. When there were many 
opposition candidates running for the presidency, I withdrew from the campaign.
As expected, the opposition lost those elections and everybody now accepts that the campaign we launched for 
them to unite was right. We wanted to form a government of national unity within the opposition in 1992. This is 
exactly what they are now clamouring for.
In the 1997 general elections, my idea was to persuade the opposition to unite and field a strong candidate from 
one ethnic community against the ruling Kenya African National Union (KANU).1 But I was called a tribalist by 
some opposition groups for proposing that idea. When all my efforts to unite the opposition failed, I decided to run 
for president.
But during the campaign I also came to realize that in this country it is very difficult to get elected without money. I 
didn’t have money. I realized that it doesn’t matter how good you are, how honest you are and how pro-democratic 
you are, if you don’t have money to give to the voter you won’t get elected. So I lost.
All this gave me a new experience. Now I can speak as an insider. I also realized that people here are not yet ready 
for democracy and we need a lot of civic education and political consciousness. People here are still controlled by 
ethnicity and vote along ethnic lines. The ethnic question became a very important issue during the last elections..
Despite having enormous natural resources Africa still lags behind other continents in terms  
of development and growth. Why is this?
Poor leadership, without any doubt. This generation of African leaders will go down in history as a very irrespon-
sible one that has brought Africa to its knees. During the past three decades, Africa has suffered from a lack of 
visionary and altruistic leaders committed to the welfare of their people.
There are historical reasons for this. Just before independence was granted to many African countries, young Afri-
cans were promoted by colonial rulers to positions until then unoccupied by the local people and were trained to 
take over power from the colonial administration.
The new black administrators and burgeoning elites enjoyed the same economic and social life-styles and privileg-
es that the imperial administrators enjoyed. The only difference between the two in terms of the objectives for the 
country was the colour of their skin.
In the process, the African leaders abandoned their people, and in order to maintain their hold on power they did 
exactly what the colonial system was doing, namely to pit one community against another. This internal conflict 
continued for decades in many African countries, draining their scarce resources.
So what we need is to improve our leadership. If we don’t there is no hope, because history teaches us that if you 
cannot protect what is your own somebody will come and take it. If our people cannot protect themselves they will 
continue to be exploited. Their resources will continue to be exploited.
It is also true that Western powers, especially the former colonial masters of this region, have continued to exploit 
Africa and have continued to work very closely with these dictators and irresponsible leaders. That is why we are 
now deep in debt, which we cannot repay.
Africa also needs assistance from international governments to improve its economic standing. For example, most 
foreign aid to Africa comes in the form of curative social welfare programmes such as famine relief, food aid, popu-
lation control programmes, refugee camps, peace-keeping forces and humanitarian missions.
At the same time, hardly any resources are available for sustainable human development programmes such as 
functional education and training, development of infrastructure, food production and promotion of entrepreneur-
ship. There are no funds for the development of cultural and social programmes which would empower people and 
release their creative energy.
I am hoping that in the new millennium a new leadership will emerge in Africa, and I hope this new leadership will 
show more concern for the people and utilize the continent’s resources to help Africans get out of poverty

Since Madagascar completed its 
separation from the mainland about 
60 million years ago, this territory 
approximately the size of France 
has developed unique flora and 
fauna. The lemur, a small primate, is 
the most typical example of Mada-
gascar’s unparalleled levels of en-
demism. 
Although there are a greater num-
ber of species in general in main-
land Africa, the island holds more 
endemic species and taxa. For 
example, you can find seven of 
the eight existing Baobab trees in 
Madagascar, and only one in all of 
Africa. Of the 101 native terrestrial 
species recorded on the island, 
nearly all are endemic. This is why 
Madagascar is considered one of 
the most significant biodiversity 
‘”hotspots” and among the top six 
of the world’s 18 mega-diversity 
countries. 
Sadly, large numbers of unusual 
animals and plants have been dis-
appearing since the arrival of man, 
only 1,500 years ago. Already one-
fifth of all known lemur species 
have gone extinct. The International 
Union for Conservation of Nature 
and Natural Resources Red List 
(2007), cites 355 species of ani-
mals and 281 of plants as threat-
ened with extinction in Madagas-
car, while much about the country’s 
biodiversity remains unknown. New 
discoveries are still being made, 
such as the two new species of 
Mouse Lemurs identified in the 
northeastern Makira region.
Multiple threats
LSpecies are endangered for a va-
riety of reasons. Habitat loss due 
to deforestation is the overarching 
threat for the majestic Madagascar 
Fish-Eagle, for instance. Economic 
pressures – people vying for food 
and other resources – are behind 
the problem, as in the case of fish 
populations being exhausted by 
over-fishing. From 1980 to 2005 
the quantity of fish caught sky-
rocketed from 53 to 8,500 tons. 
Several turtle species are critically 
endangered because of the exotic 
pet trade, and Ploughshare Tor-
toises are now down to about 600 
remaining in the wild, according 
to the British NGO Durrell. Other 
animals are the victims of cultural 
superstitions, like the harmless, 
nocturnal Aye-Aye lemur, routinely 
killed because it is considered to 
be a portent of evil. 
Climate change is an additional 
threat that looms over wildlife pop-
ulations, according to studies. One 
study (Dunham, Biological Conser-
vation) on the endangered Milne 
Edwards Sifaka lemur found that 
a 50% population decline within 
three generations was very likely, 
and that the effects of changing 
global cycles, like El Nino South-
ern Oscillations, may pose a further 
threat. Fecundity of lemurs was over 
                  Madagascar, the fourth largest island in the world, famous for its unusual biodiversity, 
    may soon be known as a modern-day example of the Tragedy of the Commons. 
                Both people and wildlife are struggling to survive as natural resources dwindle, 
                            and little time remains for the island to be salvaged from ecological disaster.

MADAGASCAR: BALANCING ACT
65% lower in El Nino years, it was 
found. Patricia Wright has done 
similar research on climate change 
impact, such as a potential decline 
in species populations from altered 
distributions of annual rainfall and 
altered ecosystems that leave the 
island vulnerable to change.
Developing solutions
For Madagascar to escape what 
scientists term the “sixth great ex-
tinction”, the Malagasy must find 
the right formula for balancing con-
servation and growth. The popula-
tion – estimated at 18 million and 
expected to double by 2025 – is 
turning to its environment for suste-
nance and profit. 
Rice paddies are taking the place 
of forests, and already this has led to 
the extinction of species, including 
the elephant bird and pygmy hippo-
potamus. ““If the same speed of cur-
rent deforestation continues, within 
the next 25 years there [will be] no 
forest left in Madagascar,” asserts 
Jonah Ratsimbazafy, a Malagasy pri-
matologist who works with the Dur-
rell Wildlife Conservation Trust. Since 
2003, however, when Madagascar’s 
President Marc Ravalomanana prom-
ised to triple the surface of protected 
areas, a decrease in the annual rate 
of forest destruction has already 
been reported (Conservation Inter-
national), from 0.8% in the 1990s to 
0.1% today. 
Many organizations such as Con-
servation International, the World 
Wildlife Fund, Durrell and Mitsinjo 
(a local NGO based in Andosibe) 
are hard at work to avert disaster, 
and are also involving local popu-
lations. Durrell, for instance, has 
signed an agreement whereby in-
habitants pledge to safeguard the 
forest in exchange for the construc-
tion of infrastructure and schools. 
While preserving natural resources 
remains a priority, NGOs are coop-
erating with the locals to include 
their needs for improving quality 
of life. Eco-tourism provides jobs 
and though not without impact on 
the environment, it can, if managed 
properly, offer sustainable econom-
ic benefits. 
Environmental issues remain a 
subject of discord, a fact taken into 
consideration by the government 
when making decisions regarding 
natural resource usage. Ranamofa-
na National Park is an example of 
a protected area seen as a triumph 
amongst conservationists, but an 
economic disaster for locals. The 
rainforest is accessible for eco-
tourism purposes only, which is 
resented by the locals as they are 
forbidden to use the park’s natural 
resources. Walking inside the park, 
one is thankful to see elusive crea-
tures like the critically endangered 
Golden Bamboo Lemur in its natu-
ral habitat. Once outside the park, 
however, one easily feels sorrow for 
the people living in dire poverty. 
To preserve Madagascar’s culture 
and natural beauty, there must be a 
development plan that takes both 
people and wildlife into consider-
ation. The people and wild places 
of Madagascar are so enchanting, 
losing them forever would be a trag-
edy. The island’s biodiversity crisis, 
moreover, should set off alarms for 
the rest of the world to maintain vig-
ilance over other ecosystems. Our 
collective survival is at stake.

36The UNESCO Courier 2008 N°10
In 1948, the American social anthro-
pologist, Ruth Benedict, published 
her article Cultural Continuity in [a] 
Civilized World, in one of the first is-
sues of the UNESCO Courier. I read 
it with mixed feelings. 
On the one hand it was disconcert-
ing to be reading a message that 
seemed so relevant today, while, 60 
years on, UNESCO seems to have 
made only quite modest progress. I 
felt a certain enthusiasm, too, for the 
rightness of her thinking, and the im-
pression that UNESCO, in its long 
career, has never really departed 
from its primary objective. 
Ruth Benedict’s observation seems 
self-evident: culture is a learning pro-
cess. “The cultural patterns which 
men in all societies invent for them-
selves and transmit down the gen-
erations have in each community a 
considerable degree of consistency 
within themselves […] and have to 
be taught anew to each generation,” 
she wrote, before adding that rec-
ognition of “cultural differences” – a 
term that, a few decades later was 
replaced by ‘cultural diversity’ – “can 
promote international co-operation” 
and cannot be blamed for “the chaos 
of the world”, as some would have us 
believe, even today. 
And, she concluded, “if we are to 
accept the different ideals and alter-
native social arrangements of the na-
tions of the world, those of us who 
are professionally concerned with 
childhood education have a task 
which extends far beyond problems 
                         1948: the American anthropologist, Ruth Benedict, emphasises the role of culture 
            in education and international cooperation. 2008: the French anthropologist, Cécile Duvelle, 
takes stock - the idea has filtered into our thinking, but is still struggling to be turned into practice.
of curriculum revision. We need the 
clear-sightedness and the tolerance 
which will help us to appreciate the 
different kinds of strengths which dif-
ferent nations could contribute to the 
world in which we desire to live.” 
Sixty years later, have we succeed-
ed in guaranteeing a quality educa-
tion for all, which respects cultural 
diversity and serves as a lever for sus-
tainable development, conceived and 
promoted by the people themselves?
Education  
as a vector for cultural 
transmission
It is widely accepted today that a 
quality education is, above all, one 
that can respond to local learning 
needs. Experts also agree that litera-
cy is most successful when acquired 
in the mother tongue. 
But in many countries – especially 
the former colonies – formal educa-
tion systems are still struggling to 
become vectors for cultural transmis-
sion at the service of social develop-
ment. Similarly, a number of “devel-
opment failures” can undoubtedly be 
explained by a failure to take account 
of the cultural dimension of develop-
ment, alongside its economic, social 
and environmental aspects. 
Even so, the critical and emancipat-
ing potential inherent in any educa-
tional process remains unchanged, 
despite what some detractors of 
“culturally adapted” education might 
think. As Ruth Benedict so rightly 
pointed out, the transmission of 
culture from generation to genera-
tion enables it continually to evolve 
and recreate itself. “No matter how 
CULTURAL DIVERSITY  
AND EDUCATION: 
WHAT HAS CHANGED SINCE 60 YEARS AGO?

sixth African Union Summit, they 
came to much the same conclusion. 
Convinced that “cultural values and 
heritages should provide the basis 
for education at all levels,” they recog-
nised “the importance of African lan-
guages as media of instruction and 
vehicles of culture,” emphasizing the 
“indisputable interface between cul-
ture and education and the role of 
both culture and education in sustain-
able socio-economic development.” 
Finally, they urged their governments 
“to create the fora for regular con-
sultations and streamlining culture in 
education and education in culture, 
in particular through the rebuilding 
of African educational systems.” This 
should be music to Ruth Benedict’s 
ears in her final resting place …
Culture: both source 
and estuary
For the first time in 2001, UNESCO 
recognized cultural diversity as the 
“common heritage of humanity”.
UNESCO’s adoption in 2003 of 
the Convention for the Safeguarding 
of the Intangible Cultural Heritage 
would also be dear to her, as it is an-
other step towards this recognition 
of the unbreakable bond between 
culture and education, and raises 
many hopes. Far from aiming to keep 
moribund cultural heritage alive as a 
museum piece, this Convention en-
ables peoples to perpetuate a heri-
tage conveying values and meaning, 
by permanently recreating it, provid-
ing them with a sense of identity and 
continuity. 
It is true that many elements of in-
tangible cultural heritage are endan-
gered today. All too often they are 
assimilated to unnecessary or ob-
solete traditions, with no part in the 
development of the nation and, within 
the processes of globalisation, they 
are of no interest to young people, 
whose attention is legitimately turned 
outwards, towards the world. It is 
clear that current educational sys-
tems must carry some of the respon-
sibility for this attitude of the younger 
generations. 
The 2003 Convention provides an 
opportunity for educational systems 
not only to open themselves to cul-
tural diversity on a national level, but 
also to discover and appreciate the 
extraordinary wealth of intangible 
cultural heritage in the world as 
a whole. It insists on “the need to 
build greater awareness, especially 
among the younger generations, of 
the importance of the intangible cul-
tural heritage and of its safeguard-
ing,” as a factor for bringing human 
beings closer together, for exchange 
and greater understanding. In other 
words, it can contribute to silencing 
the archaic but tenacious thesis of 
the clash of civilisations. 
By inviting States to raise aware-
ness of young people regarding the 
values of their cultural heritage, nota-
bly through education, it is as if this 
Convention came about to put things 
back in their place. It reminds us that 
culture is both the source and the es-
tuary of all development processes, 
with education its preferred vector of 
transmission. This reminder comes 
at the right time, and, we hope, will 
ensure that the diversity of cultures is 
not relegated to the archives of mem-
ory, but remains a living reality, full of 
meaning and creativity for the future 
of humanity as a whole.

These are “extraordinary times”. In just 
a matter of weeks, several western 
countries have pulled together multi-
billion dollar bailout packages for their 
ailing banking systems thus keeping 
the wheels of the global economy in 
motion. Without question, political 
leaders needed to act decisively and 
act now or risk catastrophic financial 
implications. 
The same determination, says the 
2009 Education for All Global Moni-
toring Report, Overcoming inequal-
ity: why governance matters, is now 
needed to tackle an equally serious 
and no less urgent development chal-
lenge – that of ensuring social justice, 
fairness and the right to educational 
opportunity for the world’s most vul-
nerable population groups. 
“When financial systems fail, the 
consequences are highly visible and 
governments act,” UNESCO’s Direc-
tor General Koïchiro Maatsura has 
commented. Yet “…when education 
systems fail the consequences are…
no less real. Unequal opportunities 
for education fuel poverty, hunger, 
and child mortality and reduce pros-
pects for economic growth.” 
The extent of global inequality in 
educational opportunity should give 
policymakers pause for thought. 
While over a third of children in rich 
countries complete university, a 
much smaller share even completes 
primary education in much of sub-Sa-
haran Africa (with just 5% reaching 
university level). One in three children 
in developing countries (193 million 
in total) reach primary school age suf-
fering from malnutrition and impaired 
cognitive growth – a figure that rises 
to over 40% in parts of South Asia. 
National disparities mirror global 
inequalities. In Peru and the Philip-
pines, children in the poorest 20% 
of the population receive 5 years 
less education than their peers from 
the wealthiest families. But wealth is 
                  Western countries have pulled together multi-billion-dollar plans to save 
                         their banking systems from catastrophe. The same determination, 
                             says the 2009 Education for All Global Monitoring Report, Overcoming
         inequality: why governance matters, is needed to tackle failing education systems.
not the only marker for marginaliza-
tion and disadvantage. Other deeply 
entrenched barriers result from geo-
graphical accessibility to schooling, 
gender, language and ethnicity. In 
Senegal, for example, children in ur-
ban areas are twice as likely to be in 
school as those living in rural areas.
The picture, of course, is not all 
bleak and this year’s Global Monitor-
ing Report highlights some impres-
sive national and regional perfor-
mances. Tanzania and Ethiopia have 
both reduced the number of children 
out of school by over 3 million. In a 
region marked by deep gender in-
equalities, Bangladesh now has as 
many girls as boys reaching second-
ary school. In Latin America, several 
countries are enrolling and keeping 
more children in schools through in-
novative cash transfer programmes 
for the poorest households, with pay-
ments made conditional on school 
attendance and health visits. Most 
remarkably, Mexico’s Oportunidades 
programme, one of the countries 
largest education schemes, is now 
being pilot tested in the New York 
City school system. 
Nevertheless, the overall figures 
speak for themselves. An estimated 
75 million children of primary school 
age world wide are currently out of 
school with partial projections sug-
gesting that at least 29 million chil-
dren will still be missing out on their 
right to an education in 2015. A fur-
ther 776 million adults, or 16% of the 
world’s population, lack even basic 
literacy skills. Two-thirds of these are 
women. 
Without concerted and sustained 
action, the international development 
target of universal primary education 
by 2015 will move even further out 
of reach.

EDUCATION: THE OTHER GLOBAL EMERGENCY
 That is why the way in which educa-
tion systems are managed, policies 
developed, and resources allocated 
is in the political spotlight. ‘Good 
governance’ has become a rallying 
call, with decentralisation, the de-
volution of authority to parents and 
schools, and choice and competi-
tion recurrent themes in policy de-
bates. 
More of the same  
will simply not do.
But according to the Global Moni-
toring Report, governance reforms 
all too often fail to tackle the in-
equalities that are holding back 
education for all.
Wide sweeping education reforms 
that give but a passing nod to lo-
cal context, institutional capacity 
requirements and equity-related is-
sues are not reaching the levels of 
impact desired. In fact the evidence 
shows that applying education blue-
prints uncritically from the north, a 
practice frequently encouraged by 
the development community, will 
not lead to long term improvements 
in areas such as education resource 
allocation, school management and 
teacher recruitment. 
A perfect example relates to re-
forms surrounding the decentraliza-
tion of national education systems 
in developing countries. In the 
1990s, such reforms undoubtedly 
brought education planning closer 
to school communities around the 
world. However at a time when 
many countries were coping with 
a massive expansion in education 
provision, financial decentralisa-
tion left different regions with even 
less resources to fund learning re-
sources, school maintenance and 
the teaching profession. And while 
central and local governments sup-
ported the idea of devolving author-
ity and decision-making to parents, 
schools and communities, especial-
ly those lacking voice in the poorest 
communities, they did not back this 
drive with measures to facilitate real 
participation. 
Neither have competition, and its 
corollary - choice, proved to be the 
antidote for the failings of public ed-
ucation systems as many expected. 
Even in the United States, where 
the private and civil society sectors 
have been contracted into the man-
agement of public school systems 
under various forms of public-pri-
vate partnership, the gains to effi-
ciency and education performance 
from the creation of charter schools, 
for example, have been uneven and 
remain inconclusive. 
In this year’s Global Monitoring 
Report, we especially take the aid 
community to task for its ‘collective 
failure’ to deliver on development 
commitments. Many country’s aid 
disbursements to basic education 
have stagnated since 2004. While 
countries such as the Netherlands 
and the United Kingdom still allo-
cate over 60% of their aid to basic 
education in low-income countries, 
France allocates only 12% of its to-
tal development assistance in this 
area and Germany just 7%. Multilat-
eral aid frameworks for supporting 
Education for All, such as the EFA 
Fast Track Initiative, are also failing 
to meet expectations. Inadequate 
donor support means that coun-
tries with approved plans will face 
an FTI shortfall of US$2.2 billion by 
2010. 
The circumstances into which 
children are born, their gender, the 
wealth of their parents, their lan-
guage or the colour of their skin 
should no longer define their edu-
cational opportunities and ending 
inequality’s ‘lottery by birth’ is per-
haps one the greatest global chal-
lenges of the 21st century. The 
challenge is one that concerns all 
nations, since in a globalized world 
poverty and suffering do not re-
main confined within borders, but 
spill over in the form of conflict for 
scarce resources, mass migration 
and environmental degradation. 
The response to the financial crisis 
demonstrates what governments 
can accomplish when faced with 
“extraordinary times“. But if they 
carry on failing to tackle deep and 
persistent inequalities in educa-
tion, targets set by the international 
community will be missed – in some 
cases by spectacular margins. 
Most importantly, millions of chil-
dren around the world will continue 
to be consigned to lives of poverty 
and diminished opportunity.

School attendance in the Arab Region has progressed over the past decade 
but nearly six million children still do not have access to education in that region 
which is still marked by strong disparities
According to the 2009 Education for All Monitoring 
Report published by UNESCO last month, low enrol-
ment remains a major problem in the region. In 2006, 
5.7 million children were out of school, i.e. 2 million fewer 
than in 1999. Nearly one quarter of them wee in Iraq and 
Yemen. 
Nonetheless, Yemen has achieved considerable progress 
regarding school enrolment which increased by 20% 
between 1999 and 2006. Similar increases have been 
achieved in Djibouti, Mauritania and Morocco. Over the 
same year, enrollment decreased significantly in Oman, 
where it dropped by 8%, and in the Palestinian Auto- 
nomous Territories with a decline of 22%. 
The progressive decline of school atendance in higher 
grades also poses a problem. In 2006, enrolment in pri-
mary education was at 84%, but only at 59% in second-
ary education (i.e. a slow progression of 7% since 1999) 
and a mere 22% at the university level. 
The greatest disparity however concerns gender. Accor- 
ding to the UNESCO Raport, the region has made 
progress towards parity in both primary and secondary 
education. But in 2006, parity had only been reached in 
the United Arab Emirates, Jordan and Qatar. In Egypt, 
on the other hand, girls account 95% of out-of-school 
children. Girls make up a regional average of 61% of out-
of-school children. 
There are also considerabel disparities in investments. 
In 2006, Tunisia, for example, devoted 7.7% of its GDP 
to education, while the figure for the United Arab Emir-
ates is of 1.6%. 
The Arab States devote a larger proportion of their 
overall public expenditure to education than other re-
gions and this has enabled them to raise school atten-
dance ratios and prolong education.

haunted me. […]” (The entire French text 
can be found at Link, July 2007). 
Mid-life crisis 
It is 1988. The Courier’s existence is 
threatened. Sandy Koffler reacts vigor-
ously. Here are extracts from his defence: 
“Before imagining radical changes to the 
content and presentation of the UNESCO 
Courier, it should be remembered that the 
periodical has been published monthly for 
40 years (January1948) and, in its cur-
rent format and appearance, for 36 years 
(1952). […] The very large number of edi-
tions published outside of headquarters 
(32) at the initiative of Member states, 
national commissions and private or com-
mercial enterprises in these countries, is 
evidence of the cultural and educational 
impact that the UNESCO Courier has 
had and continues to have throughout the 
A time when everything  
had to be invented 
”Once the war was over, the world opened 
to new ideas. A wave of sagacity shunned 
national borders, extolling the virtues of 
international cooperation and human val-
ues inspired by the Charter of the United 
Nations and affiliated organisations,” said 
René Caloz, Deputy Editor of the Courier 
from 1961 to 1977, and Editor-in-Chief 
from 1977 to 1978. Before joining UNES-
CO, he had been Paris correspondent for 
the Swiss press since 1946. 
“People of my generation, returning from 
years of disaster, gained new hope and 
reconnected with the future. As a journal-
ist and war correspondent in Italy, having 
seen the final stages of the bloody con-
flicts in Europe, I did not hesitate to file 
stories that were filled with what I saw 
emerging in Paris, London and beyond 
the Atlantic, on the avenue Kléber (note, 
UNESCO’s first Paris address), seeking 
out news and interviews with enthusias-
tic figures, like Jaime Torres Bodet, Jean 
Piaget, Frank Malina and of course, my 
American colleague, Sandy Koffler. 
With only basic resources, Sandy Koffler 
gave his utmost to shape the new pe-
riodical, and give it impetus and qual-
ity. ‘UNESCO Courier’ was the name he 
gave to this missive that adhered to the 
essential principles of the Declaration of 
Human Rights. Can there be a more in-
spiring ensign for a journalist? 
It is about 1948. Like many of my col-
leagues, I admire the Courier, its adoles-
cence, its restrained success, its promis-
ing future. And so a firm desire took root 
inside of me, to serve as a journalist like 
Koffler, to breathe a new air, far from the 
accumulation of professional routines that 
Down  
through the years
“Of all the journals published  
by the United Nations  
and its specialised institutions,  
the UNESCO Courier has always 
occupied first place for the number 
of its readers and paying subscribers, 
the range of its audience, both young 
and old, due to the high quality  
of its articles and illustrations,  
its objectivity and its international 
spirit”, wrote the America journalist, 
Sandy Koffler in 1988. He was the 
Courier’s founder and first  
Editor-in-Chief, from 1948  
to 1950 and 1951 to 1977. 
The magazine is sixty years old today. 
It has changed a great deal over  
the years and, since March 2006,  
has only been available online.  
Some of those who have left their 
mark on the magazine look back.

world. […] It is with sadness that 
I learned that the French edition 
of the UNESCO Courier (which 
has the highest circulation of 
all the magazine’s editions) has 
lost over half of its subscribers 
since 1981(55%) and that the 
editions published at headquar-
ters in Spanish and English have 
also seen their figures drop, 
albeit to a lesser extent. Quite 
frankly, I would have been sur-
prised if that were not the case. 
The UNESCO Courier is a non-
specialised magazine aimed at a 
wide readership who see it as a 
reflection of UNESCO. If the or-
ganisation goes through a crisis, 
if its reputation is tarnished by 
certain events (justified or not)) 
the repercussions will be felt 
in the attitude of readers to the 
magazine and, as a result, in the 
rate of subscriptions. […]” 
The same year, the Martinique-
born writer, Édouard Glissant 
published a voluminous Cumula-
tive Index to the magazine, which 
he had directed since 1982 and 
defined in these terms: 
“With its ear tuned to the world, the 
UNESCO Courier forges a lively and re-
markably well-informed link between the 
sensitivities of different peoples, the con-
cerns of modern society and a passion for 
knowledge. 
The magazine is careful to defend the 
ideal of justice, which is the honour of hu-
manity, in all domains of culture, education 
and science. It is also one of the rare pe-
riodicals to reveal and promote, from one 
horizon to the other, both the wealth of 
individual civilizations and the generalised 
aspiration to share knowledge.”
When a wave of freedom washed 
over the world
Two Egyptians, Bahgat Elnadi and Adel 
Rifaat, (alias Mahmoud Hussein), took 
over the direction of the Courier in Octo-
ber 1988. They left a decade later. This 
was a turbulent period, which shook the 
old two-power world, and was reflected in 
the contents of the magazine. 
“When we joined the Courier, the Cold 
War was giving way to ‘glasnost’, the fall 
of the Berlin wall, the break-up of the So-
viet Union. A wave of freedom was wash-
ing over the world, making it possible to 
speak much more freely in the pages of 
the Courier. […] 
The rationale for the Courier was chang-
ing. Until then, the magazine had been a 
rare ‘window open on the world’, a terri-
bly partitioned world, where Europe knew 
little about the people and cultures of 
Asia, Africa or Latin America, where the 
capitalist and socialist worlds turned their 
backs on one another. The Courier had 
opened the first cracks in the partitions. It 
was greeted with particular amazement in 
Eastern Europe, where it had often been 
the only non-ideological paper to circulate 
freely. The only breath of fresh air. 
With the end of the Cold War, the opening 
of frontiers between East and West, and 
between North and South, the fashion for 
TV documentaries and specialised maga-
zines such as National Geographic and 
Géo, rendered our ‘monthly window open 
on the world’ obsolete; it was time to do 
something different. 
We redesigned the magazine, attempt-
ing to present a wide sample 
of cultural sensitivities and 
personal points of view ev-
ery month, on a theme having 
universal interest. Unrivalled in 
this domain, UNESCO could 
do something original and 
powerful. 
Our predecessors had obvi-
ously also followed the idea 
of themes with universal in-
terest – resulting in some 
superb issues – but it had 
been intermittent. We felt that 
something more systematic 
was needed and, above all, 
that there should be no more 
issues devoted to a particular 
civilisation, country or national 
glory [...]” 
The universal language  
of photography 
Up until December 2001, 
the UNESCO Courier was a 
monthly, illustrated magazine, 
printed on paper and published 
in some thirty languages. An 
American, Ariane Bailey, was 
the magazine’s picture editor from 1977. 
She recalls a time when photography oc-
cupied 60% of the magazine’s pages, 
making a large contribution to its identity.
A black hand grips a fence. The hand and 
the fence are sharp, but the rest – the 
hand, the face, the person’s identity – are 
blurred. This was the cover of the Novem-
ber 1977 issue of the UNESCO Courier 
on apartheid. This photo by René Burri, 
which we found at the Magnum picture 
agency, after a day of frantic searching, 
stood out from the rest. There was abso-
lutely no doubt, this was the only image, 
out of hundreds of slides in a dozen agen-
cies that could symbolise the chaos, the 
struggle, and self-questioning of an entire 
people. 
The cover always had to capture the 
reader’s attention and plunge him or her 
into the heart of the matter: dilated pu-
pils, flaming, in a round face against a 
red background, the Manga-like work of 
a 5-year-old Chinese artist on the cover 
of “Children in Danger” (October 1991) 
is a much more powerful portrayal than 
any adult image could have been, of the 
Under the pseudonym of Mahmoud Hussein,  
Bahgat Elnadi and Adel Rifaat published a number  
of four-handed works, notably Versant sud de la liberté 
(La Découverte, 1989) and Al-Sîra  
(Grasset, vol. I, 2005 and vol. II, 2007).

terror and powerlessness felt by a child. 
This issue, which brought together psy-
chologists, educationalists, sociologists 
and other eminent “ists” would have no 
meaning without the involvement of its 
very subject-matter. 
“Window open on the World”, this 
was the sub-title of the Courier, 
which wanted to get the reader 
look at the unknown, to perceive 
the other. In this context, the ico-
nography, this form of writing with 
images, had a coherence and life 
of its own. It could give a rhythm 
to the pages, create an atmosphere, as it 
did in an issue devoted to prisons, in June 
1998, punctuated by photographs taken 
by inmates at Wandsworth Prison, in Lon-
don. This was the prison world, mostly in 
black and white: a bare light bulb burning 
in an empty cell, a ‘self portrait’ showing the 
soles of crossed feet at the end of the bed 
… On the cover was a plane, flying high 
above barbed wire. Prisoners, deprived 
of their rights and denied a voice, 
used photos to express what they 
felt. Meanwhile, even if only for a 
moment, the reader could look 
through the eyes of the prisoner 
and live in his body. The Courier 
invested in this universal language 
of photography to break down bar-
riers and reach consciences
The Courier wishes 
to thank the Association 
of former UNESCO 
staff members for the July 2007  
special issue of its magazine 
Link devoted to it. 
How can it be protected? How can we use the knowledge we obtain from these remains? 
How can it be shared with a wide audience? 
The next issue of the Courier will provide some answers to these questions, 
marking the entry into force on 2 January of UNESCO’s Convention 
on the Protection of the Underwater Cultural Heritage.
