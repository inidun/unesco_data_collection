In this issue
Since 1948, the UNESCO Courier has 
served as a platform for international 
debates on issues that concern the 
entire planet. This first issue of 2017, 
which marks the Courier’s revival after 
a five-year break, is no exception to the 
rule: experts, public figures, artists and 
journalists from around the world have 
come together to discuss topical issues.
Climate change and sustainable 
energy (p. 23), the future of cities 
and Smart Cities (p. 15), access to 
water and the state of groundwater 
(p. 19), educational policies and the 
importance they give to girls (p. 8), 
new technologies and their role in 
establishing efficient democratic 
institutions (p. 27), alliances and 
partnerships that must be forged 
to advance towards a better world
(p. 31) — these are some of the subjects 
that constitute the main dossier,  
Wide angle, of this issue dedicated to 
Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs).
UNESCO is closely associated with the 
development and implementation of 
this international road map that aims 
to achieve the seventeen objectives 
established by the UN, which is 
convinced that culture, though officially 
absent from the SDGs, is at the heart of 
sustainable development policies (p. 
12). Elyx, the jovial character created by 
Yacine Ait Kaci (YAK) and designated 
virtual ambassador of the UN, supports 
the Courier in its mission to make 
palpable the different realities around 
the world. These are illustrated by a 
number of SDGs and highlight the 
players who participate in achieving 
this agenda for everyone. These 
include the international community, 
states, civil society, local communities 
and authorities, the private sector, and 
the partnerships that these players set 
up between each other.
The Ideas section, which is dedicated 
to another highly topical issue — the 
current perception of Islam — suggests 
considering a reinterpretation of the 
Koran (p. 42) and the sharia (p. 48).  
This issue of the Courier also features a 
reference text on the Different Aspects of 
Islamic Culture. Launched in 1977, in the 
wake of a monumental work produced 
by UNESCO Publishing on general and 
regional histories, this comprehensive 
work was completed in November 2016, 
with the publication of two volumes that 
constitute an important contribution to 
the current debate on Islam.
In the Current affairs section for the 
April-June 2017 quarter, the Courier 
will celebrate the launch of the World 
Book Capital programme in Conakry 
on 23 April (p. 70) and the International 
Jazz Day, with the Cuban pianist Chucho 
Valdés (p. 58) on 30 April in Havana. 
The Courier will also participate in the 
celebration of several other international 
days such as the World Press Freedom 
Day on 3 May (p. 62), the World 
Oceans Day on 8 June (p. 65), and the 
International Day for the Elimination of 
Sexual Violence in Conflict on 19 June 
(p. 61).
This issue of the Courier also invites 
you to delve into the peculiar and 
largely unknown world of Jeju Island’s 
haenyeo, the women divers from the 
Republic of Korea. Discover, through 
the stunning images in the Zoom 
section, the exceptional destinies of 
these extraordinary women (p. 36).
We hope you enjoy reading this issue!

Since its creation in 1948, the UNESCO 
Courier has been spreading an ideal 
throughout the world: humanity united 
in its diversity around universal values 
and fundamental rights, strong in 
the wealth of its cultures, knowledge 
and accomplishments.
The UNESCO Courier is a key element 
of UNESCO’s identity as well as one 
of the most powerful tools for its 
humanistic mandate. In 1988, Sandy 
Koffler, the founder and first managing 
editor of the journal, said that: “Of 
all the journals published by the 
United Nations and its specialised 
institutions, the UNESCO Courier has 
always occupied first place for the 
number of its readers and the range 
of its audience.” Throughout all the 
continents and for seventy years, the 
Courier has embodied UNESCO’s 
mission: building peace in the minds 
of men and women by disseminating 
knowledge and cultures, the free flow 
of ideas and information by word and 
image, to help strengthen mutual 
understanding, the spirit of tolerance, 
informed debate, and peace. The 
reappearance of this historic journal in 
2017, through the generous support 
of the People’s Republic of China, is 
much more than the resumption of an 
editorial endeavour: it is a valuable 
opportunity to renew our commitment 
to the Courier’s founding values.
The publication of this issue marking 
the relaunch of the UNESCO Courier 
is particularly fitting, given that it falls 
within the 2030 Agenda for Sustainable 
Development that the United Nations 
adopted in September 2015. This new 
agenda represents a turning point 
towards a more humanistic attitude in 
global development policies, relying 
on people’s capacities to respond to 
the challenges of peace and climate 
change through education, science and 
culture, which is an underlying element 
of each of the objectives of sustainable 
development.
We are convinced that in a world full of 
limitations — in terms of our resources 
and our means — humanity can count 
on the renewable resources of its 
intelligence, creativity and ingenuity. 
This wealth, fostered by the moral 
requirement to respect the rights and 
dignity of each individual, represents 
an infinite source of progress. To 
unlock this potential, we must also 
help raise awareness of the creative 
wealth of humanity, and the Courier 
can contribute to this by circulating 
words of peace, trust and intelligence 
in response to the discourse of hatred, 
fear and rejection that currently 
spreads so easily on the internet and 
on the streets. The UNESCO Courier is 
also a powerful tool of this fundamental 
aspiration, and I call upon all UNESCO 
Member States and partners, and 
first and foremost all intellectuals, 
artists and experts, to make their 
voices heard by enriching the pages 
of this Courier, which has inspired so 
many generations of readers and will 
continue to do so for a long time.

Adopted in September 2015 by 
the United Nations, the Sustainable 
Development Goals (SDGs) represent 
the new global agenda, aimed 
at improving the lives of people 
everywhere by 2030.
 
The SDGs comprise seventeen 
ambitious, interdependent goals based 
on core concepts such as inclusion, 
integration and universality. These 
goals are beacons for governments as 
well as the private sector, civil society, 
and even individual citizens, so they 
can all participate in this common 
project that aims to eradicate poverty, 
protect the planet and guarantee 
prosperity for all.
 
As an active member of this global 
coalition, UNESCO contributes more 
specifically to the implementation 
of nine SDGs in the areas for which 
its expertise and leadership are 
recognized. Although none of the 
objectives are specifically attributed 
to culture, its role is considered a key 
factor in the implementation of the 
entire Agenda.
Against the backdrop of poverty 
eradication (SDG 1) and inequality 
reduction (SDG 10), and based on 
partnerships for SDG achievement 
(SDG 17), the Organization is notably 
in charge of coordinating the 2030 
Education agenda, aimed at fair 
and inclusive quality education and 
the promotion of lifelong learning 
opportunities for all (SDG 4).
 
Throughout all its programmes, 
UNESCO is intensifying its efforts to 
advance gender equality and empower 
women and girls (SDG 5) in terms of 
access to education, the participation of 
women in decision-making (especially 
in science), the promotion of women as 
agents of social change, and in the fight 
against violence towards women.
 
With the help of its research 
programmes on water-resource 
management and on scientific and 
technological capacity-building, the 
Organization is improving secure 
access to drinking water (SDG 6) and 
participating in the recognition of 
science, technology and innovation 
in sustainable development (SDG 9). 
It promotes better knowledge of the 
oceans, participates in strengthening 
capacities to sustainably manage 
oceans and coastlines (SDG 14); 
supports the protection and sustainable 
use of biodiversity as well as the 
management of natural resources, 
through world heritage sites and 
biosphere reserves (SDG 15). It also 
supports efforts to adapt to and 
mitigate climate change (SDG 13).
 
UNESCO actively participates in the 
creation of inclusive, safe and resilient 
cities, targeting, among other things, 
the conservation of humanity’s cultural 
and natural heritage (SDG 11). The 
Organization is also working to ensure 
public access to information, the safety 
of journalists, and the promotion of 
good governance and the rule of law 
(SDG 16).

Peng Liyuan: “The equality of 
opportunity is fundamental”
China is according the highest priority to education for all, 
whether in the framework of its national policy or its international 
development assistance. Guaranteeing gender equality — in 
access and treatment in schools, in continuing education and 
professional integration — is at the heart of the convictions held 
by Ms. Peng Liyuan, First Lady of the People’s Republic of China 
and UNESCO’s Special Envoy for the Advancement of Girls’ and 
Women’s Education, and a professor herself.
Interview by
Jasmina Šopova
Madam Professor, your action 
in favour of gender equality in 
education is universally recognized 
today. How long have you been on 
this path and what was your initial 
personal motivation?
My passion for education has a lot to 
do with my father. Back in the 1950s, 
education was woefully lacking in 
rural China. Many people, women in 
particular, were illiterate. My father 
was the headmaster of a night school 
in his village, in charge of the literacy 
programme. He devoted himself 
entirely to the job. With his help, many 
villagers learned to write their names 
and read newspapers and books for the 
first time. The best thing was that some 
mothers, after attending my father’s 
school, were able to teach their children 
to read and write. Ever since I was a 
little girl, I have been inspired by my 
father, even more so after I became a 
teacher and mother myself.
Gender inequality is deeply entrenched 
in every society. Women remain the 
vulnerable group in many places 
and account for 70% of the world’s 
population living in poverty. Nearly 
two- thirds of illiterate adults are women. 
More girls drop out of school than boys. 
Women often lack the ability to take 
their destiny into their own hands and 
have to endure many hardships in life. 
Women, more than anyone else, aspire 
for equality and respect. All these factors 
have prompted me to do what I can to 
promote girls’ and women’s education.
As UNESCO Special Envoy for the 
Advancement of Girls’ and Women’s 
Education, what is your vision of 
education aimed at reducing  
gender inequalities?
Girls’ and women’s education is a 
lofty and important cause. At the 
UNESCO Headquarters in March 
2014, I received from Director-General 
Bokova the certificate of UNESCO 
Special Envoy for the Advancement 
of Girls’ and Women’s Education. It 
was a great honour and a tremendous 
responsibility. Ensuring that women 
and men have an equal opportunity 
to realize their potential is essential to 
driving social progress, gender equality 
and sustainable development. In this 
context, education has a key role to play. 
Equality of education includes equality 
of opportunity, process and outcomes. 
Our goal is for women and men to 
have equal access to education and 
equal treatment during the process of 
education so that they will enjoy equal 
opportunity in admission to universities, 
employment and social recognition. I will 
do my level best to help realize this goal.
What is your Special Envoy 
programme? Could you give us 
some examples of what you have 
done to promote girls’ and women’s 
empowerment, and what are the 
results?
Since becoming Special Envoy in 
2014, I have visited many schools, 
youth organizations and institutions 
for women’s development in Africa 
and Asia to see the situation on the 
ground, seek ideas and strength 
from them and share experience. At 
advocacy events, I often emphasize 
the importance of female teachers and 
girls’ and women’s education. At the 
UN Global Education First Initiative 
high-level event, for instance, I called 
on all countries to attach greater 
importance to promoting equality and 
quality in education.
In China, there is a project called 
”Spring Bud” to help poor girls return 
to school. Since its launch in 1989, 
it has assisted 3.42 million girls, set 
up 1,489 schools with its donations,

provided skill training to 523,000 
girls and drafted and distributed 1.5 
million pamphlets on girls’ protection. 
As a special envoy of the project, I 
visited a summer camp for girls who 
had previously been unable to go to 
school. And it was heartening to see 
how happy and versatile the girls had 
become thanks to the help they got 
from the project.
Here’s the message I wish to send: 
equal access to education is the 
foundation for being a well-rounded 
person and living a meaningful 
life. It is a crucial factor in making 
sustainable development possible. 
I am convinced that life is full of 
possibilities for every girl and woman, 
as long as we keep our dreams alive 
and come up with the courage and 
strong will to fulfill them.
A new international prize for girls’ 
and women’s education, financed 
by the Chinese government, was 
launched in 2015. What are its 
objectives?
The UNESCO Prize for Girls’ and 
Women’s Education proposed 
and sponsored by the Chinese 
government is the first and currently 
the only prize UNESCO has 
established in this field. The aim is to 
encourage more people to be part 
of this endeavour by rewarding those 
individuals and institutions who make 
outstanding contributions to girls’ and 
women’s education. At the first awards 
ceremony in Beijing in 2016, I met 
with the laureates from Indonesia and 
Zimbabwe. They and the institutions 
they represent have done many 
concrete things to promote women’s 
education, which is truly admirable. It 
is they and many others as devoted 
and hard-working as them who have 
made our world a better place. I wish 
to pay high tribute and express deep 
appreciation to them.

and Quality of Girls' Education.

What does it mean to you to be 
a teacher?
China has a long tradition of respecting 
teachers and valuing education. Han 
Yu, a famous writer in the Tang Dynasty 
(618-907) reckoned that a teacher’s duty 
was to “pass on knowledge to students, 
teach them how to live and answer their 
questions”. For students, a good teacher 
helps them find the right path in life 
by not only imparting knowledge and 
ideas, but also inspiring wisdom and 
passion. For society, a good teacher 
sows the seed of kindness, integrity 
and peace. I believe it is important 
for a teacher to keep learning, stay 
creative and constantly improve his 
or her competence. A good teacher 
should have the ability to cultivate a 
wholesome personality and build sound 
character within the students through 
the power of virtue, culture and art. It is 
important to respect the students, be 
accommodating and understanding to 
them and teach by example, so that the 
students will learn to be kind, tolerant 
and generous, thus preparing them well 
to serve society in the future.
China has emerged as a champion of 
the Global Education First Initiative. 
Which aspects of the Chinese 
educational policy do you consider 
the most important?
In China, promoting education equality 
and ensuring equal access to education 
for all is a basic national policy. By 
adopting laws and policies as well as 
such measures as providing funding for 
students in difficulty and school feeding 
programmes, China ensures the right 
of girls and women to education. China 
has issued the National Education for All 
Action Plan (2001-2015) and monitors 
its progress in typical localities. Every 
five years, China issues separate national 
outlines for women’s and children’s 
development, setting the goal of ensuring 
equal rights for women in health, 
education and economic development 
by 2020, as well as the steps towards 
this goal. The government has made it 
clear that in all its education-related work, 
gender equality must be ensured so that 
women and girls have equal rights and 
opportunities in education and move on 
to receive higher levels of education.
China has met the MDG [Millennium 
Development Goals] on gender 
equality in education. The ability of 
Chinese women to determine their own 
fate and participate in development has 
been notably enhanced.
China has also actively expanded 
external co-operation and assistance 
in education. In 2015, at the Global 
Leaders’ Meeting on Gender Equality 
and Women’s Empowerment, 
President Xi Jinping pledged $10 
million for the implementation of the 
Beijing Declaration and its Platform 
for Action and the realization of the 
related goals in the 2030 Agenda 
for Sustainable Development. China 
has also supported other developing 
countries in eliminating illiteracy and 
promoting teachers’ training and girls’ 
and women’s education by setting up a 
fund and prizes with UNESCO.
I will fulfill my duty as Special Envoy 
and support UNESCO’s efforts to 
promote girls’ and women’s education 
worldwide. I will spare no effort in 
advancing this noble cause.

A prize for girls’ education
As a factor of economic and social 
progress, education for all is, to the 
same extent as gender equality, a 
fundamental right. Yet even if progress 
has been achieved over the last 
twenty years, it must be noted that 
girls are still too often disadvantaged 
compared to boys. Poverty, geographic 
isolation, disabilities, early marriages 
or prevailing prejudices in certain 
regions of the world remain some of 
the obstacles that still prevent girls from 
accessing education.
Created in 2015 by UNESCO’s Executive 
Board and financed by the People’s 
Republic of China, the UNESCO Prize 
for Girls’ and Women’s Education 
recognizes the innovations and 
exceptional contributions of individuals, 
institutions and organizations in this 
field. The Prize is awarded every year 
to two laureates, selected by a jury of 
international experts, who each receive 
$50,000 to further their work promoting 
girls’ and women’s education.
The Prize was awarded for the first time 
in June 2016, at a ceremony that took 
place in Beijing, to the Directorate 
of Early Childhood Education 
Development of the Ministry of 
Education and Culture of the Republic 
of Indonesia and to the Female Students 
Network Trust in Zimbabwe for their 
innovative projects.
This Prize aims to contribute to the 
achievement of the education and 
gender equality goals of the 2030 
Sustainable Development Agenda. It 
also serves to show the importance that 
China attaches to the most vulnerable 
groups and to equal opportunities for 
girls and women through laws, policies 
and international co-operation, with a 
focus on ensuring their independence 
and improving their quality of life.

Culture: at the heart of SDGs
Culture is who we are, and what shapes our identity. Placing 
culture at the heart of development policies is the only way to 
ensure a human-centred, inclusive and equitable development.
by Jyoti Hosagrahar
Within the framework of the Sustainable 
Development Goals (SDGs) adopted in 
September 2015 by the United Nations, 
the international development agenda 
refers to culture for the first time. This 
has been lauded by UNESCO as “an 
unparalleled recognition”.
The safeguarding and promotion 
of culture is an end in itself, and 
at the same time it contributes 
directly to many of the SDGs — safe 
and sustainable cities, decent work 
and economic growth, reduced 
inequalities, the environment, 
promoting gender equality and 
peaceful and inclusive societies. The 
indirect benefits of culture are accrued 
through the culturally-informed and 
effective implementations of the 
development goals.
The SDGs enshrine a conceptual 
shift in thinking about development 
beyond economic growth — 
envisioning a desirable future that 
is equitable, inclusive, peaceful, and 
environmentally sustainable. This bold 
vision demands creative approaches, 
beyond the typical linear and sectoral 
ones that most countries have been 
used to in recent decades.
Cultural heritage — both tangible and 
intangible — and creativity are resources 
that needs to be protected and 
carefully managed. They can serve both 
as drivers for achieving the SDGs as 
well as enablers, when culture-forward 
solutions can ensure the success of 
interventions to achieve the SDGs.
Inclusive cities 
Culture has a crucial role to play in SDG 
11: make cities and human settlements 
inclusive, safe, resilient and sustainable. 
Target 11.4 calls for strengthening 
efforts to protect and safeguard the 
world’s cultural and natural heritage.
UNESCO’s work has addressed this 
goal even before its formal introduction 
in 2015. From the Hangzhou 
Declaration: Placing Culture at the 
Heart of Sustainable Development 
Policies adopted in May 2013 [at the 
international congress organised by 
UNESCO in Hangzou, China] to the 
Hangzhou Outcomes adopted in 
December 2015, the emphasis on 
people-centred cities has remained firm 
and contributed to the development of 
the United Nations New Urban Agenda.
The Agenda, which provides a twenty-
year road map to guide sustainable 
urban development and aims to 
transform the world’s cities, was officially 
adopted by all countries at the Habitat 
III meeting held in Quito, Ecuador, in 
October 2016. UNESCO also launched 
its Culture: Urban Future report which 
presents a global overview of urban 
heritage safeguarding, conservation and 
management as well as the promotion 
of cultural and creative industries.
An example of this is the adaptive 
reuse of abandoned and damaged 
buildings in Nablus, Palestine, which 
has benefited local communities. The 
ancient caravanserai of Khan al-Wakala 
was transformed into a mixed-used 
public space for events and cultural 
activities. Such efforts empower local 
communities and strengthen the 
local economy. By bringing together 
diverse individuals and groups for 
the development of a project, they 
also foster social cohesion (SDG 17: 
revitalize the global partnership for 
sustainable development).
Tourism is a rapidly growing economic 
sector, both within the country or 
region and around the world. Cultural 
tourism accounts for 40 % of world 
tourism revenues. These have a direct 
positive impact on SDGs across the 
board, and especially on SDG 8: decent 
work and economic growth.
Cultural heritage that is carefully 
managed attracts tourism investment 
in a sustainable way, involving local 
communities without damaging 
heritage areas.
Culture for diversity
Creative industries and cultural 
infrastructure are valuable resources 
for generating livelihoods. This 
is especially true in developing 
countries that have a wealth of creative 
industries. Furthermore, a substantial 
percentage of those employed in 
culture sector activities are women 
(SDG 5: gender equality). 
Strengthening trade in cultural goods 
and services provides impetus for local 
and national markets, which in turn 
provides employment opportunities

for decent work (Targets 8.3 and 8.5 of 
SDG 8) and promotes local production. 
Cultural policies that promote 
preferential treatment in trade for 
locally-produced goods contribute to 
reducing inequalities within and among 
countries (SDG 10).
An illustration of this is the work of the 
Teatro Argentino de La Plata in Buenos 
Aires, which provided vocational 
training to 610 unemployed youth and 
adults on stage management and other 
performing arts skills. Funded by the 
International Fund for Cultural Diversity 
(IFCD), the project helped students to 
enhance their skills so they could find 
jobs and become entrepreneurs.
Urban areas rich in cultural heritage and 
with a vibrant creative sector are more 
attractive for businesses. Promoting 
inclusive and sustainable economic 
growth through employment in culture 
and creativity encourages decent work. 
The economies of some cities draw 
significantly on intangible heritage 
such as crafts, music, dance, visual arts, 
traditional cuisine, and theatre, that 
are often an integral aspect of historic 
urban areas.

An architect, planner and culture 
specialist, Jyoti Hosagrahar (India) is 
Director of the Division for Creativity 
in the Culture Sector at UNESCO, 
where she oversees, among other 
things, the integration of culture in 
the implementation of the UN 2030 
Agenda. Prior to joining UNESCO 
she was a professor at Columbia 
University in New York and UNESCO 
Chair professor at Srishti Institute in 
Bangalore, India.
City of music
Medellín, Colombia’s second-largest 
city and part of UNESCO’s Creative 
Cities Network, is an example of how 
music has given new momentum to 
the city, using culture, education and 
innovation. Besides strengthening 
civic culture, social equity and peace, 
especially for its youth, the city attracts 
thousands of tourists and generates 
income and employment through a 
range of music events and a popular 
music market.
Interventions for human development 
in areas such as SDG 3: health and 
well-being, and SDG 4: quality education, 
are most effective when they are 
responsive to the cultural context and the 
particularities of a place and community. 
Culture is noted specifically in Target 
4.7 (SDG 4), which calls for education to 
promote a culture of peace and non-
violence, an appreciation of cultural 
diversity, and of culture’s contribution to 
sustainable development.
Promoting respect for cultural 
diversity within a human rights-based 
approach, moreover, facilitates cultural 
understanding and peace (SDG 16: 
peace, justice, and strong institutions), 
prevents conflicts, and protects the 
rights of marginalized groups. Recent 
events have also demonstrated the 
importance of protecting culture, 
cultural diversity, and social cohesion in 
armed conflict.
Culture has an obvious correlation 
with climate action (SDG 13). Several 
traditional occupations and crafts draw 
on local knowledge of ecosystem 
management, natural resource extraction 
and local materials. As many of them 
require lower levels of technology, 
energy, and investment, they help to 
generate sustainable livelihoods and 
contribute to green economies.
Knowledge systems
In Uganda, a project to safeguard 
intangible heritage trained craft 
persons, especially the youth, in the 
ancient craft of bark-cloth making. The 
project also established the sustainable 
practice of using the indigenous and 
ubiquitous Mutuba trees, which had 
been neglected due to civil wars in 
the region. Such an effort furthered 
environment goals and ensured income 
generation, besides safeguarding the 
intangible heritage element of bark-
cloth weaving.
The knowledge systems and 
environmental management practices 
of indigenous and local people provide 
insights enabling better management 
of ecological challenges, preventing 
biodiversity loss, reducing land 
degradation, and mitigating the effects 
of climate change. Culture, particularly 
traditional knowledge, also contributes 
to resilience and recovery in the case of 
natural disasters (Target 13.1 of SDG 13).
The framework for the 2030 Agenda, 
in spite of all the references to culture, 
has not adequately recognized 
culture’s significant contribution to 
the implementation of the SDGs. The 
precise role and impact of culture on 
sustainable development needs to be 
systematically studied, measured, and 
operationalized. As the implementation 
of the SDGs moves forward, further 
work is necessary to build a systematic 
and measurable evidence base to 
demonstrate each of the contributions 
of culture to sustainable development.

Generation Afropreneurs
by Ayoko Mensah
From Dakar to Nairobi, young people are 
at the heart of a digital media revolution 
that is unfolding across the African 
continent. With start-up incubators, 
fab labs (fabrication laboratories or 
small-scale workshops), sites and cyber-
services, and new collaborative work 
spaces, an ever-increasing number of 
youth — technophiles, hyper-connected, 
educated and inventive — are fully 
embracing the new digital economy.
This new generation has been 
nicknamed “Afropreneurs”. No matter 
how diverse their activities may be, 
they share a common DNA — the digital 
world, an approach that necessarily 
interconnects the local with the global, 
and a desire to contribute to improving 
living conditions throughout Africa.
Dakar-based Karim Sy, who 
founded Jokko Labs in 2010, is 
probably the best-known of these 
young entrepreneurs. His not-for-
profit organization is defined as a 
“virtual cluster committed to social 
transformation and based on a 
community of entrepreneurs and a 
network of innovation centres”. But 
there are many other examples, like 
the startup, Agendakar (the largest 
cultural web portal in Senegal’s 
capital). Here the young entrepreneur, 
Ousseynou Khadim Bèye, who created 
a smartphone video game called Cross 
Dakar City, uses the game to alert the 
general public about the sad fate of 
talibés — boys who leave their homes 
to study in Koranic schools and are 
exploited and reduced to begging in 
the streets of Dakar.
It’s a good bet that these innovators in 
cultural and creative industries will also 
be key players in Diamniadio, Senegal’s 
first Smart City. Located just thirty 
kilometres from Dakar, it is expected to 
grow substantially in the next few years.
Start-up incubators, fab labs, digital sites and services and 
participatory workshops — Africa’s youth have dived right into the 
information age and the idea of Smart Cities. Dedicated, media-
savvy Afrocentric entrepreneurs and artists are networking, 
innovating, and using creative and cultural industries as levers 
for development.

From Smart City to  
vernacular city
Diamniadio is not the only Smart City 
on the African continent. As witnessed 
by the revolution underway, the 
development of many urban projects 
and digital centres of excellence is 
taking off in other countries as well. 
In Nigeria, Yaba, a suburb of Lagos, is 
already Africa’s best-known technology 
hub, nicknamed Yabacon Valley. 
In Kenya, Konza Technology City is 
home to 250 startups and is known as 
the African Silicon Savannah. Similar 
examples exist in Benin, where the 
government has developed the Benin 
Smart City project; in Morocco, where 
the Casablanca Smart City Cluster, 
e-Madina, has been launched, and in 
Rwanda and South Africa as well.
Although these new urban hubs 
undoubtedly open up new 
opportunities for African youth, 
they also raise some questions. In 
2010, Senamé Koffi Agboginou, the 
independent Togolese anthropologist 
and student of architecture, founded 
the African architecture platform. 
He believes that African Smart Cities 
should not try to replicate Western 
examples, but should invent their own 
models derived from local contexts. He 
is developing this idea of “anchored 
modernity” in a district of Lomé, Togo’s 
capital city, where he has opened 
Woelab, which describes itself as 
“the first African space dedicated to 
technological democracy”. Its aim is 
to make leading-edge technology 
accessible to all local people, a “fab lab 
at the level of the street”.
“We must go beyond the Smart City 
to the vernacular city of tomorrow, 
the sharing city”, says S.K. Agboginou, 
who has developed his own theory of 
“low high-tech”, making technology 
accessible to the low-income 
consumer. He proposes a kind of digital 
democracy and collective intelligence 
that would make the area’s inhabitants 
autonomous: “We are the only ones 
in Africa to bring together designers, 
developers, masons, carpenters, 
fashion designers, and even homeless 
people, in one location for shared 
projects,” he explains in an article in the 
magazine Forbes Afrique. People all 
over are talking about Woelab — as an 
incubator for startups and a place where 
training and workshops are accessible 
to everyone. The team highlighted its 
technological prowess by inventing 
W.Afate, a high-tech 3D printer made 
entirely from electronic waste!
Culture with a strong  
social orientation
The emergence of an ever-increasing 
number of digital Afropreneurs should 
not overshadow the dynamism and 
WAZIHack Togo!, a two-day event (2017) aimed at accelerating the adoption of
IoT (Internet of Things) solutions in Africa.

creativity of young artists and cultural 
players in all African cities. These artists 
are working to make their voices heard, 
attempting to make a living from their 
art, and working to improve their cities 
in spite of limited resources and difficult 
circumstances. In Brazzaville, Kinshasa, 
Lubumbashi, Douala, Segou and 
N’Djamena, there are several prototype 
projects that link an artistic approach 
with social impact.
The Ateliers Salm, founded by sculptor 
Bill Kouélany in Brazzaville, supports a 
new generation of very talented young 
artists. The Lubumbashi Biennale, which 
held its fourth event in 2015, has gained 
international attention. In Kinshasa, 
already known for its music, there are 
more and more festivals that highlight 
the city’s exceptional cultural riches.
In Dakar, in addition to the renowned 
Dak’Art Biennale of contemporary 
African art, the Afropixel festival, 
organized by the Ker Thiossane 
Association, is gaining recognition 
as a platform for projects, events, 
debates, discussion, and artistic and 
social experimentation. Ker Thiossane 
intends to explore the potential of new 
media to encourage local development 
that is inclusive and sustainable, while 
observing what may define the special 
features of an African creative city. 
Thus, in 2016, the theme of the fifth 
Afropixel festival was “Shared City”, 
a vast subject giving rise to a busy 
programme of fab lab workshops, 
artists in residence, open studios, 
exhibitions, public installations, 
screenings of video mapping, and 
numerous exchanges.
Over the last ten years, a number 
of events linked to hip-hop have 
flourished throughout the continent. 
Remarkably, this has gradually 
given rise to a whole network of 
artists, producers and festivals 
which are today helping to drive 
artistic collaboration, solidarity and 
social transformation. Rappers have 
become very involved in community 
causes and social protest movements, 
such as the musical group Y’en a 
Marre (I’m fed up) in Senegal, Le 
Balai Citoyen (the Citizen’s Broom), 
a political grassroots movement in 
Burkina Faso, and the Iyina [which 
means “we’re tired” in local Arabic] 
movement in Chad.
In May 2016, Smockey [Serge 
Bambara], the Burkinabe rapper  
and activist and co-founder of 
Le Balai Citoyen, was the first 
recipient of the prestigious Music in 
A network for creative cities
While a number of cities like Cape 
Town, Dakar, Praia, Johannesburg, 
Ouagadougou, Kinshasa and 
Brazzaville have set their sights 
on cultural and creative industries 
as a vector for sustainable local 
development, the concept of a 
Creative City is still fairly new in 
Africa. This is evident from Africa’s 
weak representation in UNESCO’s 
Creative Cities Network, initiated in 
2004. So far, only four African cities 
(Brazzaville in 2012, Dakar in 2014, 
Kinshasa and Lubumbashi in 2015) 
have joined the network, which 
comprises 116 cities in 54 countries.
Dakar has been designated by 
UNESCO as a “Creative City for 
Media Arts’’. For Dakar’s Mayor, 
Khalifa Sall, this recognition sends a 
strong signal, not only to investors 
and political decision-makers, but 
also to Dakar’s young entrepreneurs, 
who were already developing 
cultural and creative industries as 
part of the digital economy well 
before the label arrived.

The annual award — from freedom 
of expression campaigners Index on 
Censorship and the producers of  
the 2015 award-winning documentary, 
They Will Have To Kill Us First — 
recognizes people from all over the 
world who have put their art at the

Ouagadougou was destroyed by fire, 
a huge international campaign was

of how to manage the changes 
affecting cities and the role of culture 
in sustainable urban development. 
It analyses the trends, threats and 
outlooks in different regional contexts. 
The report is a valuable tool to help

Angkor water crisis
Have the Angkor Wat temple complex, and the city of Siem 
Reap, where it is based, become victims of their own success? 
The tourism boom and an increasing population have resulted 
in water shortages, forcing the authorities to tap into the 
groundwater, and dangerously lowering the water table. This 
poses a threat to the preservation of terrestrial ecosystems and is 
causing a subsidence of the soil on which the World Heritage Site 
of Outstanding Universal Value stands. UNESCO, in consultation 
with international experts and local authorities, is studying the 
possibility of pumping into the waters of the Tonlé Sap Biosphere 
Reserve, to ensure sustainable management of water resources 
and to halt the sinking of the ground on which the temples stand.
by Chamroeun Sok
Angkor, one of the world’s most 
fascinating collection of monuments 
and temple ruins, is spread over 400 
square kilometres within the UNESCO-
protected Angkor archaeological park. 
It has attracted a growing number of 
tourists since it opened up less than 
twenty-five years ago. More than four 
million visitors — 2.5 million of them 
foreign tourists — flocked to this unique 
medieval settlement last year, putting 
tremendous strain on the area’s scarce 
water resources.
The Angkor complex, which harbours 
112 villages and forests within its 
boundaries, and the burgeoning 
town of Siem Reap, a relatively recent 
development to cater to the booming 
tourism industry, are in danger of 
becoming victims of their own success.
With its international airport and an 
ever-growing population of over one 
million, besides the tourists that fuel 
its economy, the provincial capital of 
Siem Reap has morphed from a sleepy 
backwater to a bustling town in less 
than two decades. The city boasts an 
international airport, over a hundred 
hotels, restaurants, cafés, and markets 
full of shops. But the verdant lawns of 
the five-star hotels and resorts, glitzy 
new buildings and a fancy golf course 
come at a heavy price.
Heavy deforestation — the direct result of slash-and-
burn farming — is taking its toll at the Phnom Kulen 
National Park.

Dangerously low water table
Siem Reap province has a deficit of 
about 300 million cubic metres of 
water per year. To compensate for the 
unbridled development and water 
shortages, the Siem Reap Water Supply 
Authority draws about 27,900 cubic 
metres of groundwater per day for 
domestic use. Groundwater levels are 
further impacted by hotels and other 
businesses, many of whom have sunk 
thousands of illegal private wells and 
pumps across the city to meet their 
water needs. 
Land subsidence is the lowering 
or sinking of the land surface, and 
could cause incalculable damage 
to the temples that have withstood 
the vagaries of nature and war for a 
thousand years. Common causes of 
land subsidence from human activities 
include the pumping of groundwater 
underground reservoirs. The lowering 
of the land level is permanent, even 
if groundwater levels are recharged. 
Though there have been no serious 
problems with subsidence in Angkor 
yet, and no specific studies have been 
carried out on this, it could plague the 
World Heritage Site one day. 
Tourism accounts for more than 16% 
of Cambodia’s GDP, and has helped 
alleviate poverty in the last two decades 
of peace, after thirty years of strife. 
Though there have been efforts to curb 
the number of residents in the area, 
it is not feasible to restrict villagers 
from nearby communities from taking 
advantage of the tourism-related jobs 
in the Siem Reap province.
In order to address the challenge 
of providing adequate water to the 
province, while assuring the stability 
of the Angkor temples, UNESCO has 
partnered with stakeholders. These 
include ICC-Angkor (International 
Coordinating Committee for the 
Safeguarding and Development of 
the Historic Site of Angkor), a forum of 
technical experts in various fields; and 
the APSARA (Authority for the Protection 
of the Site and Management of the Siem
Reap-Angkor Region) National Authority,
which runs Angkor Park. The work of 
these stakeholders, charged with the 
sustainable development of the site, is 
beginning to yield some positive results.
Tapping into Tonlé Sap
One suggestion to alleviate the water 
problem is to pump water from the 
nearby Tonlé Sap (Great Lake). Part 
of the Tonlé Sap Biosphere Reserve, 
this is South-East Asia’s largest 
lake and one of the world’s most 
significant wetland ecosystems due 
to its unique environmental qualities 
and extraordinary biodiversity. The 
variety of fauna and flora of Tonlé 
Sap is depicted in the bas-reliefs of 
Angkor’s Bayon Temple. Many of its 
plant species are used for religious and 
medicinal purposes by Cambodians. 
Two million Cambodians also depend 
on the bounty of the lake’s freshwater 
fisheries — one of the most productive 
in the world, with an annual fish harvest 
of over 250,000 metric tons. 
It is crucial for the Cambodian 
government to weigh the environmental 
impact before it approves any project 
to pump water to Siem Reap. The 
biosphere, which is also the cradle 
of the Tonlé Sap River, has enormous 
significance for Cambodians. It acts as 
a flood mediator for the Mekong River, 
Angkor Wat attracts over four million visitors each year, a number that is expected to grow.

which flows through five other South-
East Asian countries, so its significance 
reaches far beyond Cambodia. Each 
year, during the rainy season, the 
Mekong water level rises and overflows 
into the Tonlé Sap River which, instead 
of draining the lake as it does during the 
dry season, is forced to change direction 
and flow back ‘up’ into the lake. This 
phenomenon makes the Mekong the 
only major river in the world to flow in 
two directions at different times of the 
year. This annual flood raises the lake 
level from 1 to 1.5 metres up to 8 to 10 
metres, increasing its area fivefold, as it 
spills out over the floodplain.
One of the world’s great conservation 
success stories, which includes the 
revival of several species of endangered 
birds since protection efforts started in 
1999, Tonlé Sap and its floodplain have 
been listed as the Tonlé Sap Biosphere 
Reserve under UNESCO’s Man and the 
Biosphere Programme (MAB).
The 20% year-on-year increase in 
tourism has also contributed to 
environmental pollution. Waste control 
remains an ongoing problem, though 
many of the temples are swept and 
cleaned ritually. Rubbish heaps are 
a common sight in Siem Reap, and 
tourists and locals think nothing of 
dumping garbage and waste water 
directly into the river. Residents 
living along the Siem Reap river have 
complained the water is too dirty to use 
or bathe in. They say that twelve years 
ago, the water was so clean, they could 
use it in their homes. Today, the river 
is dark and dirty, and the water stinks, 
according to residents.
While Phnom Kulen (“Mountain of 
Lychees”), twenty-five miles northeast 
of Angkor Wat, is off the beaten track 
for the hordes of tourists that descend 
upon the temples each day, the ill 
effects of deforestation have eaten 
into the lush tree cover there. Located 
upstream, water from the Kulen 
mountain is another source that flows 
through the Siem Reap river basin and 
runs into the Tonlé Sap lake. Here, illegal 
logging and the planting of cash crops 
such as cashew trees and beans have 
adversely affected hydrological patterns 
in the entire ecosystem, and impacted 
fish productivity.

UNESCO recently launched a pilot 
project: “Enhancing and Restoring 
Water Systems in Angkor World 
Heritage Site and Siem Reap City”. It 
uses the sustainability science approach 
to propose solutions and initiate a 
sustainable transformation of socio-
environmental interactions in the river 
basin. Policy, legal and institutional 
frameworks are strengthened through 
collaborative linkages, learning alliances 
and targeted interventions for capacity-
building at the pilot area, at the national, 
regional and community levels.
Real co-operation
The study includes a water campaign 
to make the residents of Siem Reap 
aware of the impact on Angkor of a 
decline in groundwater, and the effects 
of deforestation on the Tonlé Sap 
Biosphere Reserve. The sustainable 
development of water systems in Siem 
Reap province can be achieved if 
there is real co-operation between the 
government, stakeholders and residents. 
For instance, the government should 
strictly enforce the logging bans it has 
put in place on Kulen mountain.

A fall in groundwater levels due to illegal pumping could affect the stability of Angkor. © Hang-Peou/Éric Frogé
Chamreoun Sok (Republic of 
Korea and Cambodia) is a freelance 
consultant. After receiving a Ph.D. in 
Civil and Environmental Engineering 
from Inje University in 2013, he has 
worked mainly on water resources 
management and the environment. 
He was also a consultant to the 
UNESCO Office in Phnom Penh on the 
Sustainability Science pilot project in 
Siem Reap (2015-2016).
To resolve the critical issue of water 
management, exact data on basic 
information like pumping rates, 
groundwater levels, recharging rates, 
etc., should be made available and 
shared between the different local 
and national agencies involved. This 
would also enable water-resource 
planning based on future predictions. 
Groundwater pumping data should 
help the accurate prediction of 
groundwater use, and a groundwater 
level monitoring system around Angkor 
could alert all pumping stations and 
private users to stop and wait for 
groundwater recovery when critically 
low levels are reached.
Reviving old systems
People should be educated not throw 
rubbish or waste into the river. Another 
initiative could be the restoration of 
the Siem Reap river to create a tourist 
attraction and a surface water supply 
in the future. The restoration of more 
temples around Angkor could also be 
used to minimize the wear and tear of 
increased tourist traffic on the main site.
Recent research has shown that the 
ancient Khmers who built Angkor a 
thousand years ago were masters of 
water engineering. The rulers — who like 
the administrators of modern cities — 
had to protect inhabitants from floods 
in the rainy season, and provide water 
for domestic use and farming in the 
dry season, built a range of hydraulic 
structures that sustained the civilization 
for six centuries. The sophisticated 
waterworks included artificial ponds and 
canals to collect and channel rainwater, 
barays (constructed reservoirs) to store 
water for farming, moats, laterite weirs, 
bridges and dykes.
The Department of Water Management 
of the APSARA National Authority 
has conducted theoretical and 
practical work over eight years, which 
will allow them to rehabilitate the 
ancient hydraulic system of Angkor. 
For instance, the Angkor Thom and 
Angkor Wat moats which surrounded 
the temples have been restored and 
refilled after hundreds of years.

Ameenah Gurib-Fakim:
“Science is the basis of  
social progress“
To combat climate change and its consequences, which 
particularly affect Small Island States, it is necessary, more 
than ever, to encourage research and innovation, and support 
African researchers, asserts Ameenah Gurib-Fakim, President of 
Mauritius and a renowned scientist.
Interview by  
Isabelle Motchane-Brun
We are living at a time of 
unprecedented economic, 
demographic, ecological and 
technological change. In what way is 
science, technology and innovation 
the answer to these challenges?
Science, technology and innovation 
have always been the basis of social 
progress and the improvement of 
people’s living conditions.
With the explosive increase of the 
world’s population — nine billion by 
2050 — we will need to have a better 
grasp of technological tools in order 
to adapt while using fewer resources 
to ensure the world’s food security and 
self-sufficiency in water and energy 
supply, all this in an environment 
threatened by climate change.
In January 2017, you presented 
the Coalition for African Research, 
Innovation and Entrepreneurship 
(CARIE), at the World Economic 
Forum. What is its objective?
CARIE is an association that brings 
together several partners, namely the 
Bill and Melinda Gates Foundation, the 
Wellcome Trust, the New Partnership 
for Africa’s Development (NEPAD), and 
the American National Institutes of 
Health, which have decided to unite in 
a common effort to promote research 
and innovation on the African continent.
Its objective is to contribute to 
developing the skills of African 
researchers and to help strengthen 
the environment in which they operate. 
There has been enormous progress in 
Africa in the field of research but the 
impact of the work done is relatively 
limited and often not very noticeable.
What can be done to change this?
Often, researchers do not have the 
means to follow up on their ideas 
in terms of products or starting up 
businesses. Additionally, the legal 
framework for intellectual property 
rights is inadequate. Results often end 
up buried at the bottom of a drawer 
or published in newspapers and 
publicized before being protected 
by patents. The Coalition’s aim is to 
intervene at different levels so as to 
give these researchers the means to 
change the everyday lives of Africans.

The issue of “politics” affects every 
level. Obviously, if good decisions are 
taken at political levels, in other word 
by those in power, their effects on 
scientific institutions will be positive. 
Africa will only progress scientifically if 
policymakers recognize the importance 
of funding science.
The word “coalition” should not be 
analyzed by itself; rather it should 
be understood as a means of uniting 
strengths to advance science in Africa 
for the well-being of its population.
How is it different from the Alliance 
for Accelerating Excellence in 
Science in Africa (AESA), created by 
the African Academy of Sciences 
and NEPAD?
There are more similarities than 
differences. The aim of AESA is to 
work on the issue of health. It receives 
support from the Bill and Melinda Gates 
Foundation and the Wellcome Trust, 
among others.
Does the multiplicity of organizations 
with such similar objectives risk 
leading to overlaps and the dilution 
of funding?
There are no overlaps between these 
organizations given that they work
in complementarity.
You know, the need is so great in Africa 
since the continent has been lagging 
behind that there is no risk of funding 
being “diluted”. We must support all 
initiatives that aim to train resources 
and develop research.
I remind you that the continent needs 
several million engineers and scientists 
to reach the population/engineer ratio 
of developed countries.
Small Island States such as Mauritius 
are by definition vulnerable. What can 
they do to combat ecological threats?
Mauritius is already on the list of 
countries at risk, particularly in 
the context of climate change. 
Unfortunately, the number of solutions 
to counter rising sea levels is limited 
but we must consolidate and make 
better use of the territory. For example, 
the erosion of our beaches can be 
reduced by planting more mangroves. 
They provide an excellent ecosystem 
for fish and other marine wildlife. In any 
case, we must continue to plant trees 
as they are the surest way of reducing 
carbon emissions in the atmosphere. 
We must redouble our efforts in terms 
of strategies to develop renewable 
energies, recycling and water 
management because water shortages 
will be severely felt.
Mauritius ratified the Paris 
Agreement on climate change. In 
concrete terms, what measures has 
the country already taken to tackle 
the issue of global warming?
It must first of all be said that Mauritius, 
like the entire African continent, has 
not really contributed to greenhouse 
gases (GHG), but we are among the 
most affected.
We act in solidarity with the world by 
making efforts to further reduce GHG.
We have already started to develop 
our strategy in renewable energies, 
to improve water management and 
review planning and land use. But we 
must double our efforts to ensure that 
all our infrastructures meet “green” 
standards, with more solar panels for 
example, or that they comply with 
any other standard that falls within 
sustainable development.
We must encourage all technologies 
that will lead to a less wasteful use of 
resources, better possibilities in terms 
of recycling and energy-efficient, low-
power industries. These concepts are 
slowly gaining momentum; some textile 
companies in particular already operate 
using solar energy.
Education and awareness-raising 
remain two important areas because 
it is essential that the population and 
other economic actors support this 
concept, in all the initiatives the state 
wants to undertake.

How do the Mascarene Islands rank 
globally in terms of production of 
renewable energies? And what about 
Mauritius compared to its neighbours 
such as Réunion?
Among the Mascarene Islands, Réunion 
has made great progress and I believe 
it produces up to 35% of green energy. 
Rodrigues has set itself as an objective 
to depend solely on renewable energy 
in the near future. In Mauritius, we have 
already implemented several wind and 
solar parks. I think the future of this 
sector is promising and we are moving 
in the right direction.
Forbes listed you among the Top 100 
Most Influential Women in the World. 
What does this mean to you?
First of all, I would like to thank the 
magazine for this recognition. I think 
this kind of visibility is always good 
for the country. I am very happy if I 
can contribute to showing the world 
that even though Mauritius is a small 
country, it can have big ambitions!
On Twitter you said: “African women 
are at the heart of the agenda 
for the continent’s development 
but their contributions are rarely 
assessed and recognized”…
Yes, it is evident that the true value of 
women’s contribution is not always 
recognized on the African continent. 
If we look at agriculture, it is African 
women who feed the continent. But 
conditions are not always present 
to ensure their full development in 
terms of access to funds, land titles or 
training. If women could remove all 
these obstacles, we would definitely 
see considerable improvements in 
terms of food production.
This also holds true for access to 
education both in primary and tertiary 
education: too often girls are still put 
at a disadvantage. If this potential was 
fully deployed with proper guidance, 
women could really help the continent 
to overcome its current situation.
A few years ago, you wanted to 
develop phyto-drugs, drugs based 
on plants, to treat illnesses at a lower 
cost. Are you making progress?
The validation of traditional recipes 
is a project I directed when I was at 
university in the 1990s. The results of 
this research were given more value 
when I created in 2009 the Centre 
for Phytotherapy Research (CEPHYR), 
that in 2015 became the Centre 
International de Développement 
Pharmaceutique (International Centre 
for Pharmaceutical Development), CIDP

Global lessons from Estonia’s 
tech-savvy government
Tiny Estonia, with a population of 1.3 million, ranks among 
the most digitally advanced societies in the world. According 
to Freedom House, the country tucked into the north-eastern 
corner of Europe also enjoys one of the greatest economic, 
press and internet freedoms in the world. The secret of this 
tiny nation’s rise to a digital powerhouse lies in the pioneering 
advances made by its government under its innovative e-Estonia 
initiative — fostering innovative education, virtual business and 
digital citizenship.
by Mari Roonemaa
The inspiring story of how Estonia 
became E-stonia — an apt joke coined by 
former president Toomas Hendrik Ilves —
began in 1996, with the help of the 
Tiger Leap Foundation, a government-
backed technology investment body. 
Not long after its independence from 
the Soviet Union in 1991, the country 
decided that the online economy and 
massive technological innovation was 
the way forward for a tiny country with 
no natural resources to fall back on. 
Through Tiger Leap, all Estonian schools 
were online by the late 1990s, and large 
investments were made in computer 
networking and infrastructure. 
Five years later, ten private and public 
companies formed a strong public-
private partnership, creating the Look@
World Foundation. Supported by 
telecom and banking interests, the 
project raised digital awareness and 
popularized the use of the internet 
and Information and Communication 
Technologies (ICT), particularly in 
education, science and culture. 
The initiative’s very first project aimed 
to bridge the country’s “digital divide” 
by providing free computer training to 
102,697 participants, or 10% of the adult 
population. And Estonian children are 
taught computer programming starting at 
age seven. There’s been no looking back. 
In July 2016, 91.4% of Estonians used the 
internet; a big jump from 2000, when only 
28.6% of the population was connected.
Co-operation is the key
The keys to the success of Estonia’s 
e-revolution have been co-operation 
and reciprocity. Successive 
governments have backed e-Estonia 
since it was launched in the early 1990s. 
The private sector, academic institutions 
and citizens have all co-operated to 
make the initiative a winner. Reciprocity, 
because the state has gained the 
confidence of its citizens, who in turn 
have given the state full access to their 
personal data. Estonians have a digital 
identification programme that is the 
envy of much larger countries — 
they can complete just about every 
municipal or state service online in a 
matter of minutes.
To ensure transparency and 
accountability, citizens are allowed to 
monitor their own privacy. They can 
trace anyone who has tried to access 
their data by logging on to the state 
portal, eesti.ee. There have been 
a few cases — among doctors and 
policemen, for instance — where people 
have been sentenced for unethically 
accessing databases. “You cannot 
bribe a computer,” Ilves — Estonia’s 
president between 2006 and 2016, 
who spearheaded the country’s digital 
revolution — once said.

Land of Skype
Estonia has opened its borders to 
attract talent and fuel the nation’s 
start-up economy. With over 400 
startups, Tallinn, the capital, has been 
called “a sort of Silicon Valley on the 
Baltic Sea” by the New York Times. This 
is the land where Skype, the free video 
service, was created, revolutionizing 
how the world communicates. 
It is a calling card that has put Estonia 
firmly on the global map. Skype is 
also now a word in the Oxford English 
Dictionary ! Other notable startups 
include TransferWise, a foreign 
exchange service, and Jobbatical, a job 
website that allows people traveling 
the world to extend their journeys.
The tertiary, or “free sector” of Estonia 
has played an active role in shaping 
open governance and e-democracy. 
To co-ordinate public inputs for policy 
debate, three different portals have 
been created, funded by tax-payers. 
According to Secretary of State Heiki 
Loot, “Estonia is known to be the only 
country where the drafting of legislation 
and inter-ministerial co-ordination 
processes are so transparent.’’
In 2016, Estonia was recognized as 
one of countries that has best included 
NGOs in the process of consulting 
the open government plan of action. 
Last year, citizen initiative portal 
Rahvaalgatus.ee was launched, making it 
possible to compose and send collective 
initiatives to the Estonian Parliament. 
Estonia has also made some bold 
moves in experimenting with modern 
methods of the decision-making 
process. Rahvakogu or the People’s 
Assembly is a good example. Originally 
a platform of crowdsourcing ideas 
to amend electoral laws, three out of 
fifteen proposals sent to parliament 
via the online platform have actually 
become law.

Hungry for IT
How will Estonia ensure the Baltic Tiger 
keeps on leaping? Ave Lauringson, a 
leading specialist in the Information 
Society Unit, at the Ministry of Economic 
Affairs and Communications, says it’s a 
good sign that besides the government, 
the people themselves have become 
“hungry for IT”. Over the years, IT 
education has spread from schools to 
communities and hobby education. 
Recently, over 200 people — mostly 
parents themselves — were schooled 
to teach robotics as an extra-curricular 
activity. “A third of students who have 
had previous contact with IT-related 
hobbies, have admitted it has had an 
effect on their latter career decisions,” 
Lauringson says.
Eesti 2.0, a non-profit organization 
that aims to inspire young Estonians to 
embrace a future in technology (with 
Ilves as its patron), provides students with 
different technological tools and offers 
them ideas to apply these technologies.

The idea, according to the non-profit’s 
website (eesti2.ee), is “to nourish 
creative thinking across disciplines and 
connect science-based theories to real-
life phenomena and events.’’ Robotics, 
coding clubs and programming enjoy 
popularity but the question of a mutual 
relationship between young people 
and the e-state remains contentious. 
“The biggest surprise is that youngsters 
who possess different digital skills, often 
lack them in giving a digital signature, 
for example,” Lauringson notes. “They 
haven’t had such a necessity for 
different e-services, but as soon as they 
are adults, it appears. Until this remains 
a problem, they cannot enter into a 
dialogue with the e-state.”
Another big challenge is increasing 
the computer literacy of the older 
generation, with many people over 60 
struggling with elementary skills. With 
Tiger Leap, Estonian public libraries 
became centres for the internet, and 
older people still use libraries to 
access the e-state. This often turns the 
librarians into “IT specialists”, who are 
being trained to give advice.
Cap 2020
Security awareness and data protection 
continue to be important goals in the 
digital era. Public authorities have 
been raising awareness and calling 
for smart behaviour on the internet 
through different campaigns and 
actions. For instance, the Estonian 
Child Welfare Union calls for the 
prevention of online distribution of 
material on child sexual abuse. A 
number of educational programmes 
are run by The Information Technology 
Foundation for Education (HITSA), 
targeted at advancing and intensifying 
the co-operation between the ICT 
industry, educational institutions and 
the state.
The most popular of these is the 
ProgeTiger programme, initiated by 
Lauringson. This unique public-private

can use the computer, but such skills 
are not enough to bring innovation — 
we must be able to create digital and 
technological content. Though the PISA 
(Programme for International Student 
Assessment) test results flatteringly put 
us on top of the world, we shouldn’t let 
ourselves rest on our laurels. Complex 
problem- solving, critical thinking, 
creativity, people management and 
emotional intelligence will be the most 
important skills to possess in 2020. We 
also need to figure out how to keep 
our students happy, so they continue to 
enjoy the learning process.

The other side of the e-coin
Once seen as an opportunity for a 
brilliant “collective brain”, the space for 
free and anonymous expressions of 
opinion offered by news websites have 
degenerated into “toilet walls” instead. 
Online commentaries of the biggest 
news portals have become a major 
headache for news organizations. They 
have had to deal with readers who have 
inundated the public sphere with vulgar 
and insulting comments for years. Last 
year, Postimees, the country’s second-
largest news portal, decided to shut 
down its anonymous comments section.

a nationwide scheme to teach school 
kids from the ages of 7 to 19 how to 
write code. ProgeTiger combines the 
teaching of three integrated fields: 
engineering sciences, design and 
technology and information and 
communications technology. 
Getting qualified teachers remains a 
major hurdle. Professor Jaak Vilo from 
the Institute of Computer Science at 
the University of Tartu recently claimed 
that we would not be able to educate 
enough programming teachers even 
in the course of the next ten years. He 
has proposed to arrange online courses 
for high school graduates. Free online 
courses (MOOCs) exist for adults, but we 
critically need to start something similar 
for the younger generation, Vilo claims. 
So far, we don’t have enough data 
to measure digital literacy. The first 
moment of truth will be in 2018, when 
ninth graders do their first countrywide 
test on digital skills. We know people 
Questions about self-regulation of the 
media remain in the air, though. Hate 
speech in Estonia is not criminalized, 
even though such a commitment has 
been made at the European level. 
The Estonian Ministry of Justice has 
proposed an amendment to the 
Criminal Code, but this does not have 
much public support. In the public 
debate, the most usual argument is that 
this would go against the freedom  
of speech.

Innovative partnerships 
for change
A new generation of partnerships between governments,
business and civil society is the best way forward to achieving
the strategic goals of the international community. Using
dialogue and fresh thinking, this inclusive platform of
partnerships would aid current goals, and address the
challenges of the future.
by Shiraz Sidhva
When global business leaders gathered 
at the World Economic Forum in Davos 
in January 2017, the most ubiquitous 
fashion accessory at this elite jamboree 
was a circular lapel pin depicting the 
colours of the United Nations’ seventeen 
Sustainable Development Goals 
(SDGs). Far from furthering short-term 
goals like increased profits and higher 
sales figures, a group of top business 
leaders are using their positions and 
their companies to combat climate 
change, end poverty, seek education for 
all, empower women, and reduce the 
spread of diseases. 
Kept at arm’s length by development 
agencies for decades, the private 
sector was roped in by the UN in 2015 
to partner with UN agencies, national 
governments, academia and civil 
society to help advance the ambitious 
global agenda by 2030. The universal 
agreement is the most inclusive 
blueprint for sustainable development 
so far. The ultimate goal of attaining 
greater sustainability, peace and 
prosperity for all could only be 
achieved if everyone helps to move the 
agenda forward. This idea is enshrined 
in SDG 17, partnerships for the goals.
“Fantastic increase in well-being”
In his remarks at a special session on 
“Co-operation for Peace: Tackling 
the Root Causes of Global Crises” in 
Davos, UN Secretary-General António 
Guterres said that in order to achieve 
sustainable and inclusive development, 
“we need to…agree to mobilize, not 
only governments, not only civil society, 
academia, but the business sector in 
order to take advantage of these [the 
Paris Agreement on climate change 
and the 2030 Agenda for SDGs] 
agreements and to be together in 
a new form of partnership aimed at 
transforming those agreements into 
areas of action that help to prevent 
conflicts and other dramas that we face 
in today’s world.”
 
Recent calculations have shown that the 
returns of investments that could be 
generated by the full implementation of 
the SDGs could be $30 billion per year, 
Guterres said. These new partnerships 
could lead to a “fantastic increase in the 
well-being of people,” he added.
 
In her first address as the UN Deputy 
Secretary General on 28 February 2017, 
hours after she was sworn in, Amina 
Mohammed underlined that “Success 
[in achieving the SDGs] will require 
a bolder approach to financing and 
partnerships. Nothing will be achieved 
without engaging all actors,” she said, 
urging all countries to rethink their 
systems and approaches.
 
The UN too would need “to be fit for 
purpose”, she added, to be able to help 
its member states implement the 2030 
Agenda for Sustainable Development. 
“We must innovate and revamp our 
approach to partnership and financing, 
with a focus on the long haul,” 
Mohammed said.
Roping business in
Paul Polman, the CEO of Anglo-Dutch 
multinational Unilever since 2009, is 
the best example of a growing tribe 
of business heads who spend a lot of 
time and energy evangelizing about the 
need for businesses to be involved in 
solving the planet’s most challenging 
problems. Addressing his shareholders, 
he talks convincingly about climate 
change: “We have already passed 
1 degree, and Mother Nature, 
unfortunately, is increasingly starting to 
send us the bill,” he warns. 
Speaking to students at the London 
School of Economics, he enthused: “We 
could be the generation, in the next 
fifteen years, that solves the issue of 
poverty, that solves the issue of climate 
change.” The room of eager students 
falls silent with his next statement: 
“I always say I represent one of the 
biggest NGOs.”
Not the usual stuff that business leaders 
say. But Polman walks the talk. Last year, he 
was appointed by the then UN Director-
General, Ban Ki-moon, to a group of 
eminent SDGs Advocates “to build on 
their unique standing and leadership” to 
help achieve the SDGs by 2030.

The Sustainable Development Goals 
Fund, established in 2014 by the United
Nations Development Programme 
(UNDP) on behalf of the UN, facilitates 
the convergence of public and private 
institutions to achieve development 
results. Its private-sector strategy has 
two goals — to involve businesses in 
each of their programmes in the field 
from the beginning, and to create a 
global business advisory council.
Road map for alliances
The SDG Fund’s Private Sector Advisory 
Group, made up of business leaders 
from major companies from various 
industries worldwide, is helping the 
Fund “build a road map for how 
public-private alliances can provide 
large-scale solutions for achieving the 
SDGs.” Besides providing assistance in 
developing business models, the group 
contributes by engaging in dialogue 
with public and private stakeholders; 
advocacy and awareness raising; 
providing expert consultancy services, 
and collaborating with the academic 
world to provide new ideas for joint 
solutions, among other initiatives. 
Through Public-Private Partnerships 
(PPPs), responsible businesses have 
earned a place at the negotiating table. 
On the business side, organizations 
like the Geneva-based World 
Business Council for Sustainable 
Development (WBCSD), a global, 
CEO-led organization of over 200 
member companies — with $8.5 trillion 
in combined revenues and 19 million 
employees — and seventy national 
business councils, are working to deliver 
high-impact business solutions to the 
most challenging sustainability issues. 
The Council’s executive committee 
includes Polman and Ana Botín, 
executive chairman of Banco Santander, 
who is the only woman on its fifteen-
member board. 
“With an annual $5—7 trillion needed 
to finance the SDGs alone (according 
to (United Nations Environment 
Programme) UNEP)…business has 
a critical role to play as a source 
of investments and as a driver of 
technological development and 
innovation, not to mention as an engine 
for economic growth and employment,” 
notes Peter Bakker, president and CEO 
of the WBCSD. 
According to Bakker, the SDGs present 
“a daunting task for any CEO to focus 
on 17 goals and 169 targets.” 
In a bid to point business in the right 
direction, the WBCSD has collaborated 
with the UN Global Compact and the 
Global Reporting Initiative (GRI) [an 
international independent standards 
organization that helps businesses, 
governments and other organizations 
to understand and communicate their 
impacts on issues such as climate 
change, human rights and corruption] 
to develop an SDG Compass. The 
Compass provides guidance to 
businesses on the SDGs and measures 
impact. It is complemented by the 
SDG Business Hub, “a dynamic online 
platform showcasing business insights, 
emerging tools and resources in this 
space,” adds Bakker.
Unlikely allies

of capitalism has actually paid off. 
“Constructive partnerships with 
smallholder farmers have helped to 
make the company’s supply chains 
more efficient and resilient,” writes Jack 
Nelson, an investment analyst at Stewart 
Investors, in the Financial Times. 
At the first-ever Global Festival of 
Idea for Sustainability held in early 
March 2017 in Bonn, Germany, UN 
SDG Advocate Alaa Murabit, the 
Canadian physician and founder of 
Voice of Libyan Women, underlined 
the importance of partnership and 
co-operation between “unlikely allies”, 
working together to achieve the global 
goals agenda for all humankind.
While the 2030 Agenda calls for a 
new and revitalized global partnership 
approach, traditional PPPs, a contractual 
collaboration between public and 
private actors, have been promoted 
by the World Bank for more than thirty 
years, typically to fill financing gaps for 
public infrastructure projects. “There 
is a need to progress from PPP to 
“ABC”, where Administration, Business, 
and Civil society are partners on an 
equal footing,” says Louis Meuleman, 
an academic and founding member 
of Public Strategy for Sustainable 
Development (PS4SD), along with 
Ingeborg Niestroy, his wife.
“SDG partnerships should have the 
serious and operational involvement of 
civil society,” stresses Meuleman. “ABC 
partnerships would therefore require 
a reorientation of goals of all three 
parties. For administrative partners, 
the goal could be to achieve concrete 
targets in alliance with societal partners 
while achieving mutual gains, instead of 
cost-saving or downsizing government. 
For business partners, Corporate Social 
Responsibility (CSR) could become an 
integrated objective, besides creating 
added value,” he adds. 
According to Meuleman, “adding civil 
society to PPP as an afterthought is not 
enough; putting wings on a car doesn’t 
ensure that it will fly — it is still a car!”
Fresh approach needed
Critics of PPPs have warned that 
traditional PPPs will not work in the 
context of the 2030 Agenda, which 
calls for the inclusion of a fourth P, 
or “People-first” PPPs. The United 
Nations Economic Commission for 
Europe (UNECE)’s International 
PPP Centre of Excellence supports

“People-first” PPPs, which includes 
engaging with stakeholders in a 
meaningful dialogue while building 
the capacity of the public and private 
sectors to deliver such projects. 
Besides being economically viable, 
the projects should have an economic 
transformational impact. 
“PPPs are not a simple panacea or a
“silver bullet” to fill the huge financial
gap in infrastructure investment,” insists
Anis Chowdhury, an Australian [born
Bangladeshi] academic, and former
chief of multi-stakeholder engagement
and outreach, UN-DESA (Department
of Economic and Social Affairs), and

The haenyeo:
living legends of Jeju 
Text: Katerina Markelova
Photos: Hyung-sun Kim and Haenyeo Museum
The photographs are amazing. 
Women divers over 60, wearing old-
fashioned diving suits stare at the 
camera lens. These rare images do 
not fail to raise questions: “Her face 
looks like she’s going to take a deep 
breath at any moment […]. The person 
is a haenyeo,” Hyung-Sun Kim says, 
not without emotion. He has long 
observed “the drops of water [falling] 
from the surface of her [the sea 
women’s] diving suit, which is greasy 
like the skin of marine animals”.
This South Korean photographer has 
been to Jeju Island — located just off 
the southern shores of the Republic of 
Korea — several times between 2012 
and 2014, to photograph the haenyeo. 
These women dive as deep as ten 
metres underwater without oxygen 
masks to gather seafood. This particular 
form of diving is called muljil. In the 
daily lives of haenyeo, the term refers 
to seven hours of free-diving per day, 
ninety days a year, all year round.
The photographer chose to take 
these women out of their context by 
presenting them in front of a white 
canvas. Their pictures were taken as 
they emerged from the water after 
the muljil. “There is no ocean [which] 
is their workplace, [or] shoreline 
where seafood is scattered from their 
net bags. There is just a haenyeo,” 
explains Kim. Free of any disruptive 
visual elements, the spectator is able 
to concentrate on the faces and bodies 
in the photographs which, according 
to the photographer, are authentic 
“illustrated guides to haenyeo”. These 
photographic guides testify to the 
difficult living conditions of these 
women who are seen as the symbols of 
Jeju Island.
This extraordinary phenomenon — which 
emerged in a Confucian society centred 
on men — the culture of Jeju haenyeo 
was inscribed on the UNESCO List of 
Intangible Cultural Heritage in 2016. 
Its inscription contributes to improving 
the status of women in the community 
and to ecology with its environmentally-
friendly fishing methods. The community, 
organized into fishing co-operatives, 
prohibits the use of modern technologies 
to avoid overfishing. 
While they were once drawn to the sea 
because of the island’s arid volcanic 
soil which was unfit for large-scale 
agriculture, the women are now turning 
towards other sectors, such as the 
booming tourism industry. Of Jeju 
Island’s 600,000 inhabitants, only 4,500 
women still practice underwater fishing. 
There are 2,500 divers who are still truly 
active and the vast majority of these are 
over the age of 60, according to the 
New Yorker. Since the 1970s, the work of 
the haenyeo is no longer an imperative; 
it has now become a conscious choice. 
With the intention of preserving this 
rich heritage, local authorities have put 
in place a series of measures, the most 
appreciated of which are free medical 
coverage since 2002 and the free 
distribution of diving suits.
“The sea’s water surface is a border 
between life and death. Haenyeo 
frequently cross over this boundary,” 
commented art critic Park Young-taik. 
Surprisingly, the haenyeo, who are as 
modest as they are intrepid, do not 
seem to be aware of the “importance 
of their contribution to the lives of 
their families and the local economy,” 
explains Lee Sun-hwa, a member 
of the Jeju Special Self-Governing 
Province Council, to the Korea Times 
newspaper. Through their inscription 
to the list of intangible cultural 
heritage, international recognition will 
undoubtedly restore their self-esteem 
and confidence.

The Koran, between text
and context
Why are Muslims not reacting more forcefully against those 
terrorist organizations that act in the name of an Islam they do 
not subscribe to? Mahmoud Hussein answers the question by 
analysing the premise of Koranic imprescriptibility.
by Mahmoud Hussein 
The vast majority of Muslims are 
horrified by the barbaric regression that 
the Islamic State (ISIS) represents, as 
well as by its claim to speak in the name 
of Islam — an Islam most Muslims do 
not identify with. But while condemning 
ISIS on both a moral and human level, 
they have difficulty confronting it on a 
theological level. They tend to reject 
the organization as existing outside of 
Islam, asserting that the ISIS discourse 
is not Muslim, and thus they wash their 
hands of it.  
But in truth, things are much less clear-
cut, because ISIS does claim its origin in 
Islam, and refers explicitly to the Koran 
and the Hadith. To refute the group’s 
argument, one has to begin by accepting 
an obvious fact — that Islam does not 
manifest itself in one single form. In 
the past, as now under our very eyes, 
it assumes many different, divergent 
guises, some of them opposed and even 
hostile to each other. In this way, we can 
see how ISIS promotes one particular 
vision, intended not to win people over 
but to provoke terror, not to convert 
souls but to arouse our most primitive 
and murderous instincts. The group 
offers a distorted vision of the Koran
and the Hadith.
ISIS must be condemned on two levels. 
On the one hand, for the manner in 
which it picks and chooses fragments of 
the original texts, and then rearranges 
them to conform to an anti-humanist 
agenda. On the other hand, for the 
way it translates sections of these 
texts (whose scope is relevant in the 
context of seventh-century Arabia) into 
commandments it claims are absolute 
and eternal. It is by this means that ISIS 
can sanctify woman’s submission to 
man and justify the practice of slavery. 
It is how it can forever stigmatize all 
Jews and all Christians, based on 
judgements imposed on certain Jews 
and certain Christians under conditions 
of conflict and at a time that no longer 
bears any relation to our own.
Restoring free will
Why do so many secular Muslims, who 
share this negative opinion of ISIS, 
not make their objections heard loud 
and clear? Because they would have 
to admit to a radical proposition. They 
would have to accept explicitly the 
fact that the Revelation contains both 
timeless teachings and circumstantial 
prescriptions. In other words, they 
would have to question the dogma of 
Koranic imprescriptibility.
This dogma is based on what seems at 
first to be irrefutable logic: the Koran 
being the Word of God, and God 
being infallible, all the verses of the 
Koran must necessarily have eternal 
and universal scope. Hence the crisis 
of conscience that confronts so many 
Muslims today when they come up 
against verses that are understandable 
in the context of seventh-century 
Arabia, but obviously out of sync with 
today’s moral requisites.

This crisis is unfounded. The dogma can 
be repudiated without betraying the 
Koran’s core truth. Better yet, the way 
to reach the Koran’s essential truth is 
to repudiate the dogma: because the 
dogma does not derive from the Koran 
itself, but rather from an ideological 
premise tacked onto the Koran since 
the ninth century — namely that the 
Word of God is consubstantial with God 
Himself, part of His divine nature, and 
eternal as He is.
But in fact this premise contradicts 
the Koran entirely. In the Koran, God 
and his Word do not enjoy the same 
status. God transcends time, yet His 
Word is implicated in time. The Word 
intertwines the absolute and the 
relative, the universal and the particular, 
the spiritual and the temporal. This 
is why the Koran cannot be read as a 
body of commandments to be adhered 
to literally, everywhere and forever.

How could such a dogma come to be 
accepted in the Muslim world for such a 
long time, when it so clearly runs counter 
to Koranic evidence? It prevailed only 
at the end of a long struggle, which 
dates back to the ninth century, in the 
Baghdad of the Abbasids.
That period was characterized by 
various exceptionally bold currents  
of thought. The Mutazilite theologians 
argued that human free will was not 
incompatible with absolute divine 
power. God endowed humans with 
the capacity for rational judgement 
and with creative strength, called 
qudra, thanks to which they can act 
freely. The Falasifas (philosophers) 
constituted another school of 
rationalism, which set itself up 
outside theological perimeters; their 
aim was to encompass all fields of 
knowledge, in keeping with the Greek 
philosophical tradition.
But the Mutazilites and Falasifas would 
be confronted with a growing and 
ever more powerful conformist tide. As 
the guardians of tradition, jurists and 
theologians became determined, in 
their respective disciplines, to destroy 
any notion of free will by asserting 
that it challenged God’s omnipotence. 
The decisive stand-off between the 
two currents finally hinged on how 
each faction viewed the nature of the 
Koranic text.
 
For the Mutazilites, the Koran was 
’created’ by God, meaning it is distinct 
from God and came into being at a 
particular moment of His creation. 
A temporal dimension is therefore 
implied, which leaves humans some 
latitude for interpretation. For their 
adversaries, however, the Koran 
is ’uncreated’. In other words, it is 
consubstantial with God and it shares 
in His eternity. From that point, it 
becomes less important to understand 
the Koran than to be permeated by it, 
to let oneself absorb its divine nature 
by means of a literal reading, repeated 
indefinitely. And thus the text acquired 
the status of absolute, intangible 
truth from which sprang the notion of 
Koranic imprescriptibility.
The tenets of the imprescriptibility 
argument were to emerge victorious 
from this confrontation. Thus for many

centuries the idea of free will lost out 
on Islamic soil, not to appear again until 
the end of the nineteenth century.
Led by pre-eminent Muslim 
intellectuals, reformist thinking 
sought to undermine the doctrine of 
imprescriptibility, deriving inspiration 
from the spirit of the Enlightenment 
and relying on the modern disciplines 
of history, anthropology and linguistics. 
Without questioning the divine origin 
of the Revelation, the movement set 
out to examine the historicity of its 
earthly manifestation. 
As a result, it ran up against the 
doctrinal guardians who discredited 
the new thinking by branding as 
illegitimate its methodological tool — 
critical reasoning — that prevailed in 
the humanities and social sciences. 
According to the guardians of the 
dogma, asserting that the Revelation 
of the Koran corresponds to anything 
other than the eternal will of God — 
and imagining that it could be linked 
in any way to some particular historic 
context — is an aberration invented 
by non-believers. It looks at the 
divine from an external viewpoint. 
The proof, the aberrant idea is based 
on arguments drawn from profane 
disciplines alien to Islam.

In the light of  
ninth-century chronicles
The question for us now becomes: can 
we get around this objection? Can we 
show the necessary link between text 
and context, without having recourse 
to the secular sciences, but relying 
entirely on the religious texts, deemed 
indisputable by the most punctilious 
guardians of the dogma?
The answer is yes. There are 
indeed religious texts that permit 
this interpretation, and they have 
long existed. They arose out of a 
pressing need already recognized 
in the Koranic schools in the first 
century of Islam. Scholars needed to 
fathom numerous verses that were 
difficult, if not impossible, to interpret 
without examining the circumstances 
surrounding their Revelation.
They set about meeting this challenge, 
returning to the source of all available 
information concerning the time of 
the Revelation — the testimonials left 
by the Prophet’s companions. Most of 
these followers did not always grasp 
the meaning of the verses the Prophet 
recited to them. They would go alone, or 
in groups, to ask him to interpret them. 
And the Prophet would answer by 
explaining, commenting and illustrating 
the different verses. After his death, 
the task of transmitting what they had 
learned from the Prophet’s mouth to 
the growing ranks of new believers fell 
to his companions — their words now 
enriched by their own memories of when 
and where the verses had been revealed 
to them.
After the death of the Prophet’s last 
companions, people started to collect 
these testimonials and write them 
down. At the turn of the ninth century, a 
first compilation appeared entitled The 
Life of the Prophet Muhammad (Al-Sîra 
al-nabawîyya) and signed Muhammad 
Ibn Is’haq. That first compilation was 
followed by several others, notably 
those of four great chroniclers who 
worked during the Abbasid dynasty: 
al-Wâqidî, the author of Kitâb al-Maghâzî 
(The Book of History and Campaigns); 
Muhammad Ibn Sa‘d, who wrote Kitâb 
al-Tabaqât al-Kabîr (The Book of Major 
Classes, also known as The Book of 
Companions, Helpers and Followers); 
al-Tabarî (839-923), author of Kitâb al-
Rusul wal-Mulûk (History of the Prophets 
and Kings); and al-Balâdhurî, who wrote 
Kitâb Ansâb al-Ashrâf (Genealogies of 
the Nobles).
The main interest of these chronicles 
is that they tell us the story of the 
Prophet’s life, with the principal events 
following a rough timeline.
Thanks to them, we possess an 
approximate mapping of the successive 
moments of the Revelation, which 
allows us to situate hundreds of verses 
chronologically, each one relative to the 
other, and also to place each one into 
its proper context.
 
Reading the text of the Koran in light 
of these chronicles, we are struck by 
an obvious fact: nowhere in the Koran 
is it permitted to conflate God and 
His Word. At no time is it permitted to 
extrapolate the eternity of His Word 
from the eternity of God Himself. 
A reading that puts the text back 
into context leads us to draw three 
fundamental conclusions. The first: in 
the Koran, the Word of God adopts 
a language, a culture, and a way of 
thought that reflect concerns in Arabia 
in the seventh century. The second: 
in the Koran, the Word of God is not 
presented as a monologue, but rather 
as an interchange between Heaven 
and Earth. God is conversing in real 
time with the community of the first 
Muslims, through the intermediary of

the Prophet. The third: God does not 
always give His Words equal weight. 
The Koran enunciates different orders of 
truth, some absolute and others relative, 
some eternal and some circumstantial.
 
So true is this that God sometimes 
replaces certain truths with others, 
decreeing the abrogation of certain 
verses through subsequently 
revealed verses.
This was the principle of abrogation, 
formulated in the following verse: ’We 
do not abrogate a verse or cause it 
to be forgotten except that we bring 
forth [one] better than it or similar to it.’ 
(Verse II, 106). 
Thus, from that point, the concept of 
time in the Koran becomes unavoidable.
In fact, only the concept of time can 
restore the fullness of God’s power. It 
is precisely because God intervenes 
temporally that He can deliver 
relative truths, linked to different 
circumstances. And as situations 
change, relative truths change with 
them. So if God happens to say two 
contradictory things, that is because 
the truth has changed in the meantime. 
God is always right at the moment 
He speaks. To understand His relative 
truths, we just need to link each of 
them to the circumstances in which 
they were spoken.
No verse can be ’better’ than any 
other, if we remain in the realm of the 
absolute. In the absolute, everything is 
equal and no comparison is possible. 
For one verse to be ’better’ than the 
other, they must both exist in an ambit 
of relativity. And they cannot both 
be true unless they relate to different 
circumstances or, in other words, to 
changing times.
Thus there are successive moments 
in the Koran, times that are ‘before’ 
and ‘after’, and even moments that 
erase others — hence a truly temporal 
dimension. The conclusion is self-
evident: the Word of God cannot be 
confounded with God Himself. The 
Word cannot be assimilated into God’s 
divine essence. We cannot — we must 
not — read the Koran as if each one of 
the verses embodies God’s divinity, as 
if the slightest detachment represents a 
betrayal of Him.
Once the Word of God is separate from 
God, and once the Word is involved 
in human temporality, the postulation 
of Koranic imprescriptibility can no 
longer be defended. It not only fails to 
reflect the truth of the Koran, it even 
contradicts it. Believers are thus called 
upon by the Koran itself to make use 
of their reason and to exercise their 
free will, to decide for themselves 
which verses are binding, and which no 
longer concern them.
 
The Koran then ceases to appear to the 
believer like a set of commandments 
and interdictions, to be followed 
everywhere and forever. It becomes 
once again what it was during twenty-
two years for the Prophet and his 
companions: an open discourse about 
remaking the world; a call to think 
and to act in full responsibility; an 
opportunity offered to everyone to find 
God’s way in everyday life.

What sharia is not
According to the Moroccan philosopher Ali Benmakhlouf, sharia 
at its origin is not a fixed code. It is a spiritual source, with an 
ethical orientation, to curb the abuse of political power. He 
examines how sharia was transformed into law.
by Ali Benmakhlouf
The word ‘sharia’ is a recurring theme 
in today’s discussions, conveying an 
array of phantasmagorical associations: 
reigns of terror, corporal punishment, 
repudiation of women, extremist 
demands by terrorist groups, archaic 
laws from the earliest days of Islam, 
a set of sanctions incompatible with 
human rights, and more.
It is essential to understand that 
the constitution of sharia, assumed 
as a fixed authority or body of law 
transcending time and history, mainly 
serves the interests of authoritarian 
regimes. These regimes founded the 
permanence of their political power 
on a law that is immune to change.
 
Etymologically, ‘sharia’ is an Arabic 
word meaning ‘avenue’, ‘opening’ or 
‘way’. Professor Wael Hallaq at Columbia 
University explains that sharia “was as 
much a way of living and of seeing the 
world as it was a body of belief.”
The process of transforming sharia into 
divine law is derived from an effort to 
interpret it, called ijtihad. It was the
result of reflection undertaken by 
qualified Islamic jurists who set out to 
“translate” the Koranic verses into 
legal norms.
A century after the Koran was revealed, 
numerous law schools were founded 
throughout the Islamic world, and they 
had different ways of evaluating divine 
law. Yet, whatever their interpretations 
and the differences among various 
lawyers and philosophers, all the 
schools agreed that the sacred texts 
of Islam were merely sources, and not 
the actual content, of the law. They 
emphasized the fact that the divine law 
was not to be found in its complete 
form in the revealed texts. In other 
words, there is no sharia code as such. It 
is not to be found either in the sayings 
of the Prophet, or in the Koran.
In more recent times, the Egyptian 
theologian, Ali Abderrazik (1888—1966), 
has drawn our attention to the fact that 
sharia is a spiritual guide, without any 
legal directives. Therefore, it is left to 
people to constitute their own system 
— based on other foundations — to 
organize their communities.
Sharia and politics
During the Middle Ages, a great debate 
began that still has significance today. 
It involved two opposing currents of 
thought. On the one hand, there were 
those who believed that the word 
sharia should be infused with political 
meaning, giving it legislative stature. 
Judges would then become what 
Montesquieu described in his 1748 
treatise, Spirit of the Laws, as “no more 
than the mouth that pronounces the 
words of the law, mere passive beings, 
incapable of moderating either its force 
or rigour.” On the other hand, there were 
those who believed, to the contrary, 
that jurisprudence should be made 
autonomous, allowing the judge to 
draw on the religious inspiration of the 
sharia to constitute within his tribunal a 
counterweight to political power.
According to this second line
of thought, the sovereign held 
discretionary power, restricted in scope, 
which could replace religious law with 
administrative regulations applicable 
in certain areas and to specific types of 
cases. This was called siyasa shar’iyya 
(policy compliant with revealed law), a 
device that was especially useful to curb 
abusive political power, as explained by 
Hallaq in his book, An Introduction to 
Islamic Law (2009).
In pre-modern states, sharia tended to be 
disassociated from political power, even 
if the boundary was not always clear 
and differed from one state to another. 
Conversely, in modern post-colonial 
societies, sharia is considered a part 
of statutory law, even though in some 
countries its scope is often reduced to 
personal status issues (such as marriage, 
inheritance, etc.). Modern understanding 
of the law is based on codification and 
control, thus rendering it purely an 
instrument of the state. The politicizing 
of sharia is a recent phenomenon.
Fatwa changes with the times
Thus, sharia is an epistemological 
concept that was for a long time 
flexible and adaptable. The saying 
“fatwa changes with the times” clearly 
shows that legal opinion was not 
considered a timeless and immutable 
truth. Indeed, a fatwa in its original 
sense is a non-binding legal opinion. 
The law was subject to modification 
because of “the changing of the 
times or…the changing conditions of

society”, as Hallaq reminds us in his 
book Authority, Continuity and Change 
in Islamic Law (2001).
In fact, the necessity of change is 
explicitly recognized as the principal 
characteristic of divine law. The 
medieval philosopher Al Farabi (870-
950), among others, has described how 
successive legislators would modify 
the law. In his Book of Religion, Farabi 
explains that these changes served 
to: 1) close the gap left by a previous 
legislator, who enacted laws only on 
matters of the highest importance, of 
the greatest utility, value and efficacy for 
bringing communities together, leaving 
the rest to someone else; and 2) to alter 
many of the predecessor’s rulings and 
to enact other rules which he thought 
were more appropriate for the times.
We deduce from this that divine 
law is inseparable from its human 
interpretation, with the understanding 
that the interpretation should be left to 
competent experts, and not to those 
without training.
“Islamic law is thus also characterized 
by legal pluralism”, affirms Hallaq in 
his An Introduction to Islamic Law. 
“Not only because it acknowledges 
local custom and takes it into serious 
account,” he explains, “but also 
because it offers an array of opinions 
on one and the same set of facts.” 
Which is why Hallaq finds it highly 
ironic that colonial Europeans accused 
Islamic law of being rigid to justify 
replacing it with new Napoleonic 
codes. Thus began the dismantling of 
sharia that contributed to a perception 
of it as ahistorical and timeless.
When spiritual guideline
becomes diktat
This dismantling continued during the 
second half of the 20th century, as the 
word sharia took the form of a diktat via 
the fatwa, and it was accorded decision-
making power, even though fatwa 
represents only an advisory opinion.
 
With the development of modern 
law, of law emanating from the power 
of the state, and with the spread of 
parliamentary institutions in countries 
previously colonized by so-called 
Western powers (notably France and 
the United Kingdom) — sharia law 
took its place alongside legal systems 
modelled mostly on Napoleonic 
codes. It is “the corset of parliamentary 
procedure” that gave the Islamic norm 
its authority, say Baudouin Dupret and 
Leon Buskens, in the introduction to 
their 2012 book, La charia aujourd’hui 
(The Sharia Today).
Today, the constitutions of different 
Muslim nations cite sharia in different 
ways. In one country, it is a question 
of compliance; in another, reference. 
Nowhere is it considered to be derived 
from any codified law. 
It should be recognized that the word 
sharia is not sufficiently clear and does 
not refer to a set of rules familiar to all 
that would allow us to say with authority 
that it is being applied here or there. 
Paraphrasing the words of Dupret, the 
more we try to pin down what sharia is, 
the harder it is to capture its forms and 
functions. Except in terms of power, 
politics and ideology, how can we really 
define sharia?

A reference work
for our times
by Nahid Afrose Kabir
We live at a time when Muslims and 
their religion, Islam, are misunderstood 
in many parts of the world. Muslims 
are generally perceived in the West as 
a homogeneous, monolithic group of 
people who are violent and oppress 
their women. In some Asian countries, 
where Muslims and non-Muslims have 
shared the same language and culture 
for centuries, Muslims are suddenly 
viewed as “different”.
Since the September 11, 2001 Twin 
Towers attacks in the United States, 
the rhetoric of “Us” against “Them” has 
been used to exclude Muslims from 
mainstream society. Some politicians 
have been calling for a ban or an end to 
all Muslim immigration. 
It is important to acknowledge that a 
tiny minority of Muslims have resorted 
to terrorism. But it is equally important 
to note that Muslims are as much, if not 
more, the victims of terrorism as are 
non-Muslims.
Seeking to dispel some of the 
misconceptions surrounding Muslims 
today, the UNESCO six-volume v, 
The Different Aspects of Islamic 
Culture (1977 to 2016) is timely and 
informative. It informs readers about 
Islam, from its revelation to the beliefs 
and practices of Muslims. The book 
describes the diversity in Islam through 
its different schools of thought.
Launched in 1977, in the wake of a 
monumental work on general and 
regional histories, this collective work was 
completed in November 2016, with the 
publications of Volumes I and VI, which 
constitute an important contribution to 
the current debate on Islam.
The books explain the puritanical 
notions that have been generated from 
offshoots of Islam, and also describe 
how, over several centuries, many 
Muslim thinkers have rejected narrow, 
dogmatic interpretations of the Koran, 
and encouraged the use of reason.
On the question of women, the book 
offers interesting insights, notably on 
the advantaged status of women during 
the Abbasid and Ayyubid periods from 
the eighth to the thirteenth centuries. It 
also discusses the Islamic feminists from 
the early twentieth century, who had 
their voices heard in the Arab world. 
The book also reflects on the 
contribution of Islamic civilizations 
in the fields of science, medicine, 
mathematics and astronomy.

To quote just one example, Muslims 
invented algebra! The collection 
reminds readers of the glory of the 
Muslim Sultanate and how its legacy 
is still remembered through its art and 
architecture — for example, the Taj Mahal 
in India. It also discusses how the East, 
including the Islamic countries, were, 
in some periods of history, far more 
advanced than the (Christian) West, 
due to the trade of silk and spices 
through the Silk Route. However, as 
Muslim countries in Asia and Africa 
began to flourish through trade and 
commerce, the West commenced its 
territorial expansion and introduced 
its colonial system.
Reverting to the present, the book 
provides a balanced debate by 
highlighting tensions within and 
among Muslim countries — for 
example, the Iranian Revolution, the 
Iran-Iraq War, the rise of the Taliban, 
the Kashmir conflict, and the dynamics 
between secular and Islamic states. 
These conflicts are exacerbated by 
corruption, poor health services, 
economic inequality and illiteracy.
The question of minority Muslims in 
the world today — a subject which I 
have written about in the book — is 
particularly important. It is precisely 
these Muslims and their communities, 
and Muslim immigrants, who suffer 
the marginalization, Islamophobia and 
discrimination, as I emphasized at the 
beginning of this article. 
The UNESCO collection also examines 
some positive aspects of the 
relationships between Muslims and 
non-Muslims, and offers suggestions to 
help develop a better understanding 
between them.
The author of a chapter on minority 
Muslims in the world today, 
Nahid Afroz Kabir is a Muslim 
woman, originally from Bangladesh. 
She is now an Australian citizen, and 
a US Permanent Resident. Author 
of “Muslim Minorities in the World 
Today”, published in The Different 
Aspects of Islamic Culture, 2016, 
Kabir is a visiting researcher at the 
Prince Alwaleed bin Talal Center for 
Muslim-Christian Understanding at 
Georgetown University, Washington 
DC, USA. Kabir’s books include: 
Muslims in Australia: Immigration, 
Race Relations and Cultural History 
(2005); Young British Muslims: Identity, 
Culture, Politics and the Media (2010); 
Young American Muslims: Dynamics of 
Identity (2013); and Muslim Americans:

Alphadi: 
putting Africa’s creativity
on the world map
Interview by
Jasmina Šopova
You define yourself as “the most 
pan-Africanist of all pan-Africanists”. 
Where does this feeling come from?
I am a pan-Africanist by descent and 
conviction. I was born in Timbuktu, to a 
Moroccan mother and a Nigerien father 
of Arab descent. I grew up in Niger and 
I did part of my studies in Togo. I also 
have family in Morocco, Mauritania, 
and Côte d’Ivoire. All these countries 
are part of my mixed heritage that I 
hold proudly as a sign of African unity 
and dignity.
What brought you to the world 
of fashion?
I always had a creative urge, ever since 
I was a child. It is only when my parents 
passed away that I was able to express 
it. For them, it was out of the question 
for me to go into fashion! They believed 
it was a “woman’s job” and also 
incompatible with Islam.
I got a degree in tourism in Paris to 
respect their wishes. I studied by day, 
and by night I attended fashion shows. 
I ended up rubbing shoulders with 
some of the most renowned fashion 
designers of the time. Once I received 
my tourism diploma in 1980, I returned 
to Niger and worked for the Directorate 
of Tourism in the Ministry of Trade 
in Niamey.
And three years later, you presented 
your first collection in Niger…
Exactly. At the beginning, I wanted to 
set up an African textile project with 
the late Chris Seydou, a great Malian 
fashion designer. But I then found 
myself alone, so I gathered all the 
strength I had and created a weaving 
and embroidery workshop on my own. 
It was only later that I trained at the 
Atelier Chardon-Savard fashion school 
in Paris.
How did you finance the project?
At the very beginning, I invested what 
I earned working in a weaving mill in 
Niger. That is how I created the Alphadi 
fabric. Then I availed of the voluntary 
retirement support programme from 
the civil service, a support credit for 
setting up businesses, and a subsidy 
from the European Union. This enabled 
me to buy my first machines and hire 
my first employees. And that’s how the 
Alphadi brand was born.
The brand was recognized in Paris
in 1985.
It was at the International Tourism Trade 
Fair. Paco Rabanne, Yves Saint-Laurent 
and some other designers and models 
that I knew from my time studying in 
Paris, came to lend me a helping hand.
But my greatest moment will always 
be the second International Festival 
of Fashion that took place in Paris in 
1987. All the biggest names in the 
fashion industry were there. There 
were thousands of models and tens 
of thousands of spectators, and a 
billion television viewers around the 
world were watching! To present your 
collection on an open-air catwalk 
in the Trocadero gardens accompanied 
by griots [West African travelling 
poets and musicians]and camels is 
incredibly moving.
The festival served as a consecration 
of all your efforts as well as a nice 
way of recognizing the work of 
craftspeople.
Definitely. I work with very talented 
craftspeople. From the very beginning, 
I hired more than a dozen weavers 
and about twenty technicians 
specialized in sewing, embroidery 
and beadwork. Later, I created a team 
of jewellers in Niger and a team of 
tanners in Morocco.
In the 2000s, I launched a perfumery 
and cosmetics brand which used 
ingredients of African origin. And 
in 2005, I introduced a sportswear 
collection, including jeans, T-shirts, 
etc., at prices that are affordable for 
young people.
Convinced that “culture is the fundamental starting point for [...] 
development,” Alphadi is committed to supporting the textile 
industry and promoting traditional know-how throughout the 
African continent. The internationally-recognized designer, 
who created the International Festival of African Fashion, has 
become a symbol of the struggle for economic development. 
His latest dream is on the verge of coming true — creating a 
school dedicated to fashion and the arts in Niamey. We met up 
with this “Wizard of the Desert”.

I am fighting to create value for the 
African people, to offer them work, 
and to make sure their creativity is 
recognized. I manufacture my fabrics 
in different countries including Niger, 
Nigeria, Ghana, Côte d’Ivoire, Mali, 
Senegal, and Morocco and I am 
advocating for the reopening of textile 
mills in Africa.
How are you campaigning to reopen 
these mills?
To give you an example, in 2014, I went 
to the “Le pagne en fête [the Loincloth 
Festival]” fair that was organized in Togo 
to promote the recovery of the textile 
industry in the country. In Datcha, a 
village near Atakpamé, there used to be 
a factory that employed 3,000 people. It 
was shut down about fifteen years ago, 
and the workers were left jobless. The 
wax fabrics they produced have since 
been manufactured in the Netherlands. 
With all due respect, I believe that we 
are in a better position to produce 
African fabrics in Africa!
Revitalizing the African textile industry 
and enhancing traditional know-how 
have been at the heart of my project 
as a fashion designer, from the very 
beginning. All the approaches I take  
are geared towards these objectives.
How many people do you 
employ now?
Without counting the sub-contractors, 
I currently have between 150 and 200 
people working for me. In my opinion, 
a creator of fashion is also a creator of 
jobs. I have always been convinced that 
culture is the fundamental starting point 
for a country’s development.
Let me give you an example. Back when 
I started my fashion career, Niger was 
the world’s fourth-largest producer of 
uranium. I kept saying that fashion in 
Niger could be a much safer source 
of wealth than uranium, but people 
did not take me seriously. Since then, 
uranium stocks have plummeted and 
fashion has had the wind in its sails !
You have been president of the 
African Federation of Couture since it 
was founded in 1994. Can you tell us 
about your work there?
The Federation was founded in Ghana, 
and its headquarters have moved as 
political situations in African countries 
changed. I must admit that we do not 
have the means to match our ambitions, 
but I am doing everything I can to help 
develop African fashion and design 
in all its diversity. One of my main 
missions is to develop the protection of 
trademarks, particularly with the African 
Intellectual Property Organization — but 
also with the World Intellectual Property 
Organization — to encourage African 
countries to adhere to the international 
trademark system.
You created a fashion festival in the 
middle of the desert! Tell us a little 
bit about this adventure.
It is my biggest pride! The International 
Festival of African Fashion (FIMA) was 
born in the Tiguidit desert in Niger in 
1998. It is the culmination of many of my 
dreams — showcasing African creations, 
promoting young designers, enabling 
encounters, mixing cultures, cohesion, 
diversity, and peace. These are all values 
to which I attach the greatest importance.
Let’s not forget that during the first 
edition of the festival, the Touareg 
rebellion was still rampant in Niger. It 
is no coincidence that the logo of the 
festival is a stylized Touareg turban. 
I wanted to return the turban to its 
former glory, and transform it into a 
sign of peace, not war.
The 2016 edition of the festival was 
also characterized by peace.
Yes, our slogan was “Building a 
mixed and peaceful Africa” and we 
paid tribute to Nelson Mandela, an 
emblematic figure of peace. I presented 
a collection of haute couture all in white 
and organized a parade in the streets 
where everybody was dressed in white. 
That was also a very emotional moment!

Peace, culture and development are 
the keywords of each edition of FIMA. 
Every two years, the festival brings 
together designers from all over the 
African continent, as well as guests 
from Europe, the Americas and Asia. As 
much as it celebrates Africa, it dedicates 
the last day to bringing together the 
whole world on the same stage.
In December 2016, we organized the 
10th edition of FIMA in collaboration 
with the Chamber of Crafts and Trades 
of Niger in the traditional wrestling 
arena of Agadez, in the north of Niger. 
The theme was “Education and the

industry for a mixed and peaceful 
Africa”. I was particularly delighted that 
the event took place, since we had 
to cancel the festival scheduled for 
November 2015, because of the 
events that rocked the world and 
West Africa in particular. Since it is 
impossible to eliminate risk entirely, 
we felt that we were not in a position 
to ensure the security of the public 
and the participants.
Assoumana Malam Issa, Niger’s Minister 
of Cultural Renaissance, the Arts and 
Social Modernization, chaired the 
launch ceremony of the 10th edition. 
He announced that he would support 
FIMA in its mission to make the 
fashion and haute couture industry a 
permanent tool for development. 
Now that the festival has been qualified 
as a key cultural event in Niger, we will 
be able to organize it every year.

Do you have other projects aimed 
at promoting young designers
in Africa?
My big project at the moment is 
to create an international school 
dedicated to fashion and the arts in 
Niamey. I have been dreaming about 
this for ten years, and two years ago 
I was given the land for this. The 
government of Niger has provided us 
with 3,000 square metres. I am now 
waiting for other sources of funding to 
make this dream a reality.
The construction plans are ready. We 
are hoping to build a factory workshop 
that will welcome some thirty designers 
from Niger and abroad. They will 
be able to create their collections 
there, and, if necessary, make and sell 
their designs. We also plan to offer 
accommodation to designers and 
teachers from abroad and to create 
boutiques, a fashion museum equipped 
with a fabric library, and rooms that can 
be used for fashion shows.
The concept is partly inspired by 42, 
the [private, nonprofit and tuition-
free computer-programming] school 
created by Xavier Niel, the founder 
of Free[the French internet service 
provider]. His priority is talent and 
teamwork. The Atelier Chardon-
Savard in Paris is also helping us 
with this project.
Do young African designers find their 
place at the festival?
Actually, they have a privileged place at 
the festival! Every two years, since 2003, 
we have been organizing a competition 
for young stylists in collaboration with 
the Association Française d’Action 
Artistique and since 2010 we have been 
organizing it with the Institut français.
We receive between 250 and 300 
applications for the competition. An 
international jury comes together at the 
Museum of Decorative Arts in Paris to 
choose three winners. For the past five 
years, the prizes have been financed 
by the West African Economic and 
Monetary Fund.
We also have a prize for African models, 
which increases their chances of 
becoming top models.
Can you tell us a little about the 
“Alphadi caravans”?
The idea came from my nomadic spirit. 
After each edition of FIMA, a team of 
about forty people (designers, models, 
fashion specialists, sponsors, journalists) 
sets off across Africa to organize 
Alphadi shows. This enables us to 
meet talented young artists in different 
regions, who will then be selected by 
our jury to showcase their collections at 
the next edition of the Festival.

We will build the school with the 
help of donors, but it will have to 
function independently. This is why 
modest tuition fees will be charged. 
The Alphadi Foundation will grant 
scholarships, and the students will be 
able to partially cover their costs by 
selling their designs in the school’s 
boutiques. The school will also include 
a “cultural nursery” that will offer six- to 
eight-month training grants to really 
young pupils aged 9 or 10, to teach 
them artistic creation and fashion.
What is the role of the
Alphadi Foundation?
I first created the Alphadi association 
in 2000. It is closely linked to FIMA 
and is particularly active in the field 
of education, though it is not limited 
to that. To give you an example, I 
organized several telethons, including 
one in 2012, for Malian refugees and 
it was a great success. We worked in 
collaboration with the United Nations 
High Commissioner for Refugees 
(UNHCR) to raise about €52,000 and 
nearly eighty tons of cereal.
Alphadi, whose full name is 
Sidahmed Alphadi Seidnaly and who 
has earned the sobriquet, “Wizard of 
the Desert”, was born on 1 June 1957 
in Timbuktu, Mali, into a family of 
tradesmen. He grew up in Niger with 
eight siblings. He is himself a father 
of six and divides his life between the 
United States, France and Africa.
Alphadi was designated UNESCO 
Artist for Peace on 25 January 2016. 
The same year, on 23 April, he joined 
the UNESCO Coalition of Artists for the 
General History of Africa.
I am currently creating the Alphadi 
Heritage Foundation (the by-laws of 
the foundation are ready). This will 
focus on training women and girls, 
and will be engaged in issues such as 
health and malnutrition.
I often jokingly say that I trust women 
more than I trust men. A woman who 
earns a living, feeds and looks after 
her children; a man usually uses the 
money... to buy himself a second wife!

Chucho Valdés on the piano: 
“I explore every path there is!”
Interview by
Lucía Iglesias Kuntz 
Having participated in last year’s 
International Jazz Day, what 
memories do you have of the event?
It was incredible. It was the first time 
I went to the White House. I never 
thought I would ever have such an 
opportunity! The most amazing part 
is that, as jazz musicians, we form a 
sort of international family. Nearly 
each of us has had the opportunity 
to participate in the same festivals 
around the world but this time, it felt 
like a family reunion, and on a musical 
level, we all got along incredibly well. 
I played with a US bassist and an 
African guitarist, the trumpet player was 
Australian, and the percussionist Indian. 
It was an unforgettable experience, 
especially since Chick Corea, Aretha 
Franklin, Herbie Hancock, Al Jarreau, 
Marcus Miller and other big jazz artists 
were present too. It’s not something 
you see every day! We proved that 
jazz is so international that musicians 
from different parts of the world can 
come together to play music. It was 
an unprecedented moment, as if 
the parents of jazz came together to 
embrace its glorious universality.
You will be participating in this year’s 
celebration of the International Jazz 
Day which will take place in Havana. 
Are you expecting something 
in particular?
Yes, I am invited to Havana and I am 
extremely happy to once again find 
myself in the company of musicians 
from around the world. I expect what is 
always expected of jazz: its feeling of 
After Washington DC and the White House in 2016, International 
Jazz Day (celebrated on April 30) will travel to Cuba, turning 
Havana into the world capital of this music that knows no 
boundaries. As preparations for the 6th edition are underway, 
we caught up with one of its protagonists, the Cuban pianist 
Chucho Valdés, to learn more about this special event.
immediacy. We simply come together 
and decide on a theme on which to 
improvise. Based on this theme, each 
of us will present our own method and 
style. None of our styles will be identical 
to one another’s. You can rehearse 
thousands of times and each time it 
will sound different. That is what is so 
amazing about jazz. It constantly varies 
and the audience also always has its 
opinion to share. We do not know what 
we will play yet, and that’s great. As 
always, it will be spontaneous because 
improvisation is the specificity of jazz. 
We are set to play in the Alicia Alonso 
Grand Theater, where the acoustics are 
excellent and the piano is very good. 
It was presented as a gift by Steinway 
to the Ministry of Culture in October 
2015, when the great pianist Lang Lang 
and I played with Cuba’s Philharmonic 
Orchestra. We are all already very 
moved at the idea of what we will 
produce this time. And the public even 
more so!
You were nominated Goodwill 
Ambassador of the Food and 
Agriculture Organization (FAO) of the 
United Nations. What motivated you 
to accept this nomination?
It seemed important to me to make 
a contribution to the FAO, which 
intervenes where it is necessary, around 
the world. I composed the music for 
a documentary on the 2010 Haiti 
earthquake. I participated in the project 
because all profits from the release 
of the documentary went towards the 
reconstruction of the country.
How do you create your music?
As I mentioned, jazz mainly relies on 
improvisation, even though there are 
arrangements in which the music is 
written. It is what we call “pie forzado” 
in Cuban. It is a theme that is given to 
you and based on which you then start 
an improvisation. We also write the 
harmonies and several chord melodies 
that must be played, while still giving 
free reign to your creativity.
Personally, I practised every day 
to establish the rhythmic bases of 
my continuing experiences with 
Afro-Cuban jazz roots: a mix that 
includes Yoruba and Batá drums (of 
the Yoruba people of Nigeria, Togo 
and Benin), the Cuban conga. These 
polyrhythmic tones are perfect to 
define a rhythmic line on which to 
improvise, or a melodic line where the 
fusion of brass instruments, or even 
piano, can lead to improvisation. From 
there, all you need to do is dig deeper, 
because these musical arrangements 
are a written basis on which to then 
develop your improvisation.

Do you always work with the 
same musicians?
I have worked with my band, the Afro-
Cuban Messengers, for a long time 
and on numerous occasions now, but 
I sometimes work as a solo pianist 
or with an orchestra, which is quite a 
different experience. I have just recently 
recorded an album in New York with 
Arturo O’Farrill’s orchestra. Basically, 
I do not limit myself to one musical 
direction — I tend to explore every path 
there is. I try not to attach myself, but 
rather to vary and continuously find 
new paths.
How did you learn to play the piano?
Let me tell you a little anecdote — I 
do not actually remember the event, 
but I was told that this is how I started 
playing the piano. My father was 
the pianist and assistant director 
of the orchestra of the Tropicana 
cabaret, Cuba’s main music scene that 
welcomed many great jazz artists in the 
1940s and 1950s.
When I was 3, my father returned home 
one day because he had forgotten 
the musical score of the second part 
of a show. There, he heard somebody 
playing a melody on the piano with 
both hands — it was me. He asked my 
grandmother and my mother who had 
taught me, and they both replied that I 
had not been given any lessons, that I 
just tried to imitate him and that when 
he left, I would sit in his place and try 
to play like him. That is how I started, 
apparently. He then gave me lessons 
and when I was 5, he hired a music 
theory teacher to teach me at home. 
When I was 9 years old, I started to 
attend a music school to study piano.
You then played music with your 
father. How did it feel to play with 
Bebo Valdés?
It was incredible — playing with your 
teacher and your father is emotional on 
two different levels. Since I also greatly 
admire Bebo’s art, I learned something 
new each time we played together. 
When I was 15, I started to perform 
live with him and we played on two 
pianos for the television. I think I was 
Bebo Valdés’ greatest admirer. He was 
a talented musician, an amazing father 
and an extremely demanding teacher. 
Sundays when I wanted to go to the 
cinema and I was dressed up and ready 
to go, he would stop me and say, “Your 
piano class is tomorrow, sit down and 
play me what you have worked on”. If 
what I played was not good enough, 
he would say, “Listen, there will be 
no cinema, get changed, sit down 
and work.” I am very grateful to him 
today because I studied as much as I 
could and I directed all my efforts into 
following in his musical footsteps.
Did you also teach your children to 
play the piano?
I have six children, they all play music 
and they are all very good musicians. 
It is not because I taught them music 
but because they are truly passionate 
about it. It is certain that the overall 
musical atmosphere of the house plays 
a role here. I have played with Chuchito 
and with my daughter Leyanis, who 
is an excellent pianist. She graduated 
from schools in Italy and Cuba and 
now plays and composes incredibly 
well. Emilio plays percussions and 
Yousi studied choir directing and plays 
the drums like Jessi. My youngest son 
Julián is 10 years old and I just gave 
him a music lesson.
In today’s era of electronic music 
and digital developments, how can 
we incite young people to continue 
playing jazz?
Since my first band, Irakere, in the 
1960s, to this day, I have collaborated 
with all sorts of new talents. For 
me, the world of electronics and 
computers are what the 21st century 
is about and it has led many people 
to use programmes that considerably 
facilitate orchestration. Arrangements 
are much easier to do now than 
they were in the 1950s. The young 
generation masters these new 
techniques perfectly, and I am sure 
that they are very useful. That’s where 
the future lies.

“The series is like an African fairy tale,” 
the jury stated, “in which tormentors 
become protectors, good wins over 
bad. An analogy for the good life, 
with a right to childhood, schools, a 
profession, family, self-realization. Not 
a melancholy but a fierce humanitarian 
statement that peace is mainly about 
tolerance, respect and appreciation.”
"Look at me, I am beautiful!"
This photograph was adjudged the 
world’s best picture on the theme 
of peace, and is part of the “Look 
at Me, I am Beautiful!” series of 15 
photographs by Patricia Willocq 
(Belgium), a winner of the Alfred Fried 
Photography Award 2015.
The series depicts the journey of a little 
girl born of rape, going through all the 
big milestones of her life: her birth, her 
first steps, her first day at school, her 
wedding, her first day as a mother, etc.
 
Patricia named the little girl Esther, and 
chose as her place of birth, Goma — a 
city in the Democratic Republic of the 
Congo — which has witnessed horrific 
war crimes and sexual violence since 
the 1990s. Esther takes centre stage in 
each photo, as she grows up, always 
surrounded by men who support and 
protect her. They are the very men who 
in reality are the tormentors, but in the 
photos, they protect her, and provide 
her the love and dignity she deserves.
 
All the children shown in the pictures 
are born of rape in the “real world”, 
and all the women have been sexually 
abused. Patricia’s photographs are 
deliberately staged, almost to the 
point of being irritating and kitschy. 
But this brash approach is calculated 
to provoke — the idyllic staging 
returns dignity and self-worth to these 
women, with their festive clothes and 
beautiful smiles.

only beautiful survivors” (www.patriciawillocq.com).

Training judges online
to safeguard journalists
Massive Open Online Courses, specially designed for Latin 
American judges, train them to promote and safeguard freedom 
of expression and enlist their help to make the region less 
dangerous for journalists. The theme of this year’s World Press 
Freedom Day, celebrated on 3 May, is “Critical Minds for Critical 
Times”. What better way to achieve critical minds than training 
the custodians of the legal system about freedom of expression?
by Rosental Calmon Alves 
During a conference in May 2013 to 
mark UNESCO’s 20th World Press 
Freedom Day held in Costa Rica, I 
expressed my enthusiasm for Massive 
Open Online Courses (MOOCs) to the 
then UN Special Rapporteur for the 
promotion and protection of the right 
to freedom of opinion and expression, 
Frank La Rue. These online courses, 
aimed at unlimited participation 
and open access via the web, had 
just begun to gain currency in 2012, 
when I helped launch the world’s first 
journalism MOOC programme at the 
Knight Center for Journalism in the 
Americas at the University of Texas at 
Austin. Through several MOOCs, we 
have reached thousands of journalists 
— and nearly 100,000 people so far — 
around the world with cutting-edge 
skills training that they would otherwise 
not have had access to. 
After discussing the “magic” of 
spreading free access to journalism 
training to all corners of the world, La 
Rue and I discussed the topic of the 
UNESCO conference we were attending: 
the search for ways to end the endemic 
impunity in crimes against journalists. 
Impunity in cases where journalists 
have been murdered or attacked is a 
grave problem in many Latin American 
countries. Only 11% of murders of 
journalists in Latin America and the 
Caribbean have been resolved in the 
last decade, according to UNESCO data 
released in 2016. As noted by many 
experts in the region, impunity in these 
cases often incites further violence 
against journalists.
In recent years, the Committee to 
Protect Journalists (CPJ) has not only 
listed Mexico, Brazil and Colombia 
among the deadliest countries for 
journalists to operate in, but also 
placed these countries at the top of 
its Global Impunity Index, which ranks 
countries where the murderers of 
journalists go free.
We wondered if MOOCs could be 
used as tools to reduce violence 
against journalists in this area. Also, 
would it be possible to use MOOCs 
to train judges on issues related 
to freedom of expression and the 
protection of journalists?

A dream turned reality
Catalina Botero, then Special 
Rapporteur for Freedom of Expression 
of the Inter-American Commission 
on Human Rights (IACHR), who 
was attending the conference, was 
equally enthusiastic about the idea. 
Soon, Guilherme Canela Godoi, 
UNESCO’s Advisor in Communication 
and Information for MERCOSUR 
(Argentina, Brazil, Paraguay and 
Uruguay) and Chile, joined us to 
transform the dream of introducing 
an MOOC for judges into a reality.
Offered four times between 2014 
and 2016, the MOOC, entitled “The 
International Legal Framework of 
Freedom of Expression, Access 
to Information and Protection of 
Journalists” has benefited over 3,000 
judges and judicial-sector operators 
in Latin America. The result of a 
collaboration between UNESCO, IACHR 
and the Knight Center, the course has 
reached judges from all Latin American 
countries, except Cuba.
La Rue is currently Assistant Director-
General for Communication and 
Information at UNESCO, and Botero 
is now dean of the Faculty of Law of 
Universidad de Los Andes, Bogota, in 
her native Colombia. Along with Edison 
Lanza, the current Special Rapporteur 
for Freedom of Expression at IACHR, 
they continue to work together on the 
revised and improved fifth edition of 
the freedom of expression MOOC that 
starts on 8 May 2017, a few days after 
UNESCO’s World Press Freedom Day 
conference is held in Jakarta, Indonesia.
The MOOC follows the Knight Center’s 
model used for journalism training. 
The course is asynchronous, so each 
student can work on days and times 
convenient for them, within the course 
period — in this case, six weeks, from 
8 May to 10 June 2017. The course 
content is divided into weekly modules, 
each with a set of video lectures, 
reading materials and forums, where 
students must discuss the topics and 
respond to questions posed by the 
instructors. Those who comply with 
and complete the course requirements 
receive a certificate.
Testing the water
The pilot programme, launched in 
the autumn of 2014 with a grant from 
UNESCO’s International Programme for 
the Development of Communication 
(IPDC), was aimed exclusively at judges 
and other justice operators from 
Mexico. We were just testing the water 
and unsure of how Mexican judges 
would respond. 
The response was better than we 
could have ever imagined — over 
1,000 applications were received, and

Monitors prove effective
A second MOOC was launched the 
following year, with a more rigorous 
selection process giving preference 
to judges. The main change for the 
624 participants selected was the 
introduction of a team of monitors — a 
group of lawyers from different regions 
of Latin America — who were specially 
trained by Botero to steer the course. 
For example, the monitors lead the 
activities in the discussion forums — a 
central component of the MOOC — and 
respond to legal questions from the 
students. For the first time, the forums 
were divided into certain regions 
or countries, which facilitated the 
discussions and presentation of cases 
and references. The monitors have 
been so successful that they have been 
included in the 2017 course. 
As in all Knight Center’s distance 
learning projects, students have been 
invited to participate in a course-
instructor evaluation for each MOOC. 
The results have been very positive so 
far, with high rates of satisfaction with 
the course, the use of our platform and 
the instructors and monitors.
The MOOC “changed my way of 
thinking about the need to preserve 
and protect the right to freedom of 
expression,” one participant wrote 
on the evaluation. A judge from an 
appeals court, who took the MOOC in 
2016, said the course gave her “a wider 
perspective of the topic [freedom of 
expression]” and was an opportunity “to 
learn in more detail the importance of it 
at the international level, as it effectively 
is a pillar to strengthen the Rule of Law 
in a democratic society. Understand 
it was impressive for me. I will take it 
into consideration in my decisions as 
magistrate in an appeals court.” 
Four years after the conference in 
Costa Rica, Latin America remains one 
of the most dangerous regions of the 
world for journalists. But more judges 
are learning about the international 
legal framework of freedom of 
expression, access to information 
and the protection of journalists. The 
MOOCs are examples of concrete 
actions that can contribute to a 
better understanding of freedom of 
expression issues in the region.
Rosental Calmon Alves, a pioneer of 
online journalism in his native Brazil, 
is the founding director of the Knight 
Center for Journalism in the Americas, 
an outreach programme that helps 
thousands of journalists around the 
world with online training. Alves 
holds the Knight Chair in International 
Journalism at the University of Texas 
at Austin, where he held also the 
UNESCO Chair in Communication from 
2004 to 2016. He is a former president 
of Orbicom, the global network of 
UNESCO chairs in communication.
a total of 932 judges, magistrates, 
prosecutors, court clerks and other 
functionaries of tribunals from across 
Mexico accepted to the course. The 
Mexican Supreme Court’s support to the 
project contributed to its extraordinary 
success. We knew then that we were 
going in the right direction, using digital 
technology to offer quality training, with 
a great benefit-cost ratio compared with 
traditional, face-to-face training.
Since the course was aimed primarily 
at the Mexican judiciary, we enlisted 
Dr. Miguel Rábago, a professor from 
the Universidad Iberoamericana Law 
School, in Mexico City, to cover the 
Mexican legal framework of freedom 
of expression. Dr. Margarita Torres, 
a journalism professor, also from 
Iberoamericana, was asked to moderate 
the discussions in the MOOC and 
facilitate the contacts between students 
and instructors.
Following the success of the two pilot 
projects in Mexico — one at national 
level and the other for the state of 
Coahuila — the first MOOC for judges 
across Latin America was introduced in 
the autumn of 2015. The government of 
Sweden supported the project, as did 
the Ibero American Network of Judicial 
Schools and the Ibero American 
Judicial Summit. This helped attract 
more than 1,200 participants.

Understanding oceans 
"We know more about the topography of Mars than we do 
about the earth’s sea floor," Shin Tani says, even though oceans 
"have a much bigger direct impact on our everyday lives than 
the surface of Mars." But today, we have the ability to map the 
world’s sea floor in more detail than ever, and this is crucial for 
managing fish stocks and environmental change, understanding 
sediment transport, tsunami forecasting, mineral extraction and 
many more areas.
by Shin Tani 
The gap in our understanding of 
Earth is largely because resources 
have been more readily allocated to 
exploring the surface of other planets, 
as well as the fact that mapping 
beneath water is a complex business, 
especially at great depths.
Water absorbs, reflects and refracts 
light to such an extent that it is difficult 
to “see” through it with visual media 
for more than a few dozen metres. 
Huge swathes of the oceans, especially 
those far removed from coastal and 
national areas, are still inadequately 
mapped. Environments such as those 
beneath the polar ice shelves and pack 
ice-covered oceans are as unfamiliar 
to us today as the deep ocean was for 
pioneering ocean-floor mappers over a 
hundred years ago.
But today, with the advent of satellite 
mapping, multibeam sonar and other 
advances in remote sensing, we have 
access to an increasingly broad suite of 
technologies which make it possible to 
map the world’s seafloor in more detail 
than ever. 
Multibeam mapping
Recent developments in multibeam 
sonar mapping — pinging sound pulses 
off the seabed using instruments 
based on vessels — have increased 
mapping resolution so significantly 
that previously obtained data has been 
made virtually obsolete. 
Scientific conclusions based on sparse 
bathymetric information need to be 
re-examined and refined. Only around 
11% of the Arctic has been mapped 
with multibeam, leaving a vast swathe 
of the region that needs to be mapped 
in this way, to ensure that all marine 
activities in the region benefit fully. The 
cost of using multibeam technology has 
fallen sharply since it was first used in 
the 1960s and 1970s, making it a more 
economical proposition.
Meanwhile, other techniques, such as 
geodesy — or gravity mapping — from 
satellites are also coming into their own. 
By calculating anomalies in gravitational 
fields, this process can highlight peaks 
and troughs on the seabed.

Shallow-water bathymetry in  
the Lagoon of Venice, Italy, one of  
the largest lagoons in Europe.
However, this needs time, investment 
and co-ordination. In particular, the 
onus falls on the scientific community 
to explain to the public and funding 
bodies just why bathymetry — the study 
of ocean-floor depth and topography — 
merits more attention.
There has been progress in this area. 
In June 2016 at the Forum for Future 
Ocean Floor Mapping in Monaco, 
Mr Yohei Sasakawa, Chairman of The 
Nippon Foundation, Japan’s largest 
private foundation with a long history 
of supporting key maritime issues, used 
his conference address to announce a 
plan to map the entire ocean floor by 
2030. This will be done in partnership 
with the General Bathymetric Chart 
of the Oceans (GEBCO), which The 
Nippon Foundation has supported for 
many years. GEBCO is a joint project 
of the International Hydrographic 
Organization (IHO) and the 
Intergovernmental Oceanographic 
Commission (IOC) of UNESCO.
Reasons to focus more resources on 
ocean mapping are not hard to find. 
The oceans are regions that are at 
least as fascinating and challenging for 
humans as other environments on this 
or any other planet. Judging by past 
experience, they hold plenty of surprises 
for us, with a myriad of beneficial 
discoveries made during oceanic 
exploration. Moreover, they have a much 
bigger direct impact on our everyday 
lives than the surface of Mars.
Bathymetry is of vital importance for 
navigation and coastal management, 
but also for a growing number of other 
uses. It is fundamental for the study of 
deep-water circulation, tides, tsunami 
forecasting, the upwelling of cold water 
from lower depths, fishing resources, 
wave action, sediment transport, 
environmental change, slope stability, 
palaeo-oceanography, site selection for 
platforms, cables, pipelines and offshore 
wind turbines, waste disposal, mineral 
extraction, and many more areas.
Perhaps the easiest case to make from 
a commercial perspective is that the 
better our knowledge of the ocean floor, 
the more effectively we will be able to 
manage marine environments to ensure 
we carry out fishing in a sustainable 
and productive manner. Bathymetry 
is crucial to our understanding of the 
deep-water habitats of sea life. Better 
knowledge of the oceans also helps 
make the extractive industries safer and 
more efficient.
Tsunami impact
The utility of ocean-floor mapping 
goes far beyond purely commercial 
concerns. Take the example of the 
study of tsunamis. If scientists know 
more about the contours of the 
sea floor and ocean depths, then 
predicting how the vast bodies of water 
disrupted by sub-sea earthquakes will 
behave will become more accurate. 
The modelling of tsunami propagation 
requires both deep-ocean bathymetry 
and high-resolution mapping near the 
shore to provide a complete picture 
of how water will move from deep to 
shallow depths, and how it will impact 
the coast.

While better ocean-floor mapping will 
not improve our ability to predict when 
tsunamis happen, as they are triggered 
by seismological events, it will give 
us more accurate predictions of their 
direction of travel and likely severity 
once they have formed.
Ocean-floor mapping is also a vital tool 
in the effort to track and predict longer-
term environmental changes, which will 
have a major impact on our lives. We 
know that climate change is occurring, 
that the oceans have become warmer 
and that ocean currents have changed. 
How these events are interlinked is 
subject to debate, but we do know they 
are happening and we need to address 
their impact. 
A good example of how an improved 
knowledge of bathymetry can help 
us is the work being carried out 
in the fjords of Greenland and in 
Antarctica, where most of the world’s 
ice is located. We have measured, and 
begun to see, the effect of the inflow 
of warmer ocean water towards the 
outlet glaciers of the Greenland and 
Antarctic ice sheets. The results are 
thinning glaciers, large calving events 
(where part of the ice sheet becomes 
detached), massive ice break-ups and 
glacial retreats. This process can be 
seen in action at locations such as 
Jakobshavn in west Greenland and 
Pine Island Bay in west Antarctica.
These events lead to increased 
acceleration of the ice streams draining 
the glaciers and ice sheets, which in 
turn contributes to a rise in sea levels. 
The scale and rate of rising sea levels is 
hard to predict, which is why we need 
to look at as many factors as possible, 
including the rate of ice melt, to make 
forecasting more accurate.
It is bathymetry that can help us 
gauge the sill depths of the fjords 
and the access points where warmer 
sub-surface water can get in and flow 
towards the glacier, or, in the case of an 
ice shelf, underneath it. These areas are 
currently extremely poorly mapped.
For some fjords we have virtually no 
bathymetry at all, and for regions 
underneath ice shelves, data is mainly 
obtained from sporadic experimental 
forays by autonomous underwater 
vehicles. Improved ocean-floor 
mapping in these areas will allow for 
a greater understanding of extremely 
complex processes.
While the rewards of improved 
bathymetric data are significant, it is 
clear that mapping vast ocean areas can 
only be achieved through international 
coordination and collaboration 
involving the scientific community, 
naval institutions, and industry.

The UNESCO Courier 70
by Koumanthio Zeinab Diallo
From the big cities to the smallest 
villages, the news spread like wildfire. 
Conakry, the capital of Guinea, was 
named World Book Capital for 2017 
by the Expert Advisory Committee 
gathered at the UNESCO Headquarters 
in Paris. This port city on the Atlantic 
is the seventeenth city in the world to 
be nominated, and only the second in 
Africa to receive this recognition. The 
kick-off is on 23 April 2017, World Book 
and Copyright Day.
The news, relayed by the media and 
community-based radio, was mostly 
welcomed with enthusiasm, though 
some believe that culture and books 
are not a priority, given the extreme 
poverty of the population.
However, many recognize the 
nomination as an opportunity for 
Guinean culture to be showcased 
on the international stage. Some are 
even hoping that the event will bring 
economic benefits, with the number of 
visitors it will attract and the activity it 
will generate. For avid literature lovers, 
it is an opportunity to give books and 
culture the recognition they deserve. 
Authors who will be given prominence 
include Camara Laye (1928—1980) who 
wrote the autobiography L’enfant noir 
[The Black Child], and Keita Fodéba 
(1921—1969), writer, composer and 
creator of the dance company Les 
Ballets africains. Guinean publishers 
see the nomination as an opportunity 
to promote their works, to meet other 
publishers and editors, and to discover 
fresh authors.
Writers, publishers, booksellers, 
printers, academics, journalists, 
students, and basically everyone who 
feels involved in the book world are 
all focused on making this year-long 
event a success. The Minister of Culture, 
Sports and Historic Heritage, made 
sure that the event was highlighted 
during the regional days dedicated to 
the development of a cultural policy 
for Guinea, held in four of the country’s 
regions between mid-November and 
mid-December 2016.
Institutions in charge of promoting 
books and reading have been working 
hard to commemorate the event. In 
the region of Labé, the Inspectorate 
for Culture is promoting books and 
reading in collaboration with the Fouta 
Museum and the Guinea PEN Centre, 
which has set up forty school clubs 
featuring rural libraries.
Labé, Guinea’s second-largest city which 
boasts a high concentration of writers, 
journalists, literary clubs and libraries, 
has established meeting points to 
celebrate the event. There have been 
suggestions to relocate certain activities 
from Conakry to Labé. These include the 
inauguration of four new school clubs 
by the Guinea PEN Centre, the release 
of a catalogue of the region’s writers, 
and of a photo album of the exhibition 
Merveilles du Fouta [The Wonders of 
Fouta] at the Fouta Djallon museum. 
Talks dedicated to books and reading 
will also be held at the university and in 
high schools here.
In Conakry, posters announcing the 
World Book Year are being plastered 
on the city walls, and pamphlets 
about the event are being distributed 
everywhere. Locations across the city’s 
districts, and even in neighbouring 
towns, have been identified to set up 
media libraries and reading points. 
The main aim behind this major event, 
after all, is to make books available to 
as many people as possible. Indeed, it 
would be impossible to instill a culture 
of reading if books were hard to find, 
and libraries did not exist. 
The World Book Year will help encourage 
the literate population to read more, 
promote the development and impact 
of books, and make books more easily 
accessible to students and citizens 
alike, so that they are able to make 
the pleasure of reading a part of their 
everyday lives. And who knows, maybe 
eventually there will be media libraries 
and reading points in every region 
across Guinea. Then my grandmother’s 
dream would finally come true: like 
many women of her time, she wanted

Sport for peace
The International Day of Sport for 
Development and Peace is celebrated 
on 6 April, as it has been every year 
since its proclamation by the United 
Nations in 2013.
The contribution of physical activity to 
education, human development and 
the adoption of healthy lifestyles has 
been widely demonstrated. In terms 
of health, for example, it has been 
proven that not exercising enough 
is responsible for 6% of coronary 
diseases, 7% of type 2 diabetes and 
10% of breast and colon cancers. 
Likewise, children who practise a 
physical activity are less inclined 
to smoke, to have high-risk sexual 
behaviour or to use drugs.
Sport also contributes to peace-
building. Its federating role, 
overstepping geographical, cultural 
and social boundaries, makes it a 
powerful instrument to promote 
the ideals of fraternity, solidarity, 
non-violence, tolerance and justice. 
It unites people around common, 
universal values such as respect, 
teamwork, equality, discipline, effort, 
perseverance, honesty and fair play.
 
Fighting and preventing the radicalization of youth
When the internet and social media are 
used as channels for propaganda and 
recruiting youth to extremist networks, 
prevention should also be applied 
through the same channels, according 
to the Government of Quebec that 
recently implemented a strategy 
focusing on counter-messaging online. 
This decision comes in response to an 
international conference organized by 
Quebec in collaboration with UNESCO 
in October 2016.
Radicalization of youth is spreading and 
threatens the security of citizens around 
the world. In May 2017, it is Lebanon’s 
turn to bring together in Byblos, again 
in collaboration with UNESCO, a 
number of experts, representatives of 
civil society and civil servants around 
the theme “Youth and Information 
and Communication Technologies: 
Towards countering violent extremism 
in cyberspace”.
Having endorsed the United Nations’ 
Plan of Action to Prevent Violent 
Extremism which was launched in 2015, 
UNESCO assists its Member States 
in developing prevention strategies 
that focus on dialogue and citizenship 
education. Programmes are intended for 
youth, to provide them from an early age 
with the means necessary to exercise their 
free will and make a positive difference.
UNESCO also supports the media, 
policymakers and researchers in 
finding measures that are best suited 
to prevent and address this disturbing 
radicalization that plagues the internet 
and the streets.
In fact, it is not enough to fight 
extremism, violence, radicalization, 
discrimination and hate. Action must 
be taken upstream by implementing 
tools that defuse this process which 
is rooted in ignorance and the fear of 
others. In other words: prevention is 
better than cure.
Sport — competition, championships, 
games, etc. — has never been as 
popular and mediatized as it is today. 
It is no longer considered a luxury 
but rather an investment, especially in 
developing countries.
UNESCO offers assistance and 
expertise to NGOs and Member States 
who wish to design development 
programmes related to sports, or to 
develop and strengthen their physical 
education systems. It also actively 
participates in the fight against 
doping and acts as a secretariat for 
the Intergovernmental Committee for 
Physical Education and Sport (CIGEPS).
This day is therefore the opportunity 
to reaffirm the importance of sport not 
only as a human right that must be 
respected, but also as a factor for peace 
on the global playing field.

MIL CLICKS: click intelligently!
How many times do we click each 
day? Millions of times: to play, find 
information, read, watch videos, listen 
to music, share content, maintain 
relations with others, etc. all the while 
without being aware of the impact 
that these contents have on our lives 
or our way of seeing the world and 
sometimes without even being certain 
of their validity.
The use of the internet and social 
media therefore implies the need to 
develop new skills related to Media and 
Information Literacy (MIL).
This is why UNESCO launched MIL 
CLICKS, whose acronym stands for 
Critical thinking and creativity, Literacy, 
Intercultural, Citizenship, Knowledge 
© UNESCO
and Sustainability. Its objectives include 
teaching to evaluate information, 
identifying and finding reliable sources, 
and developing critical thinking and 
creativity.
For now, UNESCO’s new initiative exists 
in English, Portuguese and Serbian and 
uses social networks such as Facebook, 
Twitter and Instagram to disseminate 
and share advice, knowledge and 
resources to encourage users to 
acquire these MIL skills in their daily 
interactions.
“We wish to include this notion of 
learning and commitment so that 
everyone can learn to click in a 
critical and intelligent manner,” says 
programme specialist Alton Grizzle. 
“This commitment goes hand in 
hand with online users’ contribution 
to peace-building and promoting 
tolerance, diversity, equality and 
freedom of expression.” 
Click intelligently and join the MIL 
CLICKS global community!

A visit from the Bear Lake People
The Tsá Tué biosphere reserve.
In Canada’s Northwest Territories, the 
Tsá Tué biosphere reserve has always 
been the homeland of the Sahtuto’ine, 
the “Bear Lake People”. The region 
encompasses the Great Bear Lake, the 
last pristine Arctic lake, as well as part of 
its watershed. Having established their 
settlement on the left bank of the river, 
the Sahtuto’ine make their living from 
harvesting activities and tourism.
Preserved from pollution, the nature 
of the biosphere reserve, the healthy 
fisheries and the presence of several 
species including grizzly bears, caribou 
and moose throughout the hydrographic 
basin, constitute an absolutely unique 
ecosystem. Maintaining its integrity is 
essential for the Sahtuto’ine community 
and its culture.
Four representatives of the community 
visit Paris in April to share their stories 
and present their vision during an 
exchange on indigenous strategies 
for the safeguarding of sacred lands, 
traditional lifestyles and the sustainable 
use of lands.

The event, organized by the Canadian 
Commission for UNESCO, the Man and 
the Biosphere Programme (MAB) and 
the Local and Indigenous Knowledge 
Systems (UNESCO-LINKS) programme, 
takes place on 3 April at UNESCO 
Headquarters.
This is sure to be a memorable event 
of sharing.
Open educational resources are gaining ground
Universal access to knowledge and 
quality education (the fourth goal 
under the Sustainable Development 
Goals) is a necessary prerequisite for 
economic and social development, and 
intercultural dialogue.
Open Educational Resources (OER) offer 
an unmatched opportunity to share 
knowledge and strengthen capacities. 
Textbooks, programmes, courses, videos 
and cartoons are all education materials 
that belong to the public domain or are 
published with open-content licences 
and can lawfully be used, shared, 
reproduced, and even adapted.
Over the last fifteen years, UNESCO has 
largely contributed to the development 
of OER, particularly through the 
organization of the 1st Global OER 
Forum in 2002 and the 1st OER 
World Congress in 2012. Additionally, 
UNESCO developed an Open Training 
Platform which offers more than 10,000 
OER, designed to help with teaching 
and research.
The 2nd Open Educational Resources 
World Congress (OER) takes place 
between 18 and 20 September 2017 in 
Ljubljana, Slovenia. To prepare for this, 
the Commonwealth of Learning (COL), 
in partnership with UNESCO and the 
government of Slovenia, are organizing 
six regional consultation meetings: in 
Malaysia for Asia (December 2016), in 
Malta for Europe (February 2017), in 
Qatar for the Middle East and North 
Africa (February 2017), in Mauritius for 
Africa (March 2017), in Brazil for the 
Americas (April 2017) and in
New Zealand for the Pacific (May 2017).
These consultations will address 
the topic, “OER for Inclusive and 
Equitable Quality Education: from 
Commitment to Action”. They are aimed 
at measuring the implementation 
of the recommendations expressed 
during the 1st World Congress in 2012, 
exploring strategies and solutions to 
integrate OER in national policies, and 
encouraging more governments to 
publish open-licensing pedagogical 
material produced with public funds.

Wastewater:  
the Untapped Resource
ISBN 978-92-3-100146-8
162 pp., 21 x 29.7 cm, paperback
45 euros
What if we were to consider the vast 
quantities of domestic, agricultural 
and industrial wastewater discharged 
into the environment everyday as a 
valuable resource rather than costly 
problem? This is the paradigm shift 
advocated in this year’s World Water 
Development Report. It argues that 
once treated, wastewater could prove 
invaluable in meeting the growing 
demand for freshwater and other raw 
materials. In a world where demands 
for freshwater are continuously 
growing, and where limited water 
resources are increasingly stressed 
by over-abstraction, pollution 
and climate change, neglecting 
the opportunities arising from 
improved wastewater management 
is nothing less than unthinkable in 
the context of a circular economy.

To create a more sustainable world 
and to engage with issues related 
to sustainability as described in the 
SDGs, individuals must become 
sustainability change-makers. 
They require the knowledge, skills, 
values and attitudes that empower 
them to contribute to sustainable 
development. Education is thus crucial 
for the achievement of sustainable 
development, and Education 
for Sustainable Development is 
particularly needed because it 
empowers learners to take informed 
decisions and act responsibly for 
environmental integrity, economic 
viability and a just society, for 
present and future generations.

The new Global Education Monitoring 
(GEM) Report by UNESCO, shows 
the potential for education to propel 
progress towards all global goals 
outlined in the new 2030 Agenda 
for Sustainable Development 
(SDGs). It also shows that education 
needs a major transformation to 
fulfill that potential and meet the 
current challenges facing humanity 
and the planet. There is an urgent 
need for greater headway in 
education. On current trends, the 
world will achieve universal primary 
education in 2042, universal lower 
secondary education in 2059 
and universal upper secondary 
education in 2084. This means 
the world would be half a century 
late for the 2030 SDG deadline.
