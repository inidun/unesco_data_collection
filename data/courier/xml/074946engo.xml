THE WILL TO PEACE
F wry yearns ago our fathersstood at the threshold of the
Twentieth Centurv. That was
a time of progress and of belief in
progress, and the eyes of all men
looked forward to the future. But
events were soon to dash their
hopes. Twice, since then, war has
plunged the world into bloodshed
and horror. And our generation
asks today : ( (What grounds have
we for belief in a better future ?))
It would be easy-but quite
unjust-to blame the men of the
Twentieth Century for errors which
are, after all, but the result of
earlier centuries of self-interest, of
greed and of misunderstanding.
Why were the men of 1900 so cer-
tain that they were moving into an
era of peace and well-being ?
What had the Nineteenth Century
done hut extol the glories of nation-
alism ? There were enlightened
exceptions, but in the main it is
fair to say that the man of 1900,
so certain of the glorious prospects
of the days to come, saw world
history from a purely national
angle. His ancestors had, no doubt,
fought for liberty, for equality, for
fraternity-but It was for liberty
and for fraternitv in a world still
divided bv the barriers of frontiers
and of customs. There were a few
peoples who ruled and made his-
tory, but in most of the others,
history was imposed. Was it reason-
able, in such a world, to expect
any peace other than one of mere
resignation ?
The wars of the Twentieth Cen-
tury have, indeed, made things no
better. But through suffering men
have at least-and at last-learned
the unity of human destiny. We
have learned, by tragic experience,
to believe what the philosophers
had vainly attempted to teach us :
that no man can save himself alone ;
that no class, no state, no race, no
nation, can save itself alone. As
Dostoievskv wrote :'''\Ve stand re-
sponsible for all things, before all
men."The bullet which strikes
down any man, even though he be
our"enemy", strikes us too. When
he is lost, a part of ourselves is lost
likewise. And the family he leaves
behind him has lasting claims upon
us.
THE Twentieth Century hasalready witnessed two great
catastrophes. But, in the
midst of disaster, it has also been
responsible for two inspired crea-
tions, unprecedented m history :
The League of Nations and the
United Nations. Whatever the
immediate results of these two
enterprises, one fact remains : this
century, like no other before it, has
sought a world solution for the
problems of mankind. At last the
nations of the world have under-
stood that security for one requires
security for all, and that political
security is meaningless if it is not
founded upon the four fundamental
human rights, to which the great
Agencies of the United Nations
correspond : the right to life, to
health, to work and, Unesco's own
reason for being, the right to edu-
cation and culture.
The conquest of these rights will
demand many long years. We
cannot even hope that this century
will see the full achievement of
such a programme. Nevertheless,
only through such a programme
can world peace become peace for
mankind, peace for all men,
everywhere.
If we are to deserve and to
achieve this we must, above all,
vigilantly maintain our will to
peace. We know now that the most
generous resolutions and the most
admirable intentions are of little
value if we are not ready to tran-
slate them into action. We have
proclaimed Rights of Man ; now,
through our efforts, the union of
the peoples must become more than
a legal phrase. If we do not work
for peace that is possible today, we
shall never create peace that will
last for ever. This torn world of
ours needs a faith ; faith in the
brotherhood of human kind.
In wishing all the peoples of the
world a New Year of concord and
harmony, Unesco reaffirms its
belief in the power of the values
of the mind for the cause of liberty,
of justice and of peace.

Director-General of Unesco.)

UNESCO COURIER-Page 2
S a specialized agency of the United Nations, Unesco has aworld-wide task which leads it into widely different
geographical areas, some of which, however, have a com-
mon linguistic bond.
One of these regions is the Spanish speaking part of America
where ethnological, political, social and economic causes give an
importance and urgency to educational and cultural problems
in the 18 countries it comprises.
The first major step in arousing the interest of the peoples in
these t8 countries in Unesco and its work was the holding of
the Organization's Second General Conference in Mexico, in 1947.
The following article shows how interest in Unesco's aims and
achievements has been developed since the Mexico City Confe-
rence, and particularly during a six week period (September 15
to October 3)) fast year.
Panama, which recently decided to join Unesco, has had a distinctive and picturesque history. During
the early Spanish regime its capital was the storehouse of gord and silver from South America and treasures
from the Orient. In 1671. however, the city was destroyed by pirates, although traces still remain to-day as is
shown in the above photo 01 the Cathedral ruins. The city was rebuilt in 1673 five miles to the West 01 the
old site.
On 15 October representatives from
45 universities were present at
the opening of the first Latin
American Congress of Universities in
Guatemala, to which Unesco had sent
Dr. Jose de Benito and Dr. Pedro
Bosch-Gimpera as observers. A spe-
cial message from the Director-Gener3l
of Unesco was read in the Great Hall
of the University of San Carlos, broad-
cast throughout Central America and
reprinted by the Latin American press.
Unesco had already established
contacts and had been working for the
founding of a World Association of
Universities, and in their speeches.
Dr. Carlos Martínez Duran, Rector of
the University of San Carlos, and Dr.
Raul Osegueda. Guatemalan Ministry
of Education, made numerous referen-
ces to Unesco's work in this field. Yet
so far there had been no hint of the
possibility of the Congress passing
resolutions or agreements establishing
regular and permanent co-operation
between Latin American universities as
a whole and Unesco.
New World University Links
TWO points in particular relating tothe union of Latin American Uni-
versifies are of outstanding inte-
rest for Unesco and for the future of
the World Association of Universities
now in course of formation. Paragraph
(a) of Article I of the Union's objects
reads :"to improve, consolidate and
encourage mutual relations between
Latin American Universities and rela-
tions between those universities and
other cultural institutions and bodies
such as Unesco and the Inter-Ameri-
can Cultural Council of the Organiza-
tion of American States". Another
object is :"the establishment within
the Executive of the Union of. Latin
American Universities of a special sec-
tion for the purpose of promoting the
closest co-operation with international
bodies of a similar kind. preferably
with Unesco".
The application of these provisions is
already becoming a fact. Many Latin
American universities have ratified the
agreements reached at the First Con-
gress and have joined the Union. The
Union's Secretary-General is in contact
with Unesco's Secretariat in Paris and
with the Preparatory Commission of
the World Congress of Universities to
be held at Nice in 1950. The Congress
is being organized by Unesco as a
sequel to the Utrecht Congress of 1948
and all the indications are that, unlike
the Utrecht meeting, which was not
attended by delegations from Latin
American universities, the majority of
those universities will be represented
on this occasion.
In the same six week period last Au-tumn the Information Department
of the United Nations organized
three Latin American regional confe-
represented by M. Asdrubal Salsamon-
di, and Unesco by Dr. Jose de Benito.
Delegates learned a great deal about
the organization and functions of
Unesco, and passed four resolutions
assigning it important tasks.
The Second Conference, held in San-
tiago de Chile from 15 to 18 October.
was attended by representatives from
137. organizations. including 10. 3 dele-
gates and 202 observers, and the Third
Conference, held at Montevideo

these conferences adopted resolutions

Until recently Panama, Costa Ricaand Guatemala had not ratified
Unescc's Constitution. Now, wi-
thin a period of 22 days, all three of
these Central American countries have
approved and promulgated the neces-
sary laws to enable their instruments
of ratification to be deposited at the
British Foreign Office.
On 20 September the Guatemalan
Parliamentary Committee for Educa-
tion and Home Affairs approved a
report commending the Bill for the
ratification of the Unesco Constitu-
tion. The passage of this bill into law
was delayed until November as a result
of the catastrophe suffered by Guate-
mala following torrential rains which
caused hundreds of deaths and serious
damage. When normal life was res-
tored, the Parliament was once again
able to turn its attention to the bill
and give it the three readings required
by law ; following which it was pro-
mulgated by the President of the Repu-
blic and published in the official
gazette.
Making History in Panama
In Panama. almost before the workof the first Latin American Re-
gional Conference on Non-Govern-
mental Organizations was over, the
Ministry of Foreign Affairs drafted a
bill for Panama's ratification of the
Unesco Constitution. On Monday.
3 October, the first day of the new
parliamentary session, the bill was
tabled. By the following day, a favou-
rable report on it had been submitted
by the Foreign Affairs Committee and
a number of articles added respecting
the formation of the Panamanian
National Commission for co-operation
v ; ith Unesco.
The amended text was passed at its
first reading the same day, and after
two more readings it had become law
in a total cf three days. The speed
with which the BiU became'aw is
unprecedented in Panamanian parlia-
mentary history.
In Costa Rica the first move on the
question of the country's joining Unesco
came from Dr. Gonzalo Facio, Minis-
ter of Justice and former Minister of
Foreign Affairs. His suggestion was
welcomed by the President of the pro-
June, is just one aspect of this work.
A seminar on education and illite-
racy was held at Caracas in 1948 and
its work continued at a further semi-
nar in August and September of this
year at Quitandinha (Rio de Janeiro'.
Chile has-1ately been the seat of a
Congress on Marine Biology, while in
Lima a symposium on High Altitude
Biology is now in progress. In Mexi-
co, the Government is launching a
major experiment in fundamental edu-
cation in the State of Mayarit, and
Unesco's 1950 programme provides for
the opening of a Unesco Regional Cen-
tre in Havana to co-ordinate the Orga-
nization's work in the countries of the
Western Hemisphere. In Colombia
another fundamental education experi-
ment has already begun to yield
results.
Hundreds of newspapers are already
regularly receiving articles, news and
stories on advances in science, art and
culture supplied by Unesco. The Orga-
nization is using the four short-wave
bands of the United Nations broadcast-
ing station at Lake Success for educa-
tional and cultural programmes, which
are re-transmitted by mum'serous Latin
American stations.
Lastly, the work of the Regional
Field Science Co-operation Office,
which its now at work in Montevideo,
deserves special mention. One of the
best examples of the kind of practical
work tills Science Co-operation Office
has been doing is the help it was able
to give the Philippines whose maize
fields had been ravaged by locusts.
The Montevideo office was consult-ed, and after carrying out in-
vestigations it forwarded supplies
of a variety of maize immune to lo-
custs which is utilized in Mexico.
From these supplies it has been pos-
sible to grow seedlings for planting so
that much of the maize sown in the
Philippines next year will be safe,
from this pest.
An indication of the speed at which
Unesco's work is being done among the
peoples of Latin America is that the
programme laid down for this Centre
by the meeting of Scientific Experts
on Latin America, and estimated to
require two years, has been completed
in less than seven months.

AVICENNA, BACH,
BALZAC, CONFUCIUS
THE first decision taken at
last months meeting of the
Unesco Executive Board was
10 elect Sir John Maud, Permanent
Secretarv of the British Minis-
try of Education, as its chairman
for 1949-50, in succession to
Sir Sarvepalli Radhakrishnan of
India. Professor Louis Verniers
(Belgium) and Professor Alex
Photiades (Greece) were elected as
first and second vice-chairmen.
The preparation of Unesco's next
General Conference which is to be
held at Florence, Italy, was also
discussed by the Board, which fixed
the opening date for May 22. The
Florence Conference will be a full-
seale one, in contrast to the
"business"conference held in Paris
last September, which discussed
only minor changes in the
progamme.
After considering whether a
general debate similar to the one
organized in connection with the
Paris Conference should be held at
Florence, the Board decided that it
would be more suitable to replace
this by a very full discussion of
the Director-General's report, thus
allowing delegations to go fully into
the aims and policies of the
organization.
Anniversaries
To Be Uelebrated
THE Board, however, expressed
the hope that, in connection
with the Conference, the Ita-
lian National Commission for
Unesco would be able to organize
lectures and other activities to
illustrate various aspects of Italian
culture, as well as to commemorate
the works of several of the world's
great men whose anniversaries fall
in 1950.
Following a suggestion by Pro-
fessor Chen Yuan, of China, that
these should include Confucius, the
2, 500th. anniversary of whose
birth is being celebrated in 1950,
M. Torres Bodet declared that
Unesco was already preparing to
honour this anniversary as well as
those of Avicenna, Bach and Balzac.
It would be ready to co-operate
with the Italian National Commis-
sion and to provide material that
had already been collected for these
anniversaries.
At Florence, the chief task of the
delegates will be to consider the
"streamlined"programme which
was called for by the Paris Confer-
ence. The examination of this
programme was begun by the
Executive Board last month.
After discussing a text suggested
by the Director-General, the Execu-
tive Board requested its programme
committee to prepare, with the
help of a small working party, a
programme in three parts : a basic
programme, a list of the working
methods the organization will
employ to put its programme into
effect and finally, work plans for
M) 5i. This draft will he examined
by the Board at its meeting next
month, along with the Director-
General's budget proposals for
1951, before being submitted to
Member States and finally to the
Florence Conference.
A new step in the development of
Unesco's relations with the
world's regional organizations
was also taken by the Board, which
authorized M. Jaime Torres Bodet,
the Director-General, to co-operate,
with the Council of Europe.
This decision means that Unesco
will now be able to provide the
Council of Europe with information
and technical documentation on
questions with which Unesco has
been concerned in its own work.
The possibility of concluding an
agreement with the Council in
order that Unesco may also carry
out certain work on its behalf will
also be examined by M. Torres
Bodet.
Unesco's move to begin co-operat-
ing with the Council of Europe
was made at the request of the
Council's Secretary-General, follow-
ing the decision of the European
Committee of Ministers to establish
contact with existing cultural
bodies whose object is to promote
and foster cultural co-operation
between different countries.
The Council, which was formed
last year, does not possess mach-
inery to deal with cultural problems,
nor does it propose to create, under
The proposal made by the OAS
is in accordance with a resolution
passed by American teachers who
attended the Rio de Janeiro
Seminar on Illiteracy yin the Ame-
ricas, last August, that Unesco
and the OAS should set up a centre
of this type. It also illustrates
the OAS desire to co-operate in
spreading Unesco's ideals and to
help to carry out the Organization's
work in America.
Thanking the Lebanese Govern-
As a tribute to the work done
for Unesco by Dr. C. E. Beeby,
who, until last October was As-
sistant Director-General in charge
of education, the Executive Board
conferred on him the title of Hono-
rary Counsellor. Dr. Beeby who
has now returned to his post as
Director of Education for New
Zealand, is the third person to be
so honoured. Unesco's other Hono-
rary Counsellors being Dr. Julian
Huxley, the organization's first
Director-General and Dr. Joseph
Needham, former head of the
Department of Natural Sciences.
The Board made a preliminary
study of general problems con-
eerning relations between Unesco
and non-governmental organiza-
tions, aimed at achieving more
efficient co-operation.
Amounts Due From
Member States
Unesco's Executive Board. some of whose members are shown above, at their meeting in
Paris last month, has a membership 01 eighteen. Those serving on the Board are elected by
Unesco's Genera ! Conference ior their personal distinction i the fields of Unesco's interests
and having regard"to the diversity 01 cultures and a balanced geographical distribution".
Its members act on behall 01 the Conference as a whole between the latter's sessions and
not as delegates 01 their respective countries.
its own authority, new technical
bodies for the study of these
problems. But another important
reason which Unesco and the
Council of Europe have for working
together is that the great majority
of the Council's members also
belong to Unesco.
Unesco is planning co-operation
with another regional organization,
the Organization of American
States (OAS) and the lines along
which this is to be developed were
discussed by Unesco's Fourth Ge-
neral Conference in Paris, last
September.
At that time, the Conference
authorized the Director-General to
negotiate an agreement with the
OAS for coHaboration in the
Western Hemisphere on education-
at, scientific and cultural problem :,
in which the aims of the two
organizations are closely related.
Mexican Fundamental
Educatio. n Centre
A !'\OTHER important decision
taken by the Board, in
accordance with a General
Conference resolution, was for the
setting up in Mexico of a regional
fundamental education straining
centre for teachers and worker.'-
and for the production of materials.
This will be undertaken in co-
operation with the Mexican
Government and the Organization
of American States. The OAS has
offered a contribution of $100. 000
for the operation of the Centre in
1950, while the Mexican Government
will provide facilities for its
housing and upkeep.
The OAS has also offered the
assistance of its specialized insti-
tutes and services which deal with
education, health, agriculture, the
conservation of natural resources,
labour, co-operatives and housing.
These services will provide the
Centre with valuable technical
data, advice from experts and infor-
mation on experiments they have
already carried out in America.
ment for an invitation to establish
an adult education training and
production centre in Beirut, the
Board agreed that should it be
possible to set up a second centre,
similar to the one planned for
Mexico, this would be done in the
Lebanon.
Two agreements were approv-
j ed, providing for co-opera-
tion with and assistance for
two international organizations-
the International Council for Philo-
sophy and Humanistic Studies and
the Council for the Co-ordination of
International Congresses of Medical
Sciences-which were recently set
up with the help of Uneseo.
Proposals for contracts with
fourteen international organiza-
tions, providing assistance totalling
$72. 520 were approved, as well as
the detailed distribution of grants-
in-aid amounting to $231, 079 for
the International Council of
Museums, the International Theatre
Institute, the International Council
of Scientific Unions and the Inter-
national Studies Conference.
At the Paris General Conference,
delegates were disturbed by the fact
that budget contributions of some
Member States for preceding years
were still outstanding.
The Executive Board has
therefore authorized the Director
General to start publishing a
statement, on the lines of the one
published by the United Nations,
showing what sums still remain
due from Member States.

UNESCO COURIER-Pae 4
A DAY TO
: BER EVERY DAY
On the first anniversary of the adoption by the United Nations
General Assembly of the Universal Declaration of Human Rights, M. Jaime
Torres Bodet, Director-General of UNESCO, issued a call to action for
the bridging of the gap that exists between the promise of the Declaration and
its fulfilment.
In his message, whose text we publish below, M. Torres Bodet warned that
the Declaration would seem a far off goal"as long as men anywhere still have to
endure hunger and want, injustice and ignorance".
THE FIRST
"HUMAN RIGHTS"
ANNIVERSARY
The Universal Declaration of Hu-man Rights was adopted by the
United Nations General Assembly
on December 10, 1948. A few hours
after this historic decision, Unesco's
Third General Conference, meeting in
Beirut, Lebanon, passed a resolution
instructing the Director-General to
"stimulate the dissemination of infor-
mation about this Declaration... to en-
courage its incorporation... in teach-
ing about the United Nations in
schools..."
Since then, Unesco has used every
available means to make all men
know and understand the principles
enshrined in the Declaration.
In addition, M. Jaime Torres Bodet,
Unesco's Director-General, in a widely
circulated letter, proposed setting
aside December 10 each year for the
celebration of"Human Rights Day".
For Many-The
First Time
festival was given by. Foreign and
Education Ministries, by officially
designating it as Human Rights Day
and by arranging for it to be celebra-
ted in universities and schools, and
by distributing documentary material.
Special articles on the subject were
published in the daily press, some
newspapers reproducing the text of
the Declaration. Films which helped
to publicize Human Rights, included
a short documentary prepared by
Unesco for its Human Rights Exhibi-
tion in Paris, and since. copied for
screening in public cinemas.
Human Rights Day 1949 marked the
end of a year's efforts in the struggle
to convert the principles of the Decla-
ration into facts everywhere in the
world. It was also the prelude to
new and increased endeavours for, as
M. Torres Bodet, Director-General of
Unesco, declared in his anniversary
message :"It is not enough to set
aside a day in commemoration of the
principles that we are now celebrat-
ing."
0n 10 December 1948, the GeneralAssembly of the L'nited Nations
proclaimed the Universal Declara-
tion of Human Rights. The observance
of this important anniversary would be
ovoid of meaning if we, who are cele-
brating it, failed to realize the challenge
that it brings : what have we done, what
are we doing, and what can we do in
the future to help ensure that the lofty
principles of that Declaration are car-
ried into effect ?
No man today, in these troubled time3,
can take refuge in the thought that, for
countess centuries, the human race has
rxisted without exercising the Universal
precepts as contained In the Declara-
tion. The infamy of our violent past
can account, perhaps, for our distrust
of the future ; it does not, however, jus-
lify present inaction.
The Declaration of 10 December is
/lot only a milestone in hLstory : it is
also a plan of campaign. Every para-
graph its a call to action ; every line a
condemnation of indolence ; every sen-
tence reproves some aspect-individual
or national-odour past ; every word
forces us to rye-examine our present
state. Can any of us say : "Not
Guilty ?"
No country Is guiltless of the oppres-
sion that still weighs upon mankind.
How many States can boast, even
within their own frontiers, a real and
complete code of freedoms ? And, even
if they could, would they, by that fact
alone, have fulfilled their duty towards
the rest of the world ?
Written in the Peoples'Blood
TRUTH recognizes no frontiers. The
destiny of man is a universal re-
sponsibility shared by everyone. So
long as any right of any man is violated,
the United Nations'Declaration will
hold us guilty of cowardice, negligence.
laziness and inhumanity. The document
signed in Paris a year ago will seem a
very far off goal so long as men
anywhere still have to endure hunger
and want, injustice and ignorance.
The Declaration of 10 December
moves us-it moves us because it was
writlen in the blood of millions of men
Since adopting this suggestion, au-thorities in countrie  throughout
the world have been planning the
most appropriate and effective ways of
observing the first anniversary of the
Declaration's adoption.
As these plans were put into effect
on December 10, millions of people
listening to radios or attending public
meetings were told, many of them for
the first time, of the nature of their
rights as men and women as well as
their corresponding duties.
Lack of space prevents the"Cou-
rier"publishing individual accounts of
events in countries where Human
Rights Day was celebrated, but these
reports. coming from all parts of the
world had one thing in common ; they
all confirmed the importance of De-
cember 10 1949 as a milestone on the
road to making Human Rights come
alive.
In tiny village schools and the large
modern ones of big cities teachers read
and explained the Declaration's 30
articles and emphasized its importance
as a landmark in the fight for free-
dom.
Spreading Human
Rights Message
The leading citizens of many coun-tries spoke on human rights
through the radio and at public
meetings. Leaflets, pamphlets and
books, bearing the full text of the
Declaration were widely distributed.
Special ceremonies, including dra-
matizations of the Rights, and concerts
in which artists and musicians from
different countries took part, were
organized by Unesco National Com-
missions and non-governmental organi-
zations in many parts of the world.
Full support in the efforts to make
December 10 a truly international
ARLY last month. Maria Montessori. the distinguished Italian woman educa-
tionist, made a short visit to Paris for consultations with Unesco's Department
01 Education. The first woman in Italy to graduate in medicine, Maria Montes-
sori developed the"Iree discipline"method of educating children which has since
had a world-wide effect on teaching practices. Today, aged 79. she is still engaged
in the work she began nearly 50 years ago.
During her stay in Paris. Maria Montessori was honoured by the French Govern-
ment which made her an Officer 01 the Order 01 the Legion 01 Honour.
On December 7. during a reception in her honour at Unesco House. M. Torres
Bodet, Unesco's Director-General, paid tribute to her life's work. when in the
course 01 a speech he said :
"THE new education, so stronglymarked since its inception by
tile impress of your thought
can property be described as revolu-
tionary -and I think the main reason
wily it is so, may well be that many or
its pioneers were doctors like yourself.
It was the dtudy of the abnormal child
and appreciation of the impossibility
of applying to the backward or men-
tally deficient, the methods of elemen-
tary education then in vogue that
brought you to devise - originally for
their benefit - a new technique and a
new equipment. Nevertheless your
mo. most most important innovation was a new
approach. Your ideas, like all great
ideas, were simple ; but what you
advocated for the teaching of back-
ward children proved so fruitful of
results that its suitability for all young
children was at once apparent-the
doctor became a great leader in edu-
cation, and the whole of education
reaped the benefit.u "Your primary idea, comprehending
in itself all the reemainder, was that
detion precedes thought and that
thought is the child of action. Its
direct consequence was emphasis on
notor adjusment and the co-ordination
of movement and perception; and ; and
equipment of your devising taught the
child to do things involving the first
beginnings of geometry and perhaps
even of logic. But there were other
consequences : the whole legacy of
outmoded methods of format, merety
verbal, teaching was explored; the way ; the way
was opened to an active method of
education ; and it was sh own that the
pupil - whatever his age - is not
just a brain to be stuffed, a many-
sided being, needing full play for all
his faculties."
"... Alld there is yet a further tribute
of thanks and admiration to be paid to
one who brought so clear and keen a
rision to the problem of peace ; for it
was you who reminded us all that care
lavished on the child would all be
wasted unless it made him a respon-
sible citizen, strong-tao meet the chal-
lenge of our age. Here your concerns
and ours are one : our task is to help
the teachers of all nations to train
those future citizens of the world
without whom all our undertakings
must rest sterile. Madame Montessor,
Unesco accounts itself honoured by
your presence."
and women who died that we might be
able, one day, to proclaim these prin-
ciples. And what is written in the
peoples'blood can never be erased.
Documents such as the Gnicersal De-
claration of TIuman Rights are incen-
tives not to complacency but to heroism,
There is little value in writing them; ;
the important tMng is to lire them.
They are not just dreams or hopes.
They are calls to action, showing us the
tremendous gap that exists between the
promise and the fulfilment. It is we
who must close that gap, bringing all
our talent and strength to the task. To
sustain this ideal, built up at such heaey
cost, demands of us tenacity and cou-
rage.
A Great Symbol : Man's Dignity
T 1at is why Unesco is trying tomake known the Declaration of
10 December eveywhere, both to
the adult and the child in school. Our
conduct will never be imbued with its
principles if these are taught mechanic-
ally. These principles can only be
learnt through practice. Every right
has its corresponding duty : for ins-
tance, the right to education implies
our duty to give others the edu-
cation they need ; the right to work
implies that we must work to earn that
right ; the right to freedom of thought
implies that we must both think freely
and tolerate others'freedom of thought ;
the right to equality before the law
implies the need to respect the laws
that ensure that equality ; and, finally,
that fundamental right, rooted in the
hidden depths of our being-the right
to life-bids us respect in all cir-
cumstances the right of others to live.
To spread throughout the world a
knowledge of the Declaration of 10 De-
cember is to launch a worldwide
campaign for decent living condi-
tions for all, to be brought about by
governments in solemn and practical
recognition of their duties in regard to
the social development of mankind.
Unesco's great mission is to help States
to fulfil those duties in the fields of
education, of science and of culture.
And what more inspiring role could we
ascribe to culture, education and science
than to make all men the guardians, and
therefore the faithful executors, of the
Universal Declaration ?
On a day like this, millions ofchildren bow before a great sym-
bol : the dignity of man-of the
man that each child, between hope and
fear, is preparing to become. Let us
try to ensure that the world they will
inherit is happier than the one into
which we. ourselves, were born. The
nations are tired of fighting fruitless
wars; ; but they are no less tired of
hearing barren precepts. The peoples
want words that are borne out by deeds.
Every one of the rights of man was
fought for : and we must fight to keep
and extend them. It is not enough to
set aside a day in commemoration of
the principles that we are now celebrat-
ing. Celebrating them means prepar-
ing to carry them out. And carrying
them out means practising them every
day, every hour, in every action of ours
throughout our lives. Thus shall we
be men living in independence, courage
and faith in the condition of man.

Last year, UNESCO'S Radio Unit
asked broadcasting organizations in
different parts of the world to send
in stories from their own countries
suitable for children aged from six
to ten ; and having as their basic
theme the idea that the best way
to settle a dispute is by sitting down
and talking things over.
From the first stories it received,
the Radio Unit has elected 12 which
are being translated into English,
French and Spanish, and adapted for
broadcasting. This first series of
"Children's Stories for Peace"will
shortly be sent out to radio orga-
nizations for use in children's
programmes.
The tale below, which coms from
America, is included in the first
series of"Stories for Peace".
The Mighty
One was so wor-
ried he could
not sleep. Night
after night
he lay awake
with his sad
thoughts. But
think as he
might, he did
not know what
to do.
The merry twinkle of the stars, even
the smiling face of the full moon,
could not make him forget his sorrow,
so full of noise were his ears, a ter-
rible noise that came from the earth.
Everybody there was fighting every-
body else, and the noise they all made
filled the space. Just what was the
trouble that caused the noise that
filled the space and kept the Mighty
One awake was not clear even to the
Mighty One himself.
For no reason at all, or so it seemed,
Dog chased Cat up a tree and vowed
he'd never let Cat come down. After
awhile, Cat became hungry and he
miauled as loud as he could. Dog was
unmoved. Perhaps because a dog
with a full stomach does not know
how hungry a cat with an empty sto-
mach is.
But fwhy did Bear send a rock roll-
ing down the mountainside ? Thun-
dering into the valley, it crushed Baby
Deer on its way.
The Bird People were just as bad.
Eagle took the twigs Pigeon had
gathered for his nest. Pigeon cried.
It was the same with the Tree Peo-
ple. Willow sent a root across the
whole width of the stream, sprouted
from it countless branches, weaving a
tight net which caught all the Fish
Folk.
EARTHWORMS LOST
THE RACE
Even the peaceful earthworms cameout of their tunnels t  challenge
the beetles to a race-which
they lost.
It seemed that everyone hated every-
one else. The Bird People, the Fish
Folk, Trees, Hills, Grasses, all the
animals, even those living under the
(A T ale from American Indian Folk Lore)
ground, all around the world everybody
was fighting, including the men.
It was the men who made the most
noise of all, quarreling, fighting and
killing each other so skilfully, that
only a few of them were left alive.
No wonder the Mighty One could not
sleep. He had made the world and all
the peoples in it. Now they were
destroying each other.
<&lt; What shall I do' ?)) he asked
himself over and over again, without
listened in si-
consulted each
finding any answer, until he thought
of calling the winds. They came all
at once and together in one big gust.
the North Wind, the South Wind, the
East Wind and the West Wind, bring-
ing along their Half-Brothers and all
the Breezes.
« What shall I do to make the
peoples of the earth stop fighting ? >&gt;
asked the Mighty One."I gave them
food to eat and water to drink, the
sun to keep them warm and the moon
to cheer them by night. I made many
of each kind so that none would feel
lonely. But instead of loving each
other, they quarrel and fight. I must
find some way of stopping them."
The Wind Persons 
lence. Softly they 
other.
"We have an idea", they said finally,
whispering it into the ears of the
Mighty One.
GATHERING AT
RED STONE MOUNTAIN
THE Mighty One smiled, thankedthe Winds and immediately sent a
message to all the peoples of the
earth to gather around the Mountain
of the Red Stone. He also told each
person to bring a gift, something of
his very own, that no one else could
give.
From all over the world they came
and crowded on to the mountain,
quarreling, fighting as fiercely as ever
They made so much noise, they never
even noticed the Mighty One was
there.
"Get out of my way !"
"Why did we all have to come
here ?" angrily they shouted, pushing
each other.
The Mighty One answered them.
"I asked you all to come here to
make you happy."
All heard him and they were quiet.
"I gave you mends to
love. I gave you food and
water and clothes and
everything you wanted.
But you fight and quarrel.
I am sad. I am so sad I
cannot sleep. And be-
cause I cannot sleep I am
very, very tired."
Everyone was so still
you could hear the drops
of water drip ofT Raintree
and sink into the soft sand below.
Quietly, one after another, each person
brought his gift and laid it at the feet
of the Mighty One.
Beaver brought a whisker. Dog gave
a claw. Eagle dropped on the pile his
beautifullest feather. Willow a bundle
of branches. Mink gave his white-
tipped summer tail.
While the pile was growing and
growing the-winds blew about excit-
edly because they knew what was
going to happen.
<&lt; Now>&gt;. said the Mighty One, when
all had given what they had to give.
« I shall make you a gift. Of all the
gifts you brought I shall make a pipe."
So saying, he picked up from the
ground a smooth red stone, took'ne of
Willow's branches and fixed one to the
other with some Bee's wax. To this
he fastened Eagle's feather. Rabbit's
fur, and all the other things, neatly
tying them with strips of Buffalo's
hide until all the gifts were gone. He
painted the pipe with the bright
colours of the rainbow. When it was
dry, he took tobacco out of his tobacco
pouch, filled the pipe and lit it. The
Winds provided the draft.
"Now, each one in turn will take
cne puff", he said. and he showed the
people how to smoke, by taking the
first puff himself.
One after another, each person took
one puff, passing the pipe to the next
person, until all had tasted the sweet
taste of friendship.
And then, one after another,, each
person joined in the chorus, until all'
were singing the song of the Peace
Pipe :"Nin-do-kidj-an-nin-do-kidj an-
nin-do kidj-an."
When finally the pipe came back to
the Mighty One. he said :"This is
your Pipe of Peace. Each one of you
gave something to make it-something
of himself. Remember, whenever a
person quarrels with another person,
let them not fight, but come together.

things over."

FILMS
TO
a renaissance of art-appreciation.
More and more people of all ages,
social classes, countries and races
want to see and appreciate art trea-
sures of the past and present. This
is a. growing cultural need calling for
the employment of new techniques.
THERE are, of course, museums inmany parts of the world with re-
presentative art collections of the
most brilliant periods. There have
been travelling exhibitions and experi-
ments with shows of specially pro-
duced and selected high-qualhy repro-
ductions. But all this is limited in
scope, and certainly far from com-
mensurate with the needs of a poten-
tially unlimited public-countless men
and women or all countries.
Radio has done much to bring music
to the people. Now another of the
media of mass communications, the
cinema, is beginning to do the same
for the pictorial arts. How effective
the cinema can be in bringing the arts
to the people was impressively illus-

including many official works. His more
persona] period came in later years.
In the following article. Peter Urlik
describes some of the art films that are
today helping"the many as well as
the few"to develop a sense of aesthetic
appreciation.
* *
MOST of the world's finest art
treasures are still'enjoyed
by too few people. The
reason is not that people
generally are insensitive to beauty,
but that works of art are often diffi-
cult of access. This holds true even
for countries exceptionally endowed
with art treasures, like Italy or
France.
For centuries, many of the finest
works of art-enduring testimonies of
man's skill and aspiration towards
beauty-have thus remained reserved
for the few. Architectural monu-
ments, sculptures and paintings can-
not be moved easily, nor is it desirable
that they should be removed from ori-
ginal and natural settings. Often
such art treasures are the private pro-
perty of nobility or clergy, or are
placed in museums in a few big cities.
In any case, only a comparatively lim-
ited number of people will be able to
admire them.
With the increasing educational fac-
ilities of modern civilization, man's

devices to draw out the very essence 01 the artist's work and 10 highlight his intentions.

Castle, the producers have shown four portraits o ! Rubens, as he saw himself at various
periods in his live.
awareness of the place of art in his
life has been re-awakened. It would
probably not be amiss to speak of
An example of how the camera helps to''rediscover"a work of art. Fra Angelico's"La Leggenda

interpretative school of art film production in Italy. Emmer uses the camera to select. isolate and
magnify the details of a painting and with ingenious cutting and appropriate musical background.
.,. gives life and mobility to the whale.-
trated during the recent Tenth In-
ternational Film Festival in Venice,
when about 20 outstanding document-
ary films on art subjects were shown.
Whether produced in colour or in black
and white ; whether lasting one hour
or only a few minutes, the best among
them make it possible for the layman
to appreciate and wholeheartedly enjoy
the masterpieces in painting, sculp-
ture or music.
These films came from France, In-
dia and Italy. They were certainly
not the first art documentaries ;
yet some of them marked a new
technique of making paintings, sculp-
tures, architectural monuments and
music come to life for the specta-
tor with a particular intensity. To
take one example : an Italian film on
the great Florentine master, Sandro
Botticelli, by Luigi Cristiani. A new
coiour-technique contributed to its
pictorial excellence, but its most strik-
ing feature was the intelligent scenic
interpretation of the poetry, mysti-
cism and mastery of Botticelli's art.
No visit to a museum could bring
the spectator so near the very essence
of artistic creation, nor convey so di-
rect a visual understanding as these
film sequences which show such works
of world renown as the"Birth of Ve-
nus","Primavera","Magnificat",
"Adoration"and the"Madonna of St.
Barnabas". Similarly successful film
ventures are"Michelangelo's Last

cent", produced with great care anc
discrimination by an Italian film stu
dia specializing in the production 0
films on art.
Films are also showing to increas
ingly large audiences such resplenden
examples of architecture as, fo
instance,'''Santa Maria della Salute"
a film about the baroque basilic :
built by Baldassare Longhera in 1631
to express the gratitude of th
people of Venice for their escape from
annihilation by pestilence.
Thanks to this film, the majesti
cupola of this church, which rises a
a landmark of singular beauty at thl
entrance of the Grand Canal i)
Venice, will be seen by man ;
thousands of people, who migh
otherwise never have even dreamt 0
buildings so perfect and glorious.
Italy's lead in art documentaries i ;
understandable, for Italy is a countr ;
of unequalled art treasures and tra
ditions, but other countries are no
lacking in films of quality and interest.
A Frenchman, J. K. Raymond, has
made a delightful short film on
"Islamic Art". An Indian, G. M.
Bhavnani, produced the remarkable
film"Saga in Stone", shown for the
first time in Europe at the recent
Venice Film Festival. This picture
will acquaint the public of the world
with fascinating examples of Indian
architecture of the classical 15th and
16th Centuries, with temples and
intricate façades that seem to be alive
with sculptured gods and godesses of
Indian mythology.
THESE are but a few examples of anew kind of art docum ntary.
which can contribute greatly to-
wards a more general enjoyment and
understanding of works of art, no
matter where they originate, or what
language the spectators speak. Two
recent art films even succeeded in !
making language entirely superfluous.
One of them might almost seem a ;

tor's ear is filled with the music ofj

depicted the scenes musically told in
the great oratorio.
Another composer, Mendelssohn,
speaks wordlessly to people every-
where, and he does so in a new and
exciting manner in the film"Romance
without Words". Harmonies of
sound and sight are blended with
startling effect as three piano works
by Mendelssohn are played while the
architectural scenery of Venice un-
folds before the eye, with the same
palaces, canals, and gondolas, with the
same play of light and shade on
sculptured ornaments, which inspired
the composer to write his music dur-
ing his stay in Venice in 1830."Ro-
mance without Words"lasts only
12 minutes, and yet the impact of its
visual and musical harmonies is such
as to make the spectator momentarily
lose his sense of time.
These are indeed striking examples
of the way in which the cinema is
opening up new possibilities of aes-
thetic appreciation, for the many as
well as for the few.
SCIENCE AND THE CINEMA
- EACH HELPS THE OTHER
BEFORE the advent of lhe
brothers Lumière and of Tho-
mas Edison ; before, indeed,
the invention of the cinematograph,
scientists had already devised several
ingenious instruments able to register
and analyse movements which escape
the naked eye.
In 1874, Pierre Janssen, the astro-
nomer, was able to photograph the
successive phases of Venus. In about
1880, Marey invented a.'photo-gun"in
which the trigger moved plates into
position rapidly enough to make it
possible to photograph a bird in flight,
whilst Eadweard l\1uybridge was able
to record the movements of a galloping
horse by means of a series of photo-
graphs taken in quick succession.
Indeed, the cinema was invented pri-
marily for scientific purposes rather
than for those of art and enter-
tainment.
As a scientific instrument, the ine-
ma has two aspects which are comple-
ll1entarv to each other. On the one
hand, scientific research brought tech-
Two years ago, Gaston Diehl, a young
French art critic, working with Robert
Hessens and Alain Resnais, made a film
about Van Gogh, using such works as the
self-portrait of Van Gogh (above, left) to
interpret the artist's message.
Art films bring out the wealth of detail in works 01 art as. for example. in the above

nical improvements both to the camera
and the film, whilst, on the other,
films became a valuable means of
research into the different branches
of pure and applied science.
Curiosity of man
in the street
IN October 1947, an InternationalScientific Film Association (ISFA)
was set up through the joint ef-
forts of the Institut de Cinematogra-
phie Scientifique, created in Paris in
1930 by Jean Painleve, and the
Scientific Film Association of Scientific
Workers.
The third annual Congress of the
I. S. F. A. was held last year in Brussels
on the invitation of the Belgian Insti-
tute of Scientific Film Production.
Delegates and observers from more
than 20 countries and from Unesco
attended this meeting and also parti-
cipated in a Festival of Scientific Films
which was held in Brussels during
the same period.
Entries at'the Festival came from
Australia, Belgium, China, Czechoslo-
vakia, France, Germany, Holland,
India, Italy, Poland, the Soviet Union,
South Africa, the United States and
Uruguay.
On the opening day of the Festival,
the great ship-like hall of the Brussels
Palace of Fine Arts was filled to capa-
city. The opening ceremony was
attended by Queen Elizabeth of Bel-
gium and many prominent personali-
ties of the scientific and film worlds,
but the bulk of the audience number-
ing some 2, 000 was made up of ordi-
narv men and wpmen who had come
to the Festival out of interest and
sometimes out of sheer curiosity.
limitless fields"
or knowledge
IN less than a week, more than 150"shõrts"were shown which can be
broadly elassified as follows :
popular scientific films, films on scien-
tific research, educational films, films
dealing with medicine and surgery and
those depicting industrial processes.
The complexity of subjects already
dealt with and the limitless fields of
knowledge which remain to be explor-
ed by the camera are almost over-
whelming.
But the task is not only one of
producing scientific films : it is essen-
tia that these should have the largest
possible circulation. It should, there-
fore, be borne in mind that there are
many international barriers to be
overcome before their circulation can
become truly international-
It will be remembered that at its
third General Conference at Beirut
Unesco adopted an international agree-
ment relating to the circulation and
the spreading of educational, scienti-
fic and cultural aids bý audio-visual
means. The agreement has now been
submitted to the member states for
acceptance. It will come into effect as
soon as ten countries have accepted it.
In the meantime, I. S. F. A. at its third
annual congress, has drawn up the
draft of a bilateral agreement relating
to the exchange of films produced by
government departments. The char-
acter and scope of this scheme are
limited but it is a first step and one
which may well lead to a more general
type of agreement.
Co-operation for which
the world is richer
) 1" order that films may circulate, itis n cessary to cre te a demand.
This is one of the reasons why the
Brussels Congress decided to adopt an
international card-index system. In
future, all scientific films will be listed
and analysed in their countries of ori-
gin for reference, information and
eventual use in other countries. Not
only will this system promote the
exchange of films but it will prevent
work from being done twice.
The Third Annual Congress of the
I. S. F. A. has established three perma-
nent committees. These bodies will
concern themselves with films in the
respective fields of industrial techni-
ques, medicine and surgery and pure
science.
Among the schemes which are being
actively promoted are the production
of scientific films on an international
basis, the creation of an international
film library, and the publication of a
magazine and of a year-book.
The activities of the he S. F. A. in the
service of the cinema and of science
are good news indeed. Each helps the
other and the world is richer for it.

UNESCO COURIER-Page 8
When Unesco asked Mrs. Amabel
Williams-Ellis, a leading British
writer, to prepare a report on
"The Popularization of Science
Through Books for Children", it also re-
quested that she make her approach some-
what different from that employed in other
reports of the"Popularization of Science"
series.
Mrs. Williams-Ellis, an experienced writer
in this field, was asked to put down as far
as she could what experience had taught
her were the considerations and techniques
that an intending author should bear in
mind.
This seemed to Unesco a useful approach
because books of the kind under review
are needed for children speaking many
languages and having many backgrounds.
Furthermore, education authorities-na-
tional and local-will want to discuss the
basis of such books before commissioning
them, and it is hoped that these authorities,
after reading this report, will have a clearer
view about whom to approach and what
standards to adopt before"approving"a
book.
Finally, the value of such an analysis to
the intending author, to whom she directly
addresses it, and to the commercial pu-
blishers, who are wondering if they shall
use their capital on the production of such
books, is equally clear.
Maurice Goldsmith, of Unesco's Natural
Sciences Department, has written for the
"Courier"a short review of the report by
Mrs. Williams-Ellis, which we publish
below.
How are we to teach science to
the child ? This is a difficult
question to which there is
no simple, universal answer. We can
define"science"as"the natural
sciences", but the definition of
"child" is not as simple. One of
the most common and fatal mis-
takes the adult can make is to
assume that among the young of
any community t here is such a
being as"The Child."
In fact,"a child from five io
seven is unlike what the same child
will he about nine ; the nine and
ten-year-old is again unlike what
it will be between 12 and 15.
Moreover, at each stage the child
will find a book intended for a
different age group much less
acceptable than an adult".
These are the words of an expe-
rienced writer of books on science
for children. She is the British
author, Mrs. Amabel Williams-
Ellis, who has written more than
20 books, including the very widely-
read"How You Are Made".
Now, in a Report,"The Populari-
zation of Science Through Books
for Children,"specially written for
Unesco's Division of Science and
Its Popularization, Mrs. Williams-
Ellis has produced something that
may he described as"a prescrip-
tion"for books of this kind. She has
put down what experience has
taugh! her are the considerations
and techniques that an intending
author has to bear in mind.
Although her experience is based
upon writing books for children
with a western background, she
helieves that an author intending to
write for children, say in Asia or
the Carribean, with be able to make
his own corrections. "The general-
ization that'Children of a given
age are alike all over the world'is
probably less of an exaggeration
than any generalization that seeks
to cover the tastes and capacities of
an individual child through its
different stages of development,"
she declares.
AMABEL WILLIAMS-ELLIS
AMABEL WILLIAMS-ELLIS, whose report"The Popularization of Science
Through Books For Children"is
reviewed on this page, says she took up
writing for children to provide books
which her own children seemed to need
and which were not to be found. She con-
tinued this work, as she found it to be
more stimulating and a better discipline
to a writer than any other literary side-
line.
Mrs. Amabel Williams-Ellis, who was
for some time literary editor of the Lon-
don Weekly, the "Spectator" says she has had"an almost continuous
education from Children"., The first of these was a young brothel
(John Strachey, the present British Minister of Food), then her
own three children, then a group of from ten to seventeen
evacuated children who filled her house for most of the war, and
finally her small grandchildren.
Books for children have therefore figured largely among the total
of over 20 which she has written, one of the most widely read being
"How You Are Made". Her other children's books include"How You
Began","The Beagle in South America","Men Who Found Out",
"What Shall I Be","A History of English Life", and with the help
of her husband and children"In and Out, of Doors".
At present she is working on a number of hooks which include
"Human Nature Study", "The Art of Being a Woman"and, for
Unesco, a"Food and People"Geography.
Mrs William-Ellis, whose recreations are walking, sailing and
travelling, has been round the world and has visited America, Aus-
tralia and New Zealand as well as most European countries.
In this Report,she discusses the
techniques of"mediating the
changing world of science to the
changing child (by means of
books".
The main job of the science
writer for children is"to estab-
lish in the child methods of
thought about the phenomenal
world which have abundantly
proved their success in action and
uy means of which mankind has at
fast achieved, in an unprecedented
degree either control or the power
of prediction, in a number of
fields If it is too much to hope to
establish such thinking habits, the
rhild can at least be made aware of
them".
Scientific method-observation,
experiment, and the constrution
and testing of hypotheses-must
he made clear ; and the technique
of science must be guided by a
habit of mind which demands
much more rigorous proof than is
common in the everyday world.
The emphasis must be on
keeping to the concrete and the
particular, on avoiding dogmatic
abstraction. The author"must
bear in mind that he has to correct,
for his particular field, an existing
hias towards dogma and rule of
thumb, and even magic, which has
its roots deep in the history of
human culture".
Chock-full
of wisdom
THERE is no space here to giveexamples of the common-sense
mattef-of-factness which
makes t his Report one of the best
written. It is chock-fun of wisdom.
Mrs Williams-Ellis, after inves-
lig-ating"What Are We Trying To
Teach ?". goes on to consider :
"Whom Are We Trying To Teach ?"
"What Branches of Science Should
Be Taught ?""What Approaches
Can We Use?" and ends with a
word of advice to the publisher.
Above all. she warns,"all these
rules and tips'and'analysis of
consumer needs'are no good unless
the author U) has sympathy with
children ; (2ì either knows his
subject, or can, like a good lawyer,'get up a brief'efficiently ; (3) knows
how to write. \Vhere there is a
collaboration over such a book, as
there often is and should be, the
present writer ventures to suggest
that it is the author-the artist
in presentation-who should be
the senior partner.
« (Leaps across ages,
conquers space "
"F IK\LL'\'. we nm ; ; 1 n ('\'e[' flll'l. wlthat no  and the  an author,
who is an artist when he is
on his day, can hreak all the rutes
and even produce that apparently
impossible thing, the publisher's
ideal - an all-round book on
science for young readers. This
has been done, at least once, by
Ilin in his 'Men and Mountains',
which is liked by children of any
age between eight and fifteen, a
bllok whieh Maxim Gorkv in his
introduction rightly called 'a prose
poem'.
"Here the details are fused by
the author's imagination into one
compelling whole. Ilin leaps across
ages, he conquers space, and the
reader's imagination gallops after. after.
In the exhilarating rush, the reader
from a different land finds himself
applying and adapting what is-in
Din's text-local to the Steppe,
the tundra or the Caspian, to his
own landscape.
"But even IIin only once achieved
this degree of creative energy.
Thus we cannot rely on inspiration
or despise any liltle tips on'how
to write'that we happen to find
useful.
"In this field the imaginative
writer has the consolation of
feeling that even a lesser degree of
success can yet be useful, enlighten-
ing. agreeahle and delightful. The
world's Children badly need some
new hooks and we authors are
guilly of a grave dereliclion of
duty, if laziness or self-satisfaction
ever lead us to write for them less
well than we might. We must not
give stones to the children who ask
us for bread."
"The campaign on 'Food and
People"was, indeed, Unesco's most
rewarded effort of the year in Bri-
tain, and the discussions emphasize
the value of the Organization's
contribution towards the educational
campaign which must accompany the
application of science to agriculture
and problems of human nutrition."

"A CHtLDS EDUCATION BEMNS
TWENTY YEARS BEFORE HE IS BORN"
By proclaiming that"everyone has theright to education", and qualifying
It with the words,"without distinc-
tion of sex", the Universal Declaration of
Human Rights draws attention to one of
thefunaamentat probtems of our age :
equality of educational opportunities for
women.
The problem Is one of redressing an
injustice, an age-old injustice whioh,
though less flagrant than in the past. still
oonstltutes a glaring denial of the rights of
the majority of women In the world.
Unesco. which Is working jointly with
the United Nations to make the theoretical
equality of women's right to education a
praotical fact, last month called a meeting
of an alp-woman committee of experts to
examine the obstacles which prevent the
realization of this right and to suggest how
they can be overcome.
The following artlole which outlines
some aspects of the problem as It exists
to-day and suggests how Unesco might
attaok them, Is based on reports prepared
by Mite. Jeanne Chaton, a Unesco Consult-
ant on Women's Education and Secretary
General of the Women's Expert Committee.
A L'rHOl'GH the right of women to
education is proclaimed in the
Cniversal Declaration of Human
Rights, and although it was conflnued
bY most of the countries which rep'ied
hi the questionnaire sent out by the
COI/lI/li. ç"Îon on tile status of l\'omen
(UX Economic and Social Council), the
position in many countries is still unsat-
isfactory.
Even in the count des where the most
favorable conditions existed, only an
insignificant percentage of women had
completed the various stages of educa-
tion and won distinction for their
scientific research. The famous names,
so often quoted, are exceptions that
divert attention from abasic inequality.
Five ta8k8 tor Unesco
t-x those countries where local condi-
. lions our social and religious traditions
- *-have stowed down the evolution 01
women, there is marked evidence 01 a
lack of education among women and an
absence of their influence. In otter
cases, where education has sudrIfmly
been made available to women, as in
Turkey for example, the result has
been an outstanding cultural progress
for the whole population.
In its programme for 1949, Unesco.
while making every efforts to make
known the Universal Declaration of
Human Rigttts. has 1'een carrying out. in

ties open to women. Could anything

hound to consider how it could help to
bring about the realization of educa-
tional equality for the sexes.
WHAT means should Unesco use to
acllieve this purpose ? It should
maintain a close collaboration
with the CN Commission on the Stalus
or Women, especially when the Com-
mission's work and recommendations
bear on educational problems. It must
also follow closely the policy of Mem-
ber States with regard 10 general
education, schools and universities.
It should see that special attention its
given to the problem of equal
opportunities in the consideration of
educational facilities for women, and
should diagnose the reasons for pa1t
and present discrimination, in order to
find elective and practical remedies.
Finally, it should, by employtng every
possible information medium, try to
win public support throughout the
world for equal educational opport-
unities for both sexes.
Among other matters to be considered
are the total lack of proportion between
the numbers of educated men anu
women in certain areas of Africa or in
countries bordering on the Indian
Ocean and the seeking out of the
various religious or economic causes
which vary from country to country.
This will be a task for èthnographlcàl
and sociological experts co-operating
with specialists on fundamental educa-
tion.
At present, It appears that there are
very few cases where there is a higher
proportion of educated women than
men, two examples being Basutoland
and Bechuanaland.
\\') ule Unesco's Department of Edu-
cation will naturally be required to play
a leading part in this task, it will also
be up to the Department of Mass
Communication to use everv means to
spread the idea of the right to educa-
tion, wherever it is still disputed or
ignored, bearing in mind differing local
conditions.

TilE Division of Exchange of Personsmust also see that women benefit
from the increasing number of
international exchanges brought about
by its work ; it must also encourage
private and governmental assistance for
the cultural emancipation of women.
The work of the Social Sciences
Department must include consideration
of the underlying reasons for educational
discrimination still existing between the
sexes : the conflicting interests of men
and women and the conflicts between
family and professional obligations
Inherent in women's special role in
society.
Independently of the United Nations,
Unesco should assemble information on
the subject, keeping it constantly up-to-
date, and should'make known Its
recommendations through the National
Commissions and international non-
governmental organizations.
Using science and technology
to transform nature's wastelands
IJ :'I the forefront of man's strug-glue against the elements Is
the battle of the barren lands.
About 20 millIon square miles
(nearly a quarter of the total
land surface of the globe) consti-
tute what are known as the Arid
Zones. It Is estimated that 66 per
cent of the earth's land surface
does not receive adequate and
reliable rainfall, while 31 per cent
may be classed as acrid or semi-
arid. not including tundra and
cold desert.
Mankind's battle Is on two
fronts. Firstly, means must be
found to stem the invasion of
the desert upon neighbouring
arable lands under cultivation.
Secondly, ways must be devised
by scientists and technIcians for
improving life In the arid and
semi-arid lands, and turning them
into valuable new food-producing
belts In regions where the world
Is most hungry. In the train of
new-found food resources may
come new industrial and cultural
strength, much of It built upon
or around land which was once
the site of former great clv1li-
stations.
With the aIm of consolidating
the equipment and knowledge of
all nations in this unceasing
fight. Unesco's Third General
Conference at Beirut In 1948.
approved the study of a proposal
for setting up an International
Arid Zone Institute.
Both before and since the Bei-
rut Conference, various scientists
and international scientific orga-
nizations have submitted c plans
of campaign * to Unesco includ-
ing short md long-term schemes,
! by which water may be utilized
more effectively to irrigate the
wastelands and render them pro-
ductive. to halt the encroachment
of the desert, and stamp out
diseases and pests.
Harnessing the Sun,
Winds and Tides
THE use of solar energy as afuel source in pumping
water, and the harnessing
of power from winds, tides, 011
and atomic energy, were among
basic projects recommended to
Unesco for long-term research in
a report on the Arid Zones sub-
mitted by the International
Union of Geodesy and Geophysics.
Among the possible ways of
obtaining water recommended by
this Union were the study of
means for obtaining subterranean
water from depths greater than
those at present exploitalble ; pos-
sible use of salt water through
de-salting or disti1ling ; M"titicial
rain production ; and the use of
tog and dew as sources of mois-
ture. For sanitation and health,
the association recommended the
study of climatic and geophysical
factors affecting disease, pests
and other nuisances ; and of durst,
heat and other limitations to
habitation.
For short-term consideration.
the International Union advocat-
ed the planning of a network ot
observing stations to collect geo-
physical data linked with the
solution at Arid Zones problems,
and the creation of means for
exchanging information and
experience reports between spe-
cialists of nations affected.
Mast of the reports submitted
to Unesco called for extensive
preliminary surveys before creat-
ing an institute. An informal
Arid Zones Study Group, called
by Unesco at Lake Success, pro-
posed the formation of an inter-
national federation of Interested
organization., 0 sift arid zone
problems.
Council to Study
Arid Zone Problems
The information given In fivemain reports from different
international organizations
was considered by a committee of
experts from five continents who
met In Unesco House last month.
Taking into account the work
already being done by national
services In different countries
either on a scientific level or
through direct action, the experts
felt that In the fields of basic
and applied scientific research,
fur'. her international co-operation
Is needed to strengthen existing
services. In addition, they con-
sidered that creation of new
services must be stimulated, espe-
cially In under-developed coun-
tries.
The Committee therefore re-
commended to Unesco that an
international council bye set up
to study the Scientific, technical
and resource development pro-
blems of arid and semi-arid
areas.
In view of the urgent need for
dealing expedlttously with the
problems of these areas, the com-
mlttee decided that the best way
was not the immediate setting
up of a comprehensive Institute of
the Arid Zone. but that the pro-
posed International Council. should
study this proposal and make
recommendations to Unesco.
Among the tasks assigned to
the proposed Council during its
first year would be the collection
and distribution of information,
particularly regarding problems,
programmes, methods and re-
search results relating to hydro-
logy and the exchange of person-
nel for research and training In
thisneld.
The Council's main objectives
would include the preparation of
a directory of scientists, engineers
and institutions engaged In re-
search and development, the call-
ing of periodic international
meetings and of symposia, if
possible close to arid areas, the
study of possible basic and
applied research programmes and
the setting up of new research
centres.

UNESCO AIMING FOR QUANTITY AND QUALITY
IN CLASSICS TRANSLATIONS
MANY translations give a distortedvie 01 the works they wish to
make known and, as a result, oj
the peoples 01 which these works are
an expression.
No translation, it is admitted, can be
absolutely identical with the original.
but it can provide a satisfactory equi-
valent.
And, at a time when man has never
had greater need to extend his horizon
and develop his understanding of
others, the importance 01 clarity in
spreading the messages of the human
mind has never been greater.
IT is for this reason that Unesco,in agreement with the United
Nations, is working both to add to
the translations of the world's great
books in every language and at the
same time to gradually bring them up
to the highest possible standard.
To assist in this work, Unesco re-
cently called a meeting in Paris of an
international committee of experts to
discuss plans for carrying out, under
Unesco's sponsorship, the translations
of the world's most important literary,
scientific and philosophic books.
Among the works which can be des-
cribed as classics, some are still too
little known and these Unesco proposes
to have translated into a few of the
chief world languages to bring them
before the cultivated public.
Others, on the contrary, are world-
famous as the common heritage of
mankind and these Unesco will try to
have translated into as many lan-
guages as possible.
The Committee of experts, who were
holding their second 1949 meeting.
submitted a number of recommenda-
tions to Unesco including one for the
establishment of an International
Bureau of Translations and another
for the publication by Unesco of a
quarterly Bulletin of Translations.
(In its last issue, the « Courier >&gt;
announced that Unesco had re-started
the publication of the Index Transla-
tionum.. handbook", and a report on
the Committee's proposal for a
"Translators Charter"is published
elsewhere on this page).
The Committee, which grouped ex-
perts from 14 countries under the
chairmanship of M. Julian Cain. Di-
rector of the Bibliotheque Nationale
in Paris, also approved two important
projects on which Unesco has already
started work.
The first of these is for the transla-
tion of the great books of the West
into Arabic and of the great Arab
classics into Western languages. This
work is being carried out by an Inter-
national Commission set up in Beirut
by the Lebanese Government and
Unesco, and which it is hoped will be
joined by other Arab States. Prog-rests
has already been made with the
translation into English French and
Spanish of Algazel's poem.. Ayuha'l
Walas. and of.. Don Quixote"into
Arabic.
The second project is the collection
of Latin American works in French
and English translations, made in
collaboration with Unesco's Member
States in this continent.
A plan has also been prepared for
the translation of great books into and
from Italian and in the near future
Unesco hopes to extend its translation
plan to India.

"HAVE YOU READ BARUCH ?"
f A Fontaine, it is said, was so impressedby the apocrypha !. books of Baruch that
for some time after reading them he
asked everyone he met : <&lt; Have you
read Baruch ? >&gt; and was surprised when
hardly anyone answered « Yes N.
To-day, if one asked of many people,
<&lt; Have you read The Dream of the Red
Room'or'Fortunata cmd Jacinta'by Gal-
dos' ? s or again <&lt; Have you read Charles
Doughtys's'Travels in Arerbia Deserta'
the answer would probably be <&lt; No ! >&gt;
For, although <&lt; The Dream of the Red
Room t is one of the great works of Classical
Chinese literature, scholars, other than those
capable of understanding the Chinese text.
have only been able to read an inadequate
translation, so abridged that only about one
sixth of the work can be appreciated.
<&lt; Fortunata y Jacinta. was written by the
l9th century Spanish writer, Benito Perez
Galdos, who has been described as the
greatest Spanish novelist since Cervantes.
Some of Galdos works have been translated
into several languages, but this, his most
important book, has been ignored by trans-
lators.
Doughty's <&lt; Travels in Arabia Desert..
one of the most unusual books on travel
and exploration, was also a long work and
was published at a very high price by its
author, who was not interested in fame. For
years it remained almost unknown to the
public until a second edition was published
in 1921 with a preface by Colonel T. E. Law-
rence.
<&lt; Lawrence of Arabia o said he had con-
stantly used the book as a guide while in
Arabia because of its accurate descriptions
of the country and its interpretation of the
Bedouin character.
it would be possible to quote many other
examples similar to these three to emphasize
the importance of the recommendation made
by the United Nations that Unesco should
arrange for a colledion of great works of
world-wide interest in as many languages
as possible.
WHAT IS
RACE ?
Racial questions, iing racial pre\u. ciice. d anta9o, zúsms a\e among the major
problems affecting into1 understan\Ïing which Unesco is studying.
As one step in the preparation 01 an. educational campaiqn aimed at combatting
racial prejudices. Unesco last mð.. th cal1<1d a meeting ot experts study and select

in the following article discusses some of the concepts owt race which were examined by
the committee.

Anthropologists have not, however, be. en t to describe Race only in

or cultural groups or even the va. cue conglb of men and women described
as a people or a folk. Its s aP} Jl1catlon to the. of language,, people or real-

10 was a public meeting of the
Swiss National Commission for
Unesco, in the City Hall at Berne.
This meeting, which served to

OLD AND NEW WORLDS
MEET AT ROYAUMONT
In the late middle ages, the
t monks of Royaumont Ab-
bey, like other members of
the Cistercian order were
helping to play a part in the
development of European civi-
lization. not only by religious
teachings, but through the
study and practice of agri-
culture.
The Cistercian monks were
the great farmers of those
days and many improvements
in farming operations were
introduced and propagated by
them.
To-day, at Royaumont Ab-
bey, some 20 miles from Paris,
different kinds of studies are
taking place, studies whose
aim is the development of a
world civilization through
international understanding.
For the last two years, this
beautiful French abbey, built
in 1227 by St. Louis and his
mother, Blanche of Castille,
has been the home of an
International Cultural Centre,
to which students, writers and
artists of all nationalities have
been coming to attend courses
of studies and lectures or
"decades"on the cultural
achievements of different
countries.
Royaumont has thus been
carrying on the tradition of
another great Cistercian Ab-
bey, that of Pontigny, in Bur-
gundy. where in 1903, a simi-
lar plan cf intellectual co-
operation was inaugurated by
the French writer and hu-
manist, Paul Desjardins.
And, in the same way that
famous writers, poets and phi-
losophers such as Jacques Ri-
viere, André Gide, Paul Valery
and Salvador de Madariaga,
used to meet at Pontigny, to-
day, writers and students from
all parts of the world find
their way to Royaumont.
whose Abbey, one writer said.
"rises like a miracle among
the trees of the lie de
France".
Royaumont Abbey, 1 i k e
many others, suffered damage
during the French Revolution.
when its church was destroyed.
but today it still represents a
"cavalcade"of French archi-
tectural history from the 13The
to the 18th centuries, and its
Gothic beauty, its dim, cool
cloisters and green lawns form
an ideal setting for its present
role.
Cells for Modern
"Monks"
A nd. it is well equipped forits new task. Students
live in what were for-
merly monks'cells. But these
have lost their monastic aus-
terity. Adequately furnished
and equipped with cenfr : 11
heating they combine the ne-
cessary atmosphere for study
and contemplation-peace and
quiet-with the modern requi-
rements for comfort.
The Centre has a library of
20, 000 books and a group 0<
people,"Friends of Royau-
mont Abbey"have helped to
establish a system of resident
scholarships under which
students are fed, accommodat-
ed, and can attend lectures at
a minimum cost.
People come to Royaumont
to discuss and learn about a
wide variety of subjects. Last
September, for example, 48
youth work camp volunteers,
representing 14 different na-
tionalities. returning from
summer camps in different
parts of Europe, interrupted
their homeward journey to
attend the first Unesco spon-
sored post-camp conference.
Once installed at the Abbey.
they got down to the business
for which the conference had
been called : The exchange of
first-hand experiences and
views aimed at making the
work camp movement a more
effective instrument for pro-
moting international good-
will.
More recently, a"decade"
on Latin America, aimed at
promoting intellectual rela-
tions between the Old and New
Worlds, was organized.
Picture Of A Continent
speakers. lecturing on thelife. art. literature and
music of Latin American
countries conjured up a pic-
ture of a Continent of whose
existence the original occu-
pants of Royaumont were com-
pletely ignorant.
In addition to sending an
observer. Dr. Jose de Benito,
Unesco also asked Dr. Alfred
Metraux, a well-known anthro-
pologist who has carried out
fundamental education work
for the Organization in diffe-
rent parts of the world, to
tor-General of Unesco, of the
desire for international under-
standing with which the df-
cade had been planned.
"As a Mexican", said
M. Torres Bodet,"I am pro-
foundly glad of your interest
in the intellectual and artistic
life of Latin America. Beyond
the informed circles you re-
present so eminently, and in
spite of the efforts previously
made by the International
Institute of Intellectual Co-
operation and continued to-
day by publishers, film makers
and the managers of theatres,
concert halls and art galleries,
too few Europeans yet know
our poets and musicians, no-
velists and painters.
"Most Europeans are still in
very much the same position,
as far as we are concerned, as
Christopher Columbus'con-
temporaries were with regard
to the civilization of the
Aztecs, Mayas or Incas, or as
the followers of Plato in their
mythical dreams of Atlantis.
The situation is changing ra-
pidly, I know, and I can only
thank the organizers of this
Decade and congratulate them
upon having taken such a step
and made it so great a success.

LUXEMBOURG :
A"VOICE"OF UNESCO
ADDRESSING the newly formed Luxembourg National Commis-sion lor Unesco. at its inaugural last month, M. Taime Torres
Bode. Director-General 01 Unesco, stated that the 300. 000
inhabitants 01 the Grand Duchy were among the best informed
peoples in the world.
The results of a Unesco survey into press, radio and film needs
of war devastated countries, he said, had shown Luxembourg to
have the highest number 01 newspapers per 1. 000 head 01 popula-
ition.'
"So far as broadcasting is concerned", said M. Torres Bodeb
"your voice can be heard throughout Europe, thoaks to the power-
lul Radio-Luxembourg transmitter ; from that station, you are publi-
cizing Unesco's programme and aims, and disseminating news
about our Organization and. in particular, about the international
work camps, in your"International Programme for Young People".
Luxembourg, whose people call it"Gutland" (the good land)
gave its support to the plan for Unesco's creation while its govern-
ment was exiled in London, and later attended the Preparatory
Conference, finally joining Unesco in 1947.
Judged by its area. the Grand Duchy is considered a small
country, but in difficult situations, it has always shown itself
capable of taking on a stature which has no relation to its physical
site.
During its history it has been occupied at different times by
Spanish. Austrians, French and Dutch. In 1867 the great powers
guaranteed its neutrality, but this did not prevent Luxembourg
being invaded and occupied in 1914 and again in 1940. Each time.
however, with no other power than an international guarantee, it
has regained its sovereignty.
speed with which they can be
exploited. We have to
discover what the men of
those countries can give the
men of the whole world. What
contribution to the progress of
all can be made by the human
clay shaped in those mighty
countries now that they, in
their turn, have joined the tre-
mendous and somewhat disor-
derly concert of common ef-
fort ?
"At the present time, the
peoples of all those countries
are conscious of a profound
unity and community of inte-
rests, not only in the sense of
the past they share but in the
awareness of a common future.
They are united, too, by the
same heritage of culture and,
above all, by the linguistic
associations which bind them
to the Latin world. Despite
political divisions and frontier
disputes, which, incidentally,
have not given rise to irreme-
diable antagonisms, Latin
America is the most united of
the continents.

JOSÉ CLEMENTE.'i >)',
OROZCO
- MANKIND W AS
HIS HERO
AT the close of UNESCO'S Fourth General Conference in October, Mr David Hard-
man, leader of the United Kingdom delegation, paid a tribute to the Mexican artist
Josh clement Orozco, whose death occured a few weeks previously.
"This Conference"said Mr Hardman"cannot be insensitive to the loss to the culture
of the world that the death of Orozco has caused. Born in 1886 for more than a gene-
ration he covered the walls of the palaces, churches and public buildings of Mexico with
his tremendous frescos, one of which, indeed, as many here will remember, adorned the
walls of the Escuela Normal, where our Conference was held in 1947.
"Through his frescos he sought to express his understanding and the yearning of the
common people of the world for all we, here, are searching to foster---for education in
understanding."
After M. Jaime Torres Bodet, Director-General of UNESCO, and Dr Antonio Castro
Leal, leader of the Mexican delegation, had replied to Mr Hardman, the Conference adopt-
ed the British delegate's suggestion that a message of condolence and regret be sent to
the Government of Mexico.
As a further tribute to this great Mexican artist, the"Courier"is presenting on this
page, an appreciation of Orozco written by Jean Cassou, the distinguishd French Hispanist
and Art Critic,.. ogether with reproductions of two of the artist's works.
THE history of European artduring the second half of the
19th century is a succession
of rebellions and adventures. It is
a story of heroic stature, and the
great artists who have played their
part in the making of it have an
aura of tragedy about them. Each
of these men carried his individual-
ism to a point of extremity. The
artist of the time occupied an
unfortunate social position, outside
society, and against society.
Gauguin and Van Gogh are
examples of the artist cast out
from society.
But, however much we may
admire them, these are not
examples to be followed indefinite-
ly. The unfortunate position of
the artist is not inherent in the
nature of things. He may come to
wish for a movement of co-opera-
tion between himself and society.
Today this co-operation works by
way of compromise and expediency,
such as snobbishness, fashion and
the speculation of dealers and art
collectors.
A broader, better coordinated and
more firmly established co-opera-
tion can be conceived, through
which society as a whole, rather
than a privileged minority, would
benefit from the artist's effort.
This society of the future would
entrust the monuments of its cul-
ture and tradition to the artist's
hand. The artist would be called
upon to construct the great public
buildings dedicated to the civic,
cultural and social activity of the
people.
This would be the ideal form of
reconciliation between the artist
and society. Modern art, which
formerlv was individualistic and
ostracized, will have reached its
perfect expression when it becomes
monumental. Art which limited
itself to small canvases will find
new forms of expression in mural
decorations and frescoes, as it did
during the great periods of history,
in the centuries of great civili-
zation.
And then this succession of
marvellous inventions and prodi-
gious innovations which we have
witnessed will find its glory, its
justification and its reward.

reinforcing the action. By choosing brutal themes and developing them to deliver the
sharpest impact. painters ot social reality like Orozco1 create new beauty in tragedy.
It was in depicting the past and present history 01 his country that Orozco portrayed the his-
tory of man's suffering, struggles and fulfillment. This painting illustrates one of the events in
Mexican revolutionary history when the'Zapatistas'. followers of General Emiliano Zapata.
revolted in support 01 aqrczrian reforms. at the beginning of this century. (Oil on canvas,
1931-Museum of Modern Art Collection. New York.)
Forelllu in this renaissance is
Diego Rivera, who, as a young man,
travelled in Europe and lived in
Paris, where he mingled with the
first Cubists of the : French school.
He has thus participated in the
experiments and innovations of our
modern art-that insurgent and
ostracized art-and his vast mural
epic is its ctimax and synthesis.
With him, modern art reaches mo-
numenta ! proportions.
His fellow countryman, Jose Cle-
mente Orozco, who has recently
died, came to know Europe later in
life. But he intuitively understood
and assimilated the efforts, the dis-
coveries and the daring trends of
modern European art, particularly
of French painting, and they have
served him as a point of departure
for his great compositions.
Jose Clemente Orozco was born
in 1883. He studied in Mexico and
witnessed his country's revolution.
He painted his first frescoes in
I ! J22. The problems which he faced,
which are the problems of mural
art, i. e. of social art, are the assi-
milation of style and expression. It
was necessary to transpose the sty-
lised, simplified, synthetic, geome-
trical, abstract vocabulal'v of
modern art into an expressi, : e Ian-
gunge and epic themes which could
he understood by the masses.
S IG : \'IFICili'\'T among his work bhis gigantic figul'e of Prome-
Iheus (1930), which must have been
a fascinating subject for Orozco. He
must have felt the necessity to
project this powerful religious
image-the image of human reli-
gion-of truly michelangelesque
character, for himself as well a
for his people.
Two years iater. upon hi ; ; return
from Europe, hê undertook the
freswes in the Dal'lmouU, CoJlege
Library, and following tliat.)) its
famous work al-Guadalajara and
Jiquilpan. Each new work added
to the scope and power of his art.
His last work, the vaults and walls
of the church of the Hospital of
Jesus (1942-1944), reaches new
heights of movement and grandeur.
CHRIST DESTROYING
HIS CROSS
THE revivalist dream wllkh ani-t mated Eu ope and particularly
France in the 19t century, and
which tried to express itself in
decorative painting, achieved real-
ity in the frescoes of Jose Clemente
Orozco. The history of man, por-
traved in this history of the Ame-
ricnn man, appears in all its dialec-
tical grandeur in those powerful
work. A continents and its II1vst er-ires transform their energy in the
drama of revolution. Prometheus
plays his heroic part against the
gods, man suffers, struggles and
fulfils himself ; it can be likened to
a symbol which belongs to Orozco's
carty work : Christ destroying his
cross.
The work of Orozco, this extra-
ordinary epic narrative of truly
hemispheric dimensions, reveals
the Mexican soul. Its forms, its
eombinations of forms, its plastic
sections, display a certain quality
of hardness, rigour and strength
which are profoundly characteristic
and correspond to deep organic
necessities. But this message is of
universal interest and concerns us
all. The Mexican man becomes the
cosmic man.
"Through the language of meta-
phors, signs and symbols", writes
his fellow countryman, Justino Fer-
nandez,"Orozco tells us that the
human reality is movement, con-
stant renovation, disintegration and
integration, death and resurrection."
When an artist, inspired by his
country's past and present history
and inspired by the genius of his
country, achieves a work of such
philosophical scope and such broad
significance, he raises himself and
his country to universal stature.
With Orozco, Mexican art, if it
remains rooted in its native soil,
reaches out bevond the frontiers and
becomes a message to humanity.
numental self-expression. A new
regime, will be ambitious to match
its great predecessors in history
which have left their mark upon
their century and have given it its
style.
But such an ambition is not
always very readily satisfied. The
example of the Mexican Revolution
is a noteworthy exception. This
revolution has had its artists from
the very beginning, and they have
known how to respond to the oppor-
tunity which was opened to them
to create a great social art. They
used the monumental form to
express the revolution, the spirit
of the people who had made it, their
past and present history, emotions
which they shared, and their des-
tiny. The contemporary Mexican
frescoes are one of the great achie-
vements of world civilization. In
them, art and i'society find them-
