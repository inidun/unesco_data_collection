The riddle in the skies
Vast in size and deeply mysterious in
o r i g i n , the universe stands as the gre a t e s t
challenge to the ambitions of modern
s c i e n c e. Cosmologists from around the
world believe the secrets of creation may
b e
just around the corner, and have spent
the last decades enriching and perfecting
their accounts of the big bang. But are
they really as close as they think? Can
science ever answer the eternal question:
why something rather than nothing?

◗ Imagination
Let us begin at the beginning,
at time zero. The universe is born
in unknown,possibly unknowable
circumstances. Billions of years later,
since the most ancient times, human
beings have marvelled at the night sky
and sought answers to profound
questions there. The frontiers
of cosmology explored in this issue lie
far beyond the human scale, giving
free rein to the imagination
(pp. 16-37).Myths of enchantment
and terror have always accompanied
the story of creation.In Latin
America,they are also nourishing
a new wave of storytellers, including
the Colombian Nicolás Buenaventura
(pp. 41-43).
◗ Exclusion
As part of the war on drugs,
Colombia’s coca crops are being
sprayed with a herbicide that is
threatening the health of close to half
a million people, driving them off
the land (pp. 10-12).Customs, poverty,
sexual violence continue to close
the school doors to millions of young
girls, notably in Africa and south Asia
(pp. 13-15).After civil war,
dictatorship or genocide, grievously
wounded societies have set up truth
and reconciliation commissions as
a path to pardon and recovery.
Countries as far apart as Bosnia,
Canada and Mexico are considering
the option (pp. 38-40). To give those
excluded from the information world
a voice, participants at the World
Social Forum in Porto Alegre adopted
the Internet as their chief weapon
for taking on the major media groups.
To end,Mark Anspach draws parallels
between the use of ritual sacrifice
in primitive societies to end internal
conflict and the anonymous victims
—another kind of sacrifice—ushered
in by the cold logic of the modern
marketplace (pp. 47-51).

Single parent:drugs drove the father away.
Ioften think back on this day last year. It was May 27,the day
after my birthday. I had just turned 28 and didn’t really feel
like going to work, but, as the Ukrainian expression goes,
“Hiba hotchech,mousych!” (“You must,whether you like it
or not!”).
Before the ambulance set off on the streets of Kiev that
m o r n i n g, I ran down the usual checklist.The doctor filled out
the call sheets, a co-worker checked the equipment. When
everybody was ready, we hit the road!
Our rescue squad answers all kinds of calls,but most of the
time we deal with cardio-vascular and gastric diseases,v a r i o u s
kinds of poisoning and,of course, trauma.
That day, from ten in the morning till four in the afternoon,
we drove through the city following a well-worn pattern. I
d o n ’t know if the capricious weather that spring had anything
to do with it, but there were a lot of heart attacks.We treated
some patients at home and brought others to the nearest
hospital.One man had dropped a 200-litre barrel on his leg
and paid for his lack of caution with a broken foot.
Then we had to deal with a car crash caused by two reckless
d r i v e r s. One was suffering from brain trauma and a chest
injury.The other was walking around desperately waving his
a r m s, trying to convince us that he wasn’t speeding and that he
hadn’t been drinking “too much”—just a few beers—even
though drinking and driving are against the law in Ukraine.
At around 5:30 p.m.,we received a call.A man,we were
told,showed no signs of life.We rushed to the scene. He was
h o m e l e s s, dead drunk and incapable of the slightest reaction.
And there we were, three young women—I was the oldest—
lifting this poor, dirty “divine creature” on to a stretcher and

But something else baffles me. We used to have a special
ward and rehab centres staffed by sturdy men for this kind of

mean the same thing as in the west. But recently, a few

quickly over, but my hands shook for a
long while. That time, we were lucky.

wonder about a few things. For example,

about a grove of juniper bushes whose fragrance is so subtle
that words cannot describe it.I am familiar with the scent of
roses, lilies and lavender, but that of juniper is still unknown
to me.
I’m also planning to see the Toplovski monastery, where
the martyred Saint Paraskeva lived. After the October

kolkhoz [collective farm] on the monastery’s land, and the
three sacred sources dried up. In the early 1990s, when the
property was restituted to the Orthodox church, the spring
began to flow again.Now, people come from everywhere on
pilgrimages to drink and touch the water. I know all that
from accounts and pictures. But now that I believe in divine

NELSON FREDY PADILLA CASTRO
CHIEF INVESTIGATIVE REPORTER OF THE MAGAZINE CAMBIO AND CORRESPONDENT FOR THE ARGENTINE DAILY CLARÍN
Toxic rain kills
m o re than the coca
The so-called “war on coca” in Colombia, backed by the United States, is destroying jungles and
forests, and threatening the health of half a million peasants and indigenous peoples
t frst sight, a coca leaf is nothing more
than an ordinary light-green leaf that
grows on a rather ugly bush.But if you
hold one up to the light,it turns yellow
and a system of veins appears that seems
to carry a substance towards the centre.
This is the narcotic over which 15,000
leftist guerrillas and 8,000 far- r i g h t
paramilitary troops are fighting in
C o l o m b i a . Each side’s secret military
structure rests on the underground
economy of growing and refining coca
l e a v e s. Drug trafficking has set off a war
in Colombia just as diamonds have in
Sierra Leone.
Over the last 15 years, t r a f ficking has
turned Colombia into a top national
security issue for the United States, the
world’s largest consumer of cocaine.As
such, the U.S. has a direct influence on
Colombia’s fight against drugs through
hefty budgets, military hardware and
other aid, along with the threat of
political and economic sanctions.
American involvement has increased to
the point that the so-called Colombia
Plan,the main programme of President
Andres Pastrana’s government, n o w
receives $1.3 billion in U.S. aid.
According to Pastrana’s reasoning, i f
all the coca planted in the country is
d e s t r o y e d , there will be no money left to
fight the war, allowing peace to be
negotiated with the outlawed groups.
No more cocaine would be sold on the
streets of American cities. Washington
supports this scenario. To achieve the
goal within five years,a military offensive
was drawn up, including the creation of
three anti-drug battalions and a fleet of
planes to spray the plants with a poison
called glyphosate.
Is this a good thing? Environmental
NGOs such as Acción Andina see it as a
scorched-earth policy and the European
Union criticizes the programme because
it provides no long-term solution for the
survival of communities that live off
growing coca. The government says at
least half a million people—450,000
peasants and 50,000 indigenous people—
depend directly on the crop for their
l i v e l i h o o d . Yet last December, t h e
authorities began large-scale secret
spraying of coca plantations with
g l y p h o s a t e, a pink liquid herbicide used
against all crop diseases.
A desolate
scene
Colombian officials from the
antinarcotics directorate of the national
police say 30,000 hectares of coca were
sprayed with the poison last Ja n u a r y.
Glyphosate has been used since 1984 to
kill marijuana plants.A decade later, t h e
government authorized its use in the
Andean highlands to eradicate a violet
poppy whose buds produce a thick white
liquid that forms the rubbery substance
from which opium, morphine and heroin
are refined.
Although glyphosate is banned in
several U. S. s t a t e s, including Florida,
where it was rejected as a way to
eradicate marijuana plants in the
Everglades region “because of its unclear
effects on the environment,” t h e
Colombian authorities cited research
funded by the country’s national farming
institute that ensures the chemical does
not pose a health risk to humans and is
o n l y slightly toxic for animals and plants.
To appease the growing chorus of

<![CDATA[
c r i t i c i s m , the authorities promised to
implement an environmental
management plan that would limit use of
the chemical to destroying illegal plants,
without harming the rest of the
environment or people. Six years later,
this plan remains a draft document on
the desk of environment minister Juan
M a y r. M e a n w h i l e, the poisonous rain
has now been sprayed over more than
300,000 hectares of jungle and forest.
National watchdog bodies such as
the office of the ombudsman have since
shown that glyphosate causes irreparable
harm to people and the environment
wherever it is used. The ombudsman’s
most recent study
was of the Colombia
P l a n ’s launch in
Putumayo province,
which borders
Ecuador and where
half the country’s
coca is grown.
R e p r e s e n t a t i v e s
of four indigenous
c o m m u n i t i e s
protested last
January 11 against
the damage
glyphosate had done to their staple crops
( m a i z e, b a n a n a s, manioc and other
v e g e t a b l e s ) , their health and the lives of
their animals. A delegation from the
ombudsman’s office, along with experts
from the UN High Commission for
Refugees (UNHCR), visited the area
between January 15 and 25 and reported
on what they described as a “desolate
scene.”There had been “indiscriminate
destruction of the jungle, legal crops,
medicinal plants and fis h - p o n d s.There is
clear evidence that wildlife has fled,
rivers are contaminated and production
in the region has fallen.”
Skin and gastro-intestinal problems,
f e v e r s, h e a d a c h e s, n a u s e a , colds and
vomiting were common among the
inhabitants, the mission observed. The
police and the national anti-narcotics
a u t h o r i t y, which are in charge of the
s p r a y i n g, argue that the herbicide is
dropped very accurately thanks to
satellite imagery and aerial photography
that pinpoint the exact location of the
coca plantations. But wind and the
weather means that the chemical can
overshoot the fields by up to 150 m e t r e s,
the ombudsman said.
The social consequences of this are
h u g e.Villages have been abandoned and
about 20,000 people have fled their land
in the face of the military campaign
against coca.Anticipating the arrival of
refugees, the UNHCR set up camps in
the border area of Lake Agrio (Ecuador)
halfway through 2000.“The evidence is
s t r o n g, so we’re calling for an immediate
halt to the spraying and for the
compensation of the victims whose
livelihoods are seriously threatened,”
says ombudsman Eduardo Cifuentes.
There is  no effective coordination, he
o b s e r v e s, between the various state
bodies involved in the government’s
anti-drug campaign
and those whose job
it is to protect the
environment.
Peasants like
Aicardo Loaiza
have to live in the
35-degree heat of
the coca plantations
and under the
constant threat of
the guerrillas, t h e
paramilitaries and
the crop-spraying
planes. L o a i z a ,4 8 , came to Putumayo in
1968 drawn by fortunes to be made out of
rice growing. To d a y, he has a wife, 1 3
children and has had enough of growing
coca “for the big shots.” He lives in the
Santana district and is trying to persuade
500 of his neighbours that the only
solution is to sign an agreement with the
government to pull up the coca plants by
hand themselves in exchange for an end
to spraying and subsidies to grow legal
c r o p s.
“Look at us. We ’re the embittered
children of this damn coca thing,” h e
says. “We’ve been doing it for 20 or 30
y e a r s. I t ’s left some of us ruined and
others in jail or in the cemetery.” He has
the hands of an expert coca gatherer, a
r a s p a ch í n, as the drug traffickers call
them,and they were the first to sign an
accord with the government to destroy
the coca plants “voluntarily and not
under threat of the poison.”For Loaiza,
this is the only solution.
In recent months, 5,000 families—
small-time growers with no more than
10 hectares of coca—have chosen this
path.These are people who harvest the
leaves between three and six times a
y e a r,pack them in bags and take them by
river to the nearest processing plant.
Amid or alongside the coca bushes, t h e y
grow bananas, manioc, maize, fruit and
medicinal plants. If these crops are
Colombia is the world’s main producer of
c o c a i n e, coca paste and cocaine base.
U. S. State Department figures from March
2000 say 140,000 hectares in Colombia are
planted with coca bushes, producing about
580 tonnes of pure cocaine a year. Coca does
not hold the same cultural importance in
Colombia as it does in Bolivia and other
Andean countries, although it has alwa y s
been used for medicinal reasons, especially by
the Indians living in Amazonia.But it is still
not legal to use it, as it is in some parts of
Bolivia. ■

sprayed from the air, t h e
families’ lives are destroyed in
one stroke.
The agreements signed by
the farmers stipulate that they
must uproot all their coca
plants within a year in
exchange for being included
in alternative development
s c h e m e s. The deal works in
L o a i z a ’s village, where a
factory to process palm-oil
and fruit has been set up to
enable the villagers who carry
out the deal to earn a living.
This would seem to be the
ideal solution for getting rid
of coca without further
damaging the eco-system, at
least in the eyes of peasants
and environmental
organizations. But the funds
set aside in the Colombia Plan
for such alternative
development are small
compared with the amount
for military operations and
s p r a y i n g.The U. S. is supplying
only $300 million for social
and economic substitution
compared with $1 billion for
military purposes.
A new strategy?
Another obstacle to the agreements
with the peasants is that they do not
attract the big-time coca growers, those
who have 100 hectares or more planted,
with hidden arsenals to protect them.
Gonzalo de Fr a n c i s c o, an aide to
President Pastrana, runs the Colombia
Plan in Putumayo province. Th e r e, h e
s a y s,“the government has no choice but
to use military means and aerial
spraying.”
The head of the national anti-
narcotics authority, Gabriel Merchán,
told the UN E S C O C o u r i e r that “the drug-
t r a f fickers are the ones who damage the
environment and nobody protests
against that.The arguments are all about
condemning the use of glyphosate
despite the fact we’ve used it in
accordance with national law and
international rules.” E n v i r o n m e n t
minister Juan Mayr agrees, and both
men insist the “drug traffickers have
deforested 600,000 hectares of jungle
and forest land and use 75 chemicals
more poisonous than glyphosate.”
Tomás León Sicard, a Colombian
National University researcher and
expert on the environment and
d e v e l o p m e n t , thinks the parties involved
should stop being politicians for a
moment and get to the heart of the
matter. This is urgent, he says, because
the fighting is taking place in very fragile
and biologically diverse rural eco-
systems, such as Amazonia. He calls on
the combatants to save them since “ t h e r e
is enough room for everyone on land in
the agricultural regions.”
Implementation of the Colombia
P l a n , massive spraying and peasant
protests have spurred the
environmentalists to
i n t e r v e n e. After a lot of
p r e s s u r e, the U. S. S t a t e
Department recently
admitted for the first time that
“errors” were perhaps being
made in the spraying
operations and that a new
eradication strategy might be
considered if an effective one
could be found.
Court action
For the time being, t h e
figures used by the anti-
narcotics officials themselves
show that the more land is
s p r a y e d , the more new land
is planted with coca. Th e
plantations simply move from
one province to another
because the conditions for
growing it are still all there—
p o v e r t y, u n e m p l o y m e n t ,
absence of the state, s o c i a l
conflict and a growing
demand for cocaine from
foreign markets.
In these circumstances,o n e
non-repressive solution is the
l a w. Environmental lawyers
Claudia Sampedro and Héctor
Suárez have persuaded a Colombian
administrative court to allow a demand
from a grassroots group for the
government to take responsibility for the
damage the spraying has done to the
environment and to people.
“ For the first time,Colombian society
is using the law to check that the
government respects the environment,
not just by recognizing the damage
caused,but by suspending the spraying
and taking preventive measures,” s a y s
S a m p e d r o, an expert in international
environmental law.
How can the authorities have been
spraying for more than 15 years without
taking any steps to protect the
environment? Who will take
responsibility for that and for the
irreversible damage that has been done?
The court will try to answer that very
soon because the debate is moving onto

Millions of girls are not making it into school, despite a concerted international movement to push
the cause forward. In some African countries, the gender gap is even widening.What’s gone wrong?
n Ethiopia, girls are sometimes abducted for
marriage when they’re no more than eight.I n
West A f r i c a , t h e y ’re recruited from poor
rural families to work as domestics in coastal
cities or neighbouring countries. In South
A f r i c a , a recent report by Human Rights
Watch warns that sexual violence and abuse
is hampering girls’ access to education.And
in Afghanistan,they’ve simply been barred
from school under the Taleban regime.
C u s t o m s, p o v e r t y, fear and violence: g i r l s
still account for 60 percent of the estimated
113 million out-of-school children, and the
majority live in sub-Saharan Africa and
South A s i a . In 1990, faced with a
deteriorating educational record in many
countries, the major development agencies
and 155 national governments rang the alarm
at a high-profile conference in Jo m t i e n ,
Thailand.Launching the Education for All
i n i t i a t i v e, ambitious targets were set, n o t a b l y
to get all children into school within ten
y e a r s, stressing that “the most urgent
p r i o r i t y ” was to ensure access to, and improve
the quality of education for girls and women.
Ten years later, in Dakar (Senegal), the world
community had to face up to the fact that
“gender discrimination continues to
permeate education systems”and that “ l i t t l e
progress has been made in increasing girls’
participation in basic education.” This time
r o u n d , they set 2015 as the date by which
“all children,particularly girls . . . complete
free and compulsory primary education of
good quality.” More boldly, they pledged to
eliminate “gender disparities in primary and
secondary education by 2005.”
For Christopher Colclough,a professor at
the Sussex-based Institute of Development
Studies (IDS), there is “no chance
whatsoever”of reaching the 2005 target.In
sub-Saharan A f r i c a , where he has led a nine-
country research project1 to diagnose

Girls account for an estimated 90 percent of child domestic workers. Few have a chance to attend school.

constraints to schooling and propose policies
to improve outcomes, the gap between girls’
and boys’ primary enrolment rates has
increased in some places. “ G o v e r n m e n t s
recognize that girls’ education is incredibly
important but their policies to tackle it are
usually inadequate,” says Colclough,
suggesting a “de facto political unwillingness”
to deal with the problem.S e c o n d l y, he notes
“if you have a situation where women and
girls are discriminated against in society and
not all children are in school, it follows almost
as night follows day that girls will be kept out
of school most.”
Not that the task is easy.In many countries
strapped by debt burdens, the goal appears
more elusive than ever, with families bearing
increasing costs for educating their children.
“A lot of girls are dropping out of school or not
being sent at all because of the poverty of
p a r e n t s,” says Peninah Mlama, e x e c u t i v e
director of the Forum for African Wo m e n
Educationists (FAW E ) , a partner in the IDS
s t u d y. “ Traditional cultural attitudes are still
very strong,especially in rural areas.The little
money parents have to scrounge for sending
children to school is seen as too big an
investment to risk on the girl child.”To make
matters worse, the HIV/AIDS pandemic is
cutting into a generation of young adults—in
S w a z i l a n d , it is estimated that three to four
teachers die every week of A I D S. In the
absence of a breadwinner, girls are the most
likely to be denied access to school to head a
h o u s e h o l d .
Hidden costs
While there is no magic bullet for solving
the quandary, there is little left to discover
about why girls stay on the sidelines,s t a r t i n g
with the number one factor, p o v e r t y.
“Although we can’t underestimate the role of
c u l t u r e, even in the most conservative
societies like rural Ye m e n , the vast majority
of families want to send their children to
school,and they will do so if you reduce the
c o s t s,” says Carolyn Wi n t e r, of the Wo r l d
B a n k . The problem lies in the complex
weaving of “social and economic forces that
overlap and strengthen each other,”
Colclough underlines. Waiving school fees
for example, does not address the question of
how to replace a girl’s valuable labour in the
home and the fie l d s,nor the profound bias in
some countries against educating daughters.
Nor does it recognize the hidden costs of
s c h o o l i n g, from clothing to textbooks.
Recruiting more female teachers, a n
indisputably positive influence, is only truly
b e n e ficial if parents are informed of their
presence, if textbooks are revised to cut out
stereotypes and training tackles attitude
q u e s t i o n s. In all the countries where they
conducted research, the IDS team found that
teachers believed that boys were more
intelligent….And when chores have to get
done like cleaning the classroom, girls are
naturally expected to oblige.
“If there is one lesson we have learned,
i t ’s that there is no single quick fix , but there
are usually to two or three actions together
that are catalytic,” says Mary Joy Pigozzi, a
senior UN I C E F education advisor. Two are
proven musts: getting parents and
communities involved in schools, a n d
improving quality. Most importantly, s a y s
P i g o z z i , quality has be thought about in
“ e n g e n d e r e d ”terms through an “ a f fir m a t i v e
a c t i o n ” approach that takes into account
where the learner is coming from:“ You have
to understand that girls may get less protein
than boys, that communities raise girls to
have different expectations of themselves.
Then you have to look at the quality of the
learning environment to address issues such
as safety and sexual harassment, and the
whole teaching-learning process.”
Understanding the critical things that
make a difference is one part of the story, t h e
other is how countries go about changing
their ways. “Nearly every single policy
document mentions girls’ education, i t ’s
almost as if it’s the politically correct
language to use,” says Mlama. “ B u t
governments don’t have the capacity and
commitment to really do something.” Many
education ministries, for example, have set up
gender or girls’ education units,“often staffed
by one or two people who don’t have the
skills and capacity to influence overall
educational policy.”In meetings on education
reform, she continues, “they’ll be called in
towards the end of the process or at the fin a l
meeting with donors.”
Addressing the bias
Outside pressure is founded upon
irrefutable evidence: educating girls and
women has a significant impact on reducing
poverty. Benefits include lower fertility and
infant mortality rates, better health and
n u t r i t i o n , higher productivity and chances
that the next generation will in turn be
e d u c a t e d . But shaking up bureaucratic,
patriarchal structures might well be the most
mammoth task of all.“Civil structures are
often set up so that there is very limited
incentive to invest in improvements and
work towards goals and targets,”says Wi n t e r.
Some examples of good practice involve
skirting slow bureaucracies and vested
interests. In India,for example, the state of
Uttar Pradesh took advantage of a law on
developing charities to set up a well-staffed
“ p a r a l l e l ” structure to push through a
comprehensive package on girls’ education
in rural areas.Women in the community walk
girls to school, parent-teacher associations
and principals reach out to homes where
children aren’t enrolled, and local groups
stress to mothers that schooling is a basic
legal right.
Such fine-tuned strategies can only bear
fruit when countries are ready to take the
first step, by addressing deeply set biases in
their societies. Committed governments, say
a c t i v i s t s, can start changing the tide, f r o m
making education compulsory to delaying the
age of marriage and opening their eyes to the
realities of child labour. Otherwise, ten years
down the road, millions of girls will still go
missing from the classroom,keeping the wheel
of poverty turning. ■

hen in 1992, community schools came to
the e z b a h—hamlets along the Nile that are
islands amidst an arid desert landscape—
they started from scratch, in places with no
basic services. While some districts are
notorious for their seclusion of girls and
w o m e n , the overriding obstacle to schooling
was distance and economic duress. “ We
wish all girls, women and men of the village
would get an education,” said an elderly
man from Helba, a hamlet in the governate
of Assiut,“but we cannot afford it,nor can
we allow our girls to go to far places on
their own.”
In most rural areas of the south, girls’
net enrolment rates range from 50 to 70
p e r c e n t , compared with 90 percent
nationally. In the most extreme cases, only
12 girls are enrolled for every 100 boys.
Although the government tried to reach
these groups in the 1970s through small
multigrade schools, population growth,
combined with economic strife and
teachers’ low qualific a t i o n s, led to high
absentee rates, and the initiative gradually
disappeared.
From the outset, we were in this
endeavour with communities and the
Ministry of Education. Communities donate
s p a c e, ensure that children come to class
and manage the schools through an
education committee in each hamlet. The
Ministry pays facilitators and provides
textbooks while UNICEF is responsible for
the overall development of the programme.
Lifting the economic barriers was a fir s t
s t e p : rooted in communities, the schools
are close to the home. Timetables are
flexible and all hidden costs are knocked
out, from uniforms to schoolbags. But the
other pivotal dimension is quality. Parents
take it for granted that their sons will go to
school. This is not the case with girls: you
have to prove the experience is worth it.
Tapping
creative talents
Our model relies on active learning.
After intensive training,young facilitators—
women chosen from the area with an
intermediate school certificate—know how
to transform the contents of the government
curriculum into activities, such as cards,
games, etc. They enhance it with subjects
suited to local interest, such as health,
e n v i r o n m e n t , agriculture and local history,
and  encourage self-directed activities,
learning by doing and in small groups.
A plethora of hand-made curricula has
flourished over the years, which were on
loan to the curriculum development centre
for a year.The centre invited the facilitators
to help produce learning guides in math
and Arabic for grades one to three, which
will be distributed to some 3,500 multigrade
classroom schools in rural areas.These have
been launched by the government, on the
basis of the community school model.
Now we are designing teacher training
in tandem with government and
implementing it ourselves:in short,we are
training a whole new corps of inspectors,
s u p e r v i s o r s, headmasters and teachers in
this new “active learning” p e d a g o g y. We
are gradually negotiating with regular
schools to assess children’s achievement
other than through regular exams.
If we are making headway, it is also
because we have been fortunate to benefit
from highly committed policy m a k e r s. Fr o m
the outset, the initiative has not been
regarded as a project, but as a contribution
to national educational reform. Since 1995,
an Education Innovations Committee has
been systematically working to incorporate
new pedagogies in mainstream schools.
Beyond reaching the hard to reach,n a m e l y
g i r l s, this model is showing the way to
changing the classroom experience for all.
Since the programme was launched, w e
have reached some 6,000 children, a n d
female enrolment stands at 70 percent. Th e
real barrier lies in girls continuing their
education, even though evaluations show
that our graduates pass government exams
with flying colours.The first lady,a longtime
defender of education,has given prizes to
community school graduates, to the tune
of nationwide media coverage. Wi t h i n
communities, the schools are catalysts for
more profound changes: we are seeing
facilitators publicly declare they will only
marry a man who lets them continue
t e a c h i n g, and 12-year-olds convincing their
parents to postpone marriage until they
g r a d u a t e. S l o w l y, girls are gaining a voice in
areas far from the city walls. ■

our hundred years ago, Giordano Bruno suffered an unenviable fate: h i s
tongue gagged, the Italian astronomer was burnt at the stake for
m a i n t a i n i n g , among other things, that each star in the sky is a sun like
our own and space is infin i t e. L i ke it or not, modern science has proved
him largely right. Our universe is of daunting size, mysterious origin and
unfathomable purpose.
The frontiers of cosmology explored in this issue lie far beyond the
human scale. Using the renowned big bang theory of creation (pp. 1 8 -
2 0 ;p p. 2 6 - 2 7 ) , scientists have deployed telescopes, mathematics and
particle collisions to plunder further through the first moments of time. Could an
i n c o n c e i vably fast expansion have ballooned the early universe (p. 21)? Might we
inhabit a distorted strip of reality, unable either to observe the deep structure of matter
(pp. 22-23) or discern the vast optical illusion that is in fact the universe (pp. 24-25)?
Yet while each new theory strives to fill a gap in our understanding, science may be nearing
its own limits. The sheer improbability of life remains unexplained (pp. 28-29),while no
cosmic theory seems free of deep
metaphysical assumptions (pp. 3 0 -
31).Centuries after being displaced
from the heavenly bodies, could God
once again be the answer to our
doubts (pp. 32-35)? Or is that just a
get-out clause, to be replaced by a
theory of multiple recycled universes
not unlike those of Hindu myth (pp.
35-36)?
The consolations lie in awe of our
ineffable and sublime origins. Th e
cost may be in knowing (see the short
story on p. 37) that all we leave
behind is a very faint noise.

Since ancient times, people have
marvelled at the night sky and sought
answers to profound questions there. What
are the heavenly bodies? What moves them?
How do they affect one another? Where are
they? And how do they affect us? These are
questions of cosmology, and each age and
culture has produced its own answers.
To the modern astronomer, acceptable
answers come from physics. But if I may
point my telescope not just towards deep
space but also back in time, I would suggest
that modern answers continue to draw upon
deep-seated cultural values.
R e l i g i o n , social practices and
observational astronomy have long been
intertwined in the development of
cosmological beliefs.The ancient Egyptians
observed the dawn risings of key stars and
from them established not only their
agricultural calendar and civil timekeeping,
but also their religious rites. Two thousand
years of observations gathered by
Babylonian astronomer-priests gave rise to
mathematical planetary astronomy, w h i c h
Greek philosophers such as Aristotle used as
the basis for their physical models of the
cosmos. Aristotle’s cosmos was structured,
hierarchical, finite, and compatible with the
tenets of Christianity, Ju d a i s m , and Islam.
God was Prime Mover of the planets and the
unmoved foundation of a stable world
system.
In the 17th century, the A r i s t o t e l i a n
cosmos gave way to the Newtonian world
view. Looking out into an infinite universe,
Isaac Newton showed how the motions of the
stars, planets,and comets were all governed
by universal gravitation.Comets circulated
vital spirits and fuel to the stars, but could
also slam into worlds, causing mass
extinctions and global destruction.
In 1755, Immanuel Kant offered a
physical theory on the origin and evolution of
the universe. He described how universal
forces of attraction and repulsion,acting on
matter diffused throughout space, gave rise to
instabilities in the chaos, leading to physical
and chemical complexity. Denser regions
gravitationally attracted lesser ones, w h i l e
the action of repulsive forces caused in-falling
matter to swirl around the dense centres.
Over time, these vortices collapsed into stellar
systems containing suns, p l a n e t s, and comets.
Creation thus spread out from a central
point into the chaos and animated the whole
region of infinite space. But Kant observed,
“whatever has a beginning and origin,has the
mark of its limited nature in itself; it must
perish and have an end.” When a world-
system exhausted all the manifold variations
that its structure could embrace, it perished
in a violent confla g r a t i o n .The universe was,
Kant envisioned,a “phoenix of nature,w h i c h
burns itself only in order to revive again in
restored youth from its ashes, through all
the infinity of times and spaces.”
K a n t ’s book was one of the earliest
attempts to describe the origin and evolution
of the cosmos under the influence of
universal natural laws. Prior to Kant,it was
commonly held that creation was fixed and
the universe was maintained in a steady state.
So where did Kant’s modern evolutionary
ideas come from? From popular culture as
remade by Newton.
Until the 17th century, people believed
that comets were divine signs heralding
imminent world change. Newton appropriated
this popular belief when he portrayed comets
as natural agents deployed by God to create,
r e n o v a t e, or destroy heavenly bodies, t h u s
melding popular beliefs with physics.This new
approach gave license to those who held that
material forces created new solar systems and
the universe evolved according to natural laws.
If popular beliefs were formative in the
early development of modern cosmology,
should we be worried that they continue to
sully current science? Not at all.We can still
celebrate the ways our diverse cultural
heritages have shaped our scientific inquiries.
Cosmology is ultimately a human endeavour.
In asking questions about the deep past and
distant future, it draws from many rich
traditions and brings us closer together as
human beings. ■

From b a n g to e t e r n i t y
The big bang is now the accepted scientific account of how the universe
came into being and started to evolve, but there is still much left
to discover
1 . SCIENCE AT THE LIMITS
C
osmology aims to determine the nature of
the universe on the largest observable scales,
and then explain how it got to be the way it
now is.Dismissed for a long time as a largely
philosophical enterprise based on a few sparse
o b s e r v a t i o n s, this branch of science has undergone an
extraordinary transformation in the last 50 y e a r s,
becoming a compelling body of knowledge about the
u n i v e r s e, rich in data and tied to the most pioneering
advances in nuclear and particle physics.
On the one hand, the discipline relies on telescopes
of all kinds and their associated measuring instruments
and computers,amplifying and analyzing the incredibly
faint radiation1 from very distant matter.O b s e r v a t i o n s
of apparent size, radiation fluxes and numbers of distant
galaxies and quasi-stellar objects can now be obtained
up to almost inconceivable distances. When twinned
with theories of physics—namely mathematical laws
that characterize how matter and radiation behave—
the result is something that few scientists a century
ago would have believed possible: a “physical standard
m o d e l ” of cosmology, comprehensive enough to take us
back to the first few seconds of the universe’ existence,
when atomic nuclei formed. Less defined and more
speculative science promises to take us even further,
possibly back to the very threshold of creation.
The basic structure of the visible universe on the
largest scales is now well understood: there are vast
domains of empty space more or less uniformly
populated by clusters of galaxies, with each galaxy
itself being a dynamic configuration of about 100 billion
stars interspersed with dust and gas.
F u r t h e r m o r e, the fundamental motion of the
cosmos is known: a uniform expansion of these clusters
of galaxies,with distances between them ever- i n c r e a s i n g
equally in all directions. If we extrapolate backwards in
t i m e, this movement would suggest an ever higher
density and temperature of matter and radiation,w h i c h
at a certain point in the distant past—in conditions of
the most extreme heat—coupled tightly together.
Estimates of an origin to this expansion indicate it
began around 10 billion years ago.

<![CDATA[
At the extreme temperatures (over a billion degrees
centigrade) of this initial phase, matter existed only as the
most elementary particles in equilibrium with radiation.
No more complex structures could survive the
bombardment of the radiation at those temperatures.
But as the universe expanded and cooled,successively
larger and more complex units could form: first of all,
within the very first second of the cosmos, protons and
neutrons from quarks, thus far among the most
fundamental units of matter yet known to exist.Th e n ,o n l y
minutes after the universe began, these protons and
neutrons could combine into light atomic nuclei, a process
known as nucleosythesis.
Some 300,000 years later,
complete atoms were
constructed from nuclei and
electrons—an episode called
r e c o m b i n a t i o n. This event
allowed the radiation,which had
previously been trapped by the
floating electrons, to separate (or
decouple) from matter and flow
freely for thousands of millions
of light-years, cooling all the
while due to the expansion of the universe from a
temperature of about 3,000 degrees Kelvin at emission
to 2.75 Kelvin (–270 degrees centigrade) today. This
r a d i a t i o n , known as the cosmic microwave background
radiation,provides the best map we now have of the
very early universe.
Once complete atoms were formed—mainly in the
shape of hydrogen and helium—gravitation could pull
matter together to form the first generation of stars,
which clustered together to form galaxies, which in
turn bunched together to form clusters of galaxies.
Some of the first generation stars ended their lives
in massive supernova explosions, spreading through
space the elements of organic life they had been
forming in their interiors through successive nuclear
r e a c t i o n s. The resulting clouds of dust then became
the birthplace of second generation stars, surrounded
by planets, on which the molecules of life could find
hospitable places to generate the first living cells and so
provide the origin of complex living beings (see also
pp. 26-27).
There are three basic reasons for believing this
picture of our universe’s history.Fi r s t l y, estimates of the
distances of galaxies (obtained
for example from their
luminosities) can be correlated
with estimates of the speed at
which they are moving away
from us (deduced from their
measured redshifts2) . The data
shows that the further away the
galaxies are, the faster they are
receding from us, thus providing
basic evidence for the expansion
of the universe. S e c o n d l y, t h e
very existence of the cosmic background radiation is
evidence that there was a hot early state of the universe,
because its precise spectrum—exactly described by a
theoretical formula deduced by Max Planck 100 years
ago—shows that matter and radiation were in
equilibrium at early times. Such equilibrium indicates
that the early universe was very hot, for only at extreme
high temperature can this balance come into being.
A third piece of evidence comes from observation
of the abundance of light elements in the universe,
namely hydrogen, helium and lithium. Our theory
What are the major issues that remain for us to tackle? First,we want
to know more about the geometry of the universe, both inside and
outside the limits we can observe.The part of the universe we can see seems
to be remarkably simple on the largest scales,being spatially homogeneous
and isotropic (it looks the same in all directions). But the major parameters
describing this region are only loosely known. Uncertainty in our estimates
of the universe’s age is about 20 percent, and needs to be improved, as do
our estimates of the dark energy that is causing an accelerated expansion
of the universe. We also want to know if sections of space close up on
themselves, and if so, whether the scale of closure is such that we live in a
“small universe” where we see multiple mirror images of the same galaxies
(see pp. 24-25).
Second,we want to know more about what the universe is made of. It is
disappointing that we don’t know what kind of matter makes up the lion’s
share of the density of the universe, nor the nature of the force that
presently dominates its expansion. Better understanding of these features
is intimately tied in to a better understanding of the creation of large-scale
structure in the universe.
Third,we want to understand the very early universe better:in particular,
what caused the mighty cosmic inflation? What came before inflation? W h a t
was the nature of creation,and what alternatives are there to creation?
Though there are a wide variety of competing proposals, it proves very
d i f ficult to test them experimentally.To help resolve these,we need to extend
our understanding of particle physics as far as we can so as to probe the
interactions at work at the moment of creation and immediately thereafter.
However far we extend experiments probing this physics, we will
nevertheless be unable to attain the energies required to unlock
experimentally the secrets of quantum gravity.
There are thus clear limits to the testable laws of physics that underlie the
cosmological account of creation.The challenge is to develop a coherent and
convincing physical theory that is supported by tests insofar as they are
possible.
Fo u r t h , we must grapple with the question of how to relate theory to
o b s e r vation in the exceptional context of a science with only one object of
study—the single existing Universe.We lack a proper account of the limits
of scientific proof in this context. One attempt to break this impasse is
through the idea of an ensemble of universes (a “ m u l t i v e r s e ” ) , but it is not
clear yet if this is a physical or a metaphysical proposal. ■

quantum flu c t u a t i o n s3 in this early force created areas
of marginally different densities. E x p a n s i o n , fir s t
i n flationary and then decelerating, may then have
spread such tiny variations over regions the size of
galaxy clusters. From these beginnings, matter could
then be pulled by gravity over billions of years into the
stars and galaxies we are now so familiar with.
Fi n a l l y, some current studies of distant spectra give
tantalizing hints that the nature of physics itself may be
different at great distances, in places whose radiation
emissions we are receiving billions of years after they
were emitted. Might it be that
the constants of nature vary with
time? If so, this would be a
discovery of groundbreaking
significance.
The next few years and
decades are certain to see a
massive extension in the quantity
and quality of cosmic
o b s e r v a t i o n s. These will be
accompanied by enriched
theories of how matter clustered
to form galaxies and a deeper
exploration of gravity,both of which will help determine
the model that best fits our observable region of the
universe.
But even once this model is drawn,a host of elusive
issues await.How should we link what we understand
of quantum gravity4 to cosmological theory—especially
the creation of the universe? What of the possibility that
the laws of nature were different in the early universe?
And how common is life in the universe? Could one in
any other way create a universe allowing intelligent life
to exist?
This sets the framework for considering major
philosophical issues within the context of the
uniqueness of the universe. Science per se can never
resolve these issues, but it can at least provide an ever
o f how atomic nuclei were formed in the hot early
u n i v e r s e, based on knowledge of nuclear physics
together with the hypothesis of an expanding universe,
fits all these measurements just so long as the density
of matter lies in a specific limited range—a remarkable
confirmation of theory by observation.
As a result, this cosmological history has come to be
accepted by the scientific community. We have clear
evidence that the universe emerged at vast speed from
an initial fir e b a l l , though this event’s remoteness—and
the enormity of space—obviously leaves a host of
questions waiting to be answered,particularly as we try
to understand its origins.
Recent observations have nevertheless filled in
many details of the universe’s structure and history.We
have been able to obtain estimates of the amount of
matter in the universe,particularly from studies of the
motions of galaxies and clusters of
g a l a x i e s. On the basis of these
f i g u r e s, we have been able to
deduce the presence of a large
amount of mysterious “ d a r k
matter”—matter which can’t be
detected by emitted radiation
such as light because it is simply
not shining. By comparing these
estimates of the amount of dark
matter (about 95 percent of the
u n i v e r s e ’s mass) with those
coming from the nucleosynthesis
calculations mentioned above, we can deduce that
most of this matter is not composed of protons and
n e u t r o n s : in short, that it has an entirely different make-
up to that of ordinary matter.
We have also been able to get much better distance
estimates than before for faraway galaxies,p a r t i c u l a r l y
by observing supernovae explosions in them and
measuring the decaying light from these death throes of
burnt-out stars. This has led to another unexpected
d i s c o v e r y.We expected the expansion of the universe to
be slowing down because of the gravitational pull of all
m a t t e r,but in fact it seems to be accelerating.This must
be attributed to some form of dark energy which, u n l i k e
the dark matter referred to above, acts like a negative
gravitational fie l d , tending to make all matter move
ever faster apart. C o n s e q u e n t l y, it now seems clear that
the universe will expand forever.
Theories of how galaxies and galaxy clusters arose
have also been subject to intensive research. B y
connecting data on the gravitational effects and
distribution of galaxies with minute temperature
fluctuations across the sky in the cosmic background
r a d i a t i o n , we have been able to construct broad pictures
of how large-scale structures emerged from small
variations in density in the early universe.
Yet these findings leave a major question begging:
how can we possibly explain why the universe is so
homogeneous (i.e. uniform) in all directions while also
hosting from very early on in its existence minute
differences in density that served as the seeds of future

Why do we need a period of inflation in the
universe’s early history?
I n flation explains several different things: w h y
the universe is large, why it is homogeneous, why
it looks approximately the same in all directions,
why it started expanding simultaneously. It also
explains how galaxies have been formed out of
quantum fluctuations.
Above all, we need to explain why different
parts of the universe look approximately the same.
Imagine that the universe just started.At the very
earliest time we can consider [10-43 seconds after
c r e a t i o n , called the Planck time],our universe was
a fraction of a centimetre. In this time, light and
radiation could only have travelled a tiny part of
this space.So the left side of the universe could not
know about the right, and the middle about neither
of them:there was no time for such contact.Then
all of a sudden we have a universe where
everything is exactly the same. This looks like a
miracle—something physicists do not expect.
This is where inflation comes to the rescue. In
the simplest version of the theory, inflation starts
at the Planck time.Until 10- 3 5 s e c o n d s, space would
blow up by the power of 10 to the thousand billion,
rather like an elastic membrane stretching in all
possible directions at a speed faster than light to a
size much larger than the universe you now see.
Our universe would then be a tiny spot on a huge
cosmic balloon.
Is there any matter inside this expanding space?
Usually people understand by matter particles
that move,collide and build solid things that we can
s e e. But there are also fie l d s — e l e c t r o m a g n e t i c
fields for example. We do not see the magnetic
field of the Earth, but we know that it is there.
This field is also a kind of matter.
Our assumption is that in the early universe,
matter was in a very specific form called a scalar
fie l d . We do not see this field—it looks like a
vacuum—but if it exists it may have a lot of
e n e r g y. In a normal expanding universe the
density of matter decreases,but the scalar field and
its energy do not decrease, meaning space expands
faster and for a much longer time. This leads to
inflation.
G r a d u a l l y, h o w e v e r, the scalar field loses
energy. It decays and produces normal particles,
and the universe becomes hot as in conventional
big bang theory.
But where did these scalar fields come from?
They could exist in the universe from the very
beginning, just like any other matter.Those parts
of the universe where these fields were small did
not experience inflation and therefore remained
very small.But regions of the universe with large
scalar fields have grown up enormously.We live in
one such region now.
You have used the expression “cosmic tre e ” t o
describe the true universe. What does this mean?
Small fluctuations in the field are necessary for
the later formation of galaxies. But if the
fluctuations in this field are large, they could lead
to the creation of new parts of the universe—not
just galaxies, but places where the fields have
different values, particles are lighter or heavier,
and space and time different as compared to our
part of the universe.These are so far away from us,
h o w e v e r, that you will never have a chance of
seeing them.
You also call this inflation eternal. Does this mean it
can happen again?
It may happen at some distance from us now.
It might also happen here, though you are not
going to see it because inflation occurs when space
is expanding from its own resources. If inflation
happens near you,don’t worry—it’s not going to
crush you. I t ’s just going to create a baby universe
that you will not see.
Twenty years ago,when inflation was invented,
it looked like a piece of science fiction.Gradually
it has become the standard cosmological theory,
solving many problems and making important
predictions that can be experimentally confir m e d .
We ’ve tried hard doing something without
inflation,but so far nothing else has worked. ■

What came b e f o re
Do the secrets of the universe lie within the atom? Could a 27-kilometre tunnel
reveal the deep truth?
1 . SCIENCE AT THE LIMITS
R
everse the film of our universe’s history,
and things seems to get mighty strange in
the last reel. What began in physical
h a r m o n y, propitious for planets, h u m a n s
and domestic appliances, has reverted to
h e l l :temperatures hotter than the sun’s core, an exotica
of hysterical matter, forces rupturing asunder. N u d g e
the reel a bit further on, and the image abruptly
switches from fury to a vague and peaceful nothing.
It is not an ending—or rather a beginning—that
s a t i s fies too many people.Though little headway has
been made exploring this peculiar transformation of
nothing into hot and very excited everything, t h e
issue has not been absent from scientific minds. I f
only to combat the allure of a “God particle” bent on
generating the cosmos, science has searched for an
alternative:not just a history of before the big bang,
but some deeper reason for why, out of unfathomably
chaotic stuff, should emerge a place where a hair-
dryer works.
Gabriele Veneziano is one of those who believes
an answer may have been found.According to this
leading Italian theoretical physicist,a deeper reality
lies “under”the one we perceive. Superstrings, to be
p r e c i s e, vibrating away in 10 or 11 dimensions,c r e a t i n g
and composing the entire universe from their
minuscule shudders.
Deciphering his account of how the universe
came to be reads like an odyssey through 20t h c e n t u r y
p h y s i c s. Superstring theory,and its many cousins in the
domain of elementary particle physics, are offshoots
of the two great theoretical inventions of the century’s
first decades—general relativity and quantum
m e c h a n i c s. On the basis of the fir s t , a convincing
picture of the universe could be drawn back to an
initial point, or “ s i n g u l a r i t y,” of massive, p o s s i b l y
i n finite density. Through the quantum world, v a s t
leaps could be made in penetrating the atom, t h e
components of the atom (protons, neutrons and
electrons),and then,colossal equipment and minds
p e r m i t t i n g, the components of the components of
the atom.
Slam and see
At that point, the two theoretical roots join as one.
Assuming the universe is created in a blazing,
primordial soup, then clearly the most basic units of
matter will be those that prevail. Finding out what
rules govern them is then the golden bridge towards
understanding how the universe was made.
Until the end of last year, a palm-sized pipe
wrapped in potent magnets and circling beneath the
Franco-Swiss border was the world capital for such
i n v e s t i g a t i o n s.Along this 27-kilometre pipe, a pair of
electrons would pass 11,000 times a second—close to
the speed of light—before hurtling to a splintering
c o l l i s i o n . Such is CERN, the European laboratory
for nuclear research. The principle is simple: s l a m
and see.
Behind the principle lies a very basic formula,
Einstein’s E=mc2, which establishes an equivalence
between energy and mass. Accelerate a subatomic
particle like an electron or proton, crash it into a
p a r t n e r, and the energies accumulated in its light-
speed dash will be scattered into more massive, very
short-lived particles—exactly the sort of particles
that reigned in the early universe before gluing
together as space cooled.
The appetite of scientists has naturally not abated.

s e a r ch might also usher

By 2005,a new accelerator is due to be operating at
C E R N : the Large Hadron Collider, armed with a
magnetic field 100,000 times that of the earth,
interspersed with six-storey high detectors and able to
take subatomic conditions back to those which held in
the universe’s first picosecond (10- 1 2 s e c o n d s ) . “ We
are going to be able to probe distances inside matter
which are perhaps ten times smaller than we’ve seen
before,” explains John Ellis, a senior physicist at the
laboratory.
Through theoretical work and experiments at
this and other accelerators, scientists have already
disaggregated the atom and the forces that rule its
movements into a menagerie of over 60 particles.A
story of the universe has emerged:a tale of descent
from high to low energy, in which primitive forces split
(creating electricity), and unstable fundaments of
matter convert their mass into the astonishing
energies inhabiting every atom.
The staircase of universes
But the story is far from complete. It may be very
well to enumerate and calculate the powers of quarks
and spins of photons, yet how could such an
encyclopaedic set of characteristics sprout so level-
headedly from a meltdown? Perhaps more
importantly, where does gravity fit in? Its supposed
f o r c e - c a r r i e r, the graviton, has never been observed.
The force itself appears alien to quantum theory.
And its strength for each atom is derisory compared
to the belligerence of the nuclear and electromagnetic
forces:how else could a chair buttress you from the
entire gravitational attraction of the planet?
In search of an answer, the scientific community
has appealed to the notion of unific a t i o n .The deeper
one gets into the interstices of matter, they argue, t h e
more sweeping and elegant the formulae may become.
The lust for a unified theory behind nature has
prime targets in sight. In a last gasp of CERN’s old
a c c e l e r a t o r, the first experimental indications emerged
of the so-called Higgs field,an arena of force like the
electromagnetic field with which species of particles
interact (or do not) and win their very unique masses.
“Imagine you’re cooking pasta,”says Ellis,“and you add
olive oil. When it cools, the olive oil separates out.
What we’re trying to do in the new collider is boil the
water so that we can see the differences evaporate.”1
Yet this still leaves the gravitational conundrum
unresolved. John March Russell,a physicist at CERN,
enthuses over one mind-bending possibility: that gravity
is so weak in comparison to other forces because much
of it is swallowed into other dimensions. Should this be
the case, he says, the new collider may reveal more
than just new particles:energy might be sucked away
into the nether- w o r l d ,or even more radically, tiny black
holes may form for a fraction of a second.
Such extra dimensions would appear to make
elementary particles that bit more baffling, but the
opposite is probably true:it may offer the first proof
that strings exist.“ Th e o r e t i c a l l y, the gravity problem
and string theory fit together very nicely,” a r g u e s
March Russell.
But what precisely are these magical strings? Fo r
around 30 years, theorists have laboured over rival
sets of formulae explaining how string-like
p h e n o m e n a , around 10- 3 2 cm in length and thus
invisible to all possible experiments, generate the
entirety of known particles and forces, i n c l u d i n g
gravity. If true, it would be the deepest theory ever
e n c o u n t e r e d : the overarching law breathing form
and function into the universe.
U n f o r t u n a t e l y, their infinitesimal size and
supplementary dimensions have given the theory an
air of high abstraction,but Ve n e z i a n o, also of CERN,
is undaunted. For him,the epoch of creation might
have to be rewritten.“I see the big bang as a way to
put string theory to the test.When you get very close
to time zero, strings simply cannot fit into space.”
The results are revolutionary. No infinitely dense
singularity could exist at the start of the universe
because of the strings’ irreducible size.I n s t e a d , a “ p r e -
history” must be sketched in.“This could be a very
long pre-history starting with an almost trivial, i n fin i t e
universe filled with gravitational waves that barely
interact at all,” says Ve n e z i a n o.“ The beginning of the
process ending in the big bang is the occurrence of an
overdense region leading to the formation of a black
h o l e.”Within this hole, trapped waves start to interact
in the form of strings. An early relative of gravity
causes a lightning expansion of space, and at some
critical and obscure moment,the era of strings cedes
to the big bang, thus begetting the era of particles,
planets and us. “What we have for most of the time
before and after the big bang is a classical evolution,”
he says.
Major problems remain,above all in explaining
why the underlying strings (or any other fundamental
theory for that matter) do not lead to an utterly
different set of physical laws. But the thought is still
a giddy one—that reality migrates along a staircase of
u n i v e r s e s, each step recumbent on the one before.“ I n

JEAN-PIERRE LUMINET
DIRECTOR OF ASTROPHYSICS AT THE PARIS-MEUDON OBSERVATORY,
AUTHOR OF L’UNIVERS CHIFFONNÉ (FAYARD, 2001)
M i r ro r,
mirror up above
Could we be living deep in a cosmic mirage, where rays of light multiply
and distort our perceptions of space? Instead of being flat and infinite,
might space not in fact be folded up—and our sense of the universe’s
vastness just an illusion?
I
t is extremely difficult for most of us to give a
shape to something as intangible as space. Fo r
the physicist, the question only has meaning if
couched in the language of geometry. So then
the question becomes: how can geometry best
represent physical space—the space we inhabit?
The problem is much more complex than it
first appears. There is no doubt that the space we
live in and which we are
familiar with is
correctly described by
what is known as
Euclidean geometry, a
set of laws devised by
the Greek geometer
Euclid in the third
century BC.1 But space
at the tiny microscopic
l e v e l , according to
quantum mechanics, is
a chaotic, f l u c t u a t i n g
domain somewhat like
the foam on the surface
of an ocean, while at
the very large
cosmological level we
learn that space is in
truth “ c u r v e d .” Wh e n
we ask what shape or
form space has,
t h e r e f o r e, modern physics actually gives us a
variety of answers depending on the level at which
we are looking.
Yet what exactly do we mean when we say
that space is “curved”? The modern science of
cosmology stems largely from the equations of
general relativity formulated by Albert Einstein in
the first two decades of the 20th century.A c c o r d i n g
to these equations, all space is deformed, or rather
c u r v e d , by the distribution of matter such as
galaxies inside it.This curvature manifests itself as
one of the universe’s most fundamental forces:
gravity.
Now if we turn to the universe as a whole—by
which we mean huge scales of over 102 5 m e t r e s — i t
appears that the virtually uniform distribution of
galaxies throughout the cosmos must curve space in
a likewise uniform fashion.Aside from this constant
c u r v a t u r e, the universe should also have an
underlying dynamic: in other words, it can either be
expanding or contracting.
On the basis of Einstein’s equations,A l e x a n d e r
Friedmann and Georges
Lemaître discovered in
the 1920s a set of
models for such curved
space.The most simple
version points to so-
called positive
c u r v a t u r e, resembling a
simple sphere that
dilates from the big
bang onwards to reach
a maximum size before
contracting back into a
final “big crunch.”
Space could also have
no curvature or a
negative curvature
(forming a
“ h y p e r b o l i c ” shape that
resembles a saddle).In
both of these cases, the
universe expands
forever, though the rate of expansion slows over
time.
Recent observations have suggested that cosmic
space is in fact close to the “no curvature” m o d e l —
in other words it is flat and almost Euclidean,like
our normal understanding of space. But the data also
indicates that the universe is expanding at an
increasing rate, suggesting that some kind of
“cosmological constant” is accelerating the
expansion rate.This constant may be understood as
the energy of empty space.
But important questions remain. Can general
relativity really give us a satisfactory description of
the shape of space at the largest scales? It is, after all,

still unclear whether space is finite or infin i t e : a
spherical universe would certainly be finite, but a
Euclidean or negatively curved universe could be
either finite or infinite.
At this stage we need a new approach: that of
t o p o l o g y,a branch of geometry devoted to exploring
the properties that define particular spatial objects.
Where the science of curvature falls shorts, t o p o l o g y
can step in to tell us about the overall structure of
space.
Euclidean space can certainly be a lot more
complicated than imagined. A surface with no
c u r v a t u r e, for example, is not necessarily fla t .All one
has to do to prove this is take a rectangular piece of
paper and stick it together at the edges to make a
cy l i n d e r. Just as with the original flat piece of paper,
the surface of the cylinder is still Euclidean. The
cy l i n d e r ’s surface thus still has no curvature, b u t
unlike the flat paper, it is finite in one direction.
This is the sort of property that topology, n o t
curvature, can reveal.Cutting and sticking the flat
piece of paper into various new shapes does not alter
the curvature of the paper itself, but radically
changes it overall shape—its topology.
The dawn of
ruffled space
In space which is fla t , any two points can be
joined only by a single line, or geodesic—meaning
simply a line in curved space. In what we call multi-
connected space, on the other hand, an infin i t e
number of geodesics join two points together,as can
be seen in the diagram.It is this very property which
gives such spaces extraordinary cosmological
relevance.
When we look at a faraway galaxy, we normally
think that we are seeing just one unique object,in
one particular direction and at one distance. But if
cosmic space is multi-connected,rays of lights will
replicate to produce multiple images of the observed
galaxy. Since our entire perception of space comes
from analysis of the trajectories of light rays, such a
multi-connected space would mean we are plunged
in a massive optical illusion that makes the universe
appear much larger than it really is. Distant galaxies
that we believe to be “original” would in fact be
repeated images of a single galaxy.
A “ruffled”space would be just such a cosmos:
a multi-connected domain of finite volume, whose
size would be smaller than the observed universe
(whose radius is around 15 billion light-years).Th i s
space would create a topological mirage t h a t
constantly repeated the images from shining
sources—akin to standing in a hall of mirrors.
Similar optical illusions are already well known
by astronomers,and go under the name g r a v i t a t i o n a l
m i r a g e s. These occur when light from a distant
object such as a quasar is bent by the effect of a
massive body situated on its sightline. As a result,
light rays from the star follow the curvature of
space and are scattered (see photo). What the
observer sees is a group of phantom images
surrounding the intervening heavy object (known by
astronomers as a “ l e n t i l ” ) .This sort of mirage can be
directly ascribed to the l o c a l curvature of space
around the lentil.
In the event of a topological mirage, however,
there is no single heavy body like a galaxy deforming
s p a c e. I n s t e a d ,space itself plays the role of a lentil:
phantom images are distributed in all directions
and for all their points in history across the entirety
of space.Such a global mirage allows us to examine
objects not only from every possible angle,but also
from every possible phase in their evolution.
For space to have this ruffled shape, it would
have to be highly subtle and constructed over very
large scales. If not,we would have already identifie d
phantom images of our own galaxy and other well-
known structures—a feat we have not yet achieved.
So how can we then establish the true topology
of the universe? One method, c o s m i c
c r y s t a l l o g r a p h y, attempts to pinpoint repetitions in
the distribution of distant objects. Studies of
fluctuations in the cosmic background radiation—
a fossil from the big bang—might also indicate that
space is ruffled by uncovering specific recurrences.
Experimental projects in both fields are under-
w a y, though neither the depth nor the resolution of
observations are yet good enough to draw
conclusions about space’s overall topology. Th e
next few years, h o w e v e r,promise great things: d e e p
surveys of distant galaxies and quasars, along with
new satellites probing background radiation.
Perhaps we will soon be able to give a form to
space. ■
A very simple two-
dimensional universe
illustrates how an observer
in galaxy A (red) can see
multiple images of galaxy B
(yellow).This model of the
universe, called a tore (a
doughnut shape),is
constructed from a square
stuck together on two sides.
Instead of one line linking
the galaxies, light from
galaxy B can now reach
galaxy A by various routes;
as a result, the observer in
galaxy A sees images of
galaxy B from various
directions.Though the tore is
finite, the observer is under
the illusion that space is
much larger than it really
it—his or her image of
space is similar to a grid of
repeated cells.

A The universe is born in unknown, possibly unknowable circumstances. Traditional Big
Bang science suggested it emerged from a “singularity”—a point of infinite density at which
all known laws of space and time break down. S p e c u l a t i o n ,h o w e v e r, has not abated: o p t i o n s
for the first cause include a fluctuation in a field of quantum “foam,” a growth inside a Black
Hole or the bounce from a self-annihilating parent universe. Theists prefer the hand of God.
C Current theories point to an era of rapid “ i n flation”—an expansion so fast that it
outstripped the speed of light. From a tiny ball less than a millimetre in size, the universe
may have ballooned far beyond the distances our most advanced telescopes can currently
observe. The force behind this expansion is unknown.
E The temperature drops to a million billion degrees centigrade. Electromagnetism is born.
All four fundamental forces of physics—gravity, the strong nuclear force, the weak nuclear
force and electromagnetism—are now in place. Time is ripe for the creation of more complex
particles.
G Neutrons and protons combine to form the most basic atomic nuclei—those of hydrogen,
helium and lithium.The universe cools at extraordinary speed,so fast that there is no longer
enough heat to form other, heavier elements.
I The cosmic dark age ends with the formation of the universe’s first ever stars at the heart
of dense gas clouds. Compacted by gravity, hydrogen in these stars fuses into helium, p o u r i n g
heat and light into space. Hot and violent nuclear reactions clamber up the ladder of the
e l e m e n t s. C a r b o n , oxygen and magnesium are formed. Giant stars—called supernova e —
expire in tremendous explosions, ejecting heavy matter across the evolving galaxies.

I
s science on the verge of explaining the mystery
of existence,once and for all? Some prominent
scientists are suggesting as much. They claim
that unified theories of physics such as
superstring theory,when combined with refin e d
versions of the big bang model,will soon bequeath us
a so-called “theory of everything.” As described by
physicists such as Stephen Hawking, a theory of
everything will be a kind of mystical revelation,
which permanently transforms the “ H u h ? ”of wonder
evoked in us by our contemplation of nature into a
great “A h a ! ”
Those who find this vision of a wonderless world
chilling rather than exhilarating should be assured
that it will never be fulfil l e d . One of the great
paradoxes of modern science is that the more it
tells about about existence, the more
mysterious existence becomes.
The conundrum
of reality
Take the simplest question of
a l l :Why is there something rather
than nothing? The big bang
theory, for all its power, cannot
tell us why and how the big
bang happened in the first
p l a c e. Some physicists note
that according to quantum
m e c h a n i c s, empty space is
seething with so-called virtual
p a r t i c l e s, which spring into
existence for an instant before
v a n i s h i n g ; p e r h a p s, t h e s e
physicists speculate, the entire
universe began as a kind of virtual
p a r t i c l e. Honest physicists will
nevertheless admit that they have
absolutely no idea why there is
something rather than nothing. After all,
what produced the laws of quantum
mechanics, which supposedly allowed quantum
creation to occur?
The next question is: Why does the universe
look the way it does rather than some other way?
Why does it adhere to these laws of nature rather
than some other laws? Altering any of those laws
would have radically altered reality. If gravity had
been infinitesimally stronger, the universe would
have stopped expanding almost immediately after
the big bang and collapsed into a black hole;a bit
w e a k e r, and the universe would have flown apart so
rapidly that stars, galaxies and planets would never
have formed. The physicist Lawrence Krauss
compares the odds against gravity
having precisely the
value necessary
for the
L i f e against the o d d s
Cosmology has led us back to the very first second of the universe’s
existence, yet the more science reveals, the more it leaves unanswered

cosmos to exist to the odds against someone guessing
precisely how many atoms are in the sun.
Then there is the enigma of life. The biologist
Richard Dawkins once declared that life “is a
mystery no longer”because it had been solved by
Darwin’s theory of evolution by natural selection.
A c t u a l l y, life is still a complete conundrum, in spite
of all the insights provided by evolutionary theory
and more modern biological paradigms, such as
genetics and molecular biology.None of these fie l d s
can tell us why life appeared on earth in the first
p l a c e, and whether it was a probable event or a
once-in-eternity fluke.
Dawkins and others proclaim that life is a robust
phenomenon that occurs throughout the universe,
but there is no scientific evidence to support this
b e l i e f.After decades of searching,we have found
no signs of life elsewhere in
the universe.As far
as we know, life emerged here on earth only once,
approximately 3.5 billion years ago. M o r e o v e r,
attempts to replicate the origin of life in the
laboratory have left researchers more baffled than
ever at how it occurred. The Nobel prize winner
Francis Crick once complained that “the origin of
life appears to be almost a miracle, so many are
the conditions which would have to be satisfied to
get it going.”C r i c k , it should be noted, is an agnostic
leaning toward atheism.
Scanning the heavens
for signals
Many scientists have contended that once life
started evolving on the earth, it was only a matter of
time before it produced a species as complex as we
a r e. But the history of life on earth does not support
such a view. For roughly 80 percent of life’s 3.5-
billion-year span, it consisted entirely of single-
celled organisms, such as bacteria and algae. Then
something happened—biologists will probably
never know exactly what—and the era of trilobites,
t r i c e r a t o p s, taxi-drivers and other multi-cellular
creatures commenced.
The palaeontologist Stephen Jay Gould
has pointed out that contingency — j u s t
plain luck—has played an enormous
role in the emergence of H o m o
s a p i e n s. If life on earth started
from scratch a million times over,
Gould contends, chances are it
would never again produce
m a m m a l s, let alone anything
resembling Homo sapiens .
S i m i l a r l y, the biologist
Ernst Mayr suspects that
we may be the only life
forms in the galaxy and
possibly the entire
universe capable of
inventing radios and other
c o m m u n i c a t i o n s
t e c h n o l o g i e s.For that reason,
Mayr believes that SETI—the
search for extra-terrestrial
i n t e l l i g e n c e, which scans the
heavens for extra-terrestrial radio
transmissions—is doomed to fail.
The particle physicist Steven
Weinberg once wrote: “ The more the
universe seems comprehensible, the more it
seems pointless.”My analysis of science suggests
a corollary aphorism:the more the universe seems
c o m p r e h e n s i b l e, the more it seems improbable.Th e
most wildly improbable feature of the universe is the

MARCELO GLEISER
BRAZILIAN-BORN PHYSICS PROFESSOR AT DARTMOUTH COLLEGE (U.S.),
AUTHOR OF THE DANCING UNIVERSE: FROM CREATION MYTHS TO THE BIG BANG (PLUME,1998)
S
ince the dawn of civilization, h u m a n k i n d
has marvelled at the skies and at Nature’s
myriad creations.This sense of wonder was
deeply interwoven with a sense of fear:
N a t u r e ’s dual role as creator and destroyer
has puzzled and polarized our perceptions of the
c o s m o s. As a way of establishing a degree of control
over the apparent unpredictability of natural
p h e n o m e n a , gods were held responsible for these
c o n flicting manifestations.In short,Nature was deifie d .
The question of why there is something rather
than nothing was a crucial part of this process. All
cultures have attempted to provide an answer to the
mystery of creation, and our modern scientific
tradition is no exception.Perhaps more surprisingly,
there is an intriguing correspondence between
answers suggested by mythic narratives and those
suggested by scientific research. The crucial
d i f f e r e n c e,of course, is that the
scientific process is capable of
weeding out explanations
which do not measure up to
o b s e r v a t i o n s,while those based
on myth are held true on the
basis of faith alone.
Greece and reason
Creation myths can be
divided conveniently into two
k i n d s : either the cosmos
appeared at a specific moment
in time marking the beginning of history, or it has
always been “there.” Myths with a creation event
describe time in a linear fashion,with a beginning,
middle and, as in the Christian narrative, an end.
Myths without a creation event may consider time
to be either unimportant or cy c l i c. Within these
two sets,we encounter an enormous variety.S t a r t i n g
with the “no creation myths,” the two possibilities
a r e :an eternal,uncreated cosmos,as in the narrative
of the Jains of India,or a cyclic cosmos, c o n t i n u o u s l y
created and destroyed, as beautifully represented in
the Hindu tradition by the dance of Shiva.
The first and by far the most common “myth
with creation” invokes a deity or deities who create
the world, as in the Judaeo-Christian myth of
Genesis. A second possibility is that the world was
created out of nothing, without the interference of
a god; this is what the Maori people of New Zealand
have in mind when they sing, “from nothing the
begetting, from nothing the increase. . . .” A final
possibility is that the world appeared spontaneously
from a primordial Chaos, where order coexists with
disorder, Being with Non-Being.
The religious nature of the creation event has
permeated scientific thought since its origins in
Ancient Greece in the sixth century BC. As the
Greek philosophers pondered the physical
mechanisms that created the world and controlled
its motions, many assumed an organizational
principle based on rational design, attributed to a
“ D e m i u r g e ” by Plato or to the “Unmoved Mover”
by A r i s t o t l e.Plato was a true heir of the Pythagorean
t r a d i t i o n ,which saw the world as a manifestation of
N u m b e r, arranged and combined to create the
harmonies perceived by the
s e n s e s. The emphasis on a
creation event was somewhat
left aside, being substituted by
the importance of reason in
understanding the workings of
N a t u r e.The philosopher, in his
search for rational meaning,
was in effect elevating himself
to a higher level of existence—
that of the Demiurge’s mind.
To understand Nature was to
understand God,or, in an oft-
quoted aphorism,to understand the mind of God.
This tradition reappeared in the West during
the birth of modern science in the Renaissance.
The great natural philosophers that spearheaded the
so-called Copernican Revolution were all, to a
greater or lesser degree,deeply religious men, w h o
saw their scientific work as an integral part of their
religious beliefs. Th u s, Copernicus himself was a
canon of the cathedral in Frauenberg, a reluctant
revolutionary who sought to reconcile the
arrangement of the celestial spheres with the
Platonic ideal of circular motions with constant
v e l o c i t i e s. His model of the solar system was an
elegant compromise between the old and the new,
looking back at Plato and forward at the aesthetic
principles of his time. His great opus, On the
The m y t h s of science
Myth, religion and science have more often than not proved inseparable
in addressing the eternal imponderable: why something rather than
nothing?

Revolutions of the Heavenly Orbs, was dedicated to
Pope Paul III, in the hope that the Church would
recognize the need for a reinterpretation of the
Scriptures based on the new astronomical thought.
It was through the work of Giordano Bruno
a n d , more importantly,Johannes Kepler and Galileo
G a l i l e i , that the Copernican Revolution was
e n a c t e d . Kepler was deeply influenced by the
Pythagorean tradition, a number mystic who
believed geometry to be the key to the cosmic
harmony. His three laws of planetary motion are a
powerful illustration of how the scientific output of
a great mind can be a byproduct of a belief system
tempered by the analysis of data.
No final truths
G a l i l e o ’s now famous tribulations with the
Church were also a product of his beliefs.A pious
(and overconfident) man, Galileo took as his
personal mission to reset the course of Christian
t h e o l o g y, preaching to the Church leaders the
importance of accepting the new cosmic design.
The clash was unavoidable, and in 1633 Galileo
was forced to abjure his conviction in the
Copernican system.Not for long, though,for soon
after Isaac Newton put forward his three laws of
motion and his universal theory of gravity in 1687,
the sun-centered cosmos became widely accepted.
To Newton, the cosmos was a manifestation of
G o d ’s glory, i n finite in extent and sublime in design.
During the twentieth century, the Newtonian
universe was substituted by a curved Einsteinian
universe;Einstein showed how matter and energy
can bend space and alter the flow of time, e n d o w i n g
them with an unprecedented plasticity. N o w h e r e
is this more spectacularly displayed than in the
expansion of the universe itself,discovered by Edwin
Hubble in 1929. Once again, the question of origins
came back to haunt scientists: if the universe is
expanding, there was a moment in time when all
matter was squeezed into a very small volume.
Astronomy was proclaiming that the universe did
have an origin, after all.A cry of dissent emerged
from Cambridge University via the proposal of the
“steady-state model,” where the universe never
had a beginning in time.With the discovery that the
whole cosmos is immersed in a bath of microwave
radiation in the 1960s, the steady-state model was
abandoned by most cosmologists; the “ b i g - b a n g
model” has since been accepted as the one which
best fits the data.
Can science “explain” the age-old question of
Creation? Certainly,physical models describing the
origin of the cosmos can and have been proposed,a t
least since the 1970s.But these models face a serious
technical obstacle: the lack of a proper theory to
describe physical processes at the enormous energy
scales prevalent during the first moments of cosmic
h i s t o r y. They could be called scientific creation
n a r r a t i v e s, at least until they can be placed on more
solid theoretical ground.We see old themes coming
b a c k ,dressed in scientific jargon. In some models the
universe was born out of “ n o t h i n g,” a quantum
vacuum populated by all sorts of ephemeral energy
fluctuations;others see the beginning as essentially
c h a o t i c, with an ordered cosmos emerging
homogeneously in three dimensions.
Some of these models of creation make
predictions about measurable properties of the
u n i v e r s e,which can be used to test and refine them.
Yet it may be hard to rule out all alternative models,
which may also be compatible with these
measurements. The best that we can hope for is a
workable model of cosmic origins, compatible with
observations but open to changes. S c i e n t i fic inquiry
is after all an ongoing process—there is no fin a l
t r u t h , only approximations to the truth.
Furthermore, science, at least as it is formulated at
p r e s e n t , cannot answer questions concerning its
own origin: we do not know why the universe
operates according to the laws we have uncovered
and not others. This essential incompleteness of
science suggests a new form of complementarity
between science and religion; religion does not exist
to cover the holes of our scientific knowledge, but
as a driving force behind scientific inspiration.
Through our search for knowledge we uncover our
true nature, fuelled by the same sense of mystery
which filled our ancestors with awe. ■

Steven Weinberg*: Towards a final theory
“I’m reasonably sure that we will have a final theory from which all the
regularities in nature can be deduced, but I am also reasonably sure that
the final theory will leave us with a mystery: why isn’t the theory
something else, such as a theory with nothing at all, or a theory with just
two particles endlessly in orbit around each other. The best we can hope to
do is discover a theory that is logically fragile, in the sense that any small
change in the theory would lead to logical contradictions.
On a more mundane level, there are limits to science that are not so
fundamental but as a practical matter we will probably not be able to
transcend. For example, the final theory may very well be something like
string theory, but I cannot conceive of how we will ever directly produce
structures that are 17 powers of ten smaller than those probed in the
laboratory today. Likewise there’s a wide class of cosmological theories in
which our big bang is one of many that go off all over the universe, though
in principle we will never observe the others. In both cases the theory will
be successful or not depending on whether its predictions for things we
can observe are correct.
As for religion,whatever reasons it provides still raise the question of why:
why should there be deities with certain characteristics? In fact the more
you learn of physics, the less you see of what may be regarded as
purpose.”
* Professor of Physics, University of Texas at Austin, Nobel Prize for
Physics (1979)
John Leslie*: Inside the divine mind
“Cosmology can give us speculative stories that are very much worth
taking seriously. But at the moment science cannot give us any confidence
that these stories are correct. The stories are all about how this universe
came into existence against the background of the laws of physics, and
there’s a question of why there are any laws of physics, and why they
should apply to anything.
Let’s suppose you had a completely empty situation.What would there be
in that situation which could create a universe? Well, first note that the
situation couldn’t be entirely empty because it would be full of all sorts of
facts—for example, the fact that 2+2=4. I don’t think you can get rid of
facts like that just by banishing the universe from existence, because these
are facts about possibilities and hold no matter what. There would also be
ethical facts:for example, it would be a fact that the emptiness was in one
respect bad because you could have a really good situation instead, a
wonderful cosmos.
If Plato was right in thinking that Value itself acts creatively, then the
cosmos must be the very best possible cosmos. It then consists of an
infinite number of minds, each knowing everything worth knowing:minds
we might want to call divine. The structure of the universe is just one of
the things worth knowing, and all of us exist inside one of those divine
minds. This is a pantheistic view—that the structure of the cosmos is
simply the structure of divine thinking.”

and religion supply m a g i s t e r i a— fields of knowledge—
that do not encroach on each other,but are not entirely

them.Gould uses the metaphor of oil and water, two
elements that do not mix but can remain in very close

Transcendental gaps
Not true say the supporters of “correspondence,”
who base their viewpoint on the notion that scientific
data can be directly useful to religion.According to this
approach,concepts in these two fields can link up or
even agree, so that theories of the big bang and Creation
may interact to their mutual advantage. But this
position raises a host of questions, particularly over the
nature of knowledge:is science not impoverished or
cheapened by confusing all or part of it with religion?
Does a concept such as Creation not mean very
different things in different religious traditions and in
the mouths of scientists, for whom it has a precise
technical significance?
The essential weakness with this approach is
evident in the concept of a “God particle.” S i n c e

Michael Heller*: The limits of scientific understanding
“There is a great temptation for the scientist to identify the limits of
rationality with the limits of scientific method—or, to put it in a more
picturesque way, to identify the limits of the method with the limits of the
universe. This temptation is so powerful because the scientific method is
the easiest kind of rationality and can efficiently distinguish what is
scientifically valuable information from what is not.
The nature of the big bang is a purely scientific problem. To “explain”it as
a result of God’s action is like ascribing thunder to the bad temper of Zeus.
I think the really important question lies elsewhere:namely, where do the
laws of physics come from?
There are currently two ways of answering this. One is to show that on a
fundamental level there reigns complete anarchy and the laws of physics
are just effects of purely random averaging processes. The other is to
imagine a set of all possible universes, each of them with different physical
laws. We then happen to be living in a highly ordered universe because in
all other universes the life of beings like ourselves is excluded.But can such
probabilities be an ultimate explanation? Why does the universe—or the
set of all universes—have this property of probability? Here, I think,we are
touching the real limits of our understanding of the universe.
The only way to get rid of such questions is not to ask them. But that
would go against a criterion of critical rationality:one should not cease to
look for further arguments as long as something remains to be argued
for.”
* Professor at the Faculty of Philosophy of the Pontifical Academy of
Theology, Cracow, Poland
Tsevi Mazeh*: The beauty of the world
“Science cannot tell us why and what for, and in a sense science is limited
to the technical details of how the world works. I think there is no problem
with saying God was in the beginning, that God set the world rolling and
decided upon its rules. But as for the question of God interfering during the
history of the universe—that is something I believe, but which I do not
fully understand.
My religion [Orthodox Judaism] does not influence my work as an
astronomer, but it does make me appreciate God and the beauty of the
world. I have been teaching a course on binary stars, in which there is a
mathematical formula describing perfectly the stars’ motion.In my eyes it
is a miracle that the human mind can find such beautiful mathematical
tools to explain the motion of the world—I see that as one of the miracles
of the world that God created.
As for Chapter 1 of Genesis, you have to realize that it has a core and it
has details. The core is the theological message:there is one unified God.
When the Bible was written, this was a complete revolution and actually
doesn’t make sense when you look upon the world and see its forces
fighting each other. The writer of Genesis had to convey this message in
some cosmological terms, so he chose the cosmology of his day. He could
not mention the big bang, the speed of light or atoms. Instead, he spoke
in terms understandable to the people of that time.”

element in the material world.
Dissonance avoids this trap by allowing a calm
dialogue between scientists and theologians that
respects each other’s independence of thought: they
agree not to exploit bits of each other’s field of
knowledge to advance their own. But is this division
perhaps too radical,depriving each side of elements that
could be useful for their own thinking?
Thus the need for a third position that rejects all
blending of science and theology advocated by
supporters of correspondence, but establishes an
indirect dialogue between them via a go-between—
philosophy in the broadest sense.The dialogue is also
a s y m m e t r i c a l , since it encourages theological debate on
the basis of scientific knowledge rather than the other
way round.
This perspective begins by recognizing that science
inevitably raises philosophical questions which it cannot
a n s w e r, such as ones about meaning and ethics.
Philosophers can then draw on religious traditions
among other resources to search for answers. These
answers are of little use to scientists in their everyday
r e s e a r c h , but may help them deal with the kind of
questions every human being runs up against. A n d
theology in turn can benefit from philosophical work
inspired and fertilized by science. This pathway from
science towards religion is thus the fruit of work that has
to be carried out continually as scientific knowledge
a d v a n c e s : questions are raised, and philosophical
responses generated that must at some stage take
account of religion.
Unravelling
the beginnings
Let’s go back to the example of the big bang. A
scientist from the school of correspondence could
say it was equivalent to Creation in the theological
sense. But this assertion would not be scientifically
legitimate:physics is based on natural causes alone,
while Creation comes from divine and therefore
metaphysical intervention.As a result, the issue of the
purely physical origin of the universe “ r e m a i n s
entirely separate from any metaphysical or religious
question,” according to Lemaître. The theory of the
big bang hence does not presuppose any special
religious belief, contrary to what some scientists
thought in the 1950s.
Dissonance, which rules out all dialogue between
cosmology and theology, is no more satisfactory. But an
Lee Smolin*: Cosmological evolution
“A key issue is understanding the fine-tuning of the universe: how did it
come to be that the parameters that govern elementary particles and their
interactions are tuned and balanced in such a way that a universe of such
variety and complexity arises? The probability that a universe created by
randomly choosing the parameters will contain stars is one chance in
10229.
The universe is improbable, and it is improbable in the sense that it has a
structure which is much more complex than it would be if its laws and
initial conditions were chosen more randomly. Thus we seek a kind of
explanation which is checkable, which is falsifiable, and which is based on
some hypothesis of natural phenomena. Broadly speaking, biology and
natural selection are the most successful examples of a theory that
addresses such questions.
In the case of the universe, this leads to the hypothesis of cosmological
natural selection:in other words, that our elementary particles are the way
we find them because they make the production of black holes, and thus
the production of new “universes,” much more likely.
If it is true that the big bang was not the beginning of the universe but an
event that came from another part of the universe, whether a black hole
or something else with a prior structure, then it’s very possible that
observations over the next few decades will help us—just as by studying
the ripples in water, you can measure the shape of the rock that caused
them.”
* Professor of Physics at Pennsylvania State University, author of The Life
of the Cosmos (Oxford University Press, 1997)
Seyyed Hossein Nasr*: Be, and there is
“Science by its very nature can deal only with one level of existence, physical
existence. Science also relies on the study of events in time and space. The
scientist therefore pushes towards the beginning, but find its impossible to
get to the beginning itself since it is beyond material existence and beyond
the spatial or temporal.In contrast,most religions—with exceptions, such as
Confucianism—have spoken about the origin of the universe.
Those who accept the religious point of view, such as myself, can say a great
deal about the origins of the universe. We believe that the reality which
brought the universe into being has also sent us a revelation in knowledge of
the origin of that universe. In the case of Islam, this revelation comes first of
all from the Koran, which describes the creation of the universe as coming
from the word of God, recounted in the very famous verse of Chapter 36 in
which God says “Be, and there is.”
Until the 17th century, science from East to West was aimed at studying the
traces of God’s wisdom in his creation. But the Cartesian philosophy that
undergirds the scientific revolution created a division between the knowing
subject and the known object: modern science considered its goal to be the
study of pure quantity, and tore away all qualitative aspects of nature—all
its spiritual elements.
Every ten years there are new cosmological theories and views. But I do not
really take these to be steps towards understanding the ultimate structure of
the universe since we are dealing with so many unknowns. It’s as if you knew
one inch of a line and extrapolated it straight to the moon.”
* Professor of Islamic Studies at George Washington University

SUDHANVA DESHPANDE
ACTOR AND DIRECTOR WITH THE DELHI-BASED THEATRE GROUP
JANA NATYA MANCH
Out of b u t t e r and w a t e r: t h e
Hindu creation
In the classic myths of Hinduism, there is no primeval emptiness:
just different stages of gods and the universe, recycling themselves
like crops
2 . C O S M O S, GOD AND US
T
here is no single Hindu myth of origin.Th e r e
are as many myths as there are texts;
s o m e t i m e s, the same text has more than one.
The earliest myths date back to the Rig Ve d a ,
the first of the four Ve d a s, composed over a
period of time, though certainly before 1000 BC, a n d
eventually committed to writing many centuries later.
Contrary to what some believe, the bulk of Rig
Vedic hymns—all told, there are 1028 of them, s p r e a d
over ten books—are not spiritual or metaphysical at all,
consisting mostly of tributes to an entire pantheon of
anthropomorphic gods. But books one and ten, w h i c h
coincide with the emergence of varna, the four-fold
hierarchical division of society,which rapidly led to the
proliferation of hundreds of castes, also contain the
origin hymns.
The most celebrated of these is the hymn that
contains the earliest known reference to v a r n a.
Creation is the result of the sacrifice of Purusha (Man),
the primeval being, who is all that exists, i n c l u d i n g
“whatever has been and whatever is to be.” Wh e n
P u r u s h a , who had “a thousand heads, a thousand eyes,
a thousand feet” was sacrific e d , the clarified butter
that resulted was made into the beasts which inhabit
intermediate philosophical discussion about the
meaning of the big bang as the physical origin of the
cosmos can help theologians unravel the links and
differences between notions of physical beginning,
metaphysical beginning and divine Creation,and see
more clearly the purely theological meaning of the
latter.
Creation in the theological sense can mean the
sudden physical appearance of the world for divine
reasons, but it can also mean a relation that God uses
to keep the universe in existence by giving it physical
s h a p e.This “sudden appearance” cannot be regarded as
the start of a process in physical time because it is itself
the origin of space, time and matter.
F u r t h e r m o r e, this “Creation link” cannot be seen as
a physical cause because it is in fact the cause of all
physical causes. New theological ways of describing
the relations between time and eternity, between God
and the world, can flow from this philosophical
c l a r i fic a t i o n . It also makes for better understanding of
the range and limits of science.
For some, science and religion are inseparable but
very different friends. For others, they are friends only
linked by a third party. For get others, they are friends
that are in fact true twins.And finally, they are viewed
as two people who are not friends at all because they
never meet. In short, a set of bonds running all the
way from fusion to fission. ■

the earth.This same sacrifice produced the gods, I n d r a
(the menacing king of gods),Agni (Fi r e ) ,Vayu (Wi n d ) ,
as well as the Sun and the Moon. From Purusha’s
navel the atmosphere was born; his head produced
the heaven; his feet produced the earth;his ear the sky.
The four v a r n a s were born too: the mouth was the
b r a h m a n ( p r i e s t ) ; the arms the k s h a t r i y a ( w a r r i o r ) ;
the thigh the vaishya (general populace);the feet the
shudra (servant).
Primeval incest is the other method by which
creation takes place in the Rig Ve d a , and this idea
recurs throughout Hinduism. Later mythology claims
M a n u , the first man, gave birth to the human race
through the act of incest;Manu himself is also born of
incest that the creator indulges in. By the time we
come to the texts known as the Puranas (dates between
300 and 1500 A D ) , the story of creation becomes more
c o m p l e x : the creator of the universe was the god
B r a h m a , who came from the primeval waters,and was
sw ay a m b h u ( s e l f - e x i s t e n t ) . Brahma transformed
himself into a giant boar (varaha) to bring forth the
earth from the depths of these waters. The first man,
M a n u , was born directly of Brahma. Manu was a
h e r m a p h r o d i t e, and created two sons and three
daughters from his female half.
What is striking in all this, of course, is that none of
these stories actually say how the universe began.
There is no sense of things being created out of nothing,
the stuff of the universe only happening to be reused
and recycled periodically, like in a giant ecofriendly
e n t e r p r i s e. In a sense, of course, this is a natural
outcome of the Hindu view of the eternally recycling
u n i v e r s e, that goes through the four successive periods,
y u g a s, forever condemned to the cycle of regeneration
and destruction. The four y u g a s are said to be
respectively 4800, 3 6 0 0 ,2 4 0 0 , and 1200 god-years long.
A god-year, in turn, lasts 360 human years.The quality
of life,as well as of humans, progressively deteriorates
in each successive y u g a until we reach the present
dark (kali) yuga, which will end in the great universal
deluge, followed again by a new golden age and the
birth of man from Manu.
This great cosmic cycle, eternally chasing its own
t a i l , this depressingly monotonous ebb and flow in
which all illusion of forward movement is actually
r e t r o g r e s s i o n , fairly accurately sums up the Indian
p e a s a n t ’s life over centuries. The hard summer is
followed by the great deluge of the monsoon,which
rekindles the eternal hope that at last hunger, misery,
and want will come to an end.Thus every agricultural
cycle is actually the great cosmic cycle in microcosm.
Practically all festivals in various parts of India coincide
with the major punctuations in this agricultural cy c l e ;
for instance, even as I write these lines in late March,
the traditional Indian new year is being celebrated in
most regions, now that the crop is ready.
A visit to the barber
To the extent that India is still a predominantly
agricultural society, these festivals, and the various
rituals that go with them,are an organic part of people’s
lives, and not just corporate inducements to an urban
elite to consume more and more in the globalized
m a r k e t p l a c e.Ye t , since these festivals and rituals have
actually evolved over a very long period of time, they
are now most often taken for granted; like the self-
existent creator, they just exist,with neither beginning
nor end. For most practitioners of these rituals, much
of the original meaning is either unimportant,or simply
lost under centuries of cultural sedimentation.
Yet ideas persist over centuries and pop up at you
when you least expect them. Last week, I needed a
h a i r c u t , and so I went to the barber who has performed
this service since I was about ten. It is a veritable
r i t u a l , evolved over two decades or so. It begins with his
magnanimously offering me tea, and ends with his
never returning change.In between, he asks about my
family, I about his;he checks if I am still off smoking,
I if he is off drink.Through all this,of course, we discuss
p o l i t i c s, s p o r t s,and anything else of topical interest.Th i s
time, I asked him how he was told the universe came
into being.He laughed,snipped off a tuft of hair on my
f o r e h e a d , and said: “ Who knows how all this was
created? Who was around to see? Even the gods were
born after something existed, so who can tell what
happened when nothing existed?”
My barber has not read the Rig Veda. But if he
were to, some day, he will be struck by the following
hymn:
Then even nothingness was not,nor existence.
There was no air then,nor the heavens beyond it.
Who covered it? Where was it? In whose keeping?
Was there then cosmic water, in depths unfathomed?
But,after all,who knows, and who can say,
Whence it all came, and how creation happened?
The gods themselves are later than creation,
So who knows truly whence it has arisen?

O
n the day that the blue ones stopped
transmitting, the caretaker was doing its
rounds of the Eye, humming and pottering
among the other, duller maintenance
robots.
Th e n ,when the news came in, it stopped humming.
Near the heart of the Eye—the vast radio telescope
floating beyond the orbit of Jupiter—was a gigantic
spherical tank which had once been used to store the
water the humans had needed during the construction.
They had lived in it, too—dwelling in pressurized
cabins surrounded by water, shielded from radiation.
Now they were gone—long gone—but the
midnight blue tank remained.
Like, the caretaker had thought one day, a huge
blank canvas.
✩✩✩
Until the coming of the Eye, no radio telescope
had been sensitive enough to pick out signals of
intelligent origin from the mush of cosmic background
n o i s e. But then the feast had begun: a tsunami of
knowledge almost beyond human comprehension.Ye t
the messages showed that humanity was still
fundamentally alone.All the signals had originated in
other galaxies, often at distances that bordered on the
c o s m o l o g i c a l .They had been sent hundreds of millions
of years ago, when the dinosaurs were still evolution’s
cool new idea.
But there was a more disturbing thing even than
the loneliness.
At any one time the Eye was picking up the
messages from about a hundred civilizations, but each
only stayed active for a few centuries before falling
s i l e n t .The net number stayed roughly constant because
new species were always popping up and discovering
radio astronomy, but they too would be doomed to
spend only a relatively short amount of time among the
h u n d r e d . For a few glorious centuries they would
broadcast their cultural legacy into the sky;enriching
the knowledge of the other listening cultures.
But then—it was often around the time they started
discovering some of the more interesting things that
could be done with subatomic particles—they would
stop sending.
Usually without much warning.
✩✩✩
It shouldn’t have
bothered the
caretaker.
But in tending
the Eye it found that
it became quite attached to some of those transmitting
c u l t u r e s. It became absorbed in their histories;
fascinated by their biologies and outlooks.
It hummed their music and pondered their art.
And waited with deep, mounting sadness for the
day it always knew would come; the sudden,roaring
silence from that part of the sky.
✩✩✩
It moved to the part of the Fresco which recorded
the senders in a distant galaxy in the constellation
Sculptor.
The caretaker had marked the tank with faint lines
of celestial latitude and longitude. At the precise co-
ordinates of the transmitting civilization, it had painted
a spiral galaxy much like our own;an impressionistic
swirl of white and ochre. It was one of the first galaxies
that the caretaker had painted,and while it had gained
proficiency since—there were better ones dotted all
around the Fresco—there was a certain charm to this
effort which appealed to it.
Two thirds out from the core, the caretaker had
marked the location of the transmitting culture’s solar
system.
It thought of them:blue, tentacled aquatic beings
with a reproductive system so intricate it had taken the
caretaker decades to work out how many sexes they
had. Their music had been even trickier;sounding at
first pass like synchronized drowning. But the caretaker
had persisted, and after a while it had even caught
itself humming some of the more accessible bits.
But they were gone now.
Silent.
✩✩✩
Nothing for it,then.
With sadness in its heart—but at the same time
emboldened by the execution of a solemn task it
knew must be done—the caretaker prepared the
precise shade of midnight blue it needed. When it
was ready, it carefully stippled the galaxy into oblivion,
like a master picture restorer removing a blemish.
The caretaker was very good at its work,and when it
was done there was no sign that the galaxy had ever
existed.
The Fresco was up-to-date, but it would not be
long before it had to be changed again.
Art is long, it thought. And life short. ■

PROGRAMME DIRECTOR OF THE INTERNATIONAL
CENTRE FOR TRANSITIONAL JUSTICE,NEW YORK,
AND AUTHOR OF UNSPEAKABLE TRUTHS: CONFRONTING
STATE TERROR AND ATROCITIES, (ROUTLEDGE,2001)
M o re than just the truth
Truth commissions can set in motion a process of grieving and recovery, but they are not the only
answer to confronting crimes of the past. Trials are critical, while traditional healing practices can
also assuage wounds
hen nations go through a transition from a
repressive regime to a democracy, as many
have in recent years, a state and its people
are often left with a legacy of violence,
bitterness and pain. Because it is not always
possible to prosecute hundreds of
p e r p e t r a t o r s, many new governments have
turned to mechanisms outside the judicial
system to confront the horrific crimes of a
prior regime.
More than 20 such commissions have
been created over the past two decades,
mostly in Africa and Latin America (see
b o x ) . As they are more widely used and
s t u d i e d , it has become clear that they fill a
very different role from judicial inquiries
and trials. They paint a larger picture,
looking at many thousands of victims,
whereas trials (which are critically
important as well) must,by defin i t i o n ,f o c u s
on specific events of wrongdoing, a n d
s p e c i fic perpetrators. Truth commissions
can be defined as offic i a l , t e m p o r a r y
mechanisms established to investigate a
pattern of past human rights abuses or
violations of international humanitarian
l a w.As a transitional tool,they are charged
with investigating and reporting these
a b u s e s, and recommending reforms in
order to prevent further abuses in the
f u t u r e. In the process, they serve to
acknowledge formally past wrongs that
were silenced and denied.
Perhaps the most controversial and
publicised of these was the South African
Truth and Reconciliation Commission, s e t
up in 1995. It is the only commission to
date which had the power to grant amnesty
to individual perpetrators.The very public
nature of the hearings, with both victims
and perpetrators testifying in front of
television cameras, resulted in the country
as a whole reflecting on its history and
coming to a new understanding of the past.
To be granted amnesty, p e r p e t r a t o r s
were required to make a request in writing
for specific crimes, tell the full truth about
the event,and prove that it was politically
motivated.Thus, it was not a full amnesty:
if someone killed ten people and applied
for amnesty for only five, he or she could
still be prosecuted for killing the other fiv e.
A l s o, amnesty could be denied if it was
found that the applicant did not tell the
full truth or that the crime was motivated
out of personal spite or ill-will, rather than
for political reasons.
High expectations
Though the commission had a profound
e f f e c t , it also shed light on the limitations of
such exercises. Often,the time allotted for
the commission to complete its work was
too short, and it was impossible to verify
and reach conclusions on the thousands of
cases presented. For many victims, it was
painful to watch their perpetrators walk
free after admitting to heinous crimes.Th e
expectations from the commission were
too great from the start. South A f r i c a ’s
experience teaches us that we can’t expect
the truth process to resolve all issues
pertaining to past conflict and abuse.
Reconciliation and recovery is a process
that can take generations.
There is no one truth commission
m o d e l . Countries respond to legacies of
massive political violence in different ways.
Mozambique, for example, is right next to
South Africa,and its transition took place
almost exactly at the same time. Yet here,
there was no interest in digging up the past:
the victims and general public were
exhausted from the war and didn’t want to
talk about it,while the political leadership
on both sides of the conflict were also
uninterested in looking closely at the past.
Each nation must determine what span of
time to consider, what acts or events to
i n v e s t i g a t e, and under what rules. Th e
differences will range from whether a
commission chooses to hold public hearings,
as in South A f r i c a , or undertakes its
investigations behind closed doors.
Past experience shows that there are
some basic requirements for judging

whether a commission’s exercise is likely to
lead to credible results that fairly refle c t
the concerns of all society. Tr u t h
commissions must have operational
i n d e p e n d e n c e, but at the same time, b e
given the necessary political and
governmental support for their work, o f t e n
including direct financial support from the
government.
We are likely to see stronger
commissions in the future, as the lessons of
past experiences are incorporated into new
and more inventive models. The new
commission in East Ti m o r, for example,
makes creative use of local customs to
promote healing and reconciliation. Th e
commission has been set up, in part, t o
help facilitate the return of low-level
perpetrators who are still in West Timor.
These include members of the militia who
were not responsible for killing, raping or
organizing violence, but who might have
taken part in the burning or looting. It is
believed that such persons would be safe
from acts of revenge once they have
admitted to their crimes, apologized for
them and agreed to carry out a community
service sentence. Likewise in Sierra Leone,
the Truth and Reconciliation Commission
that is now being formed is likely to turn to
traditional and religious leaders to facilitate
its work on a local level. Wh e r e
a p p r o p r i a t e, it may facilitate such practices
as cleansing ceremonies as a way of
recognizing and honouring past events. I n
M o z a m b i q u e, traditional mechanisms were
in place that allowed people to process
conflict and pain in their own way. When
combatants came home, for example, t h e y
often went through a healing ritual where
their past sins were seen to be washed
a w a y. It is important for a country to
consider the indigenous mechanisms that
may be in place that can help it to counter
a painful past, with or without a
complementary truth commission process.

JAKOB FINCI
PRESIDENT OF THE NATIONAL COORDINATING COMMITTEE FOR THE ESTABLISHMENT OF THE TRUTH
AND RECONCILIATION COMMISSION IN BOSNIA HERZEGOVINA
Revenge in the making
Children in Bosnia are growing up learning that their neighbours are enemies. Civic groups say that a
truth commission is the only way to defuse brewing ethnic hatred
MORE THAN JUST THE T R U T H
hen truth commissions were set up in
Latin American countries such as
Argentina, Chile, and El Salvador, they
were justified because the systems of
abuse there had been designed to hide the
f a c t s. Torture and related abuses were
committed largely in secret; crimes like
“ d i s a p p e a r a n c e s ” were intended to erase
any trace of the victim or the crime.
Hence the compelling need to uncover
and acknowledge the truth.
In Bosnia, such a commission is not
needed because of a hidden truth, b u t
because of multiple “truths,” each with a
distinct ethnic vein.Nationalists from the
three ethnic communities involved in the
recent war propagate a history that
portrays their group as the one and only
victim of mass abuses,depicting the other
two as evil perpetrators and monsters.
Three separate war crimes commissions,
dominated respectively by Bosnian,C r o a t
and Serb perspectives, have focused on
the victimization of their own group.
Owing in no small part to the legacy
of communism, people in Bosnia
Herzegovina have long been accustomed
to a “ t o p - d o w n ”a p p r o a c h , by which they
passively let leadership determine their
fate. Shedding this mentality has been a
slow process,but citizens are sending out
a clear signal that they are ready to
confront the past with an eye to shaping
a better future. On no other issue is this
more obvious than the current effort to
establish a Truth and Reconciliation
Commission (TRC).
In January 2000, an extraordinary
conference in Sarajevo on the proposed
TRC brought together a diverse group of
May 2001 - The UNESCO Courier 39
The first truth and reconciliation commission was set up in 1974 by the Ugandan dictator Idi Amin
under pressure from human rights groups and the international community. Not surprisingly, his
regime refused to make public the report or to implement any of its recommendations.
Other truth commissions established in the 1980s fared better. Nunca más, the report by Argentina’s
commission to investigate disappearances under its military dictatorship, became a national
bestseller and led to the prosecution of several generals. Spanish judge Balthasar Garzon used the
Chilean Truth Commission (1990-91) report as his primary information source in issuing an arrest
warrant for dictator Augusto Pinochet in October 1998. Guatemala’s Historical Clarification
Commission (1997-99) and South Africa’s much-publicized Truth and Reconciliation Commission
(1995-2000) have been lauded for helping citizens of those countries come to terms with their
traumatic pasts.
Truth commissions have recently been set up in Nigeria, Panama, East Timor and Sierra Leone, while
other countries, including Bosnia, Serbia, Mexico and Burundi are exploring the option. Canada may
establish one to investigate the treatment of its native peoples. ■

8 0 civil society leaders from both the
Moslem-Croat Federation and the Serb
Republic. Representatives from human
rights groups, victims’ associations,
religious orders, political parties,
a c a d e m i a , youth groups and others
explained why they thought the TRC was
vital to reaching durable peace.
Independent media re-broadcast the
entire eight-hour discussion.This broad-
based grassroots citizens’ coalition has
now established a National Coordinating
Committee for Establishment of the
Truth and Reconciliation Commission.
This is an important step in the processes
of both democratization and
reconciliation in Bosnia. To date, o v e r
100 NGOs, political, religious and civic
leaders have signed a petition calling for
such a Commission.
One of its main goals is to enable
historians to write one history of the
c o u n t r y.For now,we have three different
h i s t o r i e s, each teaching our children that
our neighbours are our enemies.
Continuing like this, we cannot expect
anything more than a new war in 20 or 30
years.
Finally, some have suggested that the
TRC should not be established until the
War Crimes Tribunal in The Hague
finishes its work.This would only postpone
for at least another five years a process
that many believe is essential to
r e c o n c i l i a t i o n . Five years for the three
competing nationalistic versions of history
to become further embedded in the
collective psyche of each group. A boy
who was ten years old when the recent
c o n flict began has already reached the
age of military service. With every year
that children are raised on accounts of
recent history that demonize other ethnic
groups and refuse to acknowledge their
s u f f e r i n g, it becomes more likely that this
young generation will grow up to fight.It
is a common belief that if NATO
peacekeeping troops withdrew tomorrow,
the country would likely descend anew
into bloodshed and division.To make the
departure of these troops possible, it is
imperative that Bosnia take the T R C
route.
To prevent a new cycle of violence
and abuse, our society urgently needs to
confront the legacy of evil committed by
neighbour against neighbour, to identify
the shortcomings in its political, legal
and social institutions which render
such abuses possible, and to begin the
extraordinarily difficult and slow work
of re-stitching the social fabric.D e l a y i n g
such a process by several years would be
both tactically mistaken and morally
wrong. ■
Idon’t have much trust in the effectiveness of international tribunals.
When trials and hearings are held far from the scene of the crime, it
doesn’t help reconciliation in the least.In the Rwandan town of Nyamata,
where I spent six months, people would hear on the radio that “so and so
has been sentenced to 25 years in prison” in Arusha, Tanzania,where the
international tribunal for Rwanda sits. But what help is that? The survivors
of the genocide are neither there to hear the trial nor to point accusations.
What is said over there, before a foreign judge, leaves them indifferent.
Obviously, it would be unthinkable for justice not to be done. But after civil
war or genocide, the first job of justice—precisely because it has come too
late—is not so much to punish as to tell the truth,to unravel the complex
nature of responsibilities, and to acknowledge the victims’ suffering. Let
everything be known,said and recognized! Let the victims voice their pain!
Only then can the process of mourning begin,that crucial stage on the path
to reconciliation.And it can only happen before the eyes and ears of those
who suffered or “participated.”
In Sarajevo, as in the hills of Rwanda, you hear that “the guilty must be
tried here, by us.” All the more so as many cannot accept that we
Westerners, who stood by as the war and genocide went on, are now
judging its authors. The words of Marie-Louise, featured in my book,come
back to me: “foreigners usually show a routine pity towards people who
endured uncomparable hardship, as if the pity was more important than
the suffering itself.”
Time cuts two ways. A lot has to be left to survivors. They need it to find a
new footing in life. Conversely, however, time is running short for the Hutu
community, which is living in terror. About 125,000 accused people are
waiting in Rwandan jails. What’s being done about them? And what about
those who’ve returned home to find themselves at the mercy of
denunciation and vigilante justice? The page must be turned on an era of
suspicion, justice must be done so that each charged person can at last
make their way back into society without fear.
Are the Rwandans capable of judging their own? Not for the moment,but
we can help by training their judges and prosecutors. To ask “who will try
them and how?”and to ensure there are some Hutu among the judges is
a step towards dialogue. Let’s allow the time it takes for the people
involved to resolve this themselves, rather than turning to symbolic
international tribunals set up by the West as a warning against more wars
and genocides, but which don’t help reconciliation at all, except the
reconciliation of Westerners with their own conscience.
For now, in the hills, the genocide remains hidden,secret,wrapped in guilt
and shame. This silence is killing Rwanda. Should there be forgiveness to
become reconciled?  I don’t think so. For one, you can’t forgive someone
who’s tried to exterminate you from your land. Second, reconciliation
does not require forgiveness, but a sense that justice is being done. Deep
down inside, the survivors know that life must get back on course.
Because, as Francine told me, “the teachers have to return to their school
blackboards.”

Weaving magic with
the spoken word
Storytellers in Latin America have gained a cult following in the
past decade. Some are delving into ancient traditions, others are
spinning stories with a distinctly post-modern edge
alfway through his performance, Diego
Camargo notices that he’s forgotten one
of his characters.He asks the audience for
permission to go backwards and finds the
rebel climbing a tree, crestfallen and
upset. To convince him to return to the
s t o r y, Diego promotes him to the rank
of main character, giving him the
assurance that nobody will ever drop him
halfway through a tale again.
To hear stories like this, fans turn up
in numbers every year to the
International Congress of Oral
Storytelling, an event held since 1995 as
part of the annual Buenos Aires Book
Fa i r. Last time round, over 800 people
flocked from Argentina and neighbouring
c o u n t r i e s, all keen to hear stories old and
new, but also to learn how to tell them—
those subtle tricks of timing and voice, o f
gestures and facial expressions.
Many were teachers eager to get
children to read by adapting stories from
world-famous authors, such as Isaac
Bashevis Singer and Ray Bradbury, and
telling them in the classroom.A c c o r d i n g
to Nora Fo n o l l o s a , a narrator and
researcher into children’s literature, p u p i l s
often go to the nearest library to look
for copies of a story they have heard, a n d
if they can’t find it,ask for another book
by the same author.
But this enthusiasm is not confined to
s c h o o l s. Juan Moreno, from A r g e n t i n a ,
stopped teaching literature 17 years ago
and began a new life telling stories and
legends from around the world in
t h e a t r e s,b a r s,universities and libraries. I f
they happen to be in Fr e n c h , E n g l i s h ,
Portuguese, German, Italian or Hebrew, he
tells them in the original language. He also
runs workshops for psychologists, lawyers,
housewives and grandmothers. What does
he teach to people from such different
walks of life?
“The value of the spoken word,” he
says.“Words that heal and restore, that
can give life but also take it away.”
Learning this is very important for a
lawyer involved in mediation,he says,
but also for social workers in
hospitals and senior
citizens’ homes. H e
r e m e m b e r s
what a
despairing wo-
man once told Dora
Pastoriza de Echebarne, t h e
pioneer scholar of oral storytelling in
A r g e n t i n a :“ When I heard you tell the story,
I didn’t feel sad any more.”
Witches and goblins mingle
with spirits of nature
On a more material note, storytelling is
said to have its bonuses. I t ’s usually better
paid than acting in a theatre, and even
more enticingly, has lots of travelling
thrown in. Cuban storyteller Fátima
Paterson has already been twice to
L i v e r p o o l , in England, to tell stories
accompanied by her musicians. Every
y e a r, there are congresses, festivals and
s e m i n a r s, such as those in Bucaramanga
(Colombia),Monterrey (Mexico) and
Aguimes, in the Canary Islands.
After 15 years of slowly taking
r o o t , storytelling is now flourishing in
Latin A m e r i c a . According to
Argentine anthropologist A d o l f o
Colombres, the wave is not so much a
revival of Latin American narrative
traditions, but simply an enthusiasm
for oral communication. In countries
where few people read, “ o r a l
narration strangely enough
encourages people to write,” he says.

public places.” Does she feel she’s just
lending her voice and body to a tradition?
“Certainly not,” she retorts.“It’s not just
f o l k l o r e. I break with tradition because I
give my own version of a story. By telling
them in French, not just in the original
C r e o l e, I open up these stories to the
world in a novel way and place them in a
completely different context.”
Spreading this tradition is very
meaningful for Haitians, she believes.
When they listen to stories, h e r
compatriots come into close contact with
an ancient tradition that is part of their
h e r i t a g e. They feel proud of belonging
to a civilization that has invented such
characters and stories. For an
impoverished Haitian minority living in
French Guiana,for example, listening to
these stories is a mirror that can give
them a more positive image of
themselves.
For each place gives rise to its own
s t y l e. In Colombia, for example, a
movement of urban storytellers has
sprung up in several towns, despite a
t e n d e n cy to associate the form with
exaggeration and lies. Most of those
involved are university students between
17 and 35 years old. Although they do
not claim to be inspired by any special
t r a d i t i o n , they are hardly cultural rookies:
“ We always know something, w h e t h e r
i t ’s about music,fil m , theatre or literature,
and we take the story from there,” says
Carolina Rueda,one of the students.
The daughter of an impassioned
b u l l fighting fan, Rueda studied literature
and worked as a theatre actress. Fr o m
those experiences, she created a narrative
The continent’s storytelling traditions
are nevertheless very rich,a mingling of
three historically oral societies: t h e
indigenous Indian, the African and to a
lesser extent, the local Spanish. “ Th e
European tradition of witches, g o b l i n s
and fairy tales mix in with Indian and
African traditions of the spirits of water,
jungles and mountains,” says Bolivian
writer Victor Montoya.“ There are spirits
that defend nature and severely punish
those who harm it, such as Marimonda in
Colombia and Coipora in Brazil. Th e n
there are the ships condemned to sail the
seas forever, never reaching port, s u c h
as C a l e u ch e in Chile and the Barco Negro
in Nicaragua.And beautiful women who
seduce men but when you kiss them, t h e i r
heads turn into frightening skulls.”
Fortunately these
traditions are still alive.
Oral storytellers, s u c h
a s the Colombian Nico-
lás Buenaventura (see
n e x t article) and Mimi
B a r t h é l e m y, from Haiti,
are spreading them and
linking up with other
oral traditions.
Barthélemy was
born in Port-au-Prince
and gave up the
c o mfort able  l i f e  of
a  d i p l o m a t ’s wife to
compile traditional
Haitian folk tales and
make them better
known throughout the
country and beyond,in
Latin America and Europe. She travelled
to villages to listen to local storytellers
and read books on Haitian anthropology
in Washington libraries.
Kindling pride
in oral heritage
One of the stories she collected was
about the ogre Bakulu Baka, w h o
swallowed the sun and left the country in
darkness until a benevolent god arrived
with a machete and liberated it.“ When I
tell stories,” she says, “I mention Haiti
and how voodoo and Catholicism mingle
t h e r e. In one of my performances, t h e
gods of both religions join hands in
common cause.”
Telling stories is a political gesture
for her.“ When I’m before an audience, I

M i m i , a modern-day woman speaking in
about bullfighting based on stories she
had heard since childhood, with some
extra help from books about the sport.
The structure of her show is rather like a
bullfight,with six parts, like the six bulls
that traditionally feature in an afternoon
performance.
Narrative tricks
The storytellers have dropped simple,
linear narration and delved into the
language of films and advertising. O n e
of them tells a half-hour story about a
3 0-second TV spot in which a drop of
tomato sauce falls from the 22nd floor of
a building and sets off a gun-battle in the
centre of Bogotá.
Diego Camargo, the storyteller
mentioned above who lost one of his
characters in the midst
of his performance,h a s
also written a tale in 174
two-syllable words. B u t
because it is difficult for
the character to kill
himself with three-
s y llable “b a l a zo s”
( S p a n i s h for bullets),h e
asks the audience to
allow him a bit of poetic
licence and ends the
story with a loud “p u m -
pum!”(bang-bang!).
Through such
narrative tricks, the new
movement is breaking
with tradition, c u l l i n g
inspiration from post-
modern authors such as
Italo Calvino and his I f on a Wi n t e r’s
Night a Tr a v e l l e r. The Colombian
storytellers have thus managed to capture
a media-educated urban audience for
their art, which is filling public squares
and theatres.
Using both ancestral and post-
modern tales, the storytellers are reviving
among Latin Americans the ritual of
listening to stories, those priceless
moments of communication that begin
for us all with the first stories we hear
from our parents and grandparents.Th e y
are occasions that can spark novel feelings
and reactions in a world ruled by the
e v e r-present screen.A direct one-to-one

and a real human being who looks you
straight in the eye and invites you to

UNESCO COURIER JOURNALIST
The world accord i n g
to Nicolás Buenaventura
Early on, Colombian storyteller Nicolás Buenaventura learned that “you have to invent the truth
every day.” With several storytellers in his family tree, he treats his gift with reverence and warmth of
spirit
fter a few minutes of introduction,N i c o l á s
Buenaventura realized that for the first
time, he was before an audience that had
grown up without listening to stories—
street children who had never heard of
The Little Red Riding Hood. It was
midnight in Bogotá and the faces of these
youngsters lit up. Once upon a time,
people referred to them as street urchins,
but as the country’s situation deteriorated,
they simply became billed as rejects.
So he decided to tell his version of
how the world was created.“There was
once a God who managed to resist the
unfortunate temptation of making Man in
his own image.First he created the Earth,
and when he saw it was round and
beautiful, he was left with lots of teeny
tiny bits and pieces.Then he created time
and when that started moving forward,h e
was left again with lots of teeny tiny bits
and pieces.” The children shouted and
clapped as the storyteller rose to a higher
emotional pitch to end his tale.“There’s
always a moment in life when you feel
you don’t belong in the world,and that’s
t e r r i b l e.But if you know the story of To m
Thumb, you know that even the tiniest
living thing has its place in the world.”
Buenaventura found his own place in
the world through storytelling.The boys in
his neighbourhood were quick to discover
his young talent. Because he did not have
enough money to go to the cinema, t h e y
clubbed together to buy him a ticket so
that he could tell them the film from A to
Z afterwards. Today he makes a living
from storytelling and dreams of directing
his second feature fil m .
Like all his family, Nicolás was born
with a storyteller’s gift.His father Enrique
is one of Colombia’s leading playwrights
and theatre
d i r e c t o r s. H i s
g r a n d f a t h e r
C o r n e l i o, a tireless
c o n v e r s a t i o n a l i s t
and professional
s t o r y t e l l e r, a l w a y s
repeated that “ y o u
have to invent the
truth every day.” So
whenever he walked
down the street,
people would call
out:“Hey, Cornelio,
make up a little bit of truth for me, will
you?”
Daily bread
But Nicolás did not get his enthusiasm
for storytelling from them.His inspiration
came from Fermín Ríos, a black
storyteller from Colombia’s main Pacific
port of Buenaventura.“Fermín told me:
‘I must tell you the story of the boy who
lost his bomboro [a magical realist term
that stands for any type of object],but he
never did. The next year, he said: ‘ N o,
you’re still not ready to hear it.’” Finally,
he died and Nicolás had to go searching
the world for the story himself. So far, h e
has found six versions of it—three in
Colombia and three in Africa.
The Colombian ones form the story of
the origin of the river Ti m b i q u i . On a visit
to Burkina Fa s o, he told the story in a
v i l l a g e. “Because I was a storyteller, I
w a s n ’t seen as a foreigner.People realized
I was bringing back stories they had given
or lent to us centuries ago.” Stories do
not need a passport to travel,he says.A l l
the world’s people ask the same
questions—why are we here, why do we
have to die, what are we made of?—and
the answers change from place to place.
For ethnologists, these oral stories stand
midway between question and answer.
After visiting three African countries,
Nicolás understood how “telling a story is
like putting bread on the table.”This only
enhanced his deep respect for all stories.
Perhaps it explains why he  staunchly
opposes his stories being used for other
p u r p o s e s, such as by schools to encourage
r e a d i n g.S t o r y t e l l i n g, he says, c a n ’t happen
without an audience. There is no set
ending in storytelling, and if there was
o n e, it would be a story in itself.
“Storytellers are the cups out of which
people drink stories,” he says.
Do stories change people? “In any
c a s e, they changed me. I’m more sensitive
now to life’s nuances.” And do stories
change the world? Nicolás replies by
telling what happened to him one night in
Bogotá as he was making his way home.
“I was suddenly surrounded by some
street kids and I thought ‘I’m going to
be robbed.’ But no. Instead,I heard one
of them shouting a familiar line at me:‘ h e
was left with lots of teeny tiny bits and

T
RENÉ LEFORT
DIRECTOR OF THE UNESCO COURIER
Striking media giants
with news on the We b
The Internet offers an unparalleled chance to spread an alternative to the news served up by the
mainstream media, the “second power” of globalization, affirmed the World Social Forum in Porto
Alegre
he organizers of the World Social Fo r u m
in Porto Alegre, Brazil,were expecting
2,000 people to attend a debate on
“another possible world” in the last
week of January. To their surprise, this
“ a n t i - D a v o s ” attracted 5,000 fans. S o
how did the organizers of the forum,
who like to cast themselves as
v i s i o n a r i e s, explain their all too modest
forecast? Why, the Internet of course:
they had set up a website one month
before the Fo r u m .Although very basic,
it spurred much greater interest than
anticipated.
The unexpected turnout was one
more feather in the cap of the anti-
globalization movement.Activists had
already spent much time pleading for
communication in general—and the
Internet in particular—to be considered
a leading “issue in the fight against
n e o l i b e r a l i s m .”As such, it deserved the
same attention as the campaign for the
Tobin Ta x , the cancellation of Th i r d
World debt or the control of world
financial organizations. If not, t h e y
a r g u e d , cyberspace would become their
adversaries’ haven. According to the
conclusions of a Forum workshop on
communication and citizenship, t h e
Internet has already been instrumental
in shaping the economic and
“ i d e o l o g i c a l ” revolution that has
marked the process of globalization.
An ideological
machine
Workshop participants launched a
stinging indictment:“If the first power is
economic and financial, the second
belongs to the media,” declared Ignacio
Ramonet, director of the monthly Le
Monde Diplomatique, upon opening
the workshop. “It is the ideological
machine of globalization.” P a r t i c i p a n t s
asserted that mainstream news “ i s
essentially transformed into a
commodity…that does not obey any
rule except that of the market. It is
u n i f o r m , one-dimensional and based
on a single source.” Continuing the
a t t a c k , Ramonet asserted that the
mainstream media strikes a tone that is
“ e m o t i o n a l ,” “ i m p r e s s i o n i s t i c,”
“ s e n s a t i o n a l i s t ,” “ r h e t o r i c a l ,”
“simplistic” if not outright “infantile,”
and which is dominated by a quest for
“ i m m e d i a cy.” In short, “the supreme
c r i t e r i a ” of media “ m e g a - g r o u p s ” is not
truth but profit. “ Th e y ’re selling
consumers to their advertisers.”
The organizations attending Porto
Alegre decided that it was high time to
take on this “ideological apparatus,”
using the Internet as their chief weapon.
One strategy involves criticizing the
news produced by the “mega groups”—
criticism that must not only be
systematic, but should also be diffused
as widely as possible.A leading example
is FA I R , the best known media
Coming up with alternatives:the World Social Forum,held in Porto Alegre, Brazil,in January 2001.

watchdog in North A m e r i c a . Th e
organization aims to show how the
structures of media conglomerates
dictate content: the topics and
viewpoints developed are those of an
economic and political elite because
these media belong to multinationals
and are financed by others via
advertising.
According to Seth A c k e r m a n ,one of
FA I R ’s staff members, the Internet
boasts three advantages over other
forms of communication, including the
g r o u p ’s magazine quarterly
E x t r a !. Fi r s t , it provides
instant access to a wide
range of alternative news
s o u r c e s, allowing the
network to pick up on
important matters ignored
by North A m e r i c a n
mainstream media or to
reveal a fine-tuned
understanding of biased
c o v e r a g e. S e c o n d l y, FA I R
can dispatch to-the-minute
analyses at minimal cost to
s u b s c r i b e r s. Th i r d l y, it can
involve subscribers in the
o r g a n i z a t i o n ’s campaigns
by encouraging them to
email protest messages to
media in FAIR’s spotlight.
“ Thanks to the Internet,
our activities made such a
huge quantitative leap that
t h e y ’ve also changed
q u a l i t a t i v e l y,” s a y s
Ackerman.
The second front that
a n t i - g l o b a l i z a t i o n
organizations are intent on
opening is far more
a m b i t i o u s. The goal is to
make the Internet the
vehicle for a stream of “ c o u n t e r
i n f o r m a t i o n ” or “ a l t e r n a t i v e
i n f o r m a t i o n ” aimed at a mass audience,
far larger than the narrow circle of
activists that all other mediums charged
with the same purpose—the written
p r e s s, radio and television—have
managed to reach.
Diverse sources,
grand ambitions
“ Wh a t ’s really new about the
Internet—and its chief asset—is that
the entry ticket is infinitely more
affordable than for any other more
traditional media,” says Je a n - P i e r r e
M a r t h o z1 of Human Rights Wa t c h .“ Th e
technical and political obstacles, s u c h
as getting around potential censorship,
and above all the financial ones, in terms
of investment and operating costs, b e a r
no comparison with those faced by
someone wishing to start up a
newspaper or a radio or TV station.
Internet opens the way for a diversity of
voices that has been unheard of until
n o w.” Antonio Martins, head of the
Brazilian edition of the M o n d e
D i p l o m a t i q u e, adds that distribution
channels are nearly unlimited on the
w e b,whereas hertzian wavelengths have
to be shared among a limited number of
users.
In short, the Internet radically
changes the information on offer
because it can harbour an unrivalled
number of information sources. Given
that one of the main criticisms of media
conglomerates is their “single source”
c h a r a c t e r, this makes the Internet all
the more appealing says Henri Maler, o f
AC R I M E D ( A c t i o n - c r i t i q u e - m é d i a s ) ,a n
NGO devoted to media monitoring.
According to Maler, the rising costs of
keeping a staff of journalists up and
running means news is based on an
increasingly narrow range of sources.
A first attempt at striking back was
made last December in Bangalore,
I n d i a , by some 30 journalists and writers.
Their starting point was twofold:
throughout the world, they stated,
“ d i s c o u r a g e d ” o r
“ d i s i l l u s i o n e d ”p r o f e s s i o n a l
journalists want to restore
some “nobility to their job,
based on a social and
democratic commitment.”
They can’t do so, however,
because employers stand in
the way of publishing
“articles that the public
wants but never sees in
p r i n t .” Their goal is hence
“to enrich the public
information space… and
create a critical mass of
alternative information”
through “articles in the
written press and broadcast
reports that can contribute
to a socio-economic, c u l t u r a l
and political alternative” t o
g l o b a l i z a t i o n .The ambition
is titanic: to launch a news
service on the Internet that
would sell its products and
succeed in  “becoming a
counterweight to the
mainstream media’s
stereotyped information.”
It would be “ a
complementary channel,”
rich in professionally
packaged content.
Professionals
or not?
To “communicate well, you need a
range of skills,” underlines Ramonet.
“You can know the truth and have no
impact because you don’t know how to
c o m m u n i c a t e. To think that the truth
will naturally impose itself is to take an
arrogant and contemptuous attitude
towards citizens.The price of this is an
absolute absence of communication.”

“A diversity of sources does not
necessarily lead to an avalanche of
quality information, something which
only results from a thorough process
of checking, selecting and setting in
context to give meaning,” says Marthoz.
“The process still requires the hand of
intermediaries who may not be
journalists in the classical sense but
‘ p a r a - j o u r n a l i s t s ’ .” He points to his
o r g a n i z a t i o n ’s site,which has become an
almost indispensable source of
information for anyone wanting to keep
abreast of human rights in the world.
Some 10,000 cybernauts visit the site
each day, according to Marthoz,b e c a u s e
the information placed online is
collected by reliable experts and edited
by seasoned experts in communication.
If this type of alternative service is
anything to go by, audience rhymes with
credibility, which in turn calls for some
form of professional involvement.Not
t r u e, declares Roberto Savio of the Inter
Press service, which has been serving
up alternative news since 1964: t h i s
strategy risks running a lap behind
current trends.Although IPS relies on a
network of journalists in over 100
countries and counts more than 30,000
NGO subscribers on its online service,
Savio, a pioneer of alternative news, is
getting ready to step down and launch
other ventures.
Civil society,he asserts, and youth in
p a r t i c u l a r, reject outright all institutions
or outfits functioning along vertical
lines. It follows that the attempt to use
the Internet as a carrier for a news
counterweight while upholding the key
position of the journalist—producing
information from on high for the public
below—is doomed to fail.It even rests
on a deep contradiction, r e p r o d u c i n g
via Internet the same vertical model
characteristic of all other media even
though the web offers the chance to
start a “communication society”
operating horizontally.
The Brazilian
model
Brazil’s Rits (Information network
for the third sector) is one such new
communication network that believes
the Internet’s advent will allow the well-
worn revolutionary slogan “of giving a
voice to the people” to come true at
last.“Let the people who live the story
tell it,” declares the network.For a start,
you do away with the costs of fin a n c i n g
a team of journalists. R e d ’s associates—
some 200 organizations from the “ t h i r d
sector” (neither public nor private)—
exchange around 10,000 messages a
week and express themselves without
any supervision or editorial advice.Th e
only protection is an ethical code that
dictates what can be put on the site.
With or without professional
i n t e r v e n t i o n , whether raw or edited,
can alternative news find its place in
the limelight simply because it’s
alternative? Judging from present
t r e n d s, Ramonet is mildly optimistic.
“As the overall education level rises,
that of the media is getting worse.Th e r e
will come a time when the two will cross
o v e r : more and more groups and social
categories are dissatisfied with the
m e d i a ’s infantile discourse.” Wh i l e
“nothing is won in advance, b e c a u s e
we’ll also have to be appealing, to win
over hearts and souls,” Martins insists
that once a site is up and running, the
Internet gives a chance to take on media
conglomerates on equal terms, a n
impossible task in the print press or
b r o a d c a s t i n g.M a r t h o z ,h o w e v e r, is more
s c e p t i c a l . “ Th e r e ’s no reason for the
Internet to escape the newstand effect.
Just as the average reader first buys the
most prominent publications at a
n e w s t a n d , the average cybernaut will
first go to the best-known portals
( Ya h o o ! , Google etc). But the latter
select what information is posted,just
like the gatekeepers of the traditional
m e d i a .While Internet offers room for a
large number of information producers,
the tunnel effect is well and truly there
on the receiving end.”
Marthoz also foresees another
s c e n a r i o. “Rather than think that the
Internet will become an authentic
information counterweight, its main
effect will stem from how it influences
the mainstream media.In this respect,
there is no comparison with what the
alternative print press or broadcasting
can do. An alternative site can
immediately be seen by the whole
p l a n e t .” Proof of this is how the world’s
p r e s s, including the most prestigious
p u b l i c a t i o n s, consulted the Human
Rights Watch site to keep up on the
Chechnya war and even find “stories.”
The force of
the alternative
The “Internet mystique” does not
convince AC R I M E D’s Maler “ M a k i n g
the web’s  immense democratic
potential a reality does not depend
chiefly on the tool itself,” he says.“The
space given by the public to alternative
n e w s, as opposed to commodified news,
will be a reflection of the alternative
forces carrying it.” In other words,
between the Internet and anti-
globalization activists, w h o ’s the chicken
and who’s the egg? ■

N o. Th e
economists’ myth tells us that exchange
f u l fills a simple instrumental function.
You live in a community that produces
yams and I live in a community that
raises pigs, so we enter into an
exchange in order to vary our diets.
One fine day, to facilitate our
t r a n s a c t i o n s, we invent a system of
equivalence between our products—
money—and there you have it. B u t ,a s
anthropologists have shown us, M a r c e l
Mauss in particular, the main form of
exchange in so-called “ p r i m i t i v e ”
societies is the gift, which cannot be
reduced to economic rationality.
that makes this point: “ Your own
m o t h e r, your own sister, your own pigs,
your own yams,you may not eat.Th o s e
of other people,you may eat.” If you eat
your own yams,your neighbour is liable
to think they’re better than his, a n d
your relationship could turn
acrimonious.
Even if my yams are just like his?
Even then, there could arise what
the thinker René Girard (see inset)
calls a mimetic rivalry, based on
reciprocal imitation. The neighbour
who sees you feasting on your yams
will want to do the same as you, that is,

“We continue to p e rs e c u t e victims but are
now a s h a m e d to do so: that is pro g re s s”
ON GIVING, TRADING 
AND RITUAL SAC R I F I C E
Adam Smith (1723-1790) recommended giving free rein to individual rivalries with the idea
that their combination produced order. To describe this phenomenon, he invented the
metaphor of the “invisible hand of the market.”
Marcel Mauss (1872-1950) described, in The Gift, the systems of ritual exchange among
native Americans or Melanesians. For him, the gift is a “total social fact,” at once religious,
economic, political, matrimonial, legal.… Today, the Mouvement anti-utilitariste dans les
sciences sociales (MAUSS) lays claim to his heritage and criticizes economic
reductionism(www.revuedumauss.com).
In The Elementary Structures of Kinship, Claude Lévi-Strauss analyzes marriage as a form
of reciprocity between kin groups, but he does not explain its origin (see Lucien Scubla, Lire
Lévi-Strauss, Odile Jacob, 1998).
René Girard has taught in the United States since 1947. His writings take us back to the
violent origins of exchange. In all human relationships, he discerns the mechanism of mimetic
rivalry, set forth in his first major work, Deceit, Desire and the Novel. We desire only what
others desire. When this contagious rivalry seizes hold of a whole community, it is not
appeased until the “all against all”is transformed into an “all against one.” One antagonist
is killed and peace returns. The victim then appears all-powerful since he or she was able to
restore order. His following book, Violence and the Sacred, shows how the sacred arises out of
s a c r i fic e. In 
The Scapegoat, he develops the idea that the Christian scriptures inaugurated a long process
of questioning this founding violence. Latest book: I Saw Satan Falling Like Lightning (Orbis, in
p r e s s ) . The journal C o n t a g i o n publishes the work of “ G i r a r d i a n ” s c h o l a r s
(http://theol.uibk.ac.at.cover.index.html).
he will want to eat your yams. Wh a t
seems to be desirable to you becomes
desirable for him. But if he tries to
appropriate your yams for himself, y o u
w o n ’t want to surrender them. Wh a t
is desirable for him becomes equally
desirable for you. In this manner
people can easily come to blows over
n o t h i n g. Ritual prohibitions serve to
prevent rivalries of this kind.The incest
t a b o o, for example, keeps men from
fighting for the women who are closest
at hand, those who belong to the same
f a m i l y.A crime of passion could trigger
a general crisis. It is hard for us to
conceive just how dangerous the
slightest dispute can be in a community
with no police or judicial system. A s
with a hemophiliac, any bloodshed
could prove fatal. If you kill your
neighbour when he tries to grab your
yams, his relatives will come after you
n e x t . Each act of violence must be
avenged by a new act of violence, and
the ensuing chain reaction can
ultimately engulf the entire community.
Doesn’t this approach betray the belief
that human beings are fundamentally
violent?
People are not fundamentally
violent,they are fundamentally social.
Once they have satisfied their material
instincts—eating and reproducing—
they still sense a lack. They desire
something more, but what? Since
Fr e u d ,we assume that desire is the most
i n d i v i d u a l ,most intimate thing there is
about a person. For René Girard, this is
a romantic myth. On the contrary,
people do not know what to desire, it is
something they must learn.And they
learn it in the same way they learn all
the essential things in life: by observing
and imitating others. Humans are
incomplete beings who are born
radically dependent on others. It is no
wonder they show themselves to be
fascinated by others. But it is precisely
p e o p l e ’s fascination with each other
which brings them so easily into confli c t ,
and can sometimes embroil them in the
worst forms of violence.
All your explanations presuppose a
universal human nature.
I believe one should stand firm on
this point: y e s, there is a universal
human nature. That does not mean
that people everywhere are identical.
Since people do not know instinctively
what they want to do in life, t h e i r
culture must offer them answers.
O b v i o u s l y, the range of answers varies
from one culture to another. It is not
such and such a model of behaviour
that is universal,it is the need to have
m o d e l s. If people do not know what to
desire, if each person tends to desire
what others desire, the culture must
channel desires in such a way that they
do not constantly converge on the
same objects.It must defuse the vicious
circleof reciprocal desire, where each
wants what the other wants, or risk
descending into reciprocal violence.
The paradoxical law of revenge
commands the killing of the killer.A n d
the killer’s killer? Here one falls into a
new vicious circle.
And is there any way out?
What interests me is precisely to
see how the shift is made from vicious
circles to virtuous ones, from the
negative reciprocity of violence to the
positive reciprocity of the gift. Wi t h
v e n g e a n c e, each person responds to an
offence committed by the other, each
reacts to what the other has already
d o n e. This comes down to letting
oneself be dominated by the past. I n
gift exchange, on the other hand, one
turns toward the future and anticipates
the desire of the other. Instead of
waiting for your neighbour to come
steal your yams, you offer them to him
t o d a y, and it is up to him to do the same
for you tomorrow.Once you have made

a gift,he is obliged to make a return gift.
Now you have set in motion a positive
circularity.
One which makes it possible to escape
the circle of violence?
Ye s, but through one last act of
v i o l e n c e. By killing a “ s a c r i fic e a b l e ”
violent reci- procity of the gift.
But how does market exchange come
to take the place of the gift?
First let’s see what distinguishes
t h e m . When you offer me so many
sheep, or shells, or shields, you make a
display of your prestige, and I must at
least match your generosity with a
return gift. On the contrary,a monetary
payment nips the relationship in the
b u d : it relieves one of any return
o b l i g a t i o n .A market transaction leaves
the seller and buyer free of any ties.
Just as the gift breaks the circle of
vengeance, money breaks the circle of
the gift. I asked myself how such a
transaction could arise within a ritual
c o n t e x t . In Vedic writings from ancient
India, we see that monetary payment
begins with the compensation of the
s a c r i ficial priest, a b r a h m a n who carries
out a dangerous task and whom one
prefers to keep at arm’s length.In the
Greek world, money is associated with
the figure of the tyrant.He is a usurper,
a king whose legitimacy does not derive
from traditional structures. To get
around the system of reciprocal
obligations which he challenges, h e
must resort to employing mercenaries,
whom he pays off with money. War, a
ritual activity, becomes a professional
o n e. In our monetary economies, a l l
transactions involve this distancing
mechanism which originally targeted
those charged with carrying out ritual
v i c t i m , meaning one
whose death will not
trigger further acts of
vengeance within the
g r o u p : a slave, a n
imprisoned enemy, an
animal.… In a peace
ritual described by
a n t h r o p o l o g i s t
Raymond Jamous, the
murderer leads his
people to the territory
of his victim.His hands
bound and a knife in
his teeth, he offers
himself as a new
v i c t i m , he anticipates
the desire for revenge
of his adversaries. But
rather than killing the
murderer as they
would if the cycle of
vengeance were to
c o n t i n u e, they take the
knife and sacrifice an
animal in his stead.To
seal the end of
h o s t i l i t i e s, t h e
members of both camps join together
in eating the animal.Not only will this
victim not be avenged,but it provides
the feast which launches a new cycle of
positive reciprocity.The rite which puts
an end to a vendetta facilitates the
transition between the reciprocal
violence of vengeance and the non-
Abraham and Isaac:the birth of an “anti-sacrificial”consciousness.

“If your neighbour is h u n g r y, you have
n o o b l i g a t i o n to feed him”
violence.
So you trace market exchange back to
sacrificial rituals?
In these examples we already see
the beginning of an impulse to thrust
away the operators of sacrifice. Later,
s a c r i fice itself will be banished.All our
history is a long process of awakening
an anti-sacrificial consciousness.Fi r s t ,a n
animal replaces the human victim, as in
the story of Abraham and Isaac. Then
the day comes when people hesitate
even to butcher the animal. R e n é
Girard attributes the origin of this
awakening of consciousness to the
Biblical texts, the Gospels in particular.
One may also find anti-sacrificial
messages in other traditions, i n
Buddhism for example. But one does
not have to be Christian to
acknowledge the force of René Girard’s
analyses, or to follow him in reflecting
on where the decay of religious myths
and rituals may lead.If sacrificial rites,
while producing victims, made it
possible to avoid even greater violence,
what will happen in the absence of
rites? We know that human progress
has always been fragile, with steps
backward accompanying every step
f o r w a r d . I believe it is important,
n e v e r t h e l e s s, to defend the notion of
p r o g r e s s. Even if we continue to
persecute victims, we are now ashamed
to do so:that is progress.
We have learned to recognize the victims.
But our morality adapts quite well to
the market economy, which also
produces victims of another sort.
Monetary transactions sever the
bond between exchange partners; t h e y
eliminate all obligations of reciprocity.
If your neighbour is hungry, you have
no obligation to feed him; if he is
evicted from his home and freezes to
d e a t h ,you have no obligation to avenge
h i m . As Canadian philosopher Paul
Dumouchel observes, the elimination of
the obligation of revenge keeps
violence from spreading from one
individual to the next,but at the same
time it universalizes the category of
“ s a c r i fic e a b l e ” v i c t i m s, those whose
death will not result in vengeance. In
this sense, we continue to sacrifice
anonymous victims. In his book L e
sacrifice et l’envie (“Sacrifice and
E n v y ” ) ,French philosopher Je a n - P i e r r e
Dupuy shows the extent to which the
spectre of sacrifice haunts the thinking
of the major theorists of the market
economy.
Why not set ourselves the objective of
returning to the gift?
We have not completely left it,
f o r t u n a t e l y. G i f t s, including services
within the household, still hold an
important place. In Fr a n c e, by the
conservative estimate of one economist,
Ahmet Insel, gifts are of a magnitude
equivalent to about three-quarters of
G D P. We should aim for a balance
between the gift sector and the market
sector. But this balance is threatened
today by the imperialism of market
l o g i c. It is that logic therefore which
must be questioned. O b v i o u s l y, we will
not go back to archaic forms of
e x c h a n g e. These presuppose a ritual
framework which has vanished.A new
religion cannot be made to order.
But hasn’t the market economy take n
the place of religion?
The ritual framework of primitive
exchanges entails the presence of
invisible mediators. The spirit of the

gift obliges the recipient to make a
return gift,Marcel Mauss tells us.A d a m
S m i t h , the father of liberal political
e c o n o m y, likewise invokes a hidden
spirit when he talks about the invisible
hand of the market. Of course, h e
means this as a simple metaphor: the
market is supposed to be self-
r e g u l a t i n g, functioning best without
visible intervention on the part of the
S t a t e. But nothing guarantees that, l e f t
to itself, the market will converge on a
satisfactory equilibrium. History tends
rather to prove the opposite. In this
s e n s e, the doctrine of the invisible hand
does depend on quasi-religious faith. I t
serves mainly to absolve people of the
consequences of their actions.
When a jumbo jet falls to the
g r o u n d , there is an investigation to
determine who is responsible.But every
day, the number of people who die of
hunger in the world is equivalent to
the number who would perish if several
hundred jumbo jets crashed. N o
investigation is needed: the market is
r e s p o n s i b l e. Which is another way of
saying nobody. Nobody is individually
responsible for a violence which is
collectively accepted, just as the
violence of sacrifice is collectively
accepted.
The opponents of market globalization
advocate the establishment of “ f a i r
t ra d e.” Isn’t this a contradiction in terms,
if the market is by nature irre s p o n s i b l e ?
Why not develop fair trade? In
r e a l i t y, the partisans of market
globalization claim that they themselves
want to promote the interests of poor
w o r k e r s.This is a good illustration of the
ethical progress we were talking about:
everybody recognizes the central
importance of the victims. But the alibi
is pretty flimsy because poor workers
are perfectly able to determine what is
in their own interest. Their union
representatives could organize an
international summit to negotiate a fair
framework for trade themselves—at
Davos, for example. Just as war is too
serious a matter to be left to the
generals, trade is too serious to be left
to the captains of finance.
Montesquieu said that the natural effect
of trade is to lead to peace.Your analyses
do not seem to confirm this adage.
Globalization means the
development of market exchange
among nations. N o w, despite the
existence of the United Nations, t h e
international arena still displays one of
the essential features of primitive
s o c i e t y : the absence of the State. In true
primitive societies, where gift exchange
p r e d o m i n a t e s, one sometimes finds
transactions quite similar to market
e x c h a n g e. These transactions are
practiced solely with foreigners towards
whom no duty of solidarity exists.Wi t h
them,one has the right to cheat,steal,
or wage war. Lévi-Strauss alludes to
markets of this type where buyers and
sellers are ready to fight at the slightest
provocation and goods are offered at
s p e a r- p o i n t .That reminds me of a N e w
York Times journalist, an advocate of
globalization, who explained that the
invisible hand of the market must be
accompanied by an iron fist. I am
skeptical about the idea that an
expansion of international trade leads
to peace.The same idea was expressed
the last time a comparable level of
economic integration between
countries was reached, early in the last
century.
And?
And then the First World War came
along and dispelled this illusion.
