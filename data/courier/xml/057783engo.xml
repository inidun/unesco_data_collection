Nasredin and the moon
"GodLittle Nasredin was listening to his teacher reading a passage from the Koran
gave brilliance to the sun, and radiance to the moon".
Which is the more useful, the sun or the moon? asked the teacher.
The moon, replied Nasredin without a moment's hesitation.
And why is that?
Because the sun only comes when it's daylight. But the moon lights up the world
when it's dark.
The old teacher sighed and deemed it wiser to return to the rules of grammar.

To the people of the Middle East
the name Nasredin always in¬

Nasredin was a famous story
teller-philosopher-jokester who
lived in Anatolia during the
13th centurybut who he ac¬
tually was, where he came from
and where he went remains a
mystery. Turkey claims him as
its national hero, in a sense so
does Iran. There are those who
say he never actually lived. But
his anecdotes, mined from the
rich vein of folk wisdom and
always humorous, are more
alive today than ever, from Tur¬

Along with the higher quality and more
abundant harvests which science is
helping the farmer to win from his
fields, new foods are making their
appearance on the market. Originally
conceived and produced in scientific
laboratories, these foods are "artificial"
only in terms of the techniques used
in their manufacture. They provide all
the elements of a balanced diet, and
in particular the vital proteins and amino
acids. Photo shows various cells and
other organisms as seen under the

THE NEW FOOD
REVOLUTION
by Cene Gregory
U

JNTIL relatively recently, all
too few practical measures had been
taken to come to grips with the prob¬
lem of producing more food of the
kind that was needed in the places it
was needed most.
Much attention has been given to
throttling, by medicinal or other arti¬
ficial means, the population explosion
ironically enough, due largely in the
first place to the Introduction of
modern medicine in less-developed
countries. But one serious estimate,
by the U.S. scientist and educator
Harrison Brown in "The Challenge of
Man's Future," holds that the earth
could with technology now within
our reach sustain a population of
50 thousand million, which even at
the uncontrolled rate of present popu¬
lation growth would not be attained
for four or five generations.
Since the evidence to date is that
birth control methods simply are not
working, and are not likely to be fully
effective for another generation or two,
more immediate solutions to the
world's food problem must be sought
elsewhere. Highest priority must be
given to the expansion of food pro¬
duction, within each of the lesser-
developed countries.
Food aid, while beneficial as a stop¬
gap measure to relieve famine caused
by drought or flood, tends to attack
the symptoms rather than the causes.
While necessary in times of distress,
even when food aid is maintained for
a few years only, it breeds an
unwholesome attitude of dependence
among the recipients and makes it
very difficult for local agriculture ever
to get properly organized in face of
competition from "free food."
GENE GREGORY has made a close study of
food manufacturing and processing, particu¬
larly in Asia. He is a chemical engineer,
business consultant and journalist and was
formerly editor-in-chief of the "Weekly Tri¬
bune", Geneva, Switzerland, and a member
of the editorial board of "Asia Magazine",
Hong Kong. He spent many years in
South-East Asia where he was a foreign
correspondent for Reuters Agency and held
several editorial posts. He has written widely
on economic and political questions.
Even where shipments of agricul¬
tural goods have been used to
generate local currencies which in
turn become part of the overall funds
available for economic aid pro¬
grammes, those funds have too often
been diverted into the development of
new non-agriculture-related Industries
rather than improving and increasing
food production.
The possession of a steel mill, a
national airline and a polyethelene
plant have been considered as symbols
of progress but were in fact monu¬
ments to the misconceived notion of
planners that somehow these invest¬
ments constituted a short cut to the
solution of underdevelopme'nt prob¬
lems.
Even though as much as 80 per cent
of the population of the less-developed
countries is engaged ¡n agricultural
pursuits, according to a recent review
of the Development Assistance Com¬
mittee of the Organization for Econo¬
mic Co-operation and Development
(OECD), only 12 per cent of the total
aid flow (including food aid) went to
agriculture. As a result of misplaced
emphasis on industrialization, agricul¬
ture was deprived of needed local
investment Inputs at all levels Irri¬
gation, manufacture of fertilizers and
pesticides, research, education, pro¬
cessing industries.
In a sense, the fearful spectre of a
world food crisis was a blessing in
disguise. There came a widespread
recognition of the truth that while
massive emergency food aid could
alleviate much of the immediate
suffering, a change of emphasis ¡n
foreign aid programmes was long
overdue.
But perhaps even more Important,
the urgency of immediate action on
the part of the governments of lesser-
developed countries provoked a
general up-grading of agricultural
priorities for investments as well as a
lifting of some of the Impedimenta
that have prevented private foreign
capital from investing in industries
for the manufacture of badly needed
agricultural inputs and the processing
of farm products for the home and
export markets.
But, as yet, in the lesser-developed
countries, all of them agricultural
countries, there has been almost no
agricultural research or higher agri¬
cultural education. Three exceptions
are examples for all governments to
imitate:
Mexico, which had for years
imported half of the wheat consumed
in the country, after an extensive
wheat research programme begun in
1944 and conducted by the Rockefeller
Foundation, was self-sufficient in this
grain by 1956, and in 1964 exported
a half million tons.
At Los Banos in the Philippines,
research sponsored jointly by the
Rockefeller and Ford Foundations
developed new varieties of rice, the
IR 5 and IR 8, which increase yields
up to 8.5 tons per acre or about
15 times the average yield of tradi¬
tional varieties. As a result, in the
short span of about three years the
Philippines has been transformed from
a rice deficit to a rice surplus country.
American aid agronomists adapted
improved varieties of Guatemalan
corns to Indonesia and Thailand which
did, in fact, produce something of an
agricultural revolution in the latter.
In eight years the crop in Thailand
increased from non-existent production
to an export of $104 million, the fourth
largest corn export ¡n the world.
Extended to other critical food
deficit areas, the results of these
research efforts, largely privately
financed, have produced a veritable
"green revolution" in the world's most
food deficient regions which just two
years ago were threatened by
widespread and seemingly continu¬
ing famine.

THE NEW FOOD REVOLUTION (Continued)
In India, the area planted with
new varieties of wheat, rice, millet
and sorghum increased from about
23,000 acres in 1965-66 to nearly
4 million acres one year later. As a
result, India harvested 95.6 million
tons in 1967-68, and expects to achieve
self-sufficiency in 1970-71 (see text
opposite).
Pakistan, which imported large
quantities of Mexican wheat seed,
will harvest a record 5.5 million ton
grain crop this year; and by 1970
should be producing twice as much
food grains as in 1965, enough to meet
the country's requirements.
Particularly noteworthy results have
been obtained by development teams
of the Republic of China in African
countries where they have introduced
their Taiwan Native 1 rice species.
Extensive experiments in the Cam-
eroons, Gabon, Gambia, Malawi, Niger,
Senegal, Chad and Togo by these
teams have more than doubled
production obtained with traditional
rice strains.
As a result of these and other
developments, farming has suddenly
become both respectable and lucrative
in many countries.
In Rome, early last October, Addeke
H. Boerma, Director-General of FAO,
expressed cautious optimism that
"the long lag in food production which
plagued the past decade may be
coming to an end." And in Paris, he
told delegates to a Unesco Interna¬
tional scientific conference on the use
and conservation of the resources of
the biosphere, "I believe that the
agriculture of the developing countries
is now reaching the point of 'take-off'."
(See the "Unesco Courier," January
1969.)
But the coming agricultural revolu¬
tion is not confined to progress in
the developing countries. New but
untried ideas will displace a whole
raft of outdated notions about food
production first in the advanced
industrial countries, but eventually
profoundly affecting the developing
countries.
For the first time in history the
prospect is that there will be enough
food produced to feed, and feed well,
all mankind despite the fact that the
population will grow in the next
31 years as much as it has in the last
1,000,000 years. Predictions for the
remaining three decades of this cent¬
ury, based upon a two-year study
of U.S. agriculture just completed,
include:
Wheat harvests will jump to
300 bushels per acre, more than ten
times present yields.
Corn output will reach 500 bushels

<![CDATA[
TOWARDS SELF-SUFFICIENCY IN FOOD
INDIA is in the midst of a dramatic revolu¬
tion: using new, high-yield food grains, chemical
fertilizers, progressive mechanization and modern
irrigation techniques, this nation of 540 million people
long cited as proof of the inevitability that the
world's population must increase faster than its
ability to feed it expects to be self sufficient in food
production by 1970-1971.
This extraordinary leap forward, has been made
possible by the successful development of high-
yielding strains of rice, wheat, jowar, bajra, maize,
groundnut, linseed, rapeseed, mustard, lucerne, etc.
This means that the Indian farmer is now able to
increase production not by 15 to 20 per cent but
by 70 to 80 per cent or more.
Working to bring 32.5 million acres (one-eleventh
of India's cultivated area) under the new seed
varieties by 1971, he has so far had remarkable
success. After the disastrous 1965-67 drought, 20
million acres were planted with a sturdy, prolific wheat,
perfected in Mexico. The result was a bumper crop
in 1968 of 16.6 million tons, exceeding the previous
record by 35 per cent (4.3 million tons). Thirty-eight
million tons of rice were grown in the same period,
as well as a record maize crop of 6.3 million tons.
OiINCE arid and underproductive lands are
now blossoming under the benign influence of the
"green revolution" as growers and government work
together to consolidate their achievements. Several
states have launched ambitious programmes to
increase handling capacity, storage, transportation
and distribution of the bigger crops. Punjab's crash
road construction programme is bringing every village
to within two miles of an all weather road.
Spurred on by nationwide promotional measures
including rebates, transport subsidies and credit, the
fertilizer gap is being closed with increased home
production that will reach almost two million tons by
1971 and over five million tons by 1973-1974.
Where one kilogramme of nitrogen used to produce
10 additional kilogrammes of grain, the same amount
now produces 20-25 kilogrammes of the high-yield
crops; the same quantity of water by means of new
technology produces at least 2-3 times more food.
Through scientific management of soil and water,
agronomists and farmers have come up with results
that a few years ago would have been considered
almost impossible. On land whose production capa¬
city was 3-4 tons of grain per hectare, 10-12 tons
are now considered a minimum goal, with 15-20 tons
an immediate possibility.
Among the most important grains are new dwarf
varieties of rice and wheat. India's first high-yield
rice came from Taiwan, followed by a new strain
developed by the Philippine International Rice Insti¬
tute. The dwarf wheat was developed by the Rocke¬
feller Foundation in Mexico, and made available to
India by the Ford Foundation. Standing only 18 inches
high on a sturdy stock, the new wheat can bear more
grain without falling over (see article page 4).
Another decisive factor in India's agricultural
renaissance is its increasing independence from the
vagaries of the monsoon and ancient irrigation
devices. Modern irrigation systems and efficient
electrical and diesel pumps have taken over in many
areas from bullock-powered water wheels and work
will begin next month to extend the area under modern
irrigation by 35 million acres.
Well into the planning stage are projects to harness
nuclear energy for tapping underground water, manu¬
facturing fertilizers and operating agro-industrial com¬
plexes, and current research points to nuclear energy
for desalting sea water for use in agriculture.
Priority has been given to the manufacture of
modern agricultural machinery, which until now has
been mostly imported. Both the power tiller and
tractor industries are exempt from licensing provi¬
sions, and tractor production reached almost 12
thousand units in 1967-1968, compared to only 880
units in 1961-1962. The target for this year is
18 thousand Indian manufactured tractors.
India's problem is no longer that of getting agri¬
culture moving; it is to keep it going. With the
population growing by 13 million each year, pro¬
duction must be increased to 150 million tons to meet
the needs of between 630 and 650 million people in
the latter half of the 1970s. Indians are confident it
can be done. J.S. Kanwar, deputy director-general
of the Indian Council of Agricultural Research, writing
in the Indian journal, Seminar (August 1968), stated
"...A country with 80-90 million acres of irrigated area
should be able to produce without difficulty, even with
the present technology in agriculture, about 300 million
tons of food per annum".
IHE industrious and tenacious Indian farmer,
no longer condemned to subsistence living, is the key -
to continued success. His determination to build upon
the present "green revolution" is being matched by
pragmatic educational programmes to equip him to
deal with management and market problems, and to
use his resources rationally.
The educational and research challenge is being
met by eight new agricultural universities. Quickly
responding to the need, the Punjab University the
state's sole agent for agricultural research has
already established a successful range of programmes
in co-operation with local farmers, while the agri¬
cultural universities of Mysore and Pantnagar have
developed far-sighted research and education policies
tailored to the needs of their respective areas.
Agriculture's new success appears to have checked
the migration of workers to cities and towns, and the
more successful farmers can now earn over $1,300
a year, twice as much as a clerk. Land prices have
risen, medical services in rural areas have improved
and, armed with superior raw materials and benefitting
from advanced technology, the Indian farmer is becom¬
ing a dynamic contributor to national well-being.
India has made impressive progress in a short time; 7
serious problems must still be overcome, but the »
agricultural pattern which has been set is a solid
foundation for future prosperity.

75 bushels.
A single cow will produce as many
as 1,000 calves in its lifetime, as
compared to the present 10, through
the use of hormones which keep the
entire cycle of ovulation and pregnancy
in cows and other domestic animals
under exact control. Embryos will be
transferred from special breeder ani¬
mals to ordinary "incubator" animals
with substantial increases ¡n prolifi¬
cacy of a herd and a radical improve¬
ment in quality animal production.
Milk production will soar to
30,000 pounds per cow from today's
8,000. Synthetic milk will also be
manufactured from carrot tops and
pea pods.
Today's farm labourers will be
increasingly replaced by "farm
engineers," scientists and technicians
trained in fields ranging from elec¬
tronics to air conditioning.
Farming will become automated
and computerized, with tilling of the
soil, planting and harvesting crops
and regulating the growing process
controlled from a centre equipped
with computers, radar and remote
control devices.
Fields will be covered by huge
plastic domes, or by other means
enabling the constant control of
environment affecting crop growth.
Remote-controlled harvesters will
not only pick but also grade, package,
freeze and deliver food to wholesale
depots.
Space satellites will collect up-to-
the-minute data on soil conditions,
insect damage, crop growth patterns
throughout the world, as well as make
long range weather and production
forecasts.

UT this is just a beginning.
In the United States alone there are
presently some 30,000 research pro¬
jects under way, and spending for
agricultural research is more than $850
million annually.
While today 7,000,000 Americans
live on farms producing many times
the volume of food 31,000,000 farmers
produced a century ago, by the
year 2,000 a scant 2,000,000 of the
300,000,000 people in the U.S. will be
"farmers." The average U.S. farmer
now produces enough food to feed
40 people, four times the number he
could feed 30 years ago; in the next
30 years, productivity will increase
another four-fold based upon techno¬
logy already known and within reach.
But in agriculture, as in other fields
that are increasingly science and
technology based, half of what is
known today will be obsolete by 1980.
Or, to put it another way, at the present
rate of technological advance, half of
the agricultural technology of 1980
has not yet been discovered.
One of the most immediate effects
of the coming agricultural revolution,
both in the advanced and in the deve¬
loping countries, will be an increase in
capital intensive farming. Post World
War II increases in mechanization in
the advanced countries have already
far surpassed the "tractor stage":
airplanes are increasingly used to
spray test-tube "miracles" over crops
and pasture lands;
computers determine when and how
to breed calves by artificial insemi¬
nation;
devices such as the "autosow,"
which acts as a kind of mechanical
mother for baby pigs, are turning pig
farming into a mass production indus¬
try much like the poultry business;
the "Bacon Bin," a recently devised
total confinement production facility
complete with automatic feeding and
manure disposal systemscan raise
and fatten 1,000 hogs at once, from
birth to maturity, in record time.
Major International food companies
continue to expand their large-scale
farming activities, primarily in develop¬
ing countries. But since foreign-
owned "plantations" smack of "colon¬
ialism," and for a host of other
impedimenta common to the newly
independent countries, there have been
limited opportunities for private busi¬
ness to contribute directly to the devel¬
opment of badly needed food industries
through this kind of direct invest¬
ment.
With the change of attitudes in the
developing countries toward the deve¬
lopment of the agricultural sector, the
day may not be far off when direct
foreign investments in agricultural
enterprises may again be welcomed,
but for the moment the opportunities
for Investment in the developing
countries lie in other equally interest¬
ing sectors vital to increasing food
production.
Someone must supply the new varie¬
ties of wheat, rice, corn, millet and
sorghum in massive and continuing
quantities at relatively low prices. And
the new "miracle" seed varieties are
not enough by themselves to Insure
the fruition of a green revolution in
the developing countries. Suitable
quantities of fertilizers, insecticides,
water and farm machinery are necess¬
ary. Credit, marketing, and other ser¬
vices of modern agricultural systems
must be made available.
The way the new seed varieties
were introduced into the Philippines,
India and Pakistan had as much to do
with their success as does the quality
of the seeds themselves. Rice "kits"
consisting of the seed, fertilizer, insect¬
icides needed to grow a half-acre of
one of the seed varieties were sold
or distributed together. This novel
distribution concept presents a special
challenge to abilities of international
corporate enterprises to develop the
required joint marketing facilities.
IHE governments of devel¬
oping nations, local private business
and the farmers cannot sustain this
effort without outside help. They lack
the means to do the adaptive research,
the facilities needed to train farmers in
modern agricultural techniques, the
public finances for large-scale irriga¬
tion and rural electrification projects,
or for adequate storage and modern
transport facilities. They often lack
the required technology, capital and
managerial personnel necessary to
build new plants to produce the requir¬
ed seed, fertilizer, insecticide and other
essential inputs.
To meet these needs, governments of
OECD countries have appreciably
Increased their aid to agricultural pro¬
grammes of developing countries ¡n
recent years. The World Bank an¬
nounced in October 1968 that it would
quadruple loans to speed the develop¬
ment of world agriculture. The Inter-
American Development Bank now com¬
mits about 27 per cent of its funds for
agricultural development purposes, and
the Asian Development Bank formed
just two years ago is presently engag¬
ed in a country-by-country survey to
priority projects to be con¬
sidered for assistance by its projected
Agricultural Development Fund.
But producing food ¡s business.
And many of the resources needed
by developing countries to get the
nascent agricultural revolution off the
ground are the almost exclusive pos¬
sessions of private enterprise in west¬
ern industrial countries.

industry for food production ¡n deve¬
loping countries, the FAO has created
the FAO/lndustry Co-operative Pro¬
gramme, a joint effort by the FAO and
International business to resolve prob¬
lems involved in the establishment
of industries in the developing coun¬
tries to manufacture fertilizers, pesti¬
cides and farm implements or to
process food and other agricultural
products. At Its March 1968 meeting,
representatives of 37 major interna¬
tional firms met at FAO headquarters
in Rome to work out a widely accept
able code of conduct for the protection
of private foreign investors in develop¬
ing countries.
The most tangible sign of the effec¬
tiveness of this programme has been
in India's crucial fertilizer industry.
Until the drought of 1965-66, adminis¬
trative and political problems had pre¬
vented an effective Involvement of in¬
ternational private business in major
new ventures ¡n India. After the crea¬
tion of the programme, the FAO active¬
ly assisted the search for ways to
eliminate obstacles to new invest
ments in critical food or food-related
industries.
As the urgency of increased agri¬
cultural production grew, the climate
for investment in India in these indus¬
tries began to change for the better.
With the 50 per cent jump ¡n fertilizer
consumption in 1967 having contribut¬
ed substantially to the rapid recovery
from near-famine conditions, top prior¬
ity has been given to the development
of 15 major fertilizer factories.

national business. Almost all develop¬
ing countries have undertaken more
or less extensive agricultural training
programmes, which hold the key to the
introduction of new farming techniques
including the mechanization of farm
production. The South American Farm
Mechanization Training Centre at Buga,
Colombia, illustrates how such pro¬
grammes can be effectively developed
through co-operation among industry,
the FAO and governments.
With FAO's guidance through the
Freedom from Hunger Campaign, the
Colombian National Training Service
and a British farm machinery manufac¬
turer set up the centre to train tech¬
nicians from Colombia and other Latin
American countries as instructors in
farm machinery operation and repair
and as government extension officers.
With wide experience ¡n such train¬
ing programmes in the United King¬
dom, France, the Federal Republic of
Germany and each of the Scandina¬
vian countries, the British firm was
in a position to provide the necessary
instructional staff, as well as a broad
range of tractors, equipment for work¬
shops and teaching aid. The com¬
pany's donation to this project, which
will eventually amount to approximately
$300,000, represents a far-sighted
investment in South American agricul¬
ture development.

iNOTHER field of potential
industry-government co-operation in¬
volves one of the most widely discuss¬
ed developments in the world food in¬
dustry, a process developed by a
British petroleum company at its French
refinery for producing protein from
crude oil. The final product, a yellow¬
ish, odourless powder, is comparable
to fishmeal in composition. But, like
fishmeal, it is not yet suitable for direct
human consumption. It is, however,
suitable for feeding to animals and
poultry, which in turn convert it to the
traditional and still most acceptable
food forms meat, milk and eggs. (See
article page 21).
While some experts say that it will
be at least ten years before we will
see human food derived directly from
protein produced from petroleum or
from natural gas, several oil and chem¬
ical companies consider the potential
demand for the product great enough
to begin their own development pro¬
grammes. India has already started
producing proteins from petroleum
hydrocarbons with pilot plants under
the direction of the Indian Institute
of Petroleum at Dehradun and the
Regional Research Laboratory at
Jorhat.
A number of high protein concen¬
trates have also been developed from
various vegetable and fish sources.
Dr. Norman W. Pirie, head of the bio¬
chemistry department at Rothamsted
Experimental Station in England, has
developed one of the most recent a
process for extracting protein from
green leaves, such as pea cannery
waste.
A Swedish company is now produc¬
ing a fish protein concentrate which,
mixed with water and cocoa powder,
has been used recently in Nigeria and
B i afra.
At the American University of Beirut,
a new supplementary called Aubina
has been developed from wheat, Egyp¬
tian chick-pea, bone-ash and skim
milk, and tests have shown that child¬
ren find it good to eat.
Both soya and cotton-seed have long
been sources of protein concentrate.
But while the day may not be far off
when meat, bread and even bacon
made from these materials will be part
of man's normal diet, so far protein-
rich foods have received an extremely
cool reception.
While there is a certain compelling
logic in the argument that protein
concentrates are "good for you,"
there still remains the problem of how
the stuff tastes. And experience shows
that unless people are really at the
starvation level, they are particular
about the taste of the food they eat.
This was the sum and substance of
a number of scientific papers present¬
ed to the combined FAO/WHO/
UNICEF Protein Advisory Board last
September. According to Dr. O. Bai¬
larín, an executive of the Brazilian sub¬
sidiary of a Swiss food company, all
efforts by private enterprise in South
America to sell and promote high-pro¬
tein produce have met with disappoint¬
ing results, and in some cases failed
completely. In Peru, production of a
high-protein fish flour produced from
anchoveta was discontinued after sales
sank to a disastrous low. Similar diffi¬
culties have been met with in Africa.
Specialists give these reasons for
consumer resistance to something
that is obviously "good for them":
Traditions regarding food are
stronger in developing countries than
in developed ones. New foods, deliver¬
ed in a new form or a new package,
are looked upon with suspicion.
Most people ignore the meaning of
the word "protein," which has no
commercial appeal.
People shun high-protein products
for social reasons, regarding them as
"the food of the poor."
IN Ethiopia, some of these
obstacles were overcome by the nutri¬
tionists, who called their product Faffa
(meaning "grow big and strong" in the
local language). Faffa was a success.
But in many other countries, where
illiteracy ranges up to 85 per cent, and
people cannot even read the name of
the product, promotion campaigns have
to be carried out through films, radio
and television.
Nevertheless, specialists such as
Dr Husain Ali Bhimjee Parpia, Director
of the Central Food Technological Re¬
search Institute in Mysore, India, are
firmly convinced that protein malnutri¬
tion can be overcome in much of the
developing world if the available
resources of oil-seed protein are utiliz¬
ed more efficiently. As soon as
acceptable products can be perfected
and attractively presented through
regular commercial channels, vegetable
protein sources will certainly make a
major contribution to solving present
nutritional problems.
Weaning foods, biscuits, ice cream,
beverages and candies are the prep¬
arations which are now under consid¬
eration by major international food pro¬
cessors. Three American companies
are now apparently convinced they are
on the brink of a major breakthrough
in this field. One is planning to manu¬
facture and sell throughout Asia a
highly popular Hong Kong soybean
drink with a satisfactory amino acid
content. A major soft drinks bottling
firm has developed a chocolate-flav¬
oured, soybean-based high-protein
beverage, fortified with vitamins; this
potent concoction has already been
launched on the Brazilian market. In
El Salvador, a third company has just
completed consumer testing on a new
high-protein soft drink made from corn
meal, cottonseed and nut meal.
But if the development of synthetic
nutrients provides the basis for an
entire new sector of the food industry,
prospects for expansion in the exploita¬
tion of the world's marine resources is
undoubtedly more immediate. The sea
is, for the foreseeable future, an al¬
most limitless source of high-protein
content food. Annual production of
plants within the oceans, according to

Several years ago, certain communities in
the Republic of Chad were found to be
eating a blue alga called Spirulina (above

salts, and highly alkaline. After it is
harvested, women form it into pancakes
to dry in the sun (above), before taking
it to market. The ancient Aztecs consum¬
ed a similar alga which grew in Mexico's

68 per cent protein, that is, six times as
much as in wheat and three times as much
as in beef. French and Mexican research
laboratories, excited by its large-scale
nutritional possibilities, are experimenting
with its artificial cultivation. The culture is
produced by photosynthesis in vats of luke¬
warm salt water (left), which are fed with
carbonic gas. Results show that the annual
yield of Spirulina could be 40-45 tons per
hectare with a 25 ton protein content, as
compared to only 30-40 kilogrammes of
beef protein per hectare.

THE NEW FOOD REVOLUTION (Continued)
12
the FAO's Fish Stock Evaluation Branch
Chief, John Allan Gulland, is approxi¬
mately 130 thousand million tons
hardly any of which is used for human
consumption. And of the 23 thousand
million tons of fish and shellfish the
ocean grows per year, the present
world-wide catch is about 60 million
tons.
While much of the plant life the
phytoplankton is generally microscop¬
ic and neither easy to harvest nor
attractive to use, there are vast possib¬
ilities for expanding the fishing indus¬
try. At present the world catch of
fish, rising annually by from 6 to 8 per
cent is growing faster than the world's
population. World fisheries production
increased from 19 million metric tons
in 1948 to 60 million tons in 1967, or
at a rate much faster than food produc¬
tion from the land.
But present fishing methods are still
traditional and primitive. Production
might well be doubled in the next ten
years through the use of new electronic
equipment which detects the presence
of schools of fish, speeds the move¬
ment of nets, and even lures fish into
the nets.
While most of the world's fishing
grounds are being quite intensively
worked, the Indian Ocean one of
the world's least known oceans may
well be one of the richest and most
underdeveloped. Recent estimates
submitted to the FAO's Indian Ocean
Fishery Commission indicate that the
yearly catch of fish in the Indian Ocean
could be increased about ten times,
from its present level of 2 million to
20 million metric tons annually with¬
out damaging the stocks. In the more
immediate future, current production
could be raised to 10 million tons a
year, putting the ocean's fisheries on
a par with those of the North Atlantic,
which yield approximately 11 million
tons a year.
Still, if fishing remains confined to
the types of fish now exploited, experts
estimate that the world catch would
probably approach Its physical limit
within the useful working life of fish¬
ing vessels now being built. Alter¬
native sources of natural production
include both fish and other animals
more or less unfamiliar to most fish
consumers.
For instance, squid of various types
appear to be abundant in many parts
of the world, but exploiting the very
large quantities of this creature now
eaten readily only in Japan and Med¬
iterranean countries depends as
much on changing the tastes of the
consumer as on being able to catch
the animals economically.

YSTERS on a half shell,
steaming clams, broiled salmon steaks,
shrimp cocktail all these cherished
seafoods and many more may dwindle
unless we stop ourselves from des¬
troying their very birthright.
A common misconception contributes
to the rise of such a tragic spectre.
WESLEY MARX has written widely on the
Impact of technology on the environment,
particularly the ocean. He has participated
In several scientific expeditions and made
extensive field trips on both the Atlantic and
Pacific coasts of the U.S.A. to gather
material for this article. His book on ocean
conservation 'The Frail Ocean" (Coward-
McCann, New York) was published in 1967.
While the ocean regime may appear to
stop at the shore, its vital processes
extend into our bays, salt marshes,
rivers and even our mountain streams.
In a magnificent migration, silver-
toned salmon rise from cold ocean
depths, navigate to river mouths in
Europe, Scandinavia, Asia and the
Americas, swim Intently against river
currents, hurdle small waterfalls and
finally pause in green-shaded mountain
streams far from the blue ocean. Here
they were born and here they will
give birth, their tail fins scratching out
cribs in the gravel bottom. Many other
marine fish use rivers as nurseries:
shad, striped bass, alewlfe and the
ugly, caviar-bearing sturgeon. These
river-ascending fish are called anadro-
mous "upward-running".
An even greater spectrum of marine
life is nursed and reared in estuaries,
those places where the oceans and
rivers of the world collide to form bays,
salt marshes and fjords. Here, suc¬
coured on rich nutrients and shelter¬
ed from sharks and other marine pre¬
dators, young tarpon, snook, mullet,
menhaden, dab, plaice, flounder and
smelt prepare themselves to enter the
vast ocean.
Estuaries nurse West Africa's prin¬
cipal catch, the bonga, and India's
favourite fishes, the hilsa, bombay duck,
cock-up and pearl spot. Shellfish
clams, oysters, scallops, mussels and
Crustacea shrimps, lobsters, crabs
flourish in estuaries. In the Ur'ted
States, two-thirds of the marine catch
¡s estuary-dependent. Many fish which
keep to the sea are, in turn, dependent
on estuaries for providing forage fare.
Our rivers and our estuaries are thus
vital nurseries of marine life, the re¬
pository of the birthright of so many
fish and shellfish.
Much of the world's population lives
on or near coast-lines and we tend
to see estuaries and rivers in man-
made roles: harbours, navigation chan¬
nels, land reclamation projects, sewage
ponds, sand and gravel pits. This
narrow vision triggers a tragic collision
between human geography and natural
geography, as exemplified by one
beautiful, world renowned bay. San
Francisco Bay makes the city of San
Francisco one of the most charming
urban regions ¡n the world, part penin¬
sula and part ocean bay, part green
mountains and part blue plains. Here
the United Nations was created. The
bay traditionally serves as a vast mar-

NURSERIES OF THE SEA (Continued)
Let's not kill the fish that lay the golden eggs
¡ne nursery and a passageway for
salmon and other anadromous fish.
At one time, the Pacific coast's larg¬
est commercial fishing fleet docked
in the bay. Yet today no commercial
fishermen trawl their seine nets in
its sunlit shallows. The marine nur¬
sery is a ghost nursery. It exists
largely as a giant cesspool, a gar¬
bage dump and a real estate reservoir.
As a cesspool, it receives the dis¬
charges of over 80 sewage outfalls.
Daily, some 60 tons of greases and
oils cascade into the bay and paralyze
the nerves of striped bass. Acid
wastes burn salmon gills and disrupt
breathing. Papermill effluents disrupt
the normal division of eggs and fisher¬
men catch freakish flounder. These
wastes have transformed the life-giv¬
ing bay waters Into a toxic broth.
Ninety per cent of the bay is closed
to shellfish harvest. Keeping it clear
as a navigation channel means that
fish habitat is dredged up and oyster
beds interred under silt avalanches.
As a garbarge dump, marshes that
once nurtured eelgrass and other nu¬
trients now exude only hot, pungent
odours of decay. Tideland habitat
has been buried to accommodate
apartments, shopping centres, airport
runways and athletic stadiums. A third
of the bay some 257 square miles
has been reclaimed.
Te
14
HE bay that once provided
15 million pounds of oysters annually
no longer supports oyster production.
The bay that once provided 300,000
pounds of clams annually no longer
supports clam production. The bay that
once provided six and one-half million
pounds of shrimp annually now pro¬
duces only 10,000 pounds.
Such a tragic waste is repeated in
other famous estuary and river systems
throughout the world. Dr. Pieter Kor-
ringa, Director of the Netherlands
Institute for Fisheries Investigation
notes:
"The river Rhine, in season, used
to teem with salmon making their way
to their spawning grounds in Germany,
France and Switzerland. Old paintings
in art galleries reveal that salmon was
on the table of the poorest people in
the Netherlands. In the Netherlands
today, few people have even seen a
salmon which did not come out of
a tin, or was on display, smoked, in a
fishmonger's shop. The Rhine is now
called Europe's open sewer."
In the 1900s, fishermen on England's
River Tees harvested 8,000 pounds of
salmon yearly: by the 1920s, 3,000
pounds; now, virtually zero. A new
and deadly tributary empties into the
Tees: twelve million gallons of sewage
daily. Sewage-nourished "blooms" of
scum algae render some of Norway's
deep blue fjords opaque. These dense
greenish blooms, by exhausting oxygen
in the waters, suffocate marine life
and leave stinking windrows of dead
fish on the beach.
L.IKE sewage outfalls, river
dams can seriously impair the nurseries
of the sea. Soviet marine biologist
G.V. Nikolsky notes in his book
"Special Ichthyology" :
"The fishing industry and ichthyo¬
logy in general are faced with new,
vast problems through the construction
of huge hydroelectric plants. Dams
built across the southern rivers of
the U.S.S.R. are liable to obstruct and
prevent valuable anadromous commer¬
cial fish, primarily the sturgeon, from
reaching their spawning grounds."
The dams, by directing river water
into irrigation diversions, also serve to
lower the level of seas such as the
Caspian, further shrinking the habitat
of the famed sturgeon. Sewage out¬
falls threaten sturgeon as well. Soviet
author Mikhail Sholokhov recently re¬
ported that almost a million sturgeon
died on one polluted stretch of river.
Today, in a critical effort to sustain its
long-established caviar industry, the
Soviet Union loads sturgeon aboard
river boats to carry them safely through
slime that covers their migration
routes.
Unprotected, the nurseries of the
sea can degenerate Into nurseries of
death that threaten human beings as
well as fish. Eleven fishing villages
and the industrial city of Minamata
line the shores of Minamata Bay in
Japan. In 1950, a nerve disease began
affecting some residents. A once
bright teenage boy could no longer
button his clothes or hold his
chopsticks. A fisherman clawed his
hands, bared his teeth at doctors
and growled at his children. Between
1953 and 1963, some 105 similar cases
occurred, most ending fatally or with
severe disability.
Perplexed by "Minamata Disease,"
doctors tried to isolate living habits
common to victims. Most victims lived
in the fishing villages rather than the
city, and these victims subsisted on
the bay's abundant supply of shellfish.
While healthy in their own right, the
bay shellfish were found to contain
unusually high concentrations of mer¬
cury, a substance highly injurious to
human nerves.
Where did the mercury come from?
Investigators, including Professor Mak-
io Uchida of Japan and Dr. Leonard
Kurland of the United States, found
that a chemical plant was dumping
mercury wastes into the bay. The
wastes were diluted, but shellfish can
filter out and concentrate dilute sub¬
stances. "Ecological magnification," a
basis of survival in the dilute solution
of sea water, had thus been perverted
and the shellfish turned into living
vials of poison. "Minamata Disease,"
according to Professor Uchida, ceased
once the chemical plant stopped dump¬
ing mercury wastes into the bay and
consumption of bay shellfish was pro¬
hibited.
RRECENTLY New York City
experienced a sharp rise in cases of
hepatitis (inflammation of the liver).
Many victims remembered consuming
oysters. The source of the oysters was
traced to a nearby bay. Oysters in
this bay were found to have an oily
taste. The oyster meat was greenish
rather than white. Oil wastes in the
bay contributed to the oily seasoning.
Copper wastes contributed to the
greenish hue. These oysters, marin¬
ated and steeped in wastes, were
inflaming the livers of New Yorkers.
Today the bay oysters Me in quarantine
just like the shellfish of Minamata Bay.
The tragic degradation of the Rhine,
Minamata Bay and San Francisco Bay
dramatizes one stark fact. If we
continue to ignore the ocean's need for

NURSERIES OF THE SEA (Continued from page 14)
Leading the salmon by the tip of the nose
its landward nurseries, we will grad¬
ually doom our most valuable and
popular sea foods.
Not only will the livelihood of fisher¬
men, the diet of millions of people
and the favourite recipes of gourmets
be jeopardized. Nutrition experts see
in the food stocks of the ocean the
potential to satisfy the hunger of an
Increasingly congested planet. (See
article page 4.) National agencies
and International agencies like the
Food and Agriculture Organization are
attempting to cultivate this potential,
but these attempts will be seriously
jeopardized if we persist in sterilizing
the nurseries of the sea.
Efforts to reverse this trend are
intensifying but face great obstacles.
The banning of all man-made activities
on rivers and estuaries would certainly
serve to reverse such a trend. But
such a ban would be not only impos¬
sible but unnecessary. Estuaries and
rivers can act as both nurseries of the
sea and as an Industrial resource but
only in proper balance. To effect such
a balance, the stresses and tolerances
of marine life must be known and
evaluated.
IET man's study of the land
environment has traditionally (and
understandably) outstripped his study
of the marine environment, and his lag
impairs marine conservation. The dan¬
gerous plight of salmon and other ana¬
dromous fish has been known for some
time, but solutions have had to await
a better scientific acquaintance with
these fish. Only recently have investi¬
gators offered a substantial explan¬
ation of how spawning salmon find
the stream where the were born five
or six years earlier. Experiments by
Dr. Arthur Hasler at the University of
Wisconsin in the United States indicate
that salmon locate their parental
stream by sniffing out the stream's
particular odour.
The application of such knowledge
can prove as time-consuming and
rigorous as its discovery. Salmon
eggs were artificially hatched over
50 years ago. This capability was
heralded as the answer to salmon
conservation. Yet salmon hatcheries
have never been able to match
nature's former abundance.
In the final analysis, proper pro¬
tection of fish habitat determines sur¬
vival. Accordingly, on many rivers,
dams have been fitted with salmon
ladders, water quality standards im¬
posed on sewage outfalls, spawning
streams cleared of logging debris and
mine tailings, and screens placed on
irrigation canals that can divert young
salmon into fatal dead ends.
B OTH scope and cost of
such measures can rise quickly. The
Columbia River in the United States
has 21 salmon hatcheries, 22 fish
ladders and some 600 screened irrig¬
ation diversions. Some 1,700 miles
of stream bed have been cleared of
debris. To better conserve salmon
conservation funds as well as salmon,
Dr. Hasler is now considering the
possibility of diverting spawning sal¬
mon from polluted parental streams
to clean streams by duplicating stream
odours. Clean streams are being
created by draining wilderness areas
with concrete water channels and
coating these channels with gravel
suitable for salmon cribs. Through
such techniques, salmon and other
anadromous fish may be diverted to
habitat purposely maintained to per¬
petuate their abundance.
Maintaining the habitat of estuarlne
life is proving an even more demanding
task. Though seemingly a simple body
of water, an estuary is in reality a
biological engine driven by currents,
tides, wind and other mechanisms that
change from day to day. Left to its
own devices, this sophisticated engine
can sustain a natural productivity that
rivals the fertility of jungles and that
nurses millions of the ocean's young.
If disrupted, it falters as assuredly as
an automobile engine fed on salt water.
Circulatory currents serve to trap
nutrient matter in an estuary as food
for young fish. But these currents
cannot discriminate between nutrients
and toxic wastes, and research scien¬
tists now find that the waste receiving
capacity of estuaries is sharply cir¬
cumscribed by this factor. A sewage
outfall that discharges large amounts
of fresh water, or a dam that restricts
fresh water inflow can alter the critical
mixture of fresh and saline water that
estuarine inhabitants require. Thus
fresh water, or the lack of it, can
become a polluting influence.
We will never be able to conserve
the nurseries' of the sea until we can
understand such complex relationships,
understand them so well that we can
break them down in as much detail as
the components of a jet engine. The
United States is creating a hydraulic
model of the Chesapeake Bay, a
body of water nourished by 100 tribu¬
taries, the tides of the Atlantic and
numerous metropolitan sewage out¬
falls. The model will be used to predict
and balance the impact of sewage,
dredging projects and dams on the
Chesapeake biota. The aim of this
large-scale project is not only to
conserve Chesapeake Bay but to
advance the knowledge of estuarine
conservation in general.
Through extensive research, Investi¬
gator E. Foyns of Norway has evolved
technology to prevent sewage from
producing deadly slime in estuaries.
Sewage entering the Oslo Fjords is
exposed to electrolytic precipitation to
remove phosphorous, a slime-forming
catalyst.
IHE common global int¬
erest in conserving the nurseries of
the sea and preventing marine pollu¬
tion, is more and more being recogniz¬
ed. The FAO Advisory Committee on
Marine Resources Research (ACMRR)
has been questioning governments on
the fisheries aspect of marine pollution.
Working with ACMRR, the Intergovern¬
mental Océanographie Commission
(IOC) has set up a Working Group on
Marine Pollution, headed by Dr. Kor-
ringa of the Netherlands. This month,
specialists from Unesco, the Food and
Agriculture Organization, the Inter-
Governmental Maritime Consultative
Organization and the World Meteoro¬
logical Organization meet in London
to study problems of marine pollution.
Such efforts are aimed at estab¬
lishing a general scientific framework
for the conduct of research into marine *
contamination that will serve to avoid | /
duplication and expedite practical
control measures. In addition, indus-

FORMS OF
NATURE
"No artist could improve the beauty,
no craftsman match the perfection
of execution, of these structures that
grew in accordance with inherited
patterns going back to the beginnings
of time." Thus writes Andreas
Feininger in "The World Through My
Eyes" (Crown Publishers, New York),
where the famous American
photographer presents some of his
favourite pictures taken during the
past 30 years. Among these are
masterly close-ups from nature,
including the shells shown on these
pages. "The variety of forms of
nature Is unlimited, their number
infinite", he says. "These
photographs show different solutions
to the protective needs of certain
molluscs. Each shell evolved to
provide maximum protection in
accordance with the specific
environment and way of life of the
respective mollusc, the different
requirements being reflected in the
differences in design: corrugated,
ribbed, or spherical surface;
presence or absence of protective
spines; thinness or thickness of the
walls." Opposite, gasteropod;

trial nations which learn how to salvage
desecrated nurseries can show deve¬
loping nations how to avoid such dese¬
cration in the first place.
Comprehending the nature of the
nurseries of the sea will not alone
guarantee their survival. An obstacle
as formidable as would be a dam
without a fish passage remains. Tra¬
ditionally, estuaries and rivers have not
been administered as complete marine
systems but as subdivisions of political
systems on land.
Thus, some 90 bayfront communities
and a host of private and government
agencies have utilized San Francisco
Bay with little reference to each
other's needs or the health of the bay
itself. (The land reclamation project
of one community now threatens to
cut off a neighbouring community's
access to the bay). The equivalent
on dry land would be the use of a
farmer's wheat fields by his neigh¬
bours as a cesspool, a dump, a play¬
ground and a highway right-of-way, or
their requisition for use as a reservoir.
Effective conservation of the nurs¬
eries of the sea will require more
comprehensive systems of manage¬
ment. In the case of San Francisco
Bay, a pioneer marine commission has
been formed. Composed of Ipcal,
state and federal officials, the commis¬
sion is empowered to view the bay
as a single system and evolve a plan
that will balance development with
conservation. A major goal of the
commission is to restore the bay as
a prime marine nursery.

THER countries are in¬
creasingly realizing the importance of
marine nurseries and at the same time,
invoking penalities against exploiters
who ignore their true values. In
Sweden, sponsors of hydroelectric
dams must provide compensation for
any disruption of salmon runs. In
the Soviet Union, fish protection
agencies may bring suit against
industries or communities which
pollute fish habitat by dumping
excess wastes into the water. In
Japan, fishermen can claim heavily
from industrial construction enterprises
that usurp or damage marine nurseries.
In many places, protection of marine
nurseries requires international action.
The Fraser River flows through the
Canadian province of British Columbia
and empties Into Puget Sound, a Paci¬
fic coast estuary bordered by the
United States and Canada. By banding
together in an international commis¬
sion, these two countries have restored
the Fraser's great salmon runs, once
blocked by careless riverside construc¬
tion. An international commission has
now been formed to restore the Rhine
to its former biological wealth. In time,
fresh salmon may once more grace
the dinner tables of Western Europe.
IHE growing efforts to save
the nurseries of the. sea will demand
much in the way of research, tech¬
nology, money and political co-ordin¬
ation. But these nurseries will reward
such attention amply enough. In sup¬
porting a new programme to conserve
the United States' 106 anadromous
rivers, the director of the U.S. Bureau
of Commercial Fisheries declared: "In
looking at what I consider to be the
rather phenomenal success in the
Columbia River, I would say that we
could certainly justify this on the cost-
benefit ratio very well."
Yet there ¡s far greater justification,
indeed necessity, for such efforts. We
now realize that, if we deny the ocean
its nurseries, we deny ourselves a food
source regarded as crucial to human
survival. We also deny ourselves a
grand opportunity. Dr. Lionel Walford,
Director of the Sandy Hook Marine
Biology Laboratory ¡n the United States
observes: "While the estuary is the
one part of the sea that man can ruin,
it is also the part that he can control
in order to increase the production of
marine life."
Oyster and mussel cultivation pro¬
vide only a glimmer of the future bene¬
fits to be derived from ranching and
farming our estuaries. The nurseries of
the sea, with their present bounty and
great potential, demand our respect,
and our care. Leaving a heritage of
carp, gar, rat-tailed maggots and other
pollution-resistant fish to future gener¬
ations would be a grave folly indeed.
Our children will have little need of
oysters turned green and reeking of oil.

animals for his food and clothing,"
wrote the distinguished Russian
chemist Dimitri Mendeleyev, in 1875.
Subsequent achievements of science
have confirmed the validity of this bold
prediction by the scientist who
established the Periodic Table of
chemical elements. To a large extent,
synthetic fabrics have today replaced
natural textiles, and the next task for
science is to increase and change
man's food resources by creating
synthetic foods.

field of amino acid synthesis and theoretical
organic chemistry. He is head of the laboratory
for the synthesis of nutritional substances at
the Institute of Elementary Organic Com¬
pounds (U.S.S.R. Academy of Sciences).
So far, chemistry has made no
attempt to compete with agriculture.
Instead, ¡t plays an auxiliary role,
seeking to provide agriculture with
chemical fertilizers, pesticides, growth
agents and products designed to
preserve natural foodstuffs and Im¬
prove their taste, appearance and
digestibility. But basically, food
production today is in no way different
from what it was in the primitive
communities of hunters and farmers.
And yet the rolé which organic
chemistry could play in providing man
with a profusion and variety of foods
has long preoccupied many of the
world's leading scientists.
Dimitri Mendeleyev (1834-1907)
declared: "As a chemist I am con¬
vinced that we can obtain nutritive
substances by a direct combination of
elements contained in the air, water
and soil, not by the ordinary methods
of agriculture, but in special factories.
If the need for this has not yet been
felt, it is because unused land still
abounds everywhere . . . and I believe
that the day when the density of the
world's population reaches alarming
proportions, man will learn to use the
colossal mass of sea water around
him to provide abundant food, before
resorting to the manufacture of

SYNTHETIC CUISINE (Continued)
More nourishing and cheaper
synthetic food. In all probability, the
first factories will be for the cultivation
of primary organisms, similar to yeast,
by the use of water, air, minerals and
solar heat."
A similar idea was advanced by the
French scientist Marcelin Berthelot,
a 19th century pioneer of chemical
synthesis. "The day will come," he
said, "when everyone will take for
their meals a tablet of nitrogen, a small
amount of fat, a little starch or sugar,
and a bottle of aromatic flavouring,
mixed according to taste. All these
ingredients will be manufactured
cheaply and in unlimited quantities in
our factories. Food will thus be un¬
affected by good or bad seasons,
neither by rain nor drought, neither
by heat which withers plants nor
frost which destroys all hope of
their bearing fruit. Finally, all these
products will be free from the patho¬
genic microbes which cause epidemics
and threaten human life. When that
day comes, chemistry will have brought
about a revolutionary transformation
in the world, the effects of which no
one can foretell." ("Science et Mo¬
rale," 1897.)
IS it still too soon to tackle
the problem of creating synthetic foods?
Let us take a look at a basic factor
in the global equation of food and
people: the needs of the individual
human being in terms of nourishment?
Apart from water, man needs five
groups of basic elements proteins,
carbohydrates, fats, vitamins and
mineral salts. As dally nourishment,
an adult should have, on average, two
litres of water, 80-100 grammes of
protein, 400-500 grammes of carbo¬
hydrates and 80-100 grammes of fats.
As for vitamins (0.1 gr. a day, excluding
choline, of which 0.1 gr. is also
needed) and salts (20 gr. in all,
including 10 gr. of cooking salt), the
needs are small and can be easily met.
Synthetic foods must obviously
include all the indispensable salts
and vitamins which are already
being produced on a large scale
through chemical and microbiological
processes. And with the present
industrial manufacture of vitamins, it
is clear that man has already entered
the age of artificial, non-agricultural
production of nutritious substances.
The role of the other three groups
of elements is to provide the human
system with energy and "building
materials." The first function is largely
carried out by carbohydrates and fats
and the second by proteins. Here we
have a major distinction between
groups of nutritious substances.
The carbohydrates and fats which
provide energy are burned up during
assimilation and lose their original
chemical identity. Certain components
of these two groups are interchange¬
able and the groups themselves can
largely be replaced and transformed
one into the other, by the human
organism.
Proteins are completely different.
Turned Into amino acids by the
digestive system, they provide the
body with the "bricks" which it needs
to build its own proteins, of which
eight out of a total of 20 (9 in the case
of children) are indispensable. Food
should contain all these amino acids
in strictly controlled proportions.
Proteins are thus the most expensive
and deficient items in our human diet,
their most valuable and rarest elements
being the indispensable group of
amino acids.
Any pronounced protein deficiency,
particularly if it is due to the absence
in the diet of one or more indis¬
pensable amino acids, results in
specific vitamin deficiency diseases
such as kwashiorkor. Once restored,
the missing amino acid re-establishes
the balance and leads to a striking
increase in the nutritive value of many
proteins of vegetable origin.
It should be noted that the
synthesis of the protein component
of food bears no relation, contrary to
what one might expect, to the highly
complex problem of synthesis of
natural albumin. This is because the
alimentary proteins undergo complete
hydrolysis in the digestive system and
go into the blood in the form of amino
acids.
0 NE can readily see, then,
that the problem is reduced to either
the microbiological synthesis of protein
or the microbiological or chemical
synthesis of amino acids which can
then be used, in suitable doses, in the
composition of synthetic diets.
Such synthetic diets, consisting of
amino acids, vitamins, minerals, glu¬
cose and linoleic acid ether, have been
prepared by a U.S. scientist, Dr. Milton
Winitz and tested on human beings
over extended periods. They are used
especially in the intravenous feeding
of patients who, for one reason or
another, cannot be fed normally.
Here we have a true model of
synthetic nutriment. Apart from its
strictly medical application, its real
significance is in showing that it is
possible to be nourished by a proper
mixture of synthetic substances each
ingredient of which can be obtained
by synthesis.
Unfortunately the cost price of many

incorporated into food. Extensive trials made by adding it to animal
feed have been highly successful.

of them is still prohibitive which is
explained by their limited production.
Produced on a large scale and by
more efficient methods, their price
could easily be reduced, as has been
the case with methionine, lysine and
glutamic acid, the annual world
production of which now exceeds
100,000 tons at a price of only a
few dollars per kilogramme.
If all the other amino acids were
manufactured at the same price, the
daily needs per person would be met
for about 50 cents. There ¡s no
reason why the reduction in cost could
not be even greater the present
technique of producing amino acids,
which is based on the cheap substance,
nitromethane, seems very promising.
The Institute of Elementary Or¬
ganic Compounds of the U.S.S.R. Aca¬
demy of Sciences and the Pedagogical
Institute of Leningrad, among other
research institutes, have developed
the synthesis of all the amino acids
from this substance. No less en¬
couraging possibilities are offered by
the microbiological method, especially
if the micro-organisms which produce
amino acids can be switched from
carbohydrate foods to hydrocarbons.
A number of achievements ¡n this
direction have already been recorded.
A PART from agriculture,
another technique exists for the pro¬
duction of proteins on an industrial
scale : that provided by microbiology.
Scientists in a number of countries
(including France, U.K. and U.S.S.R.)
are already working on the production
of fodder yeasts for which the raw
material is provided by paraffins, one
of the cheapest by-products of petrol¬
eum. Hydrocarbon yeast is exception¬
ally rich in protein. It contains over
40 per cent compared with the
30 per cent protein content of soya
beans, the most nourishing of all
agricultural products.
The French scientist, Alfred Cham-
pagnat, director of a Marseilles
laboratory specializing in this research,
was first to draw attention to the
extraordinary possibilities of these
yeasts in making up for the present
protein deficiency: "The annual world
shortage of animal protein can be
estimated at three million tons. This
corresponds to 15 million tons of beef
cattle. For an annual production of
1,000 million tons of petroleum it can
be assumed that 700 million tons are
paraffin based. The production of
7 million tons of protein-vitamin
concentrate, equivalent to 3 million
tons of protein, would consume only
1 per cent of these 700 million tons
of petroleum."
Why is it that researchers are more

Proteins as everyone knows are fundamental to life. Every minute
in each of the hundred million million cells in the human body,
protein molecules perform thousands of complex reactions to keep
the cells alive and healthy. Scientists have closely studied
the structure of proteins and their building blocks, the amino acids,
which enable living organisms to synthesize proteins. This
model from the Paris science museum, the Palais de la Découverte,
shows the complicated chain-like molecular structure of a protein.

Only one of the dishes below is

interested in food for human consump¬
tion than in animal fodder? Here
again, figures provide an explanation.
Six million tons of synthetic protein
are required annually to meet the
needs of 250 million people; to
nourish the same number of people
with protein produced by stock farming
would require the production of from
50 to 100 million tons of dehydrated
protein to feed the animals themselves.
The problem facing chemists is the
following: is it possible to transform
a daily diet consisting of 100 grammes
of protein, 450 grammes of carbo¬
hydrates, and 100 grammes of fats
into food which, far from being less
good and less varied, is even better
and more varied than the usual fare?
In other words, the problem ¡s one of
taste, smell and consistency.
In their original state, practically all
natural proteins are odourless and
tasteless due to the fact that they are
macromolecular substances and con¬
sequently non-volatile and odourless.
The same applies to starchy macro-
molecular carbohydrates and to fats.
It is what is added to and mixed with
our food which gives it a special smell
and taste, and especially the sub¬
stances formed in the process of
cooking.
As we all know, the taste of any
substance can be broken down into
four main categories sweet, salty,
sour and bitter which we Identify
through the taste-buds on our tongue.
If we consider taste separately from
smell, it is clear that any taste can be
reproduced by a suitable addition of
say, sugar, salt, acid and caffeine.
However, the question of smell is
a much more delicate problem because
smell combines with taste to form
flavour, which is really what makes
food appetizing. In our everyday fare,
flavour is obtained by heating or the
addition of local spices (onion, garlic,
paprika, parsley, celery) or tropical
ones (pepper, ginger, cloves, etc.).
The action of these substances is
well known and corresponds to a
simple principle. The effect of heating
food is to form a mixture of substances
giving off an attractive odour formed
by dozens of volatile ingredients of
which only a few are responsible for
the specific smell. This aroma can be
reconstituted either by mixing the same
quantity of ingredients or by heating
certain amino acids and their mixtures
with different sugars.
We have found that the smell is
enhanced when an unsaturated fatty
acid is added to the mixture of amino
acids. The characteristic odour of
boiled beef or chicken casserole can
be obtained in this way. Adding a
trace of trlmethylamino oxide produces
the smell of salt water fish, and amino
valeric aldehyde imitates the smell of
boiled fresh water fish.
The final problem ¡s that of the
consistency of food. A variety of
methods now exist for making sophisti¬
cated imitations of standard human
foods from synthetic proteins. In the
United States, certain firms are selling
soya protein products which simulate
various parts of chickens and different
cuts of beef. Our Institute has
developed a technique for making
sturgeon caviar whose quality is
practically indistinguishable from the
real thing. In both cases, the methods
used are borrowed from other bran-

ches of physics and the chemistry of
macromolecular combinations. It can
thus be seen that any alimentary
protein can be turned into food which
has the consistency and flavour of
any animal protein.
Let us imagine the day when a
country's economy is based on the
manufacture of synthetic food instead
of on traditional methods of food
production. A few huge factories
sited in different parts of the country
where coal and petroleum are to be
found, prepare all the food required
by the population. Altogether, these
factories occupy barely a few hundred
square miles. Agriculture with its need
for a vast labour force and its limited
capacity for progress, has been
abolished, with the exception perhaps
of market gardens and horticulture.
There is no longer any need for the
vast industry which formerly provided
agriculture with its equipment tractors,
machines, tools. Nor for the metal
used in making them, nor for the fuel
used to power them. Nor for chemical
fertilizers, pesticides, etc. A large
proportion of the population previously
engaged in these industries and ¡n
agriculture itself is thus freed for more
productive work. Only a minute part
of this manpower is needed for the
production of synthetic food.
The old food industry gives way to
an entirely new industry, infinitely
more compact. No more bad years,
poor harvests, unproductive land. No
more calamitous losses due to climate,
natural, catastrophes, parasites, plant
diseases, all of which today still take
their toll of a considerable part of
every harvest.
All the conditions are to hand for
the transformation of villages into
towns and towns into garden cities.
Food products, ready to eat, packaged
or tinned like the products on sale
today, but with the fundamental
difference that they contain the normal
amount of vitamins and have the
highest nutritive value, have only to
be heated.
The appearance of these dishes
leaves nothing to be desired. With a
standard composition (proteins, carbo¬
hydrates, fats, salts, vitamins) adapted
to each age need, these foods are the
best source of health and energy
the human system can have, infinitely
better, at all events, than the best
natural products.
No more obesity, no more fatty
degeneration of the heart, liver and
other complaints of the kind. At the
least sign of physical abnormality,
special diets can be composed with
more or less of one or other ingredient.
Vast tracts of land previously
reserved for crop growing give way
progressively to forests and parks.
The silting and drying up of rivers is
stopped and the abundance of food
products leads to the solution of the
world shortage of drinking water which
at present is steadily worsening.
The society of the future gain's on
all fronts: economic, social and also
moral, as the slaughter of animals, a
cruel vestige of the past, is pro¬
gressively done away with.
Naturally, this is only a brief
glimpse of stimulating problems for
which solutions will need to be
found by the joint efforts of chemists,
biologists, doctors and economists.
Whatever success, even partial, is
achieved in this direction, those efforts
will be repaid a hundredfold.

How will radio communication be
established between the hidden
face of the moon and the earth?
How will research stations
established on the moon
communicate with each other?
T.

GEORGES PHELIZON Is director of long-term
planning of the new applications of electro¬
nics at the Central Telecommunications Lab¬
oratory in Paris. From 7965 to 1968, he direct¬
ed the development and construction of the
European scientific satellite, ESRO I, launch¬
ed into orbit on October 3, 1968, for the
European Space Research Organization.
Mr. Phelizon made a special study of the
problem of communication on the moon for
the conference of the International Academy
of Astronautics, In New York in October 1968.
HE recent success of
Apollo 8, which circled the moon with
three U.S. astronauts on board, was
largely due to the power and quality of
the remarkable telecommunications
system planned and built by the U.S.
civilian space agency, NASA.
The most spectacular feature of the
service provided by the system was
undoubtedly the direct transmission to
the world's television networks of live
shots showing life in the astronauts'
cabin, the low altitude flight across the
face of the moon, and the earth as
seen from its natural satellite.
All this seems little short of miracu¬
lous when it is realized that the trans¬
mitter on board the spacecraft was no
more powerful than that of a radio-taxi-;
at under 20 watts, it consumed hardly
more power than an ordinary electric
razor.
Just as the reflector in a car head¬
lamp beams the light forward, the

reflector of Apollo's transmitting aerial
beamed the radiated energy to the
earth, and thus magnified its intensity
about 500-fold.
But the moon ¡s a long way off
(240,000 miles, or nearly 10 times the
earth's circumference) and over that
distance radio waves are dispersed; so
that they are so weak at the receiving
end that they cannot be captured with
an ordinary aerial.
With the aid of a parabolic dish
85 feet in diameter at the NASA
station, at Goldstone, California
their intensity was multiplied about
100,000 times. This dish is mounted
on a swivelling base, and can be
aimed with great accuracy. Two iden¬
tical ground stations were set up at
Madrid in Spain and at Canberra in
Australia.
Because of the rotation of the earth,
the moon appears to be revolving
around every point of our planet, and
the geographical location of the listen¬
ing posts was therefore chosen to
ensure that at all times at least one of
these posts would be able to pick up

the signals. The three stations were
linked by a high-reliability network to
the Mission Control Centre at Houston,
Texas, which was thus in constant
touch with the spacecraft as it moved
across the moon.
Apart from the transmission of TV
images and cross-talk between the
astronauts and the flight controllers
at the Houston mission direction
centre, the telecommunications system
played a vital part in ensuring the safe
and successful accomplishment of the
mission by keeping track of the space¬
craft's position and speed with a high
degree of accuracy.
The data it provided was fed to a
battery of computers which, by compar¬
ing the spaceship's actual flight path
with the flight plan, could immediately
signal any correction needed to keep
Apollo 8 on correct course. And
indeed, one aspect of the success of
this intricate earth-moon mission, i.e.,
the precision with which the whole
operation was executed, is a triumph of
the computer; credit is due to the
scientists and technicians who built
and programmed the computer units.
Thus, with the vital part played by
radiocommunications in a reconnais¬
sance mission such as that of Apollo 8
in mind, let us now look a few years
ahead when man has established him¬
self on the moon.
The short trips of 1969-1970 have
been succeeded by longer and more
sophisticated scientific expeditions.
Lunar tourism, of course, is still a thing
of the future.
The lunar environment is hostile to
man; there is no atmosphere, and man
can move about only ¡f garbed in a
space-suit. During the lunar day, which
lasts a fortnight, the temperature rises
to something like 150° C; by night it
falls to about minus 150° C. From the
moon, the "full earth" appears four
times as large as the "full moon" fami¬
liar to us all.
L UNAR bases will probably
be built in greater part underground,
partly to offset the changes in tempera¬
ture and partly to give protection
against radiation or falling meteorites.
Exploring parties of scientists will
travel about in curious, highly func¬
tional vehicles.
For adequate scientific coverage, a
number of bases will be needed on
both the visible and the hidden sides
of the moon.
Here again, the role of telecommuni¬
cations in linking up the various bases
and exploring parties as well as in
connecting these lunar outposts with
stations on earth will be of vital import¬
ance.

fortunately are rather different from

COMMUNICATION ON THE MOON (Continued)
The moon's fickle gravitational field
those we are used to; while it is easy
on earth to arrange for a caller in Paris
or New York to talk by short wave
radio-telephone to a passenger on a
liner crossing the Atlantic, the same
equipment would have a range of only
a few score miles on the moon.
The chief reason is the absence of
atmosphere on the moon; the earth's
atmosphere plays an important part in
using radio waves for communication
purposes; the lower density of the air
at higher altitudes acts somewhat like
a prism, curving radio waves back to
earth, and extending their range
beyond the horizon. (There may well
be planets where the atmospheric
pressure is much higher than on the
earth, in which case the prism effect
would be so marked that radio or light
waves would go right round the globe;
this seems to be the case for Venus,
in particular.)
However, the most important factor
for long distance communication on the
earth ¡s undoubtedly ionospheric
reflection; under constant bombard¬
ment by various particles and radia¬
tions (especially ultra violet rays)
emanating from the sun, gas atoms in
the upper atmosphere are robbed of
some of their electrons.
When released, the electrons form
conductive layers known as the iono¬
spheric layers. These were deduced
as early as 1910 and experimentally
confirmed in 1925; they reflect back
towards the earth the radio waves
which would otherwise escape.
Fortunately for space communi¬
cations, the ionospheric barrier is not
insuperable, and chiefly affects wave¬
lengths of roughly over six metres,
that is, frequencies under 50 mega¬
hertz per second.
It can thus be understood why the

sible to reach a liner in mid Atlantic

This diagram shows how two communication satellites, S-1 and S-2, could enable stations on the hidden
face of the moon to communicate with the earth, and provide a radio link between research stations
anywhere on the moon. These relay satellites could be established at certain points where the earth and
moon cancel out each other's gravitational attraction (known as libration points), requiring only minimum
corrections from time to time to keep them in position. The relay satellites would be placed in orbit
at about 60,000 kilometres from the moon. At L-1, the lunar attraction LA combined with the centrifugal
force of the satellite CF would balance the terrestial attraction TA. At L-2, the lunar attraction LA and
the terrestial attraction TA offset the centrifugal force CF and would maintain the satellite in position.

would be useless on the moon, where
there is neither atmosphere nor iono¬
sphere, so that all radio waves on the
moon would escape freely into space.
This is precisely one of the reasons
why scientists are interested in install¬
ing radio-astronomy laboratories on the
moon, as the "radio sky" would be
clear for all frequency ranges.
Does this mean that lunar explorers,
will be completely cut off from the
earth ? The answer, fortunately, is no,
since communications satellites provide
a solution. Waves reflected by the
Scientific expeditions travelling across the
moon's surface will need specially-designed
vehicles. Conventional lubrication would be
useless since oil evaporates in. the prevailing
vacuum. Rubber tyres would crack or fry in
temperature extremes. Above all, mobile
machines will have to negotiate difficult terrain.

ionosphere cannot ensure the regular
transmission of high quality TV images
whereas satellites can do so even for
intercontinental programmes.
It will thus suffice to put a number of
satellites in orbit round the moon to
link up the scattered bases; but here
again, conditions are not the same as
on earth. The first TV relay satellites,
placed in terrestrial orbit a few thous¬
and miles up, girdled the earth in a
few hours; they could therefore
connect only two stations at certain
times and for very short periods. It
was then decided to "increase the
height of the orbit and with it the orbit¬
al period, i.e. the time taken to make
one complete revolution.
The Molnlya satellites developed by
the Soviet Union, for example, follow a
pronounced elliptical orbit thus consid¬
erably extending the time available
for transmissions, which in the case of
a link via satellite between Paris and
Moscow can be maintained for up to
six hours.

COMMUNICATION ON THE MOON (Continued)
Sail-powered satellites operating on solar radiation
period will be 24 hours; such a satel¬
lite, launched on an east-bound equa¬
torial orbit, will take just as long to go
round the earth as the earth takes to
spin on its axis: it will thus appear
stationary. This is the case for "Early
Bird" stationed above the Atlantic at
27 degrees West. A stationary satellite
will thus permit permanent connexions
to be established, and it is very tempt¬
ing to transpose this solution to the
moon.
But, as everyone knows, the moon
takes 28 days, not 24 hours, to rotate
on its axis, which is why it always
turns the same face towards us, the
other side remaining invisible from the
earth; for a satellite to revolve round
the moon ¡n 28 days, it would theoreti¬
cally have to be placed in orbit nearly
62,500 miles up. In actual fact, this
would be possible only ¡f the moon
were isolated in space, as the attrac¬
tion of the earth completely alters the
situation. A satellite placed in such an
orbit would rapidly escape from the
moon's gravitational field.

I NE possibility would be to
place our lunar communications satel¬
lite near enough to the moon for its
attraction to exert a greater pull than
the earth's; a suitable height would be
something over 3,000 miles, giving the
satellite a revolution of about 12 hours.
The satellites would then revolve much
faster than the lunar stations, and for
quasi-permanent liaison, a dozen satel¬
lites would be needed.
Another conceivable solution which
has great appeal, as it leads back to
almost stationary satellites, utilizes a
relatively simple phenomenon of celes¬
tial mechanics known as libratlon
points. If a body is close to earth it
feels the gravitational pull of our planet
(this is what we call weight). If the
same body finds itself in the proximity
of the moon, ¡t is similarly attracted by
the force of the moon.
It is not difficult to imagine, there¬
fore, that there is some intermediary
point where the force of. attraction of
the earth and the moon are equal in
both directions, and therefore cancel
each other out. In determining this
point, actual calculations made also
take into account an additional factor:
centrifugal force which tends to pull an
object away from the earth, since the
body together with the moon rotates
around the earth in 28 days.
Diagram on page 29 shows the first
libration point L-1, at about 34,000
miles from the moon in the direction
of the earth. It also shows a second
point L-2, off the hidden side of the
moon, where the centrifugal force
counteracts the combined attraction of
the moon and the earth. If a satellite
S-2 is placed at L-2, it will thus be
able to serve nearly all the bases
established on the hidden face of the
moon, but will not allow communication
with the earth which ¡s not visible
from this point, since it is hidden by
the moon.
Man's creative genius has overcome
this difficulty: satellite S-2 will not be
placed exactly at L-2; it will be shifted
a few thousands miles sideways, so as
to be in sight of the earth; and even
perhaps of L-1, where a second
satellite S-1 will relay communications
to the stations on the visible face of
the moon.
For both S-1 and S-2 to remain sta¬
tioned near the selected positions will
require the use of an extremely low-
powered position-correcting device

(less than 1 milligramme force per kilo¬
gramme of satellite).
Such a low thrust can be produced
by ion engines, but another possibility
is to stabilize the satellites with sails.
In "The Planet of the Apes," by
Pierre Boulle, the two chief characters
roam across interplanetary space, pro¬
pelled by the pressure of the sun's
rays on the sails of their spacecraft.
Some American scientists have seri¬
ously considered equipping satellites
placed near the libration points with
sails which would maintain them in
position thanks to the pressure of solar
radiation.
The satellites would in fact describe
a small individual orbit around the
libration points to allow for the changes
in the moon's and earth's position in
relation to the sun in the course of the
year. Calculations have shown that a
sail area of one-third of a square metre
per kilogramme of satellite would be
sufficient to produce the force needed.
To install on and around the moon
all the components of the communic¬
ations networks briefly described here
will demand many years, but this does
not mean that the first scientific
missions will be deprived of the means
of communication. The powerful

communications system installed on the
earth to keep in touch with spacecraft
could provide similar services to moon
stations on the visible face of the
moon, and could also be used even
to interconnect them. In that case,
since the velocity of radio waves is
187,500 miles per second, a lapse of
about five seconds between question
and answer would have to be allowed
for in telephone conversations between
two points on the moon via the earth.
Of course, other means of commun¬
ication used on earth before the
satellite era began could also be used
on the moon. But it appears unlikely
that they will be used to link points
more than a few dozen kilometres
apart.
T,HE most simple idea would
be to lay a telephone cable on the
lunar surface, but the operation would
be far from easy.
Another possibility would be to use
pylons brought from earth, or the
mountains of the moon to install radio
relays similar to those first used around
1950 as boosters for long distance TV
transmissions through microwave radio
links. But as the moon's radius is
only a fourth that of the earth, the
transmission range would be only half
that on earth, and a larger number
of relays would be needed. Each relay
would also have to contain its own
long-duration unattended electric power
supply. This of course will be rather
difficult in the lunar environment.
Finally, we must not forget that every
piece of equipment used on the moon
will have to come "from the sky." As
the moon has no atmosphere, the only
way to slow down a lunar-bound
spaceship is to brake it by firing a
rocket engine. So it may be more
economical to use equipment placed in
lunar orbit rather than land it on the
moon. Another consideration is that
climatic conditions in lunar orbit may
well be far more temperate than those
on the moon's surface.
Both these factors point to satellites
as the best solution, and in our opinion
the full scale use of lunar bases, parti¬
cularly on the hidden side of the moon,
will not be feasible until such time as
communication satellites have been set
up in the vicinity of the moon.

THE NEW FOOD REVOLUTION (Continued from page 12)
decade in the conversion of fish into
seafoods for indirect or direct human
consumption have been little short of
spectacular. Large quantities of fish
are now converted into meal, which is
in turn indirectly consumed in the
convenient protein form of meat, eggs
and chicken.
Fish protein concentrate (FPC), a
high protein powder made from other¬
wise inedible fish, is also highly
suitable for direct consumption by
people. FPC is dry, can be stored
indefinitely and transported convenient¬
ly without wastage. Both tasteless and
odourless it is suitable as an additive
to other foods such as breakfast
cereals. Added to animal foods, it
will lower the production cost of
meats, poultry and eggs by shortening
the growing period and improving their
quality.
I
32
«VEN more important inves¬
tigations are currently being made in
the U.S.S.R. and Japan into the possibi¬
lities of exploiting the vast quantities
of Antarctic krill, Euhausia superba.
This small shrimp, about five centi¬
metres long, is the main food of the
balloon whale. Rough calculations,
based partly on estimates of the
quantities that must have been eaten
by whales before whaling drastically
reduced their number, suggest that the
annual yield of krill could be at least
50 million tons or about the equi¬
valent of the entire world fish catch at
present.
Soviet experiments show that catch¬
ing the krill in quantities may be quite
easy and that an acceptable form of
meal for animal feeding can be produc¬
ed. A more interesting prospect is
that, if the technical problems of separ¬
ating the meat from the shell can be
resolved, krill may be used for direct
human consumption. Properly present¬
ed, in the form of imitation lobster
tails, for example, it would appeal to
the rapidly growing number of con¬
sumers of the much similar prawns,
shrimps and other crustaceans.
Much has been made these days of
advancing fishing from the primitive
stage of hunting to the stage of agri¬
culture. All the many forms of farming
pastoral, ranching, intensified gar¬
dening and factory farming have their
marine equivalents. Oysters, mussels
and shrimp have long been raised
in shoreline ocean beds and on ropes
suspended from special rafts, just as
the Japanese systematically have for
centuries raised and harvested large
quantities of nori (a highly nutritious
edible seaweed) in their bays and
inlets. And recently in Britain there
has been an increasing interest in
intensive marine farming of battery
plaice and sole.
The importance of sea farming is
primarily that fish can be raised with
relatively cheap food. Unlike chicken,
which can have no more than about
5 per cent of fish meal without tast¬
ing of fish, the diet of plaice or sole
can presumably contain much more
fish meal or other products includ¬
ing perhaps meal from krill.
Last autumn, a subsidiary of an
Anglo-Dutch food-detergents manufac¬
turer, put the first crop from its fish
farm at Loch Ailort in the western
Scottish Highlands on the U.K. market.
In its initial stage of fish-raising, the
firm is now concentrating on raising
rainbow trout but with a difference.
Trout farming in fresh water is a well-
established industry in many countries.
But Loch Ailort trout are raised in sea
water and the largest a little over
two years old tip the scales at 5.5 lbs.
each. Not only do the salt water trout
get bigger faster, but due to the careful
regulation of their diet, the trout have
delicate pink flesh resembling salmon.
Understandably, these pioneer ef¬
forts in fish farming have been concen¬
trated on the highest priced varieties,
but with a fish farm of eight square
miles able to produce more fish than
are presently caught in the entire North
Sea, the business could soon take on
massive proportions including a wide
variety of popularly priced seafoods.
This emergent aquicultural revolution
has its parallel in British agriculture,
and Britain's "convenience" food
industry has played a major role in
both. The experimental and develop¬
mental fish farming was a logical out¬
growth of the heavy investment in the
British frozen foods industry.
To meet the tight standard specifi¬
cations, the introduction of new varie¬
tal strains and improved growing tech¬
niques have also produced substantial
yield increases in all crops grown
under contract for the convenience
food industry. Pea yields, for exam¬
ple, have risen by more than 40 per
cent while other crops such as spin¬
ach and broad beans have increased
even more.
Forward planning of the industry,
with its ability to forecast sales and
plan production tonnages, has brought
a measure of stability to vegetable
growing never before known. Like¬
wise, as a result of the development
of convenience foods, average output
of poultry in Britain more than doubled
during the past ten years.
But a comparison of per capita
British consumption of frozen foods in
1967 (11.4 lbs.) with consumption in
the U.S. (68.0 lbs.) indicates that the
convenience food revolution in the
U.K. has just really got underway. And
the same conclusions can be drawn
for Sweden (22.7 lbs.), Switzerland
(15.4 lbs.), and Denmark (11.4 lbs.).
In all other European countries and
the lesser-developed countries ¡t has
hardly begun. What is true for frozen
foods, largely holds for the entire
range of convenience foods and the
catering industry.
Consider further that the U.S. is
on the threshold of still another stage
in the revolutionary development of
the convenience food industry. What
are considered convenience foods now
will be dwarfed by what will be accept¬
ed as convenience foods only a decade
from now.
In spite of the critical dimensions of
the world food situation at present,
food production is already the world's
greatest success story. Most develop¬
ed countries have solved their basic
problems with the possible exception
of the problem of mounting surpluses.
IHIS great achievement of
the past two decades can be attributed
to reliance, not on grandiose theories,
but on treating food production as a
business from the farm, to the pro¬
cessing stage and distribution all
requiring respected skills and capital
inputs which are essential to ultimate
success.
FAO Director-General Addeke H.
Boerma recently said that he saw no
intrinsic reason why yields in most
developing countries should not grow
at the same rate as those in the
advanced and largely temperate areas.
Nature has been "reasonably impar¬
tial" in distributing her riches, both
natural and human. We have the
knowledge of technology, and, hope¬
fully, the understanding of human na¬
ture necessary to assure that the world
will in the future be well fed. Through
the close co-operation of governments
and private business, of all nations,
the last three decades of the twentieth
century can go down in history as
the age of the revolution that achieved
this monumental feat.

organize an international conference in 1972
on man's pollution of the world. Sweden

Rabies menace
Rabies caused 637 deaths in 92 countries
in 1967, 62 less than in 1966. But these
WHO figures represent only one-fifth to
one-tenth of the actual deaths caused

rabies on the,ir territory, and 560,000 people
have received anti-rabies vaccinations.
Foxes, dogs, bats and skunks are major
carriers of the disease.

the grammatical rules of English and Japan¬
ese, and a voice-producing mechanism
with 550 vocal factors. When a question
in English printed on tape is fed into the
computer, its mechanical voice can either
translate the question, or give the answer
in Japanese.

Letters to the Editor
LIFETIME OF PUNISHMENT
Sir,
In your issue on Human Rights
(November 1968), you published the
picture of a slave wearing a kind of
muzzle over his mouth. In my opinion
the poor man was made to wear the
device not as a punishment, but to
prevent him from eating soil.
In many countries slaves were al¬
ways hungry and many tried to fill
their stomachs with soil; in the long
run this caused their death.
Their whole life was a punishment.

Amsterdam, Netherlands
REGRETTABLE OMISSION
Sir,
From its title, "Human Rights", I
expected the "Unesco Courier" for
November 1968 would prove to be an
outstanding number. On reading it,
I was greatly upset by an omission
which to my mind is both incompre¬
hensible and inexcusable.
The passages you published from
"The Right to be a Man" quoted the
words of Gandhi, Marx, Mohammed
and the Talmud, among other sources,
but not a single word of Jesus Christ,
who sacrificed his life for the salva¬
tion of mankind.
This omission is indeed regrettable
in a magazine of such broad scope
and readership.

1968 issue, page 49 Editor.
FREDERIC JOLIOT-CURIE
AND THE ATOM
34
Sir,
I was interested to read your issue,
"Peaceful Uses of the Atom" (July-
August 1968) which summarizes pre¬
sent achievements in this field and
outlines prospects for the future. But
I was sorry to find no mention of
Frederic Joliot-Curie.
This great French scientist spoke
out against any use of the atom other
than for peaceful purposes. As early
as 1949 he declared: "If in the future
I want to be able to engage in re¬
search, and if I want young people
to be able to devote themselves to
research without misgivings and under
the best conditions, it will be ne¬
cessary to build a society which rec¬
ognizes the true role of science, a
society in which war will not only be
impossible, but unthinkable. This res¬
ponsibility I cannot delegate to others
and, in the final analysis, it is science
itself that I am defending."
The article by I. H. Usmani (Charting
the Nuclear Labyrinth) retraces the
history of research on artificially creat¬
ed radioactivity, but omits any refer¬
ence to the work of Irène and Frédé¬
ric Joliot-Curie in 1934, which earned
them the Nobel Prize the following
year.
The author mentions the research of
the German scientists, Otto Hahn and
Fritz Strassmann, who discovered that
when slow neutrons hit uranium 235,
the nucleus splits in two, releasing
energy. The research of Hahn and
Strassmann, in fact, began where that
of P. Sairtch and Irène Joliot-Curie left
off. Moreover, reservations were
expressed on the results of their
experiments. It was Joliot-Curie who
immediately formulated the fundamen¬
tal theories on fission, who invented
the apparatus which demonstrated
the reality of the phenomenon and
who photographed the trajectory of
a particle produced by fission. The
way to the use of atomic energy
was finally opened by Joliot-Curie's
research with Halban and Kowarski
in 1939.
In my view, failure to give these
facts shows a lack of objectivity. It
is to be regretted that Joliot-Curie was
ostracized in his own country for
declaring that his work on the atom
would be devoted solely to peaceful
research, and a similar ostracism
should not be shown by a magazine
which, according to its own definition,
is "a window open on the world,"
and which, in its July-August 1968
number, merely restated the general
principles formulated by this distin¬
guished and deeply humanistic scien¬
tist.

THE FORCE OF PUBLIC OPINION
Sir,
Unesco strives unremittingly to ac¬
complish its great mission, so that
everyone may enjoy the right to edu¬
cation, so that all men, transcending
frontiers and continents, may learn to
understand and respect one another,
so that the vestiges of the past may
be preserved to enrich a world
cultural heritage.
The "Unesco Courier's" task and
major responsibility is to make those
efforts known as widely as possible
and to promote international under¬
standing. To this end, it is better for
the magazine to eschew political
problems and to open its columns to
authors from every country, express¬
ing every view-point.
When basic human rights are vio¬
lated, however, the "Unesco Courier"
does not remain silent. In its March
1967 number, it took a positive stand
against the policy of Apartheid in
South Africa. In "30 Questions on
Human Rights" (January 1968) it stat¬
ed: "The main instrument at the dis¬
posal of the international community...
is exposure to world public opinion."
And in the same issue, Sean MacBride
wrote, in "The New Frontiers of Inter¬
national Law," "No dictator or authori¬
tarian regime can now remain immune
from the impact of world public
opinion."
This applies not only to racial discri¬
mination but to every other violation
of human rights.
All free men and women are still
shocked by recent events in eastern
Europe. A small country which set
out courageously to chart its own
course was occupied by foreign
troops; a government vested with the
confidence of an entire people a rare
phenomenon indeed is no longer able
to take its decisions freely. How can
we reconcile these events with the
image of the Soviet Union presented
in your November 1967 number,
"U.S.S.R. Today?"
Little courage is needed to protest
against the racial policy of South Afri¬
ca. It is isolated and shunned by other
nations. It takes far more courage to
condemn the intervention in Czecho¬
slovakia. I know that a number of
agreements and conventions can be
quoted to justify the legality of this
intervention. But, legal points apart,
the fact remains that the occupation of
Czechoslovakia, viewed objectively, is
a blow against human rights.
This occupation is not an internal
matter for the socialist countries. If
such were the case, then the policy
of Apartheid could equally well be
considered as an affair that concerned
South Africa alone. The occupation
of Czechoslovakia is a very different
question, an event that vitally concerns
all who are resolved to preserve the
rights and liberties they hold dear.
I would ask you to add your support
to public opinion. Condemn without
reserve the occupation of Czecho¬
slovakia, so that when we look back
on International Year for Human Rights,
1968, we may do so without a sense
of shame.

IN THE EPIC TRADITION
Sir,
Congratulations on the issue, devot¬
ed to the "Two Great Epics of Asia,
Ramayana and Mahabharata," (Decem¬
ber 1967). I have just re-read your
brilliant and unusual account of these
two great Eastern epics. I personally
am a lover of the, epic tradition in
literature. The study of literature must
begin from sources which are close to
a people, a nation, a civilization.
Would that more such studies were
carried out for the, benefit of all people
proud of an undying and rich culture
and tradition. Would a similar treat¬
ment of the Greek epics Iliad and
Odyssey be possible in your maga¬
zine?
