Taken from a 13th century Arab manuscript, the "Makamat", this miniature portrays the
deep respect in which the book is held in the Arab world. By the 10th century, Baghdad,
the capital of Iraq, boasted two academies and some hundred libraries. The "Makamat"
was a collection of tales in alternating prose and verse by al Hariri (1054-1122) one of the
great masters of Arab literature. It was copied and illustrated at the beginning of the 13th
century by the calligrapher and artist al-Wasiti, the earliest Arab painter whose name has
come down to us. The illustration, depicting two Arab students, is taken from the book
"Education" in the series "Man through his art", published under the sponsorship of the World
Confederation of Organizations of the Teaching Profession with thef inancial support of Unesco.

"Books for all" is the slogan of Inter¬
national Book Year 1972, proclaimed
by Unesco. As Unesco's Director-
General states in his message publish¬
ed on the following page, the develop¬
ing countries at present produce no
more than one-fifth of the books
published in the world, and are ex¬
periencing a veritable "book famine".
Even in countries where publishing
thrives, the book has not yet become
an integral part of everyone's life.
Unesco's campaign for the promotion
of books will focus world attention on
the problems of book production and
distribution and on the role of books
and reading in furthering individual
fulfilment and social progress. This
issue is the first that the Unesco
Courier will devote in 1972 to Inter¬
national Book Year.

A
International
Book Year
by René Maheu
Director-General
of Unesco
S we embark on
the year 1972 which has
been unanimously proclaim¬
ed International Book
Year by Unesco's General
Conference, I invite all the
countries of the world to
join in this great venture,
each according to its resour¬
ces and needs, and to adopt
the Year's slogan "Books
for All".
For thousands of years
the written word and for
centuries the printed word
have played a vital role
in the preservation and
transmission of knowledge.
They have been man's most
effective ally in fashioning
his thought and in his con¬
quest of freedom. Even if
certain cultures have been
founded on communication
by word and gesture these
cultures can no longer hope
to survive or indeed develop
in the modern world with¬
out recourse to the written
word.
The book is the most
dependable and the most
convenient instrument of
communication ever devi¬
sed by man. With the book
the human mind for the first
time was able to conquer
time and then space. In the
past quarter of a century we
have witnessed the devel¬
opment of the book as one
of the means of mass com¬
munication and we must not
fail to recognize the role
and place of the book in the
service of the new spirit of
community that the mass
media have made possible.
There exists in the world
today a tremendous need
for reading. So great is this
need that for large portions
of the world's population

one can speak of a verit¬
able "book famine". Yet
while the technical revolu¬
tion that has taken place in
the production and distribu¬
tion of books has made it
possible to place on the
market an ever-increasing
number of relatively inex¬
pensive, good quality books,
the developing countries
are suffering from a scarc¬
ity of books that is becom¬
ing more acute as educa¬
tional opportunities grow.
The developing countries
at present produce no more
than one-fifth of the total
number of books published
in the world so they must
rely on book imports from
abroad to help meet at least
part of their needs. In the
long run their full require¬
ments can only be met by
setting up their own national
publishing industries.
Unesco's world program¬
me for the promotion of
books aims specifically to
redress this serious imba¬
lance between the develop¬
ed and the developing
countries. But the problem
is not only one of quantity.
It is equally or more im¬
portant that the book the
unparalleled instrument for
setting down man's wisdom
and knowledge promote
individual fulfilment and so¬
cial progress; that it give all
persons a chance to appre¬
ciate the best that the
human mind has to offer the
world over; and that it serve
to create a better under
standing between peoples
as a necessary step toward
a true and lasting peace.
Even in countries with a
thriving publishing industry,
the book has by no means
as yet become an integral
part of everyone's life.
These countries have no
problem of getting the book
to the reader, thanks to their
extensive distribution sys¬
tems and outlets. More
often than not, the real prob¬
lem for many of them now
(though it varies considera¬
bly from country to country)
is how to get the reader to
the book. This is borne out
by the high percentage of
non-readers revealed by re¬
cent surveys.
Has the time not come for
a full re-appraisal of the
problems of publishing so
that electronic and audiovi¬
sual techniques, which are
exerting a growing influence
on books, may be placed at
the service of the publishing
world? Since the book
can no longer be isolated
from the other major infor¬
mation media, should we not
now re-examine its role in
society?
THESE are the types
of problems the world com¬
munity is invited to ponder
during International Book
Year so that solutions may
be worked out with the help
of course of public authori¬
ties but also with that of all
types of institutions whether
they be regional, national or
international as well as pri¬
vate individuals.
If International Book Year
must be, above all, a natio
nal effort within each coun¬
try aimed at mobilizing ener¬
gies and resources and
sparking off concrete initia¬
tives, it must also be a vast
movement of international
co-operation.
In view of the immense
needs of the developing
countries, governments and
bodies administering bilat¬
eral or multilateral aid pro¬
grammes should make avail¬
able to these countries the
necessary technical and fi¬
nancial assistance to pro¬
mote national book produc¬
tion and distribution.
During International Book
Year, a preponderant role
will naturally be played by
the organizations grouping
the professional members
of the book world such as
the authors, publishers,
librarians and booksellers
who have been closely asso¬
ciated with the launching of
International Book Year and
who have further demons¬
trated their co-operative
spirit by adopting a common
"Charter of the Book".
But International Book
Year is above all the con¬
cern of the millions of ordi¬
nary people for whom read¬
ing books is part of their
daily occupation, or a means
of personal enlightenment
or a source of escape and
reverie in a word, insepar¬
able from happiness and the
dignity of living.
Let us all work and act
together to make "Books
for All" a reality for all.

Within the framework of International
Book Year, Unesco is publishing a
study on the book situation in the
world today, entitled " The Book
Hunger ". The study was written in
part by Prof. Robert Escarpit, the
French author and critic, and in part
by Ronald Barker, Secretary of the
Publishers Association of Great
Britain. The following article is a
condensation from two
of Prof. Escarpit's chapters.

Background",

READING
HABITS
AND BOOK
HUNGER
by Robert Escarpit
6
W,ILBUR SCHRAMM, in
Mass Media and National Develop¬
ment (published by Unesco in 1964),
describes two families in developing
countries. One family is African.
Communications are intense within the
family group, but it seems to be totally
unaware of what is happening just a
few miles away. One of the children
has been to school, but from lack of
practice he has forgotten how to read
and write, for there are no newspapers
ROBERT ESCARPIT is Professor of Comparat¬
ive Literature at the University of Bordeaux,
France, where he is also Director of the
Institut de Littérature et de Techniques
Artistiques de Masse. Literary historian and
specialist in publishing. Prof. Escarpit
regularly contributes a humorous column to
the Paris daily 'Le Monde". His Study
'The Revolution in Books" was published by
Unesco in 1965. (See "Unesco Courier",
September 1965.)
or books in the society in which he
lives.
The other family is Asian. Its links
with the outside world are more
numerous and long-standing, but the
whole social structure and the tradi¬
tional psychology of the elders pre¬
vent any real exchanges of ideas and
knowledge taking place with this out¬
side world, of which the family is both
well aware and apprehensive. Experi¬
ence is built up locally in conformity
with an ancient wisdom which has
used written expression for centuries,
not to disseminate thought, but to
conserve it.
What meaning can reading have in
these two families? In the former, liter¬
acy teaching and schooling lead up
blind alleys. It is possible, at the
cost of great effort, to teach members
of this family to decipher a text, but
actual reading will not result until the
need for communication is felt, that is,
until there is a desire for change.
Insofar as reading represents an
approach to others, a re-creation
from something offered by others, it
represents a quest for what is new.
If it is to have meaning, there must be
a will to innovate. In the case in
point this may occur as a result of
practical education in agricultural
techniques, and the first steps along
this path may come from listening to
a crackling old wireless set rather
than sitting over a book or newspaper.
In the Asian family, too, it is the
will to innovate which must provide
the urge to read. But here it is more
likely to lead to a clash between
generations with politics entering into

the picture. Whether or not written
communication is actually used will
then depend largely on opinion trends,
the steps taken by the authorities and
the enterprise shown by producers
and distributors at the national and
regional levels.
In both cases reading will come
into its own eventually, for only read¬
ing makes it possible to obtain infor¬
mation at will and thus establish atti¬
tudes and consolidate new ways of
thinking and behaving. However, the
means by which these new ways of
thinking and behaving are established
differ greatly from one situation to
another and so, too, do the ways in
which reading becomes a part of
social life.
It is therefore understandable that
the "reading habit", which does not
mean the same thing even in the two
cases considered above, has a differ¬
ent meaning again for a city-dweller
in a highly developed country reared
from infancy in and by means of the
written word, and so accustomed to
consulting it to bring his stock of
information up to date that he is some¬
times even unaware of doing so.
Since it is no longer part of a vital
process or motivated by a social or
psychological need, reading in a con¬
sumer society becomes a marginal
activity, a means rather than an end
in itself.
In other words, "not reading" is not
at all the same thing for a man living
in a world where reading has no
place, no purpose, no permanent sup¬
port, as it is for a man involved, be
it unwittingly, in the reading of a huge
variety of material newspapers, pub¬
licity, printed forms, instructions
amongst which books are but one
item.
A survey conducted in Italy, in 1962,
revealed that out of 400 persons of
all social strata 31 had never read a
book and 129 no longer read books.
In other words, 40 per cent were non-
readers. Another survey carried out
on 2,277 persons in Hungary, in 1964,
showed that 39.4 per cent were non-
readers. Finally, the results of a sur¬
vey conducted in France, in 1967, by
the French Public Opinion Institute
(IFOP) showed that in an adult popu¬
late of 6,865, 53 per cent were non-
readers.
However, if differences in criteria
and methods are taken into account,
this percentage, which shocked French

opinion at the time, is not in contra¬
diction with results obtained elsewhere.
Even in the most highly developed
countries a fairly large proportion of
those who are able to read never, or
hardly ever, read books.
Paradoxically, this proportion is
probably larger in the developed coun¬
tries, where schooling for all has made
learning to read an obligation, than it
is in countries where progress in
development is in fact measured in
terms of the literacy rate and where
those who can read are very highly
motivated to do so.
In the Netherlands, where reading
is very widespread, a survey in 1960,
in which the question of not reading
was not specifically raised, showed
that 40 per cent of the persons inter¬
viewed said that they did not like
reading. Yet, in East Pakistan, a
sample survey made in 1963-1964
among 145 families of government
employees of all levels revealed only
53 non-readers out of a total of 488
persons over the age of 12, that is,
less than 11 per cent.
The percentage of non-readers
would probably be higher still if the
investigation were confined to those
over school age. Lack of interest in
reading is not so common in youth.
Two surveys on the reading of young
recruits, one conducted in Switzer¬
land in 1960, the other in France in
1962-1963, gave very similar and
remarkably low percentages of non-
readers: 7. per cent in Switzerland,
8,9 per cent in France.
This fact is confirmed by the Italian
survey mentioned earlier. Out of
400 persons interviewed 160 were non-
readers, but whereas 31 said that
they had never been interested in
reading, 129 said that they had lost
the habit. The latter had therefore
been readers when they were young.
And the 31 persons who had never
read even when they were young,
represent precisely 7.75 per cent of
those interviewed.
The problem is therefore one which
arises in adult life and particularly
among young adults, who are the most
likely to lose their reading skills
through lack of practice.
The age at which reading skills tend
to be lost varies; the less schooling
received, the earlier it happens. In
the survey of young French recruits
the proportion of non-readers was
.

12.9 per cent among those who had
left school more than seven years
before enlistment, whereas there were
no non-readers among those who had
left school less than two years before
or who were continuing their studies.
Students are by far the most assi¬
duous readers everywhere, but this
does not mean that once their studies
are completed they will not eventually
be in danger of becoming non-readers
in their turn. There are even indica¬
tions that persons in senior positions
who are also university graduates read
less than middle-grade personnel.
This is probably because senior per¬
sonnel are constantly subjected to
the pressures of modern life, whereas
middle level staff are usually pro¬
tected by social legislation which pro¬
vides them with statutory leisure time.
However, the tenuous character of
reading habits has more remote
causes, going right back to the child's
pre-school years. It is probably then
that fundamental attitudes towards
books are formed. It has often been
shown that the child who meets books
for the first time when he goes to
school tends to associate reading
with the school situation, especially if

The appearance of the
mass circulation book
has been called "prob¬
ably the most important
cultural development In
the second half of the
20th century." The paper¬
back is now as much
a vehicle for classics of
literature as for technical
texts, as much for edu¬
cational material as for
popular fiction. It has
spread from the book¬
shop to new sales outlets
in supermarkets and pet¬
rol stations, drug stores
and village shops. Left,

bia, where Unesco re¬

no reading is done in the home.
If school work is difficult or unre¬
warding the child may acquire a dis¬
taste for reading and drop it altoge¬
ther once he leaves school. It is
therefore most important that books
should become part of a child's life,
of his play and everyday activities,
before he starts school. Familiarity
with books before learning to read
is a sound basis for the skills to be
acquired later.
Once schooling is over, obstacles
to reading increase. These obstacles
are of many different kinds, but they
can be summed up under three heads:
first, the physical, psychological or
social obstacles which have their
origin in the reader himself, second,
those due to the machinery of book
production and distribution, third,
those inherent in the actual reading
materials and the purpose for which
they are designed.
Among obstacles of the first type
lack of time is generally the chief
excuse given for not reading. More
often than not it simply conceals a
deeper, more pervasive aversion. It
may even be asked whether reading
is ever regarded as a pastime by most
readers, at least in the same way as
sport or watching television.
It is important, nevertheless, to take
the work-leisure ratio into account in¬
sofar as fatigue is one of the most fre¬
quent reasons given for not reading.
However, here too caution is required.
Although the physical tiredness of the
manual worker and the mental exhaus¬
tion of the executive are indeed obsta¬
cles to the effort which the simplest
reading demands, it has been found
that many people (mainly those en¬
gaged in intellectual work) say that
they do not read much because they
are tired and also that they read for
relaxation.
It appears then that a certain mar¬
gin of "availability" is necessary for
reading and that it depends not only
on working hours and working condi¬
tions but on the reader's situation
generally: housing conditions, home
environment, economic level, tenure of
employment, and so on. It also seems
that this availability is not in itself
enough.
The disadvantages stemming from
the tendency to associate books with
school work are just one example of
the many social stereotypes which
prevent people from reading. The mis¬
trust, and hence disdain, once felt
for an occupation which did not make
any call on what were traditionally
regarded as virile qualities may have
been attenuated, toned down, and
have assumed different forms, but
nonetheless remain latent in many
circles.
Other cultural stereotypes, which
have emerged more recently, tend to
set value on reading, but they do not
always succeed in profoundly changing
the old attitudes. Persons interviewed
in surveys generally recognize that
reading is "a good thing", reading
"has its uses", reading is "necessary",
but they are inclined to regard them¬
selves as exceptions even if they
sometimes also blame themselves
on the ground that they have no time,
have other things to do, or simply
give preference to other activities.
Hardly anyone says now that reading
is "all right for women", but there is
still a widespread feeling that read¬
ing is "good for other people", par¬
ticularly, it is implied, those who have fl
nothing better to do. V
Now, as all reading is to some
extent active, no one reads unless he

BOOK HUNGER (Continued)
A startling finding : TV and radio promote reading
wants to read. One of the main rea¬
sons why people do not read in the
developed countries is that, despite
the progress made in education and
its generalization, books are still alien
to the vast majority. In other words,
the technical progress of barely five
centuries, which has made possible
the proliferation of books since the
invention and development of printing,
has not been followed by comparable
progress in the evolution of mental
attitudes.
In our "literate" societies "pre-
literate" attitudes prevail. Part
though only part of the hold of the
audio-visual media is due to the fact,
not that they are "modern", but rather
that they appeal to earlier, not
entirely forgotten ways. And this can
lead to an enrichment of life, if the
habit of reading can take its place and
play its part along with this return to
earlier habits.
If this is true of countries with an
old written culture, it is even truer of
emerging countries which have gone
straight to the audio-visual media.
Contrary to what Marshall McLuhan
seems to be saying, it is not certain
that all the suns of the Gutenberg
galaxy have yet come to life.
Around 1970, world book production
was running at approximately 500,000
titles and from 7 to 8 thousand million
copies per year, the annual growth
rate being about 4 per cent for titles
and 6 per cent for printing runs. Be¬
tween 1950 and 1970, world production
of titles doubled and the production of
copies trebled. In the same period,
taking into account adults who became
literate and children who attended
school, the world's reading popula¬
tion more than doubled.
This shows that individual consump¬
tion of reading matter increased
slightly and we can say with some
confidence, therefore, that books are
still holding their own even in an era
of mass communication.
It is undeniable that audio-visual
communications media have promptly
satisfied a demand which has been
latent for several generations and that
they are currently in the throes of a
vigorous expansion. It would be mis¬
leading to equate this "take off" ex¬
pansion with that of printed communi¬
cations, which, in a large part of the
world, have long held pride of place.
Moreover, in the most highly devel¬
oped countries, the rate of expansion,
first of radio broadcasting and then of
television, is showing a tendency to
level off to that of books.
The book, which has been in exis¬
tence for more than 4,000 years, is a
wonderful means of communication in
which messages are coded and can
be reproduced, multiplied, moved, re¬
trieved and decoded by any individual
who has the key to the code or, in
other words, who can read.
Over the centuries, efforts to perfect
books have dealt with the form of the
thing itself: scroll, folio or pamphlet;
with its material: papyrus, parchment
or paper; or with the process of repro¬
duction: hand-copying, hand-printing,
mechanical printing, offset, etc. In
the nineteenth century, the point was
reached, with books published in large
editions and with newspapers, when
a communications network had been
established which satisfied the needs
of industrial society.
This, of course, had its counterpart.
For the machine to work, the decoding
technique had to be popularized. All
Out of a world production of some 500,000 book titles in 1969, about 225,000 (45 per
cent) came from Europe (the U.S.S.R. excluded), representing scarcely 13 per cent of the
world's population. Around 1970, Africa, Latin America and Asia (without Japan but including
the People's Republic of China) were producing only 19 per cent of the world's books,
although they contained about 50 per cent of the world's literate adults and 63 per cent
of the children at school. Below, village campus of "Literacy House", at Lucknow,

over the Western world, the movement
towards mass literacy went hand in
hand with the development of books
and newspapers. This was a vital
necessity so that the social mechanism
could have the information circuits
which were indispensable to its smooth
running. The progress of education,
compulsory schooling and literacy,
for example, created new needs. At
the beginning of the twentieth cen¬
tury, practically all the developed
world's communications were chan¬
nelled through books and through
newspapers.
At this stage, saturation was reach¬
ed. This was due to the ponderous-
ness of the machinery for distribu¬
tion among a public continually on the
increase, and also to the relative
slowness of the coding and decoding
process in a world where it was be¬
coming essential to save time. The
printed communications system, pro¬
gressively saturated in the first half of
the twentieth century, began to fail,
bringing about a general crisis in the
newspaper world and publishing.
It was at this juncture that audio¬
visual means of communication made
their appearance. Quickly they took
over a large share of the responsibi¬
lities which the written word had been
carrying and which it was no longer
able to shoulder. This relief was effec¬
tive in the first place because it made
it possible to grasp an event immedia¬
tely, whether the happening was fact
or fiction.
Newspapers were more directly
affected by this than books simply
because events are the domain of
newspapers. Finding themselves
freed from the concern of covering
topical events as closely as possible,

newspapers sought a new balance
with radio and television broadcasting
either by providing considered com¬
ments or by comparative news pre¬
sentation.
Where books were concerned, the
consequences were slower to show
themselves. They were also more
complex. So far as the contents go,
it is. likely, for example, that coming
years may see a certain regression or
at least, a change in fictional literature.
This is no doubt because informative
literature such as essays, reporting,
histories and works of popularization,
better satisfies the needs of a public
whose horizons have suddenly
expanded.
There are no limits to the questions
which radio and television can ask but
it is more difficult for them to provide
the constituents of an answer. In any
case, the pressing problem facing
books, whether they are fiction or not,
is how to follow up information which
is proliferating, obsessional, with a
temporary and, by definition, fleeting
import.
Books have also been transformed
in the material sense. A real book
revolution was beginning in the years
preceding the Second World War, but
it has developed especially since 1950,
affecting manufacturing techniques
and distributing methods and showing
itself, more particularly, in the appear¬
ance of the paperback. The paper¬
back, which is produced in very large
numbers, is sold at a price suited to
the purchasing power of the masses
and distributed through a network of
sales outlets which have little in
common with the traditional bookshop.
The mass-audience book has placed
within the grasp of countless readers
immense treasures of science and
culture hitherto denied to them. In
addition, the boundaries between the
various types of intellectual output
have become less marked. The paper¬
back is as much a vehicle for popular
fiction as for educational material and
as much for the classics as for
technical handbooks and research
publications.
Nowadays, books can no longer be
treated separately from other commun¬
ications media. In a large variety of
ways such as the use of colour
illustrations, the support of visual or
sound material and publication in
periodical form, books are acquiring
something of the flexibility of audio¬
visual media with which they have
increasingly closer links. As a
general rule, the development of radio
broadcasting and especially of tele¬
vision, increases readership and
creates a demand for books in direct
proportion to the size of the audio¬
visual network.
In fact, what characterizes the
audio-visual media of the present time,
is that the coding and decoding of
information is almost entirely auto¬
matic and requires only a minimum
of initiative when received. The
response of the recipient is of only
secondary importance to the way the
system works, and feedback to the
broadcaster exists only in a precar¬
ious and marginal fashion, if it exists
at all. In addition, the rate of
reception and the order of chronolog¬
ical sequences have been fixed once
and for all, which makes it difficult to
reconstruct the message on arrival
and to fit it into an independent
system of thought.
This is why it is impossible, when

BOOK HUNGER (Continued)
audio-visual media are used for teach¬
ing or for artistic transmission, to
dispense with the written element
such as the report, the commentary,
the duplicated lesson or the book.
Written communication seems to be
an irreplaceable compromise between
the demands of dissemination and
those of feedback. Even on a large
scale, reading is an act corresponding
to the act of writing. It cannot be
reduced to a simple receiving mecha¬
nism. The recipient has to show
some initiative and in this respect,
reading is an element of progress.
Books, having lost their former
monopoly and having thus been freed
from their bonds, have in some
respects become the hub of modern
communications. We need to find a
new kind of book, however.
In countries which have been
developed for a long time, people
still have an attitude towards books
which goes back to the time when
they were instruments for the internal
communication of a culture of initia¬
tion reserved for the reading élite.
Through force of circumstances, books
have gone down into the market place,
but they will long remain the prisoners
of their myths and legends.
In contrast, countries which began
their development during the last few
decades do not need to take the long
way round which the written word
represents in order to meet the first
urgent demands of mass communic¬
ation.
Untrammelled by pre-existing situ¬
ations, vested interests or established
organizations, they can choose, within
the limits of their material resources,
more advanced solutions than were
open to countries which have preced¬
ed them along the road to develop¬
ment. However, the more they take
the audio-visual "short cut", the more
urgent and immediate will be their
need of books, which alone make it
possible to consolidate gains and
move forward.
Here is where the real problems
arise. The developing countries,
through their efforts in the matters
of schooling and literacy, are prepar¬
ing people for the reading of books,
but what they lack are the means of
producing those books.
Experience shows that the develop¬
ment of the audio-visual network in
a country depends directly on the
growth of that country's gross national
product, whereas the impact of eco¬
nomic progress on reading becomes
apparent only after a long interval of
time and does not make itself fully
felt until the reading public has grown
large enough to provide its own
producers.
It follows from this that the position
of books in the world shows marked
inequalities if considered by regions
rather than globally. With an ever-
widening need for reading material,
we find areas of abundance, areas of
scarcity and areas of famine.

by Lev Vladimirov
I ARTIN LUTHER, the great
reformer, called the introduction of the
printing press "a second deliverance
of mankind a deliverance from intel¬
lectual darkness", and Abbé Sieyès,
the 18th century French political theo¬
rist, maintained that "printing has
changed the fate of Europe; it will
transform the entire globe."
The introduction of the printing press
to Europe brought a rapid increase in
book production. By 1500, half a cen¬
tury later, just over 30,000 titles had
been printed in Europe, while pro¬
duction reached about 250,000 titles
in the 16th century and exceeded
seven million in the 19th.
Today, even modest estimates fore¬
cast that over 25 million titles will be
published during the 20th century.
In one year alone, 1970, over
1,300 million books were printed in
the Soviet Union more than were
produced during the first 150 years
of book printing in Europe.
Small wonder that some researchers
speak of an "explosion" of printed
matter. And yet, paradoxical as it
may seem, since printing is in its
golden age, certain forecasters say
that the traditional book is facing
extinction, that a general crisis in the
publishing industry is imminent, that
our age carries the germ of a disease
that will kill the book, and that the
monopoly of the press as a means
of mass communication is ended.
LEV VLADIMIROV is Director of the Scien¬
tific Library of the Vilnius State University
(Lithuanian S.S.R.) and a prominent Soviet
expert on books and librarianship. From
1964 to 1970 he was Director of the Dag
Hammarskjold United Nations Library in New
York. Secretary of the Committee tor Library
Education of the International Federation of
Library Associations (IFLA), Lev Vladimirov
has published numerous studies and articles
on the history of books, librarianship. biblio¬
graphy and library organization.
Indeed, the cinema, radio, television,
tape-recorders, video tape-recorders,
microcopying, electronics, cybernetics
and other remarkable inventions are
invading the field that had until
recently been monopolized by books.
And though the growing need for
information has led to an increase in
publications of the traditional type, at
the same time the production of repro-
graphed and photocopied microbooks,
as well as "talking books", has
steadily developed.
In trying to define the further devel¬
opment of the book in our time many
defend the traditional book uncondi¬
tionally and reject everything new;
others predict that books will disappear
or that they will at least lose their
importance, that the book market will
shrink, and so on .
In my opinion, both points of view
are wrong. Pessimistic predictions
are disproved by the steady growth
of publications throughout the world.
According to Unesco, world book
output has grown from 285,000 titles
in 1955 to 487,000 in 1968.
However, an analysis of the corre¬
lation between the population figures
in the various countries and their
share in the world's book output
shows that there still is an astounding
lack of correspondence between these
two figures. The population of the
U.S.S.R., for example, accounts for
6.8 per cent of the world's population,
but its book output represents 15.6
per cent of world production.
Recent Unesco statistics show how
disproportionately book production is
distributed among the various con¬
tinents. Europe, North America and
the Soviet Union produced nearly 75
per cent of all books published in
1969, the largest proportion coming
from Europe, which, with only 13 per
cent of the world's population, pro¬
duced 45 per cent of the titles.
Asia (excluding Soviet Asia), with
56 per cent of the world's population,
produced no more than 20 per cent of
the books, South America with about 5
percent of world population, published
2 per cent, and Africa, with almost
10 per cent of the population, pro¬
duced less than 2 per cent.
Closing the book gap has become
an important priority for developing
countries, and to bring book produc¬
tion up to the level of five books a
year per capita, output would have
to be raised almost twentyfold in
Africa, twelvefold in Asia and sixfold
in South America. It is thus illogical
to say that the printed word is about
to decline and that the book age is
as good as over.
Only market conditions can explain
the drop in book output in France
from 19,289 titles in 1966 to 18,646
in 1968, in Italy from 10,593 to 8,868,
and a simultaneous rise in output in
Great Britain from 28,789 to 31,372
and in the Federal Republic of Ger¬
many from 22,720 to 30,223.
Naturally, in the industrialized coun¬
tries, where the publishing industry
is well developed, output grows more
slowly than in the developing countries.
In Cuba, for example, the output rose
between 1966 and 1968 by 25 per cent
and in Ceylon by 30 per cent, but it
has not reached its maximum even
there, and the need for books is far
from satisfied.
The headway made by education
does much to expand the book market.
It is ridiculous to speak of a saturation
of this market when Unesco tells us
that 800 of the 2,225 million adults
in the world are still illiterate. There
is still plenty of "virgin land" to be a n
tilled and books will be the main | J
implement used for that purpose.

BOOKS, ELECTRONICS, TELEVISION (Continued)
'Never will electric power have as much force
as the electricity enclosed in the printed word'
and culture through many channels
is typical of our times. You may get
to know one of Shakespeare's trage¬
dies by reading a volume of his works,
but you can also see it on the stage
or the screen, hear it on the radio,
view its performance on TV or hear
it as a recording on an LP or on tape.
Except for the first two, these possi¬
bilities were not available in the last
century. This abundance of channels
gives rise to definite problems and
disproportions, especially since some
channels "jam" others and develop at
their expense.
In countries where the number of
illiterates is particularly high (75-90 per
cent of the population) books and the
press are, for a long time to come,
unlikely to become a nationwide
means of communication. Newspapers,
magazines and books are there¬
fore of necessity addressed to the
narrow section of the literate audience.
Radio and TV, on the other hand, are
rapidly becoming mass media.
However, in the developing countries
too the growth in literacy and the
rise of the cultural level are quickly
raising the importance of books. The
book is the foundation on which the
culture of a nation is built. Other
means of communication, even such
progressive ones as television, are
only auxiliary means of cultural
development.

ADDRESSING the General
Council of the International Federation
of Library Associations in 1968, J.E.
Morpurgo, Director of the British Na¬
tional Book League, said: "Five times
in my lifetime I have heard that the
book is finished. First, there was the
silent film; and the pleasure of seeing
Pearl White or Theda Bara rescued
from the railroad line was said to be
spelling life to Miss White or Miss
Bara and death to the book. Then
voice was added to the lovely, piano-
tinkling, near-silence of the cinema,
and the stridencies of Hollywood were
thought to have shattered all" hope of
a future for the book. There followed
or there ran coincidental with the
talking film sound radio; entertain¬
ment, enlivenment, enlightenment,
taken into each man's home. . . and, it
was thought, destroying the opportun¬
ity and the will to read. And most
recently came two most potent alter¬
natives to print: television and cyber¬
netics. . . And yet the book survived."
Why did it? What makes us believe
that the traditional book, despite the
development of other effective means
of intellectual communication, will not
only survive but also preserve its func¬
tion as "one of the greatest means of
human progress", and will extend that
function?
First and foremost, because none
of the new technical communication
means can fully replace the book as
a source of information. Radio and
TV can be called means of "instan¬
taneous" or "express" information.
Their informative action stops the
moment the broadcast is over. The
book, however, is a means of constant
information, an enormous reservoir
from which we can draw any amount
of information at any time required.
has shown that
the capabilities of various media differ
greatly according to the nature and
complexity of the information being
transmitted. Simple facts are best
conveyed orally (including the use of
radio and television). To put over
more complex information, a combina¬
tion of sound and ¡mages gives better
results. Highly complex informa¬
tion is best relayed and imparted by a
printed page containing illustrations.
And an ordinary book, unlike a
"speaking" or a microbook, does not
require any kind of electronic appara¬
tus.
It has also been shown that we
assimilate information much more
quickly by reading than by hearing
(even without the aid of new methods
of speed-reading). And we should
also take into account the aesthetic
aspect of the assimilation of know¬
ledge the pleasure we derive, for
instance, from reading a new book, a
perfect product of the printer's art.
The book has indeed travelled a
long road, from the Bible printed by
Gutenberg, a work whose make-up
closely copied those of medieval
manuscripts, to the masterpieces of
the modern printing industry.
Improvements in printing technology
have led to such a tremendous
increase in publishing that, in some
respects, man nowadays resembles
Goethe's sorcerer's apprentice who
was able to conjure up the spirits but
unable to control them. The libraries
were the first to feel the catastrophic
effects of the growing avalanche of
publications, which posed many
serious problems.
F. Rider, director of the library at
Wesleyan University (USA) drew
attention to this danger as early as
1944. He forecast that by the year
2040, the Library of Yale University
would have about 200 million volumes,
occupying 6,000 miles of shelves.
Its index cards, if the method of
indexing was preserved till then,
would require about 750,000 catalog
uing drawers, which would occupy
an area of no less than 80 acres.
The yearly increase of the library stock
would be 12 million volumes and
their insertion in the catalogue would
require a staff of about 6,000 people.
Though the author may have exag¬
gerated, the problem is clearly an ur¬
gent one, even if the book stock in¬
creases half as quickly as he expects.
Microcopying, in his view, is the only
way out of the dilemma.
The microbook has already estab¬
lished itself firmly in libraries. The
Dag Hammarskjöld Library of the
United Nations in New York stores
microfilms of newspapers, and as of
1969, U.N. documents were also
being microcopied. The microbook
is widely used in most scientific and
specialized libraries. This will help
to resolve the acute problem of pro¬
viding storage space for books. It
will also extend the life of publica¬
tions printed on low quality paper,
help libraries to acquire unique
editions, reduce postage fees on the
sending of books from one library to
another, and offer many other advan¬
tages.
But, in my view, it is not the "over¬
population" of the book world and
library storage that should rank as
the "No. 1 problem". The main prob¬
lem is the enormous volume of
scientific and technical information.
Academician A. Nesmeyanov of the
USSR has written: "According to pro¬
visional data, about 10,000 journals
in the world are of interest to chem¬
ists. These publications contain no
less than 200,000 articles on chem¬
istry and chemical technology. About
5,000 books, over 30,000 patents and
about 20,000 scientific reports are
published every year on chemistry and
chemical technology. . .
"If a chemist began, on January 1,
to read all the publications of pro¬
fessional interest appearing during the
year and read them for 40 hours a
week at the rate of four publications
an hour, by December 31 he would
have read only one twentieth of these
publications."
^UlMILAR conditions prevail
in the other sciences. Ever-growing
streams of information submerge the
researcher, complicate his work, and
lead to an unnecessary waste of re¬
sources and effort. Without the use
of technical means, notably of elec¬
tronic computers for the storage and
retrieval of information, nothing can
be done to improve this state of affairs.
The traditional methods and means of
information retrieval are entirely in¬
adequate today.
Only computers can resolve the

Since its first emergency aid to war-damaged libraries 25 years ago, Unesco has developed
a broad and varied programme designed to Increase and Improve library services. It has
provided training fellowships for librarians, organized seminars and courses and has set
up two librarianship training centres In Africa at Dakar (Senegal) and Kampala (Uganda). The
New Delhi Public Library Project, launched In 1951, has been followed by further pilot
projects In Colombia, Nigeria, and the Ivory Coast Photo shows Mr. Julien Cain, Chairman

intricate problems facing the modern
librarian. From personal experience as
director of the U.N. Library in New
York, I can say that this library needed
computers to index the mass of U.N.
documents and publications, a problem
it could not cope with before these
machines were introduced.
Yet even though I believe that elec¬
tronics have a great future in the
information services, the idea that the
library of tomorrow will be a library
without books and even without libra¬
rians is both fantastic and fallacious.
It is said that the most prominent
feature in the library of tomorrow will
be people and not books, since the
book in its traditional form will be
extinct. Such a library, it is foreseen,
will resemble a laboratory in which
there will be switchboards instead of
tables, dictaphones for ordering printed
matter, data and information, auto¬
matic distribution mechanisms for their
delivery to the reader's switchboard,
screens of electronic machines to
reproduce the literature supplied and
even push-button translating machines
in case the reader does not know
the language the text is written in.
This view of the library of tomorrow
presupposes a different type of libra¬
rian from the one we have today. His
main attribute will be a knowledge of
machines whereas the main task of
today's librarian is to be familiar with
books, to know the requirements of
the readers and to satisfy them.
Owing to the giant growth of the
volume of scientific knowledge, the
differentiation and specialization of the
sciences and research institutions,
more and more libraries will specialize
in particular fields. Naturally, as in the
world of science, this will go hand in
hand with integration. Our age is
the age of specialized libraries and
specialized networks of libraries, which
supplement each other, and are co¬
ordinated and interlinked by every
means of communication.
Nevertheless, the traditional book
will hold a place of no little importance
in the technological process of these
"information factories". In ordinary
lending libraries the traditional book
will probably continue to play the prin¬
cipal and decisive role.
The new technical means are not
the enemy of books, but their ally
and helper. The historic role of the
book as a means of establishing
contacts between people, satisfying
their spiritual needs and providing a
source of knowledge will grow in step
with mankind's social, cultural and
scientific advance.
Answering those who bemoan the
imminent death of the book in the
age of technological progress and
predict its replacement by new con¬
venient mechanisms for word and
thought transmission, Stephan Zweig
wrote:
"No power source has been able to
create as much light as is sometimes
emitted by a small volume, and never
will electric power have as much force
as the electricity enclosed in the
printed word. The book is a never-
aging and invincible force, the most
concentrated and multiform; should it
then be afraid of technology? Is it
not with the help of these same books
that technology improves and dissemi¬
nates? Everywhere, and not only in
our personal life, the book is the alpha
and omega of all knowledge, the foun¬
dation of every science."

Marshall McLuhan achieved world celebrity with the contention, expressed notably
in his book, "The Gutenberg Galaxy," that one of the great transformations of modern
society is the decline of the written word and the rise to pre-eminence of audio-visual
media of communication. On the occasion of International Book Year, the Canadian
educator and thinker explains his views in the following article written specially for
this issue of the "Unesco Courier." We have also asked the noted writers, Alberto Moravia,

the book in the modern world (see articles pages 23 and 24). On page 30, Y.V. Lakshmana

ended the regime of oral scholastic
philosophy and provided the means of
retrieving the world of pagan authors.
Any new technology simultaneous¬
ly erases its predecessor and restores
a much older form of experience.
At the same time that the new inten¬
sity of words as visual objects came
into play against the old oral ground,
words became visual counters in a
new "objective" sense. The world
of resonance and multi-levelled depth
of verbal structures which had been
the basis of the exegesis both of
the sacred page and the Book of
Nature, was suddenly muted by high
visual stress.
New kinds of rational authority
were substituted for the old resonance
with its affinity for magic and meta¬
morphosis. Thus, in More's Utopia
in 1512, Hythlodaye comments on the
fading scholastic philosophy as an
oral thing in distinction to the new
forms of discourse which came in with
the recovery of the ancient writers:
"Your scholastic philosophy is
not unpleasant among friends

the councils of kings, where
great matters must be debated
MARSHALL McLUHAN is Director of the
Centre for Culture and Technology of the
University of Toronto (Canada) and professor
of Humanities at Fordham University, New
York (U.S.A.). Among his books are 'The
Mechanical Bride' (1961); "Explorations In
Communication' (with E.S. Carpenter, 1960);
'The Gutenberg Galaxy" (1962); 'Under¬
standing Media" (1964); 'The Medium is the
Massage" (with Quentin Flore, 1967); 'From

and reasoned with great autho¬
rity, these things have no
place... for speculative philo¬
sophy thinks all things suitable
for all occasions. There is ano¬
ther philosophy that is more
urbane, which knows as you
would say her own stage, and
therefore orders and behaves
herself in the play that she has
in hand, playing her part accord¬
ingly with comeliness, uttering
nothing out of due order and
fashion."
Clearly, scholastic philosophy was a
form of discourse that would not do
in the new era. It was doomed, not
because of its content or meaning,
but because it was chatty, conver¬
sational discussion that took all
manner of things into account at
any given moment. In communication
among friends it's natural to interrupt
and to interject observations at any
point. In such oral interchange there
are numerous simultaneous vistas of
any topic whatever. The subject is
looked at swiftly from many angles:
classic notions and insights concern¬
ing that subject are, via memory, on
the tip of every tongue in the intimate
group.
Such an oral form assumes ency-
clopedism, not specialism. With the
coming of print, specialism developed
because the individual reader, by
solitary effort, could speed over the
super-highways of assembly-line print¬
ing without the company or comment
of a group of fellow learners and
disputants.
In his university studies on the
18th century Christopher Wordsworth
records how written examinations
were introduced at Cambridge when
it became impossible for examiners
to keep up with the individual reading
and studies of their students. As
books became cheaper, the quicker
and more diligent students discover¬
ed that they could acquire know¬
ledge for themselves where previous
generations had been dependent on
the oral teaching.
Today, deep into the electric age,
the authority of visual connectedness
and quantified measurement has
yielded to the facts of quantum phy¬
sics in which the mode of relation of
events is via the "resonant interval"
of Heisenberg and Linus Pauling.
With the advent of telegraph and tele¬
phone and radio and TV as service
environments, totally new figure-
ground relationships have come into
play. In science and in fiction, in art
and in politics, the fact of audience
involvement in all aspects of the social
process has become an irresistible
datum.
So far as the book is concerned,
the mode and means of involvement
of reader as co-author and of audi¬
ences as actors has been the symbolic
or discontinous form in poetry and
painting, and music, in press and
novel, and in drama. The mosaic or
collage, inevitable with the telegraph
press, for example, offers us the world
under a single date line and offers
up the world audience as a daily sacri¬
fice of ritual participation in the making
of news.
With the advent of electric inform¬
ation environments, the former con¬
nected forms of discourse and social
organization have steadily been sup¬
planted by decentralist and discontinu¬
ous patterns. The market, which had
been the figure for the industrial
ground of hardware production, has
become increasingly diaphanous as
information and credit replace specie
and bullion.

Above, the world's oldest printed book, the Diamond Sutra, a
section of the Buddhist scriptures, printed in China In 868 A.D.
by Wang Chieh. Discovered in 1907, It had been sealed up for
nearly 900 years In a secret chamber bricked off inside a cave at
Tun Huang, north-west China. The chamber was piled solid ten
feet high with 15,000 or more manuscript books composing the

This map retraces the westward journey of papermaking from its
invention in China In 105 A.D. until it was first established in
Europe 1,000 years later. Figures at each of the main staging
posts on the Paper Road are the dates of the earliest recorded
local manufacture of paper. Right, an engraving showing a paper-
making workshop in China; at left, a worker places sheets to
dry on a brick wall heated by a fire. The Chinese first produced
a sort of paper or near-paper from raw silk. Since the process
was too costly for large-scale production, they experimented with
other materials mulberry tree bark, rags, hemp fibres and old fish
nets and thus Invented true paper. Paper did not reach Italy
until 1276 and Germany until 1320.

CHINA, BIRTHPLACE
OF PRINTING
CENTURIES
BEFORE
GUTENBERG
Contrary to widespread belief, paper, printing
and movable type were Invented, not In Europe,
but in China, several centuries before the birth
of Gutenberg. Paper, without which printing
would be impossible, was invented by Ts'ai
Lun in 105 A.D., and was In use in China over
1,000 years before it came to the West (see map
below). The oldest printed book extant (photo
left) was produced in China, in 868 A.D., by
Wang Chieh, who thus can claim the title of
the first known printer in the world. This
book, a Buddhist text, was printed by the
xylographie or block printing method in which
each page was engraved on a block of wood.
Chinese printing reached unsurpassed heights
during the Sung Dynasty (10th century) with
Feng Tao, whose name is as famous in the
Orient as Gutenberg's is in Europe. Several
thousand copies could be run off In one day
with the block printing method, which remain¬
ed popular in the Orient even until modern
times because of the thousands of ideo¬
graphic characters in Chinese and other lan¬
guages as compared with under 30 letters in
the European alphabet. Movable type was
invented by a Chinese printer named Pl-
Sheng in 1045 using fired clay, to be followed
shortly thereafter by movable type using tin,
wood, bronze and other metals. Korea and
Japan made extensive use of such metallic
types. In 1403 the Korean king T'ai Tsung
decreed that characters should be cast In
bronze so that more books could be printed.
By the time printing began in the West, three
fonts of type had been produced at the type-
making factory founded by the Korean king.
Above, wheel-shaped, rotating table for the storage of fonts of movable type
invented in China by Pi-Sheng in about 1045. Characters were stored according
to their "yun", or rhyme, in eight Inner and sixteen outer compartments. The table
was made of light wood and the table top was about 7 ft. in diameter. The type¬
setter sat between two such tables, one of which contained a selection of the most
usual Chinese characters. This table was described by the Chinese printer
Wang Cheng in a history of movable type in 1314.

THE YESTERMORROW OF THE BOOK (Continued from page 16)
20
Print made handwriting "obsolete",
but there Is more handwriting in the
present day than there ever was
before printing.
Obsolescence Is not extinction but
the necessary matrix of innovation.
Therefore handwriting has blossomed
out in many new forms, Including
that of the typescript.
In the same way as the .Information
offered by the printed book is out¬
stripped by photo and film and TV,
the book has steadily hybridized with
other forms of visual image giving us
many new art forms. Paradoxically,
even the paperback created a revo¬
lution in reading habits that wiped out
many of the familiar distinctions be¬
tween high-brow and low-brow. Such
a revolution seems to have been based
on the mere substitution of glue for
stitching.
Xerography and the micro-dot libra¬
ry bridged the gap between the writ¬
ten and the oral worlds. It has often
been pointed out that the highly liter¬
ate person is one who has been read
aloud to as a child.
At a time when xerography and
electronic techniques for simulating
the printed word are enveloping the
book world, would it not be appro¬
priate for us to exchange some observ¬
ations on the past, present and future
of the book?
There is a sense in which it is pos¬
sible to speak of the book as "hard¬
ware" technology. At present, the
computer technicians speak of their
operation as "software". Hardware
environments naturally have a very
different character from software
environments.
Eric Havelock in his Preface to
Plato goes into the question of the
Greek transition from an oral to a
written tradition. Albert Lord's Singer
of Tales is a kind of complement to
Havelock's book in delineating the
characteristics of the oral tradition in
relation to literature. John Mac-
Kenzie's The Two-Edged Sword
traces a similar dichotomy in the world
of the scriptures. (Only a few days
ago, browsing through a study of
rabbinical literature, I was startled to
read that neither David nor his psalms
were known to rabbinical scholars of
yore. David was a singer, not a
writer.)
"History as she is harped" has a
totally different character from writ¬
ten history or literature. There is
no chronology in Homer, no perspec¬
tive and no retrospect. It's all now.
That's oral, also electric. In our own
time, access to the oral tradition
through anthropology- has created a
great deal of revision in our image
and definition of "culture". In his vol¬
ume Propaganda, Jacques Ellul, after
looking at various possible approaches
to defining propaganda, concludes
that it is the entirety of a culture in
action; what the Greeks called
"perivallo" or the striking from all
sides at once.
Mr. and Mrs. Opie In their The
Lore and Language of School Child¬
ren have studied the amazing persis¬
tence and homogeneity of children's
games and jokes and gags, whether
in Belfast or Melbourne or New York
or Toronto or Liverpool. This oral
culture which they study consists of
matters taught only by children to
children, not those nursery songs and
stories that adults teach to children.
The paradox is, oral culture is stable
and conservative, whereas the written
word is fashionable and fluctuating.
There is a good deal on this subject
in The Gutenberg Galaxy. For
example, "correct" grammar begins
with the written word. Nobody ever
committed a grammatical error in an
oral culture any more than a modern
child has ever been known to commit
an error in a slang phrase.
To the literary man there is little
congeniality in tackling the entire
environment as culture. He is trying
to specialize his attention in very
special visual ways. One could do
worse than consider The Dunciad in
our enterprise of studying the future
of the book. To Pope, concluding
his Dunciad, the plethora of paper and
print in his time seemed to have blot¬
ted out all serious culture and all
tradition:
In vain, in vain the all-composing Hour
Resistless falls: the Muse obeys the Pow'r.
She comes I she comes I the sable Throne
behold
Of Night primeval and of Chaos old I
Before her. Fancy's gilded clouds decay.
And all its varying Rainbows die away.
Wit shoots in vain its momentary fires.
The meteor drops, and in a flash expires.
As one by one, at dread Medea's strain.
The sick'ning stars fade off th' ethereal plain ;
As Argus' eyes by Hermes' wand opprest,
Clos'd one by one to everlasting rest;
Thus at her felt approach, and secret might.
Art after Art goes out, and all is Night.
See skulking Truth to her old cavern fled.
Mountains of Casuistry heap'd o'er her head!
Philosophy, that lean'd on Heav'n before.
Shrinks to her second cause, and is no more.
Physic of Metaphysic begs defence.
And Metaphysic calls for aid on Sense!
See Mystery to Mathematics fly I
In vain I they gaze, turn giddy, rave and die.
Religion blushing veils her sacred fires.
And unawares Morality expires.
Nor Public Flame, nor Private, dares to shine ;
Nor human Spark is left, nor Glimpse Divine I
Loi thy dread Empire, Chaos Us restor'd;
Light dies before thy uncreating word;
Thy hand, great Anarch I lets the curtain fall.
And universal Darkness buries All.
Alexander Pope felt that an inky
smog had settled over all human
consciousness in the age of Newton.
What lay ahead now seems, in retro¬
spect, to have been a considerable
advance over the world that Pope
saw in dissolution. In the age of
video cassettes, when it will be pos¬
sible to dial a book as easily as an
acquaintance, totally new forms of
literary experience are at hand. It
is our literate job to be ready to
cope with these innovations.

SAVED
22 FOR THE
YEAR 2000
It will take until the year 2000 for the precious book collections of the libraries of. Florence, ravaged
by the floods of 1966, to be fully restored. At the National Library alone, a million books and documents
were damaged. Above, a cleaning and drying centre set up In a former tobacco-curing shop. Despite
the enormous efforts made over the past five years, it will take another 30 years to complete the page-by-
page repair of this vast mountain of books, which form a priceless portion of Italy's cultural heritage.
In response to Unesco's appeal generous International aid was made available to the Italian Government
for this herculean task. With Unesco's co-operation, an International Book Preservation Centre is
being established to continue and supplement the work of the two research laboratories already set
up in Florence to safeguard the damaged books and archives.

THE IMAGE
AND THE WORD
I HE notion that the book
and the printed word are in rapid
decline gained its widest currency
following the spectacular success of
the image and the media of visual
communication the cinema, television,
advertising displays, strip cartoons,
road signs and so on.
But few persons appear to have
given much thought to the fact that
the image owes its success, in turn,
to the entry into history's arena of
large masses of humanity, including
their new literates and total illiterates.
The illiterate person undeniably has
a distinctive visual awareness. For
him the whole world is a vast system
of visual signs and symbols waiting
to be interpreted and translated. The
origin of writing itself, with its slow
progression from the representation
of an object to a form of symbolism,
shows that primitive man used his eyes
for tasks that civilized man later
entrusted to his ears.
So in the first place, what we are
dealing with is not so much a decline
of the book as a triumph of the image,
a triumph due in far smaller measure
to those who have always been
readers than to those who only
yesterday did not know how read.
If this is so, as I myself believe,
we can expect at any time to see a
steady decline in the influence of the
image and a corresponding resurgence
of the book. In other words, as
millions upon millions of illiterate men
and women learn to read and write,
they are likely to abandon the primitive,
direct language of the image in favour
of the more elaborate, more indirect
language of the printed word.
Modern man, moreover, uses the
picture in ways that are basically
different from those of primitive man.
In the primitive world, it marked the
first steps in communication; today
it is only a provisional return to
conditions that are perhaps temporary.
The modern world is not so much a
ALBERTO MORAVIA, Italian novelist and
writer, is one of the great names of contem¬
porary world literature. His first book, "The
Time of Indifference" (1929), was written
when he was twenty years old. Since then
he has published some thirty novels and
volumes of short stories, a number of which
('The Woman of Rome', "The Conformist")
have been made into films. Globe-trotter
as well as writer, he has also published
studies on the U.S.S.R., India and the
People's Republic of China.
primitive world as one temporarily
"primitivized". In other words, even
in the progression from the language
of the picture to the language of the
printed word we can observe once
again the phenomenon of ontogenesis
(the development of the individual)
which duplicates the phenomenon of
phylogenesis (the development of the
whole human species).
That this hypothesis is plausible is
furthermore borne out by the huge
circulation of paperbacks. Between
the traditional book and the paperback
there is not just a difference of quality
and price. In reality, the two types
of books are profoundly different in
nature.
The traditional book was rooted,
indeed still is rooted, in an organic,
stratified cultural context that has
lasted for centuries. The paperback,
on the other hand, scatters the seeds
of the culture of all ages and all
regions wholesale upon completely
virgin soil. In the space of a few
years, the entire population of our
planet, only now barely emerging from
illiteracy, has been inundated, without
any preparation, with the culture of
thirty centuries.
The danger is that this culture
will be not assimilated, but thrown
together, condensed and reduced to
mere formulas and synthetic aggrega¬
tions in a vast grinding operation of
destruction. After which the masses
would apparently be free to revert
to the image, thenceforward the sole
medium of communication.
This, indeed, may be the direction
taken by marxism in China with its
rejection of the culture of the past as
"Bourgeois". Mao Tse Tung has said
that the vast masses of the Chinese
people are like a sheet of blank paper
on which one can write whatever one
wishes. What will be written on this
paper we still do not know.
Besides, the image itself has
recently appeared to be reaching its
limits. The fact that the spectator
takes in the picture passively, without
any effort of interpretation, ultimately
results in the picture itself losing its
full force and becoming a victim of this
passivity. People watching television
or a film at the cinema simply do not
see what is happening before their
eyes on the screen; or if they do see,
they do not really comprehend.
Passivity has atrophied their powers
of concentration, rendering them
inattentive to the point of blindness.
Of course, they "see" the road sign
indicating a school, or the cowboy
astride his horse firing his gun, but
now what they "see" is nothing more
than a response to the same con¬
ditioned reflex devoid of any mental
reflection and hence any communica¬
tion. Marshall McLuhan admits this
when he says that "the medium is the
message."
The decline of the book is by no
manner of means, then, a certainty.
Even if we ignore the fundamental fact
that the book springs from nature, that
is from the faculty natural to all human
beings to utter words and shape them
into organized speech, we should not
overlook the fact that the book is
made up of words which are "also",
under certain conditions of poetic
creativity, images. Thus there is no
substantial difference between the
image suggested by the book and the
image that appears on the screen. In
fact there is only one difference,
though an important one: the image
on the screen allows for no play of
imagination; it is what it is.
Nevertheless, we must distinguish
between one type of reading and
another type of reading, between one
book and another book. Reading
some books is no more than a simple
physical exercise. Such books,
written for mass consumption, con¬
ventional in content and in style, are
not read in the full sense of the word
but rather are skimmed through by
the reader: when the eye passes from
one ready-made phrase to the next,
from one cliché to another, the
"reader" may believe he has been
"reading" but in reality he has done
no more than register the notations of
a verbal mechanism that is as in¬
comprehensible as it is insignificant.
For a book to be properly "read"
it must first be really "written". If it
is true that the book is in decline this
is due not to the fact that the broad
general public does not read but to
the fact that they read books that have
not been "written" but merely printed.
A book, then, must be thought out
and created or it is not a book.
Indeed, the future of the book is bound
up with the poetry, creativeness,
descriptive power and imagery of the QQ
writing. The future of the book will ¿Q
be assured if we succeed in "writing-
books; it will perish if we content
ourselves with merely printing them.

build and destroy, ever critical, alert,
nonconformist, ever disposed to call
into question, has recently begun to
ask whether the book (and why not
consider its fantastic proliferation

adequate as an instrument for the pro¬
pagation of culture; whether it is not
destined to be replaced by more direct
means of information, with more im¬

all published by Knopf, New York, and

word; media whose speed in analyz¬
ing a case, a fact or a conflict is un¬
surpassable and whose immediate
actualization of an event can never be
matched by the printed word bound
in books and volumes.
Disturbing and arbitrary theories
have emerged because of this, support¬
ing the thesis that culturally, the
cinema, journalism, television, which
appear to tell us more in fifty minutes,
in an hour or an hour and a half, are
more powerful than the book, the
novel or the essay which, being the
result of six or seven years of work,
force us to read and meditate for
several days in the little time at our
disposal after daily occupations and
earning a living. "Voire", as Panurge
would have said, driving his sheep into
the immense sea of hypothesis.
However, the strait-laced censors
adopt a different position, criticizing
with surprising ignorance as novelty,
as a new phenomenon typical of the
evil spirit of the times in which we live,
the tastes of our century.
And to begin with the simplest in
order to proceed to more complex
matters, let us consider the lamenta¬
tions and the anathema, which mem¬
bers of the "Holy Office" of a certain
kind of culture utter against "comics",
those comic strips which our children
like so much and which we older peo¬
ple without children have also enjoyed
over the years.
This fashion for comic strips is
blamed for the fact that new genera¬
tions are abandoning reading. But
those who argue in this way too eas¬
ily forget that the spirit and technique
of the comic strip that is, the narra¬
tion of facts, by means of a succes¬
sion of images in anticipation of the
cinema was already perfectly dev¬
eloped in the codices of Mexico which
narrate, through a sequence of scenes
and figures, the conquest and the
events leading up to the twilight of
the Aztec Empire. They show us
how La Malinche was dressed and the
costume worn by Cortes. And what
is the beautiful Bayeux tapestry but
a chronicle of the Norman conquest
of England, using the figurative tech¬
niques of the comic strip?

It was the great Swiss humorist,
Rodolphe Toeppfer, who during the
last century initiated the comic strip
as we know it today with his Dr. Festus
(1840). In 1889-1893, the French writer
and illustrator Christophe followed
the road traced by Toeppfer with his
now classic Famille Fenouillard, and
also his Sapeur Camember (1890-
1896).
When I was a child, before the
First World War, there were a number
of mass-circulation children's news¬
papers in Paris: Le Petit Illustré, Le
Cri-Cri, L'Intrépide, La Semaine de
Suzette, L'Epatant with the unforget¬
table adventures of the Pieds Nickelés
by the humorist, Forton, which in time
also became a classic.
Contemporaneously English children
were following the tricks and tribula¬
tions of Buster Brown and his dog
(1902). And towards the year 1913, the
great Bud Fisher in the United States
invented those extraordinary charac¬
ters, Mutt and Jeff, who for more than
forty years figured in the pages of
newspapers, along with Bringing up
Father by George McManus, Popeye
of the energizing spinach, Tarzan, Terry
and the Pirates, Superman, Mandrake
the Magician, and his extraordinary
adventures all of which inspired a
new mythology which still draws us to
the pages of our newspapers.
But all this, Lord Censors of the
Holy Office of Culture, has not stop¬
ped the publication and re-publication,
the many translations of Tolstoy, of
Pirandello, Marcel Proust, James Joyce,
Thomas Mann, Hermann Broch (I
do not wish to prolong this extremely
facile ennumeration of great names)
whom the ordinary public of the
last century would have considered
"difficult" not to say unreadable.
Science fiction? It is a literary genre
which has always existed. Its class¬
ical writers include Luciano de Samo-
sata, the medieval author of a
Romance of Alexander (the Great) who
descends to the bottom of the sea in a
glass ball, Orlando Furioso who swims
across the ocean, Cyrano de Bergerac
with his trip to the moon. Swift, the
inexhaustible Swift, H. G. Wells whose
The First Men in the Moon, The War
of the Worlds, The Invisible Man, The
Island of Dr. Moreau were my intel¬
lectual sustenance at the age of
thirteen.
The serial? The novels of chivalry
were serial stories with Amadis de
Gaule in the vanguard; serials (and
good ones) were the works of Xavier
de Montepin, Emile Gaboriau, Eugene
Sue, at the beginning of the nineteenth
century, up to that super-serial (which
also has marvellous literary qualities)
Les Misérables, by Victor Hugo, the
first great best-seller of world litera¬
ture, a book that still has a vast public
in the whole Spanish-speaking world
to the point where the employees in
the Cuban cigar and cigarette facto¬
ries, who are read to while they work,
periodically request by popular acclaim
a new rendering of the story of Jean
Valjean.
The serial as we daily view it on
the television screen did not do the
slightest harm to the development of
Balzac's mighty work, nor did it hin¬
der the pre-surrealist poetic stirrings
of the older Victor Hugo, nor the slow,
universal and sure distribution of the
works of Baudelaire and Rimbaud.

REVERIES OF A READER (Continued)
After the unrivalled dominion of
Victor Hugo, author of Hernani, Emile
Zola was the second author of best¬
sellers in Europe before Tolstoy and
without forgetting Dickens the wide¬
spread popularity of whose works
came later. Nor should we forget that
whilst Zola's genius reaches its height
in Nana, in L'Assommoir and Germinal,
this great writer had begun his career
with books like Thérèse Raquin and
Les Mystères de Marseille which were
little different from the worst serial
now seen on the television screens of
the world.
And who was it who selected, made
immortal and caused the great and
authentic works of Zola to be trans¬
lated whilst ignoring the trivial and
superfluous? The reading public.
Similarly, the cinema public has
been able to forget the dreadful melo¬
dramas starring Francesca Bertini,
Gustavo Serena, ítala Almirante Man-
cini, Hesperia, etc., which Cines of
Rome and Ambrosio of Milan used to
give us at the beginning of the cen¬
tury, and to retain the unforgettably
great films (I refer to the mature
works) of a Chaplin.
The public has, in the end, develop¬
ed a critical sense which, while not
preventing them from appreciating the
informational, recreative and even the
instructive value of the mass media,
increasingly turns towards the "Book"
and I intentionally write Book with
a capital "B".
For the Book, despite the specula¬
tion and ridicule of those "distillers
of the fifth essence" as Rabelais
would have called them, continues to
flourish day by day; it is gaining more
ground and winning more readers.
One key fact which speaks for itself
demonstrates this and would convince
a child whose culture had not advanc¬
ed beyond Tarzan and Superman.
Publishing houses are growing in
number in an astonishing fashion
throughout the world.
And the publisher is a man who lives
and prospers on this strange, poor and
apparently unproductive merchandise
the book. Poor because its produc¬
tion implies long-term investment and
involves spending money on the pub¬
lication of a book by an unknown
author which, at best, will cover the
costs in one year or two (if ever).
In order to prosper, the publisher
must organize a distribution network,
look after publicity, and attempt to
impress on the unheeding passer-by
the title of a novel, a book of poetry
or essays his firm has produced. All
this implies a concern unknown to
other types of businessmen who sell
the public articles of everyday utility.
Reading is, in a certain sense, a
luxury. The book is bought with the
money left over when people have
spent what is needed to acquire every¬
thing else, that is, all their daily neces¬
sities.
Yet, let us consider publishing on a
world scale. We do not need to

most famous of the Mexican Codices,
tells the story of the conquest of
Mexico and the fall of the Aztec
empire in almost strip cartoon style.

1560, nearly half a century after the

mention France, Germany, England
and all the other countries which
have a long-standing tradition in
the field; but during my childhood,
publishing houses in Latin America
could almost be counted on the
fingers of the two hands. There were
printers, of course, who, in return for
a certain sum of money, published
(never more than 2,000 copies) books
that were either the work of eminent
professors or of well-known poets, or
of essayists whose names were
familiar from the newspapers.
When the edition was printed, the
author had to pick it up himself and
distribute it personally to the book¬
sellers where it was received with
reluctance if not with hostility ("All
right. Leave me a few copies, but I'm
not very hopeful...").
After all his labour and disappoint¬
ment, the writer was usually left with
a thousand or so unsold copies which
were stored in the cellar or the attic
of his home, sometimes consigned
to oblivion in rare cases, rediscover¬
ed because of the retrospective curi¬
osity of a later generation which sud¬
denly discovered a precursor in our
poor author who had already passed
on without further ado. (We make an
exception of the continental reputa¬
tion of Ruben Dario, but let us also
remind ourselves of how little the over¬
whelming greatness of Cesar Vallejo
was understood when he was still
among us.)
Moreover, the attitude of the public
all over the world has changed to¬
wards the book (I am not referring, of
course, to the developing countries
where one cannot speak of a reading
public for the simple reason that an
immense proportion of human beings
in such places cannot read or write).
Since each person draws his obser¬
vations and conclusions from some
personal experience, I recall my
father's and grandfather's generation
for they were, in their time, regarded
as highly cultivated people.
Of what did their education consist?
Of everything that was necessary in
order to exercise their professions
with decency and sometimes with real
talent. My grandfather was a lawyer,
my father an architect. They were up
to date in all that could be useful and
could increase their skill in their res¬
pective professions. But for the rest?
They were cultivated men, considered
to be extremely cultivated in the cul¬
tured circles in which they moved.
But of what did their culture consist?
In the humanities, they knew the
Greek, Latin and Medieval classics,
the writers of the great ages of Spain,
France and England, German roman¬
ticism, the literature of the nineteenth
century and of the contemporary
period.
In their conversation, they spoke in¬
telligently of Balzac, Flaubert, Zola,
Dostoevski, Tolstoy, Ibsen, Galdós,
Pió Baroja, Valle Inclán and, of cour¬
se, of poets and dramatists whose
names have, in many cases, fallen into
the most cruel oblivion.
They had some notion of philo¬
sophy. They knew a great deal about
history, especially Michelet. In other
fields, they had naturally read Darwin,
Haeckel, Le Bon, Renan, Taine, Emer¬
son, although they did so sporadically
and without any great diligence. For
the rest, they believed that philosophy
was better left to the philosophers (a
group of people whose activity is
rather difficult to define, if we agree
with the amusing essay of Raymond
Queneau); archaeology was for the
archaeologists, sociology for sociolo¬
gists, science for scientists.
. As for politics Ohl as for politics
sleight of hand is a "game for the
vulgar", my grandfather used to say.
Anatole France, aesthete with dilet¬
tante tastes in philosophy, politics and
everything, author of lives of saints in
which he did not believe, a real
touche-à-tout, as the French would
say, was, it should not be forgotten,
the master of a whole characteristic
generation of the time.
Let us look today into the windows
of a bookshop in Paris, London, Buen¬
os Aires, Mexico, Havana, or any¬
where. There, novels are displayed on
equal terms with books which deal
with the excavations of Sumer, Crete,
Mexico or Peru; everyone of my gen¬
eration has read Freud, Jung, Lacan
(and I shall keep the list brief); they
have read Marx, Engels, Gramsci,
Lukacs; there are books of philosophy
which in these recent years, have be¬
come true best-sellers; cybernetics,
science, the exploration of space (new
forms of science fiction but this time
with real men stepping onto the moon)
passionately interest a whole genera¬
tion.
There are more and more book
series; art books are now cheaper;
lives of composers, histories of music,
treatises on organography ad-usum
delphini (all with the appropriate
gramophone records), politics, contem¬
porary history, present-day sociology,
discoveries, the exploration of the
planet, structuralism, Levi-Strauss, and
so on (1).
The reading public grows larger,
more curious every day, with a grea¬
ter thirst for discovery, more power
of assimilation, with the desire to reach
regions which were yesterday unknown
to them. And because of this, one is
not surprised by the fact that pub-

media cannot replace that unrivalled
lonely meditation before the printed
pages which constitutes reading.
To this it might be objected that
there persists the terrible problem of
the developing countries in which
great masses of human beings can¬
not write their own names on a piece
of paper. But this is related to another
problem, that of intensive and massive
education which must begin at the
moment when the child speaks the
first words of its language.
And that problem is not solved by
publishing a greater or lesser number
of books, nor does the Divine Comedy
have any role in places where the pos¬
session of a handful of rice or a crumb
of bread is the immediate problem, a
problem whose tardy solution is a
motive for shame among the men of
our time. But that is a well-known
problem even though some people pur¬
posely and ignobly overlook it. Hence
the equation is not expressible in
terms of culture and reading but of
systems.
If there is hunger for books and
this is completely certain in the
developed countries, there exists near
at hand hunger of another kind which
necessarily excludes hunger for liter¬
ature.
And in the face of this fact, let us
not assume the absurd position of the
Proustian lady whose great concern
during the 1914-1918 war was that the
baker should deliver her morning crois¬
sants despite wartime rationing
croissants which were the decoration
and delight of a breakfast prudently
eaten before reading the newspaper
which might bring bad news of the
allied armies' position at the Front.

Y.V. LAKSHMANA RAO, of India, is Direc¬
tor of the Asian Mass Communication Re¬
search and Information Centre in Singapore.
A communications specialist, he was a mem¬
ber of Unesco's Division for the Development
of Mass Media from 1965 to 1969, and was
previously Deputy Director of the Press Ins¬
titute of India, in Delhi. He is the author

sota Press. 1966).
interest in its continuation; so also in
the media (of which the book is one)
as vehicles for passing on of stored
knowledge and new information to our
young people.
The question then is how best this
can be achieved, using the available
resources, the existing abilities and
the present state of knowledge itself
and the effectiveness of the various
media open to us. To a student of
mass communication, this is what the
question boils down to. Should we
necessarily have to choose between
the media? Or can we use the old
and the new side by side, as our
resources permit. Should we put all
our eggs in one basket, be it print
or electronic, or for that matter, our
greatest asset: oral communication
channels.
No scholar who has gone into the
question systematically has so far
suggested either the abandonment of
the old or the exclusive introduction
of the new, costs be damned. This
is as true of the developing countries
as of the developed where the print
media have had to contend with the
newer media for several decades.
Years of experience and research
in such societies have shown that the
media do not kill each other; they
cannot push each other out completely
but that, like the proverbial mother-in-
law and daughter-in-law, they learn to
live with each other and that by and
large they learn to live fairly comfort¬
ably if they are able to adapt to new
circumstances and indeed to take on
new roles of a complementary and
supplementary nature.
Whether in such a process the
book, for example, were to turn into
a "non-book" and television were to
become increasingly more informative
and instructional than it now is, so be
it. But we have no assurance as to
what might happen.
The realities of the developing

countries do not warrant the taking
of the risks inherent in hunches (and
perhaps fads), however accurate they
may eventually turn out to be. The
possibility of their being wrong is
not only much greater but the costs
of such an eventuality are too high
for the developing countries to bear.
This is not to deny that the newer
media can play a significant part in
the overall developmental efforts of
these countries. However, the re¬
sources that are likely to be available
for a long time to come will make it
imperative that within the context of
communication development the brunt
of the tasks of information storage
and retrieval will be borne by the print
media in such societies despite the
advent of electronic media and
computers.
The book will have to continue to
provide the information and know¬
ledge required by the average citizen
to take full part in the changes taking
place around him. This is especially
true for the younger people who are
the mainstay of the revolutions taking
place in the developing countries.
The communications revolution, un¬
fortunately, is not the only revolution
that is taking place in the developing
countries today. The revolutions that
the West went through political, in¬
dustrial, social and technological are
today occurring in the developing
societies all at once and all together.
These revolutions are having to be
handled by people with relatively less
experience and knowledge, and with
far greater urgency and with far
more limited resources. Added to this
is the fact that, in addition to their
own revolutions, they are confronted
with the technological and other
developments in the West, thanks to
the communications revolution.
To the extent that the events, the
ideas and the problems of the West
are impinging upon the developing
nations, the proposition that the
world is tending towards becoming a
"global village" may have some truth
in it. However, it is unrealistic to
believe that internationalism is just
round the corner. One would like to
believe that this indeed could be
true, but then we are confusing fancy
with fact.
In fact, it seems that one of the
essential needs of the developing
society, rightly or wrongly, is the
development of a sense of nationhood
as a prerequisite for nation-building.
The leadership in the developing
countries are now involved in inject¬
ing such a sense of nationhood in
the people, even while taking part
in the larger task of bringing about
the "global village" through participa¬
tion in international forums.
In the developing countries, one is
generally concerned with the very real
villages where most of the people are
illiterate, uninformed and lack the
basic skills necessary for development
and are unaware of the basic concepts
essential for modernization. Even the
young boys and girls in these villages
lack such skills.
In the cities, on the other hand, the
relatively more educated youth find
themselves in a state of limbo which
has led to a great deal of discomfort
for them and to the society of which
they are part. They have neither a
strong sense of nationhood nor do
they feel genuinely international.
The question before the leadership
is how to give youth that sense
of involvement that is necessary
before they can take their rightful
place in society. To be able to do
that, they should obviously be pro¬
vided with a good knowledge of that
society. They should know its history
and its culture.
If the media are going to play an
important part in such transmission of
information and knowledge, the ques¬
tion which has to be answered is
whether these countries are going to
depend on the media available to them
here and now or wait for the newer
media to get up to the state of read¬
iness which is essential before they
can meet the increasing needs of
these countries. _ .
We know that the nature of the A I
"transcript of society" has generally
moved from oral to print. The devel¬
oping countries are at this stage. They

are aware of the fact that the printed
transcript is available now. Also that
such transcript can enable the younger
generation in these countries to expose
themselves to the history and culture
of their own people even as the
generations before them.
The advantages of the print medium
and of books are too well known
to be taken up here at any length in
such a short discussion. Print can
provide the required knowledge at a
time when the young people are
ready for it and when they are in the
mood to expose themselves to such
transcripts. That time is now. In
a more specific sense, print media can
be "consumed" when a person wants
to and at the speed at which he is
able to learn. He can go back to it
if he needs to.
IT is also known that the
newer electronic media, because of the
very nature of their limitations, do not
have the advantages of freedom of ex¬
posure in time and to a lesser extent,
in space. At this stage in their devel¬
opment, the electronic media are also
not able to provide the depth necessary
for a fuller understanding of many of
the complicated techniques of society's
production processes or of society's
human problems.
The leadership is therefore not
willing to burn up its present advant¬
ages of the store of knowledge
available for transmission through
print because of the promised potential
of newer media whose ability to
transmit knowledge faster and more
effectively and "through all the
senses" remains to be tested and
to be proved beyond reasonable doubt,
especially when one takes into account
the tremendous costs involved.
It should also be noted that if the
age of print is being overtaken by the
age of the electronic media in the
advanced countries, in large parts of
the rest of the world, the age of print
has not lived its full life. It should
also be noted that these countries are
even today in the stage of "oral
culture" and still "tribalized". If the
problem of the developed countries
is to "re-tribalize" man, what of those
countries which have not been "de-
tribalized" in the first place?
We are talking of societies where
even young people are today un-
involved, non-participants and inactive
despite the existence of an "oral
culture" all around them a state of
affairs which has been described as
stemming from the evils of the print
age. Will the introduction of an
electronic age directly without further
recourse to print, bring about a
different form of "tribalization" which
will lead to involvement, participa¬
tion and action?
It is true that in the industrially
advanced countries, the advent of tele¬
vision and its spectacular rise on the
communications scene led to wide¬
spread conjecture that this must be
the final blow that would make the
book a relic of the past and return the
world to a speech and gesture civiliz¬
ation. But the initial impact and rise
of television soon settled down to a
more reasonable plateau and it
became obvious to most people that
the book would survive.
The age of print to which such
premature obituaries have been
written elsewhere has not had its full
span of life in the developing societies.
If and when it has completed its tasks
and is willing to hand over its res¬
ponsibilities to the newer media, these
societies will perhaps be willing to
accept the mortality of this medium.
Meanwhile, however, there are no
such signs of ageing; the book has
not even grown to its full potential
and right now those responsible for
its nurturing and for its development,
are busy with the problems connected
with the rearing of this "child". Many
of these people are in fact the relat¬
ively more educated young people
of these societies with their own
visions of the future. They are not
only the readers of the books, but
also the contributors. They are aware
that if they are to enlarge their own
sense of participation and involvement,
it is through the print media that
they can express themselves and that
they can multiply their messages to
a wider audience.
The electronic media cannot give
them these opportunities, because
they are limited by the very nature
of their transmission and also by the
controls to which they are invariably
subject. In the developing countries,
they are also invariably government
controlled and operated.
I HESE young people are
also aware of the fact that the know¬
ledge of their cultures as well of other
cultures is available to them in the
books in the libraries which are acces¬
sible to them and from which they can
more easily retrieve the particular in¬
formation they are looking for. Figures
on library usage conclusively prove
that the largest number of their users
are young people. This is only partly
the result of their immediate educ¬
ational needs.
Such evidence of consumption of
print is not confined to the developing
countries. Partly it is true that the
educational system and the age at
which the educational experience is
being gained within the formal
structure, do have a bearing on these
figures of media consumption.
But what is the alternative, es¬
pecially in the developing countries,
where print is by and large the only
available medium for information
retrieval? (We must also remember
that the leadership in many of these
societies is neither willing nor able
to throw its young generation on
the imported products of television
material produced in cultures vastly
different from their own, however
dedicated the leaders may be to the
achievement of that citizenship in the
"global village". The villages they
are immediately concerned with are
their own real villages in which young
people are growing up, often with
not even a sense of the "nation-
village").
f\ PART from exposure to the
printed medium in schools, libraries
and at home, these young people are
also active consumers of the electro¬
nic media where they are available.
They realize that the media are comple¬
mentary and supplementary to one
another, just as they know that their
fathers or their teachers may not be
the repositories of all wisdom. They
watch certain media at certain times
and go back and forth through all the
media that are available to them.
Unfortunately their choice is rel¬
atively limited in the countries they
live in. They have to supplement what
little they learn from one medium by
whatever is available in the other.
Today they find that while the audio¬
visual media are able to inform them
up to a point, they have to go to
the books to learn in depth and to
learn when they are in the mood.
Perhaps tomorrow they will be able
to get far more out of the audio-visual
media at the time and at the place
they happen to be in, but that is for
that uncertain tomorrow. Their prob¬
lems are today's problems just as
their parents' problems were yester¬
day's.
As far as these young people are
concerned, human channels of com¬
munication have existed since time
immemorial, the print media have also
existed since time immemorial, the
audio-visual media are today available
only to a lucky few and will perhaps
be available to more people in times
to come. The book, however, con¬
tinues to surround them and was
available yesterday, is available today
and will be available in all the
tomorrows.
They see no signs on the horizon
of the dawn of universal television
or of widespread usage of computers,
let alone the death of books.

Letters to the Editor
BOGOMIL SYMBOLISM
Sir,
With reference to your article on the
Bogomils ("The Stones with the Raised
Hands," May 1971), may I point out that
figures depicted in the same attitude
exist in paintings in the catacombs of
Rome, dating from the days of the early
Christian church. In particular, a woman
in prayer figures in a 4th century fresco
in the catacombs of Thrason and
another can be seen in the catacombs
of Priscilla. The latter is flanked by
two groups of smaller figures represent¬
ing members of the family, recalling the
group reproduced on your centre pages.
With regard to the Bogomil carvings
of stags, I wonder whether they are a
mystic symbol based on Psalm 42:
"As the hart panteth after the water of
the brooks, so panteth my soul after
Thee, O God."

CONTROVERSIAL QUESTIONS
Sir,
I am sixteen years old and find your
magazine interesting and full of ideas.
However, I wish you would devote
more space to controversial questions
such as the problem of drugs, youth's
place in society, the problems of immi¬
grants, the exploitation of casual
labourers, sex education and many
other subjects of immediate concern
to modern society and thus to the youth
of today.
I want the "Unesco Courier" to be
not a "passive" magazine, but one
which points the way for the younger
generation with all its doubts and
uncertainties.

PITTSBURGH'S ANTI-SMOKE
CAMPAIGN
It was pleasing to read in your July
1971 issue that Pittsburgh, U.S.A., has
made substantial progress in reducing
air pollution. But some of the favourable
changes would have been made whe¬
ther or not there was a smoke control
law. For example, railroads were alrea¬
dy converting from steam to diesel
because of economic reasons. More
importantly, there has been some back¬
sliding. In many cases, the electrically-
propelled trolley cars have been replac¬
ed by diesel buses.
Henry R. Korman
Washington, U.S.A.
While it is true that diesel and elec¬
tric locomotives have now ousted steam
because they have proved to be more
efficient and cheaper to run, this was
not the case in 1941 when the Pitts¬
burgh smoke abatement ordinance was
enacted. In 1943 there were nearly
43,000 steam locomotives and only
2,100 diesels in service in the United
States, and, in fact, the U.S. railroads
had more steam locomotives than dies-
els in service up until 1951. At first
the Pennsylvania Railroad, a major coal
haulier, opposed the Pittsburgh smoke
abatement ordinance, not only because
it feared a loss of revenue from coal
freight, but also because of the high
cost of converting coal-fired locomo¬
tives to diesels as compared with the
more normal process of phasing out.

ANSWERS TO RACISM
Sir.
Sincere congratulations on your issue
dealing with racism (November 1971).
Well illustrated and clearly and intelli¬
gibly presented, it will bring home the
problem to readers from every walk of
life. It ¡s a remarkable contribution to
the fight against racial prejudice and
discrimination, and its stimulating
message that all men are brothers will
make a deep and lasting impression on
youth.

'YOUR ENVIRONMENT'
Sir,
In our Spring 1971 issue of "Your
Environment" we put on record our
particular regard for the "Unesco Cour¬
ier" as a valuable source of environ¬
mental Information. Your July 1971 issue,
including the Menton message, was most
interesting, as was its striking cover.
It is reassurinq to see that a periodical
in which so many disparate interest
groups come together can yet speak
out strongly about problems which now
confront all of us together. Sectional
interests pale into insignificance by com¬
parison with the global environmental
crisis which threatens the entire fabric
of life on earth. A common commitment
to the wellbeing of our planet may yet
bring about the worldwide community
toward which we are striving, and
toward which we must all look for sur¬
vival and fulfilment.

TEACHING THE BLIND

You will be interested in hearing that
since the article about Touch & Learn

It seems that the interest in the new
methods of blind education is very
great. People are mostly interested

Machine, the geographic maps and my

FROM THEORY TO PRACTICE
Sir,
As a United States citizen teaching
in Canada, I am frequently impressed
by the subtle differences in pedagogy
which I have observed. In my opinion,
we Americans tend to assume that all
of the exciting and worthwhile educa¬
tional innovations must originate in the
States. My purpose in writing you this
letter is to call your attention to one
of the new ideas we are beginning to
export successfully to educators all
over the world.
"Elements" is a six-page newsletter
which distils the findings of recent and
significant educational research into a
concise form that is readable and
meaningful to elementary school
teachers and administrators. Each issue
highlights a specific area of instruction
at the elementary school level and the
articles contain many helpful sugges¬
tions to teachers for translating the best
of current theory into practice.
Willard F. Reese
Editorial Assistant
Alberta, Canada
"Elements" is published monthly, from
September to April, by the Department
of Elementary Education, University of
Alberta, Edmonton, 7, Alberta, Canada.
(One year's subscription: $2.50.)
UTOPIAN DREAM?
Sir,
I recently came by chance across
your issue of November 1970, in which
Mr. Philip Noel-Baker states in his
article on "The Arms Race"; "...if a
Treaty of General Disarmament had
been made by a compromise between
Kennedy's and Khruschev's draft trea¬
ties of 1962, the world would now enjoy
unbroken peace."
It Is true that, if men did not exist,
there would be no wars; but unfortuna¬
tely fortunately depending upon your
point of view men do exist and, almost
from the cradle, begin fighting tooth
and nail among themselves.
Please spare us from the inept "If
onlys" of Utopian dreamers.
Y. Chabrier
Colombes, France
LOVE OF CHILDREN
Sir,
I heartily support the reader who
proposed (June 1971 letters page), an
issue of the "Unesco Courier" stressing
the need for love of children. Such
an issue should tell of heroes and
heroines of all nationalities who,
throughout the ages, have shown their
love of little ones. One very good
example would be the Japanese lay-
priest, calligrapher and poet, Ryokan
San.

Margaret Mead awarded
Kalinga Prize
Dr. Margaret Mead, the noted American
anthropologist, has become the first woman
to be awarded the Kalinga Prize for the
popularization of science. It was presented
to her last month by M. René Maheu,
Director-General of Unesco. Dr. Mead is
the author of a number of widely-read
books, including "Coming of Age in
Samoa", based on her stay among the
Samoan people, "Male and Female",
"Culture and Commitment: A Study of the
Generation Gap", and "Rap on Race", a
dialogue with the American writer James
Baldwin. Unesco administers the £1,000
Kalinga Prize, awarded annually by an Inter¬
national jury. Previous winners have
included Louis de Broglie, Sir Julian Huxley,
Dr. Agusto PI Suner, Konrad Lorenz, Ber¬
trand Russell and Jagjit Singh.
Trade obstacles
to education
The United Nations Conference on Trade
and Development has asked Unesco to
make further studies on obstacles to inter¬
national trade in educational, scientific and
technical materials required by the develop¬
ing countries, including equipment needed
to set up national book publishing Industries.
In reporting on these trade problems,
Unesco will draw facts from surveys a
number of countries will carry out during
International Book Year.
Sweden & Unesco
aid Cuban industry
Sweden has given $2,280,000 for a joint
project with Unesco to aid Cuba's Industrial
development. The grant, together with
Unesco technical aid and equipment, will
enable the Cuban Government to set up a
technical Institute for Industrial electronics
that will train over 2,000 skilled workers
and technicians. The grant brings to more
than $12 million the aid given by Sweden
to various countries during the past
six years under Unesco's Funds-in-Trust
programme.
Mali's literacy pilot project
Well over 1,200 literacy training centres
attended by more than 40,000 farm workers
have been set up in Mali under the pilot
project in functional literacy, launched In
1966 with aid from Unesco and the United
Nations Development Programme. The
centres were built by the farm workers
themselves and are largely staffed by
volunteer instructors. The aim is open
2,500 centres for 100,000 farm workers.
1,000,000 African refugees
Over one million Africans have become
refugees as a result of upheavals in their
countries during the past decade. A
recently published United Nations paper¬
back, "As They Came in Africa", tells in
photo-story form what the Office of the
United Nations High Commissioner for
Refugees is doing to help these homeless
persons to build a new life. "As They
Came In Africa" Is available from all
bookshops, price $1.25 or local equivalent.
Instructional Science Journal
A new English language quarterly,
"Instructional Science", addressed to
educators, scientists, mass media experts
and all those concerned with the science
of instruction, will publish its first issue
next month. For further details and a free
