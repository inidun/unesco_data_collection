The UNESCO Courier • October-December 2017   |   3 
These events are evidence of 
an unprecedented development, 
which is also the result of UNESCO’s 
actions. The use of armed force is not 
sufficient to defeat a threat that thrives on 
ignorance and flawed readings of history. 
The battle against violent extremism is 
waged through culture and education. 
Lasting peace requires recourse to what 
the poet Aimé Césaire called “miraculous 
weapons” – education, culture and 
knowledge – which strengthen 
the defences of peace in the minds of 
each and every one.
It is in this spirit that UNESCO is 
seeking to raise public awareness of 
the values of tolerance and respect 
through creation. As Edouard Glissant 
(1928-2011), former Editor-in-Chief 
of the UNESCO Courier, pointed out, 
art has always served as a trigger for 
“the creative capacity of the individual 
and the community and [has] provided 
a mirror of identity”. Artistic creation is 
an initiation of intercultural dialogue, 
and building bridges amid the world’s 
rich cultural diversity. 
Many people, both young and 
not-so-young, want to transmit 
this discourse of peace, tolerance and 
respect for rights. The Unite4Heritage 
campaign (p. 11) that I launched in 2015, 
has since attracted a great many 
supporters across the world. The initiative 
has demonstrated its vitality in building 
peace, growing silently like the trees 
in a forest, even when our attention is 
focused on the tree that is being felled. 
Let us continue to invest in 
this “soft power” of UNESCO, and to 
continue to believe in the capacity 
of these “miraculous weapons” 
that humanity is forging patiently 
to establish lasting peace.

From the very start, UNESCO has actively 
campaigned to emphasize the essential 
role that culture plays in global peace. 
The development of modern conflicts 
confirms the increased need for this form 
of “soft power” today.
The repeated attacks on heritage in Iraq, 
Libya, Mali and Syria have shown the extent 
to which the protection of cultural heritage 
cannot be separated from the protection 
of human lives. Violent extremists do not 
target only the general public; they also 
target teachers, journalists, schools, 
and historical monuments in an attempt 
to undermine and disrupt the societies 
they wish to subjugate. 
In response, we must do more to integrate 
culture in our strategies for security 
and peace, as a means to build long-term 
resilience, resistance and cohesion. 
This is why UNESCO has intensified 
its emergency programmes and 
initiatives to counter violent extremism, 
while continuing its political advocacy. 
Several resolutions recently adopted 
by the United Nations Security Council 
represent a historic recognition of the 
importance of protecting heritage for 
public security, such as Resolutions 2199, 
2354 and 2347 (see p. 7). For the first 
time, a UN resolution, Resolution 2347, 
unanimously adopted on 24 March 2017, 
covers the range of threats to world 
heritage – affirming that its deliberate 
destruction constitutes a tactic of war, 
which calls for suitable responses.
The conviction by the International 
Criminal Court of the militant leader 
responsible for destroying the shrines 
of Timbuktu (Mali) – in the very first 
international tribunal entirely devoted to 
the destruction of cultural heritage – also 
marks a decisive step towards an end to 
impunity for these war crimes (see p. 18).

The UNESCO Courier • October-December 2017   |   7 
The number of armed conflicts has 
been escalating since the 1980s − first in 
Central Asia (Afghanistan), then in parts of 
the Middle  East (Iraq and Syria) and West 
Africa (Mali). These have led to an increase in 
the destruction of historic sites by terrorist 
groups and an explosion in the trafficking 
of cultural artefacts. The international 
community has responded actively to 
the destruction wreaked by ISIS, with a much 
wider range of instruments at its disposal 
− making it possible to enhance its protection 
of the cultural memory of humanity.
In 2017, the international community 
demonstrated that it was united in its political 
determination to protect cultural heritage. 
Resolution 2347 of the UN Security Council 
formally recognizes that the defence of 
cultural heritage is imperative for security.
It took a long time before the seeds of the idea 
of immunity for cultural property in times of 
war grew into a historic decision. This marks 
a new global consciousness of the role that 
culture plays in maintaining security.
The process began at the end of 
the nineteenth century, when fifteen 
European states met in Brussels (Belgium), 
on 27 July 1874, to examine the draft 
international agreement concerning 
the Laws and Customs of War. A month 
later, Article 8 of the Brussels Declaration 
stipulated that, in times of war, “All seizure 
or destruction of, or wilful damage to 
[…] historic monuments, works of art 
and science should be made the subject 
of legal proceedings by the competent 
authorities.”
Twenty-five years later, in 1899, 
on the initiative of Tsar Nicholas II of 
Russia, an international peace conference 
was held in the Netherlands, with the aim 
of revising the Declaration (which was 
never ratified) and adopting a Convention 
with Respect to the Laws and Customs 
of War on Land. 
by Catherine Fiankan-Bokonga 
On 24 March 2017, the United 
Nations Security Council 
unanimously adopted Resolution 
2347, relating to the protection 
of cultural heritage. This was 
an unprecedented victory! It has 
taken nearly a century and a half 
for the idea to mature. Then, 
over the past few years, progress 
was suddenly made. And 
a growing awareness of the role 
that cultural heritage can play 
in fostering security was born.

Conference pose on the steps of

Also known as the Hague Convention of 
1899, it considerably advanced international 
law and established the principle of the 
immunity of cultural property. According to 
Article 27 of the Convention (revised 
during the Second Hague Convention 
on 18 October 1907), “In sieges and 
bombardments all necessary steps must 
be taken to spare, as far as possible, 
buildings dedicated to religion, art, science, 
or charitable purposes, historic monuments, 
hospitals […], provided they are not being 
used at the time for military purposes. 
It is the duty of the besieged to indicate 
the presence of such buildings or places by 
distinctive and visible signs, which shall be 
notified to the enemy beforehand.” 
Three decades later, in 1935, the 
preamble of the Treaty on the Protection 
of Artistic and Scientific Institutions 
− a pan-American initiative also known as 
the Roerich Pact − formulated the idea that 
cultural property, which “form the cultural 
treasure of peoples” must “be respected and 
protected in time of war and in peace”.
Landmark conventions 
and decrees
A decisive step forward was taken 
after the Second World War. In 1948, 
the Netherlands proposed a new 
draft international text to UNESCO on 
the protection of cultural property in 
times of armed conflict. The Organization 
began the process of drafting a new 
international convention, which was 
adopted at The Hague in 1954. 
Safeguard and respect are the 
watchwords of the Hague Convention 
for the Protection of Cultural Property in 
the Event of Armed Conflict and its two 
Protocols (1954 and 1999). “Damage to 
cultural property belonging to any people 
whatsoever” is internationally recognized 
as “damage to the cultural heritage of all 
mankind”. The Convention also ensures 
“the granting of special protection” to 
“a limited number of refuges intended 
to shelter movable cultural property 
in the event of armed conflict, of centres 
containing monuments and other 
immovable cultural property of very great 
importance”. 
That same year, in 1954, Egypt decided 
to build the Aswan Dam, which would 
flood the Upper Nile Valley and a large 
number of 3000-year-old monuments 
of what was once Nubia. At the request 
of Egypt and Sudan, UNESCO launched 
an international campaign to safeguard 
these monuments – one of the most 
spectacular in the history of mankind, 
and which would last two decades, 
from 1960 to 1980. The Nubia Campaign 
was the starting point for the Convention 
concerning the Protection of the 
World Cultural and Natural Heritage, 
known as the 1972 Convention, 
and the establishment of the World 
Heritage List. This text provides for the 
inscription on the List of World Heritage 
in Danger of properties threatened with 
grave danger, including armed conflicts, 
which are imminent or have recently 
broken out.  
The spectacular Nubia Campaign,  
co-ordinated by UNESCO (1960 - 1980), 
was the inspiration for the idea of 
World Cultural Heritage.

It is essentially because of these texts 
and co-operation with UNESCO that 
the UN International Criminal Tribunal 
for the former Yugoslavia (ICTY) was 
able to sentence former Yugoslav naval 
officer, Miodrag Jokić, to seven years 
of imprisonment in 2004. This was 
the first-ever conviction for the deliberate 
destruction of cultural heritage. 
Under Jokić’s command, hundreds of 
mortars were fired, between the beginning 
of October and the end of December 1991, 
on the old town of Dubrovnik, which was 
inscribed the same year on the List of 
World Heritage in Danger.
Largely as a result of these conflicts, 
UNESCO and several States Parties 
re-examined the 1954 Convention and 
drafted the Second Protocol, adopted 
in 1999. This introduced a new system 
of heightened protection for cultural 
properties of very great importance, 
which should also be protected 
by adequate national legislation; with 
the capacity to punish serious violations 
of the Convention with appropriate 
sentences. Serious violations include 
theft, pillage, attacks or acts of vandalism 
against cultural property, especially those 
with heightened protection. 
More recently, in 2016, the International 
Criminal Court (ICC) found the Malian 
jihadist, Ahmad Al Faqi Al Mahdi, 
guilty of war crimes for the destruction 
in 2012 of ten religious sites in Timbuktu, 
while the city was under the control of 
Ansar Dine, a group suspected to have 
ties to al Qaeda. He was sentenced 
to nine years’ imprisonment. This was 
a historic judgement, as the destruction 
of cultural heritage had never before been 
considered a war crime (see p. 18). 
“Immediately after the destruction in 
2012, UNESCO alerted the international 
community and seized the International 
Criminal Court to ensure such crimes 
do not go unpunished,” explained 
Irina Bokova, Director-General of UNESCO. 
The Organization undertook a series 
of measures, ranging from providing 
the armed forces with topographical 
details, to the reconstruction of the 
mausoleums. For the first time in history, 
safeguarding the cultural heritage of 
a country was written into the mandate of 
a United Nations Mission (Resolution 2100). 
MINUSMA, the UN peacekeeping mission 
in Mali, was entrusted with “protecting 
from attack the cultural and historical sites 
in Mali, in collaboration with UNESCO”.

For the first time in history, a UN 
resolution covers the full range of 
threats to cultural heritage, without any 
geographical limitations and regardless 
of whether the perpetrators of the crimes 
are terrorist groups already on UN lists or 
belong to other armed groups. 
Born in Geneva (Switzerland) to 
a father from the Democratic Republic

2015, a turning point
The year 2015 marked a real turning 
point in the attitude of the international 
community to cultural heritage. 
In February that year, with the backing 
of UNESCO, some fifty countries adopted 
UN Security Council Resolution 2199 
(see p. 12), prohibiting trade in cultural 
property coming from Iraq and Syria. 
“This resolution acknowledges that 
cultural heritage stands on the frontline 
of conflicts today, and it should be placed 
at the frontline of security and political 
response to the crisis,” said Irina Bokova, 
at the time.
A month later in Baghdad (Iraq), 
convinced of the effectiveness of “soft 
power”, she launched Unite4Heritage, 
a global campaign on social media, 
uniting young people in the celebration 
and safeguarding of cultural heritage 
around the world. 
On 1 September 2015, the United Nations 
Institute for Training and Research 
(UNITAR) published satellite photos 
showing that ISIS jihadists had destroyed 
the Temple of Bel in Palmyra. The main 
building of this World Heritage site in 
Syria no longer exists! Soon after, Italy 
proposed the idea of creating the “Blue 
Helmets for Culture” to the UN General 
Assembly. In February 2016, Italy signed 
an agreement with UNESCO to create 
the world’s first emergency task force for 
culture, composed of civilian experts and 
the Italian carabinieri. 
The United Arab Emirates, together with 
France, have since held an international 
conference on protecting cultural 
heritage in times of armed conflicts, 
under the auspices of UNESCO. 
In December 2016, representatives from 
over forty countries met in Abu Dhabi to 
reaffirm their “common determination 
to safeguard the endangered cultural 
heritage of all peoples, against its 
destruction and illicit trafficking” and to 
recall the successive conventions since 
1899 that “require us to protect human 
life, as well as cultural property in times 
of armed conflict”.
For Irina Bokova, “a new cultural 
landscape” is being built, and “a new 
global awareness” is emerging, with 
the birth of “a new approach to 
protect culture for peace and security”. 
Her convictions were quickly confirmed 
by the unanimous adoption of Resolution 
2347 of the UN Security Council on 
24 March 2017.
This text includes two of the main 
operational outcomes of the 
international conference in Abu Dhabi 
− the creation of an international fund 
and the organization of a network of safe 
havens for endangered cultural property. 
It also highlights the links between the 
trafficking of cultural property and the 
financing of terrorist groups, and between 
terrorism and organized crime.

Unite4Heritage 
Mobilizing a global movement
Nour and Bayan, two sisters from Damascus who have fled the war in Syria, 
live in Paris today. Before the conflict, “cultural heritage touched every sense, 
from the feeling of old stone walls under your hands and the delicate scent of 
jasmine in the air, to the melodic call to prayer resonating in your ears,” they explain.
The story of these young women, who reflect their personal views on culture and 
heritage, is one among many others shared on Twitter by Unite4Heritage, a global 
movement launched by UNESCO in March 2015. It aims to mobilize young people to 
counter the propaganda of violent extremism through the innovative use of social 
media. The idea of the movement was triggered by unprecedented recent attacks on 
cultural heritage – by the jihadist destruction in Nimrud and Hatra, and the looting of 
the Mosul Museum in Iraq, in particular. 
A photo and story contest launched on Instagram and Facebook received more than 
10,000 entries from all over the world, including Syria – soon after it was launched, 
in July 2015. A few months later, the campaign started reaching nine million people 
every week, many of whom are young. They have appropriated Unite4Heritage as 
their own platform for the exchange of stories and ideas. In a very short time, it has 
become a global youth mass movement.
Providing an alternative narrative to the extremists’ speech, Unite4Heritage is 
part of “Empowering Youth to Build Peace”, UNESCO’s integrated Framework 
for Action. It is guided by the objective “to equip young women and men with 
knowledge, skills and values that empower them to live peaceful, constructive and 
productive lives, to engage as responsible global citizens and to be resilient to any 
form of abuse or manipulation, including radicalization and violent extremism”. 
According to Irina Bokova, UNESCO Director‑General, “We see the rise of a new 
generation of digital natives today… All too often, the internet can provide 
a powerful megaphone for violence”.
“We must harness the internet’s full potential for peace, to widen opportunities for 
dialogue and civic engagement, to nurture and take forward youth concerns and 
visions”, she emphasized.
At a time when irreplaceable 
cultural heritage sites and 
cultural expressions are 
increasingly under attack, 
Unite4Heritage brings 
together youth and civil 
society organizations, online 
communities and networks, 
policymakers, researchers, 
media professionals, social 
workers and other actors to 
tackle hate‑related issues 
that affect their societies 
and communities.

The cultural goods market is a grey 
market, where clean and dirty goods 
circulate together. While it is difficult to 
estimate the value of the illicit market, 
it is possible to get some idea of the scale. 
Speaking to the International Herald 
Tribune (15 February 2005), archaeologist 
John Russell estimated that between 
March 2003 and early 2005, 400,000 
to 600,000 antiquities may have been 
looted from Iraq, generating between 
$10 million and $20 million. 
Facts and figures on illicit trade are 
notoriously difficult to document, 
even in relation to “ordinary” organized 
crime in relatively stable environments. 
Such difficulties are multiplied in 
a conflict with myriad, shifting internal 
factions and changing external 
facilitators. They are multiplied even 
further in cases where the war and 
the war economy are so interdependent. 
There are literally dozens of specific, 
yet baseless, claims in relation to Syria 
and Iraq alone.
Even when there is documented 
evidence, it can be difficult to interpret. 
For example, as the United States Counter 
Threat Finance and Sanctions explained, 
on 15th May 2015, US Special Forces 
in Syria raided the base of Abu Sayyaf, 
the head of underground resources (oil, 
gas, minerals and antiquities) for ISIS. 
They recovered a number of receipts 
for antiquities that indicated a one-fifth 
(khums) tax of $265,000 on sales of $1.32 
million in Deir ez-Zor province within four 
months, which would probably mean 
taxes of around $800,000 on sales of an 
estimated $4 million in a year.
Curbing the spoils of war
by Samuel Hardy
Since the adoption of UN 
Security Council Resolution 
2199 in 2015, which calls for 
the prohibition of trade in 
cultural property from Iraq 
and Syria, efforts have been 
intensified to disrupt terrorist 
financing through the illicit 
trafficking of antiquities. 
A global movement launched 
by UNESCO urges Member 
States to introduce more 
stringent legislation.

This is a very limited sample, however. 
The availability and marketability of 
antiquities and other illicit revenue 
streams are specific to that region; 
and the people, materials and activities 
on which specific earnings were spent 
are unknown. Nonetheless, in an illicit 
economy as in a licit economy, all revenue 
streams support the taxing authorities.
Dismantling  
of trafficking routes
According to the INTERPOL National 
Central Bureau for Lebanon, trafficking 
of antiquities from Syria through 
Lebanon is an organized criminal 
endeavour, which has increased 
exponentially through the present war. 
Yet, in spite of its own challenges in terms 
of governance and security, Lebanon has 
been able to dismantle gang after gang, 
six in 2016 alone. Many more supply lines 
for illicit antiquities could be disrupted, 
if other transit and market countries took 
their responsibilities equally seriously.
There are a few similar successes, 
although they demonstrate the range of 
structures and mechanisms for conflict 
antiquities trafficking. Police in Germany 
caught a group who, between 2011 
and 2014, had been stealing cultural 
objects locally to support militant groups 
including Ahrar al-Sham, Junud al-Sham 
and ISIS in Syria. In 2014, the Civil Guard 
of Spain caught a group who had been 
trafficking antiquities from Egypt in order 
to finance jihadists.
Tragically, there are also notable 
failures. According to an ongoing 
investigation by Paris Match Belgique, 
initially published on 27 October 2016, 
Khalid el Bakraoui had been ransoming 
works of art stolen from the Museum Van 
Buuren in Belgium, to three insurance 
companies between 2013 and 2015, 
before his suicide bombing of the 
Maelbeek metro station in Brussels 
on 22 March 2016.
Restitutions
Contrary to denials that antiquities from 
Syria and Iraq are reaching the market, they 
have been intercepted in Bulgaria (in 2015), 
Hungary (in 2017), Slovenia (in 2016) and 
France (in 2016). Antiquities from the 
war-torn zones have also been intercepted, 
then released, and even advertised in the 
United Kingdom (in 2015), as revealed by 
archaeologists Mark Altaweel and David 
Gill in the Guardian (July 2015) and on 
Channel 4 (April 2016).
Although it is not reflected in public evidence, 
“several countries around Europe” alone 
have intercepted and repatriated antiquities, 
as the Director-General of Antiquities and 
Museums in Syria told Al-Masdar News 
(May 2017). At least 300 cultural objects 
seized between 2012 and 2014 have been 
repatriated to Syria, the Directorate-General 
of Antiquities in Lebanon informed 
the Daily Star (January 2017).

conquered by ISIS, when it was under 
the control of first the Free Syrian Army, 
and then the Syrian Arab Republic. 
Yet tens of thousands of genuine antiquities 
from Iraq and Syria (and modern fakes, 
forgeries and counterfeits) have been seized 
in the region and further afield since 2011 in 
the case of Syria, and 1990 in the case of Iraq.
An overwhelming majority of looted 
antiquities have not been restituted 
to Syria since 2011.

This may be due to the technical difficulty 
of attributing modern state ownership 
on the basis of ancient cultural style and 
the deliberate destruction of forensic 
evidence of the countries of origin by 
looters, smugglers, dealers and collectors. 
It could also be attributed to the legal 
difficulty of international relations in 
situations of non-recognition of state-like 
authorities, or to the political exploitation 
of cultural diplomacy. Iraq is still 
struggling to recover the antiquities 
that were looted during the crises that 
erupted in 1990 and 2003. 
Nothing new  
or unusual
To reduce the trafficking of conflict 
antiquities in the future, it is important 
to acknowledge the existence of similar 
trafficking in the past. The situation 
in Syria and Iraq is not unprecedented 
or unusual. In the early 1990s, the security 
services were laundering stolen art 
through antique shops in Yugoslavia. 
Right-wing paramilitaries were trafficking 
art in Colombia. By the end of the 1990s, 
the Liberation Tigers of Tamil Eelam 
were selling antiquities to finance their 
war in Sri Lanka. Around the same time, 
the Northern Alliance and the Taliban 
(which continues to operate today) 
and some years before that, jihadis 
and the mujahideen looted, smuggled 
and racketeered in art and artefacts in 
Afghanistan. In Lebanon too, during 
the civil war between 1975 and 1990, 
militias looted and exported antiquities.
The history of conflict antiquities 
trafficking as a state crime goes back at 
least a century-and-a-half. This included 
payment in kind for assassinations 
by the junta in Argentina; self-subsidy 
by the Communists in Bulgaria, or plunder 
by the Khmer Rouge in Cambodia.
Again and again, conflict antiquities have 
been supplied to, and consumed by local, 
regional and global markets. In some 
cases, it has happened without effective 
regulation by the market countries who 
created the demand and whose markets 
subsidized the conflict. In others, it has 
taken place with the complicity of states 
who facilitated the financing of proxies, 
allies and other convenient armed 
groups. It has even happened under 
the meticulous management of states.
Confronted with such evidence, 
it becomes impossible to maintain 
the reassuring myths that conflict 
financing through antiquities trafficking 
is not happening at all, that it is not 
making a difference to the development 
of those conflicts or that it can be 
suppressed with exceptional measures 
against particular organizations. The only 
way to constrict this kind of trafficking 
is through the policing and regulation of 
the conflict antiquities market.
Resolution 2199
In response to the terrorist violence of 
ISIS, al-Nusra Front (ANF) and others 
associated with al Qaeda (AQ), the United 
Nations Security Council passed 
Resolution 2199 in 2015. It consolidates 
financial sanctions on these groups, 
in order to restrict their violence by 
constricting their funding and spending, 
such as their income from looting, 
smuggling and otherwise profiteering off 
the illicit trade in cultural objects.
Reaffirming Resolution 1483 of 2003, 
which requires states to prohibit the trade 
or transfer of cultural goods suspected 
to have been illegally removed from Iraq 
(from 6 August 1990) and to facilitate 
the safe return of such objects to 
Iraq, Resolution 2199 replicates those 
legally-binding measures for cultural goods 
that are suspected to have been illegally 
removed from Syria since March 2011.
Since then, Resolution 2253, passed 
in 2015, has obliged states to report 
seizures of cultural objects from Iraq and 
Syria and the outcomes of proceedings 
against antiquities traffickers that finance 
ISIS, ANF, AQ and/or their associates. 
These targeted measures have been 
complemented by Resolution 2347 of 
2017 (see p. 7), which requests states 
to prohibit the trade or transfer of 
cultural goods from any zone of conflict 
or context of conflict.

The Mask of Gorgon is a sculpture stolen 
in 1996 from the ancient Roman site 
of Hippo Regius (Annaba) in Algeria 
and restituted by Tunisia in 2014. 
Several states claim to have taken action 
that contributes to the implementation 
of the UN Security Council Resolution 
2199. For example, Cyprus has revised 
procedures to facilitate law enforcement. 
Pakistan has worked to improve the 
capacity of law enforcement agents to 
fight illicit trafficking, by disseminating 
the International Council of Museums’ 
(ICOM) Emergency Red List of Syrian 
Cultural Objects at Risk. The Canadian, 
Czech, French, Macedonian (FYROM) 
and Pakistani authorities, among others, 
have also intensified customs controls.
Significant legislative efforts include 
Germany’s 2016 Act on the Protection 
of Cultural Property, which consolidates, 
implements and strengthens many 
instruments, notably universalizing the 
responsibility to observe due diligence 
in trading and retaining records of 
transactions. Following Germany’s 
model, the Council of Europe’s 2017 
Convention on Offences relating to 
Cultural Property, which is open to 
signature by any state, closes many 
common loopholes − for example, 
by criminalizing the import, acquisition 
and/or marketing of looted, stolen  
and/or illegally exported cultural objects. 
UNESCO fights 
against illicit 
trafficking 
of cultural heritage
To raise awareness of, and aid the fight 
against, the illicit trafficking of cultural 
property, UNESCO has organized 
forty workshops for more than 1000 
participants (between June 2012 and 
July 2017), with special attention to 
the emergency situations in Syria, Iraq, 
Mali, Libya and Yemen. 
Over the past five years, hundreds 
of heritage sites around the world 
have been affected by armed conflict. 
In the Arab States region alone, 
twenty‑two out of eighty‑two World 
Heritage sites are listed as in danger. 
UNESCO has been involved in the 
protection of Syrian heritage since 
the beginning of the crisis in 2011. 
In March 2014, it launched the 
Emergency Safeguarding of the Syrian 
Cultural Heritage project. Funded by 
the European Union, UNESCO has 
conducted various workshops under 
the project, to halt the ongoing loss 
of cultural heritage and support 
the country during its post‑conflict 
recovery. 
These efforts are complemented by 
capacity‑building training, organized 
for the benefit of Syrian stakeholders 
and those from neighbouring 
countries − Jordan, Lebanon and 
Turkey − in December 2017. 
UNESCO has also responded to the 
challenges of looting in Iraq, since 
the war began in 2003. It has raised 
awareness through various campaigns, 
specifically focused on monitoring 
and addressing illicit excavations, 
risk assessments and emergency 
contingency‑planning for museums.
Irina Bokova, Director‑General of 
UNESCO, recently launched an 
international online campaign in 
Baghdad, Iraq under the banner, 
Unite4heritage. The global 
movement, powered by UNESCO, 
was started in response to the recent 
unprecedented attacks on heritage 
and diversity around the world. 
The global campaign invites everyone 
to celebrate the places, objects and 
cultural traditions that make our world 
a rich and vibrant place. 
UNESCO has also produced thirteen 
awareness‑raising video clips for 
different regions of the world, with the 
objective of warning tourists to verify 
the origin of cultural objects before 
purchasing them. 
Since it is a lamented fact that cultural 
property offenders remain in business, 
the convention is also significant 
because it enables the disqualification 
of cultural property convicts from 
trading in cultural property.
Still, many of those states that have 
technically “done something”, have only 
reaffirmed or reiterated generic existing 
measures. UNESCO has been forced 
to reiterate its appeal to states to take 
even minimal practical measures, such 
as reporting seizures of cultural objects 
from conflict zones, while urging parties 
to the 1970 Convention on the Means 
of Prohibiting and Preventing the Illicit 
Import, Export and Transfer of Ownership 
of Cultural Property to implement 
resolutions 2199 and 2253 in law.

Zenaldo Coutinho, Mayor of Belém do Pará 
(Brazil), 1.5 million inhabitants. 
Belém is the first port of access to 
the Amazon, giving it an extraordinary 
cultural diversity. Culture helps 
communities to express their local 
identities and encourages dialogue. 
It stimulates intense interaction between 
socio-cultural groups and the local 
authorities, especially as Brazil is going 
through a dire ethical and economic crisis.
Brandi Harless, Mayor of Paducah, 
Kentucky, United States, 25,000 inhabitants.
Culture can be a mechanism for peace, 
specifically in the US at a time when 
our politics are very divisive. I am in a city 
of non-partisanship where we are all on 
the same level. We talk about city issues 
rather than partisan political issues.
Culture is our foundation, and we all 
resonate with it. We are known for our 
quilt-making, and have the National Quilt 
Museum. About fifteen years ago, we had 
a decrepit neighbourhood that needed to 
be revitalized. The city offered houses to 
artists for $1, which they had to renovate, 
and include an art studio. This attracted 
about fifty artists, providing a new creative 
environment that we didn’t have before.
Marc Chassaubéné, Deputy Mayor of  
Saint-Étienne (France), 170,000 inhabitants.
Artists have been working a lot with the 
people of Saint-Étienne. Jordan Seiler from 
the United States, for example, is looking 
at urban advertising with residents. He has 
invented the “NO AD” app, which displays 
a work of art on a screen when you put 
your smartphone or tablet up against 
an advertising display. Getting everyone 
− from the mayor to a child from a 
working-class neighbourhood − to work 
on the same art project, is an ideal way 
to nurture ideas of equality.
Interviews by Lucía Iglesias Kuntz 
When mayors of the UNESCO 
Creative Cities Network (UCCN) 
got together from 30 June to 
2 July 2017 in Enghien‑les‑Bains 
(France) for their XIth Annual 
Meeting, they put culture 
at the top of their agenda. 
This included respecting and 
appreciating the cultures of 
the different communities 
living in their cities, involving 
artists and citizens in joint 
projects, and fostering dialogue 
between communities – in other 
words, recognizing the role 
of culture as a factor in urban 
development that is inclusive 
and reassuring.  
At the meeting, the mayors 
adopted a new strategic 
framework and called on 
cities in the network to do 
more to integrate culture 
and participation in their 
policies. Mayors from Brazil 
to New Zealand all agreed that 
culture helps communities live 
together harmoniously.
Culture:  
giving cities a human face 
Asaad Zoghaib, Mayor of Zahlé, Lebanon, 
150,000 inhabitants.
I think the most important thing to 
have culturally, in a country like ours, 
is public awareness − when people know 
themselves, and recognize the rights 
of others. Our city is working on building 
public awareness, transparency and 
accountability.
Dave Cull, mayor of Dunedin, New Zealand, 
125,000 inhabitants.
New Zealand’s first inhabitants, 
the Maōri, lost their land to colonizers 
in the nineteenth century. We are 
now going through a healing process, 
where they are being compensated, 
and getting back their pride.
Today, my city is a refugee resettlement 
destination for Syrian refugees 
− we have taken in 200 so far. One way 
of using culture to achieve peace is to 
accept more diversity − to respect and 
to commemorate the cultures that make 
your community what it is.

The UNESCO Courier visited 
Al Mahdi at the ICC Detention 
Centre in The Hague, Netherlands, 
and traced his journey – from his 
childhood in the desert of northern 
Mali, to his wanderings with 
his family in the Tuareg refugee 
camps of Mauritania and Algeria; 
his enrollment in the Libyan army, 
and his return to his home country, 
Mali. Here, he settled in Timbuktu, 
where he found the answer to his 
quest for stability and recognition 
– until rebellion broke out in the 
north of the country.
Having acknowledged the acts 
he was accused of, and for which 
he has admitted responsibility 
by pleading guilty, Al Mahdi 
goes beyond his own life story 
in this exclusive interview. 
He describes the complex 
social and cultural situation in 
northern Mali, where tensions 
and conflict have fermented for 
over fifty years. Here, radical 
independence movements 
with Islamic leanings 
continue to jostle alongside 
international jihadism.
Ahmad Al Mahdi and his lawyer, 
Mohamed Aouini on 17 August 2017, 
after the ICC had issued its ruling on the 
compensation for victims.
Ahmad Al Faqi Al Mahdi: 
I plead guilty
Interview by Anissa Barrak
Ahmad Al Faqi Al Mahdi was 
convicted of the war crime of 
having deliberately directed 
the attacks that, in June and 
July 2012, led to the destruction 
of ten religious and historical 
monuments in Timbuktu (Mali), 
a World Heritage site since 1988. 
This is the first time that the 
International Criminal Court (ICC) 
has been requested – in this case, 
by the State of Mali – to pass 
judgement on the destruction of 
cultural monuments, and the first 
time that it has categorized 
such acts as war crimes. 
On 27 September 2016, the ICC 
sentenced Al Mahdi, who was 
arrested in 2015, to nine years’ 
imprisonment. On 17 August 
2017, the court demanded that 
he pay €2.7 million to the victims 
as compensation.
What led this Malian teacher from 
the Tuareg Azawad tribe to turn 
against his compatriots and those 
who share his own faith? After all, 
having moved to Timbuktu in 2006, 
he had become a valued member 
of the community. How did an 
educated man, who had been 
taught the precepts of the Sufi 
tradition of Islam, come to commit 
such a crime against this same 
school of Islam? What prompted 
this shift towards radical political 
Islamism and violence? Where did 
the rupture occur?

Who took the decision on the 
destruction? Did you approve of it?
It was one of my duties to combat practices 
considered to be contrary to the precepts 
of Islam. With my soldiers, I personally 
scrutinized the behaviour of the people. 
I regularly visited the mausoleums, 
giving explanations and advice. I also 
preached the teachings on local radio. 
The order to destroy came from high 
up, from the commander of Ansar Dine, 
Iyad Ag Ghali, who made the decision on 
the recommendation of his entourage, 
notably the AQIM advisers. The aim of 
these groups is to impose their ideology on 
the people, which is derived from Wahhabi 
doctrine. In strategic terms, al Qaeda seeks 
to increase its visibility through spectacular 
actions in order to attract new adherents 
and provide the parties that support it 
with proof of its zeal and efficacy.
During his trial at the ICC on 
27 September 2016, Ahmad Al Mahdi 
appealed to “all the world’s Muslims 
never to carry out this kind of action, 
which has such terrible consequences, 
is unjustified and cannot yield 
any benefits.”
You have acknowledged your role in 
the attack and destruction of nine 
mausoleums and part of the Sidi Yahia 
mosque in Timbuktu in 2012, which 
you yourself organized and led. In what 
capacity did you act and why?
At the time, I was head of Hesba, one of the 
four command structures of the Ansar Dine 
group, which was linked to al Qaeda in the 
Islamic Maghreb (AQIM) and had occupied 
northern Mali in 2012. It had set up 
its headquarters in Timbuktu in April that 
year, having routed fighters of the National 
Movement for the Liberation of Azawad 
(known by its French acronym, MNLA).
It fell to Hesba – whose mission was 
to “promote virtue and prevent vice” 
– to combat all acts that, in its eyes, 
contravened the precepts of Islam. Hesba 
considered the mausoleums of Timbuktu 
to be the incarnation of such acts for two 
reasons – first, because the way that the 
faithful prayed was judged to be impious; 
and second, because of the buildings that 
had been constructed over the tombs. 
Once the leadership took the decision to 
destroy the mausoleums, I received the 
order to carry out the task, using troops 
placed under my command. I applied 
myself to the task rigorously, as with 
everything I do.

The majority of the population of 
Timbuktu was obliged to deal with these 
groups in order to survive. And I was 
more zealous than the others.
When carrying out the destruction, were 
you ever overcome by doubt? What was 
going through your mind?
I saw myself as a link in the chain 
of command and felt that the 
consequences should be the 
responsibility of those who made the 
decision and gave the orders. I knew all 
too well that if I did not carry out the 
orders, I would be dismissed. I didn’t 
receive any pay, but the group provided 
for all the needs of my family.
At the same time, I was aware of what 
the people were feeling. I knew the 
sites were historic and sacred. I visited 
the mausoleums just like the other 
residents of Timbuktu, but for my own 
reasons. In general, I feel that we have a 
duty to visit cemeteries – whether the 
graves are ordinary or have a mausoleum 
over them – because all the dead are 
equal in my eyes. I know the history of 
most of the saints who have given their 
names to the mausoleums, having read 
about it in the scriptures. These were 
wise and good men, whose good deeds 
shine wherever they are, even after 
their death. The Prophet recommended 
putting graves together in cemeteries so 
as not to abandon the dead in solitude 
and isolation.
Then there is the question of 
supplications. I reject the idea of asking 
a dead person to intercede with God on 
my behalf. Many rumours were going 
around about this: some claimed that 
the graves in these mausoleums were 
empty, while others insisted that Hassan 
and Hussein, the Prophet’s grandsons, 
were buried there, which is completely 
untrue. I believed that the mausoleums 
were built to take advantage of 
people’s naïveté. So, while  I knew that 
the destruction of the mausoleums had 
no basis in Sharia law, I did not see any 
objection to putting an end to these 
myths and destroying the buildings. 
However, I was totally opposed to 
any interventions in the interior of 
the mosque.

In the discussion session that led to 
the decision to destroy the monuments, 
I openly said that I thought such an action 
was not appropriate, since it could cause 
more harm than good. I reminded them 
of the Sharia ruling that says that no vice 
may be suppressed if its suppression 
leads to another equal or greater vice. 
I warned them that the destruction could 
lead to greater misfortune for the people. 
I was thinking, in particular, that it might 
incite hatred among the local people. 
I imagined armed groups firing on them. 
I feared the worst.
I was convinced that the destruction of 
the mausoleums had no legal basis in 
Sharia law. It’s true that, according to 
a fatwa recognized by all traditions of 
Islam, tombs must not be erected more 
than one chibr (about ten centimetres) 
above ground. But this fatwa only 
applies to new tombs and not to those 
that already exist. I wanted to leave the 
mausoleums intact.

How did you gain the knowledge of 
Muslim theology that would qualify 
you to interpret the scriptures?
I have an eclectic background. As a child, 
I studied in the Koranic schools in 
my region, Agouni, near Timbuktu. 
My father taught me the Maliki Sufi 
doctrine, and then I continued by 
reading the books that the sheikhs 
gave me. By the time I was 12, I had 
learned the Koran and the exegesis 
– I had acquired a level of knowledge 
that allowed me to become an imam.
During my meanderings with my family 
from 1993 onwards – between the 
Tuareg refugee camps in Mauritania, 
and our exile in Libya and Algeria, 
with occasional returns to Mali – I read 
all the books I could find and struggled 
very hard to obtain qualifications 
recognized by the state, so that I could 
get a steady job. My ambition was to 
become a teacher. During our exile 
in Libya between 1996 and 2001, 
after the beginning of ethnic tensions 
and the quashing of the armed Tuareg 
uprisings, I studied for and obtained 
the certificate of primary education, 
but under a borrowed name, as I was 
never officially registered. 
Sharia has never called on 
the faithful to stick rigidly to rules 
that were made in ancient times, 
or to transpose them to the letter, 
to another time and place

It was with this certificate and under 
a false name that I enlisted in the Libyan 
army, where I served for four years 
and rose to the rank of officer. I had to 
earn a living and provide for my family, 
because my father had chosen to stay 
in the camps in Mauritania. During this 
entire time, I never stopped reading and 
learning on my own.
Seeing that there could be no future for 
me if I stayed where I was, I decided to 
return to Mali and settled in Timbuktu 
in 2006, where I started preaching in 
the mosques. I also set up a private 
educational organization to build the 
capacities of teachers of the Koran, 
which I directed for six years. I was 
actively involved in several religious 
and cultural youth associations, 
which performed a range of activities like 
cleaning the streets, and donating blood. 
This was a period of relative stability.
I couldn’t advance in my career because 
of this diploma, which was not in my 
name. So I had to start again from scratch, 
to obtain the certificate. This enabled 
me to attend the Pedagogical Institute 
in Timbuktu, where I received a diploma 
in educational psychology and was then 
able to pass the civil service exam. I finally 
obtained a position as head teacher in the 
east of Timbuktu. This was in 2010. I was 
working there when the rebels occupied 
the north in 2012.
Under what circumstances did you join 
the ranks of the rebels?
When the rebel troops invaded northern 
Mali, the people started to flee and seek 
refuge in Mauritania. They were afraid 
of abuse by the Malian army, which had 
happened with every rebel uprising. 
It was terror. I was considering asking to 
be sent somewhere in the interior of the 
country, when I learned that members 
of my tribe had been victims of abuse 
by the people of Bamako. They had 
been threatened and attacked and 
their pharmacy burned down, even 
though they had never lived in the 
north of the country. They were born 
and raised in the capital and were loyal 
and well-integrated.
So I decided to leave the country for 
Algeria, as I saw no other way to escape 
the inter-tribal racism. In fact, this racism 
was not an aspect of Malian state policy, 
but came from the people themselves, 
who believed that fair-skinned people 
were intruders from Arab countries. 
Historically, this is true – people from 
Arab countries did settle in Mali, but that 
was 400 years ago! That is why I was 
in Algeria when the rebels invaded 
Timbuktu in April 2012. I then decided 
to go back and take up my old job and 
help to manage the region.
Was this your first contact with Ansar 
Dine and al Qaeda? Why did you feel 
closer to them than to the people of Mali? 
At first, it was the MNLA rebels 
who occupied the region around 
Timbuktu. I had always supported this 
movement in its efforts to find justice 
for the Azawad tribe, to which I belong. 
But when I arrived in Timbuktu, Ansar 
Dine had already chased out the MNLA 
fighters. I knew Iyad Ag Ghali, the leader 
of Ansar Dine, from the time when 
he was commander of the Azawad 
rebellion. I admired him.

Restoring trust will take 
longer than rebuilding 
the mausoleums
A few days later, Ag Ghali invited 
me to a  meeting with imams from 
the mosques and other prominent city 
figures. He arrived, accompanied by 
a group from al Qaeda. I was impressed 
by his speech and convinced by 
his ideas. I joined his movement right 
away. I was already aware of the Wahhabi 
teachings through the Saudi charities 
that were active in Timbuktu. One of 
them invited me on a pilgrimage to 
Mecca in 2006, after which I adopted 
the Wahhabi doctrine.
You have apologized to the inhabitants 
of Timbuktu, the citizens of Mali, and 
the descendants of the Saints. Do you 
think that acknowledging your deeds 
and conveying your regrets have been 
enough to gain their forgiveness?
Certainly not. My repentance is 
something personal, coming from 
the bottom of my heart. But I can 
only prove my sincerity by carrying 
out acts of reparation, when I get out 
of prison. UNESCO has ensured the 
reconstruction of the mausoleums, 
which is a remarkable achievement. 
But restoring trust will take longer than 
rebuilding the mausoleums. I have 
caused injury to the entire population, 
in all its diversity – whether Fula, 
Songhai, Tuareg or Arab. I hope that 
they will accept the hand that I am 
offering them to follow the path 
towards reconciliation. I want to write 
a memoir for them, which can restore 
their dignity and at the same time help 
protect the mausoleums.
When I have finished my sentence, 
I want to return to society and work 
towards restoring national harmony. 
The situation is even more urgent today, 
after the damage created by Ansar Dine 
and al Qaeda and the accumulated 
failures of the Azawad rebellion. It pains 
me to see the refugees confined in 
camps in Mauritania, Algeria, Libya and 
Burkina Faso. They will not be able to 
return to their homes unless there is 
national reconciliation.

“A model trial”, says lawyer Kassongo 
Three years after they were destroyed in 2012, the mausoleums of Timbuktu, 
a spiritual centre in Mali and a World Cultural Heritage site, have been rebuilt 
exactly as they were. Carried out in record time under the auspices of UNESCO, 
the reconstruction used local skilled craftsmen, who, from father to son, 
have preserved the traditional techniques of masonry so that they could 
continue to maintain the mausoleums. While some manuscripts were burned 
during the attacks, the majority of these historical treasures were preserved 
by residents of Timbuktu, who acted on the reflex to hide them when armed 
militants invaded the city.
 For Mayombo Kassongo, the Legal Representative of the Victims in the trial of 
Ahmad Al Faqi Al Mahdi in the International Criminal Court, the restoration of 
the mausoleums illustrated “the political will of the Malian government and 
the international community to demonstrate their resolve and to give the people 
new hope”. But, he insists, “repairing the trauma and the material damage caused 
will need a lot more time”.
 While for most of the 137 complainants the damages were mainly material 
– especially for those who lived in these buildings and depended on them for 
their livelihood – all the residents of Timbuktu have been affected by the spiritual 
and psychological damage caused by the attacks. The direct and indirect victims 
have not all appealed to the law, but the Court has taken them into account 
in the right to compensation, set at €2.7 million. As Al Mahdi was without means, 
a trust fund has been set up for the victims so that the required restoration work 
may be completed, and for which an implementation plan is to be submitted to 
the Court by February 2018.
Kassongo confirmed that none of the victims have accepted Al Mahdi’s excuses 
or granted him his request for forgiveness. “The wound is still open and will take 
a long time to heal.. Asking for their forgiveness at this time is like turning a knife 
in the wound.”
 “What it is important to take away from this model trial,” adds Kassongo, 
“is the hope that it may have a deterrent effect on young people who might 
be tempted to enlist in  extremist groups and be seduced by violence. 
The judgement was severe, the sentence was heavy, and the amount of 
compensation was considerable. That should be a lesson to them.”
Radical ideologies using Islam are 
attracting a lot of young people, as was 
the case for you. Based on what you have 
learned from this episode in your life, 
what can you do to protect them from 
these influences?
I think that Muslim countries should 
be governed according to the precepts 
of Islam, which have both a religious 
and a political dimension. Sharia has 
defined general values that are valid 
for all time, everywhere. These general 
values, which are derived from the 
sacred texts of the Koran and the words 
of the Prophet, make it possible to pass 
laws that are adapted to new contexts. 
Sharia has never called on the faithful to 
stick rigidly to rules that were made in 
ancient times, or to transpose them to 
the letter, to another time and place.
Islam demands a very high level of 
mastery of Sharia before a person can 
hold political office. I was very saddened 
and disappointed to discover that 
there was no one in the groups I joined 
who had a greater understanding of 
Sharia than I had, even though I was 
just a simple and modest student of 
the subject. How could I believe in the 
capacity of these organizations to found 
a  stable and strong state?
Having said this, I advise young people to 
concentrate on themselves, their ambitions, 
their country and their religion. Religion is 
a personal practice. Faith, trust and 
hope are the mainstays of a healthy and 
responsible youth, which is able to see for 
itself that there is no point in joining radical 
Islamic groups.
It does young people no justice to view 
them as a flock of ignorant sheep that 
need to be led. It is up to me to see in 
them a human treasure that is potentially 
mature and full of wisdom. If I present 
my vision to them, they will be able to 
decide which parts they find useful. 
This – with respect – is how I intend to 
behave with them, and with all others. 
Just as I reserve the right to criticize them, 
and others.
Mayombo Kassongo, the Legal 
Representative of the Victims, considers that 
the Al Mahdi trial was exemplary.

What made you decide to make the film, 
Jihad: A Story of the Others?
I come from a Muslim background myself, 
and have to deal with the consequences 
of the growing religious fundamentalism 
within our communities. I was very 
invested in trying to understand why this 
movement is becoming increasingly violent 
and why it is consuming more and more 
of our young people. I was unsatisfied 
by the conversation that we are having 
around jihadism. It is easy to hate the men 
who are a part of this, but not particularly 
productive. I wanted to make a film about 
what it is like to be that person attracted 
to jihad. And I learned that I had a lot in 
common with them. 
The realization that I could recognize myself 
in a lot of their issues scared me more than 
anything else. But we are separate in how we 
deal with these issues: these men chose to 
pick up a gun, I choose to pick up a camera.

The people you interviewed are all former 
jihadists. How did you gain access to them? 
It took a really long time to build trust, 
and about two years to make the film, 
which I finished in 2015. The best way 
to gain trust is to be persistent and 
honest about what you’re trying to do. 
I constantly told them: “I do not agree 
with you, I do not even like you (but I do 
now). I just want to listen, to understand, 
for you to share your stories with me.” 
Many appointments were set up and 
cancelled; some of them would choose 
not to talk or asked me to turn off the 
camera. Some of them wanted me to lose 
hope, but I kept coming back, because 
I really wanted to know. 
What prompted them to abandon jihad?
For one of the main characters, it was 
a matter of realizing that what he had 
believed, was not true. He thought 
he was fighting for Muslims, and for 
a better world and then he realized 
he was becoming just another oppressor. 
For many of them, it was recognizing 
the fact that there were hypocrisies and 
double standards in the world-view 
that they had created for themselves. 
Another factor was that people who they 
(the jihadis) considered to be the enemy, 
starting treating them like human 
beings. The minute you start connecting 
to your humanity, it’s different.
You said that you didn’t like these men 
at first, and now you do. What made you 
change your mind? 
A lot of the young people who are drawn 
to jihad are actually initially creatively 
inclined, and because that is somehow 
stinted, it bursts out as violence. I did not 
expect to hear that an overwhelming 
majority of the men I spoke to − on and off 
camera − said they would like to be 
rappers or poets or painters. But they 
couldn’t do it because their families 
would not let them or their societies 
did not accept it. That hurts me very 
much, because that, we could have done 
something about. We are all responsible 
for what is happening to our youth.
When you say we are all responsible, 
are you referring to family, schools, 
governments, or the international 
community?
I mean all of us as individuals, how we 
respond to people in our everyday 
lives. When a young Muslim boy comes 
and sits next to us on a bus, it matters 
how we look at him, how we hold our 
purse. Similarly, when our politicians or 
governments speak about these topics 
from a very hateful place, defining their 
own citizens as monsters, it makes it very 
difficult to engage with these monsters, 
and maybe allow for the chance for them 
to become human.

As for families, they must recognize that 
they are betraying their children when 
they put unmanageable expectations on 
them. Their children are only human.
I think our schools, our police, our media, 
all have a responsibility when our young 
women or men come to them for help, 
whatever their culture, background or 
race. It is all about human interaction. 
Whether we are artists, activists, 
feminists, anything, we all have 
an obligation to stand up.
Is that the reason you founded sister‑hood, 
the online magazine, and series of live 
events? What made you venture into the 
media? 
Yes, sister-hood was founded in 2016, and 
works through civil society and media 
channels. It is an international platform 
where the woman of Muslim heritage 
is at the centre. Everybody talks about 
Muslim women, but rarely do we actually 
talk to them. 
I wanted to start creating work that 
refocused our attention on what it is 
like to be that girl who is suffering, 
that man who is wanting to go out 
and fight in Syria. 
The response and the community-
building between the women has been 
amazing − we now have nearly 200 
writers from forty countries. I realize 
the importance of women telling their 
own stories, whoever they are. Exposing 
oppression is only half the story. I deeply 
respect journalism as a profession, 
but I am frustrated by the incomplete 
stories that we continue to tell in the 
media. We talk about honour killings, 
about violence against women, but we 
forget the person. In everything I do, I am 
trying to turn up the volume of the voices 
of the people who are already there.

In 2012, you made the documentary, 
Banaz: A Love Story, about a young British 
Kurdish woman who was killed by her own 
family for choosing a life for herself. Why 
did you focus on just her story?
I wanted to make a film on “honour” 
violence and I was going to tell two 
or three stories − including Banaz’s 
– which was a terrible failure of 
the police in the United Kingdom.
Banaz approached the police five times 
for help, but was ignored. 
I changed my mind when I met 
the policewoman who investigated 
her murder. I asked her why she fought 
so hard for this case (she got the uncle 
and father convicted in the UK, and then 
went to Iraq and worked to extradite 
two cousins implicated in the murder, 
to the UK), and she replied: “I did it 
because I love her.” 
I could not understand how she could 
love a girl she had never met, who was 
dead, but she said: “Everyone should 
be loved. She should have been loved. 
The people who were closest to her did 
not love her. So I loved her and still do.”

I remember thinking: “This is the film 
I want to make!” And Banaz was born. 
Banaz’s story includes all the problems 
and all the solutions. And the solution to 
this problem is that we have to care.
Could you tell us about your 2016 film, 
Islam’s Non‑Believers?
The film is about an underground 
resistance movement of young people 
who have decided to leave Islam. 
Very often, ISIS and terrorism are forcing 
them to re-examine their faith. When 
I made Jihad, I was contacted by a lot 
of young people from Iraq, Syria, and 
other countries, who said to me: “There is 
a different movement also happening: 
there are a lot of young people who are 
leaving Islam. Why don’t you speak about 
us? Is it because we do not use violence?” 
When I started looking into this, I was 
shocked. I discovered that there are 
between 4 million and 15 million 
non-believers in Pakistan; between 
1.4 million and 6 million of them in Saudi 
Arabia. Some governments have set up 
ministries to counter atheist thought. 
In many Islamic countries, it is a crime to 
be a non-believer and openly talk about 
it, and people are being jailed and even 
killed for this.
I decided to make a film to explore 
this phenomenon, which is not 
discussed enough.
Why did you choose film to communicate 
these issues?
If you want people to take action, 
you have to make them feel something. 
That is what films do. That is what 
art does. It does not just engage our 
intellectual capacity, it speaks to our 
emotional register. This is what is so 
unique and precious about all forms of art. 
Art goes beyond our differences, 
beyond all the walls and inequalities 
that exist between us. To me, art is 
an equalizing factor. To understand 
its power, you have to look at how 
oppressors, dictators and abusers treat 
art and artists. And the first people that 
oppressors target, other than women, 
usually, is artists. 
Going forward, what are your plans in 
your capacity as UNESCO’s Goodwill 
Ambassador? 
What I hope to do is not just promote the 
work that artists are doing, but also to 
talk about how artists are paying a great 
price doing this, in many parts of the 
world. Artists, including some of my own 
friends, are being persecuted, mistreated 
and imprisoned. And we need to protect 
them. My dedication and my heart is 
to try and support marginalized voices, 
and to tell more of their stories. 
Deeyah Khan, UNESCO’s first-ever 
Goodwill Ambassador for Artistic 
Freedom and Creativity since 2016, is 
an Emmy and Peabody award-winning 
documentary film-maker and founder 
of Fuuse, an independent media and 
arts company that puts women, people 
from minorities, and third-culture kids 
at the heart of telling their own stories. 
She also founded sister-hood, a digital

Using theatre as a catalyst for 
dialogue, Global Arts Corps 
encourages people from 
conflict zones to explore their 
painful pasts, and help them 
to build a future. A group of 
young Cambodians travel to 
a festival in Kigali to connect 
with Rwandan and Congolese 
audiences who have lived 
through similar traumatic 
experiences. Together, they 
help each other heal, through 
a shared understanding, 
tolerance and empathy.
“Through the rehearsal process, actors 
manage to hear the stories of those 
they have learned to fear, disdain, 
and hate and then, together, create 
a single, agreed upon, fair story of their 
multiple truths,” Michael Lessac, 
co-founder and Artistic Director of GAC, 
explains. 
Lessac, a well-known American theatre 
and film personality, is the creator 
and director of the award-winning 
international theatre piece, Truth in 
Translation, about the story of the 
South African Truth and Reconciliation 
Commission. Co-produced with South 
Africa’s Market Theatre, the project 
traveled to twenty-six cities in eleven 
countries around the world, and led 
to his co-founding of the Global Arts 
Corps in 2009, along with his wife, 
Jacqueline Bertrand. 
Global Arts Corps, which has taken 
its work from Rwanda to Kosovo, 
and Cambodia to Northern Ireland, 
hopes audience members from vastly 
different backgrounds can find a piece 
of themselves in the experiences 
of other people. 
In July 2016, nineteen young Cambodian 
performers traveled to Rwanda to 
participate in the Ubumuntu Arts Festival. 
The world premiere of their production, 
See You Yesterday, a unique mix of theatre, 
dance and circus, was performed in an 
amphitheatre on the grounds of the Kigali 
Genocide Memorial. The Cambodians 
– second-generation survivors of 
the Khmer Rouge genocide (1975 to 1979) 
– were afforded the rare chance to 
connect with an audience who were also 
survivors, of the genocide in Rwanda. 
The arts festival brought together 
companies from eighteen different 
countries, all of which had emerged 
from violent conflicts. In a country like 
Rwanda, where a million lives were lost 
in the genocide of 1994, the concept 
of humanity has been so fragile that the 
restoration of hope requires serious work. 
The Cambodian group was performing 
under the banner of the Global Arts 
Corps (GAC), an international community 
of professional artists which uses the 
transformative power of the theatre to 
bring together people from different 
post-conflict areas.

The Cambodian youth, some of 
them street children, were trained 
in acrobatics by the Phare Ponleu 
Selpak, an association created in 1992 
in Battambang city. Using their 
world-class circus skills, the association’s 
founders work to help children in their 
communities to overcome the problems 
of the dark past of their parents.
Empathy helps healing
The most significant outcome of bringing 
people from two different genocide 
backgrounds together was that both 
nationalities noticed that they were not 
alone, and had nothing to be ashamed 
of. A young boy said he remembered 
being forced to beat a prisoner when 
he was still in the Congo, as was enacted 
in the performance. Other touching 
testimonials emerged from the crowd.
They have taken their work to seventeen 
countries on four continents so far, 
reaching over 100,000 audience members 
and facilitating reconciliation workshops for 
over 15,000 people in post-conflict zones. 
Partnering with non-governmental 
organizations and training local activists, 
educators and artists, GAC works 
to ensure that the work they begin 
is carried on when they leave. Everything 
– from the rehearsals of each production, 
to the dialogues they spark – is filmed. 
The idea is to build a vast educational 
archive to supplement a group of theatre 
artists trained to collaborate with people 
emerging out of violent conflicts. 
Using professional theatre to support 
reconciliation initiatives was “not an 
easy process initially,” Lessac recalls. 
“Young people did not want to talk about 
the past, so they used their extraordinary 
physical skills to creatively move back to 
the past, to try to understand what their 
elders went through during the genocide.” 
After the festival, the Cambodian 
cast and crew traveled to southern 
Rwanda, to perform at the Kigeme 
refugee camp there. The camp is home 
to 20,000 refugees, displaced from 
the Democratic Republic of Congo, 
ravaged by two decades of civil war 
and famine. Using a makeshift stage 
in a vast open field, the Cambodians 
performed on three consecutive days 
– each time to swelling audiences. 
Besides, GAC facilitated workshops for 
young refugees after the performances.

Equally poignant was the reaction 
of Khuon Det, a co-founder of 
the Cambodian circus, who now works 
with the GAC. Growing up in a refugee 
camp on the Thai border after the 
collapse of the Khmer Rouge regime, 
he remembered his own experience as a 
child, as he saw the Congolese children 
rush to welcome the Cambodian group. 
“We were so happy to see outsiders…
it makes my heart full,” he said. 
“Talking about our past, however dark 
it may be, is a way to heal our wounds. 
It is also the best method to help future 
generations learn from past errors to 
prevent this from happening again,” 
says Innocent Munyeshuri, a young 
Rwandan actor who narrated the 
Cambodian show in Kinyarwanda, a local 
language also spoken by the Congolese.
Through an exploration of different 
identities, the GAC hopes to generate 
empathy among its actors. “You should 
be able to empathize through someone 
else’s point of view as well as your own, 
otherwise you do not know where you 
come from, you don’t understand others,” 
Lessac states.
Actors who grew up in post-conflict 
societies are the first to benefit 
from GAC’s work. Arben Bajraktaraj, 
an Albanian actor and one of GAC’s 
trainers, explains how empathy helps 
actors feel an inner security: “We see 
empathy as a discovery, the most 
important thing in our creation process. 
You must put your judgements aside to 
discover the real image, and it will change 
the way you see the world. For that, 
you must release yourself completely.”
Part circus, part theatre
The GAC’s future projects include bringing 
together people with similar dark pasts 
to participate in one huge production, 
which is part circus, part theatre. 
The actors will go back in time to discover 
where their prejudices and cultural anger 
come from and, out of that, create a story 
that includes truths from all the sides. 
This would create a solid basis

The project hopes to involve participants 
from the growing refugee communities 
in Germany and France. In Colombia, 
it will include former rebels who are 
being reintegrated into society after 
many years in the jungle. Young actors 
and musicians from Flint, Michigan 
(United States), will also participate. 
In the Middle East and Argentina, the 
work of women’s movements, past and 
present − dealing with peace and identity 
– will be highlighted. 
“We don’t imagine that we can change 
the world directly but, by working 
with youth and creating ways for them 
to understand their own post-conflict 
situations through rehearsal, we can 
begin to build pathways for insightful 
communication and connection 
between young people from different 
cultures and conflicts around the world. 
Hopefully, this can help to break the 
revenge cycle that continues to plague us 
today,” concludes Lessac.

by Magdalena Nandege
There has been a heightened 
awareness in recent years, 
of the strong links between 
culture and peace and security. 
The story of Magdalena, 
a young woman from South 
Sudan – a member of the 
Youth Peacemaker Network, 
the flagship programme 
of the Whitaker Peace and 
Development Initiative 
− illustrates how culture can 
be harnessed to transform 
societies impacted by conflicts, 
into safer and more productive 
communities.
This is something I have experienced 
personally. In 2014, I was in labour, and left 
unattended, as nurses and midwives struck 
work to reclaim unpaid salaries. Later I was 
assisted by midwives working with the 
World Health Organization (WHO). I knew 
then that women in South Sudan needed 
help to reduce maternal mortality.
This belief also led me to enroll in the Youth 
Peacemaker Network (YPN) of the Whitaker 
Peace and Development Initiative (WPDI). 
I joined the YPN in 2014 after hearing 
about it from the Eastern Equatoria Youth 
Union, of which I was secretary for gender 
and social welfare.
Through this programme, I have acquired 
skills to promote peace within myself 
and the youth in our community – 
through conflict management, mediation, 
Information and Communications 
Technology (ICT), meditation 
and entrepreneurship. 
The story 
of Magdalena,
South Sudan
My name is Magdalena Nandege. 
I am 23 years old and from South 
Sudan. I come from Homiri, a village 
in Budi county. It has a population of 
about 150,000 people, most of them 
agro-pastoralists − like my mother, who is 
a farmer. The county has two secondary 
schools and eleven primary schools, none 
of which have access to electricity. Only 
fifteen per cent of the population is literate. 
I am currently training to become 
a midwife at the Health Science Institute 
of Torit, the capital city of Imotong 
state. We are now twenty-four students, 
down from an original group of 
thirty-seven – some students stopped 
coming because of the lack of security, 
poverty and inadequate transportation. 
I chose this career because I believe 
it is important to take care of women. 
Women are the most vulnerable people 
in the world because they carry life.

The training aims to reduce violence 
and promote peace and development. 
Upon completing the course of 250 
hours, I was certified by WPDI as a Trainer 
of Trainees (ToT), to train local young 
people and develop activities in remote 
communities. These activities consist of 
the facilitation of peace processes and the 
development of community businesses, 
providing services to communities and 
jobs to young people. 
The Eastern Equatoria programme 
gathers eighteen ToTs and 156 youth, 
between the ages of 16 and 35, in payams 
(local communities). They can read 
and write, which is important, because 
the programme involves interaction 
using social media platforms. This way, 
we can help each other when dealing 
with conflicts and in the management of 
our respective small businesses. 
The programme has also helped me 
acquire confidence by using my artistic 
talent for a just cause. Drama and stories 
are very important to convey messages. 
As a peacemaker, I often train people or 
engage in community dialogues. I have 
noticed that when problems are really 
hard, it is easier to use art, to use words 
that people understand, because people 
are able to differentiate between good 
and wrong through art. 
Recently, I have made a short movie 
on gender-based violence, Magda and 
Boniface – Forced Marriages, with a group 
of friends and colleagues from YPN. 
We used a tablet provided by WPDI to 
make the film because we could not 
afford to buy a camera. A fictionalized 
version of situations that take place in 
our communities, the film was shot in 
English, and also in Toposa, Juba Arabic, 
and Arabic – everyone used their own 
language. 
Many of the people in the movie were 
not professional actors. Young people 
and community leaders came together 
to solve the issue of early forced 
marriage. The fact that they accepted to 
be in the movie was, for me, one of the 
best moments of the whole process.
The movie tells the true story of a young 
adolescent, whose family wants to marry 
her off, and she refuses. She is allowed 
to make her case before a council, made 
up of her family and the community, and 
convinces them that a young woman 
should be able to choose her own 
partner and life. 
The film was shared through Bluetooth 
with youth who had smart phones and 
also used by WPDI as one of its activities. 
We have not yet shown the film in 
schools but we used a projection during 
a training of payam youth and their 
reaction was positive. The students 
acknowledged the need to encourage 
the education of girls and to discourage 
early forced marriage. I hope to show 
the film to a wider audience and to make 
more films like it, with more resources.
Through my studies and training with 
WPDI, UNESCO and UN Women, I have 
acquired skills in peace-building, 
conflict management, mediation, 
meditation, business skills, and the fight 
against gender-based violence. I have 
learned a lot about peace and human 
rights. But this needs to be translated 
in the languages that people speak 
at home − it must talk to their hearts. 
I think that art can do a lot for peace in 
South Sudan, so much more than long 
speeches. It can show positive characters 
that people can identify with, inviting 
them to practise peace and sustainable 
development. We need more art in South 
Sudan so we can have more peace.

Hijacked Education
Text: Katerina Markelova 
Photos: Diego Ibarra Sánchez / MeMo
Having a mother who was a teacher, 
Diego was already aware of the challenges 
of education when he set off for Pakistan 
in 2009, at the age of 27. At the time, 
the country was in the clutches of a 
violent Taliban campaign against the 
school system. That is when he launched 
the Hijacked Education project, 
which the Courier highlights in this Zoom.
In 2014, Diego moved to Lebanon, 
where he still lives today, with his wife 
and two-year-old son. He has continued 
to develop his work on the theme of 
school in the time of war, going to Syria, 
Iraq and Colombia.
“Unfortunately, the chapter is not closed 
yet,” says Diego. “This is still very much 
how life is in many parts of the world, 
and so my project is ongoing. We consume 
millions of images without taking the time 
to digest them. In passing from one reality 
to another, without pausing, we have 
become ‘tourists’ of the pain of others,” 
he adds. Using the power of his work as 
a photographer, he attempts to encourage 
the hurried ‘tourists’ that we are, to stop 
and think, and to help to defuse 
the ticking time bomb that is threatening 
so many of the world’s school children.
“Time, a time bomb, stagnates in 
exile and blots the sheets of school 
calendars that will never return.” 
Spanish photojournalist Diego Ibarra 
Sánchez uses this metaphor to express 
a thought that has been haunting him 
for a long time – war is wiping out 
the future of an entire generation.
According to UNESCO, only half of refugee 
children and a quarter of adolescents 
attend school, while over 28 million 
children living in regions affected by 
conflicts do not go to school at all.
Too often the effects of war on education 
are missed by the lenses of war 
photographers. Teachers are murdered, 
schools are destroyed or converted 
to military bases, there is profound 
psychological trauma – and, in the end, 
millions of children are deprived of 
access to an education. Going beyond 
the sensationalism of images of war, 
Diego wants to show how the future of 
a ‘lost generation’ is being destroyed.

We are seeing a crisis today in our idea 
of humanity, and philosophy can and 
must help us to think it through. A crisis 
in our idea of humanity: what do we 
mean by this? In the French newspaper, 
Le Monde, dated 30 April 2016, Nicolas 
Hulot – who was not yet environment 
minister (a post he has held since May 2017), 
but head of an environmental foundation 
– asked this question: “Concerning migrants, 
where has our humanity gone?”
I consider the way in which the question is 
asked to be crucial, because it shows that 
what is revealed by the “migrant crisis” we are 
experiencing – unmatched since the Second 
World War, they say – is our own isolationism, 
which is today calling into question 
the regulatory and ethical idea of humanity. 
We must think together about the migrant, 
a figure that highlights human distress, 
and the rise of what has been called populism. 
I prefer to use the term ethno-nationalism 
or tribalism, because I consider the accepted 
term of populism inadequate to describe 
what we are experiencing today.
Philosophy versus
tribalism
by Souleymane Bachir Diagne
The migrant crisis points 
to the tribalist isolationism 
that can be found at the origin 
of what the philosopher 
Souleymane Bachir Diagne 
calls the “crisis in our idea 
of humanity”. Diagne takes 
us on a philosophical journey 
through current issues, along 
the lines of Bergsonian thought.
This article is published to coincide 
with the International Day for Tolerance, 
16 November, and World Philosophy Day, 
celebrated each year on the third 
Thursday of November.

The best symbol today for 
this encounter between the migrant 
and the ethno-nationalist is the ship 
chartered by young Europeans of 
the far-right movement, Génération 
Identitaire (Generation Identity). They use 
the ship to intercept migrants’ boats, 
and non-governmental organization 
(NGO) ships helping migrants, 
in the Mediterranean − one wonders 
if they intend to sink them. 
Another image is that of the fishermen 
of Tunisia, opposed to the refuelling 
of what they consider a “racist ship” 
in the country’s ports.

The ‘migrant crisis’ we are 
experiencing is our own 
isolationism, which today calls 
into question the regulatory 
and ethical idea of humanity
The ethno-nationalist movements have 
brought to power − here and there, 
as we know − parties and personalities 
that have turned migrants into 
bogeymen. They have urged their 
constituents to rally against migrants, 
by forming a national front. They came 
close to making their ideology dominant 
in the Netherlands, a country that history 
– the history of philosophy, in particular 
– considers the very homeland of 
tolerance and the idea of humanity.
The primitive nature  
of the tribal instinct
Asking ourselves what gives tribalism 
its power requires an analysis to which 
philosophy − Henri Bergson (1859 to 
1941) in particular − sheds the most 
invaluable light. It teaches us that the 
radical refusal to hear Hulot’s question 
originates in the negation of the very idea 
of a “humanity in general”, on which the 
obligation of hospitality can be based.
Is there no humanity in general? It exists, 
for what Bergson calls the “soul that 
opens” or “the open soul”, the one at the 
heart of his thought in The Two Sources 
of Morality and Religion (Paris, 1932).
In this work, the French philosopher 
explains that the feeling of belonging 
to a tribe is an instinct within us. 
And because it is an instinct, there 
is no need to question its origin or 
its nature, but only to recognize that 
it exists and that it is inscribed primitively 
in our nature.
This, then, is the motive on which 
tribal policy and the rallying call 
for ethno-nationalism is based. 
It is therefore understandable that when 
this policy is given the appearance of 
common sense − and presents itself 
as immediately evident versus the 
complexities of what it condemns as 
the “political correctness” of openness 
to others − it is making the primitive 
nature of the tribal instinct its primary 
truth. What exists for me is the circle of 
closeness constituted by the community 
of those who resemble me, who have 
the same colour of skin or the same 
religion, and so on. It has therefore 
been proposed to sort asylum-seekers 
according to their religion!
If one wishes, then, to evoke an 
abstraction such as that of a humanity, 
it can only be a zoological totalization, 
a grouping obtained only by the 
addition of ultimately heterogeneous 
humanities. One cannot simply arrive 
at the idea of humanity starting from 
affiliations and gradually enlarging 
the territorial inscriptions. In short, 
one cannot stretch the tribal instinct 
into an instinct of the human.
Beyond instinct, 
openness
It is therefore necessary to be able to 
emerge from instinct, in order to find 
oneself, at once in touch with humanity, 
in oneself and in others. Then the 
question is this: how is it possible to 
open the soul beyond the tribe if it is 
originally established that we “naturally 
and directly love our parents and 
our fellow-countrymen, whereas love 
of mankind is indirect and acquired”, 
to quote Bergson? Where can we 
tap into a force that does not have 
the immediacy of an instinct? 
In other words, how is it possible to acquire 
something that goes against nature’s plan 
to enlist us in the community our “tribe” 
has built, with its own morality and its 
opposition to other tribes? This is possible 
because it is also in our nature, explains 
Bergson, to be able to “cheat” this same 
nature and to extend, through intelligence, 
“social solidarity into human fraternity”.
We thus acquire the meaning of 
this human fraternity through, on 
the one hand, religion (and it must 
be remembered here that one of 
the etymologies of this word gives it 
the meaning of that which connects) and, 
on the other, intelligence taking the form 
of philosophical reason. Thus, to open us 
up beyond instinct, there is religion and 
its call to love humanity “through God, 
in God”, and reason, “by which we all 
commune with one another”, and 
through which “the philosophers bring 
us to see mankind and thus show us 
the eminent dignity of the human 
person, the right of all to respect.”

This love of humanity is not primitive 
like instinct. It is nonetheless primary. 
We experience it through charitable 
action or philosophical meaning: in one 
case as in the other, Bergson tells us, 
we arrive there in one leap, and not in 
stages that would go from the family to 
the nation, and so on.
“The open soul” is precisely the principle 
of this leap. It counters what one might 
call the stunted, closed soul, for which to 
love is to love against; which, to the idea 
of humanity, replies that its main concern 
is itself and what touches it most closely. 
And this is already a great deal, more 
than enough to deal with − it cannot take 
on all the world’s troubles.
Versus this stunted soul and its false facts, 
I recognize in myself an open soul that 
makes humanity immediately present 
to me – I can touch it – and allows me 
to be the neighbour of someone who 
is not close. As Bergson writes, I also 
recognize by this very fact that we have 
always to become human. In other words, 
we have to grow this open soul within 
us continually, and to found upon it a 
response to the migrant crisis, that is 
comprised of humanity and hospitality.

For decades, a theoretical physicist 
defied the suspicions of his government 
and continued to teach and research, 
enduring the perpetual fear of 
surveillance and repression. Educated 
in Europe, he had published extensively 
and built an international reputation. 
He suffered for decades, advocating for 
political freedoms in his home country, 
and defending the rights of his students 
who stood up for the same values. 
Ultimately, he fled, seeking the safety 
of universities in the United States. 
This was not 1930. Nor was this 
scientist Albert Einstein. This was 2012, 
when the Institute of International 
Education Scholar Rescue Fund (IIE-SRF) 
− a programme I direct − received his 
call for help. This renowned scientist 
is one of thousands of academics 
forcibly and permanently displaced 
from their homelands. It is we who 
now reap the rewards, as he pushes 
the boundaries of science for 
our universal good. 
History repeats itself. We would hope, 
then, that the lessons learned from 
the past would teach and protect us 
from future crises. Yet here we are 
in 2017, nearing the end of yet another 
landmark year in which thousands 
of lives have been upended by violence 
and instability. 
According to the United Nations High 
Commissioner for Refugees (UNHCR), 
there are 65.6 million forcibly displaced 
people worldwide, 22.5 million 
refugees, and 10 million stateless. 
On average, 28,300 people are forced 
to flee their homes every day because 
of conflict and persecution. 
Refugee 
scientists: 
quiet pioneers dedicated to discovery
by Sarah Willcox 
In a world torn apart by strife, 
it is crucial that scientists and 
academics whose individual and 
intellectual freedoms are at risk 
are given a second chance to 
continue to innovate and work in 
safe environments. Without these 
freedoms, as Einstein pointed 
out, in 1933, “… there would have 
been no Shakespeare, no Goethe, 
no Newton, no Pastor, no Lister… 
It is only men who are free 
who create the inventions and 
intellectual works which to us 
moderns make life worthwhile.”

Not “just” refugees
The statistics are staggering, 
but we may accept them as part of 
a new global reality. Take a moment to 
consider the countless millions over 
the last century who were displaced 
− we know that “refugee” does not 
define them. They are mothers 
and fathers, sisters and brothers, 
granddaughters and nephews. They are 
neighbours and integral members 
of our communities. They have laid 
the bedrock of our towns and in many 
cases, crossed national boundaries to 
bridge our cultures and economies. 
Many have done this through 
their academic work: teaching at local 
universities, publishing the latest 
scientific discovery − quiet pioneers, 
contributing to research halfway 
around the world. 
Albert Einstein was lucky to be in the 
US in 1933 when Hitler came to power. 
His house was ransacked, convincing 
him that he could no longer call 
Germany home. After a brief sojourn 
to Europe, he returned to the US, 
where he joined the newly-established 
Institute for Advanced Study in 
Princeton, New Jersey. We do not 
need to understand Einstein’s theories 
to know that the scientific world has 
benefitted from them immensely. 
Few of us are aware that thousands of 
refugee scientists and scholars from 
war-torn Europe in the last century 
excelled in their host countries, even in 
the face of shocking rejection by 
their host communities and national 
academies. In the US, in the 1930s and 
1940s, the Emergency Committee 
in Aid of Displaced Foreign Scholars, 
a consortium of refugee organizations 
– which included the IIE − helped nearly 
400 academics, including 100 physicists, 
to find academic positions. 
According to the economist Petra 
Moser, patents in the US alone increased 
by over thirty per cent in fields 
commonly pursued by Jewish scientists 
of the 1930s. The positive ripple effect 
for generations to come is invaluable. 
Einstein’s era included Erwin 
Schrödinger, who fled persecution in his 
native Austria to join the Dublin Institute 
for Advanced Studies in the late 1930s 
– his work in theoretical physics won him 
the Nobel Prize in 1933. And physicist 
Hans Bethe, the German-American 
nuclear scientist and winner of the 
1967 Nobel Prize in Physics, played an 
important role in the development 
of the hydrogen bomb, but more 
importantly, he later campaigned with

Exceptional 
contributions 
More than a third of Nobel prizes 
won by the US in the STEM (science, 
technology, engineering and 
mathematics) fields have been 
awarded to foreign-born scientists. 
Today, we continue to celebrate 
refugees for their contributions to 
science and society after they were 
given a second chance. Sergey Brin, 
who co-founded Google, was just 
six when his family fled the Soviet 
Union for the US in 1979, when his 
father could no longer endure the 
entrenched academic repression 
in the Soviet Union.
Since 2002, the IIE Scholar Rescue 
Fund has carried on the legacy 
of the Emergency Committee, 
aiding academics afflicted by 
conflict and persecution. Most of 
the academics we work with have 
been displaced or are on the verge 
of long-term displacement. They have 
been singled out for persecution 
by insecure regimes because 
of their academic work, religion, 
ethnicity, and, increasingly, for 
supporting their fellow academics. 
At the height of the conflict in Iraq 
from 2007 to 2013, we helped place 
hundreds of scientists at universities 
in neighbouring countries after they 
received anonymous letters threatening 
first their positions, and then their 
families. Their lives were overturned 
in ways that would paralyze the average 
person. Yet after a few years of support 
in the diaspora, most have returned 
to Iraq or maintained their academic 
productivity in the region. Many are 
helping to rebuild their universities. 
Based on our own experience, 
we estimate thousands of academics 
every year need a safe place to pursue 
their work. Our programme has provided 
vital financial support and academic 
connections to more than 700 academics 
from over fifty countries. Other refugee 
organizations have supported thousands 
of others. But it is difficult to estimate 
how many displaced scientists have 
permanently lost their academic work, 
and will never have the chance to rebuild 
it in a safe environment.
Opening doors 
and providing support
Hundreds of displaced scholars have 
suffered because their publications 
– lost in the panic of their flight from 
danger – may pre-date online records 
that would have safely maintained 
them. For many more scholars, 
language barriers feel insurmountable. 
Without readily available resources 
– like scholarships and fellowships – 
and open doors at universities and 
scientific institutions, the quiet scientist 
lacking the name-recognition of an 
Einstein has little to no chance of reviving 
his academic work. The wasted years of 
training and the lost potential to society 
has done irreparable damage to the cause 
of science.
The Scholar Rescue Fund rose from 
the IIE’s nearly hundred-year history 
of helping threatened students and 
scholars. Ours is now among a handful 
of formalized programmes that provide 
essential support for threatened 
academics. The Council for At-Risk 
Academics (CARA) was founded in 1933 
by Britain’s foremost academics and 
scientists in response to Hitler’s decision 
to expel hundreds of leading scholars 
from German universities on racial 
grounds. CARA works closely with the 
Scholars at Risk Network (founded in 
2000), and Germany’s Philipp Schwartz 
Initiative of the Alexander von Humboldt 
Foundation. The PAUSE programme of 
the Collège de France helps welcome 
scientists in exile, and The World 
Academy of Sciences (TWAS), a UNESCO 
programme based in Trieste, Italy, 
supports refugee scientists, especially 
those from developing countries. 
Organizations and universities in Belgium, 
the European Union, Canada and Jordan 
also provide aid to refugee scholars. 
But there is so much more to be done, 
to ensure that the world’s intellectual 
capital will seed innovation and discovery 
for generations to come.
Sarah Willcox (USA) is Director of 
the IIE Scholar Rescue Fund, which 
she has been involved with since 
2003. Based in New York, she oversees 
the IIE-SRF operations, including 
partnerships, programme policy, 
outreach, and communications.

Mauritanian film director
The UNESCO Courier, 2000-10
Exile is always a handicap. But distance 
allows you to look at your own country, 
its past, its history, from a slightly 
foreign viewpoint. When we talk about 
home, we tend to hesitate, to go by 
feel. It’s a delicate process that you 
can lose a grip on at any moment. 
Maybe we have more sensitivity. 
Sometimes you choose to be silent 
and allow people to interpret. 
Bujor Nedelcovici, 
Romanian novelist, essayist and scriptwriter
The UNESCO Courier, 1996-10 
If exile is an initiation test, it is also 
a test of the truth. It entails shedding 
one’s illusions and the world of wishful 
thinking and pretence, and arriving 
at a kind of lucidity. It means learning 
how to winnow out the wheat from 
the chaff by discarding bogus tolerance, 
which produces a semblance of inner 
peace, in favour of real tolerance, 
which requires one to immerse oneself 
in the universal (...) Involuntary exile 
has become, in my case, voluntary exile 
in search of things past and spiritual 
resurrection. To accept is already 
to effect a return, at least to oneself.
Rithy Panh,  
Cambodian film director 
The UNESCO Courier, 2000-10
When you’re an exile, you don’t 
really have an identity any more. 
Whether in Cambodia or France, 
I’m kind of at home everywhere and 
now. Far and close from everything. 
I’m interested in this distance. It allows 
you to stand back and to see further, 
to grasp the shape of things. The lesser 
evil for an exile is managing to make 
use of this.
You ask me 
what exile is…
The words of exiled creators,  
spoken through our columns
Edouard J. Maunick,  
Mauritian poet
The UNESCO Courier, 1994-3 
Exile becomes hard when loneliness 
sets in, a loneliness that has more to do 
with the memory of something essential 
rooted within oneself than with ordinary 
recollections. Otherwise I do not regard 
exile as painful, because it not only means 
leaving home to go somewhere else, 
it also means stepping forward towards 
yourself, deciding to get to know yourself 
and to live in and with yourself. After living 
through your own tribulations and 
moments of wonderment, you need to find 
out about others, but the first essential is 
self-knowledge. Exile then becomes a quest, 
an expedition into the inner space of others, 
in the course of which one must, above all, 
never give in to the temptation of wanting 
to portray others in one’s own likeness, 
on the pretext of aligning certain details.
Spôjmaï Zariâb,  
Afghan writer 
The UNESCO Courier, 2008-2 
You ask me what exile is… Years ago, 
in a quiet corner of Kabul, I read the 
Persian translation of The Man from Kabul, 
a short story by Rabindranath Tagore. 
With his magical words, this talented 
Indian writer made me discover the 
pain of exile (...) I, who was sheltered 
from misery and who had only known 
war in books, saw myself also sheltered 
from exile… until the end of my days. 
At the time, I ignored that one day, 
alas, history’s unfair hand would turn 
every Afghan into the Man from Kabul 
by Tagore. That history’s folly would 
divide an entire nation and disperse 
the Afghans to all four corners of the 
world, far from their fathers, mothers, 
children, sisters and brothers. Around me, 
I do not know of a single family that was 
spared the torment of exile, and that, 
although without having read Tagore, 
did not live the story of the Man from 
Kabul and did not feel his pain within.
Véronique Tadjo, 
Ivorian writer and painter
The UNESCO Courier, 2008-2 
For a long time, I traveled, my mind and heart 
at peace, telling myself that I could return 
home when I wanted to. Things changed 
with the Ivorian crisis. I had the impression 
the door suddenly closed and left me 
outside. I found it difficult to understand 
what was happening, how we got there. I felt 
alienated, as if everything had to be started 
all over again. Exile begins when you can no 
longer return to the country you left behind, 
when the way back becomes painful.

Our guest
As president of UTICA, you played a major 
role in helping Tunisia resolve the political 
crisis of 2013, by initiating a “national 
dialogue” with three other organizations. 
How did you achieve this?
There were four of us [the Tunisian 
National Dialogue Quartet, winner of 
the Nobel Peace Prize, 2015] − UTICA, 
the Tunisian General Labour Union 
(UGTT), the Tunisian Order of Lawyers 
and the Tunisian Human Rights League 
(LTDH). After the politically-motivated 
assassination of the deputy [opposition 
party leader], Mohamed Brahmi, in July 
2013, barely six months after Chokri 
Bellaïd, leader of the Popular Front, 
was murdered, we decided to publish 
a joint statement calling for calm. 
We then used this [statement] as the basis 
for a road map, which, for us, reflected 
the aspirations of the vast majority 
of Tunisians. We submitted it to the main 
political parties and twenty-two parties 
agreed to sign it. Only the Congrès pour 
la République (CPR), one of the parties 
in the interim government at the time, 
refused to take part in the process. 
The Ennahdha party, which had 
also joined the interim government, 
finally signed the statement, without 
the amendments it had wanted.
For the first time in Tunisia’s history, 
relations between workers’ unions and 
employers were relatively good. Was 
‘dialogue’ the watchword for dealing with 
political and social issues?
Yes. Before entering into the political 
negotiations, there was a series of 
discussions to reach an understanding 
between UTICA and UGTT – on the 
initiative of UTICA, I should emphasize. 
We wanted to establish this initial 
milestone in social dialogue. There is 
nothing is more effective than getting 
together around a table when it comes 
to breaking down barriers between 
unions and employers. Businesses 
cannot function without their owners 
or their workers. In the interests 
of productivity, the best thing is 
to adopt the principle of “living together 
in peace” in spite of our differences. 
UTICA used to be an ally of the 
authoritarian government, but after the 
2011 revolution, it became one of the 
players in the democratic process. How 
did this change come about? 
It’s true, UTICA was not totally 
independent in its decision-making. 
We are expected to work with 
government, whatever its political colour. 
The capital is always fragile. Even so, 
certain burning issues had been tackled 
before 2011, such as parallel trade or 
fraud and corruption. Fortunately, we are 
now a democracy, which allows us to 
address even the most sensitive issues 
more frankly and openly. This greatly 
facilitates dialogue.
In your opinion, what role should 
the private sector play in upholding 
the democratic process?
The slogan created by the youth 
movement during the revolution was 
“Dignity and Work”. It’s true, there is no 
dignity without work. So our role is to 
invest in order to create jobs. And if we 
can achieve this objective, we will have 
resolved the country’s economic and 
social problems. 
Democracy is a major achievement. 
But it is not sufficient for the stability of 
the country. What good is talking if you 
don’t have enough to eat? So we have an 
important role to play in creating jobs. 
But the government has to follow through. 
There are several things holding back 
development. A number of laws need 
to be revised. The slow pace of the 
administration is discouraging investors. 
Foreign investors are not very motivated 
because they feel that existing laws 
are either not clear or not applied. 
Even we Tunisians, in spite of our good 
will, feel frustrated at not being able 
to act as quickly as we’d like because 
the administration and the laws aren’t 
keeping pace.
Prosperity springs 
from trust
Ouided Bouchamaoui 
Ouided Bouchamaoui, winner of the 2015 Nobel Peace Prize, makes a case 
for a strong state that can communicate with its youth, and for a private 
sector that encourages young entrepreneurs. According to the President 
of the Tunisian Confederation of Industry, Trade and Handicrafts (UTICA), 
there can be no democracy without economic development.

There are a number of obstacles today 
that we are all aware of. What is needed 
is the political will to overcome them 
and restore trust between all the 
stakeholders − a necessary precondition 
for any form of development. True, we 
have passed from being a dictatorship 
to a democracy. But this does not 
mean that the state has to be absent. 
A minimum of order is necessary, if only 
to apply the law. We do not want an 
authoritarian state again, but we do want 
a strong state. And the state derives its 
strength from the application of the law. 
The authority of the law provides rigour, 
and rigour leads to trust. And it is trust 
that brings investment and prosperity.
Terrorism and the recruitment of youth 
via the internet has become one of the 
major challenges of our time. In 2015, 
the Tunisian Quartet launched an appeal 
from the Nobel podium to combat this 
plague. What solutions does it suggest?
I believe that we haven’t yet addressed 
the problems of youth in a pragmatic 
manner. In Tunisia, six years after 
the revolution, young people have still not 
seen any concrete actions in response to 
their demands. They still have no work, 
no leisure, no adequate framework to fulfil 
their potential, and no cultural or sports 
activities. On the other hand, they have 
easy access to the internet. With no work 
and no one listening to them, they are easy 
prey for recruitment, especially if they are 
promised paradise and loads of money. 
We still haven’t realized just how serious 
this phenomenon is, especially in the 
interior of the country. Let’s not forget that 
terrorism is closely linked to smuggling 
− in other words, the informal sector 
− where young people find work. A whole 
education programme has to be put in 
place by the government to enter into 
dialogue with youth, to teach them about 
citizenship and to explain that the state 
alone cannot solve all their problems. 
To create employment, the state has to 
ensure that there is security, political 
stability and legislation to encourage 
entrepreneurship and foreign investment.
Employers are often called “businessmen”. 
But since 2011, they have had a woman 
as their chief representative. This is a first! 
How is this situation viewed? 
It has never bothered anyone. 
As a company director myself, I am 
no stranger to the family of employers. 
Also, no one thinks that just because 
UTICA has a woman as its president, 
it risks losing its authority or weakening 
its role. It is true that I was the only 
woman on the executive board and 
I was democratically and transparently 
elected, with a very clear majority 
over the other candidates. 
Public-private partnerships (PPPs) are 
recognized as a necessary element in 
achieving the United Nations Sustainable 
Development Goals (SDGs). Where does 
Tunisia stand on this? 
The Tunisian parliament passed a law 
allowing public-private partnerships. 
But as it was formulated, this law has 
emptied the principle of any meaning 
in practice. We are now working to 
improve it. Promulgation of the law 
hasn’t been followed up adequately with 
information to explain the objectives 
underlying PPPs. With the exception 
of certain strategic sectors – where the 
state has to be present and where the 
private sector does not have the means 
or the authority to intervene – the private 
sector has to participate actively in 
investments, especially in the provinces, 
to develop the economy and particularly 
to encourage youth entrepreneurship. 
And I’ll take this opportunity to send out 
a message to young people: you can 
always start small and expand later.
Would you like to see radical solutions to 
get Tunisia out of the economic crisis it 
is in? What role could UTICA play in this 
process?
There are no miracle solutions. 
An advantage for Tunisia is that 
the economic ills are well-defined 
and known to everyone. The most 
urgent thing is to apply the law. 
We have to find a solution to parallel 
trade and the informal economy, 
which are undermining our entire 
economy. We need to have better 
control over our borders and make a 
serious effort to get youth into organized 
employment. We also have to convince 
people that paying their taxes is an 
act of citizenship. Finally, the Tunisian 
government, which previously did quite 
a good job, needs to restore the image 
it used to have, so that we can put 
our trust in it once again.

The first woman to be president 
of UTICA, Ouided Bouchamaoui 
was designated “Best Businesswoman 
in the Arab world” by the Deauville 
Partnership, launched at the G8 
Summit in 2013. In 2014, she received 
the Business for Peace Award from 
the Oslo Business for Peace Foundation, 
and in 2015, was awarded the Golden 
Shield of Excellence by the Arab 
Organization for Social Responsibility.
I think that the choice was made on 
the basis of objective criteria, such as 
the programme, charisma, a sense of 
leadership and management skills. 
Frankly, I have never felt uneasy as a 
woman in this position.
Do the pressures of politics and union 
work interfere with your private life?
When one becomes a public figure, 
one no longer has the private life one 
used to have. It’s a choice I have to 
accept. I work without pay for the good 
of my country and the organization. I am 
prepared to endure all kinds of pressures 
and criticisms, so long as they stay within 
my official and professional sphere. 
What is regrettable is the interference 
with my private life. Some people 
unfortunately mix everything up. 
But I keep things separate. I respond 
seriously to all objective criticism 
concerning my professional and political 
activities, according to my convictions. 
But I simply ignore disparaging remarks 
about my private life. 
My father built up a family and 
businesses conscientiously and with 
hard work. He taught me to have a sense 
of responsibility, which has enabled me 
to manage my personal and professional 
life with the necessary serenity.

Current affairs
Nanhai No. 1 is one of the oldest and 
largest ancient sunken ships ever found in 
China. When and how was it discovered?
Nanhai No. 1 was discovered in 1987 by 
a joint Sino-British team, composed of the 
Guangzhou Salvage Bureau and Maritime 
Exploration & Recoveries PLC. They were 
looking for the Dutch East India Company 
vessel, Rimsburge, but failed to find it. 
Instead, they accidently found a Chinese 
merchant ship which sank in the 
thirteenth century, buried twenty-three 
metres underwater. 
The joint mission tried to retrieve some 
objects from the shipwreck. Did this work? 
They did manage to lift some objects, 
but totally destroyed the rear of the ship 
in the process. Luckily, the shipwreck 
escaped any serious pillaging attempts, 
because of its location which was visible 
from the coastline. 
‘Nanhai’ means South China Sea, but 
what does ‘No. 1’ refer to?
It refers to an archaeological way of 
naming shipwrecks − the name of the 
discovery spot appears first, then comes 
the number that reflects the order 
in which the wrecks were found. 
Do we have any idea why Nanhai No. 1 
sank at the very beginning of its journey?  
The most likely scenario is that the ship 
was overloaded. Or it perished in a storm. 
How many tons of cargo was it 
transporting? 
Nanhai No. 1 was designed for a load 
of nearly 200 tons. There are estimates 
that it was carrying 100,000 sets of 
antiques. Nanhai No.1 had a very rich 
cargo: besides the 13,000 pieces of 
porcelain from five famous kilns of the 
time excavated so far, it was carrying 
151 gold, 124 silver and 170 copper sets, 
and 17,000 copper coins. What we found 
was totally beyond our expectations. 
Interview by Katerina Markelova 
and Xiaorong Chen
As China celebrates the thirtieth 
anniversary of the discovery 
of Nanhai No. 1, visitors to this 
thirteenth‑century shipwreck 
can watch archaeologists as 
they excavate the vessel on‑site, 
in an aquarium specially built to 
house the structure. A marvel 
of "in‑whole"salvaging, 
it took twenty years before 
the shipwreck could be lifted 
out of the water, another 
six years before excavation 
could be started, and six more 
years before the process is 
completed in 2018. Add another 
twenty to thirty years for the 
conservation of the ship’s body 
to be completed.  
An interview with Jiang 
Bo, who shares details 
of this unprecedented 
archaeological endeavour. 
The China National Center for 
Underwater Cultural Heritage and 
UNESCO organize an international 
conference on the “Discovery and 
Study of Nanhai No. 1 Shipwreck” in 
Yangjiang County, Guangdong Province, 
in November 2017.

Do we know where this merchant vessel 
was headed? 
Chinese ceramics have been found 
in the Indian Ocean, in India, Persia, 
and the Middle East – the ship was 
probably heading to one of these 
destinations. Maritime trade trajectories 
were complicated in those days, with 
many stops. Singapore, Southeast Asia 
and the East-African shore could have 
been potential destinations. What is 
almost certain is that it was sailing from 
China to the Indian Ocean. 
There are few records of shipbuilding 
technology 800 years ago in China or the 
rest of the world. What do we know now?
This ship was built around 1216, during 
the Southern Song dynasty. What is 
confirmed is that this kind of ship, called 
‘Fuchuan’, was made in Fujian province 
(‘Fu’ means ‘from Fujian’ and ‘chuan’ means 
‘ship’). The most distinctive characteristic 
of a Fuchuan is its watertight-bulkhead 
technology, which was inscribed on 
UNESCO’s List of Intangible Cultural Heritage 
in Need of Urgent Safeguarding, in 2010.

Twenty years after it was discovered, 
the entire ship was lifted out of the water, 
making it the first “in-whole” salvage 
of a shipwreck. 
On 21 December 2007, after nine months 
of preparation, the shipwreck was lifted 
and moved from the seabed to the 
Guangdong Maritime Silk Road Museum, 
which was especially designed for it. 
China’s State Administration of Cultural 
Heritage and the Transport Department 
worked together to build a 5,500-ton 
caisson [a large watertight case], 
big enough to contain the shipwreck 
of 35.7 × 14.4 × 7.2 metres. The box was 
then sunk into the sea and pressed down 
into the seabed to cover the shipwreck. 
Then the mud around the box was cleared 
and a floor inserted, so that the box could 
be lifted onto the surface of the water. 
The whole operation cost $20 million. 
The lifting of Nanhai No. 1 is considered 
the first in-whole salvage in the world. 
However, strictly speaking, there are other 
examples − two warships, Sweden’s Vasa 
and the British Mary Rose were similarly 
salvaged. But China was the first country 
to creatively use a caisson that was highly 
protective for the wreck.
Although the salvage operation was 
totally carried out by the Chinese, 
we needed advice when it came to 
archaeological excavations. Before these 
started in 2013, we conducted tests with 
the help of Japanese scholars, to decide 
what was the best way to proceed.   
What are the main findings since the 
excavation of the cargo started in 2013?  
The ship is well-preserved because it 
was buried, and we have the unique 
chance to conduct the excavation 
in a very detailed manner. We are getting 
much more information than if we were 
working underwater. We have clear 
archaeological evidence about how 
people packaged things, and what kind 
of food people ate on the ship. We found 
some personal objects, such as delicate 
lacquerware and pottery, gold necklaces 
and a Middle East-style belt. So we know 
that there were probably some foreigners 
on the ship as well − maybe Indians, 
maybe Arabs. We also found the bones 
of three individuals. 
The ship is maintained in a gigantic 
aquarium which replicates 
the exact water quality, temperature 
and environment that the wreck 
was discovered in

Would you say the finding of this ship 
marks the very beginning of Chinese 
underwater archaeology?
Yes, thirty years ago, the investigation 
process was driven by the personal 
enthusiasm of a few people and private 
donations. The research office of 
underwater archaeology at the National 
Museum of Chinese History was set 
up in 1987, after this discovery, and 
its early mission was to support the 
exploration process. The office could rely 
on the specific location data provided 
in 1989 by the museum (now called 
the National Museum of China) and the 
Japan Underwater Archaeology Research 
Institute, thanks to the donation of 
a Hong Kong merchant, Chen Laifa. 
Three investigation missions to 
Nanhai No. 1 were run by Zhang Wei, 
one of China’s earliest underwater 
archaeologists. Conditions at the site 
were difficult, with poor visibility and 
strong sea currents. The archaeologists 
realized then, that the best option 
was to get the ship out of the water 
– although it was very expensive.
The Center for the Protection of 
National Underwater Cultural Relics 
was set up by the Chinese Academy 
of Culture Heritage in 2009. In 2014, 
the government combined it with the 
underwater archaeology departments 
of the National Museum of China, 
to form the China National Center for 
Underwater Cultural Heritage. The aim 
was to ascertain the real situation 
of China’s underwater relics and to play 
a leading role in protecting them.
What is unique about the excavations 
on Nanhai No. 1? 
Now that the ship is inside the museum, 
archaeologists, conservation and 
restoration specialists, digital mapping 
and recording system specialists 
− all work together on a daily basis, which 
is quite unusual. We also simultaneously 
think about how to exhibit what 
we have found. When a package is 
identified, an archaeologist would 
immediately open it to see what is 
inside − a museologist would leave 
it untouched. That is why we always talk 
to each other. 
The Guangdong Maritime Silk Road 
Museum is the only museum in Asia with 
facilities for an underwater display of 
this magnitude. Could you describe it? 
The museum was built on Hailing island, 
close to Yangjiang city, Guangdong 
province, at a cost of $20 million. 
It is made up of five oval-shaped 
buildings, one of which, the Crystal 
Palace, made of glass, houses 
Nanhai No.1. The ship is maintained 
in a gigantic aquarium which replicates 
the exact water quality, temperature 
and environment that the wreck was 
discovered in. Visitors to the museum 
can view archaeologists as they continue 
their work, excavating the vessel on-site. 
They can then ascend to the top floor, 
to stand under a simulated star-studded 
sky, as if they were on board the ship 
at night. 
Today, Hailing, which used to be a remote 
island, is one of China’s top ten tourist 
islands − the museum is its only modern 
building, attracting over 300,000 
visitors in 2016. The local people have 
substantially benefited from this tourism.

Visitors to the museum participate in

Nanhai No. 1.
What does the future hold for Nanhai No. 1?
We will finish the excavation of the cargo 
in 2018. The next step will be to conserve 
the hull of the ship, which is still in the 
box that was used to lift it from the 
bottom of the sea. We keep the surface 
of water in this box at the same level 
as when it was excavated. A spraying 
water system helps us keep the top of 
the ship wet as well − it would get rifted 
if it dried. The shipwreck and the cargo 
will be desalted and dewatered within 
the next twenty or thirty years. There are 
conflicting opinions on how to preserve 
the wreck. Some have suggested 
dispatching the ship in parts. But then it 
can never be reassembled. Others are in 
favour of conserving the ship as a whole, 
like the Vasa in Sweden. 
Several exhibitions are being planned 
in China and abroad to raise public 
awareness of the wreck’s historical value.

For Erussard and his team, the time 
has come for action, not words, 
if we are to tackle global warming and 
the demographic and environmental 
challenges of the twenty-first century. 
The way we travel, feed ourselves, 
build our houses, work and inform 
ourselves – these are the questions that 
need answers today. “Innovative solutions 
are being developed all over the world. 
This expedition is an opportunity to build 
a community that transcends borders 
by finding solutions and connecting them 
to each other,” adds Jérôme Delafosse, 
a professional diver and documentary 
filmmaker on nature and biodiversity, 
who is head of the expedition.
The world’s fastest yacht 
The adventure began in 2013, 
when French navigator Frédéric Dahirel 
recovered one of the fastest yachts 
in the history of offshore racing. In 1984, 
it  broke through the symbolic barrier 
of 500 miles in twenty-four hours. 
And in 1994, it enabled the famous 
New Zealand yachtsman, Sir Peter Blake, 
to set the round-the-world record, 
after having withdrawn from racing 
to devote himself to environmental 
exploration.
Around the globe in the world’s first 
clean‑energy
ship
by Virginie Jourdan 
On 26 June 2017, Energy 
Observer, the first ocean‑going 
ship to be powered by hydrogen 
and renewable energy sources, 
set sail from France on a 
round‑the‑world journey lasting 
six years. In partnership with 
UNESCO, the vessel criss‑crosses 
the oceans, stopping at 
101 ports in fifty countries, 
raising awareness − among 
the public and local authorities 
− of the value of clean energy 
and sustainable development. 
Sailing with no greenhouse gas 
or fine-particle emissions, using 
only renewable energy − this is the 
challenge taken up by the French-built 
Energy Observer, the first vessel to be 
self-sufficient in energy. It left the port 
of Saint-Malo (France) on 26 June 2017 
on a round-the-world voyage lasting 
until 2022, without a single drop of fossil 
fuel on board. 
This real-life experiment will test 
the efficacy of solar and wind energy, 
and the production of hydrogen from 
sea-water. But beyond this technical 
achievement, Victorien Erussard 
− an officer in the French merchant 
navy and one of the project’s initiators 
− and his crew want to meet the creators 
of innovative technological solutions to 
“show that there is a path to clean and 
sustainable energy”.

Current affairs
Dahirel’s dream was to build the 
first French vessel powered by 
wind-generated electricity. This was 
symbolic. In 2015, he was joined 
by his sailing partner, Erussard. 
Then, a meeting with the French 
Alternative Energies and Atomic 
Energy Commission (CEA) and the 
Laboratory for Innovation in New 
Energy Technologies and Nanomaterials 
(CEA-Liten) gave the project a new 
direction. The challenge was to explore 
a new technology − the use of hydrogen 
as an energy source.
A floating laboratory
It took two years to get the yacht 
ready. Two electric motors replaced 
the mainsail and jib. Two wind turbines 
and solar panels were installed on its 
sides. In the middle, a twenty-metre-wide 
power kite can be deployed. 
Two hydrogen generators operate 
under the hull. Equipped with turbines, 
they use the hydraulic force generated 
by the yacht’s motion to produce 
electricity. This powers the yacht’s engine, 
on-board energy needs, and steering 
and telecommunications equipment. 
The laboratory causes sluggishness 
− the yacht travels at eight to ten knots 
instead of the thirty knots it attained 
when it was racing.
Hydrogen: 
energy of the future 
The second innovation lies in the 
production of hydrogen without carbon 
dioxide emissions. Hydrogen is seen 
as a future solution for the storage of 
carbon-free wind and solar energy. 
This gas does not occur naturally in its 
pure state and so has to be produced. 
The Energy Observer researchers opted 
for an environmentally-friendly solution 
– sea-water. “Today, ninety-five per cent 
of the hydrogen used in the world is 
manufactured using fossil fuels, like 
natural gas, which is highly polluting. 
We want to demonstrate that ‘carbon-free’ 
hydrogen can be produced,” explains 
Nicolas Degorce, a naval engineer who 
helped design the yacht. 
About thirty researchers at CEA-Liten 
worked for two years to create 
a hydrogen chain capable of resisting 
the extreme conditions encountered 
at sea. They were aided by engineers, 
transport specialists, naval architects 
and new technologies, as well as private 
enterprise. “About twenty prototypes 
have been developed. This is a wonderful 
opportunity to take them out of the 
laboratory and test them,” adds Degorce. 
In the holds and on the bridge, 
700 electronic sensors record 
the behaviour of the various pieces 
of the energy jigsaw puzzle in real 
time − wind, solar, hydro-electric and 
hydrogen. The researchers then use this 
data to try to optimize performance. 
Designed as a smart grid, this system 
of combined renewable energy could 
one day be used in homes, factories 
and on board cargo ships. It could also 
help prevent the energy exclusion 
of the 1.2 billion people in the world 
who still live without access to electricity.

A media ship 
for the planet 
It will take more than technological 
achievements to secure a better future, 
though. With the Energy Observer, 
mariners hope to help the public 
gain a better understanding of the 
immediate risks of climate change 
and the need to preserve biodiversity. 
“I have been witnessing the impact of 
human activity on the planet for twenty 
years,” says Delafosse. “This expedition 
is an opportunity to show what is 
really happening and to bring together 
positive initiatives from around the 
world.” His ambition is to make the Energy 
Observer a veritable media for the planet. 
“We want to nurture people’s dreams and 
raise their awareness, to let them discover 
the world as they have never seen it.” 
During the voyage, a series of eight 
documentaries will be made for a 
French television channel. Virtual reality 
and 3D content will also be created and 
shared on the internet and at various 
ports of call. The inner workings of the 
Energy Observer will be on view, as well 
as dives with sperm whales, to improve 
our understanding of the ways they 
communicate with one another. 
And one day perhaps we can share all 
of this information with schools around 
the world. 
This odyssey promises to be very 
fruitful. In the course of its 101 ports of 
call in fifty countries, the crew will pass 
through islands that are seeking to be 
self-sufficient in energy, like El Hierro 
in the Canary Islands (Spain); or model 
cities such as San Francisco, which has 
plans to become a zero-waste city. 
In partnership with UNESCO, twenty 
forays are planned in World Heritage 
sites and UNESCO Biosphere Reserves 
by 2022, such as the mud flats of the 
Wadden Sea in the Netherlands, and 
the Socotra archipelago in Yemen 
− home to around 700 species of 
plants and animals that are unique 
to this region. “We will be filming 
the sharks of Cocos Island off the coast 
of Costa Rica and the White Sea north 
of Russia − all these are little-known 
treasures that are nevertheless affected 
by human activity. This expedition 
is a marvellous opportunity to get 
to know our planet better,” enthuses 
Delafosse. “We want to share this 
knowledge through digital media and 
the meetings that we are organizing 
in major ports around the world.”
Virginie Jourdan is a freelance journalist, 
based in Rennes (France). After covering

International initiative
Called SMART Cables (Scientific Monitoring 
and Reliable Telecommunications), 
this JTF initiative aims to harness 
the vast network of submarine cables 
already in place, turning them into 
environmentally-aware “green cables”. 
An international effort in the truest 
sense, the JTF is made up of experts 
(many of them volunteers) from several 
dozen countries and 80 organizations 
representing science, observing system 
managers, industry, government agencies 
and sponsors. 
More than a million kilometres of 
submarine cables form the global 
telecommunications infrastructure 
backbone for business, finance, 
social media, entertainment, political 
expression, and science. Internationally, 
these cables are the physical layer of 
the internet. The dependability of this 
infrastructure is so important that entire 
national economies are affected when 
problems arise.
These same submarine cables could 
also provide a platform for gathering 
deep-ocean and seabed data for a range 
of environmental issues. Our oceans and 
climate are experiencing global changes, 
including warming, acidification, 
and sea-level rise, that affect us now 
and in the future. 
A standard telecommunication 
system includes an electro-optical 
seabed cable with optical repeaters 
approximately every sixty kilometres. 
By adding environmental sensors 
to the repeaters, we could have access 
to a global network of real-time data 
for environmental threats and disaster 
mitigation. 
An early-warning system for tsunamis 
could save lives and prove invaluable, 
particularly for developing countries, 
where the comprehensive coverage 
of all subduction zones is not viable. 
Since tsunami waves often arrive less 
than thirty minutes after offshore 
earthquakes, every minute counts.
To bring this concept to fruition, 
the international Joint Task Force 
of three United Nations agencies 
– the International Telecommunication 
Union, the World Meteorological 
Organization and the Intergovernmental 
Oceanographic Commission of 
UNESCO (ITU/WMO/IOC-UNESCO JTF), 
established in 2012, is working towards 
incorporating environmental monitoring 
sensors into trans-oceanic submarine 
cable systems. 
Harnessing submarine cables to 
save lives
by Bruce Howe and Kate Panayotou
Imagine environmental sensors 
spaced every sixty kilometres 
along the seabed, providing 
much‑needed data to better 
understand natural threats, 
such as tsunamis and climate 
change. With SMART Cables, 
a global network of real‑time 
data for disaster mitigation may 
soon become a reality.
With this article, the UNESCO Courier 
marks the 2nd World Tsunami Awareness 
Day, on 5 November.

Current affairs
It calls upon the private sector, 
governments, scientists, philanthropic 
foundations and the internet-using 
public to recognize this extraordinary 
need and opportunity, and to take 
concerted action to make this system 
a reality.
The installation of SMART Cables requires 
access to the sea-floor and the deepest 
ocean, which today is literally “owned” 
by the telecommunications private 
sector. The cables traverse the global 
ocean floor, crossing several national 
boundaries – throwing up a bewildering 
array of legal, technical and financial 
complications.
Therefore, unique new partnerships 
and collaborations must be established 
to enable this SMART cable vision. 
The engagement of the private sector, 
including internet companies which are 
newly investing in submarine cables, 
could directly address financial and legal 
issues, and the permitting process. 
Growing consensus
Through a series of meetings 
and workshops with academic 
and government scientists and 
the telecommunications industry, 
a growing consensus is being reached 
to assuage the hurdles facing SMART 
systems. Scientific and societal needs 
are being documented, and the legal 
framework under the UN Convention 
on the Law of the Sea, and technical 
feasibility have been produced. 
Today, only a fraction of these 
telecommunications cables are being 
used for scientific purposes. 
Environmental oceanic observation 
systems, owned and operated 
by academia and government agencies 
already exist, but they are utilized 
only over short distances and used 
for research purposes.
The concept of a “wet demonstrator” 
system suitable for deployment and 
medium-term operation has been put 
forth to address the effectiveness and 
practicality of the SMART approach. 
A pilot system has been proposed in 
the South Pacific, linking several islands. 
Technological advances have 
made it possible to integrate basic 
sensors with repeaters on submarine 
telecommunication cables at a small 
fraction of the total cost of a new cable 
system deployment. The unit cost of 
a single sensor package is expected to be 
around $0.2 million, so a modest system 
such as the proposed pilot should be 
under $10 million, with an expected life 
of twenty-five years. 
No ocean-aware underwater 
telecommunications system is in place 
today. The deep-ocean data from SMART 
Cables could bridge a fundamental gap 
in our knowledge. The time is ripe to 
begin a future with SMART systems. 
Crew members load an optical repeater 
(in the wooden cradle) on the deck 
of Pierre de Fermat, a cable ship belonging 
to France’s Orange Marine company.
Bruce Howe (USA) develops ocean 
observing sensor network infrastructure, 
including cable systems. He currently 
serves as Chair of the JTF SMART 
Cable initiative, and is a professor at 
the University of Hawaii, Department 
of Ocean and Resources Engineering.
Kate Panayotou (Australia) is a 
principal environmental scientist with 
seventeen years’ experience in the 
coastal, marine, estuarine, environmental 
and stakeholder engagement sectors. 
She has worked in the submarine cable 
industry for over a decade.

The project’s overall focus is to 
develop tools and strategies to 
benefit pre-kindergarten to secondary 
education, post-secondary education, 
health and social services and  
the NGO/community sector. It aims to 
help those facing barriers to achieve 
their potential in the personal, 
academic and professional domains.
The second King Sejong Prize 
went to We Love Reading (Jordan), 
a programme with a virtual community 
that offers online read-aloud training 
for parents, mobilizes volunteers to read 
aloud in community spaces to children 
and provides age-appropriate material 
through a digital library. After working 
in public libraries in the United States, 
its founder, Rana Dajani, realized 
the urgency of building libraries 
in Jordan – with the goal of “a library 
in every neighbourhood”. It also 
launched a programme in the Za’atari 
Refugee Camp for Syrian refugees 
in northern Jordan, training volunteers 
to become story-tellers for children.  
The three awards of the UNESCO 
Confucius Prize for Literacy, supported by 
the Government of the People’s Republic 
of China, reward work that benefits rural 
populations and out-of-school youth, 
particularly girls and women. 
This year’s winners are: the AdulTICo 
programme of the Secretariat of 
Information and Communications 
Technologies of the city of Armenia 
(Colombia), for teaching digital 
competencies to seniors; The Citizens 
Foundation (Pakistan) for its Aagahi 
Adult Literacy Programme, which 
conducts digital educational needs 
assessments and provides teaching 
services for women and out-of-school 
girls; and the FunDza Literacy Trust 
(South Africa), a non-profit group 
dedicated to improving literacy among 
teenagers and young adults. 
AdulTICo has helped thousands 
of seniors in Armenia, Colombia, 
to develop skills connecting them 
to the modern world. “Overcoming 
illiteracy in new technologies opens 
a lot of opportunities for many of us, 
like staying in touch with our relatives 
abroad,” declared Rosa Barragán, 
one of its most experienced students.
The Aagahi programme provides 
education to the less privileged, 
including women and girls. The word 
aagahi, in Urdu, one of Pakistan’s official 
languages, means creating awareness.
The FunDza Trust sees education as 
the basis of a healthy society and literacy 
as central to this. It develops literacy 
by growing a community of readers 
and writers among its target audience. 
It has four outreach programmes: 
popularizing reading by getting print 
books to young people; growing 
communities of readers, using mobile 
phones, among other things; developing 
young writers through its FANZ section; 
and providing an online curriculum that 
deepens reading practice.
For half a century, UNESCO International 
Literacy Prizes have rewarded 
individuals and civil organizations 
who have achieved excellent and 
innovative goals in the field of literacy. 
Over 475 projects and programmes 
have been recognized since 1967.
On the occasion of International 
Literacy Day (8 September), 
Irina Bokova, Director‑General, 
awarded five UNESCO 
International Literacy Prizes 
at a ceremony, following 
the recommendations 
of an international jury.
This year’s prizes and celebration 
focused on Literacy in a Digital World. 
It brought together stakeholders 
and decision-makers from around 
the globe to examine how digital 
technology can help close the literacy 
gap, and to help people gain better 
understanding of the skills needed 
in today’s societies. 
One of two awards of the UNESCO 
King Sejong Literacy Prize − dedicated 
to mother-tongue literacy education 
and training and sponsored by 
the Republic of Korea − went to 
the Centre for the Study of Learning 
& Performance (CSLP) at Concordia 
University (Canada). The award 
was given to its “Using Educational 
Technology to Develop Essential 
Educational Competencies in 
Sub-Saharan Africa” project, which 
develops and distributes its materials 
internationally, and free of charge.

Youth leaders and individuals 
from around the world gather 
for the sixth annual Global Media 
and Information Literacy (MIL) Week 
2017 from 25 October to 1 November, 
at the University of West Indies, Jamaica. 
Entitled “Media and Information 
Literacy in Critical Times: Reimagining 
Ways of Learning and Information 
Environments”, the celebration kicks off 
on October 24, with youth engaging 
in thematic panels and workshops 
as part of the Global MIL Youth Agenda.
Living in the so-called post-truth era, 
how are people, particularly youth, 
to respond to challenging issues 
such as misinformation, fake news, 
sensationalism and alternative facts? 
UNESCO advocates that youth build 
creative network learning to bridge 
the significant gaps between learning 
in formal education environments 
and learning in other environments – 
including social media, movies, pop 
culture, the media, community centres 
and places of worship. 
“The new information age is boundless; 
the mode of knowledge acquisition is 
vastly different from those of previous 
generations,” said Adama Lee-Bah, head of 
GAPMIL’s youth committee. “Young people 
tend to reject spoon-fed education 
and prefer to pursue knowledge through 
exploration and discovery.”

It’s that time of year again, when the halls 
and corridors of UNESCO are buzzing 
with activity. When young people 
gather to discuss and debate the most 
challenging issues of the day, and make 
recommendations about how UNESCO 
can better respond to their needs. 
The 10th UNESCO Youth Forum takes place 
on 25-26 October, at Headquarters in Paris, 
with a special pilot edition on “Rethinking 
Youth Engagement with UNESCO”.
The biennial initiative, which began 
in 1999, brings together a select 
group of the most engaged young 
change-makers from all over 
the world with UNESCO staff. 
Together, they examine concrete 
ways in which they can collaborate to 
ensure that UNESCO’s actions remain 
as pertinent and as impactful as 
possible. With the Youth Forum, UNESCO 
reiterates its commitment to remaining 
at the forefront of youth engagement.
There are currently 1.8 billion 
youth between the ages of 10 
and 24 in the world. This is the largest 
youth population the world has ever 
had. While the numbers present a huge 
potential for change, problems including 
political instability, climate change, 
challenging labour markets and limited 
opportunities for political and civic 
participation, have increased the pressures 
on young women and men everywhere. 
In response to these challenges, 
a new generation of young 
change-makers has emerged. They are 
working on innovative solutions 
to resolve some of the biggest issues 
affecting youth today − and the planet, 
more broadly. Young peace-builders 
are emerging from the world’s 
conflict-torn regions, keen on equipping 
their nation’s youth with conflict 
resolution skills. The climate change crisis 
is leading to the rise of outspoken young 
environmental activists, challenging 
their governments to ditch plastic 
and develop sustainable solutions.
All over the world, we’re seeing 
the emergence of young social 
entrepreneurs, policymakers, researchers, 
teachers and civil society leaders 
whose innovative spirit and vital insight 
could potentially have a huge impact 
on UNESCO’s youth actions.

A regrettable mistake occurred on page 70 of the July-September 2017 issue 
of the UNESCO Courier, where the name of the People's Republic of China 
was inadvertently truncated.  We apologize for this mistake, which has been 
corrected in all the languages and formats in which the Courier is published.

Accountability in education: 
Meeting our commitments
ISBN 978-92-3-100239-7  
434 pp., 21.5 x 28 cm, paperback, € 45
The second in the new GEM Report series, 
the 2017/8 Report, continues its assessment 
of progress towards the Sustainable 
Development Goal on education (SDG 4) 
and its ten targets.
The Report also investigates 
accountability‑related issues in 
education, analyzing how all relevant 
actors – the international community, 
governments, teachers, schools, parents, 
students, civil society and businesses – 
can provide education more effectively, 
efficiently and equitably, and address global 
commitments to SDG 4.
By analyzing which accounting policies 
and practices are more effective than others, 
and the political, economic and social 
conditions that facilitate the effectiveness 
of accountability mechanisms, the 2017/8 
GEM Report concludes with concrete 
recommendations for policymakers working 
in the sector.

Culture: Urban future
Global Report on Culture 
for Sustainable Urban 
Development
ISBN 978-92-3-100170-3  
304 pp., 21 x 29.7 cm, PDF 
Publication available on  
http://unesdoc.unesco.org 
Today, more than half of the world’s 
population lives in an urban environment. 
It is expected that the exponential 
population growth and urbanization of 
the world will make seventy per cent of 
humanity live in cities in the next thirty years.
Culture is a key tool for promoting 
sustainable urban development 
– by preserving urban, environmental and 
cultural identity, attracting activities and 
visitors, fostering the development of the 
creative economy and of the quality of life.
This Report presents an up‑to‑date picture 
of the current policies and practices of urban 
regeneration and sustainable development 
that have put culture at their core.
It is intended as a policy framework 
document to support governments in 
the implementation of the 2030 Agenda 
for Sustainable Urban Development 
and the New Urban Agenda.
