COUNTRY HOME OF
A ROMAN EMPEROR
© Angelo Frontoni, Rome
Recent excavations have revealed fabulously beautiful artistic treasures with which the Roman emperor
Hadrian adorned the great villa and gardens he constructed near Tivoli, some 18 miles to the east of Rome.
Here, where Hadrian planned to spend his last years, an army of artists, sculptors, architects and builders
recreated in miniature many of the monuments and places which had impressed the emperor during his journey¬
ing through the provinces of his empire. The mighty wall 30 feet high, shown here, which was built to enclose
the gardens, was decorated with pillars and porticos. At the far end are remains of the Hall of the Philosophers.

THE OCEAN DEPTHS,
TERRA INCOGNITA
by Dr. Gerald Wendf
To man, the seas are a challenge which in magnitude
approaches that of space. He has at least been able to
observe the moon, planets and stars directly with tele¬
scopes and has sent rockets curving out into space as far
as and far past the moon. Yet the ocean depths, shrouded
in darkness, have been obscured from his view.
Man's knowledge of the oceans is meagre indeed when
compared to their importance to him. Yet he has learned
enough to know the major features of the ocean floor
trenches 33,000 feet deep, flat-topped undersea mountains,
2,000 mile long fracture zones and deepest plains as flat
as a calm sea features which are uniquely différent from
anything either on the surface of the moon or on the
earth's land surfaces.
He knows too that the more than 300 million cubic miles
of waters which cover nearly three-quarters of the
earth's surface conceal a myriad of wonders, from a fan¬
tastic variety of living matter to detailed records of earth
and life history which are hidden in the sediment of
the ocean deeps.
Oceanography, the science of the oceans which groups
many sciences and encompasses the study of all aspects
of the oceans, their boundaries and their contents, has
made more rapid progress in recent years as it has come
in for a greater yét still inadéquate; share of the re¬
sources with which man searches for greater under-
stanlding of himself, his origins and the universe in which
he lives.

in height and about 75 miles in width. Largest task for oceanograph-

ers is to map the geography of the entire sea bottom70 per cent
of the earth's surface. The New York Congress marked the start of
an all-out investigation of the earth's last great unexplored frontier.
The demonstration that oceanography has passed from
blind exploration and accidental discovery into
a full-fledged science bent on a systematic investi¬
gation of the last great frontier of this planet, came with
the first International Océanographie Congress, held at
United Nations Headquarters in New York, this year.
The Congress drew over 1,100 scientists from some
45 nations, included more than 500 scientific papers in
its programme, and during its two-week session seven
océanographie research vessels, the Mikhail Lomonosov
of the Soviet Union, the Calypso of France and five
American ships, the Atlantis, Chain, Pathfinder, Maury
and Gibbs, were anchored close by in New York harbour.
The Congress was convened by the American Associa¬
tion for the Advancement of Science, with the United
Nations as host, and was co-sponsored by Unesco for its
International Advisory Committee on Marine Sciences and
by the International Council of Scientific Unions (ICSU)
through its Special Committee on Oceanic Research. The
President of the Congress was Dr. Roger Revelle, Director
of the Scripps Institution of Oceanography of the Univer¬
sity of California, who is a member of the Unesco
committee and Chairman of the ICSU committee.
At the Congress the marine sciences and oceanic
research were publicly launched as a major world-wide
international scientific endeavour, comparable with ato¬
mic energy, the International Geophysical Year and the
exploration of space, but of direct interest to more nations
and involving more individual sciences. Almost from the
start, the Congress was referred to as the "first" one on
the ocean, in the assurance that others will follow and
that this marks the beginning of a concerted attack on
the problems and resources of the nearly three-fourths
of the earth's surface that is the common property of all
mankind and therefore the .proper province of the United
Nations and its various Agencies.
During the meeting, the Special Committee on Oceanic
Research announced a major international research pro¬
ject for the years 1960 to 1964, somewhat on the model
of the International Geophysical Year, for a thorough,
co-ordinated study of the Indian Ocean by twelve research
vessels that will be provided by Australia, France, India,
Japan, South Africa, the U.S.S.R., the United Kingdom
and the United States and perhaps by the German Federal
Republic and Norway.
The Indian Ocean, reaching from Indonesia to South
Africa, touches many lands whose present need of food
will increase with growing populations and can probably
best be met from the sea. Yet it is the least explored
of all the oceans and its resources are unknown. It is of
special scientific interest because twice each year the
monsoons reverse its ocean currents and thus shift the
locations of the up-swelling waters from below that are
rich in the basic materials for the nutrition of fish.
In addition, the ocean is thought to be crossed by a
submerged mountain ridge that curves from below the
tip of Africa to the Pacific, passing between Australia and
Antarctica but branching to send a ridge northward

OCEAN DEPTHS
TERRA INCOGNITA
(Continued)
Continents of Europe & America
are found to be drifting apart
towards the Red Sea. Every oceanic science will benefit
from this study, but the practical hope is that a solution
Will be found for the puzzling fluctuation in the popula¬
tions of food fish like mackerel and tuna.
The U.S. National Academy of Sciences and the Nation¬
al Research Council told the Congress that they consi¬
dered completely feasible a project for boring a four or
five inch hole all the way through the crust of the earth
where is is thinnest at the sea bottom, about 18,000 feet
below sea level, down to a depth of 31,000 feet where the
lighter crustal rocks end and the earth's "mantle" begins.
The deepest oil well yet drilled goes down about 24,300
feet and preliminary studies indicate that a much
deeper hole can be drilled even from the deck of a ship.
Two years will be required for the experimental drilling
of more shallow holes and for the development of special
equipment. Then a new deep-drilling vessel Will be built .
and at least two more years will be needed to reach the
dense hot rock of the mantle that comprises the main mass
of the earth. This project may help to answer questions
on the age of the earth's crust and the original forma¬
tion of the oceans. Adequate funds for it are, however,
not yet assured.
Radioactive 'rulers' measure
the age of the ocean bottom
A third important project was revealed at the Congress
by Dr. Y. Miyake of Tokyo in a report for a working
party of the Special Committee on Oceanic Research
of ICSU with recommendations for a world-wide study of
the radioactivity of the ocean waters in order to determine
the effect of the submarine disposal of radio-waste pro¬
ducts from nuclear reactors and laboratories. The report
recommended that the International Union of Geodesy
and Geophysics develop standard methods for the radio¬
active analysis of sea water and prepare a manual for
uniform and standard procedures by all nations.
The report also asked for the establishment of a world
wide network of testing stations on the shores of maritime
countries and on weather ships and whaling ships at sea
which would make a continuous record of the radio¬
activity and its changes at a large number of points on
all the oceans. A further recommendation was that the
International Atomic Energy Agency in Vienna should
make a study of the maximum permissible concentration
of oceanic radioactivity. There is no notable contamina¬
tion of the ocean as yet but the increasing number of
nuclear power plants make these preparations advisable,
in the opinion of the committee.
From the scientific point of view, two aspects of the
Congress were of especial significance. One was the reve¬
lation to many scientific workers of the large amount of
research in progress in other countries that had pre¬
viously been unknown to them even in their own field
of study. Another was a fresh realization of the value,
as cross-fertilization, of work in different fields. The
Congress included geologists, paleontologists, hydrogra¬
phers, geophysicists and geochemists, meteorologists,
nuclear physicists, physical chemists, biochemists, bota¬
nists, zoologists and many others.
Discoveries or new methods in one field repeatedly
proved to be of great value in others. For instance, the
highly specialized methods of determining the age of the
radioactive isotopes of carbon, hydrogen, beryllium, silicon
and ionium have made it possible to develop a reliable
time-scale for determining the age of ocean-bottom sedi¬
ments, fossils and organic materials, the sequence of che¬
mical and biological processes, and flow of ocean currents.
Thus oceanography is not a science but the focus of
many sciences. Indeed, there was informal discussion at
the Congress of referring to it as oceanology instead of
oceanography. The latter term refers primarily to
charting and mapping, as in geography, and is two-
dimensional while oceanic research today is in depth,
both literally and metaphorically, and the third dimen
sion vertically is as important as it is in the exploration
of outer space.
The programme of the Congress was arranged in five
major divisions: the structure of the ocean basins and the
history of the oceans ; the geophysics and geochemistry
of the deep sea, including the currents and sedimenta¬
tion; the relation of the sea to its boundaries on the
bottom, at the land surface, and with the atmosphere;
the populations of the sea, including plants, animals,
plankton, deep-sea fishes, evolution, ethology and ecology;
and the cycles of inorganic and organic substances in
the sea.
Topics that aroused special interest at the Congress, in
addition to those already mentioned, included the
following:
Continents on the move. It is possible that there .is an
increasing separation of the American continent from
the European and African, at the rate of about one yard
per thousand years as a result of the continued bulging
of the crust and a further uplift of the mid-Atlantic
mountain ridge.
Where life began. It is probable that life did not ori¬
ginate in the sea itself but on the under-water clay sur¬
faces in estuaries and shallow bays where "chemical
evolution" took place for hundreds of millions of years at
a time when the atmosphere was poor in oxygen but rich
in hydrocarbons and perhaps ammonia. Increasingly
complex organic molecules were formed by contact in the
concentrated layers absorbed on the clay until amino-
acids resulted which then combined to give proteins
Which were able to duplicate their own molecules. After
that, organization of the proteins into cells became possi¬
ble and biological evolution could begin. The oxygen
in today's atmosphere would prevent such chemical evo¬
lution but the same process may well occur on the astro¬
nomical number of possible planets belonging to stars
other than the sun.
Older than fossils. The earliest fossils found anywhere
show that evolution must already have been going on for
long periods of time without leaving a trace. The expla¬
nation of this is that the earliest animals were plant-
eaters with soft bodies; it was the much later appearance
of carnivorous animals that forced the protective develop¬
ment of shells and skeletons which form fossils.
Equator stays put. It has been discovered that the rela¬
tively rich life in the ocean near the equator, where the
upward currents bring nutrients, has laid down a conti¬
nuous band of sediments around the earth which indicates
that the equator has been where it is now for some
500 million years. Consequently, the poles have not
Wandered about and some other explanation is needed
for glacial periods.
World map of fish foods. The value of a map of the
distribution of plankton, the microscopic plants and ani¬
mals that are the basic food for all higher sea animals,
in locating fishing grounds has been demonstrated. Such'
a map has been prepared for the North Sea by the
Scottish Océanographie Laboratory and has permitted the
transplantation of food fishes to better feeding grounds.
The preparation of a world plankton map to increase the
fish harvest was recommended since there are large areas
in the sea that are virtually "deserts".
Grunt of love. The study of the social habits of codfish
has revealed a grunting noise made by the male during
courtship which can be picked up by hydrophones and
used to locate schools of cod.
Strange forms of life. The evolution of queer and even
fantastic varieties of fish in the deep sea is explained by
the absolute and enduring uniformity of the environment
which permits mutation to proceed for milions of years
with no change in the weather, nutrients, or other condi¬
tions which might serve to eliminate forms that are
unable to adapt.
Giant eels 100 ft. long? The discovery has been made
in the tropics of giant eel larvae, six inches long instead
of the usual fraction of an inch. This may mean that
mature giant eels 100 feet long may actually exist and

Blood types in fish distinguish

of species, including "living fossils", may yet be found
because the larger, swifter or more intelligent ones may
escape present methods of bringing them to the surface.
They may even be sensitive to the sound Waves used by
trawlers to locate schools of fish and thus evade capture.
Ocean level rising. Sea level is now at least 300 feet
below where it was before the first glacial age some
400,000 years ago, perhaps because of the accumulation
of ice on the Antarctic continent. But at the peak: of the
last ice age, about 10,000 years ago, the level of the sea
was about 300 feet below its present mark. Then
a sudden warming and rise in the ocean level occurred
and is still going on. If all the ice in the Antarctic
should melt by continued warming the level of the ocean
would rise at least 180 feet more to drown most present
coastal plains. This could happen within the next
10,000 years.
Blood typing of fish. In whales, seals, salmon, herring
and sardines different blood types can be detected that
distinguish various ethnic groups from others of the same
species. They can be tested with rabbit serum just as
human beings are. This permits the identification of
individual "populations", or schools, from others and
could be used to follow their migrations and perhaps to
explain their mysterious disappearance from fishing
grounds.
O Fish chemistry. Sea plants and animals produce a
wide variety of special chemical substances such as vita-

mins, antibiotics, growth stimulants and hormones which
may themselves be valuable to man and which, with fur¬
ther study, could explain the occasional explosive growth
of some varieties and also the catastrophic death of
millions of tons of fish, apparently by disease, at some
times and places.
The restless depths. Deep sea waters are not stagnant.
They are in motion with currents that have a speed of
about half a mile per hour in some cases and are accom¬
panied by turbulence. Objects dropped to the bottom
(including radioactive' waste) are certainly not dropped
into a stagnant, unchanging resting place. Academician
L.A. Zenkevitch of the Institute of Oceanology of the
U.S.S.R. confirmed this picture of restless depths of the
sea. His ten-year study of the hundreds of species of
tiny sea animals showed a constant vertical mixing of
ocean waters so that species that normally live at depths
below four miles can be found at all levels, even up to
the surface. Strong currents can be detected even in
the very deep trenches near the Kuriles and Marianna
island chains that sink a mile or two beneath the great
plains of the sea bottom.
Dr. Columbus O'D. Iselin of Harvard University, until
recently Director of the Woods Hole Océanographie Insti¬
tution in Massachusetts, U.S.A., reviewed the large num¬
ber of unsolved problems that the Congress had revealed
and predicted that, with the upsurge of oceanic research
that the Congress had certainly stimulated, vast new food
supplies would become available for the ever-growing
population of the earth. The present "hunting" of fish
will be replaced by "farming" when effective fences can
be devised to retain them, when "'weed" plants and ani¬
mals can be eliminated in favour of valuable varieties,
and when the growth of fish, both in size and in numbers,
can be stimulated by the effective fertilization of sea
water, probably by bringing up nutrients from deep
waters by control of the ocean currents.
He also predicted control of weather and climate
through an understanding and control of the ocean cur¬
rents. The economic, social and political problems raised
by such developments will be a challenge to international
law. The future of the oceans, he said, is a prime concern
to the United Nations and its Agencies, properly sym¬
bolized by the fact that this first international océano¬
graphie congress was also the first scientific meeting
ever to be held in the headquarters of the United Nations.

BERG PATROL IN ACTION. The International Ice Patrol
which operates in the region of the Newfoundland Grand Banks
is constantly seeking new ways to combat the menace of icebergs
to shipping. Air photos here were taken during tests made
at the height of the 1959 heavy ice season to determine whether
intense heat of bombs can hasten breaking and melting of bergs.

cluster of small bomblets, each capable of burning at a tempe¬
rature of 4,300 degrees F., riding under wing of amphibian air¬
craft to iceberg target, right. (Temperature of one bomblet

hit by two thermite bombs two days later. The International
Ice Patrol which came into being in 1914, is administered on
behalf of other nations by the United States and carried out by
the U.S. Coast Guard from an H.Q. in Argentia, Newfoundland.

The Unesco Courier. December 1959
Icebergs are no longer the menace to the shipping of
the world that they once were, although they still form
a very real and difficult-to-overcome danger to safe sea
voyages in the North Atlantic. A floating iceberg is a
natural climatic hazard which man, with all his ingenuity and
resourcefulness, cannot control or entirely avoid. Progress
in the war against the iceberg threat to safety at sea has been
made possible only by using many of the resources of modern
science.
Whilst it is true that the peril of earlier days when icebergs
might inflict a sudden and terrible toll on ships of all kinds,
epitomized by the ghastly Titanic disaster of 1912, is much
reduced, these great seaborne mountains of polar ice are just
as numerous and as threatening as ever.
The vastly improved methods of marine radar and other
techniques of iceberg detection, now fortunately carried out
on an international basis, make the chances of collision very
much smaller than they were even twenty years ago. But
the price of this safety continues to be constant vigilance
backed by up-to-date scientific skill.
The North Atlantic and the sub-polar regions produce a
regular crop of icebergs that eventually move southwards.
They break off from the massive Greenland glaciers in large
numbers, some as long as several blocks of buildings and half
as high above the surface of the water. Some may break away
with the action of slightly warmer water from the vast
floating polar ice-cap, but most are really the tail-ends of
glaciers that have slowly but inexorably worked their way
down to the sea.
Three years adrift,
ranging 1800 miles
ON reaching the water, the glacier ends disintegrate into
many fragments, each of which is a potential iceberg
with a travelling range of several hundred miles. Every
year some 7,500 sizable bergs break off in this fashion, of
which roughly between 400 and 500 find their way south of
latitude 48° N. (Newfoundland). These are nearly all plotted
on their wayward courses, even though from the time of their
initial "calving" to their appearance in the steamer lanes three
years may elapse. In fact, many of the bigger bergs plotted
by the ice patrols are three-year-old specimens.
There are approximately 100 tidewater glaciers along the
west coast of Greenland, yet most of the annual iceberg crop
emanates from only 20 concentrated together. Few survive
further south than the Grand Banks, but those that do form
the greatest danger, carried along fairly swiftly by the Labrador
current. Whatever their origin, these fragments of Arctic ice
cannot be melted, held back, diverted or in any way destroyed
by man.
Many of the smaller specimens, camparative fragments
perhaps under 20 yards in length, are rarely seen by man at
all, for they melt before they drift down into the shipping
channels. But the bigger, true bergs contain such an
enormous volume of hard- ice that they can survive for up
to three years before succumbing to the warmer currents into
which they move all the time, covering distances as great as
1,800 miles. The enormous annual crop of bergs is thus
considerably reduced by about June of each year, but in a
bad season, such as 1939, they may remain a menace to
shipping as late as August.
The largest berg on record was seen by a grain ship in

BIRTH OF AN ICEBERG
Coastguard cameraman flying up Sondrestrom Fjord, Green¬
land, finds a glacier inching its tortuous way through the moun¬
tains. Forced along by the pressure of the tremendous Green¬
land icecap, glaciers move as much as 50 feet a day. During
the 1949 Iceberg Census Operation when this photo was taken,
40,232 icebergs were counted. Below, Ice air patrol catches
Jacobshavn Glacier (Greenland) in the act of depositing a giant
iceberg (arrow) into Baffin Bay fjord. This glacier is five miles
wide at its mouth and the iceberg which has broken off is judged
to be a mile across at the "break-off" point. Some of the other
bergs in the water are as large as several blocks of city buildings.

ICEBERG
(Continued)
Six-sevenths of the 'mountains
of ice' are hidden under water
I860, and was really a vast chunk of the polar ice-cap. It
was 53 miles long in one direction of its marked L-shape, and
30 miles along its other arm. Another one spotted in 1893
was over 50 miles long. Such monsters are literally ice-
islands and do not usually remain so large for long, breaking
up swiftly into numerous small pieces.
It is well-known that the visible portion of any iceberg is
only a small fraction of its total bulk, most of which lies
submerged, and various proportions for the amount of visible
ice are often given. Only recently has any scientific
experiment been made to ascertain the exact proportion of
visible to hidden ice, and for that the credit must go to the
Russian geomorphologist Andrei Kapitsa, working at Mirny,
in Antarctica.
Kapitsa had long been interested in the measuring of
icebergs and their underwater displacement, for he was not
entirely satisfied with the theoretical proportions generally
quoted. He was finally able to make a practical test in 1957,
when an air pilot discovered a large triangular berg with a
flat top instead of the usual rugged, fissure-covered surface.
It looked like a vast truncated triangle, about three-quarters
of a mile long and about 200 yards wide at its centre.
Water-level 'growlers'
most dangerous of all
Kapitsa's idea was to land on the surface ot the berg by
helicopter, and then make measurements by seismic
soundings. With several assistants he was able to
achieve this, after a narrow escape from a deep, snow-covered
fissure, on top of which the aircraft almost came to rest.
One member of the team, Boris Vtyurin, was lowered over
the precipice edge of the berg, and with a measuring-tape
established its height above the sea as 86 feet 3* inches.
HOW BIG IS AN ICEBERG? The visible portion of any iceberg is only a small fraction (one seventh) of its total bulk, most of
which lies submerged. Only recently have scientific experiments been made to confirm the exact proportion of visible to hidden ice.
The Russian scientist, Andrei Kapitsa, working from the research station set up at Mirny, in Antarctica,,during the International
Geophysical Year (1957-1958), solved the problem conclusively by taking seismic soundings from the giant iceberg shown below.

Seven holes were then made in the surface of the ice ana
filled with small charges of TNT, while other cavities were
made to house the seismic receivers. All the party except
Kapitsa then returned to the helicopter which took off before
he detonated the charges. An oscillograph film record of the
resultant explosion was made from the helicopter, and on it
a clear curve showed the boundaries at which the waves were
reflected from the bottom of the ice and also from the sea-bed.
From these it was a simple matter to ascertain the exact
measurements of the berg, which proved to be 636 feet 6
inches from top to toe. Therefore, approximately six-
sevenths of it were submerged, and from this experiment this
proportion may be taken as a fair guide to the volume of
invisible ice in any berg. This strange construction, by the
way, explains why no iceberg shows any signs of a sea roll,
even in the worst gale.
Most bergs continually split and break up, losing great
fragments from their ends, cracking and thundering ominously

in the process. Sometimes parts capsize and float
independently at varying angles in the water. Frequently
large areas of the sea may be filled with vast packs of small
bergs, known as "brash." These may subsequently be frozen
together again into a large floe.
As they weather away ordinary icebergs adopt the most
fantastic shapes, ebbing and veering, travelling now swiftly,
now slowly. At this stage, when about the size of a small
house, they are known as "bergy bits," and when further
melted away so as to be almost awash, as "growlers" the
greatest menace of all. These still have the large underwater
portion, usually in the form, at least in part, of a protruding
arm of ice hidden beneath the waves and extending beyond the
small area visible above the surface. This is known as the
"foot," and collisions with this invisible portion are the cause
of most disasters when ships encounter icebergs.

ICEBERG
(Continued)
World's heaviest sea traffic
crosses an ice-ridden zone
Almost all bergs are objects of great beauty and of no
little scientific interest. The largest may. project 300 feet or
more out of the water, and almost all rise to some kind of
a peak. Their ice is often age-old, dense and amazingly hard,
not translucent and clear like manufactured ice, but full of
minute air-bubbles which impart a shiny, intense whiteness,
not unlike glistening porcelain enamel. The amount of this
imprisoned air may reduce the total unit weight of ice, but
hundreds of moderately-sized bergs contain at least 30 million
tons of ice.
Parry and Ross, the famous Arctic explorers, once calculat¬
ed that a long berg they encountered 24 miles by 150 feet
high, contained some 1,500 million tons of ice. With some
realization of this bulk and solidity, it is easy to see why even
the largest steel ship stands little chance in a head-on collision.
Furthermore, a berg's large underwater portion renders it
more liable to drift with the current than with the prevailing
wind. Hence the uncanny and frightening way a great berg
may bear down on an approaching ship even when the wind
is against it.
'Titanic' disaster leads
to international action
For centuries North Atlantic look-outs have been trained
to spot bergs under all conditions. At a look-out height
of say 70 feet a man can see a berg on a clear day at
a distance of 18 miles. A low-lying haze on a clear day
reduces this to 8 or 9 miles. In light fog or drizzle 1 to 3 miles
visibility is a good average. At night, a look-out can see a
berg up to 3 miles away with a full moon, and only 400 yards
away with no moon. In dense fog, of course, a ship relying
upon visual spotting only may be within yards of a big berg
without seeing it.
Fortunately, much of the responsibility of iceberg spotting
and plotting is now in the hands of the International Ice
Patrol, which came into being in 1914 after the Titanic
disaster as a result of universal demand. By various inter¬
national agreements since then the Patrol is administered for
the universal good by the United States Government and
carried out by the U.S. Coast Guard (founded in 1790). Many
marine nations contribute towards its upkeep on a "pay-as-
you-benefit" basis, among them Canada, France, Italy, Greece,
Belgium, Norway, Denmark, Sweden and the Netherlands, as
well as the United States and Great Britain.
Fast cutters keep
a vigilant patrol
The Coast Guard commences its ice observation and
patrol service immediately the presence of bergs
threatens shipping safety, usually in February, and
covers an area roughly the size of Pennsylvania and in the
general region of the Newfoundland Grand Banks. During
much of the ice season, from April to luly, this region is
blanketed by dense fog caused by the confluence of the warm
Gulf Stream and the cold Labrador current. Yet through it
passes the world's heaviest seaborne traffic.
Aircraft, radar and loran (Long Range Radio Aid to
Navigation) are now all used for the most efficient detection
of these icebergs, but the two latter, excellent aids though
they are, remain supplemental and do not replace the need
for visual ice surveys. A vigilant and constant patrol by
aeroplanes and fast cutters is essential, and these are based
at Argentia, Newfoundland, where the International Ice Patrol
Commander has his H.Q. The aerial surveys are mostly
undertaken by Coast Guard-manned converted Douglas DC-
4s (4-engined land planes).
The specially-equipped cutters, like the USCGC Acushnet,
keep up a constant surface patrol. Information about ice,
growlers and bergs is collected by these patrol vessels, by the
aircraft and from sightings reported by civil ships and planes
operating in or crossing the danger area. All ships au¬
tomatically report every four hours their position, course,
speed, visibility, weather conditions and the sea temperature
to the IIP office, and so, from a mass of assorted data, a clear,
hour-by-hour picture of iceberg movement is built up.
Aerial reconnaissance augments poor surface visibility, and
vice versa, the Ice Patrol constructs isotherm charts to estimate
the melting rates of all known bergs, and wind and sea current
data is used to forecast probable drifts of dangerous ice.
Summarized data is broadcast by the IIP twice daily to all
shipping, which is then expected to plot its course well clear
of known bergs, to allow for possible inaccuracies and shifts
of wind or current. . Although 10 miles per day is the average
speed of drift, bergs have been known to shift 30-40 miles per
day for a week or more, so no chances can be taken.
A 20-foot cube of ice
sinks a fair-sized ship
Radar assists in locating large icebergs in poor visibility,
but smaller bergy bits and growlers may escape radar
detection if a heavy sea is running, and even a 20-foot
cube of ice can sink a fair-sized ship. Actually, the growler
menace today is not a great one, but is still exists. The use of
loran now offers the best way of checking the exact location
of all bergs and ice after they have been visually spotted, also
their daily movements. With the development of loran, fog
can no longer interfere with the work of the patrol vessels, as
was formerly the case.
In addition to its direct locating and reporting work, the Ice
Patrol Service constantly studies the overall ice and sea current
situation, the physical properties of sea ice, its drift, erosion
and melting, temperature and atmospheric conditions in ice-
ridden areas, the habits of seals and birds in relation to ice,
and so onall information designed to help the navigator and
bring him to terms of familiarity with every possible danger
from icebergs.
New ideas and discoveries for combating the sea ice menace
are constantly being employed. To safeguard shipping the
International Ice Patrol couples its unrelenting vigilance with
a desire to keep abreast of the latest scientific developments
and to use the latest equipment after it has been checked and
found suitable for this vital and humane work.

THE BLUE
SCAR by
Bertha Gaster
Two men were standing outside the local pub in a
small Yorkshire village. Inside could be heard the
clinking of glasses and a calling of toasts in broad,
Yorkshire dialect, interspersed with voices speaking some
foreign tongue. The two men stood there smiling in an
embarrassed manner at each other. Suddenly one of
them an elderly Yorkshireman of stocky appearance
rolled up his sleeve and pointed to a spattering of tiny
blue scars on his forearm. A warm grin of comprehension
slid over the younger man's face as he promptly pushed up
his own sleeve and displayed identical scars. A second
later both hands had met in a hearty clasp.
"Don't matter if they can't talk each other's language,"
grunted an old chap looking on. "Yon blue scar that's
coal dust the miner's mark the world over." By this time
the younger of the two had taken a small badge off his
coat and was pinning it to the coat lapel of the
Yorkshireman. He was a member of a group of Polish
miners paying a visit to British mines and mining
establishments at the invitation of the National Union of
Mineworkers (NUM), and the tiny badgea copper pin of
two crossed hammerswas the emblem of the Polish
miners' union.
Such exchanges of miners, railwaymen and other trade
union groups between different countries have been going
on for some time. "We had a French party down our pit
last week-end," said one of the Yorkshire miners, "and
early last week a German group came round." He might
have added that this type of group exchange has also been
organized. by Unesco since 1952, with the help of workers'
organizations, as part of its work for international
understanding and co-operation. The Polish group was
one of many which have taken part in study tours abroad
with the aid of a Unesco grant. In this case the Polish
miners were the guests of the NUM during the whole of
their stay in Britain, the Unesco grant covering return
travel from Warsaw to London. (See page 33 for news of
Unesco's workers study tours in 1959.)
By the time the fifteen members of the Polish group
had arrived in Yorkshire their heads and their notebooks
were full of the things
they had seen and done.
They had been taken on
a swift whirl of London
sights the day after
their arrival, ending with
a concert at London's
newest concert hall, and
followed the next day by
an expedition to the
National Coal Board's
Research Establishment
at Isleworth and a dis¬
cussion with the Presi¬
dent of the NUM, be¬
fore they all set off on a
four day tour of Scot¬
land which included a
visit to a colliery, to
local industries and to
miners' welfare homes,
with a day's tour of
Edinburgh thrown in.
One of them, a Pole
born and brought up in
France, who had return¬
ed to Poland with his
wife and children seven
years before, remarked
on the wide difference
between the very up-to-
date workings they had
POLISH MINERS don this tra¬
ditional costume on special occa¬
sions. The crossed hammers worn
on the plumed headdress and on
the collar are also the official
emblem of the Polish miners' union.

Photos: Polish Information Office, Paris, taken in the mines of Upper Silesia
seen in Yorkshire and the rather primitive mine they had
visited in Lanarkshire. "But they told us it was a very old
mine, and will be closed in some years' time."
They were all, of course, interested in the differences
between British mines and their own, and between one
British mine and another. "There's so much to see and
learn," said Wladyslaw Pelczynski, the leader of the group,
with a sigh, "a fortnight's far too short." "Don't ask us
our impressions," added another. "We've had to make
notes of so many thingson, people, and sights, and little
habits, and the way ordinary things are done they're
going to ask us all sorts of things when we get home, and
we simply haven't had any time to sort them out."
"What did I find most exciting?" said Jozef Mikolajczyk.
"On one of our journeys in Scotland we were driving by
the Firth of Forth and we saw as we passed the new
experimental drilling tower for undersea mining, sticking
up out of the water. It's the first of its kind, you know,
and I had read about it in our papers back home, but
never in my life had I expected to see itand here I was,
actually looking at it!"
"Back home" to these men meant the Polish mining
districts of Upper Silesia, Lower Silesia and Cracow. With
the exception of Wladyslaw Pelczynski, formerly in the
pits and now a trade union official, and another who was
a mining engineer, all the others were working miners,
straight from the pit face, and proud of their mining
ancestry.
Jozef Mikolajczyk had followed in the footsteps of his
father and grandparents in the pits of Upper Silesia.
Jozef Mikula, the Pole from France, who had been a miner
in the Pas-de-Calais, had gone back to the Polish
mines where his father and grandfather had worked
before him. But his son, he said, was planning to be a

doctor. "Must break tradition sometimes, mustn't we?"
he said with a smile. A young man spoke with pride of
his father: "Fifty years in the pitscould retire any day
he liked with the maximum pension but no, says he's
still good for a day's work."
Part of the tour laid on for them by the Yorkshire area
of the NUM was a day's trip to Blackpool, the famous
holiday resort for the north of England. The day's events
included a presentation of gifts from the NUM, an English
shirt for each man, a luncheon party at one of the big
hotels, a visit to the Lytham Convalescent Home for
Miners, run by the NUM where the whole party sat down
firmly to watch television and an evening at the circus.
The way to the convalescent home led down Blackpool's
famous Golden Mile of esplanade, elaborately decorated
for the summer season with Chinese ship and dragon
motifs. The Polish interpreter, Henryk Ostrowski, who
had come with the party from Poland, was kept busy
translating and explaining as the charabanc drove past
the gypsy booths, waxworks, fun fairs and whelk stalls
that lined the route, and the two enormous piers
stretching out to sea. Suddenly his face lit up, and he
pointed: "There's the old windmill!" he cried delightedly
"Still there!"
Interpreting from Yorkshire dialect
For Henryk Ostrowski it was a return trip. England
had been home to him in those years 'from 1940 to
1945 when so many Poles ¡had no home. The "Virtuti
Militari" medal which he wore proudly displayed on his
breast had been awarded for the six German i planes shot
down when a pilot in a Polish night fighter squadron in
England during the war. "I was stationed here in Black¬
pool part of the time," he said, "and in Bath and Exeter.
There's a family in Bath who 'adopted' me, just like a son,
during the war. I'm hoping I shall be able to stay an
extra week or so to go and see them again, and all the old
friends from war days. I was in Yorkshire, too, in Church
Fenton," he added. "That's why Yorkshire dialect doesn't
baffle me."
His familiarity with the Yorkshire speech was more than
put to the test the following morning, when the group
were present at a meeting of the local NUM branch of
Wombwell Main, the second oldest pit in Yorkshire. It
was held, according to common practice in England, in
an upper room of the local pub, and the fifteen Poles,
ranged along one side of the room, were welcomed in a
short speech by the chairman before the business of the
meeting began. It was the usual trade union meeting
known all over England, and beyond minutes, corres¬
pondence, executive report, branch business, local pit
questions, national questions of wages and policy, vigorous
debate from the floor, friendly interjections, hands raised
for voting for or against all in the broadest Yorkshire,
and the Polish miners shifted their chairs nearer and
nearer to the interpreter, anxious to follow as closely as
possible.
'English' Poles meet Polish counterparts
One particularly intent on missing nothing was young
Janusz Malecki, from the Ludwik pit at Zabrze, who
was full of questions when the meeting ended and
Yorkshire and Polish miners adjourned to the bar below
for exchanges over glasses of beer. "Your trade union
meetings are run quite differently from ours," he said.
"For instance, I noticed that a decision on various current
demands was taken on a delegate basis. Now we would
have had a popular meeting in the pit first to discuss it.
One of the last items on the agenda in Yorkshire was
another meeting but a meeting of a different kind. This
time it was not with Scots or English miners, but with
former countrymen of their own, some of the Poles who
had stayed on in England after the war and were now
working in English mines. A fair number of them still
lived in the hostel a disused army camp not far from
Barnsley where the meeting took place; but most of them
were settled in homes of their own by now, many with
English wives and children, and several of them came
from six or seven miles away to meet their compatriots.
The group had brought with them a fine vellum-bound
edition of the famous Polish classic "Pan Tadeusz" by
Adam Mickiewicz which was presented to the Polish
miners in Barnsley as a gift from the Polish miners'
union; in no time at all small groups were scattered all
over the big living room, exchanging information and
asking question with the interpreter this time taking a
well-earned rest from his duties. The "English" Poles
were eager to know about conditions and life in Poland
to-day, and quick to answer similar questions about Eng¬
land asked in turn by members of the
visiting party.
Two men suddenly smiled with
joyful . recognition at each other.
"He's from my village", cried the
"English" Pole, a burly laughing
fellow. "No, we never met, but you
know how it is in a small place, we've
passed each other in the streets a
thousand times when we were boys,
we both knew each other's face. He's
been telling me all the news the sort
of things one wants to know what
happened to old Teresa, and that the
shop at the corner has changed hands
you know."
As the talk slackened, someone
began to sing a mournful, haunting
melody. Another voice joined him,
then another, and soon the whole
room was singing together. "It's the
'Song of the Mountain Dweller',"
explained one of them, "one of the
best known and best loved songs of
the mining district."
The sound of the motor coach
starting up outside brought the sing¬
ing to an end. It was time to go.
There were hearty handshakes, last
minute messages called aloud, and
the coach drove away, rounded the
corner, and disappeared the begin¬
ning of the road back to Barnsley, to
London, to Poland a coachload of
miners going home to tell their pit
mates of things seen and heard, of
new ideas and experiences, and of the
friends and fellow miners they had
found over the sea.

MODEL FOR A
PARIS MODEL
Photo left, shows part of a preparatory model
which was used by the designers and cons¬
tructors of the Lilliput Paris which is to tour
the world. A careful study of perspective
was made so that visitors will get a truly
realistic impression of the Paris panorama.
To obtain this effect, buildings have been
given different scales according to their
distance from viewers. Monuments in the
front of the model, such as the Eiffel Tower,
the Institut de France, and the Bastille Column
(not seen here) are reduced to l/IOO of
their true size. Those in the middle distance,
are 1/250 life-size and the Church of the
Sacred Heart, crowning the hilltop of Mont¬
martre is smallest of all 1/500. Thus the
final impression will be comparable to the
photograph (above right) taken with tele-
photo camera from Mount-Valérien, some
six miles to the west of Montmartre.

LILLIPUT PARIS
ON A WORLD TOUR
S.F.O.M., Rueil-Malmaison (taken with tele-photo lens F.2440 mm.)
by Paul Almasy
The city of Paris will soon be off
on a world tour. Its famous
buildings and landmarks will
be packed up in cases and loaded into
railway waggons now being specially
adapted for the job, including one to
house the Eiffel Tower and the Notre
Dame Cathedral.
The Paris which will set off on this
tour early next year is, of course, a
miniature one on which work is now
being completed at Montreuil, a sub¬
urb of the French capital. For the
past year, five model designers and
artists have been working to repro¬
duce a Lilliputian version of the
familiar outlines of the City of Light.
Their finished work is something
of a large size in models for it weighs
about 20 tons and will cost the Paris
Municipal Council and the city's
Photos ©, reproduction prohibited
Chamber of Commerce some $25,000
to produce. So as to be able to repro¬
duce the most famous buildings on a
sufficiently large scale, the designers
have limited their work to the central
Paris area a triangle running north
from the Eiffel Tower towards the
Church of the Sacred Heart on the
hilltop of Montmartre and from there
southeast to the former site of the
Bastille.
The model, built under the direc¬
tion of designer René Poirot from
plans by architect Jean Leblanc, Will
show both the daytime and night¬
time faces of Paris. Lighting has been
installed so that the famous build¬
ings can be illuminated just as they
are in reality.
From the centre of the model will
sprout a steel column, some 12 feet
high. On it will be mounted a large
disk acting as the revolving stage of
a theatre in miniature. The stage will
be divided into 18 scenes depicting a
day in the life of Paris. It begins by
showing the bustling early morning
activity of the Halles, the central
food markets, takes the audience
through the highlights of the Paris
scene, and ends the following morn¬
ing with a ride on the last Metro
train. One scene will show celebra¬
tions of the T4th of July. Four hun¬
dred spectators will be able to see
each of these ten-minute shows.
Sweden will be the first country to
welcome Lilliput Paris in the city of
Gothenburg. After several weeks in
Sweden, Paris will go to London and
from there it will leave on an exten¬
sive world tour lasting several years.

UNICEF GREETING CARDS
ARE NOW AVAILABLE
This year's Unicef Greeting Cards are now available. Since 1950
when the United Nations Children's Fund (UNICEF) first Intro¬
duced its yearly greeting cards, millions of people have made
use of this pleasant and easy way to remember their friends while
helping sick and hungry children throughout the world. For each
penny profit on the cards UNICEF can provide enough vaccine to
protect one child against tuberculosis. Profits from a box of ten mean
that 3 5 children will get a glass of milk every day for a week...; ten
boxes will provide enough sulphone tablets to cure six leprosy victims.
Many world-famous artists have contributed their paintings as designs
for the cards, among them Dufy, Matisse and Miro. This year UNICEF
has put on sale ten different cards, all in colour, two of which are repro¬
duced here. Above, Dong Kingman's "Fountain of Peace", surrounded

ZAMENHOF
Father of Esperanto
by Françoise Niederhausen
Universala Esperanto-Asocio
Lazarus Ludovic Zamenhof
In the streets of the unhappy town of my birth, savage
men 'with axes and iron bars fell like wild beasts upon
peaceful citizens, whose only crime was that they
spoke another language and held another creed than
those savages."
The man who Wrote these lines was named Lazarus
Ludovic Zamenhof. You may not know his name, but
you certainly know his life's work, for Zamenhof was the
creator of Esperanto, an international language of
communication between peoples.
He was born a hundred years ago on December 15, 1859,
in Bialystok, a frontier city near the borders of Lithuania,
Poland and Byelorussia, where communities speaking
different languages and practising different religions lived
together, although not very happily.
Young Zamenhof was deeply affected by the prejudices
and the antagonisms stirring this minor tower of Babel.
Local officials were of the Orthodox faith and spake
Russian; the nobility were generally Roman Catholics and
spoke Polish; the peasants talked to each other in Lithua¬
nian or Byelorussian, while the Jewish shopkeepers spoke

inhabitants of Bialystok against each other.

express itself only in a dead language or in an adopted
one, these conflicts seemed very tragic. At a very early
age, young Ludovic developed the idea that a common
tongue would help to break down at least part of the
barriers separating people from one another.
This idea haunted him throughout his childhood and
adolescence: first in Warsaw where his parents moved in
1873 and where Ludovic attended high school, then in
Moscow where he studied medicine, in Vienna where he
took a course in opthalmology and in Warsaw again where
he set up a practice as an oculist.
Doktoro Esperanto
or 'he who hopes'
From his schoolmaster father, he had inherited a gift
for languages. He spoke three fluently: Russian,
Polish and German, and could read three others
freely: Latin, Hebrew and French (to say nothing of
Yiddish). He had a more cursory and theoretical know¬
ledge of English, Italian and several other tongues.
His knowledge of English and French convinced him
that a language could get along without the complicated
declensions and conjugations of the Slavonic tongues.
A careful study of Russian and German convinced him
that a wise choice of suffixes and prefixes could reduce
the size of the vocabulary considerably, while French and
German proved the usefulness of the definite article which
the Slavonic languages do not have.
His work led to the publication in 1887 of a textbook on
the "Lingvo Internacia" the international language
for which he used the pen-name, Daktoro Esperanto ("he
who hopes"). The book, whose publication was financed
by his future father-in-law as a wedding present,
explained the main characteristics of the "lingvo": a
vocabulary with its roots drawn mainly from the Romance
and Germanic languages; detachable prefixes and suffixes
added to these roots and serving for all grammatical
distinctions; and a very simple grammar consisting of
16 short rules. The language, moreover, was fully inde¬
pendent and had its own individuality.
In the following years, other textbooks were published
as Well as a dictionary and translations into Esperanto.
At the same time, the first supporters came on the scene :
first in Poland, then in Germany, Bulgaria, Russia, etc.
Soon, groups were forming everywhere. In 1894. an
important event occurred the support of Leon Tolstoy
who wrote in "Posrednik" : "After only two hours of study
I was able, if not to write Esperanto, at any rate to read
it freely." He urged everyone to learn this language
"because the sacrifice is so small and the eventual benefits
so great that no one should refuse to try it."
A common ground for
agreement among men
The movement was growing steadily. In Scandinavia,
England, France and elsewhere scholars were becom¬
ing interested in the experiment. In 1905, the first
Esperanto Congress was held at Boulogne-sur-Mer in
France. To attend it, Zamenhof and his wife travelled all
the way from Warsaw in a third-class railway carriage.
Zamenhof was awed and somewhat overwhelmed by his
stay in Paris: he was given an official reception at the
City Hall and decorated with the Legion of Honour, and
he dined on the Eiffel Tower with a group of world
famous scholars.
But even greater satisfactions were awaiting him at
Boulogne. Eight hundred men and women from thirty
countries had assembled there and all of them, whether
in their official statements or their private conversations,
were speaking Esperanto. The "lingvo internacia" had
become a reality and no one was more surprised than
Zamenhof himself.
The Boulogne congress gave him the opportunity of
stressing the moral and social importance of his work:
Esperanto was not an end in itself, but a means of contri¬
buting to a better understanding between peoples. It was
a step towards the unity of mankind.
The following year, he developed this idea at the
Esperanto congress in Geneva, stating his conviction that
the international language was a means of bringing men
together by breaking down the barriers between them.
He exalted the brotherhood of man which seemed to him
the only creed acceptable to all peoples and to all faiths.
Year after year, at Esperanto congresses, he explained his
ideas on tolerance and human rights.
This role of guide seemed so important to him that, in
1912, he renounced all honours and turned the linguistic
problems of Esperanto over to its Language Committee
whose job it was to survey the evolution of the language
and to give official approval to new words introduced
into it.
At the Congress of Races in London, in 1911, he pre¬
sented a report stressing that physical differences were
less important than those of language and customs. "Dis¬
cord among men", he said, "will never cease until they
grow accustomed to giving more importance to the word
'man' than to the words 'people' and 'race'." In his mind,
the peoples of the world were separated mainly by lan¬
guage and religious customs. To bring them together,
he suggested a neutral language and a neutral ethical
basis which would provide a common ground for agree¬
ment between all men of goodwill.
A 'lingvo internacia'
with 80,000 words
He meant to discuss this idea at the tenth Universal
Esperanto Congress in Paris when war broke out in
1914. To Zamenhof, this was a terrible blow, but he
continued to fight for his ideals. Back in Warsaw in 1915
he drafted a "Letter to Diplomats" in which he emphasiz¬
ed that the main duty of any future peace treaty would
be to guarantee to all races and minorities equality and
freedom in the countries in which they lived. This was
his last public act: he died on April 14, 1917.
Zamenhof had foreseen that Esperanto would evolve
and grow like any other living language. From a voca¬
bulary of 904 roots which could be used to form about
10,000 words (1887), it has grown to more than 80,000 words
based upon some 7,800 root words. Zamenhof himself
contributed greatly to enriching the language, not only
by his poems, speeches and articles, but also through his
translations into Esperanto of works by Gogol, Shakes¬
peare, Dickens, Molière, Hans Andersen, Goethe, Schiller,
Heine and Sholem Aleichem. His version of the Old Testa¬
ment which he translated in full was published after his
death in 1926.
Two world wars destroyed many Esperanto libraries and
organizations in Europe, but they were unable to stamp
out the language and the ideal which inspired Zamenhof.
Today, there are several million Esperanto speakers in the
world and its literature, both original or translated,
amounts to more than 50,000 volumes. There are chairs
or. courses in Esperanto in some thirty universities. The
language is taught in schools in twenty-two countries, to
say nothing of countless evening classes. Twenty radio
stations broadcast programmes regularly in the language.
"Esperanto," Zamenhof ones said, "knows neither weak
nor strong nations, privileged nor inferior peoples... All
of us equal on neutral ground, should consider ourselves
members of the same human family." To pay tribute to
this great vision, Esperantists from all over the world
met in Warsaw last August for their Universal Congress.

L etters to the Editor
GREAT PURSUIT OF SCIENCE
Sir,
That there be shortcomings in The
Unesco Courier is to be expected; they
occur in all things. They can be cor¬
rected. Recent articles, for example, on
Gandhi, Old Age and Mental Illness,
were one-sided and very weak because
they neglected some of the most pro¬
found and extensive research done in
the fields of bio-physics, bio-chemistry,
especially the cerebral cortex, and the
experiences of social development.
However, let no shortsighted criticism
and snobbery deter the outstanding role
of our Courier. Particularly indispen¬
sable is the worldwide scientific know¬
ledge written in popular language.
And at this time of the Darwin Cen¬
tennial, The Unesco Courier can hold
its banner high as it carries on the great
pursuit of scientific thought. Our family
of six, our relatives and many friends
consider this magazine a necessary aid
to life in this era.

RADIOACTIVE WASTE DISPOSAL
Sir,
It surprised me that Professor Gorsky
(Is the Ocean in Danger? luly/August
1959 issue) did not make the least men¬
tion as to how his own country, the
Soviet Union, disposes of its radioactive
waste products.

STORY OF SCOUTING
Sir,
Would it be possible for you to devote
a part or whole of one of the issues to
the Boy Scout Movement? This organi¬
zation as you know appeals to youth the
world over. I am sure your magazine
will not miss a chance of showing the
world how a boy scout helps in its
work.

LANGAGE BARRIER TO AMITY
Sir,
lust recently I had the pleasure of
learning about your publication, The
Unesco Courier, and about the broad
humanitarian programme which you are
promoting. In a world which is so tra¬
gically split apart by suspicion and
hatred and conflicting interests, it is
encouraging to know that a programme
based on conciliation and co-operative
endeavour is bring promoted.
Along with my good friend, Mr. Har¬
din, of the International Language
Review and with others who are active
in the newly organized International
Language Association, I am convinced
that the language barrier is one of the
most serious hazards to cultural co-op¬
eration throughout the world and it is
my sincere hope that you will give some
thought to this aspect of the problem.
If we are to prevent a more deep-
seated deterioration of the world pic¬
ture, then we must seek the broadest sort
of approach to the present crisis.

HOW TO WIN READERS
Sir,
I found The Unesco Courier so
interesting that I showed it to other
members of the Medical Physics Depart¬
ment at my university, expecting that it
would interest one or two of them at
least. The result was quite staggering,
and I can now forward 12 names, includ¬
ing my own, to you as people who
would like a year's supply of the maga¬
zine, starting if possible with the next
issue.

TRULY BRAVE NEW WORLD
Sir,
One of the lovely aspects of your
magazine is the way it liberates one
from a childishly egoistic and rather
messy world, by showing its immensity,
the tremendous amount that has to be
done, that can be done, and that one
can do. In other words it is not such a
stinkingly pessimistic, aimless and
crushing place, but an exquisitely, pre¬
cariously balanced one, in which you
feel needed and wanted, giving it a won¬
derful tinge of hope and meaning for
one and all.
I believe you should include in "The
Unesco Newsroom" more notes on the
needs of peoples in different parts of the
world, such as: doctor needed in Tim-
buctoo; school teacher in Oman; assis¬
tant required in...

BRIDGE OF CREATIVE WRITING
Sir,
As a regular reader of The Unesco
Courier and as a writer I must voice
my appreciation of the interesting arti¬
cles found within its pages. But I
would also like to voice my dismay at.
seeing no space provided for creative
work such as short stories and poems.
It seems to me that if the scope of
your publication were expanded to
include creative writing, it would give
the people of the world a wonderful
opportunity for sensing their funda¬
mental kinship, despite difference in
customs, colour or creed. Through
reading writers as far apart as Rio de
laneiro, Moscow, Tokyo, Saigon,
London, Sydney or Delhi, perhaps many
of the popular concepts of the Westerner
about the East could be more correctly
aligned. The reverse would be true of
your Eastern readers.
L. Mark Bartholomeusz
Radio Ceylon, Colombo
Editor's note : Short stories and poetry are
not published in The Unesco Courier.
However, the possibility of publishing transla¬
tions from the Unesco Collection of Represen¬
tative Works is now being examined.
PROBLEMS OF ALCOHOLISM
Sir,
On several occasions you have dedi¬
cated a number of The Unesco Courier
almost entirely to a sperial theme, e.g.
"Are Women Inferior Beings", "Science
Versus Old Age", "Mental Health",
"Orient/Occident", etc. Each time it is
a pleasure to see how thoroughly you
treat the subject.
Would it not be possible in a future
issue to throw some light on the problem
of Alcoholism? This topical and extre-
mely important theme would easily
form a varied number which would
undoubtedly be received by your readers
with great interest.
As I am closely connected with
problems of alcoholism here in Switzer¬
land, I should be very glad to hear
about conditions in other countries.
Hans-Peter Köhli
Richterswil, Switzerland
YOU CAN'T PLEASE EVERYONE
Sir,
We have read with great satisfaction
and growing interest The Unesco
Courier since we became subscribers in
May 1958. Nevertheless we cannot
find any explainable reason for the fact
that in the Letters to the Editor column
most people are divided over the same
point: Are the articles of The Unesco
Courier interesting or not?
We sincerely believe that there are so
many topics to be treated and so many
likes to be pleased that your task would
be never-ending. We must thank you
for having afforded us the opportunity
to know the world, its beauties and its
inhabitants much better than before
and the creative work of scientists
directed to all the fields in which huma¬
nity has developed.

HOW MANY POSSIBLE HANDS IN BRIDGE?
53,644,734,400,000,000,000,000,000,000
One of our readers, Mr. K. Geisen-
berger of Tunis (Tunisia) writes: "Your
February issue described the prodigious
powers of a new electronic calculator,
the 'flying brain'. This prompts me to
request that you ask the machine the
following question: How many possible
hands are there in the game of Bridge
played with a Si-card deck? By
'hands' I mean (1) the possible distri¬
bution of cards to the four players;
(2) the possible distribution of 13 cards
to one player."
The Unesco Courier has asked
M. lean Besse of Switzerland to answer
this question. M. Besse is a noted
mathematician working with Unesco's
International Computation Centre lo¬
cated in Rome. He is also a well-
known bridge champion of international
standing. Here is his answer:
The amazing results achieved thus
far by the great modern calcula¬
tors, and the staggering possibi¬
lities that the machines promise for
tomorrow have aroused the enthusiasm
of not only the scientist. As a result
of the many articles (more or less docu¬
mented) which have appeared in the
popular press, these new machines have
captured the imagination of the general
public as well. But this is one of the
subjects on which some of the most
fantastic and often erroneous notions are
in circulation as far as the ordinary
layman is concerned.
The fantasies of science fiction, the
exaggerated deluge of publicity, the
highly suggestive but questionable term
"Electronic Brain" all these have
brewed a fog of confusion which has
engendered the layman's notion of a
Robot, part demi-god, part superman.
Though no less wonderful, the reality
is closer to the human measure.
Let us, as our reader suggests, ask an
electronic calculating machine how many
possible hands there are in Bridge. It
will be stone deaf to the question. First,
because the machine does not know
what you are talking about. Second,
since it has no intelligence of its own
(and that is why the term "brain" is a
misnomer) it is quite incapable of posing
a problem, much less of studying one.
To pose a problem and elaborate a
method leading to a solution these for
the moment, remain the exclusive do¬
main of the human brain.
On the other hand you can very well
ask a mathematician how many possible
hands there are in Bridge. After a few
moments' thought, he will tell you that
the problem is one of calculating the
permutations of 52 objects (the cards)
distributed in four groups (the "hands")
of 13 objects, the permutation of the
by Jean Besse
objects within each group being imma¬
terial.
In mathematics, the notation 3!
(known as factorial three) is the result
of multiplying 1x2x3. Likewise
4! = 1 X 2 X 3 x 4; and 5! =
1x2x3x4x5, and so on. The
mathematician will tell you that the per¬
mutations of 52 objects is equivalent to
52! (that is, the product of multiplying
1 X 2 x 3 up ,to 52). But we must
also divide this number by the permu¬
tations within each of the four groups
of 13 cards, that is 13!, since the per¬
mutations within each group are imma¬
terial. The number we are looking for
is therefore:
52
N
13! X 13! X 13! X 13!
The mathematician is now satisfied.
He will add, perhaps (if he is in a good
mood) that since 52! is of the order of
1065 and 13! of the order of 1010 the
number N is of the order of 1025, that is,
it would be a number of about 25 digits.
As the precise calculation of this .number
would be a tedious job, the mathemati¬
cian would not go to the trouble of
doing it (mathematicians, do not like
tedious jobs).
At this point, and at this point only,
one could turn to the Electronic Calcu¬
lator. There are a hundred tedious
operations to be done.
The machine is there just for that.
But it is necessary to tell the machine
precisely what is expected of it. For
this a detailed "programme" must be
worked out and recorded (assimilated)
by the machine. ' After that you simply
press a button and the result comes out
a few seconds later. That is the mira¬
cle. There is nothing supernatural
about it, but it is a sensational accom¬
plishment of technology.
For the problem we are considering,
I prepared a "programme" for the'new
Computer, Gamma Tabbour Bull, built
in France (See The Unesco Courier
February 1959, p. 13), which took me
one hour to work out (1). The printed
answer emerged about a second after the
button had been pressed. The number
of possible hands in Bridge:
53,644 quadrillion
Spelled out, this figure (precise only for
the first nine digits) is written:
53,644,734,400,000,000,000,000,000,000.
As for the second question, "the possi¬
ble distribution of 13 cards to one
player", the calculation is simple and
can be made "by hand" with pencil and
paper in five minutes. The answer:
635,013,559,600 hands of 13 cards.
To "programme" this calculation and
pass it through an Electronic Computer
would be a waste of time. It is not
worth the trouble to ask the machine to.
do a job that is too simple. Just as it
is pointless to use a jet aeroplane to
cross the Champs-Elysées.
(I) While it may be true that the "programm¬
ing" time is quite long, perhaps even excessi¬
vely long, it should not be overlooked that,
once prepared, the "programme" can be used
afterwards to solve hundreds of similar pro¬
blems in split seconds.

WONDERLAND OF SOUVENIRS
FOR A ROYAL ROMAN TOURIST
Photo story by Angelo Frontoni. © Reproduction prohibited
Rome, the Eternal City, has
recently revealed to the world
new splendours of its past at
the magnificent villa of the emperor
Hadrian near Tivoli. It is a sur¬
prising thing that the Roman histori¬
ans recorded and handed down to
us only sparse information about this
vast and splendid edifice, the villa
Tiburtina built by Hadrian, for the
excavations which led to its discovery
have since shown this monument,
with its majestic architecture, en¬
trancing site and striking works of
art, to be one of the most beautiful
of its kind in the world.
The. Emperor Hadrian was by na¬
ture an artist and a great traveller
(the record of his journeys through
all parts of the empire forms the
chief authority for the events of his
life down to his final settlement in
Rome). He built the villa near Tivoli
as a place to spend his last years.
Here, in a setting both peaceful and
sumptuous, he could devote himself
28
to painting, music, poetry, literature
and other pleasures of his choice.
Thus on his return from his first
journey through the eastern pro¬
vinces of the empire he ordered work
to be started on the villa in 126 A.D.
Ambitious, and sensitive to his
surroundings, he planned the great
villa and its gardens as a kind of
epitome of the world he had visited,
one which would ever recall for him
the places and the buildings which
had left their impression on his
artistic imagination during many
long journeys. These included the
Academus near Athens, the Pryta-
neum, where the highest officers of
state met in Athens, the canal of the
ancient port of Canopus on the Nile
Delta, the famous vale of Tempe, set
between the mountains of Olympus
and Ossa in Thessaly, and even the
nether regions Which, poets declared
they had observed, and then
described in lyric works. To these
miniatures of celebrated places he
added an imperial palace and its
annexes, baths, a library, a theatre
and a judgement hall.
Today, as the remains of these
buildings are brought to light, their
size and diversity suggest that they
once belonged to a city rather than
a villa. The villa Tiburtina, or
"Adriana" as it is also Iknown, was
built on a plain, protected to the
north by a line of hills. It extends
from the right of the ancient Tibur¬
tina Way as far as the slopes of
mount Ripoli on which stands the
town of Tivoli, the remains of its
buildings and monuments covering
some two square miles.
After the death of Hadrian the his¬
tory of his wonderful home seems to
have become shrouded in mystery.
Since 1480, however when Pope
Alexander VI ordered the first exca¬
vations, great efforts have been made
to uncover the vestiges of the villa
which was once the pride of the
Roman Empire. The most recent

digging has uncovered a large area of
the villa and in particular the Cano-
pus, whose remains, now replaced on
their original site, give some idea of
their former splendour. Water again
flows in the canal and exact copies of
statues, caryatids and columns have
been made to evoke the sumptuous
festivities and entertainments which
Hadrian and his successors provided
for their guests. The originals are
preserved inside the villa and will
eventually be visible to the public in
one of the museums of Rome.
While visiting Egypt Hadrian had
been greatly impressed by the sacred
places of Canopus, a prosperous city
and port to the east of Alexandria, to
which it was linked by a canal fed
from one of the branches of the Nile.
This city took its name from Cano¬
pus, the pilot of Menelaus, who on
his return from Troy was said to
have died and to have been cremated
there. From all parts of Egypt the
faithful came to the city to visit the
temple of Serapis, to consult its ora¬
cle and to implore favours.
The villa Tiburtina "with its statues,
columns, canal and the ruins of what
was once the perfect copy of a distant
temple, offers an impression of the
greatness and prestige of Rome and
of its rulers who were able to per¬
petuate for their own time and for
posterity the renown of the Eternal
City.
EPITOME OF THE ANCIENT WORLD. The Emperor Hadrian planned his great villa end
its gardens near Tivoli, I 8 miles east of Rome, as a kind of epitome of the world he had visited during
his many travels through the Roman Empire. Here he reconstructed in miniature the places and
buildings which had most impressed him. One of these was the canal (opposite page) of the ancient
port of Canopus (named for the pilot of Menelaus, King of Sparta) in the Nile Delta. At the far
end of the canal is the Temple of Serapis. Above, among the graceful columns and arches at one
end of the canal are a crocodile carved in green stone, a now headless Amazon, Mars, the god of
war, and a warrior. Below, a view of the canal of Canopus as seen from the Temple of Serapis.

Statues, caryatids and columns along the Canopus Canal evoke the sumptuous entertain¬

Italy, but Athens was actually the favourite site of his architectural labours, and his pre¬
occupation with classical Hellenic art caused certain writers to name him the "Greek-

TiHE 100.000TH VISITOR: Unesco
House, a leading tourist attraction in Paris
within a year of its completion, recently
received its 100,000th visitor, fourteen-
year-old Michèle Menguy, who was
welcomed by Unesco's Director-General,
Dr. Vittorino Veronese. Michèle, who is
vice-chairman of the Unesco Club of Bois-
Colombes, near Paris, founded by the
parent's association of her school, saw
Unesco House on one of the regular group
tours conducted by four guides who
together speak a total of eight languages.
FOOD FOR THOUGHT: Passengers
aboard some U.S. steamship lines
celebrated U.N. Day this year by eating
a "U.N. Day Family Meal". Menus
were composed of different national
dishes so that a typical meal offered on
that day could have included an Indian
Mulligatawny soup, Mexican rice, a
French meat dish, Greek pastry and
Turkish coffee. These international
meals were part of the campaign being
organized in the United States for wider
observation of United Nations Day.

WORLD REFUGEE YEAR
A new United 'Nations Stamp the
fourth commemorative stamp for
1959 honouring World Refugee
Year, is being issued on December
10 Human Rights Day. The issue
replaces Human Rights Day stamps
which have been issued each year
since 1952. World Refugee Year
June 1959 to June 1960was des¬
ignated by the U.N. General As¬
sembly as a year of special effort
on behalf of the World's refugees. It
is hoped to resolve completely the
problem of some groups of refugees
and to improve the situation of
others as a result of additional funds
from governments and public contri¬
bution, additional immigration and
other kinds of assistance. The stamp
which depicts hands held protectively
over a refugee, is the emblem adopt¬
ed by the U.N. for World Refugee
Year. It is being issued in two col¬
ours, the 4-cent denomination in red
with olive-gold lettering in the bor¬
der, and the 8-cent in blue with
olive-gold lettering.
MORE TRAVEL ABROAD
FOR EUROPE'S WORKERS
Some 860 workers from 21 European countries are this year taking part in study
tours abroad sponsored by Unesco. They include agricultural workers, miners,
postal employees, workers in the transport and building trades, civil servants, shop
assistants, masterbakers, co-operators and, for the first time, a group of theatre
workers.
The groups, usually numbering about 15 people, visit one country or more
and are able to meet, both at work and in their homes, men and/ women who earn
their living in the same way.
For instance, last June women from Austrian co-operatives made a tour of Den¬
mark, Sweden and Germany. and visited a cocoa and chocolate factory in Hamburg
and various other co-operative enterprises in Copenhagen and Stockholm. They
were also shown something of the social services available to workers in these cities.
One of the more unusual tours which took place early in June was that of
members of workers' amateur dramatic groups from Finland who visited Copen¬
hagen, Hamburg, Munich and Vienna where they were able to study the technical
side of theatrical production such as lighting, scene shifting, etc.
Finland is one of the countries which is taking an active part in the Workers'
Study Tour programme. Twelve masterbakers from Finnish co-operatives have
been to Germany and Switzerland where they studied production methods, working
conditions and legislation in their field. And Finland has been host to a group
of women municipal workers from Norway, and to workers from Czechoslovakia,

Sometimes an international organization plans a tour for a group of workers
doing the same job from a number of different countries. For example, earlier
this year 19 agricultural co-operative employees from Belgium, Finland, Italy,
Norway, the Netherlands and Sweden went to the United Kingdom to study
farms and farmer's co-operatives on a tour organized by the International Fed¬
eration of Agricultural Producers.
Under the Unesco scheme, the cost of travel from one country to another
is borne by Unesco and all expenses in the host countries are paid for by
Workers' organizations, employers or the workers themselves. This year, Unesco
will have contributed $50,000 to the study tours, whilst the organizations and their
members will have spent approximately $150,000.
Countries which have sent or received parties of workers this year are Austria,
Belgium, Bulgaria, Czechoslovakia, Denmark, Finland, France, Federal Republic of
Germany, Hungary, Italy, Luxembourg, Netherlands, Norway, Poland, Rumania,
Sweden, Switzerland, Ukrainian S.S.R., United Kingdom, U.S.S.R. and Yugoslavia.
Since the Unesco European study tours started in 1952, 7,220 workers from
European countries have benefited by them..
the Asia Society Incorporated of New
York, for use in U.S. secondary schools.
In a handy sized folder entitled "Teachers'
South Asia Packet", the Society offers
photos, maps, pamphlets and reprints
providing an objective and up-to-date
introduction to these countries and a
supplement to textbooks and other
materials available to teachers. The Asia
Society is a non-profit educational and
cultural organization helping to bring the
peoples of American and Asia closer
together by mutual appreciation of each
other's culture and way of life.
SOVIET MINERLESS MINE : A
machine which performs all the tasks nor¬
mally carried out by miners in the pit
has been installed in the Dombass coal
region of the Soviet Union. A man at
the control panel guides the machine
through all the operations^ from the
extraction of coal to its removal- on the
conveyor belt which raises it to the
surface. As the machine advances,
pitprops are automatically moved along
the gallery. The machine is said to
extract as much coal in three hours as
a normal team of miners working with
ordinary equipment does in twelve.
H, IGHT TO INFORMATION: Every
day some 293 million copies ' of daily
newspapers, 335 million radio receivers and
73 million television sets bring news and
information to the world's peoples, while
over 140,000 cinemas provide them with
entertainment. But these facilities are very
unequally shared by countries and conti¬
nents. As a first step towards greater
international action in helping some
countries develop their information media,
the United Nations has asked Unesco to
make a world-wide survey of the problems
involved. Unesco will conduct the survey
through a series of regional meetings,
beginning with one in Bangkok in January
to draw up a programme for South-East
Asia. Later meetings will be held in Africa
and Latin America.
