TREASURES
OF
WORLD ART
o China
Noble character
For over three thousand years, Chinese artists have found
inspiration in transforming mere writing into graphic art. In China,
calligraphy means more than simply beautiful writing; for the
Chinese it Is one of the highest forms of artistic expression. By
the pressure of the brush and a delicate interplay of various types
of movement and feeling the artist creates a world of sensitive
beauty. The art of calligraphy has been practised on bone, stone,
wood and bronze, and later on silk and paper and has evolved,
not only with the materials used, but also with the evolution of
thought. Right, two stanzas of a poem: "The moon, like a semi¬
circular disc of jade... slowly sinks below the horizon." It is
shown here in the style of the great calligrapher Ho Shao-chi
(1799-1873). Above, enlargement of the Chinese character

demy of Arts and Crafts and Fellow of the International Institute
of Arts and Letters, Switzerland, Leon L.Y. Chang Is himself one
of the great calligraphers of today.

As a method of forecasting the future
and a guide for present-day planning,
futurology offers enormous possibilities
and vistas. But it is not surprising that its
aims, methods and prospects have aroused
so much discussion and controversy.
"What future for futurology?". The answer,
though positive, is not a simple one
as this issue tries to show.

WHAT FUTURE
FOR
FUTUROLOGY ?
by François Le Lionnais

FRANÇOIS LE LIONNAIS, French science consultant, mathematician and
engineer, is president of the French Science Writers' Association. A member
of the Advisory Committee on Scientific Language of the Académie
des Sciences, in Pans, he is scientific adviser to the French Institute of
Advanced Scientific Studies, the Institute of Cell Pathology, the French
Radio and Television Network, and the French National Commission for
Unesco. A former head of Unesco's Division of Teaching and Dissemination
of Science, he is known as a speaker and writer on scientific matters,
particularly of science popularization. Among his books on science are
'Les Grands Courants de la Pensée Mathématique" (Main Trends in Mathe¬
matical Thought), Blanchard, Paris 1962; "La Science au XX' Siècle" (Science
In the 20th Century), Editions du Seuil, Pans 1951. and "Le Temps", Delpire,
Paris, 1959, published in English as "Time", by Orion Press, New York, 1960.
Mr. Le Lionnais acted as scientific consultant in the preparation of this issue.
^^ cybernetics and the
computer, the population explosion
and pollution of our planet, futurology
is a topic everyone is talking about.
The notion each of us forms of futu¬
rology, and especially what we expect
It to be able to do, may well indicate
whether our thinking still contains tra¬
ces of a belief in magic, or whether, on
the contrary, we are fully aware of the
powers as well as the limitations of
the methods of science.
On the one hand futurology acts as
an irresistible fascination and allure¬
ment for all those who still cling to
moth-eaten yet hard-to-kill superstitions
and beliefs. On the other hand futur¬
ology invites us to cast off our
superstitions and to replace them with
less ambitious but far more reliable
methods of solving specific problems.
Strictly speaking, there can be no
such thing as forecasting if our reason¬
ing and calculations are not applied
in a clearly defined domain, that is if
they do not operate in accordance with
the natural laws of the universe. This
is what the scientist refers to as scien¬
tific determinism which states that
everything occurs in the universe ac¬
cording to natural laws and not as a
result of pure chance; that every phen-
omanon has a cause, and that the
same causes produce the same effect.
Nor can one speak of carrying out
true forecasting if one does not have
the required data and information, or
if one does not know how the laws in
a particular domain actually operate.
From this it is clear that the possibi¬
lities of futurology as a science are
subject to three limitations:

logy deals only partially with predict-

cons
From somewhat haphazard beginnings, exploration of the future, or
futurology, has become a world-wide research movement that reflects
a broad range of scholarly and scientific interests and disciplines. Its
practitioners offer their anticipations not as certainties, but merely as
possibilities or, in some cases, probabilities. And such assessments are
usually based on studies of technological and social trends and an imagin¬
ative speculation on the results of scientific and technological develop¬
ment. Yet even today, many of the realities of futurology are obscured
by a lack of public understanding of its aims and methods. The U.S. futuro-
logist Daniel Bell, chairman of the American Academy of Arts and Sciences'
"Commission on the Year 2000," has pointed out that a good deal of today's
public interest in the future arises from the bewitchment of technology.
"What is bad," he writes, "is that a serious and necessary effort is in danger
of being turned into a fad, and any fad trivializes a subject and quickly
wears it out. A second evil is that many more expectations are aroused
than can be fulfilled." To the question, "What future for futurology?,"
this issue of the "Unesco Courier" seeks to offer some answers that examine
with equal impartiality the possibilities 'and the limitations of this new
branch of human endeavour.
able events, that is, if the element of
chance plays a certain part, it is self-
evident that the reliability of any fore¬
cast will be proportional to the degree
of chance or uncertainty involved.
Second, even assuming that chance
plays absolutely no part in the ques¬
tion under examination, there is still no
guarantee that the futurologist's pre¬
diction will be right. One has to
make sure that all the relevant infor¬
mation and data or at least the most
important data have been secured
and taken into account.
Third, even if chance plays no part
and all the relevant data have been
secured, it is still not enough. The
futurologist must also be familiar with
the laws that govern the relationship
between the various factors involved in
the problem. While he need not ne¬
cessarily know every single law he
must at least know the most Impor¬
tant ones and be sure that if any law is
neglected It is only a secondary one.
If these three conditions are met, the
futurologist will be able to make fore¬
casts and predictions that are valid,
for despite certain unknowns, they will
have an excellent chance of coming
true.
But can such severe limitations as
the three indicated above all be met in
a reliable manner? This is the real
crux of the problem of the validity of
futurology. I think one can say,
however, that science has already
given us the answer, and that answer
is a definite "Yes," even if only in
certain cases.
The classic example of this is cer¬
tainly celestial mechanics. The Heav¬
ens do, in fact, offer us many testi
monies of the achievements of "astro¬
nomical futurology" with predictions of
the exact duration of each day of the
year at every point on the globe, the
movements of the tides, the eclipses
of the sun and the moon, the move¬
ments of the stars and other heavenly
bodies such as the comets (1).
But the Heavens are also a good
example for reminding us not to lose
sight of the important rules referred
to above.
The movements of the planet Uranus
can be predicted correctly only with
a knowledge of the existence and cha¬
racteristics of a more distant planet,
namely, Neptune. The movements of
the planet Mercury can be predicted
properly and precisely only by replac¬
ing Newton's law of gravitation by the
Einstein-Schwarzschild law of gravita¬
tion. Neptune was discovered by Le-
verrier when,- in connexion with Ura¬
nus, he observed the difference be¬
tween prediction, and fact while trying
not to call into question Newton's law
of gravitation.
In the case of Mercury, it was, on
the contrary, Newton's law which had
to be called into question and replaced
by a universal law In order to explain
the difference between prediction and
fact without having to postulate the
existence of another planet. Beyond
the solar system the predictions which
(1) Halley's Comet Is perhaps the most
famous historical example. In 1682 the En¬
glish astronomer, Edmund Halley, observed
the comet and after calculating its orbit was
able to predict its return with an accuracy
that astounded his contemporaries. The
comet did In fact return as he foretold at the
beginning of 1759, seventeen years after Hal-
ley's death.
one can make regarding stars other
than the sun and concerning galaxies
other than our Milky Way may be
fruitful, but they are nonetheless at
the mercy of the discovery of hitherto
unknown phenomena; in recent years,
astronomy has been rich in discoveries
of this kind, among which may be men¬
tioned radio sources, quasars, pulsars
and neutron stars.
What we have just said in connexion
with astronomy could and must be ex¬
tended to the whole future of funda¬
mental research In physics. Scientists
have known, for several centuries, of
the existence of gravitational forces,
both electrical and magnetic (particu¬
larly In their earthly form, gravity) and
they have succeeded In understanding
their ' mechanisms sufficiently to be
able to apply them in any number of
ways.
Nuclear forces came to light at the
end of the 19th century and other
forces (curiously named, of weak inter¬
action) in the middle of the 20th cen¬
tury. Before their discovery, who
would have been able to forecast the
appearance of these forces in the field
of physics and on what evidence
would such a prediction have been
based? Moreover, how could anyone
have predicted not merely the exis¬
tence of these forces but the technical
uses to which they could be put and
the economic, social and political
consequences of such uses?
A few years ago, scientists thought
they had discovered a fifth force, dif¬
ferent from the other four. This now p
lies in the graveyard of stillborn theo- n
ries and hypotheses. But who can
say that another "fifth force" will not
see the light of day in the more or

WHAT FUTURE FOR FUTUROLOGY? (Continued)
The future of the past is in the future
The future of the present is in the past
The future of the future is in the present
less distant future ? Not a single
reliable futurologist would dare to
make such an assertion. But should
such a day arrive, mankind's whole
enonomic, social, political and cultural
future might perhaps be completely
upset, as it is beginning to be by the
use of nuclear forces.
In short, futurology must give up
absolutely any pretensions at predic¬
tions as soon as it ¡s a question of
fundamental research aimed at cross¬
ing a frontier beyond which stretches
completely unknown territory. One
cannot, at the same time, know and
not know. The illusion to the contrary
comes (and we should not be led as¬
tray by the error of those who are
victims of it) from the application of a
philosophy, or intuition, or unscien¬
tific convictions, to a field which
science regards as uncharted whe¬
ther temporarily or for all time and
which it is trying, or perhaps will try,
to explore. Such intuitions and con¬
victions may merit our respect, but any
futurology worthy of the name should
not take them into account.
I

T is perhaps permissible
to tone down the severity of this judg¬
ment when an enclave of scientific
ignorance is surrounded on all sides by
well charted territory. This is the case,
for example, in biological research
aimed at filling the gap separating our
knowledge of living beings and of
living cells from our knowledge of
the biochemistry and biophysics of the
molecules of which living matter is
formed. It is permissible to suppose
that this gap will be filled fairly soon.
But here again, it should be carefully
noted that:
this is only a working hypothesis
it could be described as a "hopeful"
hypothesis because
there is no guarantee that the appa¬
rently small distance still to be cover¬
ed does not, in fact, conceal enormous
difficulties, and consequently
the estimate of the time needed is
more of a guess than an accurate fore¬
cast.
If we move on from considerations
of pure research to applied research
and techniques, and then to their prac¬
tical consequences, we come up
against difficulties that are sometimes
comparable, but which are also some¬
times easier to overcome. In general,
the more fundamental the discovery,
the more profound and radical it is, the
more it is abstract and the less its
consequences are immediately fore¬
seeable.
How could Apollonius of Perga and
his contemporaries have imagined, in
the third century B.C., that geometric
study of the ellipse would enable
Kepler, in the 17th century, to provide
a model of the movements of the
planets, a model which would be used
to guide navigators at night and would
transform the character of trans¬
atlantic trade in the following century?
How could the British mathematician
P.A. MacMahon have foreseen that an
amusing arithmetical problem which
fascinated him at the beginning of the
20th century the study of the so-
called Greco-Latin squares, that is to
say, squares containing numbers ar¬
ranged in a certain way would pro¬
vide agriculture with a means of
increasing the production of cereals
by having recourse to the laws of
probability? (applying these laws in¬
telligently to all the factors that
determine the growth of crops
humidity, winds, rainfall, sunshine, the
nature of soils, plant genetics, botany,
the chemical make-up of fertilizers,
etc.)
It would, of course, be easy to sup¬
ply many more examples of this kind.
But many others could equally be
found which would show how intelli¬
gent and imaginative persons (often
after having rid themselves of a para¬
lyzing conformism) have been able to
anticipate the use to which a discov¬
ery of pure science would be put.
This brings us now, somewhat
abruptly perhaps, to the sector of
human affairs where, if we discount
elements of chance, the prospects of
futurology are indeed enormous.
The obstacles to be overcome are
admittedly very great but they are of a
far less radical nature. The number
of factors that must be taken into
account is often discouragingly high,
and many of these factors are very dif¬
ficult to measure accurately. In addi¬
tion they are difficult to measure fast
enough to be able to forecast events...
before they actually occur.
Furthermore, although in many cases
we already know the economic,
sociological and psychological laws
that govern human behaviour, this
knowledge is still quite primitive and
can lead to monumental errors.
There is no shortage of historians
to show (after the event of course)
that it would have been possible to
predict the French Revolution of 1789
(though not the taking of the Bastille
on July 14), or the economic and finan¬
cial crash of 1929 which began in the
United States and then spread all
over the world, or the student protests
of May 1968. But supposing that, as
Pascal wrote, if Cleopatra's nose
had not been so long, the entire
history of the world would have been
changed, who, at that time (or even
to-day) would have had at his disposal
methods sophisticated enough to fore¬
cast what would have happened?
There is, finally, one other obstacle
to the effectiveness of futurology in
this field where it should theoretically
be particularly effective. This is the
fact, which weighs like original sin on
all the human sciences, that it is car¬
ried out by men and is very largely
concerned with human activities. The
futurologist is both judge and jury.
Even if he succeeds in. eliminating any
ulterior motives or bad faith, it is well
nigh impossible for him to rid himself
of the convictions, opinions and pre¬
judices inculcated in him by his edu¬
cation, the social milieu from which
he sprang or which he frequents, his
experience and his reading, not all of
which recessarily tend to foster his
objectivity. These are so many gar¬
ments of Nessus that he is hard put to
leave In the cloakroom.
F
OR proof of this, it is
enough to read all the books and
articles which have been written on
the subject in the last twenty years.
There is scarcely one that does not
reveal in some way or other the poli¬
tical or religious ideas of its author,
his nationality, or at least his adher¬
ence to a group of countries living
under the same form of government
or with the same ideology, what
type of school or university education
he had, in short, a certain view of the
world which is very likely to colour his
thinking.
In the natural sciences, it is virtually
impossible to make such deductions
about an author. It is true, the optimist
can be distinguished from the pessi¬
mist, the timorous mind from the bold,
but this has no repercussions on the
objectivity of results obtained and is
soon obliterated by the evidence of the
facts.
Can a change in futurology which
would immunize it from these imper¬
fections be foreseen? Is it possible to
forecast the future of a science and
technique of the future? Provided that
no time limit is set it seems reasonable
to reply in the affirmative. For confir¬
mation of this, we have only to note
the studies made in the space of a few
years by all those old branches of
philosophy which now claim, and jus¬
tifiably so, the title of the "Human
Sciences" and which every day are
approaching the status of "exact
sciences".
It is only if we renounce all attempts
at predicting discoveries ensuing from
absolutely fundamental research, and
only if we systematically ban all mis¬
representations engendered by super¬
stitions, passions or special interests,
that the chrysalis will one day emerge
as a beautiful butterfly.

ARCOLOGY
OR DIGGING UP
THE FUTURE
The brainchild of American architect Paolo Soleri is this gleaming model of a town of the future.
Like a double pyramid it would stand 3,500 feet (over half a mile) high and house
170,000 people. Utility inlets, sewers and elevators would be installed in the giant pillars.
Each living unit would be about 22 feet high, 35 feet wide and 40 to 60 feet deep, and within
it each individual would be free to design the sort of home he wanted. Soleri calls his style
"arcology", a word coined from the marriage of architecture and ecology, since his aim is
to compact rather than expand the city and leave most of the countryside for man's enjoyment.
He believes the future will provide the new materials that would make his giant structures
technologically feasible.

BREAKTHROUGH
TO
TOMORROW
T
HERE has been a meteoric
rise in the popularity of futurology
among the public. But sudden, world¬
wide popularity of this kind Is often
based on over-simplification or misun¬
derstanding of the facts, and this is
true of futurology.
People expect so much from futur¬
ology. They seem to imagine that it
can work scientific "miracles" and
come up with infallible remedies for
the crises that convulse the modern
world. Seizing on futurology, popular
imagination has raised some of the
pioneer "futurists" to the rank of pro¬
phets a role which most of them are
loath to accept.
Predictably, the public's misconcep¬
tions about futurology have aroused
far more expectations than can be ful¬
filled. Demands are made not only for
clear-cut programmes covering the
decades ahead, but also for precise
techniques concerning the forecasting,
control and direction of events that
would enable man to forge his future,
to stem, as it were, the course of
history in the way he has dammed tor¬
rential rivers and harnessed them to
his needs.
ROBERT JUNGK is a leading figure in the
field of futurology. He founded the Institute
for Future Research in Vienna, was co-foun¬
der of the Association for the Study of
Problems of the Future, in Hamburg, and
is on the Board of the Future Research
Centre in West Berlin. He is the author of
several books on futurology including "To¬
morrow is Already Here" (1953), 'Brighter
than a Thousand Suns" (1958), "Children of
the Ashes" (1961) and "The Big Machine"
(1969). With lohan Gattung he edited "Man¬
kind 2000" (1969) based on the First Inter¬
national Future Research Conference, held
in Oslo in 1967, and on the ideas and aims
of a project called "Mankind 2000" which
he initiated in 1964. Dr. Jungk at present
teaches at the Technical University in West
Berlin and at the Otto Suhr Institute of the
Free University of West Berlin.
It is hardly surprising that after so
many decades of unrest people nowa¬
days seek security and prefer certain¬
ties to surprises. And this attitude is
even more understandable In view of
the dangers that have arisen from the
population explosion, famine, the des¬
truction of the environment and the
threat of war waged with nuclear,
chemical or biological weapons.
But impatience and haste are un¬
reliable counsellors; they lead people
to expect too much, too soon. So
one cannot rule out the possibility
that futurology may one day be
swamped by the stampede of those
who are impatient to reach solid
ground, and thus founder like a hastily
built raft which capsizes through over¬
loading.
Whoever is concerned with the
future of research into the future is
obliged to consider the possibility of a
"shipwreck" of this kind now that
opinion has swung from a premature
craze for futurology to a no less pre¬
mature condemnation.
Futurology is nowadays increasingly
attacked by critics who point to errors
In its forecasts and predictions. A
recent example is the study by Keith
Pavitt (of the Scientific Affairs Directo¬
rate of the Organization for Economic
Co-operation and Development, in
Paris) and Claude Mestre (French
Ministry of Transport) which empha¬
tically contests the reliability of several
well-established methods of technolo¬
gical forecasting.
The report is so pessimistic that
many persons on reading it might
well conclude that "experimental long-
term forecasting" has been an utter
failure from start to finish, and should
be abandoned without delay as a cost¬
ly enterprise whose conclusions merely
serve to mislead us.
But this would be a disastrous mis¬
take. The systematic scrutiny and
exploration of the future has become
an imperative need in the present era
of revolutionary changes in science
and technology.
In the view of the French philoso¬
pher and educator, Gaston Berger,
the need for a scientific and specula¬
tive concern with the future ¡s a direct
consequence of the unprecedented
acceleration of change In the present
age.
So long as changes were spread out
over long periods of time, man could
be compared to someone walking
along a dark road. All he needed to
make his way in reasonable safety
were his eyes. Then came the compa¬
ratively faster tempo of the horse-
drawn carnage, and torches or lanterns
were needed to light the road for
some distance ahead. When the
speed of the automobile was reached,
powerful headlights were required to
prevent collisions.
Since Gaston Berger's death in 1960
(he was killed in a road accident) the
pace has increased to the point where
today's supersonic aircraft would be
unable to operate safely without the
help of complex electronic guidance
systems.
So instead of disparaging or doing
away with techniques that would help
to smooth out our progress from the
present to the future, we should en¬
deavour to improve them. But we shall
be unable to light the way ahead
merely by boosting the power of our
traditional "lamps". The development
of techniques for forecasting the future
will demand feats of ingenuity compa- n
rabie with those that have carried us H
from automobile headlights to radar,
and beyond that to the beams of lasers
that now enable us to probe and

explore greater distances than ever
before.
Several thousands of specialists,
working in almost every country of
the world, are already developing tech¬
niques for lighting up at short, me¬
dium and long-range distances the
road that lies ahead. This exploration
is becoming a new dimension of our
society and an indispensable condition
for its survival and development.
In nearly every case, the work of
these specialists relates to practical
problems and projects. They advise
governments, city authorities and In¬
dustry They are asked for forecasts
on trends in population growth and
the availability of food supplies. They
are consulted on developments in
technology, new materials, transport,
production methods and trade. What
they describe are "possible future
trends" in fields ranging from world
politics down to changes in the struc¬
ture of the family, and from the ex¬
ploration of outer space to the study
of man's "Inner space" his mind or
his spiritual nature.
Yet only a minute part of the intel¬
lectual and material resources devoted
to futurology Is used for a critical
appraisal of the work it accomplishes
or for a comparative study of its dif¬
ferent methods with the aim of devel¬
oping and improving them.
Thus far, almost no theoretical re¬
search has been done on futurology
itself. New perspectives are revealed
only as by-products of practical fore¬
casting. This is one of the weakness¬
es of the new science of futurology.
It scrutinizes the heavens and the
earth, but looks at itself all too seldom.
The origins of modern futurology
research go back to the latter part
of World War II, when it was first
taken up seriously as an auxiliary
science to military strategy, on which
It came to exert some influence.
The end of 1945 saw the launching
of the Rand (abbreviation for Research
and Development) project, comprising
a working group of physicists and
technologists and operating within a
private aircraft construction company.
From this group came the Rànd Cor¬
poration, established In 1948 by the
Ford Foundation and registered in the
State of California as an independent
non-profit-making enterprise.
In retrospect, the historical sig¬
nificance of this undertaking has
become clear, not only through the
work accomplished by Rand, but
because it was a striking "social
innovation". It was, in reality, the
prototype of a new type of Intellectual
Institution, the so-called "think fac¬
tory", and as such it became the model
for many similar establishments in
government and industry.

lames Watt took out a patent for his steam engine in 1769,
but it was not until 56 years later that George Stephenson's
famous locomotive "Rocket" pulled the world's first railway
passengers from Stockton to Darlington, in England.
Rendered obsolete by the development of diesel and
electric traction, the steam locomotive, the driving force
behind the industrial revolution, is fast disappearing,
like the "iron horse" which has been put out to grass, above.
In the modern world, the pace of change is quickening
and the interval between scientific discovery and large
scale application is shortening dramatically. This change
of pace is vividly illustrated in the diagram below which
shows the development periods of eleven major discoveries

It took 112 years from the discovery of the principles of photography to develop its practical application, yet only two
years to complete the same process with the solar battery. So fast is the pace of development nowadays that the
practical results of basic research are upon us before we have had time to assess their desirability or consider their
future implications. It is here that the futurologist, by extrapolation of trends, can give a breathing space in which
to reflect The first practical prototype laser was developed in 1960 by Dr T. H. Maiman; it is already being used
in fields requiring great precision such as eye surgery, the control of machines, the machining of very hard materials,
and ultra-accurate measurement. The use of lasers as communications channels, including inter-planetary
communications, offers great promise. Below, part of the French designed reflector placed on the moon by the

BREAKTHROUGH TO TOMORROW (Continued)
Three-pronged shape of things to come
versions, the "Think Tanks," was their
working methods. Whereas In uni¬
versities, prior to 1950, one rarely
found group work going on between
the various science faculties, in the
Rand Corporation interdisciplinary
teams were quickly set up in which
physicists and technicians were soon
joined by mathematicians, geo¬
graphers, historians, economists,
sociologists, specialists in politics and
finally, ethnologists and psychologists.
An outstanding feature of these
working groups was the easy inform¬
ality with which opinions were ex¬
changed, criticism expressed and new
hypotheses or concepts developed.
Many researchers were attracted by
this relaxed and Intellectually stimul¬
ating atmosphere which contrasted
favourably in many ways with the
nice formal and monotonous character
of university life.
Most of the methods used in system¬
atic forecasting which were accepted
in the 1950s and 1960s, but which to¬
day are targets of growing criticism,
were first developed In the American
"Analytic Institutes" (a title they
themselves prefer to the journalistic
tag "Think Factories"). Among these
institutes are the Rand Corporation
(already mentioned), IDA (Institute for
Defense Analysis), RAC (Research
Analysis Corporation), SDC (Systems
Development Corporation), ANSER
(Analytic Services) and SRI (Stanford
Research Institute).
The hundred or so methods by
which they seek to grasp the shape
of things to come can be considered
under three main headings:
Intuitive forecasting
Exploratory forecasting
Normative forecasting.
Intuitive forecasting combines ex¬
pertise with imagination and insight.
The best known techniques It has
developed thus far are "Brainstorm¬
ing" and, above all, the "Delphi
technique".
In both cases participants in a
panel are asked to "invent the future",
that is, to make an intuitive forecast
of future developments in specific
fields (in automation, food resources,
health and education, for example).
Whereas in "Brainstorming" this takes
place in a group session, and
each person tries to let himself
be freely influenced and stimulated
by the Ideas of other participants,
in the "Delphi technique", specia¬
lists are questioned Individually in
order to prevent them being Influenc¬
ed by other participants with excep¬
tionally strong personalities (or per¬
suasively loud voices).
A typical Delphi experiment makes
use of from 50 to 60 specialists and
is systematically organized In several
"rounds", in which more and more
questions derived from the results of
THINK TANKS' AND 'WORKSHOPS
12
IANY people consider that imagination is
incompatible with research. For them imagination is the
antithesis of the scientific approach impossible to check
up on, elusive, and erratic. Yet if one takes the trouble
to consider the actual processes of scientific discovery, it
will be seen that the leap from the known into the unknown,
from the verifiable to the conjectured, is due not to calculat¬
ed judgement but to intuition, imaginativeness, and the
ability to project into the future.
This is clear from the remarks of many of the
greatest inventors. Naturally they follow the path of pure
reason up to the confines of the new and the different, but
from there on they must be guided by imagination on to
new paths and new areas of thought.
Imagination plays a special part in the exploration of the
future. It is the only force capable of bursting the bonds
of the "prison of time" in which we are all incarcerated.
We are all, even geniuses in the Einstein class, much more
marked by the spirit and style of our age than we are
willing to admit, and this influences our vision of future
developments.
Max Iklé, the Swiss-born American futurologist, has
given a very apt illustration of how forecasting is con¬
ditioned by the time context in which it takes place. Taking
the example of medieval man, he tried to imagine how he
might have envisaged the future. Very probably he saw
it as an age in which church, cloister and clergy would play
an important part in fact a kind of Middle Ages writ large.
Looking back we now know that such a surmise as to
the nature of modern times would have been not only very
incomplete, but also partly mistaken. Yet surely we are
following the same line of thought when, to take the most
frequent example, we imagine the twenty-first century as
a period of still deeper probes into the exploration of the
world and nature, and of still more powerful and precise
technological development.
If futurology is to learn from the mistakes made by
prophets of the past, it must do more than merely prolong
current trends or extrapolate curves. It must also attempt
to extend its thinking to take in that which has never been
seen, the unheard-of and the wholly or virtually inconceiv¬
able. Yet here it comes up against a paradox. For if we
knew what we cannot yet know, this would fall within exist¬
ing knowledge; hence it could not be part of "things to
come" in the strict sense of the term.
There is however a broad area of the future where that
which is no longer Today, and which is not yet Tomorrow,
can exist in the form of hypothesis, conjecture, or specula¬
tion. Only a very few of the many ideas which spring
from this intermediate area later become a reality. Most
of them are short-lived; some of them, premature antici¬
pations of the future, are allowed to "hibernate," while
others begin in intellectual forms totally different from their
subsequent practical application. This is the area of the
future to which futurology should pay particular attention.
Futurology should not merely assume the role of observer,
but should also provide an incentive and a stimulus.
Futurology should, first of all, continue the age-old
tradition of the search for Utopia. The Utopians described
the desirable (that which could not be attained in the world
in which it was located) by projecting "ideal states." This
was no more than an intellectual game for philosophers

earlier rounds are put to the par¬
ticipants. The purpose is to obtain
increasingly precise data on the proba¬
bility of the hypotheses advanced and
when they might conceivably become
reality.
In this way, majority and minority
opinions are finally obtained, and
these represent an informed intuitive
judgement on probable, possible or
desirable future developments.
Questions are sent out in written
form and replies are examined and
evaluated by a central office for use
in subsequent rounds of the experi¬
ment. In order to reduce the length
of this process, the Institute of the
Future, in the U.S.A., plans to set up
a permanent, electronic world-wide
Delphi circuit which would be connect¬
ed to a central computer.
Exploratory forecasting examines
probable future developments, using as
a basis existing knowledge and trends
as well as recent scientific, techno¬
logical,, economic or social innovations
or those expected in the near future.
From extrapolations based on this
data, exploratory forecasting suggests
which trends should be reinforced
and which should be curbed.
Futurology has introduced some in¬
novations here, such as the "encircl¬
ing curve", which attempts to draw a
circle round the extreme possibilities
of a technical system the maximum
possible utilization of the power of a
nuclear accelerator, the most rapid
rnethods of transport, the brightest
possible light, and so on. Account is
taken of so-called "internal" limits
set by nature and "external" limits
such as those related to population
growth, the national product, or the
surface of the globe.
Other methods are aimed at improv¬
ing exploratory forecasting. First on
the list come "study curves" whereby
past assumptions as to future develop¬
ments can be compared with those
which actually took place, and conclu¬
sions drawn as to possible sources
of error and margins of uncertainty.
In "contextual mapping", account is
taken of the mutual interaction of
various extrapolated trends. This
method appears very promising, since
it convincingly shows the mutual inter
dependence of technological and
scientific evolution, and develops by
experience new ways of thought which
subsequently accommodate social,
political and psychological factors.
In exploratory forecasting a special
place is occupied by the "morpho¬
logical method" of the Swiss astro¬
physicist Fritz Zwicky. The steps con¬
sist of stating the problem precisely,
exposing the important parameters,
revealing the dimension, range, and
number of values for each parameter,
determining the number and kind of
solutions, and finally evaluating and
choosing the preferred solution.
For example, Zwicky has shown that
on the basis of the 11 basic parame¬
ters of a jet engine, 25,344 different
types of engine could be put on the
drawing-board. Yet some of them, for
example an underground jet engine
(which could possibly be used for
mining), might remain for a long time
at the planning stage.
Typical of this class of studies are
today's widely-publicized forecasts of
the increase in world population, of
the number of motor-cars, of the pol-

OF THE FUTURE'
since no one has ever envisaged the achievement of such
a state in respect of a "non-place."
Today, Utopia has acquired a new function which is
much closer to reality. As man's awareness of himself
grows, he believes that he is able to shape his history to
a large extent, and the intellectual form taken by his aspira¬
tions becomes his model for action. Today he replaces far-
off dreams by a workable plan which he sees as the direct
opposite of all that he finds unsatisfactory in the present.
I HE Netherlands futurologist, Professor Fred
Polak, has very ably shown how concrete images of the
future influence the present by modifying it or even giving
it a new direction. What we merely anticipate or desire
forms just as much part of the present as what we perceive
and know. No one concerned by changes in what exists
can afford to ignore these boundary zones of reality.
People tend to think that science is centered on what
has already beon formed, described, or has already taken
place, or on what can be accurately observed or measured.
But this involves setting up far too rigid a system of checks.
Discoveries in recent decades, from X-rays to psycho¬
analysis, from the irruption of assymmotry into mathematics
to the assault on the principle of the conservation of parity
in nuclear physics, have shown time and again that standard,
accepted opinions are often no longer capable of correctly
apprehending reality because they are based on too rigid
and dogmatic a conception of what reality is.
By reinstating imagination, and by associating it with
research which can be tested and evaluated, it is possible
for futurology to open up and enlarge the way in which
the scientist works and give him greater flexibility. And
since it lies halfway between the two cultures of art and
science, it can overcome prejudices and obstacles on both
sides.
In "Think Tanks" or "Workshops of the Future" much fruit¬
ful collaboration has already been developed beUveen
sculptors and engineers, painters and computer experts,
poets and naturalists, linguists and sociologists, novelists
and political scientists.
The forms assumed by these joint attempts to discern and
shape things to come are highly varied. In a "brainstorming"
session participants temporarily suspend their critical sense
and give free rein to the creative interplay of their imagin¬
ation. An attempt can be made to discover the future
course of events by writing a political scenario. Simulation
or gaming techniques are used to produce an idea of future
town planning and communication problems, after which
complete community systems are constructed.
Starting with the idea "imagine what it would be like
if . . . . " it is frequently possible for several individuals, by
pooling and adding to each other's ideas, to envisage some¬
thing which is really new; through conversations, tape
recordings and paperwork the future can in fact be "dis¬
covered."

BREAKTHROUGH TO TOMORROW (Continued)
The world we want tomorrow
lution of the atmosphere and of the
growth of stockpiles of nuclear wea¬
pons. Such studies can and should
serve as "early warning systems" and
thus enable us to slow down certain
dangerous trends or to speed up other
more positive developments. Already,
with the help of computers and modern
mathematical methods, the research
techniques used for many years by
political economists and demographers
have been vastly improved.
More detailed studies are now being
made of the interactions between nu¬
merous recent developments in tech¬
nology. A typical example is the in¬
vestigation of possible effects of the
further development of means of
communication (telephone, television,
"picturephone", computer links to
every home, and so on). The possible
psychological development and the
new aspirations and values of future
generations are questions that have
still to be explored.
Such are the kind of ¡mages of the
future that exploratory forecasting
seeks to project, taking into account
many different factors which are diffi¬
cult to determine since they are far
more varied and contradictory than
they were even a few years ago.
Normative forecasting, another
group of methods, is now coming
to the fore. Here advantage is taken
of a criticism which has always been
levelled at attempts to forecast the
future. It is argued that intrinsic in
any forecast is either the incitement
to act in its favour or a counter-reac¬
tion against it. In other words, since
a forecast is heard by men ready to
act, it carries within It the seeds either
14
FUTUROLOGY AND THE SEARCH
FOR PEACE
I HE major aim of futurology can be to safeguard peace.
It could even be said that the possibility of the world destroying itself has
provided the most powerful impetus to the development of this new form
of research. By warning us of the crises and catastrophes that threaten
it aims to prevent them or to lessen their effects.
But can futurology really be effective in this field? By means of explo¬
ratory forecasting it can explain dangerous trends to politicians and
the public. Anyone, for instance, who examines the comparative trends in
population growth and in discoveries of new sources of food over the
next twenty years will have no difficulty in deducing that between 1975
and 1982 some serious crises will arise that will inevitably affect world
politics.
Other forecasts, for example those which point to the unequal growth
in average national income in the highly industrialized and the developing
areas (a twenty to one ratio), indicate a further increase in the inequality
that already exists between the "North" and the "South" of our planet.
If we add to this the. forecast that towards the end of the 1980s the
population of the developing countries under the age of 15 will equal the
entire population of the industrialized countries, then the warning signal
is plain for all to see.
The warning role played by futurology should not be underestimated.
It has an increasing effect upon politics, but, paradoxically, is likely to harm
its own reputation with the public. The latter might indeed be inclined to
scoff if the catastrophes predicted by the "pessimists" fail to materialize.
Not everyone will want to admit that disasters were avoided precisely
because futurology's "radar" picked them up in time.
Futurology can play another, and in the long run perhaps more important,
part in the search for peace: it can draw up the requirements for future
peace on a broad basis and in great detail. Work along these lines inclu¬
des not only the studies on "models for world order" undertaken in the
U.S.S.R., India, Japan, Uganda, Chile and the Fed. Rep. of Germany, but
also the many studies of the Pugwash movement, founded by Albert Ein¬
stein and Bertrand Russell, which seek to develop a host of ideas for future
peaceful co-operation between different peoples and ideologies.
ROBERT JUNGK
of its destruction or its realization. In
a system of exploring the future which
does not claim to be an "objective"
science, but a "science of action",
such criticism is not contested; on the
contrary, it is admitted and exploited
in a positive way.
The trend at the present time is
consciously to shape the future by
drawing up standards and objectives.
The viewpoint of Olaf Helmer, a U.S.
futurologist, who with his associates
at the Rand Corporation developed the
Delphi method of forecasting, based
on the polling of a series of expert
panels, is characteristic of this new
attitude to moulding the future.
"The fatalistic concept of an unfore¬
seeable and unavoidable future", he
states, "is being progressively aban¬
doned. We are beginning to realize
that there are a great number of pos¬
sible futures, and that appropriate
action can Influence these possibilities
in different ways. This raises the
exploration of things to come and the
attempts to influence them into realms
of great social responsibility. If we
wish to assume this responsibility we
must cease to be onlookers at the
spectacle of the world's history, and
must influence history with the inten¬
tion of shaping the future."
A
M >N example of this kind of
normative behaviour was the American
project for a manned lunar landing.
Years before the scientific and technic¬
al capability for a successful flight was
sufficiently developed, a project was
begun and its execution "forecast" for
a specific date. A target was set, and
"future history was made".
Normative forecasting has developed
methods for weighing all possible
objectives against each other as
impartially as possible, and for estab¬
lishing priorities. Its range includes
modern theories on decision-making.
A series of methods has been devised
which, using a kind of reverse-planning
technique, starts from the future objec¬
tive and works back to the present; the
necessary intermediate stages are
thus determined and an attempt made
to plot the best possible course bet¬
ween Tomorrow and Today.
The "Relevance Tree" method has
proved to be particularly satisfactory.
Starting from the fixed objective, the
top of the tree, and working down¬
wards, alternative approaches are
assessed and weighed against each
other. Originally developed in the mili¬
tary field, this method has signally
proved its worth elsewhere, for exam¬
ple in the evolution of biology and

take and when, and what finance they
should inject into specific projects.
Simulation techniques occupy a spe¬
cial place among normative methods.
An attempt is made to envisage pos¬
sible conflicts and possible future
developments which have been over¬
looked.
Recently, a new trend in futurology
has gained ground in every country.
It makes men and women of every
race and from every sector of the
social system the focal point of its
activities, and seeks to explore a broad
range of their hopes and aspirations
biological, psychological, political
and social.
Throughout Europe, futurologists
such as Bertrand de Jouvenel (France),
Dennis Gabor (U.K.), Ugo Spirito
(Italy), Johan Galtung (Norway), A.
Sörensen (Denmark), Fred L. Polak
(Netherlands), Ossip K. Flechtheim
(Fed. Rep. of Germany), Igor Bestuz-
hev-Lada (U.S.S.R.), Radovan Richta
(Czechoslovakia), A. Apostel (Roma¬
nia), Andrzen Sicinski (Poland), Edel-
ing (German Democratic Republic), to
name but a few of these specialists,
are turning from technological forecast¬
ing and scrutinizing the future with
humanistic objectives in view.
A similar trend is evident in the
United States led by futurologists such
as Kenneth E. Boulding, John Dixon,
John McHale, Hasan Ozbekhan, John
R. Piatt, Alvin Toffler, Stuart Umpleby
and Arthur Waskow. And here there
is a new development, as imaginative
as it is surprising, in the direction of
"open-ended anthropology".
Thus futurology Is more and more
playing a part which it had not origi¬
nally foreseen for itself. It is becoming
a forum for the discussion of questions
which had been pushed aside in the
fever of scientific and technical pro¬
gress during the last three hundred
years, questions about the meaning
of life and the ethics of human coexis¬
tence.
Whoever decides that the future can
no longer be left to chance and an
often inexorable fate, has to do more
than merely "produce" and "act"; he
needs to turn again to philosophy and
look ahead to the "ultimate problems"
so that, in tackling the immediate ones,
he will have the welfare of future gene¬
rations constantly in view.
Research into the future is thus parti¬
cularly concerned with the problems
that education will face in the years
ahead.

The American Census Bureau esti¬
mates, for Instance, that 125 million
U.S. children will be of school
age in the year 2000. Developing
countries will have an even more
spectacular rate of increase. By the
end of the 1970s, nearly four times
as many children as today in these
countries will be attending school un¬
til the age of 14. The number of uni¬
versity students should rise more
slowly. Nevertheless, by 1985 it is ex¬
pected to double and even treble in
some countries.
The time spent in school is also
expected to increase. Kjell Eide, of
the Norwegian Ministry of Education's
Planning Department, recently carried
out for the Organization for Economic
Co-operation and Development, in
Paris, a "prospective analysis" of Nor¬
way's education needs.
His conclusion was that school
attendance for Norwegians, before
they start work, would leap from an
average of seven years in 1930 to an
average of 11.5 years by the end of
1970 and would average 14 years by
1990. This would mean that not only
a privileged few, but all young Norwe¬
gians would then be attending school
until the age of twenty.
However, the aim of futurology is
not only to assess the educational
problems and possibilities of tomor¬
row, but also to prepare the ground
for new teaching methods.
Robert Tschirgi, Head of the De¬
partment of Academic Planning of the
University of California, believes that
the computer "represents the greatest
opportunity for innovation since the
invention of the printing press."
Data processing machines and pro¬
grammed instruction will adapt the
rhythm of tuition to suit the individual
pupil and will check more accurately
than a human teacher the amount of
knowledge that has been retained.
Furthermore, such teaching machines
will train children to discover the facts
for themselves, to compare and to
assess them.
By leaving the pupil alone at his
desk to do his work in short, logical
stages, programmed instruction will, it
is hoped, free the teacher of the fu¬
ture to undertake more personalised
teaching.
But who will draw up the program¬
mes? Who will make the films in which
famous scientists will record their lec¬
tures for thousands of students? Who
will produce the films and tape-record¬
ings which will in part replace text
books? Who will prepare the televised
classes? Will a large scale "teaching
industry" develop? These are some of
the questions of vital social signifi¬
cance which the futurologists have
to consider.

In dealing with economic questions,
as in any other field of forecasting,
futurology needs to take a global view
and utilize the expertise and resources
of numerous disciplines.
The trends of population growth are
a major factor In economic forecasting.
Within the span of half a life¬
time (that Is, in thirty-five years)
the population of the world will
probably have doubled. This is one of
the most important of almost all econo¬
mic considerations. The production of
food and clothing and the building
of homes for an extra three thousand
million persons will gradually take
priority over all other economic prob¬
lems.
Economic resources will be mobi¬
lized more and more to cope with so¬
cial problems. Air and water pollu¬
tion, noise, traffic congestion, the dete¬
rioration in the quality of life through
the mass "herding" and monotony of
urban living are all, in large measure,
the consequences of a philosophy of
life which has laid too much stress on
economic achievement while giving
scant regard to the high price that has
to be paid for it.
Economic exploration of the future
will thus need to be more concerned
with problems of professional life and
with opportunities of employment. In
the very near future, it will become
almost as important to create new jobs
as to manufacture goods.
The need for a fairer distribution of
jobs, large scale and properly timed
vocational retraining to meet frequent¬
ly changing needs, a totally different
outlook on work, viewed as a "pos¬
sibility" and no longer an "obligation,"
will require economists to give spe¬
cial consideration to psychology, the
study of behaviour, and philosophy.
Questions about "the meaning of life"
will often be raised in the economic
sector. "Homo Economicus" is al¬
ready considered by the younger ge¬
neration as a limited, even atrophied
form of man; soon he will be looked
upon as no more than a relic of history.
Exploration of the future which aims
to serve mankind needs to consider
not only those alive today ; it should
keep in mind the needs of coming
generations. Futurologists will accom¬
plish one of their most important tasks
if they regard themselves as the
"defenders of those not yet born",
whose conditions of life have already
become endangered by lack of fore¬
sight on the part of 19th and 20th
century man.
Even if the new efforts deployed to
explore the future achieved nothing
more than a strengthening of the feel- ^
ing that we today are responsible for I /
the welfare of those who will follow
us, it would by that alone have proved
Its worth.

MILE-HIGH UNIVERSITY. This "up-ended" university campus (left), soaring skywards
for over 1,200 metres (almost a mile) would house 30,000 students. Designed in Paris
by the famous sculptor Nicolas Schöffer, it is a feature of his project for a
"dynamic-space" cityhalf "working" city and half "recreation" or "fun" city
in which Schöffer alternates horizontal and vertical buildings. The flower-petal
city rising into the sky (above) is proposed by a 15-year-old French schoolgirl.
Her "Daisy City" as she calls it appears to have everything except a lift to reach it:
a children's paradise (with unlimited sweets), petal "neighbourhoods" for
gastronomy, cinema, flowers, the forest, the sea, ski-ing, as well as a "realm of
sleep". A busy space programme is in operation at "Cape Kennedy"; alongside,
an empty petal is held in reserve for still undetermined uses.

OCEANOPOLIS. Why not take a tip from the Aymara Indians
of Lake Titicaca, who live on floating, artificial islands made of woven
reeds, and build floating cities? The American architect William Katovolos
sees nothing bizarre in this idea and has designed a floating city
using plastic materials, top right. If cities can be built on the sea,
why not submarine cities? Commandant Cousteau has already shown
the way with his underwater houses. A 15-year-old schoolgirl envisages
a whole underwater city composed of vast, sack-like living areas

The annual solar radiation received by the earth is equivalent to about
35,000 times our present yearly consumption of energy. Attempts at
harnessing this vast energy source have led to the construction
of solar furnaces, distillation plants, hot water systems for housing, etc.,
powered by the sun. A promising line of progress lies in the further
development of the use of semi-conductors, such as germanium
and silicon, by means of which sunlight can be converted directly
into electricity. Solar batteries consisting of hundreds of silicon cells
have already been used on satellites to power Instruments such
as cameras, transmitters and recording apparatus. Right, a Soviet

^g^NTIL quite recently the
term "forecasting" was usually asso¬
ciated with the weather, earthquakes
and other natural processes that could
be neither planned nor controlled.
Nowadays it Is used more and more
frequently in connexion with social
developments in which planning and
control are Important factors: the
social aspects of science and tech¬
nology, economics, social relations,
urban development, education, health
services, state organization and law,
politics, international relations, mili¬
tary affairs, the development of vast
expanses of our planet and the ex¬
ploration of space.
One might ask why we need to fore¬
cast things that can be planned and
controlled. The answer is that every
decision in planning and direction must
have a sound basis and offer, as far
as possible, the best chance of suc¬
cess. The purpose of a forecast is to
provide relevant data, to evaluate both
the probable and the desirable results
of the project being studied, and to
suggest ways of reducing the gap
between them.
Practical experience in many coun¬
tries has shown that forecasting raises
the efficiency of plans, programmes,
projects and decision-making in gen¬
eral, and this explains the extensive
growth in recent years of various
methods of social forecasting.
But this does not mean, as is some¬
times claimed, that scientific fore¬
casting Is of recent origin. Over a
century ago, Karl Marx and Friedrich
Engels demonstrated that it was pos¬
sible to analyse future problems scien¬
tifically. They prognosticated future
developments by analysing existing
trends, and used what have now come
to be known as the systematic ap¬
proach, social modelling, social
norms, etc. In short, their methodo¬
logy of forecasting anticipated the
demands of modern science. Nowa¬
days, the forecasting and planning of
social processes are taken for granted,
but in the mid-1 9th century, the work
of Marx and Engels represented a
bold, new scientific approach.
Research into the future is nowa¬
days developing under the impetus
of the scientific and technological revo¬
lution and its social implications, and
recent qualitative changes in many
spheres of human activity show how
important it is to make exhaustive
appraisals before plans are drawn up
or decisions taken.
The search for solutions to press¬
ing social problems has already pro¬
duced hundreds of practical methods
for forecasting over relatively long
periods and with a comparatively high
degree of accuracy, and has led in
many countries to the appearance of
specialized institutions and groups
whose aim is to produce realistic
social forecasts with these methods AQ
and to develop still more reliable ¿U
techniques.
Such forecasting is particularly
necessary and effective in countries

Spectacular results from the 'systems approach7

Named after Vladimir Komarov, one of
the first Soviet cosmonauts, this U.S.S.R.

with state-planned economies. A case
in point is that of urban development
in the Soviet Union where, in the past
few years alone, over 100 new towns
have sprung up in accordance with a
state plan for the rational implantation
of new industrial centres. Naturally,
state ownership of the land facilitates
the forecasting and carrying out of
such projects.
One could say that social fore¬
casting is based on combinations of
several methods:
Opinion-gathering through polls of
various sectors of the population
and systematic questioning of spe¬
cialists;
Advanced extrapolation, that is, the
verification and analysis of data
from direct extrapolation, using
modern mathematical methods and
cybernetics and the complex tech¬
niques of game theory, the theory
of probability, the theory of func¬
tional research and the theory of
decision-making;
Forecast modelling based on the
"systems approach" (a method
which has already produced spec¬
tacular results in the field of space
research).
Two main types of forecasting
models are used: the "exploratory"
method, which aims to answer the
question: "what will happen if the pre¬
sent trend in this or that field con¬
tinues unimpeded?"; and the " norma¬
tive" forecasting method, where the
question posed is "what would be the
desirable, optimal development of the
process we are studying?"
Practical experience has shown that
short term (1-2 years) and medium
term (3-7 years) exploratory forecast¬
ing is between 95 and 98 per cent relia¬
ble. As yet this cannot be said of long
term forecasts (10-20 years or more).
However, it is not only a question
of whether a forecast eventually comes
exactly true or not; more important still
is for the forecasts to raise the effi¬
ciency of programmes, projects and
decisions. Social forecasting has al¬
ready shown that It can double or
even treble the profitability of an enter¬
prise, reduce planned expenditures by
as much as 5 to 10 per cent, and
speed up decision-making consider¬
ably.
A simple example will help to de¬
monstrate the practical advantages of
forecasting. In a factory manufactur¬
ing television sets, it Is obviously im¬
portant for the planning department to
know what technological changes are
likely to be introduced in the manu¬
facture of television sets within the
next few years, and which types of
sets will be most in demand.
If the management possesses this
information together with the results
of market research into population
growth, changes in social structures,
income levels, etc., it will be able to
concentrate production on the most
profitable lines.
Forecasting is nowadays often spo¬
ken of as a new scientific discipline
a "science of the future". But
though we are now witnessing the birth
of a new science, it is not a science
of the future in general. This new
discipline is concerned with the laws
and methods of forecasting, and to
distinguish it from forecasting proper it
is frequently referred to as "pro¬
gnostics".
Forecasting as such, just like ana¬
lysis or diagnosis, is an essential func¬
tion of the sciences and in this sense
it is not a new but a vigorously dev¬
eloping trend of modern scientific
research.
A
i measure of its develop¬
ment is the fact that in 1970, 293 orga¬
nizations in western Europe were
engaged in drawing up complex, long-
term social forecasts, including 84 in
Britain, 70 in France, 33 in the Fed.
Rep. of Germany, 22 in Italy, etc.
Several dozen such organizations were
also operating in Japan. And these
figures do not include research units
engaged in short-term forecasting or
futurology research for specific
projects.
In 1967, some 600 similar institu¬
tions were operating in the U.S.A., but
saturation point was reached and their
growth stopped. Hardly a single large
corporation, firm, board or institution
was without its own forecasting ser¬
vice.
Later, demands for complex, long-
term forecasts gradually came to be
handled by the bigger U.S. research
organizations and the top experts in
the forecasting field. Of the 356 orga¬
nizations of this kind operating in 1970,
various government-operated or gov¬
ernment-subsidized, services account¬
ed for about one-half, corporations
for a third, universities for a sixth and
various foundations for about a tenth.
The most influential of the futurolo¬
gy research organizations in western
Europe and America include the "Futu-

Academy of Arts and Sciences, in Bos¬
ton, the "World Future Society", in
Washington, the "Gesellschaft für Zu¬
kunftsforschung", In the Fed. Rep. of
Germany, and the "Futurology Asso-,

have convened a number of national
and international conferences and sym¬
posia, among the most important of
which were the international future
research congresses held in Oslo, in
1967, and Kyoto, in 1970.
The 1960s saw the founding of spe¬
cialized magazines such as "Analyse
et Prévision" and "2000" (France), "Fu¬
turist" (U.S.A.), "Futurum" (Fed. Rep.
of Germany), "Technological Forecast¬
ing" (U.S.A.), and "Trend" (Czecho-
slova.kia).
In the U.S.S.R. special departments
have been set up to work on the
theoreticaj problems of social fore¬
casting, and several hundred groups
of scientists are carrying out applied
research and drawing up precise fore¬
casts for factories, industrial groups
and indeed entire industries.
The U.S.S.R. Academy of Sciences
and Soviet ministries are now very
active in these fields. For example,
the scientific councils of the Academy
of Sciences concerned with planning,
social research, etc., have set up spe¬
cial sections to co-ordinate the work
of forecasting specialists on various
boards and institutions, while mem¬
bers of the Soviet Sociological Asso¬
ciation have founded a Forecasting
Institute which conducts permanent
seminars where experts meet to com¬
pare notes on their work.
Specific forecasts have already been
made in the U.S.S.R. concerning de¬
velopments up to the year 2000 in fuel
and power, the water economy, hy¬
dro-power construction and trans¬
port. Long range problems of science
(the manufacture of new materials, the
greater use of chemistry in production,
the future possibilities of biology, etc.)
have been studied, and a scientific es¬
timate has been made of the extension
of higher and specialized secondary
education in the 1970s.
Social forecasting services are being
set up in the German Democratic
Republic and Bulgaria. In Poland, a
state committee, "Poland in the Year
2000", has been established under the
chairmanship of the Vice-President of
the Academy of Sciences. Similar
research groups are being set up In
Czechoslovakia, Romania and Hungary.

Mimicking the movements of a human arm and hand with ghostly
precision, this Soviet-developed artificial arm and hand unit brings
new hope to amputees. Myoelectric impulses (the tiny electrical
impulses emitted when a muscle contracts) are picked up by
electrodes attached to the stump of an arm, amplified and used
to activate a miniature motor which opens or closes the artificial
hand. Amputees fitted with these ingenious false limbs can undertake
such delicate tasks as shaving, sewing, painting and model-making.
Thanks to the almost incredible advances made in electronics, the
machine has indeed become an extension of the human brain.

representatives from the East European
countries, were held in Prague in 1967
and 1968 to discuss "Man and Society
in the Scientific-Technological Revo¬
lution". Two further symposia took
place in Moscow, in 1970, one concern¬
ed with scientific, technological, soc¬
ial and economic questions, the other
with medico-biological forecasting.
The greatest progress has been
made in the forecasting of scientific,
technological, economic, demographic
and criminological trends which are
comparatively easy to express statis¬
tically, but the forecasting of trends in
ethnic processes, public education,
culture and sociology, which are more
difficult to define in numerical terms,
have tended to lag behind.
In global terms, there is a need for
more systematic forecasting on the
long-term consequences of the tech¬
nological revolution, on the easing of
international tensions, on the slow¬
down and ultimate halting of the arms
race, and on partial or complete disar¬
mament. The Specialized Agencies of
the United Nations, and in particular
Unesco, could play a major role in
these studies.
The increasing pollution of the bio¬
sphere, for example, is closely linked
with the dynamics and balances of
world fuel and power, raw materials
and transport. Even an outline fore¬
cast of critical situations that might
arise in the future, along with sugges¬
tions for meeting them, would be of
immense use.
The long-term problem of the
world food situation is a major pre¬
occupation of the Food and Agriculture
Organization. The "green revolution"
and technical advances in the produc¬
tion of synthetic foods open up vast
horizons. Yet despite these scientific
and technical successes, social condi¬
tions in the world are such that two
thirds of its people are still under¬
nourished, with one-half actually living
under conditions of starvation. Fore¬
casts made with a view to achieving a
sufficient food balance could be of
capital value in the war against hunger.
A crucial factor in the development
of Asian, African and Latin American
countries is the problem of finding
employment for their exploding popu¬
lations. To meet this problem, dozens
of new agricultural and industrial areas
will have to be created on these
continents.
In this connexion, the International
Labour Organization will certainly need
to devote its attention, among other
measures, to projects that have been
drawn up for a general "reconstruc¬
tion" of vast areas of the African,
South American and Asian continents.
Appropriate use of the potential hy¬
dro-electric power of African rivers,
particularly the Congo, would provide
water for the irrigation of millions of
acres of lands which could then be¬
come hinterlands for dozens of big
industrial centres. The Aswan High
Dam, built in the United Arab Repu¬
blic with aid from the Soviet Union, is
a striking example in Africa of a major
engineering enterprise designed to
transform and develop a national eco¬
nomy.
However, in such far-reaching pro¬
jects there is an inherent danger that
we may unwittingly disturb the balance
of nature. But such risks could be
reduced to reasonable proportions by
systematic forecasts and studies. Con¬
sidering the social significance of such
projects, it would be advisable to begin
this research immediately.
No less urgent is the need for
forecasts on long-term problems
posed by a reconversion of the world
economy in the event of a halt being
called to the arms race and, beyond
this, the prospect of partial or com¬
plete disarmament.
It is sometimes suggested that the
arms race should be allowed to go
on merely to forestall the danger of
economic dislocation. It would surely
be more sensible to consider this
whole question on a scientific basis,
by attempting to construct a series of
exploratory and normative forecasting
models relating to the reconversion of
the world economy on a regional and
global scale.
The forecasts could cover not only
economic aspects, but also prospects
for a positive development of interna¬
tional relations, including the progres¬
sive easing of international tensions,
the completion of de-colonization, the
halting of the arms race, the banning
of weapons of mass destruction, and
complete and general disarmament,
with effective control over all these
measures exercised by the United Na¬
tions and its Specialized Agencies.
Finally, the forecasts could tackle
the problems of reorganizing the mili¬
tary-industrial potential of the devel¬
oped countries as resources for boost¬
ing technological and social progress
on a global scale.
A programme of this scope and
vision would need the services of many
research organizations, and a leading
role could fall to the scientific bodies
of the United Nations, particularly
Unesco.
And in this quest for peace and
disarmament, the specialists engaged y J
in social forecasting would have a '
major responsibility to plan for its
success.

PONDERING
THE IMPONDERABLE
by Pierre Piganiol
D
ECISION-MAKING has
always Implied looking ahead, that is,
looking at the future, or as the late
Gaston Berger termed it "a pros¬
pective approach". However, it Is
only in the past 20 years that this
prospective approach has been pro¬
perly defined. (1)
The speed at which modern society
is now evolving ¡s a completely new
factor the importance of which cannot
be underestimated. Our acts today
will bear fruit in a world very different
from the one in which they were
conceived, and even the great con¬
querors of history who wanted to
dominate and change the world
rarely Imagined that future societies
would be very much different from
those they lived in.
Gaston Berger expresses his
message in a brilliant style which
gives a clear picture of his main lines
of thought. Society to him is like
a ship tossed on a vast ocean which
needs pilots to guide it through the
rocks, but also requires a prophet to
set the course.
Unfortunately, simply to define a
prospective or forward-looking attitude
is not enough to enable us to select
a line of action, and at the time of
Berger's death, in 1960, the available
method for making such a selection
left much to be desired.
Here the futurology approach con¬
sisted mainly in pinpointing certain
data which were recognized, intuitively
or otherwise, as having a determining
influence in shaping the future, and
carefully studying all the possible
implications of any decisions taken.
At about this time there was
developed, first in the U.S. and very

PONDERING THE IMPONDERABLE (Continued)
Computerized happiness, computerized happiness, computerized
soon thereafter all over the world, a
technique for choosing a course of
action with reference to the very
specific needs of those who had to
make Important decisions in military or
industrial matters.
Research carried out In this field
led in one instance to the "Relevance
Tree" method (see page 14), which
stresses the need to formulate clear
criteria and to give a weighting (index
of relevance) to each element con¬
sidered In relation to these criteria,
some of which may be purely objective,
but which, in most cases include
concepts relating to quality.
This qualitative weighting is difficult
but very necessary since it allows the
method to be extended to cover human
problems more complex than straight¬
forward technological choices.
Improvement of these methods was,
of course, linked with parallel progress
in methods of forecasting the most
likely future scientific discoveries.
In the last few years we have seen an
increase in such research and the crea¬
tion of techniques that range from the
systematic classification of the opi¬
nions of a panel of experts (the Delphi
method, see page 12), to the logical
analysis of the patterns of science
from which those likely to lead to
future discoveries can be deduced.
Despite their obvious limitations, all
these methods have proved extremely
valuable and, since 1968, there has
been a temptation to apply them not
only to technological choices but to
the evolution of society as a whole.
It was quickly realized, however
that the "Relevance Tree" form of
reasoning was inadequate for the study
of the complexities of the social world.
Futurologists have therefore, made use
of the "systems" approach which,
endowed with a highly sophisticated
mathematical technique, had been
widely applied in the management of
modern industry.
So we have now reached the stage
when we can devise the first "social
models" that can be handled by compu¬
ters,, thus making it possible to draw
the outlines of the dynamic evolution
of the world situation in a future which,

for some models, extends as far as the
year 2050.
We have come round full circle and
are returning to Gaston Berger's
"prospective attitude" which in the
meantime has been enriched by better
de'fined, computer-assisted methods of
reasoning.
There is clearly a risk that the
method may finally obliterate the ob¬
jectives. But in my view, we cannot
afford to neglect any new methods or
techniques or spurn the research aids
and tools now available to us. Though
the present "models" we set up may
be far from perfect, they" have much to
offer us, even if they do no more than
force us accept their more rigorous
and precise standards and abandon
mere verbalism.
Although I shall be pointing out a
number of difficulties that are still in¬
herent in these newly developed meth¬
ods, I do not wish to give the impres¬
sion that I have nothing but criticism
for them. My aim is to encourage their
development and to suggest guiding
principles for their use rather than to
arouse unjustified suspicion of them.
B
UT having said this, I
would add that prudence is necessary
for many reasons. The first is that
social problems are extremely complex
and we have still much to learn about
the cause and effect relationship bet¬
ween a decision in the field of human
affairs and its actual consequences.
I know of no model which is not
obliged take into account the changes
in population either in a particular
country or in the world as a whole;
yet as demographers are well aware, it
is extremely difficult to isolate the fac¬
tors that determine the rate of popula¬
tion increase. One can try to link this
rate with standards of living, progress
in medicine, availability of raw mate¬
rials, the quality of food or the amount
of energy available.
This exercise is very important. If we
apply it to the past it confirms the
curve followed by the actual growth
rate of population up to 1970. But I do
not see this as absolute proof of its
validity when applied to the future.
For this, after all, is what interests
us, and here the models indicate some
far-reaching transformations such as
the slowing down of the population
growth rate during the next century.
In brief, the first difficulty lies in
our ignorance of the fundamental and
indeed nighly complex laws of demo¬
graphy.
The second difficulty is due to the
number of factors to be taken into
account. Here also demography offers
an example.
Recent studies relating to a Latin
American country revealed in great
detail what would happen if the popu¬
lation level was suddenly to become
constant.
One might imagine that this situation
would solve many economic problems.
But this would be an oversimplification.
A levelling-off in population would re¬
sult in remarkably far-reaching fluctua¬
tions in the school population, and in
the ratio of working to non-working
population. This ratio could fluctuate
by up to 100 per cent in a series of
oscillations over several centuries.
This hypothesis is, of course, Uto¬
pian and it is impossible to imagine
(perhaps this is just as well) how
the fertility rate could be reduced from
6 to 0.6, then made to rise again gra¬
dually over a period of thirty years and
finally made to fall again that is, to
subject the fertility rate to a series of
subdued oscillations which would
result in a constant population level.
The third difficulty arises from the
fact that experimental verifications are
impossible. A model can, of course,
be tested against the past, but this
suggests implicit acceptance of the fact
that transformations have not been
sufficiently strong to have thrown
doubt upon the structure of the model.
I may be wrong, but I do not have
confidence in a model simply because
it has given a correct description of
the events of the last twenty years;
I even tend to think that it might have
been adjusted to achieve this result.
These models also suppose that
various aspects of society can be
represented with the help of certain
indicators, some quantitative (national
income, future yields, etc.), and some
qualitative (feelings of happiness, free¬
dom, etc.). These indicators are ob¬
viously "global", that is, they include
both the many aspects of a particular
social situation as well as the whole
range of individual human behaviour.
The problem is to know what use
these indicators will serve in a period
of crisis. We should not forget that
these models are established so as to
enable us to analyse forthcoming
crises, and it would be a pity if this
were precisely what they lacked the
ability to do.
Perhaps models are subject to the
same phenomenon as may be observ¬
ed in certain mechanical appliances.
A network of pipes, for example, may
be equipped with a fine set of pres¬
sure gauges, but when "hammering"
occurs in the pipes the gauge readings
bear no relation to real pressure. It
may well be wondered whether some
recent analyses, both of society as a
whole and of a number of industrial
companies, do not contain inherent
errors precisely because they are
using faulty indicators.
Thus, to the material difficulty of pro¬
cessing data whose interactions are

happiness, compu...
often difficult to foresee, another prob¬
lem is added: a somewhat arbitrary
simplification of social phenomena.
We may be agreed on the need for sim¬
plification for the sake of understand¬
ing, but it is much more difficult to
accept over-simplified presentations of
reality when the time comes to make a
decision. Premature over-confidence
in the results of what are still experi¬
mental methods for exploring the fu¬
ture, and their adoption as a basis
for decision-making would be ex¬
tremely dangerous.
A further difficulty, perhaps even
more serious, may be added to those
already mentioned. Technological fore"-
casting has developed in a world which
has a certain control over innovation
in products or processes, and we
already have a sketchy, though work¬
able, idea of the innovative process.
Nothing comparable exists in the social
sciences.
We may conclude this list of diffi¬
culties (without, however, completing
it) by an important comment: every
society has its contradictions; its com¬
ponent sub-systems to borrow an over¬
used mechanistic phrase, are by no
means coherent among themselves.
The problem is that they mesh with
one another just sufficiently so that
the tensions created by the underlying
contradictions do not exceed accep¬
table limits.
In the present situation, perhaps we
should ask ourselves: are our models
and the machines exploring them capa¬
ble of inventing new structures and
resolving existing contradictions?
What I have said could give the
impression that I am opposed to the
use of these models. I hope I have made
it clear that this is not the case. By
all means let us use these models but
with caution accompanied by a much
more scrupulous analysis of those fac¬
tors in our society that have an in¬
fluence in determining the future.
Let us identify a few of the most
striking, if not the most important, of
these factors.
Nowadays, throughout the world, we
are witnessing a wave of enthusiasm
for higher education. Several major
countries have already reached the
stage at which about 50 per cent of
people of an age to enter higher edu¬
cation in fact do so.
A society in which 50 per cent of
citizens have reached this level can
in no sense be run in the same way
as those in which the training of spe¬
cialists and administrators is restricted
by the limitations of the education
system.
There is bound to be an increased
desire for responsibility and partici¬
pation in decision-making. And this
desire will emerge in a world in which
production units and groups providing

When the last tree has been felled by the last lumberjack to make
way for the latest industrial complex, will nostalgia for the days
of autumn leaves and "the darling buds of May" impel us to reforest
the land with reinforced concrete conifers and plastic poplars?
"From now on", says Pierre Piganiol, "human activities, multiplied by
population growth, will have to be studied from the point of view
of their interaction with the natural environment".

PONDERING THE IMPONDERABLE (Continued)
services will become larger and larger
and in which, consequently, the oppor¬
tunities for responsibility will be fewer
than could be desired.
In these conditions, tensions will
appear which will probably lead to
careers of a cyclic type in which
periods of carrying out orders will
alternate with periods of responsibility
and periods of study. This is, of
course, only a rough outline.
Periods of study will also be made
necessary by the rapid Increase In the
amount of new knowledge required
and by the accelerated renewal of the
material means which determine a
society's way of life.
Two aspects of study therefore
emerge: the cultural and the practical.
In order to understand the world in
which he lives, each person throughout
his life, will need to broaden his know¬
ledge of society, in order to contribute
as a citizen to Its improvement. Study
as the key to a fuller life will become
a feature of fully developed societies.
On the practical level, each man
will need either to keep his working
knowledge (his working tool which
becomes ever more rapidly obsolete)
up to date, by re-training, or to acquire
new knowledge (another working ins¬
trument), by re-conversion. This will
demand social structures that enable
each person to undertake additional
study which will be continuous In the
cultural sphere and periodic but Inten¬
sive on the practical side.
This raises the problem of Income.
It Is very likely that for psychological
reasons the range of salaries will
become smaller, with the level of
remuneration linked more closely to
the man than to the job. It Is also
probable that systems of benefits will
be established for those who leave
their work in order to study.
One can see looming on the horizon
a period in which income will no longer
be distributed indirectly, as in the past,
through payment for work (or possibly
through accumulated capital), but by
other means a situation which can
already be partly seen today.
A second essential factor having a
bearing on the future is the growing

Influence of man on his natural envi¬
ronment. Formerly, man was marked
off by his capacity for thought from
the rest of nature which his presence
hardly disturbed and then only in loca¬
lised areas. Today the situation has
changed and our energy requirements,
for example, mean that we release Into
the atmosphere considerable quantities
of carbon dioxide which can cause
climatic changes.
From now on, human activities, mul¬
tiplied by population growth, will need
to be studied In terms of their reper¬
cussions on the natural environment.
The forecasting of imbalances or of
new states of equilibrium has become
essential.
Finally, a third factor: decision¬
making in a complex world implies
extensive knowledge; it requires ex¬
perts. But how far can these experts
take account of public opinion or be
controlled by It? Is there not a consi¬
derable risk of establishing a more or
less esoteric technocracy?
This closes my list of examples.
Some ambitious projects attempt to fit
every aspect of society into a parti¬
cular model and, in particular, to deal
with the factors I have used as exam¬
ples by analysing their interactions.
What is one to think of this?
The three problems outlined above
are clearly very different. The second
deals with a concrete problem,
a difficult one certainly since it
concerns meteorology, but one which,
nevertheless, can be expressed in the
form of a model. Indeed, it has
recently proved possible to make a
map of Europe, in connexion with pro¬
posed Industrial activities in England,
showing the sulphur fallout In rain.
The first example deals among other
things with the supply and demand
ratio for skilled manpower. It is pos¬
sible to make a model of this; it would
be only approximate, but would, never¬
theless, be of considerable help to
further studies.
The third and last example presents
a typical problem of organization and
psychology. Nothing is more difficult
than to assign numerical values to the
"feeling of freedom" or the "sense of
responsibility," and It Is obvious, for
example, that air-line pilots can hardly
be selected by universal vote.
From this is clear how complex
futurology is and how difficult It is to
reduce it to a series of simple formulas
or a simple mode of action.
Depending on what approach is
taken, the work of the futurologist
may be worthwhile and effective (even
if certain elements of information are
uncertain) or it may be naive and
even dangerous (even if the work
appears to be based on highly sophis¬
ticated reasoning).
When all is said and done, planning
the future cannot be reduced to a sim¬
ple problem of logic (though logic must
of course guide all our decisions).
Equally Important are common sense
and questions of ethics.

Unesco anniversary
poster competition
To mark Unesco's 25th anniversary this
year, the Unesco affiliated International
Association of Art is organizing a competi¬
tion for young artists (aged 15 to 25) to
design a poster illustrating the theme "A
World Fit to Live In". A first prize of
$500 and five additional prizes of $100
will be awarded. Further details from local
International Association of Art Offices or

Unesco best known
U.N. agency in Japan
Unesco is better known in Japan than
any other U.N. Specialized Agency accord¬
ing to a nation-wide public opinion poll on
the popularity of the .United Nations and its
Specialized Agencies and what the Japanese
know about their work.
In the poll, carried out last year by the
Japanese Prime Minister's Office at the
request of the United Nations Association
of Japan (UNAJ), persons over the age of
20 were picked at random for questioning.
The results, published recently in a spe¬
cial issue of the UNAJ "Kokuren News"
devoted to last year's U.N. 25th anniversary
celebrations in Japan, showed that 66 per
cent of those questioned knew about
Unesco and its work. Next in order of
popularity came ILO (51 per cent), follow¬
ed by the International Monetary Fund
(42 per cent), World Bank (38 par cent),
UNICEF (36 per cent), Economic Commis¬
sion for Asia and the Far East (27 per cent)
and FAO (14 per cent).
Eighty-six per cent of those polled said
they knew about the United Nations and
78 per cent thought it was doing well.
Only four per cent found its performances
completely negative, while 58 per cent said
it needed strengthening.
Five-nation seismic survey
Unesco is to undertake a $4.2 million
seismic survey in Bulgaria, Greece, Roma¬
nia, Turkey and Yugoslavia on behalf of
the United Nations Development Program¬
me. The Balkans have suffered heavily in
recent years from a number of devastat¬
ing earthquakes. The 4-year project
covers the setting up or modernization of
four observatories and 14 smaller stations
equipped with seismographs and other
Instruments. Data obtained will be used
to produce maps of seismic risk for desi¬
gners, engineers and architects responsible
for town planning, housing and public
works. The UNDP will contribute $700,000
towards the project with the remainder of
the cost being borne by the countries
concerned.
Flashes...
M Nepal has banned tiger shooting and
the import and export of tiger skins as a
contribution to international efforts to save
the animal from extinction.
Two stone tablets covered with cunei¬
form inscriptions describing the construc¬
tion of King Darius' palace at Susa in
522 B.C. have been excavated by a French
archaeological team working in Iran.
Japan recently passed 14 anti-pollution
laws including one requiring industries
responsible for pollution to pay up to
100 % of the cost of preventative mea¬
sures.
M The International Development Associa¬
tion is lending Pakistan $25 million for
reconstruction in areas stricken by last
November's cyclone disaster.
International aid for 4 million refugees
The welfare of an estimated 4 million refugees is
today the concern of the United Nations and its Special¬
ized Agencies. To remind the world of this huge and
still growing problem, the U.N. Postal Administration
last month issued a commemorative stamp (right) on the
theme "International Support for Refugees" . It is
printed in three denominations (6 and 13 cents and

Letters to the Editor
THE ROOTS OF CULTURE
Sir,
I thought the December 1970 issue
of the Courier, on "Carthage must not
be destroyed" was magnificent, but the
one on "Cultural Policy" (January 1971)
I found rather depressing.
Surely, of all institutions, Unesco
should be the last to encourage all
these nations to try and foster "national
pride and dignity" on the basis of some
alleged heritage connected with their
part of the world. To my mind, an
Italian of today has no more connexion
with Roman civilization than anybody
else, nor for that matter a Tunisian with
Carthage.
Everybody, but especially your Jamai¬
can and Kenyan contributors, seems to
talk about culture as if it were some¬
thing mystical brought down upon their
people from somewhere. To my lay
mind, culture is simply something that
grows out of the contributions of indi¬
vidual men and women.
I do not know about African and
Asian languages, but I know that
someone who is "cultured" or cultivé or
kultiviert, is so not because he was
born in England or France or Germany,
or is an exponent of that particular
culture. It always struck me as absurd
and pathetic for people to feel compell¬
ed to stick labels of so-called "national
origin" to cultural achievements, such
as talking about the "German" scientist
Albert Einstein, just because the place
where he was born happened by chance
to be situated in Germany.
Should not Unesco rather emphasize
the inter-relation of culture that Euro¬
pean culture anyway seems to have
originated in the Middle East, that
Négritude has made an important impact
on Western civilisation, and that instead
of the strenuous efforts of some to
boost their "national" egos, they should
rather start thinking more in terms of
universality and humanity.

OLD MANGBETU CUSTOM
Sir,
The caption to the photograph of a
pottery vessel published in your January
1971 issue (on page 28) describes it
as a water jug "made by an African
craftsman of Mangbetu".
It should be pointed out that "Mang¬
betu" properly describes not a place,
but a Nilotic people from the region
of Isiro in the North of the Democratic
Republic of the Congo.
It is interesting to note that until
some thirty years ago it was a Mangbetu
custom to deform the shape of their
children's skulls by binding the head
tightly with cords immediately after
birth. As the head grew it assumed a
kind of sugarloaf form and the eyes
took on a somewhat slit-like appear¬
ance.
Their distinctive hair style and the
elongated shape of their heads gave
the Mangbetu the characteristic appear¬
ance that is clearly recalled in the
sculptured head on the vessel you
show- J.J. Deheyn

BLIND MAM'S BLUFF
Sir.
The photo and the text recounting the
well known Indian fable of the blind
men and the elephant ("Blind Man's
Bluff", page 16 of your January 1971
issue) remind us that we published the
same fable in the January 1970 number
of our magazine, "Rapports Techniques
du CEBELCOR" (Belgian Centre for the
Study of Corrosion).
I enclose the pages on which we
published an English version of the
fable in verse, "The Blind Men and the
Elephant", written by John Godfrey
Saxe (1816-1887), along with a French
translation of the poem (from my; pen).
You will see that we added several
verses in French, appropriate to the
work done by our centre, inspired by
an American metallurgist, Dr. Benjamin
Floyd Brown. The drawing illustrating
our text was the work of Madame Philip
Dahlberg.

Director, Belgian Centre

John Godfrey Saxe together with our
rendering of the verses in French added
by the Brussels Centre Editor.
THE BLIND MEN
AND THE ELEPHANT
By John Godfrey Saxe
It was six men of Hindostán,
To learning much inclined,
Who went to see the elephant
(Though all of them were blind);
That each by observation
Might satisfy his mind.
The first approached the elephant,
And happening to fall
Against his broad and sturdy side,
At once began to bawl,
"Bless me, it seems the elephant
Is very like a wall."
The second, feeling of his tusk
Cried, "Ho! what have we here
So very round and smooth and sharp?
To me 'tis mighty clear
This wonder of an elephant
Is very like a spear."
The third approached the animal
And happening to take
The squirming trunk within his hands
Then boldly up and spake;
"I see", quoth he, "the elephant
Is very like a snake".
The fourth stretched out his eager
[hand
And felt about the knee,
"What most this mighty beast is like
Is mighty plain", quoth he;
"Tis clear enough the elephant
Is very like a tree."
The fifth who chanced to touch the
[ear
Said, "Even the blindest man
Can tell what this resembles most;
Deny the fact who can,
This marvel of an elephant
Is very like a fan."
The sixth no sooner had begun
About the beast to grope
Than, seizing on the swinging tail
That fell within his scope,
"I see", cried he, "the elephant
Is very like a rope."
And so these men of Hindostán
Disputed loud and long,
Each of his own opinion
Exceeding stiff and strong,
Though each was partly in the right,
And all were in the wrong!
Additional verses inspired by some
reflections on corrosion research by
Dr. Benjamin Floyd Brown.
To readers, friends, researchers
Seeking stress corrosion's key,
This humble fable nurtures
A moral all can see.
Microstructures, dislocations,
Mechanics of break and strain,
Physi-chemical relations
And chemistry pure and plain,
Corrosive interactions,
All electro-chemistry,
Films that interdict reactions,
Cathode, anode alchemy,
As the wise Floyd Brown related,
"Here's the whole anatomy
Of stress corrosion stated
With clear simplicity.
"But a perfect comprehension
Of the problem we can't wrest
From each separate point I mention
Isolated from the rest.
"We must give consideration
To the problem as a whole;
Overall examination
Is the way to reach our goal."

THROUGH THE LOOKING-GLASS
The wide-eyed glance of the young woman in our photo is reflected, not
in a mirror, but in a "memory plate" from a Siemens computer. Its shiny,
nickel-iron surface, composed of 3,150 cells, can record and recall up to
10 million units of information per second. After an initial obsession with
technological forecasting, futurology seems to be turning more and more
to a scrutiny of man's social future. Dare we hope that the machine will
be reduced to its proper proportions a mute reflection of human genius?
