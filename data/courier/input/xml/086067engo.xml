Today there are no more
unexplored continents,
unknown seas or mysterious
islands. But while we can
overcome the physical
barriers to exploration, the
barriers of mutual ignorance
between different peoples
and cultures have in many
cases still not been
dismantled.
A modem Ulysses can
voyage to the ends of the
earth. But a different kind
of Odyssey now beckonsan
exploration of the world's
many cultural landscapes, the
ways of life of its different
peoples and their outlook on
the world in which they live.
It is such an Odyssey that
the Unesco Courier proposes
to you, its readers. Each
month contributors of
different nationalities provide
from different cultural and
professional standpoints an
authoritative treatment of a
theme of universal interest.
The compass guiding this
journey through the world's
cultural landscapes is respect
for the dignity of man
everywhere.

was born in Galicia in 1916, was awarded the
Nobel Prize for Literature in 1989. In this
interview he talks about the process of
literary creation, the role of the writer in
society, and the wide international influence
of literature written in Spanish, to which his
own work has made a major contribution.
Camilo José Cela
How would you judge Spanish literature of the past few
decades, and what is your opinion of the "boom" in Latin
American literature?
I hate passing judgement on anybody, and I am neither
a historian nor a literary critic. We creative artists are poor
judges and critics, since we tend to applaud everything that
approximates to our own view of art, although that is rather
presumptuous of us.
Nevertheless, I would say that the Spanish novelists of
my own generationMiguel Delibes, Torrente Ballester,
Ana María Matute and Juan Goytisolo, for exampleare
excellent, much better than the younger generation of
writers.
As for the "boom" in Latin American literature, I think
that it is mainly being created by publishers. Some very
important writers are being left out. There is no reason to
believe that today's star Latin American novelists are any
better than their predecessors, such as Rómulo Gallegos,
Benito Lynch or Miguel Angel Asturias, all of whom have
unfortunately faded into oblivion. Being Latin American
does not necessarily make anyone a great novelist, surely.
I would have thought that was obvious.
Do you think that the fact that you have been awarded
the Nobel Prize will have any direct impact on Spanish
literature?
It may well arouse enthusiasm for literature, in much
the same way as the passion of Spaniards for tennis was
stimulated by the successes of Manuel Santana, their passion
for football by the victories of Real Madrid, and their
passion for golf by the exploits of Severiano Ballesteros.
You have lived through a golden age ofliterature, with such
writers as Camus, Huxley, Moravia and Sartre in Europe,
and Hemingway, Dos Passos, Faulkner and Steinbeck in
the United States. What do you think now of that period
and how do you see your own work in relation to it?
It was an extraordinary period and my own work is
permeated by it. I have always said that we are influenced by
the atmosphere around us. When Albert Camus published
The Outsider and I published The Family ofPascual Duarte,1
people even wrote doctoral theses about the cross-influences
between them. Later on, when we became friends, we found
this very amusing because at the time when our novels were
published, we were both completely unknown and certainly
did not know one another.
You have devoted your life to literature. Have you ever
asked yourselfwhat purpose literature serves and what it
represents for a people?
In my case, writing is a necessity. If I want to make
contact, with myself or with my fellow human beings, it
has to be through words. In the history of mankind, the
moment when the first man uttered the first word is much
more important than the discovery of America, or the moon
landing, quantum physics or theories of the atom.
What is the purpose of literature? Certainly not to put
the world right. That is not the writer's role. We must
remember that literature is one of the fine arts. Its purpose
is to make art out of wordsthat's all. For a people, litera¬
ture is everything, because it gives it a sense of permanency,
much more so than architecture. Words last much longer
than stones.
How do you write? How do you go about composing a
novel, for example?
If only I knew! The novel is a protean art-form which
nobody has ever really managed to define. A novel is a piece
of prose with a title and the word "novel" attached to it
except that a novel may also be written in verse, since the
poem El Cantar de Mío Cid is a novel.
A novel comes to me spontaneously. It is not something
I set about deliberately. When I have a novel inside me
and it may stay inside me for several yearsI do not think

about how I am going to develop it. At some point, it will
begin to take shape by itself, at a steady pace, over a period
of eight to ten months. I do not believe in writing scenarios
first. If the characters are alive, you have only to open the
door for them and see what they do. And the story of what
they do is the novel.
a4s a methodical writer, do you believe in inspiration?
No, not in novel-writing, although inspiration may be
useful in lyric poetry. Dostoevsky said somewhere that
genius is a matter of long and patient endurance. When you
are writing a novel, you have to work on it for hours on
end, day in day out. And you need great physical strength
to reach the end.
It has been said that the Spanish identity is the result of
afusión ofChristian, Arab andJewish cultures. Is that also
true of Spanish literature?
I once wrote a book called Jews, Moors and Christians.
Might that have something to do with your question? Spain
has had some great "marrano" writers who were descended
from the Jews, like Cervantes and Saint Teresa of Avila. Yes,
indeed, there was a melting-pot and I do not believe that
"The Bullfight" (1945),
oil on canvas (114 x 144 cm),
by the Catalan artist Joan Miró (1893-1983).
there is a single Spaniard who could put his hand in the fire
and solemnly swear that he does not have a drop of Jewish
or Moorish blood in his veins. Ferdinand and Isabella made
a glaring political mistake when they decided to expel the
Moors who were working the land and the Jews who were
in trade, banking and jewellery-making, while the Christian
noblemen waged war. Fortunately, very few of them left
the country, and those who stayed on produced the
Spaniards of today.
There are two magnificent lines of verse by Fernando
Villalón, which read:
Islands of the Guadalquivir,
Where now are your Moors, who did not want to leave?
Spanish culture's leap to the Americas five centuries ago
made it universal...
In fact it already was universal, since it was present in
Italy and the Netherlands, at least. Its universal character
was consummated in the Americas, if you like.

Do you think that Spanish as a language, with its extraor¬

In a few years' timeI don't know how manythere

Spanish, Arabic and Chinese, and I am not citing them in
any particular order. All the rest will have retreated into
the spoken idiom or into lyric poetry. It is true that we in

it is one of the world's major languages. Our government
in Madrid should learn a lesson from the heroic efforts which
the Basques and Catalans are making to ensure the survival
of their languages.
What contribution, in your view, has the Spanish novel
made to world literature?
I have always believed and maintained that the novel
was born in Spain. El Conde Lucanor, the first book of fables
in our literature, was written several years before Boccaccio's
Decameron, which is generally regarded as being the first
real novel.
Be that as it may, the Spanish novel has had a far-
reaching influence on world literature. There is an essay-
by Gertrude Stein, I seem to rememberwhich demonstrates
that the modern novel originates in the Spanish picaresque
tradition. From the nineteenth century until today, all
novels, including the great American novels of the 1920s
and those of the Spanish Generation of '98,2 have been
offshoots of the picaresque model.
Cervantes is a landmark in the history of literature, but
Don Quixote is an even greater landmark. I have often won¬
dered whether Cervantes, like Homer, was not a number
of people writing under a single name, since there is such
an enormous gap between Don Quixote and his other works,
such as the Novelas ejemplares. Don Quixote is a work of
genius and even when we read it today and see its many
imperfections, we realize that they are so brilliantly inspired
that there are grounds for thinking that they may have been
deliberate. I am not claiming that this is so: I am just guessing.
Having said that, I consider that the greatest writer in
the Spanish language is, and will long remain, Quevedo.
When I think oí Don Quixote, Quevedo, the medieval poets,
the picaresque novelespecially Lazarillo de Tormesthe
Generation of '98 and the 1927 generation of poets,3 1 feel
that Spanish literature has always been great and out of all
proportion to Spain's paltry achievements in economics and
politics.
In the twentieth century, the Spanish contribution to
painting, prose and poetry has surpassed everything that
France, England, Germany and Italy combined have
managed to produce. Picasso, Miró, Dalí and Tapies are there
for all to see, while in literature you have poets like Miguel
Hernández, Lorca and the Generation of 1927, and prose-
writers like Unamuno, Valle-Inclán, Baroja, Azorín, Ramón
Gómez de la Sernathe list could go on.
There has been a great deal of talk in recent years of the
"global village", ofthe trend towards a worldwide culture...
I don't believe in it.
What do you see as the factors that can give a universal
bearing to a circumscribed work of local literature?
The geographical setting and the plot are less important
than what lies beneath the action of the characters because,
when all is said and done, the great overriding passions are
universal. The Spanish picaresque novel was centred on the
landscapes of Spain, much as the great Russian novels are

are both read all over the world.
We live in a culture that is dominated by images and yet
never have so many books been published. Do you think
that the written word will be capable ofwithstanding the
onslaught of the audio-visual media?
I am not sure that contemporary culture is "dominated"
by images. I do not believe either that television has a
stultifying effect on people or that a single image is worth
a thousand written words. I believe that anything that can
arouse interest in culture is worthwhile, and such interest
may well be aroused by television.
Writing will survive television, just as it will not be
abolished by tactile perceptions, because the senses
stimulated are different. I do not think that one sense should
prevail over the others. The important thing is for the senses
to work together. Interview by Ramón Luis Acuña, Madrid.

re do we come from? What are we? Where are we
going?" An abundance of myths, religious doctrines and scientific
theories have been developed to answer these fundamental questions
about the world and man's place in it.
In early times, especially, many societies elaborated cosmogonie
myths which gave an account of the origination of the world or
the universe. Some postulated a world created from the void by
the power and wisdom of an omnipotent and omniscient God; for
others creation xdid not take place ex nihilo but from an already
existing substance. Some communities envisaged the world as the
offspring of a primordial father and mother; others believed that
the created order emerged progressively, like the growth of a fetus.
Some creation stories feature prominently in the sacred writings
and beliefs of the world's great religions. Traces of others survive
in the customs and traditions of many lands and in the symbolism
used in arts and crafts. An idea of the prodigious diversity of human
response to questions about our origins can be gauged from the
sample of creation myths and traditions presented in the following
pages.
Today scientists studying the behaviour of the universe are
proposing new theories and answers to these eternal questions. And
like time-honoured myth, modern cosmology is concerned not only
with cosmogony but its opposite, eschatology, the end of creation.
This issue of the magazine is, then, rounded off with an account
of a theory on an expanding and contracting universe which has
been developed by a modern cosmologist, Stephen Hawking, and
like many ancient mythsenglobes the birth and also the ultimate
destiny of the universe.

The Vedas ffo quest for
an inner Universe
BY RAO CHELIKANI
AND ROSELINE DE LAVAL
I
10
N the beginning were the Vedas. Several cen¬
turies before the Christian era, these sacred
hymns written in archaic Sanskrit held sway over
Indian religious thought. We know very little
about their origins, other than that they were
introduced by Indo-European clans known as the
Aryas or Aryans, nomadic herdsmen who gradu¬
ally began to spread through north-west India in
the second millennium BC.
One thing is certain: during their obscure his¬
tory the Aryans had amassed a huge quantity of
religious writings, a "Revelation" of gigantic
proportions. This is thought nevertheless to
represent no more than a quarter of the complete
Vedas, the gods having decided, at the end of the
Golden Age, to keep the remainder outside the
reach of human beings. It is perhaps for this
reason that, while each of the four parts of this
vast compilation is devoted to a particular aspect
of religious life rituals, mythologies, wisdom
and hymnsnone proposes a comprehensive cos¬
mogonie myth. To the origins of the world, it
contains only indirect allusions and scattered,
incomplete and contradictory references.
The Creator is not the same from one hymn
to another. Sometimes we are told that Indra the
Great, after slaying the dragon, created the
oceans, the sun and the web of days and nights,
sometimes it is related that Varuna, by sheer
force, separated the two vast cosmic masses from
the primordial egg, pushing back the celestial
vault to a great height and unwinding the earth.
Tradition has it that the Vedas contain the
Truth, but this Truth assumes a myriad of dis¬
concerting forms, like the tree that symbolizes
India, the banyan, whose foliage is so dense that
it blots out the sun.
For example, in many of the Vedic hymns
the origin of the world is traced back to a terrible
battle in which each of a succession of gods is
described as having the leading role. The dragon
slain by Indra is sometimes said to be a gigantic
serpent coiled around the mountain that holds
back the primordial waters. After defeating the
serpent, Indra shatters the mountain in order to
release the waters. More than an act of creation,
this battle is a deliverance. Until that moment,
order and harmony are held in check by such
powerful forces that the hero-god wears himself
out against them. He has to avail himself of
supernatural means, the beverage soma, prepared
by the other gods, which plunges him into a state
of warlike intoxication. Indra, the god of light¬
ning, who usually takes the leading role in the
battle, combines the qualities of all the other gods,
who created him for this encounter, entrusting
to him part of their power. So it is these amalga¬
mated forces that triumph over darkness and
formlessness, bringing into being a world that is
not subject to chance but ruled by necessity,
where each being and thing has its place.
Should these cosmogonie myths be seen as
a way of asserting the value of the warlike ideal
and of justifying a caste, a people of invaders? Is
it the function of the Aryans, "twice born"
through the grace of Revelation, to establish
order and to promote the worship of the revealed
gods by combating the forces of chaos and dark¬
ness embodied in the unenlightened peoples?
In the heat
of the primordial waters
In other myths the origin of the world is linked
to an act of cosmic union. Agni (the fire, the life-
force, the devourer) and Soma (the offering, the
sacrifice, the devoured), the two pillars of Vedic
reality, fertilize the waters with their virile power
and give birth to the primordial egg, the Golden
Embryo. When the egg bursts, there emerges
from it the structure of the world: from the silver
half, the earth, from the golden half, the sky.
They are held in place by a central pillar, an axis,
around which the forces of life are organized in
such a way that the light can spring forth. Then
"time commences, space unfurls and the gods
start to play their role".*
Other cosmogonie myths feature a god who
existed before all others, Prajapati, the Progenitor,
Lord of his own lineage. Prajapati splits himself
in two, coupling with his female emanation, who
is also regarded as his daughter. From this
incestuous union (considered to be extremely
reprehensible) issue all the gods and all dualities.
Creation is thus rooted in the very substance of
Prajapati.

Seen from another angle, Prajapati causes the
gods to come into being by turning the primal
fervour upon himself. The gods then complain
that there are not enough offerings to feed them.
In order to prevent his creation from vanishing,
Prajapati sacrifices himself. Once they have
received succour, the gods restore Prajapati by
giving up a part of their own substance. Hence
Prajapati is at once the Father and the Son.
In what is perhaps the most famous hymn
in the oldest document, the Rigveda, which all
Brahmans are required to recite every day, we are
told how the activity of Prajapati led to the emer¬
gence, along with the gods, of a primeval cosmic
man, Purusa. He it is whom the ravenous gods
demand be sacrificed to them, and Prajapati has
to allow them to dismember him. This dismem¬
berment gives rise to the four main social divi¬
sions (priests, warriors, craftsmen and farmers),
but also to the heavenly lamps, the directions of
space, the sky and the earth, rain, wind and fire.
Once they have eaten, the gods can give a part
of their strength to recreate a new man. A micro¬
cosm of the universe, composed of the very
forces by which he is governed, this new man is
inhabited by the gods, embodying the ultimate
message of Indian philosophy, which is that the
individual soul forms part of the universal
Essence. Self-discovery, self-understanding and
self-control enable one to discover, understand
and control the universe.
The cosmogonie myths do not seek to unravel
the mystery of origins or to resolve an existen¬
tial question. They represent rather an invitation
to contemplate the manifold forces present in the
universe, to understand their logic and to trace
them back to their source in order to celebrate
their action and weave the web of their cor¬
respondences, revealing the same energy, the
same beauty, manifest in all things. Recognizing
these forces in himself, man can transcend them
in their scattered multiplicity in order to partici¬
pate in the universal process. To do this, he must
adopt a particular mode of life and comply
with certain social practices: each daily gesture
expresses and as it were embodies these forces.
Each act ritualized by means of offerings and
sacred utterances is part of a never-ending process
of creation. And each person in his place, in his
caste, in his station, is his own priest, being
part of the whole, a fragment of a single reality.
The churning
of the Sea of Milk
After coming into contact with vast urban civili¬
zations and their very ancient religions, and once
it had been removed from the context from
which it had sprung, the Vedic religion withdrew
into itself. Ritual, growing more and more com¬
plex, assumed an importance that divested it of
all meaning. It was then that Jainism and Budd¬
hism appeared, each with its own ideas about the
origins of the world and its evolution. As the

number of tendencies increased and as one school
of thought gave way to another, a huge body of
literature grew up, giving rise to new cosmogonies.
One of the most frequently illustrated themes
in Indian religious art is the churning of the Sea
of Milk. In the beginning there was an ocean of
milk from which emerged Mount Mandara, the
axis of the world. This mountain rests on the shell
of a tortoise, an avatar of the god Vishnu. Around
the mountain, which is fought over by gods and
demons, a huge serpent is coiled. Each of the con¬
tending parties pulls on one end of the serpent,
thereby causing the mountain to swivel round.
The axis turns, the milk is whipped up and from
it all kinds of blessing spring: the nectar of
immortality, beauty, happiness, mystic rapture
and sweetness. This concrete image, based on
such an everyday act as the making of butter,
conveys an essential message, which is that an
indistinct entity exists, containing a virtual

power, an axis. For it to be stirred into motion,
a battle is necessary, which reveals the possibili¬
ties harboured by the indistinct entity.
Other hymns describe an eternal divine prin¬
ciple, Narayana (one of the many names by
which Vishnu is known), resting between the des¬
truction of the previous world and the creation of
the next. Narayana floats upon the ocean of milk,
supported by the great serpent Ananta (eternity),
coiled beneath him, with, at his side, Lakshmi, his
female manifestation. When the world is created,
a lotus emerges from his navel. When the flower
opens, Brahma comes forth and recites the four
Vedas. As these eternal laws are uttered, the
world and all things in it are formed.
The origin of the visible world can be neither
a god nor the concentration or dispersion of a
primary element. It results from the attainment
of equilibrium among the primary elements,
which are in opposition to one another. The
thought of Brahma is the pure energy that makes
up all the forms of the universe. It radiates out
in accordance with a strict logic, giving rise in
turn to all the manifestations of reality, all levels
of consciousnessfrom pure consciousness of the
self, mind and intelligence, to the senses and the
object of the senses, matter, the visible and in¬
finitely divided translation of the unique energy.
Man seeks by various paths to regain the
original unity. The quest for knowledge is noth¬
ing but a way of approaching this goal: "all
efforts to understand the nature of the universe
are a search for the indestructible Person. The
mere observation of changing forms cannot con¬
stitute true science." From this quest, engaged in
by every human being since the dawn of time,
it emerges that "the impressions of the senses are
discontinuous and deceptive. Only our inner
universe is accessible to us.... Our perception of
the outer world is but the projection of our in¬
ner world. For this reason, the entire 'Hindu'
pantheon is but a picture of man's inner life."*
With the passing of the centuries, the differ¬
ent versions have not merged into a single version
but have, on the contrary, grown more numer¬
ous. The incredible diversity of life had to be
matched by an extremely subtle symbolic lan¬
guage. The thirty-three primary gods of the Vedas
became 330,000, corresponding to ever more
finely drawn distinctions between the forces
manifested in the manifold spheres of existence.
There has never been any question, in Indian
thought, of reaching a consensus as to origins or
of establishing a theology. The object is rather,
through the multiplicity of experience, to pin¬
point a reality which is known to underlie all
things but which can never be grasped. Tran¬
scending schools of thought, religious sectarian¬
ism and ethnic intolerance, Hinduism affirms that
all points of view, resulting from different levels
of observation, complement and enrich one
another, weaving an increasingly dense fabric of
knowledge which is laid upon the Unknowable.
Is not science too just one more point of
view? Tradition has it that each Vedic hymn has
thirty-two different meanings, each of which is
applicable to one of the thirty-two sciences. Many
learned treatises have been written on the basis
of each of these interpretations. Ascetics have
imputed the origin of creation to water, fire,
wind, ether or the rhythmical oscillations of the
cosmos. Other scholars have expressed scepticism
with regard to the sacred texts of the Upanishads
(speculative teachings), denying the existence of
the gods and attributing the origin of the world
to a principle which they have called fatality,
time, nature, the void or chance, suggesting that
creation was the result not of divine intervention
but of a process of internal evolution or ripening.
Another school of thought claims that the world
is composed of atoms.
All this has scant importance in the eyes of
the wise, who see here no more than subsidiary
verifications of the changing forms of matter, in
the long quest leading to the indestructible laws.

and literary allusions, and were reflected in forms
of architecture and music.
The Qur'anthe Word of God as "recited"
by its last messenger, the Prophet Muhammad,
does not provide a continuous narrative of the
creation of the cosmos, but contains many direct
allusions to it. God, "the Lord of the Worlds",
is the Creator of the universe: "In truth, We have
created all things according to Our Law" with
"seriousness" and perfection. "Thou seest in the
Benefactor's creation every thing in true propor¬
tions." Inveighing against the polytheists, He
declares: "Do not the unbelievers see that the
heavens and the earth were joined together,
before We clove them asunder? We made from
water every living thing. Will they not then
believe?"
Thus, before the heavens and the earth were
formed, they were inextricably joined. Water is
the source of life. The worlds, the heavens, the
earth and life thus appeared in several stages: the
universe and its inhabitants were the result of a
process of gradual differentiation. "God is He
Who created seven firmaments and of the earth
a similar number. Through the midst of them
descends His command: that ye may know that
God has power over all things, and that God
comprehends all things in His Knowledge."
According to some scholars, the number seven,
which appears elsewhere in the sacred text, indi¬
cates an indefinite plurality.
God created
the heavens and made
the stars
In addition to those verses that allude specifically
to the creation of the universe, there are others
which inform us of its organization and arrange¬
ment, notably on "the nearest heaven". God
created the heavens "without visible pillars" and
"established" in them many heavenly bodies:
constellations of stars, or "lamps". As proof of
His bounty, this harmonious stellar arrangement
is useful to mankind: "It is He Who has made
for you the stars that they may guide you in the
depths of darkness on land and sea", as it is also
"He who created the night and the day, the sun
and the moon, each in a navigable sphere". "It

is He Who made of the sun a brightness and of
the moon a lamp, and Who determined the
phases of the moon so that ye may know the
number and the count of the years."
Direct allusions to the creation in the Qur'an
must be considered primarily as "signs" of God's
omnipotence. Their fragmentary nature and the
mysteries they conceal are typical of Qur'anic
predication, for "God conceals what He will"
and "alone knows the unknowable".
So is all speculation forbidden in Islam? Cer¬
tainly not: the signs must be deciphered and their
true meaning understood. According to Ali, the
son-in-law of the Prophet, "there is no Qur'anic
verse that does not have four meanings: the exo¬
teric, the esoteric, the limit and the divine
project". We need, therefore, to go beneath the
surface of the facts. The quest for God's truth
calls for reflection on this "miracle" of the crea¬
tion of a diverse sensory world, while God is
spirit pure and unique.
Avicenna1 made a major contribution to
Islamic cosmogony. In his metaphysics, he clas¬
sifies beings according to whether they are neces¬
sary or possible. In essence, the necessary being
is by its nature unique; it has no cause nor does it
consist in multiplicity. As First Principle, Pure
Intelligence and Pure Truth, the necessary being
is God. Creation is an intellectual act. It is the

Primary Emanation or Primary Intelligence.
From this primary creation new entities emerge.
After a series of contemplations and intelligences
the Tenth (active) Intelligence is reached, from
which springs a flux of sublunary matter and the
multitude of human souls. This is "our" world
the world of the senses and corruptible matter.
Avicenna's theory of emanation, with its con¬
tinuous creation of differentiated and hierarchical
beings, has been the subject of lively debate in
Islam, Christianity and Judaism. Thus, Averroës,2
who wished to restore a cosmogony which con¬
formed to Aristotelian concepts, rejected the
notion of hierarchy between separate intelli¬
gences. He considered the idea of successive ema¬
nations from a single Being as fundamentally
absurd. According to him the cosmos proceeds
from an "eternal beginning" of which the
manifestation, without creative cause, is simul¬
taneous and continuous, with God as Prime
Mover.
For Al-Ghazali,3 all these contortions were
simply metaphors for establishing the necessity
of the Demiurge and the reality of creation.

dered that only the way of the heartfor God

stances", the angels.
Several schools of thought reject emana¬
tionism, which appears to limit and even exclude
God's freedom in the act of creation. To uphold
the idea of divine omnipotence, the Ash'arites,4
for example, go so far as to deny intermediary
causes and the universal cause. They consider that
matter is indivisible, and reduce its multiple
differentiations to a transcendent principle, which
is God the Creator. The idea of the indivisibility
of matter leads to the recurrence of creation. In
each of its parts and at any given moment the
universe is, or can be, subject to modification.
Furthermore, it cannot be eternal: its cohesion
and duration are matters for the free will of God.
Esotericism
and philosophy
Nevertheless, many currents of Islamic thought,
including hermeticism, Shi'ite speculation (and
its Ismaeli variants), and some mystics, have given
Avicenna's cosmogony a better reception. In
such thinking, modes of philosophical and theo-
sophical knowledge, visionary and prophetic
perceptions often merge in a single theory.
Typical of these currents, but also descended from
other cultic and cultural traditions, is
Suhrawardi's philosophy of light.5 Starting from
verses of the Qur'an in which God is qualified
as "Light on Light", Suhrawardi identifies
separate intelligences as pure lights, each one
emanating from another. The Tenth Intelligence
is the Angel of Revelation, the Holy Ghost, the
one who spoke to the Virgin Mary and to the
Prophet Muhammad.
A universe is affixed to each of these primor¬
dial lights. The cosmos is the sum of these
universes, including the lights that govern them
and the radiation they mutually reflect. It is
organized into four worlds: the world of pure
intelligence, the world of celestial spheres, the
world of sublunary elementary beings, and the
world of subtle forms and images. The latter
world, which is halfway between the worlds of
the sensory and the supra-sensory, plays a leading
role in Suhrawardi's reasoning, where rational
speculations and imaginative visions are resolved.
It sets out and opens up the path to a refined
gnosis.
These concepts bear witness to the fact that
in Islam, cosmogony is ontologically necessary
for accession to the Supreme Truth. As theory
and reflection on the formation of the cosmos,
it englobes all aspects of the process of creation.
But in its ultimate development it can become
one with God Himself. In fact, many Muslim

mystics maintain that the cosmos was created to
satisfy God's desire for self-knowledge. Did not
Ibn 'Arabi6 state that "God wished to see His
own essence so as to demonstrate His mystery
to Himself"? So the final consequence of the one¬
ness of Being"there is no Being but the Pure
Being"is that cosmogony is a reflection of this
divine desire. It thus attains a metacosmic level
which only the most vertiginous form of
knowledge is permitted to reach!
These concepts, which had wide currency in
the intellectual circles of classical Islam, engen¬
dered many passionate arguments. It is extraor¬
dinary that this philosophical and religious
ebullition did not hold back scientific studies of
astronomy and cosmography.

<![CDATA[
Xhe French anthropologist Pierre Clastres once
wrote that the Guarani Indians of South Ameri¬
ca are "the theologians of the forest". It is cer¬
tainly true that their conception of the creation
reflects the subtlety and the complexity of their
thought.
The Guarani cosmogony, unlike most others,
does not postulate the pre-existence of a Creator.
Genesis takes place in several complex stages,
beginning with the self-creation of the supreme
deity Namandú. In the midst of the primeval
darkness, Our Father-the Ultimate-the Foremost-
the Primordial "caused his own body to emerge"
from the original chaos. This self-creation ema¬
nated from a radiancethe divine wisdom-
located in what was to become Namandú's heart.
The majestic process unfolds like the bur¬
geoning of a tree. All the imagery used to describe
it is borrowed from the plant worldfeet are
plants, arms are branches, fingers are leaves, and,
crowning all, the head is a magnificent tree-top
in full leaf.
The second stage of creation is anthropogen¬
ic, although it does not concern the origin of
human beings as such, but of speech, their dis¬
tinguishing attribute. A fragment of the divine
word, speech will enable the Guarani, the "Chos¬
en", to communicate with the divinity and to
enjoy the distinctive condition of the gods-
immortality. This divine yet human speech, the
cement of society that forms and shapes the com¬
munity and ensures its collective solidarity, is
called ayvú, to distinguish it from ñe'e, the speech
used in human relations.
The next stage involves the creation of the
four principal gods, who will help Namandú in
his arduous cosmogonie task. Each of the four
is allotted a specific field of action: Namandú
Great Heart is the master of words; Karai is
master of the flame, of the fire of the sun; Jakairá
is master of the fog that moderates the heat and
of the revitalizing mist; Tupâ is master of water,
of the sea and its extensions, of rain, thunder and
lightning. Each of these gods creates for himself
a companion known as the "true mother".
The pillars of the sky
The fourth and final stage in the creation con¬
cerns the genesis of the first land, the land of man
and woman, of plants and animals. A blue pindó
or palm-tree arises in the centre of this land-to-
be. (The colour blue symbolizes the sacred.) The
tree is sustained by four other palm-trees spread
out in the directions of the four winds and of time
(in Guarani, a single word, ara, covers these two
concepts). Five blue palm-trees, like the fingers
of a hand, thus support the bedrock of the earth.
Then comes the creation of the firmament, which
also rests on four pillars, with a fifth added to
prevent the heavens from shifting when buffeted
by the winds.
With the creation of the first earth comes a
piecing together of its different componentsthe 19

aquatic world, the subterranean world, the dry
land, day and night. The existence of these
separate entities became perceptible as animals
gave them shape. Thus, the serpent outlines the
surface of the land; the song of the "little coloured
cicada" gives birth to sound; the girino beetle
gives life to the waters as it skims above them in
acrobatic flight; the green grasshopper creates the
prairies, since, wherever it alights on the ground,
the grass begins to grow; the armadillo is "the
first to violate the bedrock of the earth" with its
burrowings; night falls when the owl, "mistress
of the shadows", closes her eyes in sleep.
At last the moment comes for Namandú to
create man and woman. This act of genesis is not
described. Our Father-the Ultimate-the
Foremost-the Primordial grants "wisdom" to the
"Chosen" and orders the god Jakairá to place the
halo of life on their heads so that "the revitalizing
mist shall crown the heads of my sons and my
daughters". He commands Karai to "lodge"
within his beloved daughters and sons "the
sacred, beautiful flame", and he enjoins Tupâ to
implant the "fountain of freshness" in the "heart
of hearts" of his human creations.
The Fall
His task accomplished, Namandú withdrew to
his eternal abode, leaving in the hands of his
helpers the destiny of his creationthe first earth,
perfect, devoid of evil, on which man and gods
lived in harmony. So long as they observed the
rules that led to perfection, the humans could
hold their heads as high as the gods and share with
them the supreme attribute of immortality.
The timeless time of eternity came to an end,
however, when man failed to observe these rules
and lapsed into animality. The Fall was brought
about by a serious transgression, incest, commit¬
ted by Jeupié with his father's sister, in flagrant
violation of the Guarani kinship laws.
The punishment that followed was the des¬
truction of the first earth, which disappeared

under the waters of the flood. The sole survivors
of the cataclysm, however, were those who had
committed the crime of incest. Through the
power of prayer and ritual incantations, they
managed to swim to an eternal palm-tree where
they escaped death by climbing into the safety
of its branches. Not only did they survive, but
Jeupié, "the master of wicked love", acquired
divine status and became the head of a category
of minor gods.
What an astonishing transformationinstead
of being punished, the guilty one found himself
promoted to a higher rank! By committing incest,
Jeupié had, in effect, defiantly rejected his human
condition and thus had placed himself beyond the
law, making himself the equal of the gods who are
above guilt and for whom nothing is prohibited.
Our Father-the Ultimate-the Foremost-the
Primordial encountered many difficulties in
creating a new earth. Many of his acolytes refused
to take on a task doomed to failure. In the end,
Jakairá agreed to create a new, imperfect earth,
knowing full well that it "already held the seeds
of rupture and of the misfortune of our sons and
of the last of our children".
The rupture between the divine and the hu¬
man worlds was confirmed with the inauguration
of the "imperfect earth", the "land of woeful
life". Man lost the immortality inherent in his
dual human/divine status and had to resign him¬
self to his new condition as a mere mortal. But

this rupture left its mark upon his ancestral
memory and added a further dimension to Guara¬
ni mythologythe unrelenting search for yvy
maraey, the land without evil, itself a part of the
world in which we live, where it may be possi¬
ble to regain immortality in life and, perhaps, also
after death.
This search retains all its immediacy for the
Guarani people, who still, from time to time, set
out on messianic wanderings.
An enduring symbolism
It is interesting to observe how religious syn¬
cretism has welded together the symbolism of the
Guarani and Catholic cultures.
In Paraguay widespread interbreeding has
ensured the social and biological survival of the
indigenous people and of certain elements of their
culture. The Guarani language, for example, was
generally used throughout the colonial period and
is still predominant in Paraguay today.
Evangelization, however, was relentlessly
pursued to achieve "the necessary extirpation of
indigenous idolatry". Rigorous orthodoxy
demanded conversion of the indigenous popula¬
tion to "the true religion", a task unwaveringly
carried out by the Society of Jesus. In the Jesuit
missions, for over a century and a half the scene
of an extraordinary social experiment, the Indians
were kept occupied with art and craft activities
to "save them from idleness". The art they prac¬
tised, however, was intended essentially to con¬
vince and convert. Under the strict control of the
Jesuits no room was left for their "disciples" to
exercise their powers of imagination. They were
considered to be "excellent copyists" but devoid
of any creative talent.
However, close examination of the paintings,
altar-pieces, images, statues and buildings of this
periodespecially of the decorative details, which
was left mainly to the disciplesreveals a number
of elements taken from the mythical universe
of the Guarani. Baroque, the then dominant aes¬
thetic trend, lent itself to the discreet introduc¬
tion of various forms of indigenous symbolism.
Thanks to the fluid rhythms and the profusion
of detail characteristic of the baroque period,
Guarani animism surreptitiously found its way
into the nooks and crannies of the official art
forms. In one piece of sculpture depicting the
angel of the Annunciation blowing a trumpet, for
example, the angel is portrayed standing on a
pindó palm, the same tree which, in Guarani
mythology, supported the first earth and the fir¬
mament.
It was above all during the eighteenth century,
when their confidence that the conversion was
complete led the evangelizers to soften their
intransigence, that plant themes proliferated in
the works of the indigenous people employed by
the missions. The works of this period feature,
in addition to plant-life, saints whose hair-styles
recall the jeguaká, the decorative mark of "the
Chosen", which in turn is reminiscent of the self-
creation of Namandú, whose flower-decked
headthe triumphal plume was the crowning
symbol of Guarani theogony.

<![CDATA[
IN the pantheon of the Fulani people of West
Africa, the Supreme Being is Gueno, the Eternal,
the Omnipotent, the Creator, Preserver and
Destroyer He who bestows life and takes it
away. Both good and evil stem from Gueno, as
is made clear in the prayer: "Give me Thy good,
not Thy evil, but if Thou givest me Thy evil, give
me the strength to endure it." Idleness, vice and
war all stem from Gueno. This is regarded as nor¬
mal, for His authority is unquestionable and He
owes no explanations to humankind, any more
than the head of a family owes any to his
children.
Obedient to the traditions which govern their
upbringing, the Fulani never rebel against their
parents or consider them unjust, even when they
are harshly treated. Parents, chiefs and elders all
have rights. If one of them distributes property
unequally and a young man complains, he is
asked: "Are Gueno's shares equal?" And he is
told: "No, they are not. Take then what you have
been given and when your time comes to appor¬
tion shares, do as you see fit."
In the Fulani tradition, unlike Islam and
Christianity, there is no Satan on whom evil
intent is polarized. When the devil is referred to
in the initiatory narrative known as Kaïdara,
which forms part of the tradition, a substitute
word is used. In reality, the devil is a spirit or
"genie", since Gueno is not in direct contact with
human beings. First of all there are his "emana¬
tions", supernatural spirits who act as "channels"
for him. They include Kaïdara the Initiator,
Jeddo-Dewal the Evil One, and the primal gods
such as Ham, Dem, and Yer, to whom sacrifices
are offered. Next there are an infinite number of
génies specific to the elements (the spirits of air,
water and fire), génies (such as the génies of
Kaïdara) who serve supernatural spirits, and
génies who roam free in nature and contrive to
help or torment human beings. A beautiful dream
is sent by a good genie, whereas an ugly suspi¬
cion is the work of an evil genie. Lastly, there
are génies who perform special functions in food
preparation, hunting, crop growing, animal hus¬
bandry, and other activities. This means that
there is a teeming "occult" population which

lives in the "land of shadows" inhabited by the
suudiibe or hidden beings, invisible spirits that can
assume all kinds of physical forms.
This is a land lying midway between the
"land of clarity" inhabited by visible beings and
the "land of darkest night", the abode of the souls
of the dead and the unborn not only the souls
of humans but those of animals and plants. These
are the three lands of the Fulani.
Kaïdara is therefore "a beam radiating out
from the burning centre formed by Gueno". He
may assume a multitude of visible forms, but he
usually prefers to adopt the features of deformed
old men or beggars, to help him lead astray
would-be opportunists or shallow individuals.
It has not been possible to attach a precise
meaning to the word Kaïdara, but it could be
said to denote "aim", "limit", "boundary" or
"finality".
Why should the word mean "aim" and why
do people strive at all costs and endure many or¬
deals to grasp the mystery of Kaïdara?
The reason is that Kaïdara is the god of gold
and of knowledge.
Gold is a royal metal around which basic
myths throughout West Africa have been con¬
structed. But why was gold an esoteric substance
long before it had a monetary value? Because, it
is said, gold "never rusts and never tarnishes".
It ¡s the only metal which can become "cotton
while remaining iron", and "with one gram of
gold, it is possible to spin a thread as thin as a
strand of hair and circumscribe an entire village
within it". Gold is also "the pedestal of
knowledge, but if you confuse knowledge and
its pedestal, then the pedestal will fall and
crush you".
Yet while adventurers are attracted more by
gold than by knowledge, Kaïdara typifies
knowledge, which even dictates the form he
assumes. An extraordinary being with seven
heads, twelve arms and thirty feet, perched on
an endlessly rotating four-footed throne, Kaïdara
represents the structure of the world and time:
the seven days of the week, the twelve months,
and the thirty days of the month. He represents
the perpetual movement of the earth, the four

world of humankind.
Kaïdara epitomizes knowledge of cosmic
order and disorder alike: pervasive dualism and
the annihilation of some beings by others. He
represents knowledge of the laws of society, but
also of the laws of psychology. Every symbol
encountered on the path taken by Kaïdara
corresponds to a human type, with its positive
and negative aspects. The three pieces of advice
given by Kaïdara himself are aimed at ensuring
that the laws of nature and of the ancestors are
absolute, yet without divulging their secrets. Woe
betide anybody who does not respect them!
But the knowledge of the god of knowledge is
unfathomable and that is probably why his name
means "limit", since he personifies the limit
placed on human knowledge. He is "remote yet
very close", since we think that we can easily
understand him, whereas in fact he is inexhaust¬
ible. It is significant that, at the end of the initia¬
tory narrative, Kaïdara takes three steps back
when the man he has just initiated wishes to
embrace him in a gesture of joy, for there must
always be a distance and a veil between master
and pupil, between god and man, and between
knowledge and its imperfect approximations.!

the sun BY GALINA KAPTUKE-VARLAMOVA
I
JuONG ago, the Evenk people of northern
Siberia believed that the sun, the moon and the
sky were their cosmic parents, founders of the
universe and the source of all life on earth. They
inhabited a vast upper world, Ugu Buga, which
had its own taiga, rivers and oceans. Beneath Ugu
Buga stretched the boundless sea of Lam Buldyar,
ruled over by Savaki, son of the sky.
The chief figure in this ancient Evenk cos¬
mogony is the sun, Dylachankur, master of light
and warmth. Each morning Dylachankur rises
and orders his youngest son, Garpani, to take a
torch made of birch-bark to the hole in the upper
world in order to bring light to mankind. As
Garpani approaches the hole the earth grows
lighter, and when he puts his torch to the hole,
day breaks.
Dylachankur himself works all day long
gathering warmth for the people. But when he
pulls down the curtain-door of his tent and stokes
the fire in his hearth, autumn comes to the earth.
And winter comes when all the warmth is
gathered into his huge leather sack inside the tent
and the door is tightly closed. When Dylachankur

Thunder roars and lightning flashes.
At this time of year the call of the cuckoo, the
shaman bird, can also be heard. She is sent to the
earth to sing praises for the returning warmth and
light and to awaken spring. With the first peals
of thunder and the first cries of the cuckoo, the
Evenk celebrate the coming of spring. For eight
days, the feast of Ikechik, they sing and dance and
give thanks to Dylachankur, the sun, for the
warmth that has come to the earth.
Legend has it that long ago Dylachankur had
a wife, Bega, the moon. They lived together and
had childrenthe sun-rays. But once, when they
were travelling across the sky, Bega left behind
their ollon, a hook for hanging up a cauldron.

utensil, Dylachankur told her: "Don't go back,
or you'll fall behind for ever." "No, I won't,"
the moon answered, and she went back to fetch
the ollon. Alas, she never caught up with
Dylachankur and their sons, and she is still trying
to do so. When the sun rises the moon is nowhere
to be seen, because she has gone back to fetch the
hook, and when the sun sets the moon immedi¬
ately appears in vain pursuit.
Evenk hunters referred to a fixed point of
brightness in the night sky (the Pole Star) for
orientation. They named it Buga Sanari ("the
hole in the sky"). Through this hole they believed
it was possible to reach the upper world. They
marked the passing of time by the nightly appear¬
ance of the Great Bear constellation, which they
named Havlan, the she-elk of the sky.
The hunters used to say that during the day¬
time the she-elk and her calf (the Little Bear) hide
in the forests of the sky. When darkness falls, they
come out to graze on the high peaks of the moun¬
tains and then they can be seen. But the bogatyr

she-elk each night. His wide skis leave a trail
the Milky Way. Mani overtakes the she-elk and
kills her, but the calf escapes. By the next night,
the calf has grown up and takes her place in the
night sky with a new calf. Again Mani puts on
his skis and continues his hunt.
According to another version of this myth,
Hoglen the elk steals the sun, thus taking day¬
light away from the earth. He hides the sun
beneath his belly and runs with him across the
sky. Night falls on earth. Mani comes down to
see how the Evenk live, but it is dark on earth
because Hoglen has taken away the sun. People
cannot live without light and warmth, so Mani
decides to help them. He puts on his skis and sets
off in pursuit of Hoglen, armed with a bow and
two arrows. He skis with all his might, overtakes
the elk and shoots his first arrow, but in the dark¬
ness he misses the target.
Hoglen the elk runs across the sky, with
Mani the bogatyr in hot pursuit. They run for a
long time, and all the while the earth remains in
darkness. At last Mani overtakes the elk once
more and, running by his side, draws back the
bow-string to its limit. This time the arrow finds
its mark. Mani takes the sun from Hoglen and
28
brings light back to the earth. And so it has been
ever since, which is why night always follows day
and day follows night.
The earth-diver myth
The Evenk believed that the earth was created
by Savaki, son of the sky, who lived in the upper
world of Ugu Buga with his elder brother Khargi.
Savaki asked the golden-eye duck and the diver
bird to help him create a "middle world" by
bringing sand and clay from the sea-bed. The
golden-eye dived three times but it could not
reach the bottom. Then the diver plunged into
the sea but at first had no success either. It dived
again and this time it just touched the bottom
with its beak. Then it rested for a while and tried
again, diving so deep that it caught up a beakful
of earth. When the diver came up it spat out the
earth and an islet was formed, which gradually
grew larger and larger. Khargi was envious
because his brother had created the land, while
it had never occurred to him to do anything like
that himself.
Savaki, meanwhile, looked at the bare land
and was not pleased with it. Nothing grew on
it, nobody lived there. So he made up his mind
to create plants, mountains, rivers and lakes.
Every day he came down from the upper world
to the earth to work. Khargi also came down to
spy on him. The land was growing wider but it
was not solid enough, so Savaki set fire to it. The
fire raged for a long time, and when it was extin¬
guished lakes and rivers appeared in the burned
places. Next Savaki asked for the help of the
water dragon, Dyabdar, who had the enormous
horns of an elk. Dyabdar dived under the earth
and as he swam the twisting of his body raised
hills and mountains.
Savaki then began to create trees and grasses,
intending to make only plants that would be
useful to man, but the envious Khargi was
watching him and imitated everything he did.
When Savaki created a larch, Khargi made a pine.
The Evenk never use pine as firewood because
its smoke hurts the eyes. Savaki created a birch,
and in trying to copy him Khargi produced an
alder, a tree which is virtually useless to the
Evenk apart from the dye that can be extracted
from its bark. The furious Khargi finally cried:
"From now on I'll only create that which is
useless or harmful to man."
Thus man can eat all the animals and birds
created by Savaki, while Khargi's creations are
inedible. When Savaki created a grouse, Khargi
created.. .a woodpecker. In the end, Savaki
proscribed the eating of meat from his brother's
creations.
Finally Savaki began to create men and
women. He wished them to be immortal. The
dog, which resembled man in that it could speak
and had no fur, was helping him. Its duty was
to guard Savaki's creations so that Khargi could
not spoil them. One day when Savaki had gone

in search of clay and iron (which he needed to
make man's heart), Khargi came to the hut in
which the finished figures were kept and where
the dog was on guard.
"Open the door and let me see what my
brother has created," he said. "No," answered
the dog, "Savaki forbade me to open the door
for you." Khargi found a crack in the wall and
blew through it with all his might. It grew very
cold and the naked dog was freezing. Khargi
noted this and repeated: "Open the door, I'll just
look at my brother's creations and then I'll give
you warm clothes for good. You will never be
cold again." So the dog opened the door.
Khargi licked the clay figures all over, spat
on them, and said: "My brother wanted to make
people immortal, but I'll spoil his creations. They
will no longer be immortal but will be subject
to diseases that will make them die before their
When Savaki returned he was very angry
with the dog and said: "Now you will become
a real dog, you will grow fur and forget human
speech. You will understand everything, but
instead of answering you will just wag your tail.
You will always walk with a leash round your
neck and look at man's back." He drove the dog-
out, and that was the end of their friendship.
Savaki breathed warmth from his fire into the
clay figures and they came to life. Then he
returned to the upper world and named the earth
Dulin Buga, which means "middle world". On
taking his leave, he gave the people their tradi¬
tions and the rules that govern their life and con¬
duct. As for Khargi, he left for the place that he
had created for himself, the lower world that is
the source of everything harmful to man.

...
cosmos BY FLOR ROMERO
Ahe Kogua, or Cagaba, people are a mainly
farming community of South American Indians,
who number some 5,000 and live on the slopes of
the Sierra Nevada de Santa Marta, in Colombia.
They farm scattered plots of land to which they
travel along stone-paved roads made in the forests
by their ancestors, great builders whose customs
and beliefs they still observe.
The Kogua do all they can to avoid cutting
down trees, to ensure that the rivers run unfet¬
tered along their natural courses and to preserve
the tombs and sanctuaries of their forefathers.
The stars, the vagaries of the wind and the pat¬
terns of plant and animal life are an open book
to them. They have learned to read the heavens,
where "everything is written, everything can be
seenthe past, people and animals". From their,
mountain-dwelling ancestors they have inherited ',

a very ancient calendar which features Huso (the
crab), Neuiheldji (the otter), Mebbtashi (the jaguar)
and Tarbi (the serpent).
They treasure the ancestral lore concerning
the laws of nature and the governance of the
universe, and they have a sense of helpless despair
as the "civilized ones" push them ever higher up
the mountains and confound the laws of the
Mother.
The Mother is the symbol of fertility. Her
laws regulate the reproductive cycle, and obe¬
dience to them guarantees its perpetuation for all
time. For the Kogua, true "knowledge" is
knowledge of the laws of Mother Nature as
reflected in traditions about the birth of the
universe, in myth, and in the lives and genealo¬
gies of the great heroes. Living at one with the
Mother is the key to the preservation of the
universe and the constant renewal of life in the
great, unending cosmic cycle.
The ancestral message
Seated on a mound in the Ciudad Perdida (the
"Lost City"), dressed in a white tunic and wear¬
ing a pointed hat, the high priest of the Kogua
contemplates the blue skies, lost in meditation.
Beside him lies a cloth bag filled with bananas,
avocados, corn cobs, pineapples, potatoes and
yams. He is on his way back to his humble home,
high in the Sierra Nevada de Santa Marta, and
has stopped for a while to meditate on the desti¬
ny of his people.
Long ago, the Kogua reigned as lords and
masters of the region stretching from the foothills
of the Sierra to the snow-clad peaks overlooking
the Caribbean Sea. Everything was theirsthe
sky, the sea, the snows, the mountains, the rivers
and the sacred cities. And they held sway over
the neighbouring peoples.
They had been masters of the universe ever
since time immemorial, when the Universal
Mother gave birth to them, for "She is the
Mother of all the races of men and of all the
tribes..."
The high priest, or Mama, of the Kogua is
responsible for watching over the universal order
as well as the spiritual and social order of the
tribe. He knows the cosmogony of his tribe (see
page 33) by heart and zealously preserves the
ancestral message handed down from generation
to generation. His knowledge of the laws of
nature, inherited from the forefathers, enables
him to understand the Law of the Mother. She
is the Mother of the lakes, the rivers, the trees
and of all things. She is the Mother of song and
dance, of the ancient brethren of stone, of fruit
and of all things. She is also the Mother of the
lesser brethren, or foreigners. She is the Mother
of musical instruments and of all temples, of the
sun and the Milky Way, of fire and of rain.
Like their ancestors, the Kogua believe that
they alone hold the secret, passed down from
father to son, that governs the way all things are
born, grow, reproduce and die, that causes the
rain to fall, the springtime to come and the sun
to rise in the morning. The Kogua are, indeed,
the guardians of the universe.
The high priest, with his sad face, his stony
stare and with all his knowledge of nature,
watches impotently over the destruction of the
universe. Like an elder brother, it is his duty to
ensure that the laws of Mother Nature are not
altered; yet what more can he do than recite the
ceremonial invocations and prayers in her tem¬
ples so close to heaven?
From time to time he may go down to the
plains, but only to implore the foreigners and the
authorities to let his people live in peace, not to
encroach any further on their lands, not to im¬
pose upon them the customs of the newcomers
and to stop the white intruders' impious destruc¬
tion of Mother Nature, who is the fount of all
things.
On 9 June 1987, worried about the violation
of their holy places, the Kogua priests gathered
in conclave in the Ciudad Perdida. As a result of
their deliberations a letter was sent to the govern¬
ment requesting protection for these sites. "These
great cities contain the true secrets of our tradi¬
tional wisdom and of our philosophical thought.
This is one of the reasons why the priests of the
Kogua have a duty to watch over their legitimate
possessions."
The Kogua stress, in particular, that Teyuna
(centre of power and symbol of fertility and of
the future) is a sacred place to which their priests
go to meditate. Placed in their safe-keeping, it is the
heritage bequeathed to them by the gods.

THE NINE
WORLDS
OF THE
KOGUA
A simplified, adapted version of the
cosmogonie myth transcribed in its
original form by Gerardo Reichet
Domatoffin The Kogua, Volume II,
published by Procultura, Bogotá, 1985.
In the beginning was the sea. All
was darkness. There was neither
sun nor moon, no people, plants
or animals. There was only the
sea; and the sea was everywhere.
The sea was the Mother (...); and
the Mother was neither person
nor thing, nor anything at all. She
was the spirit of that which was
to come; and she was thought and
she was memory.
Thus, the Mother already ex¬
isted, when, gradually, the lands,
the worlds took shape until they
became the world that we know
today. In this wise were fashioned
nine worlds. In the First World
was the Mother, the water and the
night. There was as yet no dawn.
This is why, at that time, the
Mother was called Se-ne-nuláng.
There was also a Father, who was
called Katakéne-ne-nuláng. They
had a son, whom they named
Bunkua-sé. Yet still there were no
people, no things, not anything at
all. They were Aluna,* that is,
they were spirit and thought.
Such was the First World.
The Second World had a
Father who was a tiger. In the
Third there emerged worms and
maggots. In the Fourth there
were two Mothers, Sáyaguaeye-
yumang and Disi-se-yuntaná, and
a Father, Sai-taná, who knew
what people would be like. In the
Fifth World appeared the Mother
Enkuâne-ne-nuiâng, who pon¬
dered on the human beings to be;
but these were humans without
ears, without eyes, without noses,
without hearing, yet they had a
form of speech, incessantly chant¬
ing in a mad refrain "sai-sai-sai"
(night, night, night).
The Mother, Bunkuáne-ne-
nuMng, and the Father, Sai-chaká,
of the Sixth World gave birth to
the first two Masters of the
World, the two Búnkua-sé, Blue
and Black. The world was divided
into two partsthe Blue and the
Blackand then, in each part,
there were nine Búnkua-sé. Those
to the left were all Blue and those
to the right were all Black.
Ahúnyika was the Mother of
the Seventh World in which
blood began to form in bodies and .
worms multiplied but still had no
bones or strength.
In the Eighth World the
Mother, Kenyajé, and the Father,
Abuinakatana, gave birth to the
thirty-six Fathers and Masters of
the world.
Finally, the Ninth World was
formed, in which there were nine
White Búnkua-sé. Then the
Fathers of the world encountered
a huge tree in the sky above the
sea; and above the sea they built
a great house of wood and liana
and they called it Aluna.
* For the Kogua, the concept of Alina in¬
cludes the notions of spirit, memory,
thought, volition, soul and intention. The
concrete, visible manifestation of things is
symbolic only and their true value and es¬
sence are embodied in Aluna. 33

'Give us the light of life and
of death'
34
Araditional cultures portray the origin of
the universe in strikingly similar ways. The spec¬
tacular dividing of the waters of the sky and of
the depths, of the firmament and of the ocean,
in Basque cosmogony thus parallels the creation
of land described in the first chapter of Genesis
as a place for the earth's creatures to live.
The traditional Basque New Year ceremony
of the presentation of water derives directly from
this world picture and from ritual practices
associated with the New Year ever since very ear¬
ly times. In Navarre, when the last stroke of mid¬
night chimes from the clock in the Urdiáin tower,
solemnly marking the end of the year, a band of
young people offers the local dignitaries a jar
brimming with water in order to wish them
success and happiness in the coming year. The
dignitaries must accept the gift, drink the water,
and offer in return a roll (opila), or, nowadays,
a traditional pastry.
The form of the greeting that accompanies
this ritual varies from one part of the Basque
country to another. The words that I learnt as
a child in Arruazu (Navarre) are: Ur goiena, ur
barrena! Urteberri egun onal Graziearekin osasuna,
pakearekin ontasuna: jainkuak dizuela egun onal
("Water on high, water below, New Year greet¬
ings! Grace and health, peace and prosperity: may
God give you greetings!")
Although such ancient myths have ceased to
be current, the rural Basques still observe certain
customs that can be traced back to them. For
example, the pagan prayer to the sun and the
moon (emaiquzu biziko ta hileko argia us
the light of life and of death") persists in Chris¬
tianized form in popular religious practice.
The symbolism of light plays a fundamental
role in traditional Basque funeral rites. When the
head of a rural household dies, the family beehive
is covered with a black sheet as a sign of mourn¬
ing. If it is not, the bees are believed to be in
danger of dying. This rite is accompanied by an
incantation which has a very practical objective:
"Give us more wax this year as the master of the
house is dead."
Like many other peoples who are the heirs
to an ancient civilization, the Basques attributed
a sacred character to atmospheric disturbances,
and some practices associated with worship of the
forces of nature still survive today. Many people
still believe that fossils are thunderbolts that have
fallen from the sky. The inhabitants of the valley
of Burunda in Navarre call them Jangoikoaren
harriak ("stones of God") and pick them up to
keep in their kitchens, where sometimes over a
dozen can be found, of all shapes and sizes. The
fossils are thought to protect the house from

lightning and, by extension, from evil action by
occult forces.
Metal implements such as axes, knives or
sickles are also believed to be effective lightning
conductors. I once saw an old woman who lived
alone in Valcarlos, in Navarre, brandishing a
sickle during a storm. To be on the safe side, she
had opened all her doors and windows, heedless
of the wind blowing through the house. She was
convinced that she was doing the right thing.
Other Pyrenean villagers adopt a more radical
solutionthey fire a rifle into the clouds to make
them disperse. If there is no man in the house,
the woman will shoot in the direction of the
storm from an upstairs window. I have seen nor¬
mally sensible men take down their rifles at such
times and fire them up the chimney.

Legends of the sun and moon
Every day the sun strolls across the firmament
and turns around his mother the earth, who
welcomes him to her bosom at nightfall. Legend
has it that man once lived in fear that one day
the sun would forget to wake up. He sent a sentry
accompanied by a cock to the ends of the earth
in order to disturb the sun's slumber should the
need arise. When he arrived at his destination,
the envoy discovered that the primitive people
living in that place usually banged the ground
with sticks or other instruments every morning
to make sure that the sun began his daily round
on time.
According to Basque tradition, everything
connected with the sun has an auspicious, sacred
character. The sun is said to rise on Midsummer's
Day (24 June) by leaping over the horizon and
in the evening he is besought to return: Iruzki
Saindia! Haugi bihar muga onez ("Holy Sun! Be
on time tomorrow morning").
The moon reigns over the night and the here¬
after and is sometimes less obliging and indeed
downright vindictive towards mortals.
It is said that a peasant returning home laden
with branches was once overtaken by nightfall.
Worn out and weighed down by his burden, he
grew impatient with the whims of the moon who
seemed to be playing hide-and-seek with the
clouds like a crazy she-goat, and shouted: "I'd like
to see you in this godforsaken hole with a load
on your back!" Nettled by his aggressive tone,
the moon seized the insolent fellow and carried
him off, and ever since then his silhouette can be
seen on the face of the moon.
This is why old women implore the moon
not to get angry.
Heaven's revenge
A Basque legend has it that the wagon of the
Great Bear is drawn by oxen. It is also said that
one day some robbers stole a team of oxen from
a peasant who lived on his farm with his wife and
two children. Discovering the theft the next day,
the farmer sent his son after the thieves. The son
followed the usual paths, but did not return.
Next, the farmer sent his daughter to look for
her brother, but she did not come back either.
Then the family dog went off in turn in search
of the children, leaving the house unguarded.
Finally the father, beside himself with anxi¬
ety, decided to set out in pursuit of his children.
After walking fruitlessly for a long time, over¬
come by weariness and sorrow, he began to curse
the fugitives, saying: "By Almighty God, wher¬
ever you may be, you can stay there!"
This terrible curse brought a punishment that
was even more terrible. Ever since, all those
involved have been condemned to wander one
after the other without ever being able to meet,
in the trail of the constellation which the Basques
call for this reason "the ox-thieves" (idi-ohoinak).
According to another legend, one year when
the month of March had been particularly harsh
for shepherds, a shepherd insulted March by
saying, "May you be gored to death!".
Sorely offended, March decided to take
revenge, but it was already noon on the 31st day
of the month. He therefore asked April to lend
him two and a half days during which he un¬
leashed a violent storm of snow and hail through¬
out the region. All the rivers and streams
overflowed, carrying away the flock of the
imprudent shepherd, who stood by helplessly.
Seeing that the ram had got caught on a branch,
the shepherd went to get it back, exclaiming, "By
your mother, I'll save you at least!". But the
panic-stricken animal struggled so violently that
with a sudden jerk of its head it gored out the
eye of the unfortunate shepherd who was already
one-eyed and now became completely blind. Such
was the vengeance wreaked by the baneful month
of March during those three "borrowed" days
(ordiz-egunak), which are understandably feared
by shepherds. 35

The birth and death
cOSMOLOGISTS today stand on the edge of
being able to answer the age-old question of the
philosopherswhere do we come from, and
where are we going? Even many non-scientists
are familiar with the term "Big Bang" to describe
the birth of the universe in a ball of fire some
15 billion years ago. But even some scientists are
not aware of new ideas in cosmology which link
this birth of the universe to its ultimate death,
in a self-contained description that owes much
to a marriage between the two great achievements
of twentieth-century physics, general relativity
and quantum theory. Researchers such as Jayant
Narlikar, in India, and Jim Hartle, in California,
as well as several Soviet experts, have been closely
involved in this work. But the man whose name
is most intimately linked with this breakthrough
is Stephen Hawking, of the University of Cam¬
bridge in England.
Hawking is well-known today as the author
of a best-selling book about the nature of time,*
and as the victim of a crippling disease that leaves
him confined to a wheelchair and able to com¬
municate only by laboriously spelling out words
and phrases using movements of one hand to
direct the output of a small computer. But long
before he achieved such popular fame Hawking
was recognized by his scientific peers as one of
the most original, and able, thinkers of his gener¬
ation. For twenty years, his studies have concen¬
trated on the puzzle of what happens to matter
at a singularitythe point of infinite density and
zero volume that lies, according to relativity the¬
ory, at the heart of a black hole, or at the begin¬
ning of the universe.
The universe itself is, in fact, described by the
same equations that describe a black hole. A black
hole is a region where there is such a concentra¬
tion of matter that the gravitational pull it
produces is so strong that not even light can
escape from its surface. Nothing from inside a
black hole can affect the outside world, although
objects from outside may fall in. Such a black hole
may be produced when a star rather more massive
than our own sun comes to the end of its life,
and shrinks inward. The equations of general rela¬
tivity show that any star that shrinks inside a
black hole must, indeed, collapse all the way to
a singularity.
Scientists are suspicious of singularities, and

of equations that contain infinities; they usually
regard any indication that they exist as a sign that
something is wrong with the equations. But
general relativity passes every other test with fly¬
ing colours; and since the singularities predicted
by the equations lie only in the hearts of black
holes, where they can never be seen, the idea was,
reluctantly, accepted. Hawking put the cat among
the pigeons by showing, just over twenty years
ago, that the same equations that require collaps¬
ing stars to form singularities also require that the
expanding universe was born from a singularity.
Reversing
the direction of time
We know that the universe is expanding because
distant galaxies are observed to be moving away
from us, with velocities proportional to their dis¬
tance. This does not mean that our Milky Way
Galaxy is at the centre of the universe, since such
a pattern of recession, with velocity proportional
to distance, is exactly what you would see from
any point within a uniformly expanding universe.
This discovery, dating back to the 1920s, is one
of the key ingredients in the concept of the Big
Bang, that the universe used to be in a superdense,
superhot state, from which it has been expand¬
ing for about 15 billion years.
Just by imagining the expansion reversed, it
is clear that long ago the galaxies were closer
together, and that even longer ago all the stars
in all the galaxies must have been merged in one
hot lump. But nobody seriously suggested that
the expansion could be "wound back" all the way
to a singularity, until Hawking proved that by
reversing the direction of time in the equations
which require collapsing stars to form singulari¬
ties you obtain equations which require that the
expanding universe started from a singularity.
Unlike the singularity in a black hole, the sin¬
gularity at the birth of the universe is, in a sense,
open to view. But since it is 15 billion years away
from us in time, physicists were still not too wor¬
ried about this flaw in their equations. Worse,
though, was to come.
Black holes
In the 1970s, Hawking turned his attention to the
behaviour of black holes themselves. He realized
that there is a profound connection between the
description of a black hole in terms of general
relativity and both thermodynamics and quantum

theory. In so doing, he linked the greatest de¬
velopments of twentieth-century physics with the
greatest achievement of nineteenth-century phys¬
ics. But at the cost of exposing the singularities
inside black holes to the outside world.
It works like this. There is a sharp "edge"
to a black hole, called an event horizon. Anything
inside the event horizon is trapped, and can never
escape. Anything outside can, if it has enough
speed, escape from the gravitational clutches of
the hole. The area of this surface around the black
hole, the area of the event horizon, represents its
size, and is, of course, related to how much mass
is inside.
Quantum theory comes into the story because
of a property known as uncertainty, which is at
the heart of the quantum world. In that world,
"uncertainty" has a very precise meaning. Quan¬
tum physics describes the behaviour of particles
like electrons, on scales smaller than atoms. At
this level, nothing is certain. A quantum particle,
for example, does not have both a precisely defined
position and a precisely defined momentum at the
38
same time. In everyday language, the particle
either knows where it is going or where it is now,
but not both at once. Unfortunately, there is no
space here to go into all the fascinating implica¬
tions of this.
A similar uncertainty applies, at the quantum
level, to energy. In a tiny volume of empty space,
where there ought to be nothing at all, a little
bubble of energy is allowed to pop up, out of the
vacuum, provided that it vanishes again within
a very short time, a time specified by the quan¬
tum equations. Such a short-lived energy bubble
is called a "vacuum fluctuation". Since Einstein
taught us that energy is equivalent to mass, this
uncertainty energy can even be turned into a pair
of particles, provided that they promptly vanish
again (it has to be at least a pair of particles, be¬
cause of other quantum rules, which I won't go
into here).
Bizarre though it may seem, this description
of the vacuum of space as a seething maelstrom
of particles popping into and out of existence
every tiny fraction of a second is a cornerstone
of modern physics. But what happens to such
"virtual" particles when they are created along¬
side a black hole?
Hawking's stroke of inspiration was to
imagine a virtual pair being produced right on
the edge of a black hole, a miniscule distance
above the event horizon. It is possible, just by
chance, for one particle in the pair to be moving
into the hole while the other moves outward. Just
as particles can only be created in pairs, so they
can only be destroyed in pairs. But in less time
than it takes for the pair to annihilate, one particle
has vanished forever into the black hole, and the
other has escaped. The uncertainty rules seem to
have been broken, since a particle appears to have
been created out of nothing at all. But Hawking
showed that the mass-energy needed to make the
particle has come from the gravity of the black
hole. As a result, the hole has actually lost mass
and shrunk by a tiny amount.
With this processHawking evaporation-
going on all over the event horizon, a black hole
must slowly shrink away, turning its mass into
a flood of elementary particles. Every black hole
has a characteristic temperature as a result (the
link with thermodynamics), and may eventually
shrink to the point where the event horizon dis¬
appears and the singularity inside is exposed to
view.
The 'edge' of the universe
Hard though it is for physicists to accept, as yet
they have found no way to avoid this possibility.
But having exposed the singularities inside black
holes, in recent years Hawking has done his best
to hide the singularity at the birth of the universe.
Just as quantum physics removes the bound¬
ary around a black hole, so, Hawking believes,
it may remove the singularity at the beginning
of the universe. A moment of creation, he says,
provides an "edge" to the universe, a boundary
in time. But:
"When quantum mechanics is taken into
account, there is the possibility that the singular¬
ity may be smeared out and that space and time
together may form a closed four-dimensional sur¬
face without a boundary or edge, like the surface
of the earth but with two extra dimensions. This
would mean that the universe was completely
self-contained and did not require any boundary
conditions. ..there would not be any singularities
at which the laws of physics would break down."
The quote is from Hawking's essay "The
Edge of Spacetime", in William Kaufmann's
book Universe (Freeman, New York, 1985). It
can be translated into everyday language quite
simply.
Hawking suggests that we think of the four
dimensions of the universe (three of space and one
of time) as being like the two dimensional sur¬
face of the earth. The surface of the earth is

"closed", in the sense that it has no edge which
you can fall offthat is, it is unbounded, although
finite in size. In order to make the analogy work,
you have to think of all three dimensions of space
as represented by a single line of latitude, a circle
around the earth from east to west and back to
its starting point. The direction of time is
represented by lines of longitude, running from
one pole to the other.
The North Pole represents "time zero", in
this picturethe birth of the universe in the Big
Bang. The "line of latitude" at the pole has zero
dimensions. As the universe expands away from
the Big Bang, imagine successive lines of latitude
drawn closer to the equator. As time passes (the
distance from the North Pole increases), the lines
are longerthat is, the universe expands. But
there is no "edge" in time at the North Pole, any
more than there is an "edge of the world" there.
It is just a place from which all time directions
happen to be "forward", just as on the surface
of the earth all spatial directions from the North
Pole are "south".
So far, so good. But what happens when we
reach the equator? Now, as we continue draw¬
ing successive lines of latitude they get smaller,
the "universe" shrinks, until it disappears at the
South Pole, in a mirror image of the Big Bang
in which it was born.
How could this happen in the real universe,
if we translate back from Hawking's picture? One
possibility being entertained seriously today is
that the entire universe may be no more, and no
less, than a vacuum fluctuation on the grand scale.
For most of us, imagining the creation, if only
for a fleeting instant, of a pair of particles out of
nothing at all is far from easy. But cosmologists,
to paraphrase Lewis Carroll, have no trouble
believing three impossible things before break¬
fast. It was an American physicist, Ed Tryon,
who pointed out that although the lifetime of a
virtual pair of particles is limited by the amount

of mass-energy they contain, it is possible for a
whole universe to be created, out of nothing at
all, with zero net energy. If so, there is no con¬
straint on its lifetime, since the quantum equa¬
tions are always in balance.
'A complete description of
where our universe comes from
and where it is going'
This neat trick rests upon the way energy is
stored in a gravitational field. This is always nega¬
tive, in the sense that the mass-energy of a particle
is always positive. So our 'universe might have
been born as a tiny bubble in spacetime, contain¬
ing the entire mass of the universe, but with this
mass-energy balanced by the gravitational energy
associated with that mass. The trick only works
if there is enough mass to ensure that the universe
itself is a kind of black hole, closed off by gravity
from anything outside. Af first, cosmologists
thought that such a new-born "universe" would
collapse rather suddenly, and disappear. More
recently, however, a theory which goes by the
appropriate name of inflation has been developed
and shows how such a tiny, superdense seed of
matter would be "blown up" to produce the
familiar Big Bang.
And so cosmologists have their complete
description of where our universe comes from,
and where it is going. We do, indeed, live inside
a gigantic black hole, containing the entire cos¬
mos. Born out of nothing at all, as a quantum
fluctuation of the vacuum, it has been expanding
for 15 billion years, but at an ever-decreasing rate.
Some time in the distant future (not for many
more tens of billions of years) the tug of gravity
will inevitably halt that expansion, and then put
it into reverse. For many more tens of billions
of years, this will have little effect on stars,
planets, and any life forms around to puzzle over
such matters. But eventually galaxies will merge
together, stars will collide and be squeezed into
an amorphous mass, and ultimately the universe
will be snuffed out of existence, gone like any
other fluctuation of the vacuum. The consolation,
for anyone distressed to learn of the ephemeral
nature of the universe, is that other universes
must also exist in the infinity of spacetime, some
before us, some after us, and some, in a sense,
alongside us. Sic transit gloria mundi.

IN BRIEF... IN BRIEF... IN BRIEF
A missing link
The almost complete head of a
Uranopithecus, a hominoid
which lived some 9 or 10 million
years ago, has been discovered
at Xirochori, near Thessalonica in
Greece. The only previously
known traces of this primate
were a number of teeth and
fragments of jawbone found at
a nearby site in 1973.
Uranopithecus may be a distant
ancestor of Australopithecus
afarensis, one of the earliest
hominids, whose fossil remains
dating back 5 or 6 million years
have been unearthed in East
Africa.
Joy or freedom?
Some historians believe that
when Friedrich von Schiller
wrote the famous "Hymn to
Joy", later set to music in
Beethoven's Ninth Symphony, he
actually used the word Freiheit
(freedom), not the word Freude
(joy). At performances of the
Ninth Symphony given in West
Berlin and East Berlin last
December, choirs directed by the
American conductor Leonard
Bernstein used the word
freedom. "I am sure Beethoven
would have approved," said
Bernstein.
Return of a goddess
The back of a statuette of the
Egyptian goddess Sekhmet,
bearing inscriptions dedicated to
Pharaoh Ramses II, has recently
been returned to Egypt. Stolen
some 20 years ago, it turned up
in June 1 988 in a Paris antique
shop, where it was on sale for
1,200,000 francs.
Treasures of Assyria
After 8 years of war, the Iraq
Museum in Baghdad has
reopened its doors to the public.
One of the world's great
museums, its holdings might
have been more extensive still if
some masterpieces of
Mesopotamian art had not been
dispersed. The winged bulls
from the palace of the Assyrian
king Sargon II are, for example,
in the British Museum in
London, and the Code of
Hammurabi, engraved for the
king of Babylon on a stele of
black diorite, is in the Louvre.
But important new finds have
been made recently. In April
1988 Iraqi archaeologists
restoring the sumptuous palace
built at Nimrud (near modern
Mosul) in the 9th century BC by
king Assurnasirpal II discovered 3
tombs containing priceless
Assyrian artefacts which are now
displayed in the Iraq Museum.
Women and alcohol
Women are more sensitive to
the effects of alcohol than men,
according to a study published
in the New England Journal of
Medicine. The study shows
women reach the same state of
intoxication after consuming
roughly one-third less alcohol.
As a result, women more readily
develop liver disease after
drinking smaller amounts of
alcohol than men, whose
resistance is thought to be due
to higher levels of a protective
enzyme in the stomach which
breaks down alcohol before it
enters the bloodstream.
Blowing hot and cold
Researchers at the
Massachusetts Institute of
Technology (MIT) and Britain's
Meteorological Office have
called into question the widely
accepted belief that the average
temperature of the planet has
increased by between 0.5°C and
0.7°C since the turn of the
century. By analysing air and
water temperatures taken at sea
during the last century and
recorded in ships' logbooks, they
have produced data suggesting
that the earth has warmed by
just 0.2°C. In view of the
margin of error for such
measurements it is even possible
that there has been no warming
at all. Supporters of the global
warming thesis contest the
precision of the temperatures
recorded by 19th-century sailors
and still maintain the importance
of the greenhouse effect caused
by the emission of carbon
dioxide and other gases.
Biodegradable plastics
Ordinary plastic takes 2 or 3
centuries to decompose, and
efforts are being made to
develop a biodegradable plastic.
A Belgian company is
manufacturing a plastic bag
made of polyethylene, an
oxydizing agent, a catalyst and
6% cornstarch. When buried,
the starch macromolecules are
destroyed by micro-organisms in
the soil. At the same time, the
oxydizing agent reacts with
metallic salts in the soil to form
peroxides which attack the
polymer chains and eventually
decompose the plastic into
carbon and water within 2 or 3
years. The manufacturers of the
bags have announced that they
will soon be marketing
biodegradable plastics containing
50% cornstarch.
Adopt your own whale
The Massachusetts-based
International Wildlife Coalition
(IWC) is proposing to adopt 66
humpback whales from among
the 400 which spend the
summer offshore. In 4 years it
has sold more than 100,000
"adoption certificates" for $15
each. Each sponsor receives a
photo of his or her "own"
whale, recognizable by variations
in the distinctive white and grey
markings on the tail and by
different scars. The idea seems
to be spreading. The state of
Texas recently launched the idea
of having its beaches
"adopted", and now some
30,000 people regularly spend
their weekends picking up
detritus from "their" stretch of
beach.
High-risk profession
Fifty-eight journalists were killed
in the exercise of their
profession in 1989, more than
two-thirds of them in Latin
America, according to the
French non-governmental
organization "Reporters sans
Frontières". The figures for 1987
and 1988 were 32 and 45
respectively. In its annual report
for 1989 "Reporters sans
Frontières" also records 241
arrests of journalists and 87
expulsions.
AIDS spreading
At the beginning of 1990 there
were some 600,000 people
worldwide with acquired
immunodeficiency syndrome
(AIDS), according to World
Health Organization (WHO)
estimates. It is thought that the
figure could rise to 6 million by
the year 2000 since (again
according to WHO estimates)
some 5 million people are now
infected with human
immunodeficiency virus (HIV),
the virus which causes AIDS.
Speaking at Unesco HQ on 26
February, Dr. Jonathan Mann,
then director of WHO's Global
Programme on AIDS, stressed
that "All-out mobilization of the
world community through
education" is necessary to stem
the spread of the disease.
From Celsius to Kelvin
As a result of major
developments in low-
temperature physics the Kelvin
temperature scale is becoming
more widely used. The Celsius or
Centigrade scale makes it
possible to measure
temperatures using two fixed
points, 0°C and 100°C,
corresponding to the freezing
and boiling points of water at
normal atmospheric pressure. In
the Kelvin scale, the fixed point
is the triple point of pure water,
that is the temperature at which
the liquid, solid and gaseous
forms of water can be
maintained simultaneously. This
point, assigned the value of
273.16 K, is equal to zero on
the Celsius scale. In 1968, an
international conference adopted
an International Practical
Temperature Scale, and in
1990 a new scale will be
promulgated to take account
of progress in thermic
metrology. The measuring
points will have a precision of
the order of a millionth of a
degree.
Supercomputers
Japanese researchers are
reported to have made the first
"Josephson computer". Using
parts made from
superconductors, it should be
faster and consume less energy
than the present generation of
computers which use silicon
chips. The Josephson effect
takes its name from the British
physicist Brian Josephson who in
1 962 discovered that two
superconductors separated by a
narrow insulating gap
exchanged particles and a direct
current passed from one to the
other with extraordinary
electromagnetic properties.

THE SACRED TREES OF MADAGASCAR
BY VOAHANGY RAJAONAH
42
Ihe people of Madagascar believe
that a place without trees is a place
of infertility and death. A source of
food and wealth, trees are also
inhabited by invisible forces with
which human beings must come to
terms.
The amontana and the aviavy,
which are related to the sycamore
and the fig-tree, are royal trees. They
symbolize the life-force and epitomize
power. Their flowers blossom and
bear fruit before their leaves, which
appear only when the fruit is ripe, as
though to protect it from the sun.
According to the elda^Jto reveal
one's fruit and then conceal it
beneath graceful foliage is the pre¬
eminent sign of royalty, which openly
proclaims its designs for the good of
the people, but then conceals them
modestly because they are sacred.
The king's tree
King Andriamanelo is thought to
have been the first to plant these
trees in his realm of Alasora, one of
the twelve sacred hills of the Merina
people. He made them a symbol of
royalty and would not allow them to
be planted anywhere but in the resi¬
dences of kings or their representa¬
tives. He liked to say that the fruit of
the aviavy left a bitter taste on the
tongue, which then turned sweet.
"May my kingdom," he said, "have
this sweet aftertaste."
In Betsileo country, in the centre
of Madagascar, when a king was en¬
throned an aviavy tree was planted
to the east of his house, and when
he died, his funeral ceremony took
place beneath it. The royal family
would then plant seedlings belonging
to the same variety or produced
by the original tree in order to per¬
petuate the memory of the dead king
and symbolize his survival through his
succession.
The hasina, or "dragon tree",
has an important position in the
mythology of northern Madagascar,
on the east coast and in the high¬
lands. The very name of this tree is
synonymous with spirituality and
especially with saintliness. It is con¬
nected with the cult practised by the
earliest inhabitants of the island, the
Vazimba, who are feared and conse¬
quently venerated by the population.
Hasinas grow in the areas where the
Vazimba used to live, or near their
tombs, and the local people would
not uproot or desecrate them for any¬
thing in the world.
Unlike the amontana or the
aviavy, the hasina grows near the
dwellings of kings and ordinary folk
alike. It legitimizes the authority of
the head of the household or of the
village who plants it to the north-east
of his dwelling, in the sacred plot
reserved for the ancestors. As a
general rule, the north is considered
to be a noble and auspicious direc¬
tion; it is linked to water, which sym¬
bolizes purity, life and prosperity.
On the north-east coast, among
the Betsimisaraka people, the man-
drorofo represents the permanence
of life by virtue of its longevity, which
is comparable to that of the oak or
the sequoia. According to legend the
mandrorofo, traditionally planted at
the entrance to villages, is the
primeval tree brought by the ances¬
tors from distant Indonesia and is
thus the repository of the past. Since

it came with the ancestors, surely it
must be considered an ancestor it¬
self? And since it still survives, it also
casts its shadow into the future.
The bamboo, also considered a
tree, represents the family. The young
shoots that grow at its foot all year
long stand for posterity, a paramount
concern of the Malagasy people, who
attach the highest importance to the
perpetuation of their name and of
their line. As an evergreen, the bam¬
boo symbolizes eternal youth, the
dream of all human beings. Its
slender stem thrusting up towards
the sky is the very image of beauty.
Because they are sacred, trees
also possess protective qualities. In
stock-raising areas, where a man's
wealth is measured by the size of his
herd, the zebu pen is placed beneath
the protection of a tree, usually a
hasina, which is always planted in the
north-east. This practice is supposed
to protect the herd against disease
and theft. A would-be thief who
enters the enclosure will not be able
to get the animals out and will him¬
self remain a prisoner. The mere
presence of the tree is enough to dis¬
suade him from going in.
A tropical country, Madagascar
is subject to spectacular storms which
often cause fires. Formerly, when
stone was used only for tombs, dwell¬
ings made of plant fibres would burst
into flame at the slightest spark. As
a protective measure, a lendemy tree
(literally, "which makes mild") would
be planted within the village precincts
to keep away lightning.
Trees are also the refuge of
spirits. In the south of Madagascar
the kily (a tamarind tree) and the bao¬
bab are reputed to be inhabited by
what the ¡slanders call "things", in¬
definable spirits that are widely vener¬
ated because they are reputed to be
evil.
These spirits may be released by
the trees that hold them captive,
especially at nightfall when it is inad¬
visable to go near them. If there is no
alternative, the best ploy is to put a
blade of grass at the foot of the tree
or tie together three blades of the
grass growing beside it.
Trees that harbour spirits can be
recognized by the bottles of toaka (a
local alcohol) placed beneath them
and by the strips of cloth hanging
from their branches or wound
around their trunk.
Other trees are venerated be¬
cause they have been witness to an
exceptional event which has left its
mark on the popular imagination. In
Tanosy country in the south-east of
Madagascar, a kily is held to be
sacred if there has been a spectacular
case of healing or an apparition in its
vicinity, if an important person has
rested in its shade, or, in more recent
times, if ¡t has caused the death of
the passengers of a car that has
crashed into it. Funeral processions
stop beneath the kily just long
enough to prepare and eat a meal:
the tree is thus regarded as the last
earthly resting-place of the dead
person, united with the community.
The kily and the baobab produce
edible fruit. The fruit of the baobab
in particular is an important source
of food in southern and south¬
western Madagascar. However, even
in periods of scarcity, it is strictly for¬
bidden to pick and eat fruit from
sacred trees. Anyone who defies this
rule will suffer misfortune or even
death. The same punishment awaits
those who dare to defile or fell sacred
trees or lop their branches
It is hard not to draw a parallel
with the Garden of Eden and the
archetypal ¡mage of the Tree of Life,
which man can never know because
he tasted the forbidden fruit.

E,LECTRiciTY ¡s the power source
that drives the modem world. It pro¬
vides heat and light, it powers
machines and appliances and makes
global communications possible. In
the same way that friction limits the
efficiency of mechanical machines,
resistance to the flow of electrons
through the conducting material is
the limiting factor in any electrical
device.
In 1911, however, a type of
material was discovered which has no
electrical resistance. Known as super¬
conductors, such materials are effec¬
tively "frictionless" conductors if
you start an electric current moving
in a loop of superconductor it will
literally go on moving forever. They
are the electrical equivalent of a per¬
petual motion machine.
The one big drawback of the ear¬
ly superconductors was that they only
functioned at very low temperatures,
within a few degrees of absolute
zero, -273° Celsius, which is known
as 0 Kelvin or 0 K. Until a few years
ago, the highest recorded tempera¬
ture at which a superconductor
would work was 23 K. This meant
that liquid helium, an expensive liquid
to produce and store, had to be used
as a coolant.
This has not prevented supercon¬
ductors from being used. Magnets
can be made from coils of supercon¬
ducting wire which produce intense
magnetic fields. These have been put

can reach speeds of 500 kilometres
an hour floating just centimetres
above the track. Japan has a work¬
ing prototype of just such a train.
Electronic devices made from super¬
conducting materials can be used as
extremely sensitive sensors or as com¬
ponents in super fast computers.
New superconducting
ceramics
In April 1986, however, everything
changed. Two researchers who
worked for IBM in Zurich, Georg
Bednorz and Alex Müller, stumbled
upon a ceramic made from the ele¬
ments lanthanum, copper, barium
and oxygen which became supercon¬
ducting at 35 K. Scientists in the
United States soon discovered similar
ceramics which worked at tempera¬
tures up to 98 K. This was very
significant since these new supercon¬
ducting ceramics could be cooled
with liquid nitrogen, which is much
cheaper than helium and a much
easier liquid to handle.
Suddenly the scientific world was
in turmoil and scientists all over the
world were racing to see who could
find the ceramic that showed super¬
conducting qualities at the highest
temperature. At a hastily convened
meeting of the American Physical
Society early in 1987, thousands of
physicists crammed into a ballroom in
New York's Hilton hotel and fiercely
debated the new discoveries until 6
a.m. The press quickly latched on and
hailed the meeting as the "Wood¬
stock for physicists". Magazines were
full of photographs of little blocks of
the new ceramics levitating over mag¬
nets. This phenomenon is an exam¬
ple of the Meissner effect, in which
a superconductor repels any magnet¬
ic field from penetrating its surface,
causing it to float above a magnet.
The potential of these new
materials was quickly seen and indus¬
trial companies as well as academic
researchers joined in the race.
Governments poured money into
research, not wanting other countries
to get a lead in exploiting the new
phenomenon. Reports flooded in of
higher and higher temperatures,
some even approaching room tem¬
perature, around 295 K. If this were
achieved it would literally transform
electrical technology. People spoke
optimistically of a world of super-
efficient machines, effortlessly fast
levitating trains and new high-speed
computers.
Many of the early reports were,
however, overly optimistic. Most of
the new ceramics which showed
superconducting behaviour at tem¬
peratures higher than 100 K were
unstable, and soon lost their super¬
conducting qualities, or were not
showing true superconductivity. To
date the highest confirmed temper¬
ature for a superconducting ceramic
is 125 K.
How the new superconductors
actually work is still confounding the
theorists. Electrical conduction occurs
when electrons free themselves from
their atoms and can move about in

Resistance is created by the electrons
bumping into atoms in their path as
they move through the conductor.
The theory which explains traditional
low-temperature superconductors
predicts that electrons can avoid any
collisions by moving through the con¬
ductor on a vibration in the lattice just
as a surfer rides a wave on the ocean.
But in order to do this the electrons
have to move around in pairs, one
electron following the other like a
slipstreaming racing car.
The theory also predicts that
superconductivity cannot occur
above 35 K, so theorists have had to
start from scratch to explain the new
materials. There is no definitive theory
yet, but one strong contender
predicts that conduction occurs not
through the movement of electrons
but the movement of electron vacan¬
cies, or "holes", which jump from
atom to atom in the conductor.
Practical applications
The hype that surrounded the discov¬
ery of these new materials neglected
to mention the many problems that
must be overcome before useful ap¬
plications can be achieved. Supercon¬
ducting ceramics are produced as a
powder which can be compressed
into a rather brittle solid substance.
This brittleness makes it very difficult
to produce useful shapes such as
wires. Some success has been
achieved by using techniques taken
from the microelectronics industry.
The ceramics can be laid down as a
thin layer on top of another material
by gently spraying the constituent
parts of the ceramic at the underly¬
ing base. As they land, the molecules
arrange themselves into the crystal
structure of the ceramic.
Any useful application must
make use of one of the three special
properties of superconducting
materials. The first of these is the fact
that they will conduct electricity with
no resistance. The most obvious ap¬
plication would be in the transmission
of power from power stations to elec¬
tricity users. At the moment 1 0 to 20
per cent of all power produced is lost
during transmission, and so signifi¬
cant savings could be made. An effi¬
cient method of drawing the
ceramics into wires must be found
before these savings can be achieved.
Also, the new materials cannot carry
a large amount of current without
losing their superconducting quali¬
ties. The best they can manage at the
moment is one thousandth of the
current needed.
The second special property of
superconductors is their ability to
generate very strong magnetic fields.
Low-temperature superconductors
can generate fields 200,000 times
stronger than the earth's magnetic
field. Any electrical conductor can
generate a field. If formed into a
loop, a current round the loop will
generate a magnetic field through its
centre. It is a superconductor's ability
to conduct current effortlessly around
the loop which leads to such strong
fields.
Medical scanners and levitating
trains could both be made more sim¬
ply and cheaply using new high-
temperature superconducting mag¬
nets. So too could the Supercon¬
ducting Supercollider, a particle ac¬
celerator which the US government
plans to build in an 88-kilometre tun¬
nel under the state of Texas to study
the elementary particles of matter.
Accelerators use powerful magnets
to bend beams of particles into a cir¬
cular path so that they collide and the
fragments of their collisions can be
analysed.
The Meissner effect, described
above, prevents a magnetic field from
penetrating into a superconductor.
However, strong fields can break
through this repulsion, and if they do
this they destroy the superconduct¬
ing properties of the material. The
new superconducting ceramics have
so far proved susceptible to the ef¬
fects of strong fields, so their useful¬
ness for this sort of application may
be limited.
The Josephson junction
The third property of superconduct¬
ing materials is the one that looks the
most promising for the new ceramics.
If two superconductors are brought
very close together but not allowed
to touch, electrons can jump across
and current can flow as if the two
conductors were touching. The cur¬
rent across the gap is, however, very
sensitive to external electric and mag¬
netic fields, so this so-called Joseph-
son junction can be used as a very
accurate sensor of electric and mag¬
netic fields or as an electronic switch
like a transistor.
Devices based on Josephson
junctions can be used by biophysicists
to study the minute electrical fields
created by activity in the brain. On
board satellites they can be used in
detectors to look at the stars and
planets or down at the earth's sur¬
face. Computer chips based on
Josephson junctions, with intercon¬
necting wires also of superconduct¬
ing material, would be much faster
than conventional machines. The
technology for manufacturing these
tiny devices from the brittle ceramics
already exists, but many reliability
problems remain to be solved. It is in
these high-technology fields of sen¬
sors and electronics that we are most
likely to see the new superconductors
in use.
The likelihood of superconduc¬
tors that operate at room tempera¬
ture now seems remote, unless there
is another dramatic breakthrough or
a theory of superconductors which
can point the way to use at higher
temperatures. Very exciting possibil¬
ities for superconducting ceramics lie
ahead, but perhaps not those which
people originally imagined.

On 10 December 1948, the General Assembly of the United Nations adopted the Universal
Declaration of Human Rights. The Assembly called upon all member states to publicize the text
of the Declaration and "to cause it to be disseminated, displayed, read and expounded principally
in schools and other educational institutions".
In order to make the Declaration accessible to children, the World Association for the School
as an Instrument of Peace (EIP), an international non-governmental organization founded in 1967,
asked teachers and students of the faculty of psychology and educational sciences at the
University of Geneva (Switzerland) to simplify the language. Some extracts are published below.
TEACHING HUMAN RIGHTS AT SCHOOL
Original version (in light type)
Simplified version (in bold type)
ARTICLE 1
All human beings are bom free and equal
in dignity and rights. They are endowed
with reason and conscience and should
act towards one another in a spirit of
brotherhood.
When children are born, they are free
and should always be treated in the
same way.

ARTICLE 2
Everyone is entitled to all the rights and
freedoms set forth in this Declaration,
without distinction of any kind, such as
race, colour, sex, language, religion, polit¬
ical or other opinion, national or social
origin, property, birth or other status.
Furthermore, no distinction shall be
made on the basis of the political, jurisdic¬
tional or international status of the country
or territory to which a person belongs,
whether it be independent, trust, non-self-
governing or under any other limitation of
sovereignty.
...everyone has the right to possess or
to take advantage of all that has just
been said:
even if they do not speak your
language
even if they do not have the same
colour skin as you
even if they do not think like you
even if they do not have the same
religion as you
even if they are poorer or richer
than you
even if they are not from the same
country as you.
NICOLAS (age S)
ARTICLE 7
All are equal before the law and are enti¬
tled without any discrimination to equal
protection of the law. All are entitled to
equal protection against any discrimination
in violation of this Declaration and against
any incitement to such discrimination.
The law is the same for everyone: it
should be applied in the same way
for all.
ARTICLE 3
Everyone has the right to life, liberty and
security of person.
You have the right to live, to live in
freedom and in safety.

ARTICLE 26
1) Everyone has the right to education.
Education shall be free, at least in the
elementary and fundamental stages.
Elementary education shall be compulsory.
Technical and professional education shall
be made generally available and higher
education shall be equally accessible to all
on the basis of merit.
2) Education shall be directed to the full
development of the human personality
and to the strengthening of respect for
human rights and fundamental freedoms.
It shall promote understanding, tolerance
and friendship among all nations, racial
or religious groups, and shall further the
activities of the United Nations for the
maintenance of peace.
3) Parents have a prior right to choose the
kind of education that shall be given to
their children.
You have the right:
to go to school
to take advantage of compulsory
education without having to pay
anything
to learn a profession or continue
your studies as far as you wish.
At school, you should be able to
develop all your talents and you
should be taught to get on with
others, whatever their religion or the
country they come from.
Your parents have the right to
choose how you will be taught, and
what you will be taught at school.
48 MARTA (age 4)
ARTICLE 27
1) Everyone has ¡me right freely to partici¬
pate in the cultural life of the community,
to enjoy the arts and to share in scientific
advancement and its benefits.
2) Everyone has the right to the protection
of the moral and material interests result¬
ing from any scientific, literary or artistic
production of which he is the author.
Whether you are an artist, a writer or
a scientist, you should be free to share
the work with others and to profit
from what you have done together.
Your works should be protected
and you should be able to benefit
from them.
ARTICLE 29
1) Everyone has duties to the community
in which alone the free and full develop¬
ment of his personality is possible.
2) In the exercise of his rights and free¬
doms, everyone shall be subject only to
such limitations as are determined by law
solely for the purpose of securing due
recognition and respect for the rights and
freedoms of others and of meeting the just
requirements of morality, public order and
the general welfare in a democratic
society.
...you have duties towards the people
you live amongst, who also allow you
to develop your personality.
The law does not take anything
away from human freedoms and
rights, but it allows everyone to
respect others and to be respected.
#THE SCHOOL
AS AN INSTRUMENT
OF PEACE'
The World Association for the School as
an Instrument of Peace (EIP) is an inter¬
national non-governmental organization
with consultative status at the United
Nations, Unesco and the Council of
Europe. The organization's aim ¡s to
"disarm the mind
to disarm the hand".
EIP activities in schools around the world
reflect a common objective, that of unify¬
ing people while respecting their differ¬
ences. To this end, EIP has drawn up a
code known as the "universal principles of
civic education", the teaching of which is
promoted along with that of the Universal
Declaration of Human Rights. These prin¬
ciples are as follows:
School is in the service of humanity.
School paves the way to mutual
understanding for all the children of the
world.
School teaches respect for life and for
mankind.
School teaches tolerance, that quality
which helps us to accept attitudes and
behaviour that are different to our own.
School develops a sense of responsi¬
bility. The more our condition improves,
the greater the responsibility we must
assume.
School teaches children to overcome
their selfishness. It helps them understand
that human progress can only come
about through individual efforts and
worldwide co-operation.
In 1984, EIP set up the International
Human Rights and Peace Teacher Training
Center in Geneva. This documentation
and research centre, the first of its kind,
is open to teachers of any subject,
whether from primary, secondary or fur¬
ther education, to representatives of
ministries of education and international
organizations, and to any other person or
institution concerned with the teaching
of human rights and peace.
EIP was awarded an honourable
mention in the 1 98 1 Unesco Prize for the
Teaching of Human Rights, and received
the United Nations Peace Messenger Prize
in 1988.

M
Ihe European Academy of Arts,
Sciences and Humanities, founded in
1 979, brings together eminent artists,
scientists and writers who wish to
contribute to the analysis of major
world problems.
The Academy is a three-tiered
institution. It has some 200 titular
members, forty of whom are Nobel
prizewinners, from fifty-five national
academies spread over five conti¬
nents. A similar number of cor¬
responding members are chosen
from among young people who are
making an outstanding creative con¬
tribution to the arts and the sciences.
The Academy is served by several
committees, notably a committee of
honour whose members include
heads of state, government ministers,
ambassadors and representatives of
several intergovernmental organi¬
zations.
Ever since it was founded, the
Academy has collaborated with
Unesco. Initially it was agreed that an
international symposium should be
organized annually in a European
capital under the auspices of one or
several national academies. The first
symposium, on relations between the
sciences, the arts and philosophy,
was held in 1980 at Unesco Head¬
quarters in Paris. Subsequent meet¬
ings were held in Brussels, Lisbon,
Stockholm, Uppsala, Bucharest, Paris,
Rome, Sofia and Geneva.
Two particularly important meet¬
ings were a symposium on "The
European Cultural and Scientific
Community and its Role in North-
South Dialogue", held at Unesco in
its fortieth anniversary year (1985),
and a workshop on the theme of
"Science, Culture and World Health"
jointly organized by the World Health
Organization, Unesco, and the Euro¬
pean Academy, held at Geneva in
1 989 on the tenth anniversary of the
founding of the Academy. An instru¬
ment of co-operation between the
three organizations is being drawn up
with a view to adopting a joint plan
"Cellular Machinery",
a painting by the French artist Nicole d'Agaggio
inspired by phenomena from the world of molecular biology.
THE EUROPEAN
ACADEMY OF ARTS,
SCIENCES AND
HUMANITIES
BY RAYMOND DAUDEL
International co-operation is founded on a network of daily
contacts, exchanges and initiatives which create bonds of
solidarity between men and women all over the world. In
addition to the intergovernmental agencies of the United
Nations system, hundreds of non-governmental organizations
(NGOs) today form part of this network. These organizations
exist thanks to the dedication of people with similar professional
interests or common aims who wish to share their experience
and combine their efforts. "Forum", a new feature launched this
month, gives them an opportunity to talk about their activities.
of action to strengthen the role of
universities in the promotion of
health.
Under the aegis of Unesco and
the European Federation on AIDS
Research, nine laboratories in Europe
and North America are engaged in
joint research on an AIDS vaccine, on
improved treatment for those suffer¬
ing from AIDS, and on the origins of
the disease. This "Man against
Viruses" group is chaired by Professor
Luc Montagnier of the Pasteur Insti¬
tute in Paris, whose team was respon¬
sible for identifying two of the AIDS
viruses.
Together with Unesco, the
French Ministry of Research and Tech¬
nology and the Descartes Associa¬
tion, the Academy is currently
preparing a workshop to study links
between biological diversity and cul¬
tural diversity. Questions examined at
the workshop will include the role of
natural and artificial reserves, and the
need to create gene banks for the
preservation of certain varieties of
maize, coffee and Sahelian plants.
In association with the Hungari¬
an Academy of Sciences, a seminar
is being prepared for 1991 to foster
the promotion of ethical, humanist
and cultural values in education.
In 1992, to mark the five hun¬
dredth anniversary of the "Encounter
between Two Worlds", America and
Europe, the Academy and Unesco
intend to organize a major workshop
in Madrid on the importance of dia¬
logue between cultures, a process
which is often threatened by the
rising tide of intoleranceethnic,
nationalist, ideological or religious.
RAYMOND DAUDEL,
French scientist, is president of the
European Academy of Arts, Sciences
and Humanities and of the
International Academy of Quantum
Molecular Sciences. He is editor of the
International Journal of Quantum
Chemistry, and the author of a
number of scientific works including
Quantum Theory of Chemical
Reactivity (1973) and (with others)
Quantum Chemistry (1984). 49

Letters to the Editor

Teaching aids
I teach Spanish and philosophy and
am also responsible for giving careers
advice to teenagers. Unesco publica¬
tions have been an enormous help in
my work. I particularly like the Courier
because of the richness and variety
of its contents. My colleagues in the
history and geography departments
join me in expressing our thanks.
Flor Parra Vera

The ecological front line
I should like to think that the thaw
which is taking place in the world
today will melt the ice of ignorance
towards ecological problems, which
are so serious that humanity could
perish without a single weapon being
fired. I am glad that the Unesco
Courier is helping to stimulate the
growing world interest in these
problems.
Tatiana Diomina (USSR)
1789: An idea that changed
the world
Bravo for your outstanding issue on
the bicentenary of the French Revo¬
lution. The great idea of 1 789, which
inspired the Universal Declaration of
Human Rights in 1948, has again
come to the fore. In Eastern Europe,
this idea really has "changed the
world". Thanks to it the Romanian
people have overthrown tyranny and
regained their freedom.
Professor Nicolae Liu
University of Bucharest (Romania)
The Courier
and television
What a pity that Unesco doesn't
sponsor a quality television pro¬
gramme presenting the themes cov¬
ered in the Courier. There would be
no need for advertisements. What a
contribution such a programme could
make to our knowledge of the world1
Pascal Gladoux

The League
of Nations ideal
Your December 1989 issue, High
Days and Holidays, was a great disap¬
pointment I know that the Courier
is not intended to compete with Time
magazine, but now that the East
European countries are raising our
hopes of a return to the ¡deal pursued
by the League of Nations in the days
of Briand and Stresemann, why don't
you inform the present generation
about the history of the League of
Nations and the reasons why it failed?

An Egyptian treasure
Would it be possible to publish an
article on the discovery in Egypt last
year of a fantastic treasure-trove of
necklaces, bracelets and other pre¬
cious artefacts? Another interesting
subject which the Courier might con¬
sider is "design", a profession which
brings together art and technology
Laure Mestas-Débrosse
St. Cyr-l'Ecole
(France)
Universal images
It was a good idea to change the
format of the magazine, which has
gained correspondingly in succinct¬
ness, clarity and elegance. The design
and presentation are greatly impro¬
ved Images, like music, form a uni¬
versal language. In this sense it can
be said that the Courier has become
even more "universal" than it was.
I don't mean that the magazine
is better or worse than before, simply
that it is more accessible and thus
does more to foster mutual compre¬
hension between people of different
cultures.
The Courier is also continuing to
follow its guiding principle of presen¬
ting themes impartially and giving
space to as many points of view as
possible. This is the reason why the
magazine is as lively as ever.
Here are some themes which
I should like to see in the Courier:
anarchism, feminism, the history
of music; twentieth-century archi¬
tecture.
Aurora Gómez-Tejedor
Getxo (Spain)
We shall take your suggestions into
account when planning future issues.
Editor
An easier read
Your new formula is a success, and
the articles are easier to read and
understand than before. Keep up the
good work of bringing peoples closer
together.
Robert Laurent
Arbouans (France)
Loss of identity
I don't think the magazine has been
improved by the new conception and
presentation In fact it has lost its
identity. You should have made gra¬
dual improvements instead of chan¬
ging it completely so that it resembles
so many other magazines
