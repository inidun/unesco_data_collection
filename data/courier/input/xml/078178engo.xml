BECOMING
AN EDUCATED
IN OUR
MODERN WORLD
by Margaret Mead
IT IS NO LONGER the underprivileged, the
Illiterate or the villagers to whom a new road
gives access to urban life, who as adults learn
crumbs fallen from the tables of those who as
children feasted on the slowly accumulated
knowledge of the past. Now it is the elite among
the adults of the educationally elite countries who
"go back to school"even this old phrase is out
of datewith fellowships, exchange visits and
small international conferences which accomplish
in a week more than a year of reading could do.

The Unesco Courler. Jonuary 1961
Perhaps no field of education has undergone such
profound changes in theory and practice as the
field once called "adult education," later expand¬
ed to Include "fundamental education," and
now, in those countries which originally sup¬
plied the models, more often referred to as "continuing
education." We may identify briefly the underlying ideas
behind these recognizable stages.
The early effort in adult education took its impetus
from the needs of the underprivileged within modern
industrialized society, the needs of workers, women, sup¬
pressed minorities, of those who had failed to receive
"enough" or "their fair share" of that transmissible block
of traditional knowledge and. skills called "a good edu¬
cation". Programmes designed to make good this deficit
were motivated by a growing demand from the" under-
educated and a growing sense of responsibility on the
part of the educated.
The consciousness of educational inferiority or deficit
ran through everything that was done; the snobbery
which identified a higher class level with a higher degree
of familiarity with "the Glassies", "great Ideas" and so
forth pervades the topics chosen for adult education
Implicitly it was assumed that the gap between those
who had read Latin and Greek in the original, and those
who had read nothing beyond an elementary school level,
could somehow be bridged by reading Latin and Greek
works in translation.
This attempt to make superficially equal the education¬
ally unequal still pervades certain aid-fashioned types of
workers' education in English-speaking countries. It has
also had a considerable effect on the kind of low-level
"higher education" given in those countries where secon¬
dary school education is becoming the ideal for all nor¬
mal children. Hastily assembled, superficial versions of
what was once taught to the few, as children, and later
taught, condescendingly, to the less educated as adults, is
now taught to late adolescents.
A second stage which later came to be summarized
under the term "fundamental education" grew out of pro¬
grammes for peasant immigrants in countries like the
United States, and for peasants who were to be rapidly
upgraded into active members of their own modernizing
societies in countries like the Soviet Union. Coupled with
this was a growing emphasis on .the application of modem
science to the promotion of health, on new forms of medi¬
cal care, public health, community organization, agricul¬
tural practices, and other new techniques.
Adult education became a device for feeding modern
health, technological and organizational practices to com¬
munities of adults who were thus being brought up to
date, or into line, with more favoured, more urban, or
more educated portions of society.
T
iteracy became very strictly a means towards
H j the conversion of the backward citizen, subject,
.^x%xmtm colonial or trust territory member, into a receiver
and executor of certain necessary techniques: vaccination,
immunization, baby-care clinics, food supplements, arti¬
ficial fertilizers, and the like. Where the older form of
"adult education" was grounded in a sense of "educational
deprivation" to be made up by acquiring access to higher
things, this new form of practical welfare education was
grounded in what was seen as either a need already pres¬
ent or one to be stimulated until it became a felt need.
As in the earlier form, the sense of urgency rested with
the superior group who were outraged at the low levels
of literacy, nutrition, and medical care found in the vil¬
lages. Considering how much work was required to find
community leaders able finally to awaken community
participation, the rationale of the whole process seems
more than a little suspect.
A tremendous amount of waste motion was involved
because the new techniques modem latrines, modern
methods of cultivation, modern methods of handling cre¬
dit were introduced without recognition of the impor¬
tance of grounding them in the culture of the recipients.
Their original culture, whether that of a village in South
America, an enclave of peasant immigrants in the United
States, a village in South-East Asia, or an African tribe,
was soon as Intrinsically Inferior to the modern world,
something to be fought with, got over, got around, by
hasty, widespread "fundamental education".
Those adults who had learned to read, to order new
seeds, to protect their wells, to drain their ponds tho.se
who were "modern" rather than' or
"traditional" were viewed rather like an army of poorly
equipped recruits who had been furbished up with acce¬
lerated methods to make It possible for them to operate
within the army setting. Although they had a lot of
new skills and acceptances, they were not expected to
be, in any important sense, changed people, merely a
new and less embarrassing sort of inferior people.
This kind of catching up at a low level has effected
the elementary educational systems of the less developed
countries. As a result, the Ideal of universal éducation
which has caught the imagination of peoples all over
the world is, In fact, an ideal of raising the bulk of the
population of countries now 80 or 90 per cent Illiterate
up to the standard of elementary third of fourth grade
education in countries with established secondary school
systems.
o the extent that these new systems of education
H borrow from the modern Industrialized world, and
-^*- teach 6-year-olds as If they were first year pupils
In a 10- or 12-year educational system, the teaching of
reading, for example, will include vocabulary and allu¬
sions in anticipation of a secondary school education that
will never be given. Moreover, the essential lack of
connexion between the literacy taught In school and a
world in which nothing will ever be read except a few
government notices and forms makes the whole system
Into a mockery.
The edge is being taken oil the hunger for "education"
almost more insistent than the hunger for better food,
in so many parts of the worldby this reflection, at the
elementary school level, of the essentially superficial Image
introduced by attempts at rapid "fundamental education"
for the adult villagers of these societies.
The most recent phase of the emphasis on fundamen¬
tal or community education indicated a growing acknow¬
ledgment of a "widening gap" between the economi¬
cally highly developed and the economically underde¬
veloped countries an idea rapidly replacing our Immedi¬
ately post World War II image of a triumphant attack
on ignorance, poverty and ill health right round the
world.
The underdeveloped countries were entering the educa¬
tional scene at a period when the rate of change In
knowledge, especially in the sciences, was the fastest
mankind had ever known; therefore, however fast these
new countries might move towards universal literacy,
towards a full complement of elementary schools for all
children, towards the beginning of secondary schools,
towards a national university, they would fall farther
and farther behind in a world race for the number of
students in universities.
This lag would be not only quantitative but also quali¬
tative; fewer students would have a chance or getting
higher education, so fewer first-rate students would be
identified. The bright optimism of freedom from Igno¬
rance for all was fading.
Meanwhile, in the most industrialized countries, It 's
being recognized that the kinds of distinctions which
were once made between "education" the orderly trans¬
mission of certain parts of our accumulated tradition to
the young while they were still in statu pupillari, and
"adult education", which imparted to adults, in odd
hours and off seasons, some things they should have
learned when they were young, are no longer meaningful.
A great deal of what needs to be taught to adults
today was unknown when they were young. Continuing
education throughout life has become a necessity in
almost every field of life, from housekeeping to atomic
physics. The emphasis is no longer upon the mass of
materials and skills contained in a "good education", dis¬
tributed in unequal amounts among the members of dif¬
ferent socio-economic groups within a nation, and among

OUR MODERN WORLD (Cont'd)
STEREOTYPE OF THE 'HORSE AGE' MENTALITY
the peoples of the world, in which all would soon come
to have at least a small and inferior share.
Instead, attention is being given to the relationships
between old knowledge and old skills, and new know¬
ledge and new skills, and to the difference in the ways
of learning of children, uncommitted young adults with¬
out family responsibilities, and mature adults with res¬
ponsibilities.
This recognition is coming on the heels of a period in
history when change was slow enough for the difference
In the kind of acceptance which was given by grand¬
father and grandson to a new idea to be explained by
the inability of the old to learn new ideas. Elasticity
and speed of learning were believed to be unique charac¬
teristics of childhood, and all learning was therefore
seen, although it was not usually put that way, as a
subtle Interference with any other learning.
Having learned French made one less able to
learn English, having learned to plough with
a hand plough made one less able to plough
with a draft animal, having learned to make pots by hand
made one less able to learn to use a potter's wheel.
Grandfather, who grew up in the horse age, was less able
to adapt to the machine age than his grandson ; this
observation successfully precluded any recognition that
the first machines were Invented and driven, not by chil¬
dren, but by men who had grown up riding and driving
horses.
It was not too difficult to transmute the peoples of
Asia or Africa Into a kind of exaggerated replica of this
view of grandfatherpeople who would really never learn
about the modern world, who would never catch up.
The break may be said to have come when it was not
a question of grandfather, whose ignorance could be
explained away, but of self, when modern man began
to realize that his own education was never finished,
that he could fall behind, in any field, almost overnight,
that education was no longer a matter of receiving while
young a' body of static knowledge, but had become a
matter of lateral learninglearning not only from one's
elders and one's peers, but very soon from those younger
than oneself. Now, with much more rapid change, the
deficiencies in the old attitude toward learning began to
show; the need for a new attitude became apparent.
he merest flicker of recognition of this new state
H of education where change occurs very much
.^L. more rapidly than normal human growth and a
man can become outdated (or, in that curiously snobbish
phrase, dated) not as he attains grey hairs and harden¬
ing arteries, but before he has reached middle age, the
merest hint of this ls enough to change our whole view
of what was once called adult education.
It is no longer the underprivileged, the illiterate, the
newly migrant, the villagers to whom a new road gives
access to urban life, who as adults learn crumbs fallen
from the tables of those who as children feasted on the
slowly accumulated knowledge of the past. Now it is the
elite among the adults of the educationally elite countries
who "go back to school" our words are still out of
date with post-graduate fellowship piled on post-gra¬
duate fellowship, with exchange visits and small inter¬
national conferences which accomplish in a week more
than a year of reading could do.
Our most massive endeavours at rethinking educational
devices and methods are aimed at teaching physics, or
cross-referencing biology. We are experiencing on a vast
scale what has happened before on a lesser scale, at
times when a new burst of knowledge, or knowledge-
producing activity, moved a certain number of men to
withdraw from the world and spend a lifetime master¬
ing, moulding, and organizing the new knowledge for
orderly transmission to future generations.
But if the knowledge with which men must work,
and think, and orient their actions is changing almost
daily, there is also a change in the relative positions of
those whose forebears were educated in the old sense
and those whose forebears were primitive men or isolat¬
ed peasants.
Becoming an educated man does not depend, as it
once did, on using the plastic years of childhood to accu¬
mulate' a vast static body of information, of names of
things, of forms of spelling and rhetoric, but rather upon
the way in which a child learns to approach change
itself. When that which was to be learned was settled
and absolute enough to last a lifetime, the child whose
parents and grandparents, playmates and neighbours had
learned most of the same things could safely be taught
that this particular accumulation of knowledge was true.
What once constituted an education a hodge-podge of
old and new ideas about the universe, old wives' tales
and modern untried medical research, the spelling and
pronunciation of one's language currently approved in the
grammar books and dictionaries, the relative status of
different countries, the intrinsic merits of particular forms
of government, special forms of law and punishment, the
whole mass of materials of different ages, different
degrees of accuracy, provinciality and usefulness this sort
of education once served well enough to get each indi¬
vidual through his lifetime in the state of life in which
he had begun it.
And such an education also served effectively to
prevent much learning of new things. The
observation that it was easier for an English
boy to learn Latin than it would have been for a Nigerian
was partly grounded on the ubiquity of Roman-derived
elements in English culture, but even more on the expec¬
tation that an English education included Latin. An
attempt to introduce Chinese into both a contemporary
English school and a contemporary Nigerian school would
meet objections because, in both the English school and
in the Nigerian school modelled on the English school,
Chinese was not something schoolboys learned.
The educated man simply acquired more little pigeon¬
holes which it was appropriate for him to fill, sometimes
even such bold little labels as a hit of "comparative reli¬
gion" or "oriental languages" for the very few; he was
prepared to add in certain ways, in certain little boxes,
"the results of research" as long as they did not contra¬
dict too gravely what he had already learned in which
case he fought them as furiously as an Asian peasant
resists a new type of field division. As soon as this was
recognized, it also became apparent that what was cru¬
cial in the ability to assimilate changing information
was not what had been learned but how it had been
learned.
The child who had been solemnly taught that there
is only major categorization of languages, a real language
spoken by its own group, and "'the way foreigners talk,"
is as effectively blocked off from new learning as the
peasant' who was taught to cling, with the desperation
of the man who grasps only a part of his culture,
to the way things were done in "his village," or as the
nineteenth-century rationalist who believed that all
problems of the relationship between Science, spelled
with a capital, and religion had been solved by abolishing
religion or relegating it to the level of "superstition."
Under the old system, children learned better than
adults; they filled their notebooks and their minds with
orderly sets of prejudices so arranged that there was
less and less room for genuinely new ideas which would
mean fundamental rearrangements at the root of the
system.

The Unesco Courler. Jonuory 196)
Three Lions, New York
THE GREAT CAPACITY for learning which is found in
early childhood will in future be needed for something rather
different than in the past. Childhood learning was once devoted
to impressing on young minds a mass of facts ranging from
the eternal and the trivial to the provincial and the special.
For the world of tomorrow children will need to learn about
the nature of numbers, the nature of time, ways of thinking
about space and similar problems. Here, children learn how
separate colours fuse with each other to form new tones.
Learning a language was not a matter of learning
about languages which could be expanded to include all
known languages, artificial languages, and the creation
of new languages but was rather a condensation of the
tremendous piece of learning, learning to speak, and the
acquisition of a single language viewed in such a way
that the learning of most, if not all, other languages was
successfully prevented. Each knob and twist of the sys¬
tem, each local article of food or hygiene, was elevated
into a state of absoluteness within which change could
be introduced only in carefully prescribed areas where
there were such matters as "fashion" or "new products".
But even in the old system, an adult did generalize
far more than he was required to. He learned not only
about francs or shillings or dollars, but enough about
"money" so that even though he never treated the
money of a foreign country as real he could still manage
to use it. A man who had lived in a city knew some¬
thing about the nature of cities, knew how to look for
terminals and hostels and markets, for places of exchange
and accommodation things that, as in the case of money,
no child knew. As men learned a particular culture,
were educated in a particular way, they acquired a kind
of back-handed, semi-realized knowledge of culture itself,
although this knowledge was heavily hampered by the
absoluteness with which they learned their own system.
Now today, the premium will be placed on individuals
who are most able to preserve the kind of charts of pos¬
sible knowledge and possible action into which each new
experiment and innovation can fit. It will be the adult
who has incorporated a new generalization, that ls. the
possibility of change at every point of his whole system of
knowledge, who will be able to learn most and go fur¬
thest. The tremendous Impetus to learning possible In
early childhood will be needed for something rather
different than Its past uses.
Children will have to learn that their own
language ls one among many, their own alpha¬
bet only one of the ways of writing down speech,
their own system of mathematical notations only one
among many; that these are not the final systems, and
often not the best. Childhood learning was once devoted
to printing indelibly on young minds such matters as
Sixty seconds in a minute,

or:
or:
'V before 'c'
Except after 'c'
And when pronounced 'ay'
As in neighbour and weigh.
Instead of committing to memory this dreadful hetero¬
geneous pickle of the eternal, the trivial, the provincial
and the special, children will be required In the future
to learn about the nature of numbers, the nature of time,
ways of thinking about space.
This shift in what the young need to be taught will
have a profound effect on the ability of adults, whether
adult members of a New Guinea tribe, adult peasants,
adult migrants to a big city, or adult scholars who
haven't looked at science for forty years, to learn comple¬
tely new things.
hose who have learned that there arc many
H systems in the worldlanguage systems such as
.JL. the many unwritten tongues spoken by the
adjacent tribesmen, or systems of weights, and measures
such as the English and the metric systems, or systems of
transportation (human backs, Jeeps, planes) rapidly
replacing one another within the span of a few years
those adults will be recognized as the ones who are able
to learn new things fast; their experience and expectation
of contrast and change will be part of the equipment
which they, as adults, bring to any new required piece of
learning.
Instead of pityingly, tolerantly, helping adults to catch
up with a little symbolic erudition or a few strictly uti¬
litarian skills, we shall make a real search for adults
who, just because they are adults, can build new know¬
ledge on old in a way that the young child cannot. We
won't particularly seek out adults who have learned
their quota as children, nor steer away from those who
failed to learn their quota as children; rather we shall
place our emphasis on the kind of adult mind which
ls able to make swift, accurate transference from older
experience to newer experience, because neither is felt as
absolute or exclusive.
The next few years will be particularly valuable as
we explore the extent to which adults with extraordi¬
narily simple backgrounds but with this one requirement
an experience and expectation of changecan move
into our complex modern culture and contribute new
models for the way it can be learned, not only by adult
savages but by adults everywhere.

Acultural renaissance is taking place in New
York City on a fourteen acre site once dotted
with slums. It is embodied in a bold and
imaginative project, called the Lincoln Center
for the Performing Arts, undertaken to satisfy the rebirth
of interest in the arts, an interest generated not only by
New Yorkers and Americans but by peoples of other lands
as well.
"Here will occur a true interchange of the fruits of
national cultures," said President Eisenhower at the
groundbreaking ceremonies for the center on May 14, 1959.
"From this will develop a growth that will spread to the
corners of the earth, bringing with it the kind of human
message that only individuals, not governments, can
transmit."
Upon its scheduled completion in the spring of 1964,
Lincoln Center will offer seven theatres, concert halls and
educational buildings in which the world's greatest music,
drama and dance will be performed before more than
3,200,000 people a year. Costing more than $140,000,000, it
is probably the most ambitious civic project ever un¬
dertaken anywhere for the arts.
The concept of a cultural center has been discussed for
years by many individuals and organizations but the seeds
of the Lincoln Center were sown in 1955 when the Metro¬
politan Opera and the New York Philharmonic Orchestra
each sought a new hall to better their existing facilities.
Their joint eight-month study revealed that performing
arts audiences were larger than ever before and the point
had been reached on the American scene when advance¬
ment of these arts must become a community responsibili¬
ty, in the same way as health, education and welfare.
Under the chairmanship of John D. Rockefeller III
further studies were undertaken to determine Just what
problems would lie In a cultural center's path and where
that path should lead. The following June, Lincoln Center
formally came into being to provide New York, the United
States and other countries with "a new landmark... a
symbol of our national regard for the arts and our recog¬
nition of their importance in the lives of the American
people," the center's new president said.
A site was bought from the city at public auction on
Manhattan's Upper West Side under a Slum Clearance
programme. More than 1,600 families were relocated to
apartments better than or the equal of those they had
left. One hundred and eighty-eight buildings were reduc¬
ed to rubble. And a fund raising programme was
undertaken to solicit grants and contributions from
foundations, corporations and individuals. The initial
campaign goad was $75,000,000, but because of rising costs
and expanded concepts this was recently increased to
$102,000,000.
Finally, in May 1958, the architects were chosen.
Wallace K. Harrison, who had designed the United Na¬
tions Secretariat, Rockefeller Centre and Idlewlld Airport,
all in New York, was named co-ordinating architect for
the center as well as the designer responsible for the new
Metropolitan Opera House. The other architects are Max
Abramovitz, for the Philharmonic Hall; Eero Saarinen,
collaborating with Jo MieMner, on the Repertory Drama
Theatre; Dr. Pietro Belluschi, dean of the School of
Architecture and Planning at the Massachusetts Institute
of Technology, who will design the new Juilliard School of
Music; Philip Johnson Associates, for the Theatre for the

preliminary design consultants for the Library-Museum of
the Performing Arts.
To get the best possible sight lines, acoustics, stage
areas, etc., for each of the performing halls, a team of
experts, led by Mr. Harrison, toured more than thirty of
Europe's finest concert stages and interviewed dozens of
star performers to get their opinion on what was best.
In addition a group of European authorities in the field,
such as Walther Unruh of Germany, Alvar Aalto oí
Finland and Sven Markelus of Sweden, came to New York
to consult with the center's designers.
So detailed was this survey that it included a report that
American hip sizes had grown larger in the last century.
Therefore each theatre chair had to be designed bigger
and, for the sake of comfort, the theatres became larger,
too. "Urufortunateily, the voices of the artists haven't
become any bigger," Mr. Haralson said.
The prima donna of the center will be the $32,000,000
air-conditioned Metropolitan Opera House at the head of
a giant plaza. It will be fronted by ten-story high
columns separated by glass wauls. Behind the lobby and
stage areas (there will be at least four stages) will rise a

will be able to accomodate with equal ease solo artists,
dance recitals, small instrumental groups as well as a full
symphony orchestra with chorus.
Competing with Old Vic, Comédie Française and The
Abbey Theatre will be Lincoln Center's Repertory Drama
Theatre, designed to seat 1,100 persons and to capture the
true spirit of the theatre with great intimacy and
closeness of the entire audience to the stage. The Theatre
TERRACE overlooking the North Plaza is formed
by bridge running over 65th Street. In the back¬

for the Dance and Operetta, "a not-so-small opera
house" for 2,500 patrons, will serve the center as an Opera
Comique and bring to audiences major repertory
companies and light opera groups from the United States
and abroad.
"But the center must be more than performance halls,"
affirms its president. "It must place an Important
emphasis on education and creative work." Therefore
the Juilliard School of Music, one of the finest institutions
of its kind In the world, will be a major constituent devot¬
ed exclusively to advanced training of highly gifted
students in the performing arts.
Along these same Unes a Library-Museum of the Per¬
forming Arts was incorporated Into the center offering
hundreds of thousands of books, records, sheet music and
other memorabilia on the arts to encourage creative
scholarship. Here, too, will be facilities for viewing
motion pictures and slides, playing records and tape re¬
cordings and a children's theatre for puppet shows and
the like.
For outdoor concerts a band shell overlooking a park
will be an attractive feature, especially in the wann and
humid summer months. And underneath the entire site
spaces for the parking of 800 cars is planned.
New York may not be the only city in the United States
which ls undergoing a "cultural explosion," as one writer
has put it. But "nowhere else are premier performing
institutions in all the performing arts joined together
with artistic education in one dynamic union dedicated to
the service of the people," says the center's president.
The major task still lies ahead, that of actually putting
the brick and mortar together for artistically perfect
results. But when that work is done and the house lights
go down for the first production, then New York will be
the centre of the cultural renaissance of twentieth century
America.

CALAMARi, Poulpe, Inkfish: most travellers have
met these on menus, especially in Mediterra¬
nean lands. Yet how many know exactly what
they are eating: fish, sea-mammal, crustacean
or what? Actually they are members of the
octopus family, which means they are molluscs, that large
branch of the animal kingdom to which the snail and
oyster belong.
Scientifically, octopuses and similar animals, belong to
the Cephalopoda, which comes from two Greek words
meaning "head-footed". The "'foot" refers to the arms
or tentacles which spring from the head. Cephalopods
are found in all the oceans of the world, living in waters
ranging from those inside the Arctic Circle to those on
the edge of the Antarctic Continent. They are especially
abundant in the Mediterranean.
Altogether there are some 650 known species, ranging
from midgets that can perch on the end of a finger, to
the giant squid which sometimes reaches 50ft. and weighs
a ton or more. This is the largest invertebrate on earth.
In European waters the best-known cephalopods are
three in number. There is the common octopus which has
eight arms and a globular body. It has a maximum span
of about 10ft. Then there is the common cuttlefish which
has, in addition to eight arms, two long tentacles which
shoot out like a pair of living tongs to seize its prey. It
has a shield-shaped body strengthened internally by a
large calcareous cuttlebone. With tentacles extended a
large common cuttlefish may measure three feet.
Finally, there is the common squid which also has eight
arms and two tentacles. It has a torpedo-shaped body
supported internally by a delicate horn-like shell. When
fully grown it measures some three feet with extended
tentacles, although larger specimens have been taken.
Cephalopods are among the most interesting creatures
in the sea. Just look at their specification and perfor¬
mance. They have three hearts which pump blue blood
through their bodies. They possess greater powers of

colour change than the chameleon and have luminescent
displays which out-rival those of the fire-fly. They emit
rockets as well. And they shoot through the sea, and some-
tames sail out of it, by the most modem means of travel,
jet-propulsion.
It is a humbling thought to realise that one of man's
latest inventions has been ante-dated by relatives of the
snail. Squids were jetting itheir way through primeval seas
millions of years before man appeared on this planet.
The jet's propulsive force is sea-water, shot in fast-
repeated pulses from a single nozzle, called the funnel,
beneath the head. Water enters a cavity in the body, the
inlet is then sealed, and the heavily muscled walls of
the chamber contract, forcing the water out through the
nozzle at high speed. By the law of action and reaction,
as the jet shoots one way, the squid is driven in the
opposite direction.
Not much is known of the soeed but there is evidence

BATTLE with a giant squid which has attacked the submarine
"Nautilus" was filmed in the Walt Disney production of Jules
Verne's "20,000 Leagues Under the Sea". Giant squids, largest
Invertebrate's on earth, sometimes reach 50 feet in length.
Drawing by Gustave Doré
CAVE COMBAT between man and squid was vividly des¬
cribed by Victor Hugo in his novel "The Toilers of the Sea".
Squids are sometimes called "devil fishes", incorrectly so for
this name properly belongs to a skatelike tropical fish.
Wilhelm Schafen
DUMMY SQUID is formed by a blob of ink ejected from the
squid's ink sac which helps to draw an enemy's attack away
from the squid itself. The ink also acts against the olfactory
sense, of eels which are among the squid's worst enemies.
KINGDOM OF THE OCTOPUS (Cont'd)
that the fastest squids may reach a speed of 20 m.p.h.,
although most cephalopods travel much more slowly.
While the sole means of locomotion of cuttlefish and
squid is swimming, octopuses frequently ramble about the
ocean floor, using their arms to move like outsize spiders.
It is then that they truly live up to their scientific name
and "walk on their heads".
The ability to change colour is due to tiny pigment
cells, called chromatophores, which are filled with diffe¬
rently coloured pigments embedded in the skin. By
expanding and contracting ithese, thus spreading or reduc-
the pigment, colour changes flow over the skin. These
changes sometimes occur so fast that G.H. Parker, the
American authority on colour changes, says they "must
involve a complexity of communications and of controls
such as are present in the modern electric sign over
whose surface an ever-changing design may be made to
pass".
Miss Joyce Allan, an Australian zoologist, saw some
small cuttlefish swimming slowly about an aquarium
coiiitadning variously coloured objects. As the cuttles pass¬
ed over dark, reddish-brown rock they matched its col¬
our perfectly. A few inches away there was some dead
coral, and as the cuttles passed over it they turned a
light grey. Then, in turn, light brown for sand, green-
brown for weeds, and back again to the reddish-brown
of the rock.
C_-._._-
à ^H the defences of cephalopods against their nume-
^^^ rous enemies : another is ink discharge. This used
to be thought of as a simple smoke-screen but today it
is known to be more complicated. The ink acts against
the olfactory sense of eels the worst enemies of the
octupus and, strange as it may sound, without olfactory
stimulation the eels won't attack. The ink also forms
shapes or dummies, which simulate the form of the
cephalopod and draw an enemy's attack away from the
animal itself.
D.N.F. Hall, a marine zoologist, had an interesting
object-lesson in cephalopod escape tactics when he tried
to catch a small squid in a wooden tub aboard a ship.
When his fingers were about nine inches away, the
squid turned dark and seemed to stay still. Hall made a
grab and seized a small blob of ink. The squid was
at the other end of the tub.
Hall tried again, and this time he watched exactly
what happened. After turning dark, the squid ejected
ink which simulated its body, simultaneously turning pale
and shooting away round the perimeter of the tub.
Hall had the advantage of watching the squid and its
ink discharge from above in an enclosed space; in the
open sea the squid's chances of escaping would have
been much greater.
Luminescence may not have the same defensive quali¬
ties as colour change but it renders some cephalopods
among the most beautiful creatures in the animal king¬
dom. The British marine zoologist, Sir Alister Hardy,
once said of the small deep-water squid Lycoteuthis
diadema: "It is one of the most beautiful animals I
have ever seen."
The luminescence is produced in several ways but the
most frequent is by small organs called photophores,
which become luminous by minute chemical reactions.
For the technically minded, the source of the light is
an enzyme-catalysed reaction, luciferase acting on luci-
ferin.
The effect of the luminescence is well described by the
German marine zoologist, Carl Chun, in the following
remarks about Lycoteuthis diadema:
"Among all the marvels of colouration which the
animals of the deep sea exhibited to us nothing can be
even distantly compared with hues of these organs
(photophores). One would think that the body was
adorned with a diadem of brilliant gems. The middle
organs of the eyes shone with an ultramarine blue, the
lateral ones with a pearly sheen. Those towards the
front of the lower surface of the body gave out a ruby-
red light, while those behind were snow-white or pearly,

except the median one, which was sky-blue. It was

Think of that the next time you eat a calamari!
A few squids fire phosphorescent "rockets" the
best-known being Heteroteuthis dispar, which is about
the size of a man's thumbnail. The light-giving secretion
is a form of mucus, and comes from a gland near the
ink-sac. When the mucus meets the oxygen in the
water it glows brightly, sometimes for five minutes. The
"rocket" may serve to startle a pursuer thus giving the
tiny squid time to escape.
I suppose the aspect of cephalopods, especially of octo¬
puses, which has captured popular imagination more than
any other is their alleged danger to man. Let a bather

LIVE OCTOPUS is being used here by a Japan¬

once settled, are reluctant to withdraw, so the

a story of a near-escape from a watery grave in the
arms of a loathsome sea-monster.
What is the truth? When I was writing Kingdom of
the Octopus (1), which is the first general popular book on
cephalopods to be published in any country this century,
I went into this question carefully. I read widely, I cor¬
responded with scores of people in various countries, and
I asked in the Press for people able to give authentic
(1) Published by Jarrolds, London; price 30/-
accounts of attacks to get In touch with me. From the
results of my research, I believe that the vast majority
of cephalopods which are normally encountered are
harmless, but that some of these have occasionally killed
people, and that there are rare outsize cephalopods (giant
squids) which have sunk small boats.
I had a letter from a woman who was an eye-wit¬
ness of an incident in which a bather was seized in
shallow water by an octopus, and would probably have
been killed had not help been at hand. The octopus span¬
ned less than six feet and weighed only a few pounds.
And in "The Medical Journal for Australia" in 1955
there was a detailed account of the death of a young
man after he had been bitten In the neck region by a
small octopus. It ls not generally realized that some
octopuses can bite and Inject poison.
fH
^1 EPHALOPODS are useful to man In various ways.
^^^ J They are the favourite bait of many sea-
* fishermen; they are fed to animals and spread
on the land as fertilizers; their bone sharpens the beaks
of cage-birds and their ink has provided pigment for
artist for thousands of years; and their brains and
nervous systems provide valuable material for .sclentlllc
research.
Throughout the world thousands of tons of cephalo¬
pods are eaten every year. When I was researching for
my book I made numerous enquiries about cephalopod
fisheries and eventually I complied the first published
table showing the world catch, country by country.
By far the largest catch In Europe Is In Italy. In 1953
22,000 tons were taken. In China the annual catch ls
around four times this figure. But In Japan, the annual
catch averages some half a million tons!
Here ls a fruitful field for Investigation by world
food organizations. Today the annual catch of cephalo¬
pods throughout the world ls probably In the region of
one million tons, about one pound for every man, woman
and child on earth. But what would the catch bo If a
really intensive effort like that In Japanwere made by
the world's fishing fleets? A thought well worth pon¬
dering in terms of the world's desperate food shortage.
What do cephalopods taste like? Opinions vary from
"fishy india-rubber" and "a sort of marine tripe" to
"better than oysters" and "delicious eating". I think
It ls fair to say that If cephalopods are not prepared
and cooked properly they may well taste like "india-rub¬
ber." For anyone who Intends to eat themboiled,
baked or fried there is one invariable rule for all except
the smallest specimens : pound them until the muscular
tissues are beaten to a pulp.
T
n Spain one delicacy ls stulled octopus with choco-
H late flavouring. In Portugal octopuses and cuttlefish
-JBfc-are cooked In their own Ink and canned for export.
A Japanese delicacy ls toasted octopus cooked in oil over
a charcoal brazier.
Since the 1930s another, and potentlaly most valuable,
use has been found for cephalopods. Physiologists and
medical research workers have been studying the action
of the nervous system in animals for many years. But
the work suffered from a severe handicapthe tiny na¬
ture of the material available, for In most mammals a
nerve-fibre is only l/l,000th of an Inch or so in diameter.
And that Is the value of cephalopods for some of the
nerve-fibres In, say, the common squid are about 1/20 th
of an Inch thick, thus Increasing fifty-fold the width of
the physiologists' basic material.
It has become possible to insert tiny electrodes into
the living nerve-fibres of squids and obtain electrical
measurements hitherto Impossible with other animal
material. This Information has helped considerably in
discovering how nerves work Including human nerves.
And that is an essential step in learning how to care for
them in sickness and In health. Who knows, maybe there
are people today who owe their mental health to a squid !

In Arab Lands
LEARNING ME
by Georges Fradier
This is the second of three articles on
the educational situation of Asia, the
Middle East and Africa by our special
correspondent, Georges Fradier. The
first, on Asia, appeared in our Novem¬
ber issue. Georges Fradier now des¬
cribes the problem in countries of
the Arab world from Iraq to Morocco.
I
n the third century of the Hegira, around the year
840, a genial moralist with a taste for writing on every
imaginable subject included in his Book of Exposition
and Demonstration the portraits of various teachers in
Baghdad, Kufa and Basra. He carefully differentiated
between the eminent lecturers in law and theology whose
discourses enthralled distinguished gatherings and the
mass of enthusiastic and half-starved schoolteachers who
grappled with hordes of children.
In the days of Abu Utman al-Djahiz there was indeed
no lack of schoolteachers in Islam. Long before the con¬
quests and conversions there were undoubtedly many more
teachers in the Middle East than there were in Europe,
teaching in Greek at one place, in Syriac at another, in
Hebrew, Persian or Arabic. By propagating "the world's
most read book", the new faith had stimulated the spirit
of study and research. Every mosque had its school
where the Koranic adage was inculcated: "He unto whom
wisdom is given, he truly hath received abundant good"
or that injunction of the Prophet's to "Seek knowledge
even if it be in China, since the seeking of knowledge
ls obligatory upon every Moslem, man or woman."
Until the fifteenth century, elementary education the
teaching of reading, writing and arithmetic which was
virtually general in the towns advanced side-by-side
with the vast expansion of Arab science and culture.
The latter, even when they had declined in the Iraqi and
Syrian towns from which they emerged, continued to
grow stronger and to proliferate in Central Asia, in Sicily
and above all in Europe and North Africa.
But at the end of this period, the great historian Ibn

in the Arabie speaking countries there are now nearly

there are enough schools and teachers for all the 15 million
children of school age, like the Arab boy (above) on a hillside
overlooking his native village. Often the only kind of edu¬
cation available is in the traditional Koranic schools (below).

Khaldoun ended a chapter on the "philosophic sciences"
with the statement, "We are told that in the country of
the Franks and in the land of Rome and the neighbouring
regions of the northern coasts (of the Mediterranean) the
philosophic sciences are greatly in favour, their princi¬
ples have been revived, there are many groups to teach
them and there is an increasing number eager to study
them..." Thus, the European Renaissance was proclaim¬
ed in Tunis at the very moment when Arab culture and
education were about to enter a long period of stagnation
and even decline. Economic depression, loss of inde¬
pendence, cities sunk in apathy . . .
During four centuries, the cultivated population was
barely able to do more than maintain the tongue of the
masters of the Golden Age. Their doctrines and their
works together with their universities became lifeless.
Elementary education itself became rarer and rarer and
less and less valued. The small schools survived, gene¬
rally kept going by religious foundations: under the direc¬
tion of ignorant teachers, themselves a vestige of the
Middle Ages persisting into the nineteenth century, the
children the male children were given an education
consisting of learning verses from the Koran by heart.
Nevertheless, the Arab revival had begun in the nine¬
teenth century. Among the Christians of Lebanon and
the Moslems of Egypt, thinkers, statesmen and poets shook
the dust from the old books. Reformers introduced the
disciplines and sometimes the methods of "modern" edu¬
cation into the ancient universities of Al Azhar, of Cairo
and of Zaitouna in Tunisia. Thenceforward the move¬
ment developed with astonishing speed. Under the
influence of the new universities in Cairo, Alexandria
and Beirut, education at all levels has recovered the vigour
and prestige which had been lost for so long. Taking
the Arab countries as a whole, it might seem the solution
of fundamental educational problems was already In sight.
Unfortunately, the Arab world ls enormous and progress
has been made at a very different rate In the various
countries. Some Arab countries lag a good many years
behind others. In more than one country, hampering
tensions arise from the co-existence, and some times rival¬
ry, of the traditional schools which are almost wholly
religious in nature and the undenominational schools mo¬
delled on the Western pattern. By way of compensa¬
tion, in other countries State educationwhich, inci¬
dentally, provides for regular religious Instructionhas
been able to develop unhindered. But In all Arab
countries alike, from the derricks of Kuwait to the
pasture lands of the Atlas region, from the banks of the
Orontes to the banks of the Upper Nile, the longing for
education merges with the will to play a part in the Arab
renaissance.
here are grounds for believing that this longing
H will be fulfilled. Indeed, taking all Arab coun-
-^ÊL. tries together, one finds that the annual rate of
Increase in the number of children at school ls about 10
per cent, whereas the annual rate of Increase In the
number of children of school age ls only about 3 or 4 per
cent. Plainly, the race between population Increase and
the schools ls going to be won by the schools If this trend
persists.
In those Arab States which are the best-equipped and
the best situated In the field of education there are still
thousands of children for whom there is no accommo¬
dation in the schools or whose villages still have no
school worthy of the name. In yet other countries which
were only recently able to begin their educational pro¬
gramme, the majority of the children must still be left
to one side or temporarily forgotten about.
Sometimes It ls necessary to consider emergency mea¬
sures, the mobilization of available resources in order to
speed up education; sometimes the authorities are above-
all preoccupied with reforming the content and the tools
of teaching where these are thought Inadequate to the
needs of the young and of the community as a whole.
Almost Invariably they are forced back to the same great
problem: how to train the masters who arc now needed
and who will be needed even more tomorrow?
An enquiry recently carried out by Unesco In
10 Arab countries (1) reveals that the most
urgent problem today is the "shortage of qua¬
lified teachers."
In the Lebanon, for example, authorities describe the
present situation as "particularly disturbing." In the
whole country there is only one primary teacher-training
school and one secondary teacher-training school which
graduated 97 student-teachers in 1958. But the number
of posts which must be filled yearly ls approximately
two hundred In respect of primary education and seventy
in respect of secondary education. In these circumstances,
it is hardly surprising that a number of classes are
conducted by teachers whose qualifications are more than
a little vague. "About half the teachers in the primary
schools have had a training inferior to a complete secon¬
dary course."
The situation is perhaps most serious in Libya where,
in order to press ahead as rapidly as possible, it was
found nece.ssary to employ a number of primary school
teachers who themselves had received little more than
primary education. In Morocco where at least 2,000 new

LEARNING MEANS LIGHT (Cont'd from page 17)
TEN MILLION CHILDREN IN SEARCH OF TEACHERS
teachers a year will be needed, the number of student-
teachers supplied by the teacher-training schools in 1959
was only 500. In the Sudan, the qualifications required
of a teacher consist of the diploma granted after the
first secondary stage plus two years' professional training;
but the eight institutions which offer this training are far
from able to meet current needs since in 1959 they were
only able to supply the country's 2,000 schools with 632
men teachers and 177 women teachers.
In this regard, one of the great difficulties confronting
Ministers of Education ls to find teachers for provinces
located far from the capital and, for that matter, for
villages which are close to the capital but which are
still only villages. The young teachers, accustomed to
the comfort of their colleges and the luxury of the big
cities, find living conditions in the villages intolerable.
Attempts have occasionally been made to solve this prob¬
lem by providing the teacher with living quarters in
accordance with his needs and tastes; but the cost of
building such quarters, even the least luxurious models,
is far beyond the financial means of almost all the Arab
countries.
Payment of indemnities provides no solution since the
teacher, however modest his requirements, is often unable
to find a reasonable house in the area to which he has
been appointed. The solution generally envisaged in these
countries today is one which has been repeatedly sug¬
gested in other regions: namely, that the ministers
concerned should recruit more young student-teachers in
these less attractive areas in the hope that, once their
training has been completed, they will want to return
there to teach.
It is, however, in the secondary and vocational schools
and in the trade training centres that the shortage of
teachers seems especially critical. In some countries the
full gravity of the situation is not yet apparent because
many of these Institutions were founded and are still
maintained by private groups, religious missions and even
foreign countries which provide a large proportion of the
staff and equipment. But with few exceptions, this aid
does not go far to meet the development which the
economic progress of these countries requires.
At the present time, 16 in a hundred pupils go to secon¬
dary schools and the proportion in secondary vocational
schools is 2 per cent. Thus, without noticeably increasing
these proportions, it is estimated that secondary institu-

trades in UNRWA-UNESCO school workshops.
tions in Iraq in 1965 will have 235,000 pupils, necessi¬
tating the training of 850 teachers per year. As things
stand, however, the total number of those graduating from
Iraq's teacher-training colleges barely exceeds 300.
In Libya, a number of secondary schoolteachers come
from neighbouring countries. In the Syrian province of
the United Arab Republic there is small hope of meeting
the needs of secondary institutions for several years to
come, even though private education at this level copes
with a large proportion of pupils. Egypt, in fact, would
seem to be the only country at present able to meet the
growing needs of secondary education.

Even Egypt is short of qualified teachers for certain
subjects, especially mathematics, science and modern lan¬
guages. Other countries make the same complaint and
generally with still more cause. It may be possible to
find first rate students in literature, history or even law,
philosophy or social sciences who, despite their hopes
for a different career, nevertheless become satisfactory
teachers of grammar, literature or the social sciences.
Their friends who have specialized in science, in English
or French, are not likely to accept to become teachers.
Unless they have a positive vocation for teaching, they
are more likely to take one of the infinitely more attrac¬
tive jobs offered by industry or commerce or the civil
service.
In countries, in the process of development which still
lack top-level men for the most Important sectors of the
national economy, it is useless to count on university
students turning to teaching as a last resort. The teacher-
training colleges must provide a full training for teachers
specializing in the different disciplines where neither
incompetents nor enthusiastic amateurs can be accepted.
Additionally, the State and public opinion must treat
teaching with the seriousness it deserves. A bad book¬
keeper is dismissed ; but too often an incompetent teacher,
whose shortcomings may have serious consequences, is
allowed to retain his position. From another point of
view it would be wholly unreasonable to argue that
teaching is such a noble profession that anyone who
abandons it for a better paid job is blameworthy.
"'Material advantages" cannot anywhere be neglected
for long. And in every one of the Arab States, the
Minister of Education realizes regretfully that teachers

are Inadequately paid. The salary scales may be the
same, by and large, as those for other civil servants with
comparable qualifications and seniority; but authorities
recognize that the teacher's modest pay is no longer pro¬
portionate to the amount of work and the professional
qualities which are required of him. His salary is a
hangover from the days when it was thought fitting
that the schoolmaster should be as poor as he was
respectable.
Some governments openly deplore the fact that the
salaries paid to young teachers are "slightly lower" than
those paid to other civil servants. Nobody in these
States denies that the remuneration received by teachers
is inadequate; on the contrary, there is a real desire to
improve their living conditions ; but so far the burdens
involved in expanding education have made it impossible
for most of the States to change things.
Over recent years, the educational authorities in almost
all the Arab countries have outlined their aims in docu¬
ments which have been as carefully thought over and
drawn up as the constitution of a new republic. Despite
significant variations in regard to one or another aspect
of the various tasks of education, all agree as to the basic
objective: to equip the child to play a full part in the
political and economic life of his country.
Most of these lands regard themselves as new countries,
in spite of the antiquity of their traditions. They know
that they are in the midst of an evolutionary process.
The citizens of tomorrow are expected to make their
country stronger, more prosperous, better qualified to play
a useful role in international life.
It may be asked whether the education provided in
primary and secondary schools is linked with and, indeed,
actually assists the achievement of this ambition.
No educator on earth can be completely sure that the

tration as two Jor¬

Education Centre.

programmes which he recommends or is called on to
follow are in every way ideally adapted to pupils' needs,
especially to their future needs as citizens and followers
of a career. To take an example from among the coun¬
tries with which we are dealing it is likely that there is
some doubt in the United Arab Republic as to the desi¬
rability of sharply divided "'streams" which result in
half of all secondary pupils completing two out of three
years without learning anything at all of mathematics,
physics, chemistry or natural sciences. On the other hand,
their fellow-students in the scientific stream have nothing
to do with history or geography. The programmes in
Libya, which have been drawn up on another basis, devote
20 hours a week during the last year (classical option)
of a five-year secondary course to the teaching of lan¬
guages, and not one hour to mathematics and science.
A graver defect which Arab educators have pointed out
In various educational Institutions ls the abstract, bookish,
not to say boring, nature of the teaching. The teaching

methods used in these schools, which vary in number and
size from country to country, rely overmuch on learning
by heart in order to pass examinations. Such methods,
Inherited perhaps from the old Mosque teachers who
concentrated on memorization, no longer suffice: they run
the risk of developing memory at the cost of logical
thinking, critical sense, the spirit of research and Indi¬
vidual Initiative. There are signs that the new generation
of teachers ls being trained in the modern teacher-
training colleges and universities to use very different
methods.
Unfortunately, this defect is reflected in the textbooks
which are still used by young schoolmasters both for
their own studies and in teaching their pupils. The
books providedor forced onthe pupils are all too often
sketchy and dogmatic, dry or ponderous and badly Illus¬
trated: it is rare indeed that they Introduce readers to
the "joy of reading" and the excitement of discovering
things for themselves. They supply a set of bleak abso¬
lutes which must be humbly imbibed In order to give
satisfaction and achieve success.
Additionally, In almost all the Arab States, secondary
educationand even vocational and technical education-
has long been synonomous with "Western" education,
wholly taught in English or French. This ls still the
case in a number of countries where the increased use
of Arabic in education is the order of the day. This
is not aimed at the abandonment of the European lan¬
guages currently used ncr even at the systematic substi¬
tution of Arabic as the teaching language at every level
and for every subject; but the curricula cannot much
longer remain based solely on those which emerged from
another culture, another history, a whole series of different
factors, In another country.
In certain cases, the subject-matter itself should be
radically modified geography and history, for example.
In other cases, the relative importance given to different
subjects is in need of revision: the ancient and modern
literature of a given region or nation cannot be left
in the background. Finally, there ls no doubt that.
Irrespective of the subjects studied and the final aim of
schooling, the study of Arabic should be made general
and deeper.

LEARNING MEANS LIGHT (Cont'd)
AN ANCIENT LANGUAGE GETS A MODERN DRESS
Some countries go further and envisage educational
reforms which are not only concerned with the national
language In relation to foreign languages. Education is
sometimes hindered, to a greater or lesser extent depend¬
ing on the region, by the differences between classical
or "literary" Arabic and the popular language spoken
by pupils and masters.
Between a language spoken by very different peoples
scattered over great areas and the classical form of that
language fixed 1,300 years ago In sacred writings, there
ls an inevitable gulf but it does not seem to hamper
literary studies In any way. Moreover, the durability of
the classical language has undoubtedly helped prevent
the growth of great differences between the various dia¬
lects and thus helped ensure the cohesion of the Arab
world.
One proof ls the use made after some adaptation, of
this form of the language
by press and radio. None
of this applies, however,
when the language is used
to teach and study scientific
subjects, using that term
in its widest sense, which
have only emerged during
the last two centuries and
which may even date from
as recently as yesterday.
Possibly because there are
still not enough original
works on physics, biology,
chemistry, sociology or poli¬
tical economy in Arabic,
the Arab student is often
puzzled by the vocabulary
and style used in these
sciences.
A number of groups or
institutions have therefore
taken on the daunting task
of adapting to the needs
of modern education the
language which the old
masters restricted to poetry,
prayer and law yet which
nevertheless once excited
the greatest admiration
when used in the fields of
logic, history, astronomy
and algebra. The Moroccan
Minister of Education
recently announced the
setting-up of an institute
for the development of
Arabic which, in co-operation with experts from various
countries, would work for the modernization and uni¬
fication of the different forms of spoken Arabic so as to
provide a single working language for both students
and researchers, for laboratories and schools, for news¬
papers and scientific journals.
The educational void which must be filled most urgent¬
ly in most Arab countries is to be found in technical
and, generally speaking, vocational training. The pro¬
portion of secondary pupils to primary pupils throughout
the whole region ls 16 per cent. This is, relatively, a high
proportion, even If the secondary education sometimes
seems unduly rapid. But the proportion of pupils enrolled
in institutions for training technicians in industry, agri¬
culture and commerce amounts to only 2 per cent of all
school enrolments.
All States which have laid down development plans to
ensure that their educational system is geared to their
economy envisage a very substantial Increase in technical
education at both the post-primary and secondary

levels. Morocco, for instance, expects that 44,000 pri¬
mary school pupils will go on to this type of educa¬
tion in October 1964: eight times as many as in 1959.
Several years ago the Arab States underlined the neces¬
sity of basing the future of their educational systems on
rational planning to meet their educational, social and
economic requirements. Some have already taken the
necessary steps; others still lack qualified staff.
The representatives of nine countries who studied these
problems at the Unesco Beirut Conference in February
1960, devoted themselves in particular to educational
planning and the relationship between such planning and
over-all economic and social planning. This conference
recommended the setting-up, with Unesco assistance, of
a Centre for the Advanced Training of Senior Personnel
in the preparation, execution and continual adaptation of
educational plans, within the framework of overall
planning.
This is one of many pro¬
jects which will unques¬
tionably help the Arab
States, and especially the
poorer ones, to overcome
the obstacles still hamper¬
ing the carrying out of
basic reforms. Certain ty¬
pes of limited, temporary
assistance are decisive if
provided at the right time
and in carefully selected
sectors. This would apply
to the training centre ; it
also applies to the techni¬
cal assistance missions
which the United Nations,
the Specialized Agencies
and particularly Unesco
continue to send to most
of these countries; an¬
other example is the Funda¬
mental Education Centre at
Sirs-el-Layyan in the Egyp¬
tian delta which has been
in operation for seven years
under the joint patronage
of the United Arab Republic
and Unesco.
Mention should also be
made of the work carried
out by UNRWA in the refu¬
gee camps of Jordan, Leba¬
non, Syria and Gaza: the
382 UNRWA-UNESCO
schools which have gradu¬
ally been developed in recent years have more than
100,000 pupils. Finally, the aid provided by the U.N. Spe¬
cial Fund to secondary technical education and higher
technical education will have far-reaching effects.
Whether for planning and statistics, school building or
teacher training, trade training centres or engineering
institutions, most of these States need assistance if they
are to overcome the barriers. It would be wrong to
exaggerate the seriousness of all these difficulties
(temporary shortage of staff and financial problems) but
they do prevent advances at the very moment when the
impulse towards progress is at its height.
Freed of these Initial concerns, the Arab States them¬
selves will do the rest and the rest, as they well know,
is gigantic. They will have to rid themselves of the
thousand and one difficulties which long years of isola¬
tion, poverty and sometimes dependence have placed on
the road leading to the economic, cultural and intellec¬
tual revival which they are determined to achieve.

Leo Tolstoy was looking through the great
number of letters he had received that day
from all parts of the world. He turned to a young friend
who was sitting with him A. Goldenvelser, the pianist

"I am ashamed to say so, but I do enjoy the authority

TOLSTOY'S 50.000 LETTERS (Cont'd)
yA day will come
when force will
no longer be
the sole factor
in freedom'
IN 1868, Tolstoy (left), now
40 years old, was engaged
on his masterpiece "War
and Peace". Ten years ear¬
lier he had visited Switzer¬
land, Germany and France
after which lie settled at
Yasanya Polyana where he
started a school for peasant
children and published a
journal devoted to the advan¬
cement of his pedagogical
ideas. He spent the rest of
his life at Yasanya Polyana

bearing the stamps of all mations, which are preserved
in the Tolstoy archives bear eloqent witness to his World¬
wide contacts.
Tolstoy set great store by his correspondence with peo¬
ple from all countries and continents. He appreciated the
opportunity it gave him to learn the truth about the
lives of far-off peoples, which was not always to be
found in newspapers of the time.
In his letters, and in his conversations with the visi¬
tors who came to Yasnaya Polyana from so many coun¬
tries, he was able to express himself even more freely
than In his articles and books to expound ideas and
views he regarded as the only true ones, and of which
he felt mankind to be in sore need. That was why he
replied with such alacrity to every one of his many cor¬
respondents, regardless of station in life, be he a Russian
peasant, an Indian philosopher, a Turkish poet, or a stu¬
dent in far-away Australia.
Among these world-wide contacts, Tolstoy paid great
attention to the countries of the East. His interest in
them grew particularly strong after 1880 when, after
passing through a profound spiritual crisis he embarked
resolutely upon a reassessment of the spiritual values of
mankind.
Thereafter he turned more and more to the East, to
the peoples of Asia and Africa. "It seems to me," he
wrote, "that it is the mission of ithe eastern nations
China, Persia, Turkey, India, Russia and perhaps Japan
to show other countries... the real road to freedom". Real
freedom meant, for him, a life untouched by tyranny or
violence, with no exploitation of man by man, no war
or conquest a life of peace, friendship and inter¬
national brotherhood.
Tolstoy's oriental correspondents differed widely in
their opinions, beliefs and religion and in their social
backgiround. Indian philosophers, Chinese scholars,
Japanese writers and publishers, Iranian poets and
journalists, Turkish lawyers, Arab peasants, teachers and
students, alii regarded the Russian writer as a faithful
friend of their own peoples and were ready to confide
their most private thoughts to him.
What drew them to Tolstoy, apart from his merits as a
great writer, was the breadth of his humanitarian ideals,
his sympathy for the oppressed and downtrodden, his
hatred of colonialism and his faith in the victory of the
righteous cause.
They told him of their intellectual quests, their doubts,
their joys and sorrows, and of their people's dreams of
freedom and happiness. Some of them described the
ordeals undergone by their people and begged him to
champion them against foreign or native oppressors.
The first distinguished Eastern intellectual to get in
touch with Tolstoy was Matsutaro Konisi, the Japanese
philosopher and writer. While in Moscow early in the
1890's, he was introduced to Tolstoy by N. Gret, the Rus¬
sian philosopher, and soon became his assistant in the
study and popularization of oriental philosophy. With
Konisl's help, Tolstoy published in Russia several books on
outstanding Asian thinkers. On his return to Japan,
Konisi translated The Kreutzer Sonata, Master and Man,
and other works by Tolstoy.
In 1896 another well-known Japanese visited Yasnaya
Polyana; this was the publisher Ijiro Tokutomi, who

used the pseudonym "Soho". He received a warm wel¬
come from Tolstoy and the two had many conversations,
enthusiastically reported in Tokutomi's paper, "The Peo¬
ple's Gazette" and his review "The People's Friend".
Translations of literary works and articles of Tolstoy's
also appeared in these publications.

is novel War and Peace, Anna Karenina and
H HI Resurrection, and his polemical writings, par-
JL Jt.ticularly My Confession and Bethink Yoursel¬
ves, became favourites with the Japanese public, while his
philosophy was adopted by a considerable number of
Japanese intellectuals.
Tolstoy's interest in Japanese culture found striking
expression in his friendship with the eminent essayist
and novelist Tokutomi Roka, who spent five unforget¬
table days at Yasnaya Polyana in 1906, returned to Japan
as an enthusiastic convert to the humanitarian views of
the great Russian, and upheld those views for the
remainder of his long and noble life.
Tolstoy's influence dominates the entire literature of
Japan in the early Twentieth century. Tolstoy's ideas,
according to the critic Naosi Kato, penetrated into every
corner of the Japanese rründ and, like gunpowder conceal
ed in the crannies of rocks, exploded with such force
as to shake all existing theories and principles to their
foundations. It was almost a revolution.
Tolstoy remained in touch with leading figures In
Japanese culture until the end of his life.
His bonds of friendship with India were even stronger.
The Japanese, he felt, had been In too much of a hurry
to assimilate certain bad features of Western civilization,
and their Inner world was something of a mystery to
him; but he felt complete sympathy for the Indians, with
their lofty conception of man's spiritual mission, their
zeal for moral progress and their tradition of non-violence.
He closely studied the life of the Indian people, and It
was a joy to him to be in touch with its representatives.
In 1901, A. Ramaseshan, editor of "The Arya", a review
published in Madras, wrote a series of eloquent letters
to Tolstoy about life in his country. Referring to India's
struggle against British Westernization, he wrote: "We
are confident that a day will come when force will no
longer be the sole factor in political freedom, and when,
after long, peaceful progress, the Indian nation will live
in peace and harmony with the European nations."
Tolstoy replied to Ramaseshan in a long, sympathetic
letter giving his views on the future of India. "I entirely
agree with you", he wrote. "Your country cannot
adopt the solution of the social problem proposed to It
by Europe which is, after all, no solution at all."
Tolstoy considered that India's future depended on stead¬
fast resistance to oppression and on a social structure
based on respect for man and the rejection of oppression
and violence.
He expanded these ideas in 1908 in his famous "Letter

HOLLOW-CHEEKED and with a piercing,
haunted look in his deep-set eyes, Tolstoy
is seen here with his daughter, Tatiana,
towards the end of his life, when he was deeply
troubled by family differences. In November
1910 he left home secretly at night and died a
few days later. His influence was already
immense and in the last 15 to 20 years of his
life he was probably the most venerated man
in the world. His fame reached into China
and India as well as Europe and America.
Visitors from all ends o* the world turned

to an Indian" a burning appeal written In reply to
a letter from another distinguished Indian, Taraknath
Dos, editor of a review, "'The Free Hindustan"
Tolstoy considered that evil arose in India from the fact
that, however reluctantly, the Indians were submitting
to foreign rule. He said that if the Indian people, obeying
the precepts of their ancient sages, had refused to sub¬
mit, no earthly force could have enslaved them. Tolstoy
was an advocate of passive resistance, urging that evil
should not be met by violence.
The profound inspiration and warm, benevolent tone of
Tolstoy's answers to his Indian correspondents caused a
spate of letters to pour into Yasnaya Polyana for the
rest of his life. Despite his advanced years and the
important work on which he was engaged, Tolstoy replied
regularly to these correspondents, invariably emphasizing
his respect for their country and its ancient civilization.
It was in pursuit of his widespread friendly contacts
with many representatives of India that Tolstoy began
in 1909 his correspondence with Gandhi, who played so
important a part in the public life of the Eastern peoples.
Tolstoy's ideological and artistic Influence left a deep
impression on Indian intellectuals. It did a great deal to
develop avant-garde writing in India. There is an affi¬
nity between Tolstoy and the work of Rabindranath
Tagore, Pram Chand and other eminent Indian writers.
Pram Chand translated and edited 21 folk-tales by Tol¬
stoy, whose works are among those most .widely read in
India.
Tolstoy did not correspond as frequently with represen¬
tatives of Chinese culture as with their Indian and
Japanese counterparts, but he was keenly interested in
China, and stressed in his letters that mankind's salvation
lay in the refusal to resort to violence between States, the
renunciation of the oppression and enslavement of depen¬
dent nations, and in the establishment of peace and
friendship among all peoples of the earth.
T1
olstoy's unflagging interest in the East was also
H displayed in his continual study of the philoso-
.^L. phy and literature of the Asian and African
peoples, including their epic poetry and folklore.
His attention was first drawn to the philosophical and
moral doctrines of the Orient in the early 1880's when,
having renounced the world of the rich, he was engaged
in laying the foundations of his new conception of the
world. With passionate enthusiasm he studied Confucius,
Buddha and Lao-tse, with passionate application he read
the Vedas and the Upanishads, and the works of Chi¬
nese, Persian and Arab thinkers.
What particularly impressed Tolstoy in the immense
storehouse of oriental thought was its humanitarian
ethic, its concept of the lofty mission of man. Man is
depicted as the culmination of nature. Happiness is not
to be found in wealth, nor In the exercise of authority
by one man over others, but in working for the general
good. Peace, labour and virtue are the supreme moral
values of mankind.
Discovering in the ancient doctrines of the East ideas
and principles which harmonized with his own, Tolstoy
set himself to propagating them in Russia. This led to
the publication of his anthologies, The Cycle of Reading,
Thoughts from wise men for every day, and The Path¬
way of Life, which assemble (the maxims of leading East¬
ern and Western thinkers, together with oriental pro¬
verbs, saws and legends arranged by Tolstoy himself.
Earlier, in the 1870's, wishing to make the treasures of
world folk literature accessible to Russian children, Tol¬
stoy had collected and edited with equal care a number
of Asian tales and fables and included them in his cele¬
brated Alphabet and his Russian readers. Those remark¬
able anthologies contain many examples of Indian,
Turkish, Japanese, Chinese and Arab folklore, presented
in polished literary form. The collections of oriental
tales, legends, proverbs and sayings compiled and
published by Tolstoy are among the largest and most
interesting to have appeared in Europe.
Not content with this, Tolstoy translated and published
works of oriental philosophy. A series of books on Chi¬
nese, Indian and Arab philosophy was published in Rus¬
sia under his supervision, including his own translation
of selected maxims of Lao-tse, taken froan the celebrat¬
ed Too Te King (Book of the Path ,and of Virtue).
Tolstoy's work in this field won high acclaim from
experts all over the world. "Tolstoy", wrote Romain Rol¬
land, "was the first, wide spiritual path linking all the
members of the ancient continent, from West to East."
Tolstoy was a great humanist who defended the inte¬
rests and aspirations of the masses and gave tongue to
the peoples' protest against war and subjection with a
vigour and passion never before encountered in literature.
In him the nations of Asia and Africa had a trusty friend
and champion.

WORLD LEPROSY DAY
by Raoul Follereau
I
I EPROSY is the oldest disease In the world. It appears
Mm to be as old, as man himself, and can be traced back
to the remotest ages.
In India it was known as early as 600 B.C., under the
name of Kustha. About the same time, in Persia, it was
called Pisaga. Herodotus tells us that no one with leprosy
might enter a town or have any dealings with other people,
for his disease proved that he had sinned against the sun.
Besides these taboos, he was forbidden to own... white
pigeons !
Moses, who had been an Egyptian priest, enforced the
most stringent measures against those with leprosy. They
were obliged to live apart, to veil their faces, and to warn
anyone of their presence by crying out "Unclean,
unclean!"
Even at that time, leprosy meant neglect and social
ostracism for its victim. It would be consoling to find
that the lot of the leprosy victim had improved with the
passage of the centuries. But even now, leprosy remains
one of the greatest scourges of mankind.
The statistics we have are incomplete and mostly un¬
derestimate the real situation. The number of people
with leprosy in the world today may be reckoned at
between 12 and 15 million. This means that there is one
to every 200 inhabitants, and one to every two T.B.
patients.
The highest Incidence of the disease is in Asia, in every
country of which leprosy claims its victims. Africa, has
between two-and-a-half and three million victims, while
in the South Pacific region all the islands, with the
exception of New Zealand, are contaminated. America,
too, has its sufferers mainly in the West Indies, the
Gulanas, Mexico and South America.
From time immemorial leprosy has been regarded as a
terrifying and accursed affliction, thus causing those with
it to be segregated from their fellows. At times they have
been driven from their homes and villages. I have seen
them thrown together with mental patients or else held in
what are nothing less than concentration camps, behind
barbed wire, their guards armed with machine-guns.
I have even found lepers shut up in a cemetery! Some
tribes have also been known to make them commit suicide.
hy this ostracism and cruelty? Because, until re¬
cent years, leprosy was regarded as contagious and
Incurable. It was a "danger" against which protective
measures had to be taken. The man with leprosy was a
"hopeless" case, a total loss for the tribe and the city.
Hence this "social excommunication" which made him
an outlaw and set a curse on him. Nowadays, leprolo-
glsts are unanimous in their opinion that leprosy is only
slightly contagious and can be effectively cured.
In many cases and in many countries, leprosy is not:
or has ceased to be contagious. In others, it can be
contracted only through close, and oft repeated contact.
The children of parents with leprosy are not born with the
disease. In fact, according to WHO, "the risks of
contracting leprosy by association with a leper are far
fewer than in the case of tuberculosis." There is therefore
no reason for condemning the leprosy patient in¬
discriminately to isolation, and still less for driving him
out of society.
The 1958 WHO Conference at Belo Horizonte and that
of 1959 at Brazzaville, solemnly condemned segregation
once and for all, for the following reasons:
If the diseased person fears that he will be forced
to go to hospital, he will conceal his disease;
Isolation leads to a break-up of the family;
Isolation gives rise to serious difficulties in controll¬
ing contacts;
Isolation stigmatizes the patient by delaying his
reintegration into society;
Isolation is too costly a health measure, in that it
absorbs the funds needed for the development of
up-to-date methods of combating leprosy;
Isolation helps 'to keep popular prejudices alive;
and, above all, it is utterly inhuman.
Accordingly treatment for leprosy victims should
generally be provided in the same way as for any
other kind of sick person: as an out-patient in mild cases;
and in special centres or '"sanatoria," if this is required
by the form or virulence of the disease exactly as for
tuberculosis.
This liberal, humane system of treatment which has at
times been criticized as incautious, but which recent
scientific discoveries have proved to be sound, has been
applied in recent years in the former territories of the
French Union. Two sets of figures are enough to illustrate
its scope and success. In what was formerly French
Equatorial Africa, at the end of 1951, the known number
of people with leprosy was 37,508, and the number of
patients treated was 2,268 or approximately 6%; at the
end of 1956, the known number of sufferers was 140,000,
the number of patients treated was 120,000 or 85%.
These figures reflect action going beyond the
experimental stage and are more than encouraging.
Regarding the children of leprous parents the Brazza¬
ville Conference stated that:
In countries which have set up "preventoria" for
the children of leprous parents, these establishments will
be converted as far as possible into crèches;
! It is considered dangerous to take children away
from a leprous mother from the day of their birth and
to place them in institutions. When this has been done
the result has been a high infant mortality rate and
disastrous psychological effects among those children
who survive;
It is essential not to deprive these babies of their
mothers' milk.
The Conference further stated that day pupils might
continue to attend their schools, provided they were given
regular treatment; health education should then be given
to their fellow-pupils and their families.
Lastly, congresses and conferences have formally
concluded that leprosy is a disease which can be
completely cured by sulphones, which are inexpensive and
easy to apply. The VHth International Congress of Lep-

'YOU HAVE LEPROSY', a World Health Organization doctor tells this youth from Luzon in the Philippines. But as the doctor
gives the bad news he drops a kindly hand on the youth's shoulder and tells him that a course of treatment with sulphone tablets
will cure him. Today, treatment for leprosy victims is being provided more and more in the same way as for any other sick
personas an outpatient in mild cases ; in special centres only in cases where this is required by the form orvirulence of the disease.

NO LONGER CUT OFF

the Philippines ,are able to
farm and do other work.
Attitudes towards leprosy
are beginning to change.
Those who have suffered
from the disease but who
are no longer contagious
are now being given the
chance to return to society.
nent after-effects in certain former -victims did not mean
that in these cases the disease was contagious or had not
been cured.
Leprosy sufferers should thus be treated without being
subjected to any special regulations, and, in the view of
modern medical science, most of them will be freed from
what today is no more than an ordinary disease which has
foolishly been exaggerated into a spectre of horror.
But can those with, leprosy be saved merely by curing
them? From time immemorial, the victim of the
Bacillus leprae has suffered from two afflictions: he has
leprosy, and he is a "leper."
He has leprosy. But this can be cured by present-day
science. Yet what is the use if, once healed, he still
bears the stigma of the "leper," and still remains an
outcast?
e must see to it that, as soon as the doctors have
pronounced him to be non-contagious, he should
immediately regain his place and employment in society.
There must be no question of punishing him permanently
for some inexpiable crime, of continuing to condemn him
to "perpetual leprosy."
This is the purpose of the petition which I have
addressed to the United Nations, with a view to securing
the preparation of a Charter for adoption by all civilized
countries.
It can be summed up in two points: those with leprosy
are human beings like the rest of mankind, subject to, and
protected by, the same laws; no one has the right to place
any restriction whatsoever on their freedom when they
suffer from a non-contagious form of leprosy or hold a
medical certificate stating that, after treatment, they
present no further risk of contagion.
These proposals were approved by a unanimous vote of
the French National Assembly on 25 May 1954.
A distinction must be made between the following three
categories of patients:
Those who are contagious. In their case the fullest
possible Isolation will be necessary. If this cannot be
arranged at home, they will have to be placed in a special
centre for treatment. Such a centre need not be a
hospital for leprosy patients; it can be a sanatorium, or
simply a special ward of an established city hospital.
These people are ordinary patients, who should be plac¬
ed on the same footing as any other patients temporarily
suffering from a contagious disease. And, like other
patients, they must be fully assured that their isolation
will not last a day longer than the doctor considers
necessary.
Society itself owes them fair compensation. To begin
with, they should be sure that once their health has been
restored they will be able to go back to their former jobs.
It is for the State to set an example by granting long-
term sick leave to any of its officials suffering from lep-
prosy, without letting this be any handicap to them in
their careers.
Non-contagious patients who have so far been isolated
indiscriminately. They should be free to go where they
like, but this does not mean that they should be removed
by force from where they are at present. They must be
given both the means and desire to return to society.
But they should not be forced to do so.
To give them a chance to readapt themselves, it is
both right and necessary for them to receive a financial
allowance for a period of, for example, two or three years.
The amount might be the same as what would have been
spent on them had they remained in the sanatorium.
This would mean no extra expenditure; nor should any
"economies" be made on patients who, leaving of their
own volition, will accordingly feel less apprehensive about
starting life afresh.
The crippled and maimed. Those whose faces, for
example, will permanently bear the mark of the
disease, need special homes set up in the form of small
villages where they will live together, with every measure
being taken to ease their lot and help them forget the past.
Though the damage done to them can never be repaired,
they remain none the less human beings; and society
which came too late to their aid, owes them its respect
and a friendly helping hand.
This Charter should be proclaimed by all countries
which believe in human values and pay more than lip
service to the ideal of freedom.
This was my aim in instituting the world-wide Leprosy
Day, which will be celebrated for the eighth time on 29
January 1961. Its purpose is to ensure that lepers are
treated in the same way as other sick persons, with full
respect for their freedom and dignity as human beings;
and to "cure the sound in body" of the absurd and
sometimes criminal fear which they, show in regard to
this disease and those stricken with it.
Last year, 88 countries were associated in World Lep¬
rosy Day. Let us make no mistake. The emancipation
of the victim of leprosy, who has been held in terror for
2,000 years, will go down in history as a victory comparable
to the emancipation of the slaves.

The Unesco Courler. Jonuory 1961
CHRISTIANITY &
ANTI-SEMITISM
by Father Yves Congar
Bs author of The Catholic
Church and the Race Ques¬
tion, one of the booklets in
the Unesco serles, The Race
Question and Modern Thought,
permit me to comment on a number
of points in the racism issue of The
Unesco Courier.
In his most interesting article
"A Look at Modern Anti-Semitism,"
Léon Poliakov has, in effect, once
more taken up the thesis of P. Jules
Isaac, a man whose name I have
known since childhood, for it was
from his textbooks that I learned my
history. His thesis is that a re¬
lationship exists between modern
anti-Semitism and theological anti-
Semitism which "dates back to early
Christian times."
As a historian myself, convinced
that History is a great mistress of
truth, of human culture and of
objectivity, and hence of peaceful
understanding, I think there is an
undeniable element of truth in
this thesis. In this respect, I
would attach particular import¬
ance not so much to the
theological arguments of the Fathers
of the Church and leading theo¬
logians, but to certain popular
predications such as those delivered
on the occasion of the Crusades or
auto-da-fés. A work on the auto-
da-fés in Portugal at the end of the
15th century, which I recently
examined, comes to my mind. Such
predications helped to spread a
picture of "The Jew" on which the
irrational sentiments of the broad
masses thrived.
Convent of the Dominicans, Strasbourg, France
Yet even so, from 1938 to 1943 I
was mentally in agreement with
discriminatory measures like the
numerus clausus, as it was applied
in Hungary, whose unjust and
dangerous nature I failed to un¬
derstand at the time. I have since
realized that this was inadmissible.
From talks I had with fellow prisoners
of war who were Jewish, and after
the frightful events of Auschwitz
and Bergen-Belsen, I came to see,
after 1943, that any discrimination
whatever based on ethnic or racial
considerations opened the way to the
negation of justice and love, to the
denial of human fraternity and,
eventually, step by step to actions
of the worst kind.
Out the exact nature of our
relations with "others" de¬
pends above all on a critical
examination of such general
images through which it is so easy to
build up a grotesque and even vile
picture of certain groups of people,
especially if their life apart makes
them seem foreign or mysterious.
Anti-clericalism and criticism of
monks also thrived in this fashion.
In point of fact, even when one
has not been subjected to the in¬
fluence of such images there is always
a need to reinforce the truth of one's
beliefs. Here I might use my own
experience as an example. Thank
heaven I have never been an anti-
Semite and, as far as I know, have
never injured a Jewish person in any
way. As a child I had Jewish friends
who were the children of my parents'
friends. And a generation later I see
that my own nephews have as their
friend a child who escaped the
massacre, but whose parents my
own childhood comrades never re¬
turned from the death camps.
n should like now to make five
points concerning the thesis
of Léon Poliakov (and of
Jules Isaac).
*
1. It is easy to make a collection
of texts (and of facts) concerning
Christian anti-Semitism. But facts
and texts should be considered and
understood in their proper contexts.
Originally a polemical atmosphere
prevailed. The first persecutions of
the Christians sometimes stemmed
from Jewish denunciations, in a world
in which Judaism was still proselytic
and influential. In his Verus Israel
Marcel Simon has clearly demonstrat¬
ed the responsibilities on both sides
for this struggle between Jews and
Christians during the first four
centuries of the Christian era. The
"doctrinal anti - Semitism" of the
Fathers of the Church had as its
counterpart an anti-Christianity of
the Talmud.
2. This "doctrinal anti-Semitism"
is truly doctrinal and hence religious.
It is not racist. It may have had
practical consequences similar to
those produced by pagan anti-
Semitism. But in itself it is quite
different, it seems to me. And to
come to an objective conclusion
concerning the theological, religious
and non-racist character of Chris¬
tian anti-Semitism in past centuries,
I would recall the excellent Protestant
book, Antisémitisme et Mystères
d'Israël, written in 1955 by F. Lovsky,
which neither Léon Poliakov nor Ju¬
les Isaac have taken sufficiently into
account.
3. Léon Poliakov is too experienced
a historian to believe that there was
once a Jewish people ready to mingle
with the pagan peoples, and later
with Christian populations, and that
the tragedy of the situation which
led to the Ghettos can be laid en¬
tirely at the door of Christianity.
Besides the fact that pagan anti-
Semitism existed before any Christian
anti-Semitism, Israel was inclined by
its own Internal laws that ls, by its
most noble and profound traditions
to live apart. Its uncompromising
particularism could hardly help but
raise a kind of "Jewish question."
There has also been and still Ls a
Moslem anti-Semitism as well as a
Soviet anti-Semitism which have
no connexion whatever with the
doctrinal anti-Semitism of Christians.
What Dubnov has said in his
Histoire Juive on the situation of the
Jews in the Orient, shows that in
another way, but all the same in one
form or another, the Jewish people
are the subject of discrimination in
that part of the world.
4. The "doctrinal anti-Semitism"
of the Christians was not drawn up
specifically and exclusively for the
Jews. It rests on an ensemble of
theological theses which concern
"the Others," the non-Christians, the
"heterodox," those belonging to other
religious groups and even the pagans.
Christian thought of other centuries
had drawn up on this subject a
coherent and logical collection of
theological findings which amounted
to a kind of jurisprudence. These
arguments were drawn from an
entirely objectlvist realm of thought,
inspired by the conviction that Truth
exists and that it alone has proper,
defined rights.
Today we still believe In the rights
of Truth but have a different way
of meeting its demands.
llfJ e have nowadays reached
I 'I the point where we -can
^^^ I take Into consideration the
individual viewpoint or that
of conscience. But it should not be
forgotten that the ancient theology
often laid claim to texts of the Old
Testament. The very Idea of "divine
punishment", which has led Léon
Poliakov to detect an odour of
crypto-Chrlstlanlty In Le Dernier
des Justes, because the author,
J. Schwartz-Bart, had given space to
It, is not specifically Christian, but
Biblical.
What I have just said was even
more accentuated under a Christian¬
ity in which religion and politics
existed In tight association; in which
the Kingdom of God took on the
status of a form of government, in
which, unhappily, religious or
dogmatic reproval was translated
into social or judicial measures.
5. Finally, the thesis of Jules Lsaac
and Léon Poliakov runs the risk of
showing only the tragic and un¬
pleasant side of the co-existence
between Christians and Jews which
has so often been a sorrowful one
for the latter. There is, however, all
the positive side, often brought out

CHRISTIANITY & ANTI-SEMITISM (Cont'd)
In historical studies which- I could
quote. This is manifested in atti¬
tudes, often merciful and conciliatory,
made possible by a legal status, the
overall result of which was bé¬
néficient. Chrysostom, Augustine,
Gregory the Great, Bernard and the
Popes Pius XI and XII took up the
defence of the Jews. The texts and
the acts of these last two popes are
not sufficiently well known. In 1953
I Included a short list in my booklet
and one could draw up another from
one of Mr. Pollakov's own works,
Les Juifs et le IIP Reich. Exact
history should include all this in its
balance sheet of facts and in its
appreciation of realities.
This, of course, does not mean that
there ls nothing more to be done.
Unhappily there is much to do... But
Christians are ready to learn and are
willing and able to revise their ideas
and actions. We are in full agree¬
ment with Mr. Poliakov and with
Unesco to continue the effort which
is already well under way, but still
not equal to the need.
A FEW COMMENTS
by Léon Poliakov
It was with emotion that I read
the letter of Father Congar. I should
like to say at once that with the
exception of some slight shades of
meaning I agree with the first three
points of his letter. On the fourth
point I feel obliged to disagree.
1. The situation of the Jews, as
hétérodoxes or the others in the
mediaeval world, was very special and
infinitely vulnerable. It was consider¬
ed at that time that the Jews had
condemned themselves by their own
offence to perpetual punishment
and servitude (this offence was
firstly "deicide" and secondly "im¬
penitence," that ls, their refusal to
become Christians).
2. I agree with Father Congar
when he recalls that In all centuries
there have been Christians who have
defended the Jews (although among
the great names he quotes one could
make distinctions) and I would
add that during every age there
have been reassuring examples of
friendship and understanding
between Christians and Jews; and
even between theologians and rabbis.
Nor should we forget the great
Abelard, the only theologian of his
day who absolved the Jews of all
responsibility for the Crucifixion.
To recall such facts can only serve
the cause of Judaeo-Chrlstlan friend¬
ship ; it would be false and harmful to
pretend that Jewish history has been
nothing but a Vale of Tears. It is
Important to recognize that even at
a time when ideas were very different
from those we have today and when
laws Imposed a rigorous segregation
between the followers of the two re¬
ligions, understanding and mutual
esteem were fully possible. Such
contacts no doubt enabled each side
to perceive the elements that made
up (or were missing from) the
metaphysical nature of the other.
Thus life, in its manifold and
mysterious fullness, transcended the
doctrines and the laws.
THE RACISM ISSUE
Sir,
I am cancelling my subscription to your
magazine, being a firm disbeliever in
"brotherhood" between peoples. Your
idealism is no doubt noble, but unfortu¬
nately unattainable. In my view you are
cherishing dangerous illusions at a time
when force is the only valid political argu¬
ment.
3. Morin
Lillebonne, France
Sir,
Would you please send me a copy of the
Racism issue of The Unesco Courier in
French. (We already have an entire class
subscribing to the English edition.) I con¬
sider this problem of such importance that
I would like to deal with it in two langua¬
ges with my young girl pupils.
Sister Maria Domenigo
Cloppenburg, Oldenberg
German Federal Republic
Sir,
I would like to express my appreciation
of the excellent issue of The Unesco
Courier on racism. No doubt the extrem¬
ely interesting analyses and articles will help
to combat race prejudice. I sincerely hope
that a translation of the whole issue will
soon appear in the German edition which
is now also being published. Many Ger¬
man people still have a lot to learn in this
field, not only as regards anti-Semitism
which is, at least in public, generally con¬
demned tout also in their attitude towards
Africans. I could imagine that a special
drive for this particular number, when it
appears, would allow the edition to be far
above the normal, if local Ministries and
education authorities could be induced to
get this issue for teachers, students at tea¬
chers' training colleges, adult education
organizations, etc.

Ed. note. This issue has now been pub¬
lished in our new German edition.
Sir,
May I congratulate all who were respon¬
sible for the issue dealing with the prob¬
lem of racism. It was a most impressive
treatment of a gnawing problem, and can¬
not help but make a positive impact on all
who are exposed to it. I believe it will
help dispel some of the discrimination and
prejudices, even among those of us who
call ourselves liberals.
May I be permitted, however, to com¬
ment briefly on two items in the otherwise
excellent article entitled "Race Prejudice
and Education" by Cyril Bibby.
Mr. Bibby is absolutely correct in reject¬
ing the notion of a "Jewish Race," and
suggesting that we speak of "The Jewish
Religion." However, by using the phrase
"The Jewish People" he gives credence to
the Zionist philosophy that there is an
international unity of Jews beyond their
religious beliefs. Israeli leaders constantly
make reference to "The Jewish Peoples" in
their efforts to win acceptance of I he view
that Israel is the representative and spo¬
kesman of World Jewry. The long history
of Zionism a minority movement among
Jews is replete with efforts to give the
world the impression of all Jews as a "pub¬
lic body". The much used phrase for
this purpose is "the Jewish people."
(Though some Jews through the years have
used it for strictly religious purposes, it
now is a sloganized term for Zionism.)
Further, there is an unfortunate use of
the stereotype wherein the author refers to
characteristically "Jewish gestures," "Jewish
pattern in family life," "Jewish occupations
and cultural interest." I feel sure you
will agree when we say that there are no
"Jewish occupations;" there are only occu¬
pations to which Jews may have been
drawn, because of discrimination in other
occupations. As for the concept of a
"Jewish culture," we maintain that except
for the obviously liturgical music and reli¬
gious art and literature, the culture of Jews
is a blend of the culture of the lands or
lands in which they live or have settled.
For example, there is no "Jewish culture"
for American Jews separate and apart from
what we term our American culture.

Sir,
I shall not be renewing my subscription
to your magazine. Your- revue is not unin¬
teresting, but your action is biased and art¬
fully "camouflaged." Your issue on Ra¬
cism, in particular, disgusted me. One
would think that your "brotherhood" was
only intended for Negroes and Jews. You
will end up by making people detest them.
You publish photos taken from films, yet
there is no shortage of real ones taken at
places like Oued Zom, in China, in the
Congo and other places. Reading sanc¬
timonious and hypocritical sentiments "à la
Tartuffe" has always irritated me.
Antoinette Mirande
Le Bex-d'Ytrac, France
Sir,
I have just received your issue devoted
to Racism in the world and though I
wholeheartedly approve of the condemna¬
tion of these harmful theories, I cannot
help deploring the fact that they are almost
entirely presented as a creation of the
race. When we consider this prob¬
lem we should not lose sight of the racial
intolerance shown by coloured peoples,
which white people are likely to encounter
more and more frequently in the future.
Jean-Pierre Bolzée
Liège, Belgium
Sir,
Full honours to The Unesco Courier
for its focus on racism. This is a vital
problem which we must solve if this ever
shrinking world is to live peacefully. Ra¬
cism is practised by many member states
of the U.N. even though they openly deny

it. In an official document the Australian
Government states that: "Australia does not
approve of racial discrimination policies
and no such policy exists in Australia."
But the main cause for Asian distrust for
Australia is the controversial "White Aus¬
tralia Policy." This is racism and colour
prejudice. To expand as she wishes Aus¬
tralia must have migrants to boost her
natural increase of population, but the mi¬
grants are chosen people. At the moment
thirty one different nationalities live
throughout this vast continent but they are
all from European countries. All the sin¬
cerity of Australia's efforts through the
Colombo Plan and other policies to further
the advancement of less fortunate countries
in Asia is lost by this definite taint of
racism.
This policy of racism has been criticized
by many visiting Asian leaders; it has been
regretted by many Asian students coming
to Australia under the Colombo Plan. The
greatest thing Australia could do to raise
her prestige in Asia would be the abolition
of the "White Australia Policy." At the
moment it is the greatest threat to her
economic well being and future standing in
Asian eyes.

Sir,
My heartiest congratulations on the very
fine special issue devoted to the question
of racism.
Bernard Lacache
Chairman, International League
Against Racism and anti-Semitism
Paris, France
Sir,
I read each of your issues, with the great¬
est interest. I should particularly like to
congratulate you on the magnificent issue
devoted to Racism.
Jacques Lazaras
Congres Juif Mondial
Algiers
Sir,
I always read The Unesco Courier
attentively and appreciatively. But I do
not always agree with the form of its
themes for I notice that it carefully glosses
over anything that could go against the
ultra-nationalism of colour; it does not
hesitate, following the example of the Uni¬
ted Nations, to accuse the white peoples,
the same people that the newly indepen¬
dent nations nevertheless accept as a source
of funds.
Why do you ignore the black Racism
which in the Congo provoked the hunting
of white people and horrors recalling the
time of Hitler and of Budapest?
Why dismiss (in a few lines) the Arab-
Israel conflict as being of political origin
when in fact the Jews have been for cen¬
turies past the detested pariahs of the
Arab nations?
Why pass over in silence the Racism of
the Arabs of Maghreb who refuse the Eu
ropeans of Algeria Algerians for more
than a century past on lands that Arab
laziness had transformed into desert the
right to live in freedom?
Or again why say nothing about the
positive anti-racist achievements of the
white peoples, called colonizers, who for
half a century have striven to create links
between Negroes and white men, bonds of
friendship which begin on the benches of
the same school or in the tent of the bush
doctor.
We should not forget that while it was
only last year that the Americans decided
to suppress this stupid racial discrimination,
in France Negroes have never been relegat¬
ed to special schools of forced to use "Ne¬
groes only" restaurants and buses.
L. Boyer
Saint-Hienne, France
Sir,
It is a sad commentary on our times the
so-called era of great civilization that
mankind still suffers from an abscess caus¬
ed by the blind obstinacy of those who
wish to relegate others to the status of
an inferior race, even though they are en¬
dowed with equal faculties. It would be
both naive and unjust to complacently con¬
tinue to perpetuate this myth principally
on the basis of race and the colour of a
person's skin. This attitude entirely with¬
out foundation because it is ignores any
question of human values, plumbs the very
depths of human stupidity, revealing not a
state of superiority at all, but one of moral
deficiency. None of the reasons invoked by
the supporters of this harmful ideology can
justify their action, which in any case can
only lead to the humiliation of others.
M. Bensahli
Algeria
Sir,
Congratulations on the Racism issue.
It is objective, magnificent and of burning
topical interest. We were all the more
appreciative of this number because we
have always tried to bring our pupils into
contact with children of all nations, within
the limits of our regretfully small resources.
We also welcomed this issue because follow¬
ing publication of the article about Bouba
and Jacques (See The Unesco Courier,
September 1960 an exchange of letters
between the children of Costes-Gozon in
France and those of Pitoa in the Came-
roons) we received an anonymous letter
from someone who showed scant enthu-
siam for our activities. This was perhaps
the best proof that we have not worked in
vain.
P. Cabanes
Costes-Gozon, France
Sir,
As a Frenchman from Morocco I should
like to tell you what 1 think of your issue
on Racism. On page 5 you publish a photo
(Massacre at Sharpeville) showing about
15 corpses on the ground. However,
having gone through the 1918-14 war, I
am not upset by a few drops of blood and
so I can judge things objectively. The
Afrikaancrs and their racism certainly bear
some responsibility for these corpses. But
you are lacking in objectivity. Alongside
you should have published several photos
of the former Belgian Congo.
In support of your thesis you evoke the
terrible fate of the Jews during the Second
World War. But the Jews were not the
only victims of the Nazis. This terrible
persecution was chiefly a racial one, but
the truth is certainly less clearly apparent.
Collective massacres are one of the out¬
comes of war. In the 17th Century the
Germanic populations were decimated by
the Thirty Years War, the Palatinate raïed
by the army of Turenne; in the I9ih Cen¬
tury, there was the brutal behaviour of the
Napoleonic armies, the British prison ships,
the fate of Dupont's troops in the Balearic
Isles. That is war, and it is war that must
be destroyed.
The Jews are an admirable people. For
over 2,000 years they have remained Jew-
ish and will do so for many years to
come. But they are an impossible people
to assimilate. It is quite normal for Jewish
people, refugees in France, to remain' Jew¬
ish. But in that case they should not
concern themselves with the affairs of the
country that has harboured them. This is
the chief grievance against them.
Colonialism can claim to have done many
positive things. You must already have
gathered that 1 am a colonialist 1 have
been one for the past 30 years. Having
been a teacher for 3 1 years, I have had
coloured children in my class. I have liked
them and I have done what I could for
them.
M. Mallionime
Marrakech, Morocco
Sir,
Certain areas like those of the industrial
north of France are ripe for the introduction
of segregation. The victim: the North
African. The reason: his own fault. The
solution: his conversion from the Islamic to
the Catholic faith.
Let me explain. In 1940 I was horrified
by Racism. Like all French people I was
well disposed towards coloured people and
was a free thinker besides. However
through my experiences with Arab or Ka¬
byle workers and shopkeepers, I have de¬
cided that it is best to keep clear of them,
to lock one's door against them, to keep
one's dealings with them on a polite but
restricted basis and to avoid cither hiring
them or working with them.
What have we found out through observ¬
ing and living with these people .whom wc
should have liked to treat as fellow coun¬
trymen and brothers? They are conceited
people, vain, unstable, inefficient, lazy, sy¬
philitic, tubercular, argumentative, dishon¬
est, weak and vindictive. Not all of them
are as I have described and they do not
all suffer from a combination of these
faults, but each of them carries within him
at least one of these vices, always ready to
spring to the surface.

FiROST-PROOF SEEDS : Scientists
at the Timiriaziev Agricultural Academy in
the Soviet Union have discovered how to
make seeds "frost-proof". They treat
them with a solution of mineral and orga¬
nic fertilizer which solidifies and forms a
porous "envelope" around each grain.
With this protection, which allows air and
water to penetrate, the seeds can be sown
in autumn instead of in spring, and during
the first warm days they start to germinate
and grow very quickly. Crops of cabba¬
ges, onions and other vegetables grown
from seeds treated in this way showed 30
to 50 per cent increases.
WMO'S 10TH BHtTHDAY: The
World Meteorological Organization
(WMO), which last year celebrated the
10th anniversary of its establishment as
an agency of the United Nations, has
increased its membership during that
time from 30 to 100 countries. Its
tradition of international collaboration
in the field of meteorology, however,
dates back to 1878 when the Interna¬
tional Meteorological Organization was
set up as a non-governmental body.'
SCHOOL - FORESTS :
Hundreds of "school forests" have been
created in the Federal Republic of Ger¬
many to teach children how trees grow
and how they should be cared for. About
350 such forests now exist in the Rhine-
land and Northern Westphalia, many of
them being planted by schoolchildren under
the guidance of teachers or forest wardens,
and often with seedlings grown in school
nurseries. Sites chosen for tree-planting
are bare slopes badly in need of protec¬
tion from erosion. In other regions of Ger¬
many, sections of existing forests are main¬
tained by schoolchildren.
takes 70 minutes to play and when it has
finished instructions are given to the listen¬
er telling him how to move on to the next
track. Because of its operational simpli¬
city, the machine will be particularly valu¬
able to elderly blind people who usually
find the gadgets of the average tape rec¬
order too intricate.
SCIENCE AND THE HUMAN
BRAIN: Today scientists are beginning
to build up a coherent picture of brain
function in terms of the physical and
chemical processes that underly the co¬
operative actions of the ten thousand
million nerve-cells in the human brain.
They are using information from ani¬
mal experiments, clinical problems and
dramatic developments in physics, che¬
mistry and mathematics. But the fan¬
tastic complexity of these problems
calls for action by a flexible, world¬
wide network of scientific intercom¬
munication and co-operation. To meet
this need an International Brain Re¬
search organization, whose aim is to
co-ordinate result? from scientific
Studie? of the brain and to facilitate
training and research, was recently
formed in Paris at a meeting convened
on behalf of Unesco by the Council of
International Organizations of the Medi¬
cal Sciences.
w,ATCHDOG WEATHER SHIPS:
Nine people were rescued from the sea
during 1959 by weather ships stationed in
the North Atlantic, according to a recent
report of the International Civil Aviation
Organization (ICAO), an agency of the
United Nations. The ships also responded
to 47 appeals for medical assistance,
received 10 distress signals from aircraft
and 574 from ships at sea.
ALLING THE FISH ROLL : Every
kind and shape of fish found in Mediter¬
ranean waters, from the tasty sole to the
sea horse, are listed in a catalogue recently
issued by the U.N. Food and Agriculture
Organization (FAO). The aim is to stan¬
dardize the names of fish so that the 12
countries in the FAO's General Fisheries
Council of the Mediterranean can compare
fishery statistics. The book lists 18 kinds
of rays from "guitar fish" to "devil fish"
and 28 types of shark, from "Darkie Char¬
lie" to the six-gilled shark.
BLIND ESPERANTISTS: An inter¬
national Esperantists meeting of an
unusual kind was held recently in Brus¬
sels; the 75 participants, .teachers, stu¬
dents, musicians, masseurs and others
were all blind. They came from Fin¬
land, France, Germany, Italy, Spain,
Norway, the United Kingdom and
Yugoslavia.

ORIENT ON THE SCREEN: New
countries and old civilizations whole
new regions of thought, feeling and
action are today being revealed to the
rest of the world by the cinema which
explores these new worlds and publi¬
kes its findings in vivid pictures and
sounds. To act as a guide to Asia
through the cinema screen, a survey of
films produced in the countries of the
Orient has been made by the British
Film Institute at the request of Unesco
as a contribution to its Major Project
on the Mutual Appreciation of Eastern
and Western Cultural Values. Entitled
"Orient: A Survey of Films Produced
in Countries of Arab and Asian Cul¬
ture", it deals both with feature and
documentary and short films.
A NEW "TALKING BOOK" machine
for blind people which gives 20 hours
playing time has been developed. A tape
recorder of simple design, it uses half-inch
tape carrying 18 tracks on it. Each track
ALEXANDRE LEVENTIS
The Unesco Courier regrets
to announce the death, at 56,
of Mr Alexandre Leveniis,
Assistant Editor. Born in
France in 1904, Mr Leventis
came to Unesco in 1951 after
many years of experience in
magazine editing and produc¬
tion in France. For eight years
he was Associate Editor, in
charge of the French edition
of The Unesco Courier. He
was named Assistant Editor
for all language editions in
1959. His death represents a
deep loss to the magazine and
to Unesco itself.

¡ITORS to an atomic energy exhibition in Paris listen to
varying intensity of clicks given off by a Geiger counter as it
passes over a special table composed of different kinds of metals,
With the world changing at a bewilderingly rapid pace a new
approach to theory and practice in education for adults has
become a necessity in almost every field of life, from house¬
keeping to atomic physics. The famous anthropologist, Margaret
"lead, takes up this important question in the article on page 4.
