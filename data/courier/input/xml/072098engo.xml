REVISING their notes in a bomb-damaged lecture hall at the Uni-versity of Vienna, these two medical students symbolize the post-
war difficulties faced by this and many other universities. Even
where classroom walls have been rebuilt or new roofs put over labo-
ratories, much missing or out-dated equipment remains to be re-
placed. Libraries too must be restocked, but many institutions cannot
today afford the foreign exchange to buy books from abroad.
In countries. set back by human conflict and in others left behind by
human progress, devoted men and women are striving to restore or to
create the facilities required for training aoctors, scholars, trusts any
technicians whose skills and creative powers are essential to world
development and human well-being.
In other countries favoured by progress or spared by war, people
ask,"What can we do to help ?" Unesco has answered this question
by launching a programme that enables goodwill to be transformed
into practical aid ; through which men, women and children can make
a direct, personal contribution to the cause of international under-
standing. For a report on this new programme-the UNESCO GIFT
COUPON PLAN-see pages 6 and 7 of this issue.

UNESCO COURIER-Page 2 MARCH 1951
. ain international advisory and
information service for na-
tions carrying on campaigns
against illiteracy and low living
standards has now been put into
operation by Unesco. The recent
opening of this"associated pro-
jects system", as it is termed,
places on a formal basis the assis-
tance which the organization has
been rendering agencies and pro-
grammes dealing in fundamental
education over past years.
Fundamental education pro-
grammes in seven countries of
Asia, Latin America and Africa are
now recognized as"associated pro-
jects". As such, they are to
receive assistance from Unesco in
three forms.
Firstly, the organization will
supply them with documentation
on most recent developments in
their fields-an important service
for educators who must often work
in isolated regions.
Secondly, Unesco has opened an
enquiry service to work on any
problems they encounter in their
own work. And, thirdly, six Unesco
field advisers are available for
service in projects requesting their
help, for periods up to six months.
One of the most important
aspects of the system is its"two-
way"flow of knowledge. It is
expected that data furnished by
educators in the field will be of
extreme importance in seeking the
answers to such fundamental
education problems as teaching
literacy in countries where peoples
speak a vernacular often complete-
ly different from the official lan-
guage taught in schools.
Better W"ys 01 Lile
A AGENCIES and programmeswhich were the first to be
included in the associated pro-
jects system emphasise its already
wide scope.
In the Union of South Africa for
example, there is the Division of

This division, which has been

increasing food production, such
as irrigation, crop rotation and
terracing.
India is represented so far by the
Delhi State Pilot Project in Adult
Education. Here, an Indian state
has begun the task of improving
living conditions in all 305 of its
villages by training a corps of 250
teachers to begin teaching approxi-
mately 125, 000 illiterates. The
teachers, drawn from the villages
themselves, are being trained at a
college where surrounding villages
are used for field work. Unesco
has already provided aid for the
programme.
In the Philippines, the agency
concerned is the National Federa-
tion of Parent Teachers Associa-
tions. The Federation is conduc-
ting literacy classes for some 10, 000
pupils and, at the same time, it
is striving to introduce better
facilities for health, sanitation and
recreation in rural villages.
A V øriety of WeøpoDs
TD RAZIL'S nation-wide adult edu-cation campaign is also inclu-
ded. This campaign is attacking
adult illiteracy with a variety of
weapons-literacy classes, radio
programmes, portable film projec-
tors (there are 1, 600 of these in
operation) and mobile libraries
mounted on motor vans.
Another Latin American project
is that of Viani in Colombia,
which already has received the
services of Unesco advisers. At
Viani, education is being put to
work to find solutions to the pro-
blems of farming on mountainous
land subject to erosion
In Colombia's neighbouring state,
Ecuador, the rural cultural exten-
sion service, organized in April,
1950, is also included. Here, again,
mobile missions are being used to
b r i n g educational facilities to
regions with insufficient schools,
always driving home the benefits
the rural dweller will derive from
his new knowledge in his daily life.
Finally, there is the night school
programme of the Dominican
Republic, which is aimed mainly at
reaching adult illiterates in towns
and cities.
These programmes are only a
beginning. At present, there are
75 more requests for inclusion in
the"associated projects"system
on hand and Unesco is in a posi-
tion to service up to 100 projects
this year. It has been pointed out,
however, that requests for inclu-
sion must be received by April 15,
if the project is to be considered
under the 1951 programme.

POLITICAL SCIENCE TO-DAY
Three years of painstaking
research, analysis of surveys, dis-
cussions and meetings with social
scientists from almost every region
in the world have resulted in pu-
blication by Unesco of one. of the
most comprehensive studies in the
field of social science :"Contem-
porary Political Science-".
The 48 essays and surveys in
this volume are grouped according
to their content and deal with
methodological questions, general
reports of political science works
in different countries, studies of
literature devoted to a single poli-
tical theory, surveys of writing on
particular branches of research.
Several essays on the teaching of
polit. ical science in universities are
also included.

sums up exactly what educators
hope to achieve with radio in adult
education. A recently-issued
Unesco publication entitled"Radio
in Fundamental Education"descri-
bes how radio techniques have
been adapted to meet varying con-
ditions in 16 under-developed areas
of the world. Sample scripts are

WELSH SHARE IN STRIJGGLE
FOR HIJMAN RIGHTS SHOWN
BY IRA VELlING EXHIBIT
THE historical struggle of the
people of Wales for human
rights is the them an
exhibit which will be part of
the Welsh contribution to the
Festival of Britain opening this
May.
The exhibition, which will tour
major Welsh cities during the
Festival, was organized by the
Welsh Committee of the United
Kingdom National Commission for
Unesco and was recently inaugu-
rated at the Temple of Peace in
Cardiff.
The first section of the exhi-
bition shows the early history of
Wales as a small nation struggling
against internal difficulties and
external threats. The distinct-
ive form of Celtic Christianity
emerges in photographs and mod-
els of Welsh cathedrals, churches
and monasteries, and visitors are
shown how humane Christian
values influenced peoples'lives.
It also shows how with the spread
of mediaeval culture came the
writing down of laws, the growth
of Welsh scholarship and the par-
ticipation of Wales in the pattern
of Western European culture.
Equality Before The Law
THE next section describes so-
) cial conditions existing in
16t Century Wales, at the
time of the political union with
England. Starting with the strug-
gle of men to establish their rights
as persons before the law, which
lead to the passing of the Habeas
Corpus Act, it traces the history of
this fight to the 18th Century and
the declaration of the Rights of
Man in France and America. The
original draft of the Declaration
of 1789 has been loand to the exhi-
bition by the French Government.
Through the work of Welshmen
like David Williams and Riahard
Price came recognition of the
principle that man has rights not
as a citizen of a certain country
but as a member of the human
family. The section ends with
illustrations of the fight for free-
dom of speech and association,
and the part played by such men
as Robert Owen.
Freedom 01 Religion
SECTION on religious tole-
rance traces the stages in the
battle against religious dis-
crimination, starting with the early
Roman Catholic and Protestant
martyrs of Wales, illustrating the
use of the Welsh language in reli-
gion, the growth of Non-Con-
formity in Wales and the 19th
Century struggle for Roman Cath-
olic emancipation.
World events are dealt with in
another section devoted to the
abolition of slavery, which tells
the story of the negro slaves and
the campaigns waged by Wilber-
force and Abraham Lincoln. This
is related to labour conditions in
Wales at the time-the long
working days, the use of children
and women in coalmines, quarries
and iron foundries under degrad-
ing conditions. Examples are
also given of primitive prison
conditions in the 19th Century.
Bigh. t To EdlU ! øtion.
TiE section on education illus-
) trates the work of the Welsh
pioneers. The old monitorial
schools and early teaching me-
thods are compared with photo-
graphs of modern schools, and the
work of notable institutions in
Welsh educational life to-day is
described.
The last section of the exhibi-
tion shows the effects of intole-
rance and persecution in modern
times, and traces the steps leading
to the acceptance by 48 nations of
the Universal Declaration of
Human Rights jus. t over two years
ago.
Welsh educational authorities
have decided to use the material
assembled for the exhibit to make
film strips suitable for schools, and
to publish an illustrated hand-
book which will tell the story of
the growth in Wales of the prin-
ciples enshrined in the Declaration
of 1948.

TilE death of André Gide on
February 19, at the age of 82,
has robbed world literature
of one of its most distinguish-
ed contemporary contributors.
Wortd-wide recognition of his
works was expressed not long agu
through the award of the nobel
prize. More recent ty, Paris paid
tribute to the great writer when
the presentation of his"Caves du
Vatican"was given at Ihe Comedie-
Francaise.
Sixty years ago, Gide's lirst books
revealed to a discerning few, the
restless searching of a mind that
was to travel along many roads and
absorb the most varied experiences.
From his stimulating travels 111
North Africa he drew inspiration
for his 'NOURRITL'RES TERRES-
TRES" (1897), followed by.'L'Il\II ()-
RAUSTE" (1902) and"LE RETOOL'R HE
L'EKFAKT PRODtGUE" (1903). His
unorthodox ideas stimulated many
young artists at the beginning of
the century, and two movements in
particular which were to bring new
life both to literature and the
theatre ; the.'NOUVELLE REVVE
FRA1\ÇAISE", launched in 1909, and
Jacques Copeau's Vieux-Colombier.
After the first world war, Gide
began to study social problems.
The travel diaries written in 1\J2ï
from material gathered during his
travels in the Congo and Chad,
created a stir because of his
outspoken condemnation of certain
abuses of that period. In 1936, he
published two books on his expe-
riences in SovIet Russia-"RE-
TOUR DE L'U. R. S. S." and.'RETOV-
GHES A MON RETOUR"-both of
which inspired widespread contro-
versy.
Gide strove endlessly to preserve
the purity of the French language,
but his ideas and philosophy were
constantly enriched by contact with
the works of foreign authors. He
was proud to have introduced
Kierkegaard to French readers. In
addition to a voluminous output of
creative writing, he wrote commen-
taries on Dostoievsky and Oscar
Wilde, and translated Rilke, Shakes-
peare. Conrad, Blake, \Vhi tllHlII
fagore and Kafka.
From the"Journal", begun in
J RR9 to his latest works, the
writings of André Gide were a
mirror of the constantly changing
values of man's social and moral
evolution during these sixty odd
years.
At the Nobel prize-giving cere-
mony on December 10, 194ì, M. Os-
terling, permanent secretary to the
Swedish Academy of Literature,
described the personality of this
"much discussed writer"in these
words :
"A 4. t'el1J significant period in
Europa's spiritual histol1J is reflect-
ed in his u : orks. More than any of
his contem. poraries, he was a man
of contrast, a Proteus whose ideas
and op. i'Q-ions were in a continual
state of flux, Hence, his writings
are like an unintc1'TUpted dialogue
in which faith 1cages a ceaseless
U'a}'against doubt, ascetism against
an abundant love of life, discipline
against a deep urge for liberty...
"... Gide comes f/"Om a Protestant
family, and although he rerolted
against his Puritan upbringing, he
/M reMtMcd aH A <t/< ? t ? t coM «'fhas remained all his life in cont'lct
u : ith the fundamental problems oí
j'eli (lion and at times, he has been
able to express with a rare purity
the message of Christian lo') e...
"lfis"immo/'Qlism", so fl'equcli't :'
ly misunderstood by his critics is
in reality no more than the
expression of his fervent desil'c for
freedom from any restraint of
conscience...
"His philosophy is u ceaseless
search fOl'"the new". He wants to
awaken and instil mew ideas, to set
new problems. Above all, tlw
effeet is to challenge his readers to
be w ! l o/e ! leul'fed supporters or
opponents of his ideas. This is
t ! le 1$1'1.'/' (' ( of his yreat1ll'ss."
ASTANDARDIZED Braille al-phabet to serve five million
blind persons in the Middle
East, India, South-east Asia and
Africa has been agreed upon at a
Unesco Conference just concluded
in Beirut, Lebanon.
The alphabet, which was deve-
loped by delegates, some of them
blind, of eleven nations, is desi-
gned to replace more than twenty
local Braille scripts now in use
in these regions. It closely follows
the script which was worked out
by Louis Braille in 1829. a system
of 64 combinations of raised dots.
The enlarged basic alphabet
agreed upon at Beirut uses the
original Braille symbols for cor-
responding sounds in Asian and
African languages, but adds signs
for, extra letter-sounds in such
languages as Arabic, Hindustani
and Malay. In Asia it will cover
all Braille writing with the
exception of the ideographic lan-
guages used in China, Korea,
Indo-China and Japan.
One of the effects of this
agreement will be to increase the
amount of literature available to
blind readers in these areas,
according to Sir Clutha Macken-
zie, Unesco's Braille consultant.
Sir Clutha, a New Zealander who
was blinded in the GaIIipoli
campaign of World War I, ex-
plained that previously publishers
were reluctant to produce books
in local Braille scripts which
could reach only a limited au-
dience.
The Beirut conference, whose
decisions are subject to final
ratification by the Governments
represented, follows nearly 18
months of discussions and prepa-
ratory work by Unesco with the
object of creating a world alpha-
bet in Braille for blind readers in
all languages. The eleven na-
tions taking part in it were :
Ceylon, Egypt, French North
Africa, Hashemite Jordan, India,
Iraq, Lebanon, Malaya, Pakistan,
Persia and Syria.
Another conference will be held
later this year to iron out local
differences in the Braille scripts
used by Spanish-speaking coun-
tries.

UNESCO COURIER-Page of MARCH 1951
IN a tiny Italian village, soobscure that it is not even
listed in one standard Italian
atlas, a country schoolteacher has
developed the native capacity for
artistic expression among. the
children of peasants to so high a
degree as to interest the educators
of many countries. Their interest
is not limited to the artistic
productions of the children, though
these are in some cases remarkable,
for Maria Maltoni has used art
primarily to encourage the total
development of her pupils, to help
make them good citizens and
self-confident, well-adjusted adults.
Signora Maltoni, a gracious
white-haired woman, has been
teaching the peasant children of
the Tuscany village of San Gersole
for some twenty years, with an
inspired disregard for conventional
teaching methods.
Although it is only a few miles
from Florence, that great art
centre that still lives in the
glorious past of the Renaissance,
San Gersole is far removed from
the sophistication of the Florentine
civilization.
An exhibition held in Milan
recently of the drawings and
diaries of Signora Maltoni's pupils,
none of whom is over 12 years of
age, drew wide attention in a
country where artistic talent is
taken almost for granted. These
drawings and diaries were compiled
into a book, edited by Signora
Máltoni,"I Diarl di San Gersole"
(Casa Editrice,"11 Libre"Florence
1949), that has received such
acclaim by educators and peda-
gogues that it is being translated
into many languages.
Books Have Their Place
SIGNORA Maltoni has useddrawings, not as an end in
itself, but as a means to the
self-development of her pupils.
She believes that education which
depends almost wholly on book-
learning fails in its purpose, that
an instructor must lead his pupils
on to the path of a true knowledge
of himself, of his abilities, and the
best use of them.
covering largely through the
medium of drawing.
In this ; combined þrocess of
observation and expression, the
children also experience what has
been called the divine discontept
of creative workers. They must
learn more, not on orders of a
task-master, abut because their
own drive for learning has been
released. Thus they come to their
books with passion and to their
teacher as a kindly guide.

The spontaneous tdescription of

children have set forth from their
own knowledge.

example, the children begin by
observing the phenomena around
them-the action of a see-saw,
the formation of a flower. Search-

them begins with discovery. When
a child discovers something, he has
an impulse to share it with others

about them, their minds and
surroundings ; and also make it
possible for me to influence them
in their jamily situation. Thus
educational activity'can be carried
out tactfully on the basis of the
precise facts rather than that of
general theories. Both drawing
and composition are effective
means of expression that permit
me, among other things, to learn
the nature of individual characters
and the degree of mental develop-
ment in every phase of its forma-
tion. By means of drawing, I am
able to teach precision and sureness
of thought, hand and eye."
Learning is more of a game than
a task in Maria Maltoni's one-room
schoolhouse. Situated upstairs in
her own home, the room is bright
and cheerful, its shelves laden with
books and children's classics, its
walls covered With her pupil's
drawings.
No Rigid Sclaedule
DESPITE her preoccupation withart, other subjects are not
neglected in her programme.
History, as she teaches it, becomes
a fascinating story. Her teaching
of the classics has made them alive
and popular. Despite her scorn
for standard textbooks, she uses
them when necessary. There is no
rigid schedule in her school day.
Each pupil pursues his individual
tasks, undisturbed by his comrades.
While one is occupied drawing
from live models such as insects or
plants (the children are taught
that all living creatures must later
be released to freedom), another
will be intent upon writing his
observations and thoughts of the
previous day ; while still another is
reciting poetry.
This concept of education which
stresses the moulding of individual
character, as opposed to that based
upon a conglomerate accumulation
of bits of knowledge, has long since
been adopted in the most advanced
schools of great urban centres.
Signora Maltoni has proved that it
is workable in the villages of the
world, even in poor ones where the
schooling period is limited. She is
convinced that it is the only system
whereby peasant children, whose
average formal schooling is res-
tricted to five years, can achieve a
foundation of learning, and a
lasting love for"education"as a
part of their lives.
UNESCO RESEARCH MISSION
STUDIES EDUCATION NEEDS
OF NEAR EAST VILLAGES
Do, harold B. Alien, Director o/Education oj the N ar East
Foundation in New York, has been
appointed leader oj an Unesco mission
now conducting research in three
villages-two in Egypt and one in
Iraq-to develop simple textbooks
and other reading matter, films, film-
strips and other educational materials
for literacy trainmg in Arabic-speak-
ing countries.
Dr. Allen will head an international
mission whose members also include
Iraqi and Egyptian educators and a
representative of the World Health
Organization. The main objective is
to help literacy teachers increase their
stock of Arabic materials for teaching
illiterates and improve these materials
by the introduction of new techniques
and methods.
New reading materials must be pro-
duced on the basis of a simple voca-
bulary and simple construction and
must be such as to arouse the interest,
and satisJY the curiosity and need of
the reader.
The mission to Egypt and Iraq is
co-operating with campaigns already
begun by the governments of these
two countries to raise living standards.

International Team Sets Up Work Camp
For Assams Educational Reconstruction
With Aid From
On August 15 last, the worst earthquake of modern times ravaged
the province of Assam in north east Indian, Earth tremors and the
floods that followed caused tremendous damage to homes, schools
and means of communication.
As a token of sympathy for the plight of Assam's earthquake victims,
Unesco's Executive Board voted S15, 000 for educational relief assistance.
Two-thirds of this sum is intended for the relief fund of the Governor
of Assam, earmarked for textbooks and other school supplies. The
remaining 85, 000 is being used by the Service Civil International Organ-
ization to help in the organization of voluntary work camps for the repair
of damaged schools and educational buildings in the devastated area.
The aims and work of the Service Civil International, and in particular
the efforts now being made by one of its international teams of volun-
teers to aid the rehabilitation programme in Assam, are described in
the following article.
L A,. ; T 111llnth, <I lIlitltlle-<lgetl
building worker named Leon
Bensimon left his home in
Morocco to take up a new job
6, 000 miles away in north east In-
dia. As a member of the Service
Civil International organization,
Bensimon had already put his
experience as a worker in reinfor-
ced concrete to use at work camps
in France and Switzerland, but the
job awaiting him in India is undou-
btedly the biggest he has helped
to tackle so far.
When he arrives in the hill
country of Assam, he will join a
Service Civil International team
which has already begun helping
in the reconstruction of homes
and schools damaged by the devas-
tating earthquake which occurred
there last August.
Like Léon Bensimon, other volunteers
are due to leave different parts of
Europe for Assam shortly, to join the
international team which already in-
cludes a Swiss, a Dane, an American,
and two British as well as Assamese
members.
The task facing the authorities in
Assam, with whom the team is co-
operating, is a formidable one. When
the earthquake occurred on August 15,
hills crumbled, and giant boulders
crashed down slopes carrying away
houses and blocking roads. RIverbeds
heaved up and rivers changed their
courses.
For two or three days, the river Su-
bansiri was blocked by boulders high
up in the mountains. \\'hen the rocks
gave way, a great wall of water swept
down the river, flooding the region of
North Lakhimpur. Thousands of people
In the low-lying areas were caught by
the flood, and their houses were wash-
ed away.
Educational Losses
M AXY educational institutions weredamaged r destroyed. Dr. A.
Wolsky, Principal Scientific Of-
ficer of Unesco's Science Co-operation
Office for South Asia, in Delhi, reported
after visiting the area that he had per-
sonally seen between 40 and 50 damag-
ed schools, cultural and religious in-
stitutions.
For several flays after the earth-
quake communications were comple-
tely cut with the rest of India. Gra-
dually, relief supplies began to arrive
and the Indian Government, together
with relief organizations, began to dis-
tribute food, milk, clothing and tools.
At that time, a small team of Euro-
pean Service Civil International volun-
teers was working in another part of
India. Its members were later sent up
to Assam where they at first assisted
with the emergency relief.
Today, they have begun work on two
reconstruction projects near PathaH-
pam, where a relief camp of bamboo
huts and tents has been established for
homeless people.
The first work camp project is the
construction of a primary school in a
newly opened reserve forest about three
miles from the camp. As villagers are
re-settling the area, a school building
is badly needed.
A second project, in the same area,
will provide a home for widows and
orphans at present living in the tem-
porary camp. Plans provide for a per-
manent centre to include living quar-
ters, a dispensary, an Office, a school,
a workshop, kitchens and bathrooms. A
third will probably be the rebuilding of
the Girls High School at Lakhimpur,
some 25 miles to the South West, which
was completely destroyed.
Working Against Time
'T* HE urgency of reconstruction tasksin northern Assam is increased
by the approach of the monsoon
which is due in March. With the huge
displacements of land caused by the
earthquake, fresh landslides may be
started by the rains and other commu-
nities endangered. Villages have had
to be moved from the plains to new
areas on higher round where sites
must be cleared m the forests and
construction begun as rapidly as pos-
sible.
The Service Civil International team
which is cho-operating in this work, Is
now being joined by Indian volunteers,
both from Assam and other parts of
the country.
This vital task in Assam provides the
Service Civil International with a new
opportunity for furthering jts primary
arm-the aim of all international work
camp organizations-which is to create
goodwill between peoples through the
medium of voluntary manual work.
The Service was founded on this basis
soon after the First World War. when
French and German volunteers and
other nationals worked together two re-
house peasants in the district of Ver-
dun. As the idea spread, camps were
set up in Switzerland, France, England,
Norway and other countries to help the
victims of disasters. TheSccon (t\\orId
War limited work camp activities, but
since 1945 the movement has expanded
rapidly.
"Education For Peace"
THE guiding spirit for such activitieswas recently expressed by the
Organization's Joint International
Secretary in a letter to Unesco's Re-
construction Service. She wrote :"2 ? e-
sides the contributions which these
camps can make to the material rehabi-
lita/ion Qf Assam, tee believe they have
another value, more difficult to define
and to assess...
"The small S. C./. team which hats
heen working in India since February
1950 has already had a number of
I ndian volunteers working with it ; all...
have stressed the same two ideas : first
the wlue to them personally of this new
experience of voluntary manual work
undertaken in a spirit of disinterested
setrice together u ; ith men and women
uf other nationalities, other creeds ; and
secondly, the effect that the presence
and the work of the team had on the
people among whom they were work-
ing, the new sense of a human solidarity
wllich has no regard fOI'differences of
race, nationality religious or political
creeds, profession or social class.
"It is because tve are convinced that
lCork camps can have a very real edu-
calionalva/ue and that they can be a
) Josìtive and effective'education for
peace'that we are particularly happy
to have the support of Unesco for the
u'ork camps in Assam."

Unesco's Gift Coupon Plan-A Bridge
Peoples-Successfully Launched in
TEACHERS SPEAK... Professor Beatrice Hyslop, (left) Chairman of the Committee
on Educational Reconstruction, Hunter College Chapter of the American Association
of University Professors, receives Gift Coupons from a Unesco Reconstruction liaison
officer. The Hunter College Chapter sent these coupons-the first to go abroad-to
the University of Vienna.
AN oblong piece of red and green paper, with the serial number,A-00001, was airmailed recently from New York to Sardinia, Italy.
Symbolically, it marked the opening of a new bridge designed
to span the gap between the world's generosity and the world's need.
This initial"bridge crossing"took place when the first national, campaign to put the new Unesco Gift Coupon Plan into effect was
launched in the United States. Unesco Gift Coupon Number One,
purchased as a token by a staff member, went to Father Solina's Boys'
Town, on the island of Sardinia, and one of the best known of Italy's
children's communities. The unusual"currency"will enable the war-
orphaned young citizens to buy $10 worth of books, laboratory appa-
ratus or other much needed school equipment.
The"generosity"approach to the new bridge has been opened
to all organized groups who are prepared to share in international
educational assistance. : : Such groups
will become the medium through which
many people, young and old, will be
able to make their personal contribu-
tions to Unesco assistance projects.
The bridge itself is'''constructed''of
two simple elements : a Gift Stamp and
a Gift Coupon. Gift Stamps, printed
in small denominations-such as
25 cents in the United States-are
issued in booklets containing 40 red,
perforated stamps. Individual Stamps
are sold by organizations to members,
friends and neighbours. Organizations
then convert the proceeds from each
booklet into a Gift Coupon of equal
value.
Gift Coupons, in denominations of
$10-or the equivalent in other cur-
rencies-are a special kind of interna-
tional"cheque"or money-order. They
can be used instead of scarce"hard"
currency to pay for urgently needed
materials and equipment of an educa-
tional, scientific or cultural type by
placing orders with authorized suppliers
in any of a dozen countries.
same value. The group forwards
the Coupons directly to the person,
group or institution that it has selected
from Unesco's lists. The recipient then
purchases the needed equipment.
Partners'JI Aid
IN the United States, voluntary groupsand organizations establish contact
with the Unesco Gift Coupon Office in
the new United Nations building on the
Manhattan bank of New York's"East
River. An important aspect of the plan
is the provision by Unesco of informa-
tion on special needs in the general field
of education. In thus pinpointing their
objective, groups become active partners
in a Unesco assistance project and
thereby help to educate members and
friends in the purposes of the United
Nations and Unesco.
Once a particular group sells its
consignment of Gift Stamps, it sex. us

To Do A U. N. job
THE national campaign to enlistAmerican generosity in Unesco's
programme of educational rehabilitation
by means of the Gift Coupon Plan,.'got
off to a fine start,"according to Dr. Lu-
ther Evans, head of the United States
Library of Congress, and member of
the Executive Board of Unesco.
"The programme is, in my view,"
said Dr. Evans,"one of the most prac-
tica ! and workabLe plans yet devised to
bring the man in the street right into
the work of a United Nations agency.
It is simple in its conception and in its
operation."It makes me reaHy proud
that the United States is the pioneer
country in undertaking the plain".
"For Americans, I think the Gift
Coupon is a wonderfuL opportunity,
not just to send gifts to war-torn
and under-priHeged countries", said
Dr. Evans,"but to do it in a way that
brings people together across oceans
and frontiers to do a United Nationsjúb

This kind of deficiency goes on right
up to the university and research levels.
"But now, by means of the Gift
Coupons, we can all help. Abot : e all,
it is the personal contact made pos-
sible by the Plan, which is so important.
There are certainly millions of persons
in the United States who want to help
others in a personal way-it is what
one might call international goodwill on
the individual level as distinct from the
government level. And, from my talks
on the subject with my fellow members
of Unesco's Executive Board, I know
there is a good deal of interest in the
plan on the part of other Ttations."
New York to Vienna
THE honour of selling th first GiftStamps in the United States and
sending the first Coupons abroad went
to the Hunter College Chapter of the
American Association of University
Professors. Ten $10 Coupons were
addressed to Dr. Franz Faltis, of the
Pharmaceutical and Chemical Institute
of the University of Vienna. In a letter
accompanying the $100 worth of
negotiable Coupons, Miss Beatrice
Hyslop, of the Hunter Col-
lege Chapter, wrote :
"We are glad that Unesco
has provided us with a way
to help professional people
secure much needed equip-
ment without having tc
purchase and ship it our-
selves. You have listed
laboratory glassware as a
priority need with Unesco.
We would be more than
willing for you to use the
Coupons for such a purpose.
"It would give us added
pleasure if you would, when acknow-
ledging receipt of the Coupons, teU us

tao'build peace in the minds of men'.
We teachers have great responsibilities,
have we not ? Pershaps we can better
discharge them by aU of us working
together. We wish you happiness and
success in this, our common cause."
A number of important American
organizations are giving their support
to the plan. Among them are the Gen-
eral Federation of Women's Clubs, the
American Friends Service Committee
and, first to adopt it on a state-wide
basis, the New York State Association
of Classroom Teachers.
One of the important organizations
participating in the United States is
the World Student Service Fund. The
Fund has announced the adoption of
the Gift Plan as a fund-raising medium
for a national campaign in American
colleges and universities this Spring.
The Fund is an activity of the World.

"A Human Scheme"
THE United States is the first membernation of Unesco to launch a natio-
nal campaign in support of the Gift
Coupon Plan, but Unesco expects the
plan to be operating in several other
member countries before the end of the
year.
The plan, as Dr. John W. Taylor,
Unesco's Deputy Director General points
out"is a human scheme where every
little helps."
"The business of building a world in
which all men can enjoy a full and
happy life,"he. ! lays,"is the respons-
ibility of specialists and experts who
must of necessity think in terms of very
broad plans stretching over a long
period of time. The people who are
engaged upon this important task cannot
hope to deal with all individual needs.
"That is where the Unesco Gift Cou-
pon Plan comes in. By talking part in
it through normal group activities, an
individual-any individual-can do
something personal for someone less
fortunate-something which will make
the buyer of Stamps or Coupons, feel
that he is contributing in a direct, pers-
onal and practical way to the cause of
international understanding."
EARLY last year, Unesco made aJ', world-wide appeal on behalf of
340, 000 Greek children, whose
lives have been uprooted by nine years
of war, occupation and civil strife.
People in many countries responded
generously, and thousands of dollars,
pounds and francs swelled Unesco's
reconstruction fund, ear-marked for
Greece.
In Denmark, however, a large volun-
tary relief society called M ellemfol-
A'e/tgt Samvirke decided to give more
than money. With Unesco's support,
a team of Danish students, all skilled
builders, was dispatched to Greece as
a living symbol of postwar co-operation
between peoples.
Last September, this team of ten
young Danes arrived in the Greek vil-
lage of Agnandero, near Mount Olym-
pus. With spade and mattock, trowel
and hammer, they went straight to
work on the schoolhouse-the school-
house which had been started long
before the war and never finished.
To finance this direct contribution,
Mellemfolkeligt Samvirke joined hands
with Denmark's National Commission
for Unesco to launch a unique fund-rais-
ing project among the school children
of the country. The Danish Minister
of Education opened the campaign with
a radio address at Christmas.
Brick-Buying Marathon
TN Denmark, some 130, 000 boys andgirls are buying a brick a week to
build the school at Agnandero. The
bricks are made of paper, marked
"UNESCO", and each costs 20 ore
- about two cents. When a Danish
pupil buys a brick, he pastes it on a
diagram of the real school his fellow
Danes are building in Greece.
By selling something like one million
paper"bricks", Mellem/oZkeligt Sari-
virke aims to raise 125, 000 kroner by
the first of May, 1951. The Danish
government has promised to match this
sum, making a total target of 250, 000
kroner (over $25, 000) to cover the cost
of real bricks-and tiles and wood and
other supplies-for the school in
Agnandero.
Since the drive began over 500 pri-
mary and secondary schools all over
Denmark have joined the brick-buying
marathon. As late as mid-February,
an average of half a dozen new schools
daily were applying.
Building a schoolhouse in Greece is
all in the year's work for Mellem/oZ-
keZigt Samvirke, whose name roughly
translated means"W orking-Together-
Among-People".
Denmark itself was still Axis-occu-
pied in 1944, when a number of civic-
minded groups came together to lay
plans for helping Europe rebuild after
liberation. Hardly had the fighting
stopped in spring of 1945 when the
newly-formed Mellemfolkeligt Samvirke
sent 35 nurses up to the far north of
Norway to aid returning refugees. Then
it began sending out teams of volunteer

SINCE the war ended, this organizationhas sent over 900 young Danes
abroad to do practical relief. work
in devastated areas-including former

they helped patch up the fearful war

MOTURIKI. AN ISLAND"LABORATORY"FOR COMMUNITY. DEVELOPMENT I  THE S UTH PACIFIC
MARCH 1951
A decision taken around a conference table at Noumea,New Caledonia, in May 1949 has wrought a peaceful
revolution in the lives of the 500 or so inhabitants of
Moturiki, a speck of an island in the Fijian archipelago.
At that time, the Research Council of the South Pacific
Commission approved a plan, later approved by the Com-
mission itself, to single out communities in each territory
within the Commission's area of action for intensive expe-
rimentation in methods of raising living standards with
the human and natural resources at hand.
The South Pacific Commission set up in 1947 by the
governments of Australia, France, the Netherlands, New
Zealand, the United Kingdom and the United States, is a
regional organization whose aim is to promote the econo-
mic and social welfare and advancement of the peoples
of non-self-governing territories in the South Pacific
Region.
To launch its community development plan, the Com-
mission approached the Government of Fiji and asked it
to select a community where a pilot project could be
carried out. As a result, the Director of Education for
Fiji visited the island of Moturiki to explore the possibi-
lities of centering the scheme there.
THE PEOPLE : Typical islanders of the Fijian Archipelago, these two men are crossing in a punt
from Moturiki to the larger island of Ovalau, the nearest market and centre of communications.
The man holding the tiller is the boat's captain.
After the purpose of the project had
been explained to them, the people of
the island expressed their apprecia-
tion of the opportunity thus offered,
and promised full co-operation.
ALL-FIJIAN TEAM
njr OTURIKI, which thus becamethe first area to be selected
under the regional programme,
proved to be an ideal site. Only five
and one-half miles long and never
more than two miles wide, it lies off
the Fiji island of Ovalau. There were
only 527 persons in its ten villages,
and its small area and population
enabled it to come under the
educator's"microscope"without any
great difficulty.
This"pilot project in community
development", as it was termed by the
Commission, began slowly. Its prin-
cipal objective was not to"develop"
Moturiki, but to test methods of
improving facilities for education,
health, sanitation, house-building,
agriculture, land-utilization and
general self-help, so that they could
be put to work more. efficiently and
on a larger scale elsewhere in the
South Pacific region.
Although an advisory group was set
up, consisting of the Directors of
Education, Medical Services and Agri-
culture for Fiji, the Southern District
Commissioner and a representative of
the Fijian Affairs Board, the actual
work on the island was done by a
team made up entirely of Fijians.
In February, 1950, the team arrived
on Moturiki. Headed by Eliki Seru,
a 32-year-old supervising teacher, it
consisted of a nurse, a forest guard,
two instructors to teach handicrafts
and house building, and a health
inspector.
ISLAND LIFE RECORDED
ITS first task was to survey allaspects of life on the island.
With painstaking care, the team
examined in great detail the health,
housing, agriculture, education, forest-
ry, women's occupations and social
conditions on Moturiki.
The housing survey, for example,
included the dimensions of each house,
the number of occupants, the condition
of foundations, flooring, walls, ceiling,
drainage and ventilation, and the
nature of the water supply. In all,
27 aspects of life on the island were
analysed and recorded.
Communications between Moturiki
and the outside world-formerly, the
island's only link to the mainland
was an oar-powered ferry which took
one hour-and-a-half to make the trip
- were facilitated by the installation
of radio telephone apparatus. Within
ten hours, islanders had cut two
40-foot masts from the bush, raised an
aerial, and the radio was installed in
working condition.
By June, the survey was completed
and the team returned to the main-
land to report to the commission's
advisory group. For two months, a
programme of village development
was hammered out and then, in
August, the actual work began.
These are the main points of the
programme designed to make Moturiki
a better place to. live in :
1. A village development fund,
financed by an interest-free loan of
E500 from the South Pacific Commis-
sion, has been set up after the
islanders voted its acceptance.
2. To increase Moturiki's efficiency
as a food producer, cocoanut groves
are being rehabilitated, a crop of yams
has been planted and three young
men from the island have been sent
to the mainland to learn livestock
management. In addition, a plough, a
harrow and a pair of bulIocks have
been sent to Moturiki for experiments
in rice-growing.
3. The team's forest guard has
begun a campaign to stop islanders
from burning their land to clear it,
and, at the same time, a cutting and
thinning system has been begun to
turn the forests into a profitable
source of firewood.
4. The Fiji government's medical
department has agreed to provide
material needed to build a combined
maternity home and clinic at the
village of Nasauvuki. Moturiki's
population was also examined for
tuberculosis and 19 of the islanders
were sent to a mainland hospital for
further observation.
5. Experiments are now under way
to test reed insulation as a means of
protecting dwellers of iron-roofed'
houses from the sun. At the same
time, work has started on the digging
'Of bore-hole latrines to improve
sanitation.
ACTION BY THE PEOPLE
THROUGHOUT its work, the de-i velopment team has taken care
to observe local customs and not
to force any changes which the people
themselves did not want. The team's
work is discussed by a Moturiki De-
velopment Committee headed by the
island's chief.
While progress is being made in
Moturiki, the South Pacific Commis-
sion has other projects geared towards
raising the standard of living, health
and education of the inhabitants of
other Pacific islands under way.
Some are purely for research pur-
poses ; others are pilot projects. In
general, they are co-operative ende-
avours between the Commission, the
various governments concerned and
the people themselves-with the
accent on action by the people.
These projects range from the con-
trol of tropical weeds and insect pests
to the development of new educational
techniques and facilities, and from the
development of island fisheries to the
control of tropical disease and tuber-
culosis.
Such work is opening up a new
phase in regional co-operation to raise
living standards in an area where
differences between cultures, relative
economic and social development and
economic potential although often
wide, are few enough to permit a
regional approach to many of the
problems of development.

MARCH 1951 Page 9-UNESCO COURIER
THERE WAS launched recently in
Paris a French Association of
Science writers-the fifth such
national group of special writers in this
field. The oldest is the National Asso-
ciation of Science Writers in the L'. S. A. ;
the second is the British ; and then
follow the Danish and Austrian.
In welcoming the French Association
to Unesco House, where it held its first
public meeting, L'neseo's Director-
General, M. Torres Bodet, reminded the
writers that the scientist, whatever his
discipline, is today at the heart of all
progress. There is hardly a field of
human activity unaffected by scientific
advance. During the last few decades,
the consequences of this scientific mo-
vement have not only remodelled our
whole lives, but have also obliged us
to restate and to reconsider all our
problems. Religion, morals, our con-
ceptions of the world have been largely
reshaped.
Scientific knowledge, continued
M. Torres Bodet, has therefore a key
part to play in the formation of modern
man and in the most urgent problem of
our day : the reconciliation of men and
the protection of peace. Science.
through the riches it creates, can con-
tribute in a fundamental manner to
satisfy the basic needs of mankind and,
in so doing, it works for peace. Further,
the universality of the scientific mind,
the generality of its methods, and the
unbiassed enthusiasm that research
work engenders, all these help to build
a common bridge between men.
Eyes For The People
S ctevce writers therefore have a keyask to perform in society. It is not
an easy one, for there is much ill-
will, mistrust and fear of science. to
overcome. This fear Is a symptom of
the malaise of our age. The reason
for it. is obvious. People no longer be-
lieve in the inevitability of progress
through scientific achievement.
The science writer has the difficult

Francaise.
lask of pointing out that science is not
an end in itself, but a means to an end.
It is a search for truth. The Ilnal de-
cision about what is to be done with the
practical application of scientific
research rests with society. Therefore,
a democratic society requires an in-
formed public : not the least part of
which information must
be an adequate know-
ledge of progress and
acilievement in the field
of the Sciences. The
limitations as well as
the possibilities of
science must be under-
stood. In all countries, whatever their
state of economic development, the
importance of the role of science is
recognized. The Technical Assistance
programme would be meaningless
\without this.
The science writer is the link
between the scientists and the people.
This is no mere mechanical role : he
has a living function 10 perform. He
makes clear to the people the signify-
cance of the seemingly esoteric work
in the laboratory : he penetrates into
the secrets of the test-tube, he examines
the radio-active wonders of the atomic

pile, and he watches the surgeon with
pioneer hands at, his pre-frontal leuco-
tomy. Science writers are eyes for the
people.
In 1934, at the Pittsburg meeting
of the American Association for the
Advancement of Science, Professor
Einstein was to give
his first lecture in Eng-
lish discussing his
mathematical proof
that mass and energy
are equivalent and
interchangeable. Mr.
Herbert B. Nichols,
natural sciences editor of the Christian
Science Monitor, tells how the newly-
formed National Association of Science
writers tackled the problem of inter-
preting this important communication
to the public : Professor Einstein's
single paragraph abstract was abso-
lutely hopeless so far as gettin g
any quotable quotes was concerned.
His address was scheduled for
a most inopportune time fOl'the
majority of OUI'deadlines, He
was held incommunicado by well-
meaning friends. He could not see re-
porters. So toe drafted a request that
he meet lcith us all at a time convenient
to him, but in advance of his scheduled
lecture.
Professor Einstein agreed : That day
we all had good, front-page stories in
which we were able to interpret for the
public what Einstein's theories actually
meant, why the theory of relativity is
important to almost every branch of
science, and a/orecast on then possibility
of some day harnessing energy within
the nuclei or atoms as a useful source
of power.
Stimulation For
Scientists
No science can flourish as an iso-late : and the science writer helps
to make apparent to the scientists
some of the problems that need expert
investigation. He is an aid to the vision
of the scientist. I rather think,
comments Mr. Nichols, that our active-
ties in playing up certain stories like
Urey's work with heavy water, Jleitner's
discovery of the meaning of fissionable
uranium, Anderson and the cyclotron,
Van de Oraa"and the electrostatic ge-
nerator, early work with projected X-
rays, and many others, actually
stimulated other scientists reading our
accounts to further thought and action,
and actually hastened both scienttfic
progress and personal recognition for
the pioneer scientists themselves.
This is certainty truce of the writings
of British science writers like J. G.
Crowther and Ritchie Calder, who have
pinpointed current research and Its
social implications so ably that new
lines of development have been opened
up.
UNESCO wishes to help the forma-
tion of associations of science writers
throughout the world. When there are
sufficient groups, the plan is to consider
the establishment of an international
federation of associations of science
writers.

BROADCASTS FROM THE STARS
ESSENTIALLY all of ourInformation concerning the
surrounding universe comes
to us through the medium of
light waves. Astronomy thus
began as a visual science, with
observations made directly by the
eye alone or In conjunction with
the telescope. With the develop-
ment of photography, more per-
manent records became a possi-
bility. but visible and near-visible
light waves were still carrying the
message. Later, when photogra-
phic plates could be made sen-
sitive to infra-red radiations
much too long for the human eye
to detect, additional information
was gathered from the skies-
information about stars too cool
to send out appreciable amounts
of visible light, but still lavishly
pouring forth the longer waves
beyond the red.
When the physicist speaks of
"radiation"he intends the term
to include not only visible light
but all the ranges of shorter
waves (including the ultra-violet.
X-rays and the even shorter and
more penetrating rays from radio-
active materials), and longer
waves too (such as the infra-red
and radio waves). An incan-
descent body, such as a star, must
radiate some of all of these
varieties of waves, the relative

perature. There Is little hope of

ing its way through the earth's
atmosphere ; but longer waves.
including the radio range, could
find their way to earth and so
tell us things about the stars and
the spaces between them that
would never be revealed to the
eye.
BIRTH OF RADIO
ASTRONOMY
THE pioneer Brltl : ; h physicist.Sir Oliver Ledge, suspected
this over half a century ago.
but was unsuccessful In detecting
such radiations. It was in 1932
that Dr. K. G. Jansky of the Bell
Telephone Laboratories tin the
United States first tuned In cos-
mic radio signals while attempt-
ing to detect"static"from a
thunderstorm. He used a radio
antsnna which could be swung
about to pick up signals from one
A CROSS-SECTION OF OUR GALAXY
or another direction in the sky.
and he noticed that even when
atmospheric disturbances were
absent, weak signals could be
detected, apparently coming from
various places in the direction of
the Milky Way. Thus was the
science of radio astronomy born.
The Milky Way is the central
plane of our galaxy, or local
group of stars, visible on a clear
night as an irregular, faintly
luminous band. stretching across
the sky. The stars that abound
In our region 01 the universe are
spread through a region of space
that Is shaped like a watch, with
our solar system located some
distance to one side of the centre
The Milky Way represenrts simply
the appearance of these stars as
seen from the earth. If we look
out In a direction toward the
edge of the watch we see many
more stars than 11 we look In
some other direction.
About five years after Jansky'e
first observations. Grote Reber.
an American amateur scientist,
bu1lt a huge hollow reflector for
sweeping the sky, and a group of
English workers took up the
search as well. It was soon found
that strong radio signals were
received from several concen-
trated points In the Milky Wayregion, but that these centres did
not coincide with any of the
brighter stars. Rather, the source
seems to be the vast clouds of gas
and dust that are known to
occupy the huge spaces between
the hundreds of millions of mil-
lions of stars In our system, and
the origin of radiation is thought
to be the motion of electrons In
these regions.
SIGNAL FROM THE
"tSLND UNtVERSE"
By tuning the radio receiverattached to the radio teles-
cope, the experimenters are
able to make maps of the distri-
bution of the radiant material In
space. Thus far with observa-
tions in both the northern and
southern regions of the sky,
A RADIO"TELESCO PEn : Rebar's apparatus for picking up cosmic ray
signals is this large hollow deflector, which can be turned to any direction
in the sky. A detecting device is placed at the point where the radio waves
are concentrated by the reflector.
about one hundred locallsed
sources of radio waves have been
discovered, but only two or three
seem to be connected with any
visible stars. Australian workers
have observed that one interest-
ing radio source coincides with
the famous Crab Nebula, a prodi-
gious mass of hot gases resulting
from a nova, or stellar flare-up,
that occurred in 1045 AD. Mean-
while. just a few months ago.
British observers were able for
the first time to detect radio
emission from an object outside
our own galaxy, the great Andro-
meda Nebula. This"ISland uni-
verse", our nearest neighbor In
space, is so distant that light-
which travels 300, 000 kilometres
per second-takes nearly three-
quarters of a million years to tra-
verse the distance. Andromeda is
not only a neighbour but a close
copy of our own galazy in many
ways. and 80 it must be concluded
that we. too, broadcast a stream
of radio waves into surrounding
space.
The sun, which supplles us so
lavishly with visible radiations.
also sends out barely detectable
amounts of radio waves. On
certain occasions, this output
flares up to a hundred or a
thousand times its normal value,
and these bursts are sometimes
connected with sunspots and
with brilliant solar eruptions
known as flares. Because these
sudden bursts of radiant energy
may affect long-distance commer-
cial radio reception on earth, they
are being studied Intensively ; but
what radio astronomers learn
through such investigation will
undoubtedly tell us much about
the fundamental physical nature
of the sun as well.

UNESCO COURIER-Page MARCH 1951
THE first book to tell the dramatic story of what the
t United Nations and U. N. Specialized Agencies are doing
for the y ung people of the world ha  been written by
Eleanor Roosevelt, chairman of the U. N. Commission
on Human Rights, in collaboration with Helen Ferris,
American writer and editor.
Entitled"Partners : The United Nations and Youth"
(Doubleday & Co., Garden City, New York, $ 3. 00), the
profusely illustrated volume recounts the warm, human
stories of those who have been benefited in all parts of the
world by the activities of such organizations as Unesco, the
World Health Organization, the United Nations International
Children's Emergency Fund, the International Relief Organiza-
tion and the Food and Agriculture Organization.
.. young people are important in the United Nations", the
authors say.... In the year ahead, building a better world for
youth would be a part of all the United Nations does. U. N.
teams would travel far and wide, working with the many
governments so that young people and children might have
more fòod, better health, more schools, more fun".
The account of what has already been done for youth is
presented in a series of moving and exciting stories about
individual children in 35 countries, based on actual reports
submitted by U. N. personnel. For example, there is Hana
of Lidice, lost for five years, then brought back to her mother
through the help of I. R. O. ; Arturo, the Italian boy, who
helped teach his grandmother about the skim milk furnished
by UNICEF ; Abed, the Egyptian boy, who found out how
WHO fights and conquers dread ailments as old as his
homeland ; and Kyria, the teen-age Greek girl, helped to face
the problems of a new life by Unesco.
The stories, illustrated by scores of photographs, tell how
these and hundreds of thousands of other young victims of the
world's calamities have been helped to help themselves ; how
they learned to sew, cook, build homes, camps, roads ; how
they have vaulted the barriers of geographical, political and
social distance to become friends ; how they develop their
friendship by meeting at youth conferences and living together
in work camps and children's towns.
A substantial amount of the account of the U. N.'s partnership
with youth in the period since the end of the war is devoted
to the many and varied activities of Unesco, such as the step
which led to the organization of the International Federation
of Children's Communities and to the organization of Inter-
national Voluntary Work Camps. Several chapters describe
in vivid detail Unesco's efforts in such fields as extension and
intensification of education facilities ; the stimulation of
popular interest in the scientific development of the world
to-day and tomorrow ; the removal of barriers to fruitful
cultural exchanges ; and, perhaps most important of all, the
continuation of the age-old struggle for fundamental freedoms
and human rights.

ABOLITION OF SERFDOM IN
RUSSIA.-To those St. Petersburg andMoscow students, whom a
horrified Europe called"nihilists", Czar
Alexander II was at most a vacillating
autocrat. To the nobility and the army he
was a"liberal"I under the unfortunate in-
fluence of Western ideas. It was proba-
bly because of his hesitation that he came
to an untimely end. He was assassinated
on the same day that he signed a decree
of reforms-a decree which his son imme-
diately revoked.
But 20 years earlier, his liberalism had
at least suppressed one of the most dis-
tressing survivals of the Middle Ages-
serfdom. In answer to a petition by Polish
property owners in Lithuania, the Czar
authorized the formation of"committees to
improve peasants'conditions". Against
the advice of his counsellors, he sent these
instructions to all provinces where serfdom
existed. Committees were formed every-
where to solve the numerous problems of
mterests and rights raised by the emanci-
pation of men of the soil. Finally on 3rd
March, 1861, Alexander II proclaimed the
historic law. abolishing serfdom.
OLIVER WENDELL HOLMES.
- Oliver Wendell Holmes was born of a
lumous literary family, son of the author
of"The Autocrat of the Breakfast Table",
at Boston on 8th March, 1841. Through his
writings on law he fired the imagination
of generations of students and a book he
wrote on jurisprudence sold like a novel.
He was a member of the United States Su-
preme Court for more than thirty years.
Above all, he was a liberal judge ; some
even called him a"radical". He fought
against trusts and for the workers'trade
unions. American socialists regarded him
as one of their own. But Justice Holmes
remained"the distinguished Bostonian",
and showed no taste for hasty and popu-
lar reforms. He believed, however, in
justice and would have died for the liberty
of others."If people", he said,"want to
experiment, they should be allowed to do
it". He was no pacifist, but when a court
refused American citizenship to a pacifist
immigrant, he protested :"If there is any
principle of the Constitution that more im-
peratively calls for attachment than any
other it is the principle or free thought-
not free thought for those who agree, with
us, but freedom for the thought we hate".
And, as the immigrant was a Quaker,
Holmes added :"The Quakers have done
tht. ir share for the country... I had not
supposed hitherto that we regretted our
inability to expel them because they
believe more than some of us do in the
teachings of the Sermon on the Mount".
PIETER CORNEUSSEN HOOFT.
The most bril-
liant of the Dutch
writers of The 17th
century was born
at Amsterdam on
16th March 1581.
He was barely 17
years old when he
was admitted to
the literary circle
"In Leifde Bloeien-
de" (Love in
Bloom), to which
he presented his
first tragedy. The
second, entitled
"Theseus and Ariadne", did not appear
until four years later. In the meantime
Hooft had travelled to Paris, Florence and
Rome-the indispensable journey of which
, 11 young poets dreamed. On his return
he became a protégé of the Prince of
Orange, with paid duties and seemed to
be definitely devoted to comedies and
idylls. But suddenly in 1618, he abandon-
ed poetry for history. Twenty-five years
of dogged efforts produced his monument-
al works consecrated to Henry IV of
France, to the Medicis, and above all to
the history of the Netherlands. It was
these works which not only made him
"the. best Dutch prose writer", but also
one of the first really European writers.
NOV ALIS-Heinrich von Ofterdingen,. hero of an unfinished ro-
mance, sought, by means worthy of a
knight of the Grail, a mystic flower, whose
symbolism was more than poetic.
The author of the romance, writing under
the name Novalis, had also set out on a
quest for beauty beyond that expressed in
his"Geistliche Lieder"and"Hymm to
the Night", which he had written on the
death of his Baneee. Pioneer of German
romanticism, he wanted 10 accomplish
what Wagner in his turn dreamed of later
on : the creation of a new art, in step
with the world, which would harmonise
poetry and life, science and religion. He
had scarcely time to rough out the ideas
for this tremendous work On the 25th
Marsh,"801, the town of Weissenfels heard
of the death of one of its officials, Fried-
rich Leopold von Hardenberg," ! mown in
literature under the name of Novalix". He
was 29 years of age.
BELA BARTOK.
Béla Bartòk was
born on 25th March
1881 in the Hun-
garian village of
Nagyszentmiklos.
At the beginning
of the Century,
composers in Eu-
rope, from Russia
to Spain, were
using folk music
as themes for their
compositions, and
when Bartòk was
20 he composed
rhapsodies on Hun-
; 1arran airs at the RoyaJ Academy of Buda-
pest. The young Hungarian composer soon
saw, however, that his"magyar"themes
were mostly Slovakian or Roumanian. He
therefore decided to study folklore more
deeply that his contemporaries and to deal
with the subject from an international ra-
ther than a national view. These studies
which took him as far as Algeria, did not,
however, end by making him a composer
of folklore music only. Bar : wok became one
of the great musicians of our time. His
art, drawn from world treasures of rhythms
and moods may at first seem a little cold,
but above all it is serenely lucid.

building. The University's temporary library, housed in a former school, recently received a
consignment of CARE-UNESCO books donated through the help of the War Dads Auxiliary of

nold Lauche ; Dr.
Boris Rajewsky,
Rector of the Uni-
versity, and Pro-
fessor Herbert

Department of
Physical Science.
IN a small Greek town towards the
end of 1949, a six-year-old girl was
brought into a doctor's surgery,
feverish, vomiting and complaining
of a severe headache. The doctor dia-
gnosed the case as meningitis and sent
her to the nearest hospital.
Here, the case was confirmed as one
of tuberculous meningitis, and the
child was rushed to Athens where, the
hospital doctor had read, similar cases
had been successfully treated with
streptomycin.
The use of this drug saved the child,
but for this one fortunate case where
the doctor knew of recent advances
in medicine, there are many others
where children do not get the same
chance.
Knowledge is slow to spread particu-
larly in under developed countries and
in others that were cut off by the
war from information on advances in
medical skill and treatment. It was
to resume and increase the diffusion of
knowledge in this and other fields that
the CARE-UNESCO Book Fund Pro-
gramme was begun just over 18 months
ago.
Paul Comly French, executive direc-
tor of the Co-operative of American
Remittances to Europe (CARE), open-
ed the programme. Shortly after, on
July 15, 1949, 18 new technical books
were presented to the University of
Louvain in Belgium.
But as the programme got under
way, the University of Louvain-twice
destroyed in the two Great Wars-re-
ceived a second gift of $1, 000 worth
of books. And other shipments went
to other institutions around the world.
One Year-50, 000 Books
IN the first year of operation, theFund made 530 shipments, t talling
nearly 50, 000 books and periodicals
to 24 countries. Greece alone-which
had 91 per cent of its schools de-
stroyed or rendered unusable during
the war-received 31 shipments of new
technical books.
Contributions for books and medical
equipment tallied up to nearly one
million dollars.
During the year, the programme has
been expanded to take in not only
war-torn countries, but also nations
with development problems. The coun-
tries which have participated in the
programme include : Austria, Belgium,
Burma, Ceylon, Czechoslovakia, Fin-
land, France, the Western zone of
Germany and Berlin, Great Britain,
Greece, India, Italy, Japan, Jordan
Korea, Malta, Netherlands, Norway,
Pakistan, Philippines, Poland, Thai-
land and Yugoslavia. All except
Czechoslovakia and Poland are stillparticipating.
At this moment new contracts are
being negotiated in the South Ame-
rican countries which have expressed
an interest in the Book Fund.
The categories available have been
enlarged too. Now, they include medi-
cine, health and welfare, dentistry,
nursing, pharmacy, agricultural science,
veterinary science, biology, mathema-
tics, physics, chemistry, engineering,
English language instruction, teaching
and education, geology, library admi-
nistration, psychology, sociology and
statistics.
This expanding programme under-
lines both CARE's and UNESCO's de-
sire to do something in the service of
peace that is both concrete and lasting.
Tools Of Progress
CARE is the welfare agency thathas del i v ere d approximately
$100 ; 000, 000 in food and textile
packages to Europe and Asia since
1945. Its primary aim was, and is, to
provide an efficient, reputable channel
by which individual Americans could
sent gifts to their friends and relatives
abroad. But, simultaneously, the or-
ganization decided :"Relief sustains,
but we must also progress."
Books and scientific equipment are
obvious tools of progress. CARE has
delivered medical equipment, bought
by the U. S. State Department, to
11 West German universities. The
schools each received an iron lung
(costing about $1, 500, to be used
for treatment as well as training pur-
poses), oxygen tents, radium (for can-
cer treatment), anaesthesia apparatus
and medical literature.
Carefully designed hand ploughs are
now being sent to India and Pakistan
so that these people can"grow their
own packages".
In the book field, CARE looked to
UNESCO for help and direction.
The first step in developing the Book
Fund was UNESCO's survey of need.
It was discovered that 1016 of the
world's important libraries were, in-
deed, in desperate need.
Priority listings were made of insti-
tutions. Then UNESCO and CARE
queried the libraries and universities
as to which books they needed most.
At that point, CARE took over. It
approached the American people.
"Here is the need", CARE said."Here
are the means to fill ; the need. But,
between the need and the fulfillment
stand dollars we do not have."
A $ 1, 000, 000 Answer
THE one-million dollars that camei. to CABE's New York office and
its local offices-in the United
States, Oanada and South America-
were the answer. Contributions la-
belled,"For the Book Fund, have
come from every state in the Union,
Hawaii. Alaska, the Canal Zone, Co-
lumbia, Mexico, Venezuela, Canada,
Turkey, Germany, England and France.
To-day, the need continues. CARE
recently announced that the Depart-
ment of Geology at Seoul National
University in Korea has received a top
priority rating. The reason : although
mining is one of Korea's major in-
dustries, the geology library had only
a few old Japanese books on this vast
subject even before the recent bombing
and fighting in Seoul. In fact, not
until four years ago did Korea even
have a department of geology as it
had been under Japanese occupation.
As soon as it is practicable, CARE
plans to send at least the nucleus of
an up-to-date library on geology to
Seoul, providing the funds are avail-
able. Thus CARE-UNESCO aim to
help in the reconstruction of another
wounded country.
New Guide Book Contrasts Riches And i
s
Needs Of French Provincial Libraries !
Volunteers restoring a war-damaged library in France : Two members
of a team of Danish and Swedish students working in the library at
Valognes, which was damaged by bombing. Their efforts saved
a collection of 20, 000 books, including many rare volumes, from
further damage and decay.
T tBRARY services, bibliography, documentation and thesupply of publ cations have had from the start an
important place in Unesco's programme because
they are realistic and necessary services to help scholars
and scientists in their work. Their development is the
responsibility of Unesco's Libraries Division.
Last November, as part of its efforts towards making
such services more readily available to research workers
and students, Unesco co-operated with the French Li-
braries Administration in the publication of the first part
of a Libraries'Guide covering the libraries of Paris.
The second volume of the Guide which has just been
published is devoted to the French Departments and
presents a situation report on the resources of 1. 028
institutions.
Besides reporting on the main French provincial,
university and municipal libraries, this second volume
also covers the national libraries of Algiers and Stras-
bourg, as well as those of professional societies, private
institutions and collections attached to archives, giving
information on personnel, times or opening, conditions
of book borrowing, as well as statistical and historical
data of the collections.
TWELVE MELONS FOR DUMAS
PERHAPS the most striking fact revealed by the Guide,however, is the rich ess of the French provincial
libraries. Almost every small town possesses a
treasure trove of old manuscripts and rare books, as their
libraries were founded with material confiscated from
monasteries and religious colleges after 1790. Others
have already celebrated their second centenary, their
founders including such famous men as the Marquis de
Méjanes of Aix-en-Provence and Monseigneur d'Inguim-
bert of Carpentras.
The Guide lists many libraries which have been set up
to meet a continual growth of industrial areas, as well as
others with curious origins. For instance. Cavaillon's
library, which is proud of its remarkable collection of
18th century Hebrew books, was founded in 1864 by
Alexander Dumas, who offered it the complete collection
of his works for an annual fee of a dozen melons.
A much younger library is that of Chenebier, a village
in the Franche-Comte. which owes its existence to the
Indian Government. India endowed it in recognition of
the aid given by the people of the town to Indian soldiers
who escaped from a German prison camp in May 1944.
Leading provincial and university libraries publish
catalogues, but too often little is known of the smaller
institutions. The Guide however, has now helped to till
this gap. Few people know, for instance, that Carpen-
tras possesses many autographed scores of J. S. Bach,
that Chateauroux preserves the manuscript of the Song
of Roland, and that there are excellent facilities for
studying the Bvzantine authors at La Fleche, or the
religion of Swedenborg at Bourg-en-Bresse.
TREASURES OF VALOGNES
THE Guide also shows the other side of the picture buyrevealing instances of need. Th  irreparable losses
suffered during the last war by such formerly rich
libraries as Caen, Brest, Beauvais and St-Malo have been
widely publicized. But little has been said of the fate
of certam abandoned collections, unused and cared for
and slowly deteriorating.
An example of what can be done to help such libraries
was recently shown at Valognes, whose library treasures
were saved through the efforts of young Danish and
Swedish volunteers responding to an appeal by Unesco.This, however, was only one example, and one of the
most valuable services rendered bv the Guide is that It
makes known the cases of many other needy libraries.
Such notices as the following, which refers to a town
in South West France, are sufficiently eloquent :
"LIBRARIAN : None.
OPENING : Temporarily suspended.
HISTORY : FOllnded uring the l ! et'olution with works Irom
local convenes, augmented in the t 9th century by gifts
and works 01 the Champollions and government

scholars. Library collectIOns trans {erred about 1880
to/h. e attics 01 the town/wll, where they have remain-
ed neglected {or a long lime. Re-organization is not

The second volume of the Libraries'Guide therefore,
serves a double purpose. although primarily intended
for students and scholars, it is of equal interest to those
who wish to help public libraries make a vital contribu-
tion to education at every phase from childhood to adult
life.

THE REFIJGEES WHO
LEARNED TO "THINK
WITH THEIR HANDS"
SINCE its creation in 1947, the Inter-
national Refugee Organization
(IRO) has helped to resettle hun-
dreds of thousands of refugees and
displaced persons in all parts of the
world. There are others, however,
for whom it has not been possible
to find new homes, because of their
age or infirmities. For these men
and women the IRO has taken special
measures.
Just a year ago, on February 2B,
1950, M. Robert Schumann, French
Minister of Foreign Affairs, and
Mr. J. Donald Kingsley, Director-
General of IRO, signed an agree-
ment. By its terms, France accepted
responsibility for all refugees living
within its frontiers while the IRO
agreed to devote funds towards the
setting up of special refugee centres
which would later be turned over to
France.
The article below describes the
work of one such centre opened
recently in France, where physically
handicapped refugees are equipped
for a new start in life.
"I'd probably have got alongall right, but for this old
peg", said the man tapping
his artificial leg.
"I ask you", he went on,"who'd
choose a man 1l'ith one leg when
the world is full of healthy bipeds ?
For chaps like us-maimed,
wounded, sick-the chances of
emigrating are nil."
"Yet", he added,"there are
trades where you don't have to walk
a hundred yards. But no selection
board will consider us. I myself
am game to tackle anything, but
I've had absolutely no experience
of the sort of job where you're
glued to a des/c all day. So, there
just didn't seem to be any way out.
Then, one day, I heard about the
centre at Valence. Now, every-
thing's going fine".
He laughed and handed me a
watch that he had been regulating
while he talked ; its regular ticking
seemed to give him enormous sat-
isfaction.
He was a man of about 40, with
one of those unpronounceable names
bristling with contradictory conso-
nants. He spoke fluent French, in
which the slang of Paris was mixed
with the accent of Warsaw.
Other men were busy at work
around him. I learned that the Bait
had been in a sanatorium, that the
Slovak had heart trouble, that all
these men without a country were
victims of some physical disability
which precluded them from return-
ing to their old way of life. Then
came this chance to learn a new
trade adapted to their capabilities
in the rehabilitation centre opened
by the International Refugee Organ-
ization (IRO) near Valence in south
east France.
Finding The Right Men
WITH men of so many national-ities and pr fessional b ck-
grounds, of varying physical capa-
cities and assorted ages, it's no
easy task to seek out those capable
of becoming technicians in the
watch-making industry. Setection
is made through a series of tests.
Adaptation follows, care being
taken to guide the newcomer
towards that specialized branch
community basis, the Centre for
Vocational Rehabilitation (Centre
de Rééducation Professionnelle)
came into being near Valence,
to which he is most suited. It re-
quires plenty of tact and a great
deal of patience.
One must know when a begin-
ner, who might otherwise be dis-
couraged by the magnitude of the
task in front of him, should be in-
troduced to his particular training
at some intermediate stage ; an in-
tellectual, on the other hand, must
be persuaded that there is nothing
demeaning in the idea of"thinking
with his hands".
In planning the Centre, the pro-
moters considered that it was ne-
cessary to create not merely a re-
classification centre like others
that have been established bv the
IRO near its German and Austrian
camps. They therefore decided
to treat these reclassification acti-
vities as the first step towards the
formation of a vital permanent
community centre, a small self-gov-
erning city, where the refugees,
finally settled and equipped with a
trade, could enjoy conditions of
work and a degree of self-respect
to which everyone aspires.
A Community Altair
A FRENCH organization, "MutualCommunity Assistance" (En-
tr'aide Communautaire), accepted
the task of carrying out the plan,
using the experience it had gained
in its successful community work
centre at Boimondeau. Thus, on a
At present the refugees are given
technical training in the making of
main watch parts from gold watch
cases to dial faces. The latter re-
quires skilful use of a pressing ma-
chine which, with delicate preci-
sion, prints the watch face. Later,
when they have completed their
training the school will become a
community undertaking, the mana-
gement becoming the responsibility
of the ex-pupils, with the excep-
tion of those who have chosen to
employ their new found trade
elsewhere.
The school is established in a
fine old estate just outside Valence.
The main building contains the
offices, reading room, bar and
sleeping quarters of those pupil-
guests whose health needs the most
care. The others have sunny, in-
dividual rooms in buildings front-
ing on a lawn. At the other end
of the park, hidden by high trees,
are the workshops.
It's a pleasure to see pupils so
contentedly and industriouslv at
work with their modern equip-
ment. The teachers, accustomed
to younger and often less attentive
pupils, are delighted with their
keenness and enthusiasm.
I stopped in one of the workshops
to talk to an elderly Swiss
watchmaker."The way we teach",
he told me,"makes allowance for
the fact that our students are
adults. We are not training them
as apprentices but as fully qualified
technicians who will later be
given a chance to talre part
in the workshop management.
And we don't follow the usual
practice of watchmaking schools :
here, no one works for nothing
during the training period, for this
can give the idea that it's of no
consequence if a watch part is
bungled. Each pupil passes
through successive stages of all
branches of watchmaking ; and
when all the parts are finnlly as-
sembled, he sees how individual
bad workmanship can spoil the
work as a whole".
just One \week"
I x another outbuilding I saw pu-pil-watchmakers being giyen a
lesson in elementary French. In
the most advanced class of all, talks
are given on literature, so that
those with intellectual tastes and
backgrounds can re-discover the
same cultural level in this new life
to which they must now adapt
themselves.
"'F auld you like to meet someone
in your own line of work", asked
my guide. He led me in front of
one of the machine-tools and intro-
duced me to the man who was
working it-a former Polish
journalist.
"At first it was pretty hard", the
journalist told me. "I thought I
would never get the hang of it.
But it comes, little by little..."
"You're too modest", replied my
guide,"too modest and too impa-
tint". Then to me :"Look at this
adjustment he's just done. It's abso-
lutely accurate. And do you know
how long he's been working with
his hands ? Just one week!"

1 NEW SKILLS - AND HOPES : Men of many nationalities and professionalbackgrounds learn to become pr fessional watchmakers in the IRO rehabi-
titation centre near Valence, France.
TECHNICAL INSTRUCTION is given in the making of main watch parts.
Here, some are being turned on lathes in the centre's modern workshops.
REFUGEES ARE TRAINEO in each stage of watchmaking. This pupil
 is using a pressing machine which with delicate precision prints the watch
face.
MEN WITHOUT A COUNTRY develop a new confidence in themselves
and in the the future as their training equips them for a speciatized trade. The
centre near Valance is to become a permanent community in whose management
the ex-pupils will share.
